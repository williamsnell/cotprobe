Okay, so I've got this question here about converting lit-atm to joules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Wait, first, what's a lit-atm? Oh right, it's liter-atmospheres. I remember that work can be expressed in different units depending on the system, like joules in SI and sometimes liter-atmospheres in chemistry perhaps.

So the question is asking how many joules are equivalent to one liter-atm of work. The options are A through J, each with a number around 100 joules. I think the exact value is something close to 100 but not exactly.

I recall that 1 atmosphere is about 101325 pascals. And 1 liter is 0.001 cubic meters, right? Because 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 1 liter is 1/1000 of a cubic meter. So 0.001 m³.

Work is pressure multiplied by volume. So when you have a lit-atm, it's like pressure times volume. So work (W) = P * V.

So substituting the values: P is 1 atm (which is 101325 Pa) and V is 1 liter (0.001 m³). So W = 101325 Pa * 0.001 m³.

Wait, Pa is N/m², so when you multiply by m³, you get N*m, which is a joule. So that makes sense.

Let me calculate that. 101325 multiplied by 0.001. Let's see, 101325 * 0.001 = 101.325 joules. Oh wait, but wait, that would be if it was 1 m³, but since it's 1 liter, it's 0.001. So 101325 * 0.001 is 101.325 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is option A: 106.4, which is a bit higher. Or maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, wait, sometimes in chemistry, especially in the context of gas work, the conversion factor is slightly different. Or perhaps because I'm using the wrong value for atmospheric pressure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should double-check the exact conversion factor. I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J, but sometimes it's rounded to about 100 J. But I'm not sure if there's a precise value here.

Wait, but the options don't have 101.3 exactly. Let me look again. Option E is 101.3, but looking at the provided options, (looking back) the options are A:106.4, B:98.6, C:99.5, D:97.8, E:101.3, F:102.0, G:100.0, H:103.5, I:104.2, J:105.0.

Oh, wait, option E is 101.3. That's exactly what I calculated. So why isn't that the correct answer? But sometimes, in practice, I've heard that 1 L·atm is taken as approximately 100 J, but maybe that's an approximation.

Wait, but maybe my initial assumption was right. So the correct answer would be E:101.3 J. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've heard some sources say it's about 100 J, but perhaps that's rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different pressure for an atmosphere. Because sometimes, standard atmospheric pressure is taken as 1 atm = 100,000 Pa for simplicity. If that's the case, then 1 L·atm would be 100,000 * 0.001 = 100 J. So then, that would be option G.

But which one is the correct approach? Because I remember that the exact value is 101325 Pa, but sometimes approximations are used.

Wait, let me think again. 1 atm is exactly 101325 Pa. So 1 L·atm = 101325 Pa * 0.001 m³ = 101.325 J. So that's exactly 101.325 J. So looking at the options, option E is 101.3, which is very close. So that's the correct answer.

But wait, wait a minute. I've also heard that in some contexts, like when using the gas constant R, 1 L·atm is taken as 101.325 J, but perhaps the question is considering a slightly different value, maybe due to unit definitions or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a confusion between the liter-atmosphere and other units. Oh wait, another thought: sometimes, the conversion uses 1 atm = 1.01325e5 Pa, which is exactly what I used. So 1e5 is 100,000, but 1.01325e5 is 101,325.

So the exact calculation gives 101.325 J, which matches option E (101.3 J). So the correct answer should be E.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've seen some textbooks use 100 J as an approximation. But the question gives an option that's very close to the exact value. So I think the intended answer is E:101.3 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 102.0, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check my math.

101325 * 0.001 = 101.325. Yep, that's correct. So option E is the exact value. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine how many joules are equivalent to one liter-atmosphere (L·atm) of work, we start by converting the units. One atmosphere (atm) is equal to 101,325 pascals (Pa), and one liter (L) is equivalent to 0.001 cubic meters (m³). Work is calculated as pressure multiplied by volume, so:

\[
W = P \cdot V
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
W = 101,325 \, \text{Pa} \cdot 0.001 \, \text{m}^3 = 101.325 \, \text{J}
\]

This calculation shows that 1 L·atm is exactly 101.325 joules. Among the provided options, the closest value is **101.3 J**, which corresponds to option E. While approximations like 100 J are sometimes used in practice, the exact value based on the definition of 1 atm as 101,325 Pa makes option E the correct choice.
