Question:

A man and a woman were passengers on a plane. They were seated next to one another in the first- class section of the plane. Midway through the flight, the woman excused herself and went to the restroom. While she was gone, the man rummaged through the woman's purse and stole $100 in cash. Unknown to the man, a flight attendant saw him steal the money. As is customary in such situations, the flight attendant radioed ahead, and police officers arrested the man when the plane landed. The man was subsequently charged with violating an applicable federal larceny statute. During the trial, the prosecuting attorney called the man's wife as a willing witness against her husband. She proposed to testify that the man confided to her that he did steal the woman's money during the flight. The man's attorney objected on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. The wife's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because it is privileged, though it is not hearsay.
B: admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.
C: admissible, because it is hearsay within a recognized exception and not privileged.
D: inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
E: admissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
F: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, and it discloses a privileged communication.
G: inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.
H: admissible, both because it does not disclose a privileged communication and because it is hearsay within a recognized exception.
I: inadmissible, because it is hearsay within a recognized exception, though it is not privileged.
J: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay and privilege. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a man who stole money from a woman on a plane. A flight attendant saw him, and he got arrested. Now, during his trial, the prosecution is calling his wife as a witness. She wants to testify that her husband confessed to her about stealing the money. The defense objects on hearsay and privilege grounds.

So the main issues here are whether the wife's testimony is hearsay and whether it's covered by a privilege, probably the marital privilege.

First, I need to recall the rules about hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the wife is testifying about what her husband told her. That seems like a statement made out of court, so it could be hearsay. But there are exceptions.

Wait, but in this case, the husband's statement to his wife is being offered to prove he committed the crime. So it's being used for the truth—that he stole the money. That would make it hearsay unless an exception applies.

What exceptions apply to statements made by a party (the defendant here) to another person? Oh right, the statement against interest exception, but wait, that's for when the declarant is unavailable. Or maybe the excited utterance? Or perhaps the statement is admissible under the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception because it's a statement made by a co-conspirator, but wait, the wife isn't a co-conspirator here. Alternatively, maybe it's a statement by a party-opponent under FRE 801(d)(2), which makes it non-hearsay.

Wait, under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed. But the wife isn't an agent or employee. So maybe that's not applicable. Another option is that statements by a party-opponent are exempt from hearsay under 801(d)(2). So if the husband made the statement, and it's being offered against him, then it's not hearsay. So the statement wouldn't be hearsay because it falls under 801(d)(2)(A). So that would make the evidence admissible as non-hearsay.

Wait, but that's if the statement is being offered against the party. Yes, in this case, the prosecution is offering the husband's statement against him to prove his guilt. So under 801(d)(2), it's not hearsay. So the hearsay objection might not hold.

Now, the other issue is privilege. The attorney objected on the grounds of privilege. So what privilege applies here? Marital privilege, right? The marital communication privilege covers confidential communications between spouses made during the marriage. But there's an exception when the communication is about a crime or a tort committed against the other spouse. Wait, but in this case, the crime is against a third party, not the spouse. So does the privilege still apply?

Wait, the marital communication privilege generally protects confidential communications between spouses while they were married. But there's an exception when the communication relates to a crime or tort against the other spouse. Since here, the husband's statement was about stealing from another person, not the wife, so the exception wouldn't apply. Therefore, the communication would normally be privileged.

But wait, I remember that in some jurisdictions, the marital privilege can be invoked even in criminal cases, but sometimes the court may find that the communication isn't privileged if it relates to a crime. Wait, the general rule is that a spouse can't be compelled to testify against the other, but if the spouse willingly testifies, perhaps the privilege is waived. Also, the marital communication privilege can be invoked to prevent the other spouse from testifying about their confidential communications.

Wait, but in this case, the wife is a willing witness. So the husband can assert the marital privilege to prevent her from testifying about their confidential communications, unless an exception applies.

But the exception is when the communication relates to a crime or tort against the other spouse. Here, the crime is against a third party, so the exception doesn't apply. Therefore, the communication would be privileged, and the wife can't testify about it unless the privilege is not applicable.

Wait, but in the case of Trammel v. United States, the Supreme Court held that the spouse of a defendant can testify against the defendant if they wish, but the defendant's spouse cannot be compelled to testify. So the witness spouse's testimony is admissible if it's voluntary. So the marital privilege in the sense of confidential communications can be invoked by the defendant to prevent the spouse from testifying about their private conversations.

Wait, but in this case, the wife is a willing witness, so she wants to testify. But the husband can assert the marital communication privilege to prevent her from disclosing their confidential conversations.

Wait, but wait, the Supreme Court in Trammel said that the accused may assert the privilege, but the witness spouse may choose to testify or not. So if the witness spouse is willing, the testimony is admissible because the witness can waive the privilege. Or does the defendant have the right to assert the privilege even if the spouse wants to testify?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The marital communication privilege generally protects both spouses from testifying about their confidential communications. But in Trammel, the court held that the witness spouse's testimony is not compelled, so if the witness spouse wants to testify, the defendant cannot prevent them from doing so. So in this case, since the wife is a willing witness, the marital communication privilege cannot be used by the husband to prevent her testimony.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me clarify. The Trammel case said that the government cannot compel a spouse to testify against the other, but if the spouse volunteers, they can testify. So the defendant cannot prevent the spouse from testifying if the spouse wants to. Therefore, in this scenario, since the wife is a willing witness, the husband's assertion of marital privilege would fail. So the testimony would not be privileged.

Wait, but that's about the spousal immunity, right? Spousal immunity is different from the marital communication privilege. Spousal immunity is about whether one spouse can be compelled to testify against the other. The other is about confidential communications.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up two different privileges here. The question is about the privilege that applies to the content of the communication, not whether the spouse can be compelled to testify. So the marital communication privilege applies to confidential communications between spouses. So even if the spouse is willing, the content of the communication may be privileged unless an exception applies.

So in this case, the wife is testifying about a communication from her husband. The husband could assert that this is a confidential marital communication, thus privileged. But exceptions to the marital communication privilege include when the communication relates to a crime or tort committed against the other spouse or when it's about a crime, perhaps.

Wait, the federal rule on marital communications privilege is under FRE 504. It says that a spouse can refuse to testify about a confidential communication made during the marriage. But the rule doesn't apply to communications regarding crimes and torts intended to harm the other spouse. So if the communication is about a crime against someone else, the privilege applies.

So in this case, the husband told the wife about stealing from another person. So the communication is about a crime, but not against the wife. So the exception doesn't apply, and the communication is privileged.

But wait, the wife is testifying willingly. Does that mean she's waiving the privilege? Or can the husband still assert it? I think that the marital communication privilege can be asserted by either spouse, but if the witness spouse is the holder of the privilege, she can choose to testify, thus waiving it. Wait, but in this case, the husband is the defendant, and he's asserting the privilege to prevent her from testifying. So perhaps he can prevent her from testifying about their confidential communication, even if she's willing.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The marital communication privilege allows either spouse to prevent the other from testifying about confidential communications made during the marriage. So even if the wife is willing, the husband can assert the privilege to prevent her testimony.

But wait, some sources say that the privilege is held by both spouses, but the witness spouse can choose to testify, thereby waiving the privilege. So if the wife wants to testify, she can, and the husband can't stop her. So in that case, the privilege wouldn't apply because the wife is willing.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to find the rule. Under FRE 504, the marital communication privilege applies in civil and criminal proceedings. It protects confidential communications made during the marriage. Either spouse can claim the privilege. But if one spouse is willing to testify, the other can't prevent them. Wait, no, the rule says that the privilege can be claimed by either spouse. So if the husband objects, even if the wife is willing, he can prevent her from testifying about the communication.

Wait, no, that's not right. The Supreme Court in Trammel v. United States said that a spouse cannot be compelled to testify against the other, but if the spouse volunteers, they can. So in terms of immunity, the witness spouse can't be compelled, but can choose to testify. However, the marital communication privilege is a separate issue. So even if the wife is willing, the husband could assert the privilege to prevent her from testifying about their confidential communications, unless an exception applies.

But I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it differently. Let's assume that the statement is hearsay but falls under an exception, or is non-hearsay. And whether the marital privilege applies.

First, the hearsay issue: the wife's testimony is about the husband's statement. The statement is being offered for the truth—that he stole the money. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

As mentioned earlier, under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or employee. But the wife isn't an agent. So that doesn't apply. However, under 801(d)(2)(A), it's not hearsay if it's a statement by a party-opponent. So any statement by a party offered by the opposing party is non-hearsay. So the husband's statement to his wife is offered by the prosecution against the husband, so it's a party-opponent statement, thus not hearsay. So the hearsay objection is overcome because it's non-hearsay under 801(d)(2)(A).

Now, the privilege issue. The husband's statement to his wife is a confidential marital communication. So under FRE 504, the husband can assert the marital communication privilege to prevent the wife from testifying about it. But can he do that if the wife is willing to testify?

Wait, the rule says that the privilege may be claimed by either spouse. So if the wife is the witness, the husband can assert the privilege to prevent her from disclosing the communication, even if she's willing. So the testimony would be inadmissible because it's a privileged communication.

Wait, but some sources say that the witness spouse can choose to testify, thereby waiving the privilege. So if the wife is willing, she can testify despite the husband's objection. So in that case, the privilege wouldn't apply, and the testimony would be admissible.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me check: under the Federal Rules, the marital communication privilege is held by both spouses, but if one spouse is called as a witness and wants to testify, they can do so, effectively waiving the privilege. So the husband cannot prevent the wife from testifying about their confidential communication if she's willing. So the privilege wouldn't apply here.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the general rule is that the marital communication privilege can be invoked by either spouse, but if the witness spouse is the one who holds the privilege, she can choose to testify and thereby waive it. So in this case, since the wife is the witness and is willing, she can testify, and the husband can't prevent her. So the privilege wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, if the privilege is held jointly, the husband could assert it even if the wife is willing. But I think the majority approach is that the witness spouse can choose to testify, thus waiving the privilege.

So, if the hearsay issue is resolved because the statement is non-hearsay under 801(d)(2)(A), and the privilege doesn't apply because the wife is willing to testify, then the testimony is admissible.

Wait, but wait, the options are about whether it's admissible based on hearsay and privilege. So if it's not hearsay and not privileged, it's admissible.

Looking back at the options, option B says it's admissible because it's neither hearsay nor privileged. Option C says it's admissible because it's hearsay within an exception and not privileged. But wait, I thought it's not hearsay because of 801(d)(2)(A), so option B would be correct.

But wait, let me think again. The statement is made by the husband to the wife. The prosecution is offering it as a statement by a party-opponent, so it's non-hearsay. So the hearsay objection is invalid. As for privilege, if the wife is willing, she can testify, so the marital communication privilege doesn't apply. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

So looking at the options, option B is admissible because neither hearsay nor privileged.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B: admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.

Option H: admissible because it does not disclose a privileged communication and because it is hearsay within a recognized exception.

Wait, no. I thought the statement is non-hearsay, so option B would be correct.

Alternatively, if the statement is hearsay but within an exception, then option C would apply. But I thought it's non-hearsay.

So I'm a bit torn between options B and C.

Wait, under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), the statement is not hearsay. So the hearsay objection fails, and the testimony is admissible as non-hearsay. So the correct reasoning is that it's admissible because it's neither hearsay nor privileged.

So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the statement might be privileged. But if the wife is willing, the privilege doesn't apply. So option B is correct.

But wait, let me double-check. If the statement is non-hearsay, then the hearsay objection is overcome. And if the wife is willing, the marital privilege doesn't prevent the testimony. So the testimony is admissible on both grounds.

So the correct answer is B: admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the wife's testimony regarding her husband's confession, with objections based on hearsay and privilege. Here's the analysis:

### Hearsay Analysis:
- **Hearsay Definition**: Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The wife's testimony about her husband's confession is a statement made out of court and is being offered to prove that the husband committed the crime. 
- **Exception/Non-Hearsay**: Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and was made by the party or their agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship while it existed. Here, the husband's statement to his wife is being offered against him, and it qualifies as a party-opponent statement under this rule. Therefore, the statement is **not hearsay**.

### Privilege Analysis:
- **Marital Communication Privilege**: This privilege protects confidential communications between spouses made during the marriage. However, the privilege can be waived by the witness spouse if they are willing to testify. 
- **Application Here**: The wife is a willing witness, and under the Supreme Court's decision in *Trammel v. United States*, a spouse who voluntarily chooses to testify cannot be prevented from doing so by the other spouse asserting the marital privilege. Thus, the marital communication privilege does not apply in this case because the wife is testifying voluntarily.

### Conclusion:
Since the wife's testimony is **not hearsay** under FRE 801(d)(2)(A) and the marital communication privilege does not apply because the wife is a willing witness, the testimony is admissible.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not privileged, and it is not hearsay.
- **Option B**: Correct. The testimony is admissible because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay, so it does not fall under a hearsay exception.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The testimony does not disclose a privileged communication, and it is not hearsay.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The testimony is not privileged, and it is not hearsay.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay, and it does not disclose a privileged communication.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay, and it does not disclose a privileged communication.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay, so it does not fall under a hearsay exception.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay, and it is not privileged.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay, and it is not privileged.

The correct answer is **B**: admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.
