Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about two carts colliding and sticking together. Hmm, I remember this is a perfectly inelastic collision because they stick together after the collision.

So, the setup is a moving 1.5-kg cart colliding with a 0.5-kg cart that's initially at rest. After the collision, they move together. The question is asking what each cart has the same of immediately after the collision.

The options are various physics terms like velocity, potential energy, torque, etc. I need to pick the correct one.

I think in collisions, certain quantities are conserved. Wait, in any collision, momentum is conserved, right? But wait, that's true for the system as a whole. So the total momentum before equals the total after. But the question is about each cart having the same property after the collision.

In a perfectly inelastic collision, the two objects stick together and move with the same velocity. Oh right, because they become one mass. So their velocities are the same. So for velocity, that's an option. But wait, the question is about each having the same as each other. So velocity would definitely be the same, so option A could be correct.

But let me think about the other options. Kinetic energyâ€”no, because kinetic energy isn't conserved in inelastic collisions. The combined mass has less kinetic energy than before. So E: Kinetic energy is not the same for each cart, because together they have a single kinetic energy. So E doesn't make sense.

Potential energy? Well, unless they're in a gravitational field and their height changes, but the question doesn't mention that. So B is probably not right.

Torque and angular momentum are more about rotational motion, but these are carts moving in a straight line, so linear motion. So options C, G (torque and angular momentum) are probably not relevant here.

Gravitational pull (D)... each cart would have the same gravitational pull? Well, gravitational force depends on mass. The first cart is 1.5 kg and the second is 0.5 kg. So their gravitational pulls would be different. So D is out.

Linear momentum (F) is conserved in the system, but each cart's individual momentum might not be the same. Wait, after collision, they move together with the same velocity. So their momenta would be (mass)*(velocity). Since their masses are different, their individual momenta would be different. So F is not the answer.

Acceleration (H) after collision? Well, once they're moving together, they have the same velocity, so acceleration would be zero if no external forces. But if there was an external force, like friction, both would accelerate together, but they'd have same acceleration. Hmm, but the question is immediately after collision, so maybe the collision imparts some acceleration, but after that, they move with same velocity. I'm not sure. But I think the key point is that velocity is the same, so A is a candidate.

Force (I) during the collision? Well, according to Newton's third law, the forces on each other are equal and opposite. But that's during the collision. After the collision, when they're moving together, what forces are acting? If no external forces, then their accelerations are zero, so no net force. But each cart's individual force... Maybe internal forces between them, but not sure. I don't think force is the same for each cart in this context. So I probably doesn't apply here.

Mass (J) is definitely different. One is 1.5 kg, the other 0.5 kg, so their masses are different. So J is incorrect.

So circling back, the correct answer seems to be A: Velocity. Because after collision, both move with the same velocity.

In a perfectly inelastic collision, where two objects stick together, certain properties are conserved or become equal. The question asks what property becomes the same for each cart immediately after the collision.

1. **Velocity (A):** In a perfectly inelastic collision, the two objects move together with the same velocity after the collision. This is a fundamental characteristic of such collisions, making this a strong candidate.

2. **Potential Energy (B):** The problem does not involve changes in height or gravitational fields, so potential energy is irrelevant here.

3. **Torque (C) and Angular Momentum (G):** These concepts apply to rotational motion, but the scenario involves linear motion, so these are not applicable.

4. **Gravitational Pull (D):** Gravitational force depends on mass, and since the carts have different masses, their gravitational pulls are different. This is not the correct answer.

5. **Kinetic Energy (E):** Kinetic energy is not conserved in inelastic collisions, and the total kinetic energy is shared between the combined mass. Individual kinetic energies are not the same.

6. **Linear Momentum (F):** While total linear momentum is conserved for the system, the individual momenta of the carts are different because their masses are different.

7. **Acceleration (H):** After the collision, if no external forces act, both carts have zero acceleration. However, the question focuses on the immediate aftermath of the collision, where the focus is on velocity, not acceleration.

8. **Force (I):** During the collision, internal forces between the carts are equal and opposite, but after the collision, the carts move together with the same velocity, making force less relevant in this context.

9. **Mass (J):** The masses of the carts are different (1.5 kg and 0.5 kg), so this is not the same for each cart.

The correct answer is **Velocity (A)**, as the carts move together with the same velocity immediately after the collision.
