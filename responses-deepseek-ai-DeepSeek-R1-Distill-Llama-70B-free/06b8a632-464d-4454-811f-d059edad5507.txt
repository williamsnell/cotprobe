Question:

What experimental evidence indicates that genes control the aminoacid sequences in proteins?

Options:

A: The amino acid sequence in a protein is not related to genetics.
B: Direct observation of genes attaching amino acids to growing protein chains in live cells.
C: Genes have no control over aminoacid sequences in proteins.
D: Studies have shown that the removal of certain genes does not affect the amino acid sequence in proteins.
E: Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.
F: The presence of identical amino acid sequences in proteins from unrelated species.
G: Aminoacid sequences in proteins are determined by environmental factors.
H: The synthesis of amino acids in laboratory conditions without any genetic material involved.
I: Ribosome malfunction has been shown to produce identical amino acid sequences in different proteins.
J: The uniformity of amino acid sequences in proteins across all living organisms suggests genetic control.

Okay, so I've got this question here about experimental evidence showing that genes control the amino acid sequences in proteins. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that proteins are made of amino acids, and the sequence of these acids determines the protein's structure and function. But how exactly do genes control that?

I think genes contain the instructions for making proteins. Oh right, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein. So the sequence of nucleotides in the gene must determine the sequence of amino acids. But the question is about the experimental evidence that supports this.

Looking at the options:

Option A says amino acids in proteins aren't related to genetics. That doesn't make sense because I remember DNA directly influences protein structure, so A is probably wrong.

Option B talks about observing genes attaching amino acids. Wait, genes are DNA, and they don't directly attach amino acids. That's the job of ribosomes and tRNA during translation. So B is incorrect.

Option C claims genes have no control. That's definitely wrong because the whole central dogma is about genes controlling protein sequences.

Option D says removing certain genes doesn't affect amino acid sequences. That seems odd because if a gene is removed, you might expect the protein it codes for to be affected. So D might be a trick option, but I'm not sure yet.

Option E mentions Ingram's discovery. Ingram did something with hemoglobin, right? I think he compared normal and sickle cell hemoglobin. Sickle cell is caused by a mutation in the gene for hemoglobin, leading to a different amino acid sequence. So E sounds like a strong candidate because it directly links a gene mutation to an altered protein sequence.

Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated species. That's more about evolution and common ancestry, not direct evidence that genes control the sequence. So F isn't the right evidence here.

Option G says environment determines amino acids. No, the environment can influence gene expression, but the sequence is determined by the gene. So G is wrong.

Option H is about synthesizing amino acids in the lab without genes. That doesn't relate to the genetic control of sequences in proteins. So H isn't relevant.

Option I mentions ribosome malfunction leading to identical sequences. If ribosomes are malfunctioning, that might cause errors but doesn't show genes control the sequences. So I isn't the answer.

Option J suggests uniformity across species implies genetic control. Uniformity might suggest common genes, but the question is about evidence that genes control the sequences, so J might not be directly showing that link.

So circling back, the key here is an experiment showing a gene mutation leads to a change in amino acid sequence. Ingram's work with sickle cell anemia comes to mind. He showed that a single mutation caused a change from glutamic acid to valine in hemoglobin. That's direct evidence that the gene controls the sequence.

The experimental evidence that indicates genes control the amino acid sequences in proteins is best demonstrated by Ingram's discovery. Ingram's work involved comparing the amino acid sequences of normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. He found that a single mutation in the gene responsible for hemoglobin resulted in a change from glutamic acid to valine, leading to the abnormal protein structure associated with sickle cell anemia. This directly links a gene mutation to an altered amino acid sequence, providing clear evidence that genes control the amino acid sequences in proteins.

E: Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.
