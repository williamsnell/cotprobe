Question:

Dermanand Klein are the sole stockholders of the Leather Products Corporation. It is estimated that Leather Products will have a taxable income of $30,000 this year. The stock is evenly divided between Mr.Dermanand Mr. Klein, so that resulting dividends will also be equally shared. Both Mr. Dermanand Mr. Klein expect to receive from other sources a net taxable income of $12,000. All profit after taxes Leather Products makes this year will be paid out as dividends. Mr.Dermanwants to introduce a new product. Should this venture succeed, the annual income before taxes will increase by $10,000. What will be the increase in stockholders' income after taxes? Use the tables "Federal Taxes Rates on 1949 Net Incomes of Corporations in the United States", and "Federal Tax Rates on 1949 Incomes of Individuals in the United States."

Options:

A: $1,129.88
B: $850
C: $1,050
D: $2,250
E: $2,400
F: $1,500
G: $2,000
H: $900
I: $3,000
J: $1,200

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Derman and Klein, who are the sole stockholders of Leather Products Corporation. They're trying to figure out the increase in their after-tax income if Derman's new product venture succeeds. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem states that Leather Products has a taxable income of $30,000 this year. The stock is split evenly between Derman and Klein, so each will get half of the dividends. Both of them have other taxable income of $12,000 each. All the profits after taxes are paid out as dividends. So, the first thing I need to figure out is how much the corporation pays in taxes, and then what the dividends are.

Wait, I remember that corporations pay taxes on their taxable income, and then the dividends are distributed from the after-tax income. So, first, I need to calculate the corporate tax on $30,000. The question refers to the 1949 tax tables for corporations. I'm not exactly sure what the rates were, but I think they had different brackets. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should outline the steps clearly:

1. Calculate the corporation's tax on $30,000 taxable income.
2. Subtract that tax from $30k to get the after-tax income, which is the dividend pool.
3. Since the stock is evenly split, each gets half of the dividends, so each gets (after-tax income)/2.
4. Now, when Derman and Klein receive these dividends, they have to pay individual income tax on it. But wait, in 1949, were dividends taxed at the individual level? I think so, but I'm not 100% sure. Oh wait, but the question gives us the individual tax tables, so I guess we have to consider that.

Wait, but there's a catch here. The tax rates for individuals might be different based on their total income. So each of them already has $12k in taxable income from other sources. Adding the dividends to that will change their tax brackets, which affects the rate applied to the additional income.

But wait, the problem is about the increase in their after-tax income when the corporation's income increases by $10k. So, let me first figure out the current situation, then the new situation, and find the difference.

So, let me proceed step by step.

First, current situation: Corporation has taxable income $30k.

I need to calculate the corporate tax. Looking up the 1949 corporate tax rates. I think in 1949, the corporate tax rates were as follows (I might be wrong, but I'll proceed with what I remember):

- On the first $5,000: 20%
- Next $15,000 (so up to $20k): 22%
- Next $25,000 (so up to $45k): 30%
Wait, no, perhaps the brackets are different. Alternatively, perhaps the tax is calculated in a different way. Wait, maybe I should think of it as a flat rate above a certain amount. Alternatively, perhaps the 1949 corporate tax rates had different brackets. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. For 1949, the corporate tax rates were a bit complex. For example, I think the first $5,000 was taxed at 20%, the next $15,000 (so up to $20k) at 22%, and anything above that at 30%. Or maybe higher brackets. Alternatively, perhaps the rate was 30% on the entire amount if it exceeds a certain threshold. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the tax is a flat 30% on the entire taxable income. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem refers to using the tax tables, implying that the tax isn't a flat rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the corporate tax is calculated as follows: for 1949, the tax is 20% on the first $5,000, 22% on the next $20,000 (so up to $25,000), and 30% on anything above $25,000. So for $30,000 taxable income:

- First $5,000: 20% → $1,000
- Next $20,000 (up to $25k): 22% → $4,400
- The remaining $5,000 (since 30k-25k=5k): 30% → $1,500
So total tax would be 1,000 + 4,400 + 1,500 = $6,900.

Wait, but wait. Let me check that again. If the taxable income is $30,000, and the brackets are as I thought:

- 20% on first $5k: $1k
- 22% on next $20k (so up to $25k): 20k *22% = $4,400
- 30% on the remaining $5k: 5k *30% = $1,500
Adding up: 1k + 4.4k = 5.4k, plus 1.5k equals 6.9k total tax.

So the corporation's after-tax income is 30k - 6.9k = $23,100.

Since the stock is evenly split, each gets half of that, so each gets 23,100 / 2 = $11,550.

Now, each of them has other taxable income of $12k, so their total income before considering the dividends is $12k. Adding the dividends, their total income becomes 12k + 11,550 = $23,550 each.

Wait, no, wait. Wait. No, wait, the $11,550 is after the corporation has paid its taxes. So the dividend each receives is $11,550. But then, when they receive that dividend, they have to pay individual income tax on it. Because in 1949, dividends were taxed as ordinary income, I think.

So each of them will have to include the $11,550 in their taxable income. So their total taxable income is 12k (from other sources) + 11,550 (dividend) = $23,550 each.

Now, I need to calculate the individual income tax on $23,550. Using the 1949 individual tax tables. What were the brackets? Let me try to recall. I think in 1949, the tax brackets for individuals were as follows:

- 20% on the first $2,000
- 22% on the next $2,000 (so up to $4k)
- 26% on the next $2,000 (up to $6k)
- 30% on the next $2,000 (up to $8k)
- 34% on the next $2,000 (up to $10k)
- 38% on the next $2,000 (up to $12k)
- 40% on the next $2,000 (up to $14k)
- 42% on the next $2,000 (up to $16k)
- 44% on the next $2,000 (up to $18k)
- 46% on the next $2,000 (up to $20k)
- 48% on the next $2,000 (up to $22k)
- 50% on anything above $22k.

Wait, I might be mixing up the exact rates, but I think that's the general structure. So each person's taxable income is $23,550. Let's compute their tax.

Let me structure it step by step:

- $0 - $2,000: 20% → $400
- $2k - $4k (next $2k): 22% → 440
- $4k - $6k: 26% → 520
- $6k - $8k: 30% → 600
- $8k - $10k: 34% → 680
- $10k - $12k: 38% → 760
- $12k - $14k: 40% → 800
- $14k - $16k: 42% → 840
- $16k - $18k: 44% → 880
- $18k - $20k: 46% → 920
- $20k - $22k: 48% → 960
- $22k - $23.55k: 50% on the remaining $1.55k → 775

Wait, let me check:

Let me list the ranges and calculate each portion:

1. 0 - 2k: 2k *20% = 400
2. 2k-4k: 2k *22% = 440 → total so far 840
3. 4k-6k: 2k *26% =520 → total 1,360
4. 6k-8k: 2k *30% =600 → total 1,960
5. 8k-10k: 2k *34% =680 → total 2,640
6. 10k-12k: 2k *38% =760 → total 3,400
7. 12k-14k: 2k *40% =800 → total 4,200
8. 14k-16k: 2k *42% =840 → total 5,040
9. 16k-18k: 2k *44% =880 → total 5,920
10. 18k-20k: 2k *46% =920 → total 6,840
11. 20k-22k: 2k *48% =960 → total 7,800
12. 22k-23.55k: 1.55k *50% =775 → total tax 7,800 +775 =8,575.

So each individual's tax is $8,575. Therefore, their after-tax income from all sources is total income 23,550 minus tax 8,575 → 23,550 -8,575 = $14,975.

Wait, but each receives $11,550 as a dividend. So their total after-tax income is their other income ($12k) minus tax on that, plus the dividend minus tax on the dividend. Hmm, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the tax on their other income of $12k, then compute the tax on the $11,550, then combine. Alternatively, compute the total tax on $23,550 as I did, which gives me $8,575. So their after-tax is 23,550 -8,575=14,975.

Wait, but perhaps that's not correct. Because their other income is $12k, which is taxed at a certain rate, and the dividend is added on top. Wait, perhaps I should compute the tax on $12k, then see how much more tax they pay when adding the $11,550.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the tax on $12k, subtract that, then add the after-tax dividend. Let's try that approach.

So, for each individual, without any dividends, their taxable income is $12k. Let's compute their tax on that.

Using the same tax brackets:

Taxable income $12k:

1. 0-2k: 20% →400
2. 2k-4k:22% →440 → total 840
3. 4k-6k:26% →520 → total 1,360
4. 6k-8k:30% →600 → total 1,960
5. 8k-10k:34% →680 → total 2,640
6. 10k-12k:38% →760 → total 3,400.

So tax on $12k is $3,400. So after-tax from other sources is 12k -3,400=8,600.

Now, the dividend is $11,550. But when they receive this, their total income becomes 23,550, and their tax becomes 8,575 as calculated earlier. So the after-tax income is 23,550 -8,575=14,975.

Alternatively, the after-tax from other income is 8,600, and the dividend is 11,550, but the tax on that would be the difference between the tax on 23,550 and the tax on 12k.

So the incremental tax due to the dividend is 8,575 (total tax) -3,400 (tax on 12k) =5,175.

Therefore, the after-tax dividend is 11,550 -5,175=6,375.

So their total after-tax income would be 8,600 (from other sources) +6,375 (after-tax dividend)=14,975, which matches the earlier calculation.

So each stockholder's after-tax income is $14,975.

Now, the question is about introducing a new product that increases the corporation's income before taxes by $10k, making the new taxable income 30k +10k=40k.

So we need to compute the new after-tax dividend per person and see how much their after-tax income increases.

So, first, compute the corporate tax on $40k.

Using the same corporate tax brackets as before:

- First $5k:20% →1k
- Next $20k (up to 25k):22% →4,400
- Next $15k (from 25k to 40k):30% →4,500

Wait, 5k +20k=25k, so 40k-25k=15k taxed at 30%, so 15k *30% =4,500.

Total tax:1k +4.4k +4.5k=9,900.

After-tax income:40k -9,900=30,100.

Divided equally between the two stockholders:30,100 /2=15,050 each.

So each receives $15,050 as a dividend.

Now, adding this to their other income of $12k, their total taxable income is 12k +15,050=27,050.

Compute the tax on 27,050.

Using the individual tax brackets again:

Taxable income $27,050.

Let me compute each bracket:

1. 0-2k:20% →400
2. 2k-4k:22% →440 → total 840
3. 4k-6k:26% →520 →1,360
4. 6k-8k:30% →600 →1,960
5. 8k-10k:34% →680 →2,640
6. 10k-12k:38% →760 →3,400
7. 12k-14k:40% →800 →4,200
8. 14k-16k:42% →840 →5,040
9. 16k-18k:44% →880 →5,920
10. 18k-20k:46% →920 →6,840
11. 20k-22k:48% →960 →7,800
12. 22k-24k:50% →2k *50%=1,000 → total tax 8,800
13. 24k-26k: let's see, 27,050 is 24k +3,050.

Wait, perhaps I should structure it by each $2k bracket until I reach the amount.

Wait, 27,050 is 27k and 50. So let's break it down:

- Up to 22k: as before, up to 22k, the tax is 7,800 (as calculated earlier).
- 22k-24k: $2k taxed at 50% →1,000. So total tax up to 24k:7,800 +1,000=8,800.
- 24k-27k: $3k taxed at the next rate. What's the rate for income above 24k?

Wait, the earlier brackets I listed went up to 22k, then 50% on anything above 22k? No, wait, let me check again. I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the individual tax brackets correctly.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list the tax brackets properly. From what I can recall, the 1949 individual tax brackets were as follows, with the over a certain amount taxed at the given rate:

- 20% on the first $2,000
- 22% on income between $2,001 and $4,000
- 26% between $4,001 and $6,000
- 30% between $6,001 and $8,000
- 34% between $8,001 and $10,000
- 38% between $10,001 and $12,000
- 40% between $12,001 and $14,000
- 42% between $14,001 and $16,000
- 44% between $16,001 and $18,000
- 46% between $18,001 and $20,000
- 48% between $20,001 and $22,000
- 50% on income over $22,000.

So, for $27,050:

- The first 22k is taxed up to 48% on the last bracket (20k-22k). Then, the remaining 5,050 (27,050-22,000=5,050) is taxed at 50%.

Wait, let me compute each bracket step by step:

1. 0-2k: 2k *20% =400
2. 2k-4k: 2k *22% =440 → total 840
3. 4k-6k:2k *26% =520 →1,360
4. 6k-8k:2k *30% =600 →1,960
5. 8k-10k:2k *34% =680 →2,640
6. 10k-12k:2k *38% =760 →3,400
7. 12k-14k:2k *40% =800 →4,200
8. 14k-16k:2k *42% =840 →5,040
9. 16k-18k:2k *44% =880 →5,920
10. 18k-20k:2k *46% =920 →6,840
11. 20k-22k:2k *48% =960 →7,800
12. 22k-27,050:5,050 *50% =2,525 → total tax 7,800 +2,525=10,325.

Wait, but wait. I think
