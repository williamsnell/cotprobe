Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the delta response h[n] of a given difference equation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The equation given is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = x[n]. And we're told that h[-1] = 0. Wait, delta response—oh right, that's the impulse response, which is h[n] when x[n] is a delta function. So I need to solve this difference equation for h[n].

I remember that for linear systems, the impulse response is found by setting x[n] to δ[n]. So let's substitute x[n] with δ[n]. Then the equation becomes y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = δ[n].

Since it's a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients, I think the approach is to solve the homogeneous equation first and then find the particular solution for the impulse. But wait, since the input is δ[n], maybe we can directly find h[n] using the z-transform method. Oh right, z-transforms are useful here.

Let me recall the z-transform approach. The z-transform of the difference equation will turn the equation into an algebraic one which might be easier to solve. Taking the z-transform of both sides.

The z-transform of y[n] is Y[z]. Similarly, the z-transform of y[n-1] is z^{-1}Y[z], and y[n-2] is z^{-2}Y[z]. And the z-transform of δ[n] is 1.

So substituting into the equation, we get:
Y[z] - (5/6) z^{-1} Y[z] + (1/6) z^{-2} Y[z] = 1.

Let me factor Y[z] out:
Y[z] [1 - (5/6) z^{-1} + (1/6) z^{-2}] = 1.

So Y[z] = 1 / [1 - (5/6) z^{-1} + (1/6) z^{-2}].

Hmm, perhaps I should rewrite the denominator in terms of positive exponents to make it easier to handle. Multiply numerator and denominator by z^2 to eliminate the negative exponents.

So, Y[z] = z^2 / [z^2 - (5/6) z + 1/6].

Wait, let me double-check that. If I multiply denominator and numerator by z^2, denominator becomes z^2 * [1 - (5/6) z^{-1} + (1/6) z^{-2}] = z^2 - (5/6) z + 1/6.

So Y[z] = z^2 / (z^2 - (5/6) z + 1/6).

Now, I need to factor the denominator to perform partial fraction decomposition. Let's find its roots.

The denominator is a quadratic: z² - (5/6) z + 1/6 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: z = [ (5/6) ± sqrt( (5/6)^2 - 4 * 1 * 1/6 ) ] / 2.

Calculating discriminant D:
(5/6)^2 = 25/36
4 * 1 * 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3 = 24/36
So D = 25/36 - 24/36 = 1/36.

So sqrt(D) = 1/6.

Thus, roots are [5/6 ± 1/6 ] / 2.

Calculating each root:

First root: (5/6 + 1/6) / 2 = (6/6)/2 = (1)/2 = 1/2.

Second root: (5/6 - 1/6)/2 = (4/6)/2 = (2/3)/2 = 1/3.

So the denominator factors as (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3).

Wait wait, no. Because our denominator after multiplying by z² was z² - (5/6) z + 1/6. So the roots are at z = 1/2 and z = 1/3.

So Y[z] = z² / [ (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3) ) ].

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the denominator after multiplying by z² is z² - (5/6) z + 1/6. So the denominator factors are (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3) multiplied by z^2 to get back? No, wait, the denominator is (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3). Because:

(z - a)(z - b) = z² - (a + b) z + a b.

Here, a = 1/2, b=1/3. a + b = 5/6, and a b = (1/2)(1/3) = 1/6. Which matches. So yes, denominator is (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3).

So Y[z] = z² / [ (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3) ) ].

I need to express Y[z] as partial fractions. Let me write Y[z] as:

Y[z] = (A z + B) / (z - 1/2) + (C z + D) / (z - 1/3).

Wait, but considering the form of the z-transform for causal signals, maybe it's easier to express it in terms of z^{-1}?

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform partial fractions by assuming Y[z] = A/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) + B/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

Wait, let me think. Since the system is causal (because h[-1] = 0, so the impulse response is zero for n < 0), the ROC is outside the outermost pole. Here, the poles are at 1/2 and 1/3, so the ROC is |z| > 1/2.

But to find the inverse z-transform, it's easier to write Y[z] as a sum of terms like A/(1 - a z^{-1}), because their inverse transforms are known.

So to do that, let me factor Y[z] accordingly.

Y[z] = z^2 / [ (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3) ) ].

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite this as z² * [ 1/( (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3) ) ].

But perhaps it's easier to split the fraction. Let's consider:

1/( (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3) ) = A/(z - 1/2) + B/(z - 1/3).

Multiply both sides by (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3):

1 = A(z - 1/3) + B(z - 1/2).

To find A and B, substitute suitable values for z.

Let me set z = 1/2:

1 = A(1/2 - 1/3) + B(0).

1/2 - 1/3 = (3 - 2)/6 = 1/6.

So 1 = A*(1/6) → A = 6.

Similarly, set z =1/3:

1 = A(0) + B(1/3 - 1/2).

1/3 -1/2 = (2 - 3)/6 = -1/6.

So 1 = B*(-1/6) → B = -6.

So, 1/( (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3) ) = 6/(z - 1/2) -6/(z - 1/3).

Therefore, Y[z] = z² [6/(z - 1/2) -6/(z - 1/3)].

Which can be written as:

Y[z] = 6 z²/(z - 1/2) -6 z²/(z - 1/3).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the most helpful form. Alternatively, let me factor each term using z^{-1}.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express each term as (1/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1})) and similar for 1/3.

Let me try to manipulate the terms to get them into that form.

So, Y[z] = z² * [6/(z - 1/2) -6/(z -1/3) ].

Factor out z from denominator:

= z² [ 6/(z(1 - (1/2)/z ))  -6/(z(1 - (1/3)/z )) ) ]

= z² [ 6/(z (1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ) -6/(z (1 - (1/3) z^{-1} )) ) ]

Simplify:

= z² [ 6/(z (1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) )) ] - z² [6/(z (1 - (1/3) z^{-1} )) ]

= z² * [6/(z (1 - (1/2) z^{-1})) ) ] - z² * [6/(z (1 - (1/3) z^{-1})) ) ]

Simplify each term:

= (6 z²) / (z (1 - (1/2) z^{-1})) ) - (6 z²)/(z (1 - (1/3) z^{-1})) )

= 6 z / (1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ) - 6 z / (1 - (1/3) z^{-1}) )

Wait, but 6z/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ) can be written as 6 z * [1/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ].

The inverse z-transform of 1/(1 - a z^{-1}) is a^n u[n]. But for z * X[z], the inverse transform is x[n-1], right?

Wait, let me think. Let me recall that the z-transform of x[n-1] is z^{-1} X[z].

So, if I have X[z] = 1/(1 - a z^{-1}), then x[n] = a^n u[n].

If I have z * X[z], then the inverse would be x[n-1], because z X[z] corresponds to x[n-1] shifted.

Wait, no, actually, the time advance property says that if X[z] is the z-transform of x[n], then z^{k} X[z] is the z-transform of x[n -k], but for k positive, that's a time advance. But for causal signals, that would involve negative indices, which may not be causal. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, maybe I can write each term as 6 z / (1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ) = 6 * [ z / (1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ) ].

Let me separate z into z * 1, so:

= 6 [ z * (1/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) )) ]

= 6 [ ( (1/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ) ) * z ]

The term inside the brackets is (1/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1} )) ), whose inverse transform is ( (1/2)^n ) u[n]. So when multiplied by z, it's like taking the inverse transform and multiplying by δ[n+1], but perhaps it's better to express it as a shift.

Wait, the z-transform of x[n+1] is z X[z]. So, if I have z X[z], the inverse is x[n+1].

So, our term 6 z/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ) would have an inverse transform of 6 * (1/2)^{n-1} u[n-1]. Because x[n] = (1/2)^n u[n], so x[n-1] = (1/2)^{n-1} u[n-1]. 

Similarly for the other term, -6 z/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}) would be -6 * (1/3)^{n-1} u[n-1].

Putting it together, the inverse z-transform of Y[z] is:

h[n] = 6*(1/2)^{n-1} u[n-1] -6*(1/3)^{n-1} u[n-1].

But wait, since the system is causal, h[n] is zero for n < 0, which is consistent because u[n-1] is zero for n < 1.

But let me simplify this expression.

6*(1/2)^{n-1} =6 * (1/2)^{n} * 2 = 12*(1/2)^n.

Similarly, 6*(1/3)^{n-1} =6 * (1/3)^n *3= 18 (1/3)^n.

So substituting back:

h[n] = 12*(1/2)^n u[n-1] - 18*(1/3)^n u[n-1].

But u[n-1] is 1 for n >=1, and 0 otherwise. So for n >=1,

h[n] = 12*(1/2)^n - 18*(1/3)^n.

But wait, the problem states h[-1] =0, which we've satisfied because for n <0, h[n] is zero.

But perhaps I can write it in terms of u[n]. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can adjust the terms to express h[n] from n=0 onwards.

Wait, h[n] is zero for n <0, and for n=0, let's see. From the expression above, at n=0, u[n-1] is u[-1] which is 0, so h[0] =0. But when n=0, the delta function is applied, and h[0] is the response at n=0. Wait, but wait, in our setup, when x[n] is δ[n], y[n] is h[n], so h[0] should be the coefficient when n=0.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, when x[n] is δ[n], then for n=0, the equation is y[0] - (5/6) y[-1] + (1/6) y[-2] = δ[0] =1.

But y[-1] and y[-2] are 0 because the system is causal, right? Or wait, is the system causal? The problem states h[-1]=0, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the system being causal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the system isn't necessarily causal. But in this case, the problem gives h[-1] = 0, which might imply it's causal, but perhaps I should proceed without assuming that.

Wait, from the difference equation: y[n] = (5/6) y[n-1] - (1/6) y[n-2] + x[n].

This is a linear difference equation. The impulse response is the output when x[n] is δ[n], and initial conditions (y[-1], y[-2]) are zero, because it's a causal system. So for n=0:

y[0] = (5/6)y[-1] - (1/6)y[-2] + δ[0] = 0 +0 +1 =1.

So h[0] =1.

Wait, but according to the expression I got earlier, for n=0, h[0] would be zero because of the u[n-1] term. That's a problem. So perhaps my partial fraction approach was incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake when doing the partial fractions. Let me go back.

We had Y[z] = z² / [ (z -1/2)(z -1/3) ) ].

Let me try a different approach: write Y[z] as A/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) + B/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

Wait, perhaps I should express Y[z] as A/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) + B/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

So, Y[z] = A/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) + B/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

Multiply both sides by (1 - (1/2) z^{-1})(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

So, Y[z] * denominator = A (1 - (1/3) z^{-1}) + B (1 - (1/2) z^{-1}).

But Y[z] is z² / [ (z -1/2)(z -1/3) ) ] = z² / [ z² - (5/6) z +1/6 ].

Wait, but maybe it's easier to write Y[z] as:

Y[z] = (A z + B) / (z - 1/2) + (C z + D)/(z -1/3).

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that Y[z] = P(z) / Q(z), and for causal systems, the partial fractions would involve terms like A/(1 - a z^{-1}).

Wait, let me try expressing Y[z] as A/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) + B/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

So, let me set:

Y[z] = A/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) + B/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

Multiply both sides by (1 - (1/2) z^{-1})(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

So,

Y[z] * (1 - (1/2) z^{-1})(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}) ) = A (1 - (1/3) z^{-1}) + B (1 - (1/2) z^{-1}).

But Y[z] is z² / [ (z -1/2)(z -1/3) ) ].

Wait, perhaps I should express Y[z] in terms of negative exponents to make it easier.

Let me write Y[z] as:

Y[z] = z^2 / ( (z - 1/2
