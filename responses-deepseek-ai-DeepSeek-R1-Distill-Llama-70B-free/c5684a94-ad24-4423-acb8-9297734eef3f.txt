Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about social influence responses. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that social influence can lead to different types of responses. Let me think about what the main types are.

The question is asking to distinguish between three kinds of responses based on reward/punishment, need to know, and another factor. Wait, no, maybe the question is more about the specific types of responses rather than the bases. Oh wait, the options are about the three kinds, so I need to remember what each of them is called.

I think the three main responses are compliance, identification, and internalization. Compliance is when you do something because of external rewards or punishments. Like, you don't really believe in it, but you go along to avoid trouble or get a reward.

Identification is when you start to take on the values or behaviors because you like the group or want to be part of it. Maybe you agree with some aspects and want to associate, so you change your behavior to fit in more.

Internalization is deeper. You fully accept the beliefs as your own because they make sense to you and align with your values. This is more about genuine belief rather than just surface-level compliance.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C is Compliance, identification, and internalization. That sounds exactly right. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. Other options: Option A talks about Conformity, which I think is a broader term that might include these. But the question is about three specific responses. Option C matches what I remember from the textbook. Yeah, I'm pretty confident.

The correct answer is based on distinguishing between three responses to social influence: compliance, identification, and internalization. Compliance involves external rewards or punishments, identification is about associating with a group's values, and internalization is accepting beliefs as one's own. Option C matches these descriptions.

Answer: C
