Okay, so I've got this finance problem here about calculating the Net Present Value (NPV). Hmm, I remember that NPV is important for investment decisions. If the NPV is positive, the project is good to go, right?

Alright, the problem says there's a 10% discount rate. Cash inflows are $3,000 at the end of each year for five years. Oh, and the initial investment is $11,000. I need to find the NPV.

Wait, NPV formula... I think it's the sum of the present values of all cash flows minus the initial investment. Or is it just the present value of inflows minus the outflows? Oh right, because the initial investment is a cash outflow, so it's subtracted.

So the formula is NPV = PV of inflows - Initial Investment. But wait, calculating each cash flow's present value and then adding them up, then subtracting the initial outlay.

Each year's cash flow is the same, $3,000. That sounds like an annuity. Oh right, the present value of an ordinary annuity. I remember the formula for that is PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where PMT is the annual payment, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods.

So here, PMT is $3,000, r is 10% or 0.10, and n is 5 years. Let me plug in the numbers.

Calculating the present value factor first. 1 minus (1.10)^-5 divided by 0.10. Wait, what's (1.10)^-5? Let me compute that. 1.10^5 is about 1.61051, so reciprocal is roughly 0.62092. So 1 - 0.62092 is 0.37908. Divide that by 0.10 gives 3.7908. So the present value factor is approximately 3.7908.

Then multiply by the annual PMT: 3,000 * 3.7908 = let's see. 3,000 * 3 is 9,000, and 3,000 * 0.7908 is 2,372.4. So total is 11,372.4. So the present value of the inflows is about $11,372.40.

Now subtract the initial investment of $11,000. So 11,372.40 - 11,000 = $372.40. Hmm, that's a positive NPV, so the project is profitable.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option H is $370, which is close to my calculation. Why isn't it exactly 370? Maybe because I approximated the present value factor. Let me check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each year's present value and sum them up.

Year 1: 3,000 / 1.10 = ~2,727.27
Year 2: 3,000 / (1.10)^2 = 3,000 / 1.21 ≈ 2,479.34
Year 3: 3,000 / 1.331 ≈ 2,254.19
Year 4: 3,000 / 1.4641 ≈ 2,049.59
Year 5: 3,000 / 1.61051 ≈ 1,863.47

Adding them up: 2,727.27 + 2,479.34 = 5,206.61. Plus 2,254.19 = 7,460.80. Plus 2,049.59 = 9,510.39. Plus 1,863.47 gives 11,373.86.

So total PV is $11,373.86. Subtract initial investment of $11,000: 11,373.86 - 11,000 = 373.86. So around $374. The closest option is H: $370. But wait, maybe the present value factor was more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the annuity formula with more precise factors. Let me use the exact formula.

The annuity formula is 3,000 * [1 - (1 + 0.10)^-5]/0.10.

Calculating (1.10)^-5 exactly: Let's compute 1.1^5 first. 1.1^1=1.1, 1.1^2=1.21, 1.1^3=1.331, 1.1^4=1.4641, 1.1^5=1.61051. So 1/(1.61051)=0.6209213. So 1 - 0.6209213 = 0.3790787. Divided by 0.10 gives 3.790787.

So 3,000 * 3.790787 = 11,372.36. Subtract 11,000 gives 372.36. So approximately $372.36. So the closest option is H: $370.

Wait, but let me check the options. H is $370, which is $2.36 less than my calculation. Maybe the question used a slightly different discounting approach or rounded somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the individual years.

Wait, when I summed the individual present values, I got 11,373.86, which is 373.86, so $374. Hmmm. But the options don't have $374. So why is the option H $370 and option E is $1,100, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial investment. It's $11,000, right? So subtracting 11,000 from 11,372.36 gives 372.36, which would be approximately $370 if we're considering rounding to the nearest ten.

Alternatively, maybe the answer uses a different rounding approach. Or perhaps the problem expects the use of the present value of an annuity factor from a table, which might be slightly different. Let me think: the present value annuity factor for 10% over 5 years is indeed 3.7908.

Wait, maybe the options are approximated. So the correct answer is H: $370.

But let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: $11,370
B: -$370
C: $13,000
D: -$9,500
E: $1,100
F: $2,000
G: $11,000
H: $370
I: -$11,000
J: $4,000

So H is $370, which is very close to our calculated $372.36. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the initial investment is a cash outflow at time zero, and the inflows are at the end of each year. So the calculation is correct as I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the question subtracts the initial investment without considering the present value. Wait, no, that's not right. The initial investment is a cash outflow at time zero, so its present value is $11,000.

So yes, the NPV is approximately $372, so the closest option is H: $370.
</think>

To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV), we use the formula:

\[
\text{NPV} = \text{Present Value of Cash Inflows} - \text{Initial Investment}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Present Value of Cash Inflows
The cash inflows are an ordinary annuity of $3,000 per year for 5 years with a discount rate of 10%. The present value of an ordinary annuity is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{PV of Annuity} = \text{PMT} \times \left[\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\right]
\]

Where:
- \( \text{PMT} = 3,000 \)
- \( r = 0.10 \)
- \( n = 5 \)

First, calculate the present value annuity factor:

\[
\frac{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-5}}{0.10} = \frac{1 - 0.620921}{0.10} = 3.790787
\]

Now, multiply by the annual payment:

\[
\text{PV of Cash Inflows} = 3,000 \times 3.790787 = 11,372.36
\]

### Step 2: Subtract the Initial Investment
The initial investment is $11,000, which is a cash outflow at time zero. Thus:

\[
\text{NPV} = 11,372.36 - 11,000 = 372.36
\]

### Step 3: Match the Closest Option
The calculated NPV is approximately $372.36. Among the given options, the closest value is **$370**, which corresponds to option **H**.

### Final Answer
H
