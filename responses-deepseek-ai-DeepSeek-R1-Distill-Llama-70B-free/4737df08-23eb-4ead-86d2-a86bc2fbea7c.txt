Question:

The police received an anonymous tip informing them that a pharmacist was engaged in the illegal manufacture of synthetic cocaine. As part of its investigation, the police placed an electronic tracking device on the pharmacist's car. The tracking device was attached to the underbody of the pharmacist's car while it was parked outside his home. The police did not secure a warrant before installing the device. By means of the tracking device, the police were able to trail the pharmacist's movements. The police followed the pharmacist every day for almost a month. Finally, one day the police tracked the pharmacist's car to a vacant warehouse on the outskirts of town. While the pharmacist was inside the building, the police peered in the window and saw drug paraphernalia and equipment used in the manufacture of synthetic cocaine. Based on these observations, the police secured a search warrant and gained entry into the building. Once inside, the police arrested the pharmacist and confiscated a large quantity of synthetic cocaine that had just been produced. At his trial for illegal possession and manufacture of a controlled dangerous substance, the pharmacist moves to suppress the cocaine confiscated by the police. The pharmacist's motion will most likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the police acted in good faith when placing the tracking device.
B: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to track the pharmacist's movements.
C: granted, because the pharmacist had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his car.
D: granted, because the police did not have a warrant to place the tracking device on the pharmacist's car.
E: denied, because the police could have discovered the location of the warehouse simply by following the pharmacist's car.
F: denied, because the evidence would have inevitably been discovered.
G: denied, because the electronic surveillance of the pharmacist's car did not exceed 30 days.
H: granted, because the police invaded the pharmacist's privacy by peering into the warehouse window.
I: granted, because the information upon which the search warrant was based was illegally obtained by means of the tracking device.
J: granted, because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the pharmacist's motion to suppress the evidence will be granted or denied. Let me break it down step by step.

The situation is that the police received an anonymous tip that a pharmacist was making synthetic cocaine. They decided to investigate by placing an electronic tracking device on his car without getting a warrant. The car was parked outside his home when they attached the device. They tracked his movements for almost a month, which led them to a warehouse. There, they saw drug paraphernalia through the window, got a search warrant, and found the drugs.

The pharmacist is moving to suppress the evidence, so the question is whether the court will grant or deny that motion.

First, I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Warrantless searches are generally unreasonable unless an exception applies. So the key issue here is the placement of the tracking device without a warrant.

I think about the case law related to GPS tracking. There's a Supreme Court case, United States v. Jones, where they held that attaching a GPS device to a car and monitoring it constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. So the police needed a warrant to do that. Since the police didn't get a warrant here, that might make the tracking illegal.

But wait, maybe there's an exception. Like, maybe they had probable cause or reasonable suspicion. The anonymous tip might not be enough for probable cause. Tips from anonymous sources usually require some corroboration. Without more info, the police might not have had enough to justify a warrant, but in this case, they didn't even try to get one. So placing the GPS without a warrant was likely a Fourth Amendment violation.

Once the GPS was placed illegally, any evidence obtained from that tracking would be tainted. They tracked him to the warehouse. Without the GPS, they wouldn't have known where he was going. So when they looked through the window and saw the paraphernalia, that might be considered the fruit of an illegal search. Therefore, the warrant they got later might be invalid because it's based on tainted information.

But wait, there's also the concept of inevitable discovery. If the police could have found the warehouse another way, maybe the evidence isn't suppressed. But in this scenario, it doesn't seem like there's any indication that they would have found it without the GPS tracking. So that exception might not apply.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's denied because of good faith. I don't think the good faith exception applies here because attaching a GPS without a warrant is a clear constitutional violation as per Jones. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says denied because of reasonable suspicion. The police had an anonymous tip, but that alone doesn't usually establish reasonable suspicion without more. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C says granted because of expectation of privacy in the car. Well, in Jones, the issue was the car, and the Court said placing the GPS was a search. So C seems possible.

Option D says granted because no warrant for the tracking device. That seems correct because without a warrant, the tracking was illegal.

Option E says denied because police could have followed the car. But if the tracking was illegal, just following might not be an option. Plus, following every day for a month without a warrant might require more than just a tip.

Option F is about inevitable discovery. As I thought earlier, that doesn't seem applicable here.

Option G is about the duration of surveillance, but the Jones case didn't make the 30-day period the issue; it was more about the warrantless search.

Option H is about peering into the warehouse. But looking through an open window is usually not a search if the officer is lawfully present. However, if their presence was unlawful due to the GPS tracking, then maybe it's tainted. But H is focused on the peering, not the tracking.

Option I is about the warrant being based on illegal tracking. Yes, because the tracking was illegal, the warrant might be invalid as fruit of the poisonous tree.

Option J is about the seizure being fruit of an illegal search. That's also possible.

So the main issue is the warrantless tracking. So options C, D, I, J are in play.

In Jones, the Court said that placing the GPS was a search requiring a warrant. So the tracking was unconstitutional. Therefore, the information from the tracking (where he went) was obtained illegally. When the police used that info to get the warrant, the warrant was based on tainted evidence. So the warrant itself might be invalid.

Alternatively, if the police saw the paraphernalia through the window, perhaps that's a separate issue. But if they were only there because of the illegal tracking, then even that observation is tainted.

So the search warrant was based on the illegal tracking, making the warrant invalid. Therefore, the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options again:

Option I says the warrant was based on illegally obtained info (the tracking device). So I is correct.

Option D is about no warrant for the tracking. So both I and D are about the lack of warrant, but the suppression is about whether the evidence is tainted because of that.

Wait, but the tracking was the initial illegal act. The subsequent search warrant was based on observations made possible by that illegal tracking. So the warrant would be tainted, making any evidence obtained through it inadmissible.

So the correct reason is that the warrant was based on illegal info, which is option I.

Alternatively, option D says granted because no warrant for the tracking device. But the suppression is about the cocaine, which was found because of the warrant. So the chain of causation is that the illegal tracking led to the warrant, which led to the search. So both the tracking and the warrant are tainted.

So the options are either I or J. Option J says it's the fruit of an illegal search, which would be the tracking. So both I and J are possible.

Wait, the question is whether the motion to suppress the cocaine will be granted. So the issue is whether the cocaine is admissible.

The cocaine was found after the police used the tracking device, which led them to the warehouse, where they saw paraphernalia, and then got a warrant.

So the warrant's validity depends on whether the information in the warrant affidavit was tainted by the illegal tracking.

If the affidavit included where the car went (from the tracking), then the warrant was based on illegal info, making it invalid. So the evidence obtained via that warrant would be suppressed.

Alternatively, if the warrant was based on legally obtained info, like the police seeing the paraphernalia without needing the tracking, then it's okay. But in this case, the police only found the warehouse because of the tracking.

So the warrant was based on the illegal tracking, making the search warrant invalid. Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible.

So looking at the options, option I says the warrant was based on illegally obtained info. So that's correct.

But also, option J says it's the fruit of an illegal search. Because the tracking was a search, and the warrant was the fruit, so the seizure (cocaine) is the fruit.

So both I and J are possible. Hmm.

Wait, the initial illegal act is the placement of the tracking device (a search). The information from that (location of the warehouse) is used to get the warrant. So the warrant is tainted, making the search illegal, and thus the evidence is fruit of the illegal search.

So the suppression is because the evidence is the fruit of an illegal search (the GPS tracking).

So option J says it's suppressed as fruit of an illegal search.

Alternatively, option I says the warrant was based on illegal info, which is the same concept but framed differently.

So which option is correct? Let's think about the reasoning.

The key is that the tracking was a warrantless search, which was unconstitutional. The evidence (warehouse location) was obtained through that, making it inadmissible. Then, the warrant affidavit would include that evidence, so the warrant is invalid. Thus, the search pursuant to the warrant was illegal, and the cocaine is inadmissible.

So both I and J are pointing to the same issue but from different angles.

Looking back at the options:

Option I: granted because the information for the warrant was illegally obtained.

Option J: granted because it's fruit of an illegal search.

Which applies here? The illegal search was the GPS tracking. The information from that was used to get the warrant, so the warrant is invalid. Therefore, the search was illegal, making the evidence inadmissible.

So the reason is that the warrant was based on illegal info (I) or that the evidence is fruit of the GPS search (J).

I think both I and J could be correct, but which one is more precise?

Alternatively, perhaps the court would say that the tracking was an illegal search, and the evidence is the fruit of that, so J would be the reason.

Wait, in the case of the GPS, the placement was a search, but the use of the data is also part of the same issue. So the data (locations) were obtained via an illegal search, making them inadmissible. Then, when the police used that data to get the warrant, the warrant is invalid because it's based on illegal evidence.

So the warrant was obtained improperly, making the search and seizure illegal. So the reason is that the warrant was based on illegal info, which is option I.

Alternatively, the entire process is tainted, so the evidence is fruit of the initial illegal tracking, which is option J.

I'm a bit confused about which option is more accurate. Let me think about the exclusionary rule. The exclusionary rule prohibits the use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. So the GPS data was obtained in violation, and any evidence derived from it (like the warehouse location) is also excluded. So when the police applied for the warrant, they couldn't use that info, making the warrant invalid. Therefore, the subsequent search was illegal, and the evidence is excluded.

So the reason is that the warrant was based on illegally obtained info (I), or the evidence is fruit (J).

In terms of the answer options, both I and J seem relevant. But looking at the options again, which one is the correct reason.

Option I says the information was obtained by the tracking device. So the warrant was invalid.

Option J is about the evidence being the fruit of the illegal search (tracking).

Hmm. The tracking was the illegal search, and the evidence (cocaine) is the fruit of that. So J would be correct.

Alternatively, the warrant was based on the illegally obtained info, so I is correct.

Wait, the police used the tracking to find the warehouse, then looked through the window. If the police were inside the warehouse because of the tracking, then their observations inside would be tainted. But the act of looking through the window might be a separate issue.

Wait, when the police looked through the window, was that a search? If the window was open or the paraphernalia was in plain view, then it's not a search under the Fourth Amendment. But if they had to look in a way that invaded privacy, maybe it's a search. But in this case, it's a warehouse, and they were outside peering in. It's possible that this is considered a search if there was an expectation of privacy.

But perhaps that's a separate issue. The key point is that they were at the warehouse because of the illegal tracking. So even if the viewing wasn't a search, they wouldn't have been there without the tracking. So the warrant was based on the tracking data and the viewing, which might be tainted.

But maybe the viewing itself is a separate legal issue. Let me think: if the police were lawfully present at the warehouse, then looking through the window might be permissible. But if their presence was unlawful (because they were there due to the illegal tracking), then any evidence from that is also excluded.

So the motion to suppress would argue that all the evidence is tainted because it stems from the illegal tracking. Therefore, the warrant was invalid, and the search was illegal.

So which option is correct? The question is about the suppression of the cocaine. The cocaine was found because of the warrant which was based on the tracking.

So the suppression is because the evidence (cocaine) is the fruit of the illegal search (GPS tracking). So option J.

Alternatively, the warrant was based on info from the tracking, making it invalid, so option I.

I think the more accurate reason is option I because the warrant was obtained using illegally obtained information. So the warrant was invalid, making the search illegal.

But wait, in some cases, if the police can show that they would have discovered the evidence through a lawful means, the evidence isn't suppressed. But here, it's unclear if that applies.

In any case, the most direct reason is that the tracking was illegal, leading to the warrant being invalid, so the evidence is suppressed. So option I or J.

Wait, another approach is to look at the options:

Option I: granted because the info for the warrant was illegal.

Option J: granted because it's the fruit.

If the tracking was illegal, then the info from it can't be used. So the warrant affidavit likely included that the car went to the warehouse, which came from the tracking. So the warrant was invalid, making the search illegal. Therefore, option I is correct.

But some might argue that the evidence is the fruit of the illegal tracking, making option J correct.

I'm a bit stuck between I and J. But according to the Supreme Court in Jones, the placement of the GPS was a search, and the data obtained was inadmissible. Therefore, any evidence derived from that data (warehouse location) would be excluded. So the warrant was based on excluded evidence, making the search invalid. Therefore, the motion to suppress would be granted because the warrant was based on illegal info.

So the correct answer is I.

Wait, but the warrant was granted based on the observations of paraphernalia, not just the location. So maybe the warrant was based on both the tracking and the observation.

But the observation itself might be tainted because the police presence at the warehouse was due to the illegal tracking. So the observation is also tainted.

So the warrant would be based on tainted info, making it invalid.

So yes, option I is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the court would say that the police could have observed the paraphernalia without the tracking, making it admissible. But that's speculative.

In this scenario, the police only found the warehouse because of the tracking. So without the tracking, they wouldn't have known to look there. Therefore, the observation is tainted.

So the warrant was based on tainted info, making it invalid. So option I is correct.

But I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think again.

The GPS tracking was unconstitutional, so any evidence directly obtained from it (like the location) is inadmissible. Therefore, when the police used that location to get the warrant, the warrant is invalid. So the search was unlawful, and the evidence is suppressed.

So the reason is that the warrant was based on illegal info, which is option I.

Alternatively, the reason is that the evidence is the fruit of the illegal search, which is option J.

But the direct reason is the warrant was invalid due to the tainted info. So I think option I is the better answer.

Wait, but the initial illegal act was the tracking, and everything after is tainted. So the cocaine is the fruit of that, making option J correct.

Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the tracking was a search without a warrant, which was a constitutional violation. The evidence (warehouse location) was obtained through this violation, so any warrant based on that is invalid. Therefore, the search was illegal, and the evidence is suppressed because it's the fruit of the illegal search.

So the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, I could be wrong, and the correct answer is D, which is about the lack of a warrant for the tracking device.

Wait, option D says granted because no warrant for the tracking device. That's correct because the tracking was a search, and without a warrant, it's illegal. So the initial placement was illegal, leading to the suppression.

But the question is about the suppression of the cocaine, which was found after the warrant. So the motion is about whether the cocaine is admissible.

So the chain is: illegal tracking -> location of warehouse -> warrant based on that info -> search -> seizure of cocaine.

So the cocaine is being suppressed because it's the fruit of the illegal tracking. Therefore, option J is correct.

Alternatively, some might argue that the warrant was obtained, so even if the tracking was illegal, the warrant could cure it. But that's not the case if the warrant was based on tainted info.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is J: granted because the seizure is the fruit of an illegal search.

The question revolves around whether the pharmacist's motion to suppress the evidence (cocaine) will be granted or denied, focusing on the legality of the police's actions. The police placed a GPS tracking device on the pharmacist's car without a warrant, tracked his movements for nearly a month, and used the information to locate a warehouse. They then observed drug paraphernalia through the window, obtained a search warrant, and seized the cocaine. The key issue is whether the evidence is admissible, given that the GPS tracking was conducted without a warrant.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fourth Amendment and GPS Tracking**: Under the Supreme Court's decision in *United States v. Jones*, attaching a GPS device to a vehicle and monitoring its movements constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. A warrant is required unless an exception applies. Here, the police did not secure a warrant, making the tracking unconstitutional.

2. **Chain of Causation**: The GPS tracking provided the police with the location of the warehouse. Without this illegally obtained information, the police would not have discovered the warehouse, observed the paraphernalia, or obtained the search warrant. The warrant was therefore tainted by the illegal tracking.

3. **Exclusionary Rule**: Evidence obtained directly or indirectly from an unconstitutional search is inadmissible under the exclusionary rule. The cocaine was the fruit of the illegal GPS tracking, as the tracking led to the warehouse, the observations, and the warrant.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The "good faith" exception does not apply because the police's actions (placing a GPS without a warrant) are a clear constitutional violation as established in *Jones*.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. An anonymous tip, without corroboration, does not establish reasonable suspicion or probable cause to justify warrantless tracking.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. While the pharmacist had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his car, the issue is not the expectation of privacy but the unconstitutional search (GPS tracking).
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. Although the lack of a warrant for the GPS tracking is a violation, the question focuses on the suppression of the cocaine, which is a downstream consequence of the illegal tracking.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The police could not have lawfully followed the car for nearly a month without a warrant or reasonable suspicion.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The doctrine of inevitable discovery does not apply here, as there is no evidence that the police would have discovered the warehouse through lawful means.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The duration of the surveillance is irrelevant; the issue is the lack of a warrant.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The issue is not the act of peering into the warehouse but how the police came to be there in the first place (illegal tracking).
