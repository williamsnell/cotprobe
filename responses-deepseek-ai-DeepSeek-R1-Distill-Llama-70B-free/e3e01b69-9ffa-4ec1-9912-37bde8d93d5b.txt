Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about regression models, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a regression model that predicts the frequency of tantrums. The predictors are three things: (a) effectiveness of parental commands, (b) consistency of parental discipline, and (c) parental warmth. I need to figure out what the model's structure looks like in terms of coefficients and intercepts.

Hmm, I remember that in regression models, each predictor variable gets its own regression coefficient. That coefficient represents the change in the outcome variable for each unit change in the predictor, holding other variables constant. So if there are three predictors, like in this case, there should be three coefficients. Each one shows the effect of each individual factor.

Wait, but what about the y-intercept? The y-intercept is the value of the outcome when all the predictors are zero. So in a multiple regression model, there's usually just one y-intercept, right? Because it's the baseline value when none of the predictors are present or active. So that would mean one intercept.

So putting that together, the model would have three regression coefficients (one for each predictor) and one y-intercept. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, option E says "One y-intercept and three regression coefficients." That matches what I was thinking. Let me double-check.

Option E: One y-intercept and three regression coefficients. Yes, that makes sense because each of the three variables (a, b, c) adds a coefficient, and the model has a single intercept term.

I don't think any other options fit. For example, option A has one coefficient but three intercepts, which doesn't make sense because the intercept is a single value. Similarly, option J has two coefficients, which would only account for two predictors, but we have three here. So option E must be the right answer.

The question involves a regression model predicting the frequency of tantrums based on three predictors: effectiveness of parental commands, consistency of parental discipline, and parental warmth. In a regression model, each predictor variable is associated with a unique regression coefficient, which represents the effect of that variable on the outcome, holding other variables constant. Since there are three predictors, the model will have three regression coefficients. Additionally, the y-intercept represents the baseline value of the outcome when all predictors are zero, and there is typically only one y-intercept in such a model.

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is the one that specifies one y-intercept and three regression coefficients. This matches option E.
