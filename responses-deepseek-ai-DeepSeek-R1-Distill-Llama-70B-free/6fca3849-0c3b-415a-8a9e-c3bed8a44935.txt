Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about gases and their properties, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me data for three gases, A, B, and C. Each has two values: a in liters²·atm/mole and b in liters/mole. I remember that these a and b terms are from the Van der Waals equation, which is used to describe the behavior of real gases. The equation is [P + a(n/V)^2](V/n - b) = RT. 

So, part (a) asks which gas has the highest critical temperature. I recall that the critical temperature (Tc) is related to the a and b constants. The formula for Tc is (8a)/(27Rb), where R is the gas constant. Since R is a constant for all gases, the critical temperature depends on the ratio a/(b). 

Looking at the data:

Gas A: a=4.0, b=0.027
Gas B: a=12.0, b=0.030
Gas C: a=6.0, b=0.032

I need to calculate a/(b) for each.

For A: 4.0 / 0.027 ≈ 148.15
For B: 12.0 / 0.030 = 400
For C: 6.0 / 0.032 ≈ 187.5

So, Gas B has the highest a/b ratio, which means it has the highest critical temperature. So (a) is Gas B.

Next, part (b) is about the largest molecular volume. I'm trying to remember what the b term represents. Oh right, the 'b' in Van der Waals equation accounts for the volume excluded by the gas molecules themselves. So a larger 'b' means the molecules take up more space, implying a larger molecular volume. 

Looking at the 'b' values:

Gas A: 0.027
Gas B: 0.030
Gas C: 0.032

Gas C has the highest b, so its molecular volume is the largest. So (b) is Gas C.

Now, part (c) asks which gas exhibits the most ideal behavior around STP (standard temperature and pressure). I remember that a gas behaves more ideally when the intermolecular forces are weak, and the molecules are small. 

The 'a' term in Van der Waals is related to the attraction between molecules. A smaller 'a' means weaker intermolecular forces, so the gas behaves more ideally. Also, a smaller 'b' means the molecules are smaller, which also contributes to more ideal behavior.

So looking at both 'a' and 'b' for each gas:

Gas A: a=4.0 (smallest a), b=0.027 (smallest b)
Gas B: a=12.0 (largest a), b=0.030 (medium)
Gas C: a=6.0 (medium), b=0.032 (largest)

Since Gas A has the smallest a and the smallest b, it should behave the most ideally. So (c) is Gas A.

Now, piecing it together:

(a) Gas B
(b) Gas C
(c) Gas A

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option B says: (a) Gas B, (b) Gas C, (c) Gas A. That's exactly what I concluded.

Wait, let me double-check the options. The options are labeled A through F.

Looking again at the options in the question:

Option B: Gas B has highest Tc, Gas C largest volume, Gas A most ideal.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the properties of the gases, we analyze the given data using the Van der Waals equation constants \(a\) and \(b\):

1. **Critical Temperature (\(T_c\)):**  
   The critical temperature is proportional to \(\frac{a}{b}\). Calculating this ratio:  
   - Gas A: \(\frac{4.0}{0.027} \approx 148.15\)  
   - Gas B: \(\frac{12.0}{0.030} = 400\)  
   - Gas C: \(\frac{6.0}{0.032} \approx 187.5\)  
   Gas B has the highest \(\frac{a}{b}\), so it has the highest critical temperature.

2. **Largest Molecular Volume (\(b\)):**  
   The \(b\) term represents the volume excluded by the gas molecules. Comparing the \(b\) values:  
   - Gas A: \(b = 0.027\)  
   - Gas B: \(b = 0.030\)  
   - Gas C: \(b = 0.032\)  
   Gas C has the largest \(b\), so it has the largest molecular volume.

3. **Most Ideal Behavior Around STP:**  
   A gas behaves more ideally when intermolecular forces (related to \(a\)) are weaker and molecular size (related to \(b\)) is smaller. Gas A has the smallest \(a\) and \(b\), making it the most ideal around STP.

**Conclusion:**  
- (a) Gas B has the highest critical temperature.  
- (b) Gas C has the largest molecular volume.  
- (c) Gas A exhibits the most ideal behavior around STP.  

This matches **Option B**.
