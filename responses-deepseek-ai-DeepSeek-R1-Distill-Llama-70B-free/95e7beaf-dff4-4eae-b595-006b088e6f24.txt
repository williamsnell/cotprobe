Okay, so I've got this question about fascism as an economic system, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about fascism and its economic policies.

From what I remember, fascism is a political ideology that emphasizes authoritarian nationalism. But the question is specifically about its economic system. I think under fascism, the government plays a significant role in controlling the economy, but it's not the same as socialism or communism.

Wait, in socialism, the state owns the means of production, right? Like in a communist system, they aim for no private ownership. But fascism, I think, doesn't go that far. Instead, it allows private enterprise to exist but under strict government control. So the state doesn't own everything, but it regulates and directs the economy to serve national interests.

I remember reading that fascist economies are capitalist in nature but with a lot of state intervention. So private businesses still operate, but the government has a strong hand in guiding them, maybe through regulations, quotas, or national goals. This way, the economy serves the state's objectives, like military buildup or achieving autarky.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one.

Option A says fascism promotes a mixed economy with some state ownership and private enterprise. That sounds a bit like what I'm thinking, but I'm not sure if state ownership is a key part. I thought fascism doesn't necessarily mean the state owns production, just controls it.

Option B says it's like communism with complete state ownership. That doesn't seem right because fascism isn't about abolishing private property; it's more about control rather than ownership.

Option C states that fascism retains capitalist institutions but subjects them to extensive government control. That aligns with what I was thinking. Private enterprise exists, but the government tightly regulates and directs the economy.

Option D talks about worker collectives owning the means of production. That sounds more like anarchism or socialism, not fascism.

Option E suggests laissez-faire with minimal intervention. That's the opposite of fascism, which is highly interventionist.

Option F says it's purely capitalist, but I think that's not accurate because fascism involves a lot more state control than pure capitalism.

Option G is about anarchy without government control, which is definitely not fascism.

Option H mentions free trade and open markets. I think fascism tends to be more protectionist, aiming for self-sufficiency, so this doesn't fit.

Option I is about universal basic income and wealth redistribution, which I don't associate with fascism. They were more about national unity and less about economic equality in that sense.

Option J says it's a form of socialist economy, but socialism typically involves more state or collective ownership, which fascism doesn't do.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be Option C. It describes fascism as retaining capitalist structures but with extensive government control, which fits what I remember about how fascist economies function.

The correct answer is C. Fascism retains the institutional forms of a capitalist economy while subjecting these institutions to extensive control and regulation by the government. This aligns with the understanding that fascism allows private enterprise to exist but under strict state direction to serve national interests.

Answer: C
