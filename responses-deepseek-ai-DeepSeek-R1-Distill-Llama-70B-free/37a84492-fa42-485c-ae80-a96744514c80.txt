Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer. Hmm, I need to find the final temperature when a copper block is placed into water. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says a 100 g copper block is heated to 95°C. Then it's quickly put into 1000 g of water at 20°C. The container is made of copper too, with a mass of 700 g, and there's a copper paddle of 50 g. They stir until the temperature stabilizes. I need to find that final temperature.

Wait, right, this is a heat transfer problem. The basic idea is that the heat lost by the copper block will be equal to the heat gained by the water and the container and paddle, I think. Oh wait, but copper is a good conductor, so maybe the container and paddle will also exchange heat. But since the block is the only thing being heated initially, the heat should flow from the block to the water and the copper parts.

So the formula I remember is Q = m * c * ΔT, where Q is the heat, m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

But wait, the copper block is losing heat, so its Q will be negative, while the water, container, and paddle are gaining heat, so their Qs will be positive. So the sum of all heats should be zero, right? So:

Q_copper_block + Q_water + Q_container + Q_paddle = 0

But wait, wait. The copper block is initially at higher temperature than the water. When it's placed into the water, heat will flow from the block to the water and the copper container and paddle, until thermal equilibrium is reached. So the final temperature is somewhere between the initial temps.

I need to find the specific heat capacities for copper and water. Oh, the problem gives s_cu as 0.095, but wait, usually specific heat capacity is in J/(g°C) or similar. So for copper, c_cu is 0.095, and for water, I remember it's about 4.184 J/(g°C). Let me make sure I get the units right.

So the mass of the copper block is 100 g. The container is 700 g copper, and the paddle is 50 g copper. So the total mass of copper (apart from the block) is 700 +50 = 750 g.

The water is 1000 g.

So when the block cools down, its temperature drops from 95°C to the final temp Tf. The water and the copper container and paddle will all rise from 20°C to Tf.

So the heat lost by the block is Q_block = m_block * c_cu * (T_initial_block - Tf)

The heat gained by the water is Q_water = m_water * c_water * (Tf - T_initial_water)

The heat gained by the container and paddle is Q_cu_container_paddle = m_cu_container_paddle * c_cu * (Tf - T_initial_water)

Wait, because the container and paddle are initially at the same temperature as the water, 20°C, right? So their change is Tf - 20.

So putting it all together:

m_block * c_cu * (95 - Tf) = m_water * c_water * (Tf -20) + m_cu_container_paddle * c_cu * (Tf -20)

Wait, because the block is losing heat, so it's positive on the right side because the others are gaining. So I think I got the signs right.

Now plug in the numbers.

m_block = 100 g
c_cu = 0.095 J/(g°C) (I think that's the unit, but sometimes it's per kg, but the problem gives it as 0.095, which is likely in J/g°C because for metals it's lower than water's 4.184, and copper's specific heat is about 0.385 J/g°C. Wait, wait, wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The specific heat of copper is around 0.385 J/g°C. But the problem states s_cu is 0.095, which is much lower. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I read the problem correctly? Oh wait, the problem says s_cu is 0.095. So maybe it's in different units, perhaps calories? Or perhaps a typo. But assuming the problem's value is correct, I'll proceed.

So c_cu is 0.095, and c_water is 4.184.

So:

100 g * 0.095 J/g°C * (95 - Tf) = 1000 g * 4.184 J/g°C * (Tf -20) + (700 +50) g * 0.095 J/g°C * (Tf -20)

Simplify this equation.

Left side: 100 * 0.095 * (95 - Tf) = 9.5 * (95 - Tf) = 902.5 - 9.5 Tf

Right side: 1000 *4.184*(Tf-20) + 750 *0.095*(Tf-20)

Compute each term.

1000*4.184 = 4184, so 4184*(Tf-20) = 4184 Tf - 83680

750 *0.095 = 71.25, so 71.25*(Tf-20) =71.25 Tf -1425

So right side is (4184 Tf -83680) + (71.25 Tf -1425) = (4184 +71.25) Tf - (83680 +1425) = 4255.25 Tf - 85105

Putting it all together:

Left side: 902.5 -9.5 Tf = Right side: 4255.25 Tf -85105

Bring all terms to one side.

902.5 -9.5 Tf -4255.25 Tf +85105 =0

Wait, no, actually, let's move everything to the left:

902.5 -9.5 Tf = 4255.25 Tf -85105

Bring all terms to the left:

902.5 +85105 = 4255.25 Tf +9.5 Tf

So 902.5 +85105 = 8405.25 Tf ?

Wait wait, no, 4255.25 +9.5 is 4264.75, not 8405. Let me compute 4255.25 +9.5.

4255.25 +9.5 = 4264.75

Wait, wait, 4255.25 +9.5 = 4264.75? Let me add: 4255.25 +9 is 4264.25, then +0.5 is 4264.75, yes.

So 902.5 +85105 equals 86007.5 (because 85105 +900 is 86005, plus 2.5 is 86007.5).

So:

86007.5 = 4264.75 * Tf

So Tf = 86007.5 / 4264.75 ≈ let's calculate that.

Let me compute 86007.5 /4264.75.

Hmm. Let's see, 4264.75 * 20 = 85297.5. Because 4264.75 *20=85,295? Wait, 4264.75 *20 is 85,295? Wait, 4264.75 *20 = 4264.75 *2 *10. 4264.75 *2 is 8529.5, times 10 is 85295. So 20 times is 85295.

But our numerator is 86007.5, which is 712.5 higher than 85295.

So 712.5 /4264.75 ≈ 0.1669 (since 4264.75 *0.166 is about 4264.75 * (1/6) ≈ 710. So 0.1669 would be 712.5).

So Tf ≈20 + 0.1669 ≈20.1669°C? That would be about 20.17°C. But looking at the options, the closest is option D:20.6, or G:21.4, etc. Hmm, but that's not matching. So maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me go back.

The equation is:

Heat lost by copper block = heat gained by water + heat gained by copper container and paddle.

Which is:

m_block * c_cu * (T_initial_block - Tf) = m_water * c_water * (Tf - T_initial_water) + m_cu_container_paddle * c_cu * (Tf - T_initial_water)

Wait, but wait, the container and paddle are initially at 20°C, same as the water. So their temp change is Tf -20, correct.

So putting the numbers:

100 g * 0.095 (95 - Tf) = 1000 *4.184 (Tf-20) + 750 *0.095 (Tf-20)

Let me compute each part again.

Left side: 100 *0.095 =9.5, so 9.5*(95-Tf) = 902.5 -9.5 Tf

Right side:

1000*4.184 =4184, so 4184*(Tf-20) =4184 Tf -83680

750 *0.095 =71.25, so 71.25*(Tf -20) =71.25 Tf -1425

Total right side: (4184 Tf +71.25 Tf) - (83680 +1425) =4255.25 Tf -85105

So equation:

902.5 -9.5 Tf =4255.25 Tf -85105

Bring all terms to left:

902.5 -9.5 Tf -4255.25 Tf +85105 =0

Combine like terms:

(902.5 +85105) + (-9.5 -4255.25) Tf =0

So 86007.5 -4264.75 Tf =0

Thus,

4264.75 Tf =86007.5

Tf =86007.5 /4264.75 ≈ let me compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 86007.5 divided by 4264.75.

First, approximate 4264.75 * 20 =85295 as before.

Subtract: 86007.5 -85295=712.5

So 712.5 /4264.75 ≈0.167.

So Tf=20 +0.167 ≈20.167°C, approximately 20.17°C.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D:20.6°C, or G:21.4°C, or H:22.5, etc. Hmm, none of them is 20.17, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the specific heat of copper. The problem says s_cu is 0.095. But wait, the standard specific heat of copper is around 0.385 J/g°C. If the problem states 0.095, that's way too low. Maybe it's 0.095 cal/(g°C)? Because 1 calorie is about 4.184 J, so 0.095 cal/(g°C) would be 0.095 *4.184 ≈ 0.397 J/g°C, which is close to copper's actual specific heat. So perhaps the problem uses calories instead of J.

If that's the case, I need to adjust my calculations.

Wait, the problem states s_cu=0.095. Let me check units. The question says "s_cu= .095", without units. But in the context of physics problems, it's common to use J, but sometimes calories are used. Hmm.

If s_cu is 0.095 cal/(g°C), then converting to J, it's 0.095 *4.184 ≈0.397 J/g°C. That makes sense for copper.

So perhaps I should use c_cu =0.397 J/g°C, not 0.095. Because 0.095 J/g°C would be way too low, leading to a final temp around 20.17, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake by using 0.095 as J.

So let's redo the calculation with c_cu =0.397 J/g°C.

Wait, but the problem gives s_cu=0.095. If the question uses c in cal/(g°C), then I have to adjust. Let me clarify:

Assuming that s_cu is given in cal/(g°C), so 0.095 cal/(g°C). Since 1 cal=4.184 J, then c_cu =0.095 *4.184 ≈0.397 J/g°C.

But wait, the specific heat of water is 1 cal/(g°C) which is 4.184 J/g°C. So in this case, the units would be consistent if I convert everything to cal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses c in J, but it's a typo, and the correct value is 0.385 or similar.

Wait, but the problem explicitly gives s_cu=0.095, so I have to use that. Maybe it's in J/g°C, but that's lower than it should be. Hmm, but perhaps it's correct as given. So let me proceed again with 0.095 J/g°C and see.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recompute the numbers.

So, equation:

100 *0.095*(95-Tf) = 4184*(Tf-20) +71.25*(Tf-20)

Wait, 100 *0.095 =9.5

So 9.5*(95-Tf) = (4184 +71.25)*(Tf-20)

Wait, 4184 +71.25=4255.25

So 9.5*(95-Tf) =4255.25*(Tf-20)

Compute left side: 9.5*95=902.5; 9.5*(-Tf)= -9.5 Tf. So left is 902.5 -9.5 Tf.

Right side: 4255.25 Tf - 4255.25 *20 =4255.25 Tf -85105

So equation:

902.5 -9.5 Tf =4255.25 Tf -85105

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

902.5 +85105 =4255.25 Tf +9.5 Tf

So 86007.5 =4264.75 Tf

Tf=86007.5 /4264.75 ≈ let's compute this exactly.

Compute 4264.75 × 20 =85295, as before.

Subtract from 86007.5: 86007.5 -85295=712.5

So 712.5 /4264.75 = approx 0.1669.

So Tf=20 +0.1669≈20.1669 °C, which is about 20.17°C.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D:20.6°C, but that's higher. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, perhaps the container and paddle are made of copper, so they are in contact with the water and the block. But if the block is copper, and the container is copper, perhaps the heat transfer includes both the block and the container. Wait, but in the setup, the block is the only thing being heated. So the initial heat is only in the block. The container and paddle start at 20°C.

Alternatively, perhaps the container and paddle are part of the surroundings, so their heat capacity adds to the water's.

Wait, but the equation seems correct. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the right side. Let me compute 4184*(Tf-20) +71.25*(Tf-20) = (4184+71.25)(Tf-20) =4255.25*(Tf-20). Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the arithmetic again for 86007.5 /4264.75.

Let me compute 4264.75 ×20=85295.

So 20 ×4264.75=85295. So 85295 + 4264.75 = 89559.75 (which is 21 ×4264.75).

Wait, but 4264.75 ×20.1666667=?

Alternatively, perhaps I can do the division more accurately.

86007.5 ÷4264.75.

Let me compute step by step.

How many times does 4264.75 go into 86007.5.

Well, 4264.75 ×20=85295, as before.

Now, 86007.5 -85295 =712.5.

So 712.5 ÷4264.75 = approx 0.1669.

So Tf=20 +0.1669=20.1669°C≈20.17°C.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I messed up the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have included the container and paddle as part of the copper block's mass. No, because the block is 100g, and the container and paddle are separate. So each has their own heat capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the container and paddle to be at the same initial temperature as the block. No, the block is at 95°C, the container and paddle are at 20°C. So no, they can’t be considered as part of the block.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat of water. Oh wait, I took it as 4.184 J/g°C, which is correct. So that's not the issue.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects me to ignore the container and paddle? But that doesn't make sense, because they’re part of the system.

Wait, the question says "copper container whose mass is 700 g. It is stirred with a copper paddle of mass 50 g until the temperature of the water rises to a steady final value." So the container and paddle are part of the system. So their heat capacities must be considered.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Compute 86007.5 ÷4264.75.

Well, 4264.75 ×20=85295. So 20 times gives 85295. Subtract that from 86007.5: 712.5. So 712.5 ÷4264.75 ≈ 0.1669.

So Tf ≈20.1669°C, about 20.17°C. No option matches that.

Wait, looking at the options:

A:23.3, B:26.1, C:25.9, D:20.6, E:17.5, F:24.7, G:21.4, H:22.5
