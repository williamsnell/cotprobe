Okay, so I've got this problem here about Punk Magazine's ad pricing. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that Punk Magazine has a circulation of 2,000,000, and they charge $20,000 for a full-page ad. I need to find the cost per thousand for a single ad. Hmm, I think I remember that cost per thousand (CPM) is a common advertising metric, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact calculation.

Wait, right, CPM stands for cost per mille, which is Latin for a thousand. So it's the cost to reach a thousand people. The formula, I believe, is to take the cost of the ad and divide it by the total circulation, then multiply by 1,000. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Oh yeah, the formula should be: CPM = (Cost of Ad / Circulation) * 1000. Because you're finding out how much it costs to reach each thousand people. So plugging in the numbers here, the cost is $20,000, and the circulation is 2,000,000.

So let's do the math. 20,000 divided by 2,000,000. Let me calculate that. 20,000 divided by 2,000,000 is 0.01. Because 2,000,000 is 2 million, and 20,000 is 20 thousand. So 20,000 / 2,000,000 equals 0.01. 

Then, multiply that by 1,000 to get the cost per thousand. So 0.01 times 1,000 is 10. So the CPM would be $10. 

Wait, let me double-check that. So if the magazine reaches 2 million people, and the ad costs $20k, then for each thousand people, it's $10. Because 2 million is 2,000 thousands. So $20k divided by 2,000 is $10 per thousand. Yeah, that makes sense. 

Looking back at the options, option F is $10. So the answer should be F.

The cost per thousand (CPM) for a single ad is calculated by dividing the cost of the ad by the circulation and then multiplying by 1,000. 

Using the given values:
- Cost of the ad = $20,000
- Circulation = 2,000,000

CPM = (20,000 / 2,000,000) * 1,000 = 10.

Thus, the cost per thousand for a single ad is $10.
