Question:

Proteins were shown to move about in a plane of the plasma membrane when mouse cellsurface proteins and human cell-surface proteins were observed to integrate along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. Which of the following cell culture techniques was most likely employed in order to yield these results?

Options:

A: Inserting a bacterial plasmid into a mammalian cell
B: Producing a hybrid cell
C: Injecting a fluorescent marker into the cell membrane
D: Producing a heterokaryon
E: Isolating an immortal variant cell from culture and using it to create a cell line
F: Inserting a tumor-inducing virus into a normal cell to initiate transformation
G: Using a method called cell fusion to combine the mouse and human cells
H: Using a technique called transfection to insert new genes
I: Using a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer
J: Inducing pluripotency in somatic cells to create stem cells

Okay, so I've got this question about cell culture techniques and an experiment involving mouse and human cell surface proteins. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that proteins were moving in the plasma membrane after fusing mouse and human cells. They observed that the proteins integrated along the fused membrane. So, I think this is about cell fusion or something like that.

Wait, what's the context here? I remember something about the fluid mosaic model, which shows that membrane proteins can move. Oh right, the experiment where mouse and human cells were fused, and their surface proteins mixed. That was done by someone, maybe Singer and Nicolson? Or was it more recent?

The technique used must involve combining two different cells into one. So, the options are about cell culture techniques. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Inserting a bacterial plasmid into a mammalian cell. That's probably transfection, but that's about adding genes, not fusing cells.

Option B: Producing a hybrid cell. Hybrid cells are made by fusing two different cells, like mouse and human. But wait, is this the same as cell fusion? Or is it a specific type?

Option C: Injecting a fluorescent marker into the cell membrane. That sounds like labeling, maybe tracking movement, but not the fusion itself.

Option D: Producing a heterokaryon. Heterokaryon is a cell with nuclei from two different species, but the cytoplasm is mixed. Wait, but when cells fuse, the cytoplasm and everything mixes. So when you fuse, you get a heterokaryon if the nuclei remain separate.

Option G: Using cell fusion. That sounds like the actual process. So fusing cells to make them combine.

Wait, so the question is about observing the movement of proteins in the fused cell membrane. So the technique would have been to fuse the cells together.

So looking again, the correct technique is cell fusion. So the answer is G?

But wait, option B is producing a hybrid cell. Isn't that the result of cell fusion? So which option is correct?

Alternatively, D is producing a heterokaryon. So when you fuse two cells, you first get a heterokaryon before the nuclei fuse. But maybe in this case, the nuclei didn't fuse, so the cell is a heterokaryon, but the membrane proteins mixed.

Wait, the question is about observing the movement of proteins in the plasma membrane, which happens even before the nuclei fuse. So the technique used would be cell fusion, which leads to a heterokaryon.

So option D is producing a heterokaryon, which is the result of cell fusion (option G). So which is more correct?

Wait, the question asks which technique was employed. So the method is cell fusion, which is option G.

Wait, but let's check the options again. Option B is producing a hybrid cell. Hybrid cells can be the end result, but perhaps that's a broader term. However, I think that cell fusion is the technique used to achieve this. So the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, option D, producing a heterokaryon is the immediate result of fusing cells. But the question is about the technique, not the result.

So the technique is cell fusion, which is G.

The question involves identifying the cell culture technique used to observe the movement of mouse and human cell-surface proteins in a fused plasma membrane. This experiment demonstrates the fluid mosaic model, where membrane proteins can mix and move freely after cell fusion. The key is to determine the technique that enables this fusion.

- **Option A** involves inserting a plasmid into a cell, which is unrelated to cell fusion.
- **Option B** refers to producing a hybrid cell, which is a result of cell fusion but not the technique itself.
- **Option C** involves labeling with fluorescent markers, which is a method for tracking proteins but not for fusing cells.
- **Option D** refers to producing a heterokaryon, which is an intermediate state after cell fusion where nuclei remain separate, but this is not the technique.
- **Option G** directly refers to cell fusion, the technique used to combine mouse and human cells, allowing the observation of protein movement in the fused membrane.

The correct answer is **G**, as cell fusion is the technique that enables the experiment described.

Answer: G
