Okay, so I've got this question about nearsightedness, and I need to figure it out. Let me think about what I remember from biology class.

Nearsightedness is also called myopia, right? From what I learned, it's when someone can see things clearly up close but has trouble seeing things that are far away. Like, they can read a book fine, but a sign on the other side of the road is all blurry.

I remember that the eye has a few key parts involved in focusing: the cornea, the lens, the retina, and so on. The cornea is the clear part at the front, and it helps bend the light entering the eye. Then there's the lens inside, which changes shape to focus on objects at different distances.

So, when light enters the eye, it's supposed to focus exactly on the retina, which is at the back. But in myopia, I think the eye is a bit too long from front to back. That makes the light focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Or maybe the cornea is too curved, which causes the light to bend more than it should.

Wait, the shape of the cornea and lens affects how much the light bends. If the cornea is too curved, the light bends too much, right? So the focal point is shorter. That would make the image land before it gets to the retina, making distant objects blurry.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one says too much curvature of the cornea and lens. Let me go through the choices:

Option A: Too little curvature of cornea and lens. Hmm, if there's too little, maybe the light doesn't bend enough, leading to hyperopia (farsightedness), not myopia.

Option B: Too much curvature of retina and lens. Wait, the retina doesn't really curve in that sense. The retina is where the light hits. So maybe this isn't right.

Option C: Too much curvature of cornea and lens. Yeah, this sounds familiar. More curvature means more bending, so the light focuses too soon.

Option D: Too much curvature of iris and cornea. The iris controls the amount of light entering by adjusting the pupil, but I don't think its curvature affects the focus. So probably not this.

Option E: Incorrect alignment of cornea and retina. Alignment issues might be about how the eye is structured, but I think curvature is the key here.

Option F: Incorrect alignment of cornea and lens. Not sure about that. The cornea and lens are both part of the focusing system, but incorrect alignment doesn't sound like the main cause.

Option G: Too much curvature of iris and lens. Again, the iris's curvature might not be the main factor. It's more about the cornea and lens.

Option H: Incorrect alignment of iris and lens. Doesn't seem right, since the lens is positioned behind the iris. Their alignment might not cause myopia.

Option I: Too little curvature of iris and lens. If it's too little, maybe not enough bending, so perhaps hyperopia.

Option J: Too little curvature of retina and lens. Retina curvature is part of the structure, but I don't think that's the issue. It's more about the cornea and lens.

So the correct answer is probably option C: too much curvature of the cornea and lens. That causes light to focus too early, leading to nearsightedness.

Nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when light entering the eye focuses in front of the retina rather than directly on it. This is typically due to the eye being too long from front to back or having excessive curvature of the cornea and lens. Excessive curvature of the cornea and lens causes light to bend too much, resulting in a shorter focal point. This leads to distant objects appearing blurry while close objects remain clear.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Too little curvature would result in light not bending enough, likely causing hyperopia (farsightedness), not myopia.
- **B**: The retina does not have curvature in this context, so this is incorrect.
- **C**: Correct. Excessive curvature of the cornea and lens causes light to focus too early, leading to myopia.
- **D**: The iris's curvature is not a factor in focusing; it regulates light entry.
- **E**: Incorrect alignment of cornea and retina is not the primary cause of myopia.
- **F**: Incorrect alignment of cornea and lens is unrelated to the curvature issue causing myopia.
- **G**: The iris's curvature is not relevant to the focusing mechanism.
- **H**: Incorrect alignment of iris and lens is not a cause of myopia.
- **I**: Too little curvature of iris and lens would likely lead to hyperopia.
- **J**: The retina's curvature is not the issue; it is where the light should focus.

The correct answer is **C: too much curvature of the cornea and lens**.
