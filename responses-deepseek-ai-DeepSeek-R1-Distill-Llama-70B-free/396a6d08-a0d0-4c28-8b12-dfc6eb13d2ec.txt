Okay, so I've got this question about learned helplessness. Hmm, I remember that learned helplessness is a concept in psychology where a person or animal learns that their actions don't affect the outcome, leading to a sense of helplessness. Classic experiment was with dogs, right? They were given shocks they couldn't escape, so later when they could, they didn't even try.

The question is about a study where giving solvable problems eliminated the helplessness from unsolvable ones. So the key here is understanding why solvable problems helped. I think it's about the individual realizing that their actions can make a difference again, breaking the learned helplessness.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Shift in locus of control from internal to external. Wait, locus of control is about whether you think your outcomes are due to your actions (internal) or outside factors (external). If someone shifts from internal to external, that would mean they think their actions don't matter, which would worsen helplessness. But the question is about eliminating helplessness, so maybe the opposite. Not sure yet.

Option B: Reduction in stress. Solvable problems might make them less stressed, but does that explain the elimination of helplessness? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Stress reduction could be a factor but not the main reason.

Option C: Continuous reinforcement schedule. That's a psychology term where every correct response is rewarded. I don't think this is directly related to learned helplessness. More about operant conditioning.

Option D: Practice effect. Maybe they get better at solving problems, but that doesn't address the helplessness directly. Unless practice makes them confident, but that's similar to another option.

Option E: Boost in self-confidence. Solving problems could make them feel better about themselves. That makes sense. If you succeed, you feel you can do things, which would counteract helplessness.

Option F: Development of a coping mechanism. Learning to cope could help, but I'm not sure this is the exact reason. Coping mechanisms are more about dealing with stress than about reversing helplessness.

Option G: Change in attribution. Attribution is about why you think something happens. If they realize they can sometimes succeed, that's a change in their belief. So they might think, "Oh, I can solve some problems," which would reduce helplessness.

Option H: Change in problem-solving strategy. Maybe they learn a better way to approach problems, but again, that's more about the method rather than the underlying belief about their ability to affect outcomes.

Option I: Partial reinforcement. That's when rewards are given intermittently. Not sure how this applies here.

So, the main point is that after experiencing unsolvable problems, people feel helpless. But when given solvable ones, they learn that their actions can lead to success. This would change their attribution from "I can't do anything" to "I can do some things." So it's about their belief in their ability to affect outcomes.

Looking back at the options, G says a change in attribution with the realization that one can sometimes succeed. That fits. Alternatively, E is about self-confidence. Both G and E seem plausible.

Wait, what's the exact argument made in the research? The question states that giving solvable problems eliminated helplessness because of... I think it's about the attribution. When people solve problems, they attribute their success to their own actions, which counters the earlier learned helplessness.

So G makes sense. It's not just about feeling better (E) but about changing their belief about their effectiveness.

Another angle: Learned helplessness is about the expectation that outcomes are independent of responses. Providing solvable tasks shows that responses can lead to outcomes, thus changing that expectation. So it's an attributional change.

Therefore, the correct answer is G.

In learned helplessness research, the elimination of helplessness caused by unsolvable problems through solvable problems is explained by the change in attribution. Solvable problems allow individuals to realize that their actions can lead to success, altering their belief that outcomes are independent of their responses. This attributional shift counters the helplessness by demonstrating that they can sometimes succeed, which directly addresses the core issue of learned helplessness.

The correct answer is **G: a change in attribution with the realization that one can sometimes succeed**.

Answer: G
