Okay, so I've got this problem here about a piano's cost and selling price. Hmm, I need to find the percentage that the selling price is of the cost. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the cost is $18,000 and the selling price is $22,950. I remember that to find what percent one number is of another, you use the formula: (part / whole) * 100%. In this case, the selling price is the part, and the cost is the whole, I think. So the formula would be (selling price / cost) * 100%.

Let me plug in the numbers. Selling price is 22,950, cost is 18,000. So 22,950 divided by 18,000. Hmm, let's calculate that. Wait, 18,000 goes into 22,950 how many times?

Alternatively, maybe I can simplify the numbers. Let me see. Both numbers end with three zeros, so I can divide both by 1000 to make it easier. That gives me 22.95 / 18. Hmm, that's simpler. 

Wait, 18 times 1 is 18, and 22.95 is higher than that. Let me try dividing 22.95 by 18. So 18 goes into 22 once, that's 18, subtract leaves 4. Then bring down the 9 to make 49. 18 goes into 49 two times, which is 36. Subtract, leaves 13. Bring down the 5, making 135. 18 goes into 135 exactly 7.5 times because 18*7 is 126 and 18*7.5 is 135. So putting it all together: 1.275. 

Oh wait, that's 1.275. But since we divided both by 1000 earlier, the actual result is 1.275. So to get the percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives me 127.5%.

Wait, let me double-check. 18,000 multiplied by 1.275 should give me back the selling price. Let's see: 18,000 * 1 = 18,000. 18,000 * 0.275 is, let's calculate that. 0.2 times 18,000 is 3,600. 0.07 is 1,260, and 0.005 is 90. Adding those up: 3,600 + 1,260 is 4,860, plus 90 is 4,950. So 18,000 + 4,950 is 22,950. Yep, that checks out.

So the percentage is 127.5%. Looking at the options, option B is 127.5%. So the answer should be B.

To determine the percentage that the selling price is of the cost, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Selling Price}}{\text{Cost}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Given:
- Selling Price = $22,950
- Cost = $18,000

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{22,950}{18,000} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Simplify the division:

\[
\frac{22,950}{18,000} = 1.275
\]

Convert to a percentage:

\[
1.275 \times 100\% = 127.5\%
\]

Thus, the selling price is **127.5%** of the cost. The correct answer is:

B: 127.5%

Answer: B
