Okay, so I've got this problem about substituting a solid shaft with a hollow one. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my mechanics classes. The shaft is made of the same material and has the same strength, but the hollow one should weigh half as much per foot. Also, the cost increases by 20% for the hollow shaft. I need to find the internal and external diameters of the hollow shaft and the percentage saving in cost.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the solid shaft has a diameter of 4 inches. So its radius is 2 inches. The material is the same, so I guess the Young's modulus and other properties are the same. But wait, strength—oh right, strength here probably refers to something like the maximum allowable stress, maybe the yield strength. Since the material is the same, the shafts will have the same maximum stress.

But the main thing here is that the hollow shaft must have the same strength. Wait, strength in this context probably relates to torque or bending moment capacity. Let me think about that. For shafts under torsion, the maximum shear stress is given by the torsion formula: τ = (Tr)/(J), where T is torque, r is the radius, and J is the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, but since the strength is the same, the maximum shear stress must be the same for both shafts. So the allowable torque before yielding would be the same. Or maybe it's that the maximum torque they can handle without failure is the same for both shafts.

Wait, but the problem says "same material and strength". So the maximum allowable shear stress is the same for both shafts. So for the solid shaft, the maximum torque it can handle is based on its J (polar moment) and its radius. For the hollow shaft, same thing.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the hollow shaft should have the same strength. So for the same maximum shear stress, the torque would be different based on their polar moments.

Alternatively, maybe they are considering the shafts to have the same torque capacity, so for the same applied torque, the stress is within allowable limits. But I think perhaps the key is that the maximum shear stress is the same for both shafts.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the weight reduction. The hollow shaft should weigh half per foot. So the cross-sectional area of the hollow shaft must be half that of the solid.

Wait, no. Because the weight is proportional to the cross-sectional area. So the solid has area A = π R², where R is the radius. The hollow shaft has an outer radius R and inner radius r, area A = π(R² - r²). Since the weight per foot is half, the area must be half of the solid's area.

Wait, solid area is π*(2)^2 = 4π. So the hollow must have 2π area. So π(R² - r²) = 2π → R² - r² = 2.

But wait, what's R here? Since the solid is 4 inches in diameter, the hollow could have the same outer diameter (4 inches), or maybe a different one. Wait, the problem says it's substituted but doesn't specify the external diameter. So we have to find both internal and external diameters.

Wait, but perhaps the external diameter is the same as the solid? Because sometimes when you substitute, you might keep the same overall size, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the external diameter changes. The problem doesn't say, so I can't assume that.

Wait, so the solid shaft has a diameter of 4 inches, so radius 2 inches. The hollow shaft has outer radius R and inner radius r. The area is π(R² - r²) = (1/2)*π*(2²) = (1/2)*4π = 2π. So R² - r² = 2.

But another condition is that the strength is the same. So the maximum shear stress must be the same. The shear stress in a shaft is given by τ = Tr / J, where T is torque, r is the outer radius, and J is the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, but the maximum shear stress occurs at the outer radius. So for both shafts, the maximum τ must be the same when they're subjected to the same torque. Alternatively, if the shafts are to have the same strength, perhaps they can handle the same maximum torque without exceeding the material's strength.

Wait, perhaps the shafts are designed such that the maximum shear stress is the same. So for both shafts, τ_max = Tr_max / J. For the solid shaft, J_s = (π/2) R^4, where R is 2 inches. So J_s = (π/2)*(2)^4 = (π/2)*16 = 8π.

For the hollow shaft, J_h = (π/2)(R^4 - r^4).

At maximum torque, τ = Tr / J. So for the same maximum τ, Tr / J must be the same for both shafts. So T_s r_s / J_s = T_h r_h / J_h.

Wait, but if the shafts are to have the same strength, perhaps their maximum allowable torque is the same. So T_max is same for both. So T_s = T_h.

Then, (T r)/J must be the same. So (T * R) / J_h = (T * R_solid) / J_s.

Wait, but in this case, R_solid is 2 inches. R_hollow is R (since the hollow's outer radius is R).

So (T R) / J_h = (T * 2) / J_s.

Cancel T from both sides: R / J_h = 2 / J_s.

J_s is 8π, J_h is (π/2)(R^4 - r^4).

Substituting, R / [ (π/2)(R^4 - r^4) ) ] = 2 / (8π).

Simplify the right side: 2/(8π) = 1/(4π).

Left side: R * 2/(π (R^4 - r^4)) ) = 2 R / (π (R^4 - r^4)).

Set equal to 1/(4π):

2 R / [ π (R^4 - r^4) ) ] = 1/(4π)

Multiply both sides by π:

2 R / (R^4 - r^4) ) = 1/4

Multiply both sides by (R^4 - r^4):

2 R = (R^4 - r^4)/4

Multiply both sides by 4:

8 R = R^4 - r^4

But from earlier, we have R² - r² = 2. Let's square both sides: (R² - r²)^2 = 4 → R^4 - 2 R² r² + r^4 =4.

Now, we have R^4 - r^4 =8 R.

So substitute R^4 - r^4 with 8 R:

So 8 R =8 R → Hmm, that's just 8R=8R, which is always true. Wait, that doesn't help. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's let’s call D the outer diameter, so R = D/2. The inner diameter is d, so r = d/2.

We have two equations:

1. The area is half: π (R² - r²) = (1/2) π R_solid².

R_solid is 2 inches because 4-inch diameter. So R_solid is 2.

So π(R² - r²) = (1/2) π (2)^2 → (R² - r²) = 2.

2. The polar moments J are related because the maximum shear stress is the same.

τ = Tr/J.

Assuming the maximum torque T is the same for both shafts (since they must have the same strength), then τ is the same, so Tr/J must be equal.

So:

T R / J_h = T R_solid / J_s.

Cancel T:

R / J_h = R_solid / J_s.

J_s is for solid: (π/2) (R_solid)^4.

J_h is for hollow: (π/2) (R^4 - r^4).

So:

R / [ (π/2)(R^4 - r^4) ) ] = R_solid / [ (π/2) R_solid^4 ) ]

Simplify:

R / (R^4 - r^4) ) = R_solid^5 / ( R_solid^4 )

Wait, because denominator on right is (π/2) R_solid^4, so when we take reciprocal, it's multiplied by (π/2) R_solid^4.

Wait, let me recompute.

The equation is:

R / [ (π/2)(R^4 - r^4) ) ] = (R_solid) / [ (π/2) R_solid^4 ) ]

Multiply both sides by (π/2):

R / (R^4 - r^4) = R_solid / R_solid^4

Simplify the right side:

R_solid / R_solid^4 = 1 / R_solid^3.

So:

R / (R^4 - r^4) = 1 / R_solid^3.

R_solid is 2 inches, so R_solid^3 is 8.

So:

R / (R^4 - r^4) = 1/8.

Multiply both sides by (R^4 - r^4):

R = (R^4 - r^4)/8.

Multiply both sides by 8:

8R = R^4 - r^4.

From equation 1: R² - r² =2 → (R² - r²) =2 → (R² - r²)^2 =4 → R^4 - 2 R² r² + r^4 =4.

But also, from 8R = R^4 - r^4.

So substitute R^4 - r^4 =8 R into the squared equation:

(8 R) + (-2 R² r²) + ... Wait, no, let me think again.

We have R^4 - r^4 = (R²)^2 - (r²)^2 = (R² - r²)(R² + r²).

From equation 1, R² - r²=2, so R^4 - r^4 = 2*(R² + r²) =8R.

So 2(R² + r²) )=8 R → R² + r² =4 R.

Hmm, now we have two equations:

1. R² - r² =2.

2. R² + r² =4 R.

We can add them: (R² - r²) + (R² + r²) )=2 +4 R → 2 R² =4 R +2 → R² =2 R +1.

So R² =2 R +1 → R²-2 R -1=0.

Solving quadratic equation: R = [2 ± sqrt(4 +4)] /2 → [2 ± sqrt(8)]/2 → [2 ± 2√2]/2 = 1 ±√2.

Since radius can't be negative, R=1+√2 inches ≈ 2.414 inches.

Wait, that's the outer radius. But wait, the solid shaft was 2 inches radius (4 inches diameter). How can the hollow shaft have a smaller radius than the solid? That doesn't make sense because if it's smaller, perhaps the strength is less. Wait, no, because it's hollow. Let me think.

Wait, but if the outer radius R is 1+√2 ≈ 2.414 inches, which is larger than the solid's 2 inches. So the outer diameter would be about 4.828 inches. Hmm, but let me check.

Wait, but let's compute R² + r² =4 R.

We have R=1+√2.

So R²= (1+√2)^2 =1 +2√2 +2=3 +2√2.

From equation 1, R² - r²=2 → r²= R²-2= (3+2√2) -2=1 +2√2.

So r²=1+2√2 → r= sqrt(1+2√2).

Wait, sqrt(1+2√2) is approximately sqrt(1+2.828)=sqrt(3.828)≈1.957 inches, so diameter about 3.914 inches.

Wait, but then the outer diameter is 2*(1+√2)=2+2√2≈4.828 inches.

So the hollow shaft would have an outer diameter of approximately 4.828 inches and inner diameter of approximately 3.914 inches.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check which ones match.

Looking at the options:

Option B: internal 2.92, external 5.83. Hmm, 2.92 is about 2.92, 5.83 is about 5.83. But my calculation says internal diameter is about 3.91 inches and external about 4.83.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the equations again.

Wait, equation 2: R^2 + r^2 =4 R.

Equation 1: R^2 - r^2=2.

Adding the two gives 2 R^2 =4 R +2 → R^2= 2 R +1.

Which leads to R=(2 ±√(4+4))/2= [2 ±√8]/2= [2 ±2√2]/2=1±√2.

Since R must be positive, R=1+√2≈2.414 inches, so diameter D=2*(1+√2)=2+2√2≈4.828 inches.

Then, from equation 1: R^2 - r^2=2 → (3+2√2) - r^2=2 → r^2=1+2√2 → r= sqrt(1+2√2)≈sqrt(1+2.828)=sqrt(3.828)=approx 1.957 inches. So internal diameter d=2r≈3.914 inches.

Looking at the options:

Option B: internal 2.92 in, external 5.83 in. Hmm, 5.83 is larger than 4.828, so that's not matching.

Option H: internal 3.00, external 5.00. Not matching.

Option I: internal 3.92, external 4.83. Wait, 4.83 is close to our 4.828 external, and internal is 3.92. Our calculation is about 3.91 internal, so very close to 3.92. So option I: internal 3.92, external 4.83 in. 

But let me check the saving. The second part is about cost.

The cost increases by 20% per foot if hollow is used. So the cost per foot for hollow is 1.2 times the solid's.

The solid's cost is based on its weight. The hollow is half the weight, so the cost for hollow per foot would be 1.2 * (weight_hollow / weight_solid) * cost_solid_per_foot.

Wait, but perhaps the cost is proportional to the material used, which is the weight. So if the hollow is half the weight per foot, the material cost would be half. But the cost increases by 20% for hollow, so the cost per foot for hollow is 1.2 * (0.5) = 0.6 times the solid's cost.

Wait, no, more accurately: the cost of the hollow per foot is 1.2 times the cost per foot of solid shaft for the same weight. But the weight is halved, so the cost would be for half the weight but at 1.2 times the rate.

Alternatively, let's think:

Let’s say the solid shaft costs C per foot. Then the hollow shaft would cost 1.2 * C per foot for the same weight. But since the hollow is half the weight, the cost would be 0.5 * 1.2 C = 0.6 C per foot. So the saving is C -0.6 C =0.4 C, which is 40% saving.

Wait, but wait: the cost per foot for hollow is 1.2 times that of solid per foot. But since the hollow is half the weight per foot, perhaps the cost per foot for hollow is for half the weight but at a higher rate.

Let me model it:

Let’s assume the solid shaft costs C per foot.

The hollow shaft has half the weight per foot, but the cost per pound is 1.2 times that of solid. So the cost per foot for hollow would be (0.5 * weight) * (1.2 * cost_per_weight) = 0.6 * (weight * cost_per_weight) =0.6 C. So yes, saving is 40%.

Looking at the options, option I says saving of 40.3%. That's very close to 40%, so likely option I is correct.

Wait, but let me check the diameters again. According to our calculation, the external diameter is approx 4.828 inches, and internal is approx 3.914 inches. Looking at the options, option I has external 4.83 in and internal 3.92 in, which matches closely. So the saving is 40.3%, which is very close to our 40% calculation, probably due to rounding.

So the correct answer would be option I: internal diameter 3.92 in, external 4.83 in, saving 40.3%.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the internal and external diameters of the hollow shaft and the percentage saving in cost when the hollow shaft is used. The solid shaft has a diameter of 4 inches, so its radius is 2 inches. The hollow shaft must weigh half as much per foot and have the same strength (maximum shear stress) as the solid shaft. Additionally, the cost increases by 20% for the hollow shaft.

### Part (a): Internal and External Diameters of the Hollow Shaft

1. **Weight Reduction**: The weight of the hollow shaft is half that of the solid shaft. Since weight is proportional to cross-sectional area, the area of the hollow shaft must be half the area of the solid shaft:
   \[
   \text{Area of solid shaft: } A_s = \pi R_s^2 = \pi (2)^2 = 4\pi
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area of hollow shaft: } A_h = \pi (R^2 - r^2) = \frac{1}{2} A_s =
