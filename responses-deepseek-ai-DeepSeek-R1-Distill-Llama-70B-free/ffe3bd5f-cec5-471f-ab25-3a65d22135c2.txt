Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a freight train. Let's see, the question is asking how far the train will travel. Hmm, I remember from school that distance equals speed multiplied by time. Yeah, that formula was d = s * t or something like that.

So the problem says the train is going at 20 miles per hour, right? And it's traveling for 6 hours. Oh wait, so I just multiply those two numbers together. Let me do that. 20 times 6 is... uh, 120. So that would be 120 miles.

Now I need to look at the options. Let's see the choices. Option A is 90, B is 120, which matches my calculation. Then there's C at 150, which seems too high. D is 140, which is also more than 120. E is way too low at 26, that can't be right. F is 100, which is less than 120. G is 80, also lower. H is 110, still under. I is 160, that's way too high. J is 12, which is way too low.

So the correct answer should be B, 120 miles. I think that's it. I don't see any trick here. Just straightforward multiplication of speed and time.

The freight train's distance is calculated by multiplying speed (20 mph) by time (6 hours), giving 120 miles.

B: 120 miles
