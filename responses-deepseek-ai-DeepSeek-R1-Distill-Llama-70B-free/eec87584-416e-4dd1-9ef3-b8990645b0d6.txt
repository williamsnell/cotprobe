The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A woman joined a web site to get her credit reports. The site required creation of an account before she could enter. On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?

Options:

A: The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.
B: The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.
C: The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.
D: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.
E: The woman will prevail because she did not explicitly agree to the recurring charges.
F: The woman will prevail because she was not given explicit notice of the recurring charges.
G: The company will prevail because the woman did not cancel her subscription and thus accepted the terms.
H: The woman will prevail because the terms were not explicitly stated before she made the initial payment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully. 

The situation is about a woman who joined a website to get her credit reports. She had to create an account first. On the form, there was a bold notice saying, "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She didn't access the terms but could have by clicking a link. She created the account and paid $50. Then, for six months, her card was automatically billed $50 each month. She got emails when the report was available but no specific notice about the billing. The terms said she authorized the charges unless she notified the company in advance.

The question is about whether she's bound to pay for those six months until she canceled. The options are A to H, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that in contract law, there's something about terms and conditions being binding if the user has notice of them. So in this case, the terms were presented in bold, and there was a link. She didn't read them, but the question is whether she's still bound.

I think about "browsewrap" vs. "clickwrap" agreements. Clickwrap requires the user to click "I agree" after being presented with the terms, which makes it more enforceable. Browsewrap just has a link, so it's less so. Here, she wasn't required to click on the terms, just to create the account. So maybe it's a browsewrap situation.

But the terms were in bold, which might make it more noticeable. Also, she had the opportunity to click the link but didn't. So did she have sufficient notice? I think courts look at whether the terms were reasonably conspicuous. If the link is hidden, it's not enough, but if it's clear, maybe it is.

Another point is that the automatic billing was part of the terms. She didn't see the terms, so she didn't know about the recurring charges. The question is whether she implicitly agreed by not canceling. But if the terms were not properly brought to her attention, she might not be bound.

Wait, but she did agree to the terms by creating the account. The notice said it's a contract, so maybe she's still on the hook. But I'm not sure. There's a case called the Specht v. Netscape case where the court said that for browsewrap agreements, the user must have actual or constructive knowledge of the terms. If the terms are not prominently displayed, they might not be enforceable.

In this case, the terms were in bold, so that's pretty prominent. So maybe the court would find she had constructive notice. But I'm not certain.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the company prevails because the terms were in bold and accessible. That might be correct if the court finds the notice sufficient.

Option E says she prevails because she didn't explicitly agree to recurring charges. But she agreed to the terms which included that, so maybe she's bound.

Option F says she wins because she wasn't given explicit notice of the recurring charges. But the terms were available, so maybe she had constructive notice.

Option C says she wins because the terms weren't on the create account page. But the terms were accessible via a link, and the notice was in bold. So maybe that's enough.

Option B says terms are adhesion contracts and unenforceable. But I think adhesion contracts can still be enforceable if the terms are clear and there's no option but to agree. But that's more about unconscionability.

So, I'm thinking the key issue is whether the presentation of the terms was sufficient for her to be bound. Since the terms were in bold and a link was provided, she had the opportunity to read them. The fact that she didn't doesn't mean she's not bound; it just means she didn't take the opportunity.

Therefore, the company would likely prevail because the terms were sufficiently presented. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I recall that some courts require that for certain important terms, like recurring charges, there should be more prominent disclosure. If the main page doesn't mention the recurring charges and they're only in the terms, maybe that's not enough. So maybe she wasn't adequately informed.

In that case, she might not be bound because the key term about recurring billing wasn't clearly brought to her attention on the main page. So the answer would be F.

Now I'm confused. Which is it?

I think it's a balance between the notice being sufficient and the terms being accessible. If the terms are accessible but the specific term about recurring charges is buried, maybe she's not bound. But the initial notice says it's a contract, so she's on notice that terms apply.

Alternatively, the fact that she paid $50 and then was charged again without further notice might mean she didn't agree to that. But the terms say she authorized the charges unless she cancels.

I think the key is whether the terms were presented in a way that a reasonable person would know they were agreeing to them. The bold notice and link might be enough. So the company would win.

So I'm leaning towards A. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the initial payment was for the report, and the recurring charges were part of the terms. She didn't cancel, so under the terms, she's liable.

Wait, but without her knowledge of the recurring charges, even if in the terms, maybe she's not bound. So F says she wasn't given explicit notice of the recurring charges, so she wins.

I think the correct answer is F. Because even though the terms were accessible, the specific part about the recurring charges wasn't explicitly stated on the sign-up page. So she didn't have explicit notice, making the term unenforceable.

The question revolves around whether the woman is bound by the terms and conditions of the website, specifically the recurring charges. The key issue is whether the presentation of the terms was sufficient to constitute constructive notice, making the terms enforceable. The terms were presented in bold with a link, but the woman did not access them. Courts generally require that terms be reasonably conspicuous for constructive notice to apply. However, for important terms like recurring charges, there may be an expectation of more prominent disclosure.

Option A suggests the company prevails because the terms were in bold and accessible. However, the recurring charges were not explicitly stated on the sign-up page, which weakens the argument that the woman had sufficient notice. Option F argues that the woman was not given explicit notice of the recurring charges, which aligns with the idea that important terms must be clearly disclosed. The fact that the recurring charges were only in the terms and not highlighted on the main page likely means she did not have sufficient notice to be bound by that specific term.

Given the analysis, the most likely outcome is that the woman will prevail because she was not explicitly notified of the recurring charges. 

F

The answer is F.
