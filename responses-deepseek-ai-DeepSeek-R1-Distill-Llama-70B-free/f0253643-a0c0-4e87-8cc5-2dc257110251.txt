Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a neutralization reaction between an acid, C6H10Cl4, and KOH. The chemist found that 1 gram of the acid requires 0.768 grams of KOH for complete neutralization. I need to determine the number of neutralizable protons in the acid molecule.

Hmm, I remember that in neutralization reactions, an acid donates protons (H+ ions) to a base, which in this case is KOH. KOH is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely in water into K+ and OH- ions. The acid, on the other hand, can donate a certain number of protons depending on its structure.

So, the first thing I should do is figure out the molar masses of both the acid and KOH because that will allow me to find out how many moles are reacting. From there, I can determine the ratio of acid to KOH, which should tell me the number of protons the acid can donate.

Let me calculate the molar mass of C6H10Cl4. Breaking it down:

- Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of about 12 g/mol. There are 6 carbons, so 6 * 12 = 72 g/mol.
- Hydrogen (H) is about 1 g/mol. 10 H's would be 10 * 1 = 10 g/mol.
- Chlorine (Cl) has an atomic mass of approximately 35.5 g/mol. There are 4 Cl atoms, so 4 * 35.5 = 142 g/mol.

Adding those together: 72 + 10 + 142 = 224 g/mol.

Now, for KOH:
- Potassium (K) is about 39 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O) is 16.
- Hydrogen is 1.

So KOH's molar mass is 39 + 16 + 1 = 56 g/mol.

Next, I need to find the moles of each substance used. The chemist used 1 gram of the acid, so moles of acid = mass / molar mass = 1 g / 224 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 1/224 ≈ 0.004464 moles of acid.

Then, the moles of KOH used are 0.768 g / 56 g/mol. Let me do that division: 0.768 / 56 equals... hmm, 56 goes into 0.768. 56 * 0.0137 is approximately 0.768. So, about 0.0137 moles of KOH.

Now, in a neutralization reaction, each mole of KOH can neutralize one mole of H+ ions. So the acid must be donating as many moles of H+ as the moles of KOH used, assuming complete neutralization.

So, the moles of H+ from the acid should equal the moles of KOH. Let me check: moles of H+ = 0.0137 moles.

But wait, the moles of acid are 0.004464, and the moles of H+ are 0.0137. So, each mole of acid must be providing 0.0137 / 0.004464 ≈ 3.07 protons. Hmm, that's around 3 protons per molecule.

Wait, 3.07 is close to 3. So, the acid has three neutralizable protons. Let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.

Wait, 1 g of acid at 224 g/mol is 1/224 ≈ 0.004464 mol.

0.768 g KOH at 56 g/mol is 0.768 /56 = 0.013714 mol.

So, the ratio is 0.013714 / 0.004464 ≈ 3.07. So, approximately 3 protons per acid molecule.

So the number of neutralizable protons is 3.

Looking back at the options, option I is three. So the answer should be I.

To determine the number of neutralizable protons in the acid C₆H₁₀Cl₄, we analyze the neutralization reaction with KOH. The given data is:

- Mass of acid (C₆H₁₀Cl₄): 1 g  
- Mass of KOH: 0.768 g  

### Step 1: Calculate molar masses
- **Molar mass of C₆H₁₀Cl₄**:  
  - Carbon (C): \(6 \times 12 = 72 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
  - Hydrogen (H): \(10 \times 1 = 10 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
  - Chlorine (Cl): \(4 \times 35.5 = 142 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
  - Total: \(72 + 10 + 142 = 224 \, \text{g/mol}\)  

- **Molar mass of KOH**:  
  - Potassium (K): \(39 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
  - Oxygen (O): \(16 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
  - Hydrogen (H): \(1 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
  - Total: \(39 + 16 + 1 = 56 \, \text{g/mol}\)  

### Step 2: Calculate moles of acid and KOH
- **Moles of acid (C₆H₁₀Cl₄)**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acid} = \frac{\text{Mass of acid}}{\text{Molar mass of acid}} = \frac{1}{224} \approx 0.004464 \, \text{mol}
  \]

- **Moles of KOH**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of KOH} = \frac{\text{Mass of KOH}}{\text{Molar mass of KOH}} = \frac{0.768}{56} \approx 0.013714 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of neutralizable protons
In a neutralization reaction, each mole of KOH neutralizes one mole of \(H^+\) ions. Therefore, the moles of \(H^+\) ions donated by the acid are equal to the moles of KOH used:  
\[
\text{Moles of } H^+ = 0.013714 \, \text{mol}
\]

The number of neutralizable protons per molecule of acid is given by the ratio of moles of \(H^+\) to moles of acid:  
\[
\text{Number of protons per molecule} = \frac{\text{Moles of } H^+}{\text{Moles of acid}} = \frac{0.013714}{0.004464} \approx 3.07
\]

Since the number of protons must be an integer, the acid has **3 neutralizable protons**.

### Final Answer:
I
