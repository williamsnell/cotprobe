Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is: "________ men, on the average, begin engaging in sexual intercourse approximately two years later than ________ men do." The options are from A to J, each pairing different groups. 

I remember that this kind of question is about the average age of first sexual intercourse among different racial or ethnic groups. I think there was some data or studies on this topic, maybe from health or sociology classes. 

From what I recall, African American men tend to start having sex earlier than other groups. Wait, no, was that the case? Or was it the other way around? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. I remember hearing that Hispanic or Latino males might start later. Or was it White males?

Wait, I think the general trend is that African American males have their first sexual experience earlier than White or Hispanic males. So, if the question says that the first blank starts later than the second, the second group would be the ones starting earlier. 

So the structure is: [Group A] begin later than [Group B] do. So Group B starts earlier. If African Americans start earlier, then Group B would be African Americans. Then Group A would be another group that starts later, like maybe Mexican Americans or Whites.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option I says: African Americans; Whites and Latinos. So the first blank is African Americans, which would mean they start later than Whites and Latinos. But that doesn't fit because I thought African Americans start earlier. So probably not I.

Option F: African Americans; Mexican Americans and Whites. Same issue, because it would mean African Americans start later than the other two. Doesn't fit.

Option J: African Americans and Latinos; Whites. So the first group (African Americans and Latinos) start later than Whites. That doesn't align with what I remember.

Option H: Whites; African Americans and Latinos. So Whites start later than African Americans and Latinos. That makes sense because African Americans start earlier, so the first blank is Whites. So the statement would be "Whites begin approximately two years later than African Americans and Latinos." That sounds right.

Other options: Let's check option B. Mexican Americans and Whites; African Americans. So the first group (MexAm and Whites) start later than African Americans. So African Americans start earlier. That fits too. So the first blank would be Mexican Americans and Whites, meaning they start two years later than African Americans. Wait, but I thought the average age was that African Americans start earlier. So if the question is saying that Group A starts later than Group B, then Group B is the earlier group.

So in option B, the first blank is Mexican Americans and Whites, and the second is African Americans. So the sentence would be: Mexican Americans and Whites begin two years later than African Americans. So that would mean African Americans start earlier, which is correct.

Wait, but I thought that African Americans start earlier than both Whites and Mexican Americans. So in that case, the first group (Group A) would be either Whites or Mexican Americans, or both, and the second group (Group B) would be African Americans.

Looking again at the options:

Option B: Mexican Americans and Whites; African Americans. So the first part is the one that starts later, the second starts earlier. So "Mexican Americans and Whites begin two years later than African Americans."

Does that fit the data? If African Americans start earlier, then yes. So this is a possibility.

Another option is option H: Whites; African Americans and Latinos. So Whites start later than African Americans and Latinos. That also fits the idea that African Americans start earlier.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the actual data. From what I recall, in the US, the average age of first intercourse varies among ethnic groups. African American adolescents tend to initiate sexual activity earlier than their White or Hispanic counterparts. So, on average, African American males start earlier, while White and Hispanic (including Mexican American) males start later.

So the question is structured as "[Group A] begin later than [Group B]". So Group A is the later group, Group B is the earlier group.

So Group B would be African Americans, and Group A would be Whites and possibly Latinos or Mexican Americans.

Looking at the options:

Option B: The first blank is Mexican Americans and Whites, and the second is African Americans. So the sentence is: "Mexican Americans and Whites begin... later than African Americans do." That fits because African Americans start earlier.

Option H: The first blank is Whites, and the second is African Americans and Latinos. So "Whites begin later than African Americans and Latinos." That also fits because African Americans and Latinos start earlier than Whites. Wait, but I thought that African Americans start earlier, but what about Latinos? Do they start earlier or later than Whites?

I'm a bit fuzzy on that. If I remember correctly, the order is African Americans start earliest, followed by Latinos, and then Whites. Or maybe it's that Whites are later than African Americans but earlier than some other groups. Alternatively, maybe Whites start later than African Americans but earlier than Latinos. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the data I'm recalling is that African American males have first sex earlier than both White and Hispanic males. So in that case, both White and Hispanic males start later. So the first blank could be either White or Hispanic, and the second would be African Americans.

Looking at the options, option B says "Mexican Americans and Whites" as the first group, and "African Americans" as the second. So that would fit: Mexican Americans and Whites start two years later than African Americans.

Another option is option H, but that would require Latinos starting earlier than Whites. I'm not sure about that. I think it's more accurate that both Whites and Latinos start later than African Americans, but I'm not certain about the order between Whites and Latinos.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct pairing is that African Americans start earlier than both Whites and Latinos. So in the question, the first blank would be Whites and Latinos, starting later than African Americans. But looking at the options, I don't see an option where the first group is Whites and Latinos and the second is African Americans.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option I: African Americans; Whites and Latinos. So it's saying African Americans start later than Whites and Latinos. That doesn't fit because I thought African Americans start earlier.

Option J: African Americans and Latinos; Whites. So the first group is African Americans and Latinos, starting later than Whites. That would mean Whites start earlier, which contradicts what I thought.

Option G: Latinos; Whites and African Americans. So Latinos start later than Whites and African Americans. That would mean Whites and African Americans start earlier, but I thought African Americans start earlier than Whites, so maybe this is incorrect.

Option C: Latinos; African Americans and Whites. So Latinos start later than African Americans and Whites. That would mean African Americans and Whites start earlier than Latinos. But I thought African Americans start earlier than Whites, so this might not fit.

Option D: Mexican Americans; African Americans and Whites. So Mexican Americans start later than African Americans and Whites. Again, this would mean Whites start earlier than Mexican Americans, but I'm not sure about that.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach this differently. If African American men start earlier, then the second blank should be African Americans. So in the sentence, the first group starts later than African Americans.

Looking for options where the second part is African Americans.

Option B's second part is African Americans. So first part is Mexican Americans and Whites. So the statement would be: Mexican Americans and Whites begin about two years later than African Americans.

That makes sense if African Americans start earlier.

Alternatively, option H's second part is African Americans and Latinos. So first part is Whites. So "Whites begin later than African Americans and Latinos." That would imply that both African Americans and Latinos start earlier than Whites, which is possible.

But I'm not sure if Latinos start earlier than Whites. I thought the order was African Americans first, then perhaps Latinos, then Whites. Or maybe Whites and Latinos are similar, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, where the first group is Mexican Americans and Whites, and the second is African Americans, meaning African Americans start earlier.

Wait, I think I've read that, on average, African American and Latino adolescents are more likely to initiate sexual activity earlier than their White counterparts. So African Americans and Latinos start earlier than Whites. 

If that's the case, then the first blank would be Whites, and the second would be African Americans and Latinos. So the sentence would be: "Whites begin approximately two years later than African Americans and Latinos."

Looking at the options, that would correspond to option H: Whites; African Americans and Latinos.

Wait, that makes sense. So option H is: Whites; African Americans and Latinos.

So the first part is Whites, who start later, and the second part is African Americans and Latinos, who start earlier.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option H.
</think>

The question asks which group of men begins engaging in sexual intercourse approximately two years later than another group. Based on the analysis, it is understood that African American men tend to start sexual activity earlier than other groups, such as Whites and Latinos. The correct structure is: "[Group A] begin later than [Group B]." Here, Group A is the later group, and Group B is the earlier group.

Option H fits this structure: "Whites; African Americans and Latinos." This means Whites begin later than African Americans and Latinos, aligning with the understanding that African Americans and Latinos start earlier than Whites.

Answer: H
