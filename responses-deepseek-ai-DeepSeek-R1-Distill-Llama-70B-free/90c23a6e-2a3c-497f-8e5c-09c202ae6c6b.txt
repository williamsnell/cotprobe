Okay, so I have this problem about a water droplet evaporating, and I need to find out how long it takes for the drop to evaporate under certain conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out the given information to make sure I don't miss anything. The drop has a diameter of 0.12 inches, which I should probably convert to meters because most formulas in physics use SI units. The air is still, and the temperature is 78°F. I think I need to convert that to Celsius because formulas usually require that. Oh wait, and the air has water vapor with a partial pressure of 0.01037 atm. The surrounding pressure is 1 atm, so that's the atmospheric pressure.

Wait, no, the problem says the drop is at a pressure of 1 atm. Hmm, maybe that's the surrounding atmospheric pressure. But the partial pressure of water vapor is 0.01037 atm. That must be the vapor pressure in the air. So the air isn't completely dry; some water vapor is already present, so the evaporation will depend on the difference between the vapor pressure at the temperature and the partial pressure in the air.

I remember that the rate of evaporation depends on the vapor pressure difference. The formula I think I need is the one for the evaporation time of a spherical droplet. I'm trying to recall... Oh right, the formula is something like t = (ρ * D^2 * (P_atm - P_vapor)) / (something else... maybe surface tension or evaporation constants? Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the diffusion process.)

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the evaporation rate equation. I think the formula for the time it takes for a droplet to evaporate is given by t = ( (d^3) * (ρ) ) / (something involving the vapor pressure and other constants). Or perhaps it's related to the diffusion of water molecules into the air.

Oh, wait, I think the formula is t = ( (d^2) * (ρ) * R * T ) / ( 12 * D * (P_sat - P_vapor) ) ), where d is the diameter, ρ is the density of water, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, D is the diffusion coefficient, and P_sat is the saturation vapor pressure at that temperature. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms here.

Let me get this straight. The rate of evaporation can be modeled using Fick's law of diffusion. For a spherical droplet, the evaporation rate (dm/dt) is proportional to the surface area and the concentration gradient. But integrating over time to find the total time until the droplet evaporates completely would give the time t.

So, the formula I think is t = ( (d^2) * ρ ) / ( 12 * D_water_air * (P_sat - P_air) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe it's more precise to consider the molar approach. Let me think: The mass loss rate dm/dt can be written as (4π r^2) * (D * (P_sat - P_air) * M) / (R T), where M is molar mass, R is gas constant.

Hmm, but integrating over time from r = initial radius to zero would give the time. Let me try to set this up.

The initial diameter is 0.12 inches, so radius is 0.06 inches. Let me convert that to meters. 0.06 inches is 0.06 * 0.0254 m = 0.001524 meters.

The density ρ of water is about 1000 kg/m³. Molar mass M of water is 18.015 g/mol, which is 0.018015 kg/mol. R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Temperature is 78°F, which in Celsius is (78 - 32) * 5/9 = (46) * 5/9 ≈ 25.5556°C. So T is 298.706 K.

Wait, but wait, what about the saturation vapor pressure P_sat at 25.5556°C? I think I need that. Alternatively, maybe the given P_vapor is the partial pressure, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the problem states that the air has water vapor of partial pressure 0.01037 atm. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because at 25°C, the saturation vapor pressure of water is about 0.023 atm, so if the partial pressure is 0.01037 atm, that would mean the relative humidity is about 0.01037 / 0.023 ≈ 45%.

But wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me check: At 25°C, P_sat is approximately 23.8 mmHg. Since 1 atm is 760 mmHg, 23.8 mmHg is 23.8/760 ≈ 0.0313 atm. Wait, so then 0.01037 atm would be lower than that. Wait, that can't be right because at higher temperatures, P_sat is higher. Wait, maybe I had the temperature wrong.

Wait, the temperature given is 78°F, which is about 25.5556°C. So P_sat at 25.5556°C: Let me think. I can look it up or maybe calculate it. Alternatively, I remember that at 20°C, P_sat is about 0.0231 atm, and at 30°C, it's about 0.0425 atm. So 25.5°C would be somewhere in between. Let me try to interpolate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Antoine equation to calculate P_sat at T=25.5556°C.

The Antoine equation is log10(P_sat) = A - B/(T + C), where A, B, C are constants for water.

For water, in the temperature range of 1 to 100°C, the constants are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485. So P_sat is in mmHg.

So let me compute it:

T in Celsius: 25.5556°C.

Compute denominator: 25.5556 + 244.485 = 270.0406.

So B/(T+C) = 1810.94 / 270.0406 ≈ 6.703.

So log10(P_sat) = 8.14019 - 6.703 ≈ 1.43719.

So P_sat = 10^1.43719 ≈ 27.32 mmHg.

Convert to atm: 27.32 / 760 ≈ 0.03593 atm.

So P_sat ≈ 0.03593 atm at 78°F (25.5556°C).

Wait, but the problem states that the partial pressure of water vapor in the air is 0.01037 atm. So the difference (P_sat - P_air) is 0.03593 - 0.01037 ≈ 0.02556 atm.

So the driving force for evaporation is this difference.

Now, the formula I think is:

t = (d^3 * ρ) / (6 * D * (P_sat - P_air) * M / (R T)) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again.

The evaporation of a droplet can be modeled as a diffusion process. The rate at which mass is lost is given by dm/dt = 4π r^2 * (D * (P_sat - P_air) * M) / (R T).

But wait, let me get the units right. Let's think in terms of molar flux. The flux J is (D * (C_sat - C_air)) / (thickness), but thickness here would be considered as the distance over which the gradient occurs, maybe the radius or something else. Alternatively, for a sphere, the rate of mass loss is often given by the formula:

dm/dt = 4π r^2 * (D * (ρ_sat - ρ_air)) / (1), assuming the density gradient is the driving force. Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, another approach. The rate of change of radius can be found by considering the mass flux. For a sphere, the rate of change of mass is dm/dt = 4π r^2 (dr/dt) * ρ.

But the mass flux due to diffusion is given by Fick's law: dm/dt = 4π r^2 * D * (C_sat - C_air) / (r), assuming steady-state and a spherical shell? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the flux J is (D * (C_sat - C_air)) / (r), and the rate is 4π r^2 * J, so dm/dt = 4π r^2 * (D*(C_sat - C_air)/r) ) = 4π r D (C_sat - C_air).

But C_sat is the concentration of water vapor at saturation, and C_air is the concentration in the surrounding air.

The concentration C can be expressed in terms of partial pressure using the ideal gas law: C = P/(R T). So C_sat = P_sat / (R T), and C_air = P_air / (R T).

So substituting, C_sat - C_air = (P_sat - P_air)/(R T).

Putting it all together, dm/dt = 4π r D (P_sat - P_air)/(R T).

But dm/dt is also equal to 4π r^2 (dr/dt) * ρ, since the mass loss is the surface area times the rate of radius decrease times density.

So equate the two expressions:

4π r^2 (dr/dt) ρ = 4π r D (P_sat - P_air)/(R T).

Cancel 4π r from both sides:

r (dr/dt) ρ = D (P_sat - P_air)/(R T).

So dr/dt = D (P_sat - P_air) / (ρ R T r).

This is a differential equation. Let me rearrange it:

dr/dt = [D (P_sat - P_air)] / (ρ R T r).

We can separate variables:

r dr = [D (P_sat - P_air)/(ρ R T)] dt.

Integrate both sides. The left side is from r = r_initial to r = 0, and the right side from t=0 to t=T.

So ∫ from r_initial to 0 of r dr = ∫ from 0 to T of [D (P_sat - P_air)/(ρ R T)] dt.

Wait, no, the right side is [D (P_sat - P_air)] / (ρ R T) times ∫ dt from 0 to T.

So integrating the left side:

(1/2) r² evaluated from r_initial to 0 is (1/2) r_initial².

So (1/2) r_initial² = [D (P_sat - P_air) / (ρ R T)] * T.

Wait, because the right side is [D (P_sat - P_air)]/(ρ R T) * T, since the integral of dt from 0 to T is T.

So T = (1/2) r_initial² * (ρ R T) / [D (P_sat - P_air)].

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Let's do the integration again.

After integrating, we have:

(1/2) r_initial² = [D (P_sat - P_air)]/(ρ R T) * T.

Wait, the T on the right side cancels out, so:

(1/2) r_initial² = [D (P_sat - P_air) * T] / (ρ R T).

Wait, no, wait, the equation after integration is:

(1/2) r_initial² = [D (P_sat - P_air) / (ρ R T)] * T.

Because the right integral is [D (P_sat - P_air)/(ρ R T)] * T.

So T cancels out, and we get:

(1/2) r_initial² = [D (P_sat - P_air) ] / (ρ R).

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't match. Let me check the units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration step. Let me think again.

Wait, the integral of r dr from r_initial to 0 is (1/2) r_initial².

And the integral of [D (P_sat - P_air)/(ρ R T)] dt from 0 to T is [D (P_sat - P_air)/(ρ R T)] * T.

So:

(1/2) r_initial² = [D (P_sat - P_air) T] / (ρ R T).

The T's cancel, so:

(1/2) r_initial² = [D (P_sat - P_air)] / (ρ R).

Therefore, solving for T:

T = ( (1/2) r_initial² * ρ R ) / ( D (P_sat - P_air) ).

Wait, that makes more sense. So T is the time it takes for the droplet to evaporate.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, let's compute each term.

r_initial is 0.12 inches diameter, so radius is 0.06 inches. Convert to meters: 0.06 * 0.0254 m = 0.001524 m.

r_initial = 0.001524 m.

ρ (density of water) = 1000 kg/m³.

R (gas constant) = 8.314 J/mol·K.

D is the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air. Hmm, what's the value of D here? I don't remember the exact value, but I think it's around 2.5e-5 m²/s at 25°C. Wait, let me check. I think at 25°C and 1 atm, the diffusion coefficient for water vapor in air is approximately 2.5 × 10^-5 m²/s.

P_sat is 0.03593 atm (as calculated earlier), and P_air is 0.01037 atm, so (P_sat - P_air) = 0.02556 atm.

Now, let's compute each part.

(1/2) r_initial² = 0.5 * (0.001524)^2 = 0.5 * (2.324576e-6) = 1.162288e-6 m².

ρ R = 1000 kg/m³ * 8.314 J/mol·K. Wait, wait, units don't match here. Let me think. Because D is in m²/s, P is in atm, but need to convert everything to SI units.

Wait, perhaps I need to express (P_sat - P_air) in Pascals because R is in J/mol·K, which is m³·Pa/mol·K.

So 1 atm is 101325 Pa. So (P_sat - P_air) = 0.02556 atm = 0.02556 * 101325 ≈ 2588.26 Pa.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.02556 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 2588.26 Pa.

So, let me compute T:

T = ( (1/2) r_initial² * ρ R ) / ( D (P_sat - P_air) )

Plugging in the numbers:

(1/2 r²) = 1.162288e-6 m².

ρ R = 1000 kg/m³ * 8.314 J/mol·K. Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so R has units (kg·m²/s²)/(mol·K). Hmm, but I'm not sure that's the right way to handle the units here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything numerically.

Let me compute the numerator:

(1/2 r²) * ρ * R = (1.162288e-6 m²) * 1000 kg/m³ * 8.314 J/mol·K.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so:

1.162288e-6 m² * 1000 kg/m³ = 1.162288e-3 kg/m.

Then multiply by 8.314 J/mol·K: 1.162288e-3 kg/m * 8.314 J/mol·K = ?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me just calculate numerically.

(1/2 r²) = 1.162288e-6 m².

ρ = 1000 kg/m³.

R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

So numerator: 1.162288e-6 * 1000 * 8.314.

Wait, 1.162288e-6 * 1e3 = 1.162288e-3.

1.162288e-3 * 8.314 ≈ 0.00966 kg·J/mol·K.

Wait, but the denominator is D * (P_sat - P_air):

D = 2.5e-5 m²/s.

(P_sat - P_air) = 2588.26 Pa.

So denominator: 2.5e-5 m²/s * 2588.26 Pa.

2.5e-5 * 2588.26 ≈ 0.0647 Pa·m²/s.

Wait, but Pa is kg/(m·s²), so the denominator is 0.0647 kg/(m·s³).

So T = numerator / denominator = (0.00966 kg·J/mol·K) / (0.0647 kg/(m·s³)).

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so numerator is 0.00966 kg·(kg·m²/s²)/mol·K.

Denominator: 0.0647 kg/(m·s³).

Hmm, this is getting messy. Maybe I should just compute the numerical value without worrying about units for now.

Numerator: (1.162288e-6) * 1000 * 8.314 ≈ 1.162288e-6 * 8314 ≈ 9.66e-3.

Denominator: 2.5e-5 * 2588.26 ≈ 2.5e-5 * 2.588e3 ≈ 0.0647.

So T ≈ 9.66e-3 / 0.0647 ≈ 0.149 seconds? That can't be right because the options are in hours.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in my calculations or the approach.

Wait, another thought: I think the formula might actually be t = ( (d^2) * ρ ) / ( 12 * D * (P_sat - P_air) ) * (R T) / M.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the molar mass somewhere. Let me try to re-derive the equation properly.

The correct
