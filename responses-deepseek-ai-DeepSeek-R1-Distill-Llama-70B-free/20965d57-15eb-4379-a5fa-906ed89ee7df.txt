Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses and their refractive power. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that there's a lens gauge calibrated for glass with a refractive index of 1.5. This gauge is used to measure a thin double convex lens made of glass with a higher index, 1.6. The dial readings for both surfaces are +4 diopters. I need to find the actual refractive power of the lens, assuming its thickness is negligible.

Hmm, wait. I remember that the refractive power (or optical power) of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length, measured in diopters. The formula for a thin lens is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces.

But wait, the lens gauge is calibrated for a different refractive index. So when the gauge measures the curvature of the lens surfaces, it's probably using the n it's designed for, here n=1.5. But the actual lens has n=1.6. So the focal length calculated by the gauge would be based on n=1.5, but we need to adjust it for the actual n=1.6.

Wait, no, the lens gauge measures the curvature (the radii of the surfaces). The gauge gives a reading in diopters, which is based on its calibration. So when the gauge says +4 diopters for each surface, that's probably the power each surface would have if the lens were made of n=1.5 glass. But the actual lens is made of n=1.6, so each surface's power contributes differently.

Wait, but for each surface, the power is given by (n - 1)/R, where R is the radius of curvature. So if the gauge is measuring R based on n=1.5, but the actual n is different, the actual power of each surface would change.

Wait, no. The gauge itself is probably measuring the curvature (R) of each surface. The reading on the gauge is based on the formula (n_gauge -1)/R. But in reality, each surface's contribution to the lens power is (n_actual -1)/R.

So the gauge's reading for each surface is D_gauge = (n_gauge -1)/R. So R can be calculated as (n_gauge -1)/D_gauge.

But wait, the lens has two surfaces, both being convex. So for each surface, the power is (n-1)/R, but since the lens is double convex, the second surface has a negative radius, right? Or wait, how does that work.

Wait, the formula for a thin lens is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ], where R1 is the radius of the first surface and R2 the second. For a double convex lens, R1 is positive (since it's convex on the first side) and R2 is negative because the second surface is convex as well. Wait, no. Wait, the sign conventions can be tricky. Let me think. 

In the standard sign convention, the radius is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light. For a double convex lens, both surfaces are convex, so R1 is positive and R2 is negative. Or wait, maybe R2 is positive if the surface is convex when viewed from the other side? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. 

Wait, no. The usual convention is that R is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light. So for a double convex lens, the first surface (say, left side) is convex when light is coming from the left, so R1 is positive. The second surface (right side) is convex when looking from the right, which is concave when viewed from the left. So R2 would be negative. Or wait, no. Wait, when the lens is double convex, both surfaces are curved outward. So from the left, the first surface is convex (R1 positive), and from the right, the second surface is convex (R2 positive as well). So I think both R1 and R2 are positive for a double convex lens. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the lens maker's formula again.

The lens maker's formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where R1 is the radius of the first surface and R2 the radius of the second. For a double convex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive because each surface is convex. Wait, no, wait. No, if the lens is double convex, then when viewed from the first side (say, the left), the first surface is convex (R1 positive), and the second surface, when viewed from the right, is convex, which from the left side would appear as a concave surface. Wait, that can't be right because a double convex lens has both surfaces convex outward. So perhaps I should think of the lens as having R1 positive and R2 negative? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, maybe I should not get stuck on the signs right now and instead proceed with the given data. Since the problem states that the lens is thin and double convex, and the gauge measures +4 diopters for both surfaces, perhaps the key is to find the actual power each surface contributes when n is 1.6 instead of 1.5.

Wait, the gauge is calibrated for n=1.5. So each surface's power as per the gauge is D_gauge = (1.5 - 1)/R = 0.5/R. But the actual power for each surface would be D_actual = (1.6 - 1)/R = 0.6/R. Since the gauge measures D_gauge as +4 for each surface, that would imply that 0.5/R = 4, so R = 0.5/4 = 0.125 meters, or 12.5 cm. 

Wait, but wait, the gauge measures the diopter for each surface. So each surface's contribution is D = (n_gauge -1)/R. So for each surface, R = (n_gauge -1)/D. Since both surfaces give +4 diopters, each R would be 0.5 /4 = 0.125 m.

So R1 is 0.125 m, and R2 is also 0.125 m. But wait, because the lens is double convex, one of the surfaces will have a negative radius? Or are both positive? Hmm. Let me think again about the lens maker's formula.

The formula is 1/f = (n -1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

Wait, no, more accurately, the correct formula is 1/f = (n -1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ) ] * (-1), but I'm getting myself confused. Let me check the correct formula.

Wait, no. The correct lens maker's formula for a thin lens in air is 1/f = (n -1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ), where R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces. The signs are determined by the direction the surfaces are facing: R1 is positive if the first surface is convex towards the incoming light, and R2 is positive if the second surface is convex towards the incoming light. Wait, no. Let me get this right.

In the standard convention:

- For a double convex lens, R1 is positive, and R2 is negative. Because the first surface is convex (so R1 positive), and the second surface, when viewed from the inside of the lens, is concave. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps R2 is negative because the center of curvature is on the same side as the first surface.

Alternatively, maybe both R1 and R2 are positive for a double convex lens. Because each surface is convex, so each radius is measured in the direction of the curvature. So for a biconvex lens, R1 and R2 are both positive. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think about it.

Wait, perhaps in the lens maker's formula, for a surface that's convex when facing the incoming light, R is positive. For a surface that's concave when facing the incoming light, R is negative. So for a double convex lens, the first surface is convex (R1 positive), the second surface is convex when viewed from the opposite side, which would make it concave when viewed from the same side as the first surface. So R2 would be negative.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because then for a double convex lens, R1 is positive, R2 is negative. So let's say R1 is +R and R2 is -R. Then 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ) ] = (n-1) [ (1/R) - (1/(-R)) ) ] = (n-1)[ (1/R) + (1/R) ) ] = (n-1)(2/R), which would make sense for a symmetric double convex lens.

Alternatively, maybe both R1 and R2 are positive. Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Since the problem gives that both surfaces have a gauge reading of +4 diopters, perhaps each surface contributes +4 when using n=1.5. But the actual contribution when n=1.6 is higher.

Wait, the gauge reading is D_gauge = (n_gauge - 1)/R. So R = (n_gauge -1)/D_gauge.

So for each surface, R = (1.5 -1)/4 diopters = 0.5 /4 = 0.125 m, which is 12.5 cm.

Since the lens is double convex, I think R1 is positive and R2 is negative. Or wait, no, because both surfaces are convex. Hmm. Wait, perhaps for a double convex lens, R1 is positive, R2 is negative because the second surface curves in the opposite direction. So 1/R2 would be negative.

So each surface's radius is 0.125 m, but R2 is negative because it's the opposite curvature direction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model this.

Each surface, when measured by the gauge, gives D_gauge = (n_gauge -1)/R. So R = (n_gauge -1)/D_gauge.

So for each surface, R = (0.5) /4 = 0.125 m. But for a double convex lens, the second surface's radius would have the opposite sign. So R1 = +0.125 m, R2 = -0.125 m.

Wait, no, that can't be right because for a double convex lens, both surfaces are convex outward. So when light enters the first surface (R1), it's convex, so R1 is positive. The second surface, when viewed from the other side, is convex, but from the first side, it's concave. So R2 would be negative.

So plugging into the formula:

1/f = (n_actual -1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

But R2 is negative, so 1/R2 is negative.

So let's compute this:

n_actual = 1.6.

R1 = +0.125 m, R2 = -0.125 m.

So 1/R1 = 8 m^-1, 1/R2 = -8 m^-1.

Thus, (1/R1 - 1/R2) = 8 - (-8) = 16 m^-1.

Wait, that seems high. So 1/f = (1.6 -1) * 16 = 0.6 * 16 = 9.6 m^-1.

So f is 1/9.6 ≈ 0.104166... meters, so the power is 9.6 diopters.

Wait, but the options have option C as 9.6 diopters. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my signs. Because if R2 is negative, then 1/R2 is negative. So 1/R1 - 1/R2 = (1/0.125) - (1/(-0.125)) ) = 8 - (-8) = 16. That seems correct.

So 1/f = 0.6 * 16 = 9.6 diopters.

So the answer is C: 9.6 diopters.

To determine the refractive power of the thin double convex lens, we start by analyzing the given data. The lens gauge is calibrated for glass with a refractive index of \( n_{\text{gauge}} = 1.5 \), and it measures the power of each surface as \( +4 \, \text{diopters} \). The actual lens is made of glass with a refractive index \( n_{\text{actual}} = 1.6 \). The goal is to calculate the total refractive power of the lens.

### Step 1: Relating the gauge reading to the radius of curvature
The power of a single surface is given by:

\[
D = \frac{n - 1}{R}
\]

For the gauge, \( n = n_{\text{gauge}} = 1.5 \), and the reading for each surface is \( D_{\text{gauge}} = +4 \, \text{diopters} \). Solving for the radius of curvature \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{n_{\text{gauge}} - 1}{D_{\text{gauge}}} = \frac{1.5 - 1}{4} = \frac{0.5}{4} = 0.125 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the radius of curvature for each surface is \( R = 0.125 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 2: Adjusting for the actual refractive index
The actual power of each surface is calculated using the actual refractive index \( n_{\text{actual}} = 1.6 \):

\[
D_{\text{actual}} = \frac{n_{\text{actual}} - 1}{R} = \frac{1.6 - 1}{0.125} = \frac{0.6}{0.125} = 4.8 \, \text{diopters}.
\]

Since the lens is double convex, the second surface contributes negatively to the total power. Therefore, the total refractive power of the lens is:

\[
D_{\text{total}} = D_{\text{actual,1}} - D_{\text{actual,2}} = 4.8 - (-4.8) = 9.6 \, \text{diopters}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The refractive power of the lens is \( 9.6 \, \text{diopters} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
