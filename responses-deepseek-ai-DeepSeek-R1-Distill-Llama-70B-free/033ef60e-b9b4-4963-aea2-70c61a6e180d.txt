Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about choosing between aluminum alloy and copper alloy fins based on economic considerations. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me some data. Let me jot that down to keep track.

- Density of aluminum alloy: 2400 kg/m³
- Density of copper alloy: 8400 kg/m³
- Conductivity of aluminum: 78 kCal/m·hr·°C
- Conductivity of copper: 190 kCal/m·hr·°C
- Cost: Aluminum is twice the cost of copper.

Wait, wait, so aluminum is more expensive than copper? Or is copper more expensive? The wording says the cost of aluminum alloy is twice that of copper. So, if copper is cheaper, then aluminum is pricier.

But why does that matter? Oh right, because we're considering economy, so cost is a big factor. But we also need to consider the performance, which relates to thermal conductivity.

Thermal conductivity tells us how well a material conducts heat. Higher conductivity means better heat transfer. Copper has higher conductivity (190) than aluminum (78), so copper is better at conducting heat.

But wait, if copper is more conductive, it's better for heat transfer. But if it's cheaper, then why not use copper? Or wait, no, the cost of aluminum is twice that of copper. So for the same amount, copper is cheaper. Let me think about cost per unit.

Wait, perhaps the question is about cost per unit performance. Like, which material gives better performance per dollar spent.

So we need to compare the cost-effectiveness. Let's say we have a certain volume of material. The cost would be volume multiplied by density, but wait, no, because the cost is probably per unit mass or something else. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of cost per unit of thermal conductivity.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compare the ratio of conductivity to cost. Because we want the most conductivity per unit cost.

Let's see. Let me compute the conductivity per cost for each material.

Assume the cost per kilogram for each:

Let's say the cost of copper alloy is C per kg. Then aluminum is 2C per kg.

So for copper:
Conductivity = 190
Cost per kg = C
So Conductivity per cost (CPC) = 190 / C

For aluminum:
Conductivity =78
Cost per kg = 2C
CPC =78/(2C)=39/C

So copper's CPC is 190/C, aluminum's is 39/C. So copper has a higher CPC. That means, for the same cost, you get more conductivity with copper. So it's more economical to use copper if higher conductivity is needed, but wait, is that the case?

Wait, but the question is about using fins. Fins are used to increase the surface area for heat transfer. So the material's conductivity plays a big role in how efficient the fin is. Higher conductivity would mean the fin can transfer heat more effectively.

But if copper is cheaper than aluminum (since aluminum costs twice as much as copper), but copper is also more conductive, why would anyone choose aluminum? Maybe in some cases where weight is a concern? Because copper is denser than aluminum. So for applications where weight is important, maybe aluminum is better because it's lighter, even if it's more expensive per kg.

Wait, the question is about economy considerations. So perhaps we should look at cost per unit benefit, which in this case is the heat transfer.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the cost per unit of thermal conductivity per mass or volume.

Wait, another approach: Let's say we have a certain volume of the fin. The mass would be volume * density. The cost would be mass * cost per kg.

But the thermal performance depends on the conductivity. So for a given volume, which material gives better cost-effectiveness?

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to compare the cost per unit of thermal conductivity.

Wait, let's think about it this way. Suppose we have the same volume for both materials. Then:

- Aluminum: cost = volume * density_aluminum * cost_per_kg_aluminum
But wait, the problem states that the cost of aluminum alloy is twice that of copper alloy. So if copper's cost per kg is C, then aluminum's is 2C.

So for the same volume:

Mass_al = volume * density_al
Mass_cu = volume * density_cu

Cost_al = Mass_al * 2C
Cost_cu = Mass_cu * C

But we're looking for which material gives better conductivity per cost.

Alternatively, perhaps we should compute (Conductivity) / (Cost per kg * Density) ?

Wait, maybe the cost per unit volume would be density multiplied by cost per kg. So cost per m³ for aluminum is 2400 kg/m³ * 2C = 4800C. For copper, it's 8400 kg/m³ * C =8400C.

Wait, but conductivity is per meter, so maybe we don't need to factor in density. Alternatively, the key is that for a given mass, which material is better in terms of conductivity per cost.

Let me think again. Suppose I have a certain amount of money to spend. Which material would give me more conductivity for that money?

So for a given cost, X, the amount of material I can buy is X/(cost per kg). For copper, X/C, for aluminum X/(2C).

Then, the conductivity would be that amount multiplied by their respective conductivities.

Wait, no, because conductivity is a property per unit length or area. Maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps we should compare the ratio of conductivity to cost for each material.

Copper: Conductivity 190, cost per kg C. So 190/C per kg.

Aluminum: Conductivity 78, cost per kg 2C. So 78/(2C)=39/C per kg.

So copper has a better conductivity per cost ratio than aluminum.

That suggests that for the same cost, copper provides better conductivity. So using copper would be more economical in terms of thermal performance.

But wait, the question is about fins. Maybe the application's environment matters. Like, in high-temperature applications, maybe one material is better. Or perhaps in low-temperature, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, option B says aluminum for low-temp, copper for high-temp. But why? Higher conductivity would be better for high-temp, right? Because you want to transfer heat quickly. So copper would be better for high-temp. So option B suggests that. But from the cost perspective, copper is cheaper than aluminum.

Wait, but if copper is cheaper and better conductor, why would you ever use aluminum? Unless maybe under certain constraints, like weight. Because copper is denser, so for the same volume, it's heavier. So maybe in applications where weight is a concern, like in vehicles or aircraft, you might prefer aluminum despite being more expensive, because it's lighter.

But the question is about economy. So perhaps the cost is the main factor. So if copper is cheaper and better conductor, the answer would suggest using copper. But looking at the options, option C is copper alloy, but option J is aluminum.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the cost is given as "the cost of aluminum alloy is twice the cost of copper alloy." So for the same mass, aluminum is twice as expensive as copper. But copper is denser, so for the same volume, aluminum would cost less because you need less mass. Because density is mass per volume.

Wait, let's compute cost per volume.

Cost per volume for aluminum: density_aluminum * cost_al/kg =2400 kg/m³ * 2C =4800 C per m³.

Cost per volume for copper: density_cu * cost_cu/kg=8400 kg/m³ * C=8400 C per m³.

So for the same volume, copper is more expensive (8400C vs 4800C for aluminum). Oh, so in terms of cost per volume, aluminum is cheaper.

Wait, but earlier when I considered per kg, copper was cheaper. So this is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key is to compare cost per unit of thermal conductivity per volume.

So, for each material, the thermal conductivity per unit cost (per volume).

Thermal conductivity per cost per volume:

Aluminum: 78 kCal/(m·hr·°C) / (4800 C) = 78/(4800 C) = approx 0.01625 per C.

Copper: 190 / (8400 C) ≈ 0.02262 per C.

So copper has higher thermal conductivity per cost per volume. So for each unit of cost (per volume), copper gives better conductivity.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about which material gives better conductivity per dollar spent on volume.

If I have a certain volume, say 1 m³, the cost for aluminum is 4800C, and for copper it's 8400C. The conductivity of aluminum is 78, copper 190.

So, per m³, copper provides higher conductivity but at a higher cost. But which gives better value for money?

So, conductivity per cost for 1 m³:

Aluminum:78 /4800C ≈0.01625 C^{-1} kCal/(m·hr·°C)
Copper:190 /8400C≈0.02262 C^{-1} kCal/(m·hr·°C)

So copper has better conductivity per cost. So for the same volume, even though copper is more expensive, it offers better thermal performance per dollar spent.

But wait, the question is about economy, so perhaps the cost is more important than the performance. Or maybe it's a balance between the two.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to find which material has a better ratio of conductivity to cost per unit mass, not volume.

Wait, let me compute conductivity per cost per kg.

Aluminum:78 kCal/(2C) =39/C
Copper:190 /C=190/C

So per kg, copper gives higher conductivity per cost.

So if you can use less material (like in a fin where you can make it thinner), copper is better. But if you need more material, perhaps aluminum is cheaper per volume.

Wait, but in heat transfer, fins are designed to have certain efficiency. The material's conductivity affects how well the fin performs. So higher conductivity materials are better for fins because they can transfer heat more efficiently.

So considering that, and the cost per kg, copper seems better. But if you're using per volume, copper is more expensive but more efficient.

Wait, but for the same volume, copper is more conductive, which is better for heat transfer, but costs more. The question is about economy, so perhaps the right approach is to find which material gives the best performance per unit cost.

In that case, copper's conductivity per cost (per kg) is better, so using copper would be more economical in terms of performance.

But looking at the answer options, option J is aluminum alloy. So that can't be right if copper is better. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the cost per unit conductivity. Like, how much does each unit of conductivity cost.

So for aluminum, each kCal/(m·hr·°C) costs (2C)/78 per kg.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of cost per unit conductivity.

So for each unit of conductivity, how much does it cost.

For aluminum: cost per conductivity unit = (2C)/78 ≈0.02564 C per (kCal/(m·hr·°C)).

For copper: C/190≈0.00526 C per same unit.

So copper is cheaper per unit of conductivity. So for each unit of conductivity, copper costs less. So again, copper is more economical.

But wait, maybe the question is looking at the cost per unit of thermal conductivity per mass. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compare the ratio of conductivity to cost.

So, for each material, (Conductivity)/(Cost per kg):

Aluminum:78/(2C)=39/C
Copper:190/C

So copper has a higher ratio. So copper is better in terms of conductivity per cost per kg.

Thus, using copper would be more economical for better performance.

But then why is one of the options suggesting aluminum? Because maybe the actual cost isn't the only factor. Maybe in some applications, you can't use copper.

Wait, the options:

Option B: aluminum for low-temp, copper for high-temp.

But why? Because for high-temp applications, higher conductivity is better, so copper is better. But if copper is cheaper and better, why would you use aluminum for low-temp?

Unless in low-temp applications, the extra conductivity isn't needed, and using a cheaper option (but aluminum is more expensive than copper, but wait, per kg? Wait, no, aluminum is twice as expensive per kg, but per volume, aluminum is cheaper.

Wait, earlier I found that for the same volume, aluminum is cheaper (4800C vs 8400C for copper). So per volume, aluminum is cheaper. So if you're using a lot of volume, maybe aluminum is cheaper, but less conductive.

So, perhaps in situations where you can use a thicker (more volume) aluminum fin, it might be cheaper than a thinner copper fin that provides the same or better performance.

Wait, but for a fin, the performance is a function of conductivity, length, thickness, etc. But perhaps for the same fin dimensions, copper would be better, but if you can make the aluminum fin thicker, maybe it can compensate for lower conductivity while being cheaper.

But that's getting complicated. The question is about economy considerations. So it's probably looking for the most cost-effective option based on conductivity per cost.

Another thought: sometimes, materials are chosen based on cost per unit of thermal performance. So let's compute the cost per unit of conductivity.

For aluminum: Cost per conductivity = (Cost per kg) / conductivity = (2C) /78 ≈0.02564 C per (kCal/(m·hr·°C)).

For copper: C/190≈0.00526 C per same unit.

So copper is cheaper per unit of conductivity. So using copper is more economical.

So the answer would suggest using copper alloy. Looking at the options, option C is copper alloy.

Wait, but some other options might involve combining both. Option E suggests a composite, but that might be more expensive. Option C is just copper alloy.

So the correct answer should be option C: copper alloy.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A: copper core, aluminum finish

B: aluminum for low-temp, copper for high

C: copper alloy

D: aluminum with increased thickness

E: composite

F: equal amounts

G: copper with aluminum coating

H: alternating layers

I: neither

J: aluminum alloy

So according to my analysis, the answer should be option C.

But wait, another angle: the cost of aluminum is twice that of copper. So if I can use less copper to achieve the same performance, it might be cheaper overall.

Wait, for example, let's say you need a certain amount of heat to be transferred. Copper, being more conductive, would require less material to achieve the same heat transfer as aluminum. So even though copper is more expensive per kg, you need less of it, which could make it cheaper overall.

But let's compute that. Suppose I need a heat transfer rate of Q.

The heat transfer in a fin is given by Q = (conductivity) * (area) * (temperature difference) * (efficiency factors). But perhaps for simplicity, let's assume that for the same performance, the required volume would be inversely proportional to conductivity.

So if copper is 190 and aluminum is 78, then the volume ratio would be 190/78 ≈2.435. So you'd need about 2.435 times more aluminum volume than copper to get the same conductivity.

But the cost per volume for aluminum is 4800C, copper is 8400C.

So the cost for copper would be volume_cu *8400C.

The cost for aluminum would be (volume_cu *2.435) *4800C.

Compute the ratio:

Aluminum cost = 2.435 *4800 = 11,688 C per volume_cu.

Copper cost =8400 C per volume_cu.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, if I have the same volume, copper is more expensive. But if I need more volume of aluminum to match the conductivity of copper, then the cost would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If I need the same thermal performance (same Q), how much volume of each material would I need?

Assuming Q is proportional to conductivity * volume (simplifying), then:

Q = k * V, where k is conductivity, V is volume.

So for same Q:

k_al * V_al = k_cu * V_cu

So V_al = (k_cu / k_al) * V_cu = (190/78) V_cu ≈2.435 V_cu.

So you need 2.435 times more volume of aluminum than copper to get the same Q.

Now, the cost for copper would be V_cu * density_cu * cost_per_kg_cu.

Similarly, cost for aluminum is V_al * density_al * cost_per_kg_al.

Compute both:

Cost_cu = V_cu *8400 kg/m³ * C (since copper's cost is C per kg).

Cost_al = (2.435 V_cu) *2400 kg/m³ * 2C.

Let's compute:

Cost_cu = V_cu *8400 C.

Cost_al =2.435 * V_cu *2400 *2C =2.435 *4800 * V_cu C = 11,688 V_cu C.

So Cost_al is higher than Cost_cu (11,688 vs 8400). So even though you need more aluminum, it's more expensive to achieve the same Q.

Thus, copper is cheaper for the same performance.

So the conclusion is that copper is more economical for better performance.

But looking back at the answer options, option C is copper alloy.

So the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

From an economic perspective, the choice between aluminum alloy and copper alloy fins depends on balancing thermal performance and cost. The key data provided is:

- **Density**: Aluminum alloy = 2400 kg/m³, Copper alloy = 8400 kg/m³  
- **Conductivity**: Aluminum alloy = 78 kCal/(m·hr·°C), Copper alloy = 190 kCal/(m·hr·°C)  
- **Cost**: Aluminum alloy is twice the cost of copper alloy per kilogram.

### Analysis:
1. **Thermal Performance**: Copper alloy has a significantly higher thermal conductivity (190 kCal/(m·hr·°C)) compared to aluminum alloy (78 kCal/(m·hr·°C)). This means copper is more effective at transferring heat, making it better suited for high-performance applications.

2. **Cost Considerations**:  
   - The cost of aluminum alloy is twice that of copper alloy per kilogram.  
   - However, copper is denser than aluminum, so for the same volume, copper is more expensive.
