Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an observation balloon. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I remember that when dealing with balloons or anything that floats, buoyancy must be a factor here. Oh right, the upward force is equal to the weight of the displaced air. 

The problem gives me the volume of the balloon as 300 m³. It's filled with hydrogen, which has a density of 0.1 g per liter. Wait, but I should probably convert that into kg per cubic meter because the other units are in kg and meters. Oh right, 1 liter is 0.001 m³. So 0.1 grams per liter is 0.1 g/L * (1 kg/1000 g) * (1000 L/m³) = 0.1 kg/m³. Wait wait, let me check that again. 1 liter is 0.001 m³, so 1 g/L is 1 kg/m³. So 0.1 g/L is 0.1 kg/m³. Yep.

The basket and passengers have a total mass of 350 kg. So the total mass of the system is the mass of the hydrogen plus the mass of the basket and passengers. Wait, no, wait. No, the mass of the hydrogen is the volume times the density. So the mass of hydrogen is 300 m³ * 0.1 kg/m³. Let me compute that: 300 * 0.1 is 30 kg. So the total mass of the balloon plus hydrogen is 350 kg +30 kg = 380 kg. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the basket and passengers have a mass of 350 kg. So the total mass being lifted is 350 kg plus the mass of the hydrogen, which is 30 kg, making 380 kg. But wait, no, the problem says the basket and passengers have a total mass of 350 kg. So the mass of the balloon structure, passengers, etc., is 350 kg. The mass of the hydrogen is 30 kg. So the total mass is 350 + 30 = 380 kg.

But wait, no. Wait, no. The hydrogen is inside the balloon, so does that count towards the mass? Yes, because when the balloon is moving upwards, it has to carry both the hydrogen and everything else. So yes, the total mass is 350 +30 = 380 kg. Or wait, maybe the 350 kg already includes the hydrogen? No, the wording is that the basket and passengers have a total mass of 350 kg, and the hydrogen is the lifting gas. So yeah, the total mass is 350 +30 = 380 kg.

The upward force is equal to the weight of the air displaced by the balloon. So the buoyant force is the volume of the balloon multiplied by the density of air times gravity. So the buoyant force F_buoyant = volume * density_air * g. 

Density of air is given as 1.3 g/liter, which is 1.3 kg/m³. Because 1 g/L is 1 kg/m³, so 1.3 g/L is 1.3 kg/m³. So F_buoyant = 300 m³ * 1.3 kg/m³ * g. Let me compute that. 300 *1.3 is 390, so 390 kg * g. Since g is approximately 9.8 m/s². So F_buoyant is 390 *9.8 = let me calculate that. 390 *9.8 = 3822 N. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, F_buoyant is (density_air) * volume * g. So that's 1.3 kg/m³ * 300 m³ * 9.8 m/s². So 1.3 *300 is 390, 390 *9.8 is 3822 N. So that's the upward force.

Now, the total weight of the system is the mass times gravity. The total mass is 380 kg, so weight is 380 kg *9.8 m/s² = 3724 N. So the net force upwards is F_buoyant - weight. So 3822 N - 3724 N = 98 N.

Then, acceleration a is F_net divided by mass. So a = 98 N / 380 kg. Let me compute that. 98/380 is approximately 0.2578 m/s². Hmm, looking at the options, B is 0.258 m/s². That looks like the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should recheck the mass of hydrogen. Volume is 300 m³, density is 0.1 kg/m³. So mass is 300 * 0.1 =30 kg. So total mass is 350 +30=380 kg. Yes. F_buoyant is 300 *1.3 *9.8 = 300 *12.74 = 3822 N. Weight is 380 *9.8 = 3724 N. Net force 3822-3724=98 N. Acceleration is 98/(380)=0.25789... which is approximately 0.258 m/s². So option B is correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the forces acting on the observation balloon and calculate the net force and resulting acceleration when it is released.

1. **Volume and Density of Hydrogen**:  
   The balloon has a volume of \( 300 \, \text{m}^3 \) and is filled with hydrogen of density \( 0.1 \, \text{g/L} \). Converting the density to \( \text{kg/m}^3 \):  
   \[
   0.1 \, \text{g/L} = 0.1 \, \text{kg/m}^3
   \]  
   The mass of the hydrogen is then:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of hydrogen} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 300 \, \text{m}^3 \times 0.1 \, \text{kg/m}^3 = 30 \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Total Mass of the System**:  
   The basket and passengers have a total mass of \( 350 \, \text{kg} \). Adding the mass of the hydrogen, the total mass of the system is:  
   \[
   \text{Total mass} = 350 \, \text{kg} + 30 \, \text{kg} = 380 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Buoyant Force**:  
   The upward buoyant force is equal to the weight of the air displaced by the balloon. The density of air is \( 1.3 \, \text{g/L} \), which is equivalent to \( 1.3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \). The buoyant force is:  
   \[
   F_{\text{buoyant}} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density of air} \times g = 300 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1.3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]  
   \[
   F_{\text{buoyant}} = 300 \times 1.3 \times 9.8 = 3822 \, \text{N}
   \]

4. **Weight of the System**:  
   The total weight of the system is:  
   \[
   \text{Weight} = \text{Total mass} \times g = 380 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 3724 \, \text{N}
   \]

5. **Net Force and Acceleration**:  
   The net upward force is the difference between the buoyant force and the weight:  
   \[
   F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{buoyant}} - \text{Weight} = 3822 \, \text{N} - 3724 \, \text{N} = 98 \, \text{N}
   \]  
   Using Newton's second law, the acceleration is:  
   \[
   a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{\text{Total mass}} = \frac{98 \, \text{N}}{380 \, \text{kg}} \approx 0.258 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:  
   Comparing the calculated acceleration with the options, the closest match is \( 0.258 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
