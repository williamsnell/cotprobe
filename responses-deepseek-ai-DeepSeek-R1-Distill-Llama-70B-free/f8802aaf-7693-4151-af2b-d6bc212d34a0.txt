Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about whether a medium behaves as a conductor or a dielectric at two different frequencies. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the key here is to compare the conductivity (σ) and the angular frequency times the permittivity (ωε) to determine the behavior.

Wait, right, the medium can act as a conductor when the conductivity dominates, meaning σ is much larger than ωε. Conversely, if ωε is much larger than σ, it behaves more like a dielectric. Oh, and there's this term called the relaxation frequency, I think. 

Wait, the angular frequency ω is 2πf. So for each frequency, I'll calculate ωε and compare it with σ.

Given:
σ = 0.3 mho/meter
ε_r = 60, so ε = ε_r * ε0. But wait, in the comparison, the actual ε value might not matter because we're just comparing σ and ωε, so perhaps the ratio will determine it.

Wait, no. Let me think: the condition is whether σ is greater than ωε. So for each frequency, I compute ωε and see how it compares to σ.

Let me calculate for each case.

First, (a) 100 kHz. So f = 100e3 Hz.

ω = 2πf = 2π * 100e3 ≈ 6.2832e5 rad/s.

ε = ε_r * ε0 = 60 * 8.854e-12 F/m ≈ 5.312e-10 F/m.

Then ωε = 6.2832e5 * 5.312e-10 ≈ let's compute that.

6.2832e5 = 628,320

5.312e-10 is 0.5312e-9.

Multiply 628,320 by 0.5312e-9: 628,320 * 0.5312e-9 = 

Wait, 628320 * 5.312e-10 → let me compute this.

5.312e-10 = 5.312 * 1e-10.

628320 * 5.312 = Let's approximate. 600,000 *5=3e6, 600,000 *0.312=187,200 → total about 3,187,200. So 3,187,200 *1e-10 = 3.1872e-4.

So ωε ≈ 3.1872e-4 S/m.

Wait, σ is 0.3 S/m. So comparing σ (0.3) with ωε (approx 3.187e-4).

σ is much larger than ωε. So at 100 kHz, the medium behaves like a conductor.

Now for (b) 3000 MHz. That's 3e9 Hz.

ω = 2π *3e9 ≈ 1.884e10 rad/s.

Same ε as before: 5.312e-10 F/m.

So ωε = 1.884e10 *5.312e-10 = Let's compute that.

Multiply 1.884e10 by 5.312e-10:

1.884e10 *5.312e-10 = (1.884 *5.312) * 1e0 = approx 10.0.

Wait, 1.884 *5 is about 9.42, and 1.884 *0.312 is about 0.588. So total around 10. So ωε ≈10 S/m.

Now, σ is 0.3 S/m. So ωε is much larger than σ here. So at 3000 MHz, the medium behaves like a dielectric.

Wait, but what about the options? Let me look again.

The options are about whether it's a conductor or dielectric.

So for part (a) 100 KHz: conductor.

Part (b) 3000 MHz: dielectric.

Looking at the options:

Looking at the options provided:

Option G: At 100 KHz, behaves like a good conductor; at 3000MHz, dielectric.

Option I: At 100 KHz, dielectric; 3000 MHz, good conductor. No, opposite.

Option F: 100 KHz dielectric, 3000 conductor. No.

Option G seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, at 100 KHz:

ω=2pi*1e5 ≈6.28e5 rad/s.

ε=60 *8.85e-12 = 5.31e-10 F/m.

ωε=6.28e5 *5.31e-10 = let me compute exact:

6.28e5 = 628000.

628000 * 5.31e-10 = (628 *5.31) *1e-5.

628 *5 = 3140, 628 *0.31 =194.68 → total about 3334.68.

3334.68e-5 = 0.0333468 S/m.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier! Oh no, that's a problem.

Wait no, wait: 628000 *5.31e-10 = 628,000 *5.31e-10 = (628,000 *5.31) *1e-10.

628,000 *5.31 = let's compute 628 *5.31 = approx 628*5=3140, 628*0.31=194.68 → 3334.68. So 333,468 (since 628,000 is 628*1,000, so 3334.68 *1,000=3,334,680).

Wait no, 628,000 is 628 * 1e3. So 628,000 *5.31e-10 = (628 *5.31) *1e3 * 1e-10 = (3334.68) * 1e-7 → 3.33468e-4.

So that's 0.000333468 S/m.

So σ is 0.3 S/m. So 0.3 is much larger than 0.000333, so yes, σ >> ωε, so it's a conductor.

At 3 GHz:

ω=2pi*3e9 = approx 1.884e10 rad/s.

ε=5.31e-10 F/m.

ωε=1.884e10 *5.31e-10 = (1.884 *5.31) *1e0 → approx 10. So 10 S/m.

Compare to σ=0.3. So 10 > 0.3, so ωε >> σ → dielectric.

So the medium acts as a conductor at 100 kHz and dielectric at 3 GHz.

Looking again at the options:

Option G says: At 100 KHz, good conductor; at 3 GHz, dielectric.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer is G.

To determine whether the medium behaves like a conductor or a dielectric at the given frequencies, we compare the conductivity (\( \sigma \)) and the product of angular frequency and permittivity (\( \omega \epsilon \)). If \( \sigma \gg \omega \epsilon \), the medium behaves like a conductor. Conversely, if \( \omega \epsilon \gg \sigma \), it behaves like a dielectric.

### Given:
- Conductivity: \( \sigma = 0.3 \, \text{S/m} \)
- Relative permittivity: \( \epsilon_r = 60 \)
- Permittivity of free space: \( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \)
- Permeability relative: \( \mu_r = 1 \)

### Calculations:
1. **At 100 kHz (\( f = 100 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz} \)):**
   - Angular frequency: \( \omega = 2 \pi f = 2 \pi \times 100 \times 10^3 \approx 6.283 \times 10^5 \, \text{rad/s} \)
   - Permittivity: \( \epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0 = 60 \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \approx 5.312 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{F/m} \)
   - \( \omega \epsilon = 6.283 \times 10^5 \times 5.312 \times 10^{-10} \approx 3.334 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{S/m} \)
   - Comparison: \( \sigma = 0.3 \, \text{S/m} \gg \omega \epsilon \approx 3.334 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{S/m} \)
   - Conclusion: The medium behaves like a **conductor**.

2. **At 3000 MHz (\( f = 3 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)):**
   - Angular frequency: \( \omega = 2 \pi f = 2 \pi \times 3 \times 10^9 \approx 1.884 \times 10^{10} \, \text{rad/s} \)
   - Permittivity: \( \epsilon = 5.312 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{F/m} \)
   - \( \omega \epsilon = 1.884 \times 10^{10} \times 5.312 \times 10^{-10} \approx 10 \, \text{S/m} \)
   - Comparison: \( \omega \epsilon = 10 \, \text{S/m} \gg \sigma = 0.3 \, \text{S/m} \)
   - Conclusion: The medium behaves like a **dielectric**.

### Final Answer:
At 100 kHz, the medium behaves like a **good conductor**, and at 3000 MHz, it behaves like a **dielectric**.

The correct option is **G**.
