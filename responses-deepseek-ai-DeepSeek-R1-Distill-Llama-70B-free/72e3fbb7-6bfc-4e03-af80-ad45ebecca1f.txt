Okay, so I have this problem where James Higley deposits $2,000 for 2 years in an account that pays 4% per year, compounded quarterly. I need to find out how much the money will accumulate to, assuming he doesn't withdraw any interest. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the periods. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year. So each quarter, the interest is added, and the next quarter's interest is calculated on the new amount.

The formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($2,000 in this case).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 4% would be 0.04).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (quarterly is 4).
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (2 years here).

Let me plug in the numbers. P is $2000, r is 0.04, n is 4, t is 2.

So A = 2000 * (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*2).

Let me compute the inside part first. 0.04 divided by 4 is 0.01. So each quarter, the interest rate is 1%.

Then, 1 + 0.01 is 1.01. Now, how many times is this compounded? 4 times a year for 2 years, so 4 * 2 = 8 times. So 1.01 raised to the 8th power.

Wait, what's 1.01^8? Let me calculate that. I think I remember that 1.01^8 is approximately 1.082856. Let me check: 1.01^2 is 1.0201, then ^4 is (1.0201)^2 which is around 1.040604, and then squared again would be about 1.082856. Yeah, that sounds right.

So then, A = 2000 * 1.082856. Let me multiply that. 2000 * 1.082856. Let's see, 2000 times 1 is 2000, 2000 times 0.08 is 160, and 2000 times 0.002856 is 5.712. So adding them up: 2000 + 160 is 2160, plus 5.712 gives 2165.712. So approximately $2,165.71.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. Oh wait, 1.01^8, yeah that's correct because 4 quarters times 2 years is 8. So the calculation should be right.

Looking back at the options: Option I is $2,165.71. So that's probably the correct answer.

Alternatively, I could compute it step by step each quarter to make sure. Let's try that.

Principal is $2000. Each quarter, it's multiplied by 1.01.

After 1st quarter: 2000 * 1.01 = 2020.
2nd quarter: 2020 * 1.01 = 2040.20.
3rd quarter: 2040.20 * 1.01 = 2060.80.
4th quarter: 2060.80 * 1.01 = 2081.60. So that's after one year, $2,081.60.

Now the second year:

5th quarter: 2081.60 * 1.01 = 2102.816.
6th quarter: 2102.816 * 1.01 = 2124.48416.
7th quarter: 2124.48416 * 1.01 ≈ 2146.628 (approx).
8th quarter: 2146.628 * 1.01 ≈ 2165.716. Which is about $2,165.72. So that matches what I calculated before.

So yeah, the correct answer should be I: $2,165.71.

To calculate the amount accumulated in James Higley's account after 2 years with quarterly compounding, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$2,000 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.04 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 4 \) (compounded quarterly),
- \( t = 2 \) (time in years).

Substituting the values:

\[
A = 2000 \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 2}
\]

First, calculate the quarterly interest rate:

\[
\frac{0.04}{4} = 0.01
\]

Then, calculate the total number of compounding periods:

\[
4 \cdot 2 = 8
\]

Now, compute \( (1 + 0.01)^8 \):

\[
1.01^8 \approx 1.082856
\]

Finally, calculate the accumulated amount:

\[
A = 2000 \cdot 1.082856 \approx 2165.71
\]

Thus, the accumulated amount after 2 years is approximately **\$2,165.71**. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: \$2,165.71**
