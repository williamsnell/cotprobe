Question:

A research project compared the performance of learning disabled and of normal students on ten scales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ~ Revised (WISC-R). Ten univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were run to test for differences between the two groups, but use of a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) would have been more desirable because MANOVA

Options:

A: can account for more variables simultaneously
B: is a more recent development in statistical analysis
C: reduces the need for subsequent regression analysis
D: can handle larger datasets more effectively
E: usually offers greater protection against Type Il error
F: requires less computational power
G: usually offers greater protection against a Type I error
H: allows for more detailed individual participant analysis
I: is conceptually and computationally a simpler and more efficient approach

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about statistics, specifically comparing ANOVA and MANOVA. Hmm, I remember that ANOVA is analysis of variance and MANOVA is the multivariate version. Let me think through this.

The question says a study used ten ANOVAs on ten scales of the WISC-R test for two groups: learning disabled and normal students. But the question suggests that MANOVA would have been better. Why is that?

I remember that when you have multiple dependent variables, like these ten scales, using multiple ANOVAs can lead to an inflated Type I error rate. Because each ANOVA is a separate test, the more you run, the higher the chance of getting a false positive. That's the problem with doing multiple tests without correction. So MANOVA comes into play here.

Wait, what does MANOVA do? It tests the differences between groups across all dependent variables simultaneously. Oh right, and by doing that, it controls the overall Type I error rate. So instead of each ANOVA having an alpha level (like 0.05), which could accumulate across ten tests, MANOVA keeps the overall alpha at 0.05, thereby reducing the risk of Type I errors.

Looking at the options now. Option G says MANOVA offers greater protection against Type I error. That sounds right because it accounts for the multiple variables together, preventing the error rate from inflating. 

Other options: Option A says can account for more variables simultaneously. Well, yeah, that's what multivariate means, but the reason it's more desirable here is because of the error rate, not just handling more variables. So the reason isn't just about handling variables, but the protection against errors.

Option E is about Type II error, which is the oppositeâ€”failing to detect a true effect. I don't think MANOVA specifically addresses that more than ANOVA; it's more about Type I. So E isn't correct.

Options B, D, F, H, I, C: Let me think. B says MANOVA is more recent. No, I think both have been around for a while, but I'm not sure. Maybe not the main point here. C says reduces need for regression. Not directly related, I think. D is about handling larger datasets, which could be true computationally, but the main advantage in this context is error protection. F says requires less computational power. I'm not sure, but when I think about it, MANOVA might actually require more computation because it deals with multiple variables and their covariance. So F might not be correct.

G is looking correct. Option I says it's simpler and more efficient. I'm not sure; I think it's more complex because it handles multiple variables, but perhaps computationally more efficient in terms of overall analysis. But the key point here is about Type I errors.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: usually offers greater protection against a Type I error.

The question compares the use of multiple ANOVAs versus MANOVA in analyzing ten scales of the WISC-R test. While ANOVA tests each scale independently, MANOVA is more appropriate when dealing with multiple dependent variables because it analyzes them simultaneously. This approach is particularly advantageous because it reduces the risk of inflating the Type I error rate, which can occur when performing multiple separate ANOVAs. By using MANOVA, the overall Type I error rate is controlled, making it a more desirable method in this context.

Option G correctly identifies that MANOVA offers greater protection against Type I error, which is the primary reason it is more suitable for this scenario. Other options either address less relevant advantages or are incorrect in this context.

Answer: G
