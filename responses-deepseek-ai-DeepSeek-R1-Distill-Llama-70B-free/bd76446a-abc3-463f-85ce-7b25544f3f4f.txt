Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Christian denominations, and I need to figure out which one promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct letter. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should understand what the question is asking. "Stripped-down Christianity" probably refers to a denomination that emphasizes simplicity, maybe removing what they see as unnecessary traditions or practices, focusing on core beliefs and practices. So I'm looking for a group known for simplicity in their worship, doctrine, or practices.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Roman Catholic. I know Roman Catholicism is one of the largest and most traditional Christian denominations. They have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. So they're probably not the stripped-down type.

Option B: Lutherans. Lutheranism came from the Protestant Reformation, led by Martin Luther. They do have some simplified practices compared to Catholics, like fewer sacraments, but I'm not sure if they're considered stripped-down. They still have structured liturgies and traditions.

Option C: Methodists. Methodism, founded by John Wesley, emphasizes personal holiness and service. Their services can vary, but I don't think they're known for being extremely minimalistic. They might have a more structured approach than some other denominations.

Option D: Greek Orthodox. This is another very traditional denomination with a rich liturgical life, icons, and a strong emphasis on tradition. Definitely not stripped-down.

Option E: Quakers. Quakers, or the Society of Friends, are known for their simple meetings where they wait in silence for the Holy Spirit to speak. They have minimal structure, no formal sermons, and reject many traditional church practices. This seems like a strong candidate for stripped-down Christianity.

Option F: Seventh-day Adventists. They have specific practices like observing Saturday as the Sabbath, and they emphasize certain doctrines like the second coming. Their worship might be more structured with sermons and specific teachings, so maybe not the stripped-down version.

Option G: Baptists. Baptists are known for believer's baptism by immersion and a more simplistic approach to worship. They often have less formal liturgy compared to some other denominations, focusing on the Bible and personal conversion. This could fit the idea of stripped-down.

Option H: Mormons. Mormons, or the Latter-day Saints, have a distinct set of beliefs and practices, including additional scriptures and a strong emphasis on family and certain rituals. Their services are structured and have specific doctrines, so probably not stripped-down.

Option I: Puritans. Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic remnants. They emphasized simplicity in worship and strict adherence to the Bible, rejecting many traditions. This definitely fits the stripped-down idea. But wait, the Puritans were more of a historical movement within Anglicanism, and as a distinct denomination, maybe they're not one of the options. Or are they?

Option J: Anglicans. Anglicanism, or the Church of England, has a broad range of practices. Some are more high church (closer to Catholic traditions) and others are low church, which might be simpler. But as a whole, they have a structured liturgy and hierarchy, so perhaps not the most stripped-down.

Now, considering the options, Quakers (E) and Baptists (G) are both possibilities. Also, Puritans (I), but I'm not sure if they count as a denomination today or if they're considered part of Anglicanism.

Wait, the question is about a denomination that exists today. Puritans were a historical movement, but some of their ideas influenced groups like the Baptists and others. So looking at current denominations, Quakers and Baptists are more likely.

Between E and G, which is more stripped-down? Quakers have very simple worship services with silence and no formal liturgy. Baptists have more structured services with sermons, hymns, etc., but still simpler than, say, Catholics or Anglicans.

So which one is known for promoting a stripped-down version? I think Quakers might be more so because of their minimalist approach to worship and rejection of many traditional practices.

Wait, but the question says "promotes a stripped-down Christianity." Another thought: some might associate Baptists with a more fundamentalist approach, but stripped-down could also mean minimalism in practices.

Alternatively, the Puritans were all about stripping away what they saw as unnecessary, but they're not a current denomination. So the options are E and G.

I think Quakers are the best fit because they are known for their simplicity in worship and daily life, avoiding many traditional elements.

The question asks which Christian denomination promotes a "stripped-down Christianity," referring to a group that emphasizes simplicity, core beliefs, and minimal practices. To determine the answer, each option is analyzed:

- **A: Roman Catholic**: Known for its rich traditions, sacraments, and hierarchical structure, this is not a stripped-down denomination.
- **B: Lutherans**: While they simplified some practices compared to Catholics, they still maintain structured liturgies and traditions.
- **C: Methodists**: Emphasize personal holiness and service but are not known for minimalism.
- **D: Greek Orthodox**: A highly traditional denomination with rich liturgical practices, far from stripped-down.
- **E: Quakers**: Known for their simplicity, silent worship meetings, and rejection of formal structures, making them a strong candidate.
- **F: Seventh-day Adventists**: Have specific practices and structured worship, so not stripped-down.
- **G: Baptists**: Simplistic in some ways, but their services include sermons and hymns, making them less minimalistic than Quakers.
- **H: Mormons**: Distinct beliefs and structured practices, not stripped-down.
- **I: Puritans**: A historical movement emphasizing simplicity, but not a current denomination.
- **J: Anglicans**: Broad range of practices, but generally structured and traditional.

Between Quakers (E) and Baptists (G), Quakers are more minimalist due to their silent worship and rejection of formal liturgy. While Puritans (I) historically promoted simplicity, they are not a current denomination. Thus, the best answer is **E: Quakers**.

Answer: E
