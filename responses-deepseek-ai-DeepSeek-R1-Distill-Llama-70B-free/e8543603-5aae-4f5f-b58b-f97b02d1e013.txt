Okay, so I have this problem about an airplane taking off, and I need to find the angle of attack and the power required. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my aerodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem gives me the weight as 3000 lbf. Oh wait, that's pounds-force. I remember that weight is mass times gravity, so maybe I'll need to find the mass in slugs because the density is given in slug/ft³. Oh right, because in the imperial system, mass is in slugs.

The wing area is 300 ft². Takeoff speed is 100 ft/s. The lift and drag coefficients vary with the angle of attack, α. The formulas are C_L = 0.35(1 + 0.2α) and C_D = 0.008(1 + α), with α in degrees. The air density is 0.00238 slug/ft³.

So, I think the main idea here is to find the angle of attack that allows the airplane to take off at the desired speed. Takeoff means that the lift must equal the weight, right? Because during takeoff, the airplane needs to overcome its weight to lift off.

Wait, no, wait. At takeoff, the plane is moving along the runway, so the lift must at least equal the weight for it to leave the ground. So, lift equals weight. So, I can use that to find the required angle of attack.

So, the lift force L is (1/2) * density * velocity squared * wing area * C_L. And that should equal the weight, which is 3000 lbf.

Let me write the equation:

(1/2) * rho * v² * S * C_L = W

Plugging in the numbers:

0.5 * 0.00238 * (100)^2 * 300 * C_L = 3000

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, compute 0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119.

Then, 100 squared is 10,000. So, 0.00119 * 10,000 = 11.9.

Multiply by 300 (wing area): 11.9 * 300 = 3570.

So, 3570 * C_L = 3000.

Therefore, C_L = 3000 / 3570 ≈ 0.8403.

Hmm, C_L is about 0.84. Now, I need to find the angle of attack α that gives this C_L. The given formula is C_L = 0.35(1 + 0.2α).

So, 0.35*(1 + 0.2α) = 0.8403.

Let me solve for α.

Divide both sides by 0.35: 1 + 0.2α ≈ 0.8403 / 0.35 = 2.4.

So, 0.2α ≈ 2.4 - 1 = 1.4.

Therefore, α ≈ 1.4 / 0.2 = 7 degrees.

Wait, that gives me α around 7 degrees. But looking at the options, the closest is E which is 7 degrees, 41.5 hp, or maybe another option.

But wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the lift equation again.

Lift L = (1/2) rho v² S C_L.

Set that equal to W=3000 lbf.

So,

C_L = (2 W) / (rho v² S).

Plugging in:

2 * 3000 = 6000.

Divide by rho which is 0.00238, v squared is 10000, S is 300.

So, denominator: 0.00238 * 10000 * 300 = 0.00238 * 3e6 = 7140.

So, C_L = 6000 / 7140 ≈ 0.8403.

Yes, same as before. So, C_L ≈ 0.8403.

Then, 0.35*(1 + 0.2α) = 0.8403.

So, 1 + 0.2α = 0.8403 / 0.35 = 2.401.

0.2α = 1.401 → α = 7.005 degrees, approximately 7 degrees.

So, angle of attack is about 7 degrees. Looking at the options, option E is 7 degrees, 41.5 hp.

But wait, the question also asks for the power required for takeoff. So, I need to calculate the power as well.

Power is the product of thrust and velocity. But wait, during takeoff, the engine provides thrust which must overcome drag. So, at takeoff, thrust equals drag because the plane is moving at constant speed. So, Thrust = Drag.

So, Drag D = (1/2) rho v² S C_D.

Then, Power P = D * v.

So, let's compute C_D first. C_D = 0.008*(1 + α). Since α is 7 degrees, C_D = 0.008*(8) = 0.064.

Wait, 1 + 7 = 8. So, 0.008 *8 = 0.064.

Then, D = 0.5 * 0.00238 * 100^2 * 300 * 0.064.

Compute step by step.

0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119.

100^2 is 10,000 → 0.00119 * 10,000 = 11.9.

Multiply by 300 → 11.9 * 300 = 3570.

Multiply by 0.064 → 3570 *0.064.

Hmm, 3570 * 0.06 is 214.2, 3570 *0.004 is 14.28. So total 228.48 lbf.

So, Drag is 228.48 lbf.

Power P = D * v = 228.48 lb * 100 ft/s.

Wait, but power is in horsepower. So, I need to convert that.

First, 1 horsepower is 550 lb-ft/s.

So, P = (228.48 lb * 100 ft/s) / 550 (ft-lb/s per hp).

Compute numerator: 228.48 * 100 = 22848 lb·ft/s.

Divide by 550: 22848 / 550 ≈ 41.537 hp.

Which is approximately 41.5 hp.

So, angle of attack is 7 degrees, power is 41.5 hp. That's option E.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the angle of attack and the power required for takeoff. The key equations and steps are as follows:

1. **Lift Equation**:  
   The lift force \( L \) must equal the weight \( W \) during takeoff. Using the formula:  
   \[
   L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
   \]  
   where \( \rho = 0.00238 \, \text{slug/ft}^3 \), \( v = 100 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( S = 300 \, \text{ft}^2 \), and \( W = 3000 \, \text{lbf} \). Rearranging for \( C_L \):  
   \[
   C_L = \frac{2W}{\rho v^2 S}
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   C_L = \frac{2(3000)}{0.00238(100)^2(300)} = \frac{6000}{7140} \approx 0.8403
   \]  

2. **Angle of Attack**:  
   The lift coefficient \( C_L \) is given as \( C_L = 0.35(1 + 0.2\alpha) \). Solving for \( \alpha \):  
   \[
   0.35(1 + 0.2\alpha) = 0.8403
   \]  
   \[
   1 + 0.2\alpha = \frac{0.8403}{0.35} \approx 2.401
   \]  
   \[
   0.2\alpha = 2.401 - 1 = 1.401 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \alpha = \frac{1.401}{0.2} \approx 7.005^\circ
   \]  
   Thus, the angle of attack is approximately \( 7^\circ \).

3. **Power Calculation**:  
   Power is required to overcome drag during takeoff. The drag force \( D \) is given by:  
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_D
   \]  
   where \( C_D = 0.008(1 + \alpha) \). Substituting \( \alpha = 7^\circ \):  
   \[
   C_D = 0.008(1 + 7) = 0.008(8) = 0.064
   \]  
   Now calculate \( D \):  
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}(0.00238)(100)^2(300)(0.064)
   \]  
   \[
   D = 0.00119 \cdot 10,000 \cdot 300 \cdot 0.064 = 3570 \cdot 0.064 = 228.48 \, \text{lbf}
   \]  
   Power \( P \) is the product of thrust (equal to drag) and velocity:  
   \[
   P = D \cdot v = 228.48 \cdot 100 = 22848 \, \text{ft-lbf/s}
   \]  
   Converting to horsepower (\( 1 \, \text{hp} = 550 \, \text{ft-lbf/s} \)):  
   \[
   P = \frac{22848}{550} \approx 41.5 \, \text{hp}
   \]  

4. **Final Answer**:  
   The angle of attack is \( 7^\circ \), and the power required is \( 41.5 \, \text{hp} \). This matches option **E**.
