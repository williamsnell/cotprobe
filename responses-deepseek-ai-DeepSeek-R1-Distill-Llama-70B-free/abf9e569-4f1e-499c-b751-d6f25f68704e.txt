Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the Phillips curve. Hmm, I remember that the Phillips curve has something to do with inflation and unemployment. Let me think. From what I learned, the Phillips curve shows the relationship between the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation. 

Wait, right, there are two versions: the short-run and the long-run Phillips curves. I think in the short run, when unemployment is low, inflation tends to rise. That makes the short-run curve downward sloping because as unemployment goes down, inflation goes up. But wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, the original Phillips curve was that lower unemployment leads to higher wage inflation, which feeds into price inflation. So the curve is downward slopingâ€”unemployment on the x-axis, inflation on the y-axis. So when unemployment is lower, inflation is higher; the curve slopes downward.

But then what about the long run? I remember something about the long-run Phillips curve being vertical. Because in the long run, the economy adjusts, and the natural rate of unemployment is where the economy settles. So in the long run, the Phillips curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment. That means no matter what the inflation rate is, when the economy is at the natural rate, changes in inflation don't affect unemployment in the long run. So the long-run curve doesn't have a slope; it's a vertical line.

So the main difference is that the short-run curve is downward sloping, and the long-run is vertical. Now looking at the options, let's see. The options are A to J.

Option A: Short-run downward, long-run horizontal. Wait, no, I thought the long-run is vertical, not horizontal. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Short-run downward, long-run vertical. That sounds right. So B would be correct.

Option C: Short-run upward, long-run vertical. No, because short-run is downward.

Option D: Short-run horizontal, long-run vertical. No, short-run is not horizontal.

Option E: Short-run vertical, long-run horizontal. That's the opposite of what I think.

Option F: Both sloped but opposite. No, the long-run is vertical.

Option G: Short horizontal, long upward. Doesn't fit.

Option H: Short upward, long downward. No.

Option I: Both vertical. Probably not, because the short-run isn't vertical.

Option J: Both upward. No, the short-run is downward.

So the correct answer should be option B. Let me just double-check. Short-run: downward sloping because lower unemployment leads to higher inflation. Long-run: vertical at the natural rate of unemployment, meaning that in the long run, inflation doesn't depend on unemployment. So yes, B is correct.

The Phillips curve illustrates the relationship between unemployment and inflation. In the short run, the curve is downward sloping, meaning lower unemployment corresponds to higher inflation. However, in the long run, the Phillips curve becomes vertical, indicating that unemployment is determined by structural factors (the natural rate) and is independent of inflation. This vertical long-run curve reflects the idea that inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The long-run Phillips curve is vertical, not horizontal.
- **B**: Correct. The short-run curve is downward sloping, and the long-run curve is vertical.
- **C**: Incorrect. The short-run curve is not upward sloping.
- **D**: Incorrect. The short-run curve is not horizontal.
- **E**: Incorrect. The short-run curve is not vertical, and the long-run curve is not horizontal.
- **F**: Incorrect. The long-run curve is not upward sloping.
- **G**: Incorrect. The short-run curve is not horizontal, and the long-run curve is not upward sloping.
- **H**: Incorrect. The short-run curve is not upward sloping, and the long-run curve is not downward sloping.
- **I**: Incorrect. Only the long-run curve is vertical.
- **J**: Incorrect. The short-run curve is not upward sloping.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
