Okay, so I have this accounting question about accruals and deferrals. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

I remember that accrual accounting is different from cash basis accounting. In cash basis, you record transactions when cash is exchanged. But accrual accounting recognizes revenue and expenses when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the cash moves. So that's where accruals and deferrals come in.

Accruals and deferrals are adjustments made to match the revenue and expenses to the correct period. I think accruals are when you've earned revenue but haven't received the cash yet, or when you've incurred an expense but haven't paid for it. Like, if you provide a service in December but the client pays in January, you still record the revenue in December as an accrual.

Then there's deferrals. I'm a bit more confused here. Deferrals are for when you've received cash or paid cash in advance. So, for example, if a client pays you in December for services you'll provide in January, you can't record that as revenue in December. Instead, you defer it until January when you actually provide the service. So deferrals are about delaying the recognition.

Wait, so what's the difference again? Accruals are about recognizing before the cash flow, and deferrals are about delaying recognition until later.

Looking at the options, the question is about what each concept is concerned with. Let's go through each option.

Option A says accruals are current cash receipts/payments, deferrals are expected future. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Because I thought accruals are about expected future, not current.

Option B: Accruals are future, deferrals current. Wait, no. Accruals are about future cash, but deferrals are about when cash was received or paid but the event is in the future. So deferrals relate to cash that's already happened but relates to future events.

Option H: Accruals are expected future, deferrals past. That seems possible. Because accruals are expecting cash in the future (like accounts receivable), deferrals are when cash was paid or received in the past but relates to future periods (like prepaids or unearned revenue).

Wait, let me think again. Accruals can be either revenue or expenses that are recognized before cash changes hands. So for an accrual, like accrued revenue, it's when you've earned the money but haven't received it yet. So that's expecting future cash. Accrued expenses are when you've used a service but haven't paid yet, so expecting to pay in the future.

Deferrals involve situations where cash has already been received or paid, but the related revenue or expense hasn't been recognized yet. So for example, deferred revenue (unearned revenue) is when cash is received but the service isn't provided yet. So it's a deferral because the cash was received in the past, but the revenue is for future periods.

So in terms of cash timing, accruals are about future cash flows (expected) and deferrals are about past cash flows that relate to future events.

So looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option H says: Accruals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments while deferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments.

Yes, that makes sense. Because accruals are expecting future cash, and deferrals are handling cash that's already happened but affects the future.

So the correct answer should be H.

Accrual accounting involves recognizing revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged. Accruals and deferrals are key adjustments used to match these economic events to the correct period.

- **Accruals** involve recognizing revenues or expenses before the related cash flow occurs. For example, accrued revenue is recognized when earned but not yet received, and accrued expenses are recognized when incurred but not yet paid. Thus, accruals are concerned with **expected future cash receipts and payments**.

- **Deferrals** involve delaying the recognition of revenues or expenses until the related event occurs, even though cash has already been received or paid. For example, deferred revenue (unearned revenue) is recognized when cash is received in advance for goods or services to be delivered later. Similarly, prepaid expenses are recognized when cash is paid in advance for goods or services to be received later. Therefore, deferrals are concerned with **past cash receipts and payments** that relate to future events.

Given this understanding, the correct description is that **accruals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments, while deferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments**.
