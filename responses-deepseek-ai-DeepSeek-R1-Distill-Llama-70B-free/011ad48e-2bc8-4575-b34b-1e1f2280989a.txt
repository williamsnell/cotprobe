Okay, so I've got this problem about a centrifugal pump shaft supported by a journal bearing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the question gives me a bunch of parameters. The bearing is a 180-degree central partial journal bearing. So it's a partial bearing, meaning it doesn't wrap all the way around the shaft, just 180 degrees. Diameter is 3 inches. Oh wait, diameter, so the radius would be 1.5 inches, right? And the length is 6 inches. Clearance between the shaft and bearing is 0.003 inches. They're using SAE 20 oil, and the minimum oil film thickness is 0.002 inches.

The shaft rotates at 1000 rpm. The bearing is subjected to a pressure of 50 psi based on the projected area. Wait, projected area. Oh, right, projected area would be the length times the diameter, I think. So for a journal bearing, the projected area is L times D, where L is the length and D is the diameter.

The question asks for two things: the average temperature of the oil film and the power developed due to friction. The options are given, so I need to compute both values and match them to the options.

First, I think I should find the power loss due to friction, which probably relates to the torque. Then, the temperature might come from the heat generated due to this power loss, which in turn depends on the oil's properties.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about where to start. Maybe I should recall the formula for power loss in a journal bearing.

I remember that for a journal bearing, the power loss (P) can be calculated using the formula:

P = π * N * (D * L) * f * (1/12π²) * (μ * (D/2)^2 * N) / c^3 

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the power loss in a journal bearing is given by P = (π^2 * μ * N^2 * D^3 * L) / (12 * c * (1 - (r/c)^2)) )

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the Sommerfeld number. Oh right, the Sommerfeld number is used to determine the performance of hydrodynamic journal bearings.

The Sommerfeld number (S) is given by S = (r c^2 ω μ) / (P L D), where:
- r is the radius,
- c is the radial clearance,
- ω is the angular velocity,
- μ is the dynamic viscosity,
- P is the pressure (load per unit area),
- L is the length,
- D is the diameter.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I remember is:

The power loss due to friction in a journal bearing is given by:

P = (2 π^3 μ N^2 D^3 L) / (60 c (1 - ε^2)^0.5 )

Where ε is the eccentricity ratio, but I might not have enough information about that here.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think. The bearing is a partial bearing, 180 degrees. So it's a half-circle. So the bearing is only on one side, which might affect the calculation of the pressure.

Wait, the pressure given is 50 psi on the projected area. So the projected area is the area over which the pressure acts. Projected area for a partial bearing is the length times the width. For a 180-degree bearing, the width is the diameter, so the projected area is L * D. So the load W is P * A, where A is L*D. So W = P * L * D.

Wait, but for a full journal bearing, the load is (pressure) * (projected area), but for a partial bearing like 180 degrees, I think the same applies. So W = P * L * D.

Wait, the problem says "based on the projected area", so yeah, that makes sense.

So W = 50 psi * (6 in) * (3 in) = 50 * 6 *3 = 900 lb. Because psi is lb per square inch, so 50 lb/in² * 18 in² (since 6*3=18) gives 900 lb.

Wait no, wait: 6 inches is the length, and 3 inches is the diameter, so the projected area is L*D = 6*3 = 18 in². So W = 50 psi * 18 in² = 900 lb.

But wait, the unit of pressure is psi, which is lb per square inch. So 50 lb/in² * 18 in² = 900 lb force.

So W is 900 lbf.

Now, the next thing is to find the coefficient of friction in the bearing, which would allow me to compute the frictional torque and then the power loss.

The coefficient of friction (f) can be found using the formula:

f = (π * sqrt(μ * η)) / (4 * c * sqrt(W/(L*D))) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the coefficient of friction for a journal bearing is given by:

f = (2 c / h_m) ) * (1 + 2 (h_m / c)) )

Wait, this seems more familiar. Wait, no, maybe another approach. For a journal bearing with a given eccentricity, but I don't have the eccentricity here.

Alternatively, I think that for a centrally pivoted bearing (central partial bearing), the minimum film thickness is h_m, which is given as 0.002 inches. The clearance is 0.003 inches, so h_m is less than the clearance, which makes sense.

Wait, the minimum oil film thickness is h_m = 0.002 in. So the clearance c is 0.003 in. So the ratio h_m/c is 2/3.

Wait, but maybe I should use the formula for the coefficient of friction in such a bearing.

I think the formula for frictional torque for a partial journal bearing is:

T = (2 W L c) / (D * h_m )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the torque could be calculated as T = f * W * R, where R is the radius.

Wait, but without knowing f, that might not help.

Alternatively, the power loss can be calculated from the shear stress in the oil film.

The shear stress τ in the oil film is given by τ = (μ * ω) / h_m, where ω is the angular velocity.

Wait, but angular velocity ω is 2πN, where N is in revolutions per second.

Wait, but the rotational speed is 1000 rpm, which is 1000/60 ≈ 16.6667 revolutions per second.

So ω = 2π * (1000/60) ≈ 104.72 rad/s.

The shear stress would then be τ = μ * ω / h_m.

But I don't know μ, the dynamic viscosity of SAE 20 oil. Wait, I think SAE 20 oil at certain temperatures has a known viscosity. Wait, but the temperature is what we're trying to find, so maybe I need to make an assumption here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the power loss using another approach.

Wait, I remember that for a centrally pivoted bearing (which this seems to be, given it's a 180-degree partial bearing), the power loss can be calculated using the formula:

P = (μ * N^2 * D^4 * L) / (60 * c * (1 - (r/c)^2) )

Wait, but I'm not confident about this formula. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach is to use the Petroff's theory for journal bearings. Petroff's theory applies to partially lubricated bearings, and it's used to find the coefficient of friction.

Petroff's formula for coefficient of friction is:

f = (2 π² μ N (D/2)^2) / (W (1 - (d_i/d_o)^2) )

Wait, no, that's for a different scenario. Alternatively, the formula from Petroff is:

f = (π μ D N) / (60 W) * (D/(2 c)) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Petroff's formula for the coefficient of friction in a journal bearing is:

f = (2 π μ D N (R) ) / (W (1 - (r/c)^2) )

Wait, but I'm not recalling correctly. Maybe I should think in terms of the power loss.

Wait, the power loss in a journal bearing is given by P = (2 π^3 μ N^2 D^3 L) / (60 c (1 - ε^2)^0.5 )

But without knowing the eccentricity ratio ε, I can't use this formula.

Alternatively, for a partial bearing, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I should approach it using the formula for the power loss in a partial journal bearing.

I found in some notes that the power loss (P) for a 180-degree partial bearing is:

P = (μ * D * L * N^2 * π ) / ( 60 * (c) * sqrt(1 - (1 - h_m/c)^2) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the shear force and then the power.

The shear force on the bearing would be the shear stress multiplied by the area over which it acts. The shear stress is μ * angular velocity / film thickness.

So, shear stress τ = μ ω / h_m.

The area A over which this shear occurs is the length L times the diameter D, but wait, no, because in a partial bearing, the area in contact is only a part of the full circle. For a 180-degree bearing, the width is the same as the diameter, so the area is L * D.

Wait, but no, the area over which the shear acts is the surface area of the bearing that's in contact with the shaft. So for a 180-degree bearing, the surface area is the length L times half the circumference. So half the circumference is π D/2. So the area is L * π D/2.

Wait, but the shear stress is acting on the entire area that's in contact. So the shear force F would be τ * A.

F = τ * A = (μ ω / h_m) * (L * π D / 2 )

But then, the power loss would be the shear force multiplied by the velocity at the shaft's surface. The velocity v is ω * R, where R is D/2.

So, P = F * v = [ (μ ω / h_m) * (L π D / 2) ) ] * (ω R )

Simplify:

P = (μ ω L π D / (2 h_m )) * (ω R )

Since R is D/2,

P = (μ ω L π D / (2 h_m )) * ( ω D / 2 )

So,

P = (μ ω² L π D² ) / (4 h_m )

Wait, let me check the units. μ is in lb-s/in², ω is in rad/s (s⁻¹), L is in inches, D in inches, h_m in inches. So putting it all together:

μ [lb·s/in²] * ω² [1/s²] * L [in] * D² [in²] / h_m [in]

So the units would be (lb·s/in²) * (1/s²) * in * in² / in → (lb·s * in² )/(s² in²) ) → lb·s/(s²) → lb/(s). Which is power in horsepower? Wait, no, because 1 horsepower is 550 lb-ft/s, and 1 lb-in/s is 1/8 hp. Because 1 ft = 12 in, so 1 lb-ft/s = 12 lb-in/s. So 1 hp = 550 lb-ft/s = 550 * 12 lb-in/s = 6600 lb-in/s.

So if our calculation for P is in lb-in/s, then to get horsepower, we divide by 6600.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula I derived is:

P = (μ * ω² * L * π * D²) / (4 * h_m )

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

μ for SAE 20 oil. Wait, I need to know the viscosity. At what temperature? Oh, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps I can take a typical value. SAE 20 oil has a viscosity around 200 SSU (Saybolt Seconds Universal) at 100°F. But I might need to convert that to dynamic viscosity.

Wait, 1 SSU is approximately 0.00000209 lb·s/in². So 200 SSU would be 200 * 0.00000209 ≈ 0.000418 lb·s/in².

Wait, but I'm not certain about this conversion. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise approach, but maybe for the sake of this problem, the exact value might be given in a table or something. Alternatively, perhaps the temperature is around 140°F, so maybe we can adjust.

But perhaps I can proceed with this value. Let me take μ = 0.000418 lb·s/in².

Wait, but let me check. SAE 20 oil at 100°F has a kinematic viscosity of about 200 centistokes. Kinematic viscosity ν = μ / ρ, where ρ is the density. For oil, ρ is around 0.03 lb/in³ (since water is 0.036 lb/in³, and oil is lighter). So μ = ν * ρ.

So if ν is 200 centistokes, which is 200 × 0.000001 m²/s = 2e-5 m²/s.

Wait, but I'm getting confused with metric units. Let me convert centistokes to in²/s.

1 stoke = 1 cm²/s = (0.1 in)^2 / s = 0.01 in²/s. So 1 centistoke = 0.0001 in²/s.

So 200 centistokes = 200 * 0.0001 = 0.02 in²/s.

So ν = 0.02 in²/s.

Then μ = ν * ρ. Taking ρ as approximately 0.03 lb/in³ (since oil is lighter than water, which is about 0.036 lb/in³), so μ = 0.02 * 0.03 = 0.0006 lb·s/in².

Wait, but earlier I had 0.000418, now it's 0.0006. Hmm, perhaps I should use 0.0006 lb·s/in² as a better approximation.

Proceeding with μ = 0.0006 lb·s/in².

Now, the other variables:

ω = 2π * N/60, N is 1000 rpm.

So ω = 2 * π * 1000 / 60 ≈ 104.72 rad/s.

L = 6 inches.

D = 3 inches.

h_m = 0.002 inches.

So plug into the formula:

P = (μ * ω² * L * π * D²) / (4 * h_m )

Calculate each part step by step.

μ = 0.0006 lb·s/in².

ω² ≈ (104.72)^2 ≈ 10,963 rad²/s².

L = 6 in.

π ≈ 3.1416.

D² = 3² = 9 in².

4 * h_m = 4 * 0.002 = 0.008 in.

So numerator:

0.0006 * 10,963 * 6 * 3.1416 * 9.

Let me compute each multiplication step.

0.0006 * 10,963 = approx 6.5778.

6.5778 * 6 = 39.4668.

39.4668 * 3.1416 ≈ let's compute 39.4668 * 3 = 118.4004, 39.4668 * 0.1416 ≈ 5.588. So total ≈ 118.4004 +5.588 ≈ 123.988.

123.988 * 9 = approx 1115.892.

Denominator: 0.008.

So P = 1115.892 / 0.008 = 139,486.5 lb-in²/s.

Wait, but wait, units: lb·s/in² * (rad/s)^2 * in * in² / in → Let me recheck units.

μ is lb·s/in², ω² is 1/s², L is in, D² is in², h_m is in.

So numerator units: (lb·s/in²) * (1/s²) * in * in² → (lb·s * in) ) / (s² in²) → lb/(s in).

Wait, but then when divided by h_m (in), the overall units are lb/(s in) * in → lb/s.

So P in lb/s. To convert to horsepower, since 1 hp = 550 lb-ft/s, and 1 ft = 12 in, so 1 lb-ft/s = 12 lb-in/s.

So 1 hp = 550 * 12 = 6600 lb-in/s.

So P in lb-in/s is 139,486.5 lb-in/s.

So in horsepower: 139,486.5 / 6600 ≈ 21.14 hp.

Wait, that seems really high for a bearing loss. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula or the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe I should consider that the area is different. Let me think again.

Wait, the area I used was L * π D / 2, which is the lateral surface area of the 180-degree bearing. But perhaps that's incorrect, and I should use the projected area instead.

Wait, the projected area is L * D, so maybe the shear force should be calculated over that area. Let me recalculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct area to use is the same as the projected area, so A = L * D = 6 * 3 = 18 in².

So then, the shear stress is τ = μ ω / h_m.

Shear force F = τ * A = (μ ω / h_m) * 18.

Then, the power loss P is F * velocity. The velocity at the shaft surface is v = ω * R = ω * (D/2) = ω * 1.5 in/s.

So P = F * v = (μ ω / h_m * 18) * (ω * 1.5 )

So,

P = (μ * ω^2 * 1.5 * 18 ) / h_m

Simplify: 1.5 * 18 = 27.

So,
