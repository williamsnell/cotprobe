Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relay controlled by a vacuum photocell. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the photocell is actuated by light passing through an aperture that's 15 mm by 40 mm. Oh wait, I remember that the amount of light that falls on the photocell depends on the area of the aperture and the intensity of the light source, right? Or wait, maybe it's related to the flux or something. 

The question mentions that at least 0.2 lumen must strike the photocell to operate the relay. So I guess I need to calculate how far the source can be so that the light intensity at that distance multiplied by the area of the aperture gives at least 0.2 lumens.

Wait, what's the formula here? Oh right, I think the flux (in lumens) is given by the product of the intensity (in candelas) and the area (in square meters), but wait no, wait. Oh wait, intensity is in candelas, which is lumens per steradian. Hmm, no, wait. Another approach: The illumination (lux) is measured in lumens per square meter. So maybe the flux through the aperture is the illumination at that point multiplied by the area of the aperture.

Wait, but what's the relation between the source intensity and the illumination at a distance. Oh right, the illumination E (in lux) is given by E = I / d², where I is the intensity in candelas and d is the distance in meters. Oh wait wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the formula is E = I * cosθ / d², but in this case, I think the light is perpendicular, so cosθ is 1. So E = I / d².

Wait, but E is in lux, which is lumens per square meter. So the flux through the aperture (which would be in lumens) would be E * A, where A is the area in square meters. So putting it together, the flux F is (I / d²) * A.

But wait, the problem states that the photocell needs at least 0.2 lumens to operate. So F must be >= 0.2 lumens.

So, the setup is: F = (I * A) / d² >= 0.2.

So, solving for d, the maximum permissible distance d is when F is exactly 0.2, so d = sqrt( (I * A) / F ).

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

But wait, the aperture is 15 mm by 40 mm. So the area A is length times width. Let me convert those to meters.

15 mm is 0.015 meters, and 40 mm is 0.040 meters. So A = 0.015 * 0.040 = 0.0006 square meters.

The intensity I is given as 50 candelas. And F is 0.2 lumens.

So plugging into the formula:

d² = (I * A) / F = (50 * 0.0006) / 0.2.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

50 * 0.0006 = 0.03.

Divide by 0.2: 0.03 / 0.2 = 0.15.

So d squared is 0.15, so d is sqrt(0.15).

What's the square root of 0.15? Let's see: sqrt(0.16) is 0.4, so sqrt(0.15) is a bit less than that. Let me calculate it more accurately.

0.15 is 3/20, so sqrt(3/20) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(20) = approx 1.732 / 4.472. Let me compute that.

1.732 divided by 4.472. Let's see:

4.472 * 0.387 = approx 1.732. So sqrt(0.15) is approximately 0.387 meters, which is 38.7 centimeters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 38.7 cm, so that's the answer, right?

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I mix up the formulas.

Wait, another approach: The formula for illumination E is I / d² (in lux). So E = 50 / d².

Then, the flux F through the aperture is E * A. So F = (50 / d²) * (0.015 * 0.040) = (50 * 0.0006) / d² = 0.03 / d².

We need F >= 0.2, so 0.03 / d² >= 0.2.

Wait, no, wait. Because 0.03 / d² >= 0.2? Let's solve that.

Wait, that would mean d² <= 0.03 / 0.2 = 0.15, so d <= sqrt(0.15) ≈ 0.387 m, so 38.7 cm. That's the same as before. So the maximum permissible distance is 38.7 cm, which is option E.

So the answer should be E.

To determine the maximum permissible distance from the aperture to the point source, we start by noting that the flux \( F \) (in lumens) striking the photocell is given by:

\[
F = \frac{I \cdot A}{d^2}
\]

where:
- \( I = 50 \, \text{candelas} \) (intensity of the source),
- \( A = 0.015 \, \text{m} \times 0.040 \, \text{m} = 0.0006 \, \text{m}^2 \) (area of the aperture),
- \( d \) is the distance in meters,
- \( F = 0.2 \, \text{lumens} \) (minimum flux required to operate the relay).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( d^2 \):

\[
d^2 = \frac{I \cdot A}{F}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
d^2 = \frac{50 \cdot 0.0006}{0.2} = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{0.15} \approx 0.387 \, \text{meters} = 38.7 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Thus, the maximum permissible distance is \( 38.7 \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
