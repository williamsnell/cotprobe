Question:

A salesman, who had worked 20 years for the same company, was suddenly terminated for no apparent reason. Thereafter, the salesman sued the company, alleging age discrimination. At trial, he wants to call an employee of the company as an adverse witness. The salesman seeks to have the employee testify that she was present at a company board meeting when the company's president allegedly said, "Now, I'm sure that everyone agrees that the salesman is too old, and he really doesn't typify the image we want our employees to project. " It is the common practice of the company to tape record all such board meetings. Moreover, it is customary for the company's secretary to transcribe the tapes following the board meetings. Upon objection by the company's attomey, the employee's proposed testimony will be held

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the secretary's transcribed notes are the best evidence.
B: inadmissible, because the president's statement is not relevant to the case.
C: admissible, because the employee was present during the board meeting.
D: admissible, because the president's statement is direct evidence of age discrimination.
E: admissible, because the president's statement was an admission by a company representative.
F: inadmissible, because the employee is biased against the company.
G: inadmissible, because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.
H: admissible, because the employee's testimony corroborates the salesman's claim.
I: inadmissible, because the employee's testimony is hearsay.
J: admissible, because the employee's testimony is crucial to proving age discrimination.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the situation is about a salesman who was terminated after 20 years. He's suing for age discrimination. Now, at trial, he wants to call an employee as an adverse witness. The employee would testify that she was at a board meeting where the company president said something about the salesman being too old and not fitting the company image they want. 

The company usually tapes all board meetings, and the secretary transcribes the tapes afterward. The company's attorney objects to the employee's testimony. The question is whether this testimony will be admissible.

Hmm, so the main issue here is about the admissibility of the employee's testimony regarding the president's statement. Let's think about the possible objections.

First, I remember that the Best Evidence Rule (Federal Rule of Evidence 1002) says that to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, you need to produce the original unless certain exceptions apply. So if there's a tape recording of the meeting, and the employee is testifying about what was said, the opposing side might argue that the tape is the best evidence.

Wait, but here the employee is testifying about what she heard, not about the content of the tape. So she's recounting her personal knowledgeâ€”she was present and heard the statement. The best evidence rule typically applies when the content of the writing or recording is at issue. For example, if someone is testifying about what a document says, you'd need the document itself unless it's unavailable.

In this case, the employee isn't testifying about the contents of the tape or the transcript; she's testifying about what she directly heard. So the best evidence rule might not apply here. Because she has personal knowledge of the event, her testimony is admissible despite the existence of a tape.

Another angle is whether the statement is hearsay. The president's statement could be an admission by a party opponent, which is an exception to hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2). Since the president is the company's representative, his statement about the salesman's age would be an admission and thus not hearsay. So the testimony wouldn't be inadmissible on hearsay grounds.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Inadmissible because the secretary's notes are best evidence. But the employee is testifying to what she heard, not the notes, so A is probably wrong.

B: Inadmissible because the statement isn't relevant. The statement is about age, which is directly relevant to the discrimination claim, so B is incorrect.

C: Admissible because she was present. That's a factor, but maybe not the main reason. Her presence gives her personal knowledge, but the main issue is about best evidence or hearsay.

D: Admissible as direct evidence. It is direct evidence, but that's more about the weight, not admissibility.

E: Admissible as an admission. This seems right because the president's statement is an admission by a party opponent.

F: Inadmissible because of bias. There's no indication she's biased, so F is unlikely.

G: Inadmissible because the tape is best evidence. But again, she's testifying to her own perception, not the tape's content, so G is incorrect.

H: Admissible because it corroborates. Corroboration isn't the main issue here; it's about whether it's admissible in the first place.

I: Inadmissible as hearsay. No, because it's an admission, so I is wrong.

J: Admissible because it's crucial. While it's important, the reason for admissibility is more about it being an admission.

So the correct answer should be E. The president's statement is an admission, making the testimony admissible.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony from an employee who claims to have heard the company president make a statement about the salesman's age during a board meeting. The key issues are whether the Best Evidence Rule applies and whether the statement constitutes hearsay.

The Best Evidence Rule (FRE 1002) requires the original recording or document when the content of a writing, recording, or photograph is at issue. However, the employee is testifying about what she personally heard, not the content of the tape or transcript. Therefore, the Best Evidence Rule does not bar her testimony.

Additionally, the president's statement is not hearsay because it qualifies as an admission by a party opponent under FRE 801(d)(2). As a representative of the company, the president's statement about the salesman's age is directly relevant to the age discrimination claim and is admissible.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, G**: Incorrect because the Best Evidence Rule does not apply to the employee's personal testimony.
- **B**: Incorrect because the statement is highly relevant to the age discrimination claim.
- **C, H, J**: While partially true, these options do not address the primary legal basis for admissibility.
- **D**: Correct in substance but not the best answer, as the admissibility is better explained by the admission exception to hearsay.
- **E**: Correct because the president's statement is an admission by a party opponent, making it admissible under FRE 801(d)(2).
- **F, I**: Incorrect because there is no indication of bias, and the statement is not hearsay.

The best answer is **E**.
