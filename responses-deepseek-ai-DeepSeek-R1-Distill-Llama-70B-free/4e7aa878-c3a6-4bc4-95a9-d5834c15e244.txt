Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes."
Germania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.

Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about a passage from Tacitus's Germania. Let's read the question and the passage carefully.

The question is asking what the views expressed in the excerpt are evidence of in Roman society. The options are A through D, but I'll focus on understanding the passage first.

The passage talks about different Germanic tribes. It mentions that the Chamavi and Angrivarii drove out the Bructeri and exterminated them, with the help of neighboring tribes. Tacitus says that over 60,000 fell, not by Roman arms but before their eyes. He then prays that the tribes will retain hatred for each other, as discord among enemies is a great boon from fortune.

So, Tacitus is discussing how Germanic tribes are fighting among themselves, which benefits Rome. He's expressing a sentiment that it's good when their enemies fight each other because it weakens them without Rome having to do much.

Looking at the options:

A: Disgust for barbarian peoples. The passage does talk about barbarians, but I don't see explicit disgust. Tacitus is more focused on the strategic advantage of their infighting rather than expressing disgust.

B: Concern about barbarian attacks. Well, the passage doesn't directly express fear or concern about attacks. Instead, it's showing that when the tribes fight each other, it's beneficial for Rome. So maybe this isn't the best fit.

C: Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy. Stoicism is a philosophical school that emphasizes reason and self-control. The passage is about foreign policy or military strategy, not about philosophical beliefs. I don't see how this connects to Stoicism.

D: Maintenance of large armies. The passage doesn't mention Rome's armies except to note that the tribes were killed without Roman arms. It's more about the strategy of letting enemies fight each other rather than needing a large army.

Wait, but the question is about what the views are evidence of. Tacitus is happy that the tribes are fighting each other, which suggests a strategy of divide and conquer. This implies that the Romans don't need to maintain a large army because their enemies are already weakening themselves. So maybe D isn't the right answer because it's about not needing large armies, but the passage doesn't talk about the size of Rome's forces.

Alternatively, the passage reflects that the Romans prefer this method of dealing with enemies rather than direct military confrontation. So perhaps it's about Roman strategy but not directly about the size of their armies.

Wait, perhaps the passage shows that the Romans are aware of the barbarian threat but are using the strategy of letting them fight each other. So maybe it's about concern over barbarian attacks. Because if the barbarians weren't a threat, there would be no need to wish for their discord.

Alternatively, the passage shows a desire for the tribes to keep fighting each other, which benefits Rome. So it's about Roman strategy towards their enemies, which could relate to their military practices or their approach to defense.

Another angle: the passage shows that the Romans are observing the barbarians and are happy when they fight each other. This could indicate that the Romans are concerned about the possibility of barbarian attacks and thus prefer when the tribes are divided. So option B might make sense.

Wait, but the passage doesn't express concern; it expresses satisfaction that the tribes are fighting each other. So perhaps the underlying sentiment is that the Romans are worried about barbarian attacks and thus see the infighting as a positive. So B might be the answer.

Alternatively, the passage could be showing that the Romans don't need to maintain large armies because their enemies are fighting each other. But the passage doesn't explicitly mention the size of the armies, so maybe D is not the best choice.

So, putting it together: the passage reflects a strategic view that it's beneficial for Rome when their enemies fight among themselves, which suggests that the Romans are concerned about potential attacks and thus welcome the tribes' infighting as a form of defense. Therefore, the view expressed is evidence of concern about barbarian attacks. So the answer would be B.

The passage from Tacitus's *Germania* discusses how the Chamavi and Angrivarii drove out and exterminated the Bructeri with the help of neighboring tribes, resulting in over 60,000 deaths. Tacitus expresses satisfaction that this conflict occurred without Roman intervention, as it weakened their enemies. He further prays that the tribes will continue to hate each other, emphasizing that discord among foes is advantageous for Rome. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Disgust for barbarian peoples**  
  The passage does not express disgust toward barbarians but focuses on the strategic benefit of their infighting.  

- **B: Concern about barbarian attacks**  
  While the passage does not explicitly express fear, it implies that barbarian tribes pose a potential threat. Tacitus's satisfaction with their discord suggests a strategic concern about barbarian attacks, as it highlights the value of weakening enemies through internal conflict.  

- **C: Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy**  
  The passage is about military strategy and foreign relations, not philosophical beliefs. Stoicism is irrelevant here.  

- **D: Maintenance of large armies**  
  The passage does not mention the size of Rome's armies. It emphasizes the benefit of letting enemies weaken themselves, rather than relying on large armies.  

The passage reflects a strategic perspective on dealing with barbarian threats, suggesting that the Romans are aware of the potential danger and view tribal infighting as a beneficial outcome. This aligns most closely with **B: Concern about barbarian attacks**.  

Answer: B
