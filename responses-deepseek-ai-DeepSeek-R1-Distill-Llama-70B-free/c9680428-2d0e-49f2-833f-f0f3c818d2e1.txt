Question:

Suppose that a tank containing a certain liquid has an outlet near the bottom. Let $h(t)$ be the height of the liquid surface above the outlet at time $t$. Torricelli's principle states that the outflow velocity $v$ at the outlet is equal to the velocity of a particle falling freely (with no drag) from the height $h$.
Consider a water tank in the form of a right circular cylinder that is $3 \mathrm{~m}$ high above the outlet. The radius of the tank is $1 \mathrm{~m}$ and the radius of the circular outlet is $0.1 \mathrm{~m}$. If the tank is initially full of water, determine how long it takes to drain the tank down to the level of the outlet.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about draining a tank, and I'm supposed to figure out how long it takes to drain it down to the outlet level. Hmm, Torricelli's principle is involved, which I remember has something to do with the velocity of fluid flowing out of an orifice.

Alright, the tank is a right circular cylinder, 3 meters high. The radius is 1 meter, and the outlet has a radius of 0.1 meters. It's initially full, so the initial height of the water is 3m above the outlet.

I think Torricelli's law says that the velocity of the fluid exiting the outlet is the same as a free-falling object from that height. So the velocity v is sqrt(2gh), where g is acceleration due to gravity and h is the height at time t. Right.

Now, the problem is about calculating the time it takes to drain the tank. So I remember that this is a calculus problem involving integrating the rate at which the volume decreases. The idea is that the outflow velocity relates to the volume flow rate, and from there, we can find how the height changes over time.

Let me jot down what I know:

- The tank is a cylinder, so the cross-sectional area A is πr², where r is 1 m. So A = π(1)^2 = π m².
- The outlet is a circle with radius 0.1 m, so its area a is π(0.1)^2 = 0.01π m².
- Torricelli's velocity v = sqrt(2gh). So the volume flow rate is a*v, which is a*sqrt(2gh).
- The volume of the tank at any time t is the area A multiplied by the height h(t). So dV/dt = -a*sqrt(2gh), because the volume is decreasing.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the volume change is related to the height change. The volume in the tank is A*h(t). So dV/dt = A * dh/dt. But the outflow is causing this dV/dt, so:

A * dh/dt = -a * sqrt(2gh)

Hmm, because the flow rate is a*v, which is the rate at which volume is leaving, so negative sign.

So, rearranging:

dh/dt = -(a/A) * sqrt(2g) * sqrt(h)

That's a differential equation in terms of h(t). We can separate variables to solve it.

So, let's write it as:

dh/dt = -k * sqrt(h)

where k is (a/A)*sqrt(2g). Let me calculate that.

First, a is 0.01π, A is π, so a/A is 0.01. So k = 0.01 * sqrt(2g). Wait, sqrt(2g) is a constant. Let me compute 2g: 2*9.81 = 19.62. So sqrt(19.62) is about 4.429.

So k = 0.01 * 4.429 ≈ 0.04429 s^-1.

Wait, maybe I should keep exact expressions for now. Let's not approximate yet.

So the equation is:

dh/dt = -k sqrt(h), where k = (a/A) sqrt(2g)

We can write this as:

dh / sqrt(h) = -k dt

Integrate both sides. The left side from h = H (initial height) to h = 0, and the right side from t=0 to t=T (the total time).

So integrating:

∫ (1/sqrt(h)) dh from H to 0 = ∫ -k dt from 0 to T

The integral of 1/sqrt(h) dh is 2 sqrt(h). Evaluated from H to 0, that's 2 sqrt(0) - 2 sqrt(H) = -2 sqrt(H).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, if the left side is ∫ from H to 0 of 1/sqrt(h) dh, that would be 2 sqrt(h) evaluated from H to 0, which is 2(0) - 2 sqrt(H) = -2 sqrt(H). 

The right side is ∫-k dt from 0 to T is -k*T.

So putting it together:

-2 sqrt(H) = -k T → 2 sqrt(H) = k T → T = (2 sqrt(H)) / k

H is the initial height, which is 3 meters.

So substituting back, k is (a/A) sqrt(2g) = 0.01 * sqrt(19.62) ≈ 0.01 * 4.429 ≈ 0.04429 s^-1.

Wait, but let's do it symbolically first to avoid confusion.

H is 3 m.

So T = (2 * sqrt(3)) / [ (a/A) sqrt(2g) )

Since a/A is (π (0.1)^2) / (π (1)^2) ) = (0.01π) / π ) = 0.01.

So substituting, T = 2 sqrt(3) / (0.01 * sqrt(2g)) )

Hmm, let's compute this step by step.

Compute 2*sqrt(3) = 2 * 1.732 ≈ 3.464.

Compute 0.01 * sqrt(2g) = 0.01 * sqrt(19.62) ≈ 0.01 * 4.429 ≈ 0.04429.

So T = 3.464 / 0.04429 ≈ ?

Wait, wait, let me compute that division. 3.464 divided by approximately 0.04429.

0.04429 is about 4.429e-2. So 3.464 / 0.04429 = 3.464 * (1 / 0.04429) ≈ 3.464 * 22.577 ≈ ?

3.464 * 20 is 69.28. 3.464 * 2.577 is about 8.93. So total around 78.21 seconds.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't include 78.21. The options are around 98s, 105s, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the equation properly.

Wait, let me rederive the equation properly.

The volume of the tank at any time is V(t) = A * h(t), where A is the cross-sectional area of the tank (since it's a cylinder). The outflow rate is dV/dt = -a * v, where a is the area of the outlet, and v is the velocity from Torricelli's law.

So dV/dt = -a * sqrt(2 g h).

But dV/dt is also A * dh/dt, so:

A dh/dt = -a sqrt(2 g h)

So dh/dt = -(a/A) sqrt(2 g h)

Which is the same as I had before. So that setup is correct.

So separating variables:

dh / sqrt(h) = - (a/A) sqrt(2g) dt

Integrate both sides. The left side integral from h=H to h=0, and right side from t=0 to t=T.

So:

∫ (1/sqrt(h)) dh from H to 0 = ∫ -(a/A) sqrt(2g) dt from 0 to T

Left integral is [2 sqrt(h)] from H to 0 → 2(0) - 2 sqrt(H) = -2 sqrt(H)

Right integral is -(a/A) sqrt(2g) * T

So:

-2 sqrt(H) = -(a/A) sqrt(2g) * T

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 sqrt(H) = (a/A) sqrt(2g) * T

So T = (2 sqrt(H)) / [ (a/A) sqrt(2g) ) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

H = 3 m

a/A = (π (0.1)^2) / (π (1)^2) ) = 0.01

So sqrt(2g) is sqrt(2*9.81) = sqrt(19.62) ≈ 4.429.

So:

T = (2 * sqrt(3)) / (0.01 * 4.429)

Compute numerator: 2 * sqrt(3) ≈ 2 * 1.732 ≈ 3.464

Denominator: 0.01 * 4.429 ≈ 0.04429

So T ≈ 3.464 / 0.04429 ≈ let's compute this.

3.464 ÷ 0.04429.

Compute 0.04429 times 78 is about 3.454 (since 0.04429 * 78 = 78 * 4.429e-2 = (78 *4.429)/100 → 78 *4 is 312, 78 * 0.429 is ~33.462 → 312+33.462=345.462 → 345.462 /100 = 3.45462). So 78 gives ~3.454, which is just under 3.464.

So 78.1 seconds would be approximately 3.464. So about 78.1 seconds.

But wait, the options don't have 78. The closest is option F:85.30, which is higher. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should not approximate sqrt(2g) as 4.429 but use exact expressions to see if I can get a more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the expression for T. Let me try to express T in terms of H, a, A, and g.

Rewriting T:

T = (2 sqrt(H)) / [ (a/A) sqrt(2g) )

= 2 sqrt(H) * A / (a sqrt(2g) )

Substituting A = π R_tank^2, a = π r_outlet^2.

So:

T = 2 sqrt(H) * (π R^2) / (π r^2 sqrt(2g) )

The π cancels, so:

T = 2 sqrt(H) * R^2 / ( r^2 sqrt(2g) )

Where R is the radius of the tank, which is 1 m, and r is the radius of the outlet, 0.1 m.

So substituting R=1, r=0.1:

T = 2 sqrt(3) * (1)^2 / ( (0.1)^2 sqrt(2 *9.81) )

Simplify denominator: (0.1)^2=0.01.

So:

T = 2 * sqrt(3) / ( 0.01 * sqrt(19.62) )

Compute sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732.

sqrt(19.62) ≈ 4.429.

So:

2 * 1.732 = 3.464.

Denominator: 0.01 * 4.429 = 0.04429.

So T = 3.464 / 0.04429 ≈ 78.2 seconds.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the calculus.

Wait, when I integrated dh/sqrt(h) = -k dt, the integral of 1/sqrt(h) dh is indeed 2 sqrt(h), right? So when h goes from H to 0, it's 2 sqrt(0) - 2 sqrt(H) = -2 sqrt(H).

And the right side is -k T, because integrating from 0 to T:

- k T = -2 sqrt(H)

So T = 2 sqrt(H) / k.

Wait, and k is (a/A) sqrt(2g). So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating a/A. Let me check again.

a is the area of the outlet, which is π (0.1)^2 = 0.01π.

A is the area of the tank, which is π (1)^2 = π.

So a/A is 0.01π / π = 0.01. That's correct.

So sqrt(2g) is correct.

Hmm. So unless I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the tank isn't a cylinder but something else. Wait, the problem says it's a right circular cylinder, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe the height given is 3m, but perhaps the diameter is 2r, so the radius is 1 m. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should think about units. Let me check.

H is 3 meters; a and A are in square meters, so a/A is unitless.

sqrt(2g h) has units of m^0.5 * (m/s²)^0.5 → m/s.

Wait, no, sqrt(2g h) would have units sqrt( (m/s²)*m ) = sqrt( m²/s² ) = m/s.

So velocity is m/s.

So a in m² multiplied by v in m/s gives m³/s, which is correct for dV/dt.

So that's correct.

Hmm. But according to my calculation, the time is about 78 seconds, but the options don't have that. The closest is option F:85.30 s, but that's higher. Then perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, let me try solving the differential equation again.

The equation is:

dh/dt = -(a/A) sqrt(2g) sqrt(h)

Which can be rewritten as:

dh/dt = -C sqrt(h), where C = (a/A) sqrt(2g)

This is a separable equation.

So:

dh / sqrt(h) = -C dt

Integrating both sides.

The integral of h^(-1/2) dh is 2 h^(1/2) + const.

So from h=H to h=0.

Left side: ∫ from H to 0 of h^(-1/2) dh = [2 sqrt(h)] from H to 0 = 2(0) - 2 sqrt(H) = -2 sqrt(H).

Right side: ∫ from 0 to T of -C dt = -C (T - 0) = -C T.

So:

-2 sqrt(H) = -C T → 2 sqrt(H) = C T → T = (2 sqrt(H)) / C.

Which is the same as before.

So the calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up radius and diameter somewhere. Let me check the problem statement again.

Tank is a right circular cylinder, radius 1m. Outlet is a circular outlet, radius 0.1m. So a= π (0.1)^2, A=π (1)^2. So a/A=0.01. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the height is 3m, but when draining, the height goes from 3m down to 0? No, the outlet is at the bottom, so when the tank is drained down to the outlet level, the height h(t) is zero. So initial height is 3m, final is 0.

Wait, but in some derivations, when the tank is a cylinder, but perhaps the cross-section area is not A=π r², but wait, no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the velocity isn't sqrt(2gh), but sqrt(2g(h + outlet height)), but no, the problem says the height is measured above the outlet, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the formula for T. Let me try to compute it again.

T = (2 sqrt(H)) / [ (a/A) sqrt(2g) ]

H=3 m, a/A=0.01, sqrt(2g)=sqrt(19.62)=4.429.

So 2*sqrt(3)=3.464.

3.464 divided by (0.01 *4.429) = 3.464 / 0.04429 ≈ 78.2 s.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula for T is different. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I should have considered the area ratio correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is dh/dt = -(a/A) * sqrt(2g) * sqrt(h). But maybe I forgot the square root of h in the equation.

Wait, no, I think I included that correctly.

Wait another approach: Let me compute the integral numerically with more precise numbers to see if I get a more accurate time.

Compute sqrt(2g):

2g = 19.62 m²/s².

sqrt(19.62) is approx 4.42914.

So a/A=0.01.

So C = (a/A) * sqrt(2g) = 0.01 * 4.42914 ≈ 0.0442914 s^-1.

So T = 2*sqrt(3) / 0.0442914.

Compute 2*sqrt(3) = 3.464101615.

So 3.464101615 / 0.0442914 ≈ let's compute this.

Compute 0.0442914 * 78 = 78 * 0.0442914 = let's see, 70*0.0442914=3.100398, 8*0.0442914=0.354332. So total 3.100398 + 0.354332 = 3.45473, which is just under 3.4641.

So 78 seconds gives a numerator of 3.45473, which is 0.00937 less than 3.4641.

So the difference is 3.4641 - 3.45473 = 0.00937.

How much more time is needed beyond 78 seconds?

Since each second adds 0.0442914 to the denominator's contribution, so 0.00937 / 0.0442914 ≈ 0.2115 seconds.

So T ≈ 78 + 0.2115 ≈ 78.21 seconds.

So approximately 78.21 seconds, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is different. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves integrating from h=H to h=0, but the correct approach is to consider that the tank's cross-sectional area is A, and the flow out is a*v.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time it takes for the height to drop to zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation:

T = (A/(a sqrt(2g))) * 2 sqrt(H)

Wait, no, because T = 2 sqrt(H) *
