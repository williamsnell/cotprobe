Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about an entity that prepares its financial statements on an income tax basis. The notes include a summary of significant accounting policies, discussing the basis of presentation and how it differs from GAAP. The question is about where the dollar amount of the effects of these differences should be included.

Hmm, I remember that when financial statements are prepared on a basis other than GAAP, like the income tax basis, certain disclosures are required. I think the key here is that the statements are not in accordance with GAAP, so the auditor has to consider that.

Wait, I recall something about the form of the audit report. When the financial statements are prepared on a different basis, like tax basis, the auditor's report needs to disclose the departure from GAAP. Specifically, I think the report should include a paragraph that explains the differences and quantifies the effects if the amounts are known.

So, in the notes of the financial statements, they discuss the basis of presentation. But what about the dollar amounts? Do they need to quantify the differences? I think the accounting policies note should describe how tax basis differs, and if the effects are known, they should be quantified and probably included in the notes or the auditor's report.

Wait, the question gives us options about where to include the dollar amounts. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says they need not be quantified. I don't think that's right because if the effects are known, they should be quantified. So C is probably incorrect.

Options A and B require inclusion in the balance sheet or income statement, but I don't remember that being the case. The financials are on tax basis, so the balance sheet and income statement are already on that basis. The differences would be explained in the notes or the auditor's report.

Option E says only in the notes. But wait, the auditor's report also needs to address this. Because when the financial statements depart from GAAP, the auditor's opinion is modified, and the report includes an explanatory paragraph.

So the dollar effects would be in the notes, and the auditor's report would discuss it as well. Because the auditor has a responsibility to inform users about the departure from GAAP.

Looking back at the options, option J says both in notes and auditor's report. Option D includes balance sheet and auditor's report. Option G is auditor's report and balance sheet.

Wait, no, the balance sheet isn't where the quantification goes. The balance sheet is on the tax basis. The quantification of differences is a disclosure, so it would be in the notes. The auditor's report would then refer to that and discuss the implications.

So, if the entity's notes include a summary and the dollar effects, then the auditor's report needs to mention that the financial statements are on a different basis and the effects. So the quantification is in the notes, and the auditor's report includes an explanatory paragraph about it.

Wait, but the question is about where the dollar amount is required to be included. So the options are about where the actual dollar effect is shown.

I think the notes to the financial statements would include the dollar amounts. And the auditor's report would refer to these notes. So the dollar amounts are in the notes. But the auditor's report also needs to describe the departure and its effects, so perhaps the dollar amounts are included there as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the auditor's report doesn't need to quantify, just state that the statements are on a different basis. But I think when the effects are known, the auditor must quantify them in their report.

Wait, let me think about the audit report structure. In a GAAS audit, when the financial statements are not GAAP, the auditor issues a modified opinion. And in the report, under the "Basis of Accounting" section, they explain the basis and the effects on the financial statements.

So, for example, the report might say, "The financial statements have been prepared on the income tax basis of accounting, which is a basis of accounting other than GAAP. Under GAAP, certain amounts would be different, and the effects of these differences are as follows: [dollar amounts]."

So the dollar amounts are included in the auditor's report. Additionally, the notes to the financial statements would discuss the basis and the differences. So the dollar amounts would be in both places.

Wait, but the question says that the notes include a summary of significant accounting policies that discuss the basis and the differences. It doesn't specify whether the dollar amounts are in the notes. So perhaps the notes explain the basis, but the dollar amounts are in the auditor's report.

Alternatively, the notes would include the quantification because that's part of the accounting policies.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall the specific standards. AU-C 800 is about special considerations for financial statements prepared in conformity with a regulatory basis of accounting other than GAAP, like the tax basis.

In AU-C 800.55, it says that the auditor's report should include an explanatory paragraph that describes the basis of accounting and the effects of the difference, if known.

So if the entity's notes include the quantification, then the auditor's report would include that information as well.

Wait, but the question says that the notes include a summary that discusses the basis and the differences. It doesn't say whether the dollar amounts are included. So the question is about whether the dollar amounts are required to be included somewhere.

So if the effects are known, they must be quantified. Then, where are they included?

I think the quantification would be in the notes to the financial statements because that's where the accounting policies and basis are discussed. The auditor's report would then refer to this.

So the dollar amounts are included in the notes. But the auditor's report also must include an explanatory paragraph that describes these effects. So the same dollar amounts would be in the notes and in the auditor's report.

Looking at the options, option J says both in notes and auditor's report. Option E says only in the notes.

Alternatively, perhaps the auditor's report doesn't need to include the dollar amounts, just a statement that the basis is different and the effects are quantified in the notes.

Wait, no, I think the auditor's report must include the quantification if it's known. Because the report needs to adequately inform the users of the financial statements.

So, for example, the auditor's report might state: "The financial statements have been prepared on the income tax basis of accounting. The effects of the differences between the income tax basis and GAAP are as follows: [dollar amounts]." So the dollar amounts are in the auditor's report.

Additionally, the notes would explain the basis of accounting and the differences, and perhaps include the dollar amounts as well.

So both the notes and the auditor's report would include the dollar amounts. Hence, option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. The notes discuss the basis, but the quantification of the differences is a specific disclosure. If the entity includes the dollar effects in the notes, then the auditor's report would refer to that and perhaps include the same information.

Alternatively, the auditor's report might not need to repeat the dollar amounts if they're already in the notes, but I think the report is required to include the quantification.

Wait, looking back at AU-C 800.55, it says the auditor's report should include a description of the basis and the effects. So the report itself must describe the effects, which would include quantification if known.

So the dollar amounts are in the auditor's report. But the notes to the financial statements also discuss the basis and the differences, so perhaps the quantification is in the notes as well.

Wait, but the question says that the notes include a discussion of the basis and the differences. It doesn't specify whether the dollar amounts are included. So the question is about where the dollar amount is required to be included.

So, in the notes, they describe the basis and how it differs, but the dollar effects might not necessarily be in the notes. Or perhaps they are.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of what I know about tax basis financial statements. They are a special purpose framework. Under GAAS, when auditing special purpose frameworks, the auditor's report must describe the framework and the effects of differences if known.

So, the auditor's report must include the quantification. But the financial statements' notes would also include information about the framework and the differences. So perhaps the quantification is in the notes, but the auditor's report also includes it.

So the dollar amounts are included both in the notes and the auditor's report, making option J the correct answer.

Alternatively, some might think that the dollar amounts are only in the notes, but I think the auditor's report must include them as well.

Wait, another thought. The notes are part of the financial statements, and the auditor's report is separate. The auditor's report must include the quantification because it's part of explaining the basis. So the notes would discuss the basis, but the dollar effects would be in the auditor's report.

Wait, no. The notes would typically include the quantification because it's part of the accounting policies and explanations. But the auditor's report also needs to mention the quantification.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose the tax basis financial statements have a different depreciation method than GAAP. The notes would explain this and state, for example, "If GAAP had been followed, depreciation expense would have been $X higher." So the notes include the dollar effect.

The auditor's report would then state that the financial statements are on the tax basis and that the effects of the differences are quantified in the notes. Alternatively, the report might include the quantification itself.

But according to AU-C 800.55, the auditor must include the effects in the report. So the dollar amounts are in the auditor's report.

Wait, but that would mean that the quantification is in the auditor's report. But the notes would explain the basis and perhaps include the same information.

Alternatively, perhaps the notes don't have to quantify, but the auditor's report does. But that doesn't make sense because the notes are supposed to explain the accounting policies.

I think the correct answer is that the dollar amounts are included in both the notes and the auditor's report. So option J is correct.
</think>

When an entity prepares its financial statements on the income tax basis, the notes to the financial statements include a summary of significant accounting policies that discuss the basis of presentation and how it differs from GAAP. The question focuses on where the dollar amount of the effects of these differences is required to be included.

Under generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), specifically AU-C 800, when financial statements are prepared on a basis other than GAAP, such as the income tax basis, the auditor's report must include an explanatory paragraph. This paragraph describes the basis of accounting and, if known, quantifies the effects of the differences between the tax basis and GAAP.

The notes to the financial statements typically discuss the basis of presentation and the differences from GAAP. If the dollar effects of these differences are known, they are usually quantified and included in the notes as part of the accounting policies and explanations. Additionally, the auditor's report must also include this quantification to adequately inform users of the financial statements about the departure from GAAP.

Given this, the dollar amounts of the effects are required to be included both in the notes to the financial statements and in the auditor's report. This ensures transparency and compliance with both accounting and auditing standards.
