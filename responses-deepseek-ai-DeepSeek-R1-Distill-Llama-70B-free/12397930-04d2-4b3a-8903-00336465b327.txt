Question:

A college freshman obtains a score of 150 on his English final exam, a score of 100 on his math exam, a score of 55 on his chemistry exam, and a score of 30 on his history exam. The means and standard deviations for these tests are, respectively, 125 and 20 for the English exam, 90 and 10 for the math exam, 45 and 5 for the chemistry exam, and 30 and 5 for the history exam. Based on this information, you can conclude that the young man's test performance was best on which exam?

Options:

A: Math and History
B: math
C: Chemistry and History
D: English and Math
E: All of the above
F: history
G: English
H: chemistry
I: English and History
J: None of the above

Okay, so I've got this question here about a college freshman's exam scores and figuring out where he performed best relative to the class. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me the student's scores for four exams: English, Math, Chemistry, and History. It also provides the mean (average) and standard deviation for each of these exams. The goal is to determine on which exam the student performed best compared to his peers.

Wait, so I remember that when comparing scores, especially when the tests have different means and scales, using z-scores is a good approach. Z-scores tell us how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular score is. A higher z-score means the student did better relative to the class.

Right, the formula for z-score is (score - mean) / standard deviation. So for each exam, I'll calculate the z-score.

Let me jot down the data:

English:
- Score: 150
- Mean: 125
- SD: 20

Math:
- Score: 100
- Mean: 90
- SD: 10

Chemistry:
- Score: 55
- Mean: 45
- SD: 5

History:
- Score: 30
- Mean: 30
- SD: 5

So for each subject, compute (score - mean)/SD.

Starting with English:

(150 - 125) / 20 = 25 / 20 = 1.25. So a z-score of 1.25. That's above average.

Math:

(100 - 90) /10 = 10/10 = 1.0. Z-score is 1.0. Also above average but lower than English.

Chemistry:

(55 -45)/5 = 10/5=2.0. Wow, a z-score of 2.0. That's two standard deviations above the mean. Higher than English.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Because the mean for chemistry is 45, so 55 is 10 points above. Divided by SD 5, that's 2. So yes, z=2.0.

History:

(30-30)/5 = 0/5=0. So z-score of 0. Exactly average.

Wait, so comparing all the z-scores:

English: 1.25
Math: 1.0
Chemistry: 2.0
History: 0

So the highest z-score is Chemistry at 2.0. Then English at 1.25. Then Math at 1.0, and History is average.

So the best performance is in Chemistry, followed by English. So the student did best in Chemistry.

Wait, but wait the question is phrased as "the young man's test performance was best on which exam?" So looking at the options:

Looking at the options, option H is chemistry, but let's look at the options again.

The options are:

A: Math and History
B: Math
C: Chemistry and History
D: English and Math
E: All of the above
F: History
G: English
H: Chemistry
I: English and History
J: None of the above

So the highest z-score is Chemistry (2.0), so the best performance is in Chemistry. So the correct answer should be H: chemistry.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recheck the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

English: (150-125)/20 = 25/20 = 1.25. Correct.

Math: (100-90)/10=1.0. Correct.

Chemistry: (55-45)/5=2.0. Correct.

History: (30-30)/5=0. Correct.

So yes, Chemistry has the highest z-score. So the student did best in chemistry.

Looking at the options, H is chemistry. So the correct answer is H.

To determine where the student performed best, we calculate the z-scores for each exam using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{\text{score} - \text{mean}}{\text{standard deviation}}
\]

Here are the calculations for each exam:

1. **English**:
   \[
   z = \frac{150 - 125}{20} = \frac{25}{20} = 1.25
   \]

2. **Math**:
   \[
   z = \frac{100 - 90}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1.0
   \]

3. **Chemistry**:
   \[
   z = \frac{55 - 45}{5} = \frac{10}{5} = 2.0
   \]

4. **History**:
   \[
   z = \frac{30 - 30}{5} = \frac{0}{5} = 0
   \]

The z-scores indicate how many standard deviations above or below the mean the student's score is. A higher z-score means better performance relative to the class. Comparing the z-scores:

- English: \( z = 1.25 \)
- Math: \( z = 1.0 \)
- Chemistry: \( z = 2.0 \)
- History: \( z = 0 \)

The highest z-score is for Chemistry (\( z = 2.0 \)), indicating the student performed best on the Chemistry exam. Among the answer choices, the correct option is:

**H: Chemistry**
