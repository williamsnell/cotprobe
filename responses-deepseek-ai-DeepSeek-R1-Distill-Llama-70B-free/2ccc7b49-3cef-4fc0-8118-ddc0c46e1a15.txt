Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the number of female renouncers under Chandanbala's tutelage. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure who Chandanbala is, but I think I remember something about him from my history classes or maybe from some book I read. Let me try to piece this together.

Okay, Chandanbala... wasn't he a Jain monk or something? I recall that in Jainism, there are these religious leaders who have a lot of followers, both men and women. Oh right, renouncers are people who renounce worldly life to follow a spiritual path, so in this context, they're probably Jain nuns or something similar.

Wait, the question is specifically about female renouncers. So I'm trying to remember any historical figures associated with a large number of female followers. I think Chandanbala might have been a prominent figure in the Digambara sect of Jainism. Oh right, the Digambara and Shvetambara are the two main sects of Jainism, differing in some practices and beliefs.

I remember that there was a time when the number of renouncers, both male and female, was quite high. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let me think... Oh, maybe this relates to the story where Chandanbala had a lot of followers, and when he passed away, the numbers were recorded or something.

Wait, I think the numbers are like 36,000 female renouncers. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be 24,000. Or was it 12,000? No, that seems too low. I think the higher numbers are more likely because Chandanbala was a significant figure.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. I'll try to recall any sources or famous stories. Oh, right! In some texts, it's mentioned that Chandanbala had 36,000 female disciples. That number sticks in my mind because it's a round figure and seems significant.

But then again, I'm not 100% certain. Maybe it's 24,000. Or perhaps 12,000. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another angle. Suppose I consider the options given: the choices are A:36k, C:24k, I:12k, etc.

I think the key is to remember that Chandanbala was known for having a large number of female followers. So 36k sounds right, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe 24k. Wait, I think I read somewhere that he had 36,000 female renouncers and a similar number of male ones, making the total around 70k or so. But I can't recall the exact split.

Alternatively, did he have 24,000 female and the same number of male? Hmm. Now I'm getting more confused. I think I should go with my initial thought. I'm more confident about 36,000 as the number of female renouncers.
