Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Combined Code of Practice for corporate governance. I need to figure out which option is not one of the underlying principles. The options are A through F, with the choices being Integrity, Adaptability, Accountability, Openness, Dependability, and Acceptability.

Hmm, I remember that the Combined Code outlines several key principles. Let me try to recall them. I think the main principles include things like accountability, integrity, openness, and maybe something about responsibility or adaptability. Wait, what's the exact list?

I think the original principles are based on the Committee on Corporate Governance's report, maybe the Cadbury Report or another one. Cadbury was about financial reporting, but the Combined Code combines various reports. Oh right, the key principles are things like accountability, integrity, openness, and maybe responsibility. Let me try to list them out.

Wait, the Combined Code's main sections include principles like:

- Directors: They should lead the company and be accountable to shareholders. So accountability is definitely a principle.

- Accountability is one of the key points. So option C is a principle.

- Openness: Yes, transparency in dealings, so D is a principle.

- Integrity: Definitely, it's about ethical behavior. So A is a principle.

What about adaptability? I'm not sure. The code emphasizes that companies should be adaptable to changes in the market and governance practices. Or wait, maybe it's part of the principle of responsiveness or something else. Alternatively, I think the code includes something about the board being adaptable to ensure the company's long-term success. So B, adaptability, might be a principle.

Now, the question is which one is NOT a principle. The options given are A-F, and I need to find the odd one out.

Wait, what about dependability and acceptability? Those don't ring a bell. Dependability is more about reliability, which might not be a core principle. Acceptability is about being acceptable to stakeholders, perhaps, but I don't recall that being one of the main points.

Let me think again about the Combined Code's principles. From what I remember, the main areas are:

1. Directors' responsibilities, which include accountability and integrity.

2. Relations with shareholders, which might touch on openness and communication.

3. The role of the board in managing risk, ensuring adequate controls, and being adaptable to changes and challenges.

Wait, but I'm trying to list the actual principles. Maybe I should think of the actual terms used.

I think the five main principles from the Combined Code are:

- Accountability

- Integrity

- Openness

- Responsiveness

- Adaptability

Wait, responsiveness is about considering wider stakeholder interests, and adaptability is about being flexible and responsive to change. So maybe adaptability is a principle.

But I'm not sure about dependability and acceptability. I think those aren't part of the main principles. Let's see: the question is asking which one is NOT an underlying principle.

So the options are A to F. The correct answer would be either E (Dependability) or F (Acceptability).

Wait, another approach: the Combined Code's principles include:

- A: Integrity – yes.

- B: Adaptability – yes, because it's about the board being able to adapt.

- C: Accountability – definitely yes.

- D: Openness – yes.

So E and F are the possible answers. Which one is not a principle?

I think the code doesn't mention dependability (E) or acceptability (F) as principles. Wait, perhaps the actual principles are:

1. Accountability

2. Openness

3. Integrity

4. Responsiveness

5. Adaptability

So the answer would be either E or F.

Wait, the options are:

E: Dependability

F: Acceptability

Hmm, I don't recall either of these being part of the Combined Code's principles.

Wait, the actual principles in the Combined Code are:

The Code is based on broad principles, including:

- Every company should be headed by an effective board which is responsible for its governance.

- The board should maintain a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the company's assets.

- The board should provide a statement of how they have applied the main principles.

But that's more about the structure. The key principles as per the report might include accountability, integrity, openness, responsiveness, and adaptability.

Wait, the actual Combined Code's main principles are:

1. The board's responsibility and accountability.

2. Directors should maintain the highest standards of integrity.

3. The board should have a dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual understanding of objectives.

4. The board should be responsive to wider stakeholder interests.

5. The board should ensure that the company's risk management systems are robust and defensible.

Wait, perhaps the five main principles are:

- Accountability

- Integrity

- Openness

- Responsiveness

- Adaptability

So, the options given are A: Integrity, B: Adaptability, C: Accountability, D: Openness. So these are all covered.

The options not in the list would be E: Dependability and F: Acceptability.

So the question is asking which is NOT an underlying principle. So either E or F is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following is not one the underlying principles". So the correct answer is either E or F.

Dependability is about being reliable, which doesn't seem like a core principle. Acceptability is about being acceptable, which also isn't a term I've heard in this context.

Looking back, the original question is from the Combined Code. I think the correct principles are accountability, integrity, openness, responsiveness, and adaptability.

So among the options, F: Acceptability is not a principle. Or is E: Dependability?

Wait, perhaps I should look at the exact wording. The Combined Code's underlying principles are:

The Code sets out principles of good governance in five sections:

A. Directors

B. Directors' Remuneration

C. Relations with Shareholders

D. Accountability and Audit

E. Institutional Shareholders

Wait, no, perhaps the main principles are:

The five main principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (which is the Combined Code) are:

1. Leadership: Every company should be led by an effective board.

2. Effectiveness: The board should have the right balance of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge.

3. Accountability: The board should be responsible for ensuring the company's financial statements are accurate.

4. Remuneration: Executive remuneration should be aligned with the company's long-term success.

5. Shareholder relations: The board should communicate with shareholders and respond to their concerns.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the sections with the principles. Alternatively, the main principles as per the Combined Code's underlying principles are:

- Accountability

- Integrity

- Openness

- Responsiveness

- Adaptability

So, of the options given, E (Dependability) and F (Acceptability) are not principles. So the answer would be either E or F.

I think the answer is E: Dependability is not a principle. Alternatively, perhaps F: Acceptability is not.

Wait, perhaps the actual underlying principles are:

The Combined Code is built on the following principles:

1. The board should be responsible for the company's direction and oversight.

2. The board should have a clear structure with defined roles.

3. The board should maintain high standards of integrity.

4. The board should be transparent in its decision-making.

5. The board should be accountable for the company's financial performance.

So in that case, the principles are accountability, integrity, openness, and perhaps others. But I'm not sure about adaptability.

Wait, maybe the core principles are:

- Accountability

- Integrity

- Openness

- Responsibility

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what each term means.

Dependability refers to being reliable or trustworthy. While important, it's not specifically listed as a principle in the code.

Acceptability refers to being acceptable, perhaps in terms of decisions being acceptable to stakeholders. Again, not a core principle.

So, looking back at the options, the question is which is NOT an underlying principle. Since the options are:

A: Integrity (yes)

B: Adaptability (I think yes)

C: Accountability (yes)

D: Openness (yes)

E: Dependability (no)

F: Acceptability (no)

So the correct answer would be either E or F. But I'm not certain which one is not a principle.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about adaptability. Maybe the code doesn't include adaptability as a principle. Let me check.

Wait, the Combined Code's main sections include:

Section A: The Board

A.1 The board's role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership and oversee risk management.

A.2 The board should have a clear structure and division of responsibilities.

A.3 The board should have a balance of skills, experience, independence.

Section B: Directors' Remuneration

Section C: Relations with Shareholders

Section D: Accountability and Audit

Section E: Institutional Shareholders

So the main principles are more about structure, remuneration, accountability, relations, etc.

Wait, the underlying principles are perhaps more about behavior than structure. So the principles are:

- Accountability: The board is accountable to shareholders.

- Integrity: High ethical standards.

- Openness: Transparent dealings.

- Responsiveness: Engaging with shareholders.

- Adaptability: The board should be flexible.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Maybe the correct answer is F: Acceptability, because I don't recall that being a principle.

Alternatively, perhaps the code doesn't mention adaptability. Maybe it's not one of the core principles.

Wait, another approach: the Combined Code's principles are:

1. Directors: They should lead the company and be accountable.

2. Accountability: The board should ensure accurate financial statements.

3. Remuneration: Pay should reward performance.

4. Relations with shareholders: The board should communicate effectively.

5. Institutional shareholders: They should engage with companies.

So the main principles are accountability, integrity, openness, responsiveness, and perhaps adaptability. Or maybe not adaptability.

Wait, perhaps the code includes something about the board being adaptable to change, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe adaptability is not a principle, and the correct answer is B: Adaptability is not an underlying principle.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Integrity – yes.

B: Adaptability – I'm not sure.

C: Accountability – yes.

D: Openness – yes.

E: Dependability – no.

F: Acceptability – no.

So the question is which one is NOT a principle. So possible answers are E and F.

But I'm not sure which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: Acceptability, because I don't think that's a principle.

Alternatively, I've heard of the principle of accountability (C), integrity (A), openness (D), and perhaps responsiveness (which isn't an option here). So adaptability (B) might be a principle.

So the ones that are NOT principles are E and F.

The question is asking which one is not, so the correct answer would be either E or F.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: Dependability.

Wait, let me try to think of the exact wording of the Combined Code. I think the code's main principles are:

1. The board should be responsible for the company's direction and oversight (accountability).

2. The board should maintain high standards of integrity.

3. The board should be transparent in its dealings (openness).

4. The board should be responsive to wider stakeholder concerns.

5. The board should ensure that the company's risk management systems are robust and defensible.

So, adaptability isn't explicitly mentioned as a principle. Therefore, option B: Adaptability might not be a principle.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe the code doesn't include adaptability as a principle. So if that's the case, then the answer would be B: Adaptability is not a principle.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: Acceptability.

I think I'm going in circles here. To make a decision, I'll have to go with what I remember.

I believe the Combined Code's underlying principles include accountability, integrity, openness, and responsiveness. So adaptability might not be one of them. Alternatively, perhaps adaptability is included as part of the board's responsibility.

Wait, another angle: the original Cadbury Report (1992) outlined the following principles:

1. The board should have a clear division of responsibilities.

2. The board should have a balance of executive and non-executive directors.

3. Directors' remuneration should be set by a remuneration committee.

4. Companies should have an audit committee.

5. The board should provide a statement of accountability.

6. Financial reporting should be accurate and timely.

So perhaps the Combined Code built on these, adding more principles like integrity and openness.

In that case, the principles are accountability, integrity, openness, responsiveness, and adaptability.

Wait, but I'm still not sure about adaptability. Maybe it's not one of the core principles.

Alternatively, perhaps adaptability is part of the principle of responsiveness.

In any case, the question asks which is NOT an underlying principle. The options are A-F.

Assuming that the principles are accountability (C), integrity (A), openness (D), and responsiveness. Then the ones not in the list are E and F.

So the answer would be either E or F.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Integrity

B: Adaptability

C: Accountability

D: Openness

E: Dependability

F: Acceptability

So, the correct answer is E: Dependability or F: Acceptability.

I think the correct answer is F: Acceptability, because I don't recall that being a principle.

Alternatively, maybe it's E: Dependability.

Wait, I think the correct answer is E: Dependability, as it's not one of the principles. Because the principles are more about conduct and structure rather than qualities like dependability.

So I'll go with E: Dependability as the answer.
</think>

The Combined Code of Practice for corporate governance outlines several key principles, including accountability, integrity, openness, responsiveness, and adaptability. These principles are designed to ensure effective leadership, transparency, and responsible decision-making within organizations. 

Analyzing the options provided:

- **A: Integrity** is a core principle, emphasizing ethical behavior and high standards of conduct.
- **B: Adaptability** is also considered a principle, as it reflects the board's ability to respond to changes and challenges in the business environment.
- **C: Accountability** is a fundamental principle, ensuring that the board is responsible for the company's actions and performance.
- **D: Openness** is another key principle, promoting transparency in dealings and decision-making.
- **E: Dependability** is not explicitly mentioned as a principle in the Combined Code. While dependability (reliability) may be an important trait, it is not one of the core principles outlined in the code.
- **F: Acceptability** is also not a principle of the Combined Code. Acceptability refers to being acceptable to stakeholders, which is not a specific focus of the code's underlying principles.

Given the analysis, the correct answer is **E: Dependability**, as it is not one of the underlying principles of the Combined Code.

Answer: E
