Alright, so I've got this tax question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a spouse died on December 31 of year 1. The couple had no dependents. Now, we need to determine the filing status of the surviving spouse in year 2.

Okay, first, I need to remember the different filing statuses and their eligibility criteria. The options provided are A through J, each representing a different status.

So, let's break down what I know. Filing status is determined based on the taxpayer's situation at the end of the tax year. In this case, the tax year in question is year 2.

In year 1, the spouse died on December 31. So, on December 31 of year 1, the person is considered unmarried for that year? Wait, no, actually, for tax purposes, if someone dies during the year, the surviving spouse can still file as married for that year. But what about the next year?

Wait, let me think again. For the year of death, the couple can file a joint return. But in the next year, the surviving spouse can't file as married anymore because their spouse is deceased. So, what's the filing status for the surviving spouse in year 2?

I remember that there's a special filing status called "Qualifying Widow(er)" which allows the surviving spouse to use the married filing jointly tax rates for a certain period. But what are the requirements?

From what I recall, to qualify as a Qualifying Widow(er), the following must be true:

1. The taxpayer's spouse died in the previous tax year (so in this case, year 1).
2. The taxpayer has not remarried.
3. The taxpayer must have a dependent child that they can claim. Or wait, is that the case?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the rules. There's also "Widow(er) with dependent child," but I think the key difference is whether you have a dependent. Let me clarify.

Looking back, I think the Qualifying Widow(er) status is available if the surviving spouse has a dependent child and meets certain other conditions. But if there are no dependents, maybe that option isn't available. Wait, but the question says they had no dependents.

So, in the scenario, the couple had no dependents. So in year 2, the surviving spouse can't qualify for "Qualifying Widow(er) with dependent child" because there's no dependent. So that rules out option B and F, I think.

Wait, option B is "Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child," and F is "Widow(er) with dependent child." Since they have no dependents, neither of those apply.

So what's left? Let's think about the other statuses. The options are:

A: Nonresident alien. Unlikely, unless the spouse is a nonresident, but the question doesn't specify that.

C: Single. That's a possibility because the spouse is now unmarried as of the end of year 2.

D: Married filing separately. But in year 2, the spouse is deceased, so they can't file as married.

E: Married filing jointly. Again, the spouse is deceased, so they can't file jointly in year 2.

G: Head of household. To qualify, the taxpayer must be unmarried and have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year, and have a qualifying person (like a dependent) living with them. But in this case, there are no dependents, so they can't qualify for head of household.

H: Jointly with deceased spouse. I don't think that's a valid filing status for year 2. The joint return is typically for the year of the spouse's death, not the next year.

I: Qualifying widow(er). Wait, isn't this the same as option B but without the dependent child? Let me check. I think that the "Qualifying Widow(er)" status (option I) is available when the surviving spouse doesn't have a dependent child. But wait, no, maybe that's not correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The IRS allows a surviving spouse to file as a Qualifying Widow(er) for up to two years after the spouse's death, provided they don't remarry and have a dependent child. Or is it that without a dependent, they can still file as a widow(er) but only for the year of death?

No, the Widow(er) filing status without the dependent is only available for the tax year in which the spouse died, allowing the couple to file jointly. But in subsequent years, the surviving spouse must file as single or, if they qualify, as head of household.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's clarify.

In the year of the spouse's death, the couple can file a joint return. The surviving spouse can file as married filing jointly for that year.

In the following year (year 2 in this case), the surviving spouse is considered unmarried. So their filing status would be single unless they qualify for another status.

But is there another option? Like, can they still file as a qualifying widow(er) without a dependent? Or is that only if they have a dependent.

Wait, I think that to qualify as a qualifying widow(er), you must have a dependent child. So without a dependent, the surviving spouse can't use that status.

So, in year 2, the surviving spouse has no dependents, so their filing status would be single.

Looking at the options, option C is "Single."

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes the rules can be tricky. The Qualifying Widow(er) status (option I) requires that the taxpayer has a dependent child. Since there are no dependents, option I isn't applicable.

So the surviving spouse would file as Single in year 2.

So the correct answer should be option C: Single.

The question involves determining the filing status of a surviving spouse in year 2, following the death of their spouse on December 31 of year 1. The couple had no dependents. 

To analyze the options:

1. **Nonresident alien (A):** This is irrelevant unless the surviving spouse is a nonresident, which is not indicated in the question.

2. **Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child (B):** This status requires a dependent child, which the couple does not have, so it does not apply.

3. **Single (C):** This is a valid option because the surviving spouse is unmarried as of December 31 of year 2.

4. **Married filing separately (D):** This is invalid because the spouse is deceased, and the surviving spouse cannot file as married in year 2.

5. **Married filing jointly (E):** This is also invalid for the same reason as D.

6. **Widow(er) with dependent child (F):** Like option B, this requires a dependent child, which the couple does not have.

7. **Head of household (G):** This requires a qualifying dependent, which the couple does not have, so it does not apply.

8. **Jointly with deceased spouse (H):** This is not a valid filing status for year 2, as joint filing is only allowed for the year of the spouse's death.

9. **Qualifying widow(er) (I):** This status typically requires a dependent child, which the couple does not have, so it does not apply.

10. **Dependent of another taxpayer (J):** This is irrelevant unless the surviving spouse is claimed as a dependent on someone else's return, which is not indicated.

Since the surviving spouse is unmarried as of December 31 of year 2 and has no dependents, the correct filing status is **Single**.

Answer: C
