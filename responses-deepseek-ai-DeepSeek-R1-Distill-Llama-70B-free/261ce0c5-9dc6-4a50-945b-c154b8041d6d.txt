Okay, so I have this question here: "Objects that absorb light appear..." and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let me think this through.

Alright, I remember that when light hits an object, a few things can happen. The light can be reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. Since the question is about absorption, I'll focus on that part. So, if an object absorbs light, what happens to the light? Well, absorption means the object takes in the light energy. But how does that affect how the object appears to us?

I think about colors and how they're perceived. White light is made up of all the colors of the visible spectrum. When light hits an object, the object reflects some of those wavelengths and absorbs others. The color we see is the color that's reflected. For example, a red apple looks red because it reflects red light and absorbs the other colors.

Wait, but the question is about absorption. So if an object absorbs light, does it mean it's absorbing all the light or just certain wavelengths? I think it's the latter. Objects absorb some wavelengths and reflect others. But the question is general, so maybe it's referring to objects that absorb a lot of light.

Oh, right! If an object absorbs all the wavelengths of visible light that hit it, it would appear black. Because no light is reflected; it's all absorbed. So black objects are those that don't reflect any light, hence they absorb all the light. 

Let me make sure I'm not mixing this up. So when objects absorb light, they don't emit that light as color. If they absorb all, we don't see any color from them, hence they look black. On the other hand, if they reflect all light, they appear white. So the opposite of white is black in this context.

Looking at the options, J is black. So the answer should be J: black.

When light hits an object, it can be reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. The question focuses on absorption, where the object takes in the light energy. Objects that absorb all wavelengths of visible light appear black because no light is reflected for us to see. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

J: black

Answer: J
