Question:

 Suppose two athletes, A and B, are equally skilled. Suppose also that A naturally inherited certain traits from her father that made playing the sport easier for her, and thus she didn't have to train as hard as B. According to the ethic of willfulness,

Options:

A: A is a better athlete.
B: B is a better athlete.
C: B doesn't count as an athlete because training precludes athleticism.
D: A and B are equally good athletes.

Okay, so I've got this question about the ethic of willfulness and two athletes, A and B. I'm a bit new to this concept, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says that both A and B are equally skilled. So, in terms of their actual performance or results, they're the same. But the difference is in how they got there. Athlete A inherited traits from her father that make the sport easier, so she didn't have to train as hard as B. B, on the other hand, probably had to put in more effort to reach the same skill level.

Now, the question is about the ethic of willfulness. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I can try to infer it from the context. "Willfulness" often relates to the use of one's will or determination. So, the ethic of willfulness might value effort, determination, and hard work over natural talent or ease.

So, if we apply this to the scenario, athlete B had to work harder because she didn't have the natural advantages that A had. Even though they're equally skilled now, B's path required more willpower and effort. 

The question is asking which option aligns with the ethic of willfulness. Let's look at the options:

A: A is a better athlete. But they're equally skilled, so this doesn't make sense based on skill alone.

B: B is a better athlete. This might be because B put in more effort, which the ethic of willfulness would value more.

C: B doesn't count as an athlete because training precludes athleticism. That doesn't sound right. Training usually contributes to athleticism, so this option seems incorrect.

D: A and B are equally good athletes. This is true in terms of skill, but the question is about the ethic of willfulness, which might prioritize effort over natural ability.

So, based on the ethic valuing willpower and effort, B would be considered better because she had to work harder to achieve the same level. Therefore, the answer should be option B.

The ethic of willfulness emphasizes effort, determination, and hard work over natural talent. Athlete B, who had to train harder to match A's skill level, embodies this principle more than A, who relied on inherited traits requiring less effort. Thus, B is considered the better athlete under this ethic.

Answer: B
