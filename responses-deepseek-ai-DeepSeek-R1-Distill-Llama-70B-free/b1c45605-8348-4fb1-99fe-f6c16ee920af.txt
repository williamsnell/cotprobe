Okay, so I have this question about calculating the magnetic moment of a 13C nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that the magnetic moment μ of a nucleus is related to its nuclear spin. The formula might involve the nuclear magneton and the spin quantum number. Oh right, the formula is μ = g * μ_N * I, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_N is the nuclear magneton, and I is the spin quantum number in units of ħ.

Wait, but wait. I think the magnetic moment is given by μ = μ_N * g * I, but I might be mixing up some terms. Oh wait, I think for nuclei, μ is calculated as μ = g_I * μ_N * I, where g_I is the nuclear g-factor. And I is the spin in units of ħ, so if the spin quantum number is I, then the magnetic moment is μ = g_I * μ_N * I.

Wait, no, maybe it's just proportional to I's z-component, but for the total magnetic moment, perhaps the formula is μ = μ_N * g * sqrt(I(I+1)) ). Wait, no, that's more like the total magnetic moment's magnitude. Or maybe that's for electrons. For nuclei, the magnetic moment is given by μ = g_I * μ_N * I, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the magnetic dipole moment μ is given by μ = μ_N * g * I, where I is the nuclear spin. Let me check: the nuclear magneton μ_N is a physical constant, approximately 5.050783698 × 10^-27 J/T. The nuclear g-factor varies by isotope, and I is the spin quantum number.

So, for 13C, what's its spin? Carbon-13 has a nuclear spin I of 1/2. Because I'm pretty sure that 13C is a spin-1/2 nucleus. Like, protons have spin 1/2, and 13C has a nucleus with I=1/2.

So, I think the formula is μ = g_I * μ_N * I. So I need to find the g-factor for 13C.

Wait, what's the g-factor for 13C? I'm trying to remember. For protons, the g-factor is about 5.586, but for 13C, I think it's different. I recall that for 13C, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is about 67.276 x 10^6 rad/(s·T), but wait, how does that relate to g-factor?

Hmm, maybe I should recall the relation between the gyromagnetic ratio and the g-factor. The gyromagnetic ratio γ is given by γ = (g * μ_N) / (ħ * I), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, for a nucleus, the magnetic moment μ is also given by μ = γ * ħ * I, but I might be mixing up the constants.

Wait, another approach. The nuclear magnetic moment μ is given by μ = μ_N * g_I * I. So I need the g-factor for 13C.

I think for 13C, the g-factor (g_I) is approximately 0.702. I might be confusing it with something else, but I think that's right. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: the proton has a g-factor of about 5.586, and the neutron's is about -3.826. But for a nucleus like 13C, which has 6 protons and 7 neutrons, the g-factor might be different.

Wait, maybe I should look up the specific value, but since I can't do that, I'll try to remember. Alternatively, I know that for protons, μ = μ_p = g_p * μ_N * (1/2), because I=1/2. So μ_p ≈ 5.586 * (μ_N) * (1/2). Wait, no, because the formula is μ = g_I * μ_N * I. So for protons, I=1/2, so μ_p = (5.586) * μ_N * (1/2) ≈ 2.793 μ_N.

But for 13C, I think the g-factor is about 0.702. So plugging that in: μ = 0.702 * μ_N * (1/2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. Spin of 13C is I=1/2. So the magnetic moment would be μ = g_I * μ_N * I. So with I=1/2, it's (g_I) * μ_N * (1/2).

I think the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is about 6.73 x 10^7 rad/T·s. Because the gyromagnetic ratio γ is related to μ by μ = γ * ħ * I. Wait, let me clarify the relation.

The gyromagnetic ratio γ is defined as μ = γ * I * ħ, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, γ is given by μ/(I * ħ). So perhaps I can find γ for 13C and use that to find μ.

Alternatively, the nuclear magneton μ_N is defined as (eħ)/(2m_p), where m_p is the proton mass. So μ_N ≈ 5.0507837 × 10^-27 J/T.

If I can find γ for 13C, then μ = γ * ħ * I / (2π) ? Wait, I think the gyromagnetic ratio is given by γ = (g μ_N) / ħ. So rearranging, μ = g μ_N I.

Wait, let me be precise. The magnetic moment is given by μ = g_I * μ_N * I. So for 13C, I=1/2, g_I is the g-factor. What is g_I for 13C?

I think the g-factor for 13C is approximately 0.702. So μ = 0.702 * μ_N * (1/2).

Calculating that: 0.702 * (5.05078e-27 J/T) * 0.5.

Let me compute that step by step. 0.702 times 0.5 is 0.351. Then, 0.351 * 5.05078e-27 = ?

0.351 * 5.05078 = let's compute approximately.

5 * 0.351 = 1.755

0.05078 * 0.351 ≈ 0.01782.

So total ≈ 1.755 + 0.01782 = 1.7728.

So 1.7728e-27 J/T.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match that. Hmm, let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: 9.1445e-27

B: 9.1445e-28

C: 2.1445e-27

D:5.1445e-26

E:4.1445e-27

F:3.1445e-27

G:9.1445e-26

H:1.1445e-28

I:6.1445e-27

J:0.1445e-27

Wait, none of them are around 1.77e-27. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the g-factor wrong. Maybe for 13C, the g-factor is 1.404 or something else?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between the gyromagnetic ratio and the g-factor. The gyromagnetic ratio γ is related by γ = (μ_N / ħ) * g_I * (2π). Or maybe γ = (g_I μ_N) / (ħ I). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach. The Larmor frequency ω is given by ω = γ B, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For 13C, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is about 6.7282 x 10^7 rad/(s·T). So ω = γ B.

So the magnetic moment μ is related to γ by μ = γ * ħ / (2π) * I.

Wait, let me think: The magnetic moment μ is related to the angular momentum, which for nuclear spin I is I * ħ. So μ = γ * (I ħ) / (2π) ?

Alternatively, from the formula μ = γ * ħ * I. Because γ has units of (rad s⁻¹ T⁻¹), and ħ is J s, so γ * ħ * I would have units (rad s⁻¹ T⁻¹)(J s)(unitless I) → rad J T⁻¹. Since 1 J = 1 kg m²/s², and 1 rad is dimensionless, so the unit would be J T⁻¹, which is correct for magnetic moment.

So μ = γ * ħ * I.

Given that, let's compute μ.

Given γ for 13C is about 6.7282e7 rad/(s T).

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

I is 1/2.

So μ = 6.7282e7 rad/(s T) * 1.0545718e-34 J s * (1/2).

Calculating step by step:

6.7282e7 * 1.0545718e-34 = let's compute that.

6.7282e7 = 6.7282 * 1e7.

1.0545718e-34 = 1.0545718 * 1e-34.

Multiply the two:

6.7282 * 1.0545718 ≈ 7.094 (because 6 * 1 is 6, 0.7 *1 is 0.7, so 6.7*1=6.7, 6.7 * 0.0545≈ 0.365, total ≈ 7.065? Wait, 6.7282 *1.05457 is approximately 6.7282 *1 =6.7282, 6.7282 *0.05=0.3364, so total about 7.0646.

So 7.0646e(7-34) = 7.0646e-27.

Wait, 10^7 * 10^-34 = 10^-27.

Then multiply by 1/2: 7.0646e-27 * 0.5 = 3.5323e-27 J T⁻¹.

Looking at the options, option F is 3.1445e-27, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps the exact value of γ is different.

Wait, I think the exact γ for 13C is 67.276 x 10^6 rad/(s T), so 6.7276e7. Let me use that exact value.

So γ = 6.7276e7 rad/(s T).

μ = γ * ħ * I.

So μ = 6.7276e7 * 1.0545718e-34 * 0.5.

Compute 6.7276e7 * 1.0545718e-34:

6.7276 * 1.0545718 ≈ let's compute this precisely.

6 *1.0545 is 6.327.

0.7 *1.0545 = 0.7378.

0.0276 *1.0545 ≈ approx 0.0291.

Adding them: 6.327 +0.7378 =7.0648 +0.0291=7.0939.

So 7.0939e(7-34) =7.0939e-27.

Multiply by 0.5: 3.54695e-27 J/T.

So approximately 3.547e-27 J/T.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 3.1445e-27, but it's not very close. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the g-factor approach was better.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the nuclear magneton and the g-factor approach again.

Wait, perhaps my earlier approach with g-factor was incorrect because I used the wrong g-factor. Let me think again.

Another approach: The magnetic moment of a nucleus is given by μ = g_I * μ_N * I.

For 13C, I=1/2.

What's the g-factor for 13C?

I think for 13C, the g-factor is about 0.702. So plugging in:

μ = 0.702 * 5.0507837e-27 J/T * 0.5.

Compute 0.702 * 0.5 = 0.351.

0.351 * 5.0507837e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

5.0507837 *0.351 = ?

5 * 0.351 = 1.755

0.05078 * 0.351 ≈ 0.0178.

So total ≈1.755 + 0.0178 ≈1.7728.

So 1.7728e-27 J/T.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.1445e-27, which is higher. Option E is 4.1445e-27, also higher. Hmm, none match.

Wait, perhaps the g-factor I'm recalling is incorrect. Maybe it's 1.404 instead.

Wait, I think for 13C, the g-factor is actually 1.404. Let me try that.

So μ =1.404 * 5.05078e-27 * 0.5.

1.404 *0.5 =0.702.

0.702 *5.05078e-27 ≈ same as before, about 3.54e-27.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So perhaps the g-factor is 0.702, and I=1/2, leading to μ ≈1.77e-27 J/T.

But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, I think I might have confused the nuclear g-factor with the electron g-factor.

Wait, another thought: The magnetic moment for 13C is often given as μ = μ_N * g_I * I. But perhaps I should use the nuclear magneton and the specific g-factor for 13C.

Another thing I remember is that the magnetic moment for 13C is approximately 1.216 x 10^-27 J/T. Wait, but none of the options are that. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps the correct value is around 3.5e-27 J/T, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again, option F is 3.1445e-27, which is close to my calculation when using the gyromagnetic ratio approach. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is μ = μ_N * sqrt(I(I+1)) * g_I.

Wait, that formula doesn't sound right. Because I is the spin quantum number, and the magnetic moment's magnitude is given by μ = g_I * μ_N * sqrt(I(I+1)).

Wait, no, that's for orbital angular momentum, perhaps. Or for electron spin. For nuclei, the magnetic dipole moment is given by μ = g_I * μ_N * I, where I is the spin quantum number.

Wait, but I is a quantum number, and its maximum projection is I, so the magnetic moment would be proportional to I, not sqrt(I(I+1)). So perhaps the correct formula is μ = g_I * μ_N * I.

But with that, and I=1/2, and g_I=0.702, we get μ≈0.702 *5.05e-27 *0.5 ≈0.702*2.525e-27 ≈1.77e-27. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the actual g-factor for 13C is 0.368, which when multiplied by 0.5 gives 0.184. 0.184 *5.05e-27 ≈9.28e-28, which is close to option B:9.1445e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering the g-factor. Maybe the g-factor for 13C is approximately 0.368.

So let's compute that. g_I=0.368, I=0.5.

μ=0.368 *5.05078e-27 *0.5.

0.368 *0.5 =0.184.

0.184 *5.05078e-27 ≈0.184 *5.05e-27 ≈9.28e-28 J/T.

Looking at the options, option B is 9.1445e-28, which is very close.

So perhaps the correct approach is using g_I=0.368, leading to μ≈9.28e-28, which matches option B.

But wait, where did I get 0.368 from? I'm a bit confused because I think 13C's g-factor is around 0.7, but perhaps it's lower. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the gyromagnetic ratios.

Wait, another approach: The gyromagnetic ratio γ for 13C is about 6.728e7 rad/(s T).

The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (γ ħ I) / (2π).

Because γ has units of (rad/s/T), and μ is in J/T. Let me check the units: (rad/s/T) * (J s) * (unitless I) ) → rad J/(s T). Wait, but 1 J = kg m²/s², so units would be (kg m²/s²) * rad/(s T) → not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is μ = (γ ħ I) / (2π).

So let me compute that.

γ =6.728e7 rad/(s T)

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s

I=1/2.

So μ = (6.728e7 * 1.0545718e-34 * 0.5 ) / (2π).

Compute numerator first:

6.728e7 =6.728 *1e7

1.0545718e-34 =1.0545718 *1e-34

Multiply 6.728 *1.0545718 ≈7.0938.

So 7.0938e(7-34) =7.0938e-27.

Multiply by 0.5: 3.5469e-27.

Now divide by
