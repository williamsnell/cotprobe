Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and equilibrium problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says I'm given 0.01 moles of AgCl, and I need to find out how much 1M ammonia solution is required to dissolve it. The given Keq for Ag(NH3)2 is 1.74 × 10^7, and the Ksp of AgCl is 2.8 × 10^-10. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct volume.

Hmm, I remember that when a sparingly soluble salt like AgCl is treated with a ligand (here, NH3), it can form a complex ion. The reaction, I think, is dissolution followed by complex formation. So, the AgCl would dissociate into Ag+ and Cl- ions first. Then, the Ag+ would react with ammonia to form the [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex ion.

So the overall reaction should be something like: AgCl(s) + 2 NH3(aq) → [Ag(NH3)2]+(aq) + Cl^-(aq). 

Wait, but the problem gives the Keq for the formation of the complex. Oh right, Keq is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium between the metal ion and the ligand forming the complex. So the reaction for the complex formation is: Ag+ + 2 NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)2]+, and Keq is 1.74e7, which is a large number, meaning the reaction favors the formation of the complex.

Now, the solubility of AgCl is determined by Ksp, which is Ksp = [Ag+][Cl^-] = 2.8e-10. But when we add NH3, the [Ag+] in solution decreases because it forms the complex. This decrease allows more AgCl to dissolve than it otherwise would, because Le Chatelier's principle says the system will shift to produce more Ag+.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Write the dissolution of AgCl: AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+ + Cl^- ; Ksp = 2.8e-10.

2. Write the complex formation: Ag+ + 2 NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)2]+ ; Keq = 1.74e7.

3. The overall reaction is the sum of the two steps, so AgCl(s) + 2 NH3 → [Ag(NH3)2]+ + Cl^-.

The equilibrium expression for the overall reaction would be K = ([Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-]) / [NH3]^2. But wait, no, because in the overall reaction, the only reactant is NH3 (as aq), and the products are the complex and Cl^-.

Wait, the correct K for the overall reaction is K = Ksp * Keq. Because the first reaction (Ksp) produces Ag+ and Cl^-, and the second (Keq) uses the Ag+ to form the complex. So overall, K = Ksp * Keq.

So K = (2.8e-10) * (1.74e7) = let's calculate that. 2.8e-10 * 1.74e7 = (2.8 * 1.74) * 1e-3 → 4.872 * 1e-3 = 0.004872.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 2.8 * 1.74 is 4.872, yes. And 1e-10 * 1e7 is 1e-3. So K = 0.004872. But wait, K is expressed as [Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-] / [NH3]^2. Because in the overall reaction, the only thing in solution is NH3 on the reactant side, and the products are the complex and chloride.

Wait, but in the overall reaction, the K would be K = ([Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-]) / [NH3]^2. Because when you add the two reactions:

Reaction 1: AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+ + Cl^- ; Ksp = [Ag+][Cl^-]
Reaction 2: Ag+ + 2 NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)2]+ ; Keq = [Ag(NH3)2+]/([Ag+][NH3]^2)

So overall reaction when you add them:

AgCl(s) + 2 NH3 → [Ag(NH3)2]+ + Cl^-

The K for this would be K = ( [Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-] ) / [NH3]^2.

So K = Ksp * Keq = (2.8e-10)(1.74e7) = 4.872e-3. So K = 0.004872.

Now, I need to find out how much NH3 is needed to dissolve 0.01 moles of AgCl. Let me think about the setup.

Let me consider that when AgCl dissolves in NH3, it produces [Ag(NH3)2]+ and Cl^- in a 1:1 ratio. So for every mole of AgCl that dissolves, I get one mole of [Ag(NH3)2]+ and one mole of Cl^-.

Let me let s be the solubility of AgCl in the NH3 solution. Then:

[Ag(NH3)2+] = s

[Cl^-] = s

The concentration of NH3 will be affected because it reacts with Ag+ to form the complex. Let me denote the initial concentration of NH3 as c. Assuming that x moles of NH3 are consumed per liter, but wait, since the solution volume will change, perhaps I should approach this using total moles.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the solution in terms of moles. Let me think about this.

Suppose I have V liters of 1 M NH3. So the moles of NH3 initially present are V * 1 = V moles.

When AgCl dissolves, each mole of AgCl consumes 2 moles of NH3. So if s is the moles of AgCl that dissolve, then the moles of NH3 consumed would be 2s. But wait, s would be in moles per liter, but I'm trying to think in terms of total moles. Maybe I should approach it by considering the solution's volume.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express concentrations in terms of s and the volume.

Wait, maybe I can write the expression in terms of the total volume. Let me try that.

The total moles of AgCl that dissolve is 0.01 moles, because the problem says I'm given 0.01 moles of AgCl. So s = 0.01 / V, where V is the volume of the solution in liters. Wait, no, because s is the solubility, which is moles per liter. So if I have V liters of solution, the total moles of AgCl dissolved is s * V = 0.01.

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that all 0.01 moles of AgCl dissolve in the solution, so the concentrations of the ions would be based on the volume of the solution.

Let me think: when AgCl dissolves, each mole gives one mole of Ag+ (which becomes [Ag(NH3)2]+) and one mole of Cl^-.

So, [Ag(NH3)2+] = 0.01 / V

[Cl^-] = 0.01 / V

The NH3 is initially 1 M, so initially, the concentration is 1 M, but as it reacts, some is consumed. Let me denote the initial moles of NH3 as (1 M) * V = V moles. Then, when 0.01 moles of AgCl dissolve, each mole requires 2 moles of NH3, so 0.02 moles of NH3 are consumed. Therefore, the remaining moles of NH3 would be V - 0.02.

Wait, but this might not be correct. Because the reaction is Ag+ + 2 NH3 → [Ag(NH3)2]+, so each mole of Ag+ consumes 2 moles of NH3. Since 0.01 moles of AgCl dissolve, that's 0.01 moles of Ag+, which would require 0.02 moles of NH3.

But wait, that's assuming that all the NH3 is consumed, which isn't the case. Because at equilibrium, some NH3 remains. So maybe a better approach is to set up the ICE table.

Let me set up the ICE table for the reaction:

AgCl(s) + 2 NH3 ⇌ [Ag(NH3)2]+ + Cl^-

Initially, before any reaction, the concentrations are:

[Ag(NH3)2+] = 0

[Cl^-] = 0

[NH3] = 1 M (since it's 1 M solution, and we have V liters, so moles = 1 * V. But maybe it's better to work in concentrations.)

Wait, but when the solution volume is V liters, the initial NH3 concentration is 1 M. Then, when the reaction proceeds, x moles per liter of AgCl dissolve, producing x M of [Ag(NH3)2+] and x M of Cl^-.

But for each x, 2x moles per liter of NH3 are consumed. So the equilibrium concentration of NH3 would be 1 - 2x.

Wait, but that's per liter. Hmm, but perhaps that's an oversimplification because the dissolution of AgCl adds to the volume. Wait, but if I'm adding V liters of 1 M NH3, the total volume is V liters, and the amount of NH3 is V moles. Then, when 0.01 moles of AgCl dissolve, they produce 0.01 moles of [Ag(NH3)2+] and 0.01 moles of Cl^-.

But the NH3 consumed is 2 * 0.01 = 0.02 moles. So the remaining NH3 is V (from 1 M solution) - 0.02.

Wait, but the total volume is V liters, so the concentration of NH3 at equilibrium is (V - 0.02) / V.

Similarly, the concentrations of [Ag(NH3)2+] and Cl^- are 0.01 / V each.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = ([Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-]) / [NH3]^2 = ( (0.01/V) * (0.01/V) ) / ( (V - 0.02)/V )^2 )

Simplify this:

K = ( (0.0001) / V² ) / ( ( (V - 0.02)^2 ) / V² ) )

The V² in the denominator and numerator cancel out:

K = 0.0001 / (V - 0.02)^2

We know K is 0.004872, so:

0.004872 = (0.0001) / (V - 0.02)^2

Let me solve for (V - 0.02)^2:

(V - 0.02)^2 = 0.0001 / 0.004872

Calculate 0.0001 / 0.004872: 0.0001 is 1e-4, 0.004872 is approx 4.872e-3.

So 1e-4 / 4.872e-3 ≈ (1 / 4872) * (1e-4 / 1e-3) )= Wait, perhaps better to compute numerically.

1e-4 / 4.872e-3 = (1 / 487.2) ) * 1e-1 = approximately 0.00205312.

Wait, let me compute 0.0001 / 0.004872:

0.0001 ÷ 0.004872 ≈ 0.0001 / 0.004872 ≈ 0.02053.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.004872 is about 0.004872, so 0.0001 divided by 0.004872 is about 0.0001 / 0.004872 ≈ 0.02053.

Wait, yes, because 0.004872 × 20 = 0.09744, so 0.004872 × 20.53 ≈ 0.1, so 0.004872 × 20.53 ≈ 0.1, so 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001. So 0.0001 / 0.004872 ≈ 0.02053.

So (V - 0.02)^2 = 0.02053.

Take square roots: V - 0.02 = sqrt(0.02053) ≈ 0.1433.

So V = 0.02 + 0.1433 ≈ 0.1633 liters, which is 163.3 ml.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option B: 400 ml, which is way higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let me re-express the equation correctly.

Wait, earlier I set up K as 0.004872, and the equation K = (0.01/V)^2 / [ (V - 0.02)/V )^2 ].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me check that again.

The K expression is [Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-] / [NH3]^2.

Each of those concentrations is (0.01/V), so their product is (0.01/V)^2.

The [NH3] is (initial NH3) - (2 * 0.01) because each mole of AgCl consumes 2 moles of NH3. Wait, but the initial NH3 is 1 M, so in V liters, that's V moles. So after reaction, the NH3 is V - 2*(0.01) = V - 0.02 moles.

Thus, [NH3] = (V - 0.02) / V.

So putting it into K:

K = [ (0.01/V) * (0.01/V) ) ] / [ ( (V - 0.02)/V )^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (0.0001) / V²

Denominator: ( (V - 0.02)^2 ) / V²

So K = (0.0001 / V²) / ( (V - 0.02)^2 / V² ) ) = 0.0001 / (V - 0.02)^2.

Wait, that's correct as before. So K = 0.0001 / (V - 0.02)^2.

Then, 0.004872 = 0.0001 / (V - 0.02)^2 → rearranging:

(V - 0.02)^2 = 0.0001 / 0.004872 → 0.0001 / 0.004872 ≈ 0.02053.

So (V - 0.02)^2 ≈ 0.02053 → V - 0.02 ≈ sqrt(0.02053) ≈ 0.1433 → V ≈ 0.1633 liters → 163.3 ml.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 50 ml, B:400 ml, H:200, etc. 163 isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume that all the AgCl dissolves, but instead, let s be the solubility in terms of molarity. Wait, but the problem says I'm given 0.01 moles of AgCl. So I need to find the volume that allows 0.01 moles to dissolve.

Wait, another approach: The dissolution of AgCl in NH3 can be considered as:

AgCl(s) + 2 NH3 → [Ag(NH3)2]^+ + Cl^-.

The equilibrium expression is K = ([Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-]) / [NH3]^2.

Let me let the solubility be s, which is the concentration of AgCl that dissolves. Then, [Ag(NH3)2+] = s, [Cl^-] = s, and [NH3] = 1 - 2s, assuming that the initial concentration of NH3 is 1 M. Wait, but this is only valid if s is much smaller than 1, which is probably the case since K is small? Wait, K is 0.004872, which isn't that small, so maybe 2s isn't negligible compared to 1 M.

Wait, but perhaps that's an assumption we can make. So, K = (s^2) / (1 - 2s)^2 ≈ s^2 / 1^2 → s^2 ≈ K → s ≈ sqrt(K) ≈ sqrt(0.004872) ≈ 0.0698 M.

Wait, that would mean the solubility is about 0.0698 moles per liter. But wait, that's under the assumption that 2s is negligible, which may not be correct here.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to set up the equation without approximation.

So, K = (s^2) / (1 - 2s)^2 = 0.004872.

Taking square roots on both sides: s/(1 - 2s) = sqrt(0.004872) ≈ 0.0698.

So, s = 0.0698 * (1 - 2s).

Expanding: s = 0.0698 - 0.1396 s.

Bring terms together: s + 0.1396 s = 0.0698 → 1.1396 s = 0.0698 → s ≈ 0.0698 / 1.1396 ≈ 0.06126 M.

So, s ≈ 0.06126 M.

Wait, but that's the molarity of AgCl in solution. Since I have 0.01 moles of AgCl to dissolve, the volume V would be moles/s = 0.01 / 0.06126 ≈ 0.163 liters, which is 163 ml. Again, same result as before.

But the options don't have 163 ml. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the K is actually Ksp multiplied by Keq, but I might have miscalculated that.

Wait, K
