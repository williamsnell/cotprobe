Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Falbo Factory and figuring out how many men Mr. Falbo should hire to maximize profits. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the data given is the number of men hired and the total physical product in tons per day. Wages are $50 per day per man, and each ton sells for $10. So, the goal is to find the number of men that maximizes profit.

Hmm, I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. So, I need to find for each number of men, the total revenue, total costs, and then subtract to get profit. Then, see which number gives the highest profit.

Let me lay out the data to make it clearer. The table looks like this:

Number of men | Total Product (tons/day)
1 | 15
2 | 25
3 | 33
4 | 38
5 | 42

Each man costs $50 per day, so the total labor cost for 'n' men is 50 * n. The revenue is the total product multiplied by $10 per ton, so that's 10 * total product.

So for each row, I can calculate:

- Total Revenue (TR) = 10 * Total Product
- Total Cost (TC) = 50 * Number of Men
- Profit = TR - TC

I'll compute each one step by step.

Starting with 1 man:
TR = 10 *15 = $150
TC = 50 *1 = $50
Profit = 150 -50 = $100

For 2 men:
TR=10*25=250
TC=50*2=100
Profit=250-100=150

3 men:
TR=33*10=330
TC=50*3=150
Profit=330-150=180

4 men:
TR=38*10=380
TC=50*4=200
Profit=380-200=180

Wait, same profit as 3 men. Hmm, interesting.

5 men:
TR=42*10=420
TC=50*5=250
Profit=420-250=170

So the profits are:
1 man: 100
2 men:150
3 men:180
4 men:180
5 men:170

So the maximum profit is 180, which occurs at both 3 and 4 men. But wait, the question is asking how many men he will hire to maximize profits. So, if both 3 and 4 give the same maximum, which one should he choose? Typically, in such cases, the firm would choose the lower number of workers to minimize costs, so 3 men. But wait, let's think again.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost to find the optimal point. The point where MR=MC.

Marginal product is the additional product from each worker. Let's calculate that.

Marginal Product (MP) is the change in total product when adding one more man. So:

From 1 to 2 men: 25-15=10
2 to3: 33-25=8
3 to4: 38-33=5
4 to5:42-38=4

Now, marginal revenue is the additional revenue from each MP. Since each ton sells for $10, MR per additional ton is $10, so MR per MP is 10 * MP.

Wait, no, actually, the marginal revenue product (MRP) would be MP multiplied by the price per ton. So:

MRP for each worker is MP * $10.

So:

Worker 1: Not applicable (since he's the first)
Worker 2: MP=10 → MRP=10*10=100
Worker 3: MP=8 → MRP=80
Worker 4: MP=5 → MRP=50
Worker 5: MP=4 → MRP=40

The marginal cost (MC) of hiring each worker is $50 per day.

To find the optimal number of workers, we look for where MRP=MC. So:

Compare each worker's MRP to $50.

Worker 2: MRP=100>50 → hire
Worker3: MRP=80>50 → hire
Worker4: MRP=50=50 → at this point, it's exactly equal, so hiring this worker doesn't change profit. So whether to hire or not might depend on convention, but in business, if MRP=MC, the firm is indifferent between hiring or not. So the optimal number is where MRP is just equal to MC, which is at 4 workers.

Wait, but earlier when calculating profit, both 3 and 4 workers give 180 profit. So the profit is the same whether he hires 3 or 4. So he's indifferent, but typically, he might choose to hire 4 because MRP=MC there, which is the point where adding another worker doesn't increase profit but also doesn't decrease it. But wait, after 4, adding a 5th reduces profit.

Wait, let me think again. Let's calculate the change in profit when moving from 3 to 4 workers.

At 3 workers, profit is 180. At 4, it's also 180. So, the fourth worker adds zero to the profit. Because MRP=MC, so the additional profit from hiring the fourth is MRP (50) - MC (50) = 0. So, he can hire the 4th worker without changing profit.

So, in such a scenario, maximum profit occurs at both 3 and 4. But the problem asks for how many men he will hire. So, perhaps the answer is 4, because at that point, MRP equals MC, and any more would lower profit. So he would hire up to the point where MRP=MC, which is 4.

Wait, but when I calculated profits earlier, 3 and 4 give the same. So why is that?

Because the fourth worker's MRP equals MC, so the additional profit from the fourth worker is zero. So, whether he hires 3 or 4, the total profit remains the same. Therefore, he can choose either, but perhaps the answer expects us to choose 4.

Wait, looking back, the options are A:3, B:2, C:5, D:4.

So, in the multiple-choice options, both 3 and 4 are present (A and D). So how do we decide?

In the profit table, both 3 and 4 yield 180, which is the maximum. So the correct answer could be either. But the question says "to maximize profits," so any number that achieves the maximum is correct. However, perhaps the MRP approach suggests that 4 is the optimal because that's where MRP=MC.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the maximum occurs at 3, because beyond that, adding more workers doesn't increase profit, but the same is true for 4. Hmm.

Wait, let's re-calculate the profits to be sure.

At 3 men:
TR = 33*10=330
TC=3*50=150
Profit=330-150=180.

At 4 men:
TR=38*10=380
TC=4*50=200
Profit=380-200=180.

At 5 men:
TR=42*10=420
TC=5*50=250
Profit=420-250=170.

Yes, so 3 and 4 both give 180, which is the maximum.

So the possible answers are 3 or 4, which are options A and D.

But the question is phrased as "how many men Mr.Falbo will hire". In such cases, when the profit is same, the firm is indifferent, but since the options include both, perhaps the intended answer is 4, because beyond 3, the marginal profit becomes zero, so 4 is the optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach of total profit shows that 3 and 4 are equally good, but the options are separate, so maybe the answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the marginal profit approach. Let's list the workers and their contribution to profit.

Worker 1: adds 15 tons → TR=150. Cost=50. Profit=100.

Worker 2: adds 10 tons (25-15) → TR increases by 100 (10*10). Cost increases by 50. So marginal profit is +50. Total profit now 150.

Worker3: adds 8 tons. TR increases by 80. Cost increases by 50. Marginal profit +30. Total profit 180.

Worker4: adds 5 tons. TR increases by 50. Cost increases by 50. Marginal profit 0. Total profit remains 180.

Worker5: adds 4 tons. TR increases by 40. Cost increases by 50. Marginal loss of 10. Profit drops to 170.

So, up to worker4, the profit is 180. So the maximum is at 3 and 4. So in this case, the correct number would be 4, as adding the fourth worker doesn't change the profit, but the question is which one to choose.

In the options, D is 4. So probably the answer is D.

But wait, earlier when I thought the profit is same for 3 and 4, but how? Because when you add the fourth worker, the total product increases by 5 tons, which brings in $50 more in revenue but also costs $50 more. So net effect is zero. So, whether to hire 3 or 4, profit is same.

So, the firm is indifferent between 3 and 4. But the options allow only one choice. So perhaps the answer is 3, because that's where the profit first reaches 180. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 4.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of profit maximization where MRP=MC.

So, for each worker beyond the first, we can see where MRP=MC.

Worker 2: MRP=100>50 → hire.

Worker3: MRP=80>50 → hire.

Worker4: MRP=50=50 → hire.

Worker5: MRP=40<50 → don't hire.

So, up to 4 workers, it's profitable. Therefore, the optimal is 4.

So the correct answer is D:4.

To determine how many men Mr. Falbo should hire to maximize profits, we calculate the total revenue (TR), total cost (TC), and profit for each number of men. The profit is maximized when TR exceeds TC by the greatest amount. Additionally, we consider the marginal revenue product (MRP) and marginal cost (MC) to identify the optimal point where hiring additional workers no longer increases profit.

### Data and Calculations:
The given data is as follows:

| Number of Men | Total Product (tons/day) |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1             | 15                        |
| 2             | 25                        |
| 3             | 33                        |
| 4             | 38                        |
| 5             | 42                        |

- **Total Revenue (TR)** = Total Product × $10 per ton.
- **Total Cost (TC)** = Number of Men × $50 per man.
- **Profit** = TR - TC.

#### Calculations:
1. **1 man**:  
   TR = \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \)  
   TC = \( 1 \times 50 = 50 \)  
   Profit = \( 150 - 50 = 100 \).

2. **2 men**:  
   TR = \( 25 \times 10 = 250 \)  
   TC = \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \)  
   Profit = \( 250 - 100 = 150 \).

3. **3 men**:  
   TR = \( 33 \times 10 = 330 \)  
   TC = \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \)  
   Profit = \( 330 - 150 = 180 \).

4. **4 men**:  
   TR = \( 38 \times 10 = 380 \)  
   TC = \( 4 \times 50 = 200 \)  
   Profit = \( 380 - 200 = 180 \).

5. **5 men**:  
   TR = \( 42 \times 10 = 420 \)  
   TC = \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \)  
   Profit = \( 420 - 250 = 170 \).

### Profit Summary:
- 1 man: $100  
- 2 men: $150  
- 3 men: $180  
- 4 men: $180  
- 5 men: $170  

The maximum profit of $180 occurs at both 3 and 4 men. To resolve this, we consider the marginal revenue product (MRP) and marginal cost (MC):

- **MRP** = Marginal Product × $10 per ton.  
- **MC** = $50 per man.

#### Marginal Product and MRP:
- From 1 to 2 men: MP = \( 25 - 15 = 10 \), MRP = \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).  
- From 2 to 3 men: MP = \( 33 - 25 = 8 \), MRP = \( 8 \times 10 = 80 \).  
- From 3 to 4 men: MP = \( 38 - 33 = 5 \), MRP = \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \).  
- From 4 to 5 men: MP = \( 42 - 38 = 4 \), MRP = \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \).

#### Comparison of MRP and MC:
- Hiring the 4th worker results in MRP = MC ($50 = $50), meaning the additional worker does not increase profit but also does not reduce it.  
- Hiring the 5th worker results in MRP < MC ($40 < $50), so it is not profitable.

### Conclusion:
The maximum profit of $180 is achieved at both 3 and 4 men. However, the optimal number of men to hire is 4, as this is the point where MRP equals MC, and hiring more than 4 men would reduce profits. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 4**
