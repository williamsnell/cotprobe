Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the minimum radiation frequency needed for electron-positron pair production. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that pair production is when a photon creates an electron and a positron. But it can't just happen on its own; there needs to be enough energy, right? And I think it involves the rest mass of the particles. Oh right, the rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each. Since a positron is the same mass as an electron, you need 2 * 0.511 MeV, which is 1.022 MeV total. Oh wait, but wait, because a photon's energy is what's being converted into mass here.

Wait, but I also remember that the photon's energy must be at least twice the rest energy of the electron. Because E_photon = 2 * m_e * c². Or wait, no, is it? Because maybe the photon's energy needs to be twice that because you're creating two particles. Oh, wait, no, each has mass m_e, so the total rest energy is 2m_e c². So the photon's energy must be at least that. So the minimum frequency would correspond to that energy.

Wait, but wait, I heard something about the frequency being in terms of the rest mass. So the formula should be E = h * v, where h is Planck's constant. So the minimum energy E_min is 2 * m_e c². So v_min = E_min / h. Let me write that down.

So E_min = 2 * m_e c². So v_min = (2 m_e c²) / h.

Now I need to plug in the numbers. I remember m_e is about 9.11 x 10^-31 kg. c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.

So let me calculate that step by step. First, calculate m_e c². m_e * c² would be 9.11e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Wait, (3e8)^2 is 9e16. So 9.11e-31 * 9e16 = let's see, multiply 9.11 *9 = 81.99, so 81.99e-15, which is 8.199e-14 J. So m_e c² is about 8.199e-14 J.

Since we need twice that for two particles, E_min is about 1.6398e-13 J.

Now, v_min = E_min / h = (1.6398e-13 J) / (6.626e-34 J·s). Let me calculate that.

Divide 1.6398e-13 by 6.626e-34. Let's see, 1.6398 / 6.626 is approximately 0.2474. Then 1e-13 / 1e-34 is 1e21. So 0.2474e21, which is 2.474e20 1/s.

So the minimum frequency should be around 2.47 x 10^20 Hz.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.47 x 10^20. So the answer should be B.

To determine the least radiation frequency \( v \) capable of positron-electron pair production, we start by noting that the process requires a photon to produce an electron and a positron. The minimum energy required is equal to the total rest energy of the two particles, which is \( 2m_e c^2 \), where \( m_e \) is the rest mass of an electron and \( c \) is the speed of light.

The relationship between the photon's energy and frequency is given by \( E = h \nu \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant. Substituting \( E_{\text{min}} = 2m_e c^2 \), the minimum frequency is:

\[
\nu_{\text{min}} = \frac{2m_e c^2}{h}
\]

Using the known constants:
- \( m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),

we calculate \( m_e c^2 \) as:

\[
m_e c^2 = (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) \times (3.00 \times 10^8)^2 = 8.199 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, \( E_{\text{min}} = 2m_e c^2 = 1.6398 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \). Substituting into the formula for \( \nu_{\text{min}} \):

\[
\nu_{\text{min}} = \frac{1.6398 \times 10^{-13}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 2.47 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is **B: \( 2.47 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz} \)**.
