Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about psychology investigation methods. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking to list and describe the important methods of investigation in psychology. The options are from A to J, each listing different methods.

I remember that psychology uses various research methods. Let me think about each option and what I know about them.

Option A: Placebo-controlled studies, double-blind experiments, longitudinal research. Placebo and double-blind are more common in medical or drug trials but can be used in psychology, like in testing the effectiveness of a treatment. Longitudinal studies follow the same group over time, which is definitely a psychological method. So A includes valid methods, but are they the most important or comprehensive?

Option B: Introspection, dream analysis, free association. Introspection was an early method where participants report their thoughts. Dream analysis and free association are part of Freudian psychoanalysis. These are more specific to certain areas within psychology, like the psychodynamic approach, so maybe not the broad methods used across all psychology.

Option C: Telepathy, astrology, phrenology. These sound more like pseudosciences. Telepathy isn't a scientific method, astrology is about zodiac signs, and phrenology is an outdated practice of reading skull shapes. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Individual case study, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews and surveys, experimentation. This seems comprehensive. Case studies involve in-depth analysis of individuals. Naturalistic observation is observing behavior in natural settings. Tests could be psychological assessments. Interviews and surveys are self-report methods. Experimentation is a key method in research. So D includes a broad range of methods used in psychology. This looks promising.

Option E: Case law review, cross-examination, witness testimony. These are legal terms, not psychological research methods. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Evaluation, observation, statistical analysis. Observation is a method, statistical analysis is a tool used after data collection, but evaluation is a bit vague. Not sure if this is the best fit. It doesn't mention experiments or case studies.

Option G: Deduction, induction, analogy. These are reasoning methods, not specific investigation techniques in psychology. So G is probably not the right answer.

Option H: Brain scanning, genetic mapping, evolutionary tracking. These are more biological methods. Brain scanning would be part of neuropsychology, but not the main methods across all psychology. So H is too narrow.

Option I: Psychoanalysis, behaviorism, humanistic approaches. These are theoretical approaches or schools of thought, not specific research methods. They influence how research is conducted but aren't the methods themselves. So I isn't correct.

Option J: Hypothesis testing, qualitative analysis, correlation studies. Hypothesis testing is part of experimentation. Qualitative analysis is a method, and correlation studies look for relationships without causation. These are valid, but does this cover all the major methods? It misses case studies and others.

Now, reviewing the options, D seems to cover a wide range of methods used in psychological research. It includes both qualitative (like case studies, interviews) and quantitative (experiments) approaches. Naturalistic observation is another key method. So D looks like the correct answer.

The correct answer is D. It comprehensively lists key psychological investigation methods, including case studies, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews, surveys, and experimentation, which collectively represent a broad range of approaches used in psychological research.

Answer: D
