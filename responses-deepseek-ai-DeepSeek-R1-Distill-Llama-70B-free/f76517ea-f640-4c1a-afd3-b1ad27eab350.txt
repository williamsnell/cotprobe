Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about demand elasticity, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about elasticity of demand.

Elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price. The formula for price elasticity of demand (PED) is usually given by the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. But when dealing with it mathematically, especially when you have a demand function, it's often expressed as the derivative of quantity with respect to price, multiplied by price over quantity. The formula I remember is:

PED = (dQ/Q) / (dP/P) = (dQ/dP) * (P/Q)

But wait, sometimes I've seen it written as E = (dQ/dP) * (P/Q). Oh right, and because the demand curve slopes downward, the PED is usually negative, but sometimes the absolute value is taken when interpreting it. But in this problem, the options have negative values, so I think I should keep the sign in mind.

The given demand function is p = (500 - x)/10. Let me rewrite this for clarity. Let p be the price, and x be the quantity demanded. So, p = (500 - x)/10. Alternatively, I can express this in terms of Q (quantity) for easier understanding. Let's let Q = x, so the demand equation becomes:

p = (500 - Q) / 10

I think it's easier to work with this equation when it's solved for Q in terms of p. So let's rearrange the equation to solve for Q.

Multiply both sides by 10: 10p = 500 - Q

Then, rearrange to solve for Q: Q = 500 - 10p.

Okay, so now the demand function is Q = 500 - 10p. Now, to find the price elasticity, I need to find the derivative of Q with respect to p (dQ/dp), which will give me the slope of the demand curve.

Taking the derivative of Q with respect to p: dQ/dp = -10.

So, dQ/dp is -10. Now, the formula for elasticity is E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q).

Wait, but I don't have specific values for p and Q here. Oh, right, because the elasticity can vary along the demand curve, so the elasticity is a function of p and Q. But the question is asking for the elasticity value of this demand function, which suggests that perhaps it's a constant elasticity. Let me check that.

If I plug in E = (dQ/dp)*(p/Q), and since dQ/dp is -10, then E = (-10) * (p/Q).

But from the demand equation Q = 500 - 10p, I can express Q in terms of p. Let's solve for Q again: Q = 500 -10p. So, p = (500 - Q)/10.

Wait, let me think. Maybe it's better to express p in terms of Q, then plug into E. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express E without needing specific values, but I think in this case, the elasticity might be constant because the demand function is linear.

Wait, let me think again. For a linear demand function like Q = a - bp, the price elasticity is E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q) = (-b) * (p/Q). Substituting Q from the demand function, Q = a - bp, so p = (a - Q)/b. Then, plugging into E, E = (-b) * [ ( (a - Q)/b ) / Q ] = (-b) * [ (a - Q) / (b Q) ) ] = (- (a - Q)) / Q.

Hmm, but that depends on Q, so unless a and Q are related in a specific way, the elasticity isn't constant. Wait, but maybe in this problem, the elasticity is constant. Let me test that.

Wait, let me compute E using the formula E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q). From Q = 500 - 10p, dQ/dp is -10. So E = (-10) * (p/Q).

But from Q = 500 - 10p, I can solve for p: p = (500 - Q)/10.

So substituting into E: E = (-10) * [ ( (500 - Q)/10 ) / Q ].

Simplify that: E = (-10) * (500 - Q) / (10 Q) ) = (-10) * (500 - Q) / (10 Q).

The 10 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so E = (-1) * (500 - Q)/Q.

Which is E = -(500 - Q)/Q = -(500/Q - 1) = -500/Q + 1.

Hmm, that's still dependent on Q. So unless Q is a specific value, E varies. But the problem is asking for the elasticity of the demand function, not at a particular point. This makes me think maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should express E in terms of p instead. Let me try that. From the demand equation, Q = 500 -10p, so Q = 500 -10p.

E = (-10) * (p/Q) = (-10 p) / (500 - 10p) = (-10 p) / [10*(50 - p)] ) = (-p) / (50 - p).

Wait, that's an expression in terms of p. So E = -p/(50 - p).

But that still depends on p, so unless there's a specific value of p given, E isn't a constant. But the options given are specific numbers, which suggests that E is a constant for this function. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check if this demand function has constant elasticity. Let me think again. For E to be constant, the elasticity formula would have to result in a constant value regardless of p or Q. Let me go back to the E expression.

E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q) = (-10) * (p/Q).

But from the demand equation, Q = 500 -10p, so p = (500 - Q)/10. Let's substitute p into E:

E = (-10) * [ (500 - Q)/(10) ) / Q ]

Simplify: (-10) * [ (500 - Q) / (10 Q) ) ] = (-10) * (500 - Q) / (10 Q) )

The 10s cancel: (-1) * (500 - Q)/Q = -(500 - Q)/Q.

Which is E = -(500/Q - 1) = -500/Q +1.

Hmm, this still depends on Q, so E is not constant unless 500/Q is a particular value. Wait, maybe if the demand function is such that 500 - Q is proportional to Q. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Let me consider the general formula for elasticity when the demand function is linear.

For a demand function of the form Q = a - b p, the price elasticity is E = (-b p)/(a - b p). Hmm, that's what I had earlier. So E is not constant unless a or b is zero, which would make the demand function either vertical or horizontal, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but in this problem, the options given are specific numbers, implying that E is a constant. So perhaps I'm missing a trick here. Maybe the demand function is such that it can be rewritten in a way that shows a constant elasticity.

Wait, let's look again at the original demand function: p = (500 - x)/10.

Alternatively, that's p = 50 - 0.1x, where x is quantity.

Wait, maybe I should write the demand equation as Q = 500 - 10p. So, in the form Q = a - b p, where a=500 and b=10.

The price elasticity is E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q). The derivative dQ/dp is -10, so E = (-10) * (p/Q).

But from Q = 500 -10p, we can express p in terms of Q: p = (500 - Q)/10.

So substituting into E: E = (-10) * [ (500 - Q)/10 ) / Q ]

Simplify numerator: (500 - Q)/10 divided by Q is (500 - Q)/(10 Q).

Multiply by -10: (-10) * (500 - Q)/(10 Q) )= (-1)*(500 - Q)/Q = -(500 - Q)/Q.

Which is -(500/Q - 1) = -500/Q + 1.

Wait, but this still depends on Q, so the elasticity isn't constant. Hmm, this is confusing because the question is asking for the elasticity value, implying a single number. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the elasticity at a particular point, but the problem doesn't specify a quantity or price. Wait, looking back at the question, it says, "What is the elasticity value of this demand function." So maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the elasticity is actually constant.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the demand function is such that it can be rewritten in a way that E is constant. Let me see.

Wait, if we have a demand function of the form Q = k p^n, where k and n are constants, then the elasticity E is just n, because E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q) = (k n p^{n-1}) ) * (p/(k p^n)) ) = n. So in that case, E is constant.

But our demand function is Q = 500 -10p, which is linear, not a power function, so that approach doesn't apply here. So perhaps the elasticity isn't constant, but the question expects a specific value, so maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the elasticity at a particular quantity. But the question doesn't specify a particular quantity or price, so that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I should find the elasticity when Q is 50% of maximum possible. Let me think, when p is zero, Q is 500. So maximum Q is 500 units when p=0. So halfway would be Q=250.

Let me compute E at Q=250.

At Q=250, from the demand equation: 250 = 500 -10p → 10p=500-250=250 → p=25.

So E = (-10) * (25/250) = (-10) * (1/10) = -1. So E is -1 at Q=250.

But the options don't include -1. The closest is option I: -1.5, option F: -2.0, or option J: -0.5.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider another approach. Let me compute E using the formula E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q) with the values from the demand function.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the demand function in terms of p and Q, and see if it's a rectangular hyperbola, which would imply unitary elasticity.

Wait, a rectangular hyperbola has the form p*Q = k, where k is a constant. Let me see if that's the case here.

From the demand function: p = (500 - x)/10, so p = 50 - 0.1 x.

Expressed as p = 50 - 0.1 Q.

So, p + 0.1 Q = 50 → 10p + Q = 500 → Q = 500 -10p.

Hmm, that's the same as before. So, this isn't a rectangular hyperbola because that would require p*Q = constant. So that approach doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the elasticity at a general point and see if it's a constant.

E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q) = (-10) * (p/Q).

But from Q = 500 -10p, let's solve for p: p = (500 - Q)/10.

Substitute into E: E = (-10) * [ (500 - Q)/10 ) / Q ].

Simplify numerator: (500 - Q)/10 divided by Q → (500 - Q)/(10 Q).

Multiply by (-10): (-10) * (500 - Q)/(10 Q) )= (-1) * (500 - Q)/Q → -(500 - Q)/Q.

Which is -500/Q + 1.

Hmm, this still depends on Q, so the elasticity isn't constant. But the options are constants, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the elasticity when price is a certain value. Let me try plugging in a specific Q where the elasticity is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed such that the elasticity is constant, but I'm not seeing it. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the general formula for elasticity when the demand function is linear: E = (dQ/dp) * (p/Q). For Q = a - b p, dQ/dp is -b, so E = (-b) * (p/Q).

In this case, a=500, b=10, so E = (-10) * (p/Q). But from the demand equation, Q = 500 -10p, so p = (500 - Q)/10.

Substituting into E: E = (-10) * [ (500 - Q)/10 ) / Q ] = (-10) * (500 - Q) / (10 Q).

The 10s cancel: E = (-1) * (500 - Q)/Q = -(500 - Q)/Q = (-500 + Q)/Q = (-500/Q) + 1.

This still depends on Q, so the elasticity varies along the curve. Therefore, unless the problem specifies a particular Q or p, the elasticity isn't a single value. But since the question asks for the elasticity of the demand function, perhaps I'm missing something about the form of the demand function.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the demand function is in a form that's a constant elasticity. For example, if it were Q = k p^e, then e would be the elasticity. But our function is linear, so that doesn't apply here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the demand function. Let me re-express it.

The given demand function is p = (500 - x)/10. So p = 500/10 - x/10 → p = 50 - 0.1 x.

Which is the same as x = 500 -10p.

So Q = 500 -10p, as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to recognize that for a linear demand curve, the elasticity at the midpoint is unitary (E=-1). But in this case, the options don't have -1, so that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the elasticity when p is a specific value. Let me try to compute E at p=10.

If p=10, then Q=500-10*10=400.

So E = (-10) * (10/400) = (-10)*(0.025)= -0.25. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, if p=25, then Q=500-250=250. So E = (-10)*(25/250) = (-10)*(0.1)= -1. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the elasticity at p=20.

At p=20, Q=500-200=300.

E= (-10)*(20/300) = (-10)*(1/15)= -2/3 ≈ -0.666. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the formula for elasticity of demand.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the price elasticity formula when the demand function is given as p in terms of Q. Let me think again.

The formula for elasticity when demand is expressed as p = f(Q) is E = (dp/dQ) * (Q/p).

Wait, because dp/dQ is the derivative of p with respect to Q, and since p decreases as Q increases, dp/dQ is negative.

So, E = (dp/dQ) * (Q/p). This would give a positive value because both (dp/dQ) and (Q/p) would be negative if p and Q are positive. Wait, no, (dp/dQ) is negative, and Q/p is positive, so E would be negative, which aligns with the law of demand.

Let me compute this way.

Given p = (500 - Q)/10, so dp/dQ = derivative of (500 - Q)/10 with respect to Q is (-1)/10 = -0.1.

So, dp/dQ = -0.1.

Then, E = (dp/dQ) * (Q/p) = (-0.1) * (Q/p).

But from the demand function, p = (500 - Q)/10 → Q = 500 -10p.

So, E = (-0.1) * (Q/p) = (-0.1) * (500 -10p)/p.

But that's getting complicated again. Alternatively, maybe I can express Q in terms of p.

Wait, let me try to express E in terms of Q.

From p = (500 - Q)/10 → p = 50 - 0.1 Q.

So, E = (-0.1) * (Q/p) = (-0.1) * (Q/(50 - 0.1 Q)).

Hmm, but this still depends on Q, so I'm back to the same issue.

Wait, perhaps I should pick a specific Q where things simplify. Let me try Q=100.

At Q=100, p=50 -0.1*100=40.

So E = (-0.1)*(100/40)= (-0.1)*2.5= -0.25.

Not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to compute the elasticity using a different approach. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the elasticity at the point where price is $50, but when p=50, from Q=500-10*50=200.

So, E = (-10)*(50/200)= (-10)*(0.25)= -2.5.

Wait, that's option C: -2.5.

Wait, but why would p=50 be the point of interest? Maybe because it's when Q=200, which is halfway between 0 and 500? Wait, no, because when p=0, Q=500, and as p increases, Q decreases. So at p=50, Q=200, which is 200 units. Wait, but the maximum Q is 500, so
