Okay, so I'm trying to solve this combinatorics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The company has 8 employees total: 3 managers and 5 engineers. We need to form a team of 4 employees. The condition is that the team must include at least 1 manager and at least 2 engineers. The question is asking how many different ways we can do this.

Hmm. So, I remember that in combinatorics, when we have conditions like "at least," it's often useful to break the problem into parts that satisfy those conditions. Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of possible teams and subtract the ones that don't meet the criteria. Let me consider both approaches.

First, let me understand the total number of possible teams without any restrictions. Since the order doesn't matter in a team, it's a combination problem. The total number of ways to choose 4 employees out of 8 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).

So, C(8,4) equals 70. Let me compute that: 8!/(4! * (8-4)!) = (8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2*1) = 70. So there are 70 possible ways to form any team of 4.

But now, we need to subtract the teams that don't meet the criteria. The criteria are: at least 1 manager and at least 2 engineers. So the teams we need to exclude are those that have 0 managers (all engineers) or fewer than 2 engineers.

Wait, let me clarify. The team should have at least 1 manager and at least 2 engineers. So any team that doesn't satisfy both conditions is invalid. Let me find the number of such invalid teams.

Invalid cases would be:

1. Teams with 0 managers and any number of engineers (so all engineers). Since the team size is 4, this would mean 4 engineers, but we have 5 engineers available.

2. Teams with 1 manager and 0 or 1 engineer. Because we need at least 2 engineers. Wait, no. Wait, if the team has 1 manager, the engineers would be 4-1=3, which is more than 2, so that's acceptable. Wait, no, wait: the engineers in the team would be 3, which is ≥2, so that's fine. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the invalid cases are:

- Teams with 0 managers (all engineers): regardless of how many engineers, as long as they have 0 managers, they're invalid.

- Teams that have 1 manager but fewer than 2 engineers. Wait, no—if the team has 1 manager, the rest are engineers, so 3 engineers. Which is more than 2, so that's allowed. So actually, the only invalid case is when there are 0 managers, or when the number of engineers is less than 2. Wait, but how can the number of engineers be less than 2 if we have at least 1 manager? Let's think.

Wait, the team must have at least 1 manager and at least 2 engineers. So any team that doesn't meet both is invalid. So, the invalid teams are those that have either:

a) 0 managers (so all 4 are engineers) OR

b) fewer than 2 engineers, which would mean 0 or 1 engineer. But wait, if a team has 0 engineers, that would imply 4 managers, but we only have 3 managers. So that's impossible. So the only possibility for b) is 1 engineer and 3 managers. But since there are only 3 managers, 3 managers and 1 engineer would make 4. Let me check that.

So the invalid teams are:

1. 0 managers (all engineers): 4 engineers.

2. 3 managers and 1 engineer (because that's 1 engineer, which is less than 2).

So I need to calculate how many such teams there are and subtract them from the total.

Let me compute each case.

Case 1: 0 managers, 4 engineers.

Number of ways: C(5,4) since we choose 4 engineers out of 5.

C(5,4) = 5.

Case 2: 3 managers and 1 engineer.

Number of ways: C(3,3) * C(5,1).

C(3,3) is 1, and C(5,1) is 5. So 1*5=5.

So total invalid teams: 5 (case1) +5 (case2) =10.

Therefore, the valid teams would be total teams (70) minus invalid (10) =60.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Another approach is to compute the valid cases directly.

The valid teams must have at least 1 manager and at least 2 engineers. So possible combinations are:

- 1 manager and 3 engineers.

- 2 managers and 2 engineers.

- 3 managers and 1 engineer? Wait, no. Because 3 managers and 1 engineer would mean only 1 engineer, which is less than 2. So that's invalid, right? So that can't be included.

Wait, so the valid cases are:

1. 1 manager and 3 engineers.

2. 2 managers and 2 engineers.

3. 3 managers and 1 engineer? No, because we need at least 2 engineers.

So only two valid cases: 1 and 2.

So let's compute each.

Case 1: 1 manager and 3 engineers.

C(3,1)*C(5,3)= 3 * [5!/(3!2!)] =3 *10=30.

Case 2: 2 managers and 2 engineers.

C(3,2)*C(5,2)=3 * 10=30.

Wait, 3 choose 2 is 3, and 5 choose 2 is 10. So 3*10=30.

So total valid ways:30+30=60.

Which matches the earlier result of 70-10=60.

So the answer is 60, which is option E.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 100

B:65

C:70

D:90

E:60

F:80

G:50

H:75

I:55

J:40

So E is 60.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the second approach? Let me recount.

In the second approach, I considered 1 manager and 3 engineers as 3 * 10=30.

2 managers and 2 engineers as 3 * 10=30. So total 60.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, when I subtracted the invalid cases, I got 60 as well.

So the correct answer should be E:60.

Wait, but why does the second approach give the same result as the first? Because in the first approach, I subtracted the invalid cases, and in the second, I added the valid cases. Both lead to 60.

So the answer is 60, which is option E.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to form a team of 4 employees from a company of 8 employees (3 managers and 5 engineers) that includes at least 1 manager and at least 2 engineers.

### Approach 1: Subtract Invalid Cases from Total
1. **Total number of teams without restrictions**:  
   Using the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), the total number of ways to choose 4 employees out of 8 is:  
   \[
   C(8, 4) = \frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} = 70
   \]

2. **Invalid cases**:  
   - **Case 1**: Teams with 0 managers (all engineers).  
     The number of ways to choose 4 engineers out of 5 is:  
     \[
     C(5, 4) = 5
     \]
   - **Case 2**: Teams with 3 managers and 1 engineer (only 1 engineer, which is less than 2).  
     The number of ways to choose 3 managers out of 3 and 1 engineer out of 5 is:  
     \[
     C(3, 3) \cdot C(5, 1) = 1 \cdot 5 = 5
     \]
   - Total invalid teams:  
     \[
     5 + 5 = 10
     \]

3. **Valid teams**:  
   Subtract the invalid cases from the total:  
   \[
   70 - 10 = 60
   \]

### Approach 2: Directly Calculate Valid Cases
1. **Valid cases**:  
   - **Case 1**: Teams with 1 manager and 3 engineers.  
     The number of ways to choose 1 manager out of 3 and 3 engineers out of 5 is:  
     \[
     C(3, 1) \cdot C(5, 3) = 3 \cdot 10 = 30
     \]
   - **Case 2**: Teams with 2 managers and 2 engineers.  
     The number of ways to choose 2 managers out of 3 and 2 engineers out of 5 is:  
     \[
     C(3, 2) \cdot C(5, 2) = 3 \cdot 10 = 30
     \]
   - Total valid teams:  
     \[
     30 + 30 = 60
     \]

### Final Answer
Both approaches confirm that the number of valid teams is **60**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: 60**
