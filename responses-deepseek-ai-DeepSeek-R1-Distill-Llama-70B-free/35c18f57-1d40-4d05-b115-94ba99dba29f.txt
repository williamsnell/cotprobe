Okay, so I've got this group theory question here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about a group G where for all elements a and b in G, the square of their product (ab)^2 equals the product of their squares a²b². And I need to figure out what G must necessarily be.

Hmm, right. So the condition given is (ab)^2 = a²b² for all a, b in G. Let me expand that. (ab)^2 is abab. And a²b² is a a b b. So the equation becomes abab = aabb.

Wait, but in a group, elements can be rearranged under certain conditions. Let me see. If I write abab = aabb, maybe I can manipulate this equation. Let me subtract aabb from both sides or something, but wait, in group operations, subtraction isn't the right term. Maybe I can multiply both sides by the inverse of a on the left and inverse of b² on the right? Or perhaps rearrange the equation to find a relation between a and b.

Let me try this: Starting with abab = aabb. Let's multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-2}. So, a^{-1} (abab) b^{-2} = a^{-1} (aabb) b^{-2}.

On the left side: a^{-1} a cancels to e (identity), leaving bab b^{-2} = b a b b^{-2} = b a b^{-1}.

On the right side: a^{-1} a a b b^{-2} = a b b^{-2} = a b^{-1}.

So now I have b a b^{-1} = a b^{-1}.

Hmm, let's see. Let me multiply both sides on the left by b^{-1} to get a b^{-1} = b^{-1} a b^{-1}.

Wait, maybe it's easier if I rewrite the equation as bab = a b. Because from b a b^{-1} = a b^{-1}, I can multiply both sides on the right by b to get bab = a.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. If I have bab = a, then that would imply that b a = a b^{-1}, maybe?

Wait, maybe I messed up the steps. Let's try another approach. Let me consider the original equation again: abab = aabb.

Another way to rearrange this is to note that abab equals a a b b. So, abab = a²b². Let me try to write this as (ab)(ab) = (aa)(bb).

I can rearrange the left side as a b a b and the right as a a b b. So, a b a b = a a b b.

Subtracting a a b b from both sides isn't helpful, but maybe I can factor something out. Let's try to factor a^{-1} from the left. So, a^{-1} (a b a b) = a^{-1} (a a b b). The left side becomes b a b, and the right side becomes a b b.

Wait, that doesn't seem too helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out b from the right. Let's see: on the left, ab a b = a (b a) b, and on the right, a a b b = a (a b) b.

Not sure if that helps. Maybe I should consider the commutator. The commutator of a and b is [a,b] = a b a^{-1} b^{-1}. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, another approach: since (ab)^2 = a²b², then perhaps (ab)^2 = a² b² implies that abab = aabb. So if I write this as abab = aabb, then moving the a and b around, perhaps I can find that ab = ba, which would mean the group is abelian. Because if abab = aabb, then maybe ab = ba, which would imply commutativity.

Alternatively, let's try to subtract a a b b from both sides, but in group theory, subtraction isn't the operation, so perhaps it's better to consider the equation as abab (aabb)^{-1} = e.

So, (abab)(b^{-1} a^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1}) ) = e. Wait, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, let's write abab = a²b². Let me rearrange the equation as abab e = a²b². Maybe I can factor out a from the left. So a^{-1} (abab) = bab, and on the right, a^{-1} a²b² = a b². So the equation becomes bab = a b².

Hmm, not sure. Let me try another approach. Let me take the original equation (ab)^2 = a²b², which is abab = aabb.

Let me consider moving a to the right on the left side. So, abab = a a b b.

Let me write abab as a b a b. So, a b a b = a a b b.

If I cancel a from the left on both sides, I get b a b = a b.

Then, from b a b = a b, I can write this as b a b (b^{-1} a^{-1}) ) = a b (b^{-1} a^{-1} ), which simplifies to e = a b (b^{-1} a^{-1}), which is e = [a,b]^{-1}. So [a,b] = e, which means that a and b commute. So ab=ba.

Wait, that seems promising. Let me try that again.

Starting with abab = aabb.

Let me cancel a from the left: (a^{-1} a) bab = (a^{-1} a) a b b.

Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to consider that abab = a a b b.

Let me write this as (ab)ab = a (a b) b.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me try this: If abab = aabb, then I can write abab (aabb)^{-1} = e.

So, abab * b^{-1} a^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1} = e.

Wait, no, the inverse of aabb is b^{-1} a^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1}? No, wait. The inverse of aabb is (aabb)^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1}? No, actually, no. Because (aabb)^{-1} is b^{-1} a^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1} only if it's a four-element product, but aabb is a^2 b^2, so the inverse would be (a^2 b^2)^{-1} = b^{-2} a^{-2}.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me take the equation abab = a²b². Let me write this as ab = a b a^{-1} b^{-1}? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, let me try to manipulate the equation abab = aabb. Let me multiply both sides on the right by b^{-1} a^{-1}. So:

abab * b^{-1} a^{-1} = aabb * b^{-1} a^{-1}.

The left side becomes ab a b * b^{-1} a^{-1} = ab (a b b^{-1} a^{-1}) ) = ab (a (b b^{-1}) a^{-1}) ) = ab (a e a^{-1}) ) = ab e = ab.

The right side: a a b b * b^{-1} a^{-1} = a (a b b * b^{-1} a^{-1}) ) = a (a b (b * b^{-1}) a^{-1}) ) = a (a b e a^{-1}) ) = a (a b a^{-1}) ) = a^2 b a^{-1}.

So now, from left side we have ab = a² b a^{-1}.

So, ab = a² b a^{-1}.

Let me multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} to get a^{-1} ab = a b a^{-1}.

a^{-1} a cancels to e, so left side is b. So b = a b a^{-1}.

Wait, that's interesting. So b = a b a^{-1} implies that a and b commute? Because if a b a^{-1} = b, then a b = b a.

Yes, because if a b a^{-1} = b, then multiplying both sides on the left by a gives a b = a b, which doesn't help, but wait, wait. Let me see:

If a b a^{-1} = b, then I can multiply both sides on the right by a to get a b a^{-1} a = b a.

Simplifying, a b (a^{-1} a) = a b e = a b = b a.

So a b = b a. Therefore, a and b commute.

Since this holds for all a and b in G, the group G is abelian.

So the correct answer is that G is abelian, which is option A.

Wait, let me double-check. Because if G is abelian, then certainly (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b. Because in an abelian group, ab = ba, so (ab)^2 = abab = aabb = a^2 b^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the condition implies that G is abelian.

So the answer should be option A: abelian.
</think>

The question asks about a group \( G \) where the condition \((ab)^2 = a^2b^2\) holds for all \( a, b \in G \). To analyze this, we start by expanding both sides of the equation:

\[
(ab)^2 = abab \quad \text{and} \quad a^2b^2 = aabb.
\]

The given condition becomes:

\[
abab = aabb.
\]

To simplify, we can cancel \( a \) on the left and \( b \) on the right:

\[
bab = ab.
\]

Next, we multiply both sides on the right by \( b^{-1} \):

\[
ba = ab.
\]

This shows that \( a \) and \( b \) commute, i.e., \( ab = ba \), for all \( a, b \in G \). Since this holds for all elements in \( G \), the group \( G \) must be abelian.

To confirm, in an abelian group, the commutative property \( ab = ba \) ensures that:

\[
(ab)^2 = abab = aabb = a^2b^2,
\]

which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, the group \( G \) is necessarily abelian.

The correct answer is:

**A: abelian**
