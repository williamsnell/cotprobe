Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about calculus and topology. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is True or False. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J.

**Statement 1:** Suppose f: [a, b] is a function and f has a local maximum. Then f'(x) must exist and equal 0.

Hmm, I remember from my calculus classes that when a function has a local maximum at a point, and if the function is differentiable at that point, then the derivative should be zero. But wait, does that mean that the derivative must exist in all cases?

Oh right, there's a theorem called Fermat's Theorem which states that if a function f has a local maximum at a point c in its domain, and if f is differentiable at c, then f'(c) must be zero. But wait, what if the function isn't differentiable at that point? Like, if the function has a sharp corner or a cusp there?

For example, consider the absolute value function, f(x) = |x|. It has a local minimum at x=0, but the derivative doesn't exist there because the left and right derivatives aren't the same. So, if a function has a local maximum at a point where it's not differentiable, then f'(x) doesn't exist. Therefore, Statement 1 isn't necessarily true because the derivative might not exist. So Statement 1 is False.

**Statement 2:** There exist non-constant continuous maps from R to Q.

Hmm, R is the set of real numbers, and Q is the set of rational numbers. A continuous map from R to Q would mean a function f: R → Q that's continuous.

Wait a minute, I remember that the real numbers are connected, and the image of a connected space under a continuous function is connected. But Q is totally disconnected. Because between any two rational numbers, there's an irrational. So the image of R under a continuous function would have to be an interval, which is connected. But Q isn't connected, it's totally disconnected.

So if the function is continuous, its image must be connected. So the only connected subsets of Q are single points, meaning the function would have to be constant. So there can't be any non-constant continuous functions from R to Q. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose someone defines a function like f(x) = x for x in Q, but that's only defined on Q, not R. Oh, no, the question is about maps from R to Q. So the function has to take every real number and map it to a rational. But any non-constant continuous function from R would have an interval as its image, which can't be entirely within Q because Q isn't connected. So I think my initial conclusion holds—Statement 2 is False.

So putting it together:

Statement 1: False.

Statement 2: False.

Looking at the options, looking for the combination where both are False.

Looking at the options:

Option F is False, False. So the answer should be F.

Statement 1: Suppose \( f: [a, b] \) is a function and \( f \) has a local maximum. The claim is that \( f'(x) \) must exist and equal 0. This is not necessarily true. While Fermat's Theorem states that if \( f \) is differentiable at the local maximum, then \( f'(x) = 0 \), the theorem does not guarantee the existence of the derivative \( f'(x) \) at that point. For example, if the function has a sharp corner or cusp at the local maximum, the derivative may not exist. Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.

Statement 2: The claim is that there exist non-constant continuous maps from \( \mathbb{R} \) to \( \mathbb{Q} \). This is also false. The real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) are a connected space, and the image of a connected space under a continuous function must also be connected. However, \( \mathbb{Q} \) is totally disconnected, meaning it has no nontrivial connected subsets other than single points. Thus, any continuous function from \( \mathbb{R} \) to \( \mathbb{Q} \) must be constant. Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

Combining these results, both statements are false. The correct option is:

**F: False, False**

Answer: F
