Okay, so I have this question about calculating the Larmor frequency for a proton in a magnetic field of 1 Tesla. Hmm, I remember that the Larmor frequency is related to the magnetic field strength and some constants. Let me think about what I learned in my physics classes.

Wait, the Larmor frequency is the frequency at which a proton precesses in a magnetic field. The formula, I think, is something like frequency equals (gamma times magnetic field) divided by 2π. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. But what's the value of gamma for a proton?

I recall that the gyromagnetic ratio for protons is a specific value. Oh yeah, I think it's about 42.58 MHz per Tesla. So gamma is approximately 42.58 MHz/T. So if the magnetic field B is 1 T, then the Larmor frequency would be gamma divided by 2π times B? Or wait, maybe the formula is gamma multiplied by B, and then divided by 2π, but sometimes I get confused with the exact formula.

Wait, let me clarify. The Larmor angular frequency is gamma times B. Oh right, because angular frequency is in radians per second. So the actual frequency in Hz would be (gamma * B) / (2 * π). But wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Because sometimes gamma itself is given in terms of frequency per Tesla. So if gamma is 42.58 MHz/T, then when B is 1 T, the frequency would be gamma * B divided by 2π? Or is it gamma multiplied by B?

No, wait. Let me think again. Oh, right, the Larmor frequency formula is f = (γ * B) / (2π). But wait, is that correct? Because sometimes gamma is given as the ratio in terms of 2π, so maybe I'm getting confused between the gyromagnetic ratio γ and γ' where γ' includes the 2π factor.

I think that the gyromagnetic ratio for a proton is often given as approximately 42.58 MHz/T. Wait, no, wait a second. Because I remember that the proton's gyromagnetic ratio γ is about 267.5 × 10^6 rad/(s·T). Because γ (rad/s per T) is 2π times the frequency in Hz per T. Because frequency f is in Hz, which is cycles per second, so angular frequency is 2πf, which is radians per second.

So let me put it together. The Larmor frequency formula is f = (γ * B) / (2π). So γ here is the gyromagnetic ratio in rad/(s·T). So what's γ for a proton?

I think the exact value is about 267.5 × 10^6 rad/(s·T). So if B is 1 T, then the angular frequency ω = γ * B = 267.5e6 rad/s. To get the frequency in Hz, divide ω by 2π.

So f = 267.5e6 / (2π). Let me calculate that. 267.5 million divided by 6.2832 (approx 2π). Let's see, 267.5e6 is 267,500,000. 267,500,000 divided by 6.2832. Let me approximate:

6.2832 is about 6.28. So 267.5e6 / 6.28 ≈ let's see. 267.5e6 / 6.28 is approximately (267.5e6 / 6.28) ≈ 42.58 MHz. Because 267.5 divided by approximately 6.28 is about 42.58. So 42.58 MHz.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 42.58 MHz. So the correct answer must be D.

Wait another thought: sometimes, in some contexts, people might just quote the gyromagnetic ratio as 42.58 MHz/T, which would directly give the frequency when multiplied by the magnetic field. So for B = 1 T, f is 42.58 MHz. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D.

The Larmor frequency is the frequency at which a proton precesses in a magnetic field, and it is calculated using the formula:

\[
f = \frac{\gamma \cdot B}{2\pi}
\]

Here, \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio for a proton, which is approximately \( 267.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{rad/(s·T)} \), and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength. For \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), the angular frequency \( \omega = \gamma \cdot B = 267.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{rad/s} \). Dividing this by \( 2\pi \) gives the frequency in Hz:

\[
f = \frac{267.5 \times 10^6}{2\pi} \approx 42.58 \, \text{MHz}.
\]

Thus, the Larmor frequency for a proton in a magnetic field of 1 T is approximately 42.58 MHz. This matches option D.
