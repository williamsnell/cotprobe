Okay, so I need to figure out what Stevenson's primary aim is in his paper based on the options provided. Hmm, I remember that Stevenson was a philosopher who worked on ethics, particularly on moral language and the nature of ethical judgments. His work is often associated with emotivism, which is the idea that moral statements are expressions of emotion rather than objective truths.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Provide an account of what makes right actions right. That sounds more like a deontological or consequentialist approach, where the focus is on the nature of right and wrong actions themselves.

Option B: Establish which things are good in themselves. That seems more like a question of axiology, the study of values. So, it's about what is inherently good, which might be more in line with someone like G.E. Moore.

Option C: Develop a theory of good moral character. That would relate to virtue ethics, focusing on the character of the person rather than the action. But I don't think Stevenson's main focus was on virtues.

Option D: Make ethical questions clear. This sounds like it's about the methodology or approach to understanding ethics. Stevenson, as an emotivist, was more about how moral language functions and the nature of moral judgments, which might involve clarifying what ethical questions are about.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. Stevenson's main work was "Ethics and Language," right? In that, he argued that ethical statements are not descriptive but prescriptive or emotive. They express attitudes and attempt to influence others. So his aim wasn't to determine what's right or good, but to analyze how ethical language works.

So, the primary aim would be to clarify what ethical questions are about, perhaps by examining the nature of moral language. That would align with option D: Make ethical questions clear. Alternatively, maybe it's about providing an account of what makes actions right, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Stevenson's theory is often contrasted with G.E. Moore's. Moore was into establishing what's good (option B) and providing a framework for right actions (maybe option A). Stevenson, on the other hand, focused on the meaning of moral terms. So his aim was more about understanding the nature of ethical questions, making them clear by showing they're about attitudes and prescriptions, not just descriptions.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be D: Make ethical questions clear.

Stevenson's primary aim in his paper is best captured by option D: "make ethical questions clear." His work, particularly in "Ethics and Language," focuses on the analysis of moral language and the nature of ethical judgments, emphasizing that ethical statements are emotive and prescriptive rather than purely descriptive. This aligns with clarifying the nature of ethical questions rather than determining what is right, good, or virtuous.
