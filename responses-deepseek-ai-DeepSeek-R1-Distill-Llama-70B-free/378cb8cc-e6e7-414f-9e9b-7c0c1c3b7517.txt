Okay, so I have this problem here about hydrogen gas dissociating into atoms, and I need to find the density under certain conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that hydrogen gas (H2) dissociates into atomic hydrogen (H) at high temperatures. The reaction is H2 ⇌ 2H. And it's given that at 2000°C, the gas is 33% dissociated. The pressure is 1 atm. I need to find the density, and there are multiple choices to pick from.

Wait, I remember that when a gas dissociates, the number of moles changes. Since H2 is diatomic, each molecule breaks into two atoms. So the total number of moles increases. But how does that affect the density?

Oh right, density is mass per unit volume. So I'll probably need to find the molar mass involved and use the ideal gas law. But wait, the gas isn't all dissociated—it's only 33% dissociated. So I need to find the average molar mass of the mixture.

Wait, let me think about the dissociation. Let's say I start with one mole of H2. If it's 33% dissociated, then 0.33 moles of H2 break down into 0.66 moles of H atoms. So the total moles after dissociation would be (1 - 0.33) = 0.67 moles of H2 plus 0.66 moles of H. Wait, no, that's not right. Because for every mole of H2 that dissociates, you get two moles of H. So if we have x moles of H2 dissociate, then the remaining H2 is 1 - x, and the H formed is 2x. But here, x is 33% of the initial H2, which is 0.33 moles if we started with 1 mole.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. Let's say the initial amount is n moles of H2. The degree of dissociation is 33%, so the amount dissociated is 0.33n. So the moles of H2 after dissociation would be n - 0.33n = 0.67n. And the moles of H formed would be 2 * 0.33n = 0.66n. So total moles after dissociation are 0.67n + 0.66n = 1.33n.

So the total moles increased from n to 1.33n. That makes sense because each H2 molecule becomes two H atoms. So the number of moles increases by a factor based on the dissociation.

But wait, since pressure is given as 1 atm, and assuming ideal gas behavior, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But in this case, the total number of moles affects the volume, but wait, no—the volume is the same if we're considering under the same conditions. Wait, no, the problem gives the conditions after dissociation. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

I think the approach is to calculate the molar mass of the gas mixture after dissociation and then find the density. Because density is mass/volume, and for ideal gases, density is (PM)/(RT), where PM is the molar mass, but wait, I think it's (PM)/ (RT) for density in mass per volume.

Wait, no, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Density is mass/volume, so if n is moles, then mass is nM, where M is molar mass. So, density (d) = (nM)/V = (PM)/(RT). Because n/V is P/(RT). So d = (P M) / (R T).

But wait, in this case, since the gas is a mixture of H2 and H, the molar mass isn't just 2 g/mol (for H2) or 1 g/mol (for H), but an average based on their mole fractions.

So first, I need to find the mole fractions of H2 and H in the mixture after dissociation.

Given that 33% of H2 dissociates, so initial moles of H2 is, say, 1 mole. After 33% dissociation, we have 0.67 moles H2 and 0.66 moles H. So total moles are 1.33.

So mole fraction of H2 is 0.67 / 1.33 ≈ 0.5038, and mole fraction of H is 0.66 / 1.33 ≈ 0.4963.

Now, the average molar mass M_avg = (moles of H2 * M_H2 + moles H * M_H) / total moles.

So M_H2 is 2 g/mol, M_H is 1 g/mol.

So M_avg = (0.67 * 2 + 0.66 * 1) / 1.33.

Let me calculate that: 0.67*2=1.34, 0.66*1=0.66. Sum is 1.34 + 0.66 = 2. So M_avg = 2 / 1.33 ≈ 1.5038 g/mol.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if all H2 dissociates (100%), M_avg would be (0 *2 + 2 *1)/2 = 1 g/mol. Which makes sense because it'd be all H atoms. If no dissociation, M_avg is 2. So for 33%, it's between 1 and 2. So 1.5 makes sense.

So now, M_avg is approximately 1.5038 g/mol.

Now, the density d = (P * M_avg) / (R T).

Wait, let me get the values right. Pressure P is 1 atm. Temperature is 2000°C, which is 2000 + 273.15 = 2273.15 K.

R is the gas constant. I think in units that will give density in g/L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So plug in the numbers:

d = (1 atm * 1.5038 g/mol) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 2273.15 K )

Calculate denominator first: 0.0821 * 2273 ≈ let's see, 0.0821 * 2273. Let me compute that.

0.08 * 2273 = 181.84, 0.0021 *2273≈4.77. So total ≈186.61.

So denominator ≈186.61 L·atm/(g·mol) ? Wait no, units are L·atm/(mol·K) * K → L·atm/mol.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me just compute 0.0821 * 2273.15.

2273 * 0.0821:

Compute 2273 * 0.08 = 181.84.

2273 * 0.0021 = 4.7733.

So sum is 181.84 + 4.7733 ≈186.6133.

So denominator is approximately 186.6133.

So d = (1.5038) / (186.6133) ≈ let's calculate that.

1.5038 ÷ 186.6133 ≈ approximately 0.00806 g/L.

Wait, 186.6133 × 0.008 is 1.4929. So 0.00806 would give around 1.5, which matches numerator.

So d ≈ 0.00806 g/L, which is 8.06 ×10^-3 g/L.

Looking at the options, option C is 8.07e-3, which is very close. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a rounding error.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

M_avg: 0.67 * 2 =1.34, 0.66 *1=0.66. Sum is 2. So M_avg is 2 / 1.33.

Wait, 2 ÷ 1.33 is approximately 1.50377 g/mol.

So M_avg ≈1.5038 g/mol.

Then, d = (1 * 1.5038) / (0.0821 * 2273.15).

Compute 0.0821 * 2273.15:

Let me calculate more accurately.

0.0821 * 2273.15 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

2273.15 * 0.08 = 181.852.

2273.15 * 0.0021 = ?

2273.15 * 0.002 = 4.5463.

2273.15 * 0.0001 = 0.227315.

Adding 4.5463 + 0.227315 = 4.773615.

So total is 181.852 + 4.773615 = 186.625615.

So denominator is 186.625615.

So d = 1.5038 / 186.625615 ≈ let's compute.

1.5038 ÷ 186.625615 ≈ Let me do this division.

186.625615 × 0.008 is 1.49300492.

So 0.008 is 1.493, which is just under 1.5038.

The difference is 1.5038 -1.4930 = 0.0108.

So 0.0108 / 186.625615 ≈ approx 0.0000578.

So total is 0.008 + 0.0000578 ≈ 0.0080578 g/L.

Which is 8.0578 ×10^-3 g/L, which is approximately 8.06 ×10^-3 g/L.

Looking at the options, option C is 8.07e-3, which is very close. Hmm, maybe the approximation is a bit off, but it's the closest.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in considering the moles and the average molar mass?

Wait, when I started with 1 mole H2, and 33% dissociates, so 0.33 moles H2 becomes 0.66 moles H. So remaining H2 is 0.67 moles, and H is 0.66. So total moles =1.33.

Wait, but in the ideal gas law, n is the total moles. So when computing the density, which depends on the average molar mass, I think I got that right.

Wait, another approach. Maybe using the concept of apparent molar mass.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is to calculate the number of moles per volume.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the total pressure. Since the pressure is given as 1 atm, and we have a mixture of H2 and H.

Wait, another approach: initial moles n. After dissociation, the moles change.

Wait, let me think about the initial situation. Suppose we have a container at high temperature where some H2 dissociates. The pressure remains at 1 atm. Wait, but as the gas dissociates, the number of moles increases, which would increase pressure if volume and temperature are constant. But in this problem, it's given that the pressure is 1 atm, but perhaps the volume is variable. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

But in the problem, the pressure is given as 1 atm, so perhaps it's under conditions where the volume adjusts to maintain that pressure as the gas dissociates. So the ideal gas law can be applied to the mixture.

Wait, maybe another approach: calculate the total moles after dissociation, find the volume using PV=n_total RT, then find the mass and thus density.

Wait, but I think the first approach I took was correct. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate M_avg more accurately. Let's compute 2/1.33 exactly.

1.33 is 133/100 = 1.33. So 2 ÷ 1.33 = 2 * (100/133) = 200/133 ≈1.5037594 g/mol.

So M_avg ≈1.503759 g/mol.

Then, d = (P * M_avg) / (R T)

P =1 atm, R=0.0821, T=2273.15.

So d = (1 * 1.503759) / (0.0821 * 2273.15 )

Compute denominator: 0.0821 * 2273.15.

As above, that's 186.6256.

So d = 1.503759 / 186.6256 ≈ 0.008057 g/L → 8.057 ×10^-3 g/L.

Looking at the options, option C is 8.07e-3, which is 0.00807, very close. So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations elsewhere.

Wait, the initial moles after dissociation: correct? Yes. For 33% dissociation, moles are 0.67 H2 and 0.66 H, total 1.33.

M_avg calculation: correct.

Yes, I think that's right. So the answer should be option C: 8.07 ×10^-3 g/L.
</think>

To determine the density of hydrogen gas at 2000°C when it is 33% dissociated into atomic hydrogen, we start by analyzing the dissociation process. The reaction is:

\[
\text{H}_2 \rightleftharpoons 2\text{H}
\]

### Step 1: Mole Fractions After Dissociation
Assume we start with 1 mole of H\(_2\). If 33% dissociates, then:
- Moles of H\(_2\) remaining = \( 1 - 0.33 = 0.67 \, \text{moles} \)
- Moles of H formed = \( 2 \times 0.33 = 0.66 \, \text{moles} \)

Total moles after dissociation = \( 0.67 + 0.66 = 1.33 \, \text{moles} \).

The mole fractions are:
- Mole fraction of H\(_2\) = \( \frac{0.67}{1.33} \approx 0.5038 \)
- Mole fraction of H = \( \frac{0.66}{1.33} \approx 0.4963 \)

### Step 2: Average Molar Mass of the Mixture
The molar mass of H\(_2\) is \( 2 \, \text{g/mol} \), and the molar mass of H is \( 1 \, \text{g/mol} \). The average molar mass (\( M_{\text{avg}} \)) is calculated as:

\[
M_{\text{avg}} = \left( \text{mole fraction of H}_2 \times M_{\text{H}_2} \right) + \left( \text{mole fraction of H} \times M_{\text{H}} \right)
\]

\[
M_{\text{avg}} = \left( 0.5038 \times 2 \right) + \left( 0.4963 \times 1 \right) = 1.0076 + 0.4963 = 1.5039 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Density Calculation
The density (\( d \)) of an ideal gas is given by:

\[
d = \frac{P \cdot M_{\text{avg}}}{R \cdot T}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)
- \( T = 2000 + 273.15 = 2273.15 \, \text{K} \)

Substitute the values:

\[
d = \frac{1 \cdot 1.5039}{0.0821 \cdot 2273.15}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.0821 \cdot 2273.15 \approx 186.62
\]

Now, calculate the density:

\[
d = \frac{1.5039}{186.62} \approx 0.00806 \, \text{g/L}
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The calculated density is approximately \( 8.06 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/L} \), which is closest to option **C: \( 8.07 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/L} \)**.
