Question:

A firm in a perfectly competitive industry has patented a new process for making widgets. The new process lowers the firm's average cost, meaning that this firm alone (although still a price taker) can earn real economic profits in the long run. Suppose a government study has found that the firm's new process is polluting the air and estimates the social marginal cost of widget production by this firm to be SMC = 0.5q. If the market price is $20, what should be the rate of a government-imposed excise tax to bring about optimal level of production?

Options:

A: 14
B: 18
C: 8
D: 2
E: 4
F: 20
G: 10
H: 12
I: 16
J: 6

Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about a firm in a perfectly competitive industry that has a new patented process which lowers its average cost. Because it's a perfect competitor, it's a price taker, but the new process allows it to make economic profits in the long run. Interesting. So, normally, in perfect competition, firms don't make profits in the long run because entry and exit drive profits to zero. But since they have a patent, maybe other firms can't copy this new process, so this firm can maintain profits.

Then there's a government study that found their process is polluting. The social marginal cost (SMC) is given as 0.5q. The market price is $20. The question is about finding the optimal excise tax to bring about the optimal level of production.

Wait, I think I remember that in cases where there's a negative externality, like pollution, the social marginal cost is higher than the private marginal cost. The firm doesn't account for the externality, so they produce more than the socially optimal level. The government can impose a tax to correct this.

So, the idea is to make the firm's marginal cost equal to the social marginal cost. Or wait, no. The tax would internalize the externality. So, the firm's private marginal cost is perhaps lower than the social marginal cost because they're not paying for the pollution. So, the tax should bridge that gap.

Wait, but in this case, the SMC is given as 0.5q. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The firm's private marginal cost (PMC) is probably lower than the SMC because the SMC includes the externality. So, the SMC = PMC + marginal external cost. So, the tax should be set equal to the marginal external cost.

Wait, but the question says that SMC is 0.5q. Oh wait, is that the SMC of production? So, perhaps the firm's private marginal cost is lower because they don't pay for the pollution. So, the firm's marginal cost (MC) is less than the SMC. So, the tax would make the firm's effective MC equal to the SMC.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me break it down step by step.

In a perfectly competitive market, the firm's supply curve is its marginal cost curve. Because they're price takers, they produce where P = MC. But because of the pollution, their MC is lower than the SMC. So, the market equilibrium would be where P = MC_firm, but the socially optimal point is where P = SMC.

So, the firm's MC is lower. Let me denote the firm's MC as PMC, and SMC as the social marginal cost. So, SMC = PMC + MEC, where MEC is the marginal external cost.

The government wants to tax the firm so that the firm's effective MC after tax equals the SMC. Because then, when the firm produces where P = (MC + tax), which would be P = SMC, leading to the optimal output.

Wait, but the tax is an excise tax, which is a per-unit tax. So, the firm's cost increases by the tax amount per unit. So, the tax (t) would be such that PMC + t = SMC.

So, t = SMC - PMC.

But wait, in this problem, do I know the firm's PMC? Let's see.

The problem says the firm has a new process that lowers its average cost. So, their AC is lower, but I don't know the exact value. But the market price is $20. In a perfectly competitive market, the firm produces where P=MC. So, the firm's MC at the optimal output is $20.

Wait, but the socially optimal output is where P = SMC. So, perhaps the firm, without tax, would produce more than the optimal level because their MC is lower. The tax would reduce their production to the point where their MC plus tax equals the SMC, which equals the market price.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The firm's MC is their supply. Without tax, they produce where P=MC. But the SMC is higher than their MC. So, the firm is producing more than the social optimum.

To get the social optimum, the firm should produce where P = SMC. So, the tax should be set so that when the firm decides to produce, their MC plus tax equals SMC at the point where SMC = P.

Wait, maybe I should model this mathematically.

Let me denote:

SMC = 0.5 q

Market price, P = 20.

The firm's private MC is, let's call it PMC. Since the firm is in a competitive market, without any tax, they produce where P = PMC. So, their PMC would be 20 at the quantity they produce.

But with the tax, the firm's effective MC becomes PMC + t. We want this effective MC to equal SMC at the optimal quantity.

Wait, no. Wait, the tax is per unit, so the firm's cost increases by t per unit. So, the firm's new supply curve is PMC + t. We want the firm to choose the quantity where PMC + t = SMC, and this should be equal to the market price.

But wait, the market price is given as 20, but if the tax is imposed, the market price might change, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the tax is internal, so the firm's cost increases, but the market price remains at 20 because it's a competitive market.

Wait, but in reality, if the firm is the only one with the new process, perhaps the market supply is influenced by this firm. Hmm, but the question says it's a perfectly competitive industry, so I think the market price is determined by the intersection of market supply and demand, and the firm is a price taker. So, the market price is 20, and the tax is imposed on this firm only.

Wait, but the problem says the firm is the only one with the patent, so it's the only one causing the pollution. So, the tax is on this firm's production. So, when the tax is imposed, the firm's marginal cost increases by t, so their supply shifts upwards by t. But because they're a price taker, the market price remains 20, so the firm adjusts their production.

Alternatively, perhaps the market price is 20, so the firm's after-tax MC should equal 20, but at the same time, the social marginal cost at that quantity should be 20. So, the tax is designed to make the quantity where SMC = 20. Because that's the optimal point.

Wait, but the SMC is 0.5 q. So, set 0.5 q = 20. Solving for q, q = 40. So, the optimal quantity is 40 units.

But without the tax, the firm would produce where their MC equals 20. Let's say their MC is some function. Let's call their private MC as PMC.

So, without the tax, their production is where PMC = 20. Let's say that without the tax, they produce, say, q1, where PMC(q1) = 20. But with the tax, we want them to produce q =40, where SMC=20.

Wait, but how does the tax affect this? The tax would increase their MC by t per unit. So, their new MC becomes PMC(q) + t.

At the optimal quantity q=40, SMC=20. So, the tax should make the firm's PMC(40) + t = 20.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because if the SMC is 20 at q=40, then without the tax, the firm's PMC might be lower than 20, so they would want to produce more than 40 units, but the tax would make them stop at 40.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find the tax rate t such that when the firm sets their PMC + t = 20, the quantity is 40.

Wait, that's possible. Because at q=40, SMC is 20, which is the market price. So, the firm's after-tax MC should be 20 at q=40.

So, at q=40, PMC(40) + t = 20.

But what is PMC(40)? The problem doesn't directly give me the firm's MC. Wait, but the firm's MC is the derivative of their cost curve. Wait, the problem says that the new process lowers the average cost, but doesn't give the exact AC or MC. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the firm's MC without considering the externality is such that when they produce at q where MC =20, but the SMC is higher. So, the tax is needed to make their effective MC equal to SMC at the optimal point.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal tax is the difference between SMC and the firm's MC at the optimal output level.

So, t = SMC(q) - PMC(q) at q=40.

But I don't know PMC(q). Hmm, maybe I can find it.

Wait, without the tax, the firm would produce where PMC(q) = 20. Let's call that q0. But with the tax, they should produce where PMC(q) + t =20, and SMC(q) =20.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I don't have the firm's MC function. Let me think differently.

The SMC is 0.5 q. So, at the optimal quantity, q*, SMC(q*) = P =20. So, 0.5 q* =20 → q*=40.

So, the optimal quantity is 40. Now, the firm's private marginal cost at q=40 is PMC(40). Without the tax, the firm would produce where PMC(q) =20, which might be higher than 40 if their MC is lower than SMC.

Wait, but if the firm's MC is lower than SMC, then without tax, they would produce beyond q=40, because their MC is below 20 until a higher quantity.

Wait, no. Because in a competitive market, the firm's MC is set to the market price of 20. So, they produce at q where MC(q) =20. But if their MC is lower than SMC, then their production level would be higher than the socially optimal q=40.

So, the tax should make their effective MC higher, so that at the optimal q=40, their MC + tax =20, and also, at that point, SMC=20.

Wait, perhaps the tax is the difference between SMC and MC at the optimal q.

So, t = SMC(q*) - PMC(q*).

But I don't know PMC(q*). Hmm.

Wait, but in the competitive market, without the tax, the firm's MC(q0) =20. So, q0 is where their MC=20. But with the tax, they have to adjust.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the tax is set such that the firm's after-tax MC equals SMC at the optimal point.

So, PMC(q*) + t = SMC(q*) → t = SMC(q*) - PMC(q*)

But since SMC(q*)=20, and PMC(q*) would be the firm's MC at q=40, which is... I don't know.

Wait, but perhaps the firm's MC without tax is such that at the optimal q=40, their MC is below SMC. So, the tax bridges the gap.

Wait, but without knowing the firm's MC, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the market price is 20, and the social MC at the optimal point is 20. So, the optimal output is where SMC=20 → q=40.

Now, the firm's private MC at q=40 must be less than 20 because otherwise, without the tax, they wouldn't produce more than the optimal. Wait, no. If their MC is lower, they would produce more, because MC < P.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think in terms of supply and demand.

In a competitive market, the firm's supply is MC. The market supply is the sum of all firms' MC. But in this case, the firm with the patent is the only one with lower MC, others are higher.

But perhaps the presence of this one firm lowers the market supply, but the tax is applied only to this firm.

Alternatively, perhaps the market price is given as 20, and the SMC is 0.5q. So, the optimal output is where SMC=20 → q=40.

The firm's MC is lower because they have a new process. So, without the tax, they produce where MC=20, which would be at some q higher than 40, because their MC is lower. So, to make them produce at q=40, the tax should be set so that their MC + t =20 at q=40.

Wait, but if at q=40, SMC is 20, and the firm's MC is, say, PMC, then the tax t is 20 - PMC.

But without knowing PMC, perhaps I can think that the tax is the difference between SMC and MC at q=40.

Wait, but if the firm's MC at q=40 is PMC, and the SMC is 20, then t = 20 - PMC.

But that would require knowing PMC at 40.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax is the marginal external cost at the optimal output. So, MEC = SMC - MC.

But again, without knowing MC, perhaps it's impossible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find the firm's MC at q=40. Since the firm is a price taker, without the tax, they produce where P=MC. So, if the optimal q is 40, and P=20, then without the tax, the firm's MC at 40 would be less than 20, because otherwise, they wouldn't produce beyond that point.

Wait, but that's getting me in circles.

Alternatively, maybe the tax is simply the value of the SMC at the optimal point, which is 20. But no, the SMC is 0.5q, which at q=40 is 20.

Wait, perhaps the tax is the amount that when added to the firm's MC, makes it equal to the SMC at the optimal point.

So, t = SMC(q) - MC(q).

But again, without knowing MC(q), I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the firm's MC is zero because the problem states that they have a new process that lowers their average cost. But that can't be right; MC can't be zero unless they have some special setup.

Wait, perhaps the firm's MC is lower, but the problem doesn't give specific numbers. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the optimal tax is the marginal external cost at the optimal output level.

The marginal external cost (MEC) is the difference between SMC and MC.

So, MEC = SMC - MC.

But without knowing MC, perhaps I can find it.

Wait, in the optimal case, the firm should produce where SMC = P =20, which is at q=40.

At that point, the firm's MC (private) plus the tax should equal 20.

So, PMC(40) + t = 20.

But the SMC is 0.5*40=20.

So, SMC = PMC + MEC → 20 = PMC + MEC.

But MEC is the external cost per unit. So, the tax should be equal to MEC at q=40.

So, t = MEC = 20 - PMC.

But again, I don't know PMC.

Wait, perhaps in a competitive market, the firm's MC is equal to the market price. So, without the tax, the firm's MC is 20 at their production level. But with the tax, we want their MC + tax to equal 20 at q=40.

Wait, but that would imply that at q=40, PMC(40) + t =20.

But without the tax, the firm would have produced at a higher quantity where MC=20.

Wait, perhaps the tax is the difference between the SMC and the MC at q=40.

So, t = SMC(q=40) - MC(q=40).

But if the firm's MC at 40 is less than 20, then t would be positive.

But again, without knowing MC(q=40), I can't compute it directly.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key insight. Let's think about the fact that the firm is a price taker, so their supply is determined by their MC. The market price is $20. Without the tax, they produce where MC=20. But since they have lower costs due to the new process, their MC is lower, so they produce more than the social optimum.

Wait, but the social optimum is where SMC=20. So, the tax should make the firm's MC after tax equal to 20 at q=40.

So, tax per unit is the difference between SMC and their MC at q=40.

But without knowing their MC, perhaps I need to find that MC.

Wait, perhaps the firm's MC is the same as the market supply's MC without considering the externality. But I don't think that's helpful.

Wait, alternative approach: the optimal tax is set so that the firm's after-tax MC equals the SMC at the optimal output.

So, PMC(q*) + t = SMC(q*) → t = SMC(q*) - PMC(q*).

But since the market price is 20, which is the same as SMC(q*)=20, so:

t = 20 - PMC(q=40).

But without knowing PMC(q=40), I can't compute t.

Wait, perhaps in a competitive market, the firm's MC is equal to the market price at their production level. So, without the tax, they are producing at q where MC(q) =20. Let's say that without tax, they produce q0 where MC(q0)=20. But SMC(q0) would be higher than 20, so q0 is more than 40.

With the tax, they should produce at q=40, where SMC=20. So, the tax should make the firm's MC at q=40 equal to 20.

So, PMC(q=40) + t =20.

But I don't know PMC(q=40). Unless the firm's MC is zero, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the firm's MC is 15 at q=40, so the tax would be 5. But that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The question gives me SMC=0.5q. The market price is 20. So, the optimal output is when SMC=20 → q=40.

The firm's private MC is such that, without the tax, they would produce more than 40 because their MC is lower than 20 beyond a certain point.

To make them produce 40 units, we set
