Okay, so I have this problem about vapor pressures and heats of vaporization for two liquids, A and B. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's see. The question gives some data at 40°C. For liquid A, the vapor pressure is 20 mm Hg, and for B, it's 40 mm Hg. Wait, so B has a higher vapor pressure at the same temperature. I remember that a higher vapor pressure at a given temperature means the liquid is more volatile. So B evaporates more easily than A at 40°C.

Then, the normal boiling points are given. Liquid A boils at 120°C, and B at 140°C. Wait, boiling point is the temperature where the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, right? So higher boiling point means the substance has stronger intermolecular forces because it takes more energy (higher temperature) to make the molecules escape into the vapor phase.

So B has a higher boiling point than A. That suggests that B has stronger intermolecular forces. But wait, wait, because B is more volatile at 40°C. How does that fit together? Oh, right, because volatility at a given temperature is about how much vapor is produced. A more volatile substance has higher vapor pressure at the same temp. But the boiling point is about when it turns into vapor under atmospheric pressure.

So, B has a higher boiling point (stronger forces) but is more volatile at lower temps (40°C) than A. I think that's possible because the boiling point is about the temperature where the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. So for B, at 40°C, it's way below its boiling point, so its vapor pressure is higher than A's, but when they reach their boiling points, both will have vapor pressures equal to atmospheric (760 mmHg or 1 atm).

Now, the question is about the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) of B compared to A. A's ΔHvap is given as 11.3 kcal/mol. I need to find out what B's is.

I recall that the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates vapor pressure and temperature. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). But wait, when using this equation, the assumption is that ΔHvap doesn't change much with temperature, which is probably acceptable here.

But wait, the question isn't directly about calculating ΔHvap using the Clausius equation. Because the question gives data at a single temperature (40°C) for each liquid. Hmm. Wait, but each liquid's vapor pressure at 40°C is given. I don't think I can directly compare the ΔHvap of A and B without knowing their vapor pressures at their boiling points. Oh wait, because at the boiling point (Tb), the vapor pressure is 1 atm (760 mmHg).

So maybe I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for each liquid between their boiling point and 40°C. Let me think. For each liquid, at 40°C, their vapor pressure is known, and at their boiling point, it's 760 mmHg.

So for liquid A: At 40°C (313 K), P1 = 20 mmHg. At Tboil_A (120°C = 393 K), P2 = 760 mmHg.

Similarly for B: At 40°C (313 K), P1 = 40 mmHg. At Tboil_B (140°C = 413 K), P2 = 760 mmHg.

So using the equation ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2) for each liquid.

Wait, but the equation is usually written as ln(P) = -ΔHvap/R (1/T) + C. When considering two points (P1, T1) and (P2, T2), the equation becomes ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)/(1), assuming ΔHvap is constant.

So for each substance, I can write this equation. But since the question is about comparing ΔHvap of B to A, perhaps I can set up ratios or find a relation between the two.

Let me denote for substance X (either A or B), the equation is:

ln(Pboil_X / P_X_at_40) = (ΔHvap_X / R) (1/T_at_40 - 1/Tboil_X )

Because Pboil_X is 760 mmHg, which is much higher than P_X_at_40 (20 or 40 mmHg), so the left side will be a large positive number.

Now, for each substance, I can write this equation. Let me compute the left sides and the terms on the right.

Let me compute for A first.

For A:

Pboil_A =760 mmHg, P_A =20 mmHg. So ln(760/20) = ln(38) ≈ 3.638.

T_at_40 = 313 K, Tboil_A=393 K.

So (1/313 - 1/393) = (393 - 313)/(313*393) ) = 80/(123,  313*393 is 123,  let me calculate 313*393.

Wait 300*393=117900, 13*393=5109, total 122,  117900+5109= 123,009? Wait, 313 * 393 = ?

Wait, 313 * 393. Let's compute:

313 * 400 = 125,200. Subtract 313 *7 = 2,191. So 125,200 - 2,191 = 123,009.

So denominator is 123,009. So 80 / 123,009 ≈ 0.0006508.

So the right side for A is (ΔHvap_A / R) * 0.0006508.

We know ΔHvap_A is 11.3 kcal/mol. R is the gas constant. Wait, the units matter. R is usually 8.314 J/mol·K, but since ΔH is in kcal, I should convert R to kcal units.

Because 1 kcal is 4184 J, so R = 8.314 J/mol·K = 8.314 / 4184 ≈ 0.001986 kcal/mol·K.

So, for A:

ln(38) ≈ 3.638 = (11.3 / 0.001986) * (0.0006508)

Wait, let me compute the right side.

11.3 / 0.001986 ≈ 11.3 * 504.6 ≈ let's see: 11 *500=5,500; 0.3*500=150 → 5,650. So approximately 5,650. Then multiply by 0.0006508.

5,650 * 0.0006508 ≈ 3.677.

Wait, but ln(38) is about 3.638. So our calculation gives about 3.677, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps my approximations are rough. But it's close enough.

Now, let's do the same for B.

For B:

Pboil_B =760 mmHg, P_B =40 mmHg. So ln(760/40) = ln(19) ≈ 2.944.

T_at_40=313 K, Tboil_B=413 K.

Compute (1/313 - 1/413) = (413-313)/(313*413) → 100/(313*413).

Compute 313 *413. Let me compute 300*413=123,900. 13*413=5,369. So total 123,900 +5,369=129,269.

So 100/129,269 ≈ 0.000774.

So the right side for B is (ΔHvap_B / R) * 0.000774.

But we don't know ΔHvap_B yet.

So, for B, the equation is:

ln(19) ≈ 2.944 = (ΔHvap_B / 0.001986) * 0.000774.

We can write this as:

ΔHvap_B = [2.944 * 0.001986 ] / 0.000774.

Wait, because rearranging, ΔHvap_B = [ ln(P2/P1) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator: 2.944 * 0.001986 ≈ 0.005848.

Denominator: 0.000774.

So 0.005848 / 0.000774 ≈ 7.56 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.005848 divided by 0.000774.

Let me move the decimal: 5.848e-3 /7.74e-4 = (5.848 /7.74) *10^( (-3 +4) ) = (≈0.756) * 10^1 → ≈7.56.

So ΔHvap_B is approximately 7.56 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So, rearranged: ΔHvap = [ ln(P2/P1) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So, solving for ΔHvap:

ΔHvap = [ ln(P2/P1) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, but wait, 1/T1 -1/T2 is (T2 - T1)/(T1*T2). So in the denominator, it's a positive number because T2 > T1.

In our case, for B, T1 is 313 K, T2 is 413 K.

So 1/313 - 1/413 = (413 -313)/(313*413) ) = 100/(313*413) = positive.

So the denominator is positive.

So for B, ln(P2/P1) is positive (ln(19) ≈2.944), and denominator positive, so ΔHvap is positive.

So calculation gives about 7.56 kcal/mol for B.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Compute numerator: 2.944 * 0.001986.

0.001986 * 2 = 0.003972.

0.001986 * 0.944 = let's compute that.

0.001986 *0.9= 0.0018874

0.001986 *0.044= approx 0.000087344

Adding: 0.0018874 + 0.000087344= 0.0019747.

So total numerator ≈ 0.003972 + 0.0019747= 0.0059467.

Denominator: 0.000774.

So 0.0059467 / 0.000774 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0059467 / 0.000774 = (5.9467 / 7.74) *10^(3-3)= same as 5.9467 /7.74 ≈0.7687.

Wait, 7.74 * 0.7687 is approximately 5.946.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 5.9467 ÷7.74.

Let me compute 5.9467 /7.74.

Approximately 0.7687. So 0.7687 → 7.687 when multiplied by 10.

Wait, no, because 0.0059467 /0.000774 = (5.9467e-3)/(7.74e-4) )= (5.9467 / 7.74) * (1e-3/1e-4) ) → 0.7687 *10=7.687.

So approximately 7.687 kcal/mol.

So about 7.69, which is approximately 7.7 kcal/mol.

But the options given are:

Options:

A:22.6

B:5.65

C:7.58

D:11.3

Wait, the options I see are A to J, but the given choices are A:22.6, B:5.65, C:7.58, D:11.3.

Wait, the question's options are:

A:22.6 kcal

B:5.65 kcal

C:7.58 kcal

D:11.3 kcal

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options after the question are:

(5.65 kcal/mole, 11.09 kcal/mole, 22.6 kcal/mole, less than 11.3 kcal/mole, greater than 11.09 kcal/mole, about the same, indeterminate because of insufficient data)

Wait, perhaps I misread earlier. So looking back:

The options are:

A:22.6 kcal

B:5.65 kcal

C:7.58 kcal

D:11.3 kcal

Wait, but the problem mentions the options as:

A through to J, but in the problem statement, I think the options are more than that.

Wait, the problem statement says "selecting from the answer A through to J", but then gives options as:

Options:

A: 22.6 kcal

B:5.65 kcal

C:7.58 kcal

D:11.3 kcal

Wait, perhaps the actual options are as presented in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the options are labeled A to J, each with certain values, but the user presented the options as A, B, C, D. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the options include the values given in the problem statement.

Wait, the question is which best describes the heat of vaporization of B.

So according to my calculation, it's approximately 7.58 kcal/mol, which is option C.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because I don't want to make a mistake.

Alternative approach: perhaps using the Antoine equation or considering the relation between vapor pressure and heat of vaporization.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

ΔHvap = (R * T1 * T2 / (T2 - T1)) * ln(P2/P1)

Wait, let me derive that.

We have ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Which can be written as:

ΔHvap = [ ln(P2/P1) * R ] / [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Which is [ ln(P2/P1) * R * T1 T2 ] / (T2 - T1 )

So, ΔHvap = ( R * ln(P2/P1) * T1 T2 ) / (T2 - T1 )

So, let's compute that for B.

For B, P2=760, P1=40, so ln(760/40)=ln(19)=2.944.

T1=313 K, T2=413 K.

Compute numerator: 2.944 * R * 313 * 413.

R is 0.001986 kcal/mol·K.

So 2.944 * 0.001986 = 0.005846.

Multiply by 313 *413.

313 *413 = let's compute that:

300*413=123900,

13*413=5369,

Total=123900 +5369=129,269.

So 0.005846 * 129,269 = let's compute.

Compute 129,269 * 0.005846.

Hmm, 129,269 * 5.846e-3.

129,269 *5 =646,345.

129,269 *0.846= approx 129,269 *0.8 =103,415.2; 129,269 *0.046≈5,946. So about 103,415 +5,946=109,361.

So total 646,345 +109,361=755,706.

Wait, wait, no. Because 5.846e-3 is 0.005846. So 129,269 *0.005846.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 129,269 *0.005 =646.345,

129,269 *0.000846 = approx 129,269 *0.0008=103.415; 129,269 *0.000046≈5.946.

So 0.005 is 646.345,

0.000846 is 103.415 +5.946=109.361.

So total 646.345 +109.361=755.706.

Denominator: T2 - T1 =413-313=100.

So ΔHvap =755.706 /100 =7.557 kcal/mol.

So about 7.557, which is approximately 7.56 kcal/mol. Looking at the options, option C is 7.58 kcal, which is very close.

Therefore, the heat of vaporization of B is approximately 7.56 kcal/mol, which is close to option C (7.58 kcal). So the best description would be option C.

But wait, the given options in the problem are labeled as A to J, but in the problem statement, the options are presented as:

(5.65 kcal/mole, 11.09 kcal/mole, 22.6 kcal/mole, less than 11.3 kcal/mole, greater than 11.09 kcal/mole, about the same, indeterminate because of insufficient data)

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine. Wait, the problem's initial options are:

Options:

A: 22.6 kcal

B:5.65 kcal

C:7.58 kcal

D:11.3 kcal

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options are presented as multiple choices, but perhaps the options are as I've just listed, and the correct answer is C (7.58 kcal), which is option C.

So the answer should be C.
</think>

To determine the heat of vaporization of liquid B ($\Delta H_{\text{vap,B}}$), we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

Here:
- $P_2$ and $P_1$ are the vapor pressures at temperatures $T_2$ and $T_1$, respectively.
- $R$ is the gas constant, converted to kcal units as $R = 0.001986 \, \text{kcal/mol·
