Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about calculating the work done when 18.0 grams of liquid water are vaporized at 100°C against a constant external pressure of 1.00 atm. They've given me some values, like the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) as 9.7 kcal per mole, and the enthalpy of fusion (ΔH_fus) as 1.4 kcal per mole. Oh wait, but wait—wait, do I need the fusion here? Because the process is vaporization, so maybe fusion isn't directly involved. Hmm, but maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps it's part of a step I'm missing.

Other data given includes the gas constant R, which is 0.0820 L·atm/(mol·K), or 1.99 cal/(mol·K). Density of liquid water is 1.00 g/cm³, and the molecular weight of water is 18.0 g/mol. The options are all in cal, so I need to make sure my units are consistent.

Wait, the question is about work done during vaporization. I remember that work done by the system during expansion is calculated using w = -P_ext ΔV. So I need to find the change in volume when the liquid turns into vapor. But wait, because water is being vaporized, it's going from liquid to gas, so the volume change is V_gas minus V_liquid. Since the volume of the liquid is negligible compared to the gas, I can approximate ΔV as just the volume of the gas.

So first, I should find out how many moles of water I have. The mass given is 18.0 grams, and the molecular weight is 18.0 g/mol. So moles = mass/molar mass = 18.0 / 18.0 = 1 mole. That's easy.

Now, at 100°C, which is 373 K, and pressure is 1.00 atm. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. So V = nRT/P. Plugging in the numbers: n is 1 mole, R is 0.0820 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 373 K, and P is 1.00 atm.

Calculating that: V = (1)(0.0820)(373) / 1 = 0.0820 * 373. Let me compute that. 373 * 0.08 is 29.84, and 373 * 0.002 is 0.746, so total is about 30.586 liters. So the volume of the gas is approximately 30.586 L.

The volume of the liquid: since density is 1.00 g/cm³, which is 1 g/mL. 18 grams would be 18 mL, which is 0.018 liters. So the change in volume is roughly 30.586 - 0.018 = 30.568 L. But since the liquid volume is so small, it's often neglected, so maybe I can just use 30.586 L for ΔV.

Wait, but work done is w = -P_ext ΔV. Since the system is expanding, work is done by the system, so it's negative. But the question is asking for the work done, so I think in the context of the problem, they might be asking for the magnitude, but I'm not sure. Oh, but looking at the answer options, they're all positive, so maybe I should just take the absolute value here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the work done against the external pressure, which is the same as the work done by the system. So let's proceed.

So, work done (w) is P_ext multiplied by the change in volume. But wait, the units need to be consistent. Since P is in atm and V is in liters, the product will be in L·atm. But I need to convert this to calories because the options are in cal.

I remember that 1 L·atm is equal to approximately 24.217 cal (since 1 cal is about 4.184 J, and 1 L·atm is about 101.325 J). So to convert from L·atm to cal, I can use that factor.

So first, compute the work in L·atm. P_ext is 1.00 atm, ΔV is 30.568 L. So work is 1.00 atm * 30.568 L = 30.568 L·atm.

Now convert that to calories: 30.568 L·atm * (24.217 cal / 1 L·atm) ≈ let me compute that.

30.568 * 24.217. Let's approximate:

30 * 24 is 720. 0.568 *24 is about 13.632. So 720 + 13.632 = 733.632. But wait, wait, 24.217 is a little more than 24.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 30.568 * 24.217.

30 * 24.217 = 726.51

0.568 *24.217: Let's calculate 0.5 *24.217 =12.1085, 0.068 *24.217≈1.6387. So total is approximately 12.1085 + 1.6387 ≈ 13.747.

So 726.51 +13.747 ≈ 740.257 cal. So approximately 740 cal.

But wait, the question is about the work done when vaporizing. However, I recall that the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) is given as 9.7 kcal/mol. Wait a minute, but how does that tie in with the work done?

Wait, no. The work done is part of the enthalpy change. Because at constant pressure, the enthalpy change (ΔH) is equal to q_p, the heat absorbed at constant pressure. And ΔH is also equal to the internal energy change plus the work done: ΔH = ΔU + PΔV. So the work done (w) is PΔV, but that's also equal to nRT (since PV = nRT).

But wait, in this problem, I'm being asked to calculate the work done when vaporizing the water. So the work done by the system is w = -P_ext ΔV. Since the system is expanding, the work is negative as the system does work on the surroundings. But the question is phrased as "work done" without specifying direction, so perhaps they just want the magnitude.

But another angle: the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) is the heat required to vaporize a mole of substance at constant pressure. So for 1 mole, ΔH_vap is 9700 cal (since 1 kcal is 1000 cal). So 9.7 kcal is 9700 cal.

Wait, but wait. The work I calculated earlier was about 740 cal, which is lower than the ΔH_vap. But the two are different things. ΔH includes the heat, which is a combination of the internal energy change plus the work done.

Hmm, but the question isn't asking for the heat, it's asking for the work done. So perhaps my initial approach is correct. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the process isn't just vaporization. Wait, because the problem states "vaporized at 100°C", which is the boiling point. So the process is liquid → gas at constant temperature. So the work done should be the PΔV we calculated earlier.

Wait, but the given options don't have 740 as one of them. Looking back, the options are A:650, B:540, C:500, D:742.17, E:610, F:750, etc. Oh, option D is 742.17 cal, which is very close to my calculation of ~740 cal. So that might be the intended answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute 30.568 L·atm multiplied by 24.217 cal/(L·atm):

30.568 * 24.217 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

30 * 24.217 = 726.51

0.568 *24.217:

0.5 *24.217 =12.1085

0.06 *24.217=1.45302

0.008 *24.217=0.193736

Adding these: 12.1085 + 1.45302 =13.56152 +0.193736=13.755256

So total is 726.51 +13.755256 =740.265256 cal.

So approximately 740.27 cal. The closest option is D:742.17 cal.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the volume. Let me recheck the ideal gas calculation.

V = nRT/P.

n=1 mole, R=0.0820 L·atm/(mol·K), T=373 K, P=1 atm.

So V = 1 * 0.0820 *373 = let's compute 373 *0.0820.

373 * 0.08 = 29.84.

373 * 0.002 = 0.746.

So 29.84 + 0.746 =30.586 liters. So V=30.586 L.

So ΔV is 30.586 L (since the liquid's volume is negligible).

So w = -P_ext * ΔV = -1.00 atm *30.586 L = -30.586 L·atm.

Convert that to calories: 30.586 L·atm * 24.217 cal/(L·atm) = let's calculate that precisely.

30.586 *24.217.

Let me compute 30 *24.217 =726.51.

0.586 *24.217: Let's compute 0.5*24.217=12.1085, 0.08*24.217=1.93736, 0.006*24.217=0.145302.

Adding those: 12.1085 +1.93736=14.04586 +0.145302=14.191162.

So 30.586 *24.217 =726.51 +14.191162=740.701162 cal. So approximately 740.70 cal.

Wait, the option D is 742.17 cal. Hmm, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the calculation requires more precise values. Let me compute 30.586 multiplied by 24.217.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately. Let me compute 30.586 *24.217.

Breaking it down:

24.217 =24 + 0.217.

30.586 *24 = let's compute 30 *24=720, 0.586 *24=14.064. So 720 +14.064=734.064.

30.586 *0.217: compute 30 *0.217=6.51, 0.586 *0.217.

0.5 *0.217=0.1085, 0.08 *0.217=0.01736, 0.006*0.217=0.001302. So adding 0.1085 +0.01736=0.12586 +0.001302=0.127162.

So 0.586 *0.217=0.127162.

So 30.586 *0.217 =6.51 +0.127162=6.637162.

Now, total 30.586 *24.217 =734.064 +6.637162=740.701162 cal.

So approximately 740.70 cal. The closest option is D:742.17. Hmm, but that's a bit off. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, another thought: Did I account for the moles correctly? The mass is 18.0g, molar mass 18.0, so 1 mole. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the sign. But the options are all positive, so I think they just want the magnitude. So 740.70 is close to 741, but the option is 742.17. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the volume. Let me check the ideal gas law again.

V = nRT/P. n=1, R=0.0820, T=373.

0.0820 *373 = let's compute 373 *0.08 =29.84, 373 *0.002=0.746. Sum is 30.586 L. That's correct.

Wait, maybe the pressure is in a different unit? No, the problem states 1.00 atm, which matches the R units.

Wait, perhaps the conversion factor from L·atm to cal is more precise. Let me check: 1 L·atm is approximately 24.217 cal.

Wait, let me compute 30.586 L·atm *24.217 cal/(L·atm).

30.586 *24.217 = ?

Let me compute 30 *24.217 =726.51.

0.586 *24.217: as before, 0.586 *24=14.064, 0.586 *0.217≈0.127.

So 14.064 +0.127=14.191.

So total is 726.51 +14.191=740.701 cal.

Hmmm. So 740.70, but the option is 742.17. That's a difference of about 1.47 cal. Maybe I should be more precise with the multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more decimal places in the R value. Wait, R was given as 0.0820. So perhaps the precise calculation is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the work done to be calculated using the enthalpy of vaporization. Because sometimes, the work is approximated as ΔH_vap - ΔH_fus, but wait, why would that be the case?

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) is the heat absorbed when a liquid vaporizes at constant pressure. And since ΔH = q_p = ΔU + PΔV, then the work done (w = -PΔV) would be ΔH - ΔU. But without knowing ΔU, I can't compute it that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done is part of the enthalpy. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the work done at constant pressure, which is PΔV. Which is exactly what I computed earlier. So my calculation of approximately 740.7 cal would be the work done.

Looking at the options, option D is 742.17 cal. So that's very close. Maybe the slight difference comes from more precise calculation of the ideal gas volume.

Wait, let me compute the exact value of nRT/P.

n=1, R=0.082057 (exact value is 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K)), T=373.15 K (since 100°C is 373.15 K).

So V = (1)(0.082057)(373.15) /1 = let's compute that.

0.082057 *373.15 = ?

Hmm, 373.15 *0.08 = 29.852, 373.15 *0.002057.

Compute 373.15 *0.002 =0.7463.

373.15 *0.000057≈0.02126.

So 0.7463 +0.02126≈0.76756.

So total V=29.852 +0.76756≈30.6196 L.

Wait, that's more precise: V≈30.6196 L.

Now, w = PΔV =1 atm *30.6196 L =30.6196 L·atm.

Convert to cal: 30.6196 *24.217 ≈ ?

30 *24.217=726.51.

0.6196 *24.217≈ let's compute 0.6*24.217=14.5302, 0.0196*24.217≈0.4743.

So 14.5302 +0.4743=15.0045.

So total w=726.51 +15.0045=741.5145 cal.

Approximately 741.51 cal. So the closest option is D:742.17. The difference is about 0.66 cal. Maybe the exact calculation with more precise numbers would get to 742.17.

Another thought: perhaps I should be using the value of R as 0.08206 (which is a more precise value than 0.0820). Let me try that.

V = nRT/P =1 *0.08206 *373.15 /1.

Compute 0.08206 *373.15:

373.15 *0.08206 = let's compute it step by step.

373 *0.08 =29.84.

373 *0.00206=0.768.

0.15 *0.08=0.012.

0.15 *0.00206=0.000309.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 373.15 *0.08206.

Let me compute 373.15 *0.08 =29.852.

373.15 *0.00206= let's compute 373.15 *0.002=0.7463, and 373.15 *0.00006=0.022389. So sum is 0.7463 +0.022389=0.768689.

So total V=29.852 +0.768689=30.620689 L.

So w =1 atm *30.620689 L =30.620689 L·atm.

Convert to calories: 30.620689 *24.217 = let me compute 30 *24.217=726.51.

0.620689 *24.217.

Compute 0.6 *24.217=14.5302.

0.020689 *24.217≈0.020689*24=0.496536, 0.020689*0.217≈0.004489.

So 0.496536 +0.004489≈0.501025.

So 0.620689 *24.217≈14.5302 +0.501025≈15.031225.

So total w=726.51 +15.031225≈741.5412 cal. Still about 741.54 cal.

Hmm. The option D is 742.17, which is 0.63 cal higher than my calculation. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps
