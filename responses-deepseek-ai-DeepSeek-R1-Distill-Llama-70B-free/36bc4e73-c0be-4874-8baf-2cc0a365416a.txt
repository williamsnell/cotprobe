Okay, so I've got this question about transformers and maximum efficiency. Hmm, I remember that transformers have losses, and maximum efficiency happens when the copper losses equal the core losses. Wait, let me think about that again.

The question gives me a 10kVA transformer with a 240V secondary winding. The equivalent internal resistance is 0.048 ohms, and the core loss is 75W. I need to find the load kVA where the transformer operates at maximum efficiency.

Wait, maximum efficiency occurs when the copper losses (I²R) equal the iron or core losses. Oh right, because total losses are the sum of both. So when they're equal, the total loss is minimized, leading to maximum efficiency.

So first, I should figure out the current when the copper losses equal the core losses. Core loss is given as 75W. So the copper loss at max efficiency should also be 75W.

The formula for copper loss is I² * R. So I can solve for I, the current.

R is 0.048 ohms. So I² = 75W / 0.048Ω. Let's calculate that. 75 divided by 0.048. Let me do that division. 75 / 0.048 is approximately 1562.5. So I squared is 1562.5, so I is sqrt(1562.5). Let's compute that. The square root of 1562.5 is about 39.53 A.

But wait, that current is the secondary current, right? Because the resistance is referred to the secondary winding. So the secondary current at max efficiency is around 39.53 A.

Now, I need to find the kVA load. The secondary voltage is 240V. So the apparent power (kVA) is voltage multiplied by current. So 240V * 39.53A. Let's see, 240 * 40 is 9600, so 240 * 39.53 is a bit less. Let me compute it: 240 * 39.53 = 240*(39 + 0.53) = 240*39 = 9360 plus 240*0.53=127.2. So 9360 + 127.2 = 9487.2 VA, which is about 9.487 kVA.

Wait but the transformer is rated for 10kVA. So 9.487 is less than 10. So the load is 9487/10000 = 0.9487, so about 94.87% of rated load. Looking at the options, option D is 95%, and option J is 80%. So the closest is D: 95%.

Wait, but the calculation gave me around 94.87, which is almost 95%. So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the load at which the transformer operates at maximum efficiency, we use the principle that maximum efficiency occurs when the copper losses (I²R) equal the core losses. 

Given:
- Rated capacity = 10 kVA
- Secondary voltage (V) = 240 V
- Equivalent internal resistance referred to the secondary (R) = 0.048 Ω
- Core loss (P_core) = 75 W

### Step 1: Calculate the current for maximum efficiency
At maximum efficiency, copper losses (P_copper) equal core losses:
\[
P_{\text{copper}} = P_{\text{core}} = 75 \, \text{W}
\]
Using the formula for copper losses:
\[
P_{\text{copper}} = I^2 R
\]
Solving for \(I\):
\[
I^2 = \frac{P_{\text{copper}}}{R} = \frac{75}{0.048} \approx 1562.5
\]
\[
I = \sqrt{1562.5} \approx 39.53 \, \text{A}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the apparent power (kVA)
The apparent power (S) is given by:
\[
S = V \cdot I
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
S = 240 \cdot 39.53 \approx 9487.2 \, \text{VA} = 9.487 \, \text{kVA}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the rated load
The transformer is rated for 10 kVA. To find the percentage of the rated load:
\[
\text{Percentage load} = \frac{9.487}{10} \cdot 100 \approx 94.87\%
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The closest option to 94.87% is **95% of rated load**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
