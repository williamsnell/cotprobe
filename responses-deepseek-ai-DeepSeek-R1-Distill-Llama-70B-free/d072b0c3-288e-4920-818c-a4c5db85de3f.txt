Okay, so I've got this electroplating problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my electrochemistry, but let's see if I can work through it step by step. The question is about finding the weight of nickel deposited on the cathode when a certain current flows for a specific time. 

Alright, first, I remember that electroplating uses electrolysis, which is basically the opposite of a galvanic cell. In electrolysis, electrical energy is used to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. For nickel plating, the nickel ions (Ni²+) are being deposited onto the cathode.

The main formula I think I need here is Faraday's laws of electrolysis. From what I recall, the first law says that the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the amount of electricity used. And the second law relates the amount to the equivalent weight of the substance, which is the molar mass divided by the valence (or the charge on the ion).

So the formula I need is: mass deposited (m) = (Q * M) / (n * F)

Where:
- Q is the total charge in coulombs,
- M is the molar mass of the substance,
- n is the valence or number of moles of electrons transferred,
- F is Faraday's constant, approximately 96485 C/mol.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total charge Q. Charge is current multiplied by time. The current given is 4.02 amperes, and the time is 1000 minutes. But wait, time is in minutes, and current is in seconds, so I need to convert minutes to seconds.

So time in seconds is 1000 minutes * 60 seconds per minute. Let me compute that: 1000 * 60 = 60,000 seconds.

Now, Q = I * t = 4.02 A * 60,000 s. Let's do that multiplication. 4 * 60,000 is 240,000. 0.02 * 60,000 is 1,200. So 240,000 + 1,200 = 241,200 coulombs. Wait, no, wait, 4.02 * 60,000. Alternatively, 60,000 *4 is 240,000, plus 60,000 *0.02 is 1,200. So yes, total 241,200 C. So Q = 241,200 C.

Next, the molar mass of Ni. I think Nickel has an atomic weight of about 58.69 g/mol. So M = 58.69 g/mol.

Valence, n, is the charge on the ion. Since it's Ni²+, the charge is +2. So n = 2.

Faraday's constant F is 96,485 C/mol.

Putting it all into the formula: m = (241200 C * 58.69 g/mol) / (2 * 96485 C/mol)

Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * 96485 = 192,970 C/mol.

Now the numerator: 241200 * 58.69. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute that step by step.

241200 * 50 = 12,060,000.

241200 * 8 = 1,929,600.

241200 * 0.69: Let's compute 241200 * 0.6 = 144,720 and 241200 * 0.09 = 21,708. So total 144720 + 21708 = 166,428.

So adding all together: 12,060,000 + 1,929,600 = 13,989,600. Plus 166,428 gives 14,156,028.

Wait, wait, I think I might have messed up the decimal placement. Let me check:

Wait, 241200 * 58.69.

Breaking it down: 58.69 = 50 + 8 + 0.69.

So 241200 * 50 = 12,060,000.

241200 * 8 = 1,929,600.

241200 * 0.69: Let's compute 241200 * 0.6 = 144,720; 241200 * 0.09 = 21,708. So 144720 + 21708 = 166,428.

Adding all together: 12,060,000 + 1,929,600 = 13,989,600.

13,989,600 + 166,428 = 14,156,028 grams? No, wait, no, the units would be in grams per ... wait, no, the numerator is (C * g/mol) so the units would be C·g/mol.

Wait, but the denominator is C/mol, so when you divide, the C cancels, and you're left with g/mol multiplied by something, but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the units. Let me just compute the numbers.

So numerator is 241200 *58.69 = 14,156,028 g·C/mol.

Denominator is 192,970 C/mol.

So m = 14,156,028 / 192,970.

Let me compute that division.

Hmm, 192,970 times 70 is 192,970 *70 = let's see. 192,970 *7 = 1,350,790. So times 10 is 13,507,900. So 70 is 13,507,900. Wait, 192,970 *70 = 13,507,900.

Our numerator is 14,156,028, which is larger. Let me see how much.

14,156,028 - 13,507,900 = 648,128.

Now, 192,970 *3 is 578,910. That leaves 648,128 - 578,910 = 69,218.

So that's 70 + 3 = 73, and then 69,218 left.

192,970 times 0.358 would be roughly 69,218 (since 192970 * 0.3 = 57,891; 0.358*192970 = let's compute 192970 * 0.35 = 67,589.5. 0.008 *192970 = 1,543.76. So 67589.5 +1543.76= 69133.26. Close enough.

So 70 +3 +0.358 = 73.358.

So m ≈ 73.358 grams.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have a 73g option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the math. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me compute 241200 *58.69 correctly.

Wait, perhaps a calculator approach:

241200 multiplied by 58.69.

Compute 241200 * 50 = 12,060,000.

241200 *8 = 1,929,600.

241200 *0.69 = let's compute:

0.6 * 241200 = 144,720.

0.09 *241200 = 21,708.

So 144720 + 21708 = 166,428.

Now, adding all three: 12,060,000 + 1,929,600 = 14, (wait, 12 million plus 1.9 million is 13,989,600), plus 166,428 gives 14,156,028.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, 14,156,028 divided by 192,970.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

192,970 times 70 is 13,507,900 as I had before.

14,156,028 minus 13,507,900 is 648,128.

Now, 192,970 * 3 is 578,910.

So 648,128 - 578,910 = 69,218.

192,970 * 0.358 is approximately 69,218.

So the total is 70 +3 +0.358 =73.358 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is F:12.48 grams, so something's wrong here because 73g isn't an option. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake in calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Q, the charge.

Wait, current is 4.02 A for 1000 minutes. Let me recalculate Q.

1000 minutes = 1000 *60 = 60,000 seconds. So Q = I*t =4.02 A *60,000 s.

4.02 *60,000. Let's compute 4*60,000 = 240,000.

0.02 *60,000 = 1,200.

So total Q = 240,000 +1,200=241,200 C. That seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong formula? Wait, the formula is m = (Q * M) / (n * F).

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the denominator.

Wait, let's try computing it step by step.

Compute Q first: 4.02 A *1000*60 s=4.02 *60,000=241,200 C.

M is molar mass of Ni: 58.69 g/mol.

n is 2 because Ni²+.

F is 96,485 C/mol.

So m = (241200 *58.69) / (2 *96485).

Compute denominator: 2*96485 =192,970.

So m = (241200 *58.69)/192970.

Wait, perhaps I can simplify this calculation by dividing numerator and denominator by some common factor.

Alternatively, let me compute 241200 *58.69 = 14,156,028.

Divide by 192,970.

Wait, perhaps I can do this division more accurately.

Let me see: 192,970 * 73 = ?

Compute 192,970 *70 =13,507,900.

192,970 *3=578,910.

So 70+3=73: 13,507,900 +578,910=14,086,810.

Now, our numerator is 14,156,028.

Subtract 14,086,810 from 14,156,028: that gives 69,218.

So 73 + (69,218 /192,970).

69,218 /192,970 ≈ 0.358.

So m≈73.358 grams.

But that's way higher than any of the options given. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, wait a second. Did I forget to account for something like the stoichiometry correctly?

Wait, the formula is m = (Q * M) / (n * F). Let me check that again.

Yes, the formula is correct. Q is in coulombs, M in g/mol, n is valence, F in C/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass of Ni? Let me check that. Oh, wait, Nickel's atomic weight is about 58.69 g/mol, so that's correct.

Wait, is the current 4.02 A? Yes. Time is 1000 minutes, which is 60,000 seconds. So Q is correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the division. Let me try another approach.

Compute 14,156,028 ÷ 192,970.

Let me see: 192,970 × 73 = 14,086,810.

As before, subtracting this from numerator:14,156,028 -14,086,810 =69,218.

So 69,218 /192,970 ≈ 0.358.

So m≈73.358 grams.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, wait a second. Oh! Wait, maybe I used the wrong number of electrons. For Ni²+, each ion gains 2 electrons. So n is 2, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the molar mass of NiSO4 or another compound. But no, because the formula uses the molar mass of the metal being deposited, which is Ni.

Wait, perhaps the current is applied for 1000 seconds, not 1000 minutes. Oh wait, the question says 1000 minutes, so no, that's correct.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of Q.

4.02 A *1000 min =4.02 *1000*60=4.02*60,000=241,200 C. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The formula is m = (I × t × M) / (n × F). Because Q=I×t.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers as (I*t*M)/(n*F).

So m = (4.02 A * 60,000 s *58.69 g/mol) / (2 *96485 C/mol).

Compute numerator:4.02 *60,000=241,200. 241,200 *58.69 =14,156,028. So 14,156,028 g·C/mol.

Denominator:2 *96485=192,970 C/mol.

So m=14,156,028 /192,970 ≈73.358 grams.

Still getting 73 grams, but the options don't have this. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the given current is in milliAmperes? But the question says 4.02 amperes, not mA. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the time is 1000 seconds, not minutes. But the question says 1000 minutes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me check: Ni is 58.69 g/mol. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the anode, but no, it's the cathode. Nickel is being deposited at the cathode, so it's correct.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I miscalculated the division. Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute 14,156,028 divided by 192,970.

192,970 × 70 =13,507,900.

Subtracting from 14,156,028 gives 648,128.

Now, 192,970 ×3 =578,910.

Subtracting from 648,128 gives 69,218.

Now, 192,970 ×0.358 ≈69,218.

So 70 +3 +0.358 =73.358 grams.

But the options are all under 13 grams. So I'm way off. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another way to write the formula is using the relationship moles = Q/(nF).

So moles of Ni²+ deposited would be Q/(nF).

Molar mass is 58.69 g/mol.

So moles = 241200 C / (2 *96485 C/mol) = 241200 /192970 ≈1.25 moles.

Wait, 241200 /192970: let me compute that. 192970 ×1.25 =241,212.5. Which is very close to 241,200. So approximately 1.25 mol.

Then, mass is moles * molar mass: 1.25 *58.69 ≈73.36 grams.

Again, same result. But no option matches. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation with precise numbers.

Let me compute 4.02 *60,000 = 241,200 C.

Molar mass of Ni is 58.69 g/mol.

n=2.

F=96485.

So m = (241200 *58.69) / (2 *96485).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 241200 *58.69.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 241200 / (2*96485) first, then multiply by 58.69.

Because 241200/(2*96485) =241200/(192970) ≈1.25.

Then 1.25 *58.69 =73.36 grams.

Wait, but this is the same result as before. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, which can't be the case because the question expects one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass of Ni. Let me check that. Wait, Nickel's atomic weight is approximately 58.69 g/mol, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the current is 4.02 milliamperes? Then that would be 0.00402 A, which would change everything. But the question says 4.02 amperes.

Wait, perhaps the time is 1000 seconds instead of minutes. If it's 1000 seconds, then Q=4.02 *1000=4020 C.

Let me compute that scenario.

Q=4020 C.

m=(4020 *58.69)/(2*96485).

Compute 4020 *58.69.

Hmm, 4000*58.69=234,760.

20*58.69=1,173.8.

Total=234,760 +1,173.8=235,933.8.

Divide by (2*96485)=192,970.

So 235,933.8 /192,970 ≈1.222 moles.

Wait, 192970 *1.2=231,564. 235,933.8-231,564=4,369.8.

192970 *0.0227 ≈4,369.8 (since 192970 *0.02=3,859.4; 0.0027*192970≈521. So 3,859.4 +521=4,380.4. Close enough.)

So total is 1.222 moles. Then mass is 1.222 *58.69 ≈71.7 g. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the time. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "a current of 4.02 amperes flowing for 1000 minutes?" Yes.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source. Oh wait, another formula I've seen is:

mass = (I * t * M) / (n * F)

Wait, that's what I did. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the current in a different way, like only 3 electrons per ion? No, Ni²+ would require 2 electrons.

Wait, let me think about the possible answers given. Let's see the options: A is about 7g, B 11, C 5.2, etc. None near 73g. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the time. Wait, 1000 minutes is 1000 *60=60,000 seconds.
