Question:

After the murder of his brother, a man published the following notice in the local newspaper:"REWARDAny person who supplies information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of my brother will be paid $10,000. "An amateur detective, without knowledge of the reward notice, began investigating the matter as a result of his own curiosity kindled by the sensationalism surrounding the brother's murder. One week later, the detective secured information that led to the arrest and later conviction of the murderer. During the murder trial, the detective found out about the reward and demanded the $10,000 from the man. In an action by the detective to recover the $10,000 reward, he will

Options:

A: succeed, because his actions led to the arrest and conviction of the murderer.
B: not succeed, because he did not accept the offer before fulfilling the conditions.
C: not succeed, because he did not have knowledge of the reward.
D: not succeed, because the reward offer was not communicated to him directly.
E: succeed, because the reward notice was a unilateral contract.
F: succeed, because he was unaware of the offer.
G: succeed, because his apprehension of the murderer created a contract implied in law.
H: not succeed, because he was not officially hired to investigate the case.
I: not succeed, because his investigation was not a bargained-for exchange.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically regarding rewards and unilateral contracts. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The scenario is that a man's brother was murdered, and he published a reward notice offering $10,000 to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer. Then there's this amateur detective who didn't know about the reward. He started investigating because he was curious, probably because the case was sensational. A week later, he found the info that led to the arrest and conviction. But during the trial, he found out about the reward and now wants the $10,000.

The question is whether the detective can successfully claim the reward.

I remember that reward notices are typically considered unilateral contracts. In a unilateral contract, one party makes an offer that can only be accepted by performing the action specified, not just by promising to do it. So the offer is open until someone performs the required act.

The key points here are that the detective didn't know about the reward when he started investigating. He did the work out of curiosity. But he did end up supplying the information that led to the conviction.

Wait, so in unilateral contracts, the offeror (the man) is bound as soon as the offeree (detective) starts performing the requested action, even if the offeree didn't know about the offer. Because once the action is completed, the contract is formed, and the offeror must pay.

But wait, in some cases, it's required that the action was done in reliance on the offer. Like, if someone didn't know about the reward but did the action, can they still claim it? I think the general rule is that for a unilateral contract, the performance is enough, regardless of knowledge. Because the offer is to the world at large, and anyone who fulfills it can claim the reward.

So when the detective found the information and caused the arrest and conviction, he fulfilled the condition of the reward. Even though he didn't know about it when he started, his performance completed the contract. So the man is obligated to pay.

Looking at the options:

A: Succeed because his actions led to arrest and conviction. This seems correct under unilateral contract.

B: Not succeed because he didn't accept before fulfilling. But in unilateral, you don't need to communicate acceptance beforehand; performance is acceptance.

C: Not succeed because he didn't have knowledge. But I think knowledge isn't required as the offer is to anyone.

D: Not succeed because offer wasn't communicated directly. But reward notices are usually published, so that's fine.

E: Succeed because it's a unilateral contract. This seems correct.

F: Succeed because unaware of the offer. But the reasoning here would align with E.

G: Succeed because contract implied in law. Not sure, but contracts implied in law (quasi-contracts) are more about restitution when there's no actual contract. Maybe not applicable here.

H: Not succeed because not hired. The reward doesn't require being hired; it's about the action.

I: Not succeed because no bargained-for exchange. But in unilateral contracts, the performance is the bargained-for action.

Wait, but some might argue that without knowledge, there's no bargained-for exchange. But I think in unilateral contracts, the requirement is the performance, regardless of knowledge. Because the offer is to the world, and the offeree's knowledge isn't necessary as long as they perform.

So the correct answer would be E: succeed because the reward notice was a unilateral contract.

Alternatively, let me think again. Some cases require that the person knew about the reward, or at least that their action was motivated by it. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, the traditional view is that in a unilateral contract, the offer is open, and the performance alone is sufficient. So the detective's actions meet the condition, regardless of his knowledge.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.

In this scenario, the reward notice published by the man is a classic example of a unilateral contract. A unilateral contract is one where the offer can only be accepted by performing a specific action, and the offeror is bound once the offeree performs that action. Importantly, in such cases, the offeree does not need to have knowledge of the offer or formally accept it beforehand. The performance of the requested action itself constitutes acceptance of the offer.

The amateur detective fulfilled the condition of the reward by supplying information that led to the arrest and conviction of the murderer. The fact that he was unaware of the reward at the time of his investigation does not negate his entitlement to the reward. This is because the offer was made to the public at large, and the detective's performance of the required action is sufficient to establish a contractual obligation for the man to pay the reward.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** and **E** correctly identify that the detective is entitled to the reward because the reward notice constitutes a unilateral contract, and the detective performed the required action.
- **B**, **C**, **D**, and **I** are incorrect because they impose additional requirements (such as prior acceptance, knowledge of the offer, direct communication, or a bargained-for exchange) that are not necessary in a unilateral contract.
- **F** and **G** are also incorrect because the detective's lack of knowledge does not affect his entitlement, and the situation does not involve a contract implied in law.
- **H** is incorrect because the detective does not need to be officially hired to investigate in order to claim the reward.

The correct answer is **E**, as it accurately reflects the principles of a unilateral contract and the detective's entitlement to the reward based on his performance.
