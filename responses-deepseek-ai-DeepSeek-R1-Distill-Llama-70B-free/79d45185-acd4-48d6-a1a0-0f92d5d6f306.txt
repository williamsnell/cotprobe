Okay, so I've got this question about patent law and civil procedure. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a patent holder suing a licensee in federal court for infringement. The patent holder wants a jury trial because they think a jury would be more sympathetic. The lawyer needs to know how to secure that right. 

I remember that in federal court, the right to a jury trial is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 38. So let me think about what that rule says. 

Rule 38(b) states that any party may demand a jury trial by serving the other parties with a written demand no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. And if you don't do it then, the right is waived unless the court orders otherwise. 

Wait, but when does the last pleading happen? The pleadings typically include the complaint and any answers or counterclaims. So the last pleading would be when all the parties have filed their initial pleadings. 

Wait, the initial pleadings close when the answer is filed, right? So the "close of the pleadings" is when the last pleading is served. So the time limit for demanding a jury trial is tied to that event. 

So looking at the options, option A says to file and serve within 60 days after the close of the pleadings. Option B is 30 days. Option H says 14 days after the complaint was served. Hmm. 

Wait, wait. Rule 38(b) says the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading is served. So if the last pleading is the answer, then the plaintiff has to make the demand within 14 days after that. Or if the defendant files a counterclaim, then the plaintiff might have to respond, and the time could be after that. 

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The time starts when the last pleading is served. So if the initial complaint is filed, the defendant files an answer, which is the last pleading. Then the plaintiff has 14 days from when the answer is served to demand a jury trial. 

Alternatively, if the defendant files a counterclaim, which is part of the pleadings, then the plaintiff would have 14 days after that to demand a jury. 

So the correct time is 14 days after the close of the pleadings. But looking at the options, do any match that? 

Wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 60 days, B is 30, H is 14 days after the complaint was served. That's different. Because the complaint is the first pleading, not the last. 

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the initial step. So the complaint is the first pleading. The defendant files an answer, which is the next pleading. So the last pleading is the answer. So the 14 days would start from when the answer is served. 

So the correct option would be to file within 14 days after the close of the pleadings, which is after the answer or any other pleading is served. 

Looking at the options, none of them directly state 14 days after the close of the pleadings. Let me check again. 

Option H says within 14 days after the complaint was served. That's not right because the complaint is the first pleading. The close of the pleadings is after the answer, so it's not the complaint. 

Option B is 30 days after the close. No, because the rule is 14 days. 

Wait, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me think again. Rule 38(b) says that any party may demand a jury trial by serving a demand "within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served." So it's 14 days after the last pleading. 

So the correct answer should be that the lawyer files and serves a jury trial demand within 14 days after the close of the pleadings. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me look again. 

Wait, the options are A through H. Option A is 60 days, B is 30, H is 14 days after the complaint. So none of them exactly match. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the initial complaint includes a jury demand. So when the plaintiff files the complaint, they can include a jury trial demand in it. So if the complaint includes the demand, then the plaintiff has already secured the right. But in the question, the patent holder is bringing the action, so the lawyer would file the complaint. 

Wait, let me think about when the demand is made. The plaintiff can demand a jury trial in the complaint. So if the complaint includes a jury demand, then that's sufficient, right? Because the complaint is the initial pleading. But the defendant may later file an answer, which is another pleading. 

Wait, but according to Rule 38, the demand must be made no later than 14 days after the last pleading. So if the plaintiff includes the demand in the complaint, then that's done before the defendant's answer. So that should be acceptable. 

Alternatively, if the plaintiff doesn't include the demand in the complaint, then they have to make the demand within 14 days after the answer is served. 

But in the question, the lawyer needs to secure the right. So the safest way is to include the demand in the complaint. So the lawyer files the complaint with a jury demand. 

Looking at the options again, option G says "File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand." That seems correct because it's done at the time of filing, before the close of the pleadings. 

Wait, but wait. If the complaint includes the demand, then the plaintiff has done it timely because the complaint is the initial pleading. The defendant's answer is the next pleading, so the plaintiff's demand in the complaint is before the close of the pleadings. 

So in that case, the correct answer would be G. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the 14-day period starts after the last pleading. 

Alternatively, perhaps the demand can be made any time up until 14 days after the last pleading. So if the plaintiff includes it in the complaint, that's fine. But if they don't, they have 14 days after the answer to do it. 

So in the question, the patent holder is the plaintiff, so the lawyer is filing the complaint. To secure the right, the lawyer can include the demand in the complaint, which is option G. 

Alternatively, if the lawyer misses that, they have to do it within 14 days after the answer is served. But the question is about what the lawyer should do to secure the right. So the proactive approach is to include it in the complaint. 

Therefore, the correct answer is G: File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand. 

Wait, but another thought: when you file the complaint, you can include a jury demand. So that would satisfy the requirement because it's done before the close of the pleadings. So the lawyer doesn't have to wait until after the answer is filed. 

Alternatively, the lawyer could wait and file a separate demand within 14 days after the answer is served. So that's another option. 

But looking at the options, G is about including it in the complaint, which is one way to do it. Another option is H, which is 14 days after the complaint was served, but that's not the same as after the close of the pleadings. 

Wait, the complaint is served on the defendant, and then the defendant files an answer. So the close of the pleadings is after the answer is filed. So perhaps option H is incorrect because it's 14 days after the complaint, not after the answer. 

So going back, the correct time is 14 days after the close of the pleadings. So if the lawyer files a separate demand within that time, that's option A, B, or H? Wait, let me check the options again. 

Options A is 60 days after close, B is 30 days, H is 14 days after the complaint. None of the options exactly say 14 days after the close. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that can't be, so I must have made a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the initial service. Let me think again. The complaint is the first pleading. The answer is the next. So the close of the pleadings is when the answer is served. So the 14-day period starts then. 

So the correct way is to file a demand within 14 days after the close of the pleadings. Looking at the options, none of the options directly state that. So perhaps the correct answer is H, but that's 14 days after the complaint was served. That would be too early because the answer hasn't been filed yet. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, which is 30 days. No, because the rule says 14 days. 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the time limits. Let me double-check the Federal Rules. 

Rule 38(b): "Any party may demand a jury trial by... serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served, or if no pleading is served or if the pleading has been filed, within 14 days after service of the last pleading."

So, the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading (like the answer or any counterclaim) is served. 

So if the plaintiff files the complaint and doesn't include a demand, the defendant files an answer. Then the plaintiff has 14 days from when the answer is served to make the demand. 

Alternatively, the plaintiff can include the demand in the complaint, which is a pleading, so that's timely because it's before the close of the pleadings. 

So the question is, what should the lawyer do? The question says the patent holder asked the lawyer to obtain a jury trial. So the lawyer should make sure the demand is made timely. 

Option G is to include the demand in the complaint. That would be done before the close of the pleadings, which is correct. So that's a valid way. 

Alternatively, the lawyer could wait and file a separate demand within 14 days after the answer is served. But none of the options mention that. 

Looking at the options again, option H says within 14 days after the complaint was served. That doesn't align because the complaint is the first pleading. The close is after the answer. 

So the correct answer must be G: file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand. 

Wait, but another thought: when you serve the complaint, you have to serve it on the defendant. The defendant then has time to answer. So the complaint is served, then the answer is filed, say, 21 days later. Then the 14-day period for the demand would start from when the answer is served. 

But if the plaintiff includes the demand in the complaint, which is served first, then the demand is made before the answer is even filed. So that's definitely timely. 

Therefore, the correct answer is G. 

But wait, another angle: in some cases, if the plaintiff includes a demand in the complaint, and the defendant files an answer that includes a counterclaim, would that affect the demand? Because the last pleading would then be the answer, so the 14 days would start from there. But the plaintiff already demanded in the complaint, so they're fine. 

So in any case, including the demand in the complaint is a valid way to secure the jury trial. 

So the correct answer is G.

To secure the patent holder's right to a jury trial, the lawyer must comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38, which governs jury trial demands. Under Rule 38(b), a party may demand a jury trial by serving a written demand no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. The "close of the pleadings" occurs when the last pleading, such as an answer or counterclaim, is served. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (60 days after the close of the pleadings):** Incorrect, as the demand must be made within 14 days, not 60.
- **Option B (30 days after the close of the pleadings):** Incorrect, as the demand must be made within 14 days, not 30.
- **Option C (File and serve a jury trial demand at the initial court hearing):** Incorrect, as there is no such requirement in Rule 38.
- **Option D (File and serve a complaint that excludes a jury trial demand):** Incorrect, as excluding the demand would not secure the right to a jury trial.
- **Option E (Make a verbal request for a jury trial during the first court hearing):** Incorrect, as a verbal request is insufficient; a written demand is required.
- **Option F (Make a jury trial demand at the initial pretrial conference):** Incorrect, as the demand must be made within 14 days after the close of the pleadings, not at the pretrial conference.
- **Option G (File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand):** Correct. Including the demand in the complaint is a valid and timely way to secure the right to a jury trial, as it is made before the close of the pleadings.
- **Option H (File and serve a jury trial demand within 14 days after the complaint was served):** Incorrect, as the 14-day period begins after the close of the pleadings (e.g., after the answer is served), not after the complaint is served.

The safest and most proactive approach is to include the jury trial demand in the complaint, as this ensures the right is secured before the close of the pleadings. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G**

Answer: G
