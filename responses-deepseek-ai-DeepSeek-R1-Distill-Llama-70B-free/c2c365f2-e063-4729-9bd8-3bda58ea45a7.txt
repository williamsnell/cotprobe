Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking me to translate the English sentence "Some animals are neglected by cruel people" into predicate logic. The options are from A to J, but I think J isn't here, so probably up to I or something. Anyway, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the sentence structure. "Some animals are neglected by cruel people." So, the subject is animals, and they are being acted upon by cruel people. The verb is "are neglected," which is in passive voice. So the structure is: Some animals (exist) such that they are neglected by some cruel people.

The predicates given are:
- Ax: x is an animal
- Cx: x is cruel
- Px: x is a person
- Nxy: x neglects y

Wait, so Nxy is x neglects y. So in the sentence, the animals are being neglected, which means y would be the animal, and x would be the person doing the neglecting.

So the sentence can be rephrased as: There exists an animal y, and there exists a person x who is cruel, such that x neglects y.

Putting that into logic, it would be something like: There exists y (animal) and exists x (cruel person) such that Nxy. But wait, the original sentence says "some animals," so it's more like there exists at least one animal that is neglected by some cruel person.

Wait, but the original sentence is in passive voice, so "animals are neglected by cruel people." So it's like, for some animal y, there exists a cruel person x who neglects y.

So the structure would be: ∃y (Ay ∧ ∃x (Cx ∧ Px ∧ Nxy)).

Wait, but the options don't seem to have two existentials. Wait, let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (exists x)[(C x • P x) • (exists y)(A y • N y x)]
Hmm, so x is a cruel person, and y is an animal, and x neglects y. Wait, but Nxy is x neglects y. So in this case, Nyx would be y neglecting x? Wait no, wait, Nyx is x neglects y? Wait, no, Nxy means x neglects y. So Nyx would mean y neglects x. Oh wait no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, Nxy is x neglects y. So Nyx would be y neglects x. So in option A, the inner part is N y x, which would mean y neglects x. But that's not what we want. We want x (the person) neglecting y (the animal). So A's inner part is wrong.

Option B: (exists x)[(P x • A x) • (exists y)(C y • N y x)]
Wait, x is a person and an animal? That doesn't make sense. Because Px is x is a person, and Ax is x is an animal. So x can't be both. Unless the person is an animal, but that's not the case here. So B is wrong because it's saying x is both a person and an animal, which is impossible.

Option C: (exists x)[(A x • C x) • (exists y)(P y • N y x)]
Again, x is both an animal and cruel. But Cx is x is cruel, which applies to people. So if x is an animal, it can't be a person. So C is wrong.

Option D: (exists x)[(C x • P x) • (exists y)(A y • N x y)]
So x is a cruel person, and y is an animal. Then Nxy is x neglects y. That fits. So D says, there exists an x who is a cruel person, and there exists a y who is an animal, and x neglects y. So that seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option E: (exists x)[(A x • P x) • (exists y)(C y • N y x)]
Again, x is both animal and person. Impossible. So E is wrong.

Option F: (exists x)[(P x • C x) • (exists y)(A y • N y x)]
So x is a cruel person, y is an animal, and Nyx is y neglects x. But we need x neglects y, so Nxy. So F is wrong because it's Nyx.

Option G: (exists x)(exists y){[(A x • P x) • C y] • N x y}
Wait, x is both animal and person again, which is impossible. So G is wrong.

Option H: (exists x)[(A x • P x) • (exists y)(C y • N y x)]
Same as E and G, x can't be both animal and person. So H is wrong.

Option I: (exists x)(exists y){[(A x • C y) • P y] • N x y}
Wait, x is an animal, y is a cruel person, and Nxy is x neglects y. But that would mean the animal neglects the person, which is the opposite of what we want. We want the person to neglect the animal. So I is wrong.

So the correct one is D. Because D says there's a cruel person x, and an animal y, and x neglects y. Which matches the original sentence.

Wait, but let me think again. The original sentence is "Some animals are neglected by cruel people." So it's saying that for some animals, there exists a cruel person who neglects them. So the structure is: ∃y (Ay ∧ ∃x (Cx ∧ Px ∧ Nxy)).

Looking at option D: (exists x)[(C x • P x) • (exists y)(A y • N x y)]
Yes, that's exactly it. Because D first states that x is a cruel person, and then there exists a y which is an animal, and x neglects y.

So the answer should be D.

The question asks to translate the sentence "Some animals are neglected by cruel people" into predicate logic. The predicates provided are:

- \( A_x \): \( x \) is an animal  
- \( C_x \): \( x \) is cruel  
- \( P_x \): \( x \) is a person  
- \( N_{xy} \): \( x \) neglects \( y \)  

The sentence can be rephrased as: "There exists an animal \( y \) such that there exists a cruel person \( x \) who neglects \( y \)." In logical terms, this is expressed as:  
\[
\exists y (A_y \land \exists x (C_x \land P_x \land N_{xy}))
\]  

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( (\exists x)[(C_x \cdot P_x) \cdot (\exists y)(A_y \cdot N_{yx})] \)  
  Here, \( N_{yx} \) means \( y \) neglects \( x \), which is the opposite of what is needed. Incorrect.

- **Option B**: \( (\exists x)[(P_x \cdot A_x) \cdot (\exists y)(C_y \cdot N_{yx})] \)  
  \( x \) cannot be both a person (\( P_x \)) and an animal (\( A_x \)). Incorrect.

- **Option C**: \( (\exists x)[(A_x \cdot C_x) \cdot (\exists y)(P_y \cdot N_{yx})] \)  
  \( x \) cannot be both an animal (\( A_x \)) and cruel (\( C_x \)), as cruelty applies to people. Incorrect.

- **Option D**: \( (\exists x)[(C_x \cdot P_x) \cdot (\exists y)(A_y \cdot N_{xy})] \)  
  This correctly states that there exists a cruel person \( x \) and an animal \( y \) such that \( x \) neglects \( y \). Correct.

- **Option E**: \( (\exists x)[(A_x \cdot P_x) \cdot (\exists y)(C_y \cdot N_{yx})] \)  
  \( x \) cannot be both an animal (\( A_x \)) and a person (\( P_x \)). Incorrect.

- **Option F**: \( (\exists x)[(P_x \cdot C_x) \cdot (\exists y)(A_y \cdot N_{yx})] \)  
  \( N_{yx} \) means \( y \) neglects \( x \), which is the opposite of what is needed. Incorrect.

- **Option G**: \( (\exists x)(\exists y)\{[(A_x \cdot P_x) \cdot C_y] \cdot N_{xy}\} \)  
  \( x \) cannot be both an animal (\( A_x \)) and a person (\( P_x \)). Incorrect.

- **Option H**: \( (\exists x)[(A_x \cdot P_x) \cdot (\exists y)(C_y \cdot N_{yx})] \)  
  \( x \) cannot be both an animal (\( A_x \)) and a person (\( P_x \)). Incorrect.

- **Option I**: \( (\exists x)(\exists y)\{[(A_x \cdot C_y) \cdot P_y] \cdot N_{xy}\} \)  
  This suggests the animal neglects the person, which is the opposite of the intended meaning. Incorrect.

The correct translation is **Option D**, as it accurately captures the meaning of the sentence in predicate logic.  

**Answer: D**
