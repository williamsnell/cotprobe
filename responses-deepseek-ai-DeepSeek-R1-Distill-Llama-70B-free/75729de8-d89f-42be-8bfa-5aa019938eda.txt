Okay, so I've got this question about brain damage and its effects. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says that Mr. Gordon damaged the back of his right frontal lobe. I remember that the frontal lobe is involved in various functions like motor skills, planning, and language. But wait, the back part is more specific. Oh right, the frontal lobe is divided into different areas. The prefrontal cortex is more about decision-making, while the motor cortex is at the back.

Wait, the motor cortex is in the frontal lobe, specifically the precentral gyrus. The motor cortex controls voluntary movements. And each part of the motor cortex corresponds to different parts of the body. Also, I remember that the motor cortex is contralateral, meaning the right side controls the left side of the body and vice versa.

So if the damage is to the back of the right frontal lobe, that would affect the motor cortex on the right. So the left side of the body would be impacted. Looking at the options, which one relates to movement on the left side?

Option B says "move his left hand." That makes sense because damage to the right motor cortex would impair movement in the left limbs. The other options: A is face recognition, which is more related to the temporal lobe (like the fusiform gyrus) or maybe the occipital lobe. C is hearing, which is temporal lobe. D is understanding reading, which could be related to Wernicke's area, also temporal. E is speaking, which is Broca's area in the frontal lobe but more the left side, I think. F, taste, is related to the insula. G is understanding speech again, so that's the same as D. H is vision, so occipital lobe. I is feeling temperature, which is the parietal lobe. J is smell, which is olfactory bulb and maybe the limbic system.

Wait, but Broca's area is in the frontal lobe, right? But Broca's is about speech production. So if the damage was to the left frontal lobe, that would cause speech issues. But in this question, the damage is to the right, so speech production might not be affected. So E is probably not the right answer.

So the question is about inability to move the left hand. So the correct answer should be B.

The question involves damage to the back of the right frontal lobe, which is associated with the motor cortex. The motor cortex controls voluntary movements and operates contralateral, meaning the right side controls the left side of the body. Therefore, damage to this area would impair movement in the left hand. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Face recognition is linked to the temporal or occipital lobe, not the frontal lobe.
- **B**: Moving the left hand is directly related to the motor cortex in the right frontal lobe.
- **C**: Hearing is managed by the temporal lobe.
- **D**: Understanding written information involves areas like Wernicke's, located in the temporal lobe.
- **E**: Speaking intelligibly relates to Broca's area, which is typically in the left frontal lobe.
- **F**: Taste involves the insula.
- **G**: Understanding speech is associated with the temporal lobe.
- **H**: Vision is managed by the occipital lobe.
- **I**: Feeling temperature involves the parietal lobe.
- **J**: Smell is related to the olfactory system.

The correct answer is **B**, as damage to the motor cortex in the right frontal lobe would specifically affect movement of the left hand.

Answer: B
