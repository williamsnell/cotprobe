Okay, so I've got this question about how the United States took possession of the Oregon Territory. I'm a bit fuzzy on my history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Oregon Territory was a region that both the US and Britain claimed for a while. There was something about the boundary dispute between them. I think it was a joint occupation for some time. But how did the US finally get it?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Annexation after a revolt by settlers. That sounds a bit like Texas, which had a revolt against Mexico. But Oregon wasn't a Mexican territory, so maybe not.

Option B: Bought from Native Americans. I don't think so. The US usually took land through treaties with European powers or by displacement of Native Americans, not buying directly from them as a group.

Option C: Divided after a vote. Hmm, I think the Oregon Territory was split between the US and Canada. Oh wait, the Oregon Treaty of 1846. The 54-40 or fight slogan was about this. So the treaty divided the territory at the 49th parallel. So maybe C is about the division, but the question is about how the US took possession. So the treaty was negotiated.

Option D: Settlers arrived first. I don't think that's accurate. There were settlers, but the region was claimed by both the US and Britain, and it wasn't just about who got there first.

Option E: Claimed after discovery. Like explorers? Maybe, but the US had explorers there, but it was already inhabited by Native Americans and the British had claims too.

Option F: Won from Mexico in a war. That's California and parts south, like the Mexican-American War. Oregon was north, so probably not.

Option G: Inherited from Spain via Louisiana Purchase. The Louisiana Purchase was from France, and it included the Midwest, not the Pacific Northwest. Spain had Florida and other areas but not Oregon.

Option H: Britain ceded via treaty. That sounds right. The Oregon Treaty was between the US and Britain, where they agreed on the border, so the US got the territory south of the 49th parallel.

Option I: Granted by France. No, France had sold land in the Louisiana Purchase, but Oregon was British and Spanish before.

Option J: Gift from Russia. Russia had Alaska, and I think they sold that to the US later, but Oregon was separate.

So putting it together, the US and Britain had a dispute, and they negotiated a treaty where Britain ceded the land to the US. So the answer is H.

The Oregon Territory was acquired by the United States through a negotiated treaty with Great Britain, known as the Oregon Treaty of 1846. This treaty resolved the border dispute by establishing the 49th parallel as the boundary between U.S. and British territories. 

Answer: H
