Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

The problem has three parts: (a) calculating ΔH at 298 K for a reaction, (b) finding ΔH at 398 K for another reaction, and (c) finding ΔE at 298 K for the first reaction. Let's focus on part (a) first.

The reaction given in part (a) is C₂H₆(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₅Cl(g) + HCl(g). I need to calculate ΔH_298°K for this.

I remember that ΔH for a reaction can be calculated using the heats of formation of the products and reactants. The formula is ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants). 

So, looking at the data provided:

- The heat of combustion of C₂H₆ is given as -341 kcal/mol. Wait, but wait. The heat of combustion is the heat released when a substance burns completely in oxygen to CO₂ and H₂O. So, the ΔH for that combustion reaction is -341 kcal per mole of C₂H₆. But how does that relate to the heat of formation?

Oh right, the heat of formation is the heat change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for C₂H₆, the formation reaction is 2C(s) + 3H₂(g) → C₂H₆(g). The ΔHf° for C₂H₆ would be the negative of the heat of combustion because the combustion is the reverse (C₂H₆ burning to CO₂ and H₂O, which are stable). Wait, no, that's not the case. Let me think again.

Wait, the heat of combustion (ΔcH°) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is burned to form CO₂ and H₂O. So the formula is: C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O. The ΔH for this combustion is given as -341 kcal/mol.

So the heat of formation of C₂H₆ (ΔHf°) can be found from the combustion data. Let's construct the combustion reaction:

C₂H₆(g) + (7/2) O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g) + 3 H₂O(g)

The ΔH° for this is -341 kcal. 

Using Hess's Law, the ΔHf° of C₂H₆ can be calculated. The standard heats of formation for CO₂ and H₂O are known. The given data is: H₂O(g) has ΔHf° = -57.8 kcal/mol, and HCl(g) has ΔHf° = -2.1 kcal/mol. Wait, but what about CO₂? Oh, I think the problem didn't give it, but perhaps it's assumed to be a known value. Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the problem gives the heat of formation for H₂O and HCl but not for the others. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps part (a) can be approached using the given data without needing to compute the ΔHf for C₂H₆.

Wait, let's see what else is given. The first reaction's ΔH is -1229.6 kcal. That reaction is 4 C₂H₅Cl(g) + 13 O₂ → 2 Cl₂ + 8 CO₂ + 10 H₂O. So for this reaction, the ΔH is given as -1229.6 kcal.

But how does that help with part (a)? Hmm. Maybe I can find the ΔHf of C₂H₅Cl and then use that in part (a).

Wait, part (a) is a reaction where C₂H₆ and Cl₂ form C₂H₅Cl and HCl. So the ΔH for this reaction would be [ΔHf(C₂H₅Cl) + ΔHf(HCl)] - [ΔHf(C₂H₆) + ΔHf(Cl₂)].

But wait, Cl₂ is an element in its standard state, so its ΔHf is zero. So the equation simplifies to:

ΔH = [ΔHf(C₂H₅Cl) + ΔHf(HCl)] - [ΔHf(C₂H₆) + 0]

So I need the ΔHf for C₂H₅Cl, C₂H₆, and HCl. We have HCl's ΔHf as -2.1 kcal/mol. But what about the others?

I think I can find ΔHf for C₂H₅Cl using the first reaction. Let's see.

The first reaction is 4 C₂H₅Cl +13 O₂ → 2 Cl₂ + 8 CO₂ +10 H₂O. The ΔH is -1229.6 kcal. So the products are Cl₂, CO₂, H₂O. Let's compute the ΔH for this reaction using the ΔHf of the products and reactants.

The reaction's ΔH would be the sum of ΔHf of products minus sum of reactants.

Wait, but the reactants here are C₂H₅Cl and O₂. O₂ has ΔHf 0. So,

ΔH = [2*(ΔHf Cl₂) + 8*(ΔHf CO₂) + 10*(ΔHf H₂O)] - [4*(ΔHf C₂H₅Cl) + 13*(ΔHf O₂)]

But ΔHf of O₂ is zero, and Cl₂ is also an element, so ΔHf Cl₂ is zero. So,

ΔH = [0 + 8*(ΔHf CO₂) + 10*(-57.8)] - [4*(ΔHf C₂H₅Cl) + 0]

We know ΔH is -1229.6 kcal. 

Wait, but I don't know ΔHf CO₂. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects us to take it as a known value. I remember that ΔHf CO₂(g) is around -94.0 kcal/mol, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that we can calculate it from the combustion data provided.

Wait, the combustion of C₂H₆ gives 2 CO₂ and 3 H₂O, and the ΔH is -341 kcal. So let's write that reaction:

C₂H₆ + (7/2) O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 3 H₂O(g); ΔH = -341 kcal.

Using the ΔHf values, the equation becomes:

ΔH_combustion = [2*(ΔHf CO₂) + 3*(ΔHf H₂O)] - [ΔHf C₂H₆ + (7/2)*0]

So,

-341 = [2*(ΔHf CO₂) + 3*(-57.8)] - [ΔHf C₂H₆]

But wait, I don't know ΔHf C₂H₆. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find ΔHf CO₂ from this equation if I can find ΔHf C₂H₆. But that seems circular.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of knowns and unknowns. Let me define variables:

Let’s let a = ΔHf C₂H₆, b = ΔHf CO₂, c = ΔHf C₂H5Cl.

We have the following equations:

From the combustion reaction:

-341 = 2b + 3*(-57.8) - a → equation (1)

From the first given reaction:

-1229.6 = [8b + 10*(-57.8)] - 4c → equation (2)

We need another equation for c. Let's think about the reaction in part (a):

C₂H6 + Cl2 → C₂H5Cl + HCl.

The ΔH for this is [c + (-2.1)] - [a + 0] = (c -2.1) - a → equation (3), but ΔH is what we need to find for part (a).

So, the variables are a, b, c. We have two equations from (1) and (2), but equation (3) involves a and c as well. Let me try to solve for a, b, c.

Equation (1):

-341 = 2b + (-173.4) - a → 2b - a = -341 + 173.4 = -167.6 → equation (1a): 2b - a = -167.6

Equation (2):

-1229.6 = 8b + (-578) -4c → 8b -4c = -1229.6 + 578 = -651.6 → 8b -4c = -651.6 → equation (2a): 2b -c = -163. (divided both sides by 4)

Now, equation (1a): 2b -a = -167.6 → equation (1a)
equation (2a): 2b -c = -163 → equation (2a)

I need a third equation. Let's think: what if I consider the formation of C₂H5Cl. The formation reaction would be C₂H6 + Cl2 → C₂H5Cl + HCl, which is the reaction in part (a). Wait, no, the formation reaction is from elements. So perhaps not directly useful.

Wait, perhaps I can find another equation involving a, b, c using another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the heat of formation of C₂H5Cl can be expressed in terms of other values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find ΔHf C₂H5Cl in terms of a and c.

Wait, let me think again. From equation (2a), 2b -c = -163 → c = 2b +163.

From equation (1a), 2b -a = -167.6 → a = 2b +167.6.

Now, substituting a and c in terms of b into equation (3), which is the ΔH for part (a):

ΔH = (c -2.1) - a → substituting c=2b +163 and a=2b +167.6:

ΔH = (2b +163 -2.1) - (2b +167.6) → let's compute:

= [2b +160.9] - 2b -167.6 → the 2b cancels.

= 160.9 -167.6 → = -6.7 kcal.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have -6.7. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let's re-calculate equation (3) substitution.

c = 2b +163.

a = 2b +167.6.

So equation (3): ΔH = c -2.1 -a.

Substituting:

(2b +163) -2.1 - (2b +167.6) → let's compute each term.

2b +163 -2.1 = 2b + 160.9

Then subtract (2b +167.6):

2b +160.9 -2b -167.6 = (2b -2b) + (160.9 -167.6) → 0 + (-6.7) → -6.7 kcal.

Hmm, that can't be right because none of the options for part (a) are that. The options for part (a) are around -98 to -120 kcal. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the equations. Let me double-check equation (2).

Equation (2) is for the first reaction:

4 C₂H5Cl +13 O2 → 2 Cl2 +8 CO2 +10 H2O.

The ΔH is -1229.6 kcal.

Expressed in terms of ΔHf:

ΔH° = [2*(0) +8*(ΔHf CO2) +10*(ΔHf H2O)] - [4*(ΔHf C₂H5Cl) +13*(0)].

So:

-1229.6 = 8b + 10*(-57.8) -4c → 8b -4c = -1229.6 + 578 → 8b -4c = -651.6 → 2b -c = -651.6/4 → 2b -c = -162.9 → equation (2a).

Wait, earlier I said equation (2a) is 2b -c = -163, but it's actually -162.9. Close enough, perhaps I approximated.

So, equation (2a): 2b -c = -162.9 → c = 2b +162.9.

Equation (1a): 2b -a = -167.6 → a = 2b +167.6.

Now equation (3): ΔH = (c -2.1) - a.

Substitute c and a:

c = 2b +162.9 → (2b +162.9) -2.1 = 2b +160.8.

a = 2b +167.6.

So ΔH = [2b +160.8] - [2b +167.6] → 2b-2b +160.8 -167.6 = -6.8 kcal.

Wait, that's still around -6.8 kcal, which doesn't match any of the options. Hmm. I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should use the given combustion data for C₂H6 to find its ΔHf.

Wait, the combustion reaction for C₂H6 is:

C₂H6 + (7/2) O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O(g), ΔH = -341 kcal.

The ΔHf for this reaction can be written as:

ΔH_combustion = [2*(ΔHf CO2) + 3*(ΔHf H2O)] - [ΔHf C₂H6 + (7/2)*0].

So,

-341 = 2b +3*(-57.8) - a.

Which is:

-341 = 2b -173.4 -a → 2b -a = -341 +173.4 → 2b -a = -167.6. That's the same as equation (1a).

But without knowing b (ΔHf CO2), I can't find 'a' (ΔHf C₂H6). So maybe I need to get another equation.

Wait, perhaps I can find ΔHf CO2 from the first reaction. Let's think.

Wait, the first reaction involves C₂H5Cl, which's ΔHf is c. So equation (2a) is c = 2b +162.9.

But without another equation involving b, I can't solve for b. Unless I can find another relationship.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the ΔHf of CO2 is known. Let me take a standard value. From memory, ΔHf CO2(g) is about -94.0 kcal/mol. Let's use that.

So b = -94.0.

Now, equation (1a): 2*(-94) -a = -167.6 → -188 -a = -167.6 → a = -167.6 +188 → a = 20.4 kcal/mol.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the heat of formation of ethane (C₂H6) is known to be negative. Wait, positive 20.4? That doesn't make sense. Ethane is a stable compound; its heat of formation should be negative. So perhaps my assumption about b is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I have the sign wrong. Because when a substance is formed from elements, if it's exothermic, ΔHf is negative. So for CO₂, yes, ΔHf is negative.

Wait, but if I take b as -94, then 2b is -188.

So equation (1a): -188 -a = -167.6 → a = -167.6 +188 → a = 20.4. But that would mean the heat of formation of ethane is positive, which can't be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, let me recheck equation (1a). The combustion reaction is C₂H6 → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O, ΔH = -341.

So, the equation is:

ΔH_combustion = [2*(ΔHf CO₂) + 3*(ΔHf H₂O)] - [ΔHf C₂H6]

Which is:

-341 = 2b + 3*(-57.8) - a → -341 = 2b -173.4 - a.

Rearranged: 2b -a = -341 +173.4 → 2b -a = -167.6.

So if b is -94, then 2*(-94) = -188. So:

-188 -a = -167.6 → -a = -167.6 +188 → -a = 20.4 → a = -20.4 kcal/mol.

Ah! I think I messed up the sign earlier. So a (ΔHf C₂H6) is -20.4 kcal/mol.

Now, equation (2a): c = 2b +162.9.

Since b = -94, 2b = -188. So c = -188 + 162.9 = -25.1 kcal/mol.

So now, for part (a), the reaction is C₂H6 + Cl2 → C₂H5Cl + HCl.

ΔH = [c + (-2.1)] - [a + 0].

So c is -25.1, HCl is -2.1, a is -20.4.

Thus:

ΔH = (-25.1 -2.1) - (-20.4) → (-27.2) +20.4 → -6.8 kcal.

Hmm, that's the same result as before, but the options for part (a) don't have -6.8. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when using the given ΔH of the first reaction. Let me re-examine that.

The first reaction is 4 C₂H5Cl +13O2 → 2Cl2 +8CO2 +10H2O, ΔH = -1229.6 kcal.

ΔH is calculated as sum(products) - sum(
