Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about a van der Waals gas, and I'm supposed to calculate the change in molar internal energy, ΔU_m, for an isothermal expansion of nitrogen gas. Hmm. I remember that internal energy for real gases can be a bit tricky compared to ideal gases, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that the expansion is isothermal, so the temperature is constant at 298 K. The initial volume is 1.00 dm³, and it expands to 24.8 dm³. Wait, those are per mole values? Or is that the total volume? Oh, the question specifies that it's for a molar process, so I'm assuming the volumes are molar volumes, V_m.

I think the key here is to use the van der Waals equation. The problem gives me π_T = a / V_m², where π_T is the internal pressure. Oh right, for a van der Waals gas, the internal pressure is given by that formula. And I remember that for an isothermal process, the change in internal energy can be found using ΔU = nC_vΔT, but since it's isothermal, ΔT is zero, so that would make ΔU zero for an ideal gas. But wait, this is a real gas, so that approach doesn't apply here.

Wait, no, I think I need to use the general formula for internal energy change in a process. For a real gas undergoing an isothermal process, the change in internal energy isn't zero because the gas isn't ideal. So I need to find another way to calculate it.

I recall that for a van der Waals gas, the internal energy change can be calculated using the equation:

ΔU = n [ (π_T)(V2 - V1) ]

Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Maybe I should think in terms of integrating the internal pressure over volume. Since internal energy is a state function, the path doesn't matter, but for a process like expansion, I might need to use work done or internal pressure.

Wait, I think the formula for ΔU for an isothermal process in a van der Waals gas is given by ΔU = n * a * (1/V1 - 1/V2). Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

The van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT. But since we're dealing with molar quantities, perhaps it's (P + a/V_m²)(V_m - b) = RT.

Wait, the problem gives π_T = a / V_m². Oh, right! π_T represents the internal pressure, which is equal to a/V_m squared. So the internal pressure is a function of volume.

The formula for the change in internal energy for a process is ΔU = n ∫ (T dP - V dP) or something like that? Wait, maybe I should use the more general approach for internal energy.

I remember that for an isothermal process, the change in internal energy can be found using ΔU = n ∫ (from V1 to V2) [ (∂U/∂V)_T ] dV.

Wait, another approach: for a van der Waals gas, the internal energy change when expanding isothermally can be expressed as ΔU = n a (1/V1 - 1/V2). Because the internal pressure is a/V_m², and integrating that over the volume change would give this result. Let me verify.

Hmm, if we have dU = T dS - P dV. But that's the differential form, and for an isothermal process, T is constant. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here.

Alternatively, considering that for a van der Waals gas, the internal energy change at constant temperature is given by ΔU = n a (1/V1 - 1/V2) / something? Wait, maybe it's related to the work done against the internal pressure.

Wait, another thought. The internal pressure π_T is a/V_m². So the work done by the system during expansion against this internal pressure would be ∫ π_T dV from V1 to V2. Then, since ΔU = q + w, but since it's isothermal, q would be the heat absorbed which equals the work done by the system. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think again. For a van der Waals gas, the internal energy change for an isothermal expansion is given by:

ΔU = n * a * (1/V1 - 1/V2) * (something).

Wait, I think the formula is ΔU = n a (1/V1 - 1/V2). Let me see the units. 'a' has units of Pa·m⁶/mol², and V is in m³/mol, so 1/V is 1/m³. So a*(1/V) would be Pa·m³/(mol), which is J/mol. So yeah, the units make sense when multiplied by n, but since we're looking for molar ΔU, n is 1, so it's a*(1/V1 - 1/V2).

Wait, but wait: Let me double-check. The internal pressure π_T is a/V_m². So the work done by the system against the internal pressure during expansion is the integral of π_T dV from V1 to V2.

So W = ∫ (from V1 to V2) π_T dV = ∫ (a/V²) dV from V1 to V2.

So W = a ∫ (1/V²) dV = a [ -1/V ] from V1 to V2 = a (1/V1 - 1/V2).

But wait, work done by the system is positive when expanding, so W would be positive. So the internal energy change would be equal to the work done, because for an isothermal process, the heat q is equal to the work done, but according to the first law, ΔU = q + w. Wait, no, wait: ΔU = q + w, but if the system does work, w is negative because it's work done by the system. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the signs mixed up.

Wait, in thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered negative. So if the system does work, w is negative. So when the system expands, it does positive work on the surroundings, so w would be negative.

But in any case, I think that for an isothermal process, the change in internal energy is given by ΔU = n a (1/V1 - 1/V2), but I'm a bit unsure about the sign.

Wait, the formula I'm recalling is that for an isothermal expansion of a van der Waals gas, the internal energy change is ΔU = n a (1/V1 - 1/V2). So if V2 > V1, then 1/V1 - 1/V2 is positive, so ΔU would be positive, meaning the internal energy increases.

But wait, let me think about the physical meaning. At constant temperature, if the gas expands, it's doing work against the intermolecular attractions, which requires energy. So the internal energy should increase because the molecules are overcoming these attractive forces as they move apart.

So, yes, I think the formula is correct. So now I need to find the value of 'a' for nitrogen gas.

I remember that the van der Waals constants are specific to each gas. For nitrogen, I think 'a' is about 1.352 dm⁶·bar/(mol²) or something like that. Wait, but units are important here. Alternatively, 'a' might be in Pa·m⁶/mol².

Wait, I should probably look up the van der Waals constants for nitrogen. But since I can't do that right now, I'll try to recall. I think for nitrogen, 'a' is approximately 1.352 dm⁶·bar/mol². Let me confirm the units: 1 dm³ is 1 liter, 1 bar is 10^5 Pa, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, alternatively, I think 'a' for nitrogen is 1.352 L²·bar/mol². So, 1.352 (dm³)²·bar/mol².

Wait, but in the problem, the volumes are given in dm³, which is convenient because 'a' is in dm⁶·bar/mol² when using V in dm³. Wait, no, because (dm³) squared would be (dm⁶), so a has units of (dm³)^2 bar / mol², which is dm^6 bar / mol².

But wait, in the calculation, I need to make sure the units are consistent. The problem gives V in dm³, so V1 is 1.00 dm³/mol, V2 is 24.8 dm³/mol.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether the 'a' value I have is in terms of (dm³)^2 bar per mol squared. Let me think again. The van der Waals constant 'a' for nitrogen is 1.352 dm⁶ bar / mol². So when V is in dm³, (V1 and V2 are in dm³/mol), so 1/V1 would be 1/dm³, and multiplying by 'a' which is dm⁶ bar / mol² gives (dm⁶ bar / mol²) * (1/dm³) = dm³ bar / mol². But since bar is 10^5 Pa, and 1 Pa is 1 N/m², so 1 Pa·m³ is 1 N·m, which is 1 Joule.

Wait, so let me think: 'a' is in dm⁶ bar / mol². So:

a has units (dm^3)^2 * bar / mol².

So when I compute a*(1/V1 - 1/V2), each term would be [ (dm^6 bar / mol²) * (1/dm^3) ) ] = dm^3 bar / mol².

But 1 bar is 10^5 Pa, which is 10^5 kg/(m·s²). So 1 dm³ is 0.001 m³. So 1 dm³ bar = 0.001 m³ * 10^5 Pa = 10² N/m² * 0.001 m³ = 10² * 0.001 * N·m = 10² * 0.001 * J = 0.1 J. Wait, no:

Wait, 1 Pa = 1 N/m². So 1 m³·Pa = 1 m³·N/m² = N·m = J.

So 1 dm³·bar = (0.1 m)³ * bar = 0.001 m³ * 1e5 Pa = 0.001 * 1e5 = 10² J.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 1 dm³ is (0.1 m)^3 = 1e-3 m³. 1 bar is 1e5 Pa. So 1 dm³·bar = 1e-3 m³ * 1e5 Pa = 1e2 (100) J.

So, 1 dm³·bar = 100 J.

So, a in dm⁶ bar/mol² multiplied by 1/dm³ gives dm³ bar/mol². And each dm³ bar is 100 J, so a*(1/V1 - 1/V2) would be in (dm³ bar/mol²) * (1/dm³) = bar / mol². Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert 'a' into SI units first.

Wait, let me look up the value of 'a' for nitrogen. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I think it's 1.352 dm^6·bar/mol². Alternatively, in SI units, 'a' for N2 is approximately 1.352e-5 m^6·Pa/mol², because 1 bar is 1e5 Pa, and 1 dm³ is 0.1 m, so 1 dm^6 = (0.1 m)^6 = 1e-6 m^6. So 1 dm⁶ bar = 1e-6 m^6 * 1e5 Pa = 1e-1 m^3·Pa, which is 0.1 J.

So, a in SI units: 1.352 dm⁶·bar/mol² = 1.352 * (1e-6 m^6) * (1e5 Pa) / mol² = 1.352 * 1e-1 J·m³/mol² = 0.1352 J·m³/mol².

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation using the given units.

So, V1 is 1.00 dm³/mol, V2 is 24.8 dm³/mol.

Then, 1/V1 = 1 / 1.00 = 1 dm^{-3}, and 1/V2 = 1 / 24.8 ≈ 0.04032 dm^{-3}.

So, 1/V1 - 1/V2 ≈ 1 - 0.04032 = 0.95968 dm^{-3}.

Now, 'a' is 1.352 dm⁶·bar/mol².

So, a*(1/V1 - 1/V2) = 1.352 dm⁶·bar/mol² * 0.95968 dm^{-3} = 1.352 * 0.95968 bar·dm³/mol².

Wait, bar·dm³ is equal to 100 J as calculated earlier. So 1 bar·dm³ = 100 J.

So, let's compute:

1.352 * 0.95968 ≈ let's compute 1.352 * 0.96 ≈ 1.298.

Wait, more accurately:

0.95968 = approx 0.9597.

1.352 * 0.9597: Let's compute 1 * 0.9597 = 0.9597, 0.3 * 0.9597 ≈ 0.2879, 0.05 * 0.9597 ≈ 0.04798, 0.002 * 0.9597 ≈ 0.00192. Adding up:

0.9597 + 0.2879 = 1.2476; +0.04798 = 1.2956; +0.00192 ≈ 1.2975.

So, approximately 1.2975 bar·dm³/mol².

Then, since 1 bar·dm³ = 100 J, this is 1.2975 * 100 J/mol ≈ 129.75 J/mol.

Wait, that's around 130 J/mol. Looking at the options, option I is 131 J/mol^{-1}, which is very close. But wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another thing: when I computed 1/V1 - 1/V2, I got approximately 0.95968. But let me compute it more accurately.

V1 is 1.00 dm³, so 1/V1 is exactly 1.00.

V2 is 24.8 dm³, so 1/V2 = 1/24.8. Let me compute this more accurately.

24.8 goes into 1: 24.8 * 0.04 = 0.992, which is less than 1. 0.04 *24.8=0.992. So 1/24.8 is 0.04032. So 1 - 0.04032 = 0.95968.

So, a*(1/V1 - 1/V2) = 1.352 * 0.95968 = ?

Let me calculate 1.352 * 0.95968:

1.352 * 0.9 = 1.2168

1.352 * 0.05 = 0.0676

1.352 * 0.00968 ≈ Let's compute 1.352 * 0.01 = 0.01352, so 0.00968 is 0.968% of that, so 0.01352 * 0.968 ≈ approximately 0.01309.

Adding these up: 1.2168 + 0.0676 = 1.2844 + 0.01309 ≈ 1.2975.

So yes, 1.2975 bar·dm³/mol².

Now, converting bar·dm³ to Joules: 1 bar·dm³ = 100 J, so 1.2975 * 100 = 129.75 J/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 131 J/mol⁻¹. But wait, I'm getting 129.75, which is approximately 130. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the 'a' value.

Wait, maybe the 'a' value I used is incorrect. Let me think. I thought 'a' for nitrogen is 1.352 dm⁶·bar/mol², but perhaps it's 1.352 L²·bar/mol²? Since 1 dm³ is 1 L, that's the same as dm³, so it's correct.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the exact value of 'a' is 1.352 dm⁶·bar/mol², which would make the calculation accurate.

So, 1.352 * 0.95968 = 1.352 * (approx 0.9597) = let me compute more accurately:

1.352 × 0.9597:

Break it down:

= (1 + 0.3 + 0.05 + 0.002) × (0.9 + 0.05 + 0.0097)

But maybe a better approach is to compute it digit by digit.

Compute 1.352 × 0.9597:

First, 1 × 0.9597 = 0.9597

0.3 × 0.9597 = 0.28791

0.05 × 0.9597 = 0.047985

0.002 × 0.9597 = 0.0019194

Now, add them up:

0.9597 + 0.28791 = 1.24761

1.24761 + 0.047985 = 1.295595

1.295595 + 0.0019194 ≈ 1.2975144

So, 1.352 × 0.9597 ≈ 1.2975 bar·dm³/mol².

Multiply by 100 to get J: 129.75 J/mol.

So, approximately 130 J/mol. The closest option is I: 131 J/mol
