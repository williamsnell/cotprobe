Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. It's about finding an equivalent expression by distributing a number into parentheses. The question is: Which expression is equivalent to 9(9m + 3t)? And then there are several options from A to I.

Hmm, I remember that when you have something like a number outside the parentheses, you need to distribute it by multiplying each term inside by that number. So here, the 9 outside should multiply both 9m and 3t.

Let me think step by step. The original expression is 9 times (9m plus 3t). So first, I'll distribute the 9. Multiply 9 by 9m, and then 9 by 3t.

Calculating the first term, 9 times 9m. 9*9 is 81, so that gives 81m. Then the second term, 9 times 3t. 9*3 is 27, so that's 27t. Putting them together, the expression becomes 81m + 27t.

Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: 18m + 12t. Hmm, that's 18 and 12, which are lower than 81 and 27. So probably not right.

Option B: 81m + 27t. Oh, that's exactly what I got. 81m and 27t. So this looks promising.

Option C: 27m + 81t. Wait, that's the reverse. 27m and 81t. So no, because the larger coefficient should be on m since 9*9m is bigger.

Option D: 9m +81t. That doesn't make sense. 9m would be if I only multiplied part of it, but no, that's wrong.

Option E: 81m +3t. Again, that would be if I multiplied only the m term correctly but missed the t term. 3t is way too low.

Option F: 81m +9t. Similar issue as E. 9t isn't right. Should be 27t.

Option G: 9m +27t. Both terms are smaller than they should be. 9m is way off from 81m.

Option H:72m + 27t. 72m is close but not 81m. So that's incorrect.

Option I:18m +3t. Both terms are much smaller than they should be.

Wait, so the only one that matches is option B:81m +27t. That must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is option B because when you distribute the 9 across the terms inside the parentheses, you get 81m + 27t.
