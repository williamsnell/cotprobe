Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force between an electron and a positron. Hmm, I remember that both forces are involved here. Let's think about what I know.

First, the charges. The electron has a charge of -e, and the positron has +e, right? So the magnitude of each charge is e, which I think is about 1.6 times 10^-19 coulombs. Oh wait, the exact value is approximately 1.602176634×10^-19 C, but maybe I can just use 1.6e-19 for simplicity.

Next, the masses. Both have the same mass, which is given as 9.11e-31 kg each. That's the electron mass, and since the positron is the antimatter counterpart, it has the same mass.

So I need to find the ratio F_electric / F_gravitational. Let me recall the formulas for these forces.

The electric force between two charges is given by Coulomb's Law: F_e = (k * |q1 * q2|) / r². Since the charges are opposite, the force is attractive, but since they're asking for the magnitude, I can ignore the sign.

The gravitational force between two masses is Newton's law of gravity: F_g = G * (m1 * m2) / r². Again, same r squared in the denominator.

Wait, so both forces are inversely proportional to r squared. But when taking the ratio, the r² terms will cancel out. That's convenient because the problem doesn't give a specific distance, so the ratio will be independent of r.

So the ratio is (k e²) / (G m²). Because q1 and q2 are both e, so their product is e squared. And m1 and m2 are both m (9.11e-31 kg), so their product is m squared.

Now, I need to plug in the constants. Let me jot down the known values.

k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602176634e-19 C, but maybe I can approximate to 1.6e-19 for easier calculation.

G is the gravitational constant, 6.67430e-11 N·m²/kg².

m is 9.11e-31 kg.

So substituting into the ratio:

F_e / F_g = (k * e²) / (G * m²).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate e squared: (1.6e-19)^2 = (2.56e-38) C².

Then, k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Let me compute that. 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = (8.988 * 2.56) * 1e9 * 1e-38.

8.988 * 2.56 is approximately ... let's see, 8 * 2.56 is 20.48, 0.988 * 2.56 is about 2.53, so total is around 23.01. So 23.01e-29, which is 2.301e-28.

Wait, wait: 8.988 * 2.56 = let's compute more accurately.

2.56 * 8 = 20.48.

2.56 * 0.988: 2.56 * 0.9 = 2.304; 2.56 * 0.088 = approximately 0.225 (since 0.08*2.56=0.2048, 0.008*2.56=0.02048; sum is 0.22528). So total is 2.304 + 0.22528 = 2.52928. So adding to 20.48, that's 22.92928. So 22.92928e-29, which is 2.292928e-28 N·m²/(C²) * C², but wait, the units would work out, but maybe I should just proceed numerically.

Wait, perhaps a calculator approach.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = (8.988 * 2.56) * 10^(9-38) = (approx 23) * 1e-29 = 2.3e-28, but let's compute it more accurately.

8.988 * 2.56 = 

Let me compute 8 * 2.56 = 20.48.

0.988 * 2.56: 

0.9*2.56=2.304, 0.08*2.56=0.2048, 0.008*2.56=0.02048.

So 2.304 + 0.2048 = 2.5088 + 0.02048=2.52928.

So total is 20.48 + 2.52928 = 23.00928.

So 23.00928e-29 = 2.300928e-28.

So the numerator is approximately 2.3009e-28.

Now the denominator: G * m².

G is 6.6743e-11 N·m²/kg².

m is 9.11e-31 kg, so m squared is (9.11e-31)^2.

Calculating that: 9.11 squared is about 82.99 (since 9^2 is 81, 0.11^2 is 0.0121, 2*9*0.11=1.98; so (9+0.11)^2=81 +1.98 +0.0121=82.9921). So 82.9921e-62, which is 8.29921e-61 kg².

Now multiply by G: 6.6743e-11 * 8.29921e-61.

Compute 6.6743 *8.29921 ≈ let's see, 6 *8 is 48, 6*0.29921≈1.795, 0.6743*8≈5.394, and 0.6743*0.29921≈0.2017. Adding: 48 +1.795 +5.394 +0.2017≈55.39 approximately. So 55.39e-72 (since 1e-11 *1e-61=1e-72).

Wait, that's 5.539e-71.

Wait, let's compute more accurately:

6.6743e-11 * 8.29921e-61 = (6.6743 * 8.29921) * 1e-72.

6.6743 *8.29921:

Let me compute 6 *8=48.

6 *0.29921=1.79526.

0.6743 *8=5.3944.

0.6743 *0.29921≈0.2017.

Adding all together:

48 +1.79526 =49.79526.

49.79526 +5.3944=55.18966.

55.18966 +0.2017=55.39136.

So approximately 55.39136e-72 → 5.539136e-71.

So the denominator is approximately 5.5391e-71.

Now, the ratio is numerator / denominator = (2.3009e-28) / (5.5391e-71).

Dividing these:

2.3009 /5.5391 ≈ 0.4156.

And 1e-28 /1e-71 = 1e43.

So ratio ≈ 0.4156e43 = 4.156e42.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.16e42. Exactly what I got.

Wait, but let me check if I made any approximation errors. Did I use precise enough numbers?

Let me recheck the calculations with more precise numbers.

First, e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (2.56696995e-38) C².

k is 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

k * e² = 8.9875517879e9 * 2.56696995e-38.

Calculate 8.9875517879e9 * 2.56696995e-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.9875517879 * 2.56696995 ≈ Let me compute this.

8 * 2.56696995 = 20.5358.

0.9875517879 * 2.56696995 ≈ let's compute 0.98755 *2.567.

Break it down: 2.567 * 0.9 = 2.3103; 0.08 *2.567=0.20536; 0.00755 *2.567≈0.0194. Sum: 2.3103 +0.20536=2.51566 +0.0194=2.53506.

So total for 8.98755*2.567 is 20.5358 +2.53506=23.07086.

So k*e² = 23.07086e-29 → 2.307086e-28.

Now the denominator: G=6.67430e-11, m=9.11e-31 kg.

m squared: (9.11e-31)^2 = (82.9921e-62) → 8.29921e-61.

G*m² =6.67430e-11 *8.29921e-61 = 6.6743 *8.29921e-72.

Calculate 6.6743 *8.29921.

6 *8=48.

6*0.29921=1.79526.

0.6743 *8=5.3944.

0.6743 *0.29921≈0.2017.

Adding: 48 +1.79526=49.79526 +5.3944=55.18966 +0.2017=55.39136.

So 55.39136e-72 =5.539136e-71.

Now the ratio is (2.307086e-28) / (5.539136e-71) = (2.307086 /5.539136) * 1e43.

Compute 2.307086 /5.539136 ≈ 0.4165.

So 0.4165e43 =4.165e42.

Which is approximately 4.17e42, but looking at the options, option A is 4.16e42. So perhaps my rounding during intermediate steps caused a small discrepancy, but it's very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should carry more decimal places for precise calculation. Let me compute 2.307086e-28 / 5.539136e-71.

Wait, 2.307086e-28 /5.539136e-71 equals (2.307086 /5.539136) * 1e( -28 +71 ) = (0.4165...) *1e43.

So 0.4165e43 =4.165e42.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.16e42, which is very close. So I think option A is correct.

Wait another thing: in the original calculation, I used m as 9.11e-31, which is correct. Did I miss any square roots or exponents? Let me check.

The electric force is k e² / r², gravitational is G m² / r². So F_e/F_g = (k e²) / (G m²) * (r²/r²) → (k e²)/(G m²), which is correct.

Another thing: the question says "the ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force". So yes, that's F_e / F_g.

So all steps seem correct. So the answer should be A:4.16e42.
</think>

To determine the ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force between an electron and a positron, we use the following formulas:

1. **Electrical Force (Coulomb's Law):**  
   \[
   F_e = \frac{k \cdot |q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
   \]  
   Here, \(q_1 = q_2 = e = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}\), and \(k = 8.9875517879 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2}\).

2. **Gravitational Force (Newton's Law of Gravity):**  
   \[
   F_g = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
   \]  
   Here, \(m_1 = m_2 = m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg}\), and \(G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / kg^2}\).

The ratio of the forces is given by:  
\[
\frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{k \cdot e^2}{G \cdot m^2}
\]  
Since both forces are inversely proportional to \(r^2\), the distance \(r\) cancels out.

### Calculations:
1. **Compute \(e^2\):**  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602176634 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56696995 \times 10^{-38} \, \mathrm{C^2}
   \]

2. **Compute \(k \cdot e^2\):**  
   \[
   k \cdot e^2 = (8.9875517879 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.56696995 \times 10^{-38}) = 2.307086 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2}
   \]

3. **Compute \(m^2\):**  
   \[
   m^2 = (9.11 \times 10^{-31})^2 = 8.29921 \times 10^{-61} \, \mathrm{kg^2}
   \]

4. **Compute \(G \cdot m^2\):**  
   \[
   G \cdot m^2 = (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (8.29921 \times 10^{-61}) = 5.539136 \times 10^{-71} \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2}
   \]

5. **Compute the ratio \(\frac{F_e}{F_g}\):**  
   \[
   \frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{2.307086 \times 10^{-28}}{5.539136 \times 10^{-71}} = (2.307086 / 5.539136) \cdot 10^{43} \approx 0.4165 \cdot 10^{43} = 4.165 \times 10^{42}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force is approximately \(4.16 \times 10^{42}\), which corresponds to **option A**.
