Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with motors and electrical calculations. But I'll take it step by step.

Alright, part (1) is about finding the power developed by a motor in watts and horsepower. The given data includes terminal voltage, armature current, armature resistance, and counter EMF. Let me jot down what I know:

Terminal voltage (V) = 240 volts
Armature current (I) = 60 amps
Armature resistance (R) = 0.08 ohms
Counter EMF (E) = 235.2 volts

Hmm, I remember that in a motor, the counter EMF is related to the back EMF. Oh wait, the power developed by the motor is given by the product of the counter EMF and the armature current. Because when the motor is running, the armature current times the counter EMF gives the power developed, right? Because the armature resistance causes a voltage drop, so the terminal voltage is E + I*R. But the actual power developed comes from E * I.

So for part (a), the power in watts should be E multiplied by I. Let's calculate that:

E = 235.2 V
I = 60 A
Power (watts) = 235.2 * 60 = ?

Let me do the math: 235 * 60 is 14,100, and 0.2*60 is 12, so total is 14,112 watts. Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 14,112 watts. So that's part (a) done.

Now part (b) is converting this power to horsepower. I remember that 1 horsepower is about 746 watts. So I'll divide the watts by 746 to get horsepower.

Horsepower = 14,112 / 746. Let me compute that. 746 times 18 is 13,428 (since 700*18=12,600; 46*18=828 → 12,600+828=13,428). 14,112 - 13,428 = 684. So 684 / 746 is approximately 0.917. So total is 18.917, which I can round to about 18.92 hp. Looking at the options, option I has 18.92 hp for part (b). So that matches.

So for part (1), the answers are 14,112 watts and 18.92 hp.

Now moving on to part (2). The question involves a prony brake setup. The measured speed is 1,100 rpm. The force is 16 lb, and the brake arm is 28 inches. I need to find the horsepower output.

Wait, prony brake measures torque, right? Because the force applied times the arm length gives torque. Then torque multiplied by speed (angular velocity) gives power.

First, let's compute the torque. Torque (in lb-ft) is force (lb) multiplied by the arm length (ft). Oh wait, the arm is 28 inches. So I need to convert that to feet.

28 inches = 28/12 = 2.3333... feet.

So torque τ = 16 lb * 2.3333 ft = let's calculate that. 16 * 2 = 32, 16 * 0.3333 is about 5.333, so total τ ≈ 37.333 lb-ft.

Now, the speed is 1,100 rpm. I need to convert that to radians per second or radians per minute. Wait, power in horsepower is often calculated using the formula: Power (hp) = (Torque (lb-ft) * Speed (rpm)) / 5252. Because 1 hp ≈ 5252 lb-ft per minute, I think.

So plugging in the numbers:

Power (hp) = (37.333 lb-ft * 1100 rpm) / 5252.

Let me compute the numerator first: 37.333 * 1100 = let's see. 37 * 1100 is 40,700. 0.333*1100≈366.7. So total is about 41,066.666 lb-ft·rpm.

Now divide by 5252: 41,066.666 / 5252 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 5252 * 7.8 is approximately 41,000. So 7.8 hp. But let me do it more accurately.

5252 * 7.8 → 5252 *7 = 36,764; 5252 *0.8=4,201.6 → total 36,764 +4,201.6 =40,965.6. Our numerator is 41,066.666, which is about 101 more than 40,965.6. So 101 /5252 ≈ 0.01925. So total is approximately 7.8 + 0.01925 ≈7.819 hp. So about 7.82 hp.

Looking back at the options, option I has the second part as 7.82 hp. So that would make option I the correct choice for both parts.

Wait, but let me double-check the prony brake calculation. Another way to think about it: sometimes torque is calculated as force times arm, but in units. So 16 lb times 28 inches. Since 1 ft = 12 inches, 28 inches is 28/12 ft = 2.333 ft.

So torque is 16 lb * 2.333 ft = 37.333 lb-ft. Speed is 1100 rpm. So using the formula:

Horsepower = (Torque × Speed) / 5252.

Which is (37.333 × 1100) / 5252 = (41,066.666) /5252 ≈7.82 hp. Yep, that's correct.

So putting it all together, part (1) is 14,112 W and 18.92 hp, and part (2) is 7.82 hp. So looking at the options, option I is:

I: 14,112 watts, 18.92 hp, 7.82 hp.

Yes, that's the one.

(1) To determine the power developed by the motor in watts, the formula used is:

\[
\text{Power (watts)} = \text{Counter EMF (V)} \times \text{Armature Current (A)}
\]

Given:
- Counter EMF (\(E\)) = 235.2 V
- Armature Current (\(I\)) = 60 A

\[
\text{Power (watts)} = 235.2 \times 60 = 14,112 \, \text{W}
\]

To convert this power to horsepower, the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{hp} = 746 \, \text{W}\) is used:

\[
\text{Horsepower} = \frac{\text{Power (watts)}}{746} = \frac{14,112}{746} \approx 18.92 \, \text{hp}
\]

Thus, the power developed by the motor is **14,112 watts** and **18.92 horsepower**.

(2) To calculate the horsepower output of the motor using a prony brake, the torque is first determined from the force and brake arm length. The relationship is:

\[
\text{Torque (\( \tau \))} = \text{Force (lb)} \times \text{Brake Arm (ft)}
\]

Given:
- Force = 16 lb
- Brake Arm = 28 inches = \(\frac{28}{12} = 2.333 \, \text{ft}\)

\[
\tau = 16 \times 2.333 = 37.333 \, \text{lb-ft}
\]

The horsepower is then calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Horsepower} = \frac{\text{Torque (lb-ft)} \times \text{Speed (rpm)}}{5252}
\]

Given:
- Speed = 1,100 rpm

\[
\text{Horsepower} = \frac{37.333 \times 1100}{5252} \approx 7.82 \, \text{hp}
\]

Thus, the horsepower output of the motor is **7.82 hp**.

Combining the results from both parts, the correct option is:

**I: 14,112 watts, 18.92 hp, 7.82 hp**
