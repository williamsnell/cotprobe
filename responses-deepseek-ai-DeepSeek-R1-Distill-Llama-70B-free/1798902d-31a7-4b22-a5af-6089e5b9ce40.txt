Okay, so I have this question about permutations and functions, and I need to figure out which of the options A through J is correct. Hmm. Let me take it step by step.

The question presents two statements. Statement 1 says, "Every permutation is a one-to-one function." Statement 2 says, "Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one."

Wait, I need to understand what each statement is saying. Let's start with Statement 1. A permutation, as I remember from math, is an arrangement of all the members of a set into some sequence or order. For example, if I have a set like {a, b, c}, a permutation could be {b, c, a}. Now, in terms of functions, a permutation can be thought of as a function where each element of the set is mapped to exactly one other element without repetition. So, for a finite set, a permutation is a bijection, meaning it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). 

So Statement 1 claims that every permutation is a one-to-one function. Since permutations are bijections, they are indeed one-to-one. So Statement 1 must be true.

Now, looking at Statement 2. It says that every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one. Wait a minute, so this is an "if and only if" statement, meaning both directions. Let me break it down. 

First, "if a function is a permutation, then it is one to one." I think that's true because, as I said earlier, permutations are bijections, so they must be one-to-one. 

The other direction is, "if a function is one to one, then it is a permutation." Hmm, is that always true? Wait, a permutation requires the function to be both injective and surjective. So if a function is one-to-one (injective) but not necessarily onto (surjective), then it's not a permutation. 

For example, consider the function f: {1,2} â†’ {a, b, c} defined by f(1)=a and f(2)=b. This function is injective because no two elements map to the same element. But it's not a permutation of {a, b, c} because it's not onto (c isn't mapped to by any element). So this function is one-to-one but not a permutation. Therefore, the statement that "a function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one" is false because the function might be injective but not surjective. 

Wait, but wait! The second part of Statement 2 says "if and only if". So for the entire statement to be true, both directions must hold. Since the converse isn't true, Statement 2 is false. 

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Now I look at the options. 

Looking through the options, option E says "True, False." So that would make sense. But wait, let me double-check the other options. 

Option D says both statements are true, which can't be right because Statement 2 is false. Option E is True, False. Option F says both True but Statement 2 doesn't explain Statement 1. Hmm, but since Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, E is the correct option. 

Wait, but wait again. The question is about whether every function is a permutation if and only if it's one to one. So the correct condition for a function being a permutation is that it's a bijection, which is both injective and surjective. So a function being injective alone isn't sufficient for it to be a permutation. Therefore, Statement 2's "if and only if" is incorrect. 

So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. So the answer should be option E: True, False.

Statement 1: "Every permutation is a one-to-one function."  
A permutation is a bijection, meaning it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Therefore, every permutation is indeed a one-to-one function, making Statement 1 true.

Statement 2: "Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one."  
This is an "if and only if" statement, requiring both directions to be true. While a permutation is always one-to-one, the converse is not necessarily true. A function can be one-to-one (injective) without being a permutation, as it may not be surjective. For example, a function mapping {1,2} to {a, b, c} defined by f(1)=a and f(2)=b is injective but not a permutation because it is not onto. Thus, Statement 2 is false.

Given that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, the correct answer is **E: True, False**.
