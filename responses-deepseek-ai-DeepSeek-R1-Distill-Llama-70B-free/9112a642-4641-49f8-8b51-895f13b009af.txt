Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about quasi-experimental designs versus true experimental designs. I'm a bit rusty on my research methods, but let me try to work through this.

The question is asking what distinguishes quasi-experiments from true experiments. The key here is probably the difference in how participants are assigned to groups. I remember that true experiments involve random assignment, right? Like, the researcher randomly puts participants into different groups to test the effect of an independent variable.

Quasi-experiments, on the other hand, don't use random assignment. So maybe they use some other method, like existing groups or non-random selection. But wait, what's the exact term? Oh, right, in quasi-experiments, participants might be selected based on pre-existing conditions or other non-random criteria.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: Implementation of the intervention by the researcher. Hmm, I think both true and quasi-experiments might have the researcher implementing the intervention. So that's probably not the distinguishing factor.

Option B: Pre-determined assignment of participants to groups. Not sure about this. I think pre-determined could mean different things. Maybe in quasi, the groups are already formed, like naturally existing groups.

Option C: Use of a non-comparison group. Wait, no, I think both can have comparison groups. True experiments usually have control groups, and quasi might as well. So C might not be it.

Option D: Use of multiple measures of outcome. Again, both designs can use multiple measures. That's about the outcome variables, not the assignment.

Option E: Use of a single group of participants. No, both can have single or multiple groups. Like, a time-series design in quasi might have one group, and true experiments can have multiple groups.

Option F: Use of valid and reliable measures. I don't think that's the distinguishing point. Both good studies would use valid measures.

Option G: Random assignment. Oh wait, that's the key point. True experiments use random assignment, while quasi don't. So the presence of random assignment would be a characteristic of true experiments.

Option H: Use of non-random selection. This might be quasi, because they can't assign randomly. So H could be a feature of quasi.

Option I: Use of control groups. Both might have control groups. So I isn't the distinguishing factor.

Option J: Random selection from the population. Wait, that's about sampling, not assignment. So J is about how participants are selected into the study, not into groups.

The question is about what distinguishes quasi from true experimental designs. So the main difference is whether participants are randomly assigned to groups. True experiments have random assignment (G), while quasi do not. So the correct answer would be G, because it's the presence or absence of random assignment that's the key difference.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "distinguished on the basis of whether there is..." So the correct answer is the presence or absence of random assignment. True experiments have it, quasi don't. So the distinguishing factor is whether random assignment exists.

Looking at the options, the question is what characteristic is present in true experiments but not in quasi. So the option that is present is G: random assignment. So the correct answer must be G.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is about what distinguishes them. So the answer is that true experiments have random assignment, quasi don't.

So the question is, "on the basis of whether there is..." So which one is present in true but not in quasi. So the correct option is G.

The distinguishing factor between quasi-experimental designs and true experimental designs lies in the assignment of participants to groups. True experimental designs utilize random assignment, where participants are randomly placed into groups to ensure equivalence and minimize bias. In contrast, quasi-experimental designs do not use random assignment; instead, participants are often assigned based on pre-existing conditions or non-random criteria. Among the given options, the presence of random assignment (Option G) is the key characteristic that distinguishes true experiments from quasi-experiments.

Answer: G
