Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about prisms and refracting angles. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is asking for the smallest refracting angle that a glass prism (n=1.5) can have so that no ray can be transmitted through it. And the same for a water prism (n=1.33). The options are from A to J, each giving two angles.

Wait, I remember that when light passes through a prism, there's a critical angle beyond which total internal reflection occurs. Oh wait, no, that's for a different scenario. Wait, no, for a prism, if the angle is too small, the light might not exit on the other side, right? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The situation is when the prism has a certain refracting angle, and if a light ray hits it such that it can't pass through. I think the critical case here is when the light is incident on the other face of the prism. Let me visualize a prism. It's a triangular piece of glass with two faces meeting at an angle. The refracting angle is that angle between the two faces.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is about the smallest angle where no rays are transmitted. So, when the prism's angle is too small, maybe the light can't escape. Or when it's too big? Hmm.

I think I remember that for a prism, the condition where it doesn't transmit any rays is when the refracting angle is such that the light hits the second face at an angle equal to or greater than the critical angle. So, total internal reflection occurs, and the light doesn't exit.

Wait, but how does the refracting angle of the prism relate to this? Oh right, the refracting angle is the angle between the two faces of the prism. So, when a ray enters one face, it's refracted, and then when it hits the second face, the angle at which it hits depends on the prism's angle.

Wait, so perhaps when the prism's angle is too small, the light can't exit because the angle of incidence on the second face would be beyond the critical angle. So, for a given refractive index, there's a minimum angle that the prism must have to allow transmission. If the prism's angle is smaller than that, then no light gets through.

Wait, but the question is the opposite: the smallest refracting angle where no ray can be transmitted. So, that would be the case when the prism's angle is such that the light hits the second face exactly at the critical angle. If the prism's angle were any smaller, the light would hit at an angle larger than the critical, leading to total internal reflection and no transmission.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. So, the critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs. For the light to not be transmitted, the angle of incidence on the second face must be equal to or larger than the critical angle.

So, when the prism's angle is such that the light hits the second face exactly at the critical angle, that's the threshold. If the prism's angle is smaller than this, the light would hit at a larger angle than the critical, leading to no transmission. Wait, no, because a smaller prism angle would cause the light to bend more, perhaps making the incidence angle larger.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram. Okay, imagine a prism with apex angle A (the refracting angle). When a ray enters one face, it refracts towards the normal. Then it travels through the prism and hits the other face. The angle at which it hits the second face depends on the prism's angle A.

Wait, perhaps the formula I need is related to the critical angle. The critical angle θc is given by sinθc = 1/n, where n is the refractive index of the prism material. So for glass, n=1.5, so θc would be arcsin(1/1.5) = arcsin(2/3). Let me compute that. Wait, 2/3 is approximately 0.6667. The arcsin of that is about 41.8 degrees. So θc is about 41.8 degrees.

But how does this relate to the prism's angle A? Maybe the condition is that when the prism's angle A is such that the light hits the second face at θc. So, the prism's angle would be twice the angle made by the refracted ray. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, when the light enters the prism, it's refracted. Let's assume the light is entering perpendicular to the first face, so the angle of incidence is zero. Then, the refracted angle inside the prism would be zero as well, right? Because if the incident angle is zero, the refracted angle is zero. So the light goes straight through, hits the second face. The angle of incidence on the second face would then be determined by the prism's angle.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, if the prism's faces are at an angle A, then the light travels through the prism, and when it hits the second face, the angle of incidence there would be A/2. Wait, no, perhaps the geometry is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the path of the light ray. So, the light enters the first face, refracts, then exits from the second face. But for the case where the prism's angle is such that the light hits the second face at the critical angle.

Wait, I think the formula for the minimum deviation condition is when the light passes symmetrically through the prism, entering and exiting. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation is when the light is incident on the prism such that it can't exit. So, the limit is when the light hits the second face at the critical angle, causing total internal reflection.

Wait, let's model this. Let's say a light ray enters the prism from air (n=1) into the glass or water. The first face is normal to the incident ray. Then, the refracted angle inside the prism is theta1. Then, the ray exits through the second face, but the angle at which it hits the second face is theta2. For the ray to not exit, theta2 must be equal to or greater than the critical angle.

Wait, but if the prism's angle is A, then the angle theta2 relates to A. Let me think. When the light enters the prism, it's refracted towards the normal. Then, the ray travels through the prism, and when it hits the second face, the angle inside the prism at that face determines whether it can exit.

Wait, perhaps the angle inside the prism at the second face is equal to the critical angle. So, sin(theta2) = 1/n. But theta2 is related to the prism's angle. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the relation is that the prism's angle A must be such that the angle of incidence on the second face is theta2. Suppose the light enters the prism normally (so angle of incidence is 0, refracted angle is 0), then the ray goes straight through, hitting the second face at an angle equal to A/2. So the angle of incidence on the second face is A/2. So, for the light to just not exit, A/2 must be equal to theta_c, the critical angle. So, A = 2 theta_c.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the prism's angle A is such that the second face is at A/2 relative to the path of the light, then when A/2 equals theta_c, the light hits at the critical angle. So, if A is smaller than this, the angle of incidence is larger, causing total internal reflection.

Wait, but wait, that would mean that the minimum angle A is 2 theta_c. Because if A is smaller than that, the angle of incidence would be larger than theta_c, so no transmission. So, the smallest refracting angle where no transmission occurs is when A equals 2 theta_c. Because if A is smaller than that, the condition is met.

Wait, no. Because if A is smaller than 2 theta_c, then the angle of incidence on the second face would be A/2, which is less than theta_c. So, wait, that would mean the light can exit. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I have it backwards. Let's think again. The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs. So, when the angle of incidence on the second face is greater than or equal to theta_c, the light does not exit.

So, the condition for no transmission is that the angle of incidence on the second face is greater than or equal to theta_c.

In the prism scenario, the angle of incidence on the second face is (A/2), because the prism's faces are at angle A, and the light is going straight through.

Wait, no. Because the prism's faces are at angle A, so the normal to the second face is at angle A/2 relative to the direction of the light inside the prism. So, the angle of incidence would be A/2.

Wait, but that would mean that for the light to undergo total internal reflection, the angle of incidence (A/2) must be greater than or equal to theta_c.

So, A/2 >= theta_c → A >= 2 theta_c.

Wait, but if A is larger than 2 theta_c, then the angle of incidence is larger than theta_c, so the light doesn't exit, right? So, prisms with A >= 2 theta_c would not transmit the light. But the question is asking for the smallest angle A where no transmission occurs, which would be when A equals 2 theta_c.

So, for a glass prism with n=1.5, theta_c is arcsin(1/1.5) = arcsin(2/3) ≈ 41.81 degrees. So, 2 theta_c is about 83.62 degrees. So, the smallest A where no transmission occurs is 83.62 degrees. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which option has 83 something for glass.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 83° 27' 13" for glass.

Option F: 82° 25' 12" for glass.

Option J: 81° 26' 14".

Wait, but wait, I thought the calculation was 2 * theta_c. Let me recalculate theta_c for glass. n=1.5, so sin(theta_c)=1/1.5=0.6667. Theta_c=arcsin(0.6667)=41.81 degrees. So 2*41.81 is 83.62 degrees. So, 83 degrees and 0.62 of a degree. 0.62 *60 is about 37.2 minutes, so that's 83°37' approx. Wait, but none of the options exactly match that.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: 83°27'13"

Option E: 86°28'14"

Option F: 82°25'12"

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the condition isn't A=2 theta_c, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is when the angle of incidence on the second face is theta_c. So, A/2 = theta_c. So A= 2 theta_c. So for glass, A=2*41.81=83.62 degrees.

Wait, but none of the options have exactly 83.62, but option D is 83°27'13", which is 83.4533 degrees. Close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the prism's angle is such that the light enters at a certain condition. Let me try to think differently. Suppose the light enters the prism at an angle, but the critical case is when it's incident normally on the first face.

Wait, no, earlier assumption was that the light is entering normally, which makes the refracted angle zero. Then, the angle of incidence on the second face is A/2. So, if A/2 >= theta_c, then total internal reflection occurs.

Ah, but wait, for a prism, the angle A is the apex angle. So, when the light is incident normally on the first face, it travels straight, and the angle it makes with the normal on the second face is (A/2). So, that angle of incidence is (A/2). So, when (A/2) >= theta_c, no transmission.

So, the condition is A >= 2 theta_c. So the minimal angle A is 2 theta_c, which is when (A/2) = theta_c.

So, for glass, n=1.5, theta_c=41.81°, so A=83.62°. For water, n=1.33, theta_c=arcsin(1/1.33)=arcsin(0.7519)≈48.75 degrees. So A=2*48.75≈97.5 degrees.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has glass at approximately 83.6 and water at 97.5.

Option D: Glass 83°27'13" (83.4533), Water 97°14'46" (97.246).

Hmm, close but not exact.

Option F: Glass 82°25'12" (82.42), Water 96°13'42" (96.228).

Option I: Glass 84°30'15" (84.504), Water 98°16'50" (98.280).

Hmm, my calculated values are 83.62 and 97.5.

Looking for an option where glass is about 83.6 and water about 97.5. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option D's glass is 83.4533 and water is 97.246, which is close to 97.5.

But perhaps more accurately, let me compute theta_c for water.

n_water=1.33, so theta_c=arcsin(1/1.33)=arcsin(0.7519). Let me compute that more accurately.

Using a calculator, 0.7519 in sine is approximately 48.75 degrees. So 2*48.75=97.5 degrees. So water's angle should be 97.5 degrees.

Looking at the options, option D's water angle is 97°14'46", which is 97.246, about 0.25 degrees less than 97.5.

Option I's water angle is 98°16'50"=98.280, which is higher than 97.5.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me check another method.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the condition isn't when the light hits the second face at theta_c, but when the deviation caused by the prism is such that the light can't exit. Alternatively, perhaps the approach involves the minimum deviation formula.

Wait, the formula for the minimum deviation (delta) caused by a prism is given by delta = (n-1) * A, where A is the apex angle. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the problem is about the smallest angle A where no transmission occurs, which would mean that the light doesn't exit the prism. So, when the light hits the second face at the critical angle, which is when sin(theta_c) = 1/n. So, the angle at which the light hits the second face is theta_c.

Hmm, but perhaps I should model the path of the light.

When the light enters the prism, it's refracted towards the normal, then it travels through the prism, and upon hitting the second face, the angle of incidence is the angle between the ray and the normal to that face.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach involves considering the angles more carefully. Let me consider that the light enters the prism normally, so the incident angle is 0. Then, the refracted angle inside the prism is 0. Then, the light travels straight and hits the second face. The normal to the second face is at an angle of A/2 relative to the first face's normal.

Wait, so the angle between the ray inside the prism and the normal to the second face is (90 - (A/2))? No, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, imagine a triangular prism with apex angle A. The first face is on the left, the second on the right. The light enters normally on the left face, goes straight, and hits the right face. The normal to the right face is at an angle of (A/2) relative to the incident direction. So, the angle of incidence on the right face is A/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the prism's apex angle is A, so the angle between the two faces is A. So, each face is at A/2 from the central line. So, when the light travels through, the angle between the light's path and the normal to the second face is A/2. So, the angle of incidence is A/2.

So, the condition for total internal reflection is when A/2 >= theta_c, because that's the angle of incidence. So, the minimal A is 2 theta_c.

So, for glass, 2*arcsin(1/1.5)=2*41.81=83.62 degrees.

For water, 2*arcsin(1/1.33)=2*48.75=97.5 degrees.

So, looking for an option where glass is ~83.6 and water ~97.5.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Glass 83°27'13" (83.4533), Water 97°14'46" (97.246).

Hmm, that's close. But perhaps I should check if any option matches more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the exact values.

For glass:

sin(theta_c) = 1/1.5 = 0.666666...

theta_c = arcsin(0.666666) = 41.810°.

So, A = 2 * 41.810 = 83.620°.

Converting 0.620° to minutes: 0.620 *60=37.2', so 37 minutes and 0.2*60=12 seconds. So 83°37'12".

Looking at the options, none have exactly that. So perhaps the closest is option D's 83°27'13", but that's 10 minutes less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the angle. Maybe the correct formula isn't A=2 theta_c.

Wait, another approach: When the light is incident on the prism, the maximum angle it can have and still not be transmitted is when the refracted angle inside the prism is such that upon hitting the second face, the angle of incidence equals theta_c.

So, let's model that.

Let me denote:

n = refractive index of prism.

A = apex angle of prism.
