Okay, so I've got this problem about the Boston Red Sox's home runs in eight consecutive games. The numbers are 2, 3, 0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0. And I need to find the mean, median, and mode. Let's take it step by step.

First, part (a) is the mean. Mean is the average, right? So I just add all the numbers together and then divide by how many games there are. Let me add them up:

2 + 3 is 5, plus 0 is 5. Then 3 makes 8, plus 4 is 12. Add 1, that's 13. Then 3 brings it to 16, and another 0 doesn't change it. So the total is 16. There are 8 games, so 16 divided by 8 is 2. So the mean is 2.

Wait, let me double-check the addition. 2+3=5, plus 0 is 5. Then 3 is 8, plus 4 is 12. 12+1=13, 13+3=16, plus 0 is 16. Yep, that's correct. So mean is 2.

Next, part (b) is the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are ordered. Since there are 8 games, which is even, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th numbers.

Let me order the numbers first. The original list is 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. Let's sort them from smallest to largest. So the numbers in order would be: 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4.

Now, the 4th and 5th numbers. Let me count: 1st is 0, 2nd 0, 3rd 1, 4th is 2, 5th is 3. So the median is (2 +3)/2 = 2.5. Hmm, wait, some people might think it's just the middle value, but since it's even, it's the average. So median is 2.5.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options, and the options have medians as integers or different numbers. Let me make sure I did the ordering correctly. Yeah, 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4. So 4th is 2, 5th is 3. So average is 2.5. So median is 2.5.

Wait, but sometimes in some contexts, people might round it or present differently, but I think 2.5 is correct.

Part (c) is the mode. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the sorted list: 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4.

So 0 appears twice, 3 appears three times. 1, 2, 4 appear once each. So the mode is 3.

So putting it all together: Mean is 2, median is 2.5, mode is 3.

Now, looking at the options:

Option J says Mean:2, Median:2.5, Mode:3. That's exactly what I got. Let me check the other options to be sure. Option A: mean 3, median 3, mode3. No, mean is 2. Option B: mean 2.5, but no. Option E: mean 2.16, which is wrong. Option F: mean 2.5, which isn't correct because mean is 2. Option G: mean 2, median 3, which we know median is 2.5. So option J is the correct one.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given data: the number of home runs hit by the Boston Red Sox in eight consecutive games is 2, 3, 0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0. We calculate the mean, median, and mode as follows:

1. **Mean**: The mean is the average of the numbers. Adding all the values gives \(2 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 16\). Dividing by the number of games (8) gives a mean of \(16 / 8 = 2\).

2. **Median**: The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. Sorting the data gives \(0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4\). Since there are 8 values (even), the median is the average of the 4th and 5th values: \((2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5\).

3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently. In the sorted data, 0 appears twice, and 3 appears three times. Thus, the mode is 3.

Comparing these results to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Mean: 2, Median: 2.5, Mode: 3**.

The correct option is **J**.
