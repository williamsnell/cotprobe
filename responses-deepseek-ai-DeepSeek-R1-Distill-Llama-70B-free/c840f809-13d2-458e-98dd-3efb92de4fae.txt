Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about hormones and their functions, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question is asking for the statement that's false, the exception. The options are A to E.

Starting with option A: "insulin decreases storage of glycogen." Hmm, I remember that insulin is involved in lowering blood sugar. When blood glucose is high, insulin helps cells take in glucose. It also promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles. So if insulin is present, it should increase glycogen storage, not decrease. That makes option A sound incorrect because it says insulin decreases storage. I'll keep that in mind as a possible wrong statement.

Option B: "growth hormone stimulates cell division and protein synthesis." Growth hormone, or GH, is known to promote growth. I think GH stimulates the production of IGF-1 in the liver, which then affects growth plates in bones and protein synthesis in muscles. So yes, GH does stimulate cell division and protein synthesis. So B is a true statement, so it's not the exception.

Option C: "epinephrine increases blood sugar levels and heart rate." Epinephrine is released during the fight-or-flight response. It does several things, like increasing heart rate and blood pressure. It also triggers the liver to release stored glucose (glycogen) into the bloodstream, which increases blood sugar. So C is correct, so it's not the exception.

Option D: "thyroxine increases the rate of metabolism." Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Its main role is to regulate metabolism. Higher levels of thyroxine increase metabolic rate, which can affect things like heat production and energy use. So D is a true statement, not the exception.

Option E: "vasopressin stimulates water reabsorption in the kidney." Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), plays a key role in water balance. It acts on the kidneys to increase water reabsorption, reducing urine output and maintaining proper osmotic balance. So E is correct, not the exception.

Wait, going back to option A. Insulin's role is to lower blood glucose. It does this by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells and promoting the synthesis of glycogen. So when insulin is high, like after eating, the body stores excess glucose as glycogen. If the statement says insulin decreases storage of glycogen, that's the opposite of what insulin does. So A is false, making it the correct answer to the question since all others are true.

The question asks to identify the false statement about hormone functions. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: "Insulin decreases storage of glycogen." This is incorrect because insulin actually promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles, especially after eating. Therefore, this statement is false.

- **Option B**: "Growth hormone stimulates cell division and protein synthesis." This is true. Growth hormone (GH) promotes growth by stimulating cell division and protein synthesis, often through its effects on IGF-1.

- **Option C**: "Epinephrine increases blood sugar levels and heart rate." This is true. Epinephrine, released during the fight-or-flight response, increases blood sugar by triggering glycogen breakdown and also raises heart rate.

- **Option D**: "Thyroxine increases the rate of metabolism." This is true. Thyroxine, a thyroid hormone, plays a key role in regulating metabolism and increasing metabolic rate.

- **Option E**: "Vasopressin stimulates water reabsorption in the kidney." This is true. Vasopressin (ADH) acts on the kidneys to promote water reabsorption, helping maintain water balance.

The false statement is **Option A**, as insulin increases glycogen storage rather than decreasing it.

Answer: A
