Question:

 West argues that feminist legal theory has inadvertently led to the under-acknowledgement of the harms of consensual sex because

Options:

A: it posits that all sex is rape.
B: by suggesting that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, it implies that all consensual sex is good.
C: by suggesting that the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender, it implies that women are not especially harmed by nonconsensual sex.
D: it supports the idea that consent is the only factor determining the harm of sex.
E: it implies that consensual sex is inherently harmful.
F: by suggesting that the harm of rape is only physical, it implies that emotional trauma in consensual sex is not harmful.
G: by suggesting that rape is only harmful in cases of physical injury, it implies that psychological harm in consensual sex is not important.
H: it suggests that the harm of rape is entirely dependent on the victim's personal perception, thereby downplaying the potential harms of consensual sex.
I: all of the above.
J: it argues that women are not capable of giving consent.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about feminist legal theory and its implications on the perception of consensual sex. The question is asking why West argues that feminist legal theory has led to under-acknowledging the harms of consensual sex.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question is saying. The question mentions that West is making this argument, so I'm probably dealing with a critique of certain feminist legal theories. I remember that some feminist theories focus a lot on consent, especially in the context of sexual interactions. The idea is that if something is consensual, it's okay, and if it's not, it's harmful, like rape.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that feminist legal theory posits all sex is rape. I don't think that's right because that's more of a radical view, maybe from someone like Andrea Dworkin, but I'm not sure if that's the mainstream position. Plus, the question is about under-acknowledging the harms of consensual sex, not about all sex being bad.

Option B suggests that by saying rape's harm is nonconsensual, it implies consensual sex is good. This makes sense because if the main issue with rape is the lack of consent, then the presence of consent might make the sex automatically acceptable. So, any harms in consensual sex might be overlooked because the focus is on consent as the determining factor.

Option C talks about rape's harm not being related to gender. I'm not sure about this one. Feminist theories often emphasize how rape is a gendered crime, so if a theory says it has nothing to do with gender, that might be a different critique. But the question is about consensual sex's harms, so I'm not sure how this connects.

Option D claims the theory supports consent as the only factor. That ties into what I was thinking earlier. If consent is the main factor, then other aspects like power dynamics or emotional impact might be ignored, leading to under-acknowledging harms.

Option E says it implies consensual sex is inherently harmful, which doesn't seem right because if anything, the theory might be saying the oppositeâ€”that consensual sex is good.

Option F suggests the harm of rape is only physical, so emotional trauma in consensual sex isn't seen as harmful. That's a possibility, but I'm not sure if this is the main point West is making.

Options G and H are similar, focusing on physical injury or personal perception. Again, I'm not certain these are the central arguments here.

Option I says all of the above, which is possible, but I think the question is pointing towards a specific reason.

Option J argues women can't give consent, which I don't think is widely accepted in feminist theory. Most theories emphasize the importance of consent as something that can be given.

So, going back, the main idea seems to be that by focusing on consent as the key factor, feminist legal theory might overlook other harms in consensual sex. That points to options B and D. Option B says that because rape is nonconsensual, consensual sex is implied to be good. Option D says consent is the only factor. Both seem related.

Wait, but the question is about under-acknowledging the harms of consensual sex. So if the theory suggests that as long as there's consent, there's no harm, then any harm in consensual sex is ignored. That would fit with option B, which implies consensual is good, and D, which says consent is the only factor.

But which one is more accurate? I think the key point is that by defining rape's harm as nonconsensual, it creates a binary where consensual is automatically good. So the harm in consensual sex isn't considered because the theory focuses on consent as the main issue.

So option B seems to capture that reasoning better. It's not just about consent being a factor but about the implication that consensual sex is good because the harm of rape is its lack of consent.

West argues that feminist legal theory has inadvertently led to the under-acknowledgement of the harms of consensual sex because it suggests that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, thereby implying that all consensual sex is good. This reasoning aligns with option B, which captures the idea that by focusing on nonconsent as the defining harm of rape, the theory creates a binary where consensual sex is automatically viewed as acceptable. As a result, potential harms within consensual sex are overlooked.

Answer: B
