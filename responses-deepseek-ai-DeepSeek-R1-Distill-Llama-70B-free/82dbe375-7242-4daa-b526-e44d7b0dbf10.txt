Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a song from the 17th century called "Poor Winter King." The question is asking about an important underlying issue in the song. The options are A through J, each representing a different issue.

First, I'll read the song lyrics again to understand the context. The song addresses the Winter King, who is being shamed for snatching the kaiser's crown. It mentions that Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king. The song tells the Winter King to go to Ferdinand and beg for pardon.

Hmm, so the Winter King must be someone who took the crown, implying he's not the rightful ruler. The song is critical of him for this action. The mention of Ferdinand as the lawful king suggests that the issue is about who has the right to rule.

So, thinking about the options, it's likely related to rules of succession. Option C is about that. But wait, could it be about religious conflict? Because the Thirty Years War, which I think involved the Winter King, was partly religious. Frederick V, the Winter King, was a Protestant who took the crown of Bohemia, which was a Catholic region. Ferdinand II, the lawful king, was a Catholic. So maybe the underlying issue is religious conflict, option H.

But the song doesn't explicitly mention religion. It focuses on the legitimacy of the king. So perhaps it's more about succession and the right to rule. So option C might be the answer. Alternatively, since religious issues were a big part of that conflict, maybe H is correct.

Wait, the song says that the world knows Ferdinand is the lawful king. So it's emphasizing the legitimacy based on rules of succession. The Winter King's action is seen as wrong because Ferdinand is the rightful ruler. So the underlying issue is about the rules of who should inherit or rule, which points to option C.

But I'm a bit confused because the historical context includes religious elements. However, the song itself doesn't mention religion directly. It's more about the legitimacy of the ruler. So I think the answer is C: Rules of royal succession.
