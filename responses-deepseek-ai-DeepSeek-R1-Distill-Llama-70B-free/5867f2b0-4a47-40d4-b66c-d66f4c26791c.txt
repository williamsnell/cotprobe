Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that each square meter of the Earth's surface supports 1e7 grams of air. Wait, 1e7 grams is 10 million grams, which is 10,000,000 grams. That's a lot! So, 1e7 grams per square meter.

But wait, the question is about oxygen, specifically O2. So I need to find out how much oxygen is in that air. The problem states that air is 20% oxygen by weight. So 20% of that 1e7 grams is oxygen.

Let me calculate that first. 20% is the same as 0.2. So 0.2 multiplied by 1e7 grams. Let's see, 1e7 is 10^7, so 0.2 * 1e7 = 2e6 grams of oxygen. Oh wait, no wait: 0.2 * 1e7 is 2e6? Wait, 1e7 is 10 million, 20% is 2 million, which is 2e6 grams. Right.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 10 million grams is 1e7. 20% of that is 0.2 * 1e7 = 2e6 grams. So that's 2,000,000 grams of O2 per square meter.

But the question asks for moles of O2. So I need to convert grams to moles. I remember that the molecular weight of O2 is 32 g/mol. So moles would be mass divided by molecular weight.

So the moles of O2 would be 2e6 grams / 32 g/mol. Let me compute that. 2e6 divided by 32.

Wait, 2e6 is 2,000,000. So 2,000,000 / 32. Hmm. Let's see: 32 goes into 200,000 how many times? 32 * 6 = 192, so 6 times 32 is 192. 200,000 - 192,000 is 8,000. Wait, maybe there's a better way to compute this.

Alternatively, 32 is 3.2e1. So 2e6 / 3.2e1 = (2/3.2) * 1e5. Because 1e6 /1e1 is 1e5.

2 divided by 3.2 is equal to 0.625. Because 3.2 * 0.625 = 2. So 0.625 times 1e5 is 6.25e4. Oh wait, 6.25e4 is 62,500. But wait, the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options.

Looking back: The options are A through J.

Option H is 6e4 moles. Which is 60,000. Close to 62,500. Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, another approach: 2e6 /32 = (2 /32) * 1e6 = (1/16) *1e6 = 62,500. So 6.25e4, which is 62,500.

Looking at the options again. Let me see:

Option H is 6 ×10^4 =60,000.

Option F is 3e4, which is 30,000. That's half of 60,000, so that's not it.

Wait, any other options? Let me check again.

The options are:

A:8e4 →80,000
B:7e5 →700,000
C:1e5 →100,000
D:2.5e4 →25,000
E:2e6 →2,000,000
F:3e4 →30,000
G:5e3 →5,000
H:6e4 →60,000
I:1.5e5 →150,000
J:4e4 →40,000

So the correct calculation is 6.25e4, which is 62,500. But the closest option is H:6e4, which is 60,000. Or maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial steps.

Wait, the total air is 1e7 grams. Oxygen is 20% of that, which is 2e6 grams. Right.

Molecular weight of O2 is 32 g/mol. So moles = 2e6 /32 = 62,500 moles. That's 6.25e4.

But the options don't have 6.25e4. So H is 6e4, which is 60,000, and I is 1.5e5, which is 150,000. Hmm. So 6.25e4 is closer to 6e4 (60k) than to 6.3e4 (63k), but wait, which option is available?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says each square meter supports 1e7 grams of air above it. Right.

20% of that is O2, so 0.2 *1e7 =2e6 grams O2. Correct.

O2 molecular weight is 32 g/mol. So 2e6 /32 = 62500 moles, which is 6.25e4. Hmm.

Looking again, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check each one again.

Option H is 6e4. Which is 60,000. But wait, 62,500 is 6.25e4, which is 25% higher than 6e4. Hmm. But perhaps the question is approximate, so 6e4 is the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of grams to moles.

Wait, let me recalibrate. 32g is 1 mole of O2.

So 2e6 grams is how many moles? 2e6 /32 = 62500.

Which is approximately 6.25e4, so 6.25 ×10^4.

So the closest option is H:6e4, which is 6 ×1e4.

But wait, option I is 1.5e5, which is 150,000. That's much higher. So H is the closest.

Wait, but another thought: wait, the problem says "each square meter of the earth's surface supports 1e7 g of air above it." So that is the mass of air. So 20% of that is O2.

Yes, that's correct. So 2e6 grams O2.

Now, 2e6 grams divided by 32 g/mol is 62,500 moles. So 6.25e4.

But the options don't have that exact value. So perhaps we're to approximate.

But looking at the options, the closest is H:6e4. However, another possibility is that perhaps the initial value was 1e7 grams, which is 10 million grams. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, 1e7 grams is 10,000,000 grams. 20% is 2e6 grams O2. So that's correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I made a mistake because the molecular weight of O2 is 32 g/mol.

Wait, O has atomic weight 16, so O2 is 32. Correct. So that part is right.

So the calculation of 2e6 /32 =62,500 is correct.

Looking at the options, the only one in that ballpark is H:6e4, which is 60,000. The next higher is I:1.5e5, which is 150,000, which is too high. So H is the closest.

Wait, but why isn't there an option for 6.25e4? Maybe because the question says "approximately". So 6.25e4 is approximately 6e4, but another way to look is 6.25e4 is 62.5e3, which is 6.25 ×10^4. So perhaps option H is the best fit.

So the correct answer is H:6e4.

To determine the number of moles of oxygen (O₂) above each square meter of the Earth's surface, we start with the given data:

1. Each square meter supports **1 × 10⁷ g** of air.
2. Air is **20% oxygen by weight**, so the mass of O₂ is:
   \[
   0.2 \times 1 \times 10^7 = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{g of O₂}.
   \]

3. The molecular weight of O₂ is **32 g/mol**, so the number of moles of O₂ is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \times 10^6}{32} = 6.25 \times 10^4 \, \text{moles of O₂}.
   \]

4. Among the given options, the closest value to **6.25 × 10⁴** is **6 × 10⁴**, which corresponds to **Option H**.

Thus, the approximate number of moles of O₂ above each square meter of the Earth's surface is **6 × 10⁴**.
