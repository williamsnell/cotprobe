Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about Lenin's contribution to Marxist economic theory. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking specifically what Lenin contributed. I remember that Marx had several key ideas, like the labor theory of value, class struggle, and historical materialism. But Lenin built upon those, right? So I need to focus on Lenin's specific additions.

One thing that comes to mind is Lenin's work on imperialism. I think he wrote a book called "Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism." In that, he explained how imperialism was a late stage of capitalism where capitalist nations compete for colonies and resources. This was an expansion of Marx's theories, applying them to the global context of his time.

Looking at the options, option F says "An explanation of imperialism." That sounds right. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Option A is about expanding the welfare state. I don't think that was Lenin; that's more related to social democracy or maybe later policies in some countries.

Option B is historical materialism. No, that's Marx's concept, part of his overall theory.

Option C is the theory of permanent revolution. I think that was Trotsky's idea, not Lenin's. Trotsky believed that the revolution should continue without stopping, but Lenin had his own views, especially about the vanguard party.

Option D is five-year plans. That's more associated with Stalin's policies after Lenin's death, part of the Soviet Union's economic planning.

Option E is class struggle, which is definitely a Marxist concept, not something Lenin originated.

Option F again is imperialism. Yeah, Lenin did contribute that as a major work.

Option G is abolition of capitalism. That's more of a general goal of communism rather than a specific theory contribution.

Option H is introduction of communism. Well, Marx introduced the concept, and Lenin implemented it, but the theory itself was Marx's.

Option I is dictatorship of the proletariat. That term was actually used by Marx, but Lenin did expand on it in his "State and Revolution," discussing how the state would act as the dictatorship of the proletariat during the transition.

Wait, so is the question about economic theory specifically? The dictatorship is more about political structure, but maybe in the context of economic theory, it's relevant.

But I was pretty sure that Lenin's main contribution was the imperialism theory. Also, looking at the options, F is about explaining imperialism, which fits with his book.

So I think the correct answer is F.

The correct answer is F. Lenin's significant contribution to Marxist economic theory was his explanation of imperialism in his work "Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism," where he analyzed it as a late stage of capitalism characterized by global competition for colonies and resources.
