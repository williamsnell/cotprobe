Okay, so I've got this problem about electromagnetic waves and standing waves. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts: (a), (b), and (c). Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): "Under what conditions is there a pure standing wave?" Hmm. I remember that a pure standing wave occurs when the reflected wave and the incident wave are such that they completely cancel or reinforce each other in a way that there's no net propagation of energy. Oh wait, no, that's not exactly right. A standing wave is formed when two waves of the same amplitude, frequency, and wavelength travel in opposite directions. So for a pure standing wave, especially in the context of reflection, I think the condition is that the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident wave and is in phase with it when they meet again. Or wait, maybe it's when the boundary conditions are such that the reflection causes maximum reflection. Oh, right! When the medium is perfectly conducting, like a short circuit, then the reflection coefficient is -1, meaning the amplitude of the reflected wave is equal to the incident wave. So E1 would be equal in magnitude to E but opposite in phase. Wait, but in this problem, E is given as 5 volts/meter. So for a pure standing wave, E1 must be equal in amplitude but opposite in phase. So E1 would be -5 V/m. Because then when they superimpose, you get nodes and antinodes without any propagating wave—so it's a pure standing wave.

So part (a)'s condition is E1 = -E. Since E is 5 V/m, E1 should be -5 V/m.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has (a) E1 = -5. Checking the options:

Option C: (a) E1 = -5 V/m. So that's correct for part (a).

Moving to part (b): "The standing wave ratio when E1 = 1/10 volt/meter." Wait, E1 is 0.1 V/m. Standing wave ratio (VSWR) is calculated by the formula (E_max)/(E_min), where E_max is the maximum amplitude in the standing wave and E_min is the minimum. Alternatively, I think another formula relates the reflection coefficient to VSWR. Oh right, VSWR is (1 + |Γ|)/(1 - |Γ|), where Γ is the reflection coefficient. Γ is E1/E, but considering the phase. Wait, the reflection coefficient Γ is E1/E. But wait, actually, wait—usually, the reflection coefficient is calculated as (E_reflected)/(E_incident). So Γ = E1/E. Here, E is 5 V/m, and E1 is 0.1 V/m. So Γ = 0.1 / 5 = 0.02. But wait, the phase matters. If E1 is positive, then Γ is positive, meaning in phase. If E1 is negative, Γ is negative. So in this case, E1 is given as positive 0.1, so Γ is 0.02.

So VSWR = (1 + |Γ|)/(1 - |Γ|) = (1 + 0.02)/(1 - 0.02) = 1.02 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0408. So approximately 1.04.

Looking at the options for part (b), which option gives VSWR ≈ 1.04 when part (a) is correct (i.e., option C). Option C's part (b) is VSWR = 1.04. So that fits.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm using the correct formula. Another approach: the standing wave ratio is also (E_max)/(E_min). E_max is E + E1 when they are in phase, and E_max is E - E1 when they are out of phase. Wait, maybe not. Oh wait, more accurately, the maximum occurs when the two amplitudes add constructively, and the minimum when destructively. So E_max = E + E1 (if they are in phase). Wait, but wait—since it's a wave, the actual maximum is when the reflected wave and the incident wave reinforce. So if E is the incident and E1 is the reflected, then the resultant E is E_incident + E_reflected. But wait, actually, when the reflection is such that the two are in phase, then their sum is maximum, and when out of phase, minimum. So, E_max = E + E1, E_min = |E - E1|. Wait, but I need to consider the phase.

Wait, no, that's not quite right because the reflected wave might have a phase shift upon reflection. So the actual formula for VSWR is (E_incident + E_reflected) / (E_incident - E_reflected), but considering their signs. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reflection coefficient.

Wait, let me get this straight. The formula for VSWR is (1 + ρ) / (1 - ρ), where ρ is the magnitude of the reflection coefficient. But wait, ρ is |Γ|, the magnitude. So if Γ is positive, that means the reflection is in phase, leading to maximum constructive interference. So when Γ is positive, E1 is same phase as E. But in our part (a), E1 was -5, which would be Γ = -1, so ρ =1, so VSWR would be (1+1)/(1-1), but that's undefined, which makes sense because it leads to a pure standing wave with nodes and antinodes.

But for part (b), E1 is 0.1 V/m, so Γ = 0.1 /5 = 0.02, positive. So VSWR is (1 + 0.02)/(1 - 0.02) = 1.02/0.98 ≈ 1.0408. So that's about 1.04, which matches option C's part (b).

Now part (c): "The value of E_max and E_min when E1 = 3/5 volt/meter." 3/5 V/m is 0.6 V/m. So E1 is 0.6.

So, to find E_max and E_min. Now, the maximum occurs when the two waves add in phase, and the minimum when they are out of phase. So E_max is E + E1 (if they are in phase), and E_min is E - E1 (if they are in phase). But wait, this depends on the phase relationship. Because, if the reflection causes a phase shift, then the actual max and min could be different.

Wait, another approach. The standing wave's maximum amplitude is given by E_max = E + E1 (if same phase) and E_min = |E - E1| (if same phase). But if the reflection causes a phase shift of π (so E1 is negative), then E_max would be |E - E1| and E_min would be E + |E1|, but I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I think the general formula is E_max = |E_incident + E_reflected|, and E_min = |E_incident - E_reflected|, but wait, no. No, the correct way is that the standing wave's amplitude varies between E_incident + E_reflected (when in phase) and |E_incident - E_reflected| (when out of phase). So actually, E_max = E + E1 when they are in phase, and E_min = |E - E1| when they are in phase. But wait, if the reflection causes a phase shift, E1 would be negative, so E_incident and E_reflected would be out of phase.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reflection coefficient. The amplitude of the standing wave is E_incident*(1 + Γ), but considering the phase. So perhaps the maximum E is E*(1 + |Γ|) and the minimum is E*(1 - |Γ|). But wait, that depends on whether Γ is positive or negative.

Wait, let me think again. The incident wave is E = E0 e^{jωt - jkz}, and the reflected wave is E1 = Γ E0 e^{jωt + jkz}. The sum is E_total = E0 e^{jωt} [e^{-jkz} + Γ e^{jkz}]. The amplitude would be proportional to (1 + Γ e^{j2kz}) ), but wait, in terms of phasors, the maximum and minimum would depend on the value of Γ.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the maximum and minimum of the standing wave. The standing wave's amplitude at any point is given by E = E_incident + E_reflected. But because the reflected wave is traveling in the opposite direction, when you add them, you get a standing wave.

So for maximum amplitude, the two would add constructively, meaning same phase. So E_max = E + E1, and E_min = |E - E1|. But wait, if E1 is negative, that's a 180-degree phase shift. So when E1 is negative, E_max would be E + |E1| if they are in phase, but if E1 is negative, then E_incident and E_reflected are out of phase, so the maximum would be |E - E1|.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think numerically. Here, E1 is 0.6 V/m, which is given as positive. So Γ is positive, meaning same phase reflection.

So, the maximum would be when the two are in phase. So E_max = E + E1 = 5 + 0.6 = 5.6 V/m.

The minimum would be when they're out of phase, which would be E - E1, but since E1 is positive, perhaps when the reflected wave is subtracted. Hmm, no, that might not be right. Wait, if the incident and reflected are in phase, then when they meet at a certain point (like a node), their sum would be maximum. Wait, perhaps the maximum and minimum are E (1 + Γ) and E (1 - Γ), but wait, Γ is the reflection coefficient, which is E1/E. So Γ = 0.6 /5 = 0.12.

So then, E_max = E*(1 + Γ) =5*(1.12) =5.6 V/m.

E_min = E*(1 - Γ) =5*(0.88)=4.4 V/m.

So for part (c), E_max is 5.6 and E_min is 4.4. Looking back at the options, option C's part (c) says E_max=5.6 and E_min=4.4. So that fits.

So putting it all together: 

(a) E1 is -5 V/m → condition for pure standing wave.

(b) VSWR ≈1.04 when E1=0.1 V/m.

(c) E_max=5.6, E_min=4.4 when E1=0.6 V/m.

So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

### Part (a): Condition for a Pure Standing Wave
A pure standing wave occurs when the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident wave but is out of phase by \(180^\circ\). This happens when the reflection coefficient \(\Gamma = -1\), meaning \(E_1 = -E\). Given \(E = 5 \, \text{V/m}\), the condition for a pure standing wave is \(E_1 = -5 \, \text{V/m}\). This matches **Option C**.

---

### Part (b): Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) When \(E_1 = 1/10 \, \text{V/m}\)
The standing wave ratio is given by:

\[
\text{VSWR} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}
\]

Here, \(\Gamma = \frac{E_1}{E} = \frac{0.1}{5} = 0.02\). Substituting:

\[
\text{VSWR} = \frac{1 + 0.02}{1 - 0.02} = \frac{1.02}{0.98} \approx 1.04
\]

This matches **Option C**, which states \(\text{VSWR} = 1.04\).

---

### Part (c): \(E_{\text{max}}\) and \(E_{\text{min}}\) When \(E_1 = 3/5 \, \text{V/m}\)
The maximum and minimum amplitudes of the standing wave are given by:

\[
E_{\text{max}} = E + E_1, \quad E_{\text{min}} = |E - E_1|
\]

Substituting \(E = 5 \, \text{V/m}\) and \(E_1 = 0.6 \, \text{V/m}\):

\[
E_{\text{max}} = 5 + 0.6 = 5.6 \, \text{V/m}, \quad E_{\text{min}} = |5 - 0.6| = 4.4 \, \text{V/m}
\]

This matches **Option C**, which states \(E_{\text{max}} = 5.6 \, \text{V/m}\) and \(E_{\text{min}} = 4.4 \, \text{V/m}\).

---

### Final Answer
All parts of the question are correctly addressed by **Option C**.
