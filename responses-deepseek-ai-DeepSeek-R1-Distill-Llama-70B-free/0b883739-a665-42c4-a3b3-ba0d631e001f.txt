Okay, so I've got this problem about steam condensing on a pipe. Hmm, I remember that when steam condenses, it's a heat transfer problem. The question gives me a horizontal pipe with a 2-inch internal diameter, but wait, I think the important part is the outer surface since that's where the condensation is happening. Oh right, the pipe's outer surface is maintained at 100°F, and the steam is saturated at 2 psia.

Wait, so I need to find the rate of steam condensation per foot of pipe length. The options are given from A to J, so I'll need to calculate and match.

I think the first step is to determine the temperature difference. The steam is at 2 psia. I should find the saturation temperature at that pressure. Oh right, I remember that at atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia), water boils at 212°F, but lower pressures have lower boiling points. So 2 psia must correspond to a lower temperature.

I need to look up the saturation temperature for steam at 2 psia. Wait, from my notes, I think at 2 psia, the saturation temperature is around 120°F? Or maybe higher? Wait no, wait, lower pressure should have lower temp. Let me think, at 14.7 psia it's 212°F. At 1 atm, lower. So 2 psia is just a bit above that. Wait, maybe 120°F? Or was it 126? Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, I can use the steam tables.

Alternatively, maybe I can estimate. Let's see, if I remember correctly, at 1 psia, the saturation temperature is around 101.7°F. So 2 psia is higher than that. Maybe around 120°F? Or perhaps I should get exact values. Oh wait, I don't have the exact table here, but maybe I can proceed by considering that the steam's saturation temp is higher than the pipe's surface temp. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, condensation occurs when the pipe is cooler than the steam. Oh wait, the pipe's surface is at 100°F, and the steam is at 2 psia. So what's the saturation temperature at 2 psia?

Wait, maybe I should recall that at 2 psia, the saturation temperature (T_sat) is 120.2°F. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I think that's right. So the steam is at 120.2°F, and the pipe surface is at 100°F. So the temperature difference ΔT is 120.2 - 100 = 20.2°F.

Now, for film condensation on a horizontal pipe, the heat transfer coefficient (h) can be calculated using the Nusselt theory. The formula for a horizontal cylinder is h = (k * (ρ_l - ρ_v) * g * h_fg) / (D * ν_l) )^(1/4) * [1 + (0.387 * ( (Pr_l * (ρ_l/(ρ_v))^(1/2)) )^(1/6) )) ) ].

Wait, no, wait. The Nusselt equation for a horizontal cylinder (like a pipe) is Nu = ( (h_fg * g * ρ_l (ρ_l - ρ_v) D ) / (k_l ν_l ΔT ) )^(1/4) ) * [ 1 + 0.388 * ( ( ( ρ_l ρ_v )^(1/2) ) * Pr_l ) )^(1/6) ) ]

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the simplified equation for film condensation on a horizontal cylinder is:

h = 0.729 * ( ( g * ρ_l (ρ_l - ρ_v) * k_l * h_fg ) / ( D * ν_l * ΔT ) )^(1/4)

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct form. Alternatively, I think for horizontal tubes, the correlation is Nu = 0.729 [ (g * (ρ_l (ρ_l - ρ_v) ) * h_fg D ) / (k_l ν_l ΔT) ) ]^(1/4)

So, h = (k_l / D) * Nu

So, putting it all together, I'll need the properties of steam at T_sat, which is 120.2°F. Wait, but wait, the pipe surface is at 100°F, which is below T_sat. So the steam condenses, releasing heat.

Wait, no. Wait, the steam is at 2 psia, which is its saturation pressure. So, the steam is at 120.2°F, and the pipe's surface is at 100°F, so the steam will condense on the pipe.

So, for the properties, I should evaluate them at the saturation temperature of 120.2°F, which is the temperature of the steam.

But wait, sometimes in condensation, the properties are taken at the film temperature, which is (T_sat + T_wall)/2. Here, T_wall is 100°F, T_sat is 120.2°F, so film temp is (120.2 +100)/2 = 110.1°F. But for condensation of steam, it's common to take the properties at the saturation temperature because the liquid is subcooled only slightly. So I think using the properties at T_sat is acceptable.

So, I'll need to find the following properties for saturated liquid (water) at 120.2°F:

- ρ_l (density)
- k_l (thermal conductivity)
- ν_l (kinematic viscosity)
- Pr_l (Prandtl number)
- h_fg (latent heat of vaporization)

Similarly, for the vapor (steam), I need ρ_v.

I think I can get these from steam tables. Let me jot down the values as I remember or approximate.

At 120.2°F (which is about 2 psia), the properties are approximately:

- T_sat = 120.2°F
- P_sat = 2 psia
- ρ_l ≈ 52 lbm/ft³ (but wait, I think at higher temps, density decreases. At 100°F, it's about 62 lbm/ft³, so at 120, maybe around 52 lbm/ft³)
- ρ_v ≈ 0.03 lbm/ft³ (since at 1 atm, it's about 0.045 lbm/ft³, but 2 psia is higher pressure, so density is higher. Wait, higher pressure would mean higher density for vapor. So at 2 psia, maybe ρ_v is around 0.03 lbm/ft³)
Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I can get exact values.

Wait, let me think: At 2 psia, the saturation temperature is 120.21°F. Looking up the steam tables, the saturated liquid properties:

- v_f = specific volume of liquid = 0.0177 ft³/lbm
So, ρ_l = 1 / v_f ≈ 56.54 lbm/ft³.

Wait, I'm getting confused between Imperial and SI units. Let me make sure I'm using the right units.

Wait, the units are in lbm, ft, etc. So:

At 2 psia:

- T_sat = 120.21°F
- v_f = 0.0177 ft³/lbm → ρ_l = 1/0.0177 ≈ 56.53 lbm/ft³
- h_f = 98.93 BTU/lbm
- h_fg = 970.3 BTU/lbm (latent heat)
- Pr_l = 2.29 (Prandtl number for liquid)
- μ_l = 0.0001908 lbm/ft-hr → kinematic viscosity ν_l = μ_l / ρ_l → 0.0001908 /56.53 ≈ 3.375e-6 ft²/hr
Wait, kinematic viscosity ν has units of ft²/s, but in this case, since the viscosity is given in lbm/ft-hr, we need to compute ν_l correctly.

Wait, dynamic viscosity μ has units of lbm/(ft·hr). Kinematic viscosity ν is μ/ρ. So:

ν_l = μ_l / ρ_l = (0.0001908 lbm/ft-hr) / (56.53 lbm/ft³) → 0.0001908 / 56.53 → approx 3.375e-6 ft²/hr.

Wait, but 1 ft²/hr is equal to (1/3600) ft²/s. So 3.375e-6 ft²/hr = 3.375e-6 / 3600 ≈ 9.375e-10 ft²/s. But maybe I should keep it in ft²/hr for now.

Wait, but when I'm using the formula, I need to make sure all units are consistent. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert to SI units, compute, and then convert back. But perhaps it's manageable in Imperial.

Wait, let's outline all the properties I have:

- ρ_l = 56.53 lbm/ft³
- ρ_v: At 2 psia, the specific volume v_g is about 23.4 ft³/lbm → so ρ_v = 1 / 23.4 ≈ 0.0427 lbm/ft³
Wait, wait, no. At 2 psia, for vapor, the specific volume is v_g = 23.4 ft³/lbm. So ρ_v = 1 / 23.4 ≈ 0.0427 lbm/ft³.

- k_l: Thermal conductivity of liquid water at 120°F. I think it's around 0.364 BTU/(hr·ft·°F)
Wait, no, wait. Thermal conductivity of water at higher temps decreases. At 100°F, it's about 0.364, so at 120°F, maybe around 0.345 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

- h_fg = 970.3 BTU/lbm
- Pr_l = 2.29
- ν_l = 3.375e-6 ft²/hr
- D = 2 inches = 2/12 = 0.1667 ft

Now, let's compute the Nusselt number, which is:

Nu = 0.729 * [ (g * ρ_l (ρ_l - ρ_v) * h_fg * D ) / (k_l * ν_l * ΔT) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, the formula could be written as:

h = 0.729 * [ (g * ρ_l (ρ_l - ρ_v) * k_l * h_fg ) / (D * ν_l * ΔT) ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, but I think I'm getting the formula mixed up. Let me try to look up the correct Nusselt number expression for film condensation on a horizontal cylinder.

Upon checking, the correct formula is:

h = 0.729 * [ (g * (ρ_l - ρ_v) * ρ_l * h_fg * k_l ) / (D * ν_l * ΔT) ) ]^(1/4 )

So, h is the heat transfer coefficient.

So, plugging in the numbers:

First, compute each term:

g = 32.174 ft/s² (I think in Imperial units, g is 32.2 ft/s²)

ρ_l - ρ_v = 56.53 - 0.0427 ≈ 56.49 lbm/ft³

h_fg = 970.3 BTU/lbm

k_l = 0.345 BTU/(hr·ft·°F)

D = 0.1667 ft

ν_l = 3.375e-6 ft²/hr

ΔT = 120.21 - 100 = 20.21 °F

Now, let's compute the numerator inside the brackets:

g * (ρ_l - ρ_v) * ρ_l * h_fg * k_l 

= 32.174 * 56.49 * 56.53 * 970.3 * 0.345

Wait, let me compute step by step:

First, compute g*(ρ_l - ρ_v):

32.174 ft/s² * 56.49 lbm/ft³ → (32.174)(56.49) ≈ 1818.5 lbm/(s²·ft²)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each part numerically.

Wait, the units for numerator inside the [ ] would be:

g (ft/s²) * (ρ_l - ρ_v) (lbm/ft³) * ρ_l (lbm/ft³) * h_fg (BTU/lbm) * k_l (BTU/(hr·ft·°F)) 

Hmm, wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should think in terms of units to make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term numerically, and then plug into the formula.

Let me compute each term:

g = 32.174 ft/s²

(ρ_l - ρ_v) = 56.53 - 0.0427 = 56.4873 lbm/ft³

ρ_l = 56.53 lbm/ft³

h_fg = 970.3 BTU/lbm

k_l = 0.345 BTU/(hr·ft·°F)

D = 0.1667 ft

ν_l = 3.375e-6 ft²/hr

ΔT = 20.21 °F

Now compute the numerator:

g * (ρ_l - ρ_v) * ρ_l * h_fg * k_l

= 32.174 * 56.4873 * 56.53 * 970.3 * 0.345

Let me compute step by step:

32.174 * 56.4873 ≈ 32.174 * 56.4873 ≈ Let's compute 32 * 56 = 1792, and 0.174 *56 ≈ 9.744, so approx 1792 + 9.744 = 1801.744. But more accurately:

32.174 * 56.4873 = Let me compute:

56.4873 * 30 = 1694.619

56.4873 * 2.174 ≈ 56.4873 * 2 = 112.9746; 56.4873 * 0.174 ≈ ~9.828

So total ≈ 112.9746 +9.828 ≈ 122.8026

So 1694.619 + 122.8026 ≈ 1817.4216

So 32.174 * 56.4873 ≈ 1817.42 lbm/(s²·ft³) ?

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units. Let me proceed numerically.

Now, multiply by ρ_l (56.53):

1817.42 * 56.53 ≈ Let's compute 1800 *56 = 100800, 1800 *0.53=954, so 100800 +954=101754. Then 17.42 *56.53≈17 *56=952, 0.42*56≈23.52, 17 *0.53≈9.01, 0.42*0.53≈0.2226. So approx 952+23.52=975.52 +9.01=984.53 +0.2226≈984.75. So total ≈101754 + 984.75≈102,738.75

So 1817.42 *56.53 ≈ 1.027e5

Now, multiply by h_fg (970.3):

1.027e5 * 970.3 ≈ approx 1e5 *970 = 9.7e7, but more accurately:

1.027e5 = 102700

102700 * 970.3 = Let's compute 102700 * 900 = 92,430,000

102700 *70.3 = 102700 *70 = 7,189,000 and 102700 *0.3=30,810 → total 7,219,810

So total ≈ 92,430,000 + 7,219,810 = 99,649,810 ≈ 9.965e7

Now multiply by k_l (0.345):

9.965e7 * 0.345 ≈ 34,409,725 (since 9.965e7 *0.3=29,895,000 and 9.965e7*0.045≈4,486,  so total ≈29,895,000 +4,486,  so about 34,381, 000. Let's say ≈3.438e8.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused with the exact numbers. Let me note that each step is getting complicated, and perhaps I should use a calculator approach, but since I'm doing it manually, I'll proceed.

Now, the denominator is D * ν_l * ΔT

D = 0.1667 ft

ν_l = 3.375e-6 ft²/hr

ΔT =20.21 °F

So denominator: 0.1667 * 3.375e-6 *20.21

Compute 0.1667 *3.375e-6 = approx (0.1667 *3.375) *1e-6 → 0.5624 *1e-6 → 5.624e-7

Now multiply by 20.21 → 5.624e-7 *20.21 ≈ 1.137e-5

So denominator ≈ 1.137e-5 (units: ft * ft²/hr * °F → ft³/(hr·°F) )

Wait, no: D is ft, ν is ft²/hr, ΔT is °F.

So the denominator's units are (ft) * (ft²/hr) * (°F) ) → ft³/(hr·°F)

The numerator's units are (ft/s²) * (lbm/ft³) * (lbm/ft³) * (BTU/lbm) * (BTU/(hr·ft·°F)) )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me check:

g: ft/s²

(ρ_l - ρ_v): lbm/ft³

ρ_l: lbm/ft³

h_fg: BTU/lbm

k_l: BTU/(hr·ft·°F)

So numerator's units:

ft/s² * lbm/ft³ * lbm/ft³ * BTU/lbm * BTU/(hr·ft·°F)

Simplify:

(ft/(s²)) * (lbm^2)/(ft^6
