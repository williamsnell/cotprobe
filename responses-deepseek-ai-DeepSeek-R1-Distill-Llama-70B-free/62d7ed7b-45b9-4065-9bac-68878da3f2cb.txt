Question:

It was raining hard one evening as a cab driver was looking for one last passenger. A passenger flagged him down and directed him to take her home. The cab driver recognized the passenger as a former girlfriend, and the passenger invited him into her house when they arrived. Unknown to the cab driver, the passenger was an undercover police officer who worked in the sex crimes unit. When they were inside the passenger's house, the cab driver made sexual advances toward the passenger, who responded by kissing him and holding his hand. The cab driver was about to kiss the passenger again, when she got up to answer the phone in the kitchen. If the cab driver is subsequently arrested and charged with the attempted rape of the passenger, he should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit thecrime.
B: guilty, if he continued his advances after she got up.
C: not guilty.
D: guilty, based on the passenger's account.
E: not guilty, if he raises the proper alibi defense.
F: guilty, if his advances were unwelcome.
G: not guilty, if he can prove his intentions were not malicious.
H: guilty, if the passenger felt threatened.
I: not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.
J: not guilty, if he did not use force or threats.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding attempted rape. Let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is that a cab driver picks up a passenger who turns out to be an undercover police officer. They go to her house, and the cab driver makes sexual advances. She responds by kissing him and holding his hand. Then, when she goes to answer the phone, he's about to kiss her again. Now, he's charged with attempted rape.

Hmm, the question is asking whether he should be found guilty or not. The options are A through J, each with different conditions.

So, I remember that for a crime like attempted rape, the prosecution needs to prove both intent and a substantial step towards committing the crime. Entrapment is a defense where the government induces someone to commit a crime they wouldn't have otherwise committed.

Wait, in this case, the passenger is an undercover officer. She invited him into her house and kissed him, holding hands. So, she was participating in the advances. But then, she's an undercover cop. Does that mean she was just pretending to be interested to set him up?

Entrapment usually applies when the government's actions actually cause the person to commit the crime. But if the person was already predisposed, then it's not entrapment. So, if the cab driver was already going to make those advances regardless, then the undercover operation didn't induce him beyond his predisposition.

The cab driver made advances, but she responded positively. So, was he intending to rape her? Or was he just trying to have consensual sex? 

Attempted rape would require that he intended to have non-consensual sex. But in this scenario, she was kissing him and holding hands. So, maybe he thought it was consensual. 

Wait, but she's an undercover officer, so maybe she was just pretending to consent to set him up. But if she didn't make it clear that she was not consenting, then he might have believed it was consensual. 

But the issue is about entrapment. So, if the undercover officer induced him to make those advances, then it's entrapment. If he was predisposed, meaning he would have done it anyway, then it's not entrapment.

Looking at the options, option A says not guilty if he was predisposed. Option I says not guilty solely because of entrapment. 

Wait, but entrapment is a defense that the defendant was induced by the government to commit the crime. If he was predisposed, then the entrapment defense doesn't apply. So, the question is whether he can use entrapment as a defense.

But in this case, the cab driver was making advances, but she was responding positively. So, perhaps she didn't induce him to commit a crime beyond what he was already doing. Alternatively, maybe she did induce him by leading him on.

Wait, the question is about attempted rape. So, even if she consented to kissing, if he intended to have sex without her consent, that's attempted rape. But if he believed she consented, maybe he lacks the specific intent for rape.

But then again, she's an undercover officer. So, perhaps she was just pretending to consent to set him up for the arrest. So, from her perspective, she didn't actually consent. But from his perspective, he might have thought she did.

So, in terms of intent, for attempted rape, the defendant must have intended to have non-consensual sex. If he believed she was consenting, then he might not have that intent. But if she never consented, then perhaps he did have the intent.

Wait, but she's an undercover officer, so her actual consent isn't there, but she's pretending. So, from his point of view, he might think she's consenting. So, whether he had the intent to rape her without consent would depend on his belief. If he thought she was consenting, then he didn't have the intent to rape. 

So, perhaps he lacks the specific intent for attempted rape because he thought she was consenting. Alternatively, if he intended to force her even if she said no, that's different. But in this scenario, she was kissing him and holding hands, so he might have reasonably believed she was consenting. 

But wait, for attempted rape, the intent is to have sex without consent. So, if he intended to proceed even if she withdrew consent, then he has the intent. But in this case, she didn't withdraw consent yet. She just went to answer the phone. So, maybe he didn't have the intent yet.

Alternatively, maybe the act of making advances, even if she seemed to consent, could be enough if he intended to proceed without her consent. But I'm a bit confused here.

Looking back at the options. Option A says not guilty if he was predisposed. So, if he was already going to commit the crime, then entrapment isn't a defense. So, the predisposition makes entrapment not applicable, so he can't use that defense. But what's the basis for his guilt or innocence?

Alternatively, option J says not guilty if he didn't use force or threats. But attempted rape doesn't necessarily require force; it's about the intent. So, that might not be the right approach.

Option C says not guilty. So, perhaps because he didn't have the intent, or because of entrapment.

Wait, but the key point here is whether he was entrapped. If the undercover officer induced him to commit a crime he wasn't predisposed to commit, then he can claim entrapment. If he was predisposed, then no.

In the scenario, the cab driver recognized her as a former girlfriend and made advances. So, perhaps he was predisposed to make advances because he knew her before. So, the officer didn't induce him beyond his predisposition.

Thus, if he was predisposed, then entrapment isn't a valid defense. So, option A says not guilty if he was predisposed. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Because if he's predisposed, then he would have done it without the government's inducement, so he's guilty.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. The defense of entrapment is that the government made him commit the crime. If he was predisposed, then the defense doesn't apply, and he can be found guilty. So, the answer would depend on whether he was predisposed or not.

But the question is phrased as: "he should be found..." So, what's the correct outcome based on the law.

Wait, the question is about whether he's guilty of attempted rape. So, for that, he needs to have the specific intent to commit rape. If he thought she was consenting, then he lacks that intent. So, maybe he's not guilty.

Alternatively, if she was an undercover officer pretending to consent, does that mean he was trying to have sex with someone who didn't actually consent, making his intent to have non-consensual sex.

Wait, but in reality, she didn't consent because she's an officer, but he thought she did. So, in terms of mens rea, he thought she was consenting, so he didn't have the intent to rape. Therefore, he lacks the specific intent required for attempted rape.

So, in that case, he should be found not guilty. So, looking at the options, option C is "not guilty." Option J is about not using force or threats. But the issue is about intent, not force.

So, option C seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps option A is about predisposition, but I'm not sure how that affects the outcome.

Wait, another angle: the police conduct might constitute entrapment. If the officer induced him to make advances he wouldn't have otherwise made, then he can claim entrapment. But if he was already going to make those advances, then no.

In this case, since she invited him in and kissed him, perhaps he wasn't induced beyond his predisposition. So, no entrapment, meaning he can't use that defense. But does that mean he's guilty?

But if he thought she consented, then he didn't have the intent to rape. So, even without the entrapment defense, he might not be guilty because he lacked the specific intent.

So, perhaps the answer is C: not guilty.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A: not guilty if he was predisposed. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is whether he should be found guilty or not. The options are about the possible outcomes. So, the correct reasoning is that for attempted rape, the intent is crucial. If he thought she was consenting, he didn't have the intent to commit rape. So, he's not guilty.

Thus, option C says not guilty, which would be the correct answer.

The scenario involves a cab driver charged with attempted rape after making sexual advances toward an undercover police officer who responded positively by kissing him and holding his hand. The key legal issues are intent and entrapment. For attempted rape, the prosecution must prove the defendant had the specific intent to engage in non-consensual sex. Here, the cab driver may have believed the officer consented to the advances, as she kissed him and held his hand. This belief could negate the specific intent required for attempted rape, as he might not have intended to engage in non-consensual sex.

Entrapment is also considered, as the officer was undercover. Entrapment applies when the government induces someone to commit a crime they were not predisposed to commit. However, if the cab driver was predisposed to make advances (e.g., because he knew her as a former girlfriend), entrapment would not apply. Despite this, the lack of specific intent due to his belief in consent would still make him not guilty.

Among the options, **C: not guilty** is the correct answer because the cab driver likely lacked the intent to commit rape, believing the officer consented to the advances.

Answer: C
