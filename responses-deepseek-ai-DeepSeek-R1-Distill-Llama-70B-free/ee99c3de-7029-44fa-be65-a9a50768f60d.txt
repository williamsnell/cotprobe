Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about anxiety explanations, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down.

The question is asking for three contrasting explanations of anxiety. The options are A through J, each listing different theories or models. I remember that there are various psychological theories that explain anxiety in different ways. Let me think about each one.

First, I know that the psychoanalytic theory, which is Freudian, talks about anxiety being related to unconscious conflicts and repressed thoughts. Then there's the behavioral perspective, which might explain anxiety through classical conditioning, like how phobias develop from associations. Wait, but social learning theory is a bit different because it involves observing others and learning through observation and imitation. So, maybe social learning isn't exactly the same as behavioral conditioning.

Another approach is the cognitive theory, which focuses on thought processes. Like, how negative thoughts and beliefs contribute to anxiety. Then there's the biological perspective, which looks at genetics, brain chemistry, and neurotransmitters. Oh, and the fight or flight response is part of the biological reaction to stress, triggered by the sympathetic nervous system.

Wait, the question is about contrasting explanations. So the options should include theories from different major psychological perspectives. Let me look at the options:

Option A: Psychoanalytic, social learning, control theory. Control theory sounds like it's about how much control a person feels they have, maybe related to locus of control. That's a bit different from the others.

Option B: Cognitive dissonance, behavioral, diathesis-stress. Cognitive dissonance is more about conflicting thoughts, diathesis-stress is about vulnerability plus stressors leading to disorders. Not sure if these are the top three contrasting.

Option C: Psychoanalytic, stimulus-response (which is behavioral), and Maslow's hierarchy. Maslow is more about motivation and needs, not directly explaining anxiety.

Option D: Fight or flight (biological), psychoanalytic, control theory. That's three different angles: biological, psychological, and maybe social?

Option E: Attachment theory, psychodynamic, behavioral genetics. Hmm, attachment is more about relationships, psychodynamic is similar to psychoanalytic, and behavioral genetics looks at genetic influences. Not sure if these are the best examples of contrasting explanations.

Option F: Social learning, existential, biomedical. Existential is more philosophical, biomedical is biological. So that's three different areas.

Option G: Psychoanalytic neurotic anxiety, stimulus-response, control/helplessness. Stimulus-response is behavioral, control/helplessness might relate to learned helplessness theory, which is more cognitive-behavioral. So this includes psychoanalytic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects.

Option H: Cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, evolutionary. These are three different approaches but maybe not the most commonly cited ones for anxiety.

Option I: Evolutionary, biopsychosocial, fight or flight. Biopsychosocial is a model that integrates biological, psychological, and social factors. Fight or flight is biological. So this includes evolutionary (biological), and a broad model.

Option J: Biological, cognitive, existential. These are distinct perspectives.

Wait, the question is about three contrasting explanations. So I think the best options would include psychoanalytic, behavioral, and cognitive, maybe. Or perhaps biological, psychological, and social.

Looking back, the most commonly contrasted theories for anxiety would be psychoanalytic (Freud), behavioral (classical conditioning), and cognitive (thought processes). But wait, I'm not seeing an option that includes all three. Let me check.

Option G includes psychoanalytic, stimulus-response (behavioral), and control/helplessness (which is cognitive-behavioral). So that's three contrasting approaches.

Another thought: Control theory might relate to the sense of control someone has, which is a cognitive factor. Helplessness is part of learned helplessness theory from Seligman, which is a cognitive-behavioral model.

So option G has three different theories: psychoanalytic, behavioral, and cognitive. That makes sense as contrasting explanations.

Alternatively, option A has psychoanalytic, social learning, and control. Social learning is behavioral, and control is cognitive. So that's also three, but maybe not the most direct.

Wait, the question says "three contrasting explanations". So perhaps the best answer is G.

To address the question of three contrasting explanations of anxiety, it is important to identify theories that represent distinct psychological perspectives. Anxiety can be explained through various lenses, including psychological, behavioral, and cognitive approaches. 

Option G stands out as it includes the psychoanalytic theory, which attributes anxiety to unconscious conflicts; the stimulus-response explanation, which is rooted in behavioral conditioning; and concepts of control and helplessness, which align with cognitive-behavioral theories. These three approaches are well-established and provide contrasting viewpoints on the phenomenon of anxiety.

Answer: G
