Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the energy stored in an inductor. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the energy stored in an inductor is given by a specific formula. Wait, what was that formula again? Oh right, I think it's U = (1/2) * L * i², where U is the energy, L is the inductance, and i is the current.

But wait, the problem gives me phi(t) as a function of i(t). Oh, right, phi is the magnetic flux. And I remember that the flux linkage is phi = L * i. So if I have phi as a function of i, I can find L, right?

The given phi(t) is (1/3)i³(t), and i(t) is 2 sin t. So I can write phi = (1/3) i³. But wait, phi is also L times i, so L * i = (1/3) i³. Let me solve for L here. Dividing both sides by i (assuming i isn't zero), I get L = (1/3) i². Oh wait, that can't be right because L should be a constant, not dependent on i. Did I do something wrong?

Wait a second. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question says the phi-i characteristic is phi(t) = (1/3) i³(t). Oh, so phi as a function of i is (1/3)i³. Wait, but normally phi is L*i, which is a linear relationship. This phi is cubic in i, which suggests that the inductor is nonlinear. Oh, right! So this isn't an ideal inductor where phi is proportional to i. So in this case, I can't directly say L is constant. Hmm, so how do I find the energy then?

I recall that for a nonlinear inductor, the energy stored is the integral of i dphi from 0 to the final current. So U = ∫ i dphi, from i=0 to i=I, where I is the current at time t. Wait, but here we're looking from t=0 to t=1, so I need to find the energy stored as the current changes over that time.

Let me think. So I need to find the energy U as a function of time, but wait, no. Wait, the energy stored at any time t is the integral from 0 to i(t) of i' dphi(i'), where i' is a dummy variable. Since phi is given as a function of i, which is time-dependent, maybe I can express everything in terms of i.

Wait, phi(t) is given as (1/3) i(t)^3. So for a given i, phi(i) = (1/3) i^3.

So to find the energy U at time t, I need to integrate i' dphi(i') from 0 to i(t). Let's compute that.

dphi = (1/3)*3i'^2 di' = i'^2 di'. So the integral becomes ∫ (from 0 to i) i' * i'^2 di' = ∫ i'^3 di' from 0 to i.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait no, wait. Because the energy is U = ∫ i dphi. Since phi = (1/3)i^3, then dphi = i^2 di. So U would be ∫ (from 0 to i) i * (i^2 di) ) = ∫ i^3 di from 0 to i.

Wait, but that integral would be [i^4 /4 ] from 0 to i. So U = (i^4)/4.

But wait, let me double-check. Since U is the integral of i dphi. Phi is (1/3)i^3, so dphi = i^2 di. Then i dphi becomes i * i^2 di = i^3 di. So the integral is ∫ i^3 di, which is (i^4)/4 evaluated from 0 to i. So yes, U = (i^4)/4.

Wait, that seems right. So the energy at any time t is (i(t)^4)/4.

But wait, the question is asking for the energy stored from t=0 to t=1. So we need to compute U at t=1 minus U at t=0.

Wait, but at t=0, what's i(t)? i(t) = 2 sin(0) = 0. So U(0) is 0. So the energy stored by t=1 is just U(1) = (i(1)^4)/4.

What's i(1)? i(t)=2 sin t, so at t=1, i=2 sin(1). Let me compute that. But I don't have the exact value of sin(1), but perhaps I can keep it symbolic.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Did I make a mistake in calculating U?

Wait, let me make sure. Because phi(i) = (1/3)i^3, so dphi/di = i^2. The energy is the integral from 0 to i of i * (dphi/di) di = ∫ i * i^2 di = ∫ i^3 di. So yes, that's (i^4)/4.

So U(t) = (i(t)^4)/4.

But wait, the problem is about the energy stored from t=0 to t=1. So that's the change in energy, which is U(1) - U(0) = U(1) since U(0)=0.

So U(1) = [ (2 sin(1) )^4 ] /4.

Let me compute that. Let's compute (2)^4 = 16. So 16 (sin(1))^4 divided by 4. That simplifies to 4 (sin(1))^4.

Wait, wait, no. Because (2)^4 is 16, so 16 (sin^4(1)) /4 = 4 sin^4(1).

So U = 4 sin^4(1) Joules.

Wait, but let me think again. Because sin(1) is in radians. Let me compute sin(1). Wait, sin(1) is approximately 0.841470985. So sin(1)^4 is (0.84147)^4. Let's compute that.

Compute 0.84147^2 first: 0.84147 * 0.84147 ≈ 0.708073. Then square that: 0.708073^2 ≈ 0.501423. So 4 * 0.501423 ≈ 2.0057 J. So approximately 2.0057 J, which is about 2.01 J.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.00 J. So the answer must be I.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recompute.

i(1) = 2 sin(1). So i(1)^4 = (2)^4 (sin(1))^4 = 16 (sin(1))^4.

U = (i^4)/4 = (16 (sin(1))^4 ) /4 = 4 (sin(1))^4.

Compute 4*(sin(1))^4:

sin(1) ≈ 0.84147 → sin(1)^4 ≈ (0.84147)^2 squared again.

0.84147^2 = (approx) 0.84147 * 0.84147. Let me compute that.

0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64. 0.04 *0.8 = 0.032. 0.00147 *0.8 is about 0.001176.

Wait, perhaps a more accurate way. Let me compute 0.84147 × 0.84147.

Compute 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64.

0.8 * 0.04147 = 0.033176.

0.04147 × 0.8 = same as above, 0.033176.

0.04147 × 0.04147 ≈ approx 0.00172.

So adding all together: 0.64 + 0.033176 + 0.033176 + 0.00172 = 0.708072.

So (0.84147)^2 ≈ 0.708072.

Now, (0.708072)^2 is approximately 0.708072 * 0.708072.

Compute 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49.

0.7 * 0.008072 = 0.0056504.

0.008072 * 0.7 = same as above, 0.0056504.

0.008072 * 0.008072 ≈ approx 0.0000652.

Adding them up: 0.49 + 0.0056504 + 0.0056504 + 0.0000652 ≈ 0.501365.

So (sin(1))^4 ≈ 0.501365.

Multiply by 4: 4 * 0.501365 ≈ 2.00546 J. So approximately 2.005 J.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.00 J. So the correct answer would be I.

To find the energy stored in the inductor from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \), we use the relationship for the energy stored in a nonlinear inductor:

\[
U = \int_0^{i(t)} i \, d\phi
\]

Here, the magnetic flux is given as \( \phi(t) = \frac{1}{3}i^3(t) \), and the current is \( i(t) = 2 \sin t \). From \( \phi(i) = \frac{1}{3}i^3 \), we compute \( d\phi = i^2 \, di \). Substituting into the energy formula:

\[
U = \int_0^{i} i \cdot i^2 \, di = \int_0^{i} i^3 \, di
\]

The integral evaluates to:

\[
U = \left[ \frac{i^4}{4} \right]_0^i = \frac{i^4}{4}
\]

At \( t = 1 \), the current is \( i(1) = 2 \sin(1) \). Substituting this into the energy expression:

\[
U(1) = \frac{(2 \sin(1))^4}{4} = \frac{16 (\sin(1))^4}{4} = 4 (\sin(1))^4
\]

Using \( \sin(1) \approx 0.84147 \), we calculate \( (\sin(1))^4 \approx 0.501423 \). Thus:

\[
U(1) = 4 \cdot 0.501423 \approx 2.0057 \, \text{J}
\]

Since the energy at \( t = 0 \) is \( U(0) = 0 \), the total energy stored from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \) is approximately \( 2.01 \, \text{J} \). Comparing this to the options, the closest match is:

**I: 2.00 J**
