Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the number of lamps needed to light a room. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my lighting calculations, but let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that each lamp has 300 lumens, and we need an average illuminance of 50 lux in a rectangular room that's 4 meters by 3 meters. The options are from A to J, with various numbers. I need to find out how many lamps are required.

First, I remember that illuminance is measured in lux, and it's related to lumens and the area. Oh right, the formula for illuminance (E) is E = Φ / A, where Φ is the luminous flux in lumens and A is the area in square meters. Wait, but wait—sometimes I get confused whether it's total lumens or per lamp. Oh right, Φ here would be the total lumens from all the lamps.

So, the room is 4m by 3m. Let me calculate the area first. Area A = length * width, so 4 * 3 = 12 square meters.

The desired illuminance is 50 lux. So, E = 50 lux = total lumens / area. Rearranging the formula, total lumens (Φ) equals E multiplied by A. So Φ = 50 * 12. Let me do that math: 50 times 12 is 600. So, we need 600 lumens in total.

Each lamp is 300 lumens. So the number of lamps needed would be the total lumens divided by the lumens per lamp. That would be 600 / 300 = 2. So two lamps.

Wait, but wait a second. Are there any factors I'm missing here? Like, do lamps usually have some efficiency or is there a utilization factor? Or maybe the formula is different? Hmm, I think the basic formula is correct. Because if each lamp gives 300 lumens, then two would give 600, which divided by 12m² gives 50 lux.

So looking at the options, option C is 2. So the answer should be C.

To determine the number of lamps required, we start by calculating the area of the rectangular room:

\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 4 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m} = 12 \, \text{m}^2
\]

The desired illuminance is 50 lux. Using the formula for illuminance:

\[
E = \frac{\Phi}{A}
\]

where \( \Phi \) is the total luminous flux in lumens, we rearrange to find:

\[
\Phi = E \times A = 50 \, \text{lux} \times 12 \, \text{m}^2 = 600 \, \text{lumens}
\]

Each lamp provides 300 lumens, so the number of lamps required is:

\[
\text{Number of lamps} = \frac{\Phi}{\text{lumens per lamp}} = \frac{600}{300} = 2
\]

Thus, the number of lamps needed is 2. The correct answer is:

C: 2
