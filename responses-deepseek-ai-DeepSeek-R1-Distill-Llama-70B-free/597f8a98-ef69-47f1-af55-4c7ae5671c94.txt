Question:

A riot broke out in a city, and many shops had been looted and some had been burned during the riots. Goods of all kinds were in piles or strewn about the sidewalk. During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should

Options:

A: affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.
B: affirm the conviction because the defendant was provided with an attorney, but reverse the reimbursement order.
C: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was not properly informed of his rights.
D: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not informed of the consequences of waiving his right to a jury trial, but affirm the reimbursement order.
E: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement order.
F: affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.
G: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.
H: reverse the reimbursement order because it exceeds the maximum fine for grand larceny, but affirm the conviction.
I: affirm the reimbursement order, but not the conviction.
J: reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the situation is about a defendant who was involved in a riot. He took a portable TV from the sidewalk and tried to walk away quickly. A police officer arrested him. He's charged with grand larceny, which is a felony with a max penalty of seven months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 

At his arraignment, the judge told him about his right to have a counsel appointed. But the defendant said he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge questioned him a lot about this decision. The defendant had no legal experience and didn't trust lawyers, so he didn't want an appointed attorney. The judge didn't find his reasons persuasive and appointed an attorney anyway. Later, the attorney told the court the defendant wanted a non-jury trial, but the prosecution requested a jury, so the court impaneled one. The defendant was convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months. Also, he was ordered to reimburse the state $450 for his attorney's costs under a statute. He appeals both the conviction and this order.

The question is what the appellate court should do. The options are A through J, each with different outcomes.

Hmm. Let me break this down into parts.

First, I think about the right to self-representation. I remember that the Supreme Court case Faretta v. California (1975) established that a defendant has the right to represent himself, but the waiver must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. So the judge needs to make sure the defendant understands what he's giving up. In this case, the defendant told the judge he had no legal experience and didn't trust lawyers. The judge questioned him but didn't find his reasons persuasive and denied his request. So the issue is whether the judge correctly denied the defendant's waiver.

I think the key here is whether the defendant's waiver was knowing and intelligent. The judge has discretion, but if the defendant is competent and makes a clear waiver, the court must allow it. Here, the defendant was indigent, but that doesn't necessarily affect his right to self-representation. The fact that he had no legal experience is a concern, but the court can't force an attorney on him if he knowingly waives it. So perhaps the judge erred in appointing an attorney despite the defendant's waiver.

If the defendant was wrongly denied the right to represent himself, that's a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. So the conviction might need to be reversed because of this error. 

Next, regarding the jury trial. The defendant initially wanted to waive a jury trial, but later, through his attorney, he again wanted a non-jury trial. But the prosecution requested a jury, and the court impaneled one. I think in criminal cases, the right to a jury trial can be waived, but both the defendant and the prosecution must agree, or it's up to the court? Wait, no. The right to a jury trial is the defendant's right. The prosecution doesn't have a say in it. So if the defendant wants to waive a jury trial, the court can accept that, but if the defendant changes his mind, he can demand a jury. Wait, but here, the defendant initially wanted to waive the jury, but the judge appointed an attorney who then said the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. The prosecution wanted a jury, so the court allowed it. 

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Once a defendant waives a jury trial, can he later change his mind? I think the Federal Rules allow a defendant to revoke a waiver of jury trial in certain circumstances, but the court has discretion. Alternatively, if the defendant didn't properly waive it in the first place, maybe the court can't deny a jury. But in this case, the defendant initially wanted to waive the jury, but the court didn't accept his waiver because it denied his self-representation. Hmm, perhaps this part is more about the initial waiver.

Wait, but the main issue is that the defendant wasn't allowed to represent himself, which might have led to the court ignoring his waiver of the jury. So if the court erred in denying his right to self-representation, then the subsequent trial with a jury might be tainted because the defendant didn't get to make that choice. Or perhaps the jury trial itself wasn't the issue because the defendant had initially agreed to it. I'm a bit confused here.

Now, the second issue is the reimbursement order. The defendant was ordered to pay $450 for the cost of his attorney. The statute allowed this. I'm trying to remember about whether states can require defendants to reimburse the costs of appointed counsel. I think it's possible, but there are due process considerations. For example, in Fuller v. Oregon (1974), the Supreme Court held that a state can require reimbursement if the defendant has the means, but it can't impose it as a flat fee without considering the defendant's ability to pay. So if the defendant is indigent, can the state still order reimbursement? Wait, in this case, the defendant is indigent, as he was eligible for a court-appointed attorney. So requiring him to pay might be problematic if he can't afford it. But the question states that the order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of arrest. So perhaps the statute allows for reimbursement regardless of ability to pay, which might be unconstitutional.

Wait, but in some states, the law allows for reimbursement even from indigent defendants, but the collection is based on their future ability to pay. So if the statute is constitutional, then the order stands. But if the statute doesn't allow for the defendant's ability to pay to be considered, then the order might be improper.

So, the two main issues are: (1) the denial of the right to self-representation, and (2) the constitutionality of the reimbursement order.

If the judge erred in denying the defendant's right to self-representation, that would require reversal of the conviction. As for the reimbursement, if the statute is unconstitutional as applied (because the defendant is indigent and perhaps unable to pay), then that order should be reversed too.

Looking at the options:

Option E says reverse the conviction because the defendant was not allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement order. So this would be if the first issue is bad, but the reimbursement is okay.

Option G says reverse both because he was denied self-representation. So if both issues are tied to that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reimbursement order might be a separate issue. Let me think. The right to counsel and reimbursement are separate. Even if the defendant was wrongly denied self-representation, that doesn't directly affect the reimbursement order unless the appointment of counsel was improper. But the court appointed counsel against his will, so perhaps the order to reimburse is invalid because he was forced to have an attorney he didn't want. But I'm not sure if that's the case. The right to reimbursement is based on the statute, which likely applies whenever counsel is appointed, regardless of the defendant's preference.

Alternatively, the issue with the reimbursement is whether the defendant can be forced to pay if he's indigent, regardless of the self-representation issue. So perhaps the reimbursement order is valid only if the statute properly considers his ability to pay.

In the question, it's stated that the defendant is indigent, so if the statute allows for reimbursement without considering ability to pay, the order would be unconstitutional. But if the statute includes provisions to determine ability, then it's okay. The question doesn't specify, but since the defendant is indigent, the order might be improper if the statute doesn't allow for ability to pay.

Wait, but the question says the order was made "pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest." So if the statute is valid, the order is okay. But I think the Supreme Court in Fuller v. Oregon allowed for such reimbursement as long as the defendant is able to pay. So a statute that requires reimbursement without considering ability might be unconstitutional. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reimbursement is a separate issue from the trial. Even if the conviction is reversed, the reimbursement order might still stand if the statute is valid. Or it could be that since the defendant was forced to have an attorney, the state can't make him pay for it because he didn't want it. But I'm not sure about that.

Putting it all together: The defendant was denied his right to self-representation, which requires reversal of the conviction. The reimbursement order's validity depends on whether the statute improperly ignores the defendant's ability to pay. If the statute is invalid, both are reversed. If the statute is okay, only the conviction is reversed.

Looking at the options, option E is to reverse the conviction but affirm the reimbursement. Option G is to reverse both. Option H says reverse the reimbursement because it exceeds the maximum fine. Wait, the maximum fine is $1,000, and the reimbursement is $450, which is less. So H's reasoning is about the amount, but I don't think that's the issue; it's more about whether he can be forced to pay at all, not the amount.

So, if the right to self-representation was violated, the conviction must be reversed. As for the reimbursement, if the statute allows it regardless of ability, it's unconstitutional, so that should be reversed too. But if the statute is proper, then it's okay.

Wait, but the defendant was ordered to pay $450. The question doesn't say whether he can afford it, just that he's indigent. So maybe the issue is that the state can't impose reimbursement on an indigent defendant without considering ability to pay. So the reimbursement order is invalid.

So, both the conviction and the reimbursement order should be reversed.

Looking at the options, option G says reverse both because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself. But wait, option G's reasoning is about self-representation, but the reimbursement might be a separate issue. Alternatively, option C says reverse both because he wasn't properly informed of his rights. But the question doesn't indicate that he wasn't informed; the judge advised him of his right to counsel. The problem was that he waived it, and the judge didn't accept his waiver.

So the main issue is the denial of the right to self-representation, which affects the conviction. The reimbursement order's validity is a separate issue, possibly invalid if the statute doesn't consider ability to pay.

Wait, but the question doesn't state whether the statute requires the court to consider the defendant's ability to pay. So if the statute is facially valid, but as applied, it's being used incorrectly, then the order would be reversed. But without knowing, I think the default is that the statute is valid unless it's shown otherwise. So perhaps the reimbursement order is affirmed.

Wait, no. The defendant is indigent, so requiring him to pay without considering his ability would be a problem. So the reimbursement order is invalid, and both should be reversed.

Looking at the options, option G says reverse both because he was denied the right to represent himself. But perhaps the reimbursement is a separate issue. Alternatively, option C says reverse both because he wasn't informed of his rights. But he was informed; he just didn't take the advice.

Wait, perhaps the reimbursement is okay if the statute allows it, even if he's indigent, depending on the law. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: The right to self-representation was denied, so the conviction is reversed. The reimbursement order's validity is a separate issue. If the statute allows it, then it's affirmed. So option E would be correct: reverse conviction, affirm reimbursement.

But wait, in some cases, when a defendant is forced to have counsel, can they be made to pay for it? I think so, as long as the statute is constitutional. So the reimbursement might stand.

So, the appellate court should reverse the conviction because the defendant's right to self-representation was denied, but affirm the reimbursement order if the statute is valid. So looking at the options, option E says reverse the conviction because he was not allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement.

Wait, but I thought the reimbursement order might be invalid because the defendant is indigent. But perhaps the statute allows for reimbursement only if the defendant is able, so if he's indigent, the order is invalid. But the question doesn't specify the statute's details. So without knowing, I have to assume the statute is valid, so the reimbursement is okay.

So the correct option would be E: reverse the conviction because he was denied self-representation, but affirm the reimbursement.

Wait, but option E says affirm the reimbursement order. So that would be the choice.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The two issues are:

1. Denial of right to self-representation: This requires reversal of the conviction.

2. Reimbursement order: If the statute violates due process by not considering ability to pay, then it's reversed. If it's a valid statute, it's affirmed.

Since the question says the defendant is indigent and the statute was in effect at the time, but without more info on the statute, perhaps we can assume it's valid. So the reimbursement is affirmed.

Thus, the answer would be E.
</think>

The question involves a defendant who was charged with grand larceny after taking a portable television during a riot. At his arraignment, the defendant waived his right to counsel and requested to represent himself, but the judge denied this request and appointed an attorney. The defendant was later convicted by a jury and sentenced to six months in prison. Additionally, he was ordered to reimburse the state $450 for the cost of his appointed attorney. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order.

### Key Issues:
1. **Right to Self-Representation**:  
   Under *Faretta v. California (1975)*, a defendant has the right to represent themselves if the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Here, the defendant clearly expressed his desire to represent himself and waived his right to counsel. Although the judge questioned him, the judge ultimately denied his request, which constitutes a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation. This error requires reversal of the conviction.

2. **Reimbursement Order**:  
   The defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 for the cost of appointed counsel. While states can require reimbursement for appointed counsel under certain statutes, such orders must consider the defendant's ability to pay. In *Fuller v. Oregon (1974)*, the Supreme Court held that reimbursement cannot be imposed without regard for the defendant's financial situation. Since the defendant is described as indigent, the reimbursement order may be invalid if the statute does not account for his inability to pay. However, the question does not specify whether the statute includes such provisions. Assuming the statute is valid and constitutional, the reimbursement order would stand.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Affirms both the conviction and the reimbursement order. This is incorrect because the denial of the defendant's right to self-representation requires reversal of the conviction.  
- **Option B**: Affirms the conviction but reverses the reimbursement order. This is incorrect because the conviction must be reversed due to the violation of the defendant's right to self-representation.  
- **Option C**: Reverses both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was not properly informed of his rights. This is incorrect because the defendant was informed of his rights; the issue is that his waiver of counsel was not honored.  
- **Option D**: Reverses the conviction because the defendant was not informed of the consequences of waiving his right to a jury trial but affirms the reimbursement order. This is incorrect because the defendant's waiver of counsel, not his waiver of a jury trial, is the central issue.  
- **Option E**: Reverses the conviction because the defendant was not allowed to represent himself but affirms the reimbursement order. This is correct because the denial of self-representation requires reversal of the conviction, and the reimbursement order is assumed valid if the statute is constitutional.  
- **Option F**: Affirms the conviction but not the reimbursement order. This is incorrect because the conviction must be reversed due to the denial of self-representation.  
- **Option G**: Reverses both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself. This is incorrect because the reimbursement order is a separate issue and may still be valid if the statute is constitutional.  
- **Option H**: Reverses the reimbursement order because it exceeds the maximum fine for grand larceny but affirms the conviction. This is incorrect because the reimbursement order does not exceed the maximum fine, and the conviction must be reversed due to the denial of self-representation.  
- **Option I**: Affirms the reimbursement order but not the conviction. This is incorrect because the conviction must be reversed, and the reimbursement order may still be valid.  
- **Option J**: Reverses the conviction because the defendant was denied the right to a non-jury trial but affirms the reimbursement order. This is incorrect because the defendant initially waived his right to a jury trial, and the central issue is the denial of self-representation.

### Conclusion:
The appellate court should reverse the conviction because the defendant's right to self-representation was violated. The reimbursement order should be affirmed if the statute is constitutional and considers the defendant's ability to pay. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E**
