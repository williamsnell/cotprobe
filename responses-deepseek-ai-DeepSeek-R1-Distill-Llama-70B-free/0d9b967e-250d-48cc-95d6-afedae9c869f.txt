Question:

A man works at a tire warehouse, where his job duties consist of loading tires onto trucks. The job is exhausting, and the warehouse is always short of personnel. One day, while loading a heavy tractor tire onto a truck by himself, he experienced a sharp and excruciating pain in his lower back. He did not report the incident to his employer, but continued to work. A week later, after work, he went to the doctor for treatment. The man then sues his employer, alleging that the employer failed to provide him with adequate assistance, safety equipment, and training to load heavy tractor tires, thereby contributing to his injury. The employer alleges that the man is merely trying to obtain compensation for an old back injury, unrelated to his employment. At trial, the man's doctor testified that the man told her that his back began hurting while he was loading the tire on the truck. The doctor's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis.
B: admissible as a statement made in the course of treatment.
C: inadmissible as a violation of the physicianpatient privilege.
D: admissible as it is a statement of fact.
E: admissible as expert testimony.
F: admissible as it is a statement made in anticipation of litigation.
G: inadmissible as it is a speculative statement.
H: inadmissible as it is a biased statement.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: inadmissible as it is a self-serving statement.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a man who works at a tire warehouse. His job is loading tires onto trucks, which sounds physically demanding. The warehouse is short-staffed, so he's probably doing a lot of heavy lifting without much help. One day, while loading a heavy tractor tire by himself, he feels a sharp, excruciating pain in his lower back. Instead of reporting it, he continues working. A week later, he goes to the doctor after work and then sues his employer. The employer is arguing that the injury is from an old back problem unrelated to work.

At the trial, the man's doctor testifies that he told her his back started hurting while loading the tire. The question is about the admissibility of the doctor's testimony.

I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the doctor is testifying about what the patient said. That's hearsay unless there's an exception.

I think the main exception here would be the medical diagnosis or treatment exception. Statements made to a doctor for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment are admissible because they're considered reliableâ€”patients typically tell the truth when seeking medical help.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's admissible as a statement for medical diagnosis. That sounds right because the patient was explaining his symptoms to the doctor.

Option B says it's admissible in the course of treatment. That's similar to A but maybe refers to a different exception. I think the exception under the Federal Rules is for statements made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.

Wait, in the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803(4) covers statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment. So, the statement would fall under this exception.

Option C says it's inadmissible because of physician-patient privilege. But in this case, the patient is the one offering the statement through his own doctor. The patient can waive the privilege by bringing the lawsuit and presenting the doctor's testimony, so the privilege wouldn't apply here.

Option D says it's a statement of fact. That's too vague. All testimonial statements are statements of fact, but that doesn't address the hearsay issue.

Option E is expert testimony. The doctor's testimony here isn't expert testimony unless she's giving an opinion based on the statement. But the question is about the admissibility of the statement itself, not her opinion.

Option F says anticipation of litigation. That's another exception where statements made in anticipation are admissible, but I don't think that applies here because the statement was made during treatment, not specifically for litigation.

Option G says it's speculative. The statement is about when the pain started, which is a fact, so not speculative.

Option H is bias. The patient's statement to the doctor isn't necessarily biased just because he's suing; it's about the context of treatment.

Option I says it's inadmissible hearsay without exception. But we've already considered that there's an exception under 803(4), so I shouldn't choose this.

Option J says it's self-serving. While the statement might be self-serving in a lawsuit, that doesn't make it inadmissible. Hearsay exceptions don't exclude statements just because they're self-serving.

So, the correct answer should be either A or B. Wait, what's the exact wording of the exceptions?

Rule 803(4) says statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment and described or furnished to a physician. So, the statement fits there, making option A correct. Option B says "in the course of treatment," which is a bit broader, but I think A is more precise.

Wait, the exception applies to statements made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. So the doctor's testimony about what the patient said is admissible under this exception.

So the answer should be A: admissible as a statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by a patient to their doctor, which the doctor later testifies to in court. The statement is that the man's back pain began while loading a tire at work. This is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, hearsay is admissible if it falls under a recognized exception.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4), statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. In this case, the man's statement to the doctor about the onset of his back pain was made during treatment and for the purpose of diagnosis, making it admissible under this exception.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The statement is admissible as it falls under the exception for statements made for medical diagnosis.
- **B**: While similar, this option is less precise. The admissibility is specifically due to the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, not just the course of treatment.
- **C**: Incorrect. Physician-patient privilege does not apply here because the patient waived it by bringing the lawsuit and presenting the doctor's testimony.
- **D**: Too vague and does not address the hearsay exception.
- **E**: Incorrect. The testimony here is not expert testimony but rather factual testimony about the patient's statement.
- **F**: Incorrect. The statement was made for treatment, not in anticipation of litigation.
- **G**: Incorrect. The statement is factual, not speculative.
- **H**: Incorrect. The statement's admissibility is not affected by potential bias.
- **I**: Incorrect. The statement is admissible under the medical diagnosis exception.
- **J**: Incorrect. A statement being self-serving does not make it inadmissible.

The best answer is **A**, as the statement is admissible under the medical diagnosis exception.

A
