Question:

In 1993, a rancher had good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who if anyone was using it. In any case, the grower did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. This jurisdiction uses Grantor Grantee Indices and has no Tract Index. In 2008, what is the present state of title to the orange grove if the jurisdiction's recording act provides: "Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute"?

Options:

A: In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
B: In a race notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.
C: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the farmer, having recorded his deed first, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
D: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the grower, being the last to record, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
E: In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.
F: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the son would acquire record title to the orange grove, because he is the original grantee.
G: In a race jurisdiction, the buyer, having recorded his deed before the grower, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
H: In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree, despite not recording his deed, would acquire equitable title to the orange grove due to his payment and receipt of the deed.
I: In a notice jurisdiction, the rancher retains record title to the orange grove, as he never properly conveyed his title.

Okay, so I've got this real property question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me try to break down the facts and see which option is correct.

The setup is about a rancher who owns a 20-acre orange grove. He had a fee simple absolute, so he owned it outright. In 1994, he sold it to his son for $1,000. The son got a deed but didn't record it. Then, in 1998, a farmer approaches the rancher, knowing about the rancher-to-son deed. The farmer buys the same property for $10,000, gets a deed, and records it promptly. His intent was to get color of title and maybe adverse possession. He built a fence that year.

In 1999, the son sells the property to a retiree for $15,000. The retiree doesn't do any title search or record the deed. Then, in 2003, the farmer sells to a buyer for $20,000. The buyer examines the property, searches the title, and doesn't know about the rancher-to-son deed. The buyer records his deed. In 2007, the retiree sells to an orange grower for $25,000. The grower saw the fence but didn't search the title.

The question is about the state of title in 2008, in a jurisdiction with a recording act that says a conveyance is invalid against anyone except the grantor, heirs, or assigns, unless recorded. So it's a notice jurisdiction because it protects subsequent purchasers who have no actual notice.

Wait, no, wait. The recording act here is: "Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute." Hmm. So if a conveyance isn't recorded, it's invalid against anyone except those with actual notice. So this is a notice jurisdiction because subsequent purchasers without notice are protected.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The types of recording acts are race, notice, and race-notice. In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance will prevail. So if someone buys without knowledge, they get the better title.

So let's track the chain of title.

1. Rancher (original owner) conveys to Son in 1994. Deed is delivered but not recorded. So Son has the deed but hasn't recorded.

2. Farmer approaches Rancher in 1998, knowing about the Son's deed. He buys from Rancher for $10k and records the deed. So Farmer's deed is recorded. But Farmer had actual knowledge of Son's prior deed. So Farmer's deed is recorded, but does that help him?

Wait, in a notice jurisdiction, subsequent purchasers are protected if they have no notice. But the Farmer had actual knowledge, so he can't claim protection under the recording act. So when Farmer records, his deed is on record. But because he had knowledge, any subsequent purchaser without notice would take priority over Farmer.

Wait, but Farmer's deed is recorded. So if someone else comes along and searches the records, they would find Farmer's deed, right? But wait, the Son's deed was never recorded, so the chain of title starting from Rancher would only show Farmer's deed if someone checks.

Wait, but the recording act in this case says that an unrecorded conveyance is invalid against anyone except those with actual notice. So when the Farmer records his deed, it's valid against future purchasers unless they have actual notice.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Farmer's deed is from Rancher. But Son had a prior unrecorded deed. So when Farmer records, the question is whether Farmer's recorded deed would take priority over Son's unrecorded deed.

But in a notice jurisdiction, the subsequent purchaser without notice of prior conveyances would take free of earlier unrecorded interests. So in this case, the Farmer had actual notice of the Son's deed. So when the Farmer records, his deed is on record, but because he had notice, he can't prevail against the Son's earlier conveyance.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the Son never recorded. So when the Farmer records, his deed is on record. The recording act says that any conveyance not recorded is invalid against someone who doesn't have actual notice. So if someone comes after Farmer and buys without notice, they would take free of Son's interest. But Farmer himself had notice, so his deed is subject to Son's prior claim.

Wait, but Farmer's deed is recorded. So when Farmer records, his conveyance is valid against others except those with actual notice. But since the Farmer had actual notice, does that affect his rights against the Son? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me try to outline each transfer:

- 1994: Rancher conveys to Son. Son doesn't record. So Son's deed is unrecorded.

- 1998: Rancher conveys to Farmer. Farmer knows about Son's deed. Farmer records. So Farmer's deed is recorded, but he had actual knowledge.

- 1999: Son conveys to Retiree. Retiree doesn't record. Retiree's deed is unrecorded.

- 2003: Farmer conveys to Buyer. Buyer examines the property, searches the title, doesn't know about the Son's deed. Buyer records.

- 2007: Retiree conveys to Grower. Grower saw the fence but didn't search title. So Grower's deed is unrecorded until when?

Wait, the question says that in 2007, the Retiree signs and delivers the deed to Grower, but Grower doesn't search the title. So Grower's deed is from Retiree, who had an unrecorded deed from Son.

So now, the question is about who has the better claim in 2008.

Let me consider each party's rights.

First, the initial conveyance to Son in 1994. Since it's unrecorded, it's invalid against a subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) without notice. But Farmer had notice, so Farmer's deed doesn't take priority over Son's.

Farmer's deed is recorded, but because Farmer had notice, his interest is junior to Son's.

Then, in 1999, Son conveys to Retiree. Retiree's deed is unrecorded. So Retiree's interest is subject to anyone who is a BFP without notice.

In 2003, Farmer conveys to Buyer. Buyer searched the title, but what's in the records? Farmer's deed is recorded. Since Son's deed wasn't recorded, Buyer's search would show Farmer's deed as the most recent. So Buyer has no actual knowledge of Son's deed. So Buyer, as a BFP, takes free of Son's interest because Son's deed was unrecorded. So Buyer's deed is valid against Son's.

Wait, but Farmer's deed was from Rancher, but Rancher had already conveyed to Son. So when Farmer buys, he has notice, so his deed is junior to Son's. But when Farmer sells to Buyer, Buyer doesn't know about Son's deed. So in a notice jurisdiction, Buyer would take priority over Son because Buyer has no notice.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again: In a notice jurisdiction, the subsequent purchaser without notice of prior conveyances takes free of those prior unrecorded conveyances.

So the chain is:

Rancher → Son (unrecorded) → Retiree (unrecorded)

Rancher → Farmer (recorded, but Farmer had notice) → Buyer (recorded, no notice)

So when Farmer sells to Buyer in 2003, Buyer, as a BFP without notice, would take priority over Son's interest because Son's deed was unrecorded. So Buyer's deed is valid against Son, even though Farmer had notice.

Wait, but Farmer's conveyance to Buyer is a new conveyance. So Farmer's interest was junior to Son's, so when Farmer sells to Buyer, what does Buyer get? If Farmer didn't have good title because his interest was junior to Son's, then Buyer gets nothing. Or does Buyer's status as a BFP without notice allow him to take priority?

Wait, no. Because the Farmer's deed was recorded, but Farmer had notice. So when Buyer comes along, he's searching the records and finds Farmer's deed. So he would think Farmer is the rightful owner. But since Farmer's interest was subject to Son's, because Farmer had notice, Farmer didn't have good title. So when Farmer conveys to Buyer, Buyer gets whatever Farmer had. But if Farmer had no title because Son's was prior, then Buyer gets nothing. But that can't be right because in a notice jurisdiction, a BFP without notice can take priority over prior unrecorded interests.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me try to clarify:

In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent BFP without notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance will take free of that prior conveyance.

So the initial conveyance to Son is unrecorded.

Farmer had notice and bought from Rancher, then recorded. So Farmer's deed is recorded, but he had notice, so his interest is junior to Son's.

But when Farmer sells to Buyer, who has no notice and who records, what's the situation?

Buyer is a BFP because he paid value, had no notice, and promptly recorded.

So when Buyer buys from Farmer, he would take free of Son's unrecorded conveyance because Son's was unrecorded, and Buyer had no notice.

Wait, but Farmer's interest was junior to Son's, so how can Farmer convey good title to Buyer?

Ah, perhaps because Farmer's deed was recorded, and when Buyer, as a BFP, buys from Farmer, he takes priority over Son's unrecorded interest. So Son's interest is extinguished as against Buyer.

So in this case, Buyer's deed would be valid, and he would own the property, because he's a BFP without notice.

Then, in 2007, Retiree conveys to Grower. Retiree had a deed from Son, but that was unrecorded. When Retiree sells to Grower, Grower doesn't search the title and sees the fence but doesn't know who built it. So Grower's deed is from Retiree, but Retiree's deed was unrecorded. So Grower's interest would be subject to anyone with a better claim, like Buyer.

So putting it all together, the current state is that Buyer has the best claim. Because when Buyer bought from Farmer, he was a BFP without notice, so his interest takes priority over Son's unrecorded deed. Therefore, the title is with Buyer.

Wait, but let me check the options. Let's look at the options:

Option A: In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent BFP, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and would acquire record title.

But Grower didn't search the title, so he might not be a BFP.

Option B: Race-notice: Farmer gets equitable title because he erected the fence and didn't inform Buyer. But the jurisdiction is notice, not race-notice.

Option C: Race-notice: Farmer recorded first, so he gets title. But it's a notice jurisdiction, not race-notice.

Option D: Race-notice: Grower last to record gets title. Again, wrong jurisdiction.

Option E: Notice: Retiree gets title without recording. No, because Retiree's deed was unrecorded, and someone else (Buyer) is a BFP.

Option F: Race-notice: Son gets title as original grantee. But in notice, subsequent BFPs can take over.

Option G: Race: Buyer recorded before Grower, so gets title. But it's notice, not race.

Option H: Notice: Retiree, despite not recording, gets equitable title. But Retiree's interest is behind Son's, and when Buyer comes in as BFP, he takes over.

Option I: Notice: Rancher retains title. No, because the Son's conveyance, though unrecorded, would still be valid against those with notice.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The correct answer is probably that Buyer has the best title because he's a BFP without notice, so he takes free of Son's unrecorded conveyance.

Looking back at the options, let's see which ones fit.

Option A says Grower is a subsequent BFP and acquires record title. But Grower didn't search the title and might have had inquiry notice because of the fence. Or maybe not. But in any case, Buyer already acquired title before Grower.

Option I says Rancher retains title, which can't be right because the conveyances have moved the title along.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The key points are:

- Son's deed (1994) is unrecorded. So against a BFP without notice, it's invalid.

- Farmer had notice, so his interest is junior to Son's.

- When Farmer sells to Buyer (2003), Buyer is a BFP without notice, so he takes free of Son's interest.

Thus, Buyer's interest is valid, and he records.

Then, Retiree sells to Grower (2007). Retiree's deed from Son was unrecorded, so when Grower buys, if Grower is a BFP without notice, he might take, but if not, he doesn't.

But Grower did not search the title and saw the fence. The question is whether that gives him inquiry notice. If the fence was built by Farmer, and the Grower saw it but didn't investigate, does that mean he had constructive notice?

In some jurisdictions, seeing someone in possession might put you on inquiry to determine who owns the property. But if the Grower didn't follow up, maybe he's charged with knowledge.

But the problem says that when Grower visited, the Buyer wasn't present, and nothing indicated who was using it. So Grower didn't know, and didn't search. So perhaps he's still a BFP.

Wait, but Grower is buying from Retiree, whose deed is from Son. So the chain for Grower would be Retiree → Son → Rancher. But since Son's deed was unrecorded, and Farmer's deed is recorded, the records would show Farmer as the owner, then Buyer from Farmer.

Wait, no. The records would only show Farmer's deed because Son's was never recorded. So when Buyer searches, he finds Farmer's deed recorded, which is from Rancher. So Buyer, being a BFP, takes clean title, free of Son's unrecorded deed.

So now, in 2007, when Retiree sells to Grower, the records show that the property was sold by Farmer to Buyer in 2003, and Buyer recorded. So Grower, if he had done a title search, would have found Buyer's deed. But Grower didn't search the title, so he might not be a BFP.

Wait, but if Grower didn't search, does that mean he had constructive notice? In a notice jurisdiction, a purchaser is charged with knowledge of what's in the records. So if Grower didn't search, he can still be a BFP if he had no actual or constructive notice.

But if the records show Buyer's deed, then Grower's failure to search would mean he's charged with knowledge of Buyer's ownership. So Grower would have constructive notice that Buyer owns the property, making him not a BFP.

Wait, no. Because in this case, Grower is purchasing from Retiree, whose chain of title starts with Son, which isn't recorded. So the records don't show Retiree or Son's deeds. But the records do show Farmer's and Buyer's deeds.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again. Let me try to outline the recording.

The Farmer recorded his deed in 1998. So the records would show:

Rancher → Farmer (recorded 1998)

Farmer → Buyer (recorded 2003)

Buyer is the current record owner.

So when Grower buys from Retiree in 2007, if he had searched the records, he would have found Buyer's deed. Since he didn't search, he can't claim BFP status because he's charged with knowledge of what's in the records. So Grower would have constructive notice of Buyer's ownership and thus can't be a BFP.

So in 2007, when Retiree sells to Grower, Grower isn't a BFP because he should have known about Buyer's recorded deed. Therefore, Grower's interest is junior to Buyer's.

Thus, the current title is with Buyer.

Wait, but looking at the options again, none of the options directly say that Buyer has title. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Grower as BFP gets title. But Grower isn't a BFP because he didn't search and is charged with knowledge.

Option B: Farmer's equitable title. No, because Farmer had notice.

Option C: Farmer recorded first, but in notice, it's about subsequent purchasers.

Option I: Rancher retains title. No, because the conveyances have moved.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the initial conveyances again.

Rancher → Son (unrecorded, 1994)

Rancher → Farmer (recorded, 1998, but Farmer had notice)

Farmer → Buyer (recorded, 2003, Buyer is BFP)

So when Buyer buys from Farmer, he's a BFP without notice, taking priority over Son's unrecorded deed. So Buyer's interest is valid, and he records.

Now, Son had conveyed to Retiree (unrecorded, 1999). Retiree then conveys to Grower (2007, unrecorded). So Grower's chain would be Retiree → Son → Rancher. But since Son's deed was unrecorded, and Farmer's deed was recorded, when Buyer bought, he took free of Son's interest. So Son's conveyance to Retiree is of no effect against Buyer.

Therefore, in 2008, Buyer holds the valid record title.

But looking back at the options, I don't see an option that says Buyer has title. Wait, maybe I missed it.

Wait, the options are from A to J, listed as:

Option A: Grower as BFP.

Option B: Farmer's equitable title.

Option C: Farmer recorded first.

Option D: Grower last to record.

Option E: Retiree.

Option F: Son.

Option G: Buyer in race.

Option H: Retiree equitable.

Option I: Rancher.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options say Buyer has title, but I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

When Farmer recorded his deed, which was after Son's conveyance, but Farmer had notice. So Farmer's deed, being recorded, would be valid against any subsequent purchaser with notice, but not against a BFP without notice.

So when Buyer
