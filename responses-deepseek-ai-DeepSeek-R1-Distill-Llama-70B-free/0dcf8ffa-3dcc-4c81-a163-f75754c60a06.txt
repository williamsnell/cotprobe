Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a discount on in-line skates. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that the skates normally cost $110.99, and there's a 10% discount. I need to find out how much they'll cost after the discount, not including tax. Hmm, okay, so I remember that a percentage discount means you subtract that percentage of the original price from the original price. 

So first, I think I should calculate 10% of $110.99. To find 10% of a number, I can just move the decimal point one place to the left, right? So 10% of 100 is 10, so 10% of 110.99 should be 11.099. Wait, let me write that down: 110.99 * 0.10 equals 11.099.

Now, I need to subtract that discount from the original price to get the discounted price. So $110.99 minus $11.099. Let me do the subtraction. 

Wait, maybe I should write it out more carefully. 110.99 minus 11.099. Let's see: 110.99 is the same as 110.990. Subtracting 11.099 from that. So, 110.990 - 11.099 equals... Let's subtract each part. 

110 minus 11 is 99, and 0.990 minus 0.099 is 0.891. So altogether, that's 99.891. Oh, wait, but currency is usually to two decimal places. So 99.891 would round to 99.89. Wait, no, because the third decimal is 1, which is less than 5, so it would just be 99.89. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is $99.89 and option F is $99.99. So which one is correct? Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. 

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it another way. 10% off means you're paying 90% of the original price. So 110.99 multiplied by 0.90. Let me compute that. 

Hmm, 100 * 0.90 is 90, 10 * 0.90 is 9, so 90 + 9 is 99. But wait, that's for 110, not 110.99. So 110.99 * 0.90. Let me do this multiplication properly. 

110.99 * 0.9. Let's break it down: 100 * 0.9 is 90, 10 *0.9 is 9, 0.99*0.9 is 0.891. So adding those together: 90 + 9 is 99, plus 0.891 is 99.891, which is the same as before. So yes, $99.891, which would be $99.89 when rounded to two decimal places. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with money, we round to the nearest cent. So 0.891 is approximately 0.89 dollars, so the total price is $99.89. That matches option D. 

Looking back at the options, option D is $99.89, which seems correct. But wait, let me check the other options just in case. Option F is $99.99, which is a dollar more. Did I miscalculate somewhere?

Wait, maybe I should compute 10% of 110.99 again. So 110.99 times 0.10 is 11.099. Subtracting that from 110.99, I get 99.891, which is 99.89 when rounded. So yes, option D is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the store rounds differently. Sometimes they might round up, but the standard is to round to the nearest cent. So 0.891 is less than 0.895, which would round up to 0.90, but 0.891 is 0.89 when rounded down. So I think option D is the right answer.

To determine the cost of the in-line skates after a 10% discount, we first calculate 10% of the original price ($110.99). This is done by multiplying:

\[
110.99 \times 0.10 = 11.099
\]

Next, we subtract this discount from the original price:

\[
110.99 - 11.099 = 99.891
\]

Since currency is typically rounded to two decimal places, $99.891 becomes $99.89. 

Reviewing the options, $99.89 corresponds to option D. Other options, such as $99.99 (option F), are incorrect because they overstate the price by $0.10. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: $99.89
