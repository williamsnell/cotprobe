Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question here. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a 14-year-old girl whose behavior has changed significantly after her parents separated. Before the separation, she was an honor student, did well in sports and leadership roles. But after her parents split up, she started acting out—she's become sullen, defiant, rebellious. She's also started smoking, disobeying curfew, truant from school, and began having unprotected sex with multiple partners. The question is asking which defense mechanism she's most likely using.

Alright, so I remember that defense mechanisms are psychological strategies that people use to cope with stress, anxiety, or other uncomfortable emotions. They're often unconscious processes. Let me think about each of the options given.

The options are A through J, each representing a different defense mechanism. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Acting out. From what I recall, acting out is when someone expresses their unconscious feelings or thoughts through actions rather than words. Instead of talking about their emotions, they act them out in a way that might not be healthy. So in this case, the girl is engaging in risky behaviors like unprotected sex, smoking, truancy. That seems like she's acting out her emotional distress through these actions.

Option B: Intellectualization. This is when someone distances themselves from their emotions by focusing on the abstract aspects of a situation. Like, overanalyzing it but not really dealing with the feelings. Doesn't seem to fit here since she's not talking about her feelings in an abstract way; she's acting out physically.

Option C: Projection. This is attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. Like if someone is angry but says someone else is angry with them. Doesn't fit the scenario here.

Option D: Regression. This is reverting to an earlier stage of development when faced with stress. For example, a child might start sucking their thumb again when anxious. But this girl is acting out in a more rebellious way, which doesn't seem like regression to a younger state.

Option E: Displacement. This is redirecting emotions toward a safer target. Like if you're angry at your boss, you go home and yell at your family instead. Not sure if that's what's happening here. It doesn't seem like she's redirecting her emotions but rather expressing them in her own behavior.

Option F: Rationalization. This is creating logical explanations to justify unacceptable behavior. For example, someone might say they stole because they needed the item, not because they wanted to. But the girl isn't providing justifications; she's just acting out.

Option G: Denial. This is refusing to accept reality or facts. Like someone denying they have an illness when they do. I don't think she's denying anything; she's aware of her actions but maybe not the underlying reasons.

Option H: Repression. This is pushing uncomfortable thoughts or feelings into the unconscious mind. She might be repressing her feelings about her parents' separation, but her behavior isn't directly an example of repression—it's more about how she's acting, not what she's forgetting.

Option I: Sublimation. This is channeling unacceptable impulses into more socially acceptable behaviors. Like using creativity or sports. But here, she's moving from positive activities to negative ones, so it's the opposite.

Option J: Reaction formation. This is expressing the opposite of one's true feelings. Like hating someone but being overly nice to them. Doesn't seem to apply here.

So putting it all together, the girl's behavior—acting out through risky and rebellious actions—seems to fit the defense mechanism called acting out. She's expressing her emotional pain through these actions instead of dealing with her feelings in a more constructive way.

The patient, a 14-year-old girl, has exhibited significant behavioral changes following her parents' separation. Prior to the separation, she was an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership roles. However, afterward, she became sullen, defiant, and rebellious, engaging in risky behaviors such as unprotected sex, smoking, disobeying curfew, and truancy. These actions suggest she is expressing her emotional distress through her behavior rather than addressing her feelings directly.

Analyzing the defense mechanisms:

- **Acting out (A):** This involves expressing unconscious feelings or thoughts through actions rather than words. The girl's risky and rebellious behaviors align with this mechanism, as she is acting out her emotional pain.
- **Intellectualization (B):** Involves distancing oneself from emotions by focusing on abstract aspects. This does not fit, as she is not overanalyzing her feelings but acting them out.
- **Projection (C):** Attributing one's unacceptable thoughts or feelings to others. This does not apply, as there is no indication she is redirecting her emotions onto others.
- **Regression (D):** Reverting to an earlier developmental stage. Her rebellious behavior does not indicate regression to a younger state.
- **Displacement (E):** Redirecting emotions toward a safer target. This does not fit, as her actions are not redirected but expressed through her own behavior.
- **Rationalization (F):** Creating logical justifications for unacceptable behavior. She is not providing justifications for her actions.
- **Denial (G):** Refusing to accept reality. She is aware of her actions and their consequences, so this does not apply.
- **Repression (H):** Pushing uncomfortable thoughts or feelings into the unconscious. While she may be repressing feelings about her parents' separation, her behavior is not an example of repression.
- **Sublimation (I):** Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable behaviors. This is the opposite of her actions, as she is moving from positive to negative behaviors.
- **Reaction formation (J):** Expressing the opposite of one's true feelings. This does not apply, as her actions reflect her emotional distress rather than the opposite.

The most appropriate defense mechanism is **acting out**, as the girl is expressing her emotional pain through her rebellious and risky behaviors.
