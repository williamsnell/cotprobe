Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The assumption by a government of the office of Reliever-general to the poor is necessarily forbidden by the principle that a government cannot rightly do anything more than protect. In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress … the state is … reversing its function. … To enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. … [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. …
The poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong … are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. … When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.
Herbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851

Okay, so I've got this question here about Herbert Spencer and his views based on a passage from his work. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. It talks about the government assuming the office of Reliever-general to the poor being forbidden by a principle. The idea is that the government shouldn't do more than protect. So, when the government demands contributions from citizens to help the poor, it's reversing its function. The main role of the state, according to Spencer, is to enforce fundamental law, ensuring everyone's freedom as long as they don't infringe on others. But this is separate from ensuring satisfaction, meaning the government isn't responsible for making sure everyone's needs are met.

The passage also mentions that poverty, distress, and such are part of a larger, benevolent plan. These "harsh fatalities" are actually beneficial when looking at the bigger picture of humanity. So Spencer seems to support the idea of natural selection or survival of the fittest, where the weak might not be helped because it's for the greater good.

Now, looking at the question: it's asking what we can infer about Spencer's beliefs from this passage. The options are A to H.

Let me go through each option:

A: Believed working people should unite for a common cause. The passage doesn't mention anything about workers uniting. It's more about government intervention, so probably not A.

B: Government should ensure satisfaction of citizens. No, the passage says the opposite. Spencer argues that ensuring satisfaction isn't the government's role. So B is incorrect.

C: Supported government intervention in economy. The passage says the government shouldn't do more than protect, so C is probably wrong.

D: Advocated higher taxes for social causes. Since he's against the government taking contributions for the poor, higher taxes for social causes would go against his views. So D is out.

E: Believed government should do more than protect. No, the passage says the government shouldn't do more than protect. So E is incorrect.

F: Believed in a society where strong help weak. The passage actually suggests the opposite. Spencer seems to think that the strong pushing aside the weak is part of a larger benevolence, so he probably doesn't support the strong helping the weak. So F is incorrect.

G: Opposed use of tax money to aid the poor. Yes, that makes sense. The passage says assuming the role of reliever is forbidden, so using taxes for that would be against his views. So G seems correct.

H: Advocated for a welfare state. No, a welfare state involves government support for the poor, which Spencer is against. So H is wrong.

Wait, let me make sure. The passage says that the government shouldn't take contributions (taxes) to mitigate distress, so G is definitely right. He opposes using tax money for aid.

The passage indicates that Spencer opposed government intervention beyond protection, specifically rejecting the idea of using tax money to aid the poor. This aligns with option G.

G

Answer: G
