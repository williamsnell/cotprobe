Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and their enforceability. Hmm, I remember that offers can be revoked under certain circumstances, but there are exceptions where the offer becomes irrevocable. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes his mind before acceptance. So, I need to find the option where the offer can be revoked, meaning it's not irrevocable.

I recall that under the common law, offers are revocable unless there's consideration for the promise to keep it open. Also, the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) has different rules for merchants. So, if it's between merchants, there might be different considerations.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Merchant emails buyer, offers to sell for $35k, promises to keep open for ten days. Wait, merchants under UCC 2-205 can make an offer irrevocable without consideration if it's in writing and signed. But wait, the UCC says that merchants can make firm offers in writing, so if it's a written promise, even without consideration, it's irrevocable. So this offer would be enforceable, so the seller can't revoke. So this isn't the correct answer.

Option B: Telegraph offer, same as A, but telegraph is a written communication. So same as A, it's a firm offer under UCC. So seller can't revoke. Not the answer.

Option C: Written offer stating irrevocable for ten days. Again, written by a merchant, so under UCC 2-205 it's enforceable. Seller can't back out. So not the answer.

Option D: Fax offer, same as above. Fax is a written form, so again, irrevocable. Not the answer.

Option E: Written offer, offer is irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $1. Here, the buyer pays $1. So this is an option contract because there's consideration (the $1). Under common law, this makes the offer irrevocable. So seller can't revoke. So not the answer.

Option F: Written offer without any mention of irrevocability or consideration. So under common law, without consideration or a firm promise, the offer is revocable. So if the seller changes mind before acceptance, the offer can be revoked, making the offer not enforceable. So this is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, in UCC, if it's a merchant, does any written offer become firm? Let me think. Yes, UCC 2-205 says that a written offer by a merchant is irrevocable for a stated period or if no period is stated, for a reasonable time. So if the offer is in writing from a merchant, it's firm. So option F is a written offer but doesn't say anything about being held open. So under UCC, it's revocable after a reasonable time, but if the offer doesn't specify a time, it's open for a reasonable period. But if the seller revokes before acceptance, and before the reasonable time has passed, then it's still revokable? Or is it that under 2-205, even without stating it's firm, it's firm for a reasonable time.

Wait, let me clarify: Under UCC 2-205, a merchant's written offer is irrevocable without consideration for the time stated (if any) or for a reasonable time if not stated. So if the offer in F is just a standard offer without any promise to keep it open, then it's revocable after a reasonable time. But if the seller revokes before that reasonable time, then it's not allowed. Hmm, but in option F, the offer doesn't state it will be kept open, so the offer is revocable unless it's within the reasonable time. So if the merchant sends a standard offer without any promise, it can be revoked unless it's within the reasonable time. But in this question, the seller changes mind before acceptance. So if the offer didn't promise to be held open, then under UCC, the revocation would be effective unless it's within the reasonable time. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question is about which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes mind before acceptance. So the offers that are enforceable (irrevocable) are the ones that can't be revoked. The one that's not enforceable is the one where the seller can revoke.

So, in option F, since the offer doesn't state it's irrevocable and doesn't have consideration, under common law, it's revocable. But because it's a merchant, under UCC, even without stating, a written offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time. So if the seller revokes it before the reasonable time, then the revocation is ineffective. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, no. The offer is made by a merchant, so 2-205 applies. So even if the offer doesn't state it's firm, it's still firm for a reasonable time. So the seller can't revoke it during that time. So in this case, if the seller revokes before the reasonable time, then the revocation is not allowed. So the offer is still enforceable.

Wait, but option F is a standard offer without any firmness. So, under UCC, any written offer by a merchant is firm for a reasonable time. So if the seller sends a standard offer, but as per 2-205, it's firm. So if the seller tries to revoke it before the reasonable time, the revocation is ineffective. So the offer remains open. So the buyer can accept.

Wait, but the question is which offer is not enforceable. So if the offer is revocable, then it's not enforceable if the seller revokes. But according to UCC, in option F, the offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time, so it's enforceable. So the correct answer must be F, but wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try again. Which offers are irrevocable? Options A, B, C, D, E are all irrevocable because they either fall under UCC 2-205 (written by merchant) or have consideration (option E). Option F is a written offer from a merchant without any firmness stated. Under UCC 2-205, it's irrevocable for a reasonable time. So the seller can't revoke it during that time. So if the seller changes mind before that time, the offer is still enforceable. So the answer must be another option. Wait, but wait, the question is which is not enforceable. So if the seller revokes before acceptance, which offer is not enforceable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Option F is a written offer by a merchant. Under UCC 2-205, such offers are irrevocable for a reasonable time. So if the seller revokes before that reasonable time, the revocation is not effective. So the offer is still good. Therefore, the offer is enforceable against the seller.

Wait, but the question is which offer is not enforceable. So if the seller revokes before acceptance, which offer is not enforceable. So the revocation would make the offer unenforceable only if the offer was revocable. So which offer is revocable.

Options A-E are all irrevocable either through merchant firm offers or consideration. So the only offer that's revocable is option F? No, because under UCC, F is irrevocable for a reasonable time.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me check the UCC rule again. UCC 2-205(1) says that an offer by a merchant is irrevocable for the time stated, if any, or for a reasonable time if no time is stated. So in option F, where no time is stated, it's open for a reasonable time, say, like, a few days. So if the seller revokes within that time, the revocation isn't effective. So the seller can't revoke. Therefore, the offer is enforceable, so it's not the correct answer.

Wait, then which option is revocable? Because all options except F have specific time frames or consideration. Wait, no, option F is a standard offer without any time. So under common law, without consideration, it's revocable. But under UCC, since it's a merchant, it's irrevocable for a reasonable time. So under UCC, it's enforceable.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the question is which offer is not enforceable. So if the seller revokes before acceptance, which offer can he do that, making the offer unenforceable.

So the correct answer would be the offer that is revocable, which is only possible if it's not covered by UCC 2-205 or common law exceptions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The only offer that's revocable is option F, but under UCC, it's not revocable. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think again. Under common law, offers are revocable unless optioned with consideration. Under UCC, a merchant's written offer is firm for a reasonable time without consideration.

So in the options:

A: Merchant's written offer with a ten-day promise. Firm under UCC, so enforceable.

B: Telegraph, same as A.

C: Written, irrevocable for ten days. Firm.

D: Fax, same.

E: Consideration given, so firm.

F: Written, but doesn't say anything about keeping it open. So under UCC, it's firm for a reasonable time. So the offer can't be revoked during that time.

Wait, but maybe the question is considering common law, not UCC? Or perhaps the options are trying to test knowledge on the firm offer under UCC.

Wait, the question says "merchant", so UCC applies. So all offers from A to E are firm except F, but F is still firm under UCC. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, maybe the offer in F is a standard offer without any firmness, so under common law, it's revocable, but under UCC, since it's a merchant, it's firm. So the seller can't revoke, so the offer is enforceable. So the only offer that's not enforceable is the one that's revocable.

Wait, but all options except F have firm offers. F, under UCC, is also firm. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps option F is the standard offer without any firmness, so under common law, it's revocable. But since it's a merchant, UCC applies, making it firm. So the only way for an offer to be revocable is if it's not covered by UCC 2-205.

Wait, perhaps the distinction is that options A, B, C, D, E all have either a firm promise (A, B, C, D) or consideration (E), making them firm offers. Option F is a standard offer, which under UCC is firm for a reasonable time. So the seller can't revoke it during that time. So all offers except F are firm, but F is also firm under UCC.

Wait, but the question is which offer is not enforceable. So if the seller revokes before acceptance, the offer cannot be enforced if it's revocable. So the correct answer must be the offer that's revocable, which would be the one not covered by any exception.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but I think the answer is F. Because under common law, without consideration or a firm promise, it's revocable. But under UCC, it's firm. So perhaps the question is testing common law, but the options mention merchants, so UCC applies. So in that case, all offers are firm except none. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: Option F is not in a form that qualifies under UCC 2-205. Because 2-205 requires that the offer be made by a merchant and be in writing. Option F says the merchant writes an offer, so it's in writing. So it's a firm offer.

Wait, then all offers are firm except none. So perhaps the correct answer is F because it's not held open, but under UCC, it's firm for a reasonable time. So the seller can't revoke within that time. So if the seller revokes before that, the offer remains open. So the offer is enforceable.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe the answer is option F because it's not an option contract and doesn't have a firm promise, so under common law, it's revocable, but under UCC, it's firm. So the correct answer is F, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E. No, E has consideration, making it firm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, because without a specific time or consideration, under UCC, it's only firm for a reasonable time. But if the revocation happens after that reasonable time, then it's effective. But the question says the seller changes mind prior to acceptance. So if the time hasn't expired, then the revocation isn't allowed. So the offer is enforceable, making F not the correct answer.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Maybe the correct answer is F because under UCC, it's firm for a reasonable time, but without a specific time, the offer is revocable after that reasonable time. But the question doesn't specify the time frame, so if the seller revokes before the reasonable time, the offer is still firm.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. I think the answer is F because it's the only offer that doesn't specify being held open, but under UCC, it's still firm for a reasonable time. So the seller can't revoke it during that time, making the offer enforceable, so F is not the correct answer. Then, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because under common law, it's revocable, but under UCC, it's firm. So the offer is enforceable, so it's not the answer. Then, I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the answer is F because it's the only offer that doesn't have a promise to be held open, making it revocable under common law. But since it's a merchant, UCC applies, making it firm. So the offer is enforceable. So the correct answer must be another option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline each option's enforceability.

- Option A: Merchant, written, ten days. Firm under UCC. Enforceable.
- Option B: Same as A, via telegram. Firm. Enforceable.
- Option C: Written, irrevocable for ten days. Firm. Enforceable.
- Option D: Fax, same as A. Firm. Enforceable.
- Option E: Consideration given ($1). Option contract. Firm. Enforceable.
- Option F: Written offer without any firmness. Under UCC, firm for reasonable time. Enforceable.

So all options are enforceable except none. That can't be right. So perhaps the answer is F because it's revocable, but under UCC, it's firm. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the key is that under UCC 2-205, the offer must be made by a merchant, in writing, and with some indication that it's firm. So if the offer in F doesn't state that it's firm, then under UCC, it's not considered a firm offer. Wait, no, UCC 2-205 doesn't require the offer to state it's firm; it just requires it to be in writing from a merchant. So even if the merchant doesn't say it's firm, the offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time.

So in that case, all the options except perhaps F are firm, but F is also firm under UCC. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the answer is F because it's not an option contract and doesn't have a firm promise, so under common law, it's revocable. But under UCC, it's firm. So the offer is enforceable, so F is not the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's a standard offer and the others are firm offers. So the only unenforceable offer is F.

Wait, I'm really stuck. I think I need to make a decision. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is F because without any firmness or consideration, under common law it's revocable, but under UCC, it's firm. So perhaps the question expects the answer to be F, considering common law, but the presence of merchants makes UCC apply. So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, all the options except F have either a specific time or consideration. F is a standard offer, but under UCC, it's firm for a reasonable time. So the offer is enforceable, meaning the seller can't revoke. So the correct answer must be F because it's the only offer that's revocable, but under UCC, it's not. Hmm.

I think I might have to go with F as the correct answer, even though I'm a bit confused. So the answer is F.

To determine which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes his mind prior to acceptance, we must analyze the revocability of each offer under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common law principles. Under UCC § 2-205, a written offer made by a merchant is irrevocable for a reasonable time, even without consideration, unless the offer specifies otherwise. Additionally, offers supported by consideration (e.g., option contracts) are also irrevocable.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A**: A merchant emails the buyer, offering to sell the widget for $35,000 and promising to keep the offer open for ten days.  
   - This is a written offer by a merchant, making it irrevocable under UCC § 2-205 for the stated ten-day period.  
   - **Enforceable**.

2. **Option B**: A merchant telegraphs the buyer, offering to sell the widget for $35,000 and promising to hold the offer open for ten days.  
   - Similar to Option A, this is a written offer by a merchant with a specified time period. It is irrevocable under UCC § 2-205.  
   - **Enforceable**.

3. **Option C**: A merchant tells the buyer in writing that she will sell the widget for $35,000 and that the offer will be irrevocable for ten days.  
   - This is a written offer by a merchant with a clear promise of irrevocability. It is irrevocable under UCC § 2-
