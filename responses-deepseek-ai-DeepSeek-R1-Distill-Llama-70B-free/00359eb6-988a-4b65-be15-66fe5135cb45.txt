Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this contracts question about assignments. I'm a third-year student, so I've covered this before, but I need to make sure I get it right. The question is about which option is NOT an exception to the general rule that all contractual rights may be assigned. 

Alright, the general rule is that most contractual rights can be assigned, but there are exceptions. I remember that certain types of contracts have restrictions. Let me think about what those exceptions are.

First, I think about personal service contracts. If the contract is based on someone's personal skills or reputation, like a famous singer's performance, you can't just assign that to someone else because it changes the nature of the obligation. So if the assignment changes the obligor's duty or risk substantially, that's an exception. That would correspond to option A, maybe.

Option B says an assignment that changes the nature of the contract. That sounds similar to A. I think that would also be an exception because the contract's essence would be altered, making it impossible to assign without consent.

Option C is about continuing the obligor's duty or risk. Wait, if the assignment doesn't change the duty or risk, that should be okay. So this isn't an exception. That might be the correct answer because the question asks which is NOT an exception. So C could be the right choice.

Option D is transferring rights to an incapable party. Like if the assignee is a minor or mentally incapacitated, the assignment might not be valid because they can't legally perform. So that's probably an exception.

Option E mentions undue hardship or loss. If assigning the right would cause significant problems for the obligor, that's not allowed. So E is an exception.

Option F talks about reducing the value to the obligor. If the assignment makes the contract less valuable, maybe that's also an exception. Like if a supplier is assigned to a new buyer who pays less, but I'm not sure if this is a standard exception. I'll have to think about that.

Option G is about future rights from future contracts. I remember that you can assign future rights, but there are some conditions. Wait, no—assignments of future rights are generally allowed, but maybe if they're too speculative. Or perhaps they're allowed as long as they're identified with enough specificity when the contract is made. So G might not be an exception, making it a possible correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option H says an assignment without consent of the other party. I think some assignments require consent, especially if the contract specifies that. But in general, assignments are allowed unless the contract says otherwise. So this might be an exception only when the contract prohibits it. Otherwise, assignments can happen without consent unless it's a personal service contract or something similar.

Option I is an assignment not allowed by law. That's a clear exception because the law prohibits it. So I is definitely an exception.

Now, going back to the options. The question is which is NOT an exception. So I'm looking for the option that is allowed.

Option C says the assignment continues the obligor's duty or risk. That sounds like it's not changing anything, so it's permissible. So C is not an exception.

Option G is about future rights. My notes say that assignments can be of future rights, so G is allowed. Wait, but I also recall that some jurisdictions might require that the rights be sufficiently certain. But generally, assignments of future rights are possible unless there's a specific restriction.

Wait, the options: the correct answer is the one that is NOT an exception. So the question is which of these is allowed.

Looking again:

A: Substantially changes duty or risk → exception.

B: Changes the nature of the contract → exception.

C: Continues duty or risk → not an exception.

D: Incapable party → exception.

E: Undue hardship → exception.

F: Reduces value → maybe an exception? But I'm not sure. I think reducing value alone isn't enough; it's more about the nature of the duty.

G: Assignment of future rights → I think this is allowed, so G is not an exception.

H: Without consent → only an exception if the contract requires consent.

I: Not allowed by law → exception.

So the options that are NOT exceptions are C and G.

Wait, the question is which is NOT an exception. So which of the options is allowed.

Looking back, the question is which is not an exception, so the correct answer would be either C or G.

The question is about which is not an exception. So the correct answer is the one that can be assigned.

So the options are:

Which is not an exception? So the one that is allowed.

Option C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. That is, the assignment doesn't change anything, so it's allowed. So C is not an exception.

Option G: Assignment of future rights from future contracts. I think that's allowed, so G is not an exception. So which of these is the correct answer.

Wait, the options given are A through I, and the question asks which is NOT an exception. So among the options, the ones that are allowed are the correct answers.

So the options that are not exceptions are:

C: Because it doesn't change the duty or risk.

G: Because assigning future rights is permitted.

So the question is, which is NOT an exception. So the correct answer is either C or G.

Looking back at the possible options, the correct answer is either C or G.

Wait, but let me think again. In contract law, generally, an assignment is allowed unless it's of a personal nature, or against public policy, or causes undue hardship. Assigning future rights is allowed as long as they can be identified when they come into existence.

So G is not an exception, meaning it's allowed. So G is not an exception, so the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but I thought C was also not an exception. So the options are a bit confusing.

Wait, the question is, which is NOT an exception. So which of the options is something that's allowed.

So, for each option:

C: Assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. So if the assignment doesn't change the obligor's duties, then it's allowed. So C is allowed, not an exception.

G: Assignment of future rights from future contracts. I think this is allowed, so G is not an exception.

So the question is, which is not an exception. So the possible answers are C and G.

But looking at the options, the choices are A to I, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

The question: which is NOT an exception.

So, the correct answer is the option that is not an exception, meaning it's allowed.

So among the options, the allowed ones are:

C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. So this is allowed, not an exception.

G: An assignment of future rights from future contracts. This is allowed, so not an exception.

Which one of these is in the options?

Looking back, the options are:

C: Assignment continues duty/risk.

G: Assignment of future rights.

So both C and G are allowed. But looking at the options, which one is correct.

Wait, the question is which of the following is NOT an exception. So the correct answer is the one that is allowed, so the one that doesn't prevent assignment.

The options are:

The possible correct answers are C and G.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Substantially changes duty/risk → exception.

B: Changes nature → exception.

C: Continues duty → allowed.

D: Incapable → exception.

E: Undue hardship → exception.

F: Reduces value → maybe exception?

G: Future rights → allowed.

H: Without consent → maybe exception if contract says so.

I: Not allowed by law → exception.

So, the correct answers are C and G.

But the question asks for which is not an exception, so which is allowed.

Now, the options for the answer are:

Options are A through to J, but in the given options, it's A to I, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, the question lists options A through I, and the choices. So the correct answer is either C or G.

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

In general, assignments are allowed unless:

- The contract prohibits assignment.

- The rights are personal (like personal services).

- Assignment would materially change the risk or duties.

- The assignment is prohibited by law.

So, assignments that don't change the obligor's duties or risk are allowed, so C is not an exception.

Assignments of future rights are allowed as long as they can be identified when they arise, so G is allowed, not an exception.

So both C and G are not exceptions. But looking at the options, which of the two is correct.

Wait, the question is only giving one correct answer, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding one of the options.

Wait, let's read the options carefully.

Option C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. That is, the assignment doesn't change anything. So this is allowed, not an exception.

Option G: Assignment of future rights from future contracts. So like, I assign rights that I'll get in the future under a contract that I'll enter into later. Wait, no—usually, future rights must be from existing contracts. If the contract isn't in place yet, maybe it's too speculative. So assigning future rights from future contracts may not be allowed because it's too uncertain. Or perhaps it's allowed if it's specific enough.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have a contract with A, and I assign my future rights under that contract to B. That's allowed. But if I don't have any contract yet, and I assign future rights from a future contract, that might not be enforceable because it's too vague. So perhaps G is an exception.

Wait, but in some cases, you can assign future rights. For example, if you expect to enter into a contract and assign the rights to someone else. But the assignment must be specific enough to be enforceable. If it's too vague, the courts might not uphold it. So perhaps G is an exception because it's too uncertain.

In that case, G would be an exception, so it's not the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed thoughts here. I think assignments of future rights are generally allowed as long as they can be identified when the rights come into existence. So G's description is "assignment of future rights from future contracts." That sounds like it's not allowed because the contracts don't exist yet, making the assignment too speculative. So G would be an exception, making it not the correct answer.

So, if G is an exception, then the correct answer (the option that is NOT an exception) would be C. Because C is allowed, it's not an exception.

So the correct answer would be C, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, another way: the question asks which is NOT an exception, meaning it's allowed. So which of the options is allowed.

C: Assignment continues the duty or risk. That's allowed, so it's not an exception.

G: Assignment of future rights from future contracts. If that's allowed, then it's not an exception. But if it's not allowed, then it's an exception.

I'm a bit unsure, but I think assignments of future rights are generally allowed as long as they can be ascertained when the rights arise. So if the assignment is from future contracts, that might be too vague, making G an exception. So G is an exception, so it's not the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, because it's allowed.

The question asks which of the given options is **not an exception** to the general rule that all contractual rights may be assigned. The analysis of each option is as follows:

- **A**: An assignment that substantially changes the obligor's duty or risk is an exception because it alters the nature of the obligation, making it impermissible without consent.  
- **B**: An assignment that changes the nature of the contract is also an exception, as it fundamentally alters the agreement.  
- **C**: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk does not change anything and is therefore allowed. This is **not an exception**.  
- **D**: An assignment that transfers rights to an incapable party is an exception because the assignee cannot legally perform the obligations.  
- **E**: An assignment that causes undue hardship or loss to the obligor is an exception, as it is not enforceable under such circumstances.  
- **F**: An assignment that reduces the value of the contract to the obligor may be considered an exception, depending on the circumstances, but it is less clear-cut.  
- **G**: An assignment of future rights from future contracts is generally allowed if the rights can be identified with sufficient specificity when they arise. However, if the assignment is too vague or speculative, it may be considered an exception.  
- **H**: An assignment made without the consent of the other party is an exception only if the contract explicitly requires consent.  
- **I**: An assignment not allowed by law is clearly an exception.

The correct answer is **C**, as it describes a situation that is allowed and does not constitute an exception to the general rule of assignment. 

Answer: C
