Okay, so I have this question about horizontal versus vertical microarchitectures. Hmm, I remember from my computer architecture class that there are different types of microarchitectures, and they relate to how instructions are processed. Let me think.

The question has three statements, I, II, and III. I need to figure out which are true.

Statement I says programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than vertical ones. Wait, horizontal microarchitecture, I think, refers to a design where each microinstruction controls a lot of hardware in parallel. So each step can do more. So if a horizontal architecture can execute more in each step, maybe each instruction takes fewer steps, right? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, vertical architectures have more complex instructions that take longer to decode. So programs might require more time steps in vertical? Or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think in a horizontal microarchitecture, each microinstruction is more complex. So each micro-op can do more, meaning each step is more powerful. So for a given program, it would take fewer steps. So Statement I says programs take more time steps in horizontal? That would be false. Because if each step does more, you need fewer steps. So Statement I is false.

Statement II: Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded. I remember something about encoding. I think in vertical architectures, the microinstructions are more like compact, encoded opcodes. Horizontal ones are more explicit, maybe unencoded. So Statement II is true.

Statement III: Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers. Wait, no. I think it's the opposite. Vertical microinstructions have a single opcode that specifies a more complex operation, needing more operands. Horizontal would have multiple opcodes, each controlling different parts of the hardware. Or maybe each microinstruction is a bundle of multiple operations. Wait, no. Wait, horizontal microinstructions might have multiple fields, each specifying different operations. So perhaps each instruction has multiple opcodes, not a single one.

Wait, no. Maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again. In a horizontal microarchitecture, each microinstruction is like a wide word that controls multiple execution units. So each micro-op could have multiple opcodes, each for a different part. So Statement III says a single opcode and multiple operands. That doesn't sound right. Oh wait, the statement says "multiple operand specifiers" — like each opcode has its operands. So perhaps each instruction in a horizontal design has multiple opcodes, each with their own operands. So Statement III is saying each microinstruction has a single opcode with multiple operands. That doesn't fit. Maybe Statement III is false.

Wait, no. Let's think about the terms. Vertical microinstructions are like CISC, where each instruction is a single opcode that does a lot, needing many operands. Horizontal would have each instruction specify multiple operations, each with their operands. So each microinstruction would have multiple opcodes. So Statement III is incorrect.

Wait, or is it the other way around. Because microinstructions in a horizontal design are more explicit, maybe they have each operation broken down, so each micro-op could have multiple opcodes, each with their own operands. So Statement III says each has a single opcode and multiple operands. So that's not correct. So Statement III is false.

So summarizing: Statement I is false (horizontal should have fewer steps, so I says more steps, which is wrong), Statement II is true (horizontal are unencoded), Statement III is false (they would have multiple opcodes, not single).

So looking at the options:

I: I and III only → both I and III are false, so no.

II: All are true? No, because I and III are false.

Looking for which options have only II as correct. The options are:

Option F: II only.

Option G: II and III → but III is wrong.

So the correct answer would be F: II only.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake with statement III.

Another approach: Horizontal microinstructions are typically composed of multiple fields, each specifying a different operation. Each field (like load, store, ALU operation) is controlled by a part of the microinstruction. So each microinstruction might have multiple opcodes, each specifying what each part of the CPU does. So each microinstruction can have multiple opcodes, not a single one. So statement III is incorrect because it says single opcode. So III is false.

So which statements are correct?

Only statement II is correct. So the correct answer is F: II only.

Looking at the options, option F is II only. So the answer should be F.

Horizontal versus vertical microarchitectures differ in how microinstructions are structured and executed. Here's an analysis of the given statements:

1. **Statement I**: "Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures."  
   This is false. Horizontal microarchitectures are designed to execute more operations in parallel, meaning fewer time steps are typically required compared to vertical architectures, which often process more complex instructions sequentially.

2. **Statement II**: "Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded."  
   This is true. Horizontal microinstructions are typically explicit and unencoded, allowing direct control over hardware components.

3. **Statement III**: "Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers."  
   This is false. Horizontal microinstructions often include multiple opcodes, each controlling different parts of the hardware, rather than a single opcode with multiple operands.

Based on this analysis, only Statement II is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: II only.**
