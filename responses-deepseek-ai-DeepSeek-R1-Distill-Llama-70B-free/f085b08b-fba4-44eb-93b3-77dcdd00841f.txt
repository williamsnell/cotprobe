Okay, so I've got this problem about air flowing through a pipe, and I need to find the smallest diameter of the pipe based on certain conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question says that air is at 150°F and 20 psig, flowing at 900 cfm through a wrought iron pipe. The maximum pressure loss over 200 feet is 6 psi. The relative roughness (epsilon/D) is 0.0004. I need to find the smallest diameter from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that pressure loss in pipes is typically calculated using something like the Darcy-Weisbach equation or maybe the Hazen-Williams equation. But since this is for air, which is a gas, I might need to consider the compressibility. Or wait, maybe in this case, since the pressure isn't too high, we can treat it as incompressible? I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: perhaps using the Moody diagram for friction factors. Yeah, that sounds right.

Let me jot down the known values:

- Temperature, T = 150°F. I'll need to convert that to Rankine for gas calculations. So, T = 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 °R.

- Pressure, P = 20 psig. Converting that to absolute pressure, P_abs = 20 + 14.7 = 34.7 psia.

- Volumetric flow rate, Q = 900 cfm.

- Pipe length, L = 200 ft.

- Pressure loss, ΔP = 6 psi.

- Relative roughness, ε/D = 0.0004.

I'm thinking the Darcy-Weisbach equation is the way to go here. The equation is:

ΔP = (f * L * v^2) / (2gD)

Wait, but wait, that's for incompressible flow. Since this is air, a compressible fluid, maybe the equation needs a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps for this problem, it's acceptable to treat it as incompressible because the pressure isn't extremely high, and the pressure drop is only 6 psi over 200 feet, which might not cause a huge change in density.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the general form for gases. Oh, right! For gases, the pressure drop can be calculated considering compressibility, but it's often done using the Weymouth equation or the Panhandle equations. Or perhaps, for a more general approach, using the Darcy equation with the correct fluid properties.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Darcy-Weisbach equation is applicable to any fluid, including gases. So perhaps I can proceed with that, using the appropriate values for air.

So, I'll proceed with the Darcy equation:

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D)

Where:
- ΔP is the pressure drop (6 psi)
- f is the Darcy friction factor (which depends on Reynolds number and relative roughness)
- L is the pipe length (200 ft)
- ρ is the air density (lb/ft³)
- v is the flow velocity (ft/s)
- D is the pipe diameter (ft)

But wait, I don't have the velocity yet. I have the volumetric flow rate, Q. So velocity v is Q/A, where A is the cross-sectional area. But A depends on D, which is what we're trying to find. So this might get a bit circular.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of D and solve iteratively.

First, I need to find the density of air. At 150°F and 34.7 psia.

I recall that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So, for air, which behaves roughly as an ideal gas, the density ρ is (P M) / (R T), where M is the molar mass.

Wait, more accurately, the density in lb/ft³ can be calculated using the specific gas constant. The specific gas constant R for air is 1716 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R), but wait, maybe I should use the universal gas constant and compute it properly.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for air density:

ρ = (P * M) / (R * T)

Where:
- P is absolute pressure in psia,
- M is the molecular weight of air (approx 28.97 lb/lbmol),
- R is the universal gas constant, 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R),
- T is temperature in Rankine.

So, plugging in the numbers:

P = 34.7 psia
T = 609.67 °R
M = 28.97 lb/lbmol
R = 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R)

So:

ρ = (34.7 * 28.97) / (10.7316 * 609.67)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, numerator: 34.7 * 28.97 ≈ 34.7 * 29 ≈ 1005.3 lb·psia/lbmol.

Denominator: 10.7316 * 609.67 ≈ Let's compute 10 * 609.67 is 6096.7, and 0.7316 * 609.67 ≈ 445. So total ≈ 6096.7 + 445 = 6541.7 (approx) ft³·°R/(lbmol).

So ρ ≈ 1005.3 / 6541.7 ≈ 0.1537 lb/ft³.

Wait, that seems low. Hmm, let me check my calculation again.

Wait, let's compute the denominator more accurately.

10.7316 * 609.67 = ?

Let me compute 10 * 609.67 = 6096.7

0.7316 * 609.67:

Compute 0.7 * 609.67 = 426.769
0.0316 * 609.67 ≈ 19.24 (since 0.03 * 609.67=18.29, so 0.0316 is a bit more)
So total ≈ 426.769 + 19.24 ≈ 445.00 (approx)

So 6096.7 + 445.00 = 6541.7.

So, 1005.3 / 6541.7 ≈ 0.1537 lb/ft³.

Yes, that's correct. So the density of air is approximately 0.1537 lb/ft³.

Now, the flow rate Q is 900 cfm. Since 1 cfm is 1 ft³ per minute, Q is 900 ft³/min. To get the velocity, I need to convert the flow rate into ft³/s, because the units for velocity will be ft/s.

Wait, no, because the Darcy equation uses consistent units. Let's make sure all units are consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert Q into velocity.

Wait, the volumetric flow rate Q is 900 cfm, which is 900 ft³/min. To convert that to ft³/s, since there are 60 seconds in a minute, Q = 900 / 60 = 15 ft³/s.

Wait, no, wait! Q is 900 cfm, which is the volume flow rate. So in ft³/s, it's 900 divided by 60, which is 15 ft³/s.

But wait, no, that's not correct. Because 1 cfm is 1 ft³ per minute, so 900 cfm is 900 ft³ per minute. So per second, it's 900 / 60 = 15 ft³/s.

Wait, no, wait, 900 cfm is 900 cubic feet per minute. So per second, it's 900 / 60 = 15 cubic feet per second. So yes, Q = 15 ft³/s.

Now, the cross-sectional area A of the pipe is π D² / 4, where D is in feet. So velocity v = Q / A = (15) / ( (π D²)/4 ) = (15 *4) / (π D²) = 60 / (π D²) ft/s.

Wait, but D is in inches in the options, so maybe I should keep D in feet for the calculations.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to convert D to feet because the units for other variables are in feet.

So, velocity v = 60/(π D²) ft/s.

Now, I can plug this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is:

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 D)

We have ΔP = 6 psi, L = 200 ft, ρ = 0.1537 lb/ft³, v as above, and D is the diameter in ft.

Wait, but ΔP is given in psi, which I need to convert to lb/ft², because the other units are in the English system.

1 psi = 144 lb/ft² (since 1 lb/in² * 144 in²/ft² = 144 lb/ft²).

So ΔP = 6 psi = 6 * 144 = 864 lb/ft².

Now, substituting the values into the equation:

864 = (f * 200 * 0.1537 * (60/(π D²))²) / (2 D)

Let me simplify this equation step by step.

First, write down all the constants:

f is the friction factor, which depends on Reynolds number and the relative roughness.

But this equation has f and D in it, and D is what we're solving for. So I might need to express f in terms of Reynolds number, then in terms of D, and solve iteratively.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to rearrange the equation.

Let's write the equation as:

864 = (f * 200 * 0.1537 * (60^2) ) / ( 2 D * (π D^2)^2 ) )

Wait, let me compute each part.

Wait, v² is (60/(π D²))² = 3600 / (π² D^4).

So substituting:

864 = (f * 200 * 0.1537 * 3600) / (2 D * π² D^4 )

Wait, the denominator is 2 D multiplied by (π D²)^2, which is (π² D^4). So 2 D * π² D^4 = 2 π² D^5.

So numerator: f * 200 * 0.1537 * 3600.

So let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 200 * 0.1537 = 30.74. 30.74 * 3600 = 110,664. So 110,664 * f.

Denominator: 2 * π² * D^5.

So:

864 = (110664 * f) / (2 π² D^5 )

Simplify:

Multiply both sides by denominator:

864 * 2 π² D^5 = 110664 f

So,

1728 π² D^5 = 110664 f

Divide both sides by 1728 π²:

D^5 = (110664 f) / (1728 π² )

Simplify 110664 / 1728: Let's divide 110664 by 1728.

1728 * 64 = 110,592. Because 1728 * 60 = 103,680; 1728*4=6,912; 103680+6912=110,592. So 110,664 - 110,592 = 72. So 64 + (72/1728) = 64 + 0.041666... = 64.041666...

So 110664 / 1728 ≈ 64.0416667.

So,

D^5 ≈ (64.0416667 * f) / π²

Compute π² ≈ 9.8696.

So,

D^5 ≈ (64.0416667 * f) / 9.8696 ≈ (64.0416667 / 9.8696) * f ≈ 6.491 * f.

So,

D^5 ≈ 6.491 f

So,

D ≈ (6.491 f)^(1/5)

But f depends on Reynolds number and relative roughness.

Wait, so to find f, the friction factor, I need to determine the Reynolds number first. Reynolds number Re is given by:

Re = (V * D) / ν

Where V is the velocity, D is diameter, and ν is kinematic viscosity.

Wait, but I don't know ν for air at these conditions. Let me find that.

The viscosity of air at 150°F (which is 65.56°C) can be found from tables or approximated. I remember that at 60°F (15.56°C), the viscosity μ is about 0.00001806 lb/ft·s (or 1.86 x 10^-5 lb/ft·s). But temperature affects viscosity, which increases with temperature.

Wait, the kinematic viscosity ν is μ/ρ. So I have μ for air at 150°F.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or table. Alternatively, I can use an approximate value. Let me think: at 100°F, μ for air is about 0.0000209 lb/ft·s. At 200°F, it's about 0.0000235 lb/ft·s. So at 150°F, it's somewhere in between. Let me approximate it as 0.0000215 lb/ft·s.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for viscosity based on temperature.

Wait, I found that the viscosity of air can be approximated by the equation:

μ = 1.458 * 10^-5 * (T^1.5)/(T + 110.4) poise

But wait, that's in the Sutherland formula, and in centipoise. Let me make sure the units.

Wait, Sutherland's formula is:

μ = 1.458e-5 * T^(3/2) / (T + S) , where S = 110.4 K for air.

But T must be in Kelvin.

So, T in Kelvin is 609.67 °R * (5/9) = approximately 609.67 * 0.5555 ≈ 338.7 K.

So, T = 338.7 K.

So,

μ = 1.458e-5 * (338.7)^(1.5) / (338.7 + 110.4) 

Let me compute this.

First, compute (338.7)^(1.5). That's sqrt(338.7) * 338.7.

sqrt(338.7) is approx 18.42.

So 18.42 * 338.7 ≈ 18.42 * 300 = 5526, 18.42 * 38.7 ≈ 712. So total ≈ 5526 + 712 = 6238.

So numerator is 1.458e-5 * 6238 ≈ 1.458e-5 * 6e3 = 0.00008748, but precise calculation:

1.458e-5 = 0.00001458.

0.00001458 * 6238 ≈ 0.00001458 * 6000 = 0.08748, 0.00001458 * 238 ≈ 0.00347. So total ≈ 0.08748 + 0.00347 ≈ 0.09095.

Denominator is 338.7 + 110.4 = 449.1.

So μ = 0.09095 / 449.1 ≈ 0.0002024 lb/ft·s? Wait, no, wait, Sutherland's formula gives μ in poise, I think.

Wait, no, the original units: 1 poise = 1 dyne·s/cm². To convert to lb/ft·s:

1 poise = 0.000672 lb/ft·s (since 1 lb = 4.8825e4 dynes, 1 ft = 30.48 cm, so 1 lb/ft² = 4.8825e4 dynes / (30.48 cm)^2 ). Hmm, maybe it's better to look up the conversion.

Wait, 1 Pa·s = 1 kg/(m·s²) * s = kg/(m·s). Wait, that's not helping. Alternatively, 1 poise = 0.1 Pa·s.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that I'm getting the viscosity in poise, and then convert to lb/ft·s.

Wait, 1 poise = 0.000672 lb/ft·s. So if the calculation gives me μ in poise, I can convert it.

Wait, let me recompute the Sutherland formula correctly.

Wait, the Sutherland formula gives μ in (μ) = 1.458e-5 * T^(3/2)/(T + 110.4) where T is in Kelvin. But the unit is in Pa·s? Or in centiPoise?

Wait, no, the result is in Pa·s. Because 1 Pa·s = 10 poise. So the formula gives μ in Pa·s when T is in Kelvin.

Wait, no, I think the formula gives μ in μPa·s, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me double-check.

Upon checking, the Sutherland formula for μ in kg/(m·s) (which is equivalent to Pa·s) is:

μ = 1.458e-5 * (T^(3/2))/(T + 110.4) 

But wait, that's when T is in Kelvin. So, let me compute that.

So, T = 338.7 K.

Compute T^(3/2) = (338.7)^(1.5) = 338.7 * sqrt(338.7) ≈ 338.7 * 18.42 ≈ 6238.

Then, T + 110.4 = 338.7 + 110.4 = 449.1.

So,

μ = 1.458e-5 * (6238) / 449.1

Compute numerator: 1.458e-5 * 6238 ≈ 1.458 * 6238 * 1e-5.

1.458 * 6238 ≈ Let's compute 1 * 6238 = 6238, 0.4 * 6238 = 2495.2, 0.05*6238=311.9, 0.008*6238≈49.90.

Adding up: 6238 + 2495.2 = 8733.2; +311.
