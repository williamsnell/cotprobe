Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sulfuric acid solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is: How many grams of sulfuric acid are in 3.00 liters of a 0.500 N solution? They've given the molecular weight (MW) of H2SO4 as 98.1 g/mol. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, what's N mean here? Oh right, N stands for Normality. I remember that Normality is related to molarity but takes into account the number of replaceable ions or something like that. For acids, it depends on how many H+ ions they can donate. Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, right? So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. That means the normality is twice the molarity.

So, if the solution is 0.500 N, that means the molarity is 0.500 / 2 = 0.250 M. Because each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 equivalents.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. Normality (N) is equal to molarity (M) multiplied by the number of equivalents per formula unit. For H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid, each molecule can release two H+ ions, so each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 equivalents. So N = M × 2. So if N is 0.500, then M would be 0.500 / 2 = 0.250 M. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the next step is to find out how many moles of H2SO4 are in the solution. The formula is moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). The volume here is 3.00 liters.

So moles = 0.250 M * 3.00 L = 0.75 moles.

Wait, 0.25 times 3 is 0.75, right. So 0.75 moles of H2SO4.

Then, to find the mass in grams, I use the molecular weight. The molecular weight given is 98.1 g/mol. So mass = moles × MW.

Mass = 0.75 mol * 98.1 g/mol. Let's calculate that.

0.75 times 98 is 73.5, and 0.75 times 0.1 is 0.075. So adding together, 73.5 + 0.075 = 73.575 grams. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly 73.575. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

H is 73.5 g. That's very close. So that must be the answer.

Wait, did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Normality is 0.500 N for H2SO4. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, normality is 2 × molarity. So Molarity is 0.500 / 2 = 0.250 M. Volume is 3.00 L. Moles = 0.250 * 3 = 0.75. Mass is 0.75 * 98.1 = 73.575 g, which rounds to 73.6 g, but the option H is 73.5 g. So that's probably due to rounding the molecular weight. Because 98.1 is given as MW, so 0.75 ×98.1 is exactly 73.575, which would be approximately 73.6, but the option is 73.5. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should do the exact calculation.

Wait, 98.1 multiplied by 0.75. Let me compute it:

98.1 × 0.75 = ?

Let me think: 98 × 0.75 is 73.5, and 0.1 × 0.75 is 0.075. So total 73.575 grams. So 73.575 g, which is 73.58 when rounded to two decimal places. But the option H is 73.5 g. Oh, perhaps it's just rounded to the nearest tenth. So 73.575 would round to 73.6, but maybe the options have rounded differently. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be exact. Wait, let me compute 98.1 * 0.75 exactly.

98.1 * 0.75 = ?

Breaking it down:

98 * 0.75 = 73.5

0.1 * 0.75 = 0.075

73.5 + 0.075 = 73.575 grams.

So 73.575 grams. Now, looking at the options, H is 73.5 g. But option H is 73.5 g, which is exactly 73.5, which is 73.5 g. So why isn't it 73.6? Hmm, perhaps because the given MW is 98.1, which is three significant figures. Let me check the significant figures in the problem.

The problem gives 3.00 liters (three sig figs), 0.500 N (three sig figs), and MW 98.1 (three sig figs as well). So the calculation should be precise.

Wait, 0.75 mol is two sig figs? Because 0.250 M is three sig figs (since 0.500 N is three, and divided by 2 gives 0.250 which is three), and 3.00 L is three. So 0.250 *3.00 = 0.750, which is three sig figs. So 0.750 mol.

Then, 0.750 mol * 98.1 g/mol = ?

Let me compute that exactly.

98.1 * 0.750:

98.1 * 0.7 = 68.67

98.1 * 0.05 = 4.905

Adding them: 68.67 +4.905 = 73.575 grams.

So 73.575 g, which is approximately 73.58 g. So when rounding to three significant figures, it's 73.6 g. But the option H is 73.5 g, which is only two decimal places. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait another thought: Did I correctly convert Normality to Molarity? Because sometimes, for sulfuric acid, the normality can vary depending on the reaction. Wait, but sulfuric acid is a strong acid in its first dissociation and weak in the second. But when calculating normality, I think it's based on the total possible H+ ions. So for H2SO4, it's 2 equivalents per mole, so normality is 2 × molarity.

So yes, the initial step was correct. Then, the calculation seems correct.

Looking at the options again:

Option H is 73.5 g.

But my calculation is 73.575 g, which is 73.6 g when rounded to three significant figures. But none of the options have 73.6. H is 73.5, but wait, perhaps the options have rounded down. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, another approach:

Normality (N) = Molarity (M) × n, where n is the number of equivalents per mole.

For H2SO4, n is 2 because it can donate 2 H+ ions. So M = N / n = 0.500 / 2 = 0.250 M.

Then, moles = M × V = 0.250 M × 3.00 L = 0.750 mol.

Mass = moles × MW = 0.750 × 98.1 = 73.575 g. So 73.575 grams. So the closest option is H:73.5 g, but wait, 73.575 is closer to 73.6 than 73.5. Hmm, but perhaps the options are rounded to one decimal place, so 73.6 would be the correct value. But the option H is 73.5. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Maybe the normality is calculated differently. Wait, does sulfuric acid have more than two H+ ions in certain conditions? No, I think it's diprotic, so only two. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the volume is in liters. Yes, 3.00 liters. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for something else, like the grams per liter, but no, it's 3.00 liters.

Wait, perhaps I should compute again:

0.750 moles ×98.1 g/mol.

98.1 × 0.75 = ?

Well, 100 ×0.75 is 75. So 98.1 is 1.9 less than 100. So 1.9 ×0.75 = 1.425. So 75 - 1.425 = 73.575 grams. So that's correct.

So 73.575 grams. The options don't have 73.6, but option H is 73.5. Hmm, maybe the options are rounded down. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider significant figures again.

Wait, the given data has three significant figures: 3.00 liters, 0.500 N, 98.1 g/mol. So the result should have three sig figs.

So 73.575 rounded to three sig figs is 73.6 g. But the options don't have 73.6. So perhaps I made an error.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option H is 73.5 g.

Option G is 98.1 g.

Option D is 196.2 g.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normality to molarity conversion. Let me think again.

Wait, normality is the number of equivalents per liter. For H2SO4, each mole gives 2 equivalents, so normality is 2 × molarity.

So if a solution is 0.500 N, then molarity is 0.250 M. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: What if in the problem, the normality is given as 0.500 N for H2SO4, but perhaps it's being used as a diprotic acid, so maybe I should consider 2 equivalents, but perhaps the solution is considering only one? No, that's not right because H2SO4 is diprotic, so it's 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the acid as monoprotic? No, that would be wrong because sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first H+ and weak for the second, but for normality, it's based on total possible H+ ions, which is 2. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Hmm, maybe I should check the options again. Oh wait, option H is 73.5 g, which is 73.5. But my calculation is 73.575, which is 73.58 when rounded to two decimal places. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I should go with option H as the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 0.75 × 98.1 again.

0.75 × 98.1 = ?

Breaking it down:

98 × 0.75 = 73.5

0.1 × 0.75 = 0.075

Adding together: 73.5 + 0.075 = 73.575 g.

Yes, correct. So the exact value is 73.575 grams. Now, looking at the options, the closest is H:73.5 g. But wait, 73.575 is more than 73.5, so when rounded to three significant figures, it's 73.6, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the initial normality is considered differently.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is using the molarity directly without considering the diprotic nature. But that would be incorrect.

Wait, if someone mistakenly treats H2SO4 as a monoprotic acid, then normality would be equal to molarity. So 0.500 N would mean 0.500 M. Then, moles would be 0.500 × 3 = 1.5 moles. Mass would be 1.5 ×98.1 = 147.15 g, which is option F:147 g. But that's a higher value, which isn't the case here. So that's probably not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the density of the solution, but the problem doesn't provide density, so that's not applicable.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should check if the normality is for sulfuric acid as a base? No, that doesn't make sense because sulfuric acid is an acid, not a base.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the option closest to 73.575. Option H is 73.5 g. So that's probably the intended answer, even though it's not exact. Maybe the problem expects rounding down to three significant figures as 73.5 instead of 73.6, but that doesn't make sense because the third digit is 5, which would round up.

Wait, 73.575: the first three digits are 7,3,5. The next digit is 7, which is more than 5, so the third digit (5) would round up to 6. So it should be 73.6 g. But that's not an option. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the moles. Let me check that again.

Normality N = 0.500 = M × 2 → M = 0.250 M.

Volume V = 3.00 L.

Moles = M × V = 0.250 ×3.00 = 0.750 moles.

Yes, that's correct.

So the mass is 0.750 ×98.1 = 73.575 grams.

Wait, perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that's not the case here. Looking at the options again:

Options:

A: 102.5 g

B:24.5 g

C:88.2 g

D:196.2 g

E:29.4 g

F:147 g

G:98.1 g

H:73.5 g

I:49 g

J:55.3 g

Hmm, option H is 73.5, which is the closest to 73.575. So I think the correct answer is H:73.5 g.

To determine how many grams of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) are contained in 3.00 liters of a 0.500 N solution, we start by understanding the relationship between normality (N) and molarity (M). For sulfuric acid, which is a diprotic acid, each molecule can donate two H⁺ ions, so the normality is twice the molarity:

\[
N = 2 \times M \quad \Rightarrow \quad M = \frac{N}{2} = \frac{0.500}{2} = 0.250 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the number of moles of H₂SO₄ in the solution using the formula:

\[
\text{Moles} = M \times V = 0.250 \, \text{M} \times 3.00 \, \text{L} = 0.750 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Finally, we convert moles to grams using the molecular weight (MW) of H₂SO₄, which is given as 98.1 g/mol:

\[
\text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{MW} = 0.750 \, \text{mol} \times 98.1 \, \text{g/mol} = 73.575 \, \text{g}.
\]

When rounded to three significant figures, the mass is 73.6 g. However, the closest option provided is **73.5 g**, which corresponds to option H. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: 73.5 g.

**Answer: H**
