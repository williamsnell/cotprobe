Okay, so I need to figure out the right answer to this multiple-choice question about social development during adolescence. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking to briefly trace social development during adolescence. The options are from A to J, each describing different social behaviors or changes.

First, I should recall what I know about adolescent development. Adolescence is the period between childhood and adulthood, roughly from ages 12 to 18. During this time, there are significant physical, emotional, and social changes.

One key aspect of social development in adolescence is the shift from relying on parents to relying more on peers. Teens start to form their own identities, which often involves spending more time with friends and less time with family. They experiment with different roles and try to figure out who they are, separate from their parents.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Lesser focus on self-discovery. Wait, no, I think adolescence is all about self-discovery and figuring out their identity, so A might be incorrect.

Option B: Increased social isolation. I don't think that's right. While some teens might go through phases, generally they expand their social circles, not isolate. Unless it's a specific issue like depression, but that's not the general case.

Option C: More reliance on parents. No, the opposite is true. Teens usually start to rely less on parents and more on peers as they seek independence.

Option D: Declining interest in identity. No, establishing identity is a big part of this stage.

Option E: Increased independence from peers. That doesn't sound right. Teens typically become more influenced by peers, not less.

Option F: Heightened parental influence and less peer interaction. No, parents' influence decreases while peers' increases.

Option G: Reduced importance of peer acceptance. No, peer acceptance becomes more important during adolescence.

Option H: Focus on academic success. While some focus is there, the question is about social development, so this might not be the best fit.

Option I: Decreased ability to form relationships. No, they usually develop more close relationships, especially with peers.

Option J: Increased importance of social skills, less reliance on parents, more on peers. This sounds correct. During adolescence, social skills become crucial as they interact more with peers and form their identities. They rely less on parents and more on friends.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: increased importance of social skills, less reliance on parents, and more reliance on peers.

Answer: J
