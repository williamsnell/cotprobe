E: An implied condition of the photographer's duty of performance was that the mother reasonably cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this contracts question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a mother hiring a photographer. The contract says the photographer must produce a minimum of six acceptable photographs by August 15th and will be paid $200 for it.

The question is asking which statement is the least accurate regarding the photographer's duty. The options are A through I.

I remember that in contract law, both parties have duties. The photographer has to perform as agreed, but the other party (the mother here) must also cooperate. Because without her cooperation, the photographer can't do their job.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the photographer assumed the risk that the mother wouldn't cooperate. That makes sense because if the mother doesn't help, the photographer can't take the photos. So A seems accurate.

Option B states the mother has an implied duty to cooperate. Yes, because contracts imply good faith and cooperation. So B is correct.

Option C says the mother must ensure the child is cooperative. Hmm, that's tricky. The mother can try, but can she really control a two-year-old's behavior? Legally, does she have an obligation to make the child behave? I'm not sure. Maybe she has a duty to try, but not to ensure it. So C might be inaccurate.

Option D says the mother's failure would result in a full refund. Wait, the contract is about producing photos. If she doesn't cooperate, the photographer can't perform. So maybe the photographer doesn't have to refund the money because the mother breached by not cooperating. So D might be inaccurate.

Option E talks about an implied condition that the mother cooperates. That sounds right. Without cooperation, the photographer can't perform. So E is accurate.

Option F says the mother's refusal would excuse the photographer and allow them to sue. That makes sense because the mother's failure is a breach, so F is accurate.

Option G says the photographer must ensure professional quality. Well, the contract says "acceptable" photos, but I think photographers have an implied duty to meet standard professional quality. So G is correct.

Option H says the photographer can cancel if the mother isn't cooperating. I think that's right because the mother's cooperation is a condition. So H is accurate.

Option I says the photographer must take more than six if the mother isn't satisfied. The contract specifies a minimum of six acceptable photos. So if the mother isn't satisfied with six, the photographer isn't obliged to take more. So I is inaccurate.

Wait, so which is the least accurate statement? The question is about the photographer's taking of the photographs, so which statement is wrong about that.

Looking back, the question is about which is least accurate regarding the photographer's duty. So let's evaluate each:

Option C: Mother's obligation to ensure the child's cooperation. I'm not sure if the law requires the mother to make the child behave. She must cooperate, but maybe she doesn't have to ensure the child's cooperation. So C could be the inaccurate statement.

Option I: Photographer must take more than six. The contract says "a minimum of six," so if the mother isn't satisfied, the photographer doesn't have to take more. So I is wrong because the contract only requires at least six.

Option D: Full refund if mother doesn't cooperate. If the mother breaches, the photographer might not have to refund. So D is wrong.

So the options that could be incorrect are C, D, and I.

The question asks for the least accurate statement about the photographer's taking of the photographs.

Option C says the mother had a legal obligation to ensure the child was cooperative. I think the mother's duty is to cooperate, which includes making the child available and trying to help, but not ensuring the child behaves. So C is incorrect because she can't be held liable for the child's actions beyond her control.

Option I says the photographer must take more than six if the mother isn't satisfied. But the contract specifies a minimum, so if the mother isn't satisfied, the photographer still met the obligation by providing six. So I is incorrect.

So between C and I. The question is which is the least accurate regarding the photographer's duty.

Wait, the photographer's duty is to produce six acceptable photos. The mother's duty is to cooperate, but does that include ensuring the child's cooperation? Or just making reasonable efforts?

I think the mother must act reasonably to facilitate the photography. So if the child is uncooperative, as long as the mother tried, she's not in breach. So C is incorrect because it says she must ensure the child is cooperative, which she can't do. So C is the inaccurate statement.

But another point: option I says the photographer must take more than six if the mother isn't satisfied. The contract says a minimum of six, so the photographer isn't required to take more. So I is inaccurate.

So which is the least accurate? The question is about the photographer's taking of the photographs.

Looking at the options, the question is which statement is least accurate. So perhaps option I is incorrect because the photographer doesn't have to take more. So the least accurate statement is I.

Wait, the contract says the photographer must produce a minimum of six acceptable photographs. So if the mother isn't satisfied with the six, the photographer doesn't have to do more. So I is wrong.

So the answer would be I.

Wait, but the options are:

The question is which is the least accurate statement regarding the photographer's taking of the photographs.

So which options relate to the photographer's obligations. Let me see the options again.

Option I: The photographer was under an obligation to take more than six if the mother wasn't satisfied.

But the contract says "a minimum of six acceptable photographs." So if the mother isn't satisfied, perhaps because she doesn't like them, but they are acceptable, the photographer doesn't have to take more. So I is an incorrect statement.

Alternatively, if the photographs are not acceptable, then the photographer would have to retake. But if they are acceptable, even if the mother isn't satisfied, the photographer has fulfilled the obligation.

So I is inaccurate because the photographer isn't obliged to take more than six acceptable photos.

So the least accurate statement is I.

Wait, but the other options: Option C says the mother had a legal obligation to ensure the two-year-old was cooperative. That's probably not correct because the mother can't ensure a two-year-old's cooperation, but she must try. So C is incorrect.

So which is more incorrect between C and I?

The question is about the photographer's taking of the photographs. So I is about the photographer's obligation, while C is about the mother's.

The question is about which is least accurate regarding the photographer's actions.

So I is about the photographer's duty. So if the mother isn't satisfied, the photographer must take more, but the contract doesn't require that. So I is inaccurate.

So the least accurate statement is I.

To determine the least accurate statement regarding the photographer's taking of the photographs, we analyze each option in light of the contract and general principles of contract law:

- **Option A**: Accurate. The photographer assumes the risk of the mother's failure to cooperate, as this is a common risk in contracts requiring mutual performance.

- **Option B**: Accurate. The mother has an implied duty to act in good faith and cooperate reasonably with the photographer.

- **Option C**: Inaccurate. While the mother must cooperate, she cannot legally guarantee a two-year-old's behavior. Her duty is to make reasonable efforts, not ensure cooperation.

- **Option D**: Inaccurate. If the mother fails to cooperate, the photographer may not be obligated to refund the $200, as the mother's breach would relieve the photographer of their duty to perform.

- **Option E**: Accurate. The mother's reasonable cooperation is an implied condition of the contract, as it is necessary for the photographer to fulfill their obligation.

- **Option F**: Accurate. The mother's refusal to cooperate would excuse the photographer from further performance and allow them to sue for breach of contract.

- **Option G**: Accurate. The photographer has an implied duty to deliver photographs of professional quality, even though the contract specifies "acceptable" photographs.

- **Option H**: Accurate. The photographer can cancel the contract if the mother fails to cooperate, as her cooperation is a condition of the contract.

- **Option I**: Inaccurate. The contract specifies a "minimum of six acceptable photographs," so the photographer is not obligated to take more than six, even if the mother is unsatisfied with the initial results.

Between **Option C** and **Option I**, both are inaccurate, but **Option I** is less accurate because it directly pertains to the photographer's obligations under the contract. The contract explicitly limits the photographer's duty to producing six acceptable photographs, and there is no requirement to take additional photographs if the mother is unsatisfied. Therefore, **Option I** is the least accurate statement.

**Answer: I**
