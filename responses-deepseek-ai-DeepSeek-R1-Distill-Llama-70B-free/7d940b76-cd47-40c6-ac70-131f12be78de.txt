Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The problem says a particle of mass m is repelled from the origin by a force f equal to k divided by x cubed. So, the force equation is F = k/x³. The particle starts from rest at a distance x_0 from the origin. I need to solve the equation of motion and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Hmm, I remember that in mechanics, the equation of motion comes from Newton's second law. F equals mass times acceleration, right? So F = ma. But wait, force is also related to the derivative of momentum, but in this case, the mass is constant, so F = m dv/dt.

But since the force is given as a function of position, maybe it's easier to work with energy conservation. Oh wait, because the particle starts from rest, all the initial kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy will change as it moves.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this force is conservative. Let me think. A force is conservative if the work done around a closed path is zero. Since F is proportional to 1/x³, which is similar to the inverse square law but with a different exponent. But the inverse square law (like gravity or Coulomb's law) is conservative because it's a central force, and I can define a potential for it. So I think this force is also conservative.

If the force is conservative, then the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is conserved. Since the particle starts at rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero, so all the energy is potential. As it moves, the potential energy will convert into kinetic energy.

So I'll need to find the potential energy function V(x) corresponding to the force F.

The potential energy V is the integral of F with respect to x, but wait, F is the negative gradient of V. So actually, F = -dV/dx. Wait, wait, I need to be careful with the signs.

Wait no, the potential energy is defined such that the force is the negative gradient of the potential. So F = -dV/dx. So integrating F(x) gives V(x), except for a constant.

So let's compute V(x). The force is given as f = k/x³. Let me write F = k x^-3.

So V(x) would be the integral of F dx, but wait, no, because F is the negative gradient. So -dV/dx = F. So dV/dx = -F = -k/x³.

So V(x) is the integral of -k/x³ dx. Let's compute that.

The integral of x^n is (x^{n+1})/(n+1), so for n=-3, it would be (x^{-2})/(-2) = -x^{-2}/2.

Wait, let's see: ∫(1/x³) dx = ∫x^(-3) dx = (x^(-2))/(-2) + C = -1/(2x²) + C.

So dV/dx = -k/x³ → V(x) = ∫ (-k/x³) dx = ∫ -k x^{-3} dx.

So that's -k * [x^{-2}/(-2)] + C → (k/(2x²)) + C.

So V(x) = k/(2x²) + C. Since at x approaching infinity, the potential should go to zero (as the particle is free), so the constant C is zero. So V(x) = k/(2x²).

But wait, when the particle is at x_0, the potential is V(x_0) = k/(2x_0²). Since the particle is initially at rest, the total energy E is just this potential energy. So E = k/(2x_0²).

Now, as the particle moves, its kinetic energy plus potential energy equals E. So,

(1/2) m v² + (k/(2x²)) = k/(2x_0²).

Wait, but the force is repelling it, so the particle will move away from the origin. So x will increase over time.

But I'm not sure if this approach will directly give me x(t). Maybe I should consider the equation of motion using Newton's law.

Alternatively, think about writing the equation of motion in terms of position as a function of time.

So F = m a. F is the force, which is k/x³, and a is d²x/dt².

So m d²x/dt² = k / x³.

But this is a second-order differential equation, which might be a bit tricky to solve. Let's see.

Wait, maybe I can use conservation of energy to express velocity as a function of x, and then write a first-order equation.

From energy conservation:

(1/2) m v² = E - V(x) = [k/(2x_0²)] - [k/(2x²)].

Wait, no, because E is the total energy, so E = V(x_0) = k/(2x_0²), since initial KE is zero.

So,

(1/2) m v² = E - V(x) = [k/(2x_0²)] - [k/(2x²)].

Simplify that:

(1/2) m v² = (k/2)(1/x_0² - 1/x²).

Multiply both sides by 2:

m v² = k(1/x_0² - 1/x²).

But v is dx/dt, so v² = (dx/dt)^2.

So,

m (dx/dt)^2 = k (1/x_0² - 1/x²).

Let me rearrange this to get dx/dt in terms of x.

So,

(dx/dt)^2 = [k/m] (1/x_0² - 1/x²).

Take square roots:

dx/dt = sqrt( [k/m] (1/x_0² - 1/x²) )

Hmm. But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can separate variables and integrate.

So,

dt = dx / sqrt( [k/m] (1/x_0² - 1/x²) ) )

But integrating this seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider using the substitution u = 1/x. Then, du/dt = - (1/x²) dx/dt.

Wait, let's try that substitution.

Let u = 1/x → x = 1/u → dx = - (1/u²) du.

Let me compute dx/dt:

dx/dt = - (1/u²) du/dt.

Then, d²x/dt² is the derivative of dx/dt with respect to time.

So,

d²x/dt² = d/dt ( - (1/u²) du/dt )

= (2/u³ (du/dt)^2) + (1/u²) d²u/dt² )

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute it step by step.

First, dx/dt = - (1/u²) du/dt.

So,

d²x/dt² = d/dt [ - (1/u²) du/dt ]

= (d/dt)( -u^{-2} ) * du/dt + ( -u^{-2} ) * d²u/dt²

= (2 u^{-3} du/dt) * du/dt ) + (-u^{-2}) d²u/dt²

= 2 (du/dt)^2 / u^3 - (1/u²) d²u/dt².

Hmm, perhaps substituting u into the original equation.

The original equation is m d²x/dt² = k/x³ → m d²x/dt² = k u³.

Substituting the expression for d²x/dt²:

m [ 2 (du/dt)^2 / u^3 - (1/u²) d²u/dt² ] = k u³.

Multiply through by u^3 to eliminate denominators:

m [ 2 (du/dt)^2 - u d²u/dt² ] = k u^6.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helping much. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider another substitution or approach.

Wait, perhaps we can write the differential equation in terms of x and t, and see if it can be made separable.

Alternatively, let's think about writing the equation in terms of velocity and position. Since we have v = dx/dt, maybe we can express the equation using v as a function of x.

From Newton's law:

m dv/dt = k / x³.

But dv/dt is d(v)/dt = d(v)/dx * dx/dt = v dv/dx.

So,

m v dv/dx = k / x³.

Hmm, that's a first-order differential equation.

So,

v dv = (k/m) (1/x³) dx.

Integrate both sides.

Left side: ∫ v dv = (1/2) v² + C.

Right side: (k/m) ∫ (1/x³) dx = (k/m) [ (-1)/(2x²) ) ] + C.

So,

(1/2) v² = - (k)/(2 m x²) + C.

But we have initial conditions: at t=0, x = x_0, and v=0 (since it starts from rest).

So, substituting x = x_0, v=0:

0 = -k/(2 m x_0²) + C → C = k/(2 m x_0²).

So,

(1/2) v² = [k/(2 m x_0²)] - [k/(2 m x²) ].

Multiply both sides by 2:

v² = [k/(m x_0²)] - [k/(m x²) ].

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

v = dx/dt = sqrt( [k/m (1/x_0² - 1/x²) ] )

Hmm, but this is similar to what I had before. So, to find x(t), I need to solve this differential equation.

Let me write it as:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k/m) (1/x_0² - 1/x²) )

Let me rearrange terms:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k/m) [ (x² - x_0²) / (x_0² x²) ] )

= sqrt( (k/m) (x² - x_0²) ) / (x x_0 sqrt(1/m k) )) ??? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute it step by step.

Wait, 1/x_0² - 1/x² = (x² - x_0²)/(x^2 x_0²).

So,

sqrt( (k/m) * (x² - x_0²)/(x^2 x_0^2) ) )

= sqrt( (k (x² - x_0²)) / (m x^2 x_0²) ) )

= sqrt( k (x² - x_0²) ) / (x x_0 sqrt(m) )

Wait, let me factor out the terms:

sqrt( (k/m) ) * sqrt( (x² - x_0²) ) / (x x_0 )

So,

dx/dt = [ sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(x² - x_0²) ] / (x x_0 )

Hmm, this is getting a bit involved. Let me try to separate variables and integrate.

So,

dx = [ sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(x² - x_0²) ] / (x x_0 ) dt.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

dt = [ x x_0 / ( sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(x² - x_0²) ) ] dx.

So, integrating both sides from x = x_0 to x(t), and t from 0 to T.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to integrate this. Let me think about substitution.

Let me set y = x^2. Then dy = 2x dx → dx = dy/(2x) = dy/(2 sqrt(y)).

But let me try to express the integral.

The integral for t would be:

t = ∫ (from x_0 to x) [ m x'^2 / (k (x'^2 - x_0^2)) ) ] dx' 

Wait, maybe not. Let me reorganize the equation.

From the expression for dx/dt:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k/m) (1/x_0² - 1/x²) )

= sqrt( (k/m) (x² - x_0^2) / (x^2 x_0^2) ) )

= sqrt( (k (x² - x_0^2)) / (m x^2 x_0^2) ) )

= (1/(x x_0)) sqrt( k (x² - x_0^2) / m )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

dx/dt = (1/(x x_0)) * sqrt( [k/m] (x^2 - x_0^2) )

Hmm, maybe I can make a substitution like u = x^2, then du = 2x dx.

Wait, but let me proceed.

Let me write the differential equation as:

dt = (x x_0) / [ sqrt( (k/m)(x^2 - x_0^2) ) ] dx.

So,

t = ∫ (from x_0 to x) [ x' x_0 / sqrt( (k/m)(x'^2 - x_0^2) ) ] dx'

Factor out constants:

t = (x_0 sqrt(m/k)) ∫ (from x_0 to x) [ x' / sqrt(x'^2 - x_0^2) ] dx'

Hmm, that integral looks manageable. Let me compute the integral ∫ [x' / sqrt(x'^2 - a^2) ] dx', where a = x_0.

Let me set u = x'^2 - a^2 → du = 2x' dx'.

So, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ u^(-1/2) du = sqrt(u) + C.

So,

∫ [x' / sqrt(x'^2 - a^2) ] dx' = sqrt(x'^2 - a^2) + C.

So, applying the limits from x_0 to x:

At x, it's sqrt(x^2 - x_0^2), and at x_0, it's sqrt(x_0^2 - x_0^2) = 0.

So the integral evaluates to sqrt(x^2 - x_0^2).

So,

t = x_0 sqrt(m/k) * sqrt(x² - x_0² )

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

t² = (x_0² m/k) (x² - x_0² )

Multiply both sides by (k/(x_0² m)):

t² (k) / (x_0² m) ) = x² - x_0²

Bring x_0² to the left:

x² = x_0² + [k t²]/(x_0² m)

Factor x_0² out of the square root:

x² = x_0² [ 1 + (k t²)/(m x_0^4) ) ]

So,

x = x_0 sqrt( 1 + (k t^2)/(m x_0^4) )

Wait, but none of the options look exactly like this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option J: x = sqrt( x_0² + (2kt^2/m) )

Wait, my expression is x^2 = x_0² + (k t^2)/(m x_0² )

Wait, that's x squared equals x_0 squared plus (k t squared) over (m x_0 squared) times 1.

So,

x = sqrt( x_0² + [k t²/(m x_0²)] )

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is [x_0² + (kt^2/(m x_0²))]^½, which matches this.

Wait, option A is x = [x_0² + (kt^2/(m x_0²))]^½.

Yes, that seems to match.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-examine the steps because I might have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, when I did the substitution u = 1/x, the equation became complicated. So I tried another approach and arrived at x squared equals x_0 squared plus (k t squared)/(m x_0 squared).

So, x = sqrt( x_0² + [k t²/(m x_0²)] )

Which is option A.

But let me check the other steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, in the integration step, when I set y = x^2, or when I made the substitution u = x'^2 - x_0^2, that should have been correct.

Wait, when I had t = x_0 sqrt(m/k) ∫ [x' / sqrt(x'^2 -x_0^2)] dx'

The integral of [x dx / sqrt(x² - a²)] is indeed sqrt(x² -a²) + C.

So, the integral from x_0 to x gives sqrt(x^2 -x_0^2).

So, t = x_0 sqrt(m/k) * sqrt(x² -x_0^2 )

Then, square both sides:

t² = (x_0² m/k)(x² - x_0² )

Wait, that would give x² = x_0² + (k t²)/(m x_0² )

Yes, that's correct.

So, x = sqrt( x_0² + (k t^2)/(m x_0²) )

Which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: x = [x_0² + (kt²/(m x_0²))]^½ → correct.

Option J: x = [x_0² + (2kt²/m)]^½ → that would be if the term were (2kt²/m), but our term is (kt²)/(m x_0²).

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, another check. Let me think about the dimensions to make sure the terms are consistent.

In the expression under the square root, all terms must have dimensions of [L]^2.

x_0² has [L]^2.

The second term is (kt²)/(m x_0²).

Let's compute the dimensions:

Force F has dimensions [M][L][T]^{-2}
