Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with kinematics equations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

So, there's a race car that needs to jump over 8 buses. The setup is on a flat track with a ramp at the end. The engineers say the car must reach a velocity of 130 km/h. The track's distance is 50 meters, and I need to find the acceleration required to reach that velocity. The options are from A to J, each with different acceleration values.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with constant acceleration, we can use the kinematic equations. One of them is v squared equals u squared plus 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is acceleration, and s is the distance.

Wait, but what's the initial velocity here? The problem doesn't say, but I think it's starting from rest, so u would be zero. That simplifies things because the equation becomes v² = 2as.

Right, so I can rearrange that to solve for a, the acceleration. So a would be v squared divided by (2 times s).

But wait, the velocity given is in km/h, and the distance is in meters. I need to convert km/h to m/s because the standard SI unit for acceleration is m/s².

How do I convert 130 km/h to m/s? I remember that 1 m/s is 3.6 km/h. So to get m/s, I divide by 3.6. Let me calculate that: 130 divided by 3.6. Let's see, 130 ÷ 3.6 is approximately 36.111 m/s. Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3.6 times 36 is 129.6, so 130 would be around 36.11 m/s. Okay, so v is approximately 36.11 m/s.

Now plug the numbers into the equation. a equals v squared divided by (2s). v is 36.11, s is 50 meters.

So, v squared is (36.11)^2. Let me calculate that. 36 squared is 1296, and 0.11 squared is about 0.0121, but wait, it's (36 + 0.11)^2 which is 36² + 2*36*0.11 + 0.11². So 1296 + 7.92 + 0.0121 = approximately 1303.9321 m²/s².

Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 36.11 by itself. 36 times 36 is 1296, 36 times 0.11 is 3.96, so 36.11 * 36.11 = (36 + 0.11)^2 = 36² + 2*(36)*(0.11) + 0.11² = 1296 + 7.92 + 0.0121 = 1303.9321. Yeah, that's correct.

So a = 1303.9321 / (2 * 50) = 1303.9321 / 100 = 13.039321 m/s². So approximately 13.04 m/s².

Looking at the options, option H is 13 m/s². Option D is 20, which is higher. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when converting units, it's easy to slip up.

130 km/h to m/s: 130 divided by 3.6. Let me calculate that more precisely. 3.6 times 36 is 129.6, so 130 is 36.111... So that's correct.

v squared is (36.111)^2 which is approximately 1303.932. Divided by (2*50) which is 100. So 1303.932/100 = 13.03932, which rounds to about 13.04 m/s².

So the correct answer should be H: 13 m/s².
</think>

To determine the acceleration required for the race car to reach a velocity of 130 km/h over a 50 m track, we use the kinematic equation:

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]

Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity \( u = 0 \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
v^2 = 2as
\]

Rearranging for \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{2s}
\]

The velocity \( v \) is given in km/h, so it must be converted to m/s. Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{m/s} = 3.6 \, \text{km/h} \):

\[
v = \frac{130}{3.6} \approx 36.11 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Substituting \( v = 36.11 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( s = 50 \, \text{m} \) into the equation:

\[
a = \frac{(36.11)^2}{2 \cdot 50}
\]

First, calculate \( v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = (36.11)^2 \approx 1303.93 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Then, calculate \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{1303.93}{100} \approx 13.04 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

From the given options, the closest value to \( 13.04 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is \( 13 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which corresponds to option H.
