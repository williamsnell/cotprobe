Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stakeholder theory. The question is asking about the three differing types according to Donaldson and Preston from 1995. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that stakeholder theory is about how companies should consider the interests of various groups affected by their actions, not just shareholders. But the specific types... I think Donaldson and Preston categorized them into different approaches.

Wait, I recall that they proposed three types. Let me see. One of them is definitely normative. Normative stakeholder theory is about the moral principles, like why stakeholders should be considered—because it's the right thing to do.

Then there's the descriptive type. That's more about how companies actually operate and who they consider in their decisions. So it's descriptive in the sense of describing what's happening in practice.

The third one, I'm a bit unsure. I think it's either instrumental or political. Instrumental would be about the practical benefits of considering stakeholders—like how it can improve performance or profits. Political might relate to power dynamics among stakeholders, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the three are normative, descriptive, and instrumental. Because normative is the moral case, descriptive is the actual practices, and instrumental is about the outcomes or benefits. So putting that together, the types are normative, descriptive, and instrumental.

Looking at the options, option H says Normative, Descriptive, and Instrumental. Option C is Normative, Moral, and Instrumental, but I don't think 'moral' is one of them—probably normative covers that. Option D is Normative, Descriptive, and Political, which includes political, but I thought it was instrumental.

So I think the correct answer is option H.

The question asks about the three types of stakeholder theory according to Donaldson and Preston (1995). Based on the reasoning, the types are Normative, Descriptive, and Instrumental. Normative focuses on moral principles, Descriptive on actual practices, and Instrumental on practical benefits. Among the options, H matches these categories.

Answer: H
