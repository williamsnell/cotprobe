Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about finding the force acting on a 1000-gram mass sliding down an inclined plane. Hmm, I remember that force relates to mass and acceleration, right? Oh wait, Newton's second law: F = ma. But wait, I need to find the acceleration first.

The mass is 1000 grams. Oh, wait, I should convert that to kilograms because standard units are usually in kg and meters. 1000 grams is 1 kg. Easy enough.

The inclined plane is 81 centimeters long. Oh right, centimeters to meters: 81 cm is 0.81 meters. Got it.

The time taken is 0.60 seconds. Oh, and it starts from rest, so initial velocity is zero. So, it's uniformly accelerated motion from rest.

I think I can use the kinematic equation here. The equation that relates distance, acceleration, and time when starting from rest is: s = 0.5 * a * t². Yeah, that's the one. Solving for a.

So, s is 0.81 m, t is 0.6 s. Let's plug in the numbers.

0.81 = 0.5 * a * (0.6)^2.

Wait, let me compute (0.6)^2 first. That's 0.36. So,

0.81 = 0.5 * a * 0.36.

0.5 * 0.36 is 0.18. So,

0.81 = 0.18 * a.

To find a, divide both sides by 0.18. So,

a = 0.81 / 0.18.

Let me calculate that. 0.81 divided by 0.18 is 4.5 m/s². Oh, that's the acceleration.

Now, F = ma. The mass is 1 kg, so F = 1 * 4.5 = 4.5 Newtons.

Wait, but the options are in dynes. Oh right, 1 Newton is 10^5 dynes. So, 4.5 N is 4.5e5 dynes. That's 450,000 dynes.

Let me look at the options. Option G is 450,000 dynes. So that must be the answer.

To determine the force acting on the 1000-gram mass sliding down the inclined plane, we use Newton's second law: **F = ma**. Here, the mass is 1000 grams, which is equivalent to 1 kg. The inclined plane is 81 cm long, or 0.81 meters, and the time taken is 0.60 seconds. Since the object starts from rest, we can use the kinematic equation for uniformly accelerated motion:  

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

Substituting \(s = 0.81 \, \text{m}\) and \(t = 0.6 \, \text{s}\):  

\[
0.81 = \frac{1}{2} a (0.6)^2
\]

First, calculate \((0.6)^2 = 0.36\), then multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):  

\[
0.81 = 0.18 \cdot a
\]

Solving for \(a\):  

\[
a = \frac{0.81}{0.18} = 4.5 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Now, using \(F = ma\):  

\[
F = 1 \cdot 4.5 = 4.5 \, \text{N}
\]

Since \(1 \, \text{N} = 10^5 \, \text{dynes}\), the force in dynes is:  

\[
F = 4.5 \cdot 10^5 = 450,000 \, \text{dynes}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **G: 450,000 dynes**.  

**Answer: G**
