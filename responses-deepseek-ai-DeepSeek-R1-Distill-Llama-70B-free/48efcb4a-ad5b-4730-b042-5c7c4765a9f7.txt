Okay, so I have this question here about who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." The options are from A to J, each being a different legal theorist or philosopher. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that jurisprudence is the study of law, so the quote is probably from someone who contributed significantly to legal theory. Let me go through each name one by one.

Option A is Pound. Roscoe Pound was an American legal scholar known for his work on sociological jurisprudence. I don't recall him saying anything about the "eye of law," but I'm not certain.

Option B is Austin. John Austin was a key figure in legal positivism. He's known for defining law as the command of a sovereign. I don't think the quote is his, but I'm not sure.

Option C is Savigny. Friedrich Carl von Savigny was a German legal historian and a major figure in the historical school of law. His work focused on the organic growth of law. The quote doesn't ring a bell with him.

Option D is Hart. H.L.A. Hart was a British legal philosopher known for "The Concept of Law." He talked about primary and secondary rules, but I don't remember this specific quote from him.

Option E is Bentham. Jeremy Bentham was a utilitarian and the founder of modern legal positivism. He's famous for the phrase "the greatest happiness for the greatest number." Doesn't seem to match the quote.

Option F is Dworkin. Ronald Dworkin was known for his theory of law as integrity and the idea that "the law is a seamless web." I don't think he used the "eye" metaphor.

Option G is Blackstone. William Blackstone wrote "Commentaries on the Laws of England," which was very influential. He structured his work in a way that systematized English law, so maybe he used a metaphor like the eye to describe jurisprudence as a way to see or understand the law clearly.

Option H is Laski. Harold Laski was a political theorist, more into pluralism and the state. I don't think he's associated with that quote.

Option I is Kelsen. Hans Kelsen was known for the pure theory of law, focusing on the hierarchical structure of legal norms. Again, I don't recall that quote from him.

Option J is Maine. Henry Maine wrote about the movement from status to contract in societies. He's known for historical legal theories, but I'm not sure about the quote.

Now, thinking about the phrase "the eye of law," it sounds like it's describing jurisprudence as the part that helps see or understand the law clearly. Blackstone's work was all about making the law accessible and understandable, so maybe he used this metaphor. Alternatively, could it be someone else?

I'm trying to remember if any of the other thinkers used such a metaphor. Pound might have, but I'm not certain. Wait, I think Blackstone actually did refer to jurisprudence as the "eye" because he wanted to shed light on the law, making it clear and understandable. So I'm leaning towards G: Blackstone.

The quote "Jurisprudence is the eye of law" suggests that jurisprudence serves as a means to understand and clarify the law. After evaluating each option, William Blackstone stands out as the likely source. His influential work, "Commentaries on the Laws of England," aimed to systematize and make English law accessible, aligning with the metaphor of jurisprudence as the "eye" that illuminates the law.
