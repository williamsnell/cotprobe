Okay, so I'm trying to solve this optics problem about pupils and image formation. Hmm, let me read the question again and try to visualize what's going on.

So, there's a circular aperture that's 1 cm in diameter acting as an entrance pupil. This aperture is placed halfway between an extended light source and a lens. The lens has a focal length of 10 cm. The image is projected onto a screen that's 14 cm away from the lens. The question is asking for the diameter of the exit pupil.

Wait, I remember that the entrance pupil and exit pupil are related in an optical system. The entrance pupil is basically the aperture that light first enters through, and the exit pupil is where the light exits towards the image. The size of the exit pupil depends on the magnification of the system, I think.

Let me try to break this down step by step. First, I need to understand the setup. The light source is extended, so it's like an object at a certain position relative to the lens. The aperture is halfway between the source and the lens. So if the source is at some distance, the aperture is right in the middle. Wait, but what's the exact position?

Wait, the problem says the aperture is halfway between the extended light source and the lens. So if the distance between the source and the lens is D, then the aperture is at D/2 from both the source and the lens.

But wait, in optics, the object distance is usually measured from the lens. So if the aperture is halfway between the source (object) and the lens, then the object distance (u) is twice the distance from the aperture to the lens. Because, say, the aperture is at a distance s from the lens, then the object is at 2s from the lens.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think. Let's say the distance between the object (source) and the lens is L. The aperture is placed halfway, so it's at L/2 from the object and L/2 from the lens. So the object distance u is L/2, but wait, no. Wait, the object distance is from the lens to the object. So if the total distance between object and lens is L, then the object is at u = L (on one side of the lens), and the aperture is at L/2 from the lens on the object side. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's imagine the object is at a distance u from the lens. The entrance pupil is placed at a distance of u/2 from the lens, making it halfway between the object and the lens. So the object is at u, the entrance pupil is at u/2 from the lens, and then the lens is at position zero. The screen is on the image side, 14 cm from the lens.

Wait, but wait—the problem says that the aperture is placed halfway between the extended light source and the lens. So the distance between the source and the lens is, say, D. So the entrance pupil is D/2 away from the source and D/2 away from the lens. So the object distance u is D/2 + D/2 = D? No, wait: the object distance is the distance from the lens to the object, which would be D/2 in this setup. Because if the entrance pupil is halfway, then the object is D/2 away from the lens.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign variables. Let me define u as the object distance (distance from object to lens). Then the entrance pupil is at a distance of u/2 from the lens, because it's halfway between the object and the lens. So the object is at u, the entrance pupil is at u/2 from the lens, on the object side.

But wait, no. If the object is at u, then halfway would be at u/2. So the entrance pupil is at u/2 from the object and u/2 from the lens. So the object distance is u = distance from lens to object.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the thin lens formula. The image distance v is given as 14 cm because the screen is 14 cm from the lens. The lens has a focal length f of 10 cm. So using the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

We have f = 10 cm, v =14 cm. So plug into the equation:

1/10 = 1/u + 1/14.

Let me compute 1/u. 1/u = (1/10) - (1/14) = (14 -10)/(140) )= 4/140 = 1/35. So u = 35 cm.

So the object distance is 35 cm. That means the distance from the lens to the object is 35 cm. So the entrance pupil is halfway between the object and the lens. So the entrance pupil is at 35/2 = 17.5 cm from the lens, on the object side.

Wait, but the entrance pupil is an aperture that's acting as the entrance; so the object is at u =35 cm from the lens, and the entrance pupil (aperture) is at 17.5 cm from the lens. So the object is beyond the entrance pupil; the light from the object passes through the entrance pupil, then through the lens, and forms an image on the screen at 14 cm.

Now, the question is about the exit pupil. The exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil as seen from the image side. So its size can be determined by considering the magnification between the entrance pupil and the exit pupil.

The magnification for pupils is related to the ratio of their distances from the lens. Wait, but how?

I remember that the exit pupil diameter D_exit is related to the entrance pupil diameter D_entrance by the ratio of the image distance to the object distance for the pupil. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, maybe I should model the entrance pupil as an object for the lens, and find where its image is. Because the exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil formed by the lens.

So the entrance pupil is located at a distance of u_pupil =17.5 cm from the lens on the object side. The lens has focal length f=10 cm. So using the thin lens equation again, but now the object is the entrance pupil.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the entrance pupil is not the object; the actual object is the extended source, which is at u=35 cm. The entrance pupil is just an aperture in between. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the exit pupil is formed by the image of the entrance pupil. So the entrance pupil is at a distance of 17.5 cm from the lens, so to find its image, we can compute the image distance using the lens formula.

Let me think: for the entrance pupil as an object, the object distance is u_p =17.5 cm, f=10 cm. So 1/f = 1/u_p + 1/v_p.

So 1/v_p = 1/f - 1/u_p = (1/10) - (1/17.5) = Let me compute:

1/10 is 0.1, 1/17.5 is approximately 0.05714. So 0.1 - 0.05714 = 0.04286. So 1/v_p = 0.04286, so v_p ≈ 23.333 cm.

Wait, that would be the image distance for the entrance pupil's image. So the exit pupil is 23.333 cm from the lens on the image side.

But wait, the image of the actual object (the source) is at 14 cm. So the exit pupil is beyond that? Because 23 cm is longer than 14 cm. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the image is formed at 14 cm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding where the exit pupil is located.

Wait, perhaps the exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil. So when the actual object is at u=35 cm, and the entrance pupil is at 17.5 cm from the lens, the image of the entrance pupil (exit pupil) is at v_p = (from the calculation above) 23.333 cm. But the image of the actual object is at 14 cm, which is less than 23.333 cm.

So this suggests that the exit pupil is located beyond the image plane. But in reality, the image is formed on the screen at 14 cm, so perhaps the exit pupil is virtual? Or maybe I'm mixing up concepts here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of magnification. The exit pupil's diameter is the entrance pupil's diameter multiplied by the magnification of the system. Hmm, but what's the magnification?

Wait, in optics, the magnification m is given by m = v/u, where v is the image distance and u is the object distance. But wait, that's for the object. But for the pupils, perhaps it's similar.

Alternatively, the ratio of the exit pupil diameter to entrance pupil diameter is equal to the ratio of the image distance to the object distance of the entrance pupil. So D_exit = D_entrance * (v_p / u_p ), where v_p is the image distance for the entrance pupil, and u_p is the object distance for the entrance pupil.

Wait, but in this case, u_p is 17.5 cm, and v_p is 23.333 cm. So the ratio is 23.333 /17.5 = 1.3333. So D_exit = 1 cm * 1.3333 ≈ 1.333 cm. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 1.33 cm, which would be the answer.

But wait, earlier I thought the exit pupil is at 23.33 cm from the lens, but the image is at 14 cm. So does that mean that the exit pupil is beyond the image? That doesn't seem right because the image is formed on the screen, which is at 14 cm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the exit pupil is not formed by treating the entrance pupil as an object, but perhaps it's related to the image formation in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil. So the entrance pupil is at u_p =17.5 cm from the lens. Using the lens formula, the image is at v_p = (f * u_p) / (u_p - f). Plugging in f=10 cm and u_p=17.5 cm:

v_p = (10 *17.5)/(17.5 -10) = 175 /7.5 ≈ 23.333 cm, same as before.

So the image of the entrance pupil (the exit pupil) is at 23.333 cm from the lens on the image side. Now, the actual image is formed at 14 cm. So the exit pupil is beyond the image plane. But how does that affect the diameter?

Wait, but the exit pupil's size can be determined by the magnification between the entrance pupil and its image. So the magnification m is v_p / u_p = 23.333 /17.5 ≈1.333. So the exit pupil is 1.333 times larger than the entrance pupil. Since the entrance pupil is 1 cm, the exit would be 1.333 cm, so option G.

But wait, wait a minute. The image is at 14 cm. So when you're projecting the image, the light rays form an image at 14 cm. The exit pupil is the location from where the rays appear to diverge to form the image. So if the exit pupil is at 23.33 cm, but the image is at 14 cm, that would mean that the exit pupil is virtual, behind the image, because 23.33 is greater than 14. So perhaps the exit pupil is a virtual image, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation of its size.

Alternatively, perhaps the exit pupil's size is determined by the ratio of the image distance to the object distance of the actual object. Wait, the object is at u=35 cm, image at v=14 cm. So the magnification is m = v/u =14/35 = 0.4. Hmm, but that's the magnification of the object, not the pupil. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: The entrance pupil is at u_p =17.5 cm, so the magnification for the pupil is m_p = v_p/u_p. We found v_p=23.333, so m_p=23.333/17.5≈1.333. So the exit pupil is 1.333 times the entrance pupil, so 1.333 cm. Which is option G.

But wait, another approach: The exit pupil is formed by the image of the entrance pupil. Since the entrance pupil is at u_p=17.5 cm, the image is at v_p=23.333 cm, so the magnification is positive, meaning it's real and upright. Wait, but the image is formed beyond the focal point because v_p > f.

So the exit pupil is real and located at 23.333 cm. Now, the image of the actual object is at 14 cm, which is less than 23.333 cm, so the exit pupil is beyond the image. So when looking at the image from the screen side, the light appears to come from the exit pupil at 23.333 cm, but the image is formed at 14 cm.

Wait, but in terms of the size, the calculation seems correct. The exit pupil's diameter is 1.333 cm.

So looking at the options, option G is 1.33 cm, which would be the answer.

To determine the diameter of the exit pupil, we analyze the optical system as follows:

1. **Setup and Key Distances**:  
   - The entrance pupil (aperture) has a diameter of 1 cm and is placed halfway between the extended light source (object) and the lens.  
   - The lens has a focal length \( f = 10 \, \text{cm} \), and the image is projected onto a screen \( v = 14 \, \text{cm} \) from the lens.  

2. **Object Distance**:  
   Using the thin lens equation:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
   \]  
   Substituting \( f = 10 \, \text{cm} \) and \( v = 14 \, \text{cm} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{14} = \frac{14 - 10}{140} = \frac{4}{140} = \frac{1}{35}
   \]  
   Thus, \( u = 35 \, \text{cm} \). The object is \( 35 \, \text{cm} \) from the lens.  

3. **Entrance Pupil Position**:  
   The entrance pupil is halfway between the object and the lens, so its distance from the lens is:  
   \[
   u_p = \frac{u}{2} = \frac{35}{2} = 17.5 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  

4. **Exit Pupil as the Image of the Entrance Pupil**:  
   The exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil, formed by the lens. Using the thin lens equation for the entrance pupil as the object:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u_p} + \frac{1}{v_p}
   \]  
   Substituting \( f = 10 \, \text{cm} \) and \( u_p = 17.5 \, \text{cm} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{v_p} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u_p} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{17.5} = 0.1 - 0.05714 = 0.04286
   \]  
   Thus, \( v_p = \frac{1}{0.04286} \approx 23.333 \, \text{cm} \). The exit pupil is \( 23.333 \, \text{cm} \) from the lens on the image side.  

5. **Magnification and Exit Pupil Diameter**:  
   The magnification of the pupil is given by:  
   \[
   m_p = \frac{v_p}{u_p} = \frac{23.333}{17.5} \approx 1.333.
   \]  
   The diameter of the exit pupil is the diameter of the entrance pupil multiplied by this magnification:  
   \[
   D_{\text{exit}} = D_{\text{entrance}} \cdot m_p = 1 \cdot 1.333 \approx 1.333 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  

6. **Final Answer**:  
   Comparing with the options, the closest value is \( 1.33 \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to **option G**.
