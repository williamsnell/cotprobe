Question:

A farm and an orchard are adjoining tracts of land located in a county. In 2006, a farmer purchased the farm, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The orchard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the farm, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the farm under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the orchard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the orchard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the orchard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $250,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher farmer deed nor the farmer  investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the farm. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that both the farm and the orchard abut a public highway and that ingress and egress are afforded the investor by that highway. In an appropriate action by the investor to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the farm, she should

Options:

A: win, because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.
B: lose, because the right-of-way was abandoned inasmuch as there never was any actual use made.
C: lose, because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher.
D: lose, because the easement was not in use at the time of the sale to the investor.
E: lose, because the investor has reasonable access to the public highway without using the right-of-way.
F: win, because the investor has a right to access all parts of her property.
G: lose, because the easement was not specifically mentioned in the deed between the farmer and the investor.
H: win, because the right-of-way was never officially terminated.
I: win, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.
J: win, because the original deed clearly states the existence of the right-of-way.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about easements and property rights. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on property law, but I'll think through it step by step.

So, the setup is that there's a farm and an orchard next to each other. The farmer bought the farm in 2006, and the orchard was owned by a rancher. There's an easement involved here. A remote predecessor of the farmer granted a shepherd an easement appurtenant to the orchard, which was for ingress and egress across the farm. This easement was created by deed and recorded properly. But the shepherd never actually used it.

Later, in 2010, the rancher sold the orchard to the farmer. Then, the farmer sold the orchard to an investor in 2011 for $250k, and neither of those deeds mentioned the easement. Now, the investor claims she has the right-of-way across the farm, but the farmer says it doesn't exist anymore.

The question is, in a court case, would the investor win or lose?

Hmm. I remember that easements can be tricky. So, an easement appurtenant requires two properties: the dominant estate and the servient estate. The easement benefits the dominant estate and burdens the servient. Here, the orchard is dominant, and the farm is servient because the easement is across the farm for the orchard's benefit.

Wait, no, wait. The way the question is phrased: the predecessor of the farmer granted the easement to the shepherd for the orchard. So the orchard is the dominant estate, and the farm is the servient. So when the farmer bought the farm, and the rancher owned the orchard, the easement was already in place.

But the shepherd never used it. So does non-use affect the easement? I think usually, non-use doesn't terminate an easement unless there's abandonment, which requires intent and maybe some action, not just non-use. So maybe the non-use doesn't matter here.

Then, the farmer bought the orchard from the rancher in 2010. So the farmer now owns both the farm (servient) and the orchard (dominant). Then, the farmer sells the orchard to the investor. So now the investor owns the orchard, and the farmer still owns the farm.

Wait, but when the farmer owned both, does that cause the easement to merge? I think the doctrine of merger might apply here. Merger happens when the same person owns both the dominant and servient estates, and the easement is extinguished because the two properties are under common ownership. But does merger apply automatically, or does it require the intention to merge?

I remember that merger can extinguish an easement, but it's not automatic. The owner would have to take some action to indicate that they intended to merge the estates and extinguish the easement. If the farmer didn't do anything, maybe the easement continues.

Wait, but when the farmer sold the orchard to the investor, the question is whether the easement still exists. Because after the sale, the farmer owns the farm, and the investor owns the orchard. So the easement appurtenant would still benefit the orchard, which is now owned by the investor. So the easement should still exist unless it was terminated.

But when the farmer acquired both properties, could that have ended the easement? If the same person owns both, the easement might be extinguished through merger. But only if there's an intention to merge. So if the farmer didn't explicitly merge them, maybe the easement remains.

Alternatively, if the easement was appurtenant, it's attached to the land, so when the investor buys the orchard, she gets the easement automatically, unless it's been terminated.

Now, looking at the options. The choices are A to J.

The investor claims she has the right-of-way. The farmer argues it doesn't exist.

Option A says she wins because farmer had constructive notice. Constructive notice is about whether the farmer knew or should have known about the easement when he bought the farm. But the easement was recorded, so the farmer would have constructive notice. But that might affect the farmer's purchase, but the question is about the investor's right after the sale.

Option B: lose because right-of-way was abandoned due to no use. But non-use doesn't abandon an easement unless there's intent to abandon, so B might not be correct.

Option C: lose because merger when farmer acquired orchard. So when farmer bought the orchard, he owned both, and the easement was extinguished by merger. Then, when he sold the orchard, the easement was no longer there. So investor doesn't get it. If that's the case, then C could be correct.

Option D: lose because easement not in use at sale. But again, non-use doesn't terminate, so D might not be correct.

Option E: lose because she has access via public highway. But having alternative access doesn't terminate an existing easement. So E might not be the reason.

Option F: she has a right to access all parts. Not sure about that; easements are specific.

Option G: lose because not mentioned in the deed. But easements are appurtenant and run with the land, so they don't need to be mentioned in the deed. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: win because never terminated. That could be possible if the easement wasn't extinguished.

Option I: win because easement by implication. But the easement was already created by deed, so implication might not apply.

Option J: win because original deed states existence. That makes sense because the easement was properly recorded, so when the investor bought the orchard, she got the easement appurtenant.

Wait, but if merger occurred when the farmer bought the orchard, then the easement was extinguished. So when the farmer sold the orchard to the investor, the easement wasn't there anymore. So the investor wouldn't have it.

So the key issue is whether merger happened when the farmer acquired the orchard.

In some jurisdictions, when the same person owns both estates, the easement is extinguished. But in others, it's only extinguished if the owner intended to merge, perhaps by some action.

So, if merger happens automatically upon common ownership, then the easement would have been extinguished when the farmer bought the orchard. Then, when he sold it to the investor, the easement was gone. So the investor wouldn't have it, meaning she loses. So option C would be correct.

But if merger requires an intention, and the farmer didn't do anything to merge, then the easement continues. So when the farmer sold the orchard, the investor gets the easement. So the investor would win, making A or H correct.

Wait, but the initial creation was by a remote predecessor of the farmer. So the farmer, when he bought the farm in 2006, took it subject to the existing easement. Then, when he bought the orchard in 2010, he became the owner of both the dominant and servient estates.

At that point, under the doctrine of merger, the easement would be extinguished because the same person owns both. So when he later sold the orchard, the easement was already gone. So the investor can't claim it.

So in that case, the correct answer would be C: lose because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard.

Wait, but merger is when the same person owns both the dominant and servient estates, right? So the farmer, after buying the orchard, owns both. So the easement appurtenant from the farm (servient) to the orchard (dominant) would merge into his ownership, extinguishing the easement. So when he sells the orchard, the easement is gone.

Therefore, the investor can't claim the easement. So the answer would be C.

The question revolves around whether the investor has a right-of-way across the farm based on an easement appurtenant created in 2006. The easement was granted to the orchard (dominant estate) over the farm (servient estate) and was properly recorded. However, the shepherd never used the easement. In 2010, the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher, and in 2011, the farmer sold the orchard to the investor without mentioning the easement in the deed. The investor now claims the right-of-way, while the farmer argues it no longer exists.

Key legal principles include:

1. **Easement Appurtenant**: Benefits the dominant estate (orchard) and burdens the servient estate (farm). It runs with the land and does not require mention in subsequent deeds if properly recorded.
2. **Non-Use**: Non-use of an easement does not automatically terminate it unless there is clear evidence of abandonment, which requires intent and action.
3. **Merger Doctrine**: When the same person acquires ownership of both the dominant and servient estates, the easement may be extinguished if the owner intends to merge the estates. In some jurisdictions, merger can occur automatically upon common ownership.

Analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Constructive notice of the easement applies when the farmer purchased the farm in 2006, but this does not resolve whether the easement was extinguished later.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Non-use alone does not abandon an easement without evidence of intent to abandon.
- **Option C**: Correct. When the farmer acquired the orchard in 2010, he owned both the dominant (orchard) and servient (farm) estates. Under the doctrine of merger, the easement was likely extinguished. When the farmer sold the orchard to the investor, the easement no longer existed to pass to the investor.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The easement’s existence is not dependent on use at the time of sale.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Alternative access via a public highway does not terminate an existing easement.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The investor’s right to access all parts of her property is not absolute and does not automatically include the easement if it was extinguished.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Easements appurtenant run with the land and do not need to be mentioned in subsequent deeds.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The easement was likely terminated by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The easement was already created by deed, so easement by implication does not apply.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While the original deed established the easement, it was likely extinguished by merger.

The critical issue is the doctrine of merger. When the farmer acquired the orchard in 2010, he owned both estates, and the easement was extinguished. Therefore, when the farmer sold the orchard to the investor, the easement no longer existed. The investor cannot claim the right-of-way.

**Answer: C**
