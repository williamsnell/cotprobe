Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the momentum uncertainty of an electron in a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says to find the momentum uncertainty in kg·m/s. The options are various orders of magnitude, so maybe I don't need an exact number, just the right ballpark.

I remember that this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant.

Wait, or is it ħ instead of h? Oh right, because ħ is h/(2π), so the uncertainty principle uses ħ. So the formula is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. Or wait, maybe I should double-check that. Oh yeah, the standard form is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

So the problem is about an electron in the hydrogen atom. The smallest diameter of a hydrogen atom—I think that refers to the Bohr radius, but wait, diameter would be twice the radius. Oh right, the Bohr model says the radius of the electron's orbit is approximately 0.529 angstroms, which is 5.29e-11 meters. So the diameter would be about twice that, so around 1.06e-10 meters.

Wait, but sometimes people might just use the Bohr radius as the characteristic size. Hmm. But the question says diameter, so I should go with that. So Δx would be the diameter, which is 2 * Bohr radius. Let me calculate that: 2 * 5.29e-11 m = 1.058e-10 m.

Now, plug that into the uncertainty principle. Δp is approximately ħ / Δx. Because Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, so solving for Δp gives Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, no—uncertainty principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty in momentum would be when Δx Δp = ħ/2. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

What's the value of ħ? Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let's calculate Δp. Plugging in the numbers:

Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1.058e-10) )

Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * 1.058e-10 = 2.116e-10 m.

So Δp = 1.0545718e-34 / 2.116e-10 = let me compute this division.

1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24. So 1.0545718e-34 / 2.116e-10 ≈ (1.0545718 / 2.116) * 1e-24.

Calculating 1.0545718 / 2.116: Let me do that division. Hmm, 2.116 goes into 1.054 about 0.5 times because 2.116 * 0.5 is approximately 1.058, which is a bit higher than 1.054. So maybe around 0.498 or so.

So approximately 0.498e-24 kg·m/s. That's about 5e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, 0.498e-24 is the same as 4.98e-25.

Looking at the options, option J is 5e-25, which is very close. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, let me redo the calculation more accurately. Maybe I can compute the denominator correctly.

Denominator: 2Δx = 2 * 1.058e-10 m = 2.116e-10 m.

So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So Δp = 1.0545718e-34 / (2.116e-10) = let's compute numerator and denominator in exponents.

Divide 1.0545718e-34 by 2.116e-10:

1.0545718 / 2.116 ≈ 0.4988 (since 2.116 * 0.4988 ≈ 1.054)

So 0.4988e-24 kg·m/s. Which is 4.988e-25, approximately 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Looking back at the options, J is 5e-25, which matches.

Wait, but I thought the usual approach was to use the Bohr radius as the uncertainty in position, not the diameter. Let me think. Oh because the question specifies the smallest diameter, so I should use that. So yes, I correctly used the diameter.

Alternatively, if someone mistakenly uses the radius (Δx = 5.29e-11 m), then the denominator would be 2Δx = 1.058e-10, same as before. Wait, no, wait. If Δx is the radius, then 5.29e-11 m. Then Δp would be ħ/(2 * 5.29e-11) = (1.05e-34)/(1.058e-10) ≈ 9.92e-25, which is about 1e-24, but that's not matching the options. So I think using the diameter is correct here.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the uncertainty in position is of the order of the Bohr radius, not the diameter. Because in the uncertainty principle, Δx is the characteristic size of the confinement. So maybe the diameter is the maximum, and the uncertainty in position would be on the order of the radius. Hmm, so that could change things.

Wait, the actual Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle's Δx is the standard deviation, which for a particle in a box would be on the order of the size of the box. So if the particle is confined within a diameter D, then Δx is approximately D. So in that case, the initial approach was correct to use diameter.

So then, the calculation as before, giving about 5e-25 kg·m/s, which is option J.

Alternatively, some might use Δx as the radius, leading to a larger Δp. Let me calculate that scenario. If Δx is 5.29e-11 m, then Δp ≈ 1.05e-34 / (2 * 5.29e-11) = 1.05e-34 / 1.058e-10 ≈ 9.92e-25, which is approximately 1e-24. But none of the options exactly match, except option A is 1e-24, but that's 1e-24. But wait, option I is 3e-24, which is higher than that. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute using diameter.

Wait, diameter is 1.06e-10 m. So Δx is 1.06e-10 m. Then Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34) / (2*(1.06e-10)).

Wait, 2*1.06e-10 is 2.12e-10 m.

So 1.05e-34 / 2.12e-10 = (1.05 / 2.12) * 1e-24.

1.05 divided by 2.12 is approximately 0.495.

So 0.495e-24 kg·m/s, which is 4.95e-25, so about 5e-25. So that's option J.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is 5e-25. So that's the closest.

Alternatively, if I use more precise numbers, perhaps that changes the result a bit. Let's try that.

Bohr radius a0 is exactly 0.529e-10 m? Wait, no, 0.529 angstroms is 5.29e-11 m. So diameter is 1.058e-10 m.

ħ is exactly 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So Δp = 1.0545718e-34 / (2 * 1.058e-10)

Compute denominator: 2 * 1.058e-10 = 2.116e-10.

So 1.0545718e-34 / 2.116e-10 = let's compute that.

1.0545718 / 2.116 = let's do the division. 2.116 times 0.5 is 1.058, as before. 1.0545718 is slightly less than that. So 0.5 would give 1.058, but we have 1.05457, which is 0.00343 less. So 0.5 - (0.00343 / 2.116) ≈ 0.5 - 0.0016 = 0.4984.

So 0.4984e-24 kg·m/s, which is 4.984e-25, so 5e-25, which is option J. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that the uncertainty principle gives a minimum uncertainty, not the actual value. So perhaps the actual momentum could be higher, but the uncertainty is the minimum. So in the problem, calculating the uncertainty as approximately this value is correct.

Alternatively, I might have confused the formula. Let me make sure. The formula is Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Because Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2 → Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). So the minimum uncertainty in momentum is ħ/(2Δx). So that's correct.

So putting it all together, the momentum uncertainty is approximately 5e-25 kg·m/s, which is option J.

To calculate the momentum uncertainty of an electron within the smallest diameter of a hydrogen atom, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta x \) is the uncertainty in position, and \( \Delta p \) is the uncertainty in momentum. Rearranging for \( \Delta p \), we get:

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}
\]

### Step 1: Determine \( \Delta x \)
The smallest diameter of a hydrogen atom is approximately twice the Bohr radius. The Bohr radius is \( a_0 = 5.29 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m} \), so the diameter is:

\[
\Delta x = 2a_0 = 2 \times 5.29 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m} = 1.058 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Use the value of \( \hbar \)
The reduced Planck constant is:

\[
\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta p \)
Substitute \( \hbar \) and \( \Delta x \) into the formula for \( \Delta p \):

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1.058 \times 10^{-10}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \times 1.058 \times 10^{-10} = 2.116 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Now divide:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2.116 \times 10^{-10}} = \left( \frac{1.0545718}{2.116} \right) \times 10^{-24}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{1.0545718}{2.116} \approx 0.4988
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta p \approx 0.4988 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 4.988 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated momentum uncertainty is approximately \( 5 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \), which corresponds to option **J**.

### Final Answer:
J
