Question:

Intestinal lactase deficiency leads to lactose maldigestion which subsequently can lead to lactose intolerance, i.e. causing clinical symptoms. Infants and children normally express sufficient lactase levels as not to experience clinical symptoms. Overall, adults can be classified as lactase-persisters or lactase non-persisters. What is the approximate percentage of Lactase non-persisters worldwide?


Options:

A: 30%-35%
B: 80%-85%
C: 90%-95%
D: 55%-60%
E: 5%-10%
F: 45%-50%
G: 60%-65%
H: 10%-15%
I: 20%-25%
J: 70%-75 %

Okay, so I have this question about lactase deficiency and lactose intolerance. Hmm, I remember that lactose intolerance is when someone can't digest lactose properly because they don't have enough lactase enzyme. The question is about the percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide.

Wait, let me think. I've heard that most people naturally lose the ability to digest lactose after weaning. Like, infants have high lactase levels because they drink breast milk, but as they grow up, the enzyme levels drop. So in many cultures, adults are lactose intolerant because they don't have the enzyme anymore.

I think in some populations, especially in Europe and some parts of Africa, a lot of people can digest lactose into adulthood. Those are the lactase persisters. But globally, what's the majority? I remember reading that a large percentage of adults worldwide are lactose intolerant. Like, maybe around 65% or so? Or was it higher?

Wait, no, I think it's more like 60-70% or something. Wait, let me recall. In some African and European countries, lactase persistence is higher because of dairy farming practices. So in those areas, maybe only 20-30% are non-persisters. But in other parts of the world, like Asia, Africa (other regions), and South America, lactase non-persistence is much more common.

Wait, I think the question is asking about the approximate percentage worldwide. So adding it all up, the majority of the world's population is lactase non-persisters. So maybe it's about 65-75%? Or wait, I've heard numbers like 70% of adults are lactose intolerant. But wait, some sources say that about 65% of the global population has some degree of lactose intolerance, but the actual prevalence varies.

Wait, another angle: lactase non-persistence is when the body stops producing enough lactase after childhood. So the non-persisters can't digest lactose. So if most adults are non-persisters, what's the percentage?

I think the correct figure is that about 65% of the world's population are lactose intolerant, meaning they are non-persisters. Wait, but I've also heard that in some populations, like in East Asia, the prevalence is higher, like 80-90%. But when you average it out globally, considering all regions, maybe it's around 70% or so.

Looking at the options, option J is 70-75%, and option G is 60-65%. Alternatively, option B is 80-85%. Hmm, wait, perhaps I should think again. I think in most of the world, except for certain European and African groups, lactase non-persistence is the norm. So maybe the majority of the world's population is non-persister.

Wait, I've read that about 65% of the global population is lactose intolerant. So that would fall into the 60-65% range, which is option G. But wait, another source I recall said it's approximately 70%, which would be option J.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing some figures. Let me think: in Europe, lactase persistence is around 30-40%, but in other regions, it's much higher. Wait no, wait: in Northern Europe, like Sweden, the majority are lactase persistent. Like, maybe 90% can digest lactose. But in other places, like Italy, maybe 50% are non-persistent. So the overall European average might be lower. But globally, considering Asia, Africa, and the Americas, the majority are non-persistent.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of non-persisters worldwide. If non-persisters are in the majority, but how much exactly?

Wait, I think the correct answer is around 65-75%. But looking back, the options include J as 70-75%, and G as 60-65%. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, another approach: lactose intolerance is most prevalent in people of African, Asian, or Native American descent. These groups make up a significant portion of the global population. So if the majority of the world is from these regions, the percentage would be high.

Wait, I think the correct figure is that approximately 65% of the global population is lactose intolerant, which would fall into the 60-65% category, option G. But I'm a bit unsure because I've heard varying numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 90-95%, but that seems too high. I don't think it's that high because some regions have lower rates.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Some populations have higher persistence, so the global average can't be that high. So perhaps 60-65% is correct.

But now I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should go with the option that indicates a majority, so 60-65% (G) or 70-75% (J). Alternatively, another way: I remember reading that about two-thirds of the world's population is lactose intolerant, so that would be about 66%, which is within the 60-65% or 65-70% range. But the options don't have 65-70, only G (60-65) and J (70-75).

Wait, the question specifies lactase non-persisters. So, lactase non-persisters are those who don't have the enzyme as adults. So, it's the same as lactose intolerant individuals when they consume lactose beyond their enzyme capacity.

I think the correct answer is that approximately 60-70% of the world's adults are lactose intolerant. So if the options are G (60-65) or J (70-75), which one is more accurate?

Wait, I think the figure is around 65%, so perhaps G is the better option. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've come across sources stating that about 70% of the world's population is lactose intolerant. So perhaps J is the answer.

Wait, but another angle: lactase non-persisters are those with low lactase activity. But lactose intolerance is the condition where this leads to symptoms. However, the question is about non-persisters, which is the enzyme level, not necessarily the intolerance.

But the question says, "What is the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide?" So regardless of whether they have symptoms, it's about the enzyme levels.

I think the correct answer is around 65%, which would be option G (60-65). But I'm still a bit unsure because some sources say 70% or so.

Wait, another thought: the global prevalence of lactose intolerance is often cited as approximately 65%, so if the question is about lactase non-persisters, which is the same as lactose intolerant, the answer would be around 65%. So the closest option is G (60-65). Alternatively, if a source says 70%, then J.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of this differently. The highest rates of lactose intolerance are found in people of African, Asian, and Native American descent. For example, in some African countries, it's around 80-90%, in many Asian countries, it's about 70-90%, and in Native Americans, it's almost 100%. In Europe, it's lower, but still, about 20-30% in some areas.

So if we take an approximate average, considering that a large portion of the world's population is in Asia and Africa, where the rates are high, the global average would be higher than in Europe. So maybe the global average is around 65-75% non-persisters.

Looking at the options, J is 70-75% and G is 60-65%. If the average is around 65, then G is the answer. But I'm not entirely confident. I might have to make a choice based on my best recollection.

I think the correct answer is option C: 90-95%? No, that seems too high because many Europeans can digest lactose. So no, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should check my notes. Oh wait, I can't. So I have to rely on memory.

Another way: I remember that in Western countries, lactose intolerance is less common, but worldwide, it's more prevalent. So perhaps the majority of the world's people are non-persisters. So the percentage is high. But how high?

I think the correct answer is that about 70% of the world's population are lactase non-persisters. So the answer is J:70-75%.

The question asks for the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide. Lactase non-persisters are individuals who lose the ability to digest lactose after infancy due to reduced lactase enzyme production. This condition is linked to lactose intolerance, which is more prevalent in certain populations.

Infants and young children typically have sufficient lactase levels, but in most populations worldwide, lactase production declines after weaning. Lactose intolerance is particularly common in people of African, Asian, and Native American descent, with prevalence rates often exceeding 70-90% in these groups. In contrast, European populations, especially in Northern Europe, have higher rates of lactase persistence due to dietary and evolutionary factors.

Globally, the majority of the world's population is lactose intolerant, with estimates suggesting that approximately 65-75% of adults worldwide are lactase non-persisters. This figure reflects the higher prevalence of lactose intolerance in regions like Asia, Africa, and the Americas, which collectively account for a significant portion of the global population.

Given the options provided, the most accurate approximation for the percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide is **70-75%**.
