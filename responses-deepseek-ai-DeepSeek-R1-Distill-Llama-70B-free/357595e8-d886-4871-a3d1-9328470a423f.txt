Question:

The barometric formula relates the pressure of a gas of molar mass $M$ at an altitude $h$ to its pressure $p_0$ at sea level. Derive this relation by showing that the change in pressure $\mathrm{d} p$ for an infinitesimal change in altitude $\mathrm{d} h$ where the density is $\rho$ is $\mathrm{d} p=-\rho g \mathrm{~d} h$. Remember that $\rho$ depends on the pressure. Evaluate the external atmospheric pressure at a typical cruising altitude of an aircraft (11 km) when the pressure at ground level is 1.0 atm.

Options:

A: 0.33
B:  0.72
C: 0.25
D: 0.58
E: 1.00
F: 1.15
G: 0.50
H: 0.85
I: 0.95
J: 0.40

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the barometric formula and atmospheric pressure at a certain altitude. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says I need to derive the relation for the change in pressure with altitude. I remember that the barometric formula has something to do with how pressure decreases as you go higher. Oh right, it's because the atmosphere above you is pressing down, and as you go up, there's less atmosphere above, so less pressure.

The first part says to show that dp = -ρ g dh, where dp is the change in pressure, ρ is density, g is gravity, and dh is the change in height. Oh, right, this comes from considering a thin slice of air. The weight of that slice is its mass times gravity. Mass is density times volume, and if the area is A, the volume is A dh. So the weight is ρ * A dh * g. The pressure difference across this slice would be the weight, so dp is approximately that. But since as you go up, the pressure decreases, dp is negative when dh is positive. So dp = -ρ g dh. Got it.

Now, to find the pressure at 11 km when ground level is 1 atm. I think the barometric formula is something like p = p0 * exp(-Mgh/(RT)), but wait, or is it proportional to exponential of -h/H, where H is the scale height? Oh right, the scale height H is RT/(Mg), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and M is molar mass.

Wait, but wait. The derivation involves integrating dp/dh = -ρ g. But density ρ is related to pressure via the ideal gas law. Oh yes, because for an ideal gas, ρ = (p M)/(R T). So substituting that into the differential equation gives dp/dh = - (p M g)/(R T). 

So the equation becomes dp/p = -(M g)/(R T) dh. Integrating both sides from ground (h=0, p=p0) to h. So ln(p/p0) = - (M g h)/(R T). Exponentiating both sides gives p = p0 exp(-(M g h)/(R T)).

But wait, wait. What values do I use here? Let's see, I think at cruising altitude, the temperature is lower than sea level. But maybe the problem is assuming it's isothermal, i.e., T is constant. Or perhaps we can use the standard values.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify T. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a more empirical approach. I remember that there's a standard atmospheric model where the pressure decreases exponentially with height, and for the troposphere, the scale height is around 8 km. Or wait, the scale height H is about 8 km for Earth's atmosphere.

Wait, scale height H is RT/(Mg), right. Let's compute H. Let me get the values.

R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K). M for air is about 28.97 g/mol, which is 0.02897 kg/mol. g is 9.81 m/s². Let's compute H.

H = (R T) / (M g). But wait, what temperature should I use? At sea level, T is about 288 K (15°C). But at 11 km, the temperature is lower. Wait, in the troposphere, the temperature decreases with altitude, but perhaps the problem is assuming a constant temperature. Or perhaps it's using a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the sea level values for all variables. Let's proceed under that assumption for now.

So let's compute H: H = (8.314 * T) / (0.02897 * 9.81). Let me plug in T as 288 K.

Calculating denominator first: 0.02897 kg/mol * 9.81 m/s² = 0.02897 * 9.81 ≈ 0.284 kg/(m·s²·mol) → because units would be kg/(m·s²·mol) because g has units m/s². Wait, but R is in J/(mol·K) which is (kg·m²)/(s²·mol·K). So overall, H would be in meters.

So compute numerator: 8.314 * 288 ≈ let's see, 8 * 288 is 2304, 0.314 * 288 ≈ 90.5, so total ≈ 2394.5. So 2394.5 J/(mol·K) * K = 2394.5 J/mol.

Denominator: 0.02897 kg/mol * 9.81 m/s² → 0.02897 * 9.81 ≈ 0.284 (kg·m/s²)/mol.

So H = (2394.5) / (0.284) → Let me compute that. 2394.5 / 0.284 ≈ 8400 m. So H is about 8.4 km.

Wait, but that's about 8.4 km, so scale height is around 8.4 km.

Now, at a height h = 11 km, the pressure p = p0 exp(-h/H). So p = 1 atm * exp(-11/8.4).

Compute 11/8.4 = approx 1.3095.

exp(-1.3095) ≈ let's see. exp(1) is 2.718, exp(1.3) is about 3.669 (since exp(1.2) ≈ 3.32, 1.3 is about 3.669). So exp(-1.3095) is 1/3.669 ≈ 0.272. So p ≈ 0.272 atm.

Looking at the options: options are A:0.33, B:0.72, C:0.25, D:0.58, E:1.00, F:1.15, G:0.50, H:0.85, I:0.95, J:0.40. So 0.25 is option C, 0.33 is A, 0.40 is J.

But wait, my initial assumption was that T is 288 K, but at 11 km, the temperature is lower, right? Because in the troposphere, temperature decreases with height. So that would make H smaller, which would make the exponent more negative, leading to lower pressure.

Wait, but in the calculation I used T as 288 K, but if the actual temperature is lower, then H would be smaller, so the exp(-h/H) would have a larger exponent, making the pressure even lower. But since I'm getting 0.27 atm, which is near option C (0.25), but let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard scale height of 8 km. Because in some references, H is taken as 8 km for approximate calculations.

So if H is 8 km, then h/H is 11/8 = 1.375. exp(-1.375) ≈ e^(-1) is 0.3679, e^(-1.375) is lower than that. Let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 1.375 = 1 + 0.375. So e^(-1.375) = e^(-1) * e^(-0.375). e^(-1) is about 0.3679. e^(-0.375) is approximately, let's see: 0.375 is 3/8, e^(-0.375) ≈ 0.6873 (since e^-0.3 is ~0.7408, e^-0.4 is ~0.6703, so maybe around 0.687). So 0.3679 * 0.687 ≈ 0.252. So about 0.25 atm, which is option C.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the question expects me to use the hydrostatic approximation, without considering temperature. Or maybe I made a mistake in the scale height calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use different values. Let me think again. Another approach is to recall that the atmospheric pressure at 10 km is about 0.25 atm, so 11 km would be lower, but perhaps the options are approximated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for M. Wait, M is the molar mass of air, which is approximately 28.97 g/mol, but maybe the problem uses 29 g/mol for simplicity.

Wait, let me recalculate H with M=29 g/mol.

M = 0.029 kg/mol.

H = (R*T)/(M g) = (8.314 * 288) / (0.029 * 9.81).

Compute numerator: 8.314 * 288 ≈ 8*288=2304, 0.314*288≈90.5, so total≈2394.5 J/mol.

Denominator: 0.029 *9.81 ≈0.284 m s^-2 kg/mol.

Wait, no, 0.029 kg/mol * 9.81 m/s² = 0.029 *9.81 = 0.284 kg/(m s² mol). Wait, but that's the same as before, so H is same as before, 2394.5 / 0.284 ≈ 8400 m, same as 8.4 km.

So I'm back to the same calculation. So p = exp(-11/8.4) ≈ exp(-1.3095) ≈0.27 atm, which is close to option C (0.25) or maybe A (0.33). But my approximation was 0.27.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, considering that the density isn't constant but varies with height. But I think that's what I did.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the integral more accurately, without assuming isothermal conditions. Oh wait, but the problem states to derive the relation, so perhaps to set up the equation but perhaps to use the given values correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to approximate the integral as a simple exponential, but the answer seems to be around 0.25 to 0.27 atm, which is option C.

But looking at the options, option C is 0.25, which is close. So I think the answer is C, 0.25 atm.

The barometric formula relates the pressure of a gas at an altitude \( h \) to its pressure at sea level \( p_0 \). The change in pressure \( \mathrm{d}p \) for an infinitesimal change in altitude \( \mathrm{d}h \) is given by \( \mathrm{d}p = -\rho g \, \mathrm{d}h \), where \( \rho \) is the density of the gas. Using the ideal gas law, \( \rho = \frac{pM}{RT} \), where \( M \) is the molar mass of the gas, \( R \) is the universal gas constant, and \( T \) is the temperature, the differential equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{p} = -\frac{Mg}{RT} \, \mathrm{d}h.
\]

Integrating this from sea level (\( h = 0, p = p_0 \)) to altitude \( h \), assuming constant temperature, gives:

\[
p = p_0 \exp\left(-\frac{Mgh}{RT}\right).
\]

The scale height \( H \), defined as \( H = \frac{RT}{Mg} \), simplifies the expression to:

\[
p = p_0 \exp\left(-\frac{h}{H}\right).
\]

For air, \( M \approx 28.97 \, \mathrm{g/mol} \), \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)} \), and \( g = 9.81 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \). Assuming a temperature of \( T = 288 \, \mathrm{K} \) (sea level temperature), the scale height is calculated as:

\[
H = \frac{(8.314)(288)}{(0.02897)(9.81)} \approx 8.4 \, \mathrm{km}.
\]

At an altitude of \( h = 11 \, \mathrm{km} \), the pressure is:

\[
p = p_0 \exp\left(-\frac{11}{8.4}\right).
\]

The exponent \( \frac{11}{8.4} \approx 1.3095 \), and \( \exp(-1.3095) \approx 0.27 \). Thus, the pressure at 11 km is approximately:

\[
p \approx 0.27 \, \mathrm{atm}.
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the closest value is \( 0.25 \, \mathrm{atm} \), which corresponds to option C.
