Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a ball being thrown at an angle and landing some distance away. I need to find the initial speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on projectile motion, but let me think through this.

Alright, the problem says the ball is thrown at 45 degrees to the ground and lands 90 meters away. So, I remember that in projectile motion, when the angle is 45 degrees, the range is maximized for a given speed. Oh wait, the range formula for a projectile launched on level ground is (v² sin(2θ))/g, right? Because when θ is 45 degrees, sin(90) is 1, so the range becomes v²/g. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight.

Wait, the range formula is (v₀² sin(2θ)) / g. Yeah, that's correct. So when θ is 45 degrees, 2θ is 90 degrees, and sin(90) is 1. So the range R is v₀² / g. Then solving for v₀ would give v₀ = sqrt(gR). 

Wait, but wait again. Maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me make sure. The standard range formula for a projectile launched and landing on the same horizontal level is R = (v₀² sin(2θ)) / g. So yes, for θ=45°, sin(90)=1, so R = v₀² / g. So rearranging, v₀ = sqrt(g R).

But what's the value of g? Hmm, I think it's approximately 9.8 m/s². So substituting R =90 m, v₀ = sqrt(9.8 *90).

Let me compute that. 9.8 * 90 is 882. So sqrt(882). Wait, what's sqrt(882)? Let me approximate. I know that 29² is 841 (since 30² is 900), and 29.7² is let's see: 29*29=841, 0.7²=0.49, and cross terms 2*29*0.7=40.6. So 841 +40.6=881.6 +0.49=882.09. Oh wait, so sqrt(882) is approximately 29.7 m/s. But wait, the options don't have 30? Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are A:50, B:45, C:25, D:20, E:35, F:55, G:40, H:15, I:28, J:30. Oh, option J is 30 m/s. So that's close to the 29.7 I calculated. But wait, perhaps the question uses g=10 m/s² for simplicity? Because sometimes in problems, they approximate g as 10 to make the calculations easier.

If I use g=10, then v₀ = sqrt(10 *90)=sqrt(900)=30 m/s. That's exactly option J. So maybe the question expects me to use g=10. 

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem doesn't specify, but in many textbook problems, especially when the answer is a round number, g is taken as 10. So 90 meters would then result in v₀=30 m/s. So the answer would be J.

But wait, wait a second. Did I use the right formula? Because sometimes I get confused between range and time of flight. Let's double-check the range formula. Yes, for maximum range at 45 degrees, R = (v₀^2)/g. So that's correct.

So the initial speed must be approximately 30 m/s. Looking back at the options, J is 30. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the initial speed of the ball, we use the range formula for projectile motion:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

At an angle of \( \theta = 45^\circ \), \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \), so the formula simplifies to:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2}{g}
\]

Rearranging for \( v_0 \):

\[
v_0 = \sqrt{gR}
\]

Substituting \( R = 90 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \):

\[
v_0 = \sqrt{9.8 \times 90} = \sqrt{882} \approx 29.7 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]

However, in many problems, \( g \) is approximated as \( 10 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \) for simplicity. Using \( g = 10 \):

\[
v_0 = \sqrt{10 \times 90} = \sqrt{900} = 30 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]

This matches option J. Therefore, the initial speed of the ball is:

**J: 30 m/s**
