Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The crown of a very carious tooth suddenly fractures while the patient is standing eating at a take-away food outlet and a fragment is inhaled. It is more likely to enter the

Options:

A: right lung because the right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left.
B: right lung because the fragment is more likely to be attracted to the right side of the body.
C: neither lung as the fragment would likely be caught in the throat.
D: left lung because the fragment is more likely to be attracted to the left side of the body.
E: left lung because the left main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the right.
F: right lung or left lung because the two main bronchi are of equal size and at the same angulation.
G: neither lung as the fragment would likely be expelled through coughing.
H: stomach because the fragment is likely to be swallowed instead of inhaled.
I: right or left lung because there are no factors predisposing to the fragment going in one particular direction.
J: esophagus because it is more likely for fragments to enter during swallowing.

Okay, so I have this question about a dental emergency where a tooth's crown fractures and a fragment is inhaled. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned in anatomy and maybe some emergency procedures.

The question is asking which lung the fragment is more likely to enter. The options are A through J, so I need to think about the respiratory system's structure. I remember that the trachea splits into the right and left main bronchi. Oh right, the right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical compared to the left. So if something is inhaled, like a foreign body, it's more likely to go into the right lung because of these factors. That's because gravity would make it fall into the wider and more straight path of the right bronchus when someone is standing upright.

Wait, the patient was standing when this happened, eating at a takeaway. So being upright, the fragment would more likely go down the right bronchus. So looking at the options, option A says the right lung because the right main bronchus is wider and more vertical. That makes sense.

Other options: Option C says neither lung because it's caught in the throat. But the question states the fragment is inhaled, so it's beyond the throat. Option E says left lung because left bronchus is wider, but I think the right is wider. Option H says stomach because swallowed, but again, it's inhaled, so not swallowed. So yeah, the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is based on the anatomical structure of the respiratory system. The right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left, making it the more likely pathway for an inhaled foreign body, especially when the patient is upright. This explains why the fragment would more likely enter the right lung.

Answer: A
