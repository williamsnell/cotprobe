Alright, so I have this question about the US president mentioned in the opening theme song of 'All in the Family'. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with the show, but I know it's a classic sitcom. Let me think about what I remember about it.

Okay, 'All in the Family' was a popular TV show in the 70s, right? It was set in Queens, New York, and the main character was Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O'Connor. Archie was a working-class guy with some pretty conservative and traditional views, often the butt of the show's humor.

The theme song, I think, is titled "Those Were the Days." I remember the lyrics being somewhat nostalgic. Let me try to recall the words. The song starts with something like, "Boy, the way Glen Miller played..." Then it goes on about the good old days, mentioning various things from the past.

Wait, I think it mentions presidents. Let me try to remember the line. Oh right, it goes, "Mister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again." So that would be Herbert Hoover. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should double-check.

Herbert Hoover was the president before the Great Depression, right? He was president from 1929 to 1933. So the show's theme song is referencing him. That makes sense because Archie Bunker would have looked back fondly on earlier times, perhaps more conservative eras.

Looking at the options, option E is Herbert Hoover. So I think that's the correct answer. I don't remember any other presidents being mentioned in the theme song, so it's probably E.
