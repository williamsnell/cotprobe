Okay, so I've got this problem here about probability, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. John has five children. What's the probability that at least half of them are girls? And it says that a boy is equally likely as a girl, so each has a 50% chance.

Hmm, okay. So the question is about the probability of having at least half girls out of five kids. Half of five is 2.5, but since you can't have half a child, I guess we're looking for when there are 3, 4, or 5 girls. Because 3 out of 5 is more than half, same with 4 and 5.

So the problem boils down to finding the probability of getting 3, 4, or 5 girls when each child is a girl with probability 0.5, independent of the others. Since each child is an independent event, we can model this with the binomial distribution. Right, because each trial (child) is independent, with two possible outcomes, and the same probability each time.

The binomial probability formula is: P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. Here, n is 5, p is 0.5 for each case.

So I need to calculate P(3) + P(4) + P(5). Let's compute each part.

First, P(3). C(5,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 successes (girls) out of 5. C(5,3) is 10, because 5!/(3!2!) = (5*4)/2 = 10.

So P(3) = 10 * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^2. Since (0.5)^3 is 1/8, and (0.5)^2 is 1/4. So 10 * (1/8) * (1/4) = 10 * (1/32) = 10/32.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^2 is (0.5)^(3+2) = (0.5)^5 = 1/32. So 10 * 1/32 = 10/32 = 5/16.

Wait, no, wait. Because 10 * (1/8) is 10/8, but that's not correct. Oh wait, no, let's recalculate. Because (0.5)^3 is 1/8, (0.5)^2 is 1/4. Multiply them: 1/8 * 1/4 = 1/32. Then multiply by 10: 10/32, which simplifies to 5/16. Right.

Next, P(4). C(5,4) is 5, because there are 5 ways to choose 4 out of 5. So P(4) = 5 * (0.5)^4 * (0.5)^1. That's 5 * (1/16) * (1/2) = 5 * 1/32 = 5/32.

Then P(5). C(5,5) is 1. So P(5) = 1 * (0.5)^5 * (0.5)^0 = 1 * (1/32) * 1 = 1/32.

Now, sum them up. So P(3)+P(4)+P(5) = 5/16 + 5/32 + 1/32.

Let me convert these to 32 denominators. 5/16 is 10/32, so 10/32 +5/32 =15/32, plus 1/32 is 16/32, which is 1/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in a symmetric distribution like this, the probability of more girls than boys would be the same as more boys than girls. But wait, wait, in this case, the question is at least half being girls, which includes exactly half. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, the question says "at least half". So half of five is 2.5, so at least three girls.

Wait, but earlier I considered 3,4,5. So the sum is 16/32 = 1/2. So the probability is 1/2. But wait, that can't be, because when n is odd, the number of cases where girls are more than half would be the same as when boys are more than half. But in that case, the total would be 1 - P(exactly 2.5 girls), but since that's not possible, the total would be 1/2.

But wait, let me think again. For n=5, each child is a Bernoulli trial with p=0.5. The distribution is symmetric.

The probability of more girls than boys is equal to the probability of more boys than girls. And the remaining probability is when there's exactly 2.5, but since that's impossible, the remaining is when there are exactly 2 girls and 3 boys, or 3 girls and 2 boys. Wait, no, in n=5, the possible numbers are 0 to 5. The number of girls can be 0,1,2,3,4,5.

Wait, so the cases where girls are more than half are 3,4,5. The cases where boys are more than half are 0,1,2. So the probabilities of these two groups should be the same because of symmetry (since p=0.5 for each trial).

So the sum for 3,4,5 should be equal to the sum for 0,1,2. But wait, what about the case where exactly 2.5, which isn't possible, so the middle case is 2 and 3.

Wait, wait, for n=5, the middle point is 2.5, so the cases where girls are equal to boys would be when there are 2 girls and 3 boys, or 3 girls and 2 boys. Wait no, that's not equal. Actually, 5 is odd, so the middle is 2.5, so the cases where it's equal are when the number of girls is 2 or 3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The total number of possible outcomes is 2^5 = 32. Each outcome is equally likely.

Now, count the number of outcomes where at least 3 girls:

- 3 girls: C(5,3) = 10
- 4 girls: C(5,4) =5
- 5 girls: C(5,5)=1

Total favorable outcomes:10+5+1=16.

So the probability is 16/32 = 1/2.

Wait, but that seems to contradict what I thought earlier about symmetry. Because in that case, both more girls and more boys would have 16/32 each, but wait no. Because the number of cases where girls are more than boys (3,4,5) is 16, and the cases where boys are more (0,1,2) is also C(5,0)+C(5,1)+C(5,2)=1+5+10=16. So each has 16, which is 16/32=1/2. Then the remaining is cases where girls equals boys, but since 5 is odd, that's not possible, so the middle case would be when girls are 2 or 3, but wait, in 5 children, you can't have 2.5.

Wait, so in this case, the total of all probabilities is 16 (girls more) +16 (boys more) =32, but the total possible is 32, so that's correct. So each has 16/32=1/2.

Wait, but the question is the probability of at least half being girls. So that includes exactly half? No, no. Wait, the question says "at least half", which would be 3 or more girls. So that's 16 out of 32, which is 1/2. So the probability is 1/2. So the answer would be option G: 1/2.

But wait, wait, let me check my initial calculation. Because when I calculated the probabilities, I added 5/16 +5/32 +1/32. Let me do that again:

5/16 is 10/32.

10/32 (P=3) +5/32 (P=4) +1/32 (P=5) =16/32=1/2.

Yes, that's correct. So the probability is 1/2.

But wait, when I think about it, intuitively, in an even number of children, the probability of more girls is less than 1/2 because the exact half case is possible. But in this case, with an odd number, there's no exact half, so the probabilities of more girls and more boys are equal, each 1/2.

So the correct answer should be G: 1/2.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking back, the options are:

A:1/3, B:3/4, C:1/8, D:5/8, E:1/5, F:2/3, G:1/2, H:1/4, I:3/5, J:4/5.

So option G is 1/2, which seems correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's phrased as "at least half". So if John has five children, what's the probability that at least half are girls. So that's 3,4,5 girls, which we calculated as 1/2.

Hmm, but I remember that in similar problems, sometimes the probability is higher. Maybe I should recheck my math.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the cases. Let me list all possible numbers of girls and their probabilities.

Number of girls: 0,1,2,3,4,5.

Compute each probability:

P(0) = C(5,0)*(0.5)^5 =1*(1/32)=1/32.

P(1)=C(5,1)*(0.5)^5=5/32.

P(2)=C(5,2)*(0.5)^5=10/32.

P(3)=10/32.

P(4)=5/32.

P(5)=1/32.

So the sum for girls >=3 is P(3)+P(4)+P(5)=10+5+1=16/32=1/2.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is G:1/2.

To determine the probability that at least half of John's five children are girls, we need to calculate the probability of having 3, 4, or 5 girls. Since each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, we can model this using the binomial distribution with parameters \( n = 5 \) and \( p = 0.5 \).

The binomial probability formula is:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes (girls) out of \( n \) trials (children).

### Step 1: Calculate individual probabilities
1. **For 3 girls (\( k = 3 \)):**
   \[
   P(3) = \binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^2 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{32} = \frac{10}{32}
   \]

2. **For 4 girls (\( k = 4 \)):**
   \[
   P(4) = \binom{5}{4} (0.5)^4 (0.5)^1 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{32} = \frac{5}{32}
   \]

3. **For 5 girls (\( k = 5 \)):**
   \[
   P(5) = \binom{5}{5} (0.5)^5 (0.5)^0 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{32} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{32}
   \]

### Step 2: Sum the probabilities
The total probability of having at least 3 girls is:
\[
P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = \frac{10}{32} + \frac{5}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Verify symmetry
Since the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is equal (\( p = 0.5 \)), the distribution is symmetric. The probability of having more girls than boys (3, 4, or 5 girls) is equal to the probability of having more boys than girls (0, 1, or 2 girls). Each of these probabilities is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Final Answer
The probability that at least half of John's five children are girls is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

**Correct Option: G: \(\frac{1}{2}\)**
