Question:

A buyer expressed interest in purchasing an industrial air-conditioning system manufactured by the seller. The parties agreed orally on a price of $100,000 for the system, but continued to negotiate over several points. When all matters regarding the air-conditioning system were finally settled, the parties signed a written agreement. It provided that the price for the system, which would be delivered on June 1, would be $110,000. The written agreement, a lengthy form contract, did not contain a merger clause. The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price. The seller sued the buyer for the additional $10,000 under the written agreement. Is the court likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000?

Options:

A: Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.
B: No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.
C: Yes, because the buyer can refuse to pay more than the orally agreed price.
D: Yes, because the oral agreement is considered more binding than the written agreement.
E: Yes, because the seller cannot increase the price without the buyer's consent.
F: Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.
G: No, because the court does not consider oral agreements.
H: No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.
I: No, because the written agreement takes precedence over the oral agreement.
J: No, because the seller has the right to increase the price in the written agreement.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the situation is that a buyer and a seller were negotiating an industrial air-conditioning system. They had an oral agreement on the price of $100,000, but then they kept negotiating other points. Eventually, they signed a written agreement that set the price at $110,000. The written contract was a lengthy form and didn't have a merger clause. Then, when the seller delivered, the buyer refused to pay more than $100k, citing the oral agreement. The seller sued for the extra $10k. The question is whether the court will admit evidence of the oral $100k price.

Alright, I remember that the Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Also, the parol evidence rule comes into play when there's a written contract. The parol evidence rule says that prior or contemporaneous oral agreements can't contradict the terms of a written contract if the written contract is intended to be the complete and final agreement.

Wait, but here the written agreement didn't have a merger clause. Oh right, a merger clause (also called an integration clause) states that the written agreement is the final and complete agreement between the parties, and that any prior agreements are superseded. If there's no merger clause, does that mean that parol evidence could still be admissible?

Wait, no. I think the parol evidence rule applies even without a merger clause. The presence of a merger clause just makes it clearer that the parties intended the written agreement to be the final one. But even without it, once a written contract is entered into that covers the same subject matter, evidence of prior agreements can't contradict it if the written contract is fully integrated.

So in this case, the written contract was about the same system, and it included the price. The prior oral agreement was on the same topic. So the parol evidence rule would bar introducing evidence of the prior oral agreement if the written contract is considered fully integrated.

Wait, but what if the written contract isn't fully integrated? If it's only partially integrated, then prior agreements on the points not included in the writing can still be considered. But in this case, the written agreement was a lengthy form contract. That suggests it's fully integrated, covering all the necessary points, including the price.

Wait, but the parties continued to negotiate after the oral agreement. So the written contract superseded the oral one, right? Because when they signed the written agreement, they were finalizing all the terms, including the price. So the written agreement's price term would be the one that's enforceable.

So when the buyer tries to introduce the prior oral agreement to say the price was $100k, that's trying to contradict the written term of $110k. The parol evidence rule would prevent that because the written contract is the final agreement.

So the court would not admit the evidence of the oral agreement. Looking at the options:

Option B says no because the oral term would contradict an express written term. That sounds right.

Option F says yes because there's no merger clause, but I thought the merger clause isn't necessary for the parol evidence rule to apply. So F is incorrect.

Options A and others seem to suggest different reasons. A says it's for possible reformation, but I don't think that's the case here. The question is about whether evidence is admissible to contradict the written term. So B seems correct.

The court is unlikely to admit evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000 because the parol evidence rule generally bars the introduction of prior oral agreements that contradict the terms of a fully integrated written contract. Although the written agreement did not contain a merger clause, the parol evidence rule applies regardless, as the written contract appears to be fully integrated, covering all necessary terms, including the price. The written agreement supersedes the earlier oral agreement, and the oral price term cannot contradict the express written price term of $110,000. 

Option B correctly states that the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement, making it inadmissible under the parol evidence rule.

Answer: B
