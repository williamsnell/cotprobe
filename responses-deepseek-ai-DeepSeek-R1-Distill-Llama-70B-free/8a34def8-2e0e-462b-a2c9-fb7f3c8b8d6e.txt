Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the refracting power of a spherical refracting surface. The setup is that the surface has a radius of 20 cm and it's separating air (n=1) from glass (n=1.5). The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that refracting power is related to diopters, which is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think the refracting power (D) is given by the formula D = (n2 - n1) / R, but wait, no, maybe there's more to it.

Wait, the lensmaker's formula for a single surface might be different. Oh right, for a single spherical surface, the formula for the power is D = (n2 - n1) / R, where R is the radius of curvature. But wait, I'm not sure about the sign here. Oh, right, the sign depends on whether the surface is convex or concave. But in this problem, I don't think the shape is given, just that it's a spherical refracting surface.

Wait, the problem says it's a separating air and glass, so I think the radius is measured from the medium on the left. So if it's a plano-convex lens, for example, the radius would be positive when going from air to glass. But wait, maybe I should clarify the formula.

I think the formula for the power of a single surface is given by D = (n2/n1 - 1) / R, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up with the lensmaker's formula. Let me think again.

The lensmaker's formula for a thin lens is (1/f) = (n_rel -1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where n_rel is the relative refractive index. But that's for a lens with two surfaces. Here, it's just a single surface, so maybe the formula is simpler.

Oh wait, the refracting power for a single spherical surface is D = (n2 - n1) * (1/R), but I'm not certain. Or is it (n2/n1 - 1)/R?

Wait, I think I should look up the formula properly, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it. The focal length for a single surface when going from medium 1 to medium 2 is given by f = (n2 * R) / (n2 - n1), but wait, that might be the case for a plano-convex lens. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the sign conventions. If the surface is convex towards the incoming light (like a plano-convex lens), then the radius R is positive when going from a medium with lower refractive index to higher. So in this case, from air (n1=1) to glass (n2=1.5), the radius is positive.

So the formula for the focal length f is (n2 R) / (n2 - n1). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I think the formula might be f = (R * n1) / (n2 - n1). Because when n2 > n1, the focal length is positive, indicating a converging surface.

So if f = (n1 R) / (n2 - n1), then the refracting power D is 1/f, which would be (n2 - n1)/(n1 R).

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. n1 is 1, n2 is 1.5, R is 20 cm which is 0.2 meters.

So D = (1.5 - 1) / (1 * 0.2 m) = 0.5 / 0.2 = 2.5 diopters.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct formula. Alternatively, if the formula is D = (n2 - n1)/R, regardless of the medium, then (1.5-1)/0.2 = 0.5 / 0.2 = 2.5 diopters as well. Hmm, same result.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the diopter is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. So if I calculate f correctly, then D is 1/f.

So let me get back to the focal length. For a single spherical surface, the focal length is given by f = (n2 R) / (n2 - n1). Wait no, maybe it's f = (R (n2 - n1)) / (n2). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that for a plano-convex lens made of a medium with refractive index n, the focal length in air is f = R/(n-1). So if R is 20 cm, and n=1.5, then f=20/(1.5-1)=20/0.5=40 cm, which is 0.4 meters. So the power would be 1/0.4 = 2.5 diopters.

Wait, but that's for a plano-convex lens, which has two surfaces. But in this problem, it's a single surface. So maybe the formula is different.

Wait, for a single surface, when light goes from air (n1=1) into glass (n2=1.5), the formula for the focal length f is f = (n2 R) / (n2 - n1). So plugging in, f = (1.5 * 20 cm) / (0.5) )= (30 cm) / 0.5 = 60 cm = 0.6 meters. Then D = 1/0.6 â‰ˆ 1.666 diopters, which isn't matching any options except maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier when I considered the plano-convex lens, I got 2.5 diopters which is one of the options (option H). But that was for a lens with two surfaces. So perhaps the single surface's power is half that.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing two different things. Let me think again.

The formula for a single spherical surface is D = (n2 - n1) / R, where R is in meters. So R is 0.2 m. So D = (1.5-1)/0.2 = 0.5/0.2 = 2.5 diopters. So that's option H.

Wait, but I thought the lensmaker's formula for a single surface is different. Oh wait, perhaps I was correct the first time. So the answer would be 2.5 diopters.

Looking back at the options, option H is 2.5 diopters. So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the refracting power of a spherical refracting surface separating air (n = 1) from glass (n = 1.5) with a radius of 20 cm, we use the formula for the refracting power of a single surface:

\[
D = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}
\]

Here:
- \(n_1 = 1\) (refractive index of air),
- \(n_2 = 1.5\) (refractive index of glass),
- \(R = 20 \, \text{cm} = 0.2 \, \text{m}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
D = \frac{1.5 - 1}{0.2} = \frac{0.5}{0.2} = 2.5 \, \text{diopters}.
\]

Thus, the refracting power of the spherical refracting surface is **2.5 diopters**.

The correct answer is **H: 2.5 diopters**.
