Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: s^4 + 3s^3 + 2s^2 + 2s + 1 = 0. Hmm, quartic equation. Quartic can be a bit tricky, but maybe I can factor it somehow or use substitution.

Wait, let me think about factoring. Sometimes quartic equations can be factored into quadratics or even into products of lower-degree polynomials. Let me see if I can group terms or find a pattern here.

Looking at the equation: s^4 + 3s^3 + 2s^2 + 2s + 1. Let me try to group the terms to see if that helps. Maybe group the first two and the next two, but that might not work. Alternatively, I could try to write it as a quadratic in s^2, but the presence of the s^3 and s terms complicates that.

Another approach is to see if it can be factored into two quadratics. Let's suppose that it factors into (s^2 + a s + b)(s^2 + c s + d). Multiplying these out gives s^4 + (a + c)s^3 + (ac + b + d)s^2 + (ad + bc)s + b d.

Comparing coefficients with our equation:

- The coefficient of s^4 is 1, which matches.
- For s^3: a + c = 3.
- For s^2: a c + b + d = 2.
- For s: a d + b c = 2.
- Constant term: b d = 1.

Hmm, I need to find a, c, b, d that satisfy these equations. Let's think about possible integer values. Since b d =1, possible pairs are (1,1) or (-1,-1). Let's try b=1 and d=1.

Then, the equations become:

a + c = 3.

a c + 1 + 1 = 2 → a c = 0.

a d + b c = a*1 +1*c = a + c = 2? Wait, but earlier a + c is 3. Wait, that's a problem. Because a + c is 3, but in the equation for the s term, a + c would be 3, but according to the equation, a d + b c is 2. So that's a contradiction. So b=1 and d=1 doesn't work.

What if b=-1 and d=-1? Then b d = (-1)(-1)=1, which fits. Let's try that.

Now, the equations:

a + c =3.

a c + (-1) + (-1) = a c - 2 =2 → a c =4.

And a d + b c = a*(-1) + (-1)*c = -a -c = 2? Because the coefficient of s is 2.

So, from a + c =3, and -a -c =2. Wait, adding these two equations: (a + c) + (-a -c) = 3 + 2 → 0=5, which is impossible. So that's not working either. So factoring into two quadratics with integer coefficients might not be straightforward.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe substitution. Let me set y = s + something. Let me see if substituting t = s + k for some k could simplify the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be expressed as a product of (s^2 + m s + n)(s^2 + p s + q). Maybe using real coefficients, not necessarily integers.

Alternatively, maybe using the rational root theorem to find possible roots. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (1) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1), so possible roots are ±1.

Let me test s=1: 1 +3 +2 +2 +1=9≠0. Not a root. s=-1: 1 -3 +2 -2 +1= -1 ≠0. So no rational roots. Hmm, so the equation doesn't factor easily with rational roots. So perhaps I need to find the roots using methods for quartic equations, or maybe synthetic division isn't helpful here.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to write the quartic as a quadratic in (s^2 + a s). Let me try that. Let me write s^4 +3 s^3 + 2 s^2 +2 s +1.

Let me see: s^4 +3 s^3 can be written as s^3(s +3). Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe complete the square or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be expressed as (s^2 + a s + b)^2 + some remainder. Let me try that. Let me compute (s^2 + a s + b)^2: s^4 + 2a s^3 + (a^2 + 2b)s^2 + 2ab s + b^2.

Comparing to our equation: s^4 +3 s^3 +2 s^2 +2 s +1.

So, equate coefficients:

2a =3 → a=3/2.

a^2 + 2b =2 → (9/4) + 2b =2 → 2b = 2 - 9/4 = -1/4 → b= -1/8.

2ab =2 → 2*(3/2)*(-1/8) = (3)*(-1/8) = -3/8. But in our equation, it's 2. So that doesn't match. So that approach doesn't work.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the quartic can be written as (s^2 + p s + q)(s^2 + r s + t) but with real coefficients. Let me try that again, without assuming integer coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution: Let me set u = s + 1/s. Wait, but that might complicate things more. Alternatively, perhaps set u = s + k, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the substitution t = s + (3/(4*1)) s^(some power). Wait, that's probably not the way. Alternatively, perhaps using Ferrari's solution for quartic equations. But that's a bit involved, and I don't remember all the steps, but maybe I can try.

Ferrari's method involves converting the quartic into a depressed quartic and then solving. Let me try that.

Given the quartic equation: s^4 + 3 s^3 + 2 s^2 + 2 s +1=0.

First, I can make a substitution to eliminate the cubic term. Let me set s = y - b/(4a). Here, a=1, b=3, so s = y - 3/(4*1) = y - 3/4.

Substituting s = y - 3/4 into the equation. Let me calculate each term:

s = y - 3/4.

s^4 = (y - 3/4)^4. Hmm, this would take some time to expand.

But perhaps let me compute each power step by step.

s = y - 3/4.

s^2 = (y - 3/4)^2 = y^2 - (3/2)y + 9/16.

s^3 = s^2 * s = (y^2 - (3/2)y +9/16)(y -3/4) = y^3 - (3/4)y^2 - (3/2)y^2 + (9/8)y + (9/16)y - 27/64.

Wait, let me compute that properly:

Multiply each term:

y^2*(y - 3/4) = y^3 - (3/4)y^2.

(-3/2 y)*(y -3/4) = -3/2 y^2 + (9/8)y.

(9/16)*(y -3/4) = (9/16)y - 27/64.

Now, add them all together:

y^3 - (3/4)y^2 - (3/2)y^2 + (9/8)y + (9/16)y -27/64.

Combine like terms:

y^3 + [ (-3/4 -3/2) ] y^2 + [ (9/8 +9/16) ] y + (-27/64).

Compute coefficients:

-3/4 -3/2 = (-3/4 -6/4) = -9/4.

9/8 +9/16 = (18/16 +9/16) =27/16.

So s^3 = y^3 - (9/4)y^2 + (27/16)y -27/64.

Now, s^4 = s^3 * s = [y^3 - (9/4)y^2 + (27/16)y -27/64]*(y -3/4).

This is getting a bit complicated, but let's proceed.

Compute each term:

y^3*(y -3/4) = y^4 - (3/4)y^3.

(-9/4 y^2)*(y -3/4) = -9/4 y^3 + 27/16 y^2.

(27/16 y)*(y -3/4) = 27/16 y^2 - 81/64 y.

(-27/64)*(y -3/4) = -27/64 y + 81/256.

Now, add all these terms together:

y^4 - (3/4)y^3 - (9/4)y^3 + (27/16)y^2 + (27/16)y^2 - (81/64)y - (27/64)y + 81/256.

Combine like terms:

y^4 + [ (-3/4 -9/4) ] y^3 + [ (27/16 +27/16) ] y^2 + [ (-81/64 -27/64) ] y + 81/256.

Compute coefficients:

-3/4 -9/4 = -12/4 = -3.

27/16 +27/16 =54/16 =27/8.

-81/64 -27/64 = -108/64 = -27/16.

So s^4 = y^4 -3y^3 + (27/8)y^2 - (27/16)y + 81/256.

Now, substitute into the original equation:

s^4 +3s^3 +2s^2 +2s +1 = 0.

Substituting each term:

s^4 = y^4 -3y^3 + (27/8)y^2 - (27/16)y + 81/256.

3s^3 =3*(y^3 - (9/4)y^2 + (27/16)y -27/64) = 3y^3 - (27/4)y^2 + (81/16)y -81/64.

2s^2 =2*(y^2 - (3/2)y +9/16) = 2y^2 -3y + 9/8.

2s =2*(y -3/4) =2y - 3/2.

Adding all terms together:

s^4 +3s^3 +2s^2 +2s +1 =

[y^4 -3y^3 + (27/8)y^2 - (27/16)y + 81/256] 

+ [3y^3 - (27/4)y^2 + (81/16)y -81/64]

+ [2y^2 -3y + 9/8]

+ [2y -3/2]

+1 =0.

Now, combine like terms:

y^4 

+ (-3y^3 +3y^3) → 0.

+ (27/8 y^2 -27/4 y^2 +2y^2)

Let me compute 27/8 -27/4 +2.

Convert to eighths: 27/8 -54/8 +16/8 = (27-54+16)/8 = (-11)/8.

So y^2 term is (-11/8)y^2.

Next, y terms:

-27/16 y +81/16 y -3y +2y.

Convert all to sixteenths:

-27/16 +81/16 =54/16=27/8.

-3y is -48/16 y, and 2y is 32/16 y.

So total y terms: (27/8 -48/16 +32/16) y.

Wait, perhaps better to compute in fractions.

-27/16 +81/16 = (54/16) = 27/8.

-3y +2y = -y → -1y.

So 27/8 y - y = (27/8 -8/8) y = 19/8 y.

Constant terms:

81/256 -81/64 +9/8 -3/2 +1.

Convert all to 256 denominator:

81/256 - (81*4)/256 = -324/256.

9/8 = 288/256.

-3/2= -384/256.

+1 =256/256.

So add all: 81 -324 +288 -384 +256 = Let's compute step by step:

81 -324 = -243.

-243 +288=45.

45 -384= -339.

-339 +256= -83.

So -83/256.

Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

y^4 + (-11/8)y^2 + (19/8)y -83/256 =0.

Hmm, this is a quartic in y without the y^3 term, which is what we wanted. Now, according to Ferrari's method, we can write this as y^4 + p y^2 + q y + r =0, where p=-11/8, q=19/8, r=-83/256.

Ferrari's method introduces a parameter t and writes the quartic as (y^2 + (p/2) + t)^2 - [2 t y^2 - q y + (t^2 + (p^2)/4 - r)] =0.

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact steps. Let me see: The idea is to express the quartic as a square of a quadratic minus another square, so you can factor it into two quadratics.

So, y^4 + p y^2 + q y + r = (y^2 + a y + b)^2 - (c y + d)^2.

Alternatively, I might have to look up the exact steps, but I'll try to proceed.

The standard method is to write the quartic as y^4 + p y^2 + q y + r = (y^2 + m y + n)^2 - (s y + t)^2, then factor it as [y^2 + m y +n - (s y +t)][y^2 +m y +n + (s y +t)].

But perhaps a better approach is to use the depressed quartic equation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution z = y^2 + k, but I might be getting stuck here. Alternatively, maybe I can use numerical methods or look for patterns.

Wait, maybe I can find the roots numerically. Let me try plugging in some values to estimate the real roots.

Let me compute f(s) = s^4 +3 s^3 +2 s^2 +2 s +1.

Let me evaluate at s = -3: (-3)^4 +3*(-3)^3 +2*(-3)^2 +2*(-3)+1 =81-81+18-6+1=13.

At s=-2: 16 + (-24) +8 + (-4)+1= (16-24)= -8 +8=0, 0-4+1=-3.

So f(-2)=-3.

At s=-1:1 -3 +2 -2 +1= -1.

At s=0: 0+0+0+0+1=1.

So between s=-3 and s=-2, f(s) goes from 13 to -3, so a root exists there.

Between s=-2 and s=-1, f(-2)=-3 and f(-1)=-1, so it's negative in that interval, but maybe another root.

Wait, wait, wait, let me compute at s=-2.5: s=-2.5.

s^4= (2.5)^4= approx (5/2)^4=625/16=39.0625.

3s^3=3*(-15.625)= -46.875.

2s^2=2*(6.25)=12.5.

2s=2*(-2.5)= -5.

So total: 39.0625 -46.875 +12.5 -5 +1= Let's compute step by step:

39.0625 -46.875 = -7.8125.

-7.8125 +12.5=4.6875.

4.6875 -5= -0.3125.

-0.3125 +1=0.6875>0.

So f(-2.5)=0.6875>0.

f(-2)= -3, so between s=-2.5 and s=-2, f goes from positive to negative, so a root exists there.

Similarly, between s=-2 and s=-1, f(s) is negative, but maybe another root.

Wait, let me check s=-0.5:

s^4= (0.5)^4=0.0625.

3s^3=3*(-0.125)= -0.375.

2s^2=2*(0.25)=0.5.

2s=2*(-0.5)=-1.

+1.

So total: 0.0625 -0.375 +0.5 -1 +1= 0.0625 -0.375= -0.3125 +0.5=0.1875 -1= -0.8125 +1=0.1875>0.

So f(-0.5)=0.1875>0.

Earlier, f(-1)=-1<0. So between s=-1 and s=-0.5, f goes from -1 to +0.1875, so another real root.

So we have two real roots: one around s=-2.5 to s=-2, another around s=-1 to s=-0.5.

Wait, but quartic can have up to four real roots, but sometimes two real and two complex. But given the options have four roots, two real and two complex conjugates.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to factor the quart
