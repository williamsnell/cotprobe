Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the mass transfer coefficient for ammonia in the liquid phase. Hmm, I've studied a bit about mass transfer in my chemical engineering class, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that a gas containing NH3 is flowing through a tube absorber, and the inside of the tubes is wetted with water at a rate of 5000 kg/hr. There are 55 tubes, each with an internal diameter (ID) of 60mm and a length of 5 meters. The average temperature is 30°C. I need to find the mass transfer coefficient beta for ammonia in the liquid phase.

Wait, mass transfer coefficient, right. I remember that in absorption, the mass transfer can be calculated using certain correlations. Oh right, the formula often involves the Sherwood number, which relates to the mass transfer coefficient. The Sherwood number (Sh) is equal to beta * d/D, where d is the diameter and D is the diffusion coefficient. Or wait, maybe it's beta multiplied by the characteristic length divided by the diffusion coefficient. Oh right, the exact formula is Sh = (beta * L) / D, where L is the length of the tube or the characteristic dimension.

Alternatively, I think there's a correlation for mass transfer in wetted-wall columns or tubes. The wetted-wall column is a common setup where a liquid flows down the inside of a vertical tube, and a gas flows upward. The mass transfer happens through the liquid film on the tube wall.

The correlation for the Sherwood number in a wetted-wall column under laminar flow conditions is often given by Sh = ( (4 * G) / (π * μ * L) )^(1/3) * (μ / ρ D)^(1/3) * something else? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up different formulas.

Wait, another thought: the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid phase can be calculated using the equation derived from the penetration theory or the film theory. For a wetted-wall column, the correlation is Sh = ( (4 * G) / (π * μ * L) )^(1/3) * (μ / (ρ D)) )^(1/3) * something else? Or maybe Sh is proportional to (Re)^(something) * (Sc)^(1/3), where Re is the Reynolds number and Sc is the Schmidt number.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for the wetted-wall column is Sh = ( (4 * G) / (μ * L) )^(1/3) * (μ / (ρ D))^(1/3). Let me see. The Sherwood number Sh is beta * L / D, where beta is the mass transfer coefficient, and L is the length of the tube.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this properly.

First, I need to calculate the mass flow rate of the liquid. The total flow rate is 5000 kg/hr, and there are 55 tubes. So each tube has a flow rate of 5000 / 55 kg/hr. Let me compute that: 5000 divided by 55. 55 times 90 is 4950, so 5000 - 4950 is 50, which would give 90 + (50/55)= approximately 90.909 kg/hr per tube. So G, the mass flow rate per tube, is about 90.909 kg/hr. Wait, but mass flow rate is in kg/m²·s usually, or kg/(m·hr). Hmm, maybe I need to convert the units properly.

Wait, the mass flow rate per tube is 5000 kg/hr divided by 55 tubes, so 5000/55 = approx 90.909 kg/hr per tube. But to find the liquid flow rate in terms of velocity, we probably need to find the mass velocity, which is mass flow rate per unit area.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to find the velocity of the liquid in the tube. The mass flow rate per tube is 5000/55 kg/hr. Let's compute that exactly. 5000 divided by 55 equals approximately 90.909 kg/hr per tube.

Wait, the diameter is 60 mm, which is 0.06 meters. So the cross-sectional area of each tube is π*(d/2)^2. So area A = π*(0.06/2)^2 = π*(0.03)^2 = π*0.0009 ≈ 0.002827 m².

The mass flow rate per tube is 90.909 kg/hr. To get the mass velocity (mass flow per area), G would be (90.909 kg/hr) / (0.002827 m²). Let me compute that: 90.909 / 0.002827 ≈ let me calculate. 90 / 0.0028 is 90 / 0.0028 ≈ 32142.857. So approximately 32,143 kg/(m²·hr). Wait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct.

But wait, another approach: the mass flow rate per tube is 90.909 kg/hr. So the mass velocity (G*) would be the mass flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area. So G* = (90.909 kg/hr) / (0.002827 m²) ≈ 32,187 kg/(m²·hr).

But wait, mass velocity is usually in kg/(m·s) or kg/(m²·s). Let's convert kg/hr to kg/s. Since 1 hour is 3600 seconds, 32,187 kg/(m²·hr) is 32,187 / 3600 ≈ 8.935 kg/(m²·s).

But perhaps using the correct units is important. Let me think about the formula again.

The Sherwood number for a wetted-wall column (where liquid flows inside the tube and gas outside) is given by:

Sh = ( (4 * G) / (μ * L) )^(1/3) * (μ / (ρ D))^(1/3)

Wait, I'm getting this from my notes. Let me check the formula again. The formula for Sh in a wetted-wall column is Sh = (4 G/(μ L))^(1/3) * (μ/(ρ D))^(1/3). So Sh is the product of these two terms each raised to the 1/3 power.

Alternatively, some sources say Sh = ( (4 G)/(μ L) )^(1/3) * (μ/ (ρ D))^(1/3) = (4 G μ)/(μ ρ D L) )^(1/3) ) = (4 G) / (ρ D L) )^(1/3), but I might be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly. The correct expression is Sh = (4 G / (μ L))^(1/3) * (μ/(ρ D))^(1/3). Because the first term is (4G/(μ L))^(1/3), and the second term is (μ/(ρ D))^(1/3). Multiplying these together, the exponents add up because they're both to the 1/3.

So Sh = (4 G μ) / (μ ρ D L) )^(1/3) → Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me compute it properly.

Multiply the two terms:

(4 G/(μ L))^(1/3) * (μ/(ρ D))^(1/3) = [ (4 G/(μ L)) * (μ/(ρ D)) ) ]^(1/3)

The μ in the numerator and denominator cancels, so we get [ (4 G) / (L ρ D) ) ]^(1/3).

So Sh = [ (4 G) / (L ρ D) ) ]^(1/3)

Wait, that seems simpler. So Sh = (4 G/(L ρ D))^(1/3)

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. G is the mass flow rate per unit perimeter, perhaps? Or is it the mass flow rate per unit area?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the variables. Let me clarify the variables in the formula.

In the wetted-wall column, G is the mass flow rate per unit length of the tube (kg/(m·s)), μ is the viscosity, L is the length of the tube, ρ is the liquid density, and D is the diffusion coefficient of NH3 in water.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that for a wetted-wall column, the mass transfer coefficient can be calculated using the following equation:

beta = (Sh * D) / L

And Sh = (4 G/(μ L))^(1/3) * (μ/(ρ D))^(1/3)

Wait, that brings us back to the same point.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is Sh = ( (4 G)/(μ L) )^(1/3) * (μ/(ρ D))^(1/3), which can be rewritten as Sh = (4 G μ)/(ρ D L μ))^(1/3). The μ terms cancel, leading to Sh = (4 G/(ρ D L))^(1/3).

Wait, that makes sense. So Sh is the cube root of (4G)/(rho D L).

Now, I need to compute Sh using this formula. But to do that, I need the values of G, rho, D, and L.

Wait, G is the mass flow rate per unit length? I'm not sure. Let me think again. G is the mass velocity, which is the mass flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area.

Wait, perhaps I should define G as the mass flow rate per unit area. So G would be in kg/(m²·s). But earlier I thought G was flow rate per tube, which is 90.909 kg/hr. Let me recompute.

Each tube's mass flow rate is 5000 kg/hr /55 tubes ≈ 90.909 kg/hr. So per second, that's 90.909 / 3600 ≈ 0.02525 kg/s.

The cross-sectional area of each tube is π*(0.06 m / 2)^2 = π*0.03^2 = 0.002827 m².

So the mass velocity (G) would be mass flow rate per area, which is 0.02525 kg/s / 0.002827 m² ≈ 8.935 kg/(m²·s).

Wait, but in the formula, G is in kg/(m·s), perhaps? Because in the wetted-wall column, the liquid flows as a film, so the mass flow rate per unit length (kg/(m·s)) might be more relevant.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the units. Let me think: the mass flow rate per unit length would be in kg/(m·s), which is mass per second per meter length. So for a single tube, the mass flow rate is 0.02525 kg/s. The tube is 5 meters long, so the mass flow rate per unit length is 0.02525 /5 = 0.00505 kg/(m·s).

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the liquid is flowing through the entire length, the flow rate per meter of tube length would be that value.

So G = 0.00505 kg/(m·s).

Now, I need the other properties. The problem doesn't give me the viscosity (μ) or the density (ρ) of the liquid, which is water at 30°C. I also need the diffusion coefficient (D) of NH3 in water at 30°C.

I'll have to use standard values for these properties.

At 30°C:
- Density of water (ρ) is approximately 995 kg/m³.
- Viscosity of water (μ) is about 0.000796 kg/(m·s) or 0.796 mPa·s.
- The diffusion coefficient of NH3 in water is around 1.7 x 10^-9 m²/s. Wait, I think it's higher than that. Let me recall: for gases in water, D is on the order of 1e-9 to 1e-8 m²/s. But for NH3, I think it's about 1.7e-9 m²/s at 25°C. Since temperature increases D, maybe it's a bit higher at 30°C, but I'll proceed with 1.7e-9 m²/s for now.

So, putting the numbers together:

G = 0.00505 kg/(m·s)
L = 5 m (length of the tube)
μ = 0.000796 kg/(m·s)
ρ = 995 kg/m³
D = 1.7e-9 m²/s

Now compute Sh using the formula Sh = (4 G/(ρ D L))^(1/3).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Compute 4G: 4 * 0.00505 = 0.0202 kg/(m·s)

Now multiply by 1/(rho D L): (0.0202) / (995 * 1.7e-9 *5)

Compute denominator: 995 * 1.7e-9 = approx 1.6945e-6. Then multiply by 5: 8.4725e-6.

So 4G/(rho D L) = 0.0202 / 8.4725e-6 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0202 / 8.4725e-6 ≈ 0.0202 / 0.0000084725 ≈ approx 2384.3.

Now take the cube root of 2384.3.

The cube root of 2384. Let's see: 13^3 is 2197, 14^3 is 2744. So 13.5^3: 13.5 *13.5=182.25; 182.25*13.5 ≈ 2459. So 13.5^3 ≈ 2459, which is a bit higher than 2384.

So cube root of 2384 ≈ approx 13.3.

So Sh ≈ 13.3.

Wait, wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Compute 2384.3^(1/3):

Let me try 13.3^3: 13^3 is 2197. 0.3^3 is 0.027. But more accurately, 13.3 *13.3 = 176.89. 176.89 *13.3 = let's compute:

176.89 *10 = 1768.9

176.89 *3 = 530.67

176.89 *0.3 = 53.067

Total = 1768.9 + 530.67 = 2299.57 +53.067 = 2352.637.

So 13.3^3 ≈ 2352.64, which is less than 2384.3.

The difference is 2384.3 - 2352.64 = 31.66.

So 31.66 / (3*(13.3)^2) ) ≈ 31.66/(3*176.89) ) ≈ 31.66/530.67 ≈ 0.0597.

So next approximation: 13.3 + 0.0597 ≈ 13.3597.

So Sh ≈ 13.36.

Now, Sh is beta * L / D. Because Sh = (beta * L)/D.

So beta = (Sh * D) / L

Plugging in the numbers:

Sh = 13.36
D = 1.7e-9 m²/s
L =5 m

beta = (13.36 * 1.7e-9) /5 = ?

Compute numerator: 13.36 *1.7e-9 = approx 22.712e-9 = 2.2712e-8.

Divide by 5: 2.2712e-8 /5 = 4.5424e-9 m/s.

Wait, beta is in m/s? Yes, because Sh is dimensionless, D is m²/s, L is m. So beta has units of m/s.

But the options are given in kg/(m²·hr). Hmm, that's different. So I need to convert beta from m/s to kg/(m²·hr).

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Wait no, beta is the mass transfer coefficient, which in liquid phase typically has units of m/s, because it's defined as the rate of mass transfer per unit area per unit concentration. But when concentration is in kmol/m³, the flux would be kmol/(m²·s), and beta has units of m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're in kg/(m²·hr). That's kg per square meter per hour, which is a mass flux. But beta itself is a coefficient with units of velocity (m/s). Hmm, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the Sherwood number is Sh = beta * L / D, where beta is in m/s, L in meters, D in m²/s. So the units of Sh are (m/s * m) / (m²/s) )= (m²/s) / (m²/s) → dimensionless. Correct.

So beta = (Sh * D) / L → units of (D m²/s * Sh (dimensionless)) / m → (m²/s) / m → m/s.

So beta is in m/s.

But the options are in kg/(m²·hr). That's a mass flux unit. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks for the mass transfer coefficient, which should have units of m/s, but the options are in kg/(m²·hr). So maybe I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the mass flux, which is beta multiplied by the concentration difference. But the problem doesn't give any concentration data, so that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula, such as the mass transfer coefficient expressed in terms of mass flow.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the mass transfer coefficient in terms of the flow rate and other variables. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the mass transfer coefficient (k_L) can be found using the equation k_L = (D * Sh) / L. Which is the same as we've been using.

But perhaps, in this case, the question is asking for the mass transfer coefficient in terms of the mass flux, which is kg/(m²·hr). Wait, no, that doesn't align because beta (k_L) is in m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the mass transfer coefficient in terms of the mass flow per area, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me re
