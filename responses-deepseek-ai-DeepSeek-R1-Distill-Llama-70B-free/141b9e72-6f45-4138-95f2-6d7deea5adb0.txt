Question:

A defendant was charged with vehicular battery after driving through a red light and crashing into a woman's small convertible. The woman suffered massive internal injuries and lapsed into a coma for several hours after she reached the hospital. The woman's best friend, who was a passenger in the car, miraculously received only a few minor bruises. After the collision, the passenger stayed with the woman trying to comfort her until the ambulance arrived. At trial, the passenger is called to testify. While on the witness stand, she gazes with sorrow at the woman, who is still wearing a cast on her leg. The passenger testifies that the first thing she remembered seeing after the accident was the woman's bloodied body trapped in the mangled wreckage. The state's attorney then asked the passenger if the woman said anything to her before being taken to the hospital. The passenger answered, "Yes, she told me: I know I'm dying. Why did he have to run that red light?"Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the court should rule the passenger's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the woman's statement could be considered prejudicial against the defendant.
B: admissible, because it is irrelevant that this is not a homicide case.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: inadmissible, because of the close relationship between the woman and the passenger.
E: admissible, because the woman's statement was made as part of her medical history.
F: inadmissible, because the woman's statement is speculative and not a fact.
G: admissible, because the woman believed her death was imminent when she made the declaration.
H: inadmissible, because the passenger's emotional state might affect her memory of the event.
I: admissible, because the passenger is a direct witness to the accident.
J: admissible, because the woman's statement is a spontaneous utterance made under stress.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a trial where a defendant is charged with vehicular battery. The defendant ran a red light and crashed into a woman's car. The woman was seriously injured, went into a coma, and her passenger, who's her best friend, only had minor bruises. The passenger is testifying and says that the woman told her, "I know I'm dying. Why did he have to run that red light?" before being taken to the hospital. The defense attorney objects, and we need to determine if this statement is admissible.

First, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the woman's statement is being offered to show that the defendant ran a red light, which would make him guilty. But is there an exception that applies here?

I think about the hearsay exceptions. One is the dying declaration. A dying declaration is admissible if the declarant believed their death was imminent. But wait, I think this exception only applies in homicide cases or when the declarant actually dies. In this case, the woman didn't die; she survived, albeit with serious injuries. So if she didn't die, does the dying declaration still apply? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Another exception is the excited utterance, which is part of the present sense impressions or under stress. An excited utterance is made under the stress of a startling event and relates to that event. The woman was just in a severe accident, severely injured, and made the statement right after. That sounds like it could qualify as an excited utterance. The statement was made while she was under the stress of the accident, trying to make sense of what happened.

Wait, but the statement includes an opinion about the defendant running the red light. Does that matter? Or is it okay because it's part of her immediate reaction? I think the content doesn't necessarily disqualify it as an excited utterance. The key is the circumstances under which it was made.

Also, there's the issue of whether the statement is being used for the truth. The passenger is recounting the woman's statement to prove that the defendant ran the red light, which is a key fact in the case. So it's hearsay, but if it fits an exception, it's admissible.

If the dying declaration doesn't apply because she didn't die, then excited utterance might be the way to go. So under FRE 803(2), excited utterances are admissible. The statement was made in the aftermath of the accident while the woman was still under the stress of the event. She was bleeding, trapped, and in a coma later, so the stress would still be present.

Alternatively, could it be a present sense impression? That's when a statement describes an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. But I think excited utterance is a better fit here because of the stress involved.

So, looking at the options:

Option J says it's admissible as a spontaneous utterance under stress. That aligns with the excited utterance exception. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option G says it's admissible because she believed death was imminent. But if she survived, the dying declaration exception might not apply. So G might not be correct. Option C says it's inadmissible as hearsay without exception, but if excited utterance applies, C is wrong.

So the correct answer should be J.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by the injured woman to her passenger after a car accident. The woman's statement, "I know I'm dying. Why did he have to run that red light?" is being offered into evidence at trial. The key issue is whether this statement qualifies under a hearsay exception.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The woman's statement is hearsay because it is being used to prove that the defendant ran the red light. However, hearsay exceptions can make such statements admissible. Two potential exceptions are considered here: the dying declaration and the excited utterance.

1. **Dying Declaration (Option G):** A dying declaration is admissible if the declarant believed their death was imminent at the time of the statement. However, this exception typically applies in homicide cases or when the declarant actually dies. Since the woman survived, this exception likely does not apply.

2. **Excited Utterance (Option J):** An excited utterance is admissible under FRE 803(2) if it was made under the stress of a startling event and relates to that event. The woman's statement was made immediately after the accident, while she was under the stress of the event and suffering from serious injuries. This makes it a strong candidate for the excited utterance exception.

Other options, such as Option C (hearsay without an exception), do not apply because the statement fits the excited utterance exception. Therefore, the correct answer is that the statement is admissible as a spontaneous utterance made under stress.

**Answer: J**
