Question:

A patent holder brought a patent infringement action in federal court against a licensee of the patent. The patent holder believed that a jury would be more sympathetic to his claims than a judge, and asked his lawyer to obtain a jury trial. What should the lawyer do to secure the patent holder's right to a jury trial?

Options:

A: File and serve a jury trial demand within 60 days after the close of the pleadings.
B: File and serve a jury trial demand within 30 days after the close of the pleadings.
C: File and serve a jury trial demand at the initial court hearing.
D: File and serve a complaint that excludes a jury trial demand.
E: Make a verbal request for a jury trial during the first court hearing.
F: Make a jury trial demand at the initial pretrial conference.
G: File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand.
H: File and serve a jury trial demand within 14 days after the complaint was served.

Okay, so I have this question about patent law and civil procedure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about a patent holder suing a licensee in federal court for infringement. The patent holder wants a jury trial because they think a jury would be more sympathetic. The question is, what should the lawyer do to secure the right to a jury trial.

I remember that in federal courts, the right to a jury trial is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 38. I think Rule 38 deals with demanding a jury trial. Let me try to recall the details.

Under Rule 38(b), a party may demand a jury trial by serving the other parties with a written demand—which is usually part of the pleadings. The timing is important. I think the demand has to be made within a certain number of days after the last pleading is served. Or wait, is it after the close of the pleadings?

Wait, the pleadings are the complaint, answer, and any counterclaims or replies. The "close of pleadings" is when all the pleadings are done. So, for a jury demand, the parties have a specific time frame to make that demand.

I remember that under Rule 38(d), a party waives their right to a jury trial if they don't serve a demand within the required time. So timing is crucial here.

Looking at the options, the choices are about when to file and serve the jury trial demand.

Option A says within 60 days after the close of the pleadings.
Option B is 30 days.
Option C is at the initial court hearing.
Option D is a complaint without a jury demand.
Option E is a verbal request during the first hearing.
Option F is at the pretrial conference.
Option G is a complaint that includes the demand.
Option H is within 14 days after the complaint was served.

Wait, I think the correct procedure is that a party must serve a written demand no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. Or maybe it's 30 days after the last pleading? Or perhaps it's 30 days after the answer is filed?

Wait, no, I think the rule is that a party may demand a jury trial by serving a demand no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served, and in any event no later than 14 days after the close of the pleadings. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the exact rule. Rule 38(b) says that any party may demand a jury trial by (1) serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served, and (2) filing the demand as required by Rule 5(d). 

Wait wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. So, according to Rule 38(b)(1), a party may demand a jury trial by: (A) serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served, or (B) filing a demand in accordance with Rule 5(d) within that 14-day period.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the time frames. Another thought: sometimes, parties have 30 days from when the issue is joined. Or perhaps it's 30 days after the answer is filed.

Wait, let's think about when the close of pleadings happens. The pleadings are closed when all the necessary pleadings have been filed. So for a case where the plaintiff files a complaint, the defendant files an answer, and that's it—no counterclaims or anything else—the pleadings are closed when the answer is filed.

So in that scenario, the last pleading directed to the issue is the answer. So the 14-day period would start from when the answer is served. So the plaintiff would have 14 days after the answer is served to demand a jury trial.

But in this question, the plaintiff is the patent holder. So when the defendant files an answer, the plaintiff has 14 days from then to serve a jury demand.

But looking at the options, option H says within 14 days after the complaint was served. That doesn't fit because the complaint is the initial pleading. The defendant's answer would come after that.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the timing. Let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. Plaintiff files complaint.
2. Defendant files answer.
3. Close of pleadings occurs when the answer is filed (assuming no counterclaims or other pleadings).

So the plaintiff would have 14 days from when the answer is served to file a jury demand. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options:

A: 60 days after close of pleadings.
B: 30 days.
C: Initial hearing.
D: No demand.
E: Verbal request.
F: Pretrial conference.
G: Complaint includes demand.
H: 14 days after complaint served.

Wait, none of the options directly say within 14 days after the answer is served. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have misunderstood.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: 30 days after close of pleadings. Because I might be wrong about the 14 days.

Wait, I think I'm confusing two different time periods. Let me check the exact rule.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(b)(1) states:

"A party may demand a jury trial by: (A) serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served, or (B) filing a demand in accordance with Rule 5(d) within that 14-day period."

So the demand must be served within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So if the last pleading is the answer, then 14 days after that. However, if the last pleading is a reply to a counterclaim, then the 14 days run from that.

But looking at the options provided, the relevant one would be H: 14 days after the complaint was served. But that's not correct because the complaint is the first pleading, and the last pleading is the answer or another subsequent pleading.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A or B.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. The Federal Rules also have Rule 38(d), which says that a party waives a jury trial if they don't comply with Rule 38.

So, if the plaintiff wants a jury trial, they must serve a demand within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So if the defendant files an answer, then plaintiff has 14 days from when that answer is served to make the demand.

But in the options, none of the choices directly state that. Let's look again.

Option A: 60 days after close of pleadings. Hmm, 60 days seems too long.

Option B: 30 days after close of pleadings.

Option H: 14 days after the complaint was served.

Wait, perhaps if the complaint includes a jury demand, that's acceptable. Because under Rule 38(b)(1), the demand can be included in a pleading.

So if the plaintiff files the complaint and includes a jury demand in it, that would be timely, right? Because the complaint is a pleading, so serving it with the demand meets the requirement.

But wait, what if the defendant files an answer later? Then the close of pleadings would be when the answer is filed. So if the plaintiff includes a demand in the complaint, does that suffice regardless of when the answer comes in?

Alternatively, the demand has to be made after the close of pleadings. No, that doesn't make sense because then it would be too late.

Wait, no, the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So if the plaintiff files a complaint and includes a jury demand in it, that's before the answer is even filed. So that would be early enough, because the last pleading (the answer) comes later.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Because the demand has to be made after the last pleading is served. So if you include a demand in the complaint, that's before the defendant's answer. So if the answer comes in and no one makes a demand within 14 days of that, then the right is waived.

So perhaps the plaintiff can't just include it in the complaint if they're the first to file. Because the defendant's answer is a later pleading, so the 14-day clock starts after the answer is served.

Alternatively, perhaps including a demand in the complaint is sufficient, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options.

Option G says file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand. So the plaintiff includes it in the complaint. Is that sufficient?

But the timing under Rule 38 is that the demand must be made no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So if the complaint includes the demand, but then the defendant files an answer (a pleading directed to the issue), the 14-day period would start from when the answer is served. So if the plaintiff already included a demand in the complaint, does that count as timely?

Alternatively, perhaps the demand in the complaint is premature. Because the answer hasn't been filed yet, so the last pleading hasn't been served.

Wait, but the rule allows the demand to be included in a pleading. So if the plaintiff includes it in the complaint, which is a pleading, that should be acceptable, as long as it's within the 14 days after the last pleading. But in this scenario, the last pleading would be the answer, so the plaintiff's demand in the complaint is before that. So it would be premature.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the safest way is for the plaintiff to wait until after the answer is filed and then serve a demand within 14 days.

But looking at the options, none of them mention after the answer is filed.

Wait, let me look again at the options:

Option A: 60 days after close of pleadings.

Option B: 30 days after close of pleadings.

Option H: 14 days after the complaint was served.

Option G: complaint includes demand.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G. Because the complaint is a pleading, and the demand can be included in a pleading. So as long as it's served with the complaint, it's timely, regardless of when the answer comes in.

But I'm not sure because the last pleading is the answer, so the 14 days run from that point. Including the demand in the complaint might not be sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps when the complaint is filed, it's the initial pleading. So if the plaintiff includes a jury demand in the complaint, which is served on the defendant, then if the defendant doesn't make a demand, the plaintiff's demand is timely, because it's within 14 days of the close of pleadings.

Wait, but the close of pleadings is after the answer is filed. So the complaint is the first pleading, and the answer is the second. So the close is when the answer is filed.

So if the plaintiff includes a demand in the complaint, that's before the close of pleadings. So the 14-day period would start after the answer is served. So the plaintiff's demand in the complaint would be too early, and might not be considered as timely.

Wait, but the rule says you can make the demand any time up to 14 days after the last pleading. So if you make it earlier, that's fine. Because the last pleading is the answer, but if the plaintiff makes the demand when filing the complaint, that's earlier than the last pleading, but still within the 14 days after the last pleading? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. The 14-day period starts after the last pleading is served. So if the last pleading is the answer, you have 14 days from when the answer is served to make the demand.

So if the plaintiff includes a demand in the complaint, which is served before the answer, then the 14-day period hasn't started yet. So the demand would be premature, and might not be valid. Because the demand has to be made after the last pleading is served.

Wait, but the rule says you can make the demand any time up to 14 days after the last pleading. So you can make it before the last pleading as well. Or does it have to be after the last pleading?

I'm getting confused. Let's check the rule again.

Rule 38(b)(1) says: serve a written demand no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served.

So the last pleading is, say, the answer. So the demand must be served within 14 days after the answer is served.

So if the plaintiff serves the complaint with a demand, and then the defendant serves an answer, the plaintiff's demand was before the last pleading, so it's not within the 14 days after the last pleading. Thus, the demand would be untimely.

Therefore, to make a timely demand, the plaintiff must serve the demand within 14 days after the answer is served.

So looking at the options, none of them directly state that. The options are about when to file and serve the demand.

Wait, perhaps the option that says within 14 days after the complaint was served is not correct because that's before the answer.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to file a demand within 30 days after the close of pleadings, but I don't think the rule says 30 days.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: under Rule 38, the demand must be filed within 14 days after the last pleading. So the correct answer would be the option that says within 14 days after the close of pleadings.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 60 days after close of pleadings.

Option B: 30 days after close of pleadings.

Option H: 14 days after the complaint was served.

Wait, none of the options say within 14 days after the last pleading. So perhaps the closest is option A or B.

Wait, but I'm almost certain that the correct time is 14 days after the last pleading. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest would be option H, but that's 14 days after complaint served, which is before the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or B, but I think the 14-day period is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think about another angle. The Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial is applicable in patent cases because they are cases at common law. So the right exists, but the procedure for demanding it is under the Federal Rules.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, if you don't make a timely demand, you can still have a jury trial if the court orders it, but that's discretionary. So the proper way is to make a timely demand.

In the options, option G says file a complaint that includes a jury demand. So that's making the demand in a pleading. But as I thought earlier, that might be premature if the answer comes later. So perhaps that's not sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to file a separate jury demand after the answer is filed. So the lawyer should wait until the answer is served, then file the demand within 14 days.

But none of the options mention that.

Looking again at the options, option A is 60 days after close of pleadings. Option B is 30 days. Option H is 14 days after complaint served.

Wait, I think the correct answer is option A or B. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this with the time to serve a demand under a different rule. Let me think... Oh, wait, perhaps the answer is option A: within 60 days after the close of the pleadings.

No, that can't be right because I think it's 14 days. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 30 days after close of pleadings. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact rule again. But since I can't, I'll have to rely on my memory.

Rule 38(b)(1) says the demand must be served no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So the time is 14 days after the close of pleadings.

Looking at the options, none of the options say 14 days after close of pleadings. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, the closest would be option H: within 14 days after the complaint was served. But that's not correct because the complaint is the first pleading, not the last.

Alternatively, perhaps option G is correct because the complaint includes the demand, but that's before the close of pleadings, which may not be timely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the complaint itself is a pleading, and including the demand in it is sufficient. Because the rule allows the demand to be included in a pleading. So if the plaintiff includes it in the complaint, which is a pleading, that serves as a demand. But the timing is still an issue.

Wait, if the complaint includes the demand, and the defendant files an answer, then the close of pleadings is after the answer. So the plaintiff's demand in the complaint was before the close of pleadings, so it's timely.

But according to Rule 38(b), the demand must be made no later than 14 days after the last pleading. So making the demand before the last pleading is acceptable because it's within the allowed time frame.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the rule says you can make the demand any time up to 14 days after the last pleading. So if you make it earlier, that's fine.

So if the plaintiff includes a jury demand in the complaint, which is served on the defendant, then the demand is timely, even though the answer hasn't been filed yet. Because the demand is made before the last pleading (the answer), but within the 14 days after the last pleading (which comes later). Wait, no, the 14 days run after the last pleading, so making the demand before that would actually be before the period starts, which would not be allowed.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach.

The correct procedure is to file and serve a jury trial demand within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So if the last pleading is the answer, then within 14 days after that, the plaintiff must serve the demand.

But in the options, there's no option that says that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options given, the best fit would be option H: within 14 days after the complaint was served.

But that's not correct because the complaint is the first pleading, and the answer is the last. So the 14 days should run after the answer, not the complaint.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 60 days after the close of pleadings. Because sometimes courts allow that, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, maybe I remember that the time limit is 10
