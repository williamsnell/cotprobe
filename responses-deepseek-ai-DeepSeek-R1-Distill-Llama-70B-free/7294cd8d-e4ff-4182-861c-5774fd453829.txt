Question:

The teeth of different species of vertebrates are special-ized in a variety of ways and may be quite unlike those of man in number , structure, arrangement, and function. Give examples .

Options:

A: Snakes have thin, sharp teeth for capturing prey; carnivorous mammals like cats and dogs have pointed teeth for cutting and shearing; herbivorous animals like cows and horses have large, flat teeth for breaking up plant cell walls.
B: Fish have teeth adapted for chewing and grinding similar to humans
C: Only carnivorous animals have specialized teeth
D: Snakes have large, flat teeth for grinding food
E: Birds have well-developed teeth for tearing meat
F: Insectivorous mammals have large, flat teeth for grinding plants
G: Rodents have fangs for injecting venom into prey
H: All vertebrates have the same number of teeth
I: Amphibians have teeth specialized for filter-feeding like some whales
J: All vertebrates have similarly structured teeth

Okay, so I've got this question about vertebrates' teeth and their specializations. The question is asking for examples of how different species' teeth are specialized, and it's a multiple-choice question with options from A to J.

First, I need to understand what the question is really about. It mentions that teeth can vary in number, structure, arrangement, and function. So I need to think about different animals and how their teeth are adapted to their diets or hunting styles.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Snakes have thin, sharp teeth for capturing prey; carnivorous mammals like cats and dogs have pointed teeth for cutting and shearing; herbivorous animals like cows and horses have large, flat teeth for breaking up plant cell walls.

This sounds plausible. Snakes do have sharp, pointed teeth which help them catch and hold onto prey. Carnivores like cats have canines for piercing and shearing flesh. Herbivores like cows have molars that are flat and used for grinding tough plant material. So A seems correct.

Option B: Fish have teeth adapted for chewing and grinding similar to humans.

Wait, do fish have teeth like humans? I thought most fish don't chew their food much. They usually swallow their food whole or have teeth that are more for catching and holding prey. Humans have molars for grinding, but fish might not. So B might be incorrect.

Option C: Only carnivorous animals have specialized teeth.

No, that's not right. Herbivores have specialized teeth too, like the flat molars for grinding plants. So C is wrong.

Option D: Snakes have large, flat teeth for grinding food.

Snakes usually don't grind food. They either swallow prey whole or have sharp teeth to hold onto it. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Birds have well-developed teeth for tearing meat.

Wait, most birds don't have teeth at all. Some, like ducks, have beaks with ridges, but not teeth. So E is wrong.

Option F: Insectivorous mammals have large, flat teeth for grinding plants.

Insectivores usually eat insects, so their teeth are probably more pointed. Grinding plants would be herbivores. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Rodents have fangs for injecting venom into prey.

Rodents like mice and rats have incisors, not fangs. Fangs are more common in venomous snakes or some spiders. So G is wrong.

Option H: All vertebrates have the same number of teeth.

No, that's not true. Humans have 32, while some animals have more or fewer. For example, sharks have many rows of teeth. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Amphibians have teeth specialized for filter-feeding like some whales.

Amphibians like frogs have small teeth for catching prey, but filter-feeding is more like whales with baleen. So I is wrong.

Option J: All vertebrates have similarly structured teeth.

No, structure varies widely. For example, herbivores have flat molars, carnivores have canines and shears. So J is wrong.

So the only correct option seems to be A. It accurately describes the specializations of snakes, carnivorous mammals, and herbivorous animals.

The correct answer is the option that accurately describes the specialized teeth of different vertebrates. Snakes have thin, sharp teeth for capturing prey, carnivorous mammals like cats and dogs have pointed teeth for cutting and shearing, and herbivorous animals like cows and horses have large, flat teeth for breaking up plant cell walls. This makes option A correct, while all other options are incorrect based on the analysis provided.

Answer: A
