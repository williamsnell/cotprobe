Question:

Two brothers owned a parcel of real estate as joint tenants. Both brothers signed a deed as grantors conveying the land to the buyer. The first brother handed the deed to the second brother with instructions to take the deed to their lawyer for approval prior to delivery. Brother two, without his brother's permission, took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price. Is this a good deed as to partner one?

Options:

A: Yes, the deed was signed by both partners, which proved their intent to sell to buyer, and it was delivered at the time of signing by the fact of affixing their signatures to the document.
B: Yes, the deed is valid as the buyer was not aware of the internal agreement between the two brothers.
C: No, the deed is invalid as partner one did not give explicit permission for partner two to deliver the deed.
D: Yes, the deed is valid as partner two had the authority to finalize the deal.
E: No, the deed is invalid because partner two collected the sale price without partner one's consent.
F: Yes, the deed is valid as both brothers had signed it, signifying their agreement to the sale.
G: Yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because partner two was partner one's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.
H: No, the deed was invalid as to both grantors because partner two stepped outside his scope of authority.
I: No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.
J: No, the deed is not valid as the lawyer did not approve it before delivery.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about real estate law, specifically dealing with joint tenants and deed delivery. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario: Two brothers own a parcel of real estate as joint tenants. Both signed a deed as grantors, conveying the land to a buyer. Brother one gives the deed to brother two with instructions to take it to their lawyer for approval before delivery. But brother two decides to take it directly to the buyer without permission and collects the sale price. The question is whether this deed is valid as to partner one.

I remember that for a deed to be valid, there are a few essential elements: it must be in writing, signed by the grantor, and delivered. Delivery is a key part here. The concept of delivery is that the grantor must intend the deed to take effect. So, even if the grantor signs it, if they don't deliver it with the intent to transfer ownership, it's not valid.

In this case, both brothers signed the deed. But then, brother one gave it to brother two for a specific purpose: to get the lawyer's approval before delivery. So, the delivery by brother one to brother two wasn't the final delivery intended to transfer the property. Instead, it was conditional—pending the lawyer's approval.

But brother two went ahead and delivered it to the buyer without that approval. So, the question is whether that counts as a valid delivery as far as brother one is concerned.

I think about the idea of conditional delivery. When a grantor delivers a deed but puts a condition on it, like needing someone else's approval, the delivery isn't effective until that condition is met. So, if brother one handed it over to brother two with the condition that the lawyer has to approve it first, then brother two's delivery to the buyer wouldn't count as a valid delivery on behalf of brother one unless the condition was fulfilled.

Also, there's the concept of agency here. Was brother two acting as brother one's agent? If brother one gave him the deed for a specific purpose (to get lawyer approval), then brother two's authority was limited to that task. If he exceeded that authority by delivering it without approval, he might have acted outside his scope. So, in that case, his actions wouldn't bind brother one.

Looking at the answer options:

Option A says yes because both signed and delivery was upon signing. But I don't think so because delivery requires intent, and brother one's intent was conditional.

Option B says yes because the buyer wasn't aware of the internal agreement. But the buyer's knowledge isn't the issue here; it's about the grantor's intent.

Option C says no because partner one didn't give permission to deliver. That seems plausible because the delivery was conditional.

Option D says yes because partner two had authority. But if his authority was limited, then this might not hold.

Option E says no because he collected the sale price without consent. I'm not sure if that's the main issue; the main issue is delivery of the deed, not the sale price.

Option F says yes because both signed, showing agreement. But again, delivery is the key, not just signing.

Option G says yes because of apparent agency. Maybe, but if brother one told brother two to get lawyer approval, then brother two's apparent authority might be limited.

Option H says no as to both because partner two exceeded authority. But I'm focusing on partner one here.

Option I says no because partner one didn't participate in delivery and didn't intend it. That sounds right because his intent was conditional.

Option J says no because the lawyer didn't approve. It's more about the intent of the grantor, not necessarily the lawyer's approval, but the condition was about that.

So, putting it together, the deed wasn't validly delivered as to partner one because the delivery to the buyer wasn't done with his intent. The initial delivery to brother two was conditional, so brother two's actions didn't constitute a valid delivery on behalf of brother one.

The validity of the deed hinges on the concept of delivery in real estate law. For a deed to be effective, it must be delivered with the intent to transfer ownership. In this scenario, both brothers signed the deed, but brother one handed it to brother two with the explicit instruction that it was conditional—pending approval by their lawyer. This conditional delivery meant that brother one did not intend for the deed to take effect until the lawyer's approval was obtained. Brother two's subsequent delivery of the deed to the buyer, without fulfilling this condition, exceeded his authority. 

The key issue is not whether the buyer was aware of the internal agreement but whether brother one's intent to deliver the deed was fulfilled. Since brother one's intent was conditional and the condition was not met, the deed was not validly delivered as to him. Brother two's actions, therefore, did not bind brother one, as he acted outside the scope of his authority.
