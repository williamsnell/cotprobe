Options:

A: U • (P ⊃ ~B)
B: U ⊃ (P ∨ ~B)
C: (U ∨ P) • B
D: U ⊃ (~P • ~B)
E: (U ⊃ P) • B
F: U ⊃ (P • B)

H: B ⊃ (U • P)
I: (P • ~B) ⊃ U
J: U ⊃ (P • ~B)

Okay, I need to figure out which logical formula correctly represents the given sentence. The sentence is: "Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it." So, I'm looking for a formula that captures this meaning.

First, let's break down the sentence. The main parts are:

1. The university raised tuition. Let's call this U.
2. The president approved of it. Let's call this P.
3. The board didn't prevent it. So, the board not preventing it would be ~B, where B is the board preventing it.

The sentence structure seems to suggest that because U happened, both P and ~B occurred. So, U implies both P and ~B.

In logical terms, if U is true, then both P is true and B is false. So the structure would be U implies (P and ~B).

Looking at the options, I need to find a formula that represents U → (P ∧ ~B).

Wait, let me check each option:

Option A: U • (P ⊃ ~B) → This is U and (P implies ~B). Doesn't seem right because it's saying both U happened and if P then ~B, but that's not exactly capturing U causing both P and ~B.

Option B: U ⊃ (P ∨ ~B) → U implies P or ~B. But the sentence says both P happened and ~B happened, not just one or the other.

Option C: (U ∨ P) • B → This is (U or P) and B. Doesn't fit because B is the board preventing, which didn't happen, so we have ~B.

Option D: U ⊃ (~P • ~B) → U implies not P and not B. That's the opposite of what we want. We want P to happen, not not P.

Option E: (U ⊃ P) • B → U implies P, and B. But B is the board preventing, which didn't happen. So this is incorrect.

Option F: U ⊃ (P • B) → U implies P and B. Again, B is the board preventing, which the sentence says didn't happen, so this is wrong.

Option G: (~U ⊃ P) • B → If not U, then P, and B. Doesn't seem to fit the structure we need.

Option H: B ⊃ (U • P) → If B then U and P. Not directly related to the original statement.

Option I: (P • ~B) ⊃ U → If P and not B, then U. This is the converse of what we want. The original is U leading to P and ~B, not the other way around.

Option J: U ⊃ (P • ~B) → U implies P and ~B. Yes, this matches our earlier analysis. U implies both P and ~B.

The sentence "Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it" can be broken down into three components:

1. The university raised tuition: \( U \).
2. The president approved of it: \( P \).
3. The board didn't prevent it: \( \neg B \).

The sentence suggests that raising tuition (\( U \)) implies both the president's approval (\( P \)) and the board not preventing it (\( \neg B \)). Therefore, the logical structure is \( U \rightarrow (P \land \neg B) \).

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: \( U \cdot (P \rightarrow \neg B) \) — Incorrect. It states \( U \) and (if \( P \) then \( \neg B \)), which does not capture \( U \) implying both \( P \) and \( \neg B \).
- **B**: \( U \rightarrow (P \lor \neg B) \) — Incorrect. It states \( U \) implies \( P \) or \( \neg B \), but the sentence requires both \( P \) and \( \neg B \).
- **C**: \( (U \lor P) \cdot B \) — Incorrect. It introduces \( B \) (the board preventing), which contradicts the sentence.
- **D**: \( U \rightarrow (\neg P \cdot \neg B) \) — Incorrect. It states \( U \) implies neither \( P \) nor \( B \), which is the opposite of the sentence.
- **E**: \( (U \rightarrow P) \cdot B \) — Incorrect. It includes \( B \) (the board preventing), which did not happen.
- **F**: \( U \rightarrow (P \cdot B) \) — Incorrect. It states \( U \) implies \( P \) and \( B \), but \( B \) did not occur.
- **G**: \( (\neg U \rightarrow P) \cdot B \) — Incorrect. It does not align with the structure of the sentence.
- **H**: \( B \rightarrow (U \cdot P) \) — Incorrect. It suggests \( B \) implies \( U \) and \( P \), which is unrelated to the original statement.
- **I**: \( (P \cdot \neg B) \rightarrow U \) — Incorrect. It reverses the implication, stating \( P \) and \( \neg B \) imply \( U \), rather than \( U \) implying \( P \) and \( \neg B \).
- **J**: \( U \rightarrow (P \cdot \neg B) \) — Correct. It accurately represents \( U \) implying both \( P \) and \( \neg B \).

The correct answer is **J**.
