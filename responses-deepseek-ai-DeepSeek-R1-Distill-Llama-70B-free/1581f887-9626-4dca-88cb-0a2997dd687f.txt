Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Abraham Maslow and his theories. Hmm, I remember that Maslow is known for something related to human needs. Let me think... Oh right, he proposed a hierarchy of needs. But wait, what's the question exactly?

The question is asking which approach expresses the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others. So, Maslow must have arranged these motives in some order of importance. I think he created a pyramid where the most basic needs are at the bottom and more complex ones at the top.

Looking at the options, option B is "Hierarchy of needs." That sounds familiar. I've heard of Maslow's hierarchy before. Let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A: Homeostatic regulation. That's more about the body maintaining balance, like temperature or hunger. Not directly related to Maslow's theory.

Option C: Self-determination theory. That's by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, focusing on autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Not Maslow.

Option D: Intrinsic motivation. That's about being motivated by internal factors, like personal satisfaction. Again, not specifically Maslow.

Option E: Maslow's pyramid of desire. Wait, Maslow's model is often depicted as a pyramid, so maybe this is another term for it. But I'm more certain about the hierarchy of needs being the correct term.

Option F: Drive reduction theory. That's about reducing physiological needs, like thirst or hunger, to maintain homeostasis. Not Maslow's approach.

Option G: Cognitive dissonance. That's from Festinger, about conflicting thoughts causing discomfort. Unrelated here.

Option H: Goal-setting. That's more about how specific goals affect performance, like in management or psychology. Not Maslow.

Option I: Expectancy-value. That's a theory about motivation based on expectations and the value of outcomes. Not Maslow.

Option J: Arousal theory. That's about optimal levels of arousal for performance. Again, not Maslow.

So, the correct answer should be B: Hierarchy of needs. But wait, option E is "Maslow's pyramid of desire." I'm a bit confused because Maslow's hierarchy is sometimes called a pyramid. Maybe both B and E are similar. Let me think again. The hierarchy of needs is the more standard term, so I'll go with B.

The correct answer is B: Hierarchy of needs. Abraham Maslow's theory organizes human needs into a hierarchical structure, with the most fundamental needs for survival at the base and more complex needs at the top. This hierarchy directly reflects the idea that some motives are more imperative for survival than others. While option E mentions a pyramid, which is a common visual representation of Maslow's theory, "Hierarchy of needs" is the more accurate and widely recognized term.

Answer: B
