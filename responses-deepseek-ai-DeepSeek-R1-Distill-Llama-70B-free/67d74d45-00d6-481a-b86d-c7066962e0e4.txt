Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this logic question. The question is about identifying a fallacy when someone changes the meaning of a word or phrase in an argument. Hmm, I remember that fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. Let me think about each option given.

The options are A through J. I'll go through them one by one. 

Option A is Hypostatization. I think that's when someone treats an abstract idea as if it's a concrete thing. Like, talking about "happiness" as if it's a physical object. Doesn't seem to fit the changing meaning scenario.

Option B: Appeal to authority. That's when someone uses an expert's opinion to support their argument, even if the expert isn't relevant or reliable. Not related to changing word meanings.

Option C: Red herring fallacy. That's when someone introduces an unrelated topic to distract from the issue at hand. So, like bringing up something off-topic to throw the argument off. Doesn't involve changing meanings of words.

Option D: False cause fallacy. This is when someone incorrectly identifies the cause of an event. Like, thinking that because B follows A, A must cause B. Not related to word meanings.

Option E: Straw man fallacy. That's when someone misrepresents someone else's argument to make it easier to attack. Like, exaggerating or distorting the opponent's position. Not exactly about changing the meaning of words in the same argument.

Option F: Special pleading. This is when someone applies a double standard, like expecting an exception for themselves without justification. Doesn't fit the question.

Option G: Equivocation. Oh, right! Equivocation is when a word or phrase is used with more than one meaning in an argument, leading to a misleading conclusion. So, if someone uses a term in one way in one part and changes its meaning in another part, that's equivocation. That sounds exactly like what the question describes.

Option H: Slippery slope fallacy. This is when someone argues that a small action will inevitably lead to significant negative effects without evidence. Like, "If we allow this, then that will happen, and then worse things." Not about changing word meanings.

Option I: Ad hominem attack. This involves attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. Unrelated to the meaning of words.

Option J: Question begging epithets. This is when emotionally charged language is used to influence opinion rather than logic. Like using a loaded term to sway the audience. Not the same as changing a word's meaning in different parts of the argument.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: Equivocation.

The correct answer is G: Equivocation. This fallacy occurs when a word or phrase is used with different meanings in different parts of an argument, leading to misleading conclusions.

Answer: G
