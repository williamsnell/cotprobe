Okay, so I've got this question about pilocarpine and its effects on different body systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my pharmacology, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that pilocarpine is a cholinergic drug. Cholinergic means it's related to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, right? And acetylcholine is a major neurotransmitter in the parasympathetic nervous system. So, if pilocarpine stimulates parasympathetic nerves, it's probably acting as an agonist, mimicking acetylcholine.

Now, let's break down each part of the question.

(a) The digestive tract: The parasympathetic system generally promotes digestion. I think it increases things like saliva production, gastric secretions, and intestinal motility. So if pilocarpine is stimulating the parasympathetic nerves, digestion should be enhanced. So options that say digestion increases are likely correct.

(b) The iris of the eye: Parasympathetic stimulation causes the constriction of the pupils. I remember that the oculomotor nerve (which is parasympathetic) controls the sphincter pupillae muscle, causing the pupil to constrict, also known as miosis. So the pupil would get smaller, not dilate.

(c) The heart rate: The parasympathetic nervous system, via the vagus nerve, slows down the heart rate. Acetylcholine released here decreases heart rate and the force of contractions. So if pilocarpine is acting on this, heart rate would decrease. So options where heart rate slows are more likely.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: (a) enhanced digestion, (b) pupil doesn't change, (c) heart rate decreases. Wait, but I thought the pupil would constrict, so (b) is wrong here. So A might not be correct.

Option B: (a) no effect on digestion? That can't be right. Parasympathetic should enhance digestion. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: (a) digestion irregular? Not sure, but I thought parasympathetic makes it more active, not irregular. Also, (b) slight constriction? Maybe, (c) heart rate increases? No, should decrease. So C is not right.

Option D: (a) digestion inhibited? No, opposite. So D's wrong.

Option E: (a) digestion enhanced, (b) pupil reduces size, (c) heart slows and weakens. That fits everything I thought. So E is a candidate.

Option F: (a) digestion inhibited, which is wrong. So F is out.

Option G: (a) no effect on digestion? No, so G is wrong.

Option H: (a) digestion slows, which is opposite of correct. So H is wrong.

Option I: (a) dramatically speed up digestion. While parasympathetic does enhance, not sure if dramatically, but possible. (b) pupil dilate, which is wrong. So I is out.

Option J: (a) no effect, wrong. So J is out.

So the correct options are E and maybe A. Wait, in option E, (b) says the pupil reduces in size, which is correct, and (c) heart slows, correct. A has (b) no change, which is wrong.

So the correct answer should be E.

Pilocarpine is a cholinergic drug that stimulates parasympathetic nerves, mimicking the effects of acetylcholine. Here's how it affects the body:

1. **Digestive Tract**: The parasympathetic nervous system promotes digestion by increasing activities like saliva production, gastric secretions, and intestinal motility. Therefore, pilocarpine would enhance digestion.

2. **Iris of the Eye**: Parasympathetic stimulation causes constriction of the pupils (miosis) by activating the sphincter pupillae muscle. Thus, the pupil size would decrease.

3. **Heart Rate**: The parasympathetic nervous system, via the vagus nerve, slows down the heart rate and reduces the force of contractions. Pilocarpine would decrease the heart rate.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because it states the pupil size would not change, which contradicts the expected miosis.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because it states no significant effect on digestion, which is false as digestion is enhanced.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because it suggests digestion becomes irregular and heart rate increases, both of which are incorrect.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it states digestion is inhibited, which is the opposite of the expected effect.
- **Option E**: Correct as it states digestion is facilitated, pupil size reduces, and heart rate slows.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because it states digestion is inhibited, which is false.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because it states digestion is unaffected, which is false.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because it states digestion slows down, which is the opposite of the expected effect.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because it states the pupil dilates, which is false.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because it states digestion remains unaffected, which is false.

The correct answer is **E**.

Answer: E
