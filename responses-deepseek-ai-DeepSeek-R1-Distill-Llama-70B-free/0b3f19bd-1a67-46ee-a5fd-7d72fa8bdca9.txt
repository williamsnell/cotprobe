Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question here. The question is about what process regenerates NAD+ when oxygen isn't available, allowing respiration to continue. Hmm, I remember that NAD+ is a coenzyme that plays a big role in cellular respiration. 

So, cellular respiration has a few stages. I think it's glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and then oxidative phosphorylation. Oh wait, but glycolysis happens in the cytoplasm whether oxygen is present or not. Right, because glycolysis is the first step whether it's aerobic or anaerobic respiration.

In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, and during this process, NAD+ is reduced to NADH. But for glycolysis to keep going, it needs to regenerate NAD+ from NADH. How does that happen? Oh right, when oxygen is available, the electron transport chain in oxidative phosphorylation helps regenerate NAD+. But when oxygen isn't there, like in anaerobic conditions, something else must take over.

Wait, I remember something about fermentation. Yeah, fermentation is the process that occurs in the absence of oxygen. So after glycolysis, if there's no oxygen, pyruvate goes through fermentation. Fermentation regenerates NAD+ by converting the NADH back into NAD+ so that glycolysis can continue producing a little more ATP.

So the question is asking which process regenerates NAD+ when oxygen is unavailable. That points to fermentation. Let me look at the options. Option B is fermentation. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Glycolysis itself doesn't regenerate NAD+; it actually uses NAD+ to produce NADH. So the regeneration happens in the next step. In the presence of oxygen, the mitochondria take care of it, but without oxygen, fermentation does it. So yes, fermentation is the process.

When oxygen is unavailable, the process that regenerates NAD+ to allow respiration to continue is fermentation. During glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to NADH, but for glycolysis to continue, NAD+ must be regenerated. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation takes over, converting NADH back into NAD+ so that glycolysis can proceed and produce ATP anaerobically. 

The correct answer is **B: Fermentation**.
