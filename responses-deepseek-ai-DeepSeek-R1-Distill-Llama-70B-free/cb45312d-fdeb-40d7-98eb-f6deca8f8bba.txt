Okay, so I have this question about marital satisfaction in long-lasting marriages. Hmm, I remember that marital satisfaction isn't constant throughout a marriage. I think it goes through different phases. Let me try to recall what I learned in psychology.

So, when couples first get married, they're usually really happy, right? That's the honeymoon phase where everything is exciting and new. But then, as time goes on and they have kids, things change. Raising children can add a lot of stress and responsibilities. I think studies show that marital satisfaction tends to dip during this period. That makes sense because managing a household, taking care of kids, and financial pressures can strain the relationship.

But wait, after the children leave home, like when they go off to college or start their own lives, the couple gets to focus on each other again. I remember something about an empty nest phase where satisfaction might go up again. So it's like a curve: high at the start, dips when kids are around, then increases again after the kids leave.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A says lower levels when children are present. That fits with what I was thinking. Option B is constant low satisfaction, which doesn't sound right because the beginning is usually good. Option C is high all through, which I don't think is accurate. 

Option D suggests a steady increase regardless of children, so that doesn't fit the dip. Option E says ups and downs, which is kind of vague but might be true, but I think the pattern is more specific. Option F says low early on and increases, which is the opposite of what I remember. 

Option G is high only when children are there, which doesn't make sense because I thought satisfaction is lower then. Option H says high that steadily declines, which might happen in some cases, but not the typical pattern. Option I says high only after children leave, which is part of the picture but misses the initial high. 

Option J says high early and increases, which again doesn't account for the dip when kids are present. So the best fit seems to be A: lower during the years with children. Alternatively, E could be a contender because it mentions ups and downs, but I think the more specific correct answer is A. Wait, but the question is about most long-lasting marriages. So maybe the pattern is that they have lower satisfaction when the kids are there, which would match A. But another point of view is that after the kids leave, satisfaction increases again, so the overall trend isn't a steady increase but a dip in the middle.

Wait, in that case, the correct answer would be A. Because the question is about when children are present, which causes lower satisfaction. So the answer would be A.

The correct answer is A: Show lower levels during the years when children are present.
