Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about speckle patterns and ground glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that a piece of ground glass with diameter D is illuminated by a laser. This forms a speckle pattern on a screen at a distance L. The first part asks to show that the smallest detail is of the order of size λL/D. Wait, I remember something about diffraction and resolution here. Oh right, when light passes through a rough surface like ground glass, it creates a diffraction pattern. The smallest detail should relate to the diffraction limit, which involves the wavelength, the distance, and the diameter of the aperture.

So the formula they mention, λL/D, that makes sense. It's similar to the resolution of a lens or a pinhole. The idea is that the minimum resolvable detail (like the speckle size) is determined by the diffraction pattern's central maximum. The size of the smallest detail is on the order of λ times the distance divided by the aperture size.

Now the second part of the question is about making the smallest detail unobservable to the eye. The screen is viewed from a distance of 250 mm, and L is 2 meters. We need to find the required ground glass size D. Oh, right, and the wavelength λ is 632.8 nm.

Wait, the key here is that the eye's resolution limit needs to be considered. The eye can resolve details down to a certain angular size. I remember that the human eye's minimum angle of resolution is about one arcminute, which is 1/60 of a degree. But wait, sometimes it's approximated as 1 arcminute, but let me get the exact value right.

So, the smallest detail on the screen must be such that its angular size is equal to or smaller than the eye's angular resolution. So, the angular size θ is approximately equal to the size of the detail (let's call it x) divided by the viewing distance (here, 250 mm or 0.25 meters). But wait, the detail size x is given by the diffraction formula x ≈ λL/D. So combining these, we get the angular size θ ≈ (λL/D) / (viewing distance).

But wait, the eye's resolution is usually given as θ_min ≈ 1 arcminute. Wait, 1 arcminute is 1/60 degree, which is π/(60*180) radians. Let me calculate that: π radians is 180 degrees, so 1 degree is π/180 radians. Therefore, 1 arcminute is π/(60*180) = π/(10800) ≈ 2.9089e-4 radians.

So the condition is that θ, which is (λL/D)/(viewing distance), has to be at least θ_min. Wait, no, because if θ is smaller than θ_min, the eye can't resolve it. So to make the detail unobservable, the angular size must be equal to or smaller than θ_min. So:

θ = (x) / (viewing distance) = (λL/D) / (viewing distance) ≤ θ_min.

Wait, rearranging that, we have D ≥ (λ L) / (θ_min * viewing distance).

Wait, let me make sure. So, the formula for θ is the size of the detail (x) divided by the viewing distance. And x itself is λL/D. So θ = (λL/D) / (viewing distance).

Wait, no, wait. Let's get the units right. Let me think: x is in meters. L is in meters. D is in meters. So (λ L) has units of m^2. Divided by D (m) gives x in meters. So x is in meters. Then θ is x / (viewing distance in meters), so the units for θ are radians.

So the condition is that θ ≤ θ_min. So:

(λ L) / (D * viewing distance) ≤ θ_min

So rearranging for D:

D ≥ (λ L) / (θ_min * viewing distance )

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

Given:
λ = 632.8 nm = 632.8e-9 meters.
L = 2 meters.
Viewing distance = 250 mm = 0.25 meters.
θ_min ≈ 1 arcminute = π/(10800) ≈ 2.9089e-4 radians.

So,

D ≥ (632.8e-9 m * 2 m) / (2.9089e-4 rad * 0.25 m )

Let me compute the denominator first: 2.9089e-4 * 0.25 = 7.27225e-5.

The numerator: 632.8e-9 * 2 = 1.2656e-6.

So D ≥ (1.2656e-6) / (7.27225e-5 )

Let me compute that division:

1.2656e-6 / 7.27225e-5 = (1.2656 / 72.7225) ) * 1e-1.

Wait wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.2656e-6 divided by 7.27225e-5.

Which is same as 1.2656 / 72.7225 times 1e-1.

Wait, 1.2656 / 72.7225: let's compute that.

Compute 72.7225 * 0.017 ≈ 1.237. So 0.0173?

Wait, 72.7225 * 0.0173 ≈ 1.26.

Wait, 72.7225 * 0.0173 = let's see:

72 * 0.0173 = approx 1.2456.

0.7225 * 0.0173 ≈ 0.0125.

So total ≈ 1.2456 + 0.0125=1.2581. Close to 1.2656.

So 0.0173 gives 1.2581, which is a bit less than 1.2656. So perhaps 0.01735.

So approximately 0.01735.

So the value is 0.01735 * 1e-1 = 0.001735 meters. Which is 1.735 mm.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting D ≥ approx 1.735 mm. But the options start at 7.3 mm. That can't be right. I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 1.2656e-6 divided by 7.27225e-5.

Compute numerator: 632.8e-9 *2 = 1.2656e-6 m^2.

Denominator: 2.9089e-4 rad *0.25 m =7.27225e-5 m rad.

So D = (1.2656e-6) / (7.27225e-5) = let me compute this as (1.2656 / 72.7225) ) * 1e-1.

Wait, 1.2656 /72.7225.

Wait, 72.7225 * 0.0173 =?

Let me compute 72.7225 * 0.0173.

72.7225 * 0.01 = 0.727225.

72.7225 * 0.007 = 0.5090575.

72.7225 * 0.0003 = 0.02181675.

Adding these: 0.727225 + 0.5090575 = 1.2362825 + 0.02181675 = 1.2581.

So 0.0173 gives 1.2581, which is close to 1.2656. So 0.0173 * (1.2656/1.2581) ≈ 0.0173 * 1.003 ≈ 0.01735.

So 1.2656e-6 /7.27225e-5 = approximately 0.01735 meters? No wait, no. Wait, 1e-6 divided by 1e-5 is 0.1, so 1.2656e-6 /7.27225e-5 = (1.2656 / 72.7225) * (1e-6 / 1e-5) ) = (approx 0.01735) * 0.1 = 0.001735.

So D ≥ 0.001735 meters, which is 1.735 mm.

But the options are way larger than that. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I reversed the formula. Let me think again.

The condition is that the angular size θ of the detail is equal to the eye's resolution. So θ = x / (viewing distance), where x is the size of the detail.

And x is given by the diffraction formula as x ≈ λ L / D.

So θ = (λ L / D) / (viewing distance) = (λ L) / (D * viewing distance).

This θ must be equal to θ_min, the eye's angular resolution.

So rearranging, D = (λ L) / (θ_min * viewing distance).

Wait, that's correct. So let me recalculate.

λ=632.8e-9 m.

L=2 m.

θ_min=1 arcminute= π/(180*60)= π/10800 ≈ 2.9089e-4 rad.

Viewing distance = 0.25 m.

So D = (632.8e-9 * 2) / (2.9089e-4 * 0.25).

Compute denominator first: 2.9089e-4 *0.25 = 7.27225e-5.

Numerator: 632.8e-9 * 2 = 1.2656e-6.

So D = 1.2656e-6 /7.27225e-5 = 0.0174 m? Wait no, 1.2656e-6 divided by 7.27225e-5 is:

1.2656e-6 /7.27225e-5 = (1.2656 /72.7225) ) * (1e-6 /1e-5) )

Wait, 1e-6 /1e-5 = 0.1.

So 1.2656 /72.7225 = approx 0.0174, multiplied by 0.1 is 0.00174 m, which is 1.74 mm.

But that's not matching any of the options. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the eye's resolution is worse than 1 arcminute. Maybe it's 1 arcminute is the typical resolution, but perhaps in this problem, they use a different value.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the eye's resolution is approximated as 1 arcminute, which is 1/60 degree. So 1 degree is 0.01745 radians. So 1 arcminute is 0.01745 / 60 ≈ 0.000291 rad ≈ 2.91e-4 rad. Which matches what I had before.

Hmm. So according to the calculation, D should be about 1.74 mm. But the options start at 7.3 mm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the speckle size is different. Another approach: The speckle size is given by the wavelength times the ratio of the screen distance to the aperture diameter. So x ≈ λ L / D.

But perhaps I should use the far-field condition or something else. Alternatively, maybe the formula is x = 1.22 λ L / D, considering the Airy disk. Oh wait, that's for a circular aperture. So perhaps the factor is 1.22.

Wait, let's try that. So x ≈ 1.22 λ L / D.

Then, the angular size θ = x / (viewing distance) = 1.22 λ L / (D * viewing distance).

Setting this equal to θ_min:

1.22 λ L / (D * viewing distance) ) = θ_min.

So D = 1.22 λ L / (θ_min * viewing distance).

Let me plug in the numbers again.

λ=632.8e-9 m.

L=2 m.

θ_min=2.9089e-4 rad.

Viewing distance=0.25 m.

Compute denominator: 2.9089e-4 * 0.25 = 7.27225e-5.

Numerator: 1.22 * 632.8e-9 * 2 = 1.22 * 1.2656e-6 = approx 1.544e-6.

So D = 1.544e-6 /7.27225e-5 ≈ 0.02123 m → 21.23 mm.

Wait, that's not matching the options either. But wait, the options have D options around 10-16 mm.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption about the formula is incorrect. Maybe I should consider the Rayleigh criterion, which uses the 1.22 factor, but perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the formula is x = λ L / (D), without the 1.22 factor, as given in the problem statement. The problem says to show that the smallest detail is of order (λ L/D). So perhaps we should ignore the 1.22 factor here.

So going back, with D ≈ 1.74 mm. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the viewing distance.

Wait, the viewing distance is 250 mm, which is 0.25 meters. Correct.

Hmm, maybe the eye's angular resolution is taken as θ_min = 1 arcminute, but perhaps for the eye, the minimum angle is larger, maybe 5 arcminutes. Let me think: no, I think 1 arcminute is the standard assumption.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should consider that the eye's resolution is based on the pixel size or something else, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, maybe the calculation is correct, but perhaps the problem expects the ground glass to have a diameter D such that the detail is just at the limit of observability, so D would be (λ L)/(θ_min * viewing distance). So the calculation gives D ≈ 1.74 mm. But that's not among the options.

Wait, looking at the options, the smallest is 7.3 mm. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 4 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula setup. Let me try to rederive the condition.

The condition is that the eye can't resolve the speckle. So the angular size of the speckle must be less than or equal to the eye's angular resolution.

Angular size θ = x / viewing_distance.

x is the speckle size, which is (λ L)/D.

So θ = (λ L) / (D * viewing_distance).

We set θ = θ_min.

So D = (λ L) / (θ_min * viewing_distance).

Wait, I think that's correct.

But plugging the numbers, I get D ≈ 1.74 mm, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps the angular resolution is 1 arcminute = 1e-3 rad. Wait no, 1 degree is 0.01745 rad, so 1 arcminute is 0.01745/60 ≈ 2.9e-4 rad. Which is what I used.

Wait wait, perhaps the formula is (1.22 λ L)/(D), which would make x larger, but that would require a larger D to make the same θ. Let me try that.

Wait, if x = 1.22 λ L/D, then θ = x / (viewing_distance) = (1.22 λ L) / (D * viewing_distance).

Set θ = θ_min → D = (1.22 λ L) / (θ_min * viewing_distance).

So:

λ=632.8e-9 m.

L=2 m.

θ_min=2.9e-4 rad.

Viewing_distance=0.25 m.

So numerator: 1.22 * 632.8e-9 * 2 = 1.22 * 1.2656e-6 = approx 1.544e-6.

Denominator: 2.9e-4 * 0.25 = 7.25e-5.

So D = 1.544e-6 / 7.25e-5 ≈ 0.02127 m → 21.27 mm. Still not matching any option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 14.3 mm. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eye's resolution is taken as 5 arcminutes, not 1. Let me try that.

θ_min = 5 * 2.9e-4 = 1.45e-3 rad.

Then, D = (632.8e-9 * 2) / (1.45e-3 * 0.25) = (1.2656e-6) / (3.625e-4) = approx 0.00349 m → 3.49 mm. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of π somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses λ/(D), without the L? No, that wouldn't make sense because L is the distance to the screen. If L is larger, the speckle size should be larger.

Wait, maybe the formula is (λ L)/(D), but maybe I should consider it as (λ L)/(2D), or another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula x ≈ λ L/(π D), but that's not something I've heard before.

Alternatively, perhaps the viewing distance is 250 mm = 0.25 m, but perhaps in the problem, the ground glass is at a different position. Wait, the setup is: the ground glass is illuminated, and the speckle is on a screen at distance L. The viewer is at a distance of 250 mm from the screen. So the angular size as seen by the viewer is x / (250 mm).

Wait, so the setup is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eye's minimum angular resolution is about 1 arcminute, but perhaps in the calculation, using radians, I should have θ_min = 1 arcminute = 1/(60*π/180) ) → 1/(π/3) ) radians, which is 3/π ≈ 0.955 rad? No, that's not right.

Wait, no. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So 1 arcminute is (π/180)/60 = π/(10800) radians ≈ 2.9089
