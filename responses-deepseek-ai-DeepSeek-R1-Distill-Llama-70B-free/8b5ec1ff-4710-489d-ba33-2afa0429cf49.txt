Okay, so I have this problem here about Maxwell's Gift Shoppe and their inventory. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on accounting, but I'll try to remember.

The question says that the inventory is computed at selling price, which is a 37 and a half percent markup over cost. Oh right, markup percentage is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So the markup is 37.5%, which is like 37.5% of the cost added on top.

Wait, let me make sure I understand. So if the cost price is, say, $100, then the markup would be 37.5% of 100, which is $37.50. So the selling price would be $137.50. That makes sense.

Now, the inventory value as of December 31 is $5,954, and that's at selling price. So I need to find the cost. So I guess I need to reverse-engineer this. The selling price is cost plus 37.5% markup on cost. So, SP = Cost + (37.5% of Cost). Alternatively, SP = Cost * (1 + 0.375).

Wait, 37.5% is 3/8 in fraction terms, right? So 0.375 is 3/8. So the selling price is Cost multiplied by 1.375. Because 1 plus 3/8 is 11/8, which is 1.375.

So, SP = Cost * 1.375. So if I have SP, then Cost = SP / 1.375. That makes sense. So I just need to divide the selling price by 1.375 to get the cost.

Let me plug in the numbers. The SP is $5,954. So Cost = 5954 / 1.375. Let me compute that.

Wait, doing the division step by step. 5954 divided by 1.375. Alternatively, 1.375 is the same as 11/8, so dividing by 11/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/11. So 5954 * (8/11). Let me compute that.

First, multiply 5954 by 8. 5954 * 8. Let's see, 5000*8=40,000, 900*8=7,200, 50*8=400, 4*8=32. So adding those together: 40,000 + 7,200 is 47,200, plus 400 is 47,600, plus 32 is 47,632. So 5954 *8 = 47,632.

Now divide that by 11. 47,632 รท 11. Let me do that division. 11 into 47 is 4 times (44), remainder 3. Bring down 6, making 36. 11 into 36 is 3 times (33), remainder 3. Bring down 3, making 33. 11 into 33 is 3 exactly. Then bring down 2. Wait, wait, wait, no, wait. Let me do this more carefully.

Wait, 47,632 divided by 11:

11 into 47 is 4 (because 4*11=44), subtract 44 from 47, remainder 3.
Bring down the 6: 36. 11 into 36 is 3 (3*11=33), subtract 33, remainder 3.
Bring down the 3: 33. 11 into 33 is 3, subtract 33, remainder 0.
Bring down the 2: 02. 11 into 2 is 0, so write 0, remainder 2.

Wait, that gives me 4,302 with a remainder of 2. So 47,632 รท 11 is 4,302 with a remainder of 2. Wait, but 11 *4,302 is 47,322. Then the remainder is 47,632 -47,322 = 310? Hmm, maybe I messed up the division somewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do 5954 divided by 1.375. Let me try that. 1.375 times 4,000 is 5,500 because 1.375 * 1000 is 1,375, so 4,000 would be 5,500. But our SP is 5,954, which is 454 more than 5,500. So 454 / 1.375 = how much? Let me compute that.

454 divided by 1.375. Since 1.375 is 11/8, 454 *8/11. 454 *8 is 3,632. Then divided by 11. 11 into 3632. Let's see, 11*330=3,630. So 330 with a remainder of 2. So 330 and 2/11. So 330.1818 approximately.

So total cost is 4,000 + 330.1818 = 4,330.1818. Which is approximately 4,330.18. Looking at the options, option D is $4,330.18. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. If cost is 4,330.18, then markup is 37.5% on that. So 37.5% of 4,330.18 is 1,623.56 (since 0.375 *4,330.18 = let's see, 4,330 * 0.375 is (4,000 *0.375)+(330 *0.375) => 1,500 +123.75=1,623.75, and 0.18*0.375 is 0.0675, so total 1,623.8175). So selling price is 4,330.18 + 1,623.8175 = 5,954, which matches the given value. So yes, option D is correct.

To determine the value of the inventory at cost, we start by understanding that the selling price (SP) is computed with a 37.5% markup over the cost price (C). This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
\text{SP} = \text{C} \times (1 + 0.375) = \text{C} \times 1.375
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for the cost price:

\[
\text{C} = \frac{\text{SP}}{1.375}
\]

Given that the selling price (SP) is $5,954, we substitute this value into the formula:

\[
\text{C} = \frac{5,954}{1.375}
\]

To simplify the calculation, note that dividing by 1.375 is equivalent to multiplying by \( \frac{8}{11} \). Thus:

\[
\text{C} = 5,954 \times \frac{8}{11}
\]

First, calculate \( 5,954 \times 8 \):

\[
5,954 \times 8 = 47,632
\]

Next, divide the result by 11:

\[
\frac{47,632}{11} = 4,330.18
\]

Therefore, the value of the inventory at cost is approximately **$4,330.18**. This matches option D.

**Final Answer:** D
