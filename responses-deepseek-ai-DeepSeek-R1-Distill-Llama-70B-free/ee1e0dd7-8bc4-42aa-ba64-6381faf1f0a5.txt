Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about planning models from different authors. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what two elements the planning models of Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963), and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) have in common. The options are A through J, each pairing different elements.

I remember that planning models often include steps like situation analysis, setting objectives, strategy development, implementation, and evaluation. Different authors might structure these steps slightly differently, but there are common elements.

Let me break it down by each author. I'm not super familiar with all of them, but I'll try to recall what I know.

Hendrix (2002): I think his model is related to public relations planning. From what I remember, Hendrix's model includes research, programming (which involves strategy), implementation, and evaluation. So the steps might be research, strategy, implementation, evaluation.

Kendall (1999): I'm a bit hazy on this. Kendall's model might have steps like situation analysis, setting objectives, strategy, tactics, implementation, and evaluation. So objectives and strategy would be part of it.

Merston (1963): This name is less familiar to me. I'm not sure about the specifics, but perhaps his model includes research, objectives, strategy, and evaluation. Or maybe it's more basic steps like situation analysis, objectives, strategy, implementation.

Parkinson and Ekachai (2006): I don't recall much about this one. Maybe their model includes strategy development, implementation, and evaluation, along with some form of research or analysis.

Wait, but the question is about elements common to all four models. So I need to find two elements that all of them include.

Looking at the options, let's consider each pair:

Option A: Evaluation and implementation. I think all four models include these. Evaluation is a common step to assess outcomes, and implementation is about putting the plan into action.

Option B: Research and strategy. I'm pretty sure all of them include some form of research (like situation analysis or audience research) and strategy development.

Option C: Implementation and research. Again, seems likely, but maybe some models don't have both?

Option D: Research and evaluation. Also possible, but maybe not all.

Option E: Strategy and evaluation. All models have these, I think.

Option F: Objectives and implementation. Yes, objectives are a common element, as are implementation.

Option G: Strategy and implementation. Definitely, since strategy is central to planning.

Option H: Strategy and objectives. Both are common.

Option I: Strategy and research. Also common.

Option J: Evaluation and objectives. Both are common elements.

Wait, but the question is which two elements are common across all four models. Let me think about each model's components:

Hendrix: Research, Strategy, Implementation, Evaluation.

Kendall: Situation analysis (research), Objectives, Strategy, Tactics (implementation), Evaluation.

Merston: Maybe research, objectives, strategy, implementation, evaluation.

Parkinson & Ekachai: Not sure, but likely includes strategy, implementation, evaluation, and perhaps research.

So the common elements would be Strategy and Implementation, because each model has these steps.

Wait, but let's double-check. Do all four include both Strategy and Implementation?

Hendrix: Yes. Strategy (programming) and implementation.

Kendall: Yes, strategy and implementation (tactics).

Merston: I'm assuming yes.

Parkinson: Yes.

So the elements would be Strategy and Implementation.

Looking back at the options, option G is Strategy and implementation.

The question asks which two elements are common to the planning models of Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963), and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006). To determine this, it is important to analyze the components of each model:

1. **Hendrix (2002)**: Includes research, strategy, implementation, and evaluation.
2. **Kendall (1999)**: Involves situation analysis (research), objectives, strategy, tactics (implementation), and evaluation.
3. **Merston (1963)**: Likely includes research, objectives, strategy, implementation, and evaluation.
4. **Parkinson and Ekachai (2006)**: Includes strategy, implementation, evaluation, and likely research.

From this analysis, it is evident that all four models include **strategy** and **implementation** as common elements. These are core components of the planning process across the models.

The correct answer is **G: Strategy and implementation**.
