Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 35 divided by what equals 7. Hmm, I need to find the missing number. Let me think about how division works. Division is like splitting things into equal parts. So if I have 35 divided by something equals 7, that something must be how many parts I split it into.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as multiplication instead. Because division and multiplication are inverses. So if 35 divided by x is 7, then x must be 35 divided by 7. Because in division, the formula is dividend divided by divisor equals quotient.

So let's compute that. 35 divided by 7 is... 5. Oh right, because 7 times 5 is 35. So the missing number is 5. Let me check the options given. Option A is 5. So the answer should be A.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If I substitute 5 into the equation: 35 divided by 5 equals 7. Yes, because 35 รท 5 is indeed 7. So yes, the correct answer is A.

The equation is 35 divided by what equals 7. To find the missing number, we can rearrange the equation as 35 รท x = 7, which implies x = 35 รท 7. Calculating this gives x = 5. Substituting back, 35 รท 5 equals 7, confirming the solution is correct.

Answer: A
