Question:

A woman was employed as a state trooper. Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent. After she was rejected for the position, the woman sued the state in federal court to enjoin enforcement of its stated policy on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate?

Options:

A: Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials.
B: Judgment for the woman, because gender-based discrimination in state employment violates the Equal Protection Clause.
C: Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment.
D: Judgment for the state, because the dangerous nature of the work in the narcotics division provides a valid basis for the policy.
E: Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.
F: Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.
G: Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.
H: Judgment for the state, because the nature of the position justifies a gender-based classification.
I: Judgment for the state, because the state has a compelling interest in protecting the safety of its employees.
J: Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy constitutes unjustified sex discrimination.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this constitutional law question about gender discrimination in state employment. Let me read through the question carefully.

So the situation is a woman who's a state trooper. The state pays both men and women equally and provides the same benefits, but they have a policy that prohibits female officers from being assigned to the special undercover narcotics division. The reason given is concern for their safety because this job is moderate risk and sometimes involves violent encounters. Five agents have been killed since the division was established. The woman wants to join this division but was rejected, so she's suing the state, claiming the policy is unconstitutional.

The question is about what the outcome should be in this lawsuit. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

I remember that gender-based discrimination is analyzed under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court uses a heightened scrutiny, sometimes called intermediate scrutiny, for gender classifications. So the state's policy would need to be substantially related to an important government interest.

Looking at the options, I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: Judgment for the state because rational basis. I don't think so because gender is a quasi-suspect classification, so the court doesn't use rational basis. It's not strict scrutiny, but it's more than rational. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Judgment for the woman because gender discrimination violates Equal Protection. This seems too broad. While gender discrimination is subject to scrutiny, sometimes policies can survive if they meet the intermediate scrutiny.

Option C: State's police power. I think police power can justify some regulations, but when it comes to equal protection, the classification still needs to meet the scrutiny. So just citing police power isn't enough. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: Danger of the job justifies the policy. The state's reasoning is that the job is dangerous, so they're protecting women. But under equal protection, the state can't make broad generalizations based on gender. For instance, in the past, the Court struck down laws that excluded women from certain jobs for their protection, like the case where a woman couldn't work late hours. So D doesn't seem right because the danger alone isn't a valid basis for a gender-based classification.

Option E: Woman wins because the facts don't show substantial relation. This might be correct. The state's policy is based on protecting women, but the Court has held that such generalizations about women's abilities or need for protection aren't sufficient. The classification must be substantially related to an important interest, and here, the state's interest is in safety, but excluding all women isn't narrowly tailored. So E could be the right choice.

Option F: Privileges or immunities. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Privileges or Immunities Clause was in the Slaughter-House cases, but more recently, the Court has used it in cases like McDonald v. Chicago. However, I'm not sure if state employment qualifies as a privilege or immunity of state citizenship. Also, the issue here is more about Equal Protection, so F might not be the best fit.

Option G: Woman wins because not narrowly tailored. This aligns with intermediate scrutiny, which requires the policy to be narrowly tailored. The state's policy is a blanket ban on women, which isn't narrowly tailored. So G seems correct. But wait, I need to think about the standard. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the policy is substantially related to an important state interest. If the policy isn't narrowly tailored, then it fails. So G would be applicable.

Option H: Nature of position justifies gender classification. I don't think so because the Court has generally rejected such broad classifications. For example, in United States v. Virginia, the VMI case, the Court found that excluding women wasn't substantially related because it wasn't the only way to achieve the state's goals. So H is not correct.

Option I: State's compelling interest in safety. Wait, under intermediate scrutiny, the state doesn't need a compelling interest, but an important one. So if the state's interest is important, but the policy isn't substantially related, then it fails. Also, a compelling interest is a higher standard, so I think the state's argument here doesn't meet that. So I isn't the right choice.

Option J: Unjustified sex discrimination. This is correct because the policy is based on gender stereotypes, which is unjustified. So J seems correct as well.

Wait, so now I'm a bit confused between E, G, and J. Let me think again.

Option E says the facts don't demonstrate substantial relation. G says the policy isn't narrowly tailored. J says it's unjustified sex discrimination.

The correct standard is that gender classifications must be substantially related to an important governmental interest. So the state's policy would need to meet that.

The state's reasoning is that they want to protect their female officers. But in the case of Dothard v. Rawlinson, the Court considered whether excluding women from certain prison guard positions was constitutional. The Court held that the state's interest in reducing sexual harassment and assault in prisons was an important interest, but the policy excluding women wasn't substantially related because it was overbroad—there were some positions where the risks were lower, and the state could assess individual capabilities instead of a blanket ban.

Similarly, in this case, the state is excluding all women from a dangerous job. The policy isn't narrowly tailored because it doesn't consider individual abilities. So the policy fails the intermediate scrutiny because it's not substantially related—there's a less restrictive way to achieve the state's interest in safety.

So looking at the options, option E says the woman wins because the facts don't show the classification is substantially related. Option G says the policy isn't narrowly tailored, which is part of the same analysis.

Wait, but the options are phrased differently. Option E says the facts don't demonstrate that the classification is substantially related. Option G says the policy isn't narrowly tailored, which is a failure of the tailoring aspect.

In the case here, the state's policy is a blanket ban. So the policy isn't narrowly tailored, which would make G correct. But E is about substantial relation, which is the first part.

Wait, but the state's interest in protecting employees is an important one. So perhaps the issue is that the means aren't tailored. So the policy fails because it's not narrowly tailored, which is part of the intermediate scrutiny.

So, in that case, option G would be correct. Alternatively, option E could be correct if the policy isn't substantially related.

Alternatively, looking at the options, E says "the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification... is substantially related." So that might be the case if the state's interest isn't important or the relation isn't there.

But in this case, the state's interest is in protecting its employees, which is an important interest. The problem is that the means are too broad. So the failure is in narrow tailoring, not in the importance of the interest.

So the correct reasoning would be that the policy isn't narrowly tailored, making option G correct. But let me check the options again.

Option G: Judgment for the woman because the state's policy isn't narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. Wait, no, under intermediate scrutiny, the state doesn't need a compelling interest, just an important one. So option G is incorrect because it refers to a compelling interest. Oh wait, no, the option says "narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest." That's the strict scrutiny standard, not intermediate. So if the question is about intermediate scrutiny, which applies here, then G's reasoning is wrong because it's applying strict scrutiny.

So that means option G is incorrect. So the correct standard is intermediate scrutiny, which requires that the policy is substantially related to an important state interest. So the state's policy fails because it's not substantially related. So option E, which says the facts don't show substantial relation, would be correct.

Wait, but the state's interest is in protecting women, which is important. But the problem is that the policy is overbroad. So the classification isn't substantially related because it's not necessary to exclude all women. So the state could have less restrictive means, like assessing individual fitness.

So the correct holding is that the state's policy is unconstitutional because it fails the intermediate scrutiny. Therefore, the woman would win.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: Judgment for the woman, because the facts don't demonstrate that the classification is substantially related.

Option J: Judgment for the woman, because it's unjustified sex discrimination.

Option B: Judgment for the woman because gender discrimination violates Equal Protection.

I think the more precise answer is E, because it's about the substantial relation. But sometimes in exams, the broader statements are correct.

Wait, another approach: The state's policy is a gender-based classification, so it must be substantially related to an important state interest. The state's concern for safety is important, but the means chosen (a total ban on women) is not substantially related because it's too broad. So the policy fails.

So the correct option would be E, which says the facts don't show the classification is substantially related.

But option J says it's unjustified sex discrimination. That's more general. So which is the better answer?

Wait, looking at past cases, in Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, the Court struck down the single-sex admission policy because it wasn't substantially related. Similarly, in the present case, the state's policy isn't substantially related.

So in that case, the correct option is E. Alternatively, option J is more about the discrimination being unjustified, but the specific reasoning is that it's not substantially related.

Wait, but in J, it's about unjustified sex discrimination. That's a correct statement, but the legal reasoning ties into the Equal Protection analysis, which requires the state to meet the scrutiny. So perhaps option J is too general, while E is more specific.

Alternatively, option B says gender discrimination in state employment violates Equal Protection. That's a correct statement, but in some cases, like when the state meets the scrutiny, it doesn't. So option B is too broad.

So the best answer is E: the facts don't show the classification is substantially related.

Wait, but another angle: the state's policy is based on a stereotype that women are less capable or more in need of protection, which is an impermissible stereotype. So the policy is based on sex stereotypes, which is unconstitutional. That would fall under option J, which says it's unjustified sex discrimination.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J because the state's reasoning is based on impermissible gender stereotypes, making the discrimination unjustified. So the court would find it unconstitutional without needing to go into the scrutiny levels.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The analysis for gender discrimination is intermediate scrutiny. So the state must show that the policy is substantially related to an important interest. If the policy is based on stereotypes, it can't meet that standard.

So in this case, the state's policy is based on the belief that women are more vulnerable, which is a stereotype. Therefore, the policy isn't substantially related, making option E correct. Alternatively, the policy is based on impermissible stereotypes, making the discrimination unjustified, so J is correct.

Hmm. I think the key is that the state's policy is based on protecting women, which the Court has found to be an impermissible stereotype. So the correct reasoning is that the policy constitutes unjustified sex discrimination, making J the correct answer.

Wait, but in the case of Dothard v. Rawlinson, the Court upheld a statutory requirement that prison guards in maximum-security male prisons must be men. The Court found that the state's interest in reducing violence and sexual assault was important, and the classification was substantially related because the statistical evidence showed a high risk. But in that case, the Court allowed the classification because it was necessary, but in other cases, like when the exclusion is broader than necessary, it's struck down.

In our question, the job is dangerous, but the state is excluding all women. The Court would likely find that this is overbroad because it doesn't account for individual capabilities. So the policy isn't substantially related, making E correct. But another angle is that the state's reasoning is based on stereotypes, making J correct.

I'm a bit torn between E and J. But I think the precise reason is that the policy isn't substantially related because it's not necessary to exclude all women. So the answer would be E.

Alternatively, option G refers to strict scrutiny, which isn't the right standard, so it's incorrect.

Wait, looking back, option E says that the woman wins because the facts don't demonstrate that the classification is substantially related to an important state interest. So yes, that's the case here.

So I think the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure because sometimes the Court has allowed some gender-based classifications when they're substantially related. So in this case, the state's interest is safety, but the means are too broad. So the classification fails because it's not substantially related, making E correct.

Alternatively, if the state's interest is compelling, but the policy isn't narrowly tailored, that would be a strict scrutiny issue, but gender is under intermediate.

So, to sum up, the correct answer is E: Judgment for the woman because the facts don't show the classification is substantially related to an important state interest.

The question revolves around a gender-based policy that prohibits female officers from being assigned to a special undercover narcotics division. The state justifies this policy based on concerns for the safety and well-being of female officers, given the dangerous nature of the job. The woman sued, alleging that the policy violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The analysis focuses on whether the policy meets the constitutional standard for gender-based classifications, which requires intermediate scrutiny. Under this standard, the policy must be substantially related to an important state interest.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Incorrect. Gender-based classifications are subject to intermediate scrutiny, not rational basis review. The state's concern for safety is not enough to satisfy this higher standard.
   
2. **Option B**: Incorrect. While gender discrimination in state employment is subject to scrutiny, this option is too broad. The analysis must consider whether the policy meets the intermediate scrutiny standard.

3. **Option C**: Incorrect. While states have police power, the classification must still satisfy constitutional standards. The policy's validity depends on whether it is substantially related to an important state interest.

4. **Option D**: Incorrect. The dangerous nature of the job alone does not justify a gender-based classification. The Court has rejected similar justifications based on stereotypes about women's abilities or need for protection.

5. **Option E**: Correct. The state's policy fails because it is not substantially related to an important state interest. The blanket ban on women is overly broad and does not account for individual capabilities, making it unconstitutional under intermediate scrutiny.

6. **Option F**: Incorrect. The Privileges or Immunities Clause is not the primary issue here. The case is better analyzed under the Equal Protection Clause.

7. **Option G**: Incorrect. While the policy is not narrowly tailored, this option incorrectly applies strict scrutiny (requiring a "compelling interest") instead of intermediate scrutiny, which applies to gender classifications.

8. **Option H**: Incorrect. The nature of the position does not justify a gender-based classification. The Court has consistently rejected such broad generalizations.

9. **Option I**: Incorrect. The state's interest in safety is important, but the policy is not substantially related to that interest due to its overbroad nature.

10. **Option J**: Incorrect. While the policy constitutes sex discrimination, this option is too general. The specific issue is that the policy fails intermediate scrutiny because it is not substantially related to an important state interest.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option E**, as the state's policy is not substantially related to its stated interest in protecting female officers. The blanket ban on women in the narcotics division is overly broad and unconstitutional under intermediate scrutiny.
