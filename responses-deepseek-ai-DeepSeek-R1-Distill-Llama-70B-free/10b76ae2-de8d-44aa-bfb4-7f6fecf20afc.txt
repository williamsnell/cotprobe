Okay, so I've got this question here about dental topics suitable for toddlers. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is developmentally appropriate. Let me think this through.

First, I should consider what toddlers are like. They're usually between 1 to 3 years old. At this stage, their understanding is pretty basic. They're learning about the world through simple concepts and immediate experiences. So the topic should be something they can relate to and understand with their current cognitive abilities.

Looking at the options:

A: Growth of permanent teeth. Hmm, toddlers have baby teeth, and they start losing them around 6, but maybe they don't know about permanent teeth yet. That might be more for older kids.

B: Correct toothbrushing technique. Oh, yeah, toddlers are often taught to brush their teeth. It's a daily routine, so explaining how to do it correctly makes sense. They might not do it perfectly, but the concept is introduced.

C: Science behind root canal treatment. That sounds way too complex. Toddlers wouldn't understand medical procedures like that. Probably for adults or older kids.

D: Understanding the need for dentures. Dentures are for missing teeth, usually in older people. Toddlers have all their baby teeth, so this isn't relevant yet.

E: Teeth whitening procedures. That's a cosmetic procedure, more for teens or adults. Toddlers don't need to worry about that.

F: Correct use of dental floss. Flossing is a bit tricky even for young kids. They might start learning, but maybe it's a bit advanced. Toddlers might not have the dexterity yet, so perhaps it's more for older children.

G: Introduction to dental implants. That's a complex topic, definitely not for toddlers. They don't need to know about implants at this age.

H: Process of tooth extraction. Maybe older kids might understand, but toddlers are just starting to experience losing teeth naturally. They might not need detailed explanations about extractions.

I: Correct use of incisors while eating. Incisors are the front teeth used for cutting food. Toddlers are learning how to eat and chew, so understanding how their teeth function in eating could be appropriate. But is this topic too specific? Maybe, but it's something they can relate to.

J: Evolution of human tooth. That's a historical and biological concept, way beyond a toddler's understanding. They wouldn't grasp evolution at this age.

So, narrowing it down. B is about toothbrushing, which is a daily routine they participate in. I is about using incisors, which relates to eating. Both seem relevant, but which is more appropriate developmentally?

Toddlers are just learning to brush their teeth with assistance. They might not have the coordination for flossing yet (option F), so B seems more likely. Also, while using incisors is part of eating, the question is about a dental topic. Toothbrushing is a specific dental care routine, which is taught early on.

Therefore, I think option B is the correct answer.

The correct answer is B: Correct toothbrushing technique. This is a daily routine suitable for toddlers, who are learning basic dental care.
