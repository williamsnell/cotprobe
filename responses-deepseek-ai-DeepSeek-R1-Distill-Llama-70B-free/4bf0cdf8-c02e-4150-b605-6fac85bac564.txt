Question:

If twosubculturalgroups have different mean IQ's (e.g., Blacks and whites) can it be concluded from that evidence that heredity is the most important and influential determinant of intelligence ?

Options:

A: Yes
B: Yes, but only within the same socioeconomic status
C: Only if the differences are consistent across all environments
D: Not always
E: No
F: Maybe, if other factors like education and access to resources are equal
G: Maybe
H: Only if twin studies support the heredity hypothesis

Answer:

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about IQ differences between subcultural groups and whether that means heredity is the main factor. Hmm, so the question is asking if two groups, say Blacks and Whites, have different average IQs, does that automatically mean that heredity is the most important determinant of intelligence?

I remember from my psychology class that IQ scores can be influenced by a bunch of factors. Heredity is one of them, but environment plays a big role too. Like, things like education, nutrition, access to resources, and socioeconomic status can really impact IQ scores. So just because two groups have different mean IQs, you can't jump to the conclusion that it's all about genetics.

Wait, but I also recall that twin and adoption studies suggest there's a significant genetic component to intelligence. Heritability estimates are around 50-80%, but that's within a population, not necessarily across different populations. Also, heritability doesn't mean that the differences between groups are genetic because those groups might have different environmental factors.

So if two groups have different average IQs, it's not enough evidence to say heredity is the main cause. There could be systematic differences in environment, discrimination, access to education, and other social factors at play. For example, if one group has less access to quality education or faces more societal discrimination, that could lower their average IQ compared to another group, even if genetically there's no difference.

Looking at the options, option E says "No", which makes sense because the evidence alone doesn't prove heredity is the main factor. Option F says "Maybe, if other factors are equal", but the question doesn't specify that other factors are equal. So F isn't the right choice because we don't know if those factors are equal. Option D is "Not always", which is also correct because sometimes environment can cause the difference. Option C suggests consistency across environments, but the question doesn't provide that info.

Wait, the original question is whether it can be concluded from the evidence that heredity is the most important determinant. Since we can't rule out environmental factors just from mean differences, the answer should be that we can't conclude heredity is the main factor. So the correct answer would be E: No.

Alternatively, option F says maybe if other factors are equal, but the question doesn't state that those factors are equal, so F isn't the answer. So the best choice is E.

The question asks whether differences in mean IQ scores between two subcultural groups (e.g., Blacks and Whites) can be taken as evidence that heredity is the most important determinant of intelligence. 

IQ scores are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. While heritability studies suggest a genetic component to intelligence, these studies are typically conducted within populations, not across different populations. Differences in mean IQ between groups could stem from environmental factors such as education, socioeconomic status, discrimination, and access to resources, rather than heredity. Without controlling for these environmental variables, it is impossible to conclude that heredity is the primary cause of the observed differences. 

Option E ("No") is correct because the evidence alone does not prove heredity as the main factor. Other options, such as F, depend on conditions (e.g., equal access to resources) that are not specified in the question. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: No

Answer: E
