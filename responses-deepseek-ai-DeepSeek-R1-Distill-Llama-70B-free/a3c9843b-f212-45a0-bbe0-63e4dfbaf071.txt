Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the OSI model and brute-force attacks. Hmm, I remember the OSI model has seven layers, right? Let me try to list them out in order. Starting from the bottom, it's Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, the order is Physical (1), Data Link (2), Network (3), Transport (4), Session (5), Presentation (6), and Application (7). Got it.

The question is about failed sessions allowing brute-force attacks on access credentials. So, brute-force attacks are when someone tries multiple passwords or login attempts in a short time to gain unauthorized access. I think this relates to how sessions are managed because sessions involve the connection between a user and a system.

In the OSI model, each layer has specific functions. The Session layer (layer 5) is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating connections between applications. It handles sessions, like controlling the dialogue between applications. So if a session isn't managed properly, like not timing out after failed attempts, it could allow someone to keep trying different credentials, which is a brute-force attack.

So the question is, which layer's failed sessions enable these attacks? It must be the Session layer because that's where session management happens. If the session layer doesn't handle failed attempts properly, like not closing the session after too many failures, it allows the attack to proceed.

Looking at the options, option J is Session layer. So the answer should be J.

The OSI model's Session layer (layer 5) manages sessions, including handling failed attempts. Failed sessions here can enable brute-force attacks by not properly terminating after multiple login failures. 

Answer: J
