Question:

The Sojourn family went on a vacation. They started with $2000. If they spent $150 each day, which expression represents how much money they had after x days?

Options:

A: 1850x
B: 2000 / 150x

D: 2000x - 150
E: 2000 + 150/x
F: 150x
G: 2000 +150x
H: 2000 - 150/x
I: 2000 −150x
J: 150x - 2000

Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the Sojourn family's vacation. Let me read it again carefully. They started with $2000, and each day they spent $150. The question is asking which expression represents how much money they have left after x days. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I need to figure out the right algebraic expression for this scenario. Let me break it down. They begin with $2000. Each day, they subtract $150. So after one day, they'd have 2000 - 150. After two days, it would be 2000 - 150 -150, which is the same as 2000 - (150 * 2). So for x days, it should be 2000 minus 150 multiplied by x, right?

Wait, so the general formula is initial amount minus (daily spending multiplied by number of days). That makes sense. So the expression would be 2000 - 150x. Let me look at the options.

Looking through each choice:

A: 1850x. Hmm, why 1850? That might be if they spent 150 each day and 2000-150 is 1850, but that's just the first day. So this would multiply that by x, which isn't correct for multiple days. So A is not right.

B: 2000 / 150x. That's dividing their initial money by 150 times x. That doesn't make sense for this problem because they're spending each day, not dividing anything. So B is out.

C: 2000x - 150x. Oh, that's combining terms with x. Wait, that would factor to (2000 -150)x, which is 1850x. But that's the same as option A, which we thought was wrong. Because the initial amount isn't being multiplied by x, only the spending is. So C isn't correct.

D: 2000x -150. That would mean they're spending a fixed 150 each x days, but that's not the case. They spend 150 each day, so it's per day, not total. So D is incorrect.

E: 2000 +150/x. That's adding money, which doesn't fit because they're spending, not earning. So E is wrong.

F: 150x. That's just the total spent, not the remaining money. The question asks for how much they have left, so F isn't it.

G: 2000 +150x. Again, adding money. They started with 2000 and spent each day, so this doesn't fit. G is incorrect.

H: 2000 -150/x. Subtracting 150 divided by x. That would imply they spend less each day, but in reality, they spend the same each day. So H is wrong.

I: 2000 -150x. This fits exactly what I thought earlier. They start with 2000 and subtract 150 each day for x days.

J: 150x -2000. That's the total spent minus the initial amount, which would give a negative number (since 150x for x days would be less than 2000 for small x, but even when it's more, it shows a negative, which doesn't represent the remaining money correctly. So J isn't right.

So the correct answer must be I: 2000 −150x.
</think>

The Sojourn family starts with $2000 and spends $150 each day. To find the remaining money after \( x \) days, the correct expression is their initial amount minus the total spent, which is \( 2000 - 150x \).

A: Incorrect. Represents 1850 multiplied by \( x \), which doesn't model the scenario.  
B: Incorrect. Divides the initial amount by \( 150x \), which isn't relevant.  
C: Incorrect. Combines terms incorrectly, equivalent to \( 1850x \).  
D: Incorrect. Subtracts a fixed $150, not accounting for daily spending.  
E: Incorrect. Adds money, which doesn't fit the spending scenario.  
F: Incorrect. Represents total spending, not remaining money.  
G: Incorrect. Adds money, which isn't the case.  
H: Incorrect. Subtracts \( \frac{150}{x} \), implying uneven spending.  
I: Correct. Represents \( 2000 - 150x \), the remaining money after \( x \) days.  
J: Incorrect. Represents total spending minus initial amount, which doesn't reflect remaining money.
