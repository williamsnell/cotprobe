Okay, so I've got this question about the rational-economic model of decision-making. Hmm, I remember from my studies that decision-making models are categorized into different types, like rational, bounded rationality, and others. The question is asking about the assumptions of the rational-economic model. Let me think.

The rational-economic model, as I recall, assumes that decision-makers are perfectly rational. That means they have complete information about all possible alternatives and the outcomes of each choice. They can evaluate all options without any cognitive limitations and choose the best possible alternative that maximizes their utility or benefit.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A says decision-makers can predict outcomes with 100% accuracy. That sounds a bit too absolute. The model assumes they have complete info, but does that mean perfect prediction? I'm not sure. Maybe, but I think the key point is about having complete information, not necessarily perfect prediction.

Option B is about individuals vs groups, especially under stress. I don't think the rational model specifically addresses whether individuals or groups are better. It's more about individual decision-making processes, I think.

Option C says they emphasize costs over other consequences. That doesn't sound right. Rational model would consider all consequences, not just costs. Maybe in cost-benefit analysis, but the model itself is broader.

Option D: choose the alternative with the greatest personal benefit. That aligns with the idea of maximizing utility, so this could be a correct assumption of the model.

Option E: decision-makers are incapable due to cognitive limits. No, that's the bounded rationality model, not the rational-economic one. In the rational model, they can process all info perfectly.

Option F: knowledge about alternatives is incomplete. That's the opposite of what the rational model assumes. The model assumes complete info, so F is incorrect.

Option G: prioritize immediate benefits over long-term. I don't think that's part of the rational model. It just says they make the best choice given complete info, regardless of when the benefits occur.

Option H: decisions based on others' opinions. No, the model would suggest decisions are based on thorough analysis, not opinions. So H is wrong.

Option I: complete information about all alternatives and consequences. Yes, that's a key assumption. The rational model assumes that all info is available.

Option J: influenced by emotions and biases. No, the rational model assumes emotions don't interfere; decisions are purely rational.

So, the question is which option correctly describes the assumption. The question says the model is based on which assumption. So looking back, the options I and D are possible. Wait, the rational model assumes that decision-makers make the best choice, which would be option D. But another key assumption is that they have complete information, which is option I.

Wait, the question is about the basis. The model is based on the assumption that decision-makers are rational, which includes having complete information and selecting the optimal choice.

So looking at the options, both D and I are correct points. But the question is about which is the assumption. Let me think: the rational model's main assumptions are complete information and that the decision-maker will choose the option that maximizes their utility.

So the options are D and I. The question is which one is the correct answer as per the options given.

Wait, the actual question is "The rational-economic model is based on the assumption that:"

Looking at the options again. Option I says they have complete information. Option D says they choose the alternative that gives the greatest personal benefit.

So both are parts of the model. But which one is the correct option? Because the question is a multiple-choice, only one is correct.

Wait, the question is phrased as "based on the assumption that". So which is the underlying assumption?

The rational model assumes that decision-makers have complete information (I), and that they can evaluate all alternatives to pick the best option (D).

But looking at the options, the question is what the model is based on. So the model's foundation is that people make rational choices with complete info, leading them to pick the best option.

So the correct answer would be I: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.

Wait, but another perspective: the rational model also assumes that individuals act in their own self-interest, which is option D. So which one is more fundamental?

Alternatively, the model's primary assumption is that individuals will choose the option that maximizes their utility, given that they have complete information. So maybe D is the assumption, while I is a condition that allows that to happen.

Wait, but the question is about the assumption. So the model assumes that decision-makers can make rational decisions, which requires both complete information and the ability to choose optimally. But the question is, which option is correct?

Looking back, the correct answer is I and D. But only one can be correct as an option.

Wait, the options are:

I: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.

D: decision-makers will always choose the alternative that yields the greatest personal benefit.

I think both I and D are correct, but the question is which is the right answer. Let me think of the definition again.

The rational-economic model assumes that decision-makers have complete information, and that they can process all information to make the optimal choice. So in that case, both I and D are part of the model.

But looking at the options, the question is about which is the correct assumption.

Wait, the model is based on the assumption that decision-makers are rational, which includes both having complete information and choosing the best option.

But the options are separate. So perhaps the correct answer is I because without complete information, you can't make the optimal choice.

Wait, no. The model is based on the assumption that decision-makers act rationally, which includes both complete information and the ability to choose the best option.

But the question is which option is correct.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but I'm trying to remember what the standard assumptions are.

The rational model's main assumptions are:

1. Complete information: Decision-makers know all possible options and the consequences.
2. Rationality: They will choose the option that maximizes their utility.

So both I and D are correct statements about the model's assumptions.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer.

Wait, looking at the answer options, perhaps the correct answer is I and D. But only one can be chosen.

Wait, the options are A-J, so perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the model's assumption. The model assumes that decision-makers have complete information and can make the best choice. So in the options given, the correct answer would have to be the one that captures that.

But in the options, both I and D are correct. So perhaps the question is testing which is the correct assumption.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I because that's the foundation. Without complete information, you can't make the optimal choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's about the decision-making outcome.

Wait, the model is based on the assumption that people will choose the best option possible for themselves, which is D. But to do that, they must have complete info, which is I.

So perhaps the correct answer is I, as it's the condition required, and D is the outcome.

But the question is about the model's assumption. So which is more accurate?

The model assumes that decision-makers have complete information and that they will choose the optimal alternative.

So the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because D is also a correct statement.

Alternatively, let's think of the rational model as the one where decision-makers are utility maximizers, which is D.

So the model is based on the assumption that decision-makers will choose the alternative that gives them the greatest benefit, which is option D.

Wait, but without complete information (I), you can't do that. So the model also assumes complete info.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of the definitions again.

The rational-economic model makes several assumptions: 

1. Decision-makers have complete and perfect information about all alternatives.

2. They have the cognitive ability to evaluate all alternatives and their outcomes.

3. They are rational and will choose the option that maximizes their utility or self-interest.

So both I and D are correct, but in the options given, the question is which one is the assumption.

Looking back at the options, option I states that decision-makers have complete information, which is one assumption. Option D says they choose the best alternative, which is another.

So the question is which one is the correct answer. Since the question is about what the model is based on, perhaps the key assumption is that they act rationally to maximize their benefit, which is D.

Wait, but the model's foundation is that they can make rational decisions because they have complete info. So perhaps I is also correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact phrasing of the model's assumptions. From what I remember, the rational model assumes that individuals have complete information and that they make decisions to maximize their utility.

So the correct answer would include both I and D. But since each option is separate, the question is which is the correct one.

But the question is a single choice, so I need to pick between I and D.

Wait, the question is about the assumption that the model is based on. So perhaps the model is based on the assumption that decision-makers are rational and will choose the best option, which is D. The complete info is a condition that allows that.

So I think the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: look for the options given and see which is correct.

Another angle: the rational model is also called the economic model, which assumes that people make decisions based on rational self-interest, aiming to maximize their benefits. So that would point to D.

Yes, I think the correct answer is D.
</think>

The rational-economic model of decision-making is based on the assumption that decision-makers are rational and will choose the alternative that maximizes their utility or self-interest. This model assumes that individuals have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences, which enables them to evaluate options thoroughly and make the optimal choice. While both options I (complete information) and D (choosing the best alternative) are correct statements about the model's assumptions, the question asks for the assumption upon which the model is based. The foundation of the rational-economic model is the idea that decision-makers act rationally to maximize their personal benefit, which aligns with option D.

Answer: D
