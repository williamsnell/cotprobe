Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an air conditioner, and I'm a bit new to thermodynamics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The air conditioner is described as a refrigerator with the house as the cold reservoir and the outside as the hot reservoir. It uses 1.70 x 10^3 W of electrical power and is an ideal reversible Carnot refrigerator. The coefficient of performance (COP) is given as 3.30, and I need to find out how much heat it can extract from the house in a day.

Hmm, right. I remember that the COP for a refrigerator is defined as the heat removed from the cold reservoir divided by the work input. The formula might be COP = Q_cold / W, where W is the work done. So Q_cold is what we're looking for. 

Wait, but waitâ€”since the COP is given, rearranging the formula should help. So Q_cold = COP * W. That makes sense. But wait, the work done is the electrical power the air conditioner uses, right? So the power is 1.70e3 Watts, which is 1700 Joules per second. But we need to find the total heat extracted over a day, so I need to calculate the energy over time.

Let me jot down the given values:

Power (P) = 1.70 x 10^3 W (which is 1700 J/s)
COP = 3.30
Time period = 1 day = 24 hours = 24 * 60 * 60 seconds. Let's calculate that: 24*3600 = 86400 seconds.

Wait, so the work done (W) in a day would be power multiplied by time. So W = P * t = 1700 J/s * 86400 s. Let me compute that.

1700 * 86400: Let me break it down. 1700 * 86,400. Let's calculate 1.7e3 * 8.64e4 = (1.7 *8.64) * 1e7. 1.7 *8.64 is... Let's see: 1.7 *8 is 13.6, 1.7 *0.64 is about 1.088, so total about 14.688. So 14.688e7 J, which is 1.4688e8 J. Wait, wait. Alternatively, 1700 *86400: 86400 *1000 is 8.64e7, and 86400 *700 is 6.048e7. So 8.64e7 +6.048e7 = 14.688e7 J, same as before. So W = 1.4688e8 J.

But wait, the COP is Q_cold over W, so Q_cold = COP * W. So 3.30 * 1.4688e8 J.

Let me calculate that: 3.3 *1.4688e8. 3 *1.4688e8 is 4.4064e8, and 0.3 *1.4688e8 is 4.4064e7. Adding them together: 4.4064e8 + 0.44064e8 = 4.84704e8 J. So approximately 4.847e8 J. Let's see the options. Option G is 4.85e8 J. So that should be the right answer.

Wait wait, another way: The formula for COP in a Carnot refrigerator is also COP = T_c / (T_h - T_c), where T_c is the temperature of the cold reservoir (house) and T_h is the hot reservoir (outside). But I don't think I need that here because the COP is already given. So the approach I took should be correct.

Another thought: Did I get the COP formula correct? Yes, I think so. For refrigerators, COP is the heat moved from the cold reservoir divided by the work input. So the calculation should be correct.

So the answer should be G: 4.85 x 10^8 J.

To determine how much heat the air conditioner can extract from the house in a day, we use the formula for the coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{Q_{\text{cold}}}{W}
\]

Rearranging for \( Q_{\text{cold}} \), the heat extracted from the cold reservoir (the house):

\[
Q_{\text{cold}} = \text{COP} \cdot W
\]

### Given:
- Power consumed, \( P = 1.70 \times 10^3 \, \text{W} = 1700 \, \text{J/s} \)
- COP = 3.30
- Time period = 1 day = \( 24 \, \text{hours} = 86400 \, \text{seconds} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the total work input (\( W \)) over the day
\[
W = P \cdot t = 1700 \, \text{J/s} \cdot 86400 \, \text{s}
\]

Breaking this down:
\[
W = 1.7 \times 10^3 \cdot 8.64 \times 10^4 = (1.7 \cdot 8.64) \cdot 10^7 = 14.688 \cdot 10^7 = 1.4688 \times 10^8 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( Q_{\text{cold}} \)
Using \( Q_{\text{cold}} = \text{COP} \cdot W \):
\[
Q_{\text{cold}} = 3.30 \cdot 1.4688 \times 10^8
\]

Breaking this down:
\[
Q_{\text{cold}} = (3 \cdot 1.4688 \times 10^8) + (0.3 \cdot 1.4688 \times 10^8)
\]
\[
Q_{\text{cold}} = 4.4064 \times 10^8 + 0.44064 \times 10^8 = 4.84704 \times 10^8 \, \text{J}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total heat extracted from the house in a day is approximately \( 4.85 \times 10^8 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to **Option G**.
