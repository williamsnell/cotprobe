Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the density of carbon monoxide under certain conditions. Let me try to walk through this step by step. 

The question says that at standard conditions, 28.0 grams of carbon monoxide occupies 22.4 liters. Hmm, I remember that standard conditions are usually 0°C and 1 atm pressure. Wait, but the problem is asking about the density at 20°C and 600 torr. So I think I'll need to use the gas laws to adjust for the change in temperature and pressure.

First, I should recall the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Density is mass/volume, so maybe I can find the number of moles and then calculate the new volume under the given conditions to find the density.

Wait, let me see. At standard conditions, 28.0 g of CO is 22.4 L. So the molar mass of CO is 28.0 g/mol because 28 grams correspond to 22.4 L, which is 1 mole. Oh wait, no, wait. No, because 22.4 L is the volume at STP for 1 mole. So 28.0 grams would be 1 mole. So the molar mass is 28 g/mol. That makes sense because carbon is 12 and oxygen is 16, so 12 + 16 = 28 g/mol.

Now, the problem is asking for the density at 20°C and 600 torr. Density is mass per unit volume (g/L). So I need to find out what volume 1 mole of CO would occupy under those conditions and then calculate mass/volume.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to find the density directly. Let me think. The density (d) is equal to (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

Oh right! Because for an ideal gas, density d = mass/volume. And since PV = nRT, and n = mass/molar mass, combining these equations can give d = (P M) / (R T).

So let me note that down:

d = (P * M) / (R * T)

I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's plug in the values.

First, the pressure is given as 600 torr. Standard pressure is 1 atm, which is 760 torr. So I need to convert 600 torr to atm. Let me calculate that: 600 / 760 atm. Let me compute that. 600 divided by 760 is approximately 0.78947 atm.

Next, the temperature is 20°C. To convert to Kelvin, I add 273.15, which gives 293.15 K. I'll just use 293 K for simplicity.

The molar mass M is 28.0 g/mol, as I determined earlier.

The gas constant R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

Now plugging all into the equation:

d = (P * M) / (R * T)
d = (0.78947 atm * 28.0 g/mol) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 293 K)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.78947 * 28.0 = let's calculate that. 0.78947 * 28 ≈ 22.105 g·atm/mol.

Denominator: 0.0821 * 293 ≈ let's compute 0.0821 * 293. 0.08 * 293 is 23.44, and 0.0021*293 is ~0.6153. So total is approximately 24.055 L·atm/mol.

So d = 22.105 / 24.055 ≈ 0.919 g/L.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is 0.9198 g/l, which is very close to my calculation. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternative approach: Using the combined gas law. Since density is mass/volume, maybe I can find the volume under the new conditions for the same mass.

Wait, the initial condition is 28.0 g CO at STP (0°C, 760 torr) occupies 22.4 L. So I can use the combined gas law to find the volume at 20°C and 600 torr, then compute the density as 28.0 g divided by that new volume.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me try that.

The combined gas law is (P1 V1)/T1 = (P2 V2)/T2.

Here, for the same mass, n is constant, so this applies.

Initial conditions:
P1 = 760 torr (since STP is 760 torr)
V1 = 22.4 L
T1 = 273 K (0°C)

Final conditions:
P2 = 600 torr
T2 = 293 K (20°C)
V2 = ?

Let's solve for V2:

V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1)

Plugging numbers:

V2 = (760 * 22.4 * 293) / (600 * 273)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator: 760 * 22.4 = let's see, 760 * 20 is 15,200, and 760 * 2.4 is 1,824. So 15,200 + 1,824 = 17,024. Then 17,024 * 293. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe I'll compute it step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio first.

Wait, 760/600 is the same as 1.2667. Then, 293/273 is approximately 1.0739.

So the product of these ratios is 1.2667 * 1.0739 ≈ 1.359.

So V2 = 22.4 L * 1.359 ≈ 22.4 * 1.359.

Let me compute 22.4 * 1.3 = 29.12, and 22.4 * 0.059 ≈ 1.3216. So total is about 30.44 L.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 22.4 * 1.359:

22.4 * 1 =22.4
22.4 * 0.3 =6.72
22.4 * 0.05=1.12
22.4 * 0.009=0.2016
Adding all together:
22.4 + 6.72=29.12; +1.12=30.24; +0.2016=30.4416 L.

So V2 ≈30.44 L.

Now, the mass is 28.0 grams. So density d = 28.0 g / 30.44 L ≈ 0.9198 g/L.

Hmm, same result as before. So the density is approximately 0.9198 g/L, which matches option H.

Wait, but in the first approach using d = PM/(RT), I got 0.919 g/L, and this method also gives 0.9198. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, I can compute using more precise numbers for better accuracy.

Let me recompute the first approach with exact numbers.

P = 600 torr = 600/760 atm = 0.789473684 atm.

M =28.0 g/mol.

R=0.082057 L·atm/mol·K.

T=293.15 K.

d = (0.789473684 * 28.0) / (0.082057 * 293.15 )

Compute numerator: 0.789473684 * 28.0 = 22.1052463 g·atm/mol.

Denominator: 0.082057 * 293.15 = let's compute 0.082057 * 293 = ?

0.082057 * 200 = 16.4114

0.082057 * 93 = let's compute 0.082057 *90=7.38513; 0.082057 *3=0.246171 → total 7.38513 +0.246171=7.631301.

So 16.4114 +7.631301=24.042701. Then, the 0.15 part: 0.082057 *0.15=0.01230855. So total denominator is 24.042701 + 0.01230855≈24.05501.

So d=22.1052463 /24.05501 ≈ 0.9198 g/L.

Yes, exactly 0.9198, which matches option H.

So the correct answer is H.

To determine the density of carbon monoxide (CO) at 20°C and 600 torr, we use the relationship for density derived from the ideal gas law:

\[
d = \frac{P \cdot M}{R \cdot T}
\]

Where:  
- \(P\) is the pressure in atm,  
- \(M\) is the molar mass of CO (28.0 g/mol),  
- \(R\) is the gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K),  
- \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Convert pressure to atm
The given pressure is 600 torr. Since 1 atm = 760 torr:  
\[
P = \frac{600}{760} \approx 0.7895 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert temperature to Kelvin
The given temperature is 20°C. To convert to Kelvin:  
\[
T = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Plug values into the density equation
Substitute the values into the equation:  
\[
d = \frac{(0.7895 \, \text{atm}) \cdot (28.0 \, \text{g/mol})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K}) \cdot (293.15 \, \text{K})}.
\]

#### Numerator:  
\[
0.7895 \cdot 28.0 = 22.113 \, \text{g·atm/mol}.
\]

#### Denominator:  
\[
0.0821 \cdot 293.15 \approx 24.055 \, \text{L·atm/mol}.
\]

#### Density:  
\[
d = \frac{22.113}{24.055} \approx 0.9198 \, \text{g/L}.
\]

### Final Answer
The density of carbon monoxide at 20°C and 600 torr is approximately **0.9198 g/L**, which corresponds to option **H**.
