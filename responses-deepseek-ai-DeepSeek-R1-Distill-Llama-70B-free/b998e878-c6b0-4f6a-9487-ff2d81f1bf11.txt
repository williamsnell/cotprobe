Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The Johnson Supply Company has $3,160 of overhead that they distribute based on square feet occupied. I need to find out how much each department is charged, given their areas. The departments are Raw Materials, Manufacturing, Storage, and Administrative with areas 2,500 sq. ft., 5,000 sq. ft., 2,000 sq. ft., and 500 sq. ft. respectively.

Hmm, right. So the total overhead is $3,160, and it's allocated by the space each department uses. So the first thing I think I need to do is find the total square footage. Let me add up all the areas.

Raw Materials: 2,500
Manufacturing: 5,000
Storage: 2,000
Administrative: 500

Adding them up: 2500 + 5000 = 7500, plus 2000 is 9500, plus 500 makes 10,000 square feet total.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me recalculate that. 2500 plus 5000 is 7500, then 7500 +2000 is 9500, plus 500 is 10,000. Yep, that's correct.

So the total area is 10,000 sq. ft. Now, the total overhead is $3,160. So the overhead rate per square foot is total overhead divided by total square feet. So that's 3160 / 10000.

Let me compute that. 3160 divided by 10,000 is 0.316. So $0.316 per square foot.

Wait, but wait: 3160 divided by 10000. Let me do the division. 3160 ÷ 10,000 = 0.316 dollars per sq. ft. So that's like 31.6 cents per square foot.

Now I need to calculate each department's charge by multiplying their area by this rate.

Let me start with Raw Materials: 2,500 sq. ft.

So 2500 * 0.316. Let me compute this.

Breaking it down: 2500 * 0.3 is 750. 2500 * 0.016 is 40. So 750 +40 = 790. So Raw Materials would be charged $790.

Next, Manufacturing: 5,000 sq. ft.

5000 *0.316. Hmm. 5000 *0.3 is 1500, 5000 *0.016 is 80. So 1500 +80 = 1580. So Manufacturing is $1,580.

Then Storage: 2,000 sq. ft.

2000 *0.316. Let's see, 2000 *0.3=600, 2000 *0.016=32. So 600 +32=632. So Storage is $632.

Lastly, Administrative: 500 sq. ft.

500 *0.316. Let's compute that. 500 *0.3 is 150, 500 *0.016 is 8. So 150 +8=158. So Administrative is $158.

Wait, but let me check all these calculations again to be sure.

Raw Materials: 2500 * 0.316.

0.316 * 2500. Let me think of 0.316 as 316/1000. So 2500 * 316 = ?

Wait, maybe another approach. 2500 is 25 * 100. 316 *25 is... let's compute 316*20=6320, 316*5=1580, so 6320+1580=7900. Then divided by 100, it's 79. So 2500*0.316=790. Yep, correct.

Manufacturing: 5000 *0.316. 5000 is 5*1000. 0.316*5 is 1.58, so 1.58 *1000 is 1580. Correct.

Storage: 2000 *0.316.

2000 * 0.3 is 600, 2000 * 0.016 is 32. 600+32=632. Correct.

Administrative: 500 *0.316. 500*0.3=150, 500*0.016=8. So 158. Correct.

So the amounts are:

Raw Materials: $790

Manufacturing: $1,580

Storage: $632

Administrative: $158.

Now I need to look at the options and see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 820, 1640, 620, 160 → No.

Option B: 765, 1530, 645, 170 → No.

Option C: 800, 1600, 650, 150 → Close, but not matching.

Option D: 785, 1570, 640, 165 → No.

Option E: 795, 1590, 625, 150 → No.

Option F: 790, 1580, 632, 158 → Yes, that's exactly what I got.

Option G: 750, etc. No.

H: 780, different.

I: 810, etc.

J: 770, etc.

So the correct option is F: $790, $1580, $632, $158.

The Johnson Supply Company distributes its $3,160 of overhead based on square footage occupied. The total square footage of all departments is calculated as follows:

- **Raw Materials**: 2,500 sq. ft.
- **Manufacturing**: 5,000 sq. ft.
- **Storage**: 2,000 sq. ft.
- **Administrative**: 500 sq. ft.

**Total square footage** = 2,500 + 5,000 + 2,000 + 500 = **10,000 sq. ft.**

The overhead rate per square foot is:

\[
\text{Overhead rate} = \frac{\$3,160}{10,000 \, \text{sq. ft.}} = \$0.316 \, \text{per sq. ft.}
\]

Using this rate, the overhead charged to each department is calculated as:

1. **Raw Materials**:  
   \[
   2,500 \, \text{sq. ft.} \times \$0.316 = \$790
   \]

2. **Manufacturing**:  
   \[
   5,000 \, \text{sq. ft.} \times \$0.316 = \$1,580
   \]

3. **Storage**:  
   \[
   2,000 \, \text{sq. ft.} \times \$0.316 = \$632
   \]

4. **Administrative**:  
   \[
   500 \, \text{sq. ft.} \times \$0.316 = \$158
   \]

The amounts charged to the departments are:

- **Raw Materials**: \$790  
- **Manufacturing**: \$1,580  
- **Storage**: \$632  
- **Administrative**: \$158  

Comparing these values with the provided options, the correct match is **Option F**.

**Answer: F**
