Question:

To determine the average cost of running for a congressional seat, a simple random sample of 50 politicians is chosen and the politicians' records examined. The cost figures show a mean of $125,000 with a standard deviation of $32,000. Which of the following is the best interpretation of a 90% confidence interval estimate for the average cost of running for office?

Options:

A: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.
B: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.
C: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a total dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.
D: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.
E: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a maximum dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.
F: We are 90% confident that the standard deviation of the cost of running for a congressional seat is between $117,500 and $132,500.
G: We are 90% confident that the median cost of running for a congressional seat is between $117,500 and $132,500.
H: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.
I: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a minimum dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.
J: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a median dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.

Okay, so I have this statistics question in front of me about confidence intervals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about determining the average cost of running for a congressional seat. They took a simple random sample of 50 politicians, and the data shows a mean of $125,000 with a standard deviation of $32,000. They're asking about the interpretation of a 90% confidence interval estimate for the average cost.

Wait, so a confidence interval gives a range of values within which we expect the true population parameter to lie, based on our sample statistics. The confidence level is 90%, which means if we were to take many samples, we'd expect 90% of them to contain the true population mean.

Looking at the answer options, they all present different interpretations. I need to find the one that correctly describes what a 90% confidence interval means.

Option A says we're 90% confident that politicians spend between $117,500 and $132,500. Wait, that sounds like it's talking about individual politicians, not the average. Oh wait, no, because the confidence interval is for the average cost, right? So A might be correct, but let me look at the others.

Option B says 90% of politicians spend a mean between those amounts. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The mean is an average, and it's a single value. Also, the confidence interval isn't about the percentage of politicians but about our confidence in the mean's range.

Option C talks about 90% spending a total amount. That doesn't sound right either. The confidence interval is about the mean, not individual totals.

Option D is similar to A but phrased differently. It says 90% of politicians spend between those amounts. Again, that's about individual data points, not the mean. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E refers to a maximum dollar amount. No, the confidence interval for the mean doesn't relate to maximums, so E is out.

Option F mentions standard deviation. The question provided the sample's standard deviation, but the confidence interval is about the mean, not the standard deviation. So F is incorrect.

Option G is about the median cost. But the confidence interval here is calculated using the mean, not the median, so G isn't right.

Option H says we're 90% confident the mean is between those values. That sounds correct because the confidence interval for the mean would indeed be a range we're confident contains the true population mean.

Option I talks about a minimum dollar amount, which again is not what a confidence interval for the mean represents. So I is incorrect.

Option J is about the median again, so same issue as G. So J is out.

So going back, the correct interpretation is that we're 90% confident that the true average (mean) cost falls within that interval. So that points to option H as the correct answer.

To determine the correct interpretation of a 90% confidence interval estimate for the average cost of running for a congressional seat, it is important to understand that a confidence interval provides a range of values within which we are confident the true population parameter lies, based on the sample statistics. In this case, the confidence interval is for the mean cost.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Refers to the range $117,500 to $132,500 but does not explicitly state that this range represents the mean. It could be misinterpreted as referring to individual politicians' spending.
- **Option B**: Incorrectly suggests that 90% of politicians spend a mean amount within the range, which misrepresents the concept of a confidence interval.
- **Option C**: Refers to a total dollar amount, which is not relevant to the mean.
- **Option D**: Similar to A but also focuses on individual politicians, not the mean.
- **Option E**: Refers to a maximum dollar amount, which is unrelated to the confidence interval for the mean.
- **Option F**: Incorrectly associates the confidence interval with the standard deviation rather than the mean.
- **Option G**: Refers to the median cost, but the confidence interval is for the mean.
- **Option H**: Correctly states that we are 90% confident the mean dollar amount is between $117,500 and $132,500, aligning with the definition of a confidence interval for the mean.
- **Option I**: Refers to a minimum dollar amount, which is not relevant to the confidence interval for the mean.
- **Option J**: Refers to the median, which is not the focus of this confidence interval.

The best interpretation is **Option H**, as it accurately describes the 90% confidence interval for the mean cost.

Answer: H
