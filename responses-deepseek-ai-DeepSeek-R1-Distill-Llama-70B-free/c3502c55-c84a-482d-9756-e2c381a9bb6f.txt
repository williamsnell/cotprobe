Okay, so I have this problem where Frank Burger owns a paint and wallpaper store, and a customer wants to paper a room. I need to figure out how many single rolls of paper they'll need. Let's see, the room dimensions are 24 feet long, 18 feet wide, and 9 feet high. There's a window that's 3x8 feet and a door that's 4x9 feet. Also, there's a 10% waste allowed, and each roll has 36 square feet of paper. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, first step is to calculate the area of the walls in the room. Since the room has four walls, but two pairs are the same size. The first pair is the lengthwise walls, and the second is the widthwise walls.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The room is rectangular, so opposite walls are the same. So, the two longer walls are each 24 feet long and 9 feet high. The other two are 18 feet wide and 9 feet high.

So, the area of the two longer walls would be 2 * (24 * 9). And the two shorter walls would be 2 * (18 * 9).

Let me compute that:

Long walls: 24 *9 = 216 square feet each. So two of them make 432.

Short walls: 18 *9 = 162 each. Two make 324.

Total area of walls is 432 + 324 = 756 square feet.

But wait, we have to subtract the areas of the window and the door, since they won't be covered by wallpaper. So the window is 3x8, which is 24 square feet. The door is 4x9, which is 36 square feet.

So total area not covered is 24 + 36 = 60 square feet.

Subtracting that from the walls area: 756 - 60 = 696 square feet.

But wait, am I missing something? Because sometimes in these problems, they consider whether the ceiling or floor is being wallpapered, but the question says "paper a room", and usually that refers to the walls. So no, I think that's right.

Now, considering the 10% waste. So we need to calculate the total paper needed, then add 10% extra.

Wait, so the total area to cover is 696 square feet. But with 10% waste, that means the actual paper required is 696 * 1.10, right?

Let me compute that: 696 * 1.1. Let's see, 696 * 1 is 696, 696 * 0.1 is 69.6. So total is 696 + 69.6 = 765.6 square feet.

Each roll is 36 square feet. So how many rolls do we need?

Divide 765.6 by 36. Let's calculate that.

36 * 21 = 756. 765.6 -756 = 9.6. So 21 rolls would give 756, but we need 765.6, so 21 rolls are not enough. Need 22 rolls, because 21*36=756, 22*36=792. So 22 rolls would cover 792 square feet, which is more than 765.6 required.

Wait, but let me double-check. 36 times 21 is indeed 756, and 36 times 22 is 792. 765.6 is between them, so 22 rolls are needed.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in calculations. Let's go through each step again.

1. Calculate the area of each pair of walls.

Long walls: 2 * (24*9) = 2*216 = 432.

Short walls: 2 * (18*9) = 2*162 = 324.

Total walls: 432 + 324 = 756.

2. Subtract window and door area.

Window: 3*8=24.

Door:4*9=36.

Total subtracted area:24+36=60.

756 -60=696.

3. Add 10% for waste: 696 *1.1=765.6.

Number of rolls: 765.6 /36 = ?

Let me compute that division accurately.

36 * 21 is 756, as before. 765.6-756=9.6. So 9.6/36 = 0.26666... So total rolls needed is 21.266..., which means 22 rolls.

So the answer should be 22 rolls. Looking at the options, option C is 22 rolls.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I miss any other details? For example, sometimes in these problems, there's a double door or something, but the question says a door of 4x9. So no, that's correct. Also, the window is 3x8, which is correct.

Another possible mistake: Did I calculate the walls correctly? Let's see. Length is 24, width 18, height 9. So each long wall is 24*9, each short wall 18*9. Yes. So yes, 2*(24*9 +18*9) equals 2*(216+162) = 2*378=756. Correct.

So yes, I think the correct answer is 22 rolls, which is option C.

To determine how many single rolls of wallpaper are required, we start by calculating the total area of the walls in the room. The room has dimensions 24 feet long, 18 feet wide, and 9 feet high. There are two pairs of walls: 

1. **Long walls**: Each is 24 feet long and 9 feet high.  
   Area of one long wall: \( 24 \times 9 = 216 \, \text{square feet} \).  
   Total area for two long walls: \( 2 \times 216 = 432 \, \text{square feet} \).

2. **Short walls**: Each is 18 feet wide and 9 feet high.  
   Area of one short wall: \( 18 \times 9 = 162 \, \text{square feet} \).  
   Total area for two short walls: \( 2 \times 162 = 324 \, \text{square feet} \).

The total area of all walls is:  
\[
432 + 324 = 756 \, \text{square feet}.
\]

Next, we subtract the areas of the window and the door, as these will not be covered by wallpaper:  
- Window area: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \, \text{square feet} \).  
- Door area: \( 4 \times 9 = 36 \, \text{square feet} \).  
Total area not covered: \( 24 + 36 = 60 \, \text{square feet} \).  

Subtracting this from the total wall area:  
\[
756 - 60 = 696 \, \text{square feet}.
\]

To account for 10% waste, we increase the total area by 10%:  
\[
696 \times 1.10 = 765.6 \, \text{square feet}.
\]

Each roll of wallpaper covers \( 36 \, \text{square feet} \). To find the number of rolls required, divide the total area by the area of one roll:  
\[
\frac{765.6}{36} \approx 21.27 \, \text{rolls}.
\]

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a roll, we round up to the next whole number, resulting in **22 rolls**.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C: 22 rolls**.
