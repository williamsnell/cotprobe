Question:

Which of the following statements about human amino acid requirements in human nutrition is correct?


Options:

A: The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages.
B: The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages.
C: The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children.
D: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about amino acid requirements in human nutrition, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which statement about amino acid requirements is correct. The options are A through D. Let me go through each one and see what I remember from my studies.

First, I remember that amino acids are crucial for growth and maintenance. Adults and children have different needs because of growth stages and body maintenance. 

Looking at option A: "The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages." Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Adults are in maintenance, not growth, so their needs might be lower than children's. I think children, especially infants, require more of certain amino acids for growth. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: "The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages." Wait, adults' needs are for maintenance, but children also have growth needs. So this could be correct because adults' requirements are for maintenance, but does that mean the same for all ages? Not sure yet. I'll come back to this.

Option C: "The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children." I remember that breast milk composition is considered optimal for infants, but does that apply to all children? Probably not, because as children grow older, their dietary needs change. So C might not be correct.

Option D: "The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children." I think this is about the idea that the amino acid profile of tissues reflects what's needed for growth. Infants need to build tissues, so their requirements would align with what's present in tissues. I've heard that breast milk's amino acid profile is based on tissue needs for infants. So D might be correct.

Wait, let me piece this together. For infants, the requirement is based on what's needed for growth, so their amino acid needs are higher. The amino acid pattern in breast milk is considered the gold standard for infants. But the question here is about the pattern of human tissue protein being the requirement for infants and young children. So if human tissue has a certain amino acid composition, that's what infants need to build their tissues, so D sounds correct.

But what about option C? It says breast milk is the requirement for all children, which is probably not right. Because as children get older, they don't drink breast milk anymore, and their requirements might change. So C is incorrect.

Going back to B: If adult requirements are for maintenance, but children have higher needs for growth, then B can't be correct because it's not just maintenance for all ages. So B is incorrect.

Then, option A is definitely wrong because adults' requirements can't apply to all ages, especially children.

So the correct answer is D. The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is used as the requirement for infants and young children.

The correct answer is:

D: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.

This is because infants and young children require amino acids to support growth and tissue development, and the amino acid composition of human tissue reflects these needs. Breast milk, which aligns with tissue requirements, is considered optimal for infants, but this does not apply to all children as needs change with age. Adult amino acid requirements are for maintenance and do not account for growth needs in children.

Answer: D
