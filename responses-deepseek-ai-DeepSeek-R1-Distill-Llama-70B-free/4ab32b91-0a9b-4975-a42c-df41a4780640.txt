Okay, so I need to solve this expression: (i + 1)(5 – 5i)(5 + 5i). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on complex numbers, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with products of complex numbers, it's often easier to handle two factors at a time. So maybe I should multiply two of them first and then multiply the result with the third.

Looking at the terms, I notice that (5 – 5i) and (5 + 5i) are conjugates of each other. Oh right, the product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number. The formula is (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So let's apply that here.

Calculating (5 – 5i)(5 + 5i):
Let me set a = 5 and b = 5i. So a² is 5² = 25. b² is (5i)² = 25i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 25*(-1) = -25. So a² - b² is 25 - (-25) = 25 +25 =50. Wait, but wait, 25 - (25i²) is 25 - (-25) which is 50. So the product of those two terms is 50.

Okay, so now the expression simplifies to (i + 1) * 50. That part seems easier.

Wait, let me double-check that. 5 times 5 is 25, and 5i times -5i is -25i², which is +25, so yes, 25 + 25 =50. Got it.

Now multiply (i + 1) by 50. So that's 50*(i +1) =50i +50. Which can be written as 50 +50i.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option C is 50 +50i, and option A is 50 –50i. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no, because (i +1) is 1 +i. So when you multiply by 50, it's 50*1 +50*i =50 +50i. So that's correct. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the multiplication order. Because (i +1)(something) could be done in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe I should have multiplied (i +1) with (5 –5i) first. Let me try that approach to double-check.

So (i +1)(5 –5i). Let's expand this:

i*5 =5i
i*(-5i) =-5i²
1*5 =5
1*(-5i) =-5i

So adding all those together:5i -5i² +5 -5i. 

Now, i² is -1, so -5i² becomes +5.

So 5i -5i +5 +5. The 5i and -5i cancel out, leaving 5 +5 =10.

So the product (i+1)(5-5i) is 10. Then multiply that by (5+5i).

Wait, but earlier I thought (5 –5i)(5+5i) is 50, and then (i+1)*50 is 50+50i. Now, this approach is different. So which one is correct?

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in this second approach. Because (i+1)(5-5i) is 10, then 10*(5+5i) would be 50 +50i. So same answer as before, 50+50i. So option C.

Wait, but wait another thing, perhaps I should check the multiplication again. Let me redo the (i+1)(5-5i) step.

Multiply (i+1)(5-5i):
i*5 =5i
i*(-5i)=-5i²
1*5=5
1*(-5i)=-5i.

So terms are 5i, -5i²,5,-5i.

Combine like terms: 5i -5i =0. So left with 5 + (-5i²). Since i² is -1, -5*(-1)=5. So 5 +5=10. So yes, that's correct.

Then 10*(5+5i)=50 +50i, which is option C.

But wait, I thought the initial approach was (5-5i)(5+5i)=50, then (i+1)*50=50+50i. So same result.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 50 +50i, which is what I have. So that's correct.

But wait, let me look at the answer options again. The options are:

A:50-50i
B:75-75i
C:50+50i
D:25+25i
E:50-25i
F:50+25i
G:100-100i
H:100+100i
I:75+75i
J:25-25i.

So the correct answer is C, 50 +50i.

Wait, but wait another thought. Could I have made a mistake in the order of multiplication? Like, perhaps I should have grouped differently.

Another approach: Let's compute (5 –5i)(5 +5i) first, which gives 50 as before. Then multiply (i+1) by 50.

Yes, so (i+1)*50=50i +50=50+50i, which is option C.

So the answer should be C. But wait, I'm confused because initially in the first approach, I thought of 50 +50i, which is option C.

But wait, looking at the problem again, the original expression is (i+1)(5-5i)(5+5i). Oh wait, perhaps I should have multiplied (5-5i)(5+5i) first, getting 50, then multiply (i+1) by 50, giving 50+50i. So yes, option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because another approach gave me 10*(5+5i)=50+50i, same answer. So I think I'm confident it's C.

To solve the expression \((i + 1)(5 - 5i)(5 + 5i)\), we can simplify it step by step.

1. **Multiply \((5 - 5i)(5 + 5i)\):**  
   These are complex conjugates, and their product is calculated as:  
   \[
   (5 - 5i)(5 + 5i) = 5^2 - (5i)^2 = 25 - 25i^2
   \]  
   Since \(i^2 = -1\), this becomes:  
   \[
   25 - 25(-1) = 25 + 25 = 50
   \]

2. **Multiply the result by \((i + 1)\):**  
   Now, the expression simplifies to \((i + 1) \cdot 50\). Distributing the 50:  
   \[
   (i + 1) \cdot 50 = 50i + 50 = 50 + 50i
   \]

3. **Verify the result:**  
   The final result is \(50 + 50i\), which matches option **C** in the given choices.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: 50 + 50i**

C
