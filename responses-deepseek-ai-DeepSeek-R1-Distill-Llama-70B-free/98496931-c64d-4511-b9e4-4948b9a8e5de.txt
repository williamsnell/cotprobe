Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about an infinite hollow circular cylinder of dielectric material. Hmm, I remember that dielectrics are insulating materials that get polarized when placed in an electric field. The setup here is that the cylinder's axis is perpendicular to a uniform electric field E. The cylinder has inner radius a and outer radius b, with b being larger than a. The dielectric constant is K. The question is asking for the electric field in the hollow space, which I'm assuming is the region inside the cylinder (r < a) because the cylinder itself is hollow.

Wait, no, the hollow space would be the region inside, right? Because the cylinder is between a and b, so the hollow is r < a. So we're looking for E in that region.

I remember that when dealing with dielectrics, especially in situations where the fields are static and the medium is linear and isotropic, we can use the concept of displacement field D. The displacement field D is given by D = ε₀ E + P, where P is the polarization. But in linear isotropic dielectrics, P is proportional to E, so P = χe ε₀ E, where χe is the electric susceptibility. Since K is the dielectric constant, which is 1 + χe, so χe = K - 1. Therefore, D = ε₀ E (1 + χe) = ε₀ K E. Wait, no, I think I might have that wrong. Let me think: D = ε₀ E + P. P = χe ε₀ E. So D = ε₀ E (1 + χe) = ε₀ K E. Because K = 1 + χe. So that's right, D is continuous across boundaries in the absence of free surface charges.

In this problem, since the cylinder is placed in an external uniform field, the field inside the dielectric and the surrounding regions would be affected. But wait, the cylinder is hollow, so the field in r < a is what we're after.

Wait, wait. The cylinder is placed with its axis perpendicular to the uniform field. So the external field is uniform and perpendicular to the cylinder's axis, which is along, say, the z-axis, so the field is in the radial direction in the x-y plane.

I think this is a problem that can be solved using the method of solving Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates, considering the boundary conditions. Because the field is static, and there's symmetry, so we can use separation of variables.

So, the general solution for the potential in regions with different materials would be considered. The regions are:

1. r < a: the hollow space (vacuum or air, K=1)
2. a ≤ r ≤ b: dielectric material (K)
3. r > b: again vacuum or air, K=1

Wait, no, the problem says it's an infinite hollow cylinder, so the region outside is also r > b, which would be vacuum (assuming no other materials mentioned). So we have three regions: r < a (hollow, vacuum), a < r < b (dielectric), and r > b (vacuum).

The external field is uniform, let's say along the x-axis, so in the region r > b, the field is uniform. But when the cylinder is placed, the field inside the dielectric and the hollow would change.

Wait, no. Wait, the external field is uniform, but when you introduce a dielectric cylinder, the field lines would be perturbed. So the uniform field would be distorted inside and outside the cylinder.

But wait, the cylinder is hollow, so the field in the hollow (r < a) is what we need to find.

I think the approach is to model the potential in each region and apply boundary conditions at r = a and r = b.

Because the field is along the x-axis, the potential will depend on x and y but due to symmetry, it's easier to use cylindrical coordinates, considering the dependence on r and θ.

In the external region (r > b), the potential due to the uniform field plus any disturbance from the cylinder. Similarly, in the region a < r < b, the potential inside the dielectric, and in the hollow space (r < a), the potential due to the field plus the induced charges.

Wait, but the external field is uniform, so maybe that's the applied field. So the total field is the sum of the applied field and the field due to the polarization charges in the cylinder.

Alternatively, let me think about the method. The problem is similar to a dielectric cylinder placed in an external uniform electric field. The field inside the hollow can be found by considering the solution to Laplace's equation in each region with the appropriate boundary conditions.

The potential in each region would be of the form:

- Inside the hollow (r < a): V1(r,θ) = A1 r cosθ + B1/r cosθ + ... but considering only the terms that are finite at r=0, so V1 = A1 r cosθ.

- Inside the dielectric (a ≤ r ≤ b): V2(r,θ) = A2 r cosθ + B2 / r cosθ.

- Outside the dielectric (r > b): V3(r,θ) = E r cosθ + A3 / r cosθ.

Wait, no. Because the external field is uniform and along, say, the x-axis, which corresponds to E r cosθ in polar coordinates. So in the region r > b, the potential is due to the external field plus any multipole contributions. But because the cylinder is infinite and the geometry is symmetric, the only non-zero term would be the uniform field plus a dipole term, perhaps.

Wait, but no, because the cylinder is a dielectric, so it would cause some polarization, leading to bound charges. The external field would cause polarization in the cylinder, leading to surface bound charges at r = a and r = b.

Since the cylinder is infinite and the field is uniform, the potential inside the dielectric (a < r < b) would have terms in r cosθ and terms like (1/r) cosθ. But at the surfaces a and b, the potential and the displacement field D must satisfy certain boundary conditions.

Wait, the electric displacement D is D = ε₀ K E in the dielectric regions, right? Because D = ε E, where ε = ε₀ K.

So at the boundaries, the discontinuity in E is related to surface charges, but D has a discontinuity in its normal component equal to the free surface charge density. However, in this problem, is there any free charge? The problem doesn't mention any, so I think the only charges are the bound charges due to the dielectric.

But wait, in the case of dielectrics without free charges, the displacement field D is continuous across the boundary because there's no free surface charge. So the normal component of D is continuous.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to lay out the approach step by step.

First, the external field is E applied in the x-direction. So in the region r > b, the field is E_x = E. The potential due to this is V_ext = -E r cosθ.

But when the dielectric cylinder is placed in this field, it gets polarized. The polarization P is proportional to E inside the dielectric. So the cylinder will have bound charges: volume charge ρ_b = -∇·P and surface charge σ_b = P·n, where n is the normal vector at the surface.

Wait, but since the cylinder is infinite, and the field is uniform, perhaps the volume charge is zero? Or maybe not. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by solving for the potential in each region, applying boundary conditions.

So in region 1 (r < a): the potential V1 is the sum of the external field's potential and the potential due to the polarization of the cylinder. But since it's a linear problem, we can model it as a superposition.

Wait, perhaps using the method of images or boundary conditions is better.

Let me think again. Since the cylinder is placed in the uniform field, the potential in each region would consist of terms involving cosθ because of the symmetry. So we can write the potentials as:

V1(r,θ) = (A r + B/r) cosθ, but for r < a, the potential must remain finite as r approaches 0, so B must be zero. Therefore, V1 = A r cosθ.

In region 2 (a ≤ r ≤ b): V2(r,θ) = (C r + D/r) cosθ.

In region 3 (r > b): V3(r,θ) = (E r + F/r) cosθ. But the external field is E in the x-direction, so the potential here should approach -E r cosθ as r becomes large. So V3 = (-E r + F/r) cosθ, because as r→∞, V3 approaches -E r cosθ.

Now, the boundary conditions are at r = a and r = b.

At each boundary, the potential V must be continuous, and the derivative of V with respect to r must satisfy the discontinuity due to the dielectric.

Wait, but the electric field E is related to the derivative of V. Also, the displacement field D must be continuous across the boundary because there are no free surface charges (since the problem doesn't mention any, I assume σ_free = 0). Wait, no, the displacement field D has a discontinuity equal to free surface charge. But in this problem, are there any free charges? The cylinder is a dielectric, so it only has bound charges. So the free surface charge is zero. Therefore, D must be continuous across the surfaces at r = a and r = b.

Wait, but D is equal to ε₀ K E in the dielectric, and ε₀ E in vacuum. So at r = a, moving from region 1 (vacuum) to region 2 (dielectric), the normal component of D must be continuous.

Similarly, at r = b, moving from region 2 (dielectric) to region 3 (vacuum), the normal component of D must be continuous.

So let's compute the electric fields in each region.

In region 1: E1 = -∇V1 = - (dV1/dr) ê_r + ... but since V1 only depends on r and θ, and for V1 = A r cosθ, the gradient in cylindrical coordinates would be:

E1_r = -dV1/dr = -A cosθ

E1_θ = -(1/r) dV1/dθ = A sinθ

E1_φ = 0

Similarly, in region 2, E2 = -∇V2 = [ -d/dr (C r + D/r) cosθ ] ê_r - [ (1/r) d/dr (C r + D/r) ] sinθ ê_θ

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The general expression for the gradient in cylindrical coordinates is:

∇V = (dV/dr) ê_r + (1/r) (dV/dθ) ê_θ + (1/r sinθ) (dV/dφ) ê_φ.

Since the potential only depends on r and θ, and for this problem, it's symmetric around the x-axis, so V depends on θ as cosθ. So for V2 = (C r + D/r) cosθ,

dV2/dr = [C - D/r²] cosθ

dV2/dθ = - (C r + D/r) sinθ

So E2_r = -dV2/dr = [ -C + D/r² ] cosθ

E2_θ = -(1/r) dV2/dθ = (C r + D/r) sinθ / r = (C + D/(r²)) sinθ

In region 3, V3 = (-E r + F/r) cosθ

So dV3/dr = [ -E - F/r² ] cosθ

dV3/dθ = (E r - F/r) sinθ

E3_r = -dV3/dr = [ E + F/r² ] cosθ

E3_θ = -(1/r) dV3/dθ = [ -E r + F/r ] (sinθ) / r = [ -E + F/(r²) ] sinθ

Now, the boundary conditions at r = a and r = b.

At r = a:

Continuity of V: V1(a) = V2(a)

So A a cosθ = [ C a + D/a ] cosθ → A a = C a + D/a → A = C + D/(a²)  ...(1)

Continuity of D_r: D1_r = D2_r

In region 1, D1 = ε₀ E1. So D1_r = ε₀ E1_r = ε₀ (-A cosθ)

In region 2, D2 = ε₀ K E2. So D2_r = ε₀ K ( [ -C + D/a² ] cosθ )

At r = a, D1_r = D2_r:

ε₀ (-A cosθ) = ε₀ K ( (-C + D/a² ) cosθ )

Divide both sides by ε₀ cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠ 0, which it is except at θ=π/2, etc., but considering the general case):

-A = K (-C + D/a² )

→ A = K ( C - D/a² )  ...(2)

Now, from equation (1): A = C + D/a²

Substitute into equation (2):

C + D/a² = K ( C - D/a² )

Bring all terms to left:

C + D/a² - K C + K D/a² = 0

C (1 - K) + D (1 + K)/a² = 0  ...(3)

Similarly, at r = b, the same boundary conditions apply.

At r = b:

Continuity of V: V2(b) = V3(b)

[ C b + D/b ] cosθ = [ -E b + F/b ] cosθ

→ C b + D/b = -E b + F/b → Multiply both sides by b:

C b² + D = -E b² + F  ...(4)

Continuity of D_r: D2_r (at r=b) = D3_r (at r=b)

D2_r = ε₀ K E2_r = ε₀ K [ (-C + D/b² ) cosθ ]

D3_r = ε₀ E3_r = ε₀ [ E + F/b² ] cosθ

So,

ε₀ K ( -C + D/b² ) cosθ = ε₀ ( E + F/b² ) cosθ

Divide both sides by ε₀ cosθ:

K (-C + D/b² ) = E + F/b²  ...(5)

Now, equation (4) and (5) are two equations in variables C, D, F.

Wait, but we have equations (3) from r=a, and equations (4) and (5) from r=b. Let's try to solve for the variables.

Let me count variables: A, C, D, F, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of E and find a relation.

Wait, but the problem is to find the field in the hollow, which is region 1. The field in region 1 is E1_r = -A cosθ, E1_θ = A sinθ.

But the uniform external field is E in the x-direction, which is E = E ê_x = E (ê_r cosθ - ê_θ sinθ ). So the applied field in region 3 is E_r = E cosθ, E_θ = -E sinθ.

Wait, but in our setup, the potential in region 3 is V3 = (-E r + F/r) cosθ, so the field is E3_r = (E + F/r²) cosθ, and E3_θ = ( -E + F/r² ) sinθ.

At r approaching infinity, E3 should reduce to the applied uniform field E, which would require F to be zero? Because as r→∞, F/r² → 0, so E3_r → E cosθ, E3_θ → -E sinθ, which corresponds to the uniform field E in x-direction.

Wait, no. Because the uniform field E would have E_r = E cosθ, E_θ = -E sinθ. So in region 3, as r → ∞, E3_r should approach E cosθ, and E3_θ approach -E sinθ. So in V3, to get that, the coefficient of (1/r) cosθ is F, which must be zero because as r→∞, the term F/r goes to zero. So F = 0.

Wait, but wait, V3 is (-E r + F/r ) cosθ. So the field E3_r is (E + F/r² ) cosθ, and E3_θ is ( -E + F/r² ) sinθ.

At r→∞, F/r² → 0, so E3_r → E cosθ, E3_θ → -E sinθ. So yes, that matches the uniform field. So F must be zero to avoid any additional terms at infinity. So F = 0.

So equation (4) becomes: C b² + D = -E b² + 0 → C b² + D = -E b²  ...(4a)

Equation (5) becomes: K (-C + D/b² ) = E + 0 → K ( -C + D/b² ) = E  ...(5a)

Now, from equation (4a): D = -E b² - C b²

Substitute D into equation (5a):

K [ -C + ( -E b² - C b² ) / b² ] = E

Simplify inside the brackets:

- C + [ -E b² / b² - C b² / b² ] = -C - E - C = -2C - E

So K ( -2C - E ) = E

→ -2 K C - K E = E

→ -2 K C = E (1 + K )

→ C = - E (1 + K ) / (2 K )

Now, substitute C into equation (4a) to find D.

From (4a): D = -E b² - C b² = -E b² - [ - E (1 + K ) / (2 K ) ] b²

= -E b² + E (1 + K ) b² / (2 K )

= E b² [ -1 + (1 + K)/(2 K) ]

= E b² [ (-2 K + 1 + K ) / (2 K ) ]

= E b² [ (-K + 1 ) / (2 K ) ]

= E b² (1 - K ) / ( 2 K )

So D = E b² (1 - K ) / ( 2 K )

Now, go back to equation (3):
