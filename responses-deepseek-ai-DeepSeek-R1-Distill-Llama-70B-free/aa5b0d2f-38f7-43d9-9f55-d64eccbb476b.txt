Okay, so I'm trying to solve this bank reconciliation problem, and honestly, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, Mr. Blake has a checking account. On September 1, he received a bank statement. The closing balance on the statement is $1,810.50. But in his checkbook, the balance is $1,685.75. Hmm, so there's a difference between what the bank says and what his checkbook shows.

The problem mentions that when comparing his check stubs to the bank statement, he noticed that some checks are missing. Specifically, checks for $60.80, $40.30, and $25.00 didn't appear on the statement. Oh right, that means the bank hasn't processed those checks yet. So those are outstanding checks. They would have been written by Mr. Blake but not yet deducted by the bank.

Also, there's a service charge of $1.35 on the statement that isn't in his checkbook. So that's a bank fee that he hasn't recorded yet. That means the bank has deducted this amount, but his checkbook doesn't reflect it yet.

The goal is to prepare a reconciliation statement. I remember that the purpose of reconciliation is to find out why the two balances don't match and to adjust them so they agree. The adjusted balance should show the correct cash balance.

So, I think the steps are something like this: Take the bank's closing balance and add any deposits that were made but not yet recorded by the bank, then subtract any outstanding checks. Also, subtract any bank charges that weren't in the checkbook. Alternatively, maybe start with the checkbook balance and adjust for the missing items.

Wait, let me think again. The bank statement is $1,810.50. His checkbook is $1,685.75. So the bank shows a higher balance. But that seems a bit odd because usually, the checkbook might have more because of outstanding checks.

Wait no, because if the checks haven't been processed by the bank yet, the bank's balance would be higher. Because the bank hasn't subtracted those checks yet. So that's why the bank's balance is higher.

So, the bank's balance is $1,810.50, but Mr. Blake's checkbook is lower because he's recorded the checks that the bank hasn't processed yet. So to reconcile, we need to subtract those outstanding checks from the bank's balance and see if there are any other adjustments, like the service charge.

Wait, but the service charge is on the bank statement but not in the checkbook. So Mr. Blake's checkbook doesn't include that deduction, which means his checkbook balance is higher than it should be by $1.35. So we need to subtract that from his checkbook balance.

Wait, maybe I should approach this systematically. Let me outline the steps.

1. Start with the bank's closing balance: $1,810.50.

2. Subtract any outstanding checks that have been written but not yet deducted by the bank. The outstanding checks are $60.80, $40.30, and $25.00. So total outstanding checks are 60.80 + 40.30 = 101.10, plus 25 is 126.10.

So, subtract $126.10 from the bank's balance: 1,810.50 - 126.10 = 1,684.40.

3. Then, check if there are any bank charges or errors. The service charge is $1.35, which is on the bank statement but not in the checkbook. So, the bank has already deducted this, but the checkbook hasn't. So, to reconcile, we need to subtract this amount from the checkbook balance.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should adjust the bank's balance or the checkbook's balance. Let me think: The service charge is an expense that the bank deducted, so the checkbook needs to reflect that. So, the checkbook balance is higher by $1.35 than it should be. So, the correct checkbook balance after the service charge would be 1,685.75 - 1.35 = 1,684.40.

Wait, wait. Let me see. The bank's balance after subtracting the outstanding checks is 1,684.40. The checkbook's adjusted balance is also 1,684.40 because we subtracted the service charge. So that means the two should match now.

So the correct cash balance after reconciliation should be $1,684.40.

Wait, but the options don't have that exact number. Let me check the options again. The options are A to J. Option G is $1,684.40. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with the bank's balance: $1,810.50.

Outstanding checks: 60.80 + 40.30 + 25.00 = 126.10. So bank's adjusted balance is 1,810.50 - 126.10 = 1,684.40.

Now, the checkbook balance is $1,685.75. But the service charge of $1.35 hasn't been subtracted in the checkbook. So, 1,685.75 - 1.35 = 1,684.40.

Yes, so both adjusted balances are 1,684.40. So the correct answer would be G.

Alternatively, let me think about another approach. Some people start with the checkbook balance and adjust that. So checkbook is 1,685.75.

We know that the bank has a service charge of 1.35 that's not recorded, so we subtract that from the checkbook balance: 1,685.75 - 1.35 = 1,684.40.

Then, the bank's balance is 1,810.50, but the bank hasn't processed the checks totaling 126.10. So, the bank's balance would be 1,810.50 - 126.10 = 1,684.40.

So both methods lead to the same adjusted balance of 1,684.40.

Looking at the options, option G is $1,684.40, which matches.

To reconcile Mr. Blake's checking account, we start by comparing the bank statement balance and the checkbook balance, identifying and adjusting for any discrepancies.

1. **Bank Statement Balance**: The closing balance on the bank statement is **$1,810.50**.  
2. **Outstanding Checks**: Mr. Blake has written checks totaling **$126.10 ($60.80 + $40.30 + $25.00)** that have not yet been processed by the bank. These must be subtracted from the bank statement balance:  
   \[
   $1,810.50 - $126.10 = $1,684.40
   \]

3. **Checkbook Balance**: The checkbook shows a balance of **$1,685.75**.  
4. **Service Charge**: The bank has deducted a service charge of **$1.35** that has not been recorded in the checkbook. This must be subtracted from the checkbook balance:  
   \[
   $1,685.75 - $1.35 = $1,684.40
   \]

After adjusting both balances, the reconciled balance is **$1,684.40**. This matches option **G**.

**Answer: G**
