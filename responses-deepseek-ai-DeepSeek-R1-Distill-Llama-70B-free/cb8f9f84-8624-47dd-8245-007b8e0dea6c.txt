Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that members of the economy want to hold money balances equal to 5 weeks of expenditure. And all income is spent. I need to find the desired level of money balances when the aggregate income is $1,600 billion per annum. The options are A to J.

Hmm, I remember something about the quantity theory of money. Oh right, the equation MV = PT. But wait, I think there's a different approach here because it's about money demand based on income.

So, money demand (M) is usually a certain fraction of income. Since people want to hold money equal to a certain number of weeks of expenditure, I think I can model this as M = k * Y, where k is the fraction and Y is the income.

Wait, but the time factor is in weeks. The income given is annual, so I need to convert weeks into a fraction of a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, right? So if they hold money for 5 weeks, that's 5/52 of a year.

So k would be 5/52. Therefore, M = (5/52) * Y.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm getting this right. Money balances are held equal to 5 weeks of expenditure. Expenditure is the same as income here because it says all income is spent. So yes, Y is the annual income, so expenditure per week is Y/52 per week. So 5 weeks would be 5*(Y/52). Therefore, M = 5Y/52.

So plugging in Y as $1,600 billion, M would be (5 * 1600) / 52 billion.

Let me calculate that. 5 times 1600 is 8000. Divided by 52. Let's see, 8000 divided by 52. Hmm, 52 times 153 is 7956 (because 52*150=7800, 52*3=156; 7800+156=7956). So 8000-7956=44. So 44/52 is 0.846. So approximately 153.846 billion. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is $153,846 billion, which matches that. But wait, that's a lot. Let me double-check my approach.

Wait, the income is 1,600 billion per annum. So the weekly income is 1600 / 52. So 5 weeks' worth would be 5 * (1600/52). Let me compute that again.

1600 / 52 is approximately 30.769. Multiply by 5 gives 153.846 billion. So the money demand M is 153.846 billion. So the correct option would be A.

But let me look at the options again. Option A is $153,846 billion. Oh wait, that's 153.846 billion. So that matches. So I think the correct answer is A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The money demand is based on a fraction of income. So M = (5/52)*Y. Y is 1600, so yeah, 5/52 * 1600 = (5 *1600)/52 = 8000/52 = approx 153.846. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, the income is annual, and money demand is expressed in terms of income. But maybe I'm confusing it with the velocity of money. Oh wait, velocity is V = PY/M. But in this case, we're directly given the desired money balances as a fraction of income. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it as the money demand being k times Y, where k is 5 weeks. Since a year has 52 weeks, k =5/52. So M = (5/52)*Y. Y is 1600, so 5*1600=8000, divided by 52 is 153.846. So yes, that's option A.

I don't think any of the other options make sense. For example, option B is 307,692 which is double that. Option C is 10,400, which is much less. Option D is 5,000, which is way less. Option E is 80,000, which is higher. Option F is 160,000, that's the income itself. G is about 123, which is lower. H is 200,000. I is 30,769, which is the weekly income. J is the total income. So yeah, A seems correct.

To determine the desired level of money balances when aggregate income is $1,600 billion per annum, we start by noting that money demand (M) is proportional to income (Y). Specifically, the problem states that money balances are held equal to 5 weeks of expenditure. Since all income is spent, expenditure equals income.

First, we convert the 5-week money demand into a fraction of annual income. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the fraction is:

\[
k = \frac{5}{52}
\]

The relationship between money demand and income is given by:

\[
M = k \cdot Y
\]

Substituting \( k = \frac{5}{52} \) and \( Y = \$1,600 \, \text{billion} \):

\[
M = \frac{5}{52} \cdot 1,600
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
M = \frac{5 \cdot 1,600}{52} = \frac{8,000}{52} \approx 153.846 \, \text{billion}
\]

Thus, the desired level of money balances is approximately \$153,846 billion. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: $153,846 billion**

Other options are inconsistent with the calculation. For example:
- Option B (\$307,692 billion) is double the correct value.
- Option C (\$10,400 billion) is far too low.
- Option D (\$5,000 billion) is also far too low.
- Option E (\$80,000 billion) and Option F (\$160,000 billion) are much higher than the calculated value.
- Option G (\$123,077 billion) is close but does not match the precise calculation.
- Option H (\$200,000 billion) is significantly higher.
- Option I (\$30,769 billion) represents weekly income, not the desired money balances.
- Option J (\$1,600 billion) equals the total annual income, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: $153,846 billion**
