Alright, so I'm trying to solve this logic problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about determining which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:

1. (A ∨ B) ⊃ (C ∨ D)
2. A ∨ B
3. ~C

And we have options from A to I. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

First, I remember that an immediate consequence means that the conclusion follows directly from the premises without any intermediate steps. So I need to see which of the options can be derived directly using the rules of inference like modus ponens, modus tollens, disjunctive syllogism, etc.

Let me write down the premises again:

1. (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D)
2. A ∨ B
3. ~C

I think the first step is to see if we can apply any rule of inference here. Let's look at premise 1 and 2. Premise 1 is a conditional statement, and premise 2 is the antecedent of that conditional. So if we have the form P → Q and we have P, then by modus ponens, we can conclude Q.

So applying modus ponens to premises 1 and 2, we get:

C ∨ D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is C ∨ D. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions yet because we also have premise 3, which is ~C.

So now, from C ∨ D and ~C, what can we infer? Oh, right! Disjunctive syllogism. If we have (C ∨ D) and ~C, then we can conclude D. Because in a disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see D as an option. Wait, option D is D ∨ ~C, which is something else. Hmm. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, let's list the options again:

A: C ∨ D
B: (A ∨ B) ⊃ ~D
C: (A ∨ B) ⊃ ~~C
D: D ∨ ~C
E: ~~D
F: ~A ∨ ~B
G: B ∨ ~A
H: ~D ∨ C
I: ~~C

So if from premises 1 and 2, we get C ∨ D (option A), and then with premise 3 (~C), we can infer D via disjunctive syllogism. So the conclusion would be D.

But D is not directly one of the options. Wait, option D is D ∨ ~C, which isn't exactly D. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again. The question asks for an immediate consequence, so perhaps it's not necessary to go two steps. Let's see.

From premises 1 and 2, we get C ∨ D (option A). But in the presence of premise 3 (~C), maybe we can combine them. Alternatively, perhaps we can use another approach.

Wait, another thought: since we have (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D) and A ∨ B is true, then C ∨ D must be true. But we also have ~C, which means C is false. So in C ∨ D, since C is false, D must be true. So D is true.

But none of the options directly state D. The closest is option D, which is D ∨ ~C. But wait, if D is true, then D ∨ ~C is also true because D is true. So maybe option D is a consequence. But is it an immediate consequence?

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option I is ~~C. Well, since ~C is a premise, ~~C would be equivalent to C, which isn't necessarily true. So that's not it.

Option E is ~~D. If D is true, then ~~D is also true, but again, that's two steps away.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since from premises 1 and 2, we get C ∨ D (option A). But with premise 3, ~C, we can conclude D, which makes D true. So maybe the immediate consequence is C ∨ D, which is option A. But wait, the question includes all three premises, so perhaps C ∨ D isn't the only step.

Wait, no. The immediate consequence would be from all three premises together. So perhaps using modus ponens on the first two gives C ∨ D, and then applying modus tollens or disjunctive syllogism with ~C.

Wait, disjunctive syllogism says that if we have (C ∨ D) and ~C, then we can infer D. So the immediate consequence would be D. But none of the options directly state D. However, looking at the options, option D is D ∨ ~C, which is a bit different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about contrapositive or other rules. Wait, another approach: using resolution.

From (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D), which is equivalent to ~ (A ∨ B) ∨ (C ∨ D). But that's probably not helpful here.

Wait, maybe I should consider the logical equivalences. Let me try to write down the premises together.

Premise 1: (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D)
Premise 2: A ∨ B
Premise 3: ~C

From 1 and 2, we get C ∨ D (modus ponens). Then, from C ∨ D and ~C, we get D (disjunctive syllogism). So D is a conclusion.

Looking at the options, I don't see D, but option D is D ∨ ~C. Wait, but if D is true, then D ∨ ~C is also true because D is true. So maybe option D is a consequence. But is it an immediate consequence?

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option I is ~~C. Since we have ~C as a premise, then ~~C is equivalent to C, which isn't necessarily true, so that's not it.

Option H is ~D ∨ C. But that's the same as C ∨ ~D, which is the contrapositive of D → C. Not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, another angle: from C ∨ D and ~C, we can conclude D. So D is true. Now, looking at the options, which ones are true if D is true.

Option D: D ∨ ~C. Well, since D is true, D ∨ ~C is true. So that's a valid conclusion. But is that an immediate consequence? Or is it just a tautology?

Alternatively, perhaps the immediate consequence is D, but it's not listed, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. The options are:

A: C ∨ D (which we get from 1 and 2)
D: D ∨ ~C
E: ~~D (which is equivalent to D)
F: ~A ∨ ~B
G: B ∨ ~A
H: ~D ∨ C
I: ~~C (equivalent to C)

Wait, if D is true, then E (~~D) is equivalent to D, so E would be true. But is E an immediate consequence?

Alternatively, perhaps the immediate consequence is D, but since it's not an option, maybe E is the answer because D being true makes ~~D true. But that's an extra step.

Wait, but the question is about an immediate consequence. So perhaps the immediate step is from the premises to D ∨ ~C (option D). Let me think about that.

Wait, maybe combining the premises differently. Let me try to use all three premises together.

We have (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D) as premise 1. We have A ∨ B as premise 2, so from 1 and 2, we get C ∨ D. Then, with ~C (premise 3), we can infer D. So the immediate consequence from all three premises would be D. But D isn't an option. However, D ∨ ~C is option D. Wait, but D ∨ ~C is a tautology if D is true, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using hypothetical syllogism or another rule. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option and see if it can be derived.

Option A: C ∨ D. Yes, from 1 and 2 via modus ponens. But we also have ~C, so perhaps that's not the immediate consequence considering all premises.

Option D: D ∨ ~C. Well, if D is true, then D ∨ ~C is true. But how does that relate to the premises? Or perhaps, from C ∨ D (from 1 and 2) and ~C, we can get D, which makes D true, so D ∨ ~C is true because D is true. So that's a valid conclusion.

Wait, but is D ∨ ~C an immediate consequence? Because from C ∨ D and ~C, we get D, which implies D ∨ ~C. But perhaps that's an extra step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that from C ∨ D and ~C, we can apply disjunctive syllogism to get D. So D is the immediate consequence, but since it's not an option, maybe the answer is E: ~~D, which is equivalent to D. But that's not an immediate consequence of the premises; it's a transformation.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the options again. Option I is ~~C, which is equivalent to C, but we have ~C as a premise, so that can't be concluded.

Option F: ~A ∨ ~B. Wait, that's the negation of A ∨ B. But premise 2 is A ∨ B, so ~A ∨ ~B would be the opposite. So that can't be concluded.

Option G: B ∨ ~A. That's equivalent to A → B. Not sure how that follows.

Option H: ~D ∨ C. That's the same as C ∨ ~D. But from the premises, we have C ∨ D, and ~C, leading to D. So C ∨ ~D would be C ∨ (D → something). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the rules of inference on all three premises together.

We have (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D) [premise 1]
A ∨ B [premise 2]
~C [premise 3]

From 1 and 2, we get C ∨ D (modus ponens). Then, from C ∨ D and ~C, we get D (disjunctive syllogism). So D is the conclusion.

But looking at the options, D isn't present. So perhaps the answer is E: ~~D, which is equivalent to D. But is that an immediate consequence? Or is it considered an immediate consequence because it's logically equivalent?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me check again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the answer is D: D ∨ ~C. Because D ∨ ~C is equivalent to C → D (contrapositive). But from the premises, we have C ∨ D and ~C, so C ∨ D is true, and ~C is true. So in that case, D must be true, making D ∨ ~C true because D is true. But I'm not sure if that's an immediate step.

Alternatively, perhaps the immediate consequence is D, but since that's not an option, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, looking back at the options, option H is ~D ∨ C, which is equivalent to C ∨ ~D. But from the premises, we have C ∨ D and ~C, which leads to D. So C ∨ ~D would be true if C is true or D is false. But since we have D as true, ~D is false, so C ∨ ~D would be equivalent to C, which we don't know. So that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that from C ∨ D and ~C, we can use resolution to get D. So D is the conclusion. But since D isn't an option, maybe the answer is E: ~~D, because D is true, so ~~D is true. But that's a double negation, which is a valid equivalence, but is it considered an immediate consequence?

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option D is D ∨ ~C. Since we've derived D, D ∨ ~C is true because D is true. So option D is a valid conclusion, but is it an immediate consequence?

Wait, maybe the answer is A: C ∨ D, but that's only from the first two premises. The third premise allows us to go further to D, but A is still a consequence. So perhaps A is also a correct answer, but since the question includes all three premises, maybe the answer is D or E.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to outline the steps clearly.

1. From premise 1 and 2: (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D) and A ∨ B, so by modus ponens, we get C ∨ D.

2. Now, with C ∨ D and premise 3 (~C), we can apply disjunctive syllogism to conclude D.

So the immediate consequence is D.

But looking at the options, D isn't directly listed. The options are A through I, with D being option D: D ∨ ~C.

Wait, but if D is true, then D ∨ ~C is also true. So maybe option D is a correct conclusion, but it's not as direct as D itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: ~~D, because D is true, so ~~D is equivalent to D. But again, that's a double negation, which is a separate step.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D: D ∨ ~C. Because from C ∨ D (from 1 and 2) and ~C, we can infer D ∨ ~C. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if we have C ∨ D and ~C, we can conclude D, which makes D ∨ ~C true because D is true. But I'm not sure if that's the immediate step.

Alternatively, perhaps the immediate consequence is C ∨ D (option A), and then from there, considering ~C, we get D. But the question is asking for an immediate consequence of all three premises. So perhaps the immediate consequence is D, but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is E: ~~D.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Perhaps I should consider each option and see if it can be derived directly.

Option D: D ∨ ~C.

Do the premises imply D ∨ ~C? Well, yes, because from the premises, we can derive D, and if D is true, then D ∨ ~C is true. So D ∨ ~C must be true.

So option D is a consequence. But is it an immediate consequence? Because D ∨ ~C is logically equivalent to C → D, which is the contrapositive of D → C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option I: ~~C. But since ~C is a premise, ~~C is C, which isn't necessarily true, so that can't be concluded.

Option E: ~~D. Since we can conclude D, then ~~D is equivalent to D, which is true. But is that an immediate consequence? Or is it a derived equivalence?

Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. But I think the most direct conclusion is D, which isn't an option, so perhaps the answer is option D: D ∨ ~C, because that's a disjunction that includes D, which we've concluded. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the resolution rule. Let's write the premises in conjunctive normal form.

Premise 1: (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D) is equivalent to ~A ∧ ~B ∨ C ∨ D.

But that's getting complicated. Maybe I should stick with the steps I took earlier.

So, to recap:

1. From premises 1 and 2: C ∨ D.
2. From C ∨ D and premise 3 (~C): D.

So D is the conclusion. Since D isn't an option, but option D is D ∨ ~C, which is true because D is true, perhaps option D is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E: ~~D, since D is true, but that's a double negation, which is an equivalence, not an immediate inference.

Wait, but the question asks for an immediate consequence, so perhaps the correct answer is option D: D ∨ ~C. Because from C ∨ D and ~C, we can infer D, which makes D ∨ ~C true.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the immediate consequence is D, but since that's not an option, the next best thing is option D.

Wait, but looking back, option D is D ∨ ~C, which is a tautology if D is true, regardless of C. So maybe that's acceptable.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option D: D ∨ ~C.

To determine the immediate consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL), we analyze the premises and apply rules of inference:

1. **Premises**:
   - (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D)  (Premise 1)
   - A ∨ B        (Premise 2)
   - ~C         (Premise 3)

2. **Step 1**: Apply **Modus Ponens** to Premise 1 and Premise 2:
   - From (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D) and A ∨ B, we derive **C ∨ D**.

3. **Step 2**: Apply **Disjunctive Syllogism** to **C ∨ D** (from Step 1) and ~C (Premise 3):
   - Since ~C is true, C must be false. Therefore, D must be true.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (C ∨ D)**: This is derived from Premises 1 and 2 but does not account for Premise 3 (~C). While correct, it is not the most specific immediate consequence.
   - **Option D (D ∨ ~C)**: Since D is true (from Step 2), D ∨ ~C is also true. This is a valid consequence of the premises.
   - Other options (B, C, E, F, G, H, I) are either incorrect or not directly supported by the premises.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The immediate consequence of all three premises is **D
