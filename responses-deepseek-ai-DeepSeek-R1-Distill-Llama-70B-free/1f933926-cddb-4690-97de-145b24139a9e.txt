Okay, so I've got this problem here about a glucose globule dissolving in water, and I need to find the mass transfer coefficient. Hmm, mass transfer coefficient... I remember that it's related to things like diffusion and the flow of the fluid. Let's see.

The problem states that the globule is spherical with a diameter of 1/8 inch. I should probably convert that into centimeters because the diffusivity is given in cm²/sec. Oh wait, right, 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so 1/8 inch is 0.125 inches. Let me calculate that: 0.125 * 2.54 cm. So 0.125 * 2.54 is... 0.125 times 2 is 0.25, and 0.125 times 0.54 is about 0.0675, so total is 0.3175 cm. Wait, no, wait. 0.125 inches * 2.54 cm/inch. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.125 * 2.54: 2.54 * 1/8. So 2.54 divided by 8. 2 divided by 8 is 0.25, and 0.54 divided by 8 is 0.0675. So yeah, 0.3175 cm. So the diameter is 0.3175 cm, so the radius is half of that, 0.15875 cm.

The water is flowing at 0.6 ft/sec. Wait, but the units for the mass transfer coefficient are in ft/hr, so I might need to convert that velocity into cm/sec or something else. Or maybe I should work in consistent units. Let's think.

The temperature is 25°C, which I don't think affects the calculation here beyond the given diffusivity. The diffusivity D is 4.14e-3 cm²/sec.

I'm trying to remember the formula for the mass transfer coefficient. Oh right, for a sphere in a flowing fluid, the Sherwood number (Sh) is used. The Sherwood number relates the mass transfer coefficient (k) to the diffusivity and the characteristic length, which is the diameter here.

The formula is Sh = (k * d)/D. So solving for k gives k = (Sh * D)/d.

But wait, how do I find the Sherwood number? I think for a sphere in a flowing fluid, the Sherwood number can be approximated using an empirical correlation. One common correlation for a sphere is Sh = 2 + 0.5695 * (Re)^0.5 * (Sc)^0.33, where Re is the Reynolds number and Sc is the Schmidt number.

So I need to calculate Re and Sc first. Let's figure out the properties.

Reynolds number Re is (velocity * diameter) / kinematic viscosity. But wait, I need the kinematic viscosity of water at 25°C. I remember that the viscosity of water at 25°C is about 0.001 kg/(m·s), but let me get the exact value. Wait, no, kinematic viscosity ν is viscosity μ divided by density ρ. For water, μ is 0.000891 kg/(m·s) at 25°C, and density ρ is about 997 kg/m³. So ν = μ/ρ = 0.000891 / 997 ≈ 8.94e-7 m²/s. Wait, converting to cm²/s because I'm using cm units. Since 1 m² is 1e4 cm², so 8.94e-7 m²/s is 8.94e-7 * 1e4 cm²/s = 8.94e-3 cm²/s.

Wait, or wait: 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 10^4 cm². So 1 m²/s is 1e4 cm²/s. So ν in m²/s is 8.94e-7. To convert to cm²/s, multiply by 1e4: 8.94e-7 * 1e4 = 8.94e-3 cm²/s.

Now, the velocity is given in ft/s, and the diameter is in cm. I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's convert the velocity from ft/s to cm/s.

1 ft = 30.48 cm. So 0.6 ft/s is 0.6 * 30.48 cm/s. Let me calculate that. 0.6 * 30 is 18, 0.6 * 0.48 is 0.288, so total is 18.288 cm/s.

So velocity u = 18.288 cm/s, diameter d = 0.3175 cm.

Reynolds number Re = (u * d) / ν = (18.288 cm/s * 0.3175 cm) / (8.94e-3 cm²/s).

Calculating numerator: 18.288 * 0.3175. Let me compute that. 18 * 0.3 is 5.4, 0.288 * 0.3 is 0.0864, 18 * 0.0175 is 0.315, 0.288 * 0.0175 is about 0.00504. Adding up roughly: 5.4 + 0.0864 + 0.315 + 0.00504 ≈ 5.806. So approximately 5.806 cm²/s.

Then Re = 5.806 / 8.94e-3 ≈ 5.806 / 0.00894 ≈ let's compute 5.806 / 0.00894. Let me do this division: 5.806 / 0.00894 ≈ 650. Let me compute 0.00894 * 650 = 5.809, which is very close to 5.806. So Re ≈ 650.

Now, the Schmidt number Sc is the kinematic viscosity divided by the diffusivity. So Sc = ν / D.

ν is 8.94e-3 cm²/s, D is 4.14e-3 cm²/s. So Sc = (8.94e-3) / (4.14e-3) ≈ 2.158.

Now, plug into the Sherwood number equation: Sh = 2 + 0.5695*(Re^0.5)*(Sc^0.333).

Compute Re^0.5 first: sqrt(650) ≈ 25.495.

Sc^0.333: which is the cube root of Sc. Sc is about 2.158. Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 2.158 is maybe around 1.3. Let me compute it more accurately.

So 1.3^3 = 2.197, which is slightly higher than 2.158. Let's try 1.29: 1.29^3 = (1.3 - 0.01)^3. Let's compute 1.3^3 is 2.197, minus 3*(1.3)^2*0.01 = 3*(1.69)*0.01 = 0.0507, plus 3*(1.3)*(0.01)^2 = 0.0039, minus (0.01)^3 = 0.000001. So 2.197 - 0.0507 = 2.1463, plus 0.0039 is 2.1502, minus 0.000001 is ~2.1502. So 1.29^3 ≈ 2.1502, which is a bit lower than 2.158. Hmm, so perhaps 1.291^3? Let me approximate. Let's accept that it's approximately 1.29 or so. Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms for a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 2.158^(1/3). Let me take natural logs: ln(2.158) ≈ 0.772. Divide by 3: 0.2573. Exponentiate: e^0.2573 ≈ 1.293. So approximately 1.293.

So Sc^0.333 ≈ 1.293.

Now, putting it together: Sh = 2 + 0.5695 * 25.495 * 1.293.

Compute 25.495 * 1.293 first. Let's compute 25 * 1.293 = 32.325, 0.495 *1.293≈ approx 0.495*1=0.495, 0.495*0.293≈0.144. So total is 0.639. So total is 32.325 + 0.639 ≈ 32.964.

Then multiply by 0.5695: 32.964 * 0.5695 ≈ Let's compute 32 * 0.5695 = 18.224, 0.964 *0.5695 ≈ approx 0.55. So total approx 18.224 + 0.55 = 18.774. So Sh ≈ 2 + 18.774 = 20.774.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 25.495 *1.293 first.

25.495 * 1.293:

25 *1.293 =32.325

0.495 *1.293: 0.4*1.293=0.5172; 0.09*1.293≈0.11637; 0.005*1.293=0.006465. Sum: 0.5172 + 0.11637=0.63357 +0.006465=0.640035. So total 32.325 + 0.640035 =32.965035.

Now, 32.965035 * 0.5695:

Compute 32 *0.5695= 18.224

0.965035 *0.5695 ≈ Let's compute 0.9 *0.5695=0.51255; 0.06 *0.5695=0.03417; 0.005035 *0.5695≈0.002868. Sum: 0.51255 +0.03417=0.54672 +0.002868≈0.549588. So total: 18.224 + 0.549588 ≈18.7736.

So Sh = 2 + 18.7736 ≈20.7736.

Now, using Sh = (k * d)/D, so k = (Sh * D)/d.

Sh is 20.7736, D is 4.14e-3 cm²/s, d is 0.3175 cm.

So compute numerator: 20.7736 *4.14e-3 = ?

20 *4.14e-3 = 0.0828.

0.7736 *4.14e-3: 0.7 *4.14e-3 = 0.002898, 0.0736 *4.14e-3≈0.000305. So total 0.002898 +0.000305=0.003203. So total numerator is 0.0828 +0.003203=0.086003 cm/s.

Now divide by d=0.3175 cm: 0.086003 /0.3175 ≈0.2707 cm/s.

So k is approximately 0.2707 cm/s.

But wait, the answer needs to be in ft/hr. So I need to convert cm/s to ft/hr.

First, convert cm/s to ft/s: 1 cm = 0.0328084 ft. So 0.2707 cm/s = 0.2707 * 0.0328084 ft/s.

0.2707 *0.0328084 ≈ Let's compute 0.27 *0.0328=0.008856. 0.0007 *0.0328≈0.00002296. So total≈0.008856 + 0.00002296≈0.008879 ft/s.

Now, convert ft/s to ft/hr: multiply by 3600 seconds per hour.

0.008879 ft/s * 3600 s/hr = 31.963 ft/hr.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 0.008879 *3600:

0.008879 *3600 = 0.008879 * 3.6e3 = (0.008 *3.6e3) + (0.000879 *3.6e3).

0.008 *3600 =28.8.

0.000879 *3600 = 3.1644.

So total is 28.8 +3.1644=31.9644 ft/hr.

Hmm, so approximately 32.0 ft/hr.

Looking at the options: the options are A:25.468, B:29.954, C:28.763, D:22.567, E:55.123, F:50.342, G:33.468, H:40.332, I:45.789, J:37.215.

Wait, my calculation gives 31.96, which is roughly 32. Closest to option G:33.468, but perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the steps because 32 isn't among the options, but maybe I miscalculated somewhere.

Let me recheck the flow:

- Calculated diameter correctly: 1/8 inch is 0.3175 cm.
- Velocity in cm/s: 0.6 ft/s is 18.288 cm/s. Correct.
- Reynolds number: (18.288 * 0.3175) / 8.94e-3 = numerator 5.806, divided by 0.00894 gives Re≈650. Correct.
- Sc: ν/D = (8.94e-3)/(4.14e-3)≈2.158. Correct.
- Sh=2 +0.5695*(650^0.5)*(2.158^0.333). 650^0.5≈25.495, 2.158^0.333≈1.293. 25.495*1.293≈32.965. 32.965*0.5695≈18.773. Sh=20.773. Correct.
- k = (Sh*D)/d = (20.773 *4.14e-3)/0.3175. 20.773 *4.14e-3≈0.086, divided by 0.3175 gives 0.2707 cm/s. Correct.
- Conversion steps: 0.2707 cm/s to ft/hr: 0.2707 cm/s = 0.008879 ft/s. 0.008879 *3600=31.96 ft/hr.

Hmm, 31.96 is close to 32, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Sherwood number equation.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should use a different correlation for the Sherwood number. Another common one is Sh = 0.4 Re^(1/2) Sc^(1/3), but I think that's for very low Reynolds numbers. Or maybe Sh = 2 + 0.4 Re^(1/2) Sc^(1/3) for 1 < Re < 400.

Wait, perhaps the correct correlation for a sphere is Sh = 0.4 Re^0.5 Sc^0.333 for Pe >> 1, or something else. Alternatively, maybe I forgot a factor. Let me check.

Wait, another possible correlation for mass transfer around a sphere is the Frossling equation: Sh = 2 + 0.552 Re^{0.5} Sc^{1/3}.

Oh, wait, maybe I used the wrong coefficient. Earlier, I used 0.5695, but perhaps it's 0.552 as in the Frossling equation.

Let me recalculate Sh with 0.552 instead of 0.5695.

So Sh = 2 + 0.552 * Re^0.5 * Sc^0.333.

Re^0.5 is 25.495, Sc^0.333 is 1.293.

So 25.495 * 1.293 = 32.965, same as before.

32.965 * 0.552 = ?

Compute 32 *0.552 =17.664

0.965 *0.552 ≈0.532.

So total 17.664 +0.532=18.196.

So Sh=2 +18.196=20.196.

Then k=(20.196 *4.14e-3)/0.3175.

20.196 *4.14e-3= 0.0836 cm/s.

Divide by 0.3175 cm: 0.0836 /0.3175≈0.2635 cm/s.

Converting to ft/hr: 0.2635 cm/s = 0.2635 *0.0328084 ft/s ≈0.00864 ft/s.

Multiply by 3600: 0.00864 *3600≈31.104 ft/hr.

Hmm, that's about 31.1, which is still not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption of the correlation.

Wait, perhaps the correct correlation is Sh = 2 + 0.4 Re^{0.5} Sc^{0.333}.

Let me try that.

Sh = 2 + 0.4 *25.495 *1.293.

0.4 *25.495=10.198.

10.198 *1.293≈13.185.

So Sh=2 +13.185=15.185.

Then k= (15.185 *4.14e-3)/0.3175.

15.185 *4.14e-3≈0.0629 cm/s.

Convert to ft/hr: 0.0629 cm/s *0.0328084 ft/cm/s=0.002063 ft/s.

0.002063 *3600≈7.434 ft/hr. That's way too low, so that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I need to check the correct correlation for the Sherwood number for a sphere in a flowing fluid. Let me think. I think the Frossling equation is correct, which is Sh = 2 + 0.552 Re^{0.5} Sc^{1/3}.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exponents again. Sh = 2 + 0.552*(Re)^0.5*(Sc)^(1/3).

Yes, that's correct. So maybe I should stick with that. But then I get Sh=20.196, which gives k≈0.2635 cm/s, which
