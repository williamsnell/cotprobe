Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about a proton moving into a magnetic field. The proton has an initial speed of 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. The magnetic field B is 1.0 T. The angle between the proton's velocity and the magnetic field is 30 degrees. And the question is asking for the proton's speed after 4 seconds. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when a charged particle enters a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. This is the Lorentz force. The formula for the magnetic force is F = q(v × B). Since the force is perpendicular to the velocity, it changes the direction of the velocity but not the speed itself. Oh wait, right! Because the force does no work on the particle, the speed remains constant. So the kinetic energy doesn't change because the magnetic field does no work.

Wait, but wait. That's in the case where the magnetic field is uniform and the particle is moving with a velocity that's not aligned with the field. The particle moves in a circular path, right? So its speed is constant, but the velocity (which is a vector) changes direction.

So in this problem, the speed of the proton should stay the same because the magnetic field doesn't change its speed, only the direction. So the answer should be the same as the initial speed, 1.5 × 10^6 m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is exactly that. Let me just make sure I'm not missing anything else.

Wait, wait a second. Could there be any other factors? Like, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking about acceleration or something else. Let me think: The magnetic force provides a centripetal force, causing circular motion. The speed doesn't change because the force is perpendicular. So the proton's speed after 4 seconds is the same as when it entered.

So yeah, I think the answer is A.

The problem involves a proton moving into a uniform magnetic field with an initial speed of \(1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}\). The magnetic field has a magnitude of \(1.0 \, \text{T}\), and the proton's velocity makes an angle of \(30^\circ\) with the field. The task is to determine the proton's speed after 4 seconds.

When a charged particle enters a magnetic field, it experiences a Lorentz force, which is perpendicular to both the particle's velocity and the magnetic field. This force causes the particle to move in a circular path, changing the direction of its velocity but not its speed. Since the magnetic force does no work on the particle, the speed remains constant over time.

Thus, the proton's speed after 4 seconds is the same as its initial speed, \(1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}\). Among the given options, this corresponds to option A.

**Answer:** A
