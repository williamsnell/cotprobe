Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about personnel selection methods and their predictive validity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the options has the highest predictive validity. Predictive validity, as I remember, refers to how well a selection method predicts future job performance. So the method with the highest validity would be the one that best forecasts how well someone will do the job.

Looking at the options:

A: Projective technique. I think those are like psychological tests where you interpret ambiguous stimuli, like inkblot tests. I don't think these are very objective or have strong validity in predicting job performance.

B: Skills test. This sounds like it's testing specific skills relevant to the job. For example, if someone is applying for a programming job, a coding test would be a skills test. That makes sense because it directly assesses ability.

C: Reference check. Checking references can give information about past performance, but I've heard that references can be biased or not very informative. So maybe not the highest validity.

D: Job sample test. This is where the applicant does a simulation of the job tasks. Like, if you're hiring a customer service rep, they might role-play a customer interaction. This seems very relevant because it shows how they handle actual job tasks.

E: Objective personality inventory. These are standardized tests measuring personality traits. I recall that personality tests have lower validity compared to more direct methods. The Big Five might be useful, but maybe not the best predictor.

F: Self-assessment survey. This is where applicants rate their own skills and abilities. I remember that self-assessments can be unreliable because people might overestimate or underestimate themselves.

G: Group interview. This involves interviewing with a group, maybe including some teamwork exercises. I'm not sure how much this correlates with job performance. It might assess teamwork skills but not necessarily overall job success.

H: Biographical inventory. This is like a life history questionnaire. It asks about past experiences and might predict future behavior based on that. I think these can have decent validity, maybe higher than some other methods.

I: Interview by the personnel manager. Interviews are commonly used, but their validity can vary. Unstructured interviews might not be as reliable, but structured ones are better. However, compared to job samples or skills tests, they might not be as strong.

So, considering these, the highest predictive validity is likely between options B, D, H, and maybe I. Wait, I think job sample tests and skills tests are often cited as having high validity because they directly assess the ability to perform job tasks. Between B and D, I'm a bit confused. Are they similar?

Wait, another thought: Skills tests and job sample tests might sometimes overlap. For example, a skills test for a writer might be writing a sample, which is a job sample. So perhaps D is a type of skills test, but more specifically tailored to the job.

From what I remember, job sample tests have high predictive validity because they show how well a candidate can perform the actual work. Similarly, skills tests are also good. But I think job sample tests might edge out skills tests because they're more directly related to the job. Or maybe they're similar in validity.

Alternatively, I've read that general mental ability tests (like cognitive ability) have high validity, but that's not one of the options here. So among the options given, job sample tests (D) are probably the best.

Wait, another point: Reference checks (C) are considered to have lower validity because they're often biased or not reliable. Projective techniques (A) are more for personality and less about job performance. Personality inventories (E) have lower validity compared to job-related tests.

So putting it all together, the highest predictive validity would be the job sample test (D), followed by skills tests (B). Wait, but sometimes job sample tests are considered a form of skills test. Hmm.

Wait, I think the job sample test is more specific and has higher validity than a general skills test. For example, a job sample test for a sales position might involve role-playing a sales pitch, which directly relates to the job. A skills test might be more about general abilities, like typing speed or software proficiency, which are important but maybe not as directly tied to the specific job behaviors as a job sample.

Therefore, D (job sample test) probably has the highest predictive validity.

The question asks which personnel selection method has the highest predictive validity, which refers to how well a method forecasts future job performance. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **A: Projective technique** – These are psychological tests (e.g., inkblot tests) that are subjective and not strongly linked to job performance, so validity is low.  
- **B: Skills test** – Tests specific skills relevant to the job (e.g., coding tests for programmers). While highly relevant, they may not always capture the full scope of job requirements.  
- **C: Reference check** – Provides information about past performance but can be biased or uninformative, limiting its validity.  
- **D: Job sample test** – Involves simulations of actual job tasks (e.g., role-playing customer interactions for customer service roles). This method directly assesses job-related abilities and is highly predictive of performance.  
- **E: Objective personality inventory** – Measures personality traits but has lower validity compared to direct assessments of job-specific skills.  
- **F: Self-assessment survey** – Relies on applicants' self-ratings, which can be unreliable due to biases or inaccuracies.  
- **G: Group interview** – Assesses teamwork skills but may not strongly predict overall job success.  
- **H: Biographical inventory** – Examines past experiences to predict future behavior, with decent validity but not as high as job-specific tests.  
- **I: Interview by the personnel manager** – Validity varies; unstructured interviews are less reliable, while structured ones are better but still may not match the validity of job samples.  

Among these, **job sample tests (D)** stand out as having the highest predictive validity because they directly simulate job tasks and assess how well candidates can perform the actual work. While skills tests (B) are also strong, job sample tests are more specific to the job and thus have an edge in validity.

**Answer: D**
