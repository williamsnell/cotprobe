Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer from a flat plate cooled by forced convection of air. Hmm, I need to find the heat flow per unit time and area and the local heat transfer coefficient. Alright, where do I start?

Let me read the problem again. The plate is cooled by air flowing at 33 ft/s. The air is at 68°F and 1 atm. The plate has different temperature regions: 0-2 inches at 122°F, 2-3.2 inches at 176°F, and 3.2-4.75 inches at 212°F. The point of interest is 4 inches from the leading edge. Wait, so 4 inches is within the third region, which is 3.2 to 4.75 inches, right? So the temperature at 4 inches is 212°F.

Wait, but in convection problems, the heat transfer is usually calculated using Newton's Law of Cooling, which is q = h * A * (T_s - T_fluid). Oh wait, but here we need the heat flux, which is per unit area, so q'' = h * (T_s - T_fluid). So I need to find h, the heat transfer coefficient.

For forced convection over a flat plate, the local heat transfer coefficient depends on the Reynolds number and Prandtl number. The formula for h is (k_air / x) * Nu, where Nu is the Nusselt number. And for a laminar flow over a flat plate, I think the formula is Nu = 0.332 * Re^0.5 * Pr^(1/3), assuming Pr is moderate and Re is less than about 500,000.

Wait, but first I need to calculate the Reynolds number at x = 4 inches. Reynolds number Re is (v * x) / ν, where v is the velocity, x is the length, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the air.

But wait, all the units need to be consistent. The velocity is given in ft/s, so I need to convert x from inches to feet. 4 inches is 4/12 = 0.3333 ft.

Now, I need the kinematic viscosity of air at the given conditions. The temperature is 68°F, which is about 20°C. I think at 20°C, the kinematic viscosity ν_air is approximately 0.000015 ft²/s. Wait, I should double-check that. Alternatively, I can look up the dynamic viscosity and then calculate kinematic using density.

Wait, maybe more accurately: at 68°F (20°C), the dynamic viscosity μ_air is about 1.204e-5 lb-sec/ft². The density ρ_air at 1 atm and 68°F... Let me think. At standard conditions, 1 atm and 60°F, ρ_air is about 0.076 lbm/ft³. Wait, but wait, 68°F is a little warmer, so the density would be slightly lower. Alternatively, using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But maybe for simplicity, I can approximate ρ_air as roughly 0.072 lbm/ft³ at 68°F and 1 atm. Hmm, wait, let me think in terms of units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find ν_air = μ_air / ρ_air. So if μ_air is 1.204e-5 lb-sec/ft², and ρ_air is about 0.076 lbm/ft³, then ν = (1.204e-5) / 0.076. Let's calculate that.

1.204e-5 divided by 0.076 equals approximately 1.584e-4 ft²/s. Wait, but wait, I might be mixing units here. Let me make sure. The units for μ are lb-sec/ft², density is lbm/ft³. So ν has units (lb-sec/ft²) / (lbm/ft³) ) = (lb sec ft³) / (ft² lbm) ) Hmm, perhaps I should convert to consistent units. Alternatively, I might remember that at 20°C, ν_air is about 1.5e-5 m²/s. Converting to ft²/s, since 1 m² = approx 10.7639 ft², so 1.5e-5 m²/s is 1.5e-5 * 10.7639 ≈ 1.6145e-4 ft²/s. So maybe ν_air is around 1.6e-4 ft²/s.

Wait, but earlier I got 1.584e-4 from the μ and ρ calculation, which aligns with this. So let's take ν_air as approximately 1.6e-4 ft²/s.

Now, Re = (v * x) / ν. v is 33 ft/s, x is 0.3333 ft. So Re = (33 * 0.3333) / (1.6e-4) Let's compute that.

33 * 0.3333 is approximately 11. So Re ≈ 11 / 1.6e-4 = 11 / 0.00016. Let me compute that. 11 / 0.00016 = 68,750. So Re is about 68,750. Wait, but wait, 33 ft/s is a high speed! Because 1 ft/s is about 0.68 mph, so 33 ft/s is about 22.5 mph. So the Re is 68,750, which is less than the critical Re of about 500,000, so the flow is laminar over the plate up to that point.

So now, the Nusselt number Nu = 0.332 * Re^0.5 * Pr^(1/3). I need Pr for air at 68°F. Pr for air is around 0.7 (since at room temp, it's about 0.7). Let me confirm: yes, Pr for air is approximately 0.707.

So Nu = 0.332 * (68,750)^0.5 * (0.707)^(1/3). Let's compute each part.

First, sqrt(68750) is sqrt(6.875e4) = sqrt(6.875)*100. sqrt(6.875) is approximately 2.621, so sqrt(68750) ≈ 262.1.

So 0.332 * 262.1 = approx 0.332 * 260 = 86.52, plus 0.332*2.1≈0.697, total around 87.22.

Now, (0.707)^(1/3). Let me compute that. 0.707 is about the cube of 0.89, since 0.89^3 is approx 0.704. So (0.707)^(1/3) ≈ 0.89.

So Nu ≈ 87.22 * 0.89 ≈ 77.74.

Now, h = (k_air / x) * Nu. I need k_air, the thermal conductivity of air at 68°F. I think k_air is about 0.0173 W/m·K, but let me convert that to Btu units.

Wait, thermal conductivity in English units: 1 W/m·K is approximately 0.5778 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, no, let me think. Let me get the value of k in Btu·hr^-1·ft^-1·°F^-1.

Wait, k for air at 20°C is about 0.025 W/m·K. Wait, 0.025 W/m·K is equal to 0.025 * 0.5778 ≈ 0.01445 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a table value.

Wait, I might have better luck looking up k in English units. Let me recall: at 60°F, k for air is about 0.01307 Btu·hr^-1·ft^-1·°F^-1. But at 68°F, it's a bit more, maybe around 0.0135? Let me just take k_air ≈ 0.0135 Btu·hr^-1·ft^-1·°F^-1.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the conversion. 1 W/m·K = 0.57782 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So if k_air is 0.025 W/m·K, then in Btu units it's 0.025 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.01445 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). But wait, the units are per inch, and we have x in feet, so perhaps I need to convert k to per foot.

Wait, no, because in the formula h = (k/x)*Nu, the x is in feet. So let me make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, if k is in Btu·hr^-1·ft^-1·°F^-1, then x must be in feet. So, let's compute h = (k / x) * Nu.

So, k = 0.0135 Btu·hr^-1·ft^-1·°F^-1.

x is 0.3333 ft.

So, k/x = 0.0135 / 0.3333 ≈ 0.0405 Btu·hr^-1·ft^-0·°F^-1, because (ft^-1) / ft = ft^-0.

Then, h = 0.0405 * Nu. Nu is approx 77.74.

So h ≈ 0.0405 * 77.74 ≈ 3.146 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are in the range of 10-12.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, the formula might be different. Oh wait, I think I messed up the units for k. Let me make sure. Because in the formula, h is in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), k is in Btu·hr^-1·ft^-1·°F^-1, x is in ft. So when you divide k by x, you get (Btu/(hr·ft²·°F)) * (ft·hr)/(Btu·ft·°F)) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, the formula is correct: h = (k/x) * Nu. So let me think about the units. k is [W/(m·K)] or [Btu/(hr·ft·°F)]. So when I calculate h as (k/x)*Nu, the units should be [Btu/(hr·ft²·°F)].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me make sure.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should use k in the correct units. Let me check a standard value: at 20°C (68°F), k_air is approximately 0.025 W/m·K, which is 0.025 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.01445 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Because 1 W/m·K = 0.57782 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So 0.025 W/m·K = 0.01445 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

But in the formula, x is in feet, so I need to convert k into Btu/(hr·ft·°F). Since 1 ft = 12 inches, so 1 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F) is equal to (1/12) Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So 0.01445 / 12 ≈ 0.001204 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So k_air ≈ 0.001204 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So now, h = (k_air / x) * Nu.

x is 0.3333 ft.

k_air / x = 0.001204 / 0.3333 ≈ 0.003612 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then, h = 0.003612 * Nu. Nu was calculated as approximately 77.74.

So 0.003612 * 77.74 ≈ 0.281 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). Hmm, that's even lower. That can't be right because the options are 10-12.

Wait, I'm definitely messing up the units somewhere. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for h in English units directly. Let me see if there's a correlation for h in terms of Re and Pr with appropriate units.

Wait, another approach: the heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using the formula h = (0.332 * Re^0.5 * Pr^0.333) * (k/x). But perhaps I can find all the properties in English units correctly.

Let me list the variables:

v = 33 ft/s

x = 4 inches = 0.3333 ft

T_air = 68°F

T_s (at 4 inches) = 212°F

We need to find h and q''.

First, find the air properties at 68°F. Let me get accurate values.

At 68°F, the air properties are approximately:

- Density (ρ) = 0.0763 lbm/ft³

- Specific heat (c_p) = 0.24 Btu/lbm·°F

- Dynamic viscosity (μ) = 1.203e-5 lb-sec/ft²

- Kinematic viscosity (ν) = μ/ρ = 1.203e-5 / 0.0763 ≈ 1.577e-4 ft²/s.

- Thermal conductivity (k) = 0.01307 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)

- Prandtl number (Pr) = (μ c_p)/k = (1.203e-5 * 0.24) / 0.01307 ≈ (2.892e-6) / 0.01307 ≈ 0.2215. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, Pr for air is around 0.7, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, the formula for Pr is (c_p * μ) / k. So using the values:

c_p = 0.24 Btu/lbm·°F

μ = 1.203e-5 lb-sec/ft²

k = 0.01307 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)

So Pr = (0.24 * 1.203e-5) / 0.01307.

Compute numerator: 0.24 * 1.203e-5 = 2.892e-6.

Divide by k: 2.892e-6 / 0.01307 ≈ 2.892e-6 / 1.307e-2 ≈ (2.892 / 1307) )e-4 ≈ approx 2.214e-6. Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, 2.892e-6 / 0.01307 = (2.892 / 13.07) )e-5 ≈ 0.2215e-5. Wait, no, 2.892e-6 / 0.01307 = approx 2.214e-4.

Wait, 0.01307 is 1.307e-2. So 2.892e-6 / 1.307e-2 = (2.892 / 1307) )e-4. Let me compute 2.892 / 1307 ≈ 0.002214. So 0.002214e-4 = 2.214e-7. That doesn't make sense because Pr for air should be around 0.7. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Prandtl number is different in English units? Or maybe the specific heat is in different units. Wait, c_p is in Btu/lbm·°F, μ is in lb-sec/ft², and k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So the units for Pr would be (Btu/(lbm·°F) * lb-sec/ft²) ) / (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)).

Let me compute the units:

Numerator: (Btu/(lbm·°F)) * (lb-sec/ft²) ) → (Btu·lb-sec)/(lbm·°F·ft²).

Denominator: (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) → Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So overall units for Pr: (Btu·lb-sec)/(lbm·°F·ft²) ) / (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) ) → (lb-sec * hr) / (lbm * ft).

Because:

- Btu cancels out.

- °F cancels out.

- ft² in denominator and ft in denominator gives 1/ft^3.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Pr value of 0.7 for air, as it's a known value. So maybe I should just proceed with Pr = 0.7.

Now, Re = (v * x) / ν = (33 ft/s * 0.3333 ft) / 1.577e-4 ft²/s.

Calculate numerator: 33 * 0.3333 ≈ 11 ft²/s.

So Re = 11 / 1.577e-4 ≈ 69,748. So Re ≈ 69,750.

Now, Nu = 0.332 * Re^0.5 * Pr^(1/3) = 0.332 * sqrt(69,750) * (0.7)^(1/3).

Compute sqrt(69,750): sqrt(6.975e4) = sqrt(6.975)*100 ≈ 2.641 * 100 ≈ 264.1.

So 0.332 * 264.1 ≈ 87.7.

Now, (0.7)^(1/3): cube root of 0.7 is approximately 0.887.

So Nu ≈ 87.7 * 0.887 ≈ 77.8.

Now, h = (k / x) * Nu.

k = 0.01307 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

x = 0.3333 ft.

So h = (0.01307 / 0.3333) * 77.8.

0.01307 / 0.3333 ≈
