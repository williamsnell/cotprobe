Question:

Describe the path of a molecule of sugar from the time it entersthe mouth as part of a molecule of starch, until it reachesthe cytoplasm of the cells lining the small intestine.

Options:

A: The starch undergoes no change in the mouth but is broken down into glucose by the enzyme pepsin in the stomach and then absorbed in the small intestine.
B: The starch remains intact until reaching the small intestine, where it is digested by bacteria into glucose, which is then absorbed by the cells lining the small intestine.
C: The starch is dissolved in the mouth, then fermented into glucose in the large intestine, and finally transported back to the small intestine.
D: The starch is immediately hydrolyzed into glucose by saliva in the mouth and then directly enters the bloodstream without further digestion.
E: The starch is first converted to sucrose in the mouth, then to maltose in the stomach, and finally to glucose in the small intestine where it is absorbed.
F: The starch is directly absorbed into the cells lining the small intestine.
G: The starch is chewed and mixed with saliva, hydrolyzed by the enzyme amylase into maltose units, which are then hydrolyzed into glucose molecules in the small intestine, and transported into the cellular cytoplasm.
H: The starch is broken into fructose units in the mouth, then converted to glucose in the liver, and later absorbed by the cells in the small intestine.
I: The starch is converted into glucose in the mouth and then absorbed by the stomach.
J: The starch is broken down into glucose in the stomach and then absorbed by the small intestine.

Okay, so I've got this question about the path of a sugar molecule from when it's in the mouth as part of starch until it reaches the cytoplasm of the small intestine cells. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let me think this through step by step.

Alright, starch is a carbohydrate, right? And in the body, it's broken down into simpler sugars. I remember that digestion starts in the mouth. Oh wait, the mouth has saliva, which contains an enzyme called amylase. Amylase breaks down starches into shorter chains, like maltose. So the starch doesn't stay intact; it starts breaking down in the mouth.

So when you chew, the starch mixes with saliva and amylase does its thing. Then you swallow, and the partially digested food (now called bolus) goes down the esophagus into the stomach. Wait, what happens in the stomach? The stomach has acidic digestive juices, right? And I think the stomach's main enzyme is pepsin, which breaks down proteins. Oh, but what about the amylase from the mouth? Stomach acid is acidic, which probably denatures the amylase, stopping its action. So the breakdown of starch stops in the stomach, and the partially broken-down starch (like maltose) moves on to the small intestine.

In the small intestine, the environment is more alkaline because bile from the liver neutralizes the stomach acid. Pancreatic juice is released here, containing more amylase, which continues breaking down the starch into shorter units. So, the maltose (or other short chains) get broken down into glucose by enzymes like maltase, which are embedded in the brush border of the small intestine cells.

Once it's glucose, it's small enough to be absorbed. The cells lining the small intestine (enterocytes) take in glucose through a process called facilitated diffusion, using carrier proteins. So the glucose moves into the cytoplasm of these cells. After that, it can be transported into the bloodstream via capillaries, but the question stops at the cytoplasm, so I don't need to go beyond that.

Now looking at the options:

Option A says starch is broken down by pepsin in the stomach. That's wrong because pepsin is for proteins, and stomach acid stops amylase from saliva.

Option B says starch remains intact until the small intestine and is digested by bacteria. No, because some breakdown starts in the mouth, and bacteria action is more in the large intestine, not for starch digestion mainly.

Option C mentions dissolving in the mouth, then fermentation in large intestine. Doesn't fit because small intestine is where most of our sugar absorption happens, not large.

Option D says starch is hydrolyzed immediately into glucose by saliva. That's not right because amylase makes it into maltose, not glucose, and further breakdown happens in the small intestine.

Option E: Converted to sucrose in mouth, then maltose in stomach. No, that doesn't make sense. Amylase doesn't make sucrose, and stomach doesn't do that.

Option F: Starch is directly absorbed. No, because our cells can't absorb starch; it must be broken down into glucose.

Option G: Starch is chewed and mixed with saliva, broken into maltose by amylase, then into glucose in small intestine, transported into cytoplasm. That sounds right. So G would be the correct path.

Option H: Broken into fructose in mouth, then glucose in liver. No, starch breaks into glucose, not fructose, and conversion in liver isn't part of this process.

Option I: Starch converted to glucose in mouth and absorbed by stomach. No, mouth starts breakdown but doesn't finish, and stomach doesn't absorb much.

Option J: Starch broken down in stomach into glucose. No, stomach doesn't do that; that's the small intestine's job.

So the correct answer should be G.

The path of a sugar molecule from starch in the mouth to the cytoplasm of small intestine cells involves several key steps. In the mouth, starch is mixed with saliva containing the enzyme amylase, which breaks it down into shorter chains like maltose. This process begins in the mouth but is not completed there. When swallowed, the partially digested food enters the stomach, where acidic conditions halt further breakdown by amylase. The stomach's main role is to break down proteins, not carbohydrates, so the maltose moves to the small intestine.

In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase further breaks down the maltose into glucose. Enzymes like maltase, embedded in the brush border of the intestinal cells, ensure the complete conversion of maltose into glucose. The glucose is then absorbed into the cytoplasm of the intestinal cells via facilitated diffusion using carrier proteins. This process is essential for nutrient absorption, and the question specifies stopping at the cytoplasm, so further transport into the bloodstream is not considered.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Pepsin in the stomach breaks down proteins, not starch, and stomach acid stops amylase activity.
- **B**: Incorrect. Starch begins breaking down in the mouth, and bacteria in the large intestine are not responsible for starch digestion.
- **C**: Incorrect. Fermentation occurs in the large intestine, not the small intestine, and glucose absorption primarily happens in the small intestine.
- **D**: Incorrect. Saliva breaks starch into maltose, not glucose, and further breakdown occurs in the small intestine.
- **E**: Incorrect. Starch is not converted into sucrose or maltose in the mouth or stomach.
- **F**: Incorrect. Starch cannot be directly absorbed; it must be broken down into glucose.
- **G**: Correct. Starch is broken down into maltose in the mouth and then into glucose in the small intestine, which is absorbed into the cytoplasm.
- **H**: Incorrect. Starch breaks down into glucose, not fructose, and the liver is not involved in this process.
- **I**: Incorrect. The mouth starts starch breakdown, but glucose is not absorbed by the stomach.
- **J**: Incorrect. Starch is not broken down into glucose in the stomach.

The correct answer is **G**.

Answer: G
