Question:

A 12-year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus is brought to the office by his mother for an initial visit. The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140–200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c obtained last week was 5.4%. The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 72/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c?

Options:

A: His daily glucose control is better than recorded
B: His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced
C: His hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated
D: His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1c

Okay, so I've got this question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The question is about a 12-year-old boy who has both sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes. He was diagnosed with diabetes six years ago and has been on insulin and diet management. However, his mom says he's only been marginally compliant with his insulin and diet. His home glucose readings are between 140-200 mg/dL for the past three months, but his hemoglobin A1c is 5.4%. The question is asking why there's a discrepancy between his home glucose readings and his A1c.

Hmm, okay, I remember that hemoglobin A1c measures the average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. It's usually a good indicator of long-term glucose control. So if his home readings are 140-200, that's higher than normal. Normal fasting glucose is around 70-99 mg/dL, and postprandial maybe up to 140 or so, but 140-200 seems consistently elevated. So why is his A1c only 5.4%, which is actually within the normal range (since normal is usually below 5.7%)?

Wait, the boy has sickle cell disease. Sickle cell is a hemoglobinopathy, right? I think that might affect the A1c measurement. Because A1c is a form of hemoglobin, and if the hemoglobin is abnormal, maybe the test isn't accurate.

I recall that certain hemoglobin variants can interfere with HbA1c measurements. For example, in sickle cell trait or disease, some methods might underestimate or overestimate A1c. Let me think: methods like HPLC are more accurate when dealing with abnormal hemoglobins, but other methods might be affected.

Wait, so if the lab used a method that's affected by sickle hemoglobin, the A1c result might not be reliable. So in this case, the patient's A1c is 5.4%, which suggests good control, but his home readings are high. That doesn't add up unless the A1c is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the patient is only checking his blood sugar when it's high, but not when it's low. But his diary shows 140-200, which is consistently in the higher range. If he's not checking when it's low, maybe his average isn't that high, but that doesn't explain why the A1c is low.

Another possibility is that he's not taking his insulin as prescribed, so his glucose is often high, but his A1c is normal. That seems conflicting. Or maybe the lab made a mistake. The question says the A1c was measured last week, so it's recent. Could it be a lab error? That's possible, but usually, the first thought is to consider the patient's condition.

So back to the sickle cell disease. If he has a hemoglobinopathy, the A1c measurement might be inaccurate. Some assays might not correctly measure the A1c when the hemoglobin is abnormal. For example, in some methods, the presence of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) could cause the A1c to be falsely low or high. I think in this case, HbS might interfere with the assay, making the A1c lower than the actual value. So even if his blood glucose is high, the A1c would report as lower than reality.

Wait, wait. Or is it the opposite? Let me think. In people with hemoglobinopathies, some methods like immunoassay might be more accurate, while others based on charge (like some electrophoresis methods) might not. For example, in a patient with HbS, using an assay that's affected by HbS could lead to underestimation of A1c. So if the patient's true average glucose is high (since home readings are 140-200), but the A1c is 5.4%, which is normal, perhaps the A1c is falsely low because of the sickle cell trait.

So that would mean the lab result isn't accurate. Therefore, the discrepancy is due to the sickle cell disease affecting the HbA1c measurement.

Looking at the options:

Option D says, "His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1c." That fits with what I was thinking.

Option A suggests his control is better than recorded. But his home readings are high, so that's unlikely.

Option B says the glucometer is faulty. But the glucometer is used at home, and the readings are consistent over three months. It's possible, but less likely if the issue is with the lab test.

Option C suggests a lab error. That's also possible, but the question gives no indication that the lab made a mistake. The more likely reason is the effect of the disease on the test.

So the correct answer is D.

The question involves a 12-year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus, who presents with a discrepancy between his home fingerstick blood glucose readings (140–200 mg/dL) and his hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 5.4%. The HbA1c is within the normal range, suggesting good glucose control, while his home readings indicate consistently elevated blood glucose levels. The key to resolving this discrepancy lies in the patient's sickle cell disease.

Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy, meaning it involves abnormal hemoglobin. HbA1c measurements can be affected by hemoglobin variants like HbS (sickle hemoglobin). Certain laboratory methods for measuring HbA1c may not accurately reflect true glycemic control in individuals with hemoglobinopathies. For example, some assays may underestimate HbA1c in the presence of HbS, leading to falsely low results. This explains why the patient's HbA1c is normal despite elevated home glucose readings.

Other options are less likely. Option A, suggesting better glucose control than recorded, is inconsistent with the home readings. Option B, implying a faulty glucometer, is unlikely since the readings are consistent over time. Option C, suggesting a lab error, is possible but less likely than the known interference caused by sickle cell disease. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the patient's sickle cell disease is affecting his HbA1c measurement.
