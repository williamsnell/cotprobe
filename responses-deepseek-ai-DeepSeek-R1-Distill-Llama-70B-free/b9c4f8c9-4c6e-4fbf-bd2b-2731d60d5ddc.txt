Question:

Mr. Cleary’s class and Ms. Ntuala’s class go to use the computer lab. There are 20 computers available, two of which do not work. Mr. Cleary’s class has 14 kids, and Ms. Ntuala’s class has 12 kids. If every student must use a computer and there can only be 2 students on a computer at most, what is the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves?

A: 2
B: 18
C: 8
D: 6
E: 16
F: 12
G: 20
H: 10
I: 24

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Cleary’s and Ms. Ntuala’s classes going to the computer lab. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the problem says there are 20 computers available, but two of them don't work. So that leaves 18 working computers. Got that down. Now, both classes are using the lab, with Mr. Cleary having 14 kids and Ms. Ntuala having 12. So total students are 14 + 12 = 26 students. Hmm, but wait, there are only 18 computers. So with each computer allowing up to two students, how does that work?

The question is asking for the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves. So I'm thinking, what's the best way to arrange the students to maximize the number of computers used by only one student each.

Let me think: each computer can have either one or two students. To maximize the number of single-student computers, we need to minimize the number of computers used by two students.

So the total number of students is 26. The minimum number of computers needed would be if as many computers as possible have two students. But wait, I'm trying to find the maximum number of single-student computers, which is the opposite. So perhaps I should calculate how many can have one student, and the rest will be on shared computers.

Wait, wait. Let me think differently. Each computer can hold 1 or 2. So the maximum number of single students is when as many as possible are alone, and the remaining are in pairs.

But the total number of students is 26. So 26 = (number of single students) + 2*(number of computers with two students). Let me denote S as the number of single students, and D as the number of computers with two students. So S + 2D = 26.

But we also have the constraint that the total number of computers used (S + D) can't exceed 18, since there are 18 working computers. Wait, no, because each S student uses one computer, and each D uses one computer but holds two students. So the total computers used would be S + D = number of computers used. But since each computer can have at most two students, the maximum number of computers used is 18.

Wait, but the total number of computers is 18, so S + D ≤ 18, because each computer is either used once (S) or twice (D), but the number of computers is fixed.

So now we have two equations:

1. S + 2D = 26 (total students)
2. S + D ≤ 18 (total computers used)

We can try substituting. From equation 2, S = 18 - D. Wait, but it's ≤, so the maximum D would be when S is as small as possible, but I'm trying to maximize S. Hmm, maybe I need to find the maximum possible S where both equations are satisfied.

Wait, perhaps I should express S in terms of D from equation 1:

From equation 1: S = 26 - 2D.

Substitute into equation 2:

(26 - 2D) + D ≤ 18 → 26 - D ≤ 18 → -D ≤ -8 → D ≥ 8.

So D must be at least 8. Because if D is 8, then S = 26 - 16 = 10. Then S + D = 18, which fits the computer limit.

Wait, but if D is more than 8, like 9, then S would be 26 - 18 = 8. Then S + D = 17, which is under 18. So that's possible, but then S is smaller. So to maximize S, we want the smallest possible D that satisfies D ≥8.

So D=8, S=10.

So the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is 10.

Wait, but let me check another way. If I have D=8, then 8 computers have 2 students each, which is 16 students. Then S=10, so 10 computers have one student each. So total computers used are 8+10=18, which is exactly the number available. So total students accounted for: 16 +10=26.

Yes, that adds up. So the maximum S is 10. So the answer should be H:10.

To determine the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves, we start by noting that there are 18 working computers and 26 students (14 from Mr. Cleary’s class and 12 from Ms. Ntuala’s class). Each computer can hold either one or two students. 

Let \( S \) represent the number of students who have a computer to themselves, and \( D \) represent the number of computers shared by two students. The total number of students is given by:

\[
S + 2D = 26
\]

Additionally, the total number of computers used is constrained by the 18 available computers:

\[
S + D \leq 18
\]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( D \):

\[
S = 18 - D
\]

Substituting this into the first equation:

\[
(18 - D) + 2D = 26
\]

Simplifying:

\[
18 + D = 26 \quad \Rightarrow \quad D = 8
\]

Substituting \( D = 8 \) back into \( S = 18 - D \):

\[
S = 18 - 8 = 10
\]

Thus, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is 10. This solution satisfies both the total number of students and the constraint on the number of computers.
