Okay, so I've got this question about the Sun's surface temperature, and I'm trying to figure out the best answer. I remember that the Sun is really hot, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know the Sun is a star, and stars emit light based on their temperature. The color of the Sun appears yellowish to us, but I've heard that it's actually white. Hmm, wait, maybe that's when looking from space. Anyway, the color relates to temperature through something called blackbody radiation. I think there's a term for that—like Wien's Law maybe? Yeah, Wien's displacement law. It relates the peak wavelength of light to temperature.

Wien's Law formula is lambda max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact value, but I think it's around 2.9e-3 m·K. So if I can find the peak wavelength, I can find the temperature.

I remember that the Sun's peak emission is in the visible range, around green or yellow. The visible spectrum is roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So if the peak is in the middle, maybe around 500 nm? Wait, but I thought the Sun's peak is actually in the blue or green. Or was that something else? Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, I recall that the Sun's surface temperature is often cited around 5500 to 6000 K. Wait, I think the commonly accepted value is about 5778 K, which is approximately 5800 K. So looking at the options, that's closest to option C: 6000 K or option G:7000 K? Wait, 5800 is closer to 6000 than 7000, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. I remember that the Sun's color is white, but because our atmosphere scatters blue light more, it looks yellow to us. So the actual color, if seen in space, would be white, which suggests a higher temperature than a red star. Red stars are cooler, like around 3000-4000 K, while hotter stars appear blue. So the Sun being white would be in the middle. So what's the temperature for a white star? I think around 5000-6000 K. 

Looking back at the options, option B is 5000 K, C is 6000 K, E is 8000 K, G is 7000 K, and J is 10000 K. Wait, but 5800 is closer to 6000 than 5000. So the best approximation would be 6000 K. But I'm not entirely sure. I might be confusing the Sun's core temperature with its surface. Oh wait, the core is way hotter, like millions of Kelvin, but the question is about the surface, so that's the photosphere. Right, the photosphere is about 5800 K.

So looking at the options, C is 6000 K, which is the closest to 5800. But wait, option G is 7000 K, which is a bit higher. So why isn't that the case? Oh, no, because 5800 is closer to 6000 than 7000. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, another thought: I've heard people approximate the Sun's temperature as about 6000 K. Yes, that sounds familiar. So that would back up option C.

The Sun's surface temperature is approximately 5778 K, which is often rounded to about 5800 K. This temperature corresponds to the photosphere, the layer of the Sun's surface that emits light. Using Wien's displacement law and considering the Sun's peak emission in the visible spectrum, the temperature is closer to 6000 K than to 7000 K. Among the given options, 6000 K (option C) is the best approximation for the Sun's surface temperature.

Answer: C
