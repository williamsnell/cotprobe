Okay, so I have this question about Greek philosophers and when they shifted away from the anthropomorphic view of the divine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my ancient Greek philosophy, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that in early Greek thought, people like Homer and Hesiod depicted gods with human-like forms and personalities. The gods had human traits, they could look like humans, and they had all these human emotions and flaws. That's what anthropomorphic means, right? So the question is asking when Greek philosophers started rejecting that view.

I think the pre-Socratic philosophers were some of the first to challenge these traditional views. They started looking for more natural explanations for phenomena instead of relying on myths. For example, Thales of Miletus is often considered one of the first philosophers, and he was around in the sixth century BCE. He proposed that water was the fundamental substance, which was a big shift from mythological explanations.

Wait, but when exactly did the major shift happen? Thales was in the early sixth century, but maybe the movement really took off a bit later. The pre-Socratics include people like Anaximander and Xenophanes, who were active in the sixth and fifth centuries. Xenophanes is known for criticizing the anthropomorphic gods, saying that if animals had gods, their gods would look like animals. So that's a direct rejection of anthropomorphism.

I think the shift really gained momentum around the fifth century BCE. Philosophers like Heraclitus and Parmenides were active then, and they were moving away from the traditional myths. But wait, the question is about the major shift, so maybe it's a bit earlier than that. Or perhaps it's the transition from the earlier to the later pre-Socratics.

Wait, the options given are: 

A: Late Sixth Century BCE
B: Late Second Century BCE
C: Early Fifth Century BCE
D: Late Fourth Century BCE
E: Early First Century BCE
F: Early Third Century BCE
G: Fourth and Third Century BCE
H: Mid Seventh Century BCE
I: Early Sixth Century BCE
J: Second and First Century BCE

So, if Xenophanes is mid to late sixth century, then maybe the late sixth century would be when the shift started. But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the fifth century when it became a major trend.

Wait, another angle: The anthropomorphic view was dominant in the Archaic period, which is up to around 500 BCE. The Classical period starts around 500, and that's when philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were active. So perhaps the shift was in the transition from Archaic to Classical, which would be around the early fifth century.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the major movements. The pre-Socratic movement began in the sixth century, so maybe the late sixth century is when they started rejecting the anthropomorphic divine.

Wait, another thought: Plato and Aristotle were in the fourth century BCE. They had more developed ideas about the divine, like the Forms or the Unmoved Mover, which are more abstract and less anthropomorphic. So maybe the major shift was in the late fourth century when these more systematic philosophies emerged.

But then again, the pre-Socratics were earlier. The question is about the major shift, so perhaps it's when the majority of philosophers moved away from the traditional views. That might be in the fifth century, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the shift started with the pre-Socratics in the sixth century, but became a major trend in the fifth. So perhaps the correct answer is around the early fifth century, which is option C.

Wait, another approach: The anthropomorphic view was common in Greek mythology, which was prevalent before the rise of philosophical thought. As philosophy emerged, they began questioning those views. So the major shift would be during the early days of philosophy, which is the sixth century. So maybe the late sixth century, option A.

But I'm a bit confused because I remember that Xenophanes, who was critical of anthropomorphism, lived around 570-478 BCE. So his main activity was in the late sixth and early fifth centuries. So the shift might have been around that time.

Alternatively, the major shift could have happened when more philosophers started adopting these views, perhaps in the fifth century. So perhaps option C, early fifth century.

Wait, but the question is about the major shift. The initial steps were in the sixth century, but maybe the major shift was when it became more widespread, like in the fifth century.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the late fourth century with Aristotle. No, I think the shift started earlier.

So, putting it all together, I think the major shift was in the late sixth century BCE when the pre-Socratics like Xenophanes began rejecting the anthropomorphic view. So the answer would be option A: Late Sixth Century BCE.

The question asks when the major shift occurred among Greek philosophers who rejected the anthropomorphic view of the divine. The anthropomorphic view, which depicted gods with human-like forms and traits, was prevalent in early Greek mythology. However, with the rise of pre-Socratic philosophers, this view began to be challenged.

Philosophers like Thales of Miletus in the early sixth century BCE proposed natural explanations for phenomena, marking an initial shift away from mythological accounts. Xenophanes, active in the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, directly criticized anthropomorphism, arguing that gods would reflect the forms of the beings that imagined them. This critique represents a significant step in rejecting the anthropomorphic divine.

The major shift, however, likely occurred in the late sixth century BCE, as this is when philosophers like Xenophanes began to gain prominence and their ideas started to influence broader philosophical thought. While the fifth and fourth centuries saw further development of these ideas, the late sixth century marks the period when the rejection of anthropomorphism became a notable trend.
