Okay, so I've got this pump problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of fluid mechanics. But let's tackle it step by step. The question has four parts, (a) through (d), and each part builds on the previous. Let's start with part (a).

Part (a) asks for the specific speed of a pump that delivers 2,000 gpm against a head of 150 ft at 600 rpm. Specific speed, I remember, is a way to characterize the pump's performance. The formula for specific speed (N_s) is N_s = (Q^(1/2) * N) / (H)^(3/4). But wait, I should double-check the units here. Oh right, in the US units, it's Q in gpm, N in rpm, and H in feet. So plugging in the numbers:

Q is 2000 gpm. So square root of 2000 is about 44.72. Multiply by N, which is 600, gives 44.72 * 600 = 26,832. Then divide by H^(3/4). H is 150, so 150^(3/4). Let's calculate that. 150^(1/4) is the fourth root of 150. The square root of 150 is about 12.247, and the square root of that is around 3.5. So 150^(3/4) is (150^(1/4))^3, which is about 3.5^3 = 42.875. So N_s is 26,832 / 42.875 ≈ 626. Hmm, but looking at the options, none have exactly 626. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 150^(3/4) precisely. Let me think. 150^0.75 is the same as e^(0.75 * ln(150)). Ln(150) is approximately 5.0106. So 0.75 * 5.0106 is about 3.758. e^3.758 is e^3 is 20.085, e^0.758 is around 2.135, so 20.085 * 2.135 ≈ 42.86. So yes, same as before.

So 26,832 / 42.86 ≈ 626. But looking at the options, the closest I see is option E (625), option H (650), or D (640). Hmm, maybe I made a calculation mistake somewhere. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 2000 gpm: square root is sqrt(2000) = 44.72136. Multiply by 600: 44.72136 * 600 = 26,832.96. Then divide by (150)^(3/4) = 42.86. So 26,832.96 / 42.86 ≈ 626. So 626. But none of the options have this. Wait, looking at the options, option J's (a) is 625, which is close. Option E's (a) is 625 as well. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed, maybe it'll make more sense after part (b).

Part (b): If the rotational speed were doubled, what's the flow rate and head? Assuming no change in efficiency. So, speed is doubled from 600 to 1200 rpm. Since the pump's performance is typically governed by similarity laws, the flow rate (Q) is proportional to speed (N), and the head (H) is proportional to N squared. So Q2 = Q1 * (N2 / N1) = 2000 * (1200/600) = 4000 gpm. Head H2 = H1 * (N2/N1)^2 = 150 * (2)^2 = 150 *4=600 ft. So part (b) would have Q=4000 gpm and H=600 ft.

Now, looking at the options, which option has (b) 4000 gpm and 600 ft? Let's see: Option J's (b) says 4000 gpm and 600 ft. So that's a match. So option J has that.

Then part (c) is the specific speed under the new conditions. So N_s = sqrt(Q) * N / H^(3/4). Wait, but wait, the speed is now 1200 rpm, Q is 4000, H is 600. So let's compute it.

sqrt(4000) is about 63.246. Multiply by 1200: 63.246 * 1200 = 75,895.2. Now, H is 600 ft. So H^(3/4) is 600^0.75. Let me calculate that. 600^(1/4) is the fourth root of 600. Let me compute it as e^( (ln600)/4 ). Ln(600)=6.3969, divided by 4 is 1.5992. e^1.5992 is about 4.93. So 600^(3/4) is (600^(1/4))^3 = (4.93)^3 ≈ 119.6.

So N_s = 75,895.2 / 119.6 ≈ 635. But wait, let's compute it more accurately. 4.93 cubed: 4.93 *4.93 = 24.3, *4.93 ≈ 119.6. So yes. 75,895.2 / 119.6 ≈ 634.8, roughly 635. But in the options, for part (c), which option has (c) as 635? Looking at the options, J's (c) is 625, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the specific speed remains the same when the speed changes, because specific speed is a function of the pump's design. Wait, no, specific speed is a dimensionless number based on the operating conditions, so it changes when the operating conditions change. So perhaps my calculation is correct, but none of the options match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 600^(3/4) more accurately. Let me compute 600^0.75.

Alternatively, 600 = 6 * 100, so 600^0.75 = 6^0.75 * 100^0.75.

6^0.75 is e^(0.75 * ln6) ≈ e^(0.75 * 1.7918) = e^1.3439 ≈ 3.82.

100^0.75 = (10^2)^0.75 = 10^(1.5) = 31.623.

So 3.82 *31.623 ≈ 120.7.

So H^(3/4) is approximately 120.7. So N_s = 75,895.2 / 120.7 ≈ 628.8. So around 629. Hmm, which option's (c) is close to 629? Let's look: option J has (c) 625, which is close but not exact. Option E's (c) is 650, which is higher. Option H's (c) is 650 as well. Hmm, but maybe I should make sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Specific speed is N_s = (Q^(1/2) * N) / (H)^(3/4). So plugging in Q=4000, N=1200, H=600.

sqrt(4000)=63.246, multiply by 1200 gives 75892.8. H^(3/4) as 120.7. So 75892.8 / 120.7 ≈ 628.5. So approximately 628.5. None of the options have that. But looking at options, J's (c) is 625, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, perhaps the question for part (c) is not about the new specific speed but the same as part (a). No, that doesn't make sense. Because when you change the speed, specific speed changes. So I'm a bit confused. Let's move on to part (d) and see what the options give.

Part (d) asks for the required operating speed of a two-stage pump to meet the same conditions as (a). So, same Q=2000 gpm and H=150 ft, but now it's a two-stage pump.

I remember that in multi-stage pumps, the head is multiplied by the number of stages. So each stage would produce H_stage = 150 / 2 = 75 ft. But the specific speed for each stage would be the same as for a single-stage pump, assuming similar design.

So, for each stage, N_s = (Q^(1/2) * N) / (H_stage)^(3/4).

We have Q=2000, H_stage=75, N is what we're solving for.

So rearranging: N = (N_s * H_stage^(3/4)) / sqrt(Q).

We can take N_s from part (a), which we calculated as approximately 626. Let's use 626 for this calculation.

So H_stage^(3/4)=75^(3/4). Let's compute that. 75^0.75 is e^(0.75 * ln75). Ln75≈4.3175, so 0.75 *4.3175≈3.238. e^3.238≈25.24.

So N = (626 * 25.24) / sqrt(2000).

sqrt(2000)=44.721.

So numerator: 626 *25.24 ≈ 626*25=15650, 626*0.24≈150.24, total≈15700.24.

So N≈15700.24 /44.721 ≈ 351 rpm per stage. But since it's two stages, the total speed would be 2 * 351 ≈702 rpm? Wait, no, no. The specific speed is per stage. So each stage operates at 351 rpm, but for a two-stage pump, the total head is 2*H_stage=150 ft. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is different.

Wait, no. The operating speed N is the same for each stage in a multi-stage pump. So each stage contributes to the head. So the specific speed for each stage would be calculated based on the same Q, the same N, and each stage's H.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: For a two-stage pump, each stage must produce H=75 ft. So using the specific speed formula for each stage:

N_s = (Q^(1/2) * N) / (H_stage)^(3/4).

We can rearrange to solve for N:

N = (N_s * H_stage^(3/4)) ) / sqrt(Q).

We know from part (a) that N_s was about 626 for the single-stage pump. Assuming the same specific speed for each stage in the two-stage pump, we can plug that in.

So H_stage =75, so 75^(3/4) is as before approximately 25.24.

N = (626 *25.24 ) / sqrt(2000).

Which as before gives 626 *25.24 ≈ 15,800. Divide by 44.721 gives ≈353 rpm.

But wait, the options for part (d) are 390 rpm (option A), 340 (B), 400 (C), 355 (D), 375 (E), 345 (F), 330 (G), 350 (H), 410 (I), 365 (J).

Wait, so 353 is close to option D (355) or option H (350). Hmm, but perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 75^(3/4) precisely. Let me compute 75^0.75.

75^(1/4) is the fourth root of 75. 3^4=81, so 75^(1/4)= approx 2.915. So 75^(3/4)= (2.915)^3 ≈ 24.8.

So H_stage^(3/4)=24.8.

N = (626 *24.8 ) / 44.721.

626 *24.8 = let's compute 600*24.8=14,880; 26*24.8=644.8. Total 15,524.8.

15,524.8 /44.721 ≈ 347.2 rpm.

So around 347 rpm. Looking at the options, the closest is option H (350) or option D (355). Alternatively, maybe the specific speed in part (a) was different, leading to a different N in part (d).

Wait, perhaps I should go back to part (a) and see if I can get an exact match with the options. Let me try another approach to calculate specific speed.

In the US units, the formula is N_s = (Q^(1/2) * N) / (H)^(3/4).

So for part (a): Q=2000 gpm, N=600 rpm, H=150 ft.

Compute each part:

sqrt(2000) = approx 44.72136.

Multiply by N: 44.72136 * 600 = 26,832.816.

Now, H^(3/4)=150^0.75.

Compute 150^0.75: 

We can write 150^0.75 = exp(0.75 * ln(150)).

ln(150)=5.0106, 0.75 *5.0106=3.758.

exp(3.758)=42.86.

So 26,832.816 / 42.86 ≈ 626. So N_s≈626.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J (625), E (625), and option H is 650, which is higher.

Wait, option J's (a) is 625, which is very close to our calculation of 626. So perhaps part (a) is 625, and option J is the correct one. So let's proceed under that assumption.

So part (a) is 625, part (b) is 4000 gpm and 600 ft, which matches option J.

Now part (c): specific speed for part (b) is N_s = (Q^(1/2)*N)/(H)^(3/4).

Q=4000, N=1200, H=600.

sqrt(4000)=63.2456.

Multiply by 1200: 63.2456 * 1200=75,894.72.

H^(3/4)=600^0.75.

Compute 600^0.75: Let's compute it as 600^0.75 = e^(0.75 * ln600).

ln600=6.3969, 0.75*6.3969≈4.7977.

e^4.7977≈ 220. So wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Because 10^0.75 is 5.6234, 100^0.75 is 31.623, 1000^0.75 is 100^(3/4)*10^(3/4)= approx 31.623 *5.623≈177.8. Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 600^0.75.

600=6*100, so 600^0.75=6^0.75 * 100^0.75.

6^0.75= e^(0.75 * ln6)= e^(0.75*1.7918)=e^(1.3439)=3.82.

100^0.75= (10^2)^0.75=10^(1.5)=31.623.

So 3.82 *31.623≈120.7.

So H^(3/4)=120.7.

So N_s=75,894.72 /120.7≈628.5.

Hmm. So approximately 628.5. Looking at the options, option J's (c) is 625, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 600^0.75 more accurately. Let's compute it as 600^0.75=exp(0.75 * ln(600)).

ln(600)=6.39694.

0.75*6.39694=4.7977.

exp(4.7977)= let's compute e^4=54.598, e^0.7977≈2.218 (since ln(2.218)=0.795). So 54.598 *2.218≈121. So yes, 600^0.75≈121.

So N_s=75,894.72 / 121≈627.3. Approximately 627. So part (c) would be 627, but the options don't have that. The closest is option J's (c) at 625, option E's (c) at 650, etc.

Wait, perhaps the specific speed remains the same when scaling, but I don't think that's the case. Because specific speed depends on the operating conditions, which have changed in part (b). So I'm a bit stuck here, but perhaps it's best to proceed with the options.

So based on part (b) matching option J, let's check what part (d) would be.

In part (d), we're to find the required operating speed for a two-stage pump. As before, each stage needs to produce 75 ft of head. Using the specific speed from part (a), which is 625.

So N_s=625= (Q^(1/2)*N)/(H_stage)^(3/4).

Rearranged, N= (N_s * H_stage^(3/4)) / sqrt(Q).

H_stage=75 ft.

So H_stage^(3/4)=75^0.75.

Wait, earlier we found 75^0.75≈24.8.

So N= (625 *24.8)/sqrt(2000).

625*24.8=15,500.

sqrt(2000)=44.721.

So N≈15,500 /44.721≈346.5 rpm.

But wait, since it's a two-stage pump, does this mean the total speed is double? Or is the speed the same for each stage?

Wait, no. Each stage runs at the same speed N. So the total head is 2*H_stage=150 ft. So the calculation is correct as done before, giving N≈346.5 rpm. Looking at the options, the closest is option J's (d) which is 365 rpm. Hmm, that's a bit higher than our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific speed
