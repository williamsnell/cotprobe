Okay, so I've got this problem about a centrifugal fan, and I'm supposed to find the power needed to drive it. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the given data: The fan has an efficiency of 60%, which is 0.6. The flow rate is 150 cfs (cubic feet per second). The flue gas has a molecular weight of 31.5 lbm/mol and a molar specific volume of 378.5 ft³/lbmol. Initially, the gas is at rest at 220°F and 28.5 in.Hg. At the exit, the pressure is 31.0 in.Hg, and the velocity is 170 ft/s.

Wait, wait. First, I think I need to find the density of the flue gas because that will help in calculating the mass flow rate. Oh right, the ideal gas law might come into play here.

So, the initial conditions are 220°F, which I should convert to absolute temperature. Fahrenheit to Rankine is (F + 459.67), so that's 220 + 459.67 = 679.67 °R.

The pressure is 28.5 in.Hg. Hmm, I remember that 1 atm is about 29.92 in.Hg, so 28.5 in.Hg is slightly less than atmospheric pressure. I need to convert this to pounds per square foot (psf) or pounds per square inch (psi) to use in calculations. Wait, maybe it's easier to convert to atmospheres since the gas constant might be in those units.

Alternatively, I can work in feet and pounds. Let me recall the specific gas constant for the flue gas. Oh, right, the specific gas constant R is given by R = (R_universal) / (M), where R_universal is 1716 ft·lbf/lbmol·°R, and M is the molecular weight.

So R = 1716 / 31.5 ≈ let's calculate that. 1716 divided by 31.5. Let's see, 31.5 times 54 is 1701 (since 30*54=1620, 1.5*54=81; 1620+81=1701). So 1716 - 1701 is 15, so 54 + (15/31.5) ≈ 54.477. So R ≈ 54.477 ft·lbf/lbm·°R.

Now, the initial pressure P1 is 28.5 in.Hg. To convert that to psf: since 1 in.Hg ≈ 0.0361 psi, and 1 psi is 144 psf. So 28.5 in.Hg * 0.0361 psi/in.Hg = approx 1.02885 psi. Then multiply by 144 psf/psi: 1.02885 * 144 ≈ 148.03 psf.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert to lb/ft² because we might need that for density. Let me think: since pressure is force per area, and we're working in the English system, using psf makes sense.

Wait, another approach: The density can be found using the ideal gas law, which is P = (mRT)/V, so m = (P V)/(R T). But wait, m here would be in lbm, and V in cubic feet. So density rho is m/V, so rho = (P) / (R T).

Wait, that's correct. So rho = (P) / (R T). So P is in psf, R in ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), T in °R.

So plugging in the numbers: P1 is 28.5 in.Hg converted to psf. Let me compute that accurately.

Wait, 1 in.Hg is equal to 0.0361 psi. So 28.5 * 0.0361 = let's compute that.

28 * 0.0361 = 1.0108, 0.5 * 0.0361 = 0.01805. So total is 1.0108 + 0.01805 = 1.02885 psi. Now, 1 psi is 144 psf, so 1.02885 * 144 = let's compute that.

1.02885 * 100 = 102.885, 1.02885 * 44 = approx 45.33 (since 1*44=44, 0.02885*44≈1.27). So 102.885 + 45.33 = 148.215 psf. So P1 ≈ 148.215 lb/ft².

Now, T is 679.67 °R. So rho1 = P1 / (R T) = 148.215 / (54.477 * 679.67). Let's compute the denominator first: 54.477 * 679.67 ≈ 

Hmm, 50 * 680 = 34,000. 4.477 * 680 ≈ 3,045. So total approx 34,000 + 3,045 = 37,045. But let's be more precise.

Wait, 54.477 * 679.67 = let me compute it step by step.

First, 54 * 679.67 = let's see. 50*679.67=33,983.5, 4*679.67=2,718.68. So total 33,983.5 + 2,718.68 = 36,702.18.

Now 0.477 * 679.67: 0.4 * 679.67 = 271.868, 0.07 * 679.67 = 47.5769, 0.007 * 679.67 ≈ 4.75769. Sum: 271.868 + 47.5769 = 319.4449 + 4.75769 ≈ 324.2026.

So total R*T ≈ 36,702.18 + 324.2026 ≈ 37,026.382 ft·lbf/lbm.

So rho1 = 148.215 / 37,026.382 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 148 by 37,026: 37,026 is about 37k. 37k into 148 is about 0.004 or so. Let me compute 148.215 / 37,026.382.

Well, 37,026.382 * 0.004 = 148.1055. So it's approximately 0.004 (since 0.004 * 37,026.382 ≈ 148.1055). So rho1 ≈ 0.004 lbm/ft³.

Wait, that seems low. Because air, for example, is about 0.076 lbm/ft³ at standard conditions (60°F, 14.7 psi). But here, the pressure is lower (28.5 in.Hg is about 0.97 atm), and the temperature is higher (220°F is like 80°C), so the density should be lower than air's density. So 0.004 lbm/ft³ seems plausible.

So now, the mass flow rate m_dot is rho1 * volumetric flow rate. The volumetric flow rate is 150 cfs. So m_dot = 0.004 lbm/ft³ * 150 ft³/s = 0.6 lbm/s.

Wait, wait, 0.004 *150 = 0.6 lbm/s. Yes.

But wait, the units: 0.004 lbm per cubic foot times 150 cubic feet per second gives 0.6 lbm/s. Correct.

So mass flow rate m_dot is 0.6 lbm/s.

Now, the fan's efficiency is 60%, so η = 0.6. We'll need that to find the power required.

Next, I think we need to find the increase in the energy of the flue gas. That would be the work done on it by the fan. Since it's a centrifugal fan, it's doing work to increase both the pressure and the kinetic energy of the gas.

Wait, the general energy equation for a fan or compressor is the work done per unit mass (w) is equal to the change in specific enthalpy (h2 - h1) plus the change in specific kinetic energy (V2²/2 - V1²/2). But wait, in this problem, the gas is initially at rest, so V1=0. At the exit, the velocity is 170 ft/s, so V2=170.

Alternatively, considering the head added by the fan, which is the sum of the pressure head and the velocity head.

Wait, the pressure rise from P1 to P2. Let me compute that. The exit pressure is 31.0 in.Hg. Wait, is that gauge pressure or absolute? I think it's absolute because it's in the same units as the inlet, which was 28.5 in.Hg. So P2 is 31.0 in.Hg.

So the pressure difference is ΔP = P2 - P1 = 31.0 - 28.5 = 2.5 in.Hg. Convert that to lb/ft².

2.5 in.Hg * 0.0361 psi/in.Hg = 0.09025 psi. Then, 0.09025 psi * 144 psf/psi = 13.0 lb/ft².

Wait, wait. 2.5 * 0.0361 = let me compute that accurately.

2 * 0.0361 = 0.0722, 0.5 * 0.0361=0.01805. So 0.0722 + 0.01805 = 0.09025 psi. Multiply by 144: 0.09025 * 144.

Let me compute 0.09 * 144 = 12.96, and 0.00025 * 144=0.036. So total is 12.96 + 0.036 = 12.996 lb/ft². Approximately 13 lb/ft².

So the pressure rise is 13 lb/ft².

Wait, but earlier I had P1 as about 148 lb/ft², and P2 as 31 in.Hg. Wait, 31 in.Hg is higher than 28.5, so it's 31 in.Hg, which we should convert to psf.

Wait, 31 in.Hg: let me compute that. 31 * 0.0361 psi/in.Hg. Let's compute 30 *0.0361=1.083, 1*0.0361=0.0361. Total 1.1191 psi. Then, 1.1191 psi * 144 psf/psi = 161.27 lb/ft².

Wait, that's the P2 in psf. P1 was 148.215 psf. So ΔP is P2 - P1 = 161.27 - 148.215 = 13.055 psf, which matches the earlier approximate 13 lb/ft².

So the pressure increase is about 13 lb/ft².

Now, the specific volume (volume per unit mass) is given as 378.5 ft³/lbmol. Wait, but I think I calculated the density, which is mass per volume, so specific volume is the inverse. Oh, but perhaps that's specific volume at certain conditions, but since the gas is at different T and P, I probably don't need it for this calculation. I think I've already calculated the density correctly, so maybe I can proceed.

So the fan does work to increase the pressure and the velocity of the gas. The work per pound (w) is given by (P2 - P1)/(rho) + (V2^2)/2.

Wait, because the work done is equal to the change in specific enthalpy plus the change in kinetic energy.

Wait, specific enthalpy change is (P2 - P1)/rho, because h = u + Pv, and assuming constant u (which is not necessarily true, but perhaps in this context, it's being modeled as such). Alternatively, since we're dealing with incompressible flow, the pressure work is (P2 - P1)/rho.

But wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Bernoulli equation, but including the work done by the fan.

Alternatively, the power required is the mass flow rate multiplied by the work done per unit mass, divided by the efficiency.

So the specific work w is (P2 - P1)/rho + (V2^2 - V1^2)/2. Since V1 is zero, it's (P2 - P1)/rho + V2^2/(2).

So let's compute each term.

First term: (P2 - P1)/rho = 13 lb/ft² / 0.004 lbm/ft³. Let's compute that.

13 / 0.004 = 3250 ft²/s²? Wait, units: lb/ft² divided by lbm/ft³ is (lb/ft²) * (ft³/lbm) )= lb*ft/(ft² * lbm) )= ft/(lbm). Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units.

Wait, (P2-P1) is in lb/ft². rho is lbm/ft³. So (P2-P1)/rho would be (lb/ft²) * (ft³/lbm) )= (lb * ft)/(ft² * lbm) )= (ft)/(lbm). Hmm, that's ft per lbm, which seems like specific energy.

Wait, but specific work is in ft·lbf/lbm. So perhaps I should convert units accordingly.

Wait, 1 ft·lbf is 1 (lbf)(ft). So the term (P2-P1)/rho is in (lb/ft²) * (ft³/lbm) )= lb*ft/(ft² lbm) )= ft/(lbm). To convert this to ft·lbf/lbm, I need to multiply by lbm, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute this as head, in feet of fluid.

So the pressure rise in feet of flue gas can be calculated using h_a = (P2 - P1) / (rho * g), where g is acceleration due to gravity. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work done in terms of energy.

Wait, the specific work (w) is the energy added per unit mass, which includes the pressure rise and the kinetic energy.

So, w = (P2 - P1) / (rho) + (V2^2 - V1^2)/ (2 * g_c), where g_c is the gravitational conversion factor (32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²)).

Wait, but in the English system, when using consistent units, 1 lbf = 32.174 lbm·ft/s². So when we write equations with energy, we have to account for g_c.

So, let me recall the specific work equation for a pump or fan:

w = (P2 - P1)/(rho) + (V2² - V1²)/(2 * g_c) + g (Z2 - Z1)

Assuming no change in elevation (Z2=Z1), so the last term is zero.

So, substituting:

P2 - P1 = 13 lb/ft² (from earlier calculation).

rho is 0.004 lbm/ft³.

V2 = 170 ft/s, V1=0.

So, the second term is (170)^2 / (2 * 32.174) = (28,900) / (64.348) ≈ 449.07 ft²/s².

Wait, but let me compute it step by step.

170^2 = 28,900.

Divide by 2: 14,450.

Divide by 32.174: 14,450 / 32.174 ≈ 449.07.

So, the kinetic energy term is approximately 449.07 ft²/s².

Now, the pressure term: (P2-P1)/(rho) = 13 lb/ft² / 0.004 lbm/ft³. Let's compute that.

13 / 0.004 = 3250. So 3250 lb/ft² * ft³/lbm. Wait, units: (lb/ft²) * (ft³/lbm) )= (lb * ft)/(ft² * lbm) )= ft/(lbm). Hmm, not sure, but perhaps it's better to compute this in terms of energy per mass.

Wait, 1 lb/ft² is 1 psf. 1 ft·lbf is 1 foot-poundal. So, perhaps we can write (P2-P1)/rho as (13 psf) / (0.004 lbm/ft³).

Wait, psf is lb/ft². So 13 lb/ft² divided by 0.004 lbm/ft³: (lb/ft²) * (ft³/lbm) )= (lb * ft) / (ft² * lbm) )= ft/(lbm).

Wait, but to get energy per mass, which is ft²/s² (since energy is force times distance, and mass times acceleration is force), perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of head (feet of fluid), then convert to energy.

So, the pressure rise in feet of flue gas is (P2 - P1) / (rho * g) ≈ 13 lb/ft² / (0.004 lbm/ft³ * 32.174 ft/s²). Wait, but units: lb/ft² divided by (lbm/ft³ * ft/s²) )= (lb/ft²) * (ft³/(lbm)) / (ft/s²) )= (lb * ft³) / (ft² * lbm * ft/s²) )= (lb * ft) / (lbm * s²) )

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

The work done by the fan per unit mass (w) is the sum of the pressure work and the kinetic work.

So, work done to increase pressure: (P2 - P1) * V, where V is specific volume (ft³/lbm). Because PV is work, in ft·lbf.

Wait, because P is in lb/ft², and V is in ft³/lbm. So, (lb/ft²) * (ft³/lbm) )= (lb * ft) / (ft² * lbm) )= (ft·lbf) / lbm. So that's
