Question:

A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician 3 months after she had a blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg at a routine examination prior to participation in school sports. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Measurement of serum potassium levels
B: Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations
C: Exercise and weight reduction program
D: Captopril therapy
E: Initiate diuretic therapy
F: Referral for psychiatric evaluation
G: Initiate calcium channel blocker therapy
H: Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations
I: Measurement of plasma renin activity
J: Initiate beta-blocker therapy

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's go through it step by step.

So, the patient is a 15-year-old girl who was found to have high blood pressure during a routine exam before school sports. Her initial BP was 150/95 mmHg. She's asymptomatic, no serious illnesses, and the only med was trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a UTI a year ago. She's not taking any meds now.

They took her BP three more times on separate occasions: 155/94, 145/90, and 150/92. Today, it's 150/90 confirmed. She's at 50th percentile for height but 95th for weight, so she's a bit overweight. Her physical exam is normal, and her lab tests are mostly normal too. Hematocrit is 40%, which I think is within normal range. Urinalysis is normal. They also did cardiac and renal ultrasounds which showed no issues.

The question is asking for the next step in management. The options are A through J, which include various tests and treatments.

First, I need to understand the context. She's a teenager with elevated blood pressure but no symptoms. Her BP seems to be consistently high over multiple visits. She's overweight, which is a risk factor for hypertension.

In pediatric patients, especially adolescents, the approach to hypertension is a bit different from adults. The first thing is to confirm that it's not secondary hypertension, meaning there's an underlying cause. But her urinalysis is normal, and so are the renal and cardiac ultrasounds. So maybe they're looking into other causes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Measure serum potassium. Why? Low potassium can be a sign of primary aldosteronism or other endocrine issues. If she had hypokalemia, that might suggest something like aldosterone excess. But her urinalysis was normal, which would include checking for proteinuria, blood, etc., but not necessarily potassium levels. However, she's asymptomatic, and without edema or other signs, but maybe it's worth checking.

Option B: Urine corticosteroids. Not sure. Maybe checking for Cushing's syndrome? But her presentation doesn't immediately suggest that. Cushing's would probably cause more symptoms like weight gain in central areas, hirsutism, etc.

Option C: Exercise and weight reduction. Since she's overweight (95th percentile), lifestyle modification is often the first step in managing hypertension. Even if she doesn't have symptoms, getting her to lose weight and exercise could help lower her BP.

Option D: Captopril. That's an ACE inhibitor, used to treat high BP. But would they start medication in a teenager without first trying lifestyle changes?

Option E: Diuretics. Another class of BP meds. Again, probably not first-line without lifestyle changes.

Options F and J: Beta-blockers. Also BP meds. But again, same reasoningâ€”probably not first unless lifestyle fails.

Option H: Urine catecholamines. That's for pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine excess. Her BP is high, but she's asymptomatic otherwise, which might not fit. Plus, pheo is rare in kids.

Option I: Plasma renin activity. That's part of evaluating the renin-angiotensin system. High renin could suggest renovascular issues, but her renal ultrasound was normal.

So, considering her age and the fact that she's overweight, the first step would likely be lifestyle modifications. She doesn't seem to have symptoms of end-organ damage, so maybe no rush to start meds. They should probably try weight loss and exercise first.

Looking at the options, option C is about an exercise and weight reduction program. That makes sense as the next step before considering medications.

The patient is a 15-year-old girl with consistently elevated blood pressure (150/90 mmHg) over multiple visits. She is asymptomatic, overweight (95th percentile for weight), and has no history of serious illness or current medications. Lab tests, including urinalysis, hematocrit, and imaging studies, are normal, suggesting no underlying secondary cause of hypertension. 

In pediatric patients, especially adolescents, the initial approach to managing hypertension involves lifestyle modifications, particularly for those who are overweight. This includes promoting weight reduction and regular exercise, which can help lower blood pressure without the need for immediate pharmacotherapy. While further diagnostic testing (e.g., serum potassium, urine catecholamines) could be considered if lifestyle changes fail or if symptoms suggestive of secondary hypertension arise, the current clinical presentation does not indicate an urgent need for such tests or medications.

Given her age, weight status, and lack of symptoms or complications, the most appropriate next step is to recommend an exercise and weight reduction program.
