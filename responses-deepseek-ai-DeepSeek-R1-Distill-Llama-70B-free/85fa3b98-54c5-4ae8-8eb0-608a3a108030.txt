Question:

The distribution of salaries of a county school system with 4,752 employees is known to be right skewed, with the superintendent’s salary an outlier on the higher side. A random sample of 20 employees was taken and their salaries recorded. A 95 percent t-confidence interval for the mean salary of the county school system employees is ($15,360, $32,470). The t-confidence interval is not appropriate in this situation because

Options:

A: the sample size is too large compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation
B: the sample size is too small compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation
C: a 95 percent t-confidence interval is not appropriate for this kind of data
D: the teacher salaries are not negotiable, but the superintendent’s salary is negotiable, so the superintendent’s salary should be excluded from the population sampled
E: the population standard deviation of the salaries of employees of this county school system is known
F: the salary distribution is not right skewed, but left skewed
G: the skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied
H: the population standard deviation of the salaries of employees of this county school system is not known
I: the superintendent's salary is not an outlier on the higher side
J: the teacher salaries are negotiable, and the superintendent’s salary is not negotiable, so the superintendent’s salary should be included in the population sampled

Okay, I have this statistics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and break down what it's asking.

The question is about why a t-confidence interval isn't appropriate for a particular situation. The scenario is about the salaries of a county school system with 4,752 employees. The salary distribution is right skewed, and there's an outlier on the higher side, which is the superintendent's salary. A random sample of 20 employees was taken, and a 95% t-confidence interval for the mean salary was calculated as ($15,360, $32,470). The question is why this t-confidence interval isn't appropriate here.

The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about what each part means.

First, I remember that a t-confidence interval is used when we don't know the population standard deviation and the sample size is small. Wait, but what defines small? Usually, n < 30 is considered small. In this case, the sample size is 20, which is small, so that part makes sense for using a t-interval.

But wait, the question says it's not appropriate. So perhaps one of the assumptions isn't met. The main assumptions for a t-interval are that the population is normally distributed, or the sample size is large enough (like over 30) to assume normality via the Central Limit Theorem. But here, the population distribution is right skewed, which is not normal. Oh, but the sample size is 20, which is small. So that might be a problem.

Wait, the population is right skewed. So the distribution isn't normal. Since the sample size is 20, which is less than 30, the Central Limit Theorem doesn't kick in, meaning the sampling distribution of the mean isn't approximately normal. Therefore, using a t-interval, which assumes that the population is normally distributed (or that the sample size is large enough), would be inappropriate here. Because with a small sample from a skewed population, the t-interval might not be reliable.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones relate to this.

Option G says: "the skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied." Wait, the assumption here is about the population's distribution. The t-test assumes that the population is normally distributed, not necessarily the sample. But wait, when the population is not normal and the sample size is small, the t-test may not be appropriate because the sampling distribution of the mean won't be normal.

So in this case, the population is right skewed, so the assumption of normality (required for the t-interval) isn't met. So G would be a correct reason why the t-confidence interval isn't appropriate.

Other options: Let's check them too.

Option A: Sample size too large compared to population. The sample is 20 out of 4752, which is a small sample. So A is incorrect because the sample isn't too large.

Option B: Sample size too small compared to population. Well, 20 is small, but the issue isn't about representation due to sample size relative to population. It's about the distribution. So B might be a distractor, but the main issue is the distribution, not the sample size per se.

Option C: 95% t-interval not appropriate for this data. That's vague, but the reason would be the distribution, which is covered in G.

Option D: Superintendent's salary should be excluded. But outliers can affect the mean, but the question is about the appropriateness of the t-interval, not whether to exclude data points. Outliers might make the data non-normal, but the interval itself's appropriateness is due to the distribution, not the specific data point.

Option E: Population std dev is known. No, because the question says it's using a t-interval, which implies the population std dev is unknown. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Distribution is left skewed, not right. But the question says right skewed, so F is wrong.

Option H: Population std dev is not known. Well, that's correct because t-interval is used when it's unknown. But the problem here is not about whether we know it, but about the distribution. So H isn't the reason the t-interval is inappropriate.

Option I: Superintendent's salary isn't an outlier. But the question states it is, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Something about negotiable salaries. Doesn't seem relevant to the statistical issue, so J is out.

So the main issue is that the population distribution is not normal (right skewed), and with a small sample size, the t-interval isn't appropriate because the assumption of normality isn't met. So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

The t-confidence interval is not appropriate in this situation because the salary distribution is right skewed, violating the assumption of normality required for the t-interval. With a sample size of 20, which is less than 30, the Central Limit Theorem does not ensure that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal. Therefore, the t-confidence interval, which relies on the population being normally distributed, cannot be reliably used here.

Option G correctly identifies this issue: "the skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied."

Other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the situation (e.g., A, B, F, I, J) or address unrelated issues (e.g., C, D, E, H).
