Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the European Court of Human Rights and the doctrine of the margin of appreciation. Hmm, I need to find out which case first defined this doctrine. I remember that the margin of appreciation is a concept where the Court gives some leeway to the member states in how they implement Convention rights, especially considering cultural, historical, or social differences.

Let me think about the cases listed. The options are A through J, each with a different case. I'm a bit rusty on the exact details, but I'll try to recall.

I think the margin of appreciation was first discussed in the Handyside case. Handyside v UK was about the seizure of a book called "The Little Red Schoolbook," which was considered obscene. The Court ruled that the UK's actions were justified, emphasizing that states have a margin of appreciation in assessing what constitutes obscenity. That would make sense because the case was in 1976, which is earlier than some of the other options.

Wait, but I also remember that the concept was more fully articulated in later cases. But the question is about the first case to define it. So Handyside seems to be the correct one. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option D is Tyrer v UK from 1978. That case involved judicial corporal punishment and found it to be degrading treatment. I don't think that's where the margin of appreciation was defined.

Option B is Marckx v Belgium from 1979. That was about discrimination against illegitimate children. The Court did discuss the margin of appreciation in that case, but I think it came after Handyside.

Option I is Sunday Times v UK from 1979, which dealt with press freedom and contempt of court. The Court definitely used the margin of appreciation there, but again, after Handyside.

So putting it all together, Handyside v UK in 1976 is the first case where the margin of appreciation was defined. So the answer should be H.

The first case to define the meaning of the doctrine of 'margin of appreciation' as applied by the European Court of Human Rights was **Handyside v UK (1976)**. This case involved the seizure of a book deemed obscene, where the Court emphasized that states have a degree of latitude in implementing Convention rights, considering their cultural, historical, or social contexts. While later cases, such as **Marckx v Belgium (1979)** and **Sunday Times v UK (1979)**, further articulated this doctrine, **Handyside** was the first to establish it. Other cases like **Tyrer v UK (1978)** and **Dudgeon v UK (1981)** dealt with different issues and did not address the margin of appreciation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: Handyside v UK (1976)**
