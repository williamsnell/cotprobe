Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a two-level system. Hmm, I remember that a two-level system is a quantum mechanical system where particles can exist in one of two energy states. The problem gives me the frequency v as 1.50e13 s^-1. I'm supposed to find the temperature at which the internal energy U is equal to 0.25 Nhv. Oh wait, and that's half of the limiting value which is 0.50 Nhv. 

Wait, so the limiting value is when all the particles are in the higher energy state? Or is it when the system is at a certain temperature where the populations are in a specific ratio. I'm a bit fuzzy, but I think the internal energy for a two-level system approaches 0.5 Nhv as the temperature increases, because each particle can have up to that energy when fully excited.

The internal energy U for a two-level system is given by the formula U = (Nhv)/(e^{(hv)/(kT)} + 1). Right? Because each particle can be in either the ground state or the excited state, and the average energy is calculated using the Boltzmann distribution. So when T is very high, the exponential term becomes 1, so U approaches (Nhv)/2, which is 0.5 Nhv. That's the maximum possible internal energy, so the problem says that the given U is half of that, so U = 0.25 Nhv.

So the equation I need to solve is 0.25 Nhv = (Nhv)/(e^{(hv)/(kT)} + 1). Oh wait, the N and hv terms are on both sides, so I can cancel them out. Let me write that:

0.25 = 1 / (e^{(hv)/(kT)} + 1)

Then, taking reciprocals on both sides, 1/0.25 = e^{(hv)/(kT)} + 1. So 4 = e^{x} + 1, where x is (hv)/(kT). Then subtracting 1, e^x = 3. 

Taking natural log on both sides, x = ln(3). So x = (hv)/(kT) = ln(3). I need to solve for T. So T = (hv)/(k ln(3)). 

Wait, but I have to plug in the numbers. Let me get the constants right. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. The frequency v is given as 1.5e13 s^-1.

So putting it all together:

T = (h v)/(k ln(3)).

Calculating the numerator first: h*v = 6.626e-34 * 1.5e13 = Let me compute that. 6.626 *1.5 is about 9.939, and the exponents are 10^(-34 +13) )= 10^-21. So 9.939e-21 J.

Denominator: k * ln(3). Ln(3) is approximately 1.0986. So 1.38e-23 * 1.0986 ≈ let's calculate that. 1.38 *1.0986 is about 1.516. So 1.516e-23.

So T is (9.939e-21) / (1.516e-23) = let's compute this division.

9.939e-21 /1.516e-23 = (9.939 / 1.516) * 1e2. Because 1e-21 / 1e-23 = 1e2.

9.939 / 1.516 is approximately 6.55. So 6.55 * 100 = 655 K. 

Looking at the options, option I is 655 K. So the answer should be I, right?

To determine the temperature at which the internal energy of a two-level system equals \( U = 0.25 Nhv \), we start with the formula for internal energy:

\[
U = \frac{Nhv}{e^{\frac{hv}{kT}} + 1}.
\]

Given \( U = 0.25 Nhv \), we substitute and simplify:

\[
0.25 = \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hv}{kT}} + 1}.
\]

Taking reciprocals:

\[
4 = e^{\frac{hv}{kT}} + 1.
\]

Subtracting 1:

\[
e^{\frac{hv}{kT}} = 3.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\frac{hv}{kT} = \ln(3).
\]

Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{hv}{k \ln(3)}.
\]

Using the constants \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \), \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K} \), and \( v = 1.50 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \), we calculate:

1. Numerator: \( hv = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 1.50 \times 10^{13} = 9.939 \times 10^{-21} \, \mathrm{J} \).
2. Denominator: \( k \ln(3) = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 1.0986 \approx 1.516 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J} \).
3. Temperature: 

\[
T = \frac{9.939 \times 10^{-21}}{1.516 \times 10^{-23}} = 6.55 \times 10^2 \, \mathrm{K} = 655 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

From the options, the closest match is **I: 655 K**.
