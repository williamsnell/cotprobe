Okay, so I've got this question about Hamming codes and parity bits. Hmm, I remember Hamming codes are used for error detection and correction. The question is asking how many parity bits are needed for two cases: when the input information has 8 bits and when it has 4 bits. 

Wait, I think the Hamming code uses a specific formula to determine the number of parity bits. Oh right, the general formula is something like 2^m >= k + m + 1, where m is the number of parity bits and k is the number of data bits. So I need to solve for m in each case.

Let's start with part a) where the input is 8 bits. So k is 8. Plugging into the formula: 2^m >= 8 + m + 1. So 2^m >= m + 9.

I'll try m=4 first. 2^4 is 16. m +9 is 13. 16 >=13, which works. But wait, wait, maybe m=3? 2^3 is 8. 3+9=12. 8 >=12? No, that's not true. So m must be 4. So a) requires 4 parity bits.

Now part b) where k=4. So 2^m >=4 + m +1. So 2^m >=m+5.

Let me try m=3. 2^3 is 8. 3+5=8. 8>=8, which works. What about m=2? 2^2=4. 2+5=7. 4 >=7? No, so m=3 is the minimum. So for 4 bits, we need 3 parity bits.

Wait wait, wait a second. I thought the formula was that the total number of bits (data + parity) is 2^m -1. Or maybe I got the formula wrong. Hamming codes have parity bits at positions that are powers of two. The number of parity bits m is the smallest integer where 2^m >= (data bits + 1). Or wait, wait, maybe it's when 2^m >= (n + m +1), where n is the number of data bits. Oh no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that for Hamming codes, the number of parity bits m is determined by the condition 2^m >= r + m +1, where r is the number of data bits. So for part a, r=8. So 2^m >=8 +m +1 → 2^m >= m +9.

Testing m=4: 16 >= 13 → yes. Testing m=3: 8 >= 12 → no. So m=4.

For part b, r=4. 2^m >=4 +m +1 → 2^m >= m+5.

m=3: 8 >= 8 → yes. m=2: 4 >= 7 → no. So m=3.

So the answers would be a)4, b)3. Looking back at the options, option B is a)4, b)3. So the correct choice is B.

To determine the number of parity bits required for the Hamming code in each case, we use the formula:

\[
2^m \geq k + m + 1
\]

where \( m \) is the number of parity bits and \( k \) is the number of data bits.

### Case (a): \( k = 8 \) bits
Substituting \( k = 8 \) into the formula:

\[
2^m \geq 8 + m + 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2^m \geq m + 9
\]

- For \( m = 4 \): \( 2^4 = 16 \), and \( 4 + 9 = 13 \). Since \( 16 \geq 13 \), \( m = 4 \) works.
- For \( m = 3 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \), and \( 3 + 9 = 12 \). Since \( 8 < 12 \), \( m = 3 \) does not work.

Thus, \( m = 4 \) parity bits are required for 8 data bits.

### Case (b): \( k = 4 \) bits
Substituting \( k = 4 \) into the formula:

\[
2^m \geq 4 + m + 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2^m \geq m + 5
\]

- For \( m = 3 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \), and \( 3 + 5 = 8 \). Since \( 8 \geq 8 \), \( m = 3 \) works.
- For \( m = 2 \): \( 2^2 = 4 \), and \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). Since \( 4 < 7 \), \( m = 2 \) does not work.

Thus, \( m = 3 \) parity bits are required for 4 data bits.

### Final Answer:
The number of parity bits required is **4 for 8 bits and 3 for 4 bits**. This corresponds to **option B**.
