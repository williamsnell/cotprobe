Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about finding the concentrations of H3O+ and OH- in a solution of HF. Hmm, I remember that HF is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The problem gives me the dissociation constant, Kd, as 6.7 × 10^-4. And the solution is 0.10 M HF. Oh, right, and Kw is 1 × 10^-14 at standard conditions.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this. Weak acids typically dissociate according to the equation: HF ↔ H+ + F-. Since HF is a weak acid, only a small portion of it will dissociate. So, I can set up an equilibrium expression.

The initial concentration of HF is 0.10 M. Let's let x be the amount that dissociates. So, at equilibrium, the concentrations would be:
HF: 0.10 - x
H3O+ (which is the same as H+ from HF): x
F-: x

The dissociation constant, Kd, is given by [H+][F-]/[HF]. So, Kd = (x)(x)/(0.10 - x). Since Kd is 6.7e-4, which isn't super small, but not really large either. Wait, but 0.10 is much larger than x, maybe? If x is small compared to 0.10, I can approximate 0.10 - x ≈ 0.10. Let's test that assumption.

So, Kd ≈ x² / 0.10 → x² = Kd * 0.10 = (6.7e-4)(0.10) = 6.7e-5. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(6.7e-5). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(6.7) is around 2.59, so sqrt(6.7e-5) is about 2.59e-2.5, wait no, wait. Actually, 6.7e-5 is 6.7 × 10^-5. The square root of 1e-5 is 1e-2.5, which is 3.16e-3. So 6.7e-5 is 6.7 times that, so x ≈ sqrt(6.7e-5) = sqrt(6.7) * sqrt(1e-5) = 2.59 * 3.16e-3 ≈ 8.18e-3. So around 0.00818 M.

Wait, but 0.00818 is 8.18e-3, and 0.10 is 1e-1. So 8e-3 is about 8% of 0.1. The assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.10 might not hold, so maybe I should do a more precise calculation without approximating.

So the exact equation is x² = Kd (0.10 - x) → x² = 6.7e-4 (0.10 - x)

Expanding that: x² = 6.7e-5 - 6.7e-4 x → x² + 6.7e-4 x - 6.7e-5 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=6.7e-4, c= -6.7e-5.

Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Plugging in the numbers:

b² = (6.7e-4)^2 = (6.7)^2 × 1e-8 = 44.89e-8 = 4.489e-7
4ac = 4 * 1 * (-6.7e-5) = -2.68e-4

So discriminant D = b² -4ac = 4.489e-7 - (4 * 1 * (-6.7e-5)) )

Wait, wait, 4ac is -2.68e-4, so -4ac is 2.68e-4.

So D = 4.489e-7 + 2.68e-4 = approximately 2.680489e-4.

Taking square root of D: sqrt(2.680489e-4) = approx 0.01638.

So x = [ -6.7e-4 ± 0.01638 ] / 2

We take the positive root, so x = ( -6.7e-4 + 0.01638 ) / 2 → (0.01568) / 2 → 0.00784 M.

So x ≈ 7.84e-3 M. That's about 0.00784, which is 7.84e-3. So, higher than my initial approximation because the assumption that x << 0.1 wasn't valid. So the H3O+ concentration is approximately 7.84e-3 M.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x² + (6.7e-4)x - (6.7e-5) = 0.

So a=1, b=6.7e-4, c=-6.7e-5.

Discriminant D = (6.7e-4)^2 + 4*1*(6.7e-5) → Because c is negative, -4ac = +4*6.7e-5.

So D = (6.7e-4)^2 + 4 * 6.7e-5.

Compute each term:

(6.7e-4)^2 = (6.7)^2 * 1e-8 = 44.89e-8 = 4.489e-7.

4 * 6.7e-5 = 2.68e-4.

Adding them: 4.489e-7 + 2.68e-4 = 0.0004689 approximately, because 2.68e-4 is 0.000268, and 4.489e-7 is 0.0000004489. So total is 0.0002684489.

Wait, 0.000268 + 0.0000004489 → 0.0002684489.

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(0.0002684489). Let me compute this.

Well, 0.0164^2 is about 0.00026896. Because 0.0164 * 0.0164 = 0.00026896. So sqrt(D) is approximately 0.0164.

So x = [ -6.7e-4 + 0.0164 ] / 2 → (0.0157)/2 → 0.00785 M.

So same as before, x ≈ 7.85e-3 M.

So [H3O+] is 7.85e-3 M. Let's round to two decimal places, perhaps 7.8e-3.

Wait, but let's check the options. Looking at the options, option A is 6.7e-3 for H3O+ and 1.0e-12 for OH-.

Option J has [H3O+] 7.7e-3 and OH- 1.3e-12. Hmm, but wait, my calculation is 7.8e-3, which isn't exactly any option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

Option G: [H3O+] =8.2e-4, OH- 1.2e-11.

Option I: [H3O+] 7.7e-4, [OH-] 1.3e-11.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, looking again:

The options are:

A: 6.7e-3, 1e-12

B:6.7e-4, 1e-11

C:5.1e-5, 2e-10

D:1e-4, 1e-10

E:2.6e-4, 3.8e-11

F:9e-3, 1.1e-12

G:8.2e-4, 1.2e-11

H:8.1e-5, 1.2e-10

I:7.7e-4, 1.3e-11

J:7.7e-3, 1.3e-12.

Wait, so my calculated [H3O+] is 7.8e-3, which is about 7.8 mM, but the closest option is J, which is 7.7e-3. So maybe J is the one. But wait, let me double-check because perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute x more accurately.

Let me redo the quadratic solution.

a=1, b=6.7e-4, c=-6.7e-5.

Discriminant D = (6.7e-4)^2 -4*1*(-6.7e-5) = (4.489e-7) + 2.68e-4 = 2.680489e-4.

sqrt(D) = sqrt(2.680489e-4) → let's compute it accurately.

So 2.680489e-4 = 0.0002680489.

What's the square root of 0.0002680489?

Well, 0.01638^2 = 0.000268.

Because 0.01638 * 0.01638 = ?

Let me compute 1638 * 1638.

Wait, 1600^2 = 2,560,000. 38^2=1,444. Then cross terms 2*1600*38= 121,600. So 2,560,000 + 121,600 + 1,444 = 2,682,044. So (1638)^2 = 2,682,044 → so 1638e-4 squared is 2682044e-8 → 0.2682044. Wait, but wait, 0.01638 is 1638e-5, so (1638e-5)^2 = (1638)^2 * 1e-10 = 2,682,044e-10 → 2.682044e-6. Wait, that can't be right because 0.01638 squared should be 0.000268.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a calculator approach, but since I can't, I'll proceed. So sqrt(0.0002680489) is approximately 0.01638.

So x = [ -0.00067 + 0.01638 ] / 2 → (0.01571)/2 = 0.007855 M.

So x ≈ 7.855e-3 M.

So [H3O+] is approximately 7.86e-3 M.

Looking at the options, option J has [H3O+] =7.7e-3 M, which is close. But wait, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere because my value is higher than option J's 7.7e-3.

Alternatively, maybe the assumption that x is 7.8e-3 is correct, but perhaps the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Option J is [H3O+] =7.7e-3 M, [OH-] =1.3e-12 M.

If [H3O+] is 7.7e-3, then [OH-] would be Kw / [H3O+] = 1e-14 / 7.7e-3 ≈ 1.299e-12, which is about 1.3e-12. So that matches option J.

But wait, why is my calculated value 7.8e-3 and option J is 7.7e-3? Maybe I should consider more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the quadratic equation more accurately.

x = [ -b + sqrt(D) ] / 2a.

With b=6.7e-4, sqrt(D)=0.01638.

So x = ( -0.00067 + 0.01638 ) / 2 → (0.01571)/2 = 0.007855 M.

Which is 7.855e-3 M, which rounds to 7.86e-3.

But none of the options exactly match this. Looking at the options, the closest is J:7.7e-3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation? Or maybe the correct approach was to approximate x as negligible compared to 0.10 M, leading to x = sqrt(6.7e-4 * 0.10) = sqrt(6.7e-5) ≈ 8.18e-3 M.

Wait, but that's higher than the quadratic solution. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation method without the quadratic gives a value of 8.18e-3. But in the options, the closest is J:7.7e-3. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using a more precise method.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial approximation of x being 8.18e-3 is about 8% of 0.10. So the 5% rule says that if the percentage is more than 5%, the assumption isn't valid, so the quadratic method is better.

In this case, 8% is just above, so the quadratic gives a more accurate result. So perhaps the correct [H3O+] is approximately 7.86e-3 M.

But looking at the options, option J is 7.7e-3. Maybe I should check what the Kw gives for [OH-].

If [H3O+] is 7.7e-3, then [OH-] is 1e-14 / 7.7e-3 ≈ 1.298e-12 ≈ 1.3e-12 M, which matches option J.

Alternatively, if [H3O+] is 7.86e-3, then [OH-] is 1e-14 / 7.86e-3 ≈ 1.272e-12, which is closer to 1.3e-12 as well.

Wait, but perhaps there's a mistake in the way I set up the equation. Let me think again about the dissociation.

Wait, HF dissociates into H+ and F-. So the concentration of H+ is x, which is the same as [H3O+], and [F-] is also x. So the Kd is correct as (x^2)/(0.10 -x).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states K_diss is 6.7e-4, which is the same as Ka for HF, correct. So that part is right.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me list the options:

A: [H3O+] =6.7e-3 → 0.0067 M. That's lower than our calculated value, so probably not.

F: [H3O+] =9e-3 → 0.009 M, higher than our value.

J:7.7e-3 → 0.0077 M, which is close to our calculated 0.00786.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is J, assuming some rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation method, ignoring x in the denominator. Let's try that approach again to see what value we get.

Using approximation: Kd = x² / 0.10 → x² = Kd * 0.10 = 6.7e-4 * 0.10 = 6.7e-5 → x = sqrt(6.7e-5) ≈ 8.18e-3 M. So [H3O+] would be 0.00818 M, which is 8.18e-3, which is not exactly any option. The closest is option F, which is 9e-3, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is not present, but perhaps option J is the closest.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is [H3O+] =7.7e-3, which is 0.0077 M. That's slightly lower than 0.00786, but perhaps due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, let's recalculate the quadratic solution more accurately.

Given Kd =6.7e-4, initial concentration 0.10 M.

Equation: x² + (6.7e-4)x - (6.7e-5) = 0

Compute discriminant D = (6.7e-4)^2 +4*6.7e-5.

6.7e-4 squared is (6.7)^2 * (1e-4)^2 = 44.89 * 1e-8 = 4.489e-7.

4 * 6.7e-5 is 2.68e-4.

So D = 4.489e-7 + 2.68e-4 = 0.0004689 (since 2.68e-4 is 0.000268 and 4.489e-7 is 0.0000004489).

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(0.0004689) ≈ 0.02166? Wait, no, because 0.02166 squared is about 0.000469.

Wait, 0.02166^2 = (0.02)^2 + 2*(0.02)*(0.00166) + (0.00166)^2 = 0.0004 + 0.0000664 + 0.000002756 ≈ 0.000468.

Wait, so sqrt(0.0004689) is approximately 0.02166.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 0.016^2 is 0.000256, and 0.021^2 is 0.000441. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Because 0.01638^2 is 0.000268, but D is 0.0004689, so sqrt(D) is higher than 0.0216.

Wait, no, wait, 0.02166 is 2.166e-2. Let's compute 0.02166^2: (0.02 + 0.00166)^2
