Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the assessed valuation of Mrs. Valdez's home. Hmm, let's read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, Mrs. Valdez pays a property tax of 2.432 percent on her home. Additionally, there's a collection fee which is 1% of the tax. The total charge she has to pay is $70.62. I need to find the assessed valuation, which I think is the value of her home that these taxes and fees are based on.

Alright, let's break this down. The property tax is 2.432% of the assessed value. Let's call the assessed value "AV" for short. So the tax would be AV multiplied by 2.432%, which is the same as AV times 0.02432.

Then there's a collection fee. The fee is 1% of the tax. So first, I calculate the tax, then take 1% of that. So the collection fee would be 0.01 times the tax amount, which is 0.01 * (AV * 0.02432). 

The total charge she pays is the sum of the tax and the collection fee. So total charge = tax + collection fee. That can be written as:

Total = (AV * 0.02432) + (AV * 0.02432 * 0.01)

Wait, maybe I can factor this out. Let me think. The total is the tax plus 1% of the tax, which is the same as the tax multiplied by 1.01. Because 100% of the tax plus 1% more is 101% of the tax.

So, total = AV * 0.02432 * 1.01

And we know the total is $70.62. So I can set up the equation:

AV * 0.02432 * 1.01 = 70.62

I need to solve for AV. Let me compute 0.02432 * 1.01 first.

Calculating that: 0.02432 * 1.01. Hmm, let's see. 0.02432 * 1 is 0.02432. 0.02432 * 0.01 is 0.0002432. Adding them together gives 0.0245632.

So now the equation is AV * 0.0245632 = 70.62.

To find AV, I'll divide both sides by 0.0245632.

AV = 70.62 / 0.0245632

Hmm, let me do this division. I'm not great at calculating without a calculator, but maybe I can approximate it.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can represent this as fractions or use cross-multiplication. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 70.62 divided by 0.0245632.

Let me think about the steps:

Dividing by a decimal. Maybe I can convert it to a fraction or adjust the decimal places to make it easier.

But perhaps a better approach is to set it up as:

AV = 70.62 / (0.02432 * 1.01)

Wait, I already calculated 0.02432 *1.01 as 0.0245632, so same thing.

So AV = 70.62 / 0.0245632

To compute this, let's see. Maybe I can write both numerator and denominator multiplied by 10^8 to eliminate decimals.

70.62 * 10^8 = 7062 * 10^4 = 70,620,000.

Wait, 0.0245632 is 2.45632e-2. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 7062 / 0.245632, but wait, because 0.0245632 is 2.45632 × 10^-2, so 70.62 / 0.0245632 = (70.62 * 100) / 2.45632 = 7062 / 2.45632.

Wait, 70.62 divided by 0.0245632 equals the same as 7062 divided by 0.245632 (because I multiplied numerator and denominator by 100 to move the decimal two places). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, 0.0245632 is the same as 2.45632 × 10^-2. So:

70.62 / (2.45632 × 10^-2) = (70.62 / 2.45632) × 10^2.

So let's compute 70.62 divided by 2.45632 first.

Hmm, 2.45632 times 28 is approximately 70. Because 2.45632 * 28 = let's compute that.

2.45632 * 20 is 49.1264.

2.45632 *8 is 19.65056.

So adding those, 49.1264 +19.65056 = 68.77696.

That's 2.45632 *28 = ~68.78. But I have 70.62 as the numerator.

So 70.62 - 68.77696 = 1.84304.

So that's 28 with some remainder. How much more?

Each additional 1 in the multiplier gives 2.45632.

So 1.84304 divided by 2.45632 is approximately 0.75. Because 2.45632 * 0.75 is about 1.842.

So 28.75 would give me approximately 70.62. Therefore, 70.62 / 2.45632 ≈28.75.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's precise. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach.

Wait, 2.45632 × 28.75:

Let me compute 2.45632 * 28 = 68.77696.

2.45632 * 0.75 = 1.84224.

Adding them gives 68.77696 +1.84224 = 70.6192.

Which is very close to 70.62. So yes, 28.75.

So going back, AV = (70.62 / 2.45632) × 10^2.

Wait, no, wait. Earlier step:

70.62 / 0.0245632 = (70.62 / 2.45632) ×10^2.

Wait, because 0.0245632 = 2.45632 × 10^-2.

So 70.62 / (2.45632 × 10^-2) ) = (70.62 / 2.45632) ) × 10^2.

Since we found that 70.62 /2.45632 ≈28.75.

So AV ≈28.75 × 100 = 2875.

Wait, that would make AV $2,875. Let me check the options. Option E is $2,875. So is that the answer?

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes when you approximate, you might miss a little.

Wait, let's compute 2.45632 * 28.75.

2.45632 * 28 = 68.77696.

2.45632 * 0.75 = 1.84224.

68.77696 +1.84224 =70.6192. So 28.75 gives 70.6192.

But the numerator is 70.62, which is 0.0008 more. So perhaps the actual value is a bit higher than 28.75.

So let's see, 28.75 gives 70.6192. We need 70.62, which is 0.0008 more.

So 0.0008 /2.45632 ≈0.000326.

So the multiplier would be approximately 28.75 + 0.000326 ≈28.750326.

So when we multiply by 100, AV is approximately 2875.0326, which is about $2,875.03.

Looking at the options, option E is $2,875.

Wait, but let me check with the exact calculation to be sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the equation step by step.

Let me write down the equation again.

Total = tax + collection fee.

Tax = AV * 0.02432.

Collection fee = tax * 0.01 = AV * 0.02432 * 0.01.

So total = AV*(0.02432 + 0.02432*0.01) = AV*(0.02432*(1 +0.01))= AV *0.02432*1.01.

Which is AV *0.0245632.

So AV =70.62 /0.0245632.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

Maybe I can write it as 70.62 ÷ 0.0245632.

Alternatively, let me set it up as a fraction: 70.62 /0.0245632.

Let me try to compute this using long division.

But maybe that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate.

So 0.0245632 is approximately 0.02456.

70.62 /0.02456 = ?

I can write this as 70.62 * (1/0.02456).

1/0.02456 is approximately 40.72.

Because 0.02456 *40 = 0.9824.

0.02456 *40.72 = ?

Wait, 40 *0.02456=0.9824.

0.72 *0.02456: 0.7 *0.02456=0.017192, 0.02 *0.02456=0.0004912. So total 0.017192 +0.0004912=0.0176832.

So 0.02456 *40.72=0.9824 +0.0176832=1.0000832.

So 1/0.02456 ≈40.72.

So 70.62 *40.72 = ?

70 *40.72 =2850.4.

0.62 *40.72=25.3664.

So total is 2850.4 +25.3664=2875.7664.

So approximately 2875.77.

Which is about $2,875.77. So looking at the options, the closest is E: $2,875.

But wait, the total comes to approximately 2875.77, which is just over 2875. Now, perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly different value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 70.62 divided by 0.0245632 exactly.

Wait, 0.0245632 is 245632/10000000.

So 70.62 is 7062/100.

So (7062/100) ÷ (245632/10000000) ) = (7062/100) * (10000000/245632) )

Simplify this.

7062 * 10000000 =7062 *10^7 =7.062e10.

Denominator: 100 *245632=24,563,200=2.45632e7.

So (7.062e10) / (2.45632e7) = (7.062 /2.45632) )e3.

Because 1e10 /1e7=1e3=1000.

So 7.062 /2.45632= approximately 2.875.

Wait, 2.45632 *2.875= Let's compute that.

2.45632 *2 =4.91264.

2.45632 *0.8=1.965056.

2.45632 *0.075=0.184224.

Adding them: 4.91264 +1.965056=6.877696 +0.184224=7.06192.

So 2.45632 *2.875=7.06192.

Which is very close to 7.062.

So 7.062 /2.45632 ≈2.875.

So the result is 2.875e3=2,875.

So AV is $2,875, which is option E.

Wait, but earlier I thought AV was approximately 2875.77. Hmm, but the exact calculation here says 2,875.

Wait, perhaps because I used 7.062/2.45632=2.875, which gives the exact AV. So in that case, the correct answer is E: $2,875.

To determine the assessed valuation (AV) of Mrs. Valdez's home, we start by noting that the total charge includes both the property tax and a collection fee. The property tax rate is 2.432%, and the collection fee is 1% of the tax. The total charge is given as $70.62.

1. **Property Tax Calculation**:  
   The property tax is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Tax} = AV \times 0.02432
   \]

2. **Collection Fee Calculation**:  
   The collection fee is 1% of the tax:  
   \[
   \text{Collection Fee} = \text{Tax} \times 0.01 = AV \times 0.02432 \times 0.01
   \]

3. **Total Charge**:  
   The total charge is the sum of the tax and the collection fee:  
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Tax} + \text{Collection Fee} = AV \times 0.02432 + AV \times 0.02432 \times 0.01
   \]  
   Factoring out the tax:  
   \[
   \text{Total} = AV \times 0.02432 \times (1 + 0.01) = AV \times 0.02432 \times 1.01
   \]  
   Simplifying further:  
   \[
   \text{Total} = AV \times 0.0245632
   \]

4. **Solving for AV**:  
   The total charge is given as $70.62. Substituting this into the equation:  
   \[
   70.62 = AV \times 0.0245632
   \]  
   To find \( AV \), divide both sides by 0.0245632:  
   \[
   AV = \frac{70.62}{0.0245632}
   \]

5. **Performing the Division**:  
   Using approximations and calculations, it is determined that:  
   \[
   AV \approx 2,875
   \]

6. **Verification**:  
   The calculations confirm that the assessed valuation is approximately $2,875, which matches option E.

**Answer: E**
