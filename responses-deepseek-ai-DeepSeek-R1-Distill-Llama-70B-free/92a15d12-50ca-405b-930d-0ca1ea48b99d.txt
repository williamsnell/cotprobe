Question:

A property owner who owner her property in fee simple leased a three-story house and the 21 -acre tract upon which it stood to a friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a cousin, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the cousin would pay the owner the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The owner never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the owner conveyed her property interest in the premises to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority filed proceedings to condemn two acres of the tract for the purpose of highway construction. As a result, the cousin contacted the developer and informed him that he should be entitled to an apportioned reduction in the rental. After the developer refused to reduce the rent, the cousin brings an action to have his rent apportioned pro tanto. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the developer, although the cousin would be entitled to terminate the lease.
B: the developer, because the cousin would be held to the original leasehold contract.
C: the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.
D: the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.

Okay, so I have this law question about property and leases. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.

So, the property owner leased a three-story house and a 21-acre tract to a friend for 10 years. The lease terms include a monthly rent of $300 and the friend has to pay taxes during the lease. Also, the lease says the friend can't assign or sublease without permission. 

Then, after two years, the friend assigns his leasehold interest to his cousin, even though the lease prohibited assignments. The assignment says the cousin will pay the $300 rent but doesn't mention taxes. The owner didn't object to this assignment. So, I'm thinking maybe the owner's silence could mean she accepted the assignment, but the lease terms say no assignments, so does that matter?

Six months later, the owner sold the property to a developer. So now the developer is the new owner. Then, the state wants to condemn two acres for a highway. The cousin is asking for a reduction in rent because part of the land is being taken. The developer refused, so the cousin is suing for an apportionment of the rent.

The question is whether the cousin is entitled to this reduction. The options are A to D, with various reasons.

I remember that when part of the leased property is condemned through eminent domain, the rent can be apportioned. But there's a condition: the apportionment only happens if the lease is apportionable. Also, the tenant must still be in possession lawfully. Wait, but in this case, the lease was assigned without permission. So, does that affect the cousin's right to apportionment?

The lease originally prohibited assignment. So when the friend assigned to the cousin, that might be a breach of the lease. But the owner didn't object, which could mean she accepted the assignment. If the owner accepted, then the cousin is now the lessee, and the lease terms apply. But wait, the lease required the lessee to pay taxes, and the assignment was silent on that. So does that mean the cousin didn't take on that obligation, or is it still part of the lease?

But the main issue here is the condemnation. So when part of the land is taken, does the rent get reduced proportionally? I think under the doctrine of apportionment, if the lease is apportionable (like if it's a long-term lease of land), then the rent abates proportionally. But if the tenant isn't lawfully in possession, maybe they can't claim apportionment.

Wait, the cousin is in possession because the assignment happened, and the owner didn't object. So maybe the assignment was effective despite the lease's terms, because the owner accepted it by not objecting. So the cousin is a lawful tenant now.

Another point is that when the owner sold to the developer, the developer steps into the owner's shoes. So the developer is now the landlord, and the lease terms still apply. So the cousin's obligation to pay rent is to the developer now.

When the state condemns two acres, the cousin is losing part of the leased premises. So under the doctrine of eminent domain, the lease is apportioned, and the rent is reduced by the proportionate value of the condemned land. So the cousin should get a reduction in rent.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the cousin is entitled because his leasehold interest's value was reduced. Option D says because eminent domain causes apportionment.

Wait, I think the doctrine is that the lease is apportioned, so the rent is reduced. So whether the lease is apportionable is key. Since it's a 10-year lease of land and a house, which is a type that's apportionable. So when part is taken, the rent is apportioned pro tanto, meaning proportionally.

So the cousin should win, so the judgment should be for the cousin. Looking back, option C says because the value was reduced, and D says because of eminent domain's apportionment.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Option D's reasoning is about eminent domain operating as apportionment, which is the correct legal principle. Because when eminent domain takes part of the leased premises, the lease is apportioned, so the rent is reduced accordingly. So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, another angle: the assignment was prohibited. If the assignment was invalid, the cousin isn't a lawful tenant. But the owner didn't object, which might mean the assignment was accepted, making the cousin a tenant. So the cousin is a proper tenant and can claim apportionment.

So yes, the answer should be D. Or maybe C? No, D is about the apportionment due to eminent domain. So the correct answer is D.

The scenario involves a property owner who leased a three-story house and a 21-acre tract to a friend for 10 years. The lease prohibited assignment or subleasing and required the friend to pay $300 monthly rent and taxes. The friend assigned the lease to a cousin without permission, but the owner did not object. The assignment obligated the cousin to pay the $300 rent but was silent on taxes. Later, the owner sold the property to a developer, who became the new landlord. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority condemned two acres for highway construction, and the cousin sought a reduction in rent.

Key legal principles include the following:

1. **Assignment and Lease enforceability**: Although the lease prohibited assignment, the owner's failure to object could imply acceptance, making the cousin a lawful tenant. The cousin would then be subject to the lease terms, including the obligation to pay rent.

2. **Apportionment of Rent**: Under the doctrine of apportionment, when part of the leased premises is condemned through eminent domain, the rent may be reduced proportionally if the lease is apportionable. A long-term lease of land and a house is typically apportionable.

3. **Effect of Eminent Domain**: Eminent domain operates to apportion the lease, reducing the rent proportionally to reflect the loss of the condemned portion of the property. This is the correct legal principle supporting the cousin's claim.

Given these principles, the cousin is entitled to an apportioned reduction in rent due to the condemnation of two acres. The correct reasoning is that eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.
