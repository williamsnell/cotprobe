Okay, so I've got this question about the percentage of survey respondents from Mexico who reported paying a bribe in the last year to access public services. The options are from A to J, each with different percentages. I'm not exactly sure about the exact figure, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Mexico has had issues with corruption, so the percentage might be on the higher side. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I think there was a survey called the Global Corruption Barometer or something like that. Maybe that's where this data comes from.

Wait, the question is about 2017 specifically. I'm trying to recall if there were any reports around that time. I think Transparency International does these surveys. From what I remember, Mexico's bribery rates have been relatively high compared to some other countries, but I'm not sure how high.

Looking at the options, the highest are 91% (B) and 81% (D). Then there's 71% (E), 61% (G), and lower ones. I think the figure I heard was around 70% or so. Maybe 71%? Or was it a bit higher?

Another angle: sometimes these surveys can vary. Let me think about other countries for comparison. For example, I remember that in some African countries, the percentages are even higher, like 80% or more. But Mexico isn't typically in that range. Maybe it's around 60-70%.

Wait, another thought. I think in 2017, there was a report stating that about two-thirds of Mexicans reported paying a bribe. Two-thirds is roughly 66.6%, so looking at the options, 61% is G and 71% is E. So maybe E is the answer.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, could it be higher? I think some sources might have different numbers. Maybe 71% is the correct one. Or perhaps it's lower. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I recall that in some years, the percentage was around 30-40%, but that seems lower than what I remember for Mexico. The options H and I are 31% and 41%, which are lower, but I think the actual figure is higher.

Wait, another approach: the question lists several public services, like education, judiciary, medical, police, etc. Accessing these services often involves more interaction with officials, which can lead to higher bribery rates. So the percentage is likely higher than average.

So putting it all together, I'm leaning towards 71% being the correct answer, which is option E. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes the exact number can vary based on the survey's scope and sample size.

The correct answer is E: 71%.
