Okay, so I've got this question about the reserve ratio and money creation. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks must keep as reserves rather than lend out. So if the reserve ratio is 10%, that means the bank can lend out 90% of each deposit.

The question says a new customer deposits $500. I think the process is that the bank takes that $500 and can lend out 90% of it. Wait, no, wait. The reserve ratio is the fraction they must keep. So if it's 10%, they must keep $50 as reserves (10% of 500) and can lend out the remaining $450. 

But wait, money creation isn't just about the first loan. It's a multiplier effect. Each time the money is lent out, it becomes someone else's deposit, and the process repeats. So the initial deposit is $500, and the maximum money created is the total of all possible loans made from this.

I think the formula is the money multiplier, which is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So it's 1 / 0.10 = 10. Multiply that by the initial deposit of $500. So 500 * 10 = $5,000. 

Wait, but wait another second. Let me make sure I'm not confusing it. The reserve ratio is the required reserve ratio, right? So the money multiplier formula is indeed 1/required reserve ratio. So yes, 1/0.10 is 10, so 500 *10 would be $5,000. That's the maximum amount of money created through the banking system.

Looking at the options, option A is $5,000. So the answer should be A.

The reserve ratio determines the fraction of deposits that banks must hold as reserves, with the remainder available for lending. At a 10% reserve ratio, a $500 deposit allows the bank to lend out $450 initially (90% of $500). However, this lending becomes a new deposit elsewhere, and the process repeats, creating a multiplier effect.

The money multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{\text{reserve ratio}} \), which equals \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \). Multiplying this by the initial deposit of $500 gives \( 500 \times 10 = \$5,000 \), representing the total amount of money created.

**Answer: A**
