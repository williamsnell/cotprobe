Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The scenario is a shopper suing the mall owner for negligence after slipping and falling. The shopper's housekeeper testified about two things: first, that the shopper was bedridden and couldn't work for a month due to a sprained back. Second, the housekeeper testified about a statement the shopper made a week after returning home, saying her back was in excruciating pain and she might never stand again.

The mall's counsel moved to strike this testimony. The question is whether that motion should be granted or denied, and why.

First, I need to identify what kind of evidence is being presented here. The housekeeper is testifying about what the shopper said. So that's hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. So I need to think about which exceptions might apply here.

The shopper's statement describes her current physical conditionâ€”her back pain. I remember that there's an exception for statements concerning the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. Specifically, under FRE 803(3), such statements are admissible if they describe the declarant's condition at the time.

Wait, but there's another exception for present bodily condition. Oh, but wait, the timing matters. The statement was made a week after the incident. So is that too much time to still qualify as a present condition?

Hmm. I think that for the statement to be admissible under the present bodily condition exception, it needs to relate to the condition at the time of the statement. So if she made the statement a week after the fall, but it's about her current pain at that time, it should still be admissible.

Alternatively, could this be an excited utterance? Excited utterances are admissible under 803(2). But excited utterances are made in the heat of the moment, under stress of the event. Here, the statement was made a week later, so probably not an excited utterance. The shopper had time to reflect, so it's less likely to be an excited utterance.

Another possibility is the statement for medical treatment. Under 803(4), statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are admissible. But here, the statement was made to the housekeeper, not a medical professional. So that exception probably doesn't apply.

What about present sense impression? That's 803(1), which requires the statement to be made while perceiving an event or immediately thereafter. Again, a week later likely doesn't qualify.

Then, looking at the options, the statement's admissibility hinges on whether it fits an exception. The housekeeper's testimony about the shopper's statement is hearsay unless an exception applies.

So the statement describes the shopper's current physical condition at the time of the statement (a week after the incident). Therefore, it should fall under the present bodily condition exception, which is FRE 803(3). So the testimony shouldn't be struck because it's admissible under this exception.

Wait, but wait a second. I think the present bodily condition exception is actually covered under a different rule. Let me double-check. Oh right, the present sense impression is 803(1), and the statement about a then-existing condition is 803(3). So the shopper's statement about her back pain would fit under 803(3) because it's about her condition at the time she made the statement.

So the housekeeper's testimony includes the shopper's statement, which is hearsay but within the 803(3) exception. Therefore, the motion to strike should be denied.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the statement is admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition. That would be correct because it's about her then-current state.

Option C suggests excited utterance, but as discussed, probably not. Option D is adoptive admission, but that's when the party adopts someone else's statement, which doesn't apply here.

So the correct answer should be F: denied because admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.

Wait, but wait another point. The shopper is the plaintiff, and she made the statement. So the statement is being offered by the shopper (through the housekeeper) to prove her own pain. So it's a party's own statement, which is not hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2)(A) because it's the declarant's own statement offered by the party. Wait, no, because the declarant is the shopper, and she is the party, so her own statement would be admissible as a party admission. Oh, wait, that's another angle.

Wait, under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's own statement. So if the shopper made the statement, and she's the plaintiff, then when she offers it through the housekeeper, it's her own statement and thus not hearsay. Because she's a party, any of her statements are admissible as party admissions, regardless of exceptions.

Wait, but this is a civil case, and the shopper is the plaintiff. She's offering her own statement through the housekeeper. So under 801(d)(2)(A), the statement is not hearsay because it's a statement by a party-opponent. Wait, no, because the shopper is the party offering it, so it's a statement by the party herself. So it's an admission of a party-opponent under 801(d)(2)(A), but wait, no. Because 801(d)(2)(A) is for statements offered against a party. Here, the shopper is the one offering it, so it's not being offered against her. So it's not an opposing party's statement, it's her own.

Wait, so maybe the statement is not hearsay at all because when a party offers their own statement, it's not hearsay. Because hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for truth by someone else. But when the declarant is the party themselves, and they're offering it, it's not hearsay unless it's being offered for some other purpose.

Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me clarify. The housekeeper is testifying about what the shopper said. If the shopper is the plaintiff, and she is offering her own prior statement through the housekeeper, then it's an admission by a party-opponent only if it's being offered against her, which it isn't. So in this case, the statement is being offered by the shopper to prove her pain, so it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, no, the definition of hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the shopper's statement is being offered for the truth (that her back hurt), so it's hearsay. But since the shopper is the declarant, and she's a party, her own statement is not hearsay under 801(d)(2)(A) only when it's being offered against her. Since she's offering it herself, it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

So back to the exceptions. The statement is about her then-existing physical condition, so it falls under 803(3), making it admissible. So the housekeeper's testimony about the statement is admissible as a present bodily condition statement.

So the options are F and maybe C, but C is excited utterance, which I think doesn't apply. So the correct answer is F: denied because it's a declaration of present bodily condition.

Looking at the options, option F is "denied, because the shopper's statement would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition." So that's the right choice.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the housekeeper's testimony regarding the shopper's statement about her physical condition after the fall. The key issue is whether the statement qualifies as hearsay and, if so, whether it falls under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

The shopper's statement, "My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating. It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again," is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., to prove the shopper's pain and condition). This makes it hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801. However, hearsay is admissible if it falls under a recognized exception.

One relevant exception is FRE 803(3), which allows statements concerning the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. The shopper's statement describes her physical condition at the time it was made (a week after the fall), making it admissible under this exception. While other exceptions, such as excited utterance (FRE 803(2)) or present sense impression (FRE 803(1)), might seem applicable at first glance, they are less likely because the statement was made a week after the incident, allowing time for reflection.

Additionally, the statement could be considered a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), as it is the shopper's own statement. However, since the shopper is the one offering the statement to prove her condition, the focus remains on the hearsay exception under FRE 803(3).

Given this analysis, the motion to strike should be denied because the shopper's statement is admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition under FRE 803(3).
