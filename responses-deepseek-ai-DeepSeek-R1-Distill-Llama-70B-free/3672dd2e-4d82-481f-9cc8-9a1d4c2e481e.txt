Question:

Dr. Ramchandran found that his patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities in their teeth as those who didn't. After interviewing the dentist, a local newswriter reports that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities. Based on the dentist's research, which of the following statements is true?

Options:

A: The writer's statement would be justified if at least half of the patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
B: If a minimum of 200 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
C: No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.
D: The writer's statement would only be justified if no patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
E: The writer's statement could only be justified if the study was conducted over a prolonged period of time.
F: At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.
G: If all the patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
I: If only the patients who brushed their teeth after lunch were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
J: If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a study Dr. Ramchandran did on tooth brushing and cavities. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says that Dr. Ramchandran found that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20th the number of cavities compared to those who didn't. Then a newswriter reports that brushing after lunch prevents cavities. The question is asking which statement is true based on the dentist's research.

So, the options are A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's think about this.

First, I remember that correlation doesn't imply causation. Just because two things are related doesn't mean one causes the other. The study probably found an association between brushing after lunch and fewer cavities, but does that mean brushing caused the reduction?

Wait, the study was comparing two groups: one that brushed after lunch and one that didn't. So it's a comparative study. But how was this study conducted? Was it a randomized controlled trial, or just observational?

If it's observational, then there might be confounding variables. For example, people who brush after lunch might also have other good oral hygiene habits, like brushing twice a day or using fluoride toothpaste. So their lower cavity rate might be due to those other factors, not just the after-lunch brushing.

So the dentist's research shows an association, but the newswriter is making a causal claim: brushing prevents cavities. That's a big jump. The study alone doesn't prove causation unless it's a well-designed experiment controlling for other variables.

Now looking at the options:

Option A says the writer's statement is justified if at least half the patients brushed. Hmm, the proportion of patients brushing doesn't necessarily validate causation. It's more about sample size and study design.

Option B: If 200 patients were studied, justified. But again, sample size alone doesn't ensure the conclusion is valid. It could be a small effect size or the study might not control for variables.

Option C: No matter how many participants, the statement isn't justified. This makes me think about whether the study design supports causation. If the study was just observational without controlling for variables, then no matter the sample size, you can't prove causation. So this might be correct.

Option D: Only justified if no patients brushed. That doesn't make sense. If no one brushed, there's no comparison group.

Option E: Needs a prolonged period. Maybe, but the question doesnâ€™t mention anything about the study duration. It could relate to seeing long-term effects, but the main issue is causation, not timing.

Options F, G, H, J: These all talk about sample sizes (100, all, etc.) but as I thought earlier, sample size isn't the main issue here. It's the study design.

Option I: If only the brushing group was studied, you can't compare. So that's not valid either.

So looking back, the key issue is whether the study supports a causal conclusion. If the research was just an observational study without controlling for other factors, then the writer's statement about prevention isn't justified, regardless of sample size.

Therefore, option C says no matter how many participants, the statement isn't justified. That seems correct because the study's design might not support causation.

The question revolves around Dr. Ramchandran's study, which found that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20th the number of cavities compared to those who didn't. A newswriter then claims that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities. The task is to determine which statement is true based on the dentist's research.

The key issue is whether the study supports a causal conclusion. Correlation does not imply causation, and the study's design is critical. If the research was observational, it may not control for confounding variables, such as other oral hygiene habits, which could explain the lower cavity rate in the brushing group. Without a well-designed randomized controlled trial, the claim that brushing after lunch prevents cavities cannot be definitively justified.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, F, G, H, J**: These focus on sample size, but sample size alone does not address the lack of causal evidence if the study design is flawed.
- **D**: This is illogical, as a study with no brushing group cannot draw conclusions about brushing.
- **E**: While study duration might affect long-term insights, the question focuses on causation, not timing.
- **I**: Studying only the brushing group eliminates the comparison group, making this option invalid.
- **C**: This is correct because, regardless of the number of participants, the study's design (likely observational) does not justify a causal claim about prevention.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.**
