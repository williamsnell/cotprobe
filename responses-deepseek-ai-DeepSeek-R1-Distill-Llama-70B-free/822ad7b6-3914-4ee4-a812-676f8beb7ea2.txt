Okay, so I have this question about finding the Laplace transform of f(t) = t for t > 0. Hmm, Laplace transforms... I remember they're used a lot in engineering and physics to solve differential equations. The Laplace transform is like a function that converts a time-domain function into a complex frequency-domain representation. 

Wait, the Laplace transform formula is an integral from zero to infinity of e^(-st) times f(t) dt. So L{f(t)} = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) f(t) dt. Right.

In this case, f(t) is t, so I need to compute the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) multiplied by t dt. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t e^(-st) dt. 

I think I remember that integrals of t e^(-st) can be solved by integration by parts. Integration by parts is where you let u be a part of the integrand and dv be the other part. The formula is ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

So let me set u = t, which would make du = dt. Then dv would be e^(-st) dt, which means v is the integral of e^(-st) dt. The integral of e^(-st) is (-1/s) e^(-st), right? So v = (-1/s) e^(-st).

Putting it into the integration by parts formula: uv is t * (-1/s) e^(-st), and then minus the integral of v du, which is (-1/s) e^(-st) dt.

So the integral becomes [ -t e^(-st) / s ] from 0 to ∞ minus ∫ (-1/s) e^(-st) dt. 

Wait, let me write that out. The first term is evaluated from 0 to ∞. Let's plug in the limits. As t approaches infinity, e^(-st) goes to zero, assuming s is positive, which it usually is in Laplace transforms. So the term at infinity is zero. At t=0, it's zero because t is zero. So the first part [uv] is zero minus zero, which is zero.

So now the integral is 0 minus the integral of (-1/s) e^(-st) dt. Which simplifies to (1/s) ∫ e^(-st) dt. The integral of e^(-st) from 0 to ∞ is [ (-1/s) e^(-st) ] from 0 to ∞. 

Again, evaluating at infinity, e^(-st) is zero, and at zero, it's 1. So it becomes (1/s) * [0 - (-1/s)(1 - 0)] ) → (1/s) * (1/s) ) → 1/s².

Wait, let me double-check. So after integration by parts, the result is (1/s) times the integral of e^(-st) dt. The integral of e^(-st) from 0 to inf is 1/s. So 1/s multiplied by 1/s is 1/s². So the Laplace transform of t is 1/s².

Looking back at the options, option E is L{t} = 1/s². So the correct answer should be E.

Alternatively, I remember from Laplace transform tables that L{t^n} is n! / s^(n+1). For n=1, it's 1! / s^2, which is 1/s². So that confirms it.

To find the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = t \) for \( t > 0 \), we use the definition of the Laplace transform:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) \, dt.
\]

Substituting \( f(t) = t \), the integral becomes:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t\} = \int_0^\infty t e^{-st} \, dt.
\]

To evaluate this integral, we use integration by parts. Let:

\[
u = t \quad \text{and} \quad dv = e^{-st} dt.
\]

Then:

\[
du = dt \quad \text{and} \quad v = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st}.
\]

Applying integration by parts:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du,
\]

we get:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t\} = \left[ -\frac{t}{s} e^{-st} \right]_0^\infty + \frac{1}{s} \int_0^\infty e^{-st} \, dt.
\]

The first term, \( \left[ -\frac{t}{s} e^{-st} \right]_0^\infty \), evaluates to zero because \( e^{-st} \to 0 \) as \( t \to \infty \), and \( t = 0 \) at the lower limit. The remaining integral is:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t\} = \frac{1}{s} \int_0^\infty e^{-st} \, dt.
\]

The integral of \( e^{-st} \) is:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-st} \, dt = \frac{1}{s}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t\} = \frac{1}{s} \cdot \frac{1}{s} = \frac{1}{s^2}.
\]

From Laplace transform tables, we also know that \( \mathcal{L}\{t^n\} = \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \). For \( n = 1 \), this gives \( \mathcal{L}\{t\} = \frac{1}{s^2} \), confirming the result.

The correct answer is:

**E: \( \mathcal{L}\{t\} = \frac{1}{s^2} \).**
