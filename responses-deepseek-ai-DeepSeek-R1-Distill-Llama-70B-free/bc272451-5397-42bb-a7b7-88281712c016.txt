Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about an MA(1) series and autocovariance. Hmm, I remember that MA stands for Moving Average model. MA(1) means it's a first-order moving average process. The question says it has zero mean and a moving average coefficient of 0.4. I need to find the autocovariance at lag 1.

Wait, what's autocovariance again? Oh right, autocovariance measures how much two values at different times are related. For lag 1, it's between t and t-1. In time series, it's often denoted as γ(k), where k is the lag.

I think for an MA(q) model, the autocovariance has a specific structure. Let's recall: an MA(1) process is like ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}, where θ is the coefficient. Since the mean is zero, the expected value is zero.

So the general formula for the autocovariance at lag k is γ(k) = E[(X_t - μ)(X_{t+k} - μ)]. But since μ is zero, it's just E[X_t X_{t+k}].

For an MA(1) model, X_t = ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}.

So for k=0, the variance is E[X_t^2] = Var(ε_t) + θ^2 Var(ε_{t-1}) + 2θ E[ε_t ε_{t-1}]. But since ε's are uncorrelated, E[ε_t ε_{t-1}] is zero. So Var(X_t) = Var(ε) (1 + θ²).

Now for k=1, the autocovariance γ(1) = E[X_t X_{t-1}]. Let's write X_t and X_{t-1}:

X_t = ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}
X_{t-1} = ε_{t-1} + θ ε_{t-2}

Multiply them: X_t X_{t-1} = ε_t ε_{t-1} + θ ε_t ε_{t-2} + θ ε_{t-1}^2 + θ² ε_{t-1} ε_{t-2}

Taking expectation, E[ε_t ε_{t-1}] is zero because they're uncorrelated. Similarly, E[ε_t ε_{t-2}] is zero. What about E[ε_{t-1}^2]? That's Var(ε) because ε has zero mean. So E[X_t X_{t-1}] = θ Var(ε).

Wait, because E[θ ε_{t-1}^2] is θ Var(ε), right? Because E[ε^2] is variance.

So γ(1) = θ * Var(ε).

But wait, in the model, the variance of the error term, Var(ε), is usually denoted as σ². The question doesn't give σ², so I don't have its value. Without knowing σ², can I compute γ(1) numerically?

Looking at the options, option J says it's not possible without knowing the disturbance variance. Option F is 0.4, which is θ. But wait, γ(1) is θ σ², not just θ. Since σ² isn't given, you can't calculate the exact value. So the answer would depend on whether the question expects an expression or a numerical value.

Wait, the question asks for the value. Without σ², it's impossible to compute a numerical value. But looking at the options, option F is 0.4, which would be the case if σ² is 1.

Ah, but wait, sometimes in these models, the variance is normalized, perhaps assuming Var(ε)=1. If that's the case, then γ(1) would be θ. So if σ² is 1, then γ(1) is 0.4, option F.

But the question didn't specify the variance. So without knowing σ², it's impossible to compute the exact value. So the correct answer would be option J.

Wait, but some textbooks define the MA model with the variance scaled. Let me think again. The general form is X_t = β_0 ε_t + β_1 ε_{t-1} + ... For MA(1), X_t = ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}.

The variance of X_t is Var(X_t) = Var(ε_t) + θ² Var(ε_{t-1}) = σ² (1 + θ²).

But the autocovariance at lag 1 is γ(1) = Cov(X_t, X_{t-1}) = θ σ². Because when you compute E[X_t X_{t-1}], only the terms where the epsilons overlap contribute. So it's θ σ².

But without knowing σ², we can't compute the numerical value. So the answer would be J.

Looking at the options:

Option J: It is not possible to determine the value of the autocovariances without knowing the disturbance variance.

So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but some sources say that for MA(q), the autocovariance at lag k is zero for k>q. But that's for higher lags. For lag 1 in MA(1), it's non-zero.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The formula for MA(1) is X_t = ε_t + θ ε_{t-1}.

So the autocovariance at lag 1 is E[X_t X_{t-1}] = E[(ε_t + θ ε_{t-1})(ε_{t-1} + θ ε_{t-2})] = E[ε_t ε_{t-1}] + θ E[ε_t ε_{t-2}] + θ E[ε_{t-1}^2] + θ² E[ε_{t-1} ε_{t-2}].

Now, E[ε_t ε_{t-1}] is zero, E[ε_t ε_{t-2}] is zero, E[ε_{t-1} ε_{t-2}] is zero. The middle term is θ E[ε_{t-1}^2] = θ Var(ε) = θ σ².

So γ(1) = θ σ². So without σ², we can't get a number.

Therefore, the answer is J.

To determine the autocovariance at lag 1 for an MA(1) series with zero mean and a moving average coefficient of 0.4, we start by recalling the general form of an MA(1) process:

\[
X_t = \varepsilon_t + \theta \varepsilon_{t-1},
\]

where \(\theta = 0.4\) is the moving average coefficient, and \(\varepsilon_t\) is a white noise process with variance \(\sigma^2\) and zero mean.

The autocovariance at lag 1, \(\gamma(1)\), is defined as:

\[
\gamma(1) = \text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t-1}) = E[(X_t - \mu)(X_{t-1} - \mu)].
\]

Since the mean \(\mu = 0\), this simplifies to:

\[
\gamma(1) = E[X_t X_{t-1}].
\]

Substituting the MA(1) expression for \(X_t\) and \(X_{t-1}\):

\[
X_t = \varepsilon_t + \theta \varepsilon_{t-1}, \quad X_{t-1} = \varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta \varepsilon_{t-2}.
\]

Multiplying these:

\[
X_t X_{t-1} = (\varepsilon_t + \theta \varepsilon_{t-1})(\varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta \varepsilon_{t-2}).
\]

Expanding and taking expectations:

\[
E[X_t X_{t-1}] = E[\varepsilon_t \varepsilon_{t-1}] + \theta E[\varepsilon_t \varepsilon_{t-2}] + \theta E[\varepsilon_{t-1}^2] + \theta^2 E[\varepsilon_{t-1} \varepsilon_{t-2}].
\]

Using the properties of white noise (\(E[\varepsilon_t \varepsilon_{t-k}] = 0\) for \(k \geq 1\) and \(E[\varepsilon_t^2] = \sigma^2\)):

\[
E[X_t X_{t-1}] = 0 + 0 + \theta \sigma^2 + 0 = \theta \sigma^2.
\]

Thus, the autocovariance at lag 1 is:

\[
\gamma(1) = \theta \sigma^2.
\]

However, the question does not provide the value of \(\sigma^2\), the variance of the disturbance term \(\varepsilon_t\). Without knowing \(\sigma^2\), it is impossible to compute the numerical value of \(\gamma(1)\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: It is not possible to determine the value of the autocovariances without knowing the disturbance variance.**

Answer: J
