Okay, so I've got this problem here about a young person saving money for retirement. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question says that the person is investing k dollars each year with an annual rate of return r, and they want to have $1 million when they retire in 40 years. The rate r is given as 7.5%. I need to find the value of k from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with continuous investments and continuous compounding, there's a specific formula involved. I think it's related to the future value of a continuous income stream. Oh right, the formula for the future value (FV) when making continuous contributions is FV = (k / r) * (e^(rt) - 1). Wait, is that right? Or is it something else?

Wait, maybe I should double-check. So, continuous contributions and continuous compounding use calculus, specifically integrals. The formula for the future value when you're contributing continuously is derived from integrating the contributions over time. I think the correct formula is FV = (k/r) * (e^(rt) - 1). Yes, that sounds familiar.

So, the problem gives FV as $1,000,000, r is 7.5% or 0.075, and t is 40 years. We need to solve for k.

Plugging in the numbers: 1,000,000 = (k / 0.075) * (e^(0.075*40) - 1).

First, let's compute e^(0.075*40). Let me calculate that exponent. 0.075 times 40 is 3. So e^3 is approximately 20.0855. So then, e^3 -1 is about 19.0855.

So substituting back, 1,000,000 = (k / 0.075) * 19.0855.

Let me rearrange this to solve for k. Multiply both sides by 0.075: 1,000,000 * 0.075 = k * 19.0855.

Calculating 1,000,000 * 0.075 gives 75,000. So 75,000 = k * 19.0855.

Now, solving for k: k = 75,000 / 19.0855. Let me compute this. Hmm, what's 75,000 divided by approximately 19.0855.

Let me do the division. 19.0855 times 3900 is 19.0855 * 3900. Let me see: 19 * 3900 is 74,100. 0.0855 * 3900 is around 333.45. So total is 74,433.45. That's a bit less than 75,000. So 3900 would give about 74,433.45.

The difference is 75,000 - 74,433.45 = 566.55. So how much more do I need? Let me see, each additional 1 in k adds approximately 19.0855. Wait, no, wait—actually, since k is 75,000 /19.0855, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a calculator approach. Let's see:

75,000 / 19.0855 ≈ ?

Well, 19.0855 times 3925 equals:

Let me compute 19.0855 * 3925:

First, 3925 * 19 = 74,575.

Then 3925 * 0.0855 = let's calculate that. 3925 * 0.08 is 314, and 3925 * 0.0055 is 21.5875. Adding them gives 314 + 21.5875 = 335.5875.

So total is 74,575 + 335.5875 = 74,910.5875. That's still under 75,000.

So 3925 gives us 74,910.59. The remaining is 75,000 - 74,910.59 = 89.41.

So 89.41 /19.0855 ≈ 4.68 more. So k would be approximately 3925 + 4.68 ≈ 3929.68. So around 3930.

Looking at the options, H is 3930 $, so that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up somewhere.

Alternatively, I can compute it using exact steps.

The formula is k = (FV * r) / (e^(rt) - 1).

FV is 1e6, r is 0.075, t is 40.

e^(0.075*40) = e^3 ≈ 20.0855.

So denominator is 20.0855 -1 = 19.0855.

So k = (1e6 * 0.075) / 19.0855 = 75,000 / 19.0855 ≈ 3929.68, which is approximately 3930.

So yes, H is the correct option. Looking at the options, H is 3930 $.

To determine the annual continuous investment \( k \) required for a young person to accumulate \$1 million in 40 years with a 7.5% annual rate of return (\( r = 0.075 \)), we use the formula for the future value of a continuous income stream:

\[
FV = \frac{k}{r} \left( e^{rt} - 1 \right)
\]

Here, \( FV = \$1,000,000 \), \( r = 0.075 \), and \( t = 40 \). Substituting these values:

\[
1,000,000 = \frac{k}{0.075} \left( e^{0.075 \cdot 40} - 1 \right)
\]

First, calculate \( e^{0.075 \cdot 40} \). Since \( 0.075 \cdot 40 = 3 \), we find:

\[
e^3 \approx 20.0855
\]

Thus:

\[
1,000,000 = \frac{k}{0.075} \cdot (20.0855 - 1)
\]

\[
1,000,000 = \frac{k}{0.075} \cdot 19.0855
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( k \):

\[
k = \frac{1,000,000 \cdot 0.075}{19.0855}
\]

\[
k = \frac{75,000}{19.0855} \approx 3929.68
\]

This rounds to approximately \$3,930. Among the given options, the closest match is **H: \$3,930**.
