Okay, so I've got this marketing question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is about determining how a product can be useful, identifying the target price, finding a place to sell it, and deciding how to promote it best. The options are from A to J, each representing different marketing terms.

Hmm, let's break this down. The question mentions four main activities: determining product usefulness, target pricing, place to sell, and promotion. These all sound familiar, like they're part of a common marketing framework.

Wait, I remember something called the marketing mix. Isn't that the four Ps? Let me think. Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. Yeah, that's right. So each of the activities in the question matches one of the four Ps.

So the first part, determining how a product can be useful, that's about the product itself. Then, target price is obviously the price aspect. Finding a place to sell relates to place, which is distribution channels. Promotion is about how you communicate and sell it.

Putting it all together, these four elements are part of what's known as the marketing mix. So the question is asking which of these options exemplifies using the marketing mix.

Looking at the options, option D is "marketing mix." That must be the correct answer. The other options don't fit as well. For example, market research (A) is more about gathering data about markets, positioning (B) is about how customers perceive the product, product differentiation (C) is about making the product stand out, and so on. None of those cover all four Ps like the marketing mix does.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is D.

The question asks about activities that align with determining a product's usefulness, target pricing, distribution, and promotion. These activities correspond to the four Ps of the marketing mix: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. Among the options, D: marketing mix is the correct answer as it encompasses all these elements.

Answer: D
