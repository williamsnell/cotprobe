Okay, so I've got this problem here about arranging 6 pairs of parentheses and making sure they're balanced. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember something about Catalan numbers. Oh right, Catalan numbers are used to determine the number of ways to correctly match parentheses. So if there are n pairs, the nth Catalan number gives the number of valid combinations.

But wait, I should make sure I remember the formula correctly. The nth Catalan number is given by (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). So for 6 pairs, n is 6.

Let me plug in the numbers. So it's (1/(6+1)) multiplied by the combination of 12 choose 6. Let me compute that.

First, 12 choose 6. I think that's 12!/(6!6!) which is 924. Then, multiply by 1/7. So 924 divided by 7. Let me do that division: 7 into 924. 7*132 is 924 because 7*100=700, 7*30=210, 7*2=14; 700+210=910, +14=924. So 924/7 is 132.

So the 6th Catalan number is 132, which should be the number of ways to arrange 6 pairs of parentheses correctly. Looking at the options, option D is 132.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't get the index wrong. Sometimes Catalan numbers start counting from n=0, so the first one (n=0) is 1. So n=6 would indeed be the 7th term, but the formula still holds as (1/(6+1)) * (12 choose 6). Yep, that's correct.

The problem asks for the number of ways to arrange 6 pairs of parentheses such that they are balanced. This is a classic combinatorial problem solved using Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by:

\[
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}
\]

For \( n = 6 \), the calculation is as follows:

1. Compute \( \binom{12}{6} \), which equals \( \frac{12!}{6!6!} = 924 \).
2. Multiply by \( \frac{1}{6+1} = \frac{1}{7} \), so \( \frac{924}{7} = 132 \).

Thus, the 6th Catalan number is 132, which represents the number of valid ways to arrange 6 pairs of balanced parentheses. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: 132**
