Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Edward Gibbon's interpretation of religious worship in ancient Rome. Let's start by understanding the question and the provided information.

The question gives a quote from Edward Gibbon's "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." The quote says: "The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosopher as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful."

I need to summarize Gibbon's interpretation based on this quote. The options are from A to I, and each presents a different view of religious worship in ancient Rome.

Let me break down the quote. It talks about "various modes of worship," meaning there were multiple religions or practices present. Now, different groups viewed these differently:

1. The people (general public) saw them as equally true. So, they perhaps accepted all forms of worship as valid or true.
2. The philosophers saw them as equally false. Philosophers, being more critical thinkers, probably didn't believe in any of them, thinking they were all false.
3. The magistrates (government officials) saw them as equally useful. So, the state found these religions useful, maybe for maintaining order or control.

Putting this together, Gibbon seems to suggest that the Roman Empire was religiously diverse. The common people were accepting of various religions, the philosophers were skeptical, and the state saw religion as a tool for utility—keeping the peace, perhaps.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Religious worship was solely a matter of personal choice. The quote doesn't say that. It just says people considered them equally true, but doesn't imply it was only personal. The state's role is mentioned, so maybe it's more than just personal choice.

Option B: Seen as a moral obligation. The quote doesn't mention morality, so this might not be it.

Option C: Influenced by Greek mythology. The quote doesn't talk about Greek influence specifically.

Option D: Source of social tension. The quote suggests that the state found religions useful, which might imply they used them to reduce tension, not cause it. So maybe D is not the case.

Option E: Homogeneous and centralized. No, the quote says "various modes," so it's the opposite—diverse, not homogeneous.

Option F: Decentralized and varied with social position. The quote mentions various modes but doesn't directly tie it to social position. Maybe, but not sure yet.

Option G: Strictly enforced by the state. The magistrates found them useful, but the quote doesn't say they enforced one religion. Instead, they allowed various as long as they were useful.

Option H: Considered a matter of political importance. Since magistrates saw them as useful, this implies that religion had political uses, so H might be correct.

Option I: Revolutionized by Christianity. The quote doesn't mention Christianity, so I can eliminate this option.

So, narrowing it down. The key points are that there were multiple religions, each group viewed them differently. The state found them useful, implying they were important politically.

Option H says that religious worship was a matter of political importance. That fits because the magistrates saw religions as useful, meaning they served political purposes like maintaining order or legitimacy.

Option F talks about decentralization and variation with social position. The quote doesn't specify social position influencing worship, just that people, philosophers, and magistrates had different views.

So, I think the correct answer is H. The quote indicates that the state (magistrates) saw religion as politically useful, so it was of political importance.

The quote by Edward Gibbon highlights that in ancient Rome, various modes of religious worship coexisted, viewed differently by the people, philosophers, and magistrates. The people saw them as equally true, philosophers as equally false, and magistrates as equally useful. This suggests that while the general public accepted religious diversity, the state recognized the political utility of these religions, implying their importance in maintaining order or legitimacy. Among the options, H aligns best with this interpretation, as it captures the political significance of religious worship in ancient Rome.

Answer: H
