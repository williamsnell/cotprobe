Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the rate of return on a loan. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the question says that Charles will pay Bernice $800 five years from now if she lends him $500 now. So, Bernice is giving Charles $500 today, and in five years, she'll get $800 back. The question is asking for the rate of return on this $500 loan. 

Hmm, I think this is a present value problem. The formula for present value is something like PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, right? Where PV is the present value, FV is the future value, r is the rate, and n is the number of periods. 

So in this case, the present value (PV) is $500 because that's what Bernice is lending now. The future value (FV) is $800, which she'll get in five years. We need to find the rate 'r' that makes these two equal over five years. 

Let me rearrange the formula to solve for r. So starting with PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, I can multiply both sides by (1 + r)^n to get PV * (1 + r)^n = FV. Then, divide both sides by PV to get (1 + r)^n = FV / PV. 

Substituting the numbers, FV is 800 and PV is 500. So FV/PV is 800/500, which is 1.6. So (1 + r)^5 = 1.6. 

Now I need to solve for r. To do that, I think I should take the fifth root of both sides. Alternatively, I can use logarithms. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides might help. So ln(1 + r)^5 = ln(1.6). Using the power rule for logs, that's 5 * ln(1 + r) = ln(1.6). 

So dividing both sides by 5: ln(1 + r) = ln(1.6) / 5. Let me calculate ln(1.6). I remember that ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, and e is about 2.718. But wait, what's the value of ln(1.6)? Maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, I can use a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll have to think.

Wait, perhaps I can remember that ln(1.6) is approximately 0.4700. Let me check: e^0.47 is about e^0.4 is about 1.4918, 0.47 is a bit higher. Let's see, 0.47 * 1 is 0.47, e^0.47 ≈ 1.6. So yeah, that works. So ln(1.6) ≈ 0.47.

So then, ln(1 + r) = 0.47 / 5. 0.47 divided by 5 is 0.094. So ln(1 + r) ≈ 0.094.

Now, to solve for r, I'll exponentiate both sides. So e^(ln(1 + r)) = e^(0.094). That simplifies to 1 + r = e^0.094.

What's e^0.094? I know that for small x, e^x is approximately 1 + x + x²/2. Let's compute that. x is 0.094 here.

So e^0.094 ≈ 1 + 0.094 + (0.094)^2 / 2. 0.094 squared is about 0.008836. Divided by 2, that's 0.004418. So adding up: 1 + 0.094 is 1.094, plus 0.004418 gives about 1.0984. So e^0.094 ≈ 1.0984.

Wait, but maybe that's not accurate enough. Let me think another way. I think e^0.1 is approximately 1.10517. So 0.094 is a little less than 0.1, so maybe e^0.094 is about 1.0984. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I can use a linear approximation. The derivative of e^x is e^x, so around x=0, e^(x) ≈ 1 + x + x²/2, which is what I did earlier. So 1.0984 is a good approximation.

So 1 + r ≈ 1.0984, which means r ≈ 0.0984, or 9.84%. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again. The options are from 5.86% up to 14.86%. Hmm, 9.84% isn't listed either. Wait, option G is 9.86%, which is very close. So is that the correct answer? 

Wait, maybe my approximation for ln(1.6) was off. Let me think again. What's the exact value of ln(1.6)? Let me try to calculate it more accurately. 

I remember that ln(1.6) is about 0.470004. But perhaps I should be more precise. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate method. Let me think about the exact value using a calculator. Oh wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rule of 72 or some other method, but that might not be as precise. Alternatively, maybe I should try to compute (1 + r)^5 = 1.6 and solve for r.

Let me try plugging in some of the options to see which one gives approximately 1.6 when raised to the fifth power.

Option G is 9.86%. Let me compute (1 + 0.0986)^5.

1.0986^5: Let's compute step by step.

First, 1.0986^2: 1.0986 * 1.0986. Let's see:

1.0986 * 1.0986: 1 * 1 =1. 1 * 0.0986 = 0.0986. 0.0986 *1 = 0.0986. 0.0986 *0.0986 ≈ 0.00972. So adding all together: 1 + 0.0986 + 0.0986 + 0.00972 ≈ 1.2069. So 1.0986 squared is approximately 1.2069.

Now, 1.2069^2 is (1.2069)^2. Let's compute that: 1.2 *1.2 =1.44. 0.0069 *1.2069 *2 (using (a+b)^2 formula) plus (0.0069)^2. Wait, maybe just multiply 1.2069 by itself.

1.2069 * 1.2069: Let's calculate:

= (1 + 0.2 + 0.0069) * (1 + 0.2 + 0.0069)
But perhaps it's easier to compute directly.

1.2069 * 1.2069:

Calculate 1.2 * 1.2 = 1.44.
1.2 * 0.0069 = 0.00828
0.0069 *1.2 = 0.00828
0.0069 *0.0069 ≈ 0.00004761
Adding up all parts: 1.44 + (0.00828 + 0.00828) + 0.00004761 = 1.44 + 0.01656 + 0.00004761 ≈ 1.45660761.

So 1.2069 squared is approximately 1.4566. Now, that's (1.0986)^4 ≈ 1.4566.

Now, to compute (1.0986)^5, we multiply 1.4566 by 1.0986.

1.4566 * 1.0986: Let's compute.

1 * 1.4566 = 1.4566.
0.0986 *1.4566 ≈ 0.1438.
So total is 1.4566 + 0.1438 ≈ 1.6004.

Wow, that's really close to 1.6. So (1.0986)^5 ≈ 1.6004, which is just a bit over 1.6. So that would mean that 9.86% is actually the correct rate because when you raise it to the fifth power, you get very close to 1.6. 

Wait, but the options have option G as 9.86%, which matches our calculation. So that would make option G the correct answer. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me see: when I calculated ln(1.6) as approximately 0.47, that's correct. Then, 0.47 divided by 5 is 0.094. Then, taking e^0.094 gives approximately 1.0984. So the exact rate would be approximately 9.84%, which is very close to 9.86%, so option G.

Wait, but wait another moment. Because when I calculated (1.0986)^5, I got 1.6004, which is slightly more than 1.6. So perhaps the exact rate is a little less than 9.86%? For example, 9.84% would give (1.0984)^5. Let's see:

Compute 1.0984^5. Let's do this step by step.

First, 1.0984 squared: 1.0984 *1.0984.

Let me compute 1.0984^2:

1.0984 *1.0984:

1 * 1 = 1.
1 * 0.0984 = 0.0984.
0.0984 *1 = 0.0984.
0.0984 *0.0984 ≈ 0.00968.

Adding them up: 1 + 0.0984 + 0.0984 + 0.00968 ≈ 1 + 0.1968 + 0.00968 = 1.20648.

So 1.0984^2 ≈ 1.20648.

Now, 1.20648^2 = ?

1.20648 *1.20648: Let's compute.

1 *1.20648 = 1.20648.
0.2 *1.20648 = 0.241296.
0.00648 *1.20648 ≈ 0.00781.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate:

(1.20648)^2 = (1.2 + 0.00648)^2 = 1.2^2 + 2*1.2*0.00648 + (0.00648)^2.

1.2^2 = 1.44.

2 *1.2 *0.00648 = 2.4 *0.00648 = 0.015552.

(0.00648)^2 ≈ 0.0000419.

So total is 1.44 + 0.015552 + 0.0000419 ≈ 1.455594.

So (1.20648)^2 ≈ 1.455594, which is 1.0984^4.

Now, multiply by 1.0984 again to get the fifth power.

1.455594 *1.0984.

Let me compute 1.455594 *1.0984.

1 *1.455594 = 1.455594.
0.09 *1.455594 = 0.13100346.
0.0084 *1.455594 ≈ 0.01223.

Adding up: 1.455594 + 0.13100346 = 1.58659746 + 0.01223 ≈ 1.598827.

So 1.455594 *1.0984 ≈ 1.598827, which is approximately 1.5988, very close to 1.6. So 1.0984^5 ≈1.5988, which is just under 1.6. 

Wait, so 9.84% gives us approximately 1.5988, which is a bit less than 1.6. Earlier, 9.86% gave us about 1.6004, which is slightly more than 1.6. So the exact rate is between 9.84% and 9.86%. 

But the options don't have 9.84%. The closest option is G:9.86%. So that must be the correct answer because when we plug in 9.86%, the future value is just a bit over $800, which aligns with the question. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact rate using more precise methods. Let me try to compute it with more accurate logarithms.

The exact formula is r = (FV/PV)^(1/n) -1.

So FV is 800, PV is 500. FV/PV is 1.6. n is 5.

So r = 1.6^(1/5) -1.

Calculating 1.6^(1/5). Let me think about the fifth root of 1.6. Alternatively, using logarithms:

ln(1.6^(1/5)) = (1/5)*ln(1.6) ≈ (1/5)*0.470004 ≈ 0.0940008.

So e^0.0940008 = ?

I can compute this more accurately. Let's use the Taylor series for e^x around x=0. The expansion is e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x^4/4! +...

x = 0.0940008.

Compute up to x^5 for better approximation.

e^0.094 ≈ 1 + 0.094 + (0.094)^2/2 + (0.094)^3/6 + (0.094)^4/24 + (0.094)^5/120.

Compute each term:

0.094 = 0.0940008.

First term: 1.

Second term: +0.094.

Third term: (0.094)^2 = 0.008836, divided by 2: 0.004418.

Fourth term: (0.094)^3 = 0.000830584, divided by 6: ≈ 0.00013843.

Fifth term: (0.094)^4 ≈ 0.000094 *0.094 = wait, 0.094^4 is (0.094^2)^2 = (0.008836)^2 ≈ 0.000078097, divided by 24: ≈ 0.000003254.

Sixth term: (0.094)^5 = 0.000078097 * 0.094 ≈ 0.000007343, divided by 120: ≈ 0.0000000612.

Adding all terms:

1 + 0.094 = 1.094.

Plus 0.004418: 1.098418.

Plus 0.00013843: 1.09855643.

Plus 0.000003254: 1.09855968.

Plus 0.0000000612: 1.09855974.

So e^0.094 ≈ 1.09855974. Therefore, r ≈ 0.09855974, which is approximately 9.856%. So rounding to two decimal places, that's 9.86%. 

So the correct rate is approximately 9.86%, which is option G.

To calculate the rate of return on the $500 loan, we use the present value formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Here:
- \( PV = 500 \) (the present value, or the amount lent),
- \( FV = 800 \) (the future value, or the amount to be repaid),
- \( n = 5 \) (the number of years),
- \( r \) is the rate of return we need to find.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( r \):

\[
(1 + r)^5 = \frac{FV}{PV} = \frac{800}{500} = 1.6
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln((1 + r)^5) = \ln(1.6)
\]

Using the power rule for logarithms:

\[
5 \cdot \ln(1 + r) = \ln(1.6)
\]

Dividing through by 5:

\[
\ln(1 + r) = \frac{\ln(1.6)}{5}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(1.6) \approx 0.4700 \):

\[
\ln(1 + r) = \frac{0.4700}{5} = 0.094
\]

Exponentiating both sides to solve for \( 1 + r \):

\[
1 + r = e^{0.094}
\]

Using the Taylor series expansion for \( e^x \) around \( x = 0 \):

\[
e^{0.094} \approx 1 + 0.094 + \frac{(0.094)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.094)^3}{6} + \dots
\]

Calculating up to the second term for simplicity:

\[
e^{0.094} \approx 1.0984
\]

Thus:

\[
r \approx 1.0984 - 1 = 0.0984 \quad \text{or} \quad 9.84\%
\]

Refining the calculation using more precise methods or approximations, the rate is approximately \( 9.86\% \). Testing this rate by raising \( (1 + 0.0986)^5 \) confirms it produces a value very close to 1.6, aligning with the given conditions.

The closest option to this calculated rate is **9.86%**, which corresponds to **Option G**.

**Answer: G**
