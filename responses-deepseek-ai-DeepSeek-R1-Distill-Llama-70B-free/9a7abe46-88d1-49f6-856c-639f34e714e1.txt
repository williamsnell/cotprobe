Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about electrons being accelerated to produce x-rays. Hmm, I remember that when electrons are accelerated through a potential difference, they gain kinetic energy. The question is asking for their speed after being accelerated through 25,000 volts. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the key here is the relationship between electric potential, kinetic energy, and velocity. I remember that the electric potential does work on the electron, converting its potential energy into kinetic. So the work done should equal the kinetic energy gained.

Wait, the formula for that is probably something like eV equals (1/2)mv², where e is the charge of the electron, V is the voltage, m is the mass of the electron, and v is the speed we're trying to find. Yeah, that sounds right. Oh, right, because work done is charge times voltage (W = qV), and the work done here is the kinetic energy gained.

So plugging in the numbers, the charge of an electron is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. The voltage is 25,000 volts. The mass of the electron is 9.1e-31 kg. Let me write this down step by step.

So, the equation would be eV = 0.5 * m * v². Solving for v, I get v = sqrt( (2eV) / m ). 

Let me compute the numerator first: 2 * e * V. e is 1.6e-19 C, V is 25,000 V, so 2 * 1.6e-19 * 25,000. Let's compute that.

Wait, 25,000 is 2.5e4. So 2 * 1.6e-19 is 3.2e-19. Multiply that by 2.5e4: 3.2e-19 * 2.5e4 = (3.2 * 2.5) * 1e-15. 3.2 *2.5 is 8. So 8e-15? So the numerator is 8e-15.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. Because 2 * 1.6e-19 is 3.2e-19 C. Multiply by 25,000 V (which is 2.5e4 V). So 3.2e-19 * 2.5e4 = (3.2 * 2.5) * 10^(-19 +4). 3.2 * 2.5 is 8, and 10^-15. So yeah, 8e-15 (but the units would be in Joules because eV gives energy in joules, right?).

So now, the denominator is mass m, which is 9.1e-31 kg.

So the whole thing under the square root is (8e-15) / (9.1e-31). Let me compute that.

Dividing 8e-15 by 9.1e-31: that's (8/9.1) * 1e16. Hmm, 8 divided by 9.1 is approximately 0.879. So 0.879e16, which is 8.79e15.

Wait, actually, 8e-15 /9.1e-31 is 8/(9.1e-31-(-15)) wait, no, 8e-15 /9.1e-31 = (8/9.1) * 1e( -15 - (-31) )= (0.879) * 1e16, yeah. So that's 8.79e15.

Wait, I'm getting that the value inside the square root is 8.79e15 (m²/s²). So taking the square root gives v = sqrt(8.79e15) m/s.

What's the square root of 8.79e15? Let's see, sqrt(8.79) is about 2.962, and sqrt(1e15) is 1e7.5, which is 1e7.5? Wait, 1e15 is (1e7.5)^2. So 1e7.5 is 3.16e7. But wait, 1e15 is 1e3^5, so square root is 1e7.5, which is 3.16e7. So 2.962 * 3.16e7 m/s.

Let me compute 2.962 * 3.16e7. 3 * 3.16e7 is 9.48e7, but 2.962 is a bit less than 3. So 2.962 *3.16 is approximately 9.37. So 9.37e7 m/s? Wait, that can't be right because the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, and I thought these electrons would be a significant fraction but not that high.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. So let me go through the numbers again.

So e = 1.6e-19 C

V = 25,000 V = 2.5e4 V.

So eV = 1.6e-19 * 2.5e4 = (1.6 *2.5) *1e-15 = 4e-15 J.

Then, 2eV = 2 *4e-15 = 8e-15 J.

So 2eV = 8e-15 J.

Mass m =9.1e-31 kg.

So (2eV)/m = 8e-15 /9.1e-31.

Let me compute 8e-15 / 9.1e-31.

8e-15 is 8 *1e-15.

9.1e-31 is 9.1 *1e-31.

So 8/(9.1) = approx 0.879.

And 1e-15 /1e-31 =1e16.

So 0.879e16 = 8.79e15.

So v² = 8.79e15 → v = sqrt(8.79e15) = sqrt(8.79) * sqrt(1e15) → 2.962 * 1e7.794 approximately wait, wait, 1e15 is 1e(30/2), so square root is 1e7.5 which is 3.16e7.

Wait, sqrt(1e15) = 1e7.5 = 3.1623e7 m/s.

So 2.962 *3.1623e7 ≈ let's compute 3*3.1623e7 is 9.4869e7, but 2.962 is 0.038 less than 3. So 0.038 *3.1623e7 = approx 1.201e6.

So 9.4869e7 - 1.201e6 = approximately 9.4869e7 - 0.1201e7 = 9.3668e7 m/s. So v ≈ 9.37e7 m/s.

Wait, but that seems pretty high. I thought electrons at 25 keV would have a speed around 1e8 m/s, but maybe a bit less.

Wait, let me check the calculations again because I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, 8e-15 divided by 9.1e-31.

So 8e-15 /9.1e-31 = (8/9.1) *1e( (-15) - (-31) )= (0.879) *1e16 = 8.79e15 m²/s².

So sqrt(8.79e15) = sqrt(8.79)*1e7.5 ≈ 2.962 * 3.162e7 = around 9.37e7 m/s.

Looking at the options, let's see the choices:

A: 90000000.0 →9e7 → 9e7 is 90,000,000.

B: 98e6 →9.8e7.

C:1e8 →100,000,000.

G:95e6 →9.5e7.

Wait, but my calculation is approximately 9.37e7, which is 93,700,000 m/s. So the closest options would be A:9e7, which is 90 million, or G:95e6 (95,000,000), or B:98e6 (98 million).

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 2eV/(m) → 2 *1.6e-19 C *25,000 V / (9.1e-31 kg).

Wait, 2eV is 2*(1.6e-19 * 25000) = 2*(4e-15) =8e-15 J.

Divide by mass 9.1e-31 kg:

8e-15 /9.1e-31 = (8/9.1) *1e16 ≈ 0.879 *1e16 = 8.79e15 m²/s².

So v= sqrt(8.79e15) m/s.

Compute sqrt(8.79e15):

sqrt(8.79) is approximately 2.962. sqrt(1e15)=1e7.5=3.16227766e7.

So 2.962 *3.16227766e7: let's calculate this.

2 *3.16227766e7 =6.3245553e7.

0.962 *3.16227766e7: 0.9 * 3.162e7 =2.8458e7; 0.062 *3.162e7≈1.96e6. So total about 2.8458e7+1.96e6= 2.9616e7.

Adding to the 6.3245e7 gives 6.3245e7 + 2.9616e7 = 9.2861e7 m/s. So approximately 9.286e7 m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 9e7, which is 90,000,000, option G is 95,000,000 (9.5e7), and option B is 98e6 (9.8e7).

Wait, but 9.286e7 is approximately 92.86 million. None of the options exactly match that. Let me check the options again.

Ah, looking back, the options are:

A:9e7 →90,000,000

B:98e6 →98,000,000

C:1e8 →100,000,000

D:8e7 →80 mil

E:55e6

F:7e7 →70 mil

G:95e6 →95 mil

H:85e6 →85 mil

I:65e6 →65 mil

J:75e6 →75 mil.

Wait, the calculated value is about 92.86e6, which is 92.86 million m/s. But none of the options are exactly that. The closest options are:

Option A:90e6 →90 million.

Option G:95e6 →95 million.

But our calculation is 92.86, which is closer to 93 million, but there's no option for that. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a more precise value for the square root.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(8.79e15) more accurately.

Wait, 8.79e15 = 8.79 * 1e15 = 8.79 * (1e7.5)^2 = 8.79 * (3.16227766e7)^2.

So sqrt(8.79e15) = sqrt(8.79) * 3.16227766e7.

Compute sqrt(8.79) accurately.

Well, sqrt(9)=3, so sqrt(8.79) is a bit less than 2.962. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 2.96^2 = 8.7616.

2.96^2 = (3 -0.04)^2 =9 - 2*3*0.04 +0.04²=9-0.24+0.0016=8.7616.

Which is less than 8.79. The difference is 8.79 -8.7616=0.0284.

Now, let me find x where (2.96 +x)^2 =8.79.

Expanding: 2.96² + 2*2.96*x +x² =8.79.

We know 2.96² is 8.7616, so 8.7616 +5.92x +x²=8.79.

Ignoring x² for small x: 5.92x ≈ 0.0284 → x≈0.0284/5.92 ≈0.0048.

So sqrt(8.79)≈2.96 +0.0048=2.9648.

So sqrt(8.79)= approx 2.9648.

So now, v=2.9648 *3.16227766e7.

Compute 2.9648 *3.16227766e7.

Let me compute 3 *3.16227766e7 =9.48683298e7.

But since it's 2.9648, which is 0.0352 less than 3, I'll compute:

3.16227766e7 * (3 - 0.0352) = 3.16227766e7 *3 - 3.16227766e7 *0.0352.

So 9.48683298e7 - (3.16227766e7 *0.0352).

Compute 3.16227766e7 *0.0352:

First, 3e7 *0.0352=1.056e6.

0.16227766e7 *0.0352=approx 0.16227766e7 is 1,622,776.6 → 1,622,776.6 *0.0352 ≈ let's compute 1,622,776.6 *0.035 =approx 56,797.18. Then 1,622,776.6 *0.0002=324.555. So total approx 56,797 +324.555=57,121.555.

So 3.16227766e7 *0.0352 ≈1.056e6 +57,121.555 ≈1,113,121.555.

So subtracting this from 9.48683298e7: 9.48683298e7 -0.00111121555e8 = Wait, 1,113,121.555 is 0.001111215e8.

So 9.48683298e7 -0.001111215e8=9.48683298e7 - 0.11112155e7 = (9.48683298 -0.11112155)e7 =9.37571143e7 m/s.

So approximately 93,757,114 m/s. So about 9.3757e7 m/s, which is 93.757 million m/s.

Looking back at the options, the closest one is option A:9e7 (90 million) and option G:95e6 (95 million), but 93.75 is not an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using relativistic equations because when dealing with speeds a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical mechanics might not be accurate enough.

Wait, but at 25,000 volts, the kinetic energy is 25 keV. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 511 keV, so 25 keV is about 5% of that. So relativistic effects might start to matter, but perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, but the options given are all in the 10^7 to 1e8 m/s range. Let me see if I can find an exact approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula v = sqrt( (2eV/m) )

Wait, using exact numbers:

e =1.602176634e-19 C

V=25,000 V.

m=9.1093837015e-31 kg.

So 2*e*V =2 *1.602176634e-19 *25,000 = 2 *1.602176634e-19 *2.5e4 = 2 * 1.602176634 *2.5 *1e-15 = 2 *4.005441585 *1e-15 =8.01088317e-15 J.

Now, 8.01088317e-15 /9.1093837015e-31 = 8.01088317e-15 / 9.1093837015e-31 = (8.01088317 /9.1093837015 ) *1e16.

8.01088317 /9.1093837015 ≈0.8795.

So 0.8795 *1e16 =8.795e15 m²/s².

v= sqrt(8.795e15)=sqrt(8.795)*1e7.794 ?

Wait, no. Wait, 8.795e15 is 8.795 *1e15. Square root is sqrt(8.795) * sqrt(1e15).

sqrt(1e15)=1e7.5=3.16227766e7.

sqrt(8.795)=approximately 2.965.

So 2.965 *3.16227766e7 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

2 *3.16227766e7=6.3245553e7.

0.965 *3.16227766e7= Let's compute 3.16227766e7 *0.965.

0.9 *3.16227766e7=2.84605e7.

0.06 *3.16227766e7=1.8973666e6.

0.005 *3.16227766e7=1.5813883e5.

Adding these together: 2.84605e7 +1.8973666e6 = 3.1354866e7 +1.5813883e5 = 3.1400679883e7.

So 2.965 *3.16227766e7=6.3245553e
