Question:

This question refers to the following information.
While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or "Sea of Precious Virtues," written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.
Robert Irwin, "Islam and the Crusades," 1995
It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.
Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185
The second passage undermines traditional historical assumptions by

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option correctly answers the question about the second passage. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question asks which option the second passage undermines traditional historical assumptions by. The second passage is from Ibn Jubayr, a Muslim scholar who traveled around 1185. The passage describes how Christians near Mount Lebanon treated Muslim hermits kindly and that Christian merchants weren't hindered in Muslim territories.

I think the key here is understanding what traditional historical assumptions about the Crusades era are. I remember that the Crusades are often depicted as a time of intense conflict and religious hostility between Christians and Muslims. So the traditional view probably emphasizes the fighting and the religious divisions, showing little cooperation or kindness between the two groups.

Now, looking at the passage, it shows that in some areas, Christians and Muslims were actually treating each other kindly. The hermits were given food, and merchants could move freely. This suggests that on a personal and economic level, things were more peaceful than the traditional view might suggest.

So the passage is challenging the assumption that there was constant and widespread conflict. It's showing that even during the Crusades, there were instances of mutual respect and cooperation, at least on a personal level.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it shows that state-level antagonisms weren't always reflected in personal or economic life. That makes sense because while the larger picture might be conflict, the day-to-day interactions were more peaceful.

Option B suggests Muslims didn't take their religious obligations seriously, but the passage doesn't really talk about that. It's more about how they were treated by Christians.

Option C claims Muslims were kinder, but the passage shows both sides being kind, not comparing which was kinder.

Option D says economic factors were more important, but the passage doesn't focus on economics being the main reason, just that merchants weren't hindered.

So the best fit is Option A because it highlights the discrepancy between the broader conflicts and the personal/economic interactions.

The second passage challenges the traditional historical view of the Crusades era, which often emphasizes widespread conflict and hostility between Christians and Muslims. Ibn Jubayr's account illustrates that, despite state-level antagonisms, personal and economic interactions could be peaceful and cooperative. This undermines the assumption that religious and political tensions dominated all aspects of life. 

The correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
