Question:

A businessman living was an avid baseball fan who frequently traveled to a casino and placed wagers on baseball games. One October, his beloved baseball team was playing in the playoffs and he wanted to place a large bet on his team. He told one of his employees that he wanted to bet $10,000 on his team to win the championship, but that he did not have the time to travel to the casino to place the bet. He then told his employee that he wanted the employee to travel to the casino and place the bet for him. The businessman and the employee agreed that the employee would travel to the casino, place a $10,000 bet for the businessman and then immediately return. In exchange, the employee would be paid $500. The parties reduced this agreement to writing. After the agreement was signed, the businessman handed the employee $10,000 and a round-trip airline ticket. The businessman then told the employee that he would be paid $500 after the employee returned. The employee arrived the next day and immediately went to the casino. There he noticed that the marquis in the parking lot was unlit and covered in a banner that read, "Casino Temporarily Closed Due to Renovations. " Unable to reach the businessman by telephone, the employee placed the bet at another gaming establishment located next door to the casino. The following morning, the employee flew back and gave the betting receipt to the businessman. When the businessman saw that the bet had been made at another gaming establishment, he angrily told the employee, "I purposely directed you to wager that $10,000 at the casino. Since you failed to follow my instructions, the deal's off. " As a result, the businessman refused to pay the employee the $500. If the employee initiates suit for breach of contract, the court will most likely determine that placing the $10,000 wager at the other gaming establishment, rather than at the casino, constituted a

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

So, the setup is that a businessman wants to bet on his baseball team in the playoffs. He can't go himself, so he asks his employee to place a $10,000 bet for him at a casino. They have a written agreement where the employee will go to the casino, place the bet, and then come back. The employee gets $500 for this task. The businessman gives the employee $10k and a plane ticket. He says he'll pay the $500 when the employee returns.

So the employee goes the next day, arrives at the casino, but finds it's temporarily closed for renovations. The marquis is unlit with a banner saying it's closed. He can't reach the businessman by phone, so he goes next door to another gaming place and places the bet there. Then he comes back and gives the receipt to the businessman. But the businessman is angry because the bet wasn't placed at the casino as instructed, so he refuses to pay the $500. The employee sues for breach of contract.

The question is asking what the court will most likely determine about the employee placing the bet elsewhere.

The options are from A to J, each a different legal concept.

Let me think about the concepts here. The main issue is whether the employee's action of placing the bet elsewhere was a breach and, if so, what kind.

First, I remember that contracts have different types of breaches. There's material breach, minor breach, and other related concepts. A material breach goes to the heart of the contract and can allow the non-breaching party to terminate the contract. A minor breach, on the other hand, might not have such serious consequences.

In this case, the businessman specifically instructed the employee to bet at the casino. But the casino was closed. So the employee tried to fulfill the obligation as best as he could by going next door. The question is whether deviating from the specific instruction (casino vs. another place) is a material breach.

I think the specific instruction was important to the businessman. Maybe he had a reason to choose that particular casino—perhaps better odds, or maybe he had an account there, or trusted them more. Alternatively, maybe the casino's closure made it impossible, but the employee found an alternative that's similar.

Let me consider the doctrines. Impossibility of performance, impracticability, frustration of purpose—these are all defenses against breach. But in this case, the casino was temporarily closed, so it's not impossible, just maybe a bit more difficult. The employee didn't claim impossibility; he just went elsewhere.

Wait, so the employee didn't argue that he couldn't perform because the casino was closed. He went to another place. So the issue isn't impossibility; it's whether the change in the place of betting was a breach.

Another point is that the contract was to place the bet at the casino. So by going elsewhere, the employee didn't fulfill that specific term. But was that term a major part of the contract?

I think in contract law, whether a term is a condition or a warranty is important. A condition is a major term that goes to the heart of the contract. If a condition is breached, it's a material breach. A warranty is a minor term, and breaching it might allow the other party to claim damages but not terminate the contract.

In this case, the instruction to place the bet at the casino was a specific condition. The employee was supposed to go to that casino. So when he went next door, he didn't fulfill that condition. But wait, he tried to perform, just at a different place. So is that a material breach?

Alternatively, maybe the employee's action could be seen as a substantial performance. Substantial performance is when the party does almost everything but maybe misses a minor detail. If the main purpose was to place the bet, and that was done, then perhaps it's substantial performance, and only a minor breach.

But the question is about whether it's a material breach. So if the place was a condition, then failing to do that could be material. Alternatively, if the place was just a detail and the main goal was to place the bet, then it's not.

I think the key here is what the businessman's intent was. He specifically told the employee to go to the casino. So it might have been important to him. Maybe he had a reason, like maybe that casino had certain rules or perhaps he had a credit line there. Alternatively, maybe the odds were better there.

So, if the employee didn't go to the casino, he failed to meet a condition. That could be a material breach. But the employee tried to mitigate by going next door. So maybe it's a minor breach because he still placed the bet as instructed, just not at the exact location.

Wait, but the contract was to place the bet at the casino. So the employee didn't perform that specific task. So perhaps it's a material breach because the place was a significant term.

So looking at the options:

A: Discharge by impossibility. Not applicable here because the employee did place the bet elsewhere, so it's not impossible.

B: Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed. Hmm. A condition precedent is an event that must occur before an obligation arises. Substantial performance would mean he did most of it but maybe missed some minor points. So if placing the bet at the casino was a condition precedent, and the employee didn't do that, then maybe this applies. But I'm not sure if it's a condition precedent or a condition.

C: Modification. That would require both parties to agree to change the terms, which didn't happen here.

D: Material breach of contract. This seems likely if the casino was a key term.

E: Minor breach. If the location wasn't that important, but the main thing was placing the bet, then it's minor.

F: Constructive condition subsequent. That's a condition that, if not met, allows the other party to end the contract. Not sure about this.

G: Discharge by impracticability. The casino was temporarily closed, but impracticability usually requires more than just inconvenience—like a supervening event making it impossible. The employee found another place, so impracticability doesn't apply here.

H: Breach of contract. This is a broader term, but the question is about the specific type.

I: Discharge by frustration of purpose. That's when the main purpose of the contract is frustrated. Here, the purpose was placing the bet, which was done, so frustration doesn't apply.

J: Anticipatory repudiation. That's when a party indicates they won't perform before the time comes. Not the case here.

So between D and E. If the specific location was a major term, then D. If not, then E.

The businessman was angry because the bet wasn't placed at the casino. So he probably considered the location important. So it's a material breach.

Wait, but the employee did place the bet as per the main objective. So maybe it's a minor breach because the essential purpose was fulfilled, but a technicality was missed. But the contract specified the place, so that's a condition.

In that case, the employee failed to meet a condition, leading to a material breach.

So the answer would be D: material breach of contract.

The question revolves around whether the employee's decision to place the bet at a different gaming establishment, instead of the specified casino, constitutes a breach of contract and, if so, what type of breach it would be. The key issue is whether the specific instruction to place the bet at the casino was a material term of the contract or a minor detail.

The businessman explicitly instructed the employee to place the $10,000 bet at the casino, and this instruction was part of their written agreement. When the casino was found to be closed, the employee placed the bet at a neighboring gaming establishment instead. The businessman refused to pay the $500, arguing that the employee failed to follow his specific instructions.

In contract law, a material breach occurs when a party fails to perform a term that is central to the agreement, thereby defeating the purpose of the contract. Here, the instruction to place the bet at the casino appears to have been a significant term, as the businessman was angry when it was not followed. While the employee attempted to mitigate the situation by placing the bet elsewhere, the deviation from the specific instruction likely constitutes a material breach because it goes to the heart of the agreement.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **A (Discharge by impossibility):** Not applicable, as the employee did place the bet elsewhere, so the task was not impossible.
- **B (Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed):** This does not fit because the instruction to place the bet at the casino was not a condition precedent but rather a specific term of the agreement.
- **C (Modification):** There was no mutual agreement to modify the terms of the contract.
- **E (Minor breach):** If the location had been a minor detail, this might apply, but the businessman's reaction suggests it was important.
- **F (Constructive condition subsequent):** This does not apply, as the issue is not about terminating the contract but about the type of breach.
- **G (Discharge by impracticability):** The temporary closure of the casino does not rise to the level of impracticability, as the employee found an alternative.
- **H (Breach of contract):** While this is a broader category, the question asks for the specific type of breach.
- **I (Discharge by frustration of purpose):** The purpose of the contract (placing the bet) was fulfilled, so this does not apply.
- **J (Anticipatory repudiation):** There is no indication that either party repudiated the contract before performance was due.

Given the importance of the specific instruction to place the bet at the casino, the employee's failure to do so likely constitutes a material breach of contract.

**Answer: D**
