Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the scenario is about a husband and wife who were married for 10 years. The wife got a divorce when she found out he was having an affair with a coworker. After the divorce, the husband was arrested for embezzling funds from his employer over two years. Now, the prosecuting attorney is preparing for trial and interviews the wife. The wife says that during their marriage, the husband admitted to committing the embezzlement. 

The jurisdiction has both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. At the husband's trial, the wife is called to testify about the statements the husband made during their marriage regarding the crime. The husband's attorney objects. The question is whether the wife's testimony will be admissible, and I have to choose between options A to J.

Hmm, I remember that there are two main privileges here: the marital privilege and the spousal privilege. Wait, sometimes they're referred to together as marital privileges, but they're distinct. Let's break them down.

First, the marital communication privilege. At common law, this privilege covers communications made during the marriage. It's meant to protect the confidentiality of the marital relationship. So, a spouse can't be forced to testify about communications made during the marriage, and the other spouse can also prevent them from testifying about it, right? But I think this applies only while the marriage is still intact. Once they're divorced, does this privilege still hold?

Wait, no, I think the key point is that the communication was made during the marriage. So even after a divorce, the communication during the marriage is still privileged. So the marital communication privilege applies regardless of whether they're still married.

Then there's the spousal immunity, or the spousal privilege sometimes called the "husband-wife" privilege. I think this one is a bit different. I remember that one spouse cannot testify against the other in a criminal proceeding, but this is about the spouse being called to testify against the other. But wait, there's an exception when the spouse is testifying about a crime against them. Hmm, but in this case, the crime is embezzlement, not a crime against the wife. So maybe that exception doesn't apply here.

Wait, no, actually, the spousal immunity at common law is that a spouse can't be compelled to testify against the other spouse. So the wife can choose not to testify against the husband, but she can also choose to testify if she wants to. So it's more about whether she can be compelled. But in this case, she's being called by the prosecution, so if the husband objects, perhaps she can't be forced to testify against him under this privilege.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of her testimony, not whether she can be compelled. So, if the husband objects, can he prevent her from testifying based on these privileges?

So, the two privileges here: marital communication and spousal immunity.

Marital communication: applies to statements made during the marriage, so even after divorce, those statements are protected. So the wife can't be forced to testify about those statements, and the husband can object to her testifying about them.

Spousal immunity: I think this is the one where a spouse can't be compelled to testify against the other. So in this case, the wife is being called by the prosecution to testify against her ex-husband. So the husband could object under spousal immunity, preventing her from testifying.

But wait, I thought that spousal immunity is not absolute. There's an exception when the crime is against the spouse or the spouse's children. For example, if the husband committed a crime against the wife, then she can testify. But in this case, the crime is embezzlement, which is against the employer, not the wife. So the exception wouldn't apply, meaning the spousal immunity would prevent her from testifying.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that in some jurisdictions, the spousal immunity only applies in criminal cases where the other spouse is the defendant, but it's the defendant spouse who holds the privilege. So the husband could assert the privilege to prevent the wife from testifying.

But wait, the question says that the jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. So both apply here.

So the husband's attorney is objecting to the wife testifying about the statements made during the marriage. So under the marital communication privilege, the husband can prevent her from testifying about those statements because they were made during the marriage. Additionally, under spousal immunity, the husband can prevent her from testifying against him in his criminal trial.

Wait, but I think the spousal immunity might not apply after the marriage has ended. Let me think: spousal immunity, as I recall, applies during the marriage and after. So even if they're divorced, the spouse can't be compelled to testify against the other. But in this case, the statements were made during the marriage, so the marital communication privilege would apply regardless of the current marital status.

So the wife's testimony about the husband's admission during the marriage would be inadmissible because of both privileges. But wait, let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: admissible under both privileges. No, because both privileges would prevent testimony.

Option B: inadmissible because she learned after divorce. No, because the statements were made during marriage.

Option C: inadmissible because husband didn't waive. I'm not sure about waiver here. If the husband is asserting the privilege, then he hasn't waived it.

Option D: inadmissible under either privilege. So maybe this is the case.

Option E: admissible under spousal but not marital. No, because both would apply.

Option F: admissible because privileges don't apply to financial crimes. I don't think so; the nature of the crime doesn't affect the privilege.

Option G: admissible because crime wasn't against wife. Hmm, but that relates to an exception for spousal immunity. Wait, if the crime was against the wife, then she could testify, but if it's not, then the spousal immunity applies. So if the crime is against someone else, then the spousal immunity would prevent her from testifying. So G says it's admissible because the crime wasn't against the wife, which would mean the spousal immunity applies, making it inadmissible. So G is incorrect.

Option H: admissible because wife wasn't an accomplice. I don't think that's relevant here. The accomplice rule is about whether the spouse's testimony can be used, but not about these privileges.

Option I: inadmissible because it was a private conversation between spouses. That sounds like the marital communication privilege. So I is a possible option.

Option J: admissible under marital but not spousal. No, because both would prevent testimony.

Wait, let me think again. The marital communication privilege covers statements made during the marriage, regardless of current marital status. So the wife can't testify about those statements because the husband can assert that privilege.

Spousal immunity would also prevent her from testifying against him in a criminal trial, except for crimes against herself or their children. Since embezzlement isn't such a crime, spousal immunity applies.

So the testimony would be inadmissible under both privileges. So looking at the options, which one says that? Let's see:

Option D says inadmissible under either privilege. So if either applies, the testimony is inadmissible. So D would be correct.

Wait, but I thought the question says the jurisdiction has both privileges. So the husband can assert either one. So the testimony is inadmissible under both, but the options don't have an option that says inadmissible under both. Let me check the options again.

Looking back: Option A says admissible under both, which is incorrect. Option D says inadmissible under either, which I think is correct because either privilege would make it inadmissible.

Wait, but another point: the spousal immunity is about testifying against the spouse in a criminal case. So the wife can't be forced to testify, but she can choose to. Wait, no, in this case, the prosecution is calling her, so she's being compelled. So the husband can object, invoking spousal immunity, to prevent her from testifying.

So in this scenario, the testimony is inadmissible because of both privileges. So the correct option would be that the testimony is inadmissible because either privilege applies.

Looking at the options, option D says "inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges." So that fits.

Wait, but another angle: the marital communication privilege applies to confidential communications made during the marriage. If the communication was made during the marriage, then it's covered, regardless of whether they're divorced now. So the husband can invoke the marital communication privilege to prevent the wife from testifying about his admissions.

Additionally, under spousal immunity, the wife can't be compelled to testify against her husband in a criminal case, unless it's a crime against her, which it's not. So the testimony is inadmissible under both.

But the question is, which option correctly states this? The options are:

A: admissible under both — no.

B: timing of learning — nope.

C: husband didn't waive — perhaps, but if he's objecting, he's asserting the privilege, so no waiver.

D: inadmissible under either — yes.

E: only spousal — no.

F: irrelevant.

G: no, because it's about the crime not being against her, but that makes spousal immunity applicable, making testimony inadmissible.

H: not relevant.

I: inadmissible because it was a private conversation — that's the marital privilege, so I is correct as well?

Wait, option I says "inadmissible because the husband's admission was a private conversation between spouses." That's the marital communication privilege. So if the court applies that, the testimony is inadmissible. But the spousal immunity is a separate reason. So the testimony is inadmissible under either privilege, so D is correct.

Wait, but some sources say that the marital communication privilege can be invoked even after the marriage ends, because it's about the communication during the marriage. So the husband can prevent her from testifying about that.

So the correct answer would be D: inadmissible under either.

Alternatively, option I says it's inadmissible because it's a private conversation, which is the marital privilege. So would that be the case?

Wait, but the question states that both privileges are available. So the husband can assert either one. So the testimony is inadmissible on either ground.

So the correct answer is D, which states that the testimony is inadmissible under either privilege.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a wife's testimony regarding statements her ex-husband made during their marriage about committing embezzlement. The jurisdiction recognizes both the common-law marital communication privilege and spousal immunity. Here's the analysis:

1. **Marital Communication Privilege**: This privilege protects confidential communications made during the marriage. Even after the divorce, statements made during the marriage remain protected under this privilege. The husband can object to the wife testifying about his admissions, as they were confidential communications made during the marriage.

2. **Spousal Immunity**: At common law, one spouse cannot be compelled to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding. This applies even after the marriage has ended, unless the crime involves the spouse or their children. Since the crime here is embezzlement (not against the wife), spousal immunity prevents the wife from being compelled to testify against the husband.

Given that both privileges apply, the wife's testimony about the husband's admissions during the marriage is inadmissible. The correct answer is:

**D: inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.**
