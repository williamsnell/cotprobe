Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the phase change of water into steam and calculating the external work done and the increase in internal energy. 

Alright, the problem says that one gram of water (which is 1 cm³) becomes 1671 cm³ of steam when boiled at 1 atm. The heat of vaporization is given as 539 cal/g. So I need to compute the external work and the internal energy change.

Wait, I remember that when a substance undergoes a phase change, like vaporization, it absorbs heat. The heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) is the amount of heat required to turn a liquid into gas. But how does that relate to internal energy and work done?

Oh right, the first law of thermodynamics says that the heat added to the system (Q) is equal to the change in internal energy (ΔU) plus the work done by the system (W). So Q = ΔU + W. But wait, in thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered positive when the system does work on the surroundings. So in this case, when the water vaporizes and expands, the system (steam) is doing work on the surroundings.

But wait, the formula I'm thinking of is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So maybe I should rearrange the first law accordingly. Yes, right: Q = ΔU + W, so ΔU = Q - W.

So the heat of vaporization Q is 539 cal. That's the heat absorbed by the water to turn into steam. But I also need to find the work done during this expansion because the steam occupies a much larger volume than the liquid water.

The work done during expansion is calculated using the formula W = P_ext * ΔV. Since the pressure is given as 1 atm, I think I need to convert that into units compatible with calories. Wait, because 1 L·atm is approximately 24.3 kcal, but here the units are in cm³ and calories.

Wait, 1 atm is about 1.01325e5 Pascals. But since we're dealing with cm³, maybe it's easier to convert everything into liters or something. Wait, 1 L is 1000 cm³. So 1671 cm³ is 1.671 liters. The initial volume is 1 cm³, so the change in volume ΔV is 1670 cm³, which is 1.670 liters.

So, external work W is P * ΔV. But wait, pressure is 1 atm. So W = (1 atm) * (1.670 L). 

Now, 1 L·atm is equal to approximately 24.3 cal. Because I remember that 1 cal is about 4.184 J, and 1 L·atm is about 101.325 J. So 101.325 J divided by 4.184 J/cal gives roughly 24.3 cal. So 1.670 L·atm would be 1.670 * 24.3 cal.

Let me calculate that: 1.670 * 24.3. Let's see, 1.6 *24.3 is 38.88, and 0.07 *24.3 is 1.701, so total about 40.581 cal. So approximately 40.58 cal. Hmm, but looking at the options, 41 cal is an option. So maybe I should round it to 41 cal, but wait, the initial calculation was 1.670 L·atm *24.3 cal/(L·atm) = 40.581 cal. So about 40.6 cal. Hmm, but let me check if the problem perhaps uses a different approximation. Maybe 24 cal per L·atm? Let me think.

Wait, 1 L·atm is 101.325 J, and 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 101.325 /4.184 is approximately 24.3. So 1.670 L·atm is 1.670 *24.3 = 40.58 cal. So that's about 40.6 cal. But the answer options have 41, 498, 539, etc. So 41 is the closest. So W is 41 cal.

Now, the heat of vaporization is 539 cal. So Q is 539 cal. Since Q = ΔU + W, we can rearrange to find ΔU = Q - W. So ΔU = 539 cal - 40.58 cal ≈ 498.42 cal. So approximately 498 cal.

Wait, but let me make sure: when the system is doing work on the surroundings, the work is positive. So when the steam expands, it's doing work, so W is positive. So the heat Q is the heat absorbed, which is 539 cal. Then ΔU is Q minus W. So yes, 539 - ~40.6 = 498.4 cal. So ΔU is approximately 498 cal.

Looking at the options:

Option B: External work:498 cal, Internal:539. No, because work is 40.6, not 498.

Option E: External 41, Internal 498. That would fit. So the external work is 41 cal, increase in internal energy is 498 cal.

Wait, wait, looking at the options, let me list them again:

Options:

A: W=1671, ΔU=539 → No, W is much smaller.

B: W=498, ΔU=539 → No, W is 41.

C: W=498, ΔU=41 → No.

D: W=41, ΔU=539 → No, because ΔU would be 498.

E: W=41, ΔU=498 → Yes, that's what I calculated.

F: W=41, ΔU=580 → No.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Because in the first law, Q is the heat added to the system. So the system is the water turning into steam. The heat of vaporization is the amount of heat needed, so Q=539 cal. The system is doing work on the surroundings (expanding), so W is positive. So ΔU = Q - W. So 539 - 40.6 = 498.4. So the internal energy increases by about 498 cal. So the external work is 41 cal, and internal energy is 498 cal. So the correct option is E.

To solve the problem, we use the first law of thermodynamics:  

\[
Q = \Delta U + W
\]

where \( Q \) is the heat added to the system, \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy, and \( W \) is the work done by the system. The heat of vaporization \( Q \) is given as \( 539 \, \text{cal} \), and the work done \( W \) is calculated using the formula:  

\[
W = P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

The pressure \( P_{\text{ext}} \) is \( 1 \, \text{atm} \), and the change in volume \( \Delta V \) is the difference between the final volume of steam (\( 1671 \, \text{cm}^3 \)) and the initial volume of water (\( 1 \, \text{cm}^3 \)), which is \( 1670 \, \text{cm}^3 \) or \( 1.670 \, \text{L} \).  

Using the conversion \( 1 \, \text{L·atm} = 24.3 \, \text{cal} \), the work done is:  

\[
W = (1 \, \text{atm})(1.670 \, \text{L}) = 1.670 \times 24.3 \, \text{cal} \approx 40.6 \, \text{cal}
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, \( W \approx 41 \, \text{cal} \).  

Substituting \( Q = 539 \, \text{cal} \) and \( W = 41 \, \text{cal} \) into the first law equation, the change in internal energy is:  

\[
\Delta U = Q - W = 539 \, \text{cal} - 41 \, \text{cal} = 498 \, \text{cal}
\]

Thus, the external work is \( 41 \, \text{cal} \), and the increase in internal energy is \( 498 \, \text{cal} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:  

**E: External work: 41 cal, Increase in internal energy: 498 cal**
