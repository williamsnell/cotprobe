Okay, so I have to evaluate the gradient of a scalar field f at the point (2, 3, 5). The function f is given by f(x₁, x₂, x₃) = 2 sin(x₁) - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^{x₂}(1). Hmm, wait, the last term is a bit confusing. Oh, maybe it's x₁ times e raised to x₂ multiplied by (1). Not sure, but I think that's the correct interpretation.

Wait, the function is written as f(x₁, x₂, x₃) = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂)(1). Maybe I should parse it correctly. Oh, I think the last term is x₁ multiplied by e raised to (x₂ * 1), or maybe e^(x₂) multiplied by 1. I think it's just x₁ e^{x₂} multiplied by 1, so it's x₁ e^{x₂}.

So, the function is f = 2 sin(x₁) - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^{x₂}.

Now, the gradient of f, which is ∇f, is a vector with the partial derivatives with respect to each variable. So, I need to compute the partial derivatives ∂f/∂x₁, ∂f/∂x₂, and ∂f/∂x₃, and evaluate each at the point (2,3,5).

Let me compute each partial derivative step by step.

First, ∂f/∂x₁. Let's take the derivative term by term.

The first term is 2 sin(x₁). The derivative with respect to x₁ is 2 cos(x₁).

The second term is -x₁² x₂ x₃. The derivative with respect to x₁ is -2x₁ x₂ x₃.

The third term is x₁ e^{x₂}. Since we're taking the derivative with respect to x₁, e^{x₂} is treated as a constant. So, the derivative is e^{x₂}.

So putting it all together, ∂f/∂x₁ = 2 cos(x₁) - 2 x₁ x₂ x₃ + e^{x₂}.

Next, ∂f/∂x₂. Again, term by term.

First term: 2 sin(x₁) derivative with respect to x₂ is 0.

Second term: -x₁² x₂ x₃. Derivative with respect to x₂ is -x₁² x₃.

Third term: x₁ e^{x₂}. The derivative here is x₁ e^{x₂}.

So ∂f/∂x₂ = -x₁² x₃ + x₁ e^{x₂}.

Now, ∂f/∂x₃. Again, term by term.

First term: 0.

Second term: -x₁² x₂ x₃. Derivative with respect to x₃ is -x₁² x₂.

Third term: x₁ e^{x₂} is treated as a constant, so derivative is 0.

So ∂f/∂x₃ = -x₁² x₂.

Now, I need to evaluate each of these partial derivatives at the point (2,3,5). So x₁=2, x₂=3, x₃=5.

Let's compute each component.

First, compute ∂f/∂x₁ at (2,3,5):

2 cos(2) - 2*(2)*(3)*(5) + e^{3}.

Calculate each part:

cos(2) is in radians. Let me remember the approximate value. cos(2) ≈ -0.4161.

So 2 * (-0.4161) ≈ -0.8322.

Next term: 2*(2)*(3)*(5) = 2*2*3*5=60. But with a negative sign, so -60.

Third term: e^3 is approximately 20.0855.

So putting it all together: -0.8322 -60 + 20.0855 = (-0.8322 -60) is -60.8322 + 20.0855 = approximately -40.7467.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first components are around 40.74, -30.74, etc. So maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 2 cos(2) is about 2*(-0.4161)= -0.8322.

Then, -2*(2)*(3)*(5) is -2*2*3*5 = -60.

Then, plus e^3, which is about 20.0855.

So total: (-0.8322) + (-60) + 20.0855 = (-0.8322 -60) is -60.8322 + 20.0855 = -40.7467.

Wait, so that's approximately -40.7467. But looking at the options, the first components are either positive or negative, such as option A:40.74, option D:30.74, option E:40.74, etc.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when taking the derivative. Let me check the function again.

The function f is 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂}.

So the second term is negative, so when taking the derivative with respect to x₁, it's -2x₁ x₂ x₃.

So that part is correct.

Wait, let me see if the point is (2,3,5). So x₁=2, x₂=3, x₃=5.

So x₁=2, x₂=3, x₃=5.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated something. Let me compute each term again.

Compute 2 cos(2):

2 * cos(2 radians) ≈ 2 * (-0.4161) = -0.8322.

Next term: -2 *2 *3 *5 = -60.

Third term: e^3 ≈ 20.0855.

So adding: (-0.8322) + (-60) + 20.0855.

Wait, that's (-0.8322 -60) = -60.8322 + 20.0855 = -40.7467.

So about -40.75. But looking at the options, the first component in the options doesn't have -40.74. Let's look. Option B starts with -30.74, option F is -40.74. Wait, but option F's first component is -40.74, but then the other components may not match.

Wait, let me compute the other components and see.

Now, the second component is ∂f/∂x₂: -x₁² x₃ + x₁ e^{x₂}.

At (2,3,5), x₁=2, x₂=3, x₃=5.

So, - (2^2)*5 + 2 e^3.

Compute each term:

- (4)*5 = -20.

Plus 2 * e^3 ≈ 2 * 20.0855 ≈ 40.171.

So total: -20 +40.171 = 20.171. Approximately 20.17.

Third component, ∂f/∂x₃: -x₁² x₂.

At (2,3,5): -(2^2)*3 = -(4)*3 = -12.

So putting it all together, the gradient is approximately (-40.75, 20.17, -12).

Now, looking at the options:

Option E: (40.74, 20.17, -12). So first component is positive, but our calculation is negative. So maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me check the first component again. Did I get the sign wrong?

Wait, the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂}.

The partial derivative with respect to x₁ is 2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ + e^{x₂}.

Wait, wait: The third term is x₁ e^{x₂}, so the derivative is e^{x₂}, correct. But wait, the first term's derivative is 2 cos x₁, correct.

So, at x₁=2, 2 cos(2) is about -0.832. Minus 2*2*3*5=60, so -60. Plus e^3 ≈ 20.0855.

So total is -0.832 -60 +20.0855 = approximately -40.7465, which is about -40.75.

So the first component is -40.75, second is +20.17, third is -12.

Looking at the options:

Option F: (-40.74, 20.17, -12). That matches exactly.

Wait, but let's check the options again. Option J is (40.74, 20.17,12). No, because third component here is -12.

Option E is (40.74, 20.17, -12). That would have first component positive. But our calculation is negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the function. Let me double-check the function provided.

Wait the user wrote f(x1, x2, x3) = 2 sin x1 -x1^2 x2 x3 +x1 e^{x2}(1). Oh, wait, perhaps the last term is x1 e^{x2 *1}? Or maybe it's x1 e^{x2} multiplied by 1, which doesn't change anything. So the term remains x1 e^{x2}.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the function correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the function. Let me read it again.

"the scalar field f is given by f(x₁, x₂, x₃) = 2 sin x₁ − x₁²x₂x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂)(1)"

Hmm, perhaps the last term is x₁ e^(x₂ *1), which is same as x₁ e^{x₂}, which is what I used.

So, if my calculation yields (-40.74, 20.17, -12), then which option matches that?

Looking at the options:

Option F: (-40.74, 20.17, -12). That's exactly what I have.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: (40.74, -20.17, 12)

B: (-30.74, 10.17, -2)

C: (0,40.34,24)

D: (30.74,10.17, 2)

E: (40.74,20.17,-12)

F: (-40.74,20.17,-12)

G: (30.74,-20.17,-12)

H: (-40.74,-20.17,12)

I: (-30.74,-10.17,2)

J: (40.74,20.17,12)

Yes, option F is (-40.74,20.17,-12), which matches our computed gradient.

Wait, but in the options, is the third component correct? Let me recheck.

Yes, in our calculation, the third component is -12, which matches option F.

So the correct answer should be option F.

But wait, wait, let me double-check my calculations once more to be sure.

Compute ∂f/∂x₁ again:

2 cos(2) = approx 2*(-0.4161) = -0.8322.

-2*(2)*(3)*(5) = -60.

+ e^3 ≈20.0855.

Sum: -0.8322 -60 +20.0855 = (-0.8322 -60) = -60.8322 +20.0855 = -40.7467 ≈-40.75.

Yes.

∂f/∂x₂:

- (2^2)*5 + 2 e^3.

-4*5 =-20.

2*20.0855≈40.171.

Total: 20.171.

∂f/∂x₃: - (2^2)*3 = -12.

So gradient is (-40.75, 20.17, -12).

Looking at the options, option F matches this.

But wait, let me check if any other option matches. For example, option E has (40.74, 20.17, -12), which is first component positive. So that's not matching.

So the correct choice is option F.
