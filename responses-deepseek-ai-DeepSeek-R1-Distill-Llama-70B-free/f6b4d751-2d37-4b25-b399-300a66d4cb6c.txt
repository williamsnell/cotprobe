Okay, so I've got this question about sexual objectification in the context of a relationship where both partners deny each other's humanity. Hmm, I need to figure out what Papadaki thinks about this. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that sexual objectification is when someone is treated as an object for sexual gratification, rather than as a person with their own agency and feelings. It's often discussed in terms of reducing a person to just their physical attributes.

The question gives a scenario where both partners mutually deny each other's humanity. So, they're both treating each other as less than human, perhaps just using each other for sex without regard for each other's feelings or autonomy.

I think about what the options are. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the context is irrelevant. That doesn't sound right because context usually matters in these discussions. Like, in a healthy relationship, even if there's some objectification, it's within a context of mutual respect, so maybe it's not harmful. But if the context is negative, like denying humanity, then objectification is more likely.

Option B states that sexual objectification occurs. That's possible, but I'm not sure if it's always the case. It might depend on more factors.

Option C suggests the context determines whether objectification happened. That makes sense because the nature of their relationship and how they treat each other would influence whether objectification is occurring.

Option D says it's only valid in a non-mutual context. I don't think that's right because mutual denial doesn't necessarily preclude objectification; in fact, it might make it more likely.

Option E limits it to physical abuse, which seems too narrow. Objectification can be emotional or psychological too.

Option F claims both are incapable of objectifying each other, which doesn't make sense because mutual denial could mean they're both doing it.

Option G says there's no straightforward answer. That could be possible, but I think the question implies Papadaki has a specific stance.

Option H says objectification doesn't occur. That seems unlikely because denying someone's humanity sounds like a form of objectification.

Option I says one partner is always the objectifier. But the question says it's mutual, so both might be doing it, not just one.

Option J claims neither can objectify the other, which again contradicts the mutual denial.

Wait, I think the key here is whether mutual denial leads to objectification. If both are denying each other's humanity, they're likely treating each other as objects. So does the context matter in determining if objectification occurs?

Papadaki's view, I think, is that context matters. So in this case, the fact that they're in a relationship where they mutually deny humanity would mean that the context determines whether objectification is happening. So option C would be the choice because the context (their mutual denial) affects whether objectification occurs.

Alternatively, option B is that objectification occurs, but I'm not sure if it's a definite yes. Because maybe in some contexts, mutual respect exists despite some objectification. But in this case, mutual denial of humanity probably leads to objectification, so maybe B is correct.

Wait, no. The question is about Papadaki's view. I think she argues that context is crucial. So if both partners are denying each other's humanity, that context would mean that objectification is occurring. So perhaps option C is correct because it's the context that decides.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question says, "Papadaki thinks that in cases where partners mutually deny each other's humanity that..." So the options are about what she thinks happens. 

From what I remember, Papadaki's argument is that sexual objectification is context-dependent. So in some contexts, like mutual and respectful relationships where both agree to certain dynamics, objectification might not be harmful. But in cases where the context involves denying humanity, then objectification is likely occurring.

So in this scenario, the mutual denial is the context, and Papadaki would say that in such a context, sexual objectification occurs. So that would point to option B, that sexual objectification occurs.

Wait, but option C says the context determines whether it occurred. So, if the context is mutual denial, then it does occur. So the answer would be C if she's saying that context matters, and in this particular context, it does happen.

Alternatively, maybe she's saying that context determines it, so the answer is C, but in this specific case, the context leads to objectification. So the correct option would be B.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. Papadaki's view is that objectification isn't always morally wrong; it depends on the context. So in a relationship where there's mutual respect and care, even if there's some objectification, it's not harmful. But when the context is one where humanity is denied, then it's problematic.

So in the question's scenario, mutual denial of humanity is the context. Therefore, in such a context, objectification occurs. So the answer would be that sexual objectification occurs, which is option B.

But wait, another angle: the question is about whether Papadaki thinks that in such cases, does objectification occur. If she argues that context determines whether it's objectification, then the answer would be C. Because the context (mutual denial) determines it.

Wait, maybe I should look up some notes. Oh right, Papadaki's view is that objectification is not inherently wrong; it's the context that matters. So in cases where mutual denial of humanity occurs, the context would imply that objectification is happening. Therefore, the answer would be C: the context determines whether sexual objectification occurred.

Wait, no. The context is already given as mutual denial, so in that context, does objectification occur? Or does the context being mutual denial mean that objectification is determined by that.

Alternatively, the statement is: in cases where partners mutually deny each other's humanity, what does Papadaki think? She might think that in such cases, objectification does occur because they're treating each other as less than human, which is a form of objectification.

So the answer would be B, that sexual objectification occurs.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if she says that context determines it, then the answer is C. Because the context (mutual denial) would mean that objectification is present. So the answer is C.

Wait, the question is about what Papadaki thinks in such cases. So according to her theory, when both partners deny each other's humanity, does objectification happen? Her view is that objectification is context-dependent, so the context here is mutual denial. Therefore, in this context, objectification occurs. So the answer would be B.

Alternatively, if the question is whether she thinks that context determines whether it's objectification, then the answer is C.

Wait, the wording of the question is: "Papadaki thinks that in cases where partners... that..." So what does she think about those cases? She thinks that in those cases, the context determines whether objectification occurs. So the answer is C.

Wait, no. If the context is mutual denial, then the context is already part of the scenario. So in such a context, does objectification occur? So she would say yes, because mutual denial implies a lack of respect for each other's humanity, which is a form of objectification. So the answer is B.

I'm a bit torn between B and C. Let me think of another approach. The options are about what Papadaki's position is. If she argues that context is key, then in the given context (mutual denial), the context determines whether objectification happens. So the answer would be C, because the context (mutual denial) will determine it. But in this case, the context is mutual denial, so she would say that in such a context, objectification does occur. So the answer is B.

Wait, but option C says that the context will determine whether it occurred. So in this case, the context is mutual denial, which would mean that objectification does occur. Therefore, the answer would be C because the context (which is mutual denial) leads to objectification. But the question is about what she thinks in such cases, so she would say that in such cases, the context (which is mutual denial) means that objectification occurs. So the answer is B.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The question is about mutual denial of humanity. If both partners are denying each other's humanity, then they are treating each other as objects. So in such a case, sexual objectification occurs. Therefore, the answer is B.

But another thought: maybe mutual denial doesn't necessarily mean they're objectifying each other sexually. It could be emotional denial. But the question is about sexual objectification, so if they're denying each other's humanity, that could include treating each other as sexual objects.

So, I think the correct answer is B: sexual objectification occurs.

The question revolves around Papadaki's view on sexual objectification in cases where partners mutually deny each other's humanity. Sexual objectification refers to treating someone as an object for sexual gratification rather than as a person with agency and feelings. The key is understanding Papadaki's stance on how context influences objectification.

Option A suggests context is irrelevant, which contradicts the idea that context matters in determining objectification. Option B states that sexual objectification occurs, which aligns with the idea that mutual denial of humanity likely leads to objectification. Option C argues that the context determines whether objectification occurs, which reflects Papadaki's emphasis on context-dependency. Option D limits objectification to non-mutual contexts, which seems incorrect since mutual denial could still involve objectification. Option E restricts objectification to physical abuse, which is too narrow. Option F claims mutual denial prevents objectification, which is inconsistent with the scenario. Option G suggests no straightforward answer, but the question implies Papadaki has a clear stance. Option H claims objectification does not occur, which seems unlikely given the mutual denial of humanity. Option I suggests only one partner objectifies, which contradicts the mutual nature of the scenario. Option J claims neither partner can objectify, which is inconsistent with the mutual denial.

Papadaki's view is that objectification is context-dependent. In this scenario, the context is mutual denial of humanity, which likely leads to objectification. Therefore, the correct answer is that sexual objectification occurs.
