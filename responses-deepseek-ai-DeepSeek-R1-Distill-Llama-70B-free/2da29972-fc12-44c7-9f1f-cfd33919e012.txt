Question:

World Bank data show that in 1995, the poorest 20% of households accounted for 7.5% of household income in Niger, the next 20% of households accounted for 11.8% of income, the middle 20% accounted for 15.5% of income, the second richest 20% accounted for 21.1% of income, and the top 20% accounted for 44.1% of income. What was the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households in Niger?

Okay, so I've got this question about income distribution in Niger based on World Bank data from 1995. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question is asking for the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households. Hmm, cumulative meaning I need to add up the shares of each group until I reach 60% of the population. 

Looking at the data provided, the poorest 20% accounted for 7.5% of income. The next 20% (so that's 40% cumulative) had 11.8%. Then the middle 20% (which brings us to 60%) had 15.5%. 

Wait, so the bottom 60% would be the first three groups: the poorest, next, and middle. So I just add their percentages together. Let me calculate that: 7.5 plus 11.8 is 19.3, and then adding 15.5 gives me 34.8. 

So the total for the bottom 60% is 34.8%. Now I need to look at the answer options. Option B is 34.80%, which matches my calculation. 

I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The top 20% have a much larger share, but that's not needed for the bottom 60. Adding the first three groups definitely gives me 34.8%, so I'm confident that's the right answer.

The cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households in Niger is calculated by adding the shares of the poorest 20% (7.5%), the next 20% (11.8%), and the middle 20% (15.5%). 

7.5% + 11.8% + 15.5% = 34.8%.

The correct answer is **B: 34.80%**.
