Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the decomposition of solid ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) into nitrogen monoxide (N2O) and water (H2O). They give the reaction equation: NH4NO3 → N2O + 2H2O. Then, they say that 900 grams of NH4NO3 decompose almost instantly, and we need to find the total volume of gas formed at 1092°C. The options are all in liters, so I need to calculate the volume.

Hmm, right. So I think this is a stoichiometry problem involving gases and the ideal gas law. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll write down the balanced equation. Wait, wait, the equation given in the problem is already balanced? Let me check. On the left, we have one NH4NO3. On the right, one N2O and two H2O. Let's count the atoms:

NH4NO3 has 2 N from NH4+ and one from NO3-, so 3 N total. Wait, wait, no. NH4+ has one N, NO3^- has one N. So total N is 2 in NH4NO3. Wait, no: NH4NO3 is composed of NH4+ and NO3^- ions. So each has one N, so total two N per formula unit. Then on the product side: N2O has 2 N, and H2O has none. So 2 N total on the right. So that's balanced for N.

Hydrogen: NH4+ has 4 H, H2O has 2 each, so 2*2=4 H. So that's balanced. Oxygen: NH4NO3 has 3 O from NO3^- and 4*(O from H2O) is 4 O? Wait, no—NH4NO3 is (NH4+)(NO3^-). So the O in NH4NO3 is 3 (from NO3^-). On the product side, N2O has 1 O, H2O has (2*O) → 2 O each, so 2*2=4 O? Wait, wait no, the equation is N2O + 2H2O. So N2O contributes 1 O, and each H2O contributes 1 O, so 2 H2O contribute 2 O. So total O on product side is 1 + 2 =3. Which matches the NH4NO3's O. So the equation is balanced as written.

So the balanced equation is NH4NO3 → N2O + 2 H2O.

Wait, but wait—what about the phases? The problem says the reaction produces hot gases, so I think N2O and H2O are gases. Oh, but wait, at high temperatures, water can be a gas (steam), so both products are gases.

So, the first step is to find the moles of NH4NO3 that decompose.

The molar mass of NH4NO3: Let me calculate that. NH4NO3 is ammonium nitrate. Nitrogen is 14 g/mol, H is 1, O is 16.

So NH4NO3: N is 14 * 2 = 28 (since there are two N atoms), H is 4 (from NH4), and O is 3 (from NO3) * 16 = 48. Wait wait, no: Wait, the formula is NH4NO3. So number of each atom: N: 2 (one from NH4 and one from NO3), H:4, O:3.

So molar mass = (14*2) + (1*4) + (16*3) = 28 +4 +48 = 80 g/mol.

Wait, 14*2 is 28, 1*4 is 4, 16*3 is 48. 28+4=32, 32+48=80. Yes.

So the molar mass is 80 g/mol.

Given 900 g of NH4NO3. Moles = mass/molar mass = 900 g /80 g/mol = 11.25 mol.

So 11.25 moles of NH4NO3 decompose.

Now, from the balanced equation, 1 mole of NH4NO3 produces 1 mole of N2O and 2 moles of H2O. But wait, wait, no. Let me count: the equation is 1 NH4NO3 → 1 N2O + 2 H2O. So per mole of NH4NO3, we get 1 mole N2O and 2 moles H2O.

But wait, the H2O here is in gaseous form? Well, the problem says the decomposition produces hot gases, so I think H2O is gaseous. So we can treat it as a gas.

Wait, but wait. The reaction produces N2O and H2O as gases. So the total moles of gas produced would be the moles of N2O plus the moles of H2O.

So for each mole of NH4NO3, we get 1 mole of N2O and 2 moles of H2O, so 1 + 2 =3 moles of gas.

So total moles of gas = 3 * moles of NH4NO3.

Moles of NH4NO3 is 11.25, so moles of gas = 3 *11.25 = 33.75 moles.

Now, to find the volume, we can use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But since we're dealing with volume at a certain temperature, probably using the combined gas law or PV =nRT approach.

We can assume that pressure is standard atmospheric pressure, but the question doesn't specify, so I think we can assume it's at standard conditions. Wait, but the temperature is given as 1092°C. So we have to calculate the volume at that temperature.

Wait, let me think. The ideal gas law relates P, V, n, R, and T. Since the problem gives the temperature, but doesn't mention pressure, perhaps we can assume standard pressure (1 atm), but without that information, maybe it's better to see if the question expects using the ideal gas law with the given temperature, regardless of pressure. Or perhaps, wait, another approach: use the molar volume at given temperature.

Wait, but I don't remember the molar volume at 1092°C. Alternatively, using the ideal gas law.

So, let's proceed with the ideal gas law. We have n=33.75 moles, T=1092°C, which is 1365 K (since 1092 + 273.15 = 1365.15 K, approx 1365 K). Pressure P we can assume is 1 atm, but wait, the question doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps that's a problem. Because without knowing P, I can't compute V directly.

Wait, looking at the question again: it says "what total volume of gas in liters forms at 1092°C." It doesn't mention pressure, so perhaps it's assuming standard pressure, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe it's using the molar volume at that temperature, but again, that's not standard. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's using the ideal gas law and rearranging to find V.

So, let's write the ideal gas law: V = (nRT)/P.

Assuming P is 1 atm, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So let's plug in the numbers.

n =33.75 mol.

R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T=1365 K.

P=1 atm.

So V = (33.75 * 0.0821 *1365 ) /1.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute 33.75 *0.0821 = ?

33.75 *0.08 = 2.7.

0.0821 is 0.08 + 0.0021.

So 33.75 *0.0021 = 0.070875.

So total is approx 2.7 +0.070875 = 2.770875.

Then multiply by 1365.

So 2.770875 * 1365.

Hmm, let me compute that.

Well, 2.770875 * 1000 = 2770.875.

2.770875 * 300 = 831.2625.

2.770875 * 65 = ?

Let's compute 2.770875 *60= 166.2525.

2.770875 *5=13.854375.

So 166.2525 +13.854375 =180.106875.

Now sum all three: 2770.875 + 831.2625 =3602.1375 +180.106875= 3782.244375 liters.

Wait, that's approximately 3782 liters. Looking at the options, option H is 3780 l. So that's very close.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because the options have H as 3780. Let me recalculate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the steps. Let me try a more precise approach.

V = (33.75 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (1365 K) / (1 atm).

So 33.75 *0.0821 = ?

Let me compute 33.75 * 0.0821.

33.75 * 0.08 = 2.7.

33.75 *0.0021 = 0.070875.

So 2.7 + 0.070875 = 2.770875.

Then 2.770875 *1365 = ?

Let me compute 2.770875 *1365:

Break it down:

2.770875 *1000 = 2770.875

2.770875 *300 = 831.2625

2.770875 *60 = 166.2525

2.770875 *5=13.854375

Now sum 300+60+5=365, and 2770.875 + (831.2625 +166.2525 +13.854375).

Wait, 831.2625 +166.2525 =997.515; 997.515 +13.854375=1011.369375.

So total V=2770.875 + 1011.369375 = 3782.244375 liters.

So approximately 3782 liters, which is very close to option H: 3780 l.

But wait, let me check if I considered all the steps correctly.

Wait another thing: the problem might have used a different value for R. For example, sometimes R is taken as 0.08206 or 0.0821.

Wait, using R=0.0821, let me compute 33.75 *0.0821= 2.770875 as before.

2.770875 *1365:

Hmm, perhaps there's a more precise way to compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Compute 2 *1365 =2730.

0.770875 *1365: 0.7 *1365= 955.5; 0.070875 *1365= let's compute 0.07 *1365=95.55, and 0.000875*1365≈1.194.

So 0.7 part: 955.5 + 95.55=1051.05; plus 1.194 is 1052.244.

So 2.770875 *1365 = (2*1365) + (0.770875 *1365) = 2730 + 1052.244=3782.244 L.

So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, H is 3780 l, which is very close to our calculation, probably rounded.

So the correct answer would be H: 3780 l.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the stoichiometry part.

In the equation, 1 mol NH4NO3 produces 1 mol N2O and 2 mol H2O.

So total gas moles per mole of NH4NO3 is 3.

So 900g NH4NO3 is 900/80 = 11.25 mol.

Thus, gas moles: 11.25 *3=33.75.

So that's correct.

So the calculation is correct. The volume is approximately 3782 liters, which matches option H (3780 l).
</think>

To solve the problem, we start with the decomposition reaction:

\[
\text{NH}_4\text{NO}_3 \rightarrow \text{N}_2\text{O} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

### Step 1: Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃
The molar mass of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Molar mass} = (14 \times 2) + (1 \times 4) + (16 \times 3) = 28 + 4 + 48 = 80 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Moles of NH₄NO₃
Given 900 g of NH₄NO₃, the number of moles is:
\[
\text{Moles of NH}_4\text{NO}_3 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{900}{80} = 11.25 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Moles of Gas Produced
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ produces 1 mole of N₂O and 2 moles of H₂O. Thus, the total moles of gas produced per mole of NH₄NO₃ is:
\[
1 + 2 = 3 \, \text{moles of gas}.
\]
For 11.25 moles of NH₄NO₃, the total moles of gas are:
\[
\text{Total moles of gas} = 11.25 \times 3 = 33.75 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Volume of Gas Using the Ideal Gas Law
The ideal gas law is:
\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P},
\]
where:
- \( n = 33.75 \, \text{mol} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \),
- \( T = 1092^\circ \text{C} = 1365 \, \text{K} \),
- \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \) (assumed standard pressure).

Substituting the values:
\[
V = \frac{(33.75)(0.0821)(1365)}{1}.
\]

First, calculate \( 33.75 \times 0.0821 \):
\[
33.75 \times 0.0821 = 2.770875.
\]

Then, multiply by 1365:
\[
2.770875 \times 1365 = 3782.244 \, \text{L}.
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
The calculated volume is approximately \( 3782 \, \text{L} \), which is very close to option **H: 3780 L**. The slight difference is likely due to rounding.
