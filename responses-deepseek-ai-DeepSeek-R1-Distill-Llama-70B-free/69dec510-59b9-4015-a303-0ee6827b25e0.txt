Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a flywheel. Hmm, let me read it again. The flywheel is a uniform disk with a diameter of 4.0 feet and weighs 600 pounds. We need to find its angular acceleration when a net torque of 225 lb-ft is applied. Oh right, the formula for rotational inertia is given as I = (1/2) m R², where m is mass and R is radius. 

Wait, right, torque (τ) is related to angular acceleration (α) by τ = I α. So I'll probably need to find I first and then solve for α. But first, I think I need to convert some units because the weight is given in pounds and the diameter in feet. Oh wait, rotational inertia uses mass, not weight. So I'll have to convert the weight in pounds to mass in slugs since in the English system, weight (W) is mass (m) times gravity (g). 

Gravity near Earth's surface is about 32.2 ft/s². So mass m = weight / g = 600 lb / 32.2 ft/s². Let me compute that. 600 divided by 32.2... Let me approximate that. 32.2 times 18 is about 580, so 600-580 is 20 left, so 18 and 20/32.2, which is approximately 18.62 slugs. Wait, wait, let me do exact calculation. 

600 / 32.2 = approximately 18.63 slugs. Let me note that m ≈ 18.63 slugs.

Next, the diameter is 4.0 ft, so the radius R is 2.0 ft. So R = 2 ft.

Now, rotational inertia I is (1/2) m R². Plugging in the numbers: I = 0.5 * 18.63 * (2)^2. So 2 squared is 4. 0.5 * 18.63 is 9.315. Then multiply by 4: 9.315 *4 = 37.26 slug-ft². So I ≈ 37.26 slug-ft².

Wait, but wait, the torque is given in lb-ft. Hmm, torque is force times distance, so in English units, torque is in lb-ft. Rotational inertia is in slug-ft², and angular acceleration is in rad/s². The formula τ = I α, so α = τ / I.

So τ is 225 lb-ft. I is 37.26 slug-ft². So α = 225 / 37.26. Let's calculate that.

Dividing 225 by 37.26. Let me see, 37.26 * 6 = 223.56. That's close to 225. So 6 would give 223.56, so 225-223.56 is 1.44. 1.44 /37.26 is about 0.0386. So 6.0386 rad/s². Approximately 6.04. But the options don't seem to have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is 6.3, D is 5.9, F is 4.8, etc. Wait, I thought my calculation was about 6.04, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check that. Weight is 600 lb, so mass m = 600 / 32.2 ft/s². Let me compute that more accurately. 600 divided by 32.2.

32.2 * 18 = 579.6. 600-579.6=20.4. So 20.4 /32.2 = approximately 0.633, so m≈18.633 slugs. That seems right.

Then I is (1/2) m R². R is 2 ft, so R² is 4. So 0.5 * 18.633 *4 = 0.5 *74.532 = 37.266 slug-ft². So I is correct.

Torque is 225 lb-ft. So α = 225 /37.266. Let me compute that more accurately. 37.266 * 6 = 223.596. 225-223.596 =1.404. So 1.404 /37.266 ≈ 0.03768. So total α ≈6.03768 rad/s², approximately 6.04.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.3. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me think again.

Wait a second! Maybe I messed up with the formula for rotational inertia. The problem statement says the rotational inertia is I = (1/2)m R². That's correct for a solid disk. So that's right.

Wait another thought: The flywheel is uniform. So yes, I = 0.5 m R². So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert feet to meters or something? No, because all units in English should be consistent. Torque is lb-ft, I is in slug-ft², so α will be in rad/s², which is correct.

Wait, another angle: Did I mix up diameter and radius? The diameter is 4 ft, so radius is 2 ft. Correct. So R² is 4. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the exact value of 225 /37.266. Let me compute that.

37.266 * 6 = 223.596. So 225 is 1.404 more.

1.404 /37.266 ≈ 0.03768. So total is 6.03768 ≈6.04 rad/s².

But looking at the options, the closest is option A (6.3) and D (5.9). Wait, but 6.04 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass. Let me recompute m.

m = 600 lb / 32.2 ft/s² = 600 /32.2. Let me calculate this accurately.

32.2 * 18 = 579.6.

600 -579.6 =20.4.

20.4 /32.2 = 0.633 approximately.

So m=18.633 slugs.

Then I=0.5*18.633*(2)^2 = 0.5*18.633*4 = 0.5*74.532=37.266.

So that's correct.

Wait, let me compute 225 /37.266 exactly.

37.266 * 6 = 223.596.

So 225 is 1.404 more than 223.596.

So 1.404 /37.266 = approximately 0.03768.

So 6.03768, which is approximately 6.04 rad/s².

Wait, but none of the options match 6.04. The options are A:6.3, D:5.9, etc. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the torque was given in lb-ft, but I forgot to convert to slug-ft units. Wait, no, torque is correctly in lb-ft, and I is in slug-ft². Because in the formula τ = I α, the units would be (slug*ft²) * (rad/s²) = slug*ft²*(1/s²) * 1 rad. Torque is lb*ft, which is (slug * ft/s²) * ft = slug*ft²/s². So the units match. So calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the division. Let me try 225 divided by 37.266.

So 37.266 *6 =223.596.

So 225-223.596=1.404.

So 1.404 /37.266 ≈0.03768.

So 6.03768, so 6.038 rad/s², which is approximately 6.04.

Looking back at the options, the closest option is A:6.3, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps the given options have rounded differently.

Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 225 /37.266.

37.266 ×6 =223.596.

Subtract that from 225: 1.404.

Now, 1.404 ÷37.266. Let me compute this division more precisely.

37.266 goes into 1.404 how many times?

Well, 37.266 is about 37. So 1.404 /37.266 ≈ 0.03768.

So 6.03768, which is about 6.04.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Wait, 600 lb weight is 600 lb-force. So mass m is 600 /32.2 ft/s².

Wait, 32.2 is approximately 32.174, which is standard gravity. Maybe using 32.2 is fine.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute m more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach.

600 divided by 32.2 equals:

Compute 600 /32.2.

32.2 ×18 = 579.6.

600 -579.6 =20.4.

20.4 /32.2 = 0.633.

So m =18.633 slugs. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for I. Oh wait, no, the formula is correct. I is ½ m R².

Wait another thought: Maybe the torque is in lb-ft and I in slug-ft², but perhaps I missed a conversion factor. Because 1 lb-ft is equal to (1 slug*ft²/s²) because F = ma. So 1 lb = 1 slug * 32.2 ft/s². So 1 lb-ft = 32.2 slug*ft²/s².

Wait, no, because:

Torque (τ) is force times distance. Force in lb is mass times acceleration in ft/s². So 1 lb = 1 slug * 32.2 ft/s².

So torque in lb-ft is (slug * ft/s²) * ft = slug * ft²/s².

Rotational inertia I is in slug*ft².

So τ = I * α → α = τ / I → (slug*ft²/s²) / (slug*ft²) ) → 1/s². So units are correct.

So the calculation seems correct, but the result doesn't match any option exactly. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:6.3

B:3.5

C:2.4

D:5.9

E:8.1

F:4.8

G:1.8

H:9.0

I:7.2

J:4.2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 225 /37.266.

Let me do it more accurately.

37.266 ×6 = 223.596.

Remaining: 225 −223.596 =1.404.

So 1.404 /37.266 = approx 0.03768.

So 6.03768. So approximately 6.04 rad/s².

But none of the options are 6.04. The closest options are A:6.3 and D:5.9. Hmm, that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait another thought: Did I correctly convert pounds to slugs? Weight in pounds is force, so mass is force divided by g.

Yes, m = W / g. W=600 lb, g=32.2 ft/s².

So m=600/32.2 ≈18.63 slugs.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for g, like 32 ft/s² instead of 32.2. Let me try that.

If g=32, then m =600/32 =18.75 slugs.

Then I =0.5 *18.75*(2)^2 =0.5 *18.75 *4 =0.5 *75 =37.5 slug-ft².

Then α=225/37.5=6 rad/s².

Hmm, 6. But looking at the options, the closest is A:6.3, but 6 isn't an option. Wait, perhaps I need to compute more accurately.

Wait, 225 divided by 37.5 is exactly 6. So if I had used g=32, I get exactly 6.0 rad/s². But 6.0 isn't an option either. The closest is A:6.3 and D:5.9.

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the torque? Wait, the torque is given as 225 lb-ft. So that's correct. Maybe I made a mistake in the radius. Wait, diameter is 4 ft, radius 2 ft. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for I is wrong? No, the problem states I=(1/2)m R², which is correct for a disk.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the weight is 600 lb, which is correct.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me recompute everything with exact numbers.

Weight W =600 lb.

Mass m =600 /32.2 =600 ÷32.2.

Compute 600 ÷32.2:

32.2 ×18 =579.6

600−579.6=20.4.

20.4 ÷32.2 = 0.633.

So m=18.633 slugs.

I=0.5 *18.633*(2)^2 =0.5 *18.633 *4.

18.633 *4 =74.532.

0.5 *74.532=37.266.

Torque τ=225 lb-ft.

Then, α=τ/I =225/37.266.

Let me compute this accurately.

37.266 ×6 =223.596.

225−223.596=1.404.

1.404 ÷37.266 = approximately 0.03768.

So α=6.03768 rad/s² ≈6.04.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, maybe I inverted something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is τ=I * α → α=τ/I.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the rotational inertia is supposed to be (1/2) m R squared, but perhaps I should have used diameter instead of radius? No, because the formula uses R, the radius. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should use the formula I = (1/2) m d², where d is diameter? No, because R is radius, so d=2R, so I=(1/2) m (d/2)^2 *4? Wait, no. Let me see.

Wait, no. I = (1/2) m R². Since R is d/2, then I = (1/2) m (d/2)^2 = (1/2) m d² /4 = m d² /8.

Alternatively, I could compute I using diameter as I=(1/8) m d². Let me try that approach.

Given that, d=4 ft. So I=(1/8) m (4)^2 = (1/8)*m*16 =2m.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: (4)^2 is 16, 16/8 is 2. So I=2m. But wait, m is 18.63 slugs, so I=2*18.63=37.26, which matches what I calculated earlier. So that's correct.

So that approach doesn't change anything. So I is 37.26.

Hmm. It's possible that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the torque value.

Wait, the torque is given as 225 lb-ft. So that's correct.

Wait, let me see the options again. Oh, option A is 6.3, which is close to my calculation of 6.04. But that's a 0.26 difference. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check my calculation of 225/37.266 again.

37.266 × 6 =223.596.

So 225-223.596=1.404.

1.404 /37.266 ≈0.03768.

So 6.03768.

Alternatively, 225 ÷37.266 =?

Let me compute 37.266 ×6 =223.596.

So 225 =37.266 ×6 +1.404.

So 1.404 /37.266 = approx 0.03768.

So total is 6.03768.

Wait, perhaps the options have rounded to one decimal place, so 6.04 would be approximately 6.0. But none of the options have 6.0.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement. Oh, the problem says the flywheel is a uniform disk, which I considered. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula in terms of weight instead of mass to see if that changes anything.

Wait, weight W = m g → m = W/g.

So I = (1/2) m R² = (1/2) (W/g) R².

So I = (W R²) / (2g).

Then, torque τ = I α → α = τ / I = τ / (W R²/(2g)) ) = (2 g τ) / (W R²).

So plugging in numbers:

g =32.2 ft/s².

τ=225 lb-ft.

W=600 lb.

R=2 ft.

So α = (2 *32.2 *225) / (600 * (2)^2).

Compute numerator: 2 *32.2 *225 = 64.4 *225.

64 *225 = 14,400.

0.4 *225=90. So total 14,490.

Denominator:600 *4=2400.

So α =14,490 /2400.

Calculate that: 14,490 ÷2400.

2400 ×6=14,400.

14,490-14,400=90.

90/2400=0.0375.

So α=6.0375 rad/s², which is same as before, 6.0375.

So that confirms the calculation. But again, no matching option.

Hmm, perhaps the options use g=32 ft/s². Let me try that.

Using g=32.

I = (W R²) / (2g) = (600 *4) / (2*32)= 2400 /64=37.5.

Then α=225 /37.5=6.

So α=6 rad/s².

Still, 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 6
