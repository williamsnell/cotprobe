Okay, so I've got this question about noroviruses and what they typically cause. Hmm, noroviruses... I remember they're a type of virus, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

I think noroviruses are related to gastrointestinal issues. Oh right, they're a common cause of stomach bugs. I remember hearing that they cause something like food poisoning. So they probably lead to symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea.

Wait, the options are A through J. Let me look at the options again. Option E is projectile vomiting and diarrhea. That sounds familiar because I've heard that norovirus infections can cause pretty intense vomiting. Projectile vomiting, right.

Other options: Option H is just diarrhea. I think norovirus does cause that too, but maybe the key symptom is both vomiting and diarrhea together, especially the projectile kind. So E might be the better choice.

Other options don't seem to fit. Like A is high fever and cough, which sounds more like the flu. B is severe headache and muscle pain, also flu-like but maybe not norovirus. C is central nervous system disease, which makes me think of things like meningitis or encephalitis, not a stomach bug. D is loss of taste and smell; that's more COVID-19 related. F is a rash, like measles or chickenpox. G is rash and fever, similar. I is breathlessness and chest pain, maybe something like pneumonia. J is persistent hiccups and diarrhea, that's unusual, I don't think norovirus causes hiccups.

So putting it together, the typical symptoms of norovirus are vomiting and diarrhea, with the vomiting being projectile. So the correct answer should be E.

The noroviruses are known to primarily cause gastrointestinal symptoms, most notably projectile vomiting and diarrhea. Among the given options, E correctly identifies these typical symptoms. Other options describe symptoms more associated with different conditions, such as respiratory issues, rashes, or neurological effects, which are not characteristic of norovirus infections.

Answer: E
