Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this time zone question. Let me break it down step by step. 

The question is: When it's noon in New York during daylight-saving time, what time is it in Honolulu? The options are from A to J, each with different times. 

First, I need to remember the time zones for both cities. I know that New York is in the Eastern Time Zone (ET). During daylight-saving time, it's Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), which is UTC-4. 

Now, what about Honolulu? I think Hawaii is in the Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone. Since Hawaii doesn't observe daylight-saving time, they stay on standard time year-round. So that's Hawaii Standard Time (HST), which is UTC-10.

So the task is to convert noon EDT to HST. Let me think about the time difference. New York is EDT (UTC-4) and Honolulu is HST (UTC-10). The difference between them is 6 hours because from UTC-4 to UTC-0 is 4 hours, and then to UTC-10 is another 6 hours behind. Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate that again. 

If EDT is UTC-4, and HST is UTC-10, the time difference is 6 hours. Because from New York to Honolulu, you're moving west across the international date line. So when it's noon in New York (EDT), you subtract 6 hours to get the time in Honolulu.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. When it's noon in New York (EDT, UTC-4), what's the current time in UTC? Noon EDT is 16:00 UTC (because EDT is UTC-4, so 12:00 +4=16:00). 

Then, to get to HST which is UTC-10, I subtract 10 hours from UTC. So 16:00 UTC minus 10 hours is 6 AM. 

So that would make it 6 AM in Honolulu. Let me check the options. Option B is 6:00 AM. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, does daylight-saving time affect this calculation? Because New York is on EDT, but Honolulu isn't. So the time difference is 6 hours, yes. So yes, 12:00 EDT is 6 AM HST.

When it is noon in New York during daylight-saving time (Eastern Daylight Time, EDT, UTC-4), the time in Honolulu (Hawaii Standard Time, HST, UTC-10) is 6 hours earlier. This is because the time difference between EDT and HST is 6 hours. 

To calculate this:
1. Noon EDT is equivalent to 16:00 UTC (since EDT is UTC-4).
2. Subtracting 10 hours from 16:00 UTC gives 6:00 AM HST.

Thus, the time in Honolulu is **6:00 AM**.
