Alright, so I have this question about Tolstoy before his conversion. Let me think about what I know about Tolstoy's life. Tolstoy was a Russian novelist, right? He's famous for works like "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina." But the question is about his life before he converted, so I'm guessing this refers to his spiritual or philosophical conversion later in life.

I remember that Tolstoy was born into an aristocratic family. So his early life was probably quite privileged. He was part of the nobility, so he would have been surrounded by wealth and the privileges that come with it. But then, as he grew older, he started to question the meaning of life and the excesses of his lifestyle. This led to a period of deep introspection and eventually a conversion where he adopted more ascetic and spiritual beliefs.

So the question is asking what he was surrounded by before this conversion. The options include things like poverty, wealth, aristocratic pressures, etc. Since he was an aristocrat, the pressures of that society would make sense. But another option is an abundance of wealth and power, which also fits because being part of the aristocracy would mean he had access to a lot of resources and social status.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me look at the options again. Option D is "the pressures of aristocratic society," and F is "an abundance of wealth and power." Both seem plausible. But before his conversion, he was living a life of luxury, right? So he was surrounded by wealth and power. But the pressures might refer more to social expectations rather than the material surroundings.

Alternatively, option I is "a world of literature and art." Tolstoy was definitely surrounded by literature since he was a writer, but I'm not sure if that's the context here. The question is about what he was surrounded by before conversion, which was more about his lifestyle.

So I think the correct answer is either F or D. Let me think again. Before his conversion, he was in a state of luxury but felt unfulfilled. So he was surrounded by wealth. So F would be the answer. But wait, another perspective: the pressures of aristocratic society (D) might refer to the social expectations and the luxurious life that came with it, which could have contributed to his feelings of emptiness.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. But I think the abundance of wealth and power (F) is more directly about his surroundings, while D is more about the pressures or social aspects. Since the question is about what he was surrounded by, F seems more accurate because it's about the material environment.

The question asks about Tolstoy's surroundings before his conversion. Tolstoy was born into an aristocratic family, which meant he was surrounded by wealth and privilege. While "the pressures of aristocratic society" (D) and "an abundance of wealth and power" (F) are both plausible, the latter more directly describes his material environment. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: F
