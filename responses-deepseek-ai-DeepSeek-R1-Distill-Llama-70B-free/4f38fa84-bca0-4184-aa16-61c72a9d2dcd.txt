Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the molarity of a sodium hydroxide solution. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The problem says that 42.6 mL of 0.108 M HCl is used to neutralize 40.0 mL of the NaOH solution. I remember that neutralization reactions between acids and bases can be solved using the concept of equivalents, where the moles of acid equal the moles of base.

Wait, right, the reaction between HCl and NaOH is HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O. So each mole of HCl reacts with one mole of NaOH because they're both monoprotic. So the molar amounts should be equal.

Molarity is moles per liter, so I can calculate moles of HCl first. Moles = Molarity × Volume. But wait, the volume is in milliliters, so I should convert that to liters.

HCl volume is 42.6 mL, which is 0.0426 liters. Moles of HCl = 0.108 M * 0.0426 L. Let me calculate that. 0.108 times 0.0426... Let me do the math. 0.108 * 42.6 mL is ... Let's compute 0.108 * 42.6. 42.6 times 0.1 is 4.26, 42.6 times 0.008 is 0.3408. Adding them together, 4.26 + 0.3408 = 4.6008 millimoles? Wait, no, wait. Because 0.0426 liters is 42.6 mL. So 0.108 moles per liter times 0.0426 liters is moles.

Wait, 0.108 * 0.0426 = let's compute. 0.1 * 0.0426 is 0.00426, and 0.008 * 0.0426 is 0.0003408. Adding them together, 0.00426 + 0.0003408 is 0.0046008 moles of HCl.

Since the moles of HCl equals the moles of NaOH, the NaOH must also be 0.0046008 moles.

But wait, the volume of NaOH solution is 40.0 mL, which is 0.04 liters. So the molarity of NaOH is moles divided by volume in liters. That would be 0.0046008 moles / 0.04 L. Let me calculate that: 0.0046008 divided by 0.04.

0.0046008 / 0.04 is 0.11502 M. So approximately 0.115 M.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.115 M. So the answer should be I.

To determine the molarity of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, we use the fact that the moles of HCl equal the moles of NaOH in the neutralization reaction:

\[
\text{HCl} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

1. **Calculate the moles of HCl**:  
   The molarity of HCl is 0.108 M, and the volume is 42.6 mL (or 0.0426 L).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.108 \, \text{M} \times 0.0426 \, \text{L} = 0.0046008 \, \text{moles}
   \]

2. **Equating moles of HCl and NaOH**:  
   Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaOH are also 0.0046008 moles.

3. **Calculate the molarity of NaOH**:  
   The volume of the NaOH solution is 40.0 mL (or 0.04 L).  
   \[
   \text{Molarity of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Volume of NaOH in liters}} = \frac{0.0046008}{0.04} = 0.115 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Match the closest option**:  
   The closest option to 0.115 M is **I: 0.115 M**.
