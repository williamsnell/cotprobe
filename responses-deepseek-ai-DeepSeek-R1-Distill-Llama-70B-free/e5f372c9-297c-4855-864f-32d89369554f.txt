Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron moving at a certain speed, and I need to find its relativistic mass and kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant. So I need to use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

Alright, the problem states that the electron is moving at 50% the speed of light. Wait, but wait, the speed given is 1.5 × 10^8 m/s. Let me check: the speed of light is about 3 × 10^8 m/s, so half of that is 1.5e8 m/s. Oh, okay, so yes, it's moving at 0.5c. That makes sense.

Part (a) is the relativistic mass. Relativistic mass is given by the formula m = gamma * m0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate gamma first.

Let me compute v²/c². Since v is 0.5c, v squared is (0.5)^2 c², so 0.25 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. The square root of 0.75 is sqrt(3)/2, roughly 0.866. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.866, which is approximately 1.1547.

The rest mass of an electron, m0, is approximately 9.11 × 10^-31 kg. So the relativistic mass m = gamma * m0 = 1.1547 * 9.11e-31 kg. Let's compute that. 9.11e-31 times 1.1547 is about... let's see, 9e-31 * 1.15 is roughly 10.35e-31? Wait, wait, 9.11 * 1.1547. Let me compute that more accurately.

9.11 * 1.1547: 9 * 1.1547 is 10.3923, and 0.11 * 1.1547 is about 0.127. So total is approximately 10.3923 + 0.127 = 10.5193. So 10.5193e-31 kg, which can be written as 1.05193 × 10^-30 kg. Looking at the options, I see that some have 1.05 ×10^-30 kg. So that's for the mass part.

Wait, but wait. Option G has 1.05e-30 kg for mass, and others have different values. So part a's answer is around 1.05e-30 kg.

Now part (b), kinetic energy. I remember that the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m0 c². Alternatively, some formulas use the rest mass energy and then the total energy is gamma m0 c², so kinetic is gamma m0 c² minus m0 c², which is (gamma-1)m0 c².

Let me compute that. First, I know m0 c² for an electron is about 0.511 MeV, but I can calculate it in joules. c squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s². So m0 c² is 9.11e-31 kg * 9e16 m²/s². Let me compute that: 9.11e-31 * 9e16 = 81.99e-15 joules, which is approximately 8.2e-14 J. Wait, that's the rest energy.

Wait, wait, 9.11e-31 *9e16 = (9.11 *9) × 10^(-31+16) → 82.0 ×10^-15 → 8.2e-14 J. Oh right, so m0 c² is 8.2e-14 J.

Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) times that. Gamma is 1.1547, so gamma -1 is about 0.1547. So 0.1547 * 8.2e-14 J. Let's calculate that.

0.1547 * 8.2e-14 → 0.1547 *8.2 is approximately 1.268. So 1.268e-14 J. So about 1.27e-14 J.

Looking at the options, part (b) is kinetic energy, and the options for part (b) are:

Looking at option G: the mass is 1.05e-30 kg, and KE is 1.26e-14 J. That matches what I just calculated.

So the correct option would be G: 1.05 ×10^-30 kg, 1.26 ×10^-14 J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure.

Gamma calculation: v =0.5c → v²/c²=0.25 → 1 - 0.25=0.75 → sqrt(0.75)=0.8660... → gamma ≈1.1547. Correct.

Relativistic mass m = gamma * m0 = 1.1547 *9.11e-31 kg.

Let me compute 9.11 *1.1547:

9.11 *1 is 9.11, 9.11 *0.15 is approximately 1.3665, 9.11 *0.0047 is about 0.0429. So 9.11 +1.3665=10.4765 +0.0429=10.5194. So 10.5194e-31 kg is 1.05194e-30 kg. So 1.05e-30 kg. So yes, that's correct.

Kinetic energy: (gamma-1)*m0c². Gamma is 1.1547, so gamma-1 is 0.1547. m0 c² is 8.2e-14 J. So 0.1547 *8.2e-14 = let me compute 0.1547 *8.2.

0.1547 *8 =1.2376, 0.1547 *0.2=0.03094. Sum is 1.2376+0.03094=1.26854. So approximately 1.2685e-14 J, which is 1.27e-14 J, but the option says 1.26e-14. Hmm, perhaps due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let's calculate 0.1547 *8.2.

0.1547 * 8 =1.2376, 0.1547 *0.2=0.03094. Sum is 1.2376 +0.03094 =1.26854. So 1.26854e-14 J ≈1.27e-14 J. But the option G says 1.26e-14 J. Hmm, that's a slight discrepancy. Maybe because I approximated gamma as 1.1547, but perhaps a more precise gamma would change things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me calculate gamma more precisely.

v=0.5c, so beta = v/c = 0.5. So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). What's the exact value of sqrt(0.75)?

sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254. So the reciprocal is 1.1547005. So gamma is approximately 1.1547005.

So gamma-1 is 0.1547005.

Now, m0 c² = (9.10938356e-31 kg) * (2.99792458e8 m/s)^2.

Let me compute that more accurately.

c^2 = (2.99792458e8)^2 = approx 8.987551787e16 m²/s².

m0 c² = 9.10938356e-31 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s².

Multiplying 9.10938356e-31 by 8.987551787e16:

Multiply 9.10938356 by 8.987551787.

9 * 8.98755 ≈80.888, 0.10938 *8.9875 ≈0.982. So total approximately 81.87 → 81.87e-15 → 8.187e-14 J.

So m0 c² is approximately 8.187e-14 J.

Then KE = (gamma -1) * m0 c² = 0.1547005 *8.187e-14.

Calculating 0.1547005 * 8.187e-14:

0.1547005 *8 =1.237604e-14,

0.1547005 *0.187= let's compute 0.1547 *0.187.

0.1547 * 0.1 is 0.01547,

0.1547 *0.08 = 0.012376,

0.1547 *0.007=0.0010829.

Adding these: 0.01547 +0.012376 =0.027846, +0.0010829=0.0289289.

So 0.1547 *0.187 ≈0.0289289.

So 0.1547005 *8.187 =1.237604e-14 (from the 8) plus 0.0289289e-14 (from the 0.187) → 1.237604e-14 +0.0289289e-14 =1.266533e-14 J.

So KE ≈1.2665e-14 J, which is approximately 1.2665 ×10^-14 J, so 1.27e-14 when rounded to three significant figures, but the option G says 1.26e-14. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. But perhaps the given options use more precise calculations or round differently. Alternatively, perhaps in the question the speed is 1.5e8 m/s, which is exactly 0.5c, so maybe that's precise.

Wait, let me double-check the problem statement. Yes, the speed is given as 1.5 ×10^8 m/s, which is exactly half the speed of light (since c is 3e8 m/s). So v=0.5c exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/sqrt(3)/2, which is (2/sqrt(3)) ) → which is approximately 1.154700538.

So recalculating, perhaps the exact calculation leads to 1.26e-14 J.

Wait, in my more precise calculation, I got 1.2665e-14 J, which would round to 1.27e-14 J. But option G has 1.26e-14. So maybe the approximation in the option is using fewer significant figures.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it using exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the kinetic energy formula. Oh wait! Another formula for kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m0 c². So that's correct.

Wait, let's compute (gamma -1) more precisely: 0.154700538.

Then, m0 c² is 8.187105776e-14 J (using m0=9.1093837015e-31 kg and c=299792458 m/s exactly).

So 0.154700538 ×8.187105776e-14 = ?

Let me compute 0.154700538 *8.187105776.

Hmm, perhaps in steps:

0.154700538 *8 =1.237604304,

0.154700538 *0.187105776.

Wait, 0.187105776 is approximately 0.1871.

Compute 0.154700538 *0.1871:

= (0.15 *0.1871) + (0.004700538 *0.1871)

0.15 *0.1871 = 0.028065.

0.004700538 *0.1871≈ 0.0047005 *0.1871≈ 0.000878.

So total ≈0.028065 +0.000878 =0.028943.

So total (gamma-1)*m0c² = 1.237604304e-14 + 0.028943e-14 = 1.266547e-14 J.

Which is approximately 1.2665e-14 J, so 1.267e-14 J. So when rounded to three significant figures, it's 1.27e-14 J.

But in the options, the closest is option G: 1.26e-14 J. Hmm. So perhaps the options rounded down.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 1.26 when considering more digits.

Wait, perhaps the given options have approximated some steps. Or perhaps I should think about the initial rest mass.

Wait, maybe the electron's rest mass is taken as 9.1e-31 kg, which is an approximation. The exact value is about 9.109e-31 kg. So perhaps using 9.1e-31 kg, let's recalculate.

m0 =9.1e-31 kg.

m0 c² =9.1e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 =9.1e-31 *9e16= 8.19e-14 J.

Then (gamma-1)=0.1547, so 0.1547*8.19e-14.

0.1547 *8e-14=1.2376e-14, 0.1547*0.19e-14=0.029393e-14. So total 1.2376e-14 +0.029393e-14 =1.26699e-14 J. Which is about 1.267e-14 J, so 1.27e-14 J.

Hmm, but the option G gives 1.26e-14 J. So perhaps the question expects us to use a certain approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.

Wait another approach: gamma for v=0.5c.

Gamma=1/(sqrt(1-0.25))=1/sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(4/3)=approximately 1.154700538.

Kinetic energy= (1.1547 -1) * m0 c².

Which is 0.1547 * m0 c².

If m0 c² is 8.2e-14 J, then 0.1547 *8.2e-14 =?

0.1547 *8=1.2376e-14.

0.1547 *0.2=0.03094e-14.

So total 1.2376e-14 +0.03094e-14=1.26854e-14, which is 1.2685e-14 J.

So when rounded to three significant figures, it's 1.27e-14 J.

Wait, but the option G says 1.26e-14 J. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me use exact values for gamma and m0.

m0 =9.1093837015e-31 kg.

c=299792458 m/s.

m0 c squared =9.1093837015e-31 * (299792458)^2.

Compute that:

(299792458)^2= approx 8.987551787e16.

So 9.1093837015e-31 *8.987551787e16 = let's compute 9.1093837015 *8.987551787 = approximately 81.871e-15.

So 81.871e-15 J is 8.1871e-14 J.

gamma =1.154700538.

gamma -1=0.154700538.

So KE=0.154700538 *8.1871e-14.

Compute 0.154700538 *8.1871:

= (0.1 *8.1871) + (0.05 *8.1871) + (0.004700538 *8.1871)

0.1 *8.1871=0.81871.

0.05 *8.1871=0.409355.

0.004700538 *8.1871≈0.03848.

Adding them together: 0.81871 +0.409355=1.228065 +0.03848≈1.266545.

So KE=1.266545e-14 J, which is approximately 1.2665e-14 J. That's about 1.2665e-14 J, which would be 1.27e-14 J when rounded to three significant figures. But the option G is 1.26e-14 J. Hmm, perhaps the options are using two decimal places, but in terms of significant figures, 1.26e-14 J has three significant figures, same as 1.27e-14.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial formula for relativistic mass. Oh, wait, is the relativistic mass the same as gamma m0? Yes, because relativistic mass is m=gamma m0. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is using the total energy as gamma m0 c², and the kinetic energy as (gamma -1) m0 c². Which is what I did.

So according to my calculations, the kinetic energy should be approximately 1.2665e-14 J, which is closer to 1.27e-14 J. But the option G is 1.26e-14 J, which is 1.26 when rounded to three significant figures.

Wait, maybe the options have a typo, but according to the closest option, G is the correct one.

Looking back at the options:

Option G: 1.05 ×10^-30 kg, 1.26 ×10^-14 J.

That's the one that has the correct relativistic mass and the closest KE.

So I think the correct answer is option G.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the relativistic mass and kinetic energy of an electron moving at 50% of the speed of light (\(v = 0.5c\)).

### Part (a): Relativistic Mass
The relativistic mass is given by the formula:

\[
m = \gamma m_0
\]

where \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, defined
