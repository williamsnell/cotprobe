Question:

A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?

Options:

A: Frequent turning
B: Use of wet to dry dressings
C: Whirlpool therapy
D: Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this medical question, and I need to think through it carefully. Let me start by reading the question again.

The patient is a 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic due to multiple sclerosis. He's hospitalized with left lower lobe pneumonia. His vital signs are a bit elevated—temperature 38.1°C, pulse 95, respirations 12, BP 120/80. He looks malnourished. On exam, there are rhonchi in the left lower lung, which makes sense with pneumonia. Other systems seem normal except for a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum. The skin is intact, no induration, and stool occult blood is negative.

The question is about the most effective intervention for his skin lesion. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the best one.

Hmm, so the skin lesion is erythema over the sacrum. Sacrum is a common area for pressure sores, especially in quadriplegic patients who can't move much. Pressure sores, also known as pressure ulcers, typically start with erythema. Since the skin is intact, this would be a stage I pressure ulcer.

In the early stages, the management focuses on preventing progression. So what's the best intervention? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Frequent turning. That makes sense because it relieves pressure on areas prone to sores. Turning the patient regularly, like every 2 hours, is a standard recommendation to prevent pressure ulcers from developing or worsening.

Option B: Use of wet to dry dressings. Wait, wet to dry dressings are usually for wounds that have open areas, to promote debridement. But in this case, the skin is intact. So maybe this isn't necessary yet.

Option C: Whirlpool therapy. That's more for cleaning wounds, perhaps in later stages when there's necrosis or infection. Since the skin is intact, whirlpool might not be needed here.

Option D: Broad-spectrum antibiotics. The erythema might be due to pressure, not infection. There's no mention of signs of infection like pus, increased redness, warmth, or swelling beyond the erythema. Plus, antibiotics are for bacterial infections, not pressure sores unless they become infected.

So putting it together, the best intervention is to prevent the pressure sore from progressing. Frequent turning would take pressure off the sacrum, allowing the area to heal and preventing it from becoming a deeper ulcer.

Wait, but he's quadriplegic and probably immobile, so regular repositioning is crucial. Also, he's malnourished, which can affect wound healing, but that's another issue.

So the answer should be A: Frequent turning.

The patient is a 65-year-old quadriplegic man with a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum, indicative of a stage I pressure ulcer. The most effective intervention is to prevent progression by relieving pressure. Frequent turning is the standard recommendation for early-stage pressure ulcers to avoid further tissue damage. Other options are not appropriate at this stage: wet to dry dressings and whirlpool therapy are for open wounds, and antibiotics are unnecessary without signs of infection.

Answer: A
