Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus. Hmm, binding energy... I remember that it's the energy required to split a nucleus into its individual protons and neutrons, right? Or maybe the energy released when the nucleus forms from them. Either way, I think it's calculated using the mass defect.

The problem gives me the atomic mass of the 4He atom as 4.002603 u. I need to find the binding energy in MeV. The options are from A to J, so I need to choose the correct letter after working it out.

Wait, I should probably start by recalling the formula for binding energy. I think it's E = Δm * c², where Δm is the mass defect. That makes sense because mass defect is the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the sum of the masses of its components.

But wait, the given mass is for the atom, not the nucleus. Oh right, because when you have an atom, it includes the electrons. So I need to account for that. The helium atom has two electrons, right? So to get the mass of the nucleus, I should subtract the mass of those electrons.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compare the mass of the nucleus to the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons. Because the binding energy is about the nucleus, not the whole atom.

So let's think: a helium-4 nucleus consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the total mass of these free particles should be 2*(mass of proton) + 2*(mass of neutron). Then, the mass of the nucleus is less than that sum because of the mass defect.

But the given mass is the atomic mass. So maybe I need to convert that to the nuclear mass first. Because the atomic mass includes electrons.

So the atomic mass of 4He is 4.002603 u. The atomic number is 2, so there are 2 electrons in the neutral atom. So the mass of the electrons is 2 * (mass of an electron). Mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u each, I think. So 2 times that is 0.00109716 u.

So the nuclear mass would be atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Wait wait, no, wait. Because the atomic mass already includes the electrons. Wait, no, wait. The mass of a neutral atom includes the nucleus plus the electrons. So if I want the nucleus's mass, I subtract the electrons' mass.

So, nuclear mass = atomic mass - (number of electrons) * (electron mass). For helium, Z=2, so 2 electrons.

So nuclear mass = 4.002603 u - 2*(0.00054858 u) = let's calculate that.

2 * 0.00054858 is 0.00109716. So subtracting from 4.002603 gives 4.002603 - 0.00109716 = 4.00150584 u.

Wait, but wait another thought. I'm a bit confused because sometimes atomic mass is considered as the mass of the atom including electrons, and the nuclear mass is the mass of the nucleus alone. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the sum of the individual nucleons' masses. So for 4He nucleus, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

Mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and neutron is about 1.008665 u. Let me get the exact values from memory. Wait, I think the proton is about 1.007276 u, and neutron is 1.0086649 u.

So total mass of individual nucleons is 2*(proton mass) + 2*(neutron mass).

Calculating that: 2*(1.007276) + 2*(1.0086649) = 2*(1.007276 + 1.0086649) = 2*(2.0159409) = 4.0318818 u.

Wait, wait a second. So the sum is 4.0318818 u, and the nuclear mass is 4.00150584 u. So the mass defect Δm is sum - nuclear mass.

So Δm = 4.0318818 u - 4.00150584 u = 0.03037596 u.

Wait, that's the mass defect. Now, I need to convert this mass into energy using E=mc². But wait, I should remember the units. The mass is in u (atomic mass units), and 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². Oh right, so 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² approximately.

So E = Δm * 931.494 MeV/u.

So E = 0.03037596 u * 931.494 MeV/u ≈ let's calculate that.

0.030376 * 931.494. Hmm.

Well, 0.03 * 931.494 is about 27.9448. Then 0.000376 * 931.494 is approximately 0.3505. So adding together, 27.9448 + 0.3505 = 28.2953 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 28.3 as the first option. Let me check the options again. Oh, option H is 28.3 MeV. So that's looking promising.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Let me recalculate the mass of the nucleus.

Atomic mass of He is 4.002603 u.

Each electron is 0.00054858 u. So 2 electrons: 2 * 0.00054858 = 0.00109716 u.

So nuclear mass = 4.002603 - 0.00109716 = 4.00152584 u.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 4.00150584, but perhaps I miscalculated. Let me do the subtraction carefully:

4.002603
-0.00109716
= ?

Subtracting step by step:

4.002603
-0.00100000 = 4.001603
Then subtract 0.00009716:

4.001603 - 0.00009716 = 4.00150584 u.

Wait, so the nuclear mass is 4.00150584 u.

Sum of the nucleons: 2*(1.007276 + 1.0086649) = 2*(2.0159409) = 4.0318818 u.

So Δm = 4.0318818 - 4.00150584 = 0.03037596 u.

Multiply by 931.494 MeV/u:

0.03037596 * 931.494 ≈ ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.03037596 * 931.494.

Let's break it down:

0.03 * 931.494 = 27.94482.

0.00037596 * 931.494.

Compute 0.0003 * 931.494 = 0.2794482.

0.00007596 * 931.494 ≈ 0.07073 (approx 0.00007 * 931 is ~65.17e-3 → 0.06517, plus 0.00000596 * 931 ≈ ~5.55e-3 → 0.00555. So total ≈ 0.06517 + 0.00555 = 0.07072.)

So total for 0.00037596 is 0.2794482 + 0.07072 ≈ 0.350168.

Adding to the 27.94482 gives 27.94482 + 0.350168 ≈ 28.29498 MeV.

So approximately 28.295 MeV.

Looking at the options, option H is 28.3 MeV. So that's the answer.

Wait, but I thought sometimes the binding energy is given per nucleon. Oh, no, wait, no, the question just asks for the binding energy of the nucleus, which is the total, not per nucleon.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the mass of the electron. Maybe I used the wrong value. The electron mass is 0.0005485799 u, right? So 2 electrons would be 0.00109716 u. That part seems correct.

And the proton mass is 1.007276 u, neutron is 1.0086649 u. So 2*(1.007276 + 1.0086649) = 2*(2.0159409) = 4.0318818 u. That seems right.

Nuclear mass is 4.00150584 u. Mass defect 0.03037596 u. Multiply by 931.494 gives about 28.295 MeV.

So the correct answer should be H: 28.3.

To calculate the binding energy of the 4He nucleus, we start by determining the mass defect, which is the difference between the total mass of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the actual mass of the nucleus. The given atomic mass of 4He is 4.002603 u, which includes the mass of the nucleus and the two electrons in the neutral atom. To find the nuclear mass, we subtract the mass of the two electrons:

\[
\text{Mass of 2 electrons} = 2 \times 0.00054858 \, \text{u} = 0.00109716 \, \text{u}.
\]

\[
\text{Nuclear mass} = 4.002603 \, \text{u} - 0.00109716 \, \text{u} = 4.00150584 \, \text{u}.
\]

Next, we calculate the total mass of the free nucleons. The 4He nucleus consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons:

\[
\text{Mass of 2 protons} = 2 \times 1.007276 \, \text{u} = 2.014552 \, \text{u},
\]
\[
\text{Mass of 2 neutrons} = 2 \times 1.008665 \, \text{u} = 2.01733 \, \text{u}.
\]

\[
\text{Total mass of nucleons} = 2.014552 \, \text{u} + 2.01733 \, \text{u} = 4.031882 \, \text{u}.
\]

The mass defect is then:

\[
\Delta m = \text{Total mass of nucleons} - \text{Nuclear mass} = 4.031882 \, \text{u} - 4.00150584 \, \text{u} = 0.03037616 \, \text{u}.
\]

To convert the mass defect into energy, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):

\[
E = \Delta m \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 0.03037616 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u}.
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
0.03 \times 931.494 = 27.94482 \, \text{MeV},
\]
\[
0.00037616 \times 931.494 \approx 0.35017 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

\[
E = 27.94482 \, \text{MeV} + 0.35017 \, \text{MeV} \approx 28.295 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the binding energy of the 4He nucleus is approximately **28.3 MeV**, which corresponds to option **H**.
