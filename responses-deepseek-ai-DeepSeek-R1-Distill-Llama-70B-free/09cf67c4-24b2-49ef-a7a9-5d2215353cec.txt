Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about research designs, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking which design a researcher should use to examine both age and cohort differences. The options are A through J.

First, I need to understand what the question is really about. It's about research designs, specifically which one allows the study of both age differences and cohort effects. I remember that in psychology, especially developmental psychology, researchers often look at how people change over time and the effects of being in a particular cohort (people born around the same time).

I think the key terms here are age differences and cohort differences. Age differences probably refer to changes as people get older, while cohort differences are about the groups of people born in the same period. So the researcher wants a design that can capture both of these aspects.

I recall there are a few main research designs. Let me try to list them and what they do:

1. **Cross-sectional design**: This involves studying people of different ages at the same point in time. It's good for looking at age differences because you compare different age groups. But it doesn't track individuals over time, so it might not capture cohort effects accurately because each age group is a different cohort.

2. **Longitudinal design**: This follows the same group of people over time, measuring them at different ages. It's great for seeing developmental changes and understanding age effects. However, since it's the same cohort, it might not account for differences between different cohorts. So if you only do a longitudinal study, you might miss out on cohort differences unless you compare multiple cohorts.

3. **Cross-sequential design**: This sounds a bit more complex. I think it's also called a cohort-sequential design. From what I remember, this design combines elements of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The researcher might study multiple cohorts over time. For example, they might take several groups of people of different ages at the start and then follow each group over time. This way, they can look at changes within each cohort (longitudinal aspect) and also compare different cohorts (cross-sectional aspect). So this design allows the researcher to examine both age differences (by comparing different ages) and cohort differences (by comparing different cohorts over time).

4. **Other options**: I don't think the other designs fit as well. Ethnographic is more about in-depth observation in a natural setting. Quasi-experimental involves some manipulation but without random assignment. Phenomenological is about subjective experiences. Correlational looks for relationships but doesn't establish causation. Pre-experimental and experimental are more about testing cause and effect. Case study is in-depth analysis of a single case or a few cases.
  
So the question is about looking at both age and cohort differences. The cross-sectional design alone can't do that because it only looks at one time point across different ages. The longitudinal design alone looks at one cohort over time, so it misses cohort differences. The cross-sequential design allows for multiple cohorts and tracks them over time, so it can address both aspects.

Wait, what's the cross-sequential design called again? I think it's sometimes referred to as a cohort-sequential or time-lag design. It's when you have multiple cohorts that you study over time, which allows you to separate age effects from cohort effects and also time effects (like period effects, which affect everyone at a certain time).

So the correct answer should be B: Cross-sequential.

The correct answer is **B: Cross-sequential**. This design allows the researcher to examine both age differences and cohort effects by studying multiple groups (cohorts) over time, combining elements of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches.

B
