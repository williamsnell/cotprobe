Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer n where 1/n is a terminating decimal and n contains the digit 9. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a fraction 1/n will be a terminating decimal if and only if the prime factors of n consist solely of 2s and/or 5s. So n has to be of the form 2^a * 5^b, where a and b are non-negative integers (they can be zero, but at least one of them should be positive because n has to be at least 1).

Now, the second condition is that n must contain the digit 9. So I need to look through the options provided and find the smallest n that fits both criteria.

Looking at the options, all of them are powers of 2 except for D (72) and maybe others. Wait, let me check each option:

Option A: 512. That's 2^9. So it's a power of 2, so 1/512 would be a terminating decimal. Now, does 512 contain a 9? Yes, the last digit is 2, but wait, 512 is 5-1-2, so no 9 there. So it doesn't contain 9. Wait, wait, 512 is 5,1,2. No 9. So A doesn't qualify.

Option B: 1024. That's 2^10. Terminating decimal. Does 1024 contain a 9? Let's see: digits are 1,0,2,4. No 9. So B is out.

Option C: 128. 2^7. Terminating decimal. Digits are 1,2,8. No 9.

Option D:72. Hmm, 72 factors into 8*9, which is 2^3 * 3^2. Oh wait, but 3 is a prime factor other than 2 or 5. So 1/72 would not be a terminating decimal. So D doesn't meet the first condition.

Option E:32. 2^5. So 1/32 is terminating decimal. The number is 3 and 2. No 9. So E is out.

Option F:256. 2^8. No 9 in the digits. So F is out.

Option G:2048. 2^11. Digits are 2,0,4,8. No 9. So G is out.

Option H:64. 2^6. No 9 in digits. So H is out.

Option I:8192. 2^13. Digits are 8,1,9,2. Oh, wait, there's a 9 here. So 8192 contains a 9. So I is a candidate.

Option J:4096. 2^12. Digits are 4,0,9,6. Oh, here's a 9 as well. So J is another candidate.

Now, between I (8192) and J (4096), which is smaller? 4096 is smaller than 8192. So J would be a candidate. But wait, wait—am I missing any options between J and the others?

Wait, let me check all options again to make sure I didn't miss any. Let's see the options in order: A:512, B:1024, C:128, D:72, E:32, F:256, G:2048, H:64, I:8192, J:4096.

Wait, J is 4096, which is 2^12. Its digits are 4,0,9,6. So yes, contains a 9. And 1/4096 is a terminating decimal because it's a power of 2.

But wait, is there a smaller n than 4096 that meets both conditions? Because 4096 is 2^12, but are there any smaller n's with a 9 in their digits and being a product of only 2s and 5s?

Looking back: the only numbers in the options that have a 9 are I (8192) and J (4096). Between them, J is smaller. But wait, perhaps there's a number not in the options that is smaller, but the question is about selecting from the given options.

Wait, but in the options, the numbers with a 9 are I and J. So J is 4096, which is smaller than I (8192). So J would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure that all the other options either don't have a 9 or aren't of the form 2^a*5^b. 

Wait, is 72 (option D) a candidate? 72=8*9=2^3 *3^2. So it's not of the form 2^a*5^b, because of the 3^2. So 1/72 won't terminate. So D is out.

Are there any other options that have a 9? Let me check each option again.

Looking back:

A:512 → no 9
B:1024 → no 9
C:128 → no
D:72 → no
E:32 → no
F:256 → no
G:2048 → no
H:64 → no
I:8192 → yes, has 9
J:4096 → yes, has 9

So the only candidates are I and J. Between them, J is the smaller number.

So the answer should be J:4096.

To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{n} \) is a terminating decimal and \( n \) contains the digit 9, we analyze the given options:

1. **Terminating Decimal Condition**: A fraction \( \frac{1}{n} \) is a terminating decimal if and only if \( n \) is of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are non-negative integers.

2. **Digit 9 Condition**: \( n \) must contain the digit 9.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A: 512**  
  \( 512 = 2^9 \). While \( \frac{1}{512} \) is a terminating decimal, 512 does not contain the digit 9.  
  **Not valid.**

- **B: 1024**  
  \( 1024 = 2^{10} \). While \( \frac{1}{1024} \) is a terminating decimal, 1024 does not contain the digit 9.  
  **Not valid.**

- **C: 128**  
  \( 128 = 2^7 \). While \( \frac{1}{128} \) is a terminating decimal, 128 does not contain the digit 9.  
  **Not valid.**

- **D: 72**  
  \( 72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \). Since 72 has a prime factor (3) other than 2 or 5, \( \frac{1}{72} \) is not a terminating decimal.  
  **Not valid.**

- **E: 32**  
  \( 32 = 2^5 \). While \( \frac{1}{32} \) is a terminating decimal, 32 does not contain the digit 9.  
  **Not valid.**

- **F: 256**  
  \( 256 = 2^8 \). While \( \frac{1}{256} \) is a terminating decimal, 256 does not contain the digit 9.  
  **Not valid.**

- **G: 2048**  
  \( 2048 = 2^{11} \). While \( \frac{1}{2048} \) is a terminating decimal, 2048 does not contain the digit 9.  
  **Not valid.**

- **H: 64**  
  \( 64 = 2^6 \). While \( \frac{1}{64} \) is a terminating decimal, 64 does not contain the digit 9.  
  **Not valid.**

- **I: 8192**  
  \( 8192 = 2^{13} \). While \( \frac{1}{8192} \) is a terminating decimal, 8192 is not the smallest such number.  
  **Valid but not the smallest.**

- **J: 4096**  
  \( 4096 = 2^{12} \). \( \frac{1}{4096} \) is a terminating decimal, and 4096 contains the digit 9. Additionally, 4096 is smaller than 8192.  
  **Valid and the smallest.**

### Conclusion:
The smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is **4096**. 

**Answer: J**
