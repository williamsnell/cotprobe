Okay, so I've got this problem here about transportation costs and mileage. Hmm, let me read it again. It says that transporting one pound 100 miles costs $5.00, and 700 miles costs $28.50. We're supposed to find the linear relationship between cost and mileage, and then determine the cost for 200 and 400 miles. The options are multiple choice, so I need to calculate and pick the right one.

Alright, since it's a linear relationship, the cost function should be something like C(m) = k * m + b, where m is the miles. Wait, but maybe it's C = a*m + C0, where a is the cost per mile and C0 is the fixed cost. But wait, actually, since the problem gives two points, perhaps it's better to model it as a straight line with slope and intercept.

So the two points given are (100, 5) and (700, 28.50). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, wait. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the first point is 100 miles costing $5. The second is 700 miles costing $28.50. So the two points are (100,5) and (700,28.50). 

To find the linear equation, I need to find the slope first. The slope (a) is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So that's (28.50 -5) divided by (700 -100). Let me compute that. 28.50 minus 5 is 23.50. 700 minus 100 is 600. So 23.50 / 600 equals... Let's see. 23.5 divided by 600. Hmm, 23.5 is the same as 47/2. So 47/2 divided by 600 is 47/(2*600) = 47/1200. Let me compute 47 divided by 1200. 1200 goes into 47 zero times. Let's see, 47/1200 is 0.0391666... So approximately 0.0391666 dollars per mile.

Alternatively, maybe I can express it as a fraction. 23.5/600. Let me see, 23.5 is 47/2, so (47/2)/600 = 47/(2*600) = 47/1200. So 47/1200 dollars per mile is the slope.

Now, using one of the points to find the y-intercept. Let's take the first point (100,5). So plugging into C = a*m + b. 5 = (47/1200)*100 + b. Let's compute (47/1200)*100. 100 is 1/12 of 1200, so 47 * (100/1200) = 47 * (1/12) ≈ 3.9167. So 5 = 3.9167 + b. So b is 5 - 3.9167, which is approximately 1.0833 dollars.

So the equation is C(m) = (47/1200)*m + 1.0833. Alternatively, I can write it as C(m) = (47m)/1200 + 1.0833.

Wait, but maybe I should check with the second point to make sure. Let's plug m=700 into the equation. So (47 *700)/1200 + 1.0833. 47*700 is 32,900. 32,900 /1200 is approximately 27.4167. Adding 1.0833 gives us 28.5, which matches the second point. So the equation looks correct.

Now, the question is to find the cost for 200 miles and 400 miles. Let's compute each.

First, 200 miles. Plugging m=200 into the equation:

C(200) = (47 *200)/1200 + 1.0833. Let's compute 47 *200 = 9400. 9400/1200 is approximately 7.8333. Adding 1.0833 gives 7.8333 +1.0833 = 8.9166 dollars, approximately $8.92.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 47*200=9400. 9400 divided by 1200 is 7.833333... So 7.8333 + 1.0833 = 8.9166, which is about $8.92 when rounded to the nearest cent. But looking at the options, maybe it's presented with two decimal places.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

47 * 200 = 9400.

9400 /1200 = let's compute this: 1200 *7 = 8400. 9400 -8400=1000.

So 7 + (1000/1200) = 7 + 5/6 ≈ 7.833333.

Adding 1.083333 gives 8.916666..., which is approximately $8.9167, or $8.92 when rounded.

But let's see the options. Option A is $8.90 and $16.70. Option J is $8.50 and $17.00. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait another thought: maybe the fixed cost isn't actually 1.0833. Let me see, perhaps the fixed cost is zero. Because sometimes transportation might have a cost that's only per mile, without a fixed cost. Let me think: if at zero miles, the cost is zero, then the equation would be C(m) = a*m, where a is the cost per mile.

Wait, let's check that. If that's the case, then the slope would be (28.5 -5)/(700-100) = 23.5/600 ≈0.03916667, as before. Then, using point (100,5), 5 = a *100. So a =5/100=0.05. But then 0.05 *700 =35, which is higher than 28.50, so that can't be right. So no, the fixed cost model is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as C(m) = a*m + b, and find the exact values precisely without rounding to avoid confusion.

Let me recompute the slope exactly.

Slope a = (28.50 -5)/(700-100) = 23.5 /600 = 47/1200. So that's exactly 47/1200.

Now, using point (100,5):

5 = (47/1200)*100 + b.

Compute (47/1200)*100: 47 *100 =4700; 4700 /1200 = 470/12 = 235/6 ≈39.1666667? Wait, wait, no: 47 *100 is 4700, divided by 1200 is 4700/1200 = (4700 ÷100)/(1200 ÷100)=47/12 ≈3.9166667.

So 5 = 47/12 + b. So b =5 -47/12.

Convert 5 to twelfths: 5=60/12.

So 60/12 -47/12 =13/12 ≈1.0833333.

So the equation is exactly C(m)= (47/1200)m +13/12.

Now, compute for m=200:

C(200)= (47/1200)*200 +13/12.

47*200=9400; 9400/1200= 9400 ÷1200= 7.8333333...

13/12 is approximately 1.0833333.

So 7.8333333 +1.0833333=8.9166666... So exactly 8.916666... dollars, which is $8.916666..., which is approximately $8.92.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A: $8.90 and $16.70. Or option J: $8.50 and $17.00.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 47/1200 *200.

47 *200=9400. 9400 divided by 1200: 1200*7=8400, 9400-8400=1000. 1000/1200=5/6≈0.833333.

So 7.833333...

Adding 13/12, which is 1.083333...

So 7.833333 +1.083333=8.916666..., which is $8.916666... So that's $8.92 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 8.90 and 16.70, which is $8.90 for 200 miles. But my calculation is $8.92. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me try another approach. Maybe the fixed cost is per shipment, not per mile. But the problem says it's one pound, so maybe the fixed cost is zero. Wait, but in that case, the cost at 100 miles would be 5= a *100, so a=0.05. Then at 700 miles, a*700=35, but the given cost is 28.50, which doesn't match. So fixed cost can't be zero. So the initial approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 200 and 400 miles precisely.

Compute for 200 miles:

C(200)= (47/1200)*200 +13/12.

Compute each term:

47/1200 *200 = (47 *200)/1200 = 9400/1200 = 7.833333...

13/12 is 1.083333...

So sum is 8.916666... which is approximately $8.92.

For 400 miles:

C(400)= (47/1200)*400 +13/12.

47 *400= 18,800. 18,800 /1200 = 15.666666...

13/12 is 1.083333...

So sum is 15.666666... +1.083333... =16.75 dollars.

So 200 miles is ~$8.92, 400 miles is $16.75.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 8.90 and 16.70.

Option C: 9.90 and 19.80.

Option J:8.50 and 17.00.

Wait, none of the options exactly match $8.92 and $16.75. Hmm, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, maybe I should express the equation differently. Let me try using the two-point formula again.

Points (100,5) and (700,28.5). The slope is (28.5-5)/(700-100)=23.5/600=0.039166666.

So equation is C = 0.039166666*m + b.

Using the point (100,5):

5=0.039166666*100 +b → 5=3.9166666 +b → b=1.0833333.

So the equation is C=0.039166666m +1.0833333.

Now compute for 200 miles:

0.039166666 *200=7.8333333. Adding 1.0833333 gives 8.9166666, which is $8.92.

For 400 miles: 0.039166666 *400=15.6666666. Adding 1.0833333 gives 16.75.

Looking at the options, maybe the closest is option A: $8.90 and $16.70. But that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the fixed cost is zero, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should see if any of the options match when using a different approach. Let me try to compute without the fixed cost, even though it doesn't fit.

If C= a*m, then for m=100, C=5 → a=0.05.

So for m=200, C=0.05*200=10.00.

For m=400, 0.05*400=20.00. Which is option B: $10.00 and $20.00.

But wait, this model would predict 700 miles as 0.05*700=35, but the given value is 28.50, which is less. So that's not possible. So the fixed cost approach is correct, and the answer should be around $8.92 and $16.75.

Looking at the options, none of the options match exactly. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 8.90 and 16.70.

Option J:8.50 and 17.00.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Let me recompute 200 miles precisely.

C(200) = (47/1200)*200 +13/12.

47*200=9400.

9400/1200 = 7.833333...

13/12=1.083333...

Sum: 8.916666... which is 8.916666... So to two decimal places, that's $8.92. But option A is 8.90, which is 8.90.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different rounding method, or perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the cost is calculated as (cost per mile)*miles without a fixed cost. Let me recalculate without the fixed cost.

If that's not possible, as the previous reason, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps the fixed cost is per mile. Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is only based on mileage, without a fixed cost. Let me try that.

So if the cost is only per mile, then for 100 miles it's $5. So per mile is 5/100=0.05 dollars. Then 700 miles would cost 0.05*700=35, but the problem says it's 28.50. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the fixed cost approach is correct, and the initial calculation of $8.92 and $16.75 is accurate.

But since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the cost is not per mile but per 100 miles. Let me see: The first data point is 100 miles for $5. So perhaps it's $5 per 100 miles. Then for 700 miles, how much would that be? 700 /100 =7 units. So 7 *5=35. But the given cost is 28.50, which is lower. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the cost includes a base rate plus per mile. So for example, a fixed cost plus a variable cost per mile.

Wait, that's what I did before. So the equation is C = a*m + b.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula C = m/100 *5 + (m-100)/100 * something. No, that might complicate.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation using fractions more precisely.

The slope is 23.5/600 =47/1200.

So the equation is C = (47/1200)m + b.

Using m=100, C=5.

So 5= (47/1200)*100 + b → 5=47*100/1200 +b → 5=4700/1200 +b.

4700/1200 = 47/12 ≈3.9166667.

So 5=47/12 +b → b=5-47/12= (60/12 -47/12)=13/12 ≈1.0833333.

So C=(47/1200)m +13/12.

Now, for m=200:

C = (47/1200)*200 +13/12.

47*200=9400 → 9400/1200=47/6≈7.8333333.

13/12≈1.0833333.

So 7.8333333 +1.0833333=8.9166666... So $8.92.

For m=400:

C= (47/1200)*400 +13/12.

47*400=18,800 →18,800/1200=47/3≈15.6666667.

Adding 13/12: 15.6666667 +1.0833333=16.75.

So 16.75 is $16.75, which is $16.75.

Looking back at the options, none of the options have $8.92 and $16.75. The closest is option A: $8.90 and $16.70, which is a bit lower than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the fraction calculations. Let me try another approach.

Wait, 9400/1200 = let me compute it as 9400 ÷ 1200.

1200 ×7=8400.

9400-8400=1000.

So 7 + 1000/1200=7 +5/6=7.8333333.

13/12 is 1.0833333.

So 7.8333333 +1.0833333=8.9166666.

Hmm, I don't think I made a mistake here. So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but maybe the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the cost to be calculated without the fixed cost, even though it's not consistent with the given data. Let me try that.

If the cost per mile is calculated as (28.50 -5)/(700-100)=23.5/600=0.039166666 per mile.

So for 200 miles: 200 ×0.039166666≈7.8333333.

But wait, that's without a fixed cost. So perhaps the intended model is C=0.039166666*m.

But then for 100 miles, 0.039166666*100=3.9166666, which is less than 5. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the fixed cost is zero, but that would require the two points to be aligned without it, which they aren't.

Wait, perhaps I should see which option's 200 and 400 mile costs fit a linear model with the given points.

Let me consider each option and see whether they fit.

Take option A: 200 miles costs $8.90, 400 miles $16.70.

Let me see if these points fit a linear model with (100,5) and (700,28.50).

First, compute the slope between (100,5) and (200,8.90).

Slope would be (8.90-5)/(200-100)=3.90/100=0.039 per mile.

Then, for
