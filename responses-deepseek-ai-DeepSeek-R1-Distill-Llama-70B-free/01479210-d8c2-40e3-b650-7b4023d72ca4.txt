Question:

Options:

A: Yes, admission by party.
B: No, opinion on an ultimate issue that must be left for the jury.
C: Yes, because it's a spontaneous statement
D: No, because the statement was made under duress
E: Yes, because it's a recorded statement
F: No, because the statement was not made under oath
G: Yes, because it's an excited utterance
H: No, because the statement is prejudicial
I: No, hearsay without an exception.

Okay, so I have this evidence question about whether Officer Friendly's testimony is admissible in a wrongful death lawsuit. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: Justin's estate is suing Polly for wrongful death. They called Officer Friendly as a witness. The officer is going to testify about what Polly said right after the event. Polly said, "Oops, I was cleaning my pistol and it went off and shot Justin. I sure was negligent!"

The question is whether this testimony is admissible. The options are from A to I, with various reasons.

I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, certain statements are admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, if Polly's statement is hearsay, we need to see if it fits any exception.

Option A says it's an admission by a party. I think admissions by a party-opponent are an exception under FRE 801(d)(2). So if Polly was a party to the lawsuit (which she is, as the defendant), her statement would be admissible as an admission. But wait, does it matter if she's the party? Yes, because she's the defendant, her statement is an admission. So A could be a possible correct answer.

Option B says no because it's an opinion on an ultimate issue. Polly said she was negligent. But I think that parties can express their opinions, especially about their own actions. The ultimate issue in a trial is for the jury, but a witness's opinion on that doesn't necessarily make it inadmissible. Plus, this is a statement by the party herself, so it's more of a factual admission rather than an expert opinion. So B might not be the right reason to exclude it.

Option C suggests it's a spontaneous statement. Spontaneous statements are covered under the excited utterance exception, which is FRE 803(2). For that, the statement must be made under the stress of a startling event. Here, the statement was made right after the event, so maybe it qualifies. But I'm not sure if that's the best fit because the primary issue is that it's an admission by the party.

Option D says it's under duress. There's no indication that Polly was under duress when she made the statement to the officer. She was just being interviewed, so D doesn't seem to apply.

Option E says it's a recorded statement. The question doesn't mention whether it's recorded, so E is probably irrelevant here.

Option F argues it's not under oath. But the statement was made out of court, so whether it's under oath doesn't affect its admissibility as an admission. Admissions don't have to be made under oath to be admissible.

Option G suggests it's an excited utterance. As I thought earlier, this might fit, but the stronger reason is that it's an admission. So even if G is a possible exception, the more direct reason is A.

Option H says it's prejudicial. All evidence is supposed to be relevant and not unfairly prejudicial. But here, the statement is relevant to show Polly's negligence, which is central to the wrongful death claim. So the probative value likely outweighs any prejudice, making H not the right choice.

Option I claims it's hearsay without an exception. But if it's an admission by a party, it's not hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2). So I is incorrect because there is an exception.

Putting it all together, the best answer seems to be A: Yes, admission by party. Because Polly is the defendant, her statement admitting negligence is an admission by a party-opponent and thus admissible.

The statement made by Polly is admissible as an admission by a party-opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2). Admissions by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay and are admissible without needing another exception. Polly, as the defendant, made the statement, which directly pertains to her negligence. Other options, such as excited utterance or spontaneous statement, could apply but are not the strongest basis for admissibility. The statement is relevant and not unfairly prejudicial, making Option A the correct choice.
