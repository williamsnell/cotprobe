Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ethnic identity, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The question is, "Ethnic identity refers to..." and there are ten options from A to J.

First, I should recall what ethnic identity means. From what I remember, ethnic identity has to do with how individuals identify with a particular ethnic group. It's about the connection and sense of belonging someone feels towards their ethnic group's culture, traditions, and values. It's not just about the group itself, but also the individual's personal identification with it.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: A rejection of Caucasian social, cultural, and institutional standards. Hmm, this sounds more like opposition to a specific group's standards, maybe related to something like internalized oppression, but I don't think that's what ethnic identity is. Ethnic identity is more about embracing one's own group rather than rejecting another.

Option B: The rejection of all cultural traditions and practices. No, that doesn't seem right. Ethnic identity isn't about rejecting everything; it's about identifying with one's own. Rejecting all traditions would be more like cultural rejection, not identity.

Option C: The extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a given group. This sounds closer. It's about how much a person supports and actively engages in their ethnic group's traditions. That aligns with what I remember about ethnic identity involving both cognitive (endorsement) and behavioral (practice) aspects.

Option D: Cultural practices and beliefs that are non-Western in orientation and perspective. No, ethnic identity isn't limited to non-Western cultures. It applies to any ethnic group, regardless of whether they're Western or not. So this option is too narrow.

Option E: Adherence to only Western cultural traditions and practices. Again, this is too restrictive. Ethnic identity can be about any culture, not just Western. Plus, it's about one's own group, not just Western.

Option F: The extent to which an individual rejects their own ethnocultural traditions and practices. This is the opposite of what I'm thinking. Ethnic identity is about embracing, not rejecting, one's own culture.

Option G: The adoption of multiple ethnic identities and practices. While some people do identify with multiple ethnicities, the question is about what ethnic identity refers to in general, not specifically about multiple identities.

Option H: The extent to which an individual practices the traditions of the majority culture. This sounds more like acculturation or assimilation into the dominant culture, not ethnic identity. Ethnic identity is about one's own group, not necessarily the majority.

Option I: The collective cultural practices, traditions, and orientations of ethnic minority communities. This describes the cultural aspects of ethnic groups but doesn't capture the individual's identification with them. Ethnic identity is more about the individual's sense of belonging, not just the group's practices.

Option J: The adoption of the cultural practices of the dominant group. Again, this is about adopting the majority's culture, which relates more to assimilation than ethnic identity.

So putting it all together, the best answer seems to be option C. It directly addresses the individual's endorsement and practice of their ethnic group's traditions, which fits the definition of ethnic identity.

The correct answer is option C, as it accurately describes ethnic identity in terms of an individual's endorsement and practice of their ethnic group's traditions.
