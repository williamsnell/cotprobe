Okay, so I have this question about John Rawls and his theory. I'm a bit rusty on my political philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the two parts of Rawls' theory and how they relate to each other. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Rawls is known for his work in justice, specifically "A Theory of Justice". In that book, he presents two principles of justice. The first is about equal basic liberties, and the second includes the difference principle and fair equality of opportunity. But wait, the question is about the two parts of his theory, not the two principles.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, Rawls' theory has two main parts: the original position and the two principles of justice. The original position is a thought experiment where people decide on principles of justice without knowing their place in society. The two principles are the outcomes of that decision.

But the question is about how these two parts relate. Are they independent or interdependent? So the question is asking whether one can accept one part without the other. Hmm.

I think Rawls sees the original position as a way to derive the two principles. So the two principles are based on the original position. Therefore, the parts are interdependent. You can't really accept one without the other because the principles are the result of the original position setup.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: Can be proven false with logical reasoning. I don't think that's the point here; the question is about their relationship, not their validity.

Option B: Are independent: You can accept either without the other. That would mean they're separate, but I don't think that's right because the principles come from the original position.

Option C: Based purely on empirical evidence. No, Rawls is more of a normative philosopher, so this isn't about empirical data.

Option D: Not open to debate. No, philosophical theories are always debated.

Option E: Cannot be justified via rational means. No, Rawls uses rational choice in the original position.

Option F: Justified through emotional appeal. No, it's about reason.

Option G: Based on personal preferences. No, Rawls is about fairness and reason.

Option H: Dependent but can be accepted separately. So they depend on each other but can be taken alone. That seems contradictory. If they're dependent, you can't accept one without the other.

Option I: Interdependent; can't accept one without the other. That sounds right because the principles are derived from the original position.

Option J: Provable from self-evident premises. I don't think he claims that; it's more about a constructed situation leading to the principles.

So the correct answer should be I: interdependent, can't accept one without the other.

The question concerns the relationship between the two parts of John Rawls' theory. Rawls' theory includes the original position, a thought experiment where individuals decide on principles of justice without knowledge of their societal position, and the two principles of justice that emerge from this setup. These two parts are interdependent because the principles are derived from the original position. Therefore, one cannot accept one part without the other.

Option I correctly captures this interdependence, stating that the parts are interdependent and cannot be accepted separately.

Answer: I
