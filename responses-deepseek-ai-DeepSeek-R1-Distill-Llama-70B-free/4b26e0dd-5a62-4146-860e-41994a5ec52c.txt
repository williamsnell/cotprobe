Question:

In Python 3, which of the following function convert a string to an int in python?

Options:

A: short(x)
B: float(x)
C: integer(x [,base])
D: double(x)
E: int(x [,base])
F: long(x [,base] )
G: num(x)
H: str(x)
I: char(x)
J: digit(x [,base])

Okay, so I've got this Python question in front of me. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about which function converts a string to an integer in Python 3. The options are A through J, each with different functions.

Hmm, I remember that in Python, there are built-in functions to convert between data types. For strings to integers, I think the main function is int(). So I'm looking for an option that uses int(x). Let me look at the options.

Option A is short(x). Wait, short isn't a function I recognize in Python. I think that's more of a C or Java type, not Python. So probably not A.

Option B is float(x). Oh right, float converts to a floating-point number, not an integer. So B is for floats, not ints.

Option C is integer(x [,base]). That sounds right, but wait, does Python have an integer() function? Or is it called int()? I'm pretty sure it's int(), not integer(). So C might not be correct.

Option D is double(x). Double is another term for float in some languages, but in Python, I think we just use float, so D is probably not it.

Option E is int(x [,base]). Yes, that rings a bell. The int() function can take a string and convert it, and it also has an optional base parameter. Like int('10', 2) would be 2 in binary. So E looks correct.

Option F is long(x [,base]). Wait, in Python 2, there was a long type, but in Python 3, int handles arbitrarily large numbers, so long isn't used anymore. So F is outdated.

Option G is num(x). I don't think num is a built-in function in Python. Maybe it's from some module, but not standard.

Option H is str(x). That's for converting to a string, the opposite of what we want. So H is out.

Option I is char(x). I don't think char is a function in Python. Maybe in other languages, but not here.

Option J is digit(x [,base]). Not sure about this one. I think there's a method called isdigit(), but not a function named digit that converts. So J probably isn't right.

So putting it all together, the correct function is int(x), which is option E.

The correct function to convert a string to an integer in Python 3 is `int(x [,base])`, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
