Okay, so I have this physics question about prisms and how different colors of light bend. Hmm, I remember that when white light passes through a prism, it splits into different colors, right? This is called dispersion. But wait, why does that happen?

Oh right, it's because each color has a different wavelength and therefore bends at a different angle when it enters the prism. The prism material, like glass, has a different refractive index for each wavelength. So the light slows down and bends.

Wait, which color bends the most and which the least? I think it's the order of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. So in the order they appear, red is on the outside, bending the least, and violet on the inside, bending the most.

So the question is, when white light enters a prism, green light is bent more than which color. The options are A to J, with various colors and other options.

Looking at the options, the question is about which color is bent less than green. Because if green is bent more than that color, that color must be bent less.

So green is in the middle of the spectrum. Let me think about the order again. The refractive index increases as the wavelength decreases. So longer wavelengths (like red) have lower refractive indices and bend less, while shorter wavelengths (violet) have higher refractive indices and bend more.

So green is in the middle. Colors with longer wavelengths than green (like yellow, orange, red) will be bent less than green. Colors with shorter wavelengths (blue, indigo, violet) will be bent more than green.

The question is asking which color is bent less than green. So the correct answer would be a color that's on the red side of green. Let's see the options.

Option A: brown. Wait, brown isn't a color in the standard rainbow. Hmm, maybe it's a trick. But I think the standard colors are ROYGBIV.

Option B: orange. Orange is after red, so longer wavelength than green. So orange would bend less than green.

Option C: indigo. Indigo is after green, so it bends more. So green bends less than indigo? No, the question is about a color that is bent less than green.

Option D: blue. Blue is after green, so it bends more than green.

Option E: yellow. Yellow is before green in the order? Wait no, ROYGBIV is R, O, Y, G, B, I, V. So after yellow comes green. So yellow has a longer wavelength than green? Wait no, yellow's wavelength is longer than green? Or is it the other way around?

Wait wait, wait. Let me clarify. The order is based on wavelengths: red has the longest wavelength, then orange, then yellow, then green, then blue, indigo, violet with the shortest.

Wait no, wait: no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think numerically. The visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So red is ~700 nm, orange ~610, yellow ~580, green ~530, blue ~470, indigo ~450, violet ~400.

So green is about 530 nm. So any color with a longer wavelength than green (like yellow, orange, red) will have lower refractive indices and bend less.

So in the question, the options are which color is bent less than green. So the correct answer would be a color that comes before green in the ROYGBIV order, which are yellow, orange, red, etc.

Looking back at the options, the question is which color is bent less than green. So the correct answer would be a color that's bent less, which is a color with a longer wavelength than green.

Looking at the choices:

Option B is orange. Orange has a longer wavelength than green, so it bends less. So for the question, when green light is bent more than which color, the answer would be orange, because green bends more than orange.

Wait, let me make sure. So the question is: "green light is bent more than..." which color. So which color is bent less than green. So any color that comes before green in the order (ROY) would be bent less.

So let's see the options. Option B is orange. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but what about option H: red light. Red is even more bent less than orange, but the question is asking which color is bent less than green. So any of ROY would qualify, but the options might have only one correct choice.

So the options are:

A: brown (probably not, since it's not in ROYGBIV)

B: orange

C: indigo (bends more than green)

D: blue (more than green)

E: yellow (bends less than green)

F: violet (most bent)

G: None correct

H: red (bends less than green)

I: all equal (no)

J: black (no, not a color of light here)

So the question is, which color is bent less than green. So any of the ROY colors (red, orange, yellow) would fit. So looking at the options, B (orange), E (yellow), and H (red) are all possible.

Wait, the options in the question are for "white light enters a prism green light is bent more than..." So the correct answer should be a color that is bent less than green. So which of the options is such a color.

So looking at the options, the correct choices would be any color with longer wavelength than green, which are red, orange, yellow. So the options B, E, H are possible.

But the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer. So which of these is an option in the given choices.

Looking at the options given:

A: brown light.

B: orange light.

C: indigo light.

D: blue light.

E: yellow light.

F: violet light.

G: None of these choices is correct.

H: red light.

I: all colors are bent equally.

J: black light.

So in the options, B, E, H are colors that bend less than green.

But the question is phrased as: "green light is bent more than...", so it's looking for the color that is bent less.

So in the given options, possible correct answers could be B, E, or H. But the question asks which one is correct. So the correct answer would be any of these, but only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which color is correct based on the options. The question is multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is one of B, E, H. But the question is, which is the correct option? So the possible correct options are B, E, H.

But the question is: "When white light enters a prism green light is bent more than..." So which color is bent less than green.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the correct answer would be one of them. So in the given options, the correct answers would be B (orange), E (yellow), H (red), any of those.

Wait, but the question is looking for a single answer. So perhaps the correct option is B: orange.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The question is, which color is bent less than green. So any color that comes before green in the spectrum.

So among the options, B is orange, E is yellow, H is red.

So which one is correct? The correct answer would be any of these, but the question may have only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options are:

The question is, which color is green bent more than. So the color that is bent less is the correct answer.

So looking at the options, the correct answer would be B (orange), E (yellow), or H (red). But the options only include these as separate choices.

Wait, but let me think about the standard ROYGBIV order. Green is after yellow, so yellow is before green. So yellow light has a longer wavelength than green, so it's bent less. So in the options, E is yellow, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is, when white light enters a prism, green light is bent more than which color.

So that color is bent less than green. So the correct answer would be a color that is on the red side of the spectrum relative to green.

So the correct options would include B (orange), E (yellow), and H (red).

But looking at the options, all three are present. So the question is, which one of these is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the color that comes right after green. No, that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options provided. The question's correct answer is one of the options B, E, H. But the possible choices are the options given. So perhaps the answer is E: yellow.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the order of refraction. The higher the refractive index, the more the bending. Refractive index increases with decreasing wavelength.

So green has a certain wavelength. The colors with longer wavelengths (like red) have lower refractive indices and bend less. So the correct answer is a color that has a longer wavelength than green, which is red, orange, or yellow.

So the correct answer is one of B, E, H. Now, looking at the options, which one is present?

The options for the question are:

A: brown.

B: orange.

C: indigo.

D: blue.

E: yellow.

F: violet.

G: None correct.

H: red.

I: all equal.

J: black.

So the correct answer must be one of B, E, or H.

Wait, but in the question, the correct answer is which color is bent less than green. So all of B, E, H are correct. But the question expects a single choice. So perhaps the intended answer is H: red light.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E: yellow. Because yellow is the color just before green in the spectrum. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which of these is the most correct. The question is about green being bent more than which color. So the color that is bent less than green would be any color with a longer wavelength than green.

So the correct answer would include red, orange, and yellow. Since the options include B (orange), E (yellow), and H (red), all of these are correct. But the question expects one answer, so perhaps the intended answer is E: yellow.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: red light, assuming red is the color with the longest wavelength and thus is bent the least. But the question is not about the least, but about a color that is bent less than green.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is none of the options, because all the colors that are less bent than green are present as options. But that's not the case, because the options include B, E, H. So perhaps the correct answer is more than one, but in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice with only one correct option. So perhaps the intended answer is E: yellow.

Wait, maybe I should think about the typical example. I remember that red is bent the least, and violet the most. So green is in the middle. So if the question is which color is bent less than green, red is one such color.

So option H is red. So the correct answer would be H: red light.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because all three (B, E, H) are correct. But perhaps in the given options, the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the color that comes right before green in the spectrum, which would be yellow. So E would be the correct answer.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm considering all possibilities. Let me try to remember the typical order. The order from least bent to most bent is: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

So green is more bent than red, orange, yellow. So any of these would be correct. But the question is which option is correct.

Looking at the options, all three are present. But since the question is multiple-choice, only one can be correct. So perhaps the intended answer is B: orange.

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think about this differently. The question is asking which color is bent less than green. So the correct answer is a color that comes before green in the order. So the options are B (orange), E (yellow), H (red).

So for example, if option E is yellow, which is right before green, then green bends more than yellow. So the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, if the question had the option of red, which is further along, then that would also be correct.

But since all three are present, perhaps the correct answer is E: yellow.

Wait, but no, because yellow is before green, so green bends more than yellow. So if the question is "green is bent more than...", then the answer would be yellow.

So option E is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct answer is one of B, E, H. But I'm not entirely sure which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: red light, assuming red is the color that is bent the least. But the question isn't about which bends the least, but which is bent less than green.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: yellow.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider the refractive indices for different colors.

In a prism, the refractive index n is higher for shorter wavelengths. So for example, n_red < n_orange < n_yellow < n_green < n_blue < n_indigo < n_violet.

So the refractive indices increase as the color's wavelength decreases.

So green has a higher refractive index than yellow, which means green bends more than yellow.

So the question is, green light is bent more than which color. So the correct answer is yellow.

So in the options, E is yellow.

So the correct answer is E.

When white light enters a prism, it splits into its constituent colors due to dispersion. Each color bends at a different angle because it has a unique wavelength and refractive index. The order of colors in the visible spectrum, from longest wavelength (least bent) to shortest wavelength (most bent), is: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

The question asks which color is bent less than green. Colors with longer wavelengths than green (red, orange, yellow) are bent less, while colors with shorter wavelengths (blue, indigo, violet) are bent more. Among the options provided:

- **A: Brown light** is not part of the standard visible spectrum and is irrelevant.  
- **B: Orange light** has a longer wavelength than green and is bent less.  
- **C: Indigo light** has a shorter wavelength than green and is bent more, so this is incorrect.  
- **D: Blue light** also has a shorter wavelength than green and is bent more, so this is incorrect.  
- **E: Yellow light** has a longer wavelength than green and is bent less.  
- **F: Violet light** has the shortest wavelength and is bent the most, so this is incorrect.  
- **G: None of these choices is correct** is incorrect because some options (B, E, H) are valid.  
- **H: Red light** has the longest wavelength and is bent the least, so this is also correct.  
- **I: All colors are bent equally** is incorrect because colors bend differently due to varying refractive indices.  
- **J: Black light** is not part of the visible spectrum and is irrelevant.  

While both **B (orange)** and **H (red)** are valid answers, the question likely expects a single correct answer. Since yellow is the color immediately before green in the spectrum and is bent less than green, the most appropriate answer is **E: Yellow light**.

Answer: E
