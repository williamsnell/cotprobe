Okay, so I've got this system of equations to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with algebra, but I'll give it a shot. Let's see, the equations are:

888x + 889y = 890  
891x + 892y = 893

And I need to find the value of x - y. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that when you have two equations with two variables, you can solve them using substitution or elimination. Since the coefficients are pretty close to each other, maybe elimination would work here. Let's think about how to eliminate one variable.

Looking at the equations, maybe subtracting them would help. Let me write them down again:

Equation 1: 888x + 889y = 890  
Equation 2: 891x + 892y = 893

If I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, what happens? Let's try that.

Equation 2 minus Equation 1:

(891x - 888x) + (892y - 889y) = 893 - 890

Calculating each part:

891x - 888x = 3x  
892y - 889y = 3y  
893 - 890 = 3

So the result is 3x + 3y = 3. Oh, that's simpler! I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3.

3x + 3y = 3  
Divide by 3: x + y = 1

Okay, so now I have x + y = 1. That's one equation. But I need another equation to find x and y. Let's go back to the original equations. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other using this new equation.

From x + y = 1, I can solve for x: x = 1 - y. Or solve for y: y = 1 - x. Maybe substitute this into one of the original equations.

Let me substitute y = 1 - x into Equation 1: 888x + 889y = 890.

So substituting:

888x + 889(1 - x) = 890

Expanding the terms:

888x + 889*1 - 889x = 890  
888x + 889 - 889x = 890

Combine like terms for x: 888x - 889x = -x  
So: -x + 889 = 890

Subtract 889 from both sides:  
-x = 890 - 889  
-x = 1

Multiply both sides by -1:  
x = -1

Wait, x is -1? That seems a bit odd, but okay, maybe it's correct. Now, since x + y = 1, let's find y.

x = -1, so y = 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

So y is 2. Now, the question asks for x - y.

x - y = (-1) - 2 = -3.

Hmm, looking at the options, option E is -3. So that should be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's plug x and y back into the original equations to verify.

First equation: 888x + 889y  
888*(-1) = -888  
889*2 = 1778  
Adding them: -888 + 1778 = 890. Which matches the first equation. Good.

Second equation: 891*(-1) + 892*2  
891*(-1) = -891  
892*2 = 1784  
Adding them: -891 + 1784 = 893. Which matches the second equation. Perfect.

So x is -1, y is 2. x - y is -3, which is option E.
</think>

To solve the system of equations:

1. \( 888x + 889y = 890 \)  
2. \( 891x + 892y = 893 \),  

we start by subtracting the first equation from the second:

\[
(891x - 888x) + (892y - 889y) = 893 - 890
\]

Simplifying:

\[
3x + 3y = 3
\]

Dividing through by 3:

\[
x + y = 1 \tag{3}
\]

Next, solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \) from equation (3):

\[
x = 1 - y
\]

Substitute \( x = 1 - y \) into the first equation:

\[
888(1 - y) + 889y = 890
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
888 - 888y + 889y = 890
\]

\[
888 + y = 890
\]

\[
y = 2
\]

Using \( x + y = 1 \), substitute \( y = 2 \):

\[
x + 2 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -1
\]

Finally, calculate \( x - y \):

\[
x - y = -1 - 2 = -3
\]

Thus, the value of \( x - y \) is \(-3\), corresponding to option **E**.
