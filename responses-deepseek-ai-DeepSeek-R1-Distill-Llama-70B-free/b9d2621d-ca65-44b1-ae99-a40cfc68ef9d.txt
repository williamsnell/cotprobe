Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Jack sells magazine subscriptions door to door after school. He gets 85 cents commission for every subscription he sells. Last week, he sold 17 subscriptions. The question is asking how much his commission was, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, so the problem is about calculating commission. Commission is like a payment based on sales, right? So for each subscription Jack sells, he gets 85 cents. He sold 17 subscriptions, so I need to multiply 85 cents by 17 to find the total commission.

Wait, but I should make sure I understand what 85 cents is in terms of dollars. Since 100 cents equal a dollar, 85 cents is 0.85 dollars. That makes the calculation easier because I can work in dollars throughout.

So the calculation is 0.85 multiplied by 17. Let me write that down: 0.85 * 17. Hmm, how do I compute that?

Well, I can break it down. 17 is 10 + 7. So 0.85 times 10 is 8.5, and 0.85 times 7 is... let me calculate that. 0.85 * 7: 0.8 *7 is 5.6, and 0.05 *7 is 0.35. So adding those together, 5.6 + 0.35 is 5.95. 

Now, adding the two parts together: 8.5 (from the 10) plus 5.95 (from the 7) equals 14.45. So the total commission should be $14.45.

Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 17 times 0.85. Alternatively, I could write it as 17 * 85 cents. 17 * 85 is... let's see, 17 * 80 is 1360, and 17 *5 is 85, so 1360 +85 is 1445 cents. To convert that to dollars, divide by 100, which gives 14.45 dollars. Yep, that's the same result as before.

Looking back at the options provided, option B is $14.45. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just glance through the other options to make sure none of them are close or if I made a calculation error. 

Option A is 19.55, which is higher. C is 15.95, a bit higher. D is 18.70, way higher. E is 17, which is exactly 17 dollars, but that's without the 85% commission. F is 13.90, lower. G is 12.75, lower. H is 10.20, way lower. I is 20.45, higher. J is 16.15, which is 16 dollars and 15 cents. No, none of these match except B. So I'm confident that B is the correct answer.

The correct answer is calculated by multiplying Jack's commission per subscription (85 cents or $0.85) by the number of subscriptions he sold (17). 

0.85 * 17 = 14.45

Thus, the amount of his commission is **$14.45**, which corresponds to option B.
