Question:

A previously healthy 40-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of constant substernal chest pain for 12 hours that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration. The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward. There is no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38째C (100.4째F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues?

Options:

A: Pulmonary alveoli
B: Aortic intima
C: Myocardium
D: Cardiac valves
E: Vascular endothelium
F: Esophageal sphincter
G: Pleural membrane
H: Tracheal tissue
I: Bronchial epithelium
J: Pericardium

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a medical case, and I need to figure it out. Let's read through the question carefully.

The patient is a 40-year-old man who's previously healthy. He comes to the ED with constant substernal chest pain for 12 hours. The pain gets worse when he coughs or takes a breath in. But when he sits up and leans forward, it feels better. No family history of heart disease. His vitals are: temp 38째C, pulse 120/min, BP 110/60. Lungs are clear on auscultation. Cardiac exam shows distant heart sounds. The ECG has diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. Chest x-ray is normal.

The question is asking which tissue injury is most likely causing his condition. The options are from A to J, each a different tissue.

Hmm. Let's break this down. So the chest pain is substernal, which means it's behind the sternum. It's constant, not squeezing or pressure-like as in angina. It's worse with coughing and inspiration. Oh, wait, that sounds familiar. When pain is worse with breathing or coughing, it's often related to the pericardium or pleura. Because both conditions can cause pleuritic chest pain.

The pain is relieved when sitting up and leaning forward. I remember that for pericarditis, the pain typically improves when the patient sits up and leans forward. In contrast, for conditions like pulmonary embolism or other pleuritic issues, the pain might not have such a specific positional relief.

His temperature is elevated at 38째C, which suggests an inflammatory or infectious process. The pulse is 120, so tachycardic, maybe because of pain or fever. Blood pressure is 110/60, so a bit low but not shock-level. The lungs are clear, so probably not a pulmonary issue like pneumonia, which would present with crackles or wheezing on auscultation.

The cardiac exam shows distant heart sounds. I think that's due to a pericardial effusion. When fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, it can muffle the heart sounds. So that's a clue pointing towards pericardial involvement.

ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. ST elevation in multiple leads suggests pericarditis. In a myocardial infarction, ST elevation is typically more localized to certain regions (like ST-segment elevation in leads corresponding to the affected coronary artery). The diffuse nature here fits pericarditis more than an MI.

Chest x-ray is normal. So no evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax. Also, no signs of cardiomegaly, which could happen in some chronic conditions, but maybe it's acute.

Putting it all together: the presentation is classic for acute pericarditis. The cause is likely inflammation of the pericardium. So the injured tissue is the pericardium.

Looking at the options, J is pericardium. So the answer should be J.

The patient presents with symptoms and signs classic for acute pericarditis. The substernal chest pain that worsens with coughing and inspiration but improves with sitting up and leaning forward is characteristic of pericarditis. The elevated temperature suggests an inflammatory process, and the distant heart sounds on cardiac examination indicate a pericardial effusion. The ECG showing diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads further supports this diagnosis, as this is a hallmark of pericarditis. The normal chest x-ray rules out pulmonary or other structural abnormalities, solidifying the diagnosis. The injured tissue in this case is the pericardium.

Answer: J
