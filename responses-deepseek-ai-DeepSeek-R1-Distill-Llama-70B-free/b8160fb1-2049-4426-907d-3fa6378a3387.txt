Okay, so I've got this question about the law of supply, and I need to figure it out. Let me think. I remember that in economics, there are these basic laws about supply and demand. The law of demand says that when the price of something goes up, people buy less of it, right? And the opposite, when price goes down, demand goes up. 

But this question is about supply. So, the law of supply... I think it's the opposite of the law of demand. Like, when the price of a product increases, suppliers are willing to supply more. Because they want to make more profit, I guess. So the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. That makes sense because businesses would want to produce more if they can sell it for a higher price.

Now, looking at the options here. Option A says a direct relationship between the number of suppliers and quantity supplied. Hmm, that might be true because more suppliers could mean more total supply, but is that the law of supply itself? I think the law is more about the relationship between price and quantity, not the number of suppliers.

Option B talks about an inverse relationship between price and speed of supply. Not sure about that. Maybe higher prices make suppliers act faster, but I don't think that's the core of the law.

Option C is an inverse relationship between price and quantity supplied. Wait, that sounds like the law of demand, not supply. Because demand goes down when price goes up. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D says a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied. That fits with what I was thinking earlier. Higher price leads to higher quantity supplied, so D looks correct.

Option E is about price and demand. That's more like the law of demand again, which is inverse, so E isn't right.

Option F relates quantity supplied and production costs. If production costs go up, maybe suppliers produce less, so that's an inverse relationship. But that's a determinant of supply, not the law itself.

Option G links quantity supplied and the number of suppliers. More suppliers would likely increase quantity, so that's a direct relationship, but again, not the law.

Option H is about quantity supplied and technological advancements. Better tech might make production easier, so more supply, which is a direct relationship. But that's another determinant, not the law.

Option I connects quantity supplied and demand. That seems more like how demand and supply interact in a market, but the law is about the relationship within supply.

Option J is about consumer preferences and quantity supplied. If preferences change, supply might adjust, but again, that's a factor affecting supply, not the law itself.

So the law of supply is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied, which is option D.

The law of supply states that there is a direct relationship between the price of a product and the quantity suppliers are willing to supply. As the price increases, suppliers are incentivized to produce more to maximize profits, and vice versa. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The number of suppliers affects supply but isn't the law of supply.
- **B**: Incorrect. Speed of supply isn't the focus of the law.
- **C**: Incorrect. This describes the law of demand, not supply.
- **D**: Correct. It accurately reflects the law of supply.
- **E**: Incorrect. This relates to the law of demand.
- **F**: Incorrect. Production costs affect supply but aren't the law.
- **G**: Incorrect. The number of suppliers influences supply but isn't the law.
- **H**: Incorrect. Technological advancements affect supply but aren't the law.
- **I**: Incorrect. Demand interacts with supply but isn't the law of supply.
- **J**: Incorrect. Consumer preferences affect demand, not the law of supply.

The correct answer is **D**.

Answer: D
