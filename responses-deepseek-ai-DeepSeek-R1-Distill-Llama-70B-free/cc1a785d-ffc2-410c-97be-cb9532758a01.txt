Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the three basic goals of psychology. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. So, the goals probably relate to understanding, predicting, and influencing behavior. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll try to break it down.

I think the main goals are something like describe, predict, and explain behavior. Or maybe it's more about understanding, explaining, and controlling behavior. Wait, I'm a bit confused between these terms. Let me think: describe would be about observing and measuring behavior, predict is about forecasting future behaviors based on data, and explain is understanding the reasons behind behaviors. Control might come after prediction and explanation, but I'm not certain if that's one of the primary goals.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Improve education, prevent crises, animal behavior. That seems a bit off because while psychology can contribute to education and preventing crises, I don't think those are the basic goals. Plus, animal behavior is more of a specific area within psychology, not a main goal.

Option B: Spiritual experiences, creativity, wealth. No, these don't sound like the core goals. They might be applications but not the primary objectives.

Option C: Measure/describe, predict/control, understand/explain. This sounds familiar. Measure and describe would be like observation and data collection. Predict and control might involve using that data to forecast behavior and possibly influence it. Understand and explain would get into the why behind behaviors. So this seems like it aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

Option D: Cognitive performance, celestial phenomena, new tech. No, these are unrelated to the basic goals of psychology. Cognitive performance is a part, but the others don't fit.

Option E: Economic trends, art, ocean depths. Not related. Psychology doesn't focus on these as primary goals.

Option F: AI, genome, math. Again, unrelated. These are more about technology and other sciences.

Option G: Study mind, emotions, mental health. This is more about applications. While understanding emotions and promoting mental health are important, I'm not sure if they're the three basic goals.

Option H: Diagnose disorders, improve relationships, self-understanding. These seem like applications or practical uses of psychology, not the foundational goals.

Option I: Human development, social interactions, positive behavior. Again, these are areas within psychology but perhaps not the main goals.

Option J: Medication, conformity, historical events. No, these don't fit. Psychology can't prescribe medication everywhere, and ensuring conformity isn't a goal.

So, going back, Option C seems to fit best. The three goals are to measure and describe behavior, predict and control it, and understand and explain it. That makes sense because these are the fundamental steps in scientific inquiryâ€”observation, prediction, explanation.

I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard the goals as describe, explain, predict, and control. Oh wait, maybe in some sources, control is part of the predict step, or perhaps it's an additional goal. But Option C groups predict and control together, which might make sense as they're both about application after understanding.

So I think the correct answer is Option C.

The three basic goals of psychology are best described by Option C. These goals are to measure and describe behavior, predict and control behavior, and understand and explain behavior. These steps are fundamental to the scientific approach in psychology, involving observation, forecasting, and providing reasons behind behaviors.

Answer: C
