Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Egyptian hieroglyphics. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question is: The Egyptian system of hieroglyphics: and then there are options A to J. I need to pick the right one.

First, I'll try to remember what I know about hieroglyphics. I think they were one of the earliest writing systems. They used pictographs, right? So like symbols that represent things. But wait, some symbols might represent sounds too. So option A says it's a simple form with one symbol for one word. I'm not sure about that. I think they might have had more complexity, maybe combining logograms and phonetic elements. So A might not be correct.

Option B is "all of the above," but since I'm not sure about the other options yet, I'll hold off on B for now.

Option C says it appears to have developed suddenly. From what I remember, the development of writing systems often happened gradually. But I'm not certain about Egyptian hieroglyphics specifically. I think maybe they emerged around 3200 BCE, but did they develop suddenly or over time? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option D claims they didn't use pictographs. But I'm pretty sure hieroglyphics did use pictographs, so D is probably incorrect.

Option E says it was borrowed from the Sumerians. Wait, Sumerians were in Mesopotamia, right? They had cuneiform. I think Egyptian hieroglyphs developed independently, so E is probably wrong.

Option F states it was only deciphered in the 20th century. I remember something about the Rosetta Stone being key. The Rosetta Stone was found in 1799, and I think the deciphering happened in the 19th century, like by Champollion in the 1820s. So F is incorrect because it was deciphered in the 19th, not 20th century.

Option G says it was only used for religious texts. No, I think hieroglyphics were used for various purposes, including religious, administrative, and literary. So G is wrong.

Option H claims it was replaced by the Latin alphabet during the Roman period. Wait, the Roman period in Egypt was after they conquered it, around 30 BCE. But the Latin alphabet replaced the Greek alphabet in the Roman Empire, but in Egypt, they used Greek after the Ptolemaic period. Also, hieroglyphs were eventually replaced by Coptic script, which is based on Greek. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I says it was the earliest form of writing in the world. Wait, Sumerian cuneiform is often considered the earliest, around 3500-3000 BCE. Egyptian hieroglyphs started around 3200 BCE, so Sumerian was earlier. So I is incorrect.

Option J claims it was only used by the royal family. No, I think scribes used it for various purposes, so J is wrong.

Now, going back to option C: did Egyptian hieroglyphics develop suddenly? I'm not entirely sure, but I think writing systems usually develop over time. Maybe the earliest evidence seems sudden because we don't have all the steps. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it didn't develop from a previous system and just appeared, which might make C correct.

Wait, another angle: the earliest known hieroglyphic inscriptions are from around 3200 BCE, during Dynasty 0, like the Narmer Palette. Before that, there were symbols but maybe not a full writing system. So it might seem like it developed suddenly because the earlier stages are not as well documented.

So, considering all options, which one is correct?

Looking back at the options, the correct answer should be the one that's accurate about hieroglyphics.

So, the options I thought were incorrect:

A: Maybe not correct because it's more complex than one symbol per word.

B: Only correct if all the other correct options are included, but I don't think so.

C: Possibly correct.

D: Incorrect.

E: Incorrect.

F: Incorrect.

G: Incorrect.

H: Incorrect.

I: Incorrect.

J: Incorrect.

So the only possible correct options are C and perhaps another. Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct.

Wait, the question is phrased as "The Egyptian system of hieroglyphics:" followed by options, each being a statement.

So I need to pick the correct statement.

I think C is correct: appears to have developed suddenly.

Wait, another thought: the development of hieroglyphics might have seemed sudden because it appeared without obvious precursors, but actually, it likely evolved from earlier proto-writing. But maybe the question is stating that it 'appears' to have developed suddenly, which is what the archeological record suggests.

So, C would be correct.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Incorrect.

C: Correct.

Wait, but option F was about deciphering in the 20th century. That's wrong because it was the 19th. So F is incorrect.

So the correct answer is C.

The Egyptian system of hieroglyphics:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Hieroglyphics were not a simple form of writing with one symbol representing one word. They combined logograms, phonetic elements, and determinatives, making them more complex.

- **Option B**: Incorrect. Not all the options are correct, so "all of the above" cannot be the right choice.

- **Option C**: Correct. The development of hieroglyphics appears to have happened suddenly in the archeological record, with the earliest known inscriptions dating to around 3200 BCE. While it likely evolved from earlier proto-writing, the lack of documented precursors makes it seem sudden.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. Hieroglyphics did use pictographs, so this statement is false.

- **Option E**: Incorrect. Egyptian hieroglyphics were not borrowed from the Sumerians; they developed independently.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. Hieroglyphics were deciphered in the 19th century, not the 20th, with key contributions from the Rosetta Stone and Champollion's work.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. Hieroglyphics were used for a wide range of texts, including administrative, literary, and religious, not solely for religious purposes.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. Hieroglyphics were eventually replaced by the Coptic script, derived from the Greek alphabet, not the Latin alphabet during the Roman period.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. Sumerian cuneiform predates Egyptian hieroglyphics, so hieroglyphics were not the earliest form of writing.

- **Option J**: Incorrect. Hieroglyphics were used by scribes for various purposes, not exclusively by the royal family.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
