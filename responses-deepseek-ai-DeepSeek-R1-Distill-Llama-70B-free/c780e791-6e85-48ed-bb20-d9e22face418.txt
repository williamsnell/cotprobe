Question:

A woman joined a web site to get her credit reports. The site required creation of an account before she could enter. On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?

Options:

A: The company will prevail because the woman had the opportunity to review the terms and conditions before agreeing to them.
B: The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.
C: The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.
D: The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.
E: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.
F: The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.
G: The woman will prevail because she did not explicitly agree to the recurring charges.
H: The woman will prevail because she was not given explicit notice of the recurring charges.
I: The company will prevail because the woman did not cancel her subscription and thus accepted the terms.
J: The woman will prevail because the terms were not explicitly stated before she made the initial payment.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding terms and conditions on a website. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is that a woman signs up for a website to get her credit reports. She has to create an account first. On the form, there's a bold notice saying it's a contract, and by creating an account, she agrees to the terms. She didn't click on the link to read them, just went ahead and paid $50. Then, for six months, she's automatically billed another $50 each month without any other notice except emails that her report is available. The terms say she authorizes these charges unless she cancels in advance.

The question is whether she's bound to pay for those six months until she cancels. So, the options are about whether the company or the woman will prevail.

I remember that in contract law, there's something about terms being conspicuous. For online agreements, usually, the courts look at whether the terms were presented in a way that a reasonable person would notice. If the terms are in a place that's easy to see, like in bold or a hyperlink, that usually works. 

In this case, the notice was in bold and there was a link, but she didn't click on it. So, she had the opportunity to review but chose not to. I think courts generally hold that if the terms are accessible, the user is bound by them, even if they don't read them. It's like when you sign a paper contract; you're deemed to have read and agreed, even if you didn't.

So looking at the options, A says the company will prevail because she had the opportunity. B says because the provision is bold and accessible. C says she'll win because terms are adhesion contracts, which I think are more about being take-it-or-leave-it, but that doesn't necessarily make them unenforceable. D says she wins because the terms weren't on the create account page, but the terms were accessible via a link, so maybe that's not the case. E says company because she didn't cancel, implying agreement. F says company because any mention is enough. G says she didn't explicitly agree to recurring charges. H says she wasn't given explicit notice. I says company because she didn't cancel. J says she didn't have terms before payment.

Wait, the key here is whether the recurring charge was part of the terms. She didn't read them, but they were available. So, under the theory of constructive notice, she's bound because the terms were made available to her. So the company can enforce the terms, including the recurring charges.

So looking at the options, A and B seem relevant. B says the provision is in bold and easily accessible. I think that's the case here. So the company would likely prevail because the terms were presented in a way that she had the opportunity to review, even if she didn't. 

Wait, but some cases might require that certain important terms, like recurring charges, be more prominently displayed. Like, maybe just a link isn't enough if it's a subscription. But I think the general rule is that if the terms are available via a conspicuous link, that's sufficient. So the company would win, so options A or B.

Option A says she had the opportunity. Option B says the provision is bold and the contract is easily accessible. So both seem correct, but the question is about the recurring charge. If the terms were accessible and included the recurring charge, then she's bound. So the company would win.

So the correct answer would be either A or B. Let me think. A is about opportunity to review, which she had. B emphasizes the bold and easy access. I think B is more specific about the presentation, so maybe B is the better answer.

Alternatively, some might argue that terms about payment should be explicitly agreed to, not just part of the terms. But I think the general rule is that if the terms are accessible, you're bound. So the company would prevail because the terms were available, and she agreed by creating the account.

So, looking back, option A says the company prevails because she had the opportunity. Option B says because it's bold and accessible. Both seem correct, but in the context of contract law, the key factor is constructive notice. So A might be the better choice because it's about the opportunity, which she had.

Wait, but some courts require that for certain terms, like automatic renewal, there be more explicit notice. For example, some laws require clear and conspicuous disclosure of auto-renewal terms and getting affirmative consent. But I'm not sure if that's a general rule or specific to certain jurisdictions. The question doesn't specify any specific laws, so maybe it's general contract principles.

If that's the case, then the fact that the terms were available via a link and she had the chance to read them would mean she's bound. So the company would win. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but the question says she didn't access the terms, which she could have by clicking a link. So she had the opportunity but didn't take it. So under general contract law, that should be enough for the company to enforce the terms.

So the answer should be A.

The question revolves around whether the woman is bound by the terms and conditions of a website she joined, specifically regarding recurring charges. The key issue is whether the terms were presented in a way that would reasonably notify her of the contract's provisions, including the automatic billing. The woman did not read the terms but had the opportunity to do so via a conspicuous link. Under general contract law, terms are considered enforceable if they are made available in a manner that a reasonable person would notice, even if the person does not actually read them. 

Option A states that the company will prevail because the woman had the opportunity to review the terms and conditions before agreeing to them. This aligns with the principle of constructive notice, where the availability of terms, even if not read, is sufficient to bind the user. While Option B emphasizes the bold and accessible nature of the terms, the critical factor is the opportunity to review, which Option A addresses directly. Therefore, the company is likely to prevail because the terms were accessible, and she agreed by creating the account.

Answer: A
