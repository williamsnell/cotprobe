Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a gorilla climbing a tree, and I need to find the work done. Hmm, work done, right. I remember that work is related to force and distance. The formula, I think, is work equals force multiplied by distance, but wait, is there more to it? Oh right, the angle between the force and the direction of motion matters too, because work is the scalar product. But in this case, I guess the force is in the same direction as the movement since the gorilla is lifting itself up against gravity. So the angle is zero, and cosine zero is one, so it simplifies.

So the gorilla's weight is 360 pounds, and it climbs to a height of 20 feet. Wait, weight is a force, so that's the force here. Force is mass times acceleration due to gravity, but since we're given weight, which is already the force, we can use that directly. So the force is 360 lb.

The distance is 20 feet. So work done should be force multiplied by distance. So 360 lb multiplied by 20 feet. Let me calculate that: 360 * 20 is 7200. So 7200 ft-lb. Wait, what's the unit? Oh yeah, foot-pounds, which is written as ft-lb here.

Wait, but the question also mentions that the gorilla reaches that height in 10 seconds. Oh, but wait, work done is just force times distance, right? The time factor comes into play for power, which is work divided by time. But the question is asking for work done, not power. So I don't think the time matters here. Because work is a scalar quantity that doesn't depend on time, only on the force applied and the displacement in the direction of the force.

So the time given, 10 seconds, is probably a distractor. It's trying to get me to think about power, maybe? Because power would be work over time, so 7200 ft-lb over 10 seconds would be 720 ft-lb per second, but the question isn't asking for that. It's asking for work. So I should ignore the time part.

So I look at the options. Option A is 7200 ft-lb. Option B is 14400, which is double that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Wait, 360 times 20 is definitely 7200. So the answer should be A.

But wait, why would they include the time? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, perhaps it's a trick. Like, maybe it's not the weight but the mass, and I need to calculate the force. Wait, no, because the question says the gorilla's weight is 360 lb. Weight is already the force due to gravity. So I don't need to convert mass to force here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the work done against gravity as the gorilla climbs, which is the same as mgh. Oh wait, but again, that's the same as weight times height because weight is mg. So yeah, 360 lb times 20 ft is 7200.

So the correct answer should be A: 7200 ft-lb.

To determine the work done by the gorilla, we use the formula for work:

\[
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \times \cos(\theta)
\]

Here, the force is the gorilla's weight, which is given as \(360 \, \mathrm{lb}\). The distance is the height climbed, \(20 \, \mathrm{ft}\). Since the force is in the same direction as the motion (upward), the angle \(\theta = 0^\circ\), and \(\cos(0^\circ) = 1\). Thus, the work simplifies to:

\[
\text{Work} = 360 \, \mathrm{lb} \times 20 \, \mathrm{ft} = 7200 \, \mathrm{ft-lb}
\]

The time given in the problem (10 seconds) is irrelevant for calculating work, as work depends only on force and displacement, not on the time taken. Therefore, the time is likely included as a distractor.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: 7200 ft-lb**
