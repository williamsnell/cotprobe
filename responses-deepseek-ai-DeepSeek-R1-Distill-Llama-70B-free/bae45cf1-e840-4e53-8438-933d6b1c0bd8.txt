Okay, so I've got this problem about water flowing through a pipe, and I need to find out the power required. Hmm. Let me think about this step by step. 

Alright, the pipe's inside diameter is 4 inches. Wait, I should probably convert that to feet because the other units are in feet and seconds. Oh right, 4 inches is 4/12, which is 1/3 of a foot. So the radius would be half of that, but wait, do I need the radius for anything here? Maybe not right now. Maybe I just need the diameter for the cross-sectional area.

The pipe is 100 feet long. The mean velocity of the water is 6 feet per second. And the outlet is 3 feet higher than the inlet. So, there's an elevation change here. 

I remember that to find the power required, I probably need to calculate the energy required to lift the water and push it through the pipe. So, power is related to work done over time. The work done would come from two parts: the elevation head and the friction losses, maybe? Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about friction factors or pipe roughness. Hmm. So perhaps this is a problem where we're only considering the power needed to lift the water, not overcoming friction. Or wait, maybe both? Or maybe just one of them? 

Wait, power in a pump or when moving fluids is often calculated using the formula P = (weight)(flow rate)(head) / efficiency. But here, I don't see an efficiency given, so maybe I'm supposed to ignore it, assuming it's 100% efficient. Or perhaps the problem accounts for both the velocity (which relates to the kinetic energy) and the potential energy from elevation.

Wait, but the Bernoulli equation comes into play when considering different heads. The equation is (P1 + ½ρv1² + ρg h1) = (P2 + ½ρv2² + ρg h2). But since this is a pipe, if it's the same diameter, the velocity is the same, so the kinetic energy terms might cancel out. So, the pressure difference would be responsible for lifting the water and overcoming any friction. But again, the problem doesn't give me any data about pressure, so I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the power required is just the rate of doing work against gravity. So, the work done per unit time is the weight of the water times the height it's lifted. The weight is the mass times g, and the mass flow rate would be the volume per second times the density.

So, let's break it down. The volume flow rate Q is the cross-sectional area times the velocity. The cross-sectional area A is πr². The diameter is 4 inches, so radius is 2 inches, which is 2/12 feet = 1/6 feet. So A = π*(1/6)^2 = π/36 square feet.

Q = A * velocity = (π/36) * 6 = π/6 cubic feet per second.

The mass flow rate is density times Q. Density of water is about 62.4 lb/ft³, right? So mass flow rate m_dot = 62.4 lb/ft³ * π/6 ft³/s. Let me compute that. 62.4 * π is approximately 62.4 *3.1416 ≈ 196. So m_dot ≈ 196 /6 ≈ 32.666 lb/s.

Wait, wait. Power is in horsepower. Hmm. So the weight flow rate is m_dot * g, but since we're in the English system, maybe it's better to think in terms of the weight per unit time.

Alternatively, the weight of the water per second is the mass flow rate times g? Wait, no. Because weight is mass times gravity. So in the English system, weight (in lb) is mass (in slugs) times g (32.174 ft/s²). Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The power P can be calculated using the formula:

P = (Q * γ * H) / (550)

Where γ is the specific weight of water (lb/ft³), H is the head (in feet), and 550 converts horsepower.

Wait, but H here is the total head. But in this case, the elevation difference is 3 ft, but we might also have head loss due to friction. Wait, but the problem says "to obtain this flow rate," so perhaps we're considering the power needed to overcome both the elevation and the friction. But since the problem doesn't give any information about friction losses, maybe we're only considering the elevation. Or perhaps the 6 ft/s velocity is the average velocity, and the pipe is long enough that friction plays a role.

Wait, but without knowing the friction factor or anything about the pipe's roughness, I can't calculate the head loss due to friction. So maybe the problem is only considering the elevation. Or perhaps it's assuming that the only work is lifting the water, and moving it at that velocity doesn't require any power beyond that.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the pump has to provide energy both to increase the kinetic energy and the potential energy. But the problem states that the outlet is 3 ft higher, which is the potential energy part, but the velocity is given. So, the kinetic energy per unit time would be ½ m_dot v², and the potential energy is m_dot g H.

Wait, but in that case, the power required would be the sum of these two. Hmm. Let me think.

The kinetic power is (1/2) m_dot v². The potential power is m_dot g H. So total power would be their sum.

But wait, let's compute each part.

First, the potential power. H is 3 ft. m_dot is (density) * Q. So m_dot is 62.4 lb/ft³ * Q, where Q is in ft³/s.

So, m_dot = 62.4 * (π/6) ≈ 62.4 * 0.5236 ≈ 32.68 lb/s (because lb/s is slugs * ft/s², but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units here).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in terms of weight flow rate. Because in the English system, weight (force) is mass (in slugs) times g (32.2 ft/s²). So the weight flow rate (lb/s) would be mass flow rate (slugs/s) multiplied by g (ft/s²), giving lb/s.

Wait, let's recast:

Mass flow rate (m_dot) = density (ρ) * Q.

Density of water is 62.4 lb/ft³. Wait, no, that's actually the specific weight (γ), which is weight per unit volume, so γ = ρ * g = 62.4 lb/ft³.

So, weight flow rate is m_dot_weight = γ * Q = 62.4 lb/ft³ * Q (in ft³/s) → which gives lb/s.

So, Q is (π/36) *6 = π/6 ≈ 0.5236 ft³/s.

So, m_dot_weight = 62.4 * 0.5236 ≈ 32.68 lb/s.

So the rate of doing work against gravity is m_dot_weight * g * H, but wait, no. Because H is in feet, and g is ft/s², but wait, γ already includes g. So, actually, the power P_potential is γ * Q * H.

So P_pot = 62.4 lb/ft³ * (π/6 ft³/s) * 3 ft.

Compute that: 62.4 * (π/6) *3 = 62.4 * (π/2) ≈ 62.4 *1.5708 ≈ 98 lb-ft/s.

Wait, but power is in horsepower. Since 1 horsepower is 550 lb-ft/s, so P_pot = 98 / 550 ≈ 0.1782 hp.

Wait, that's just the potential part. What about the kinetic part?

The kinetic power is (1/2) * m_dot_weight * v². Wait, no, because m_dot_weight includes g. Maybe I should compute it in terms of kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using kinetic energy per unit time, which is (1/2) m_dot * v². But m_dot here is in slugs per second.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it as (1/2) * (mass flow rate in slugs/s) * v² → which would give energy per second (power) in foot-pounds per second.

So, let me compute that.

Mass flow rate in slugs/s is ρ * Q, where ρ is density in slugs/ft³.

Wait, density in slugs/ft³ for water is about 1.94 slugs/ft³ (since 62.4 lb/ft³ divided by 32.2 ft/s² gives approx 1.94 slugs/ft³).

So, m_dot_mass = 1.94 slugs/ft³ * (π/6) ft³/s = 1.94 * 0.5236 ≈ 1.016 slug/s.

So, kinetic power is (1/2) * 1.016 slug/s * (6 ft/s)^2.

Compute that: 0.5 *1.016 *36 = 0.5 *36.576 ≈ 18.288 ft-lbf/s.

Convert that to horsepower: 18.288 / 550 ≈ 0.0332 hp.

So the kinetic part is about 0.033 hp.

Adding both parts, the total power would be approximately 0.1782 + 0.0332 ≈ 0.2114 hp.

Wait, but none of the options are that low. The options start at 0.50 hp (option A), then go up. Hmm, that suggests I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the question is considering the pressure difference required to create the flow, which would involve more factors, including the velocity and the elevation.

Alternatively, maybe the power is the rate of doing work to push the water through the pipe, considering both the elevation and the velocity.

Wait, another approach: The power required is the energy per unit time. The energy comes from the pump's work, which would be force times distance per unit time.

Wait, but F = ρ * Q * (V2 - V1), that's the momentum equation, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe the correct formula to use is P = (γ * Q * H) / (550), where H is the total head, which includes both the elevation and the velocity head.

Wait, velocity head is (V^2)/(2g). So H_total = H_elevation + H_velocity.

So let's compute that.

H_total = 3 ft + (6^2)/(2*32.2) = 3 + 36/(64.4) ≈ 3 + 0.559 ≈ 3.559 ft.

Then, P = (62.4 lb/ft³ * (π/6 ft³/s) * 3.559 ft) / 550.

Compute each part:

62.4 * (π/6) ≈ 62.4 * 0.5236 ≈ 32.68 lb/s.

32.68 lb/s * 3.559 ft = 32.68 *3.559 ≈ 116.5 lb-ft/s.

Convert to horsepower: 116.5 /550 ≈ 0.2117 hp.

Hmm, same result as before. But the options don't have anything that low. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing mass flow rate with something else. Let me try another approach.

Power is also equal to force times velocity. But force here would be the pressure difference times the area.

Hmm, but I don't have the pressure difference. Alternatively, using the work-energy principle: the power supplied is equal to the rate of change of mechanical energy, which includes the potential and kinetic energy changes.

Wait, so perhaps I should consider the energy per unit weight of water. The specific energy is the sum of potential and kinetic heads.

So the specific energy E is H + (V^2)/(2g). So E = 3 + (6^2)/(2*32.2) ≈ 3 + 36/64.4 ≈ 3 + 0.559 ≈ 3.559 ft.

Then, the power P is (Q * γ * E) / (550).

Wait, Q is the flow rate in ft³/s, γ is 62.4 lb/ft³, E is in ft, and 550 is to convert to hp.

So, Q is (π/36)*6 = π/6 ≈ 0.5236 ft³/s.

So, P = (0.5236 * 62.4 *3.559) /550.

Compute numerator:

0.5236 *62.4 ≈ 32.68.

32.68 *3.559 ≈ 116.5.

So, 116.5 /550 ≈ 0.2117 hp.

Same result again. But this is still way below the options given.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the pipe's length is 100 ft? Oh! Because maybe the pipe's length affects the head loss due to friction. But the problem doesn't give any information about friction factors or the roughness of the pipe.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's check the problem statement again. It says, "determine the power required to obtain this flow rate." So, maybe the power is just to push the water through the pipe at that velocity, regardless of elevation. Or perhaps only considering the elevation.

Wait, without considering friction, perhaps the power is just to lift the water and to provide the kinetic energy. So, that's what I calculated before, about 0.21 hp, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recount.

Let me recalculate the potential power. So, γ is 62.4 lb/ft³, Q is π/6 ft³/s, H is 3 ft.

So, P_potential = γ * Q * H = 62.4 * (π/6) *3. The 3 and 6 can be simplified: 3/6 is 0.5. So 62.4 * π * 0.5 = 62.4 * π * 0.5 ≈ 62.4 *1.5708 ≈ 98 lb-ft/s.

Wait, 98 lb-ft/s divided by 550 gives 0.1782 hp. That's correct.

Then the kinetic part: (1/2) * 62.4 * Q * v².

Wait, no, because 62.4 is already γ, which is weight per volume. So, the kinetic power is (1/2) * γ * Q * v².

So, compute that: 0.5 *62.4 * (π/6) * (6)^2.

Wait, that's 0.5 *62.4 * (π/6) *36.

Compute step by step.

(π/6) *36 = 6π ≈18.8496.

0.5 *62.4 *18.8496 = 31.2 *18.8496 ≈ 587.7 (unit is lb-ft/s).

Wait, that's way too high. Wait, that can't be right. Because, lb-ft/s is 1 horsepower when it's 550 lb-ft/s.

So 587.7 lb-ft/s is 587.7/550 ≈1.068 hp.

So, adding potential (0.1782) and kinetic (1.068) gives 1.246 hp, which is approximately 1.25 hp.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.25 hp.

Hmm, that seems to fit. So perhaps I should have included both potential and kinetic heads.

Wait, but wait. When I computed the kinetic power earlier using the mass flow rate, I got about 0.033 hp. But that approach is probably wrong because I confused mass and weight.

Ah, because in the first approach, I used the mass flow rate (slugs/s) and computed (1/2)*m*v², which gave about 18 ft-lbf/s or 0.033 hp. But in the second approach, using γ (which includes g), I got a much larger value.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = γ * Q * (H + (V²)/(2g)).

Which would be the same as adding the potential and kinetic heads.

So, H_total = 3 + (6^2)/(2*32.2) ≈3 + 0.559≈3.559 ft.

Then, P = (62.4 lb/ft³) * (π/6 ft³/s) *3.559 ft / 550.

Compute numerator: 62.4 * (π/6) =62.4 *0.5236≈32.68.

32.68 *3.559≈116.3.

116.3 /550≈0.2115 hp. That's the same as before, but that's not including the kinetic part correctly?

Wait, no. Because when I compute H_total as H + V^2/(2g), and then multiply by γ*Q, that gives the total power for both potential and kinetic changes.

Wait, but that gives me about 0.2115 hp, but when I compute kinetic power separately using γ, I got 1.068 hp.

Wait, now I'm confused. There's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total head as H_total = 3 + (V^2)/(2g), then P = (γ * Q * H_total) / 550.

Wait, that would be: 62.4 * (π/6) * (3 + (36)/(64.4)) /550.

Calculating that:

3 + 36/64.4 ≈3.559 ft.

So, 62.4 * (π/6) ≈62.4 *0.5236≈32.68.

32.68 *3.559≈116.3.

116.3 /550≈0.2115 hp.

But that's not matching the earlier approach where the kinetic part was higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (γ * Q * H) + (1/2) * γ * Q * v².

But wait, that would be H being just the elevation, and the kinetic part is added. So, that would be:

P_pot = γ * Q * H = 62.4 * (π/6) *3 ≈98 lb-ft/s →≈0.1782 hp.

P_kin = 1/2 * γ * Q * v² = 0.5 *62.4 * (π
