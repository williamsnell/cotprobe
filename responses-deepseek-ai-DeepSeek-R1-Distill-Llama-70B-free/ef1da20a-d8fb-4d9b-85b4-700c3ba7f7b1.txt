The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck."

Crosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450–1750 C.E.?

Options:

A: The development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India
B: The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans
C: The establishment of the Silk Road
D: The increasing development of seafaring technologies
E: The beginning of the Industrial Revolution
F: The scientific revolution
G: The development of the printing press
H: The emergence of the Ottoman Empire
I: The discovery of Australia by Western Europeans

Okay, so I've got this history question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about Alfred Crosby's argument in a passage from his book Ecological Imperialism. The passage talks about a society needing to increase its productivity a lot to achieve global hegemony. This "quantum jump" had to happen before the various revolutions we rely on now—like scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial. Crosby says this could only be done by exploiting ecosystems, minerals, resources, and human assets from other continents. He specifically mentions Western Europe doing this with brutality, guns, and geographical luck.

So the question is asking what historical development from 1450–1750 C.E. Crosby's argument is responding to. The options are A to I.

Hmm. Let me think about each option. 

Option A: Direct trade links between Western Europe and India. Well, that's part of the spice trade and the establishment of companies like the British East India Company, but does that fit the passage? The passage is more about exploiting resources on a large scale, not just trade.

Option B: Colonization of the Americas by Western Europeans. That makes sense because colonizing the Americas involved exploiting the New World's resources, leading to a massive boost in productivity for Europe. The exploitation of the Americas' ecosystems, minerals (like gold and silver), and human assets (through slavery and forced labor) would fit Crosby's argument. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option C: The Silk Road. That was earlier, more like before 1450, during the medieval period. Plus, it's about trade routes between Europe and Asia, not the exploitation of a whole continent.

Option D: Development of seafaring technologies. That's important because it allowed Europeans to explore and colonize. But the question is about the development Crosby is responding to. His argument is about the result of that technology, not the technology itself.

Option E: Beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Wait, the Industrial Revolution was later, starting around the 18th century, so after 1750. The period in question is up to 1750, so E is probably not the right answer.

Option F: The Scientific Revolution. That happened in the 16th and 17th centuries, so within the period. But the passage is more about economic and ecological exploitation leading to productivity, not scientific advancements themselves.

Option G: Printing press. That was actually developed before this period, in the 15th century, but more importantly, it's a technological advancement rather than the exploitation of resources.

Option H: Ottoman Empire's emergence. The Ottomans were a major power, but the passage is about Western Europe's actions. The Ottomans were more in the eastern Mediterranean and didn't colonize the Americas.

Option I: Discovery of Australia. That happened later, in the 18th century, so outside the 1450-1750 timeframe.

So putting it all together. The passage is about Western Europe exploiting other continents, which aligns with the colonization of the Americas. So the answer should be B.

The passage by Alfred Crosby discusses how Western Europe achieved global hegemony by exploiting the resources of other continents, particularly through colonization. This aligns with the colonization of the Americas, which occurred during the period 1450–1750 C.E. The exploitation of the Americas' ecosystems, minerals, and human assets significantly boosted Western Europe's productivity, fitting Crosby's argument.

A: Direct trade with India doesn't focus on large-scale exploitation.  
B: Colonization of the Americas involves the exploitation described.  
C: The Silk Road was earlier and about trade, not exploitation.  
D: Seafaring technologies enabled colonization but aren't the focus.  
E: The Industrial Revolution was after 1750.  
F: The Scientific Revolution is about science, not resource exploitation.  
G: The printing press was earlier and not about exploitation.  
H: The Ottoman Empire's emergence doesn't involve American colonization.  
I: Australia's discovery was after 1750.  

The correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
