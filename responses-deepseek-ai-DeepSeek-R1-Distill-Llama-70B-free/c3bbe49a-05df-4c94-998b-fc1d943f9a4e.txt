Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about English law, specifically dealing with extra-territorial abduction and whether it's a ground for refusing jurisdiction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking if extra-territorial abduction—a situation where someone is abducted from another country and brought to face trial in England—can be a reason for English courts to refuse jurisdiction, even if the case against them is otherwise lawful.

I remember that jurisdiction refers to the court's authority to hear a case. So, the issue here is whether the way the defendant was brought before the court (through abduction) affects that authority.

I think about the concept of "abuse of process." In English law, if the way the case was brought to court is so unfair or wrong that it undermines the integrity of the legal process, the court might stay the proceedings. So, could an extra-territorial abduction be considered such an abuse?

I recall a case called R v. Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court, ex parte Bennett. In that case, a person was abducted from South Africa and brought to the UK to face trial. The court held that even though the abduction was unlawful, the court still had jurisdiction. However, the abduction could be an abuse of process, leading to a stay of proceedings if it would be unfair to try the defendant.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So, in the Bennett case, the court said that the English courts do have jurisdiction, but whether they should exercise it is a different matter. The court might decide to stay the proceedings if it's unjust, but it's not an automatic refusal.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that the abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings. But from what I remember, it's not automatic. The court has discretion. So A might not be correct because it's not a guaranteed stay.

Option B states that the abduction makes the abductor liable but doesn't stay the proceedings. I'm not sure about the liability part, but maybe the focus is on whether the case proceeds despite the abduction. But the court can choose to stay it, so B might not be entirely accurate.

Option C suggests that staying proceedings would prevent justice for international criminals. Well, that's more of a policy argument. The court does balance between the illegality of the abduction and the need for justice. But the question is about whether it's a ground for refusal, not the broader implications.

Option D says courts may stay proceedings but will seldom do so. That aligns with what I remember. The court has the discretion, and while they can stay, they don't often do it unless there's significant prejudice or unfairness.

So putting it together: Extra-territorial abduction can be an abuse of process, allowing the court to stay proceedings. However, the court doesn't always do that; it's rare. So the correct answer would be that the court may stay but seldom does.

Looking at the options again, option D fits this understanding. The other options either state it as an automatic stay (A) or ignore the court's discretion (B and C).

The question concerns whether extra-territorial abduction can be a ground for refusing jurisdiction in English courts. The analysis revolves around the concept of "abuse of process" and the court's discretion in staying proceedings. 

In English law, as established in cases like *R v. Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court, ex parte Bennett*, extra-territorial abduction does not automatically divest the court of jurisdiction. However, it may constitute an abuse of process, granting the court discretion to stay proceedings if it would be unfair or unjust to continue. This discretion is exercised sparingly, as the court balances the illegality of the abduction against the need to administer justice.

Option A is incorrect because a stay is not automatic. Option B is misleading as it overlooks the court's discretion to stay proceedings. Option C focuses on policy implications rather than the legal ground for refusal. Option D correctly captures the court's position: it may stay proceedings but does so rarely.

Answer: D
