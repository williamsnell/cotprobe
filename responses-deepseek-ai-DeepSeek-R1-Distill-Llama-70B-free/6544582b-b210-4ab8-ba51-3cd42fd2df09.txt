Question:

The discovery of the element argon by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay had its origins in Rayleigh's measurements of the density of nitrogen with an eye toward accurate determination of its molar mass. Rayleigh prepared some samples of nitrogen by chemical reaction of nitrogencontaining compounds; under his standard conditions, a glass globe filled with this 'chemical nitrogen' had a mass of $2.2990 \mathrm{~g}$. He prepared other samples by removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour from atmospheric air; under the same conditions, this 'atmospheric nitrogen' had a mass of $2.3102 \mathrm{~g}$ (Lord Rayleigh, Royal Institution Proceedings 14, 524 (1895)). With the hindsight of knowing accurate values for the molar masses of nitrogen and argon, compute the mole fraction of argon in the latter sample on the assumption that the former was pure nitrogen and the latter a mixture of nitrogen and argon.

Okay, so I have this problem about the discovery of argon by Rayleigh and Ramsay. Hmm, I remember that argon was discovered because of discrepancies in the molar masses of nitrogen prepared differently. Right, Rayleigh noticed that nitrogen from chemical reactions had a slightly lower molar mass than nitrogen obtained from the atmosphere. Oh wait, no, actually, wait. The problem says that the chemical nitrogen sample was lighter than the atmospheric. Wait, or was it heavier?

So the problem states that the chemical nitrogen (prepared by reacting compounds) had a mass of 2.2990 grams. The atmospheric nitrogen, which was air with O2, CO2, and water removed, had a mass of 2.3102 grams under the same conditions. So same volume, same temperature and pressure, right?

Wait, same conditions, same volume, so same number of moles. Because PV=nRT, same P, V, T → same n. So the molar mass would be mass divided by moles, but wait, the mass is given as per sample. So if the chemical sample is pure nitrogen, and the atmospheric is a mix of nitrogen and argon, then the atmospheric sample is heavier because argon is heavier than nitrogen.

So the idea is that the atmospheric sample has more mass because it's a mixture containing some argon. So we need to find the mole fraction of argon in the atmospheric sample.

Let me think about the steps.

First, let's get the molar masses. I think the accurate molar masses are known now. Nitrogen is about 28.0134 g/mol, and argon is about 39.948 g/mol, I think.

So the chemical nitrogen is pure N2, so its molar mass is 28.0134 g/mol. Let me double-check that. Yeah, nitrogen is N2 with atomic weight about 14.007, so 28.0134.

Argon is Ar, atomic weight around 39.948 g/mol.

So the problem gives the masses of the two samples. Since the conditions are the same (same volume, same P and T), the number of moles is the same for both. So the mass difference must be due to the different molar masses.

Wait, but the atmospheric sample is heavier. Because it's a mix containing some argon. So the atmospheric sample's molar mass is higher than pure nitrogen, so its mass is higher.

So let me model this. Let me consider that the atmospheric sample is a mixture of N2 and Ar. Let's let x be the mole fraction of Ar in the atmospheric sample. Then, the mole fraction of N2 is (1 - x).

The molar mass of the mixture would be (1 - x) * M(N2) + x * M(Ar).

But wait, the problem gives the masses of each sample. Since the volume is the same, the number of moles is the same. So the mass of the chemical sample is n * M(N2) = 2.2990 g. The mass of the atmospheric sample is n * [ (1-x)M(N2) + x M(Ar) ] = 2.3102 g.

So let's set up the equations.

Let me denote:

M_n = molar mass of N2 = 28.0134 g/mol

M_a = molar mass of Ar = 39.948 g/mol

n = number of moles in each sample (since same conditions, same volume, same P and T).

So for chemical sample:

n * M_n = 2.2990 g

For atmospheric sample:

n * [ (1-x) M_n + x M_a ] = 2.3102 g

We can find x from these.

So let's write the two equations.

Equation 1: n = 2.2990 / M_n

Equation 2: n [ (1-x) M_n + x M_a ] = 2.3102

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2:

(2.2990 / M_n ) * [ (1-x) M_n + x M_a ] = 2.3102

Simplify this.

Multiply both sides by M_n:

2.2990 [ (1-x) M_n + x M_a ] = 2.3102 M_n

Expand the left side:

2.2990 (M_n - x M_n + x M_a ) = 2.3102 M_n

Let me factor x:

2.2990 M_n (1 - x) + 2.2990 x M_a = 2.3102 M_n

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio.

Let me write equation 2 divided by equation 1. Since equation 1 is n = 2.2990/M_n, equation 2 is n * (mixture molar mass) = 2.3102.

So equation2 / equation1:

[ n * M_mix ] / [n * M_n] ] = 2.3102 / 2.2990

So M_mix / M_n = 2.3102 / 2.2990

Compute 2.3102 /2.2990 ≈ let me calculate that.

2.3102 ÷ 2.2990 ≈ approximately 1.00483. Let me compute it more accurately:

2.2990 * 1.0048 = ?

Well, 2.299 * 1.0048: Let me compute 2.299 * 0.0048 = approx 0.01103, so total is 2.299 + 0.01103= 2.31003, which is close to 2.3102. So yes, the ratio is approximately 1.00483.

So M_mix = M_n * (2.3102 / 2.2990) ≈ 28.0134 * 1.00483 ≈ let me compute that.

28.0134 * 1.00483 = approx 28.0134 * 0.00483 = 0.1354, so 28.0134 + 0.1354 = 28.1488 g/mol.

Wait, but M_mix is (1-x) M_n + x M_a. So:

(1-x) M_n + x M_a = M_mix

Which is:

M_n (1 -x) + M_a x = M_mix

Substituting the numbers:

28.0134 (1 -x) + 39.948 x = 28.1488

Let me compute:

28.0134 -28.0134 x + 39.948 x = 28.1488

Combine like terms:

28.0134 + (39.948 -28.0134) x = 28.1488

Compute 39.948 -28.0134= 11.9346

So:

28.0134 + 11.9346 x = 28.1488

Subtract 28.0134:

11.9346 x = 28.1488 -28.0134 → 0.1354

So x = 0.1354 /11.9346 ≈ approx 0.01135.

So x is approximately 0.01135, which is about 0.011, or 1.135%.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.011, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to avoid any mistake.

So M_n = 28.0134, M_a=39.948.

The ratio of the masses is 2.3102 / 2.2990 = 1.004834.

So M_mix = 28.0134 * 1.004834 ≈ let me compute that more accurately.

28.0134 * 1.004834 = ?

Compute 28.0134 * 0.004834:

0.004834 * 28 = 0.135352, but 0.004834 * 0.0134 is about 0.0000648, so total is approx 0.1354168.

So M_mix ≈ 28.0134 + 0.1354168 ≈ 28.1488 g/mol.

Then, equation:

(1-x)*28.0134 + x *39.948 =28.1488

Which gives:

28.0134 + x (39.948-28.0134) =28.1488

So x*(11.9346) ) = 28.1488 -28.0134 =0.1354

x=0.1354/11.9346 = let me compute that.

11.9346 into 0.1354.

Compute 0.1354 /11.9346 ≈ approximately 0.01135.

So yes, x is about 0.01135, which is approximately 0.011, which is option B.

To determine the mole fraction of argon in the atmospheric nitrogen sample, we start by analyzing the given data. The chemical nitrogen sample, assumed to be pure N₂, has a mass of 2.2990 g under standard conditions. The atmospheric nitrogen sample, which is a mixture of N₂ and Ar, has a mass of 2.3102 g under the same conditions. Since the samples are at the same temperature and pressure, they occupy the same volume, meaning the number of moles in each sample is identical.

Let the molar mass of N₂ be \( M_N = 28.0134 \, \mathrm{g/mol} \) and the molar mass of Ar be \( M_A = 39.948 \, \mathrm{g/mol} \). Let \( x \) represent the mole fraction of Ar in the atmospheric sample. The molar mass of the mixture is then given by:

\[
M_{\text{mix}} = (1-x)M_N + xM_A
\]

From the problem, the mass of the chemical nitrogen sample is:

\[
nM_N = 2.2990 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = \frac{2.2990}{M_N}
\]

For the atmospheric sample, the mass is:

\[
nM_{\text{mix}} = 2.3102
\]

Substituting \( n = \frac{2.2990}{M_N} \) into the second equation:

\[
\frac{2.2990}{M_N} \cdot M_{\text{mix}} = 2.3102
\]

Simplifying:

\[
M_{\text{mix}} = \frac{2.3102}{2.2990} \cdot M_N
\]

The ratio \( \frac{2.3102}{2.2990} \) is approximately \( 1.00483 \), so:

\[
M_{\text{mix}} \approx 1.00483 \cdot 28.0134 \approx 28.1488 \, \mathrm{g/mol}
\]

Now, substituting \( M_{\text{mix}} = (1-x)M_N + xM_A \):

\[
28.1488 = (1-x) \cdot 28.0134 + x \cdot 39.948
\]

Expanding and rearranging:

\[
28.1488 = 28.0134 - 28.0134x + 39.948x
\]

\[
28.1488 - 28.0134 = x \cdot (39.948 - 28.0134)
\]

\[
0.1354 = x \cdot 11.9346
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{0.1354}{11.9346} \approx 0.01135
\]

Thus, the mole fraction of argon in the atmospheric sample is approximately \( 0.011 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
