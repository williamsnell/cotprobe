Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through what I know about this condition.

Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by purging or other compensatory behaviors. I remember that treatment usually involves a combination of psychological therapy and sometimes medication.

Looking at the options:

A: It is not useful to discuss weight with patients. Wait, I think discussing weight can be sensitive, but maybe it's part of the treatment. Or perhaps it's not the focus. I'm not sure yet.

B: Treatment should focus solely on physical symptoms. No, that doesn't sound right. Bulimia has psychological aspects too, like emotional issues related to eating. So treatment shouldn't be only physical.

C: Therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics. That doesn't seem correct. Avoiding food might not address the underlying issues. It's more about the behavior and thoughts around eating.

D: Use of antipsychotic medication is first-line treatment. I don't think antipsychotics are the first choice. Maybe antidepressants are more commonly used, like SSRIs.

E: The first approach is to discuss body image. Body image issues are a big part of eating disorders, so this might be important. But is it the first approach? I'm not certain.

F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit. Oh, right! Fluoxetine is an SSRI, and I remember that it's approved for treating bulimia. So this could be the correct answer.

G: Treatment should prioritize on patients' social relationships. While social support is important, I don't think it's the main focus of treatment. It's more about the individual's behavior and psychology.

H: Treatments should target exclusively on purging practices. No, because purging is a symptom, not the only issue. The underlying causes like emotional triggers need to be addressed.

I: The main treatment approach is diet control. Diet control might be part of it, but it's not the main approach. It's more about changing the psychological behaviors around eating.

J: Treatment should ignore the psychological aspects of the disorder. Definitely not. Psychological aspects are central to treatment, like cognitive-behavioral therapy.

So, putting it together, the correct statements are likely E and F. Wait, but the options are A to J, and the question asks which is correct. Let me see.

Option F says Fluoxetine is considered of benefit. I'm pretty confident that's correct because I remember that Prozac (which is fluoxetine) is often used for bulimia. Also, CBT is a common therapy approach, but that's not one of the options.

Looking again at option E: The first approach is to discuss body image. That might be part of treatment, but I'm not sure if it's the first approach. Maybe the first line is medication or CBT.

So the correct answer is F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit.

The correct answer is:

F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit.

This is because fluoxetine, an SSRI, is known to be beneficial in the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa. 

Answer: F
