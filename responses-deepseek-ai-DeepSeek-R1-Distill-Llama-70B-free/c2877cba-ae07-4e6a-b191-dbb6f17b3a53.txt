Question:

B: The growing sense of global community, resulting in super-national identities that result from populations feeling closer to one another.
C: The sharing of ideas, technologies and resources that can directly benefit human security, such as medical advancements.
D: A global market that has demonstrated the ability, if left unchecked, to reduce poverty and make substantial economic gains.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about globalization. Hmm, the question is asking which option is NOT a beneficial outcome of globalization. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that globalization generally refers to the increasing interconnectedness of the world's economies and societies. It's often associated with the expansion of global trade, technology, and cultural exchange. But I also know that globalization has both supporters and critics, with different views on its effects.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Redistribution of wealth to address disparities. Wait, does globalization really redistribute wealth in a way that reduces disparities? I think I've heard that globalization can sometimes make rich countries richer and poor countries poorer. It might create more inequality because developed nations might exploit developing ones. So this might not be a beneficial outcome, or perhaps it's not accurate because it doesn't really redistribute wealth as intended.

Option B: Growing sense of global community leading to super-national identities. That sounds positive. People feeling connected across borders can reduce conflicts and foster cooperation, so this is a benefit.

Option C: Sharing ideas, technologies, and resources for human security, like medical advancements. Definitely a benefit. When countries share tech, like vaccines or medical research, it helps everyone, so this is good.

Option D: A global market that reduces poverty and makes economic gains if left unchecked. Wait, I thought that free markets without regulations can lead to issues like exploitation and environmental damage. But some argue that global markets can lift people out of poverty, like in some Asian countries. However, the phrase "if left unchecked" might imply that without any regulations, the market can reduce poverty, which is a positive outcome. But I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate because sometimes unchecked markets can lead to negative side effects, but the option presents it as a benefit.

So the question is which is NOT a beneficial outcome. Let me think again. Option A says redistribution of wealth to address disparities. I think in reality, globalization has been criticized for increasing inequality, not reducing it. So A is presenting it as a benefit, but it's actually not true. So A is the incorrect statement, making it the answer.

Wait wait, but I should make sure. Let me recall: Some argue globalization helps poorer countries by providing jobs and economic growth. Others say it widens the gap because wealthier nations take more. So if option A is about redistribution to address disparities, it's implying that globalization does this, which might be a common perception but perhaps not the reality. So the question is about which is NOT a purportedly beneficial outcome. So if someone is saying globalization does A, but it's actually not true, then A is the incorrect option here.

So among the options, A is the one that's not a beneficial outcome because globalization doesn't really redistribute wealth in a way that reduces disparities; it might even increase them.

The question asks which option is NOT a purportedly beneficial outcome of globalization. 

- **Option A** suggests that globalization leads to the redistribution of wealth, addressing economic disparities. However, globalization is often criticized for increasing inequality rather than reducing it, as wealthier nations may exploit developing ones. This makes A a questionable benefit.  
- **Option B** highlights a growing sense of global community, fostering super-national identities. This is generally seen as a positive outcome of globalization.  
- **Option C** refers to the sharing of ideas, technologies, and resources, such as medical advancements, which is widely regarded as beneficial.  
- **Option D** states that a global market, if left unchecked, can reduce poverty and generate economic gains. While some argue this is true, others point out that unchecked markets can lead to negative consequences. However, the option presents it as a benefit.  

Since Option A is not a true benefit of globalization and instead reflects a common misconception, it is the correct answer.  

Answer: A
