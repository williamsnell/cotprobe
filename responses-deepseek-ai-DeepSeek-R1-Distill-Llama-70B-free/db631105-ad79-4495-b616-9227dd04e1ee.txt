Okay, so I've got this question about methods to reduce prejudice. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that prejudice is a tricky issue, and different methods have been studied to see what works best. Let me think about each option carefully.

Option A: Implementing a quota system everywhere. I'm not sure about this. Quotas might help increase diversity, but could they cause resentment? I think some people might feel it's unfair, which could actually increase prejudice instead of reducing it. So maybe A isn't the best answer.

Option B: Subliminal messaging. That sounds a bit sneaky. I don't think changing beliefs without people's awareness is effective. People might not even notice, and it doesn't address the root causes. Plus, it feels manipulative, which could backfire.

Option C: Providing info contrary to beliefs, equal-status contact, and interdependence. Oh, wait, I remember something about contact theory. Equal-status contact means people from different groups interacting as equals, which can reduce prejudice. Also, when groups are interdependent, working together towards a common goal, that helps too. And providing info that challenges stereotypes makes sense because it can change people's misconceptions. So C sounds like solid methods.

Option D: Promoting segregation. That seems counterintuitive. Segregation would likely increase prejudice because it keeps groups apart and reinforces stereotypes. So D is probably not helpful.

Option E: Avoiding discussions of differences. I think avoiding the topic might just hide the problem instead of solving it. Open dialogue is usually better for understanding and reducing prejudice. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: Directly confronting prejudiced beliefs. Confrontation might make people defensive. It could work in some cases, but maybe not the most effective overall approach. I'm not sure if this is a generally helpful method.

Option G: Strict penalties for prejudiced behavior. Punishing people might stop the behavior publicly, but it doesn't change their underlying beliefs. They might just hide their prejudice, so it's not addressing the root cause. So G might not be the best answer.

Option H: Public info campaigns. Raising awareness through campaigns can help educate people, which is good. But is it enough on its own? Maybe it's part of a solution but perhaps not the most comprehensive method.

Option I: Mandatory diversity training. I've heard mixed things about this. Sometimes, forced training can lead to resistance. Unless it's done well, it might not be effective. So I'm not certain about I being the best choice.

Option J: Forcing desegregation and busing. Desegregation does expose people to different groups, which can help. But if it's forced without addressing underlying issues, it might lead to resistance. However, the contact is important, so maybe this is a good method. But I'm not sure how it compares to option C.

Wait, going back to option C. It includes providing information, equal-status contact, and interdependence. All these are evidence-based methods. For example, in the Robbers Cave experiment, interdependence helped reduce conflict. So C seems like the best answer because it combines multiple effective strategies.

The question asks which methods are generally viewed as helpful in reducing prejudice. Let's analyze each option:

- **A**: Quota systems might increase diversity but could also cause resentment, potentially increasing prejudice. Not the best choice.  
- **B**: Subliminal messaging is manipulative and doesn't address root causes, making it ineffective.  
- **C**: This combines providing information to challenge stereotypes, equal-status contact (reducing prejudice through interaction as equals), and interdependence (working together toward common goals). These are evidence-based methods supported by psychological research, such as contact theory and the Robbers Cave experiment. This is a strong candidate.  
- **D**: Segregation reinforces stereotypes and increases prejudice, so it's counterproductive.  
- **E**: Avoiding discussions of differences hides the problem rather than solving it, making this ineffective.  
- **F**: Direct confrontation might make people defensive and isn't the most effective overall approach.  
- **G**: Strict penalties stop behavior publicly but don't change underlying beliefs, so they don't address the root cause.  
- **H**: Public campaigns raise awareness but may not be enough on their own.  
- **I**: Mandatory diversity training can lead to resistance if not done well, making its effectiveness uncertain.  
- **J**: Forced desegregation exposes people to different groups but might lead to resistance without addressing underlying issues.  

Option **C** stands out as the best answer because it combines multiple evidence-based strategies: providing information, equal-status contact, and interdependence, all of which are proven to reduce prejudice effectively.

Answer: C
