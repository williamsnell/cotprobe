Okay, so I've got this problem about an air-water-vapor mixture, and I'm supposed to find the specific humidity, dew point, and partial pressures. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The given conditions are 1 atm pressure, 75°F temperature, and a relative humidity of 0.45. I remember that relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the actual vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure at the same temperature. So RH = P_vapor / P_saturation.

First, I need to find the saturation pressure of water at 75°F. I think I should look up the saturation properties of water at that temperature. Wait, I recall that at 75°F, the saturation pressure is about 0.2900 psia. Let me double-check that. Oh yeah, I think 75°F corresponds to a saturation pressure around there.

So if RH is 0.45, then the actual vapor pressure P_vapor = RH * P_saturation. So that's 0.45 * 0.2900 psia. Let me calculate that. 0.45 * 0.2900 is 0.1305 psia? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 0.45 times 0.2900... 0.45 * 0.29 is 0.1305, yeah.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes in these problems, the units might vary. Let me make sure I'm using psia correctly. So in the options, the partial pressures are in psia, so that's correct.

So the partial pressure of water vapor is 0.1305 psia? Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Let me check the options again. Let's see, option B has 0.2935 for water vapor, which seems way higher than 0.1305. Option A has 0.1935, which is still higher than 0.1305. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait, no, the saturation pressure I thought was 0.2900 psia at 75°F. But maybe that's not accurate. Let me think again. I might have mixed up the temperature. Let me recall the correct saturation pressure at 75°F.

Wait, 75°F is 23.8889°C. Let me check the steam tables. At 25°C, the saturation pressure is about 0.0317 MPa, which is about 3.17 kPa. Converting that to psia: 1 atm is 14.7 psia, so 3.17 kPa is 0.31 atm. 0.31 atm *14.7 psia/atm = about 4.557 psia. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: no, 1 atm is 14.7 psia. So 0.0317 MPa is 3.17 kPa. 1 atm is 101.325 kPa, so 3.17/101.325 is approx 0.0313 atm. So 0.0313 atm *14.7 psia/atm = approx 0.46 psia. Wait, but that would make the saturation pressure about 0.46 psia at 75°F. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Alternatively, maybe I should look up exact values. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that at 70°F, the saturation pressure is about 0.3632 psia, and at 75°F, it's around 0.4353 psia. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because I think at 100°F, the saturation pressure is about 1.94 psia. So perhaps 75°F is around 0.435 psia? Or maybe I'm mixing Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Antoine equation to calculate the saturation pressure at 75°F. The Antoine equation for water is:

log10(P_sat) = A - B/(T + C)

Where for water, the constants are:

A = 8.14019
B = 1810.94
C = 244.485

But wait, T must be in Kelvin. So 75°F is (75 + 459.67) = 534.67 R, which is 534.67 * 5/9 = approx 297.59 K.

So P_sat = 10^(8.14019 - 1810.94/(297.59 + 244.485)).

Let me compute the denominator: 297.59 +244.485 = 542.075.

So 1810.94 / 542.075 ≈ 3.34.

So 8.14019 - 3.34 = 4.80019.

10^4.80019 is about 6.3e4 psia? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait a second, the Antoine equation gives P_sat in mmHg. Oh, right! So I can't forget that.

So the Antoine equation as I wrote gives P_sat in mmHg. So let me compute that.

So 10^4.80019 = approx 6.3e4 mmHg, which is 63,000 mmHg. That's way too high. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 10^4.8 is about 63000, but that's way too high because atmospheric pressure is about 760 mmHg.

Wait, I must have messed up the calculation. Let me redo it step by step.

Compute T in K: 75°F = (75 + 459.67) = 534.67 R. To Kelvin, 534.67 * 5/9 = (534.67 *5)/9 = (2673.35)/9 ≈ 297.59 K.

Now, plug into Antoine: log10(P_sat) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(297.59 + 244.485)

Compute denominator: 297.59 +244.485 = 542.075.

So 1810.94 / 542.075 ≈ 3.34.

So 8.14019 - 3.34 = 4.80019.

So log10(P_sat) = 4.80019 → P_sat = 10^4.80019 ≈ 6.3e4 mmHg? That can't be right because that's way higher than 760 mmHg (atmospheric pressure). So I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps the Antoine equation gives P_sat in kPa? No, I think the original equation uses mmHg.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong constants. Let me check the Antoine coefficients. Oh wait, maybe the coefficients are for a different temperature range. Because Antoine's equation is sometimes presented with different constants depending on the temperature.

Wait, I think I have the correct coefficients for water in the range 1 to 100°C. Let me check the correct ones.

Yes, for water, from NIST, the Antoine coefficients for T in Celsius (from 1 to 100°C) are:

A = 8.14019

B = 1810.94

C = 244.485

So P_sat in mmHg = 10^(A - B/(T + C)).

So for T = 75°F, which is approx 23.89°C.

So T = 23.89°C.

Compute 23.89 + 244.485 = 268.375.

1810.94 / 268.375 ≈ 6.75.

So 8.14019 - 6.75 = 1.39019.

So P_sat = 10^1.39019 ≈ 24.55 mmHg.

Convert that to psia: 24.55 mmHg * (1 atm / 760 mmHg) * 14.7 psia/atm.

So 24.55 / 760 = approx 0.0323 atm.

0.0323 atm *14.7 psia/atm ≈ 0.475 psia.

Wait, that's different from my earlier thought. So P_sat at 75°F is about 0.475 psia.

So the vapor pressure P_vapor = RH * P_sat = 0.45 * 0.475 = 0.21375 psia.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see some values around 0.1935 or 0.2935. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use a psychrometric chart or exact steam tables for more accurate values. Alternatively, I might have miscalculated.

Wait, let me check 75°F. Let me think, I think at 75°F, the saturation pressure is approximately 0.43 psia. Let me try that.

So if P_sat is 0.43 psia, then P_vapor = 0.45 * 0.43 = 0.1935 psia.

Oh, that matches option A and B for the partial pressure of water. So that's probably correct.

So partial pressure of water vapor is 0.1935 psia. Then, the partial pressure of air would be total pressure (1 atm =14.7 psia) minus water vapor's partial pressure. So 14.7 - 0.1935 = 14.5065 psia. That's what options A and F have.

Wait, option A says water: 0.1935, air:14.5065. So that matches.

Now, moving to specific humidity. Specific humidity (w) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air. The formula is w = (0.622 * P_vapor) / (P_total - P_vapor).

Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. It's w = (0.622 * P_w) / P_a, where P_w is the vapor pressure and P_a is the air's partial pressure. Alternatively, since P_total = P_a + P_w, P_a = P_total - P_w.

So substituting, w = (0.622 * P_w) / (P_total - P_w).

Plugging in P_w=0.1935 psia, P_total=14.7 psia.

So 0.622 * 0.1935 = approx 0.1203.

Divide by (14.7 - 0.1935) = 14.5065.

So 0.1203 /14.5065 ≈ 0.008297 lbmwater/lbmair, which is 8.297e-3. That's option A and B's specific humidity.

Wait, option A: 8.297e-3, option B same. So that's correct.

Now, the dew point. Dew point is the temperature at which the vapor starts to condense. It's the saturation temperature corresponding to the vapor's partial pressure.

So the vapor pressure is P_w =0.1935 psia. So I need to find the temperature at which the saturation pressure equals 0.1935 psia.

Looking at steam tables, I need to find T_dew such that P_sat(T_dew) = 0.1935 psia.

Alternatively, I can use the Antoine equation in reverse. Let me try that.

We have P_sat = 0.1935 psia, which is 0.1935 * 144 psf (wait, no, better to convert psia to mmHg for Antoine).

Wait, 1 psia = 144 psf, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 1 atm = 14.7 psia, which is 760 mmHg.

So 0.1935 psia is (0.1935 /14.7) *760 mmHg.

Calculating: 0.1935/14.7 = approx 0.01315. 0.01315 *760 ≈ 10 mmHg.

Wait, 0.1935 psia is about 10 mmHg.

Now, using Antoine equation to find T in Celsius.

We have P_sat =10 mmHg.

So log10(P_sat)=1.

So 1 = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T +244.485).

Rearranging: (1810.94)/(T +244.485) =8.14019 -1 =7.14019.

So T +244.485 =1810.94 /7.14019 ≈ 253.7.

So T = 253.7 -244.485≈9.215 °C.

Convert that to Fahrenheit: 9.215°C *9/5 +32 = approx 16.5 +32 =48.5°F. Wait, but none of the options have 48.5°F. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Because 10 mmHg is 0.1935 psia?

Wait, 0.1935 psia * (760 mmHg /14.7 psia) = 0.1935 * (760/14.7) ≈ 0.1935 * 51.7 ≈9.99 mmHg ≈10 mmHg.

So P_sat =10 mmHg → T_dew ≈ 9.2°C → 48.56°F.

Looking at the options, option A's dew point is 52.15°F, which is higher than 48.5°F. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe I should use exact steam table values. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct T_dew for P=0.1935 psia is 52.15°F. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should look up the saturation temperature for P=0.1935 psia. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inverse Antoine equation more accurately.

Wait, another approach: from steam tables, at P=0.1935 psia, what's the saturation temp?

Looking up steam tables, the saturation temperature for P=0.2 psia is about 50.67°F, according to some tables. So for 0.1935 psia, perhaps a little lower, maybe around 50°F.

Wait, but let's think more accurately. Let me try to find the exact T where P_sat=0.1935 psia.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Antoine equation more accurately.

Wait, let me compute more precisely.

We have P_sat =0.1935 psia = 0.1935 * 144 = 27.8556 psf? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, psia is pounds per square inch absolute. To convert to mmHg: 1 psia = 760 mmHg /14.7 ≈51.7 mmHg.

So 0.1935 psia *51.7 mmHg/psia ≈ 10 mmHg.

So P_sat =10 mmHg.

Now, using Antoine equation to find T in C.

log10(P_sat) =1.

So 1 =8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T +244.485).

So (1810.94)/(T+244.485)=7.14019 → T+244.485=1810.94/7.14019≈253.7 → T=253.7-244.485=9.215°C → 48.5°F.

Hmm, so the dew point should be around 48.5°F. But looking at the options, none have that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking at the options, option A has a dew point of 52.15°F, which is higher than 48.5°F. What's going on here?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the specific humidity. Let me go back.

Wait, specific humidity w = (0.622 * P_w) / (P_air).

P_air = P_total - P_w =14.7 -0.1935=14.5065 psia.

So w=0.622 *0.1935 /14.5065 = let's compute this.

0.622 *0.1935 ≈0.1203.

0.1203 /14.5065≈ 0.008297, which is 8.297e-3 lbmwater/lbmair. So that's correct as per options A and B.

So now, the issue is the dew point. Because according to my earlier calculation, it's around 48.5°F, but none of the options match that. So perhaps the mistake lies in the assumption of P_sat at 75°F being 0.43 psia.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find the correct P_sat at 75°F.

Wait, perhaps using exact steam tables. Let me look up the saturation pressure at 75°F.

Upon checking, the saturation pressure at 75°F is approximately 0.4353 psia.

Wait, that's different from the 0.43 I used earlier. So let's recalculate with P_sat=0.4353 psia.

So P_vapor =0.45 *0.4353=0.1958 psia.

Wait, but in the options, the P_water is 0.1935 psia in option A and F. So perhaps this is a more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact P_sat at 75°F.

Wait, from steam tables, the exact saturation pressure at 75°F can be found. Let me think. At 75°F, it's about 0.4353 psia, yes.

So P_vapor =0.45 *0.4353=0.1958≈0.1958 psia. Hmm, but none of the options have exactly 0.1958. Option A and F have 0.1935. So perhaps rounding is involved.

Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

But regardless, given that the specific humidity comes out to 8.297e-3, which matches options A and B.

Now, regarding the dew point, using P_vapor=0.1935 psia (as in option A), let's find the corresponding T_dew.

So 0.1935 psia is (0.1935 *760)/14.7 ≈ (147.06)/14.7≈10 mmHg.

So T_dew is where P_sat=10 mmHg.

As before, using Antoine equation, T_dew≈9.215°C→48.5°F.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have used a different approach for the dew point. Let me think: the dew point is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with water vapor, so it's the saturation temperature corresponding to the vapor's partial pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation for saturation temperature.

Wait, another approach: from the psychrometric chart, at a certain web bulb temperature, but
