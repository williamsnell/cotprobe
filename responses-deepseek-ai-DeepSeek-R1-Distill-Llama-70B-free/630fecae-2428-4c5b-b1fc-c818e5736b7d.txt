Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the cost per tire for Good-day Tire Company. Let's see. The question gives me the total expenses and the number of tires produced over six months. I think I remember that cost per unit is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of units produced. 

Wait, so the expenses are $820,600, and they made 110,000 tires. So I guess I just divide 820600 by 110000. Let me write that down. 

Hmm, 820600 divided by 110000. Let me think about how to do this. Maybe I can simplify the numbers. Both numbers end with a lot of zeros, so perhaps I can remove some to make it easier. Let's see, 820600 รท 1000 is 820.6, and 110000 รท 1000 is 110. So now it's 820.6 divided by 110.

Wait, 820.6 divided by 110. Let me do this division. So, 110 goes into 820 how many times? Well, 110 times 7 is 770, and 110 times 7.4 is 814 (because 7*110=770, 0.4*110=44, so 770+44=814). Oh wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can do it step by step. 110 goes into 820 six times because 6*110 is 660. Wait, no, 6*110 is 660, which is less than 820. Let me correct that. Wait, 7 times 110 is 770, which is still less than 820. 8 times 110 is 880, which is more than 820. So 7 times with a remainder.

So 7 times 110 is 770. Subtract that from 820.6, and I get 820.6 - 770 = 50.6. Now bring down the next digit, but wait, there are no more digits. So I add a decimal point and some zeros. So it's 50.60 now.

Now, 110 goes into 506 how many times? Let's see, 110*4 is 440. 440 is less than 506. 5 times 110 is 550, which is too much. So 4 times. 4*110 is 440. Subtract that from 506, which gives 66. So now we have 66.00 left.

Bring down another zero, making it 660. Now, 110 goes into 660 exactly 6 times. So 6 more. So putting it all together, it's 7.46.

Wait, but let me make sure I did that right. So 110 times 7.46 should equal 820.6. Let me check: 7 * 110 is 770, 0.4 * 110 is 44, 0.06*110 is 6.6. So 770 + 44 = 814, plus 6.6 is 820.6. Yep, that adds up.

So the cost per tire is $7.46. Now looking at the options, option J is $7.46. So the answer should be J.

To determine the cost per tire, we divide the total expenses by the number of tires produced. 

**Total expenses**: $820,600  
**Number of tires produced**: 110,000  

\[
\text{Cost per tire} = \frac{820,600}{110,000} = 7.46
\]

The cost per tire is **$7.46**, which corresponds to option **J**.
