Okay, so I have this question about illumination from a lamp and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

The question is asking about the illumination at a distance of 5 feet from a 75 candlepower lamp. The options are given as A through J, each with different foot-candle values. Hmm, I need to find the correct one.

I remember that candlepower and foot-candles are units related to light intensity, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship. I think the formula involves the distance somehow. Oh wait, I think it's something about the inverse square law. Like the illumination decreases with the square of the distance from the source.

Wait, right! The formula for illumination (E) is E = C / dÂ², where C is the candlepower and d is the distance in feet. So illumination in foot-candles is calculated by dividing the candlepower by the square of the distance.

So in this case, the candlepower (C) is 75, and the distance (d) is 5 feet. Plugging those numbers into the formula: E = 75 / (5)^2.

Calculating the denominator first, 5 squared is 25. So 75 divided by 25 equals 3. So the illumination should be 3 foot-candles.

Wait, let me double-check. If I'm at 5 feet away, the light spreads out over a larger area, so the illumination should be less than the candlepower. 75 divided by 25 is indeed 3, so E is 3 foot-candles.

Looking back at the options, option G is 3 foot-candles. That must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculation, but just to be sure, I'll go over it again.

Candlepower is 75. Distance is 5 feet. Square of 5 is 25. 75/25 is 3. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be G.

The illumination from a lamp can be calculated using the formula:

\[
E = \frac{C}{d^2}
\]

where:
- \(E\) is the illumination in foot-candles,
- \(C\) is the candlepower of the lamp, and
- \(d\) is the distance in feet.

Given:
- \(C = 75\) candlepower,
- \(d = 5\) feet.

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
E = \frac{75}{5^2} = \frac{75}{25} = 3 \, \text{foot-candles}.
\]

Thus, the illumination at 5 feet from a 75 candlepower lamp is 3 foot-candles. The correct answer is:

**G: 3 foot-candles**
