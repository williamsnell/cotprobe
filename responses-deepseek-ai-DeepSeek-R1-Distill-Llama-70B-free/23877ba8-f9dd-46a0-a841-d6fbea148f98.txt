Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find A²¹7 minus B²¹7. Hmm, wait, wait. Oh wait, the exponent is 217 degrees, right? Because the question says A^217 and B^217. So it's A raised to the 217th power minus B raised to the 217th power. But wait, A and B are phasors, so I think they're complex numbers in polar form.

Let me read the given values again. A^217 is 30 angle 60 degrees, and B^217 is 21 times (cos160° - j sin160°). Wait, wait, that might be a typo. Because usually, phasors are written in the form of magnitude and angle, either as r∠θ or r(cosθ + j sinθ), which is the rectangular form. But wait, B here is written as 21 (cos160 - j sin160). Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Oh wait, maybe it's using the cosine minus j sine, which I think is the same as the complex conjugate of the standard form. Because normally it's r cosθ + j r sinθ. So if it's cosine minus j sine, that would be the conjugate. So that would be equivalent to r∠-θ, because the angle would be negative.

So, B is 21 at an angle of -160 degrees, perhaps. Because cosθ - j sinθ equals cos(-θ) + j sin(-θ), which is the same as e^{-jθ} in exponential form. Wait, no. Let me think again. The standard form is r (cosθ + j sinθ) which is e^{jθ} when r=1. So if it's cosθ - j sinθ, that's e^{-jθ}, so the angle is negative. So for B, the angle would be -160 degrees. Because cos(160) - j sin(160) is the same as cos(-160) + j sin(-160), but wait, cos is even and sin is odd. So cos(-160) = cos160, sin(-160) = -sin160. So cos160 - j sin160 equals cos(-160) + j sin(-160) which would be e^{-j160}, but in phasor terms, that's an angle of -160 degrees. Or wait, maybe it's 160 degrees in the third quadrant, but with the negative sine, so that's like reflecting across the real axis. So the angle is 160 degrees in the second quadrant, but the negative sine would flip it to the third quadrant. Wait, no, cos160 is negative because 160 is in the second quadrant, and sin160 is positive. So cos160 - j sin160 would be a complex number where the real part is negative (cos160 is negative), and the imaginary part is negative (since it's minus j times positive sin160). So that would place it in the third quadrant. So the angle is actually 160 + 180? Wait, no. Wait, 160 degrees is in the second quadrant. If it's cos160 - j sin160, then the angle might be -160, but that's not right. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe B is given in a form that's not standard. Let me calculate B's rectangular form. So B = 21 (cos160° - j sin160°). Let me compute cos160 and sin160. Cos160 is approximately cos(180-20) which is -cos20 ≈ -0.9397. Sin160 is sin(180-20)= sin20 ≈ 0.3420. So cos160 is about -0.9397, and sin160 is about 0.3420. So B is 21*(-0.9397) + j*(-0.3420)*21. So that would be approximately 21*(-0.9397 - j0.3420). Let me compute that: 21*(-0.9397) is about 21*(-0.94)= -19.74. And the imaginary part is 21*(-0.342)= -7.182. So B is approximately -19.74 -j7.182. Wait, but that's the rectangular form. So that's the same as a phasor with magnitude sqrt[(-19.74)^2 + (-7.182)^2] and angle arctan( (-7.182)/(-19.74) ). Let me compute the magnitude: (approx) sqrt( (19.74)^2 + (7.182)^2 )= sqrt( approx 390 + 51.6 )= sqrt(441.6)= approx 21. So the magnitude is 21, which makes sense because B is given as 21 times that. So the angle: both components are negative, so it's in the third quadrant. The reference angle would be arctan(7.182/19.74)= arctan(0.364)≈20 degrees. So the angle is 180+20=200 degrees. Wait, but the given angle when using the conjugate form might be different. Alternatively, perhaps I should represent B in polar form correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Euler's formula. Since B is 21 (cos160 - j sin160), which can be written as 21 e^{-j160°}, because cosθ - j sinθ = e^{-jθ}. So B = 21 e^{-j160°} =21 ∠ -160°. So B is a phasor with magnitude 21 and angle -160 degrees.

So now, the problem is to compute A²¹7 minus B²¹7. Wait, but A and B are already given as A^217 and B^217? Wait, no, the question says A^217 = 30∠60°, and B^217=21∠-160°. Hmm, no, wait, the question is to find A^217 - B^217. So perhaps that's a typo in the question. Wait, the question says "Find A^217 - B^217 for the phasors A^217 = 30∠60°, B^217 = 21 (cos160° - j sin160°)." Oh, wait, so A^217 is 30∠60°, and B^217 is 21∠-160°, as we determined. So we need to compute A²¹7 - B²¹7, which are the 217th powers of A and B, respectively. Wait, but wait, no. Because A is given as A^217 = 30∠60°, so A is actually the 217th root of that value. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again. The problem says, "Find A^217 - B^217 for the phasors A^217 = 30∠60°, B^217 = 21 (cos 160° - j sin 160°)." Oh wait, so perhaps that's a typo in the question. Because if A^217 is 30∠60°, then A would be the 217th root of that phasor. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking to compute A - B, where A is 30∠60°, and B is 21∠-160°, but raised to the 217th power? That can't be right, because 217 is a high exponent. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that A and B are the phasors, and we're to compute A^217 - B^217, but that would involve taking each to the 217th power.

Wait, perhaps the notation is that A^217 represents a phasor, so the problem is to compute A^217 - B^217, where A is 30∠60°, and B is 21∠-160°, but each raised to the 217th power. That would be the case. So we need to compute A^217 and B^217, then subtract them.

Wait, but then why are A and B given as A^217 and B^217? That would mean that the problem is to compute A^217 - B^217, but A and B are given as their 217th powers. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute A - B, where A is 30∠60°, and B is 21∠160°, but in a certain form. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify the problem statement.

The question is: Find A^217 - B^217 for the phasors A^217 = 30∠60°, B^217 = 21 (cos160° - j sin160°).

Wait, so A^217 is 30∠60°, and B^217 is 21∠-160°, as we determined earlier. So to find A^217 - B^217, which is 30∠60° - 21∠-160°.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is phrased as "find A^217 - B^217 for the phasors A^217 = ... and B^217 = ...". So perhaps the question is just to compute 30∠60° minus 21∠-160°, which is A^217 minus B^217. But then why the exponent 217? It's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is the angle in degrees, not the power. So A is a phasor with magnitude 30 and angle 60 degrees, and similarly for B. Then, the question is to compute A²¹7 minus B²¹7. Wait, but that notation is unclear. Maybe the exponent is the angle, so A has magnitude 30 and angle 217 degrees? No, the question says A^217, which is 30∠60°, so perhaps it's more like A raised to the 217th power. But that would require knowing A, which is the base. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that A and B are given as their 217th powers, and we're to compute their difference. So we have A^217 = 30∠60°, and B^217 =21∠-160°, and we need to compute A^217 - B^217. So the answer is simply 30∠60° minus 21∠-160°. But then the options are all in the form of magnitude and angle, so perhaps we can compute this subtraction.

So, to compute 30∠60° - 21∠-160°, I need to convert both to rectangular form, subtract, and then convert back to polar form.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, convert A^217 (30∠60°) to rectangular form.

A_rect = 30 * cos60° + j * 30 * sin60°
cos60 = 0.5, sin60 ≈ 0.8660
So A_rect = 30*(0.5) + j*30*(0.866) = 15 + j25.98 ≈ 15 + j25.98

Next, convert B^217 (21∠-160°) to rectangular form.

B_rect = 21 * cos(-160°) + j *21 * sin(-160°)
cos(-160) = cos160 = -cos20 ≈ -0.9397
sin(-160) = -sin160 ≈ -0.3420
So B_rect = 21*(-0.9397) + j*21*(-0.3420)
= -19.7437 - j7.182

Now, subtract B_rect from A_rect: A_rect - B_rect = (15 - (-19.7437)) + j*(25.98 - (-7.182))

Compute real part: 15 +19.7437 =34.7437
Imaginary part:25.98 +7.182=33.162

So the result is 34.7437 + j33.162

Now, convert this back to polar form: magnitude and angle.

Magnitude = sqrt( (34.7437)^2 + (33.162)^2 )
Let me compute:
34.7437^2 = approx (34.74)^2 = (34)^2 + 2*34*0.74 + (0.74)^2 = 1156 + 50.08 + 0.5476≈ 1206.6276
33.162^2 = (33)^2 + 2*33*0.162 + (0.162)^2= 1089 + 10.692 + 0.026≈ 1099.718

So sum is 1206.6276 + 1099.718 ≈ 2306.3456
Magnitude = sqrt(2306.3456) ≈ 48.04 (since 48^2=2304, which is very close)

Angle: arctangent of (33.162 /34.7437) = arctan(approx 0.954)
What's arctan(0.954)? Let's see, tan43 degrees is about 0.9325, tan44 is about 0.9657. So 0.954 is between 43 and 44 degrees. Let me compute more accurately.

Using a calculator, arctan(33.162/34.7437)= arctan(0.954)≈43.6 degrees.

So the result is approximately 48.04 ∠43.6°, which looks like option G:48∠43.6 degrees, but let me check the options.

Looking back at the options: option G is 48∠43.6 degrees. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. Because the problem is A^217 minus B^217, which is 30∠60 - 21∠-160.

Wait, I think I did it correctly. Let me double-check the rectangular conversions:

A_rect: 15 + j25.98
B_rect: -19.7437 -j7.182
Subtracting B_rect is same as adding (19.7437 +j7.182) to A_rect.

So 15 +19.7437=34.7437, 25.98+7.182=33.162. So yes, correct.

Then magnitude squared: (34.7437)^2 = let me compute precisely. 34.7437 * 34.7437.

34 *34 = 1156
34 *0.7437 = approx 25.2458
0.7437 *34= same 25.2458
0.7437^2≈0.5533

Wait, maybe a better approach: 34.7437 =34 + 0.7437

So (34 + 0.7437)^2 =34² + 2*34*0.7437 +0.7437² = 1156 + 50.449 + 0.5533≈ 1156+50.449=1206.449 +0.5533=1206.999≈1207.

Similarly, 33.162^2: 33^2=1089, 0.162^2≈0.026, cross term 2*33*0.162=10.692. So 1089+10.692=1099.692 +0.026=1099.718.

So 1207 + 1099.718=2306.718. Sqrt(2306.718)=48.04 approx.

Angle: 33.162 /34.7437= approx 0.954. Let me compute arctan(0.954). Let me see: 43 degrees is tan(43)=0.9325, 44 degrees is 0.9657. So 0.954 is 0.954-0.9325=0.0215 above 43 degrees. The difference between 43 and 44 is about 1 degree, which is 0.0332 in tan. So 0.0215/0.0332≈0.647 of a degree, so approximately 43.647 degrees, which is about 43.6 degrees.

So the magnitude is 48.04, which is approximately 48, and angle 43.6 degrees. So the correct option is G:48∠43.6 degrees.

To solve the problem, we need to compute \( A^{217} - B^{217} \), where \( A^{217} = 30 \angle 60^\circ \) and \( B^{217} = 21 (\cos 160^\circ - j \sin 160^\circ) \). 

### Step 1: Interpret \( B^{217} \)
The phasor \( B^{217} \) is given as \( 21 (\cos 160^\circ - j \sin 160^\circ) \). This is equivalent to \( 21 \angle -160^\circ \) because \( \cos \theta - j \sin \theta = \cos(-\theta) + j \sin(-\theta) \), which corresponds to \( e^{-j\theta} \).

### Step 2: Convert \( A^{217} \) and \( B^{217} \) to rectangular form
1. **For \( A^{217} = 30 \angle 60^\circ \):**
   \[
   A_{\text{rect}} = 30 \cos 60^\circ + j \cdot 30 \sin 60^\circ
   \]
   Using \( \cos 60^\circ = 0.5 \) and \( \sin 60^\circ \approx 0.866 \):
   \[
   A_{\text{rect}} = 30 \cdot 0.5 + j \cdot 30 \cdot 0.866 = 15 + j 25.98
   \]

2. **For \( B^{217} = 21 \angle -160^\circ \):**
   \[
   B_{\text{rect}} = 21 \cos(-160^\circ) + j \cdot 21 \sin(-160^\circ)
   \]
   Using \( \cos(-160^\circ) = \cos(160^\circ) \approx -0.9397 \) and \( \sin(-160^\circ) = -\sin(160^\circ) \approx -0.3420 \):
   \[
   B_{\text{rect}} = 21 \cdot (-0.9397) + j \cdot 21 \cdot (-0.3420) = -19.74 - j 7.182
   \]

### Step 3: Subtract \( B^{217} \) from \( A^{217} \)
\[
A_{\text{rect}} - B_{\text{rect}} = (15 - (-19.74)) + j \cdot (25.98 - (-7.182))
\]
\[
A_{\text{rect}} - B_{\text{rect}} = 34.74 + j \cdot
