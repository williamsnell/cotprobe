Question:

A defendant was suspected of having burglarized his neighbor's apartment. The neighbor reported that his apartment had been ransacked and several items of clothing had been stolen. During the course of their investigation, two police detectives went to the defendant's place of work to interview him. After being advised of his Miranda rights, the defendant requested permission to call his attorney. Although his attorney was unavailable, the attorney's receptionist admonished him not to say anything. The defendant told the detectives he would have nothing further to say unless his attorney was present. The detectives then asked him if he would accompany them to the police station to answer some questions about an unrelated robbery. The defendant agreed. As they were driving to the police station, the defendant was asked where he had purchased the boots that he was wearing. He refused to answer. When they arrived at the police station, the detectives requested that he sign a waiver of his right to counsel. The defendant replied that he would not sign anything in the absence of his attorney. He was then placed in an interrogation room. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was told he could leave if he would be willing to say where he had purchased his boots. The defendant admitted that he had bought the boots and some shirts from a friend. From this information, the detectives obtained a search warrant and went to the defendant's home where they found the stolen clothing. The defendant is charged with burglarizing the apartment. At trial, the court should

Options:

A: admit the confession because it was voluntary, and the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
B: suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing because the search warrant was secured as a result of the confession.
C: suppress both the confession and the clothing because the defendant's right to counsel was violated.
D: admit the confession because the defendant voluntarily accompanied the detectives, but suppress the clothing because the search warrant was based on the confession.
E: suppress the confession because the defendant failed to sign the waiver, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
F: admit the confession because the defendant was not under arrest when he made it, and the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
G: admit the confession because the question about the boots was about an unrelated robbery, but suppress the clothing because the search warrant was based on the confession.
H: suppress the confession because the defendant's attorney was not present, and the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
I: suppress the confession because the detectives continued questioning after the defendant invoked his right to counsel, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
J: suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Miranda rights and confession question. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the defendant was suspected of burglary. The police went to his workplace, read him his Miranda rights, and he asked to call his attorney. The attorney wasn't available, but the receptionist told him not to say anything. So he told the detectives he wouldn't talk without his attorney. Then they asked him to go to the police station for an unrelated robbery, and he agreed.

On the way, they asked about his boots, and he refused to answer. At the station, they asked him to sign a waiver of his right to counsel, which he refused. Then they put him in an interrogation room. Later, they told him he could leave if he told where he got the boots. He admitted buying boots and shirts from a friend, which led to a search warrant and finding stolen clothes. Now he's charged with burglary.

So the question is about whether the confession and the clothing should be admitted at trial.

I remember that under Miranda v. Arizona, once a suspect invokes their right to counsel, police must stop questioning. They can't reinitiate until the suspect's attorney is present or the suspect himself reinitiates contact. Also, this applies to the specific offense. But wait, here the initial questioning was about an unrelated robbery. Hmm.

Wait, when he was at work, he invoked his right to counsel, so the detectives should have stopped questioning about anything. But then they asked him to go to the station about an unrelated robbery. So he agreed to go. On the way, they asked about the boots. He was under arrest? Or just accompanying them voluntarily?

I think if he's not under arrest, the Miranda warnings don't necessarily apply unless it's a custodial situation. Wait, when they took him to the police station, was he in custody? Because being driven to the station in a police car might make it custodial.

But let's think about the Fifth Amendment right. Once he invoked his right to remain silent and have an attorney present, any subsequent questioning without the attorney present would be a violation unless he reinitiates.

Wait, but in this case, after he invoked, the police asked him about an unrelated robbery. So maybe they can question him about a different offense, but I'm not sure. Or does the invocation of Miranda apply to all topics, not just the specific offense?

I think the right to counsel under Miranda is offense-specific. So if he's being questioned about a different crime, maybe the police can question him if he hasn't invoked his right regarding that specific offense. Hmm, but that's not entirely clear. I might be mixing it up with the Sixth Amendment, which is more offense-specific.

Wait, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches once charges are pending, but the Fifth Amendment Miranda rights are about custodial interrogation. So in this case, the initial Miranda invocation was about any questioning, regardless of the topic.

So when the police asked him about the boots on the way to the station, that's custodial interrogation without his attorney, which would be a Miranda violation. So any statements made then would be inadmissible.

Then, at the station, they again asked him to sign a waiver, which he refused. Then later, they offered to let him leave if he told them about the boots. He confessed. So that's after being in custody, and his prior invocation of Miranda was still in effect because he didn't retract it.

So the confession was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights because the police continued questioning after he invoked his right to counsel. Therefore, the confession should be suppressed.

But then the clothing was found because of the confession, which was obtained unlawfully. So under the exclusionary rule, the evidence derived from an unlawful confession (the fruit of the poisonous tree) should also be suppressed. So both the confession and the clothing should be excluded.

Looking at the options:

Option B says suppress the confession because of Fifth Amendment violation and the clothing because the warrant was based on the confession. That seems right.

Option C says suppress both because right to counsel was violated. Wait, but is it Fifth Amendment or Sixth? The right to counsel in Miranda is Fifth Amendment. But if the police violated Miranda by continuing to question after invocation, then the confession is out, and so is the evidence.

So the answer would be B. Alternatively, option I says suppress confession because they continued after invocation, and admit clothing because warrant was valid. Wait, but the warrant was based on the confession. So if the confession is suppressed, the warrant evidence is too.

So I think option B is correct.
</think>

The defendant invoked his Miranda rights when he requested counsel and stated he would not speak further without his attorney. Under Miranda v. Arizona, once a suspect invokes their right to counsel, police must cease questioning and cannot reinitiate interrogation unless the suspect's attorney is present or the suspect himself reinitiates contact. In this case, the police continued questioning the defendant about the boots while he was in custody, which constitutes custodial interrogation. This violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment right to counsel.

Furthermore, the defendant's confession about purchasing the boots and shirts was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. The search warrant and subsequent discovery of stolen clothing were direct results of this unlawful confession. Under the exclusionary rule, evidence derived from an unlawful confession (the "fruit of the poisonous tree") is also inadmissible.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that the confession should be suppressed due to a Fifth Amendment violation and that the clothing should also be suppressed because the search warrant was based on the unlawful confession.
- Other options either mischaracterize the legal basis for suppression or incorrectly admit evidence that should be excluded.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing because the search warrant was secured as a result of the confession.**
