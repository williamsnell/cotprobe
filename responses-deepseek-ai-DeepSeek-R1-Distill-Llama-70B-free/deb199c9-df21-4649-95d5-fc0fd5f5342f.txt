Question:

Distinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes.

Options:

A: Structural proteins provide temporary cellular functions, while functional proteins provide permanent structure to cells
B: Structural proteins control cell activity while functional proteins are part of the cell protoplasm
C: Structural proteins catalyze chemical reactions while functional proteins are involved in the structure of the cell
D: Structural proteins are soluble in the cell while functional proteins are generally insoluble
E: Structural proteins are found only outside the cell, while functional proteins are exclusively found inside the cell
F: Structural proteins are only used for muscle contraction, while functional proteins are responsible for energy production
G: Structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to cell and body growth, while functional proteins control cell activity such as hormone production or nutrient metabolism.
H: Structural proteins are unable to catalyze any reactions, while functional proteins form the structural components of ribosomes
I: Structural proteins are synthesized from amino acids in the cytoplasm, while functional proteins are synthesized in the nucleus
J: Structural proteins are produced by free ribosomes, while functional proteins are produced by membrane-bound ribosomes

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about proteins produced by ribosomes. Hmm, I remember that proteins are a big deal in biology, right? They do all sorts of jobs in the cell. The question is asking about two types of proteins made by ribosomes. I think I learned that there are structural proteins and functional proteins.

Wait, what's the difference between them again? Structural proteins are probably the ones that give structure to the cell. Like, they make up parts of the cell's framework, maybe things like the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix. So they help the cell maintain its shape and structure.

Functional proteins, on the other hand, I think are involved in doing specific jobs. Like enzymes, which catalyze reactions. Or maybe hormones, which send signals. So they're more about what the cell does rather than its structure.

Now, looking at the options. Let's go one by one.

Option A: Structural provide temporary functions, functional provide permanent structure. That doesn't sound right. I thought it's the other way around. Structural gives structure, which is more permanent, while functional do functions, which might be temporary actions.

Option B: Structural control cell activity, functional are part of protoplasm. Not sure. I thought functional proteins are the ones controlling activity, like enzymes controlling reactions. So this seems reversed. Maybe B is wrong.

Option C: Structural catalyze reactions, functional are structural. No, that's opposite. Enzymes are functional proteins, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Structural soluble, functional insoluble. I'm not too sure. Maybe structural proteins like keratin are insoluble, but I'm not certain. This might not be the right distinction.

Option E: Structural only outside, functional only inside. I think some structural proteins are inside, like actin. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Structural only for muscles, functional for energy. That's too narrow. Structural proteins are more than just muscles. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Structural part of protoplasm, contribute to growth. Functional control activity like hormones. Wait, structural proteins being part of the cell's structure, which includes protoplasm, makes sense. And functional proteins controlling activities like hormone production or metabolism sounds right. This looks promising.

Option H: Structural can't catalyze, functional form ribosomes. Wait, ribosomes are made of rRNA and proteins. So maybe the proteins in ribosomes are structural? Or are they functional? I'm not sure. Also, functional proteins can't form structures, usually. So H might be wrong.

Option I: Structural made in cytoplasm, functional in nucleus. No, proteins are made in ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The nucleus is for DNA, not protein synthesis. So I is wrong.

Option J: Structural by free ribosomes, functional by membrane-bound. Wait, I remember that proteins destined for secretion or membranes are made by ribosomes attached to the ER (rough ER), which have membranes. Free ribosomes make proteins that stay in the cell, like structural proteins. So J says structural are made by free, which aligns. But wait, do all functional proteins go through membrane-bound ribosomes? Not sure. Maybe some are for inside the cell, like enzymes. Hmm.

Wait, the initial question is about types of proteins, not where they're made. So the question is about their function, not their origin. So the main distinction is between structure and function.

So back to option G. It says structural proteins are part of the protoplasm and contribute to cell growth. Functional proteins control cell activity like hormone production or metabolism. That seems correct because structural proteins help build the cell, while functional ones do the work.

Wait, but another thing I remember is that some proteins have both structural and functional roles. Like actin filaments are structural but can also be involved in cell movement, which is functional. But in terms of categorization, the main types are structural (like keratin, collagen) and functional (like enzymes, hormones).

Looking at the options again, option G seems to correctly separate them. Structural proteins as part of the cell structure, contributing to growth, and functional proteins controlling activities.

So I think G is the correct answer.

To distinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes, it is important to understand their roles. Structural proteins provide the framework and maintain the shape of cells, contributing to growth and stability. Examples include keratin and collagen. Functional proteins, on the other hand, are responsible for specific cellular activities such as catalyzing reactions (e.g., enzymes), hormone production, and nutrient metabolism.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** incorrectly states that structural proteins provide temporary functions and functional proteins provide permanent structure, which is the opposite of their actual roles.
- **Option B** claims structural proteins control cell activity and functional proteins are part of protoplasm, which is inaccurate since functional proteins are the ones that typically control activity.
- **Option C** reverses the roles, stating structural proteins catalyze reactions and functional proteins are structural, which is incorrect.
- **Option D** suggests structural proteins are soluble and functional proteins are insoluble, but this is not a reliable distinction.
- **Option E** limits structural proteins to being outside the cell and functional proteins to being inside, which is too restrictive.
- **Option F** narrows structural proteins to muscle contraction and functional proteins to energy production, which is overly specific.
- **Option G** correctly identifies structural proteins as part of the cell protoplasm, contributing to growth, and functional proteins as controlling cell activity, such as hormone production or metabolism.
- **Option H** incorrectly states that structural proteins cannot catalyze reactions and functional proteins form ribosomes, which is misleading.
- **Option I** incorrectly claims structural proteins are made in the cytoplasm and functional proteins in the nucleus, which is not true since all proteins are made by ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
- **Option J** attempts to distinguish based on the type of ribosome (free vs. membrane-bound), but this relates to protein destination, not the functional distinction between structural and functional proteins.

The correct answer is **Option G**, as it accurately describes the roles of structural and functional proteins.
