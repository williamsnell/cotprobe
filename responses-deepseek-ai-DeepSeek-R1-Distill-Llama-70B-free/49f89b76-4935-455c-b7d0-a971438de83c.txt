Question:

A plaintiff filed a civil action asking for damages resulting from a tortious assault that the defendant inflicted on him. During trial, plaintiff's counsel asked an opposing witness on cross examination: "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" Defense counsel objected to the question. How will the court rule on the objection?

Options:

A: The objection will be sustained because the question is misleading.
B: The objection will be overruled because the question is relevant to the case.
C: The objection will be overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross examination.
D: The objection will be sustained because the question is argumentative.
E: The objection will be overruled because the question is not leading or misleading.
F: The objection will be sustained because the question is irrelevant.
G: The objection will be overruled because leading questions are permitted in this context.
H: The objection will be sustained because the question assumes facts not in evidence.
I: The objection will be sustained because the question is leading.
J: The objection will be overruled because the question is within the allowable scope of cross examination.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about cross-examination. Let's see. The scenario is a civil trial where the plaintiff is suing for damages from a tortious assault. During cross-examination, plaintiff's counsel asks the opposing witness, "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" Defense counsel objects. The question is, how will the court rule on this objection?

Hmm. I remember that in cross-examination, the rules for questioning are a bit different than direct. On cross, leading questions are generally allowed because the opposing counsel gets to ask the questions. So if the question is leading, that's usually okay.

Wait, but the question here is, "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" Is that a leading question? Well, it's phrased in a way that suggests maybe someone did try to leave, but it's not necessarily leading. Or maybe it is. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound question or assumes facts not in evidence.

Wait, the assault happened, right? Because the plaintiff is suing for it. So the fact that an assault occurred is established. So the question is about the events during the assault. So the question is about whether anyone tried to leave during that time. That seems relevant to perhaps the issue of self-defense or the nature of the assault.

But why would defense counsel object? Maybe they think the question is leading. Or maybe it's irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe it's assuming a fact not in evidence.

Wait, no, the assault is the basis of the case, so it's already in evidence that an assault occurred. So the question about whether anyone tried to leave during it is relevant because it might relate to the circumstances of the assault—like maybe if someone was trying to leave, it could show that the defendant was trying to prevent them, which could be relevant to the tort claim.

So the possible objections: the defense might say it's leading, but on cross, leading is allowed. So if that's the objection, the court would overrule it. Alternatively, maybe the question is irrelevant, but I think it's relevant because it's about the events of the assault.

Wait, could the question be considered compound? Let me read it again: "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" That's a single question, not compound. So that's probably not the issue.

Another possibility: the question assumes that someone was present who could attempt to leave. But the plaintiff is the one who was assaulted. Wait, the opposing witness—so maybe a third party? Or the defendant? Hmm, not sure about that. But the question is about "anyone," which is a bit broad.

Wait, perhaps the question is leading because it's phrased in a way that suggests someone did try to leave, but that's not necessarily the case. But in cross-examination, leading questions are allowed, so the objection on that ground wouldn't hold.

So looking at the options, the possible answers are about whether the objection is sustained or overruled. The options are A to J.

Option C says the objection will be overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross. Option G says the same thing, but G says "permitted in this context." So both C and G suggest leading is okay.

Wait, but the question might not even be leading. It's a yes/no question about whether anyone tried to leave. So maybe the defense's objection isn't on leading grounds. Maybe it's on relevance or another basis.

Alternatively, the question could be seen as argumentative. But I don't think so. It's a factual question.

Another angle: the question might assume that there was more than one person involved, but the assault could have been between just the plaintiff and defendant. So if the question is "did anyone attempt to leave," perhaps it's assuming the presence of others, which hasn't been established. So that could be a problem—assuming facts not in evidence. That would make the question improper.

Wait, but the plaintiff is suing for the assault, so the participants are the plaintiff and defendant. So the witness is the opposing witness, perhaps the defendant or another witness. If the witness is the defendant, then "anyone" would include themselves. But if the witness is someone else, maybe a bystander, then the question might imply others were present when perhaps they weren't.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether the plaintiff tried to leave, which could relate to the issue of self-defense or the reasonableness of the plaintiff's actions. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but in any case, if the question is about an event during the assault, and the assault is proven, then the question is relevant. Unless the question is irrelevant because it doesn't relate to any issue in the case. But I think it's relevant because it could speak to the nature of the assault.

So maybe the objection isn't on relevance but on another ground. If the question is leading, but cross-examination allows leading, so the objection would be overruled.

Looking at the options, option C says the objection is overruled because leading is allowed. Option B says it's overruled because it's relevant. Option J says it's overruled because within the scope. Option G is similar to C.

Wait, the question is about the form of the question. So if the objection is because it's leading, the court would overrule it because leading is allowed on cross. So the answer would be C or G.

Alternatively, if the objection is on relevance, the court would overrule it because it's relevant, making B or J correct.

But the question is whether the court will sustain or overrule the objection. The options are about the reasoning.

If the objection is about the question being leading, the court would overrule it. So if the defense objected on that ground, the court says it's okay because cross allows leading.

But wait, the question isn't necessarily leading. It's a yes/no question. But in cross, you can ask leading questions to challenge the witness's testimony.

Alternatively, maybe the question is improper because it's asking about someone else's actions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the actions of the plaintiff. If the plaintiff is the one who might have tried to leave, then it's relevant to their actions during the assault. So if the witness is the defendant, they could testify about the plaintiff's actions.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option says.

Option B: overruled because relevant. It is relevant, so the objection on relevance would be overruled.

Option C: overruled because leading allowed. If the objection is on leading, it's overruled.

Option H: sustained because assumes facts not in evidence. For example, that someone else was present.

But I'm not certain. If the question assumes that others were present, that could be a problem.

Wait, the assault is between plaintiff and defendant. If the witness is the defendant, then the question is about whether anyone (including the plaintiff) tried to leave. Since the plaintiff is the one assaulted, it's possible that they tried to leave. So the question is about the plaintiff's actions, which the defendant would know about.

So the question doesn't assume any other people were present. It's just asking if anyone, including the plaintiff, tried to leave.

So I think the question is proper because it's relevant and the form is acceptable on cross.

So the objection would be overruled. Now, the possible reasons for overruling: relevance, leading allowed, or within scope.

Looking at the options, B says overruled because relevant. C says because leading allowed. G says permitted in context (leading). J says within scope.

The question is about the events of the assault, so it's within the scope of cross. But cross-examination is generally limited to the subject matter of direct. But in this case, since the assault is the main issue, the question is relevant.

Alternatively, the question is about whether anyone tried to leave, which could relate to the force used or the nature of the assault, making it relevant.

So the main issue is whether the question is proper. If the defense objected on the basis of being leading, the court would overrule, as leading is allowed. So the answer would be C or G.

But another possibility is that the question is not leading, so the objection on leading would be sustained? No, because on cross, leading is allowed, so the objection would be overruled regardless.

Wait, but maybe the question isn't leading. A leading question is one that suggests the answer. For example, "Didn't you assault the plaintiff?" is leading because it suggests yes. But "Did anyone attempt to leave?" is more neutral. So perhaps the question isn't leading at all. In that case, an objection on leading would be incorrect, and the court would overrule it because the question is not leading. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, option E says overruled because the question is not leading or misleading. But that's not the case because the question is being objected to on some ground. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is compound. Let me read it again: "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" No, it's a single question. So that's not it.

Another thought: perhaps the question is irrelevant. But I think it's relevant because it's about the events during the assault, which is the subject of the litigation.

So if the defense's objection is on relevance, the court would overrule because it's relevant. That would make option B correct.

But if the defense objected on the basis of leading, the court would overrule because leading is allowed on cross. So the answer would be C or G.

But the question is, which is the correct ruling?

The question is, the plaintiff's counsel is asking the opposing witness on cross. So leading is allowed, so if the question is leading, the objection is overruled.

But is the question leading? It could be. It's phrased as a yes/no question, but it doesn't necessarily suggest an answer. So maybe it's not leading, but in cross, even if it's leading, it's allowed.

Wait, but if the question is not leading, then the objection on leading is overruled, but the real issue is whether the question is relevant.

I think the key here is that on cross-examination, leading questions are permitted, so the court would overrule an objection based on the question being leading. So the correct answer would be either C or G.

Looking at the options, C says "overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross examination," and G says "overruled because leading questions are permitted in this context."

So both C and G seem correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but maybe the question is not leading. If the question isn't leading, then the objection on leading is without merit, so the court would overrule. But the options don't have an option that says the question isn't leading, except E, which says "overruled because the question is not leading or misleading." But if the question is relevant, then that's another reason.

But the objection could be on any ground. The options don't specify the ground, just the outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is relevant, so the objection on relevance would be overruled. So the answer would be B.

I'm a bit torn here. On one hand, the question is about events during the assault, which is relevant. On the other hand, if the form is leading, it's allowed on cross.

In multiple-choice questions like this, often the issue is about the form of the question. So if the objection is about the question being leading, the court would overrule it, making the answer C or G.

But perhaps the more accurate answer is that the question is relevant, so the objection is overruled on relevance grounds. So the answer is B.

Wait, but the question is phrased as a leading question. So the objection is probably on that ground, making C or G correct.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: in the absence of any other issues, the question is relevant, so the objection would be overruled on relevance grounds. So the answer would be B or J.

Wait, option J says "overruled because within the allowable scope of cross examination." The allowable scope is usually based on the direct testimony but in this case, since it's about the assault, which is the main issue, the question is within the scope.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. I think I need to make a decision.

I think the key point is that leading questions are allowed on cross, so if the objection is on that basis, it's overruled. So the answer is C or G.

Between C and G, both say leading is allowed. Option C says "allowed on cross," G says "permitted in this context."

I think the answer is C: overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross.

Wait, but the question may not be leading. So perhaps the objection is on another ground, like relevance.

Alternatively, maybe the question is improper because it's calling for a conclusion, but that's not the case here.

I think I'll go with the answer that the objection is overruled because the question is relevant, making the answer B. Or perhaps because leading is allowed, making it C.

Wait, the correct answer is that leading questions are allowed on cross, so the objection is overruled on that ground. So the answer is C or G.

Looking again, the options are:

C: overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross.

G: overruled because leading questions are permitted in this context.

They both seem to express the same idea, but perhaps C is the better answer.

Alternatively, the question is within the scope, making J the answer.

Wait, the question is about the assault, which is the subject matter of the case, so it's within the scope of cross. So J could be correct.

But I'm more confident that the key point is leading questions on cross.

So I think the answer is C: The objection will be overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross examination.

The question revolves around a civil trial where the plaintiff is suing for damages resulting from a tortious assault. During cross-examination, the plaintiff's counsel asks the opposing witness, "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" Defense counsel objects, and the task is to determine how the court will rule on the objection.

Key considerations include:

1. **Relevance**: The question pertains to the events of the assault, which is the central issue of the case. Therefore, the question is relevant and not objectionable on that ground.

2. **Leading Questions on Cross-Examination**: On cross-examination, leading questions are generally permitted. A leading question is one that suggests a specific answer, but in this case, the question is phrased neutrally as a yes/no inquiry. However, even if the question were leading, it would still be allowable in this context.

3. **Scope of Cross-Examination**: The question is within the allowable scope of cross-examination because it relates directly to the events of the assault, which is the subject of the litigation.

4. **Other Potential Objections**: The question is not compound, argumentative, or misleading. It does not assume facts not in evidence, as the assault is already established.

Given these considerations, the most likely ground for overruling the objection is that leading questions are permitted on cross-examination. Therefore, the court would overrule the objection on this basis.
