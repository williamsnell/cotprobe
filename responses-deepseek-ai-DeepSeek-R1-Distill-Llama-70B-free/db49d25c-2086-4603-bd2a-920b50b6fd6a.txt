Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of special relativity concepts. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: At what velocity is the mass of a particle twice its rest mass? The options are A through J with various velocities given. I remember that in special relativity, the mass increases as the velocity approaches the speed of light. The formula for relativistic mass is m = gamma * m0, where m0 is the rest mass and gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So, the problem states that the mass is twice the rest mass, which means m = 2m0. Therefore, gamma must be 2 because 2m0 = gamma * m0 => gamma = 2.

Now, I recall that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if gamma is 2, I can set up the equation 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me write that down more clearly:

2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

I need to solve for v. Let me rearrange this equation. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:

1/2 = sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Then, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(1/2)² = 1 - v²/c²

Which simplifies to:

1/4 = 1 - v²/c²

Subtracting 1/4 from both sides gives:

1 - 1/4 = v²/c²

So, 3/4 = v²/c²

Taking the square root of both sides:

v = sqrt(3/4) * c

Since sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So v = 0.866 * c.

I remember that the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3.0 x 10^10 cm/s. Wait, no, wait! Oh wait, no, I think I might be mixing units here. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. The speed of light is about 3.0 x 10^8 meters per second, but the question gives the options in cm/s. So 3.0 x 10^8 m/s is 3.0 x 10^10 cm/s because there are 100 cm in a meter. So 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So, c is 3.0e10 cm/s. Then v = 0.866 * 3.0e10 cm/s. Let me calculate that.

0.866 times 3 is approximately 2.598, so 2.598e10 cm/s. Looking at the options, let's see which one is closest to that value.

Looking at the options:

J is 2.664e10 cm/s.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculation. Oh wait, 0.866 times 3e10 is 2.598e10, which is approximately 2.6e10. Hmm, but none of the options exactly say that. Let me look at the options again.

Option J is 2.664e10 cm/s. That's higher than 2.6e10. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate sqrt(3/4). sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 1.732/2 is 0.866, correct. So 0.866 *3e10 cm/s is 2.598e10 cm/s. So approximately 2.6e10 cm/s.

But looking at the options, the closest one is option J:2.664e10. Wait, that's 2.664, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the options again. The given options are:

A:3.2e10

B:3.0e10

C:2.8e10

D:2.4e10

E:1.8e10

F:2.0e10

G:1.2e10

H:1.5e10

I:1.0e10

J:2.664e10

Hmm. So my calculated v is approximately 2.598e10 cm/s, which is very close to 2.6e10. The closest option would be J, which is 2.664e10, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 0.866 *3e10.

0.866 *3 = 2.598, so 2.598e10 cm/s.

But none of the options exactly match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: Did I mix up the units? Because in the options, some are 10^10 cm/s, which is 1e10 cm/s = 1e8 m/s, since 1 m is 100 cm. So 3e10 cm/s is 3e8 m/s, which is correct for the speed of light.

So my calculation of v=0.866*c gives 2.598e10 cm/s. Looking at the options, the closest is option J:2.664e10 cm/s. But wait, 2.664 is higher than 2.598. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it with more precise decimal places. Let me compute sqrt(3) more accurately. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so 1.73205/2 is 0.866025. So 0.866025 *3e10 = 2.598075e10 cm/s.

Hmm, that's about 2.598e10 cm/s. Now, let me look at the options again. Option J is 2.664e10. That's 2.664, which is significantly higher. So why is there no option around 2.6e10?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma setup. Let me think again. The question says the mass is twice the rest mass, so m = 2m0, so gamma is 2. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, solving again:

gamma = 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/2

Squaring both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/4

So, v²/c² = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4

v = c * sqrt(3/4) = c * (sqrt(3)/2)

Yes, that's correct. So v ≈ 0.866 c.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly that. So perhaps the given options are approximations. Let me check each option's value when converted to fractions of c.

Let's compute each option as a fraction of c (3e10 cm/s) and see which is closest to 0.866.

Option J: 2.664e10 / 3e10 = 0.888. Hmm, that's 0.888c, which is a bit higher than 0.866c.

Wait, let me compute gamma for option J's velocity. Let me see if I can compute gamma for v=2.664e10 cm/s.

v =2.664e10 cm/s. c =3e10 cm/s.

v/c = 2.664 /3 ≈ 0.888.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.888)^2 )

0.888 squared is 0.789. So 1-0.789=0.211.

sqrt(0.211) is approximately 0.459. So gamma is 1/0.459 ≈ 2.18.

Hmm, gamma would be about 2.18, which is more than 2. So the mass would be 2.18 times rest mass, not exactly 2. So this can't be the correct option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me see if any other option gives gamma=2.

Wait, let me compute for other options. Let's take option C:2.8e10 cm/s.

v=2.8e10, c=3e10.

v/c=0.9333.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.9333)^2 )

(0.9333)^2 is around 0.870. 1-0.870=0.13. sqrt(0.13)= approx 0.3606. So gamma=1/0.3606≈2.77. That's higher than 2, so mass would be 2.77 m0, which is more than twice. So option C gives gamma~2.77.

Option J gives gamma ~2.18, as I calculated before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute which option gives gamma=2. Let me think.

We have v = c * sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

So looking for v ≈ 0.8660 *3e10 = 2.598e10 cm/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J (2.664e10), but that's 0.888c as I saw earlier, which gives a gamma of ~2.18.

Hmm, but maybe the correct answer isn't among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recalculate v:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ?

Wait no, wait: from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), squaring both sides: gamma² = 1/(1 - v²/c²)

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma²

So, v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

Ah, maybe that's a better way to compute it, to avoid confusion.

Given gamma=2:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2^2)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866c.

So yes, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, but I have to choose the closest one, which is J:2.664e10 cm/s.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 2.598e10 cm/s. So 2.598e10 is 2.598 x10^10 cm/s. Among the options, the closest is J:2.664e10, which is 0.066 higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if any of the other options produce gamma=2.

Let me try option F:2.0e10 cm/s.

v=2e10, c=3e10 => v/c=0.6667.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (2/3)^2 )=1/sqrt(1-4/9)=1/sqrt(5/9)=1/(sqrt(5)/3)=3/sqrt(5)=3/2.236≈1.3416.

So gamma≈1.34, which is less than 2. So mass would be 1.34 m0, not 2.

Option D:2.4e10 cm/s.

v/c =2.4/3=0.8.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - 0.64)=1/sqrt(0.36)=1/0.6 ≈1.6667.

So gamma≈1.67 <2.

So that's not the answer.

Option C:2.8e10 cm/s.

v/c=0.9333.

gamma≈2.77 as before.

Option B:3e10 is c, which would make gamma infinite, which is impossible.

Option A:3.2e10 is higher than c, which isn't possible because nothing can reach or exceed c.

So the only option that gives gamma greater than 2 is option J (gamma≈2.18), but none give exactly gamma=2.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check my approach. Maybe the question uses a different approach, like using the relation between momentum and mass or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Wait, the speed of light is 3e8 m/s, which is 3e10 cm/s, correct.

Wait, could the question have meant twice the rest mass including the rest energy? No, no, relativistic mass is straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the question is referring to the total energy being twice the rest energy, which would be the same as gamma=2, so same result.

I'm a bit stuck because none of the options exactly match my calculated value. But perhaps option J is the intended correct answer, considering that 2.664e10 is close to 2.598e10.

Wait, let me compute 2.598e10. Let's see, 2.598 is approximately 2.6, and option J is 2.664, which is about 2.66. The difference is about 0.064e10 cm/s.

Is there any other option that I've missed? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise numbers.

Let me compute 0.8660254 *3e10.

0.8660254 *3 = 2.5980762, so 2.5980762e10 cm/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:2.664e10, but that's 0.0659e10 higher than 2.598e10.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, but I don't see where. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option J, considering rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a velocity where gamma is exactly 2, and see which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question expects using an approximation where sqrt(3) is taken as 1.732, giving v=0.866*3e10 =2.598e10, but none of the options match that exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the velocity to be 0.866c, but perhaps using a different value for c. Wait, no, the standard speed of light in cm/s is 3e10.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option J because it's the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is a trick, and the correct velocity is at 0.866c, which is approximately 2.598e10 cm/s, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should look for an option that when squared gives 3/4 c².

Wait, 3/4 c² is (0.866c)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute v^2 and see which option gives v^2 = 3/4 c².

c=3e10 cm/s, so c^2=9e20 cm²/s².

3/4 c² = (3/4)*9e20 = 6.75e20 cm²/s².

Now, compute v for each option and see which v^2 is closest to 6.75e20.

Option J: v=2.664e10 cm/s.

v²=(2.664e10)^2 = (2.664)^2 *1e20 =7.083 *1e20=7.083e20.

Which is higher than 6.75e20.

Hmm, so the correct v² is 6.75e20, but option J gives 7.08e20, which is higher.

Which option gives v²=6.75e20?

Let me compute v= sqrt(6.75e20) = sqrt(6.75)*1e10.

sqrt(6.25)=2.5, sqrt(6.76)=2.6, so sqrt(6.75)= approx 2.598e10 cm/s.

So that's the same as before. So none of the options have exactly that value.

But let me look at the other options:

Option C:2.8e10.

v²=(2.8e10)^2=7.84e20, which is higher than 6.75e20.

Option F:2e10.

v²=4e20 <6.75e20.

Option D:2.4e10.

v²=5.76e20 <6.75e20.

Option J:2.664e10 gives 7.08e20, which is higher.

Wait, so perhaps none of the options exactly match. But the problem must have a correct answer among the options, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question asks for twice the rest mass, so m=2m0, but maybe they're considering the rest mass as m0 and relativistic mass as m=gamma m0. So gamma=2.

Wait, perhaps the options are given in terms of beta (v/c), so beta= sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

Looking for an option where v=0.866c=2.598e10 cm/s.

Looking again at the options, the closest is option J:2.664e10. But that's 0.888c.

Wait, but perhaps the intended answer is option J, as it's the only one close to the calculated value.

Alternatively, maybe I should reevaluate the formula. Did I get the formula right?

Yes, relativistic mass m=gamma m0. Gamma=1/sqrt(1-v²/c²).

So, when m=2m0, gamma=2. So, 2=1/sqrt(1-v²/c²).

Yes, correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the use of classical mechanics, but that can't be because relativistic effects are needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c. But no, c is a constant.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should compute v in terms of the speed of light, and then match to the options.

v= sqrt(3)/2 * c =0.8660 *3e10 cm/s=2.598e10 cm/s.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but option J is 2.664e10 cm/s, which is 2.664/3=0.888 times c.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to approximate sqrt(3)/2 as 0.87, leading to v=0.87*3e10=2.61e10, which is still not an option. The closest is option J at 2.664e10.
