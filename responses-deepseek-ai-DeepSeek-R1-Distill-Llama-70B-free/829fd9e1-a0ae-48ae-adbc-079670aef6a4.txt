Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about systematic desensitization. Let's see, I remember that systematic desensitization is a behavioral therapy technique used to treat phobias and anxiety disorders. The idea is to gradually expose the client to the feared object or situation in a controlled way, starting from the least anxiety-provoking to the most.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT a step taken by a therapist using this method. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Having the client confront the actual feared object or situation. Wait, systematic desensitization often uses imagined exposure, not necessarily the real thing. Or does it? I'm a bit confused here. I think in some cases, like in vivo exposure, the real object is used, but in systematic desensitization, the initial steps might involve imagining. So maybe A is correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Instructing the client to picture each fearful image while maintaining a relaxed state. Yes, this sounds familiar. The therapist teaches relaxation techniques, and then the client imagines the feared situations while relaxed. So B is a step they take.

Option C: Constructing a hierarchy of feared images. Definitely part of the process. The client and therapist create a list from least to most feared. So C is a step.

Option D: Helping the client experience relaxation through hypnosis. Hmm, I don't think hypnosis is a standard part of systematic desensitization. The method typically involves training in progressive muscle relaxation or similar techniques. Hypnosis isn't something I remember being associated with this therapy. So D might be the exception.

Option E: Instructing the client to express their feelings about each feared image. I'm not sure. I think the focus is more on the physical relaxation response than on talking about feelings. Cognitive-behavioral therapies might include discussing feelings, but systematic desensitization is more about the behavioral aspect—reducing anxiety through relaxation. So E might not be a step, but I'm not certain.

Option F: Using exposure therapy to desensitize. Yes, systematic desensitization is a form of exposure therapy, just gradual. So F is a step.

Option G: Using guided imagery. Yes, because the client visualizes the feared situations. So G is part of it.

So the question is about which is NOT a step. Let's recap:

A: Confronting the actual object. I'm not sure. I think in systematic desensitization, it's more about imagining, but if the hierarchy includes actual exposure, maybe. Or perhaps in some cases, the later steps involve real exposure. Wait, I think systematic desensitization can sometimes involve in vivo exposure, but it's not always necessary. But the initial steps are about imagining. So maybe A is an actual step, making it not the exception.

D: Using hypnosis. I don't recall this being part of the standard method. So D might be the correct answer.

E: Expressing feelings. I think systematic desensitization doesn't focus on that. It's more about the physiological response. So E is not a step either.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT a step. So the options are D and E, perhaps.

Looking back, the steps in systematic desensitization are:

1. Train relaxation.
2. Create hierarchy.
3. Present items from hierarchy, starting low, while relaxed.

So steps include constructing hierarchy (C), using relaxation (B), guided imagery (G), exposure (F maybe), and possibly in vivo (A, if that's part of the hierarchy). But hypnosis isn't part of the standard approach. So D is the exception.

E says instructing to express feelings about each image. I don't think that's a step. They might report anxiety levels, but not necessarily express feelings. So E is also an exception.

Wait, the question says which is NOT a step. So if both D and E are not steps, but the options say "each of the following is a step except."

Looking at the options, the question gives options A to G, and the correct answer is the exception.

Wait, let me think. The steps in systematic desensitization are:

- Relaxation training.
- Hierarchy construction.
- Exposure to the hierarchy items, starting low, using imagery, while relaxed.
- Sometimes, in vivo exposure for higher items.

So A: confronting the actual object could be part of the later steps, but sometimes it's not necessary, but it's an option. So A could be a step.

D: Using hypnosis. No, that's not part of the standard procedure. So D is not a step.

E: Expressing feelings. Not a standard part. The focus is on anxiety reduction, not on discussing feelings. So E is also not a step.

So the options are D and E as the exceptions. But the question allows only one correct answer.

Wait, looking back, the question says which is NOT a step. So which of these is something a therapist wouldn't do.

I think the answer is D. Because hypnosis isn't part of systematic desensitization. Relaxation is taught through techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, not hypnosis. So D is the exception.

E: Expressing feelings. I don't think this is a step, but perhaps some therapists might use it as an adjunct. But the primary steps don't include this. So E could also be an exception.

But the options given are A to G, and the answer choices are options A-J.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT a step. The options are A to G. So the correct answer is either D or E.

Looking back, in systematic desensitization, after constructing the hierarchy, the client is taught relaxation, then they go through the hierarchy, imagining each situation while relaxed. So option B is correct. Option E, expressing feelings, isn't part of the standard method. So E is an exception. But wait, maybe E is a step in another therapy, like psychodynamic or something.

So maybe both D and E are not steps, but the question gives only one correct answer. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Confront actual feared object (maybe a step)

B: Picture while relaxed (yes)

C: Hierarchy (yes)

D: Hypnosis (no)

E: Express feelings (no)

F: Exposure therapy (yes)

G: Guided imagery (yes)

So the question is asking which is NOT a step. So the incorrect steps are D and E.

But looking at the options, the answer is one of them. So the question is asking which is the exception.

Wait, the question says "each of the following is a step...EXCEPT"

So I need to pick the one that's not a step.

So the steps are: hierarchy (C), relaxation and imagining (B), exposure (F), maybe in vivo (A), guided imagery (G). So A may be part of it.

So the options not part are D and E.

Which one of these is not a step.

The correct answer is D: helping the client experience relaxation through hypnosis. Because systematic desensitization uses progressive muscle relaxation, not hypnosis.

Option E: Instructing to express feelings. I don't think that's part of it. So E is also an exception.

Wait, but the options are from A to G. The question asks for the exception.

Wait, perhaps E is not a step. Because in systematic desensitization, the client doesn't necessarily express feelings; they focus on the relaxation response.

So now I'm a bit confused. So which one is the correct answer.

Looking back:

The options are:

A: confront actual object.

B: picture images while relaxed.

C: hierarchy.

D: hypnosis.

E: express feelings.

F: exposure.

G: guided imagery.

The exception is the one not done. So D and E are not steps.

But the question is which is the exception, so only one answer.

Wait, perhaps option A is part of the process, but in some versions. So if the hierarchy includes real-life exposure, then A is a step. But in many cases, it's imagery-based. So maybe A is a step, making it not the exception.

So the exception is D and E.

But the options are A to G.

Wait, the options are:

The choices are A through J, but the options are A to G.

So the choices are A to G, and the question is to pick the one that is NOT a step.

So the correct answer is D or E.

Looking back, in systematic desensitization, the steps are:

1. Relaxation training (not hypnosis).

2. Construct hierarchy.

3. Exposure through imagery, progressing up hierarchy.

So D is incorrect because hypnosis isn't used. E is incorrect because expressing feelings isn't part of the steps.

But the question gives only one correct answer. So I need to see which of these is the exception.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I thought maybe A is a step.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT a step. So the correct answer is D or E.

I think the answer is D because hypnosis isn't a part of systematic desensitization. The relaxation is taught without hypnosis.

Alternatively, E is not a step because the focus is on relaxation, not expressing emotions.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a step. So if all options except one are steps, which is the exception.

So the steps are B, C, F, G, and A (maybe). So the non-steps are D and E.

But the question gives only one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, E is not a step because systematic desensitization doesn't involve talking about feelings, just the anxiety response.

So perhaps E is the exception. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: What does systematic desensitization involve? Let me recall.

Systematic desensitization was developed by Joseph Wolpe. It's based on counterconditioning. The steps are:

1. Training in deep muscle relaxation.

2. Constructing an anxiety hierarchy.

3. Gradual exposure to the hierarchy items, starting from the least anxiety-provoking, using imagery. The client imagines each situation while relaxed.

So real-life exposure (in vivo) might be part of the hierarchy for some clients, but maybe that's more exposure therapy than systematic desensitization. So A might not be a standard step.

Wait, but sometimes systematic desensitization includes in vivo exposure as the highest level of the hierarchy. So A could be a step.

So now I'm a bit stuck.

But the question is about which is NOT a step.

Option D: Using hypnosis. I'm pretty sure that's not part of systematic desensitization.

Option E: Expressing feelings. Not part of the steps.

So if the options are A to G, and the question is multiple-choice with only one correct answer, the intended answer is likely D.

But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because systematic desensitization doesn't involve expressing feelings, just focusing on relaxation and anxiety reduction.

Wait, I think the correct answer is D. Because hypnosis isn't part of systematic desensitization. The relaxation techniques are taught through methods like progressive muscle relaxation, controlled breathing, not hypnosis.

So the answer is D.

Systematic desensitization is a behavioral therapy technique used to treat phobias and anxiety disorders. It involves gradually exposing the client to the feared object or situation in a controlled manner, starting from the least anxiety-provoking to the most. The process typically includes the following steps:

1. **Relaxation training**: Teaching the client relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation, to help manage anxiety.
2. **Constructing a hierarchy**: Creating a list of feared situations, ranked from least to most anxiety-provoking.
3. **Exposure through imagery**: Having the client imagine each situation in the hierarchy while maintaining a relaxed state.
4. **Guided imagery**: Using visualization to help the client confront their fears.
5. **Exposure therapy**: Gradually exposing the client to the feared stimuli, which may include in vivo exposure in some cases.

Given these steps, the question asks which option is **NOT** a step taken by a therapist employing systematic desensitization. Let’s analyze each option:

- **A: Having the client confront the actual feared object or situation**  
  While systematic desensitization primarily uses imagery, in vivo exposure (confronting the actual feared object) may be included as a later step in some cases. Therefore, this could be considered part of the process.

- **B: Instructing the client to picture each fearful image while maintaining a relaxed state**  
  This is a core step in systematic desensitization, as it involves imagining feared situations while relaxed.

- **C: Constructing a hierarchy of feared images**  
  This is a fundamental step in the process, as the hierarchy guides the gradual exposure.

- **D: Helping the client experience the desired state of relaxation through hypnosis**  
  Hypnosis is not a standard part of systematic desensitization. Relaxation is typically taught through techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, not hypnosis. This makes **D** an exception.

- **E: Instructing the client to express their feelings about each feared image**  
  Systematic desensitization focuses on reducing anxiety through relaxation and exposure, not on expressing feelings. This is not a standard step.

- **F: Using exposure therapy to desensitize the client to feared images**  
  This is a key component of systematic desensitization, as gradual exposure is central to the process.

- **G: Using guided imagery to help the client visualize confronting their fears**  
  Guided imagery is used to help clients visualize feared situations, making this a standard step.

From this analysis, both **D** and **E** are not steps in systematic desensitization. However, since the question asks for a single exception, **D** is the most clear-cut answer because hypnosis is entirely unrelated to the standard methodology of systematic desensitization.
