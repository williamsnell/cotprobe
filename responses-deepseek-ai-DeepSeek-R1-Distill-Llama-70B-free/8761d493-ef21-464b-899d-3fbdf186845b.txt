Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Preston and his car. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So, the problem says Mr. Preston bought a new car for $4,500. He used it for eight years and then sold it for $475. There are two parts to the question: (a) the total depreciation, and (b) the average yearly depreciation.

Hmm, I remember that depreciation is the decrease in the value of an asset over time. So, the total depreciation would be the original cost minus the selling price, right? Because the car isn't worth as much after those years, so the difference is the depreciation.

Let me calculate that. The original price was $4,500, and he sold it for $475. So, 4500 minus 475 equals... let me do the math. 4500 minus 400 is 4100, and then minus 75 more would be 4025. So, the total depreciation is $4,025. 

Now, for part (b), the average yearly depreciation. That should be the total depreciation divided by the number of years he used the car. So, $4,025 divided by 8 years. Let me compute that. 4025 divided by 8. Hmm, what's 8 times 500? That's 4000. So 4025 minus 4000 is 25 left. So, 25 divided by 8 is 3.125. So, 500 plus 3.125 is 503.125. So, about $503.13 per year on average.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. 8 times 500 is 4000, yes. 4025 minus 4000 is 25, right. 25 divided by 8 is 3.125. So, yeah, 503.125. So, $503.13 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Now, looking at the options provided, I need to find which one matches both (a) and (b). 

Looking at the options, option A says total depreciation is $4,025 and yearly is $403.13. Oh wait, that's not matching because 4025/8 is 503, not 403. So A can't be right.

Option B: $3,500 and $437.50. That doesn't match because our total is higher.

Option C: $5,025 and $628.13. No, that's higher than our total, so not correct.

Option D: $3,025 and $378.13. Also lower than ours.

Option E: $4,000 and $500.00. Hmm, 4025 is more than 4000, so not E.

Option F: $3,025 and $503.13. Wait, the yearly here is correct, but the total is 3,025, which is lower than our 4,025. So that's not matching.

Option G: $4,975 and $621.88. No, that's higher than what we have.

Option H: $4,025 and $503.13. Oh, that's exactly what we calculated. So that looks correct.

Option I: $4,500 and $562.50. No, because the selling price reduces the total depreciation.

Option J: $3,975 and $496.88. Doesn't match.

So the correct answer must be option H.

The total depreciation is calculated as the original cost minus the selling price: $4,500 - $475 = $4,025. The average yearly depreciation is the total depreciation divided by the number of years: $4,025 ÷ 8 ≈ $503.13. Comparing these values to the options, the correct choice is:

H: $4,025 and $503.13.

H
