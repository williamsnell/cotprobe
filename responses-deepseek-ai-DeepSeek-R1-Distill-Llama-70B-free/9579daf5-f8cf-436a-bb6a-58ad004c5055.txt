Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve. The question is asking about the limit as x approaches c of (x² -5x -6)/(x - c) existing, and I need to find the value of c from the given options. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that for a limit to exist, the function must approach the same value from both the left and the right sides of c. So, the function should be continuous at that point, right? But wait, if I just plug in x = c into the function, the denominator becomes zero. That means the function is undefined at x = c unless the numerator is also zero there, which would create a 0/0 indeterminate form. So, maybe I should factor the numerator to see if it can be simplified.

Let me factor the numerator: x² -5x -6. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to -5. Oh right, that's -6 and +1. So, it factors into (x - 6)(x + 1). So the function becomes (x - 6)(x + 1)/(x - c).

Now, for the function to have a limit as x approaches c, the (x - c) in the denominator must cancel out with a factor in the numerator. That means that the numerator must have (x - c) as a factor. So, either (x - 6) or (x + 1) must equal (x - c). 

So, setting x - c equal to either (x -6) or (x +1). Let's see:

If (x - c) = (x -6), then c must be 6. Alternatively, if (x - c) = (x +1), then c must be -1. Wait, but wait a minute, let's make sure. Let's test these possibilities.

So, if c is 6, then the function becomes (x² -5x -6)/(x -6). Let's see if this simplifies. The numerator is (x-6)(x+1), so dividing by (x-6) leaves us with (x+1). So as x approaches 6, the function approaches 6 + 1 =7. So the limit exists and is 7 when c is 6.

Alternatively, if c is -1, the function becomes (x² -5x -6)/(x +1). Let's factor the numerator again: (x-6)(x+1). So, the (x+1) terms cancel out, leaving (x-6). As x approaches -1, x-6 approaches -7. So the limit is -7 when c is -1.

Wait, but the question is about the limit existing for some value of c. So both c=6 and c=-1 would make the limit exist. But looking at the options provided, I need to see which option includes either 6 or -1.

Looking at the options:

Options are A to J, each with a pair of numbers. Let me list them:

A: 0 and 5
B: 2 and 8
C: 1 and7
D:3 and9
E:1 and5
F:-3 and3
G:-4 and2
H:0 and6
I:-2 and4
J:-1 and6.

Wait, the question is about the value of c, which is a single number, but the options are given as ranges. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, no, the options are presented as [a, b], which I think are pairs indicating possible values. Wait, no, perhaps each option is a possible c value. Or maybe the question is asking for which interval c falls into. Oh wait, perhaps each option is a possible pair of c values, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the options are intervals within which c lies, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the options are for possible c values, but each option is a single number, but the way it's written is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the options are presented as pairs, but that's unclear. Wait, looking at the initial setup, the question is asking for the value of c. So c should be a single number. Therefore, the options are given as pairs, perhaps indicating possible c values, but perhaps the options are for possible c's, but perhaps only one of the options has c in it.

Wait, but perhaps I should recheck the question. The question says: "What is the value of c?" So c is a single number. So the options are each intervals, but probably each option is a possible value. Wait, perhaps the options are possible values, but presented as [a, b], but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps each option is a single number, but perhaps the way the options are presented is with square brackets, perhaps indicating each option is a single integer in some interval.

Wait, perhaps I should read the options again. The options are A to J, each as [numbers]. For example, option A is [0,5], which could mean 0 and 5, but perhaps it's a range. Wait, but the question is about a specific value of c. So perhaps each option is a possible value of c, and the options are single numbers. But the way it's presented is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are the possible c values, and each option is a choice between two numbers. So for example, option A is 0 or 5, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the options are providing pairs of possible c values, and the correct c is either 6 or -1, so which option includes either 6 or -1.

Looking at the options:

Option H is [0,6], which would include 6.

Option J is [-1,6], which includes -1 and 6.

Wait, but the question is about the value of c. So if c can be either 6 or -1, then which option correctly includes one of these values.

Looking at option H: [0,6]. So 6 is in this range, so H is a possible answer.

Option J is [-1,6], so it includes both -1 and 6. So if c can be either, then J would include both possible c's.

Wait, but the question is about the value of c where the limit exists, and both c=6 and c=-1 are valid. So perhaps the answer is an option that includes either 6 or -1.

Looking at the options, option J is [-1,6], which includes both. But the question is asking for the value of c, which would be a single number, not a range. So perhaps each option represents a possible c, but the way the options are presented is as pairs, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are possible pairs of c values, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are intervals, and the question is asking which interval contains c.

Wait, the question is presented as "What is the value of c?" So perhaps the options are possible c values, but each option lists two possible c's, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the options are possible c values, each being a single number, but presented in square brackets for some reason.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again:

A: [0,5] → 0 and 5

B: [2,8]

C: [1,7]

D: [3,9]

E: [1,5]

F: [-3,3]

G: [-4,2]

H: [0,6]

I: [-2,4]

J: [-1,6]

Wait, perhaps the options are intervals, and the question is asking which interval contains c. So c could be 6 or -1, so which interval includes at least one of these values.

So, looking for an interval that includes 6 or -1.

Looking for 6: which options include 6?

Option H is [0,6], which includes 6.

Option J is [-1,6], which includes 6 and -1.

So if c is 6, then H includes 6.

If c is -1, then J includes -1.

But the question is about the value of c, so perhaps the correct answer is either 6 or -1, but the options give ranges. So perhaps the correct option is the one that includes either 6 or -1.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the limit exists, so what is the value of c. So there might be two possible c's, but the options are given as ranges, so the correct option is the one that includes either 6 or -1.

So, which options include 6 or -1?

Option H: 0 to 6 → includes 6.

Option J: -1 to 6 → includes both -1 and 6.

So both H and J include possible c values. But the question is to choose one option. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when c is 6, the function simplifies to (x+1), so the limit is 7. Similarly, when c is -1, the function simplifies to (x-6), so the limit is -7. So both c=6 and c=-1 make the limit exist.

But the options don't have 6 and -1 as single options. So perhaps the correct option is the one that includes both possible c's. Looking at the options, only option J includes both -1 and 6.

Wait, no, option J is [-1,6], which is from -1 to 6, but c is a specific value, so perhaps the correct answer is option J, because c can be either -1 or 6, and J includes both.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only one correct c value. But in reality, both 6 and -1 are possible.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's implying that only one value of c makes the limit exist. Let me think again.

Wait, when c is not equal to 6 or -1, what happens? Let's say c is 2. Then the function becomes (x² -5x -6)/(x -2). Let's plug in x approaching 2. The numerator at x=2 is 4 -10 -6 = -12. The denominator approaches 0. So the limit would be -12/(0), which tends to negative infinity. So the limit doesn't exist in that case.

Similarly, if c is 3, the numerator at x=3 is 9 -15 -6 = -12. Denominator approaches 0, so limit is -12/0, which is negative infinity. So the limit doesn't exist.

Only when c is 6 or -1, because in those cases, the numerator also becomes zero, leading to a 0/0 form, which allows for simplification and the limit to exist.

So, the possible c's are 6 and -1.

Looking back at the options, option J is [-1,6], which includes both. So if the question is asking for all possible c values, then J would be the correct option. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the value of c, implying a single value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are meant to be single values, but the way they're written is as ranges, which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in factoring.

Wait, let me double-check the factoring. The numerator is x² -5x -6. So factors of -6 that add up to -5 are -6 and +1, correct. So (x-6)(x+1). So yes, correct.

So, when c is 6, then the function simplifies to (x+1), so limit is 7. When c is -1, function simplifies to (x-6), so limit is -7.

So, the possible c's are 6 and -1.

Now, looking at the options:

Option J is [-1,6], which includes both. So perhaps the correct answer is J, as it includes both possible c's.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have a single correct c. But in reality, both 6 and -1 are valid. So perhaps the intended answer is 6, making option H ([0,6]) the correct one, but that's just a guess.

Wait, but the options don't have 6 as an option; instead, each option is a range. So the correct approach is to select the option that includes either 6 or -1.

So, for c=6, option H includes 6.

For c=-1, option J includes -1.

But the question is asking for the value of c, so if the options are ranges, perhaps the correct option is J, as it's the only one that includes both possible c values. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the limit exists only when c is a root of the numerator, so that the function can be simplified. The numerator's roots are at x=6 and x=-1. So c must be 6 or -1.

Therefore, the correct options are those that include 6 or -1.

Looking at the options, option J includes both 6 and -1, so J is the correct choice.

To determine the value of \( c \) such that the limit 

\[
\lim_{x \to c} \frac{x^2 - 5x - 6}{x - c}
\]

exists, we first factor the numerator:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 6 = (x - 6)(x + 1).
\]

For the limit to exist, the function must be continuous at \( x = c \). This requires the denominator \( (x - c) \) to cancel out a factor in the numerator. Thus, \( c \) must be a root of the numerator, making the numerator zero when \( x = c \). The roots of the numerator are \( x = 6 \) and \( x = -1 \). Therefore, \( c \) can be either \( 6 \) or \( -1 \).

Next, we analyze the given options to identify which interval includes either \( 6 \) or \( -1 \). The options are:

- **A:** \([0, 5]\)
- **B:** \([2, 8]\)
- **C:** \([1, 7]\)
- **D:** \([3, 9]\)
- **E:** \([1, 5]\)
- **F:** \([-3, 3]\)
- **G:** \([-4, 2]\)
- **H:** \([0, 6]\)
- **I:** \([-2, 4]\)
- **J:** \([-1, 6]\)

- **Option A:** Does not include \( 6 \) or \( -1 \).
- **Option B:** Includes \( 6 \) but not \( -1 \).
- **Option C:** Includes \( 6 \) but not \( -1 \).
- **Option D:** Includes \( 6 \) but not \( -1 \).
- **Option E:** Does not include \( 6 \) or \( -1 \).
- **Option F:** Includes \( -1 \) but not \( 6 \).
- **Option G:** Does not include \( 6 \) or \( -1 \).
- **Option H:** Includes \( 6 \) but not \( -1 \).
- **Option I:** Does not include \( 6 \) or \( -1 \).
- **Option J:** Includes both \( 6 \) and \( -1 \).

Since \( c \) can be either \( 6 \) or \( -1 \), the correct option is the one that includes both values. **Option J** (\([-1, 6]\)) is the only interval that satisfies this condition.

**Answer: J**
