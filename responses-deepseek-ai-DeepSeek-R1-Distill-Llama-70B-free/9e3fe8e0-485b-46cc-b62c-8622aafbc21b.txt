Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about airflow through a pipe. The given data includes the density of air, viscosity, pipe diameter, and the mean velocity. We need to find the velocity at two specific points from the wall and the thickness of the laminar sub-layer.

First, I remember that for pipe flow, especially when it's turbulent, the velocity profile isn't uniform. The flow can be divided into different regions: the laminar sub-layer, the buffer layer, and the turbulent core. But I'm not entirely sure how each works, so maybe I should review that.

Wait, the problem mentions the laminar sub-layer thickness based on u+ and y+ both being 5. Oh right, the dimensionless variables u+ and y+ are defined as (u * u_star) / (u_star) and (y * rho * u_star) / mu, respectively. Wait, no, the user said u+ = u * u_star / something? Wait, no, the question defines u+ as (u y / u*) — no, wait, let me check:

No, the problem says u+ is (u * y) / u*. Wait, no, wait. No, it says u+ is (uy)/(u*), and y+ is (y rho u*) / mu. Hmm, I think I might have mixed that up. Let me make sure: u+ is the dimensionless velocity, and y+ is the dimensionless distance from the wall. Oh wait, I think I might have it backwards. Typically, in boundary layer problems, u+ is u / u_tau (the friction velocity), and y+ is (y * u_tau * rho) / mu. So yeah, that seems right.

So the laminar sub-layer is where the flow is still laminar, and it's near the wall. In this region, the velocity profile follows the linear relationship u = u* y / mu, but wait, no, I think it's u = (u* / (rho)) * (y * rho u* / mu) )? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the laminar sub-layer, the velocity distribution is given by u = (u*^2 / ν) y, where ν is the kinematic viscosity. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: u+ = y+ because the flow is Newtonian and the shear stress is constant in the sub-layer. So yes, because in the sub-layer, the shear stress is approximately constant and equal to the wall shear stress. So, the velocity gradient is constant, leading to u = (tau_wall / mu) * y, where tau_wall is the wall shear stress.

But tau_wall can also be expressed as u* rho, since u* is the friction velocity, defined by u* = sqrt(tau_wall / rho). So tau_wall = rho u*^2. Therefore, u = (rho u*^2 / mu) * y. Let me write that:

u = (rho u*^2) / mu * y.

But u+ is u/(u*) and y+ is (rho u* y)/mu. So substituting y = (mu y+)/(rho u*), we can express u in terms of u* and y+.

Wait, let's see. If I divide both sides of u = (rho u*^2 / mu) y by u*, I get u/u* = (rho u* y)/ (mu) = y+. So u+ = y+. So in the laminar sub-layer, u+ equals y+. That's a key point. So for y+ <= 5, u+ = y+.

So the thickness of the laminar sub-layer is the y where y+ = 5. That is, delta_lam = (5 * mu) / (rho u*). So delta_lam = (5 mu)/(rho u*).

But wait, I need to find u*. Hmm. How do I find u*? Let me think. Because the problem gives the mean velocity, which is 50 ft/s. So perhaps I can find the Reynolds number first, then determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent, and then find u*.

Wait, the air is flowing through a pipe with diameter D = 10 inches. Let me convert that to feet because the units are in feet and pounds. 10 inches is 10/12 = 0.8333... feet.

The mean velocity U_mean is 50 ft/s. The Reynolds number Re is (rho * U_mean * D) / mu.

Plugging in the numbers:

rho = 0.07 lb/ft^3.

mu = 12.9e-6 lb/(ft·s).

D = 0.8333 ft.

U_mean = 50 ft/s.

So Re = (0.07 lb/ft^3) * (50 ft/s) * (0.8333 ft) / (12.9e-6 lb/(ft·s)).

Calculating numerator: 0.07 * 50 = 3.5, 3.5 * 0.8333 ≈ 2.91665.

Denominator: 12.9e-6 ≈ 0.0000129.

So Re ≈ 2.91665 / 0.0000129 ≈ let's calculate that.

2.91665 / 0.0000129 = approximately 226,000 or so. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 12.9e-6 is 0.0000129. So 2.91665 / 0.0000129.

Let me compute 2.91665 / 0.0000129:

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.000001 to make it easier.

2.91665e6 / 12.9 ≈ 2.91665e6 / 12.9.

2.91665e6 ≈ 2,916,650.

Divide by 12.9: 2,916,650 / 12.9 ≈ approximately 226,000. Let me compute:

12.9 * 226,000 = 12.9 * 226,000 = let's see, 12 * 226,000 = 2,712,000, 0.9 * 226,000 = 203,400. Total 2,712,000 + 203,400 = 2,915,400.

So 226,000 gives 2,915,400. Our numerator is 2,916,650, which is 1,250 more. So 226,000 + (1,250 / 12.9) ≈ 226,000 + ~96.8 ≈ 226,096.8. So Re ≈ 226,100 approximately.

That's a Reynolds number of about 226,000, which is greater than 4000, so the flow is turbulent. So the velocity profile will be turbulent, and the pipe is in the turbulent flow regime.

In turbulent pipe flow, the velocity profile can be described using the power-law or the logarithmic law, depending on the region. But since the problem involves the laminar sub-layer up to y+ = 5, perhaps I can use the logarithmic profile for the buffer layer and turbulent core, but first, I need to find u*, the friction velocity.

Wait, but how do I find u*? I think for turbulent flow in pipes, the friction factor (either Moody's or using the appropriate formula) is used. Alternatively, since we have the mean velocity, perhaps we can use the relation involving the friction factor.

Wait, the mean velocity in a pipe for turbulent flow can be related to the friction velocity via the von Karman integral, which gives the relation between the mean velocity and u*.

The von Karman momentum integral leads to 1/√(f) = 2.0 ln(Re√f) - 1.6, where f is the Darcy friction factor. Or for smooth pipes, the approximation can be used.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the friction factor using the formula for smooth pipes, which at high Reynolds numbers approaches f ≈ 0.079 / (Re)^{1/4}.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the Colebrook equation or the Haaland approximation, but since the pipe is probably considered hydraulically smooth (as air is a gas and the pipe's roughness isn't mentioned), we can assume it's smooth.

So for a smooth pipe, the friction factor is given by f = 0.079 / (Re)^{1/4}.

Wait, let me check the formula. I think it's f = 0.079 Re^{-1/4} for Re > 4000.

So, with Re ≈ 226,000, let me compute f.

f = 0.079 * (226,000)^{-1/4}.

First, compute (226,000)^{1/4}.

Wait, 226,000 = 2.26e5.

The fourth root of 1e5 is (1e5)^(1/4) = 10^(5/4) = 10^1.25 ≈ 17.7828.

Now 2.26e5 is 2.26 * 1e5, so its fourth root is (2.26)^(1/4) * (1e5)^(1/4).

Compute (2.26)^(1/4):

2.26^0.25 ≈ Let's see, sqrt(2.26) ≈ 1.503, then sqrt(1.503) ≈ 1.226.

So (2.26e5)^(1/4) ≈ 1.226 * 17.7828 ≈ Let me compute that:

1.226 * 17.7828 ≈ 1.2 * 17.7828 = 21.339, 0.026 *17.7828≈0.461. So total ≈ 21.8.

So f ≈ 0.079 / 21.8 ≈ 0.003625.

So f ≈ 0.003625.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute (226,000)^{1/4} more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute ln(Re) and use the formula for f in terms of Re.

Wait, another formula for smooth pipes is:

1/√(f) = 2.0 ln(Re * sqrt(f)) - 0.8.

But that's an implicit equation in f, which is a bit tricky to solve. Alternatively, since we have Re >> 4000, perhaps the approximation f ≈ 0.079 Re^{-1/4} is acceptable.

So let me proceed with f = 0.079 / (226000)^{0.25}.

Compute 226000^(0.25):

Let me compute 226000^(1/4). Let's take natural logs.

ln(226000) = ln(2.26e5) = ln(2.26) + 5 ln(10) ≈ 0.817 + 5*2.3026 = 0.817 + 11.513 ≈ 12.33.

So (1/4) ln(226000) = 12.33 /4 ≈ 3.0825.

Exponentiate: e^{3.0825} ≈ e^3 is about 20.085, e^0.0825 ≈ 1.0856. So 20.085 * 1.0856 ≈ 21.8, which matches my earlier approximation.

So f ≈ 0.079 / 21.8 ≈ 0.003625.

Then, the friction velocity u* is given by u* = U_mean * sqrt(f/8).

Because the Darcy friction factor f is related to the Fanning friction factor by f = 4 f_Fanning, and the friction velocity is u* = sqrt( (f_Fanning * U_mean^2 ) / 2 ).

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The friction velocity u* is defined as u* = sqrt( (tau_wall) / rho ), where tau_wall is the wall shear stress.

The wall shear stress tau_wall is given by (f * rho * U_mean^2 ) / 8, because for pipe flow, tau_wall = (f * rho U_mean^2 ) / 8.

So u* = sqrt( (f rho U_mean^2 ) / (8 rho) ) )= sqrt( (f U_mean^2 ) / 8 ) = (U_mean ) * sqrt(f /8).

Yes, so u* = U_mean * sqrt(f/(8)).

So plugging in f ≈ 0.003625 and U_mean =50 ft/s:

u* = 50 * sqrt(0.003625 /8) = 50 * sqrt(0.000453125) ≈ 50 * 0.02127 ≈ 1.0635 ft/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.003625 /8 = 0.000453125.

sqrt(0.000453125) ≈ 0.02127.

So 50 * 0.02127 ≈ 1.0635 ft/s.

So u* ≈ 1.0635 ft/s.

Now, we can compute the thickness of the laminar sub-layer, which is delta_lam, the y where y+ =5.

From earlier, delta_lam = (5 * mu) / (rho u* ).

Plugging in the numbers:

mu =12.9e-6 lb/(ft·s).

rho =0.07 lb/ft^3.

u* =1.0635 ft/s.

delta_lam = (5 * 12.9e-6) / (0.07 * 1.0635).

Compute numerator: 5 *12.9e-6=64.5e-6 = 6.45e-5.

Denominator: 0.07 *1.0635 ≈ 0.07445.

So delta_lam ≈ 6.45e-5 / 0.07445 ≈ approximately 0.000866 feet.

Wait, 6.45e-5 divided by 0.07445.

Let me compute this:

6.45e-5 is 0.0000645.

0.0000645 / 0.07445 ≈ approximately 0.000866.

But wait, the units are in feet, and the options are in inches. So we need to convert feet to inches.

1 foot =12 inches, so 0.000866 ft = 0.000866 *12 inches = approximately 0.0104 inches. About 0.0104 inches, which is 0.010 inches when rounded.

Looking at the options, let me check:

Option A: 0.007 in.

Option B: 0.006 in.

Option C: 0.011 in.

Option D: 0.007 in.

Option E: 0.009 in.

Option F: 0.012 in.

Option G: 0.008 in.

Option H: 0.004 in.

Option I: 0.005 in.

Option J: 0.01 in.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 0.0104 inches, which is closest to option J (0.01 in) or C (0.011 in).

Wait, perhaps I should recheck my calculations for any errors.

Let me recalculate delta_lam:

delta_lam = (5 * mu) / (rho * u* )

mu=12.9e-6 lb/(ft·s)

rho=0.07 lb/ft^3

u*=1.0635 ft/s.

So numerator:5 *12.9e-6 =64.5e-6 lb/(ft·s).

Denominator:0.07 *1.0635 ≈ 0.07445 lb/(ft^3 * ft/s) ?

Wait, let me make sure about the units.

Wait, mu is in lb/(ft·s), rho is lb/ft^3, u* is ft/s.

So denominator is rho*u* = (lb/ft^3) * (ft/s) = lb/(ft² s).

Numerator is mu (lb/(ft·s)).

So numerator/mu has units (lb/(ft·s)) / (lb/(ft² s)) )= ft.

Yes, so delta_lam is in feet.

So delta_lam = (5 * 12.9e-6) / (0.07 *1.0635) ft.

Compute numerator:5 *12.9e-6 = 64.5e-6.

Denominator:0.07 *1.0635 ≈ 0.07445.

So 64.5e-6 / 0.07445 = ?

64.5e-6 = 6.45e-5.

6.45e-5 / 0.07445 ≈ 0.000866 ft.

Convert to inches: 0.000866 *12 ≈ 0.0104 inches.

So approximately 0.0104 inches, which is 0.010 inches when rounded to three decimal places.

Looking at the options, option J says 0.01 in, and option C says 0.011 in. So J is 0.01 in, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating u*. Let me double-check the steps.

Earlier, I calculated f as 0.003625. Then u* = U_mean * sqrt(f/8).

U_mean is 50 ft/s.

sqrt(f/8) = sqrt(0.003625 /8) = sqrt(0.000453125) ≈ 0.02127.

So u* ≈ 50 * 0.02127 ≈ 1.0635 ft/s.

That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should check the formula for u*. Maybe I confused the Fanning and Darcy factors.

Wait, the Darcy friction factor f is related to the Fanning factor f_f by f =4 f_f.

The friction velocity is u* = sqrt( (f_f * U_mean^2 ) / 2 ).

Since f_f = f /4, this becomes u* = sqrt( (f U_mean^2 )/(4 * 2) )= sqrt(f U_mean^2 /8 )= U_mean * sqrt(f/8 ), which is what I used. So that's correct.

So delta_lam is about 0.0104 inches, so 0.01 inches as in option J, or 0.0104 is closer to 0.01 than 0.011.

So the laminar sub-layer thickness is approximately 0.01 inches. Looking at the options, option J has 0.01 in for the thickness.

Now, moving on to find the velocities at 0.4 inches and 3 inches from the wall.

Wait, the pipe has a diameter of 10 inches, so radius R is 5 inches, which is
