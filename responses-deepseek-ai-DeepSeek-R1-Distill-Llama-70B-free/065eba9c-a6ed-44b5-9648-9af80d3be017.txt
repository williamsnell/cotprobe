Question:

A state has a statute prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to any person under the age of 17. Violation of the statute is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $500 or more than $5,000 The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. The defendant, a recovering alcoholic, worked as a cashier at a drug store. Late one night while the defendant was working alone, he got the urge to have a drink. He opened a bottle of rum that the store sold and soon began drinking. A short time later, the defendant became inebriated and passed out. Not long thereafter, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to purchase a package of cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for them. Seeing the defendant lying on the floor, unconscious, the girl left the exact price for the cigarettes on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, he should be found

Options:

A: guilty, because the defendant was in charge of the store at the time of the violation.
B: not guilty, because the defendant's employer is vicariously liable for the violation that occurred.
C: not guilty, because the defendant did not physically sell the cigarettes to the girl.
D: not guilty, because the defendant did not receive any money for the cigarettes.
E: not guilty, because the defendant was unconscious.
F: not guilty, because the girl took the cigarettes without the defendant's knowledge.
G: guilty, because the 15-year-old girl should have been denied service.
H: guilty, because the defendant left the cigarettes in an accessible place.
I: guilty, because the defendant's intoxication was voluntaiy.

Okay, I need to figure out this criminal law question. So, the state has a statute making it a misdemeanor to sell cigarettes to anyone under 17. The punishment is a fine between $500 and $5,000. The state courts have said this is a public welfare offense, meaning it's a strict liability crime. So, no specific mental state is required—just the act itself.

The defendant is a recovering alcoholic working as a cashier. One night, he was working alone and gave in to the urge to drink. He opened a bottle of rum and got so drunk he passed out. Then a 15-year-old girl came in, took cigarettes, and left the money. The question is whether the defendant is guilty.

So, strict liability means that even if he didn't intend to commit the crime, he can still be held liable. The key here is whether he actually sold the cigarettes. But wait, he was unconscious. Did he perform the act of selling?

In the scenario, the girl took the cigarettes and left the money. The defendant was passed out, so he didn't ring up the sale or take the money. So, did he sell them? Or did the girl just take them?

Under strict liability, if the elements of the crime are met, he's guilty regardless of intent. The crime here is selling cigarettes to a minor. But if he was unconscious, did he actually sell them? Or did the girl just take them without any action on his part?

Wait, maybe the act is making the cigarettes available. If the store was left open and accessible, maybe that's enough. Or does the sale require an affirmative action by the seller?

I think the sale requires some action, like ringing up the purchase. But he was passed out, so he didn't do anything. So perhaps he didn't commit the act. But maybe the fact that he was supposed to be in charge makes him liable.

Option A says guilty because he was in charge. But if he didn't perform the act, does being in charge make him liable? Or is it about whether the sale happened under his watch.

Alternatively, maybe the crime is just selling, regardless of who actually did it. But I think the defendant must have performed the prohibited act. If he was unconscious, he didn't sell anything.

Wait, but in some cases, like if an employer is responsible for the actions of employees, but that's vicarious liability, which is different. The question says it's a strict liability offense, so it's about whether the defendant did the act, not whether someone else did.

So, if the defendant didn't sell the cigarettes because he was passed out, then he didn't commit the act. Therefore, he shouldn't be guilty.

Looking at the options:

A: Guilty because in charge. But if he didn't do the act, maybe not.

C: Not guilty because he didn't physically sell. That makes sense.

E: Not guilty because he was unconscious. That also makes sense because he couldn't have acted.

Hmm. So, which is it? The elements of the crime—did he sell cigarettes? If selling requires some action, and he was unconscious, he didn't sell. So C would say not guilty because he didn't sell.

Alternatively, E says not guilty because he was unconscious. But strict liability doesn't require intent, but the act must still be committed. So, the key is whether he performed the act of selling.

In this case, he didn't sell; the girl took the cigarettes without his involvement. So the answer would be C.

But wait, some might argue that leaving the store open and the cigarettes accessible constitutes the act. But I don't think that's the case. The act is the sale, which involves transferring the cigarettes for money, which he didn't do.

So, the correct answer is C: Not guilty because he didn't physically sell the cigarettes.

The question revolves around whether the defendant, a cashier who became unconscious due to voluntary intoxication, can be held liable under a strict liability statute for selling cigarettes to a minor. The statute prohibits selling cigarettes to anyone under 17, and liability does not require a specific mental state—only the commission of the prohibited act.

Key points to consider:

1. **Strict Liability**: The statute imposes liability solely based on the act of selling cigarettes to a minor, regardless of intent or knowledge. However, the defendant must still have performed the prohibited act.

2. **Defendant's Actions**: The defendant was unconscious when the 15-year-old girl took the cigarettes and left the money. Since he was incapacitated, he did not physically sell the cigarettes or take any affirmative action to facilitate the sale.

3. **Elements of the Crime**: The crime requires the act of selling, which involves transferring cigarettes in exchange for payment. If the defendant did not engage in this act—such as ringing up the sale or handing over the cigarettes—then the essential elements of the crime were not met.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. Being "in charge" does not automatically make the defendant liable if he did not perform the prohibited act.
   - **C**: Correct. The defendant did not physically sell the cigarettes, as he was unconscious and took no action to facilitate the sale.
   - **E**: Incorrect. While the defendant's unconsciousness explains why he did not act, the key issue is whether he performed the prohibited act, not his state of mind.

Since the defendant did not perform the act of selling the cigarettes, he cannot be found guilty under the statute. The correct answer is:

C: Not guilty, because the defendant did not physically sell the cigarettes to the girl.

Answer: C
