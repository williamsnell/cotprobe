Okay, so I've got this problem here where Molly got a haircut for $25 and she left a 15% tip. I need to find out what her final cost was. Hmm, let's see. 

Alright, so the total cost would be the original price plus the tip, right? So the haircut is $25, and then she adds a 15% tip on top of that. I remember that to calculate a tip, you multiply the original amount by the tip percentage. 

Wait, so 15% as a decimal is 0.15. So I should multiply 25 by 0.15 to get the tip amount. Let me do that. 25 times 0.15... let's see, 25 times 0.1 is 2.5, and 25 times 0.05 is 1.25. So adding those together, 2.5 + 1.25 equals 3.75. So the tip is $3.75.

Now, I need to add that tip to the original $25. So 25 plus 3.75 is 28.75. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 25 + 3 is 28, and then plus 0.75 makes 28.75. Yeah, that seems correct.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option E is $28.75. So that should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So 15% of 25 is 3.75, add that to 25 gives 28.75. Yep, that's right. So the final cost is $28.75, which is option E.

The total cost is calculated by adding the original haircut price ($25) to the tip (15% of $25). 

1. Calculate 15% of $25:  
   \( 25 \times 0.15 = 3.75 \).  
2. Add the tip to the original price:  
   \( 25 + 3.75 = 28.75 \).  

Thus, Molly’s final cost is **$28.75**, which corresponds to option E.
