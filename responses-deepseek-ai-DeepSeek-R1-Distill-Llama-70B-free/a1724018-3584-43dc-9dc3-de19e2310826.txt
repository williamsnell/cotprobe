Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two carts colliding elastically. Hmm, elastic collision... right, that means both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let me think.

The setup is a small cart with mass m initially at rest. It collides elastically with a larger cart of mass 4m, which is moving with velocity v. After the collision, the large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the little cart. I need to find the velocity of the little cart after the collision.

Wait, the large cart loses half its kinetic energy. So initially, the large cart's kinetic energy is (1/2)(4m)v², which is 2 m v². Losing half of that would mean it loses m v², so the small cart gains m v². So the small cart's kinetic energy after collision is m v². Since the small cart was at rest, all its kinetic energy comes from this transfer.

The kinetic energy of the small cart after collision is (1/2)m (v_small)² = m v². Let me set up that equation.

(1/2)m (v_small)^2 = m v² → (v_small)^2 = 2 v² → v_small = sqrt(2) v ≈ 1.414 v. Oh wait, that's approximately 1.41v. Looking at the options, option I is 1.41v. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake because I often mix up elastic collision equations.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the conservation of momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy because it's an elastic collision.

So, let's define the variables. Let me call the initial velocity of the small cart zero (u1=0), and the large cart's velocity u2 = v. After collision, their velocities are v1 and v2 respectively.

Conservation of momentum: m*0 + 4m*v = m*v1 + 4m*v2 → 4m v = m v1 + 4m v2. Dividing both sides by m: 4v = v1 + 4v2 → equation (1).

Conservation of kinetic energy: (1/2)m (0)^2 + (1/2)(4m)v² = (1/2)m v1² + (1/2)(4m)v2². Simplify:

0 + 2m v² = (1/2 m v1²) + 2m v2² → 2m v² = (0.5 m v1²) + 2m v2².

Divide both sides by m: 2 v² = 0.5 v1² + 2 v2² → multiply both sides by 2: 4v² = v1² + 4v2² → equation (2).

Now, I have two equations:

1) 4v = v1 + 4v2 → v1 = 4v -4v2.

2) 4v² = (4v -4v2)^2 +4 v2^2.

Let me substitute v1 from equation (1) into equation (2):

4v² = (4v -4v2)^2 +4 v2².

Expand (4v -4v2)^2: (16v² - 32v v2 +16 v2²).

So equation becomes:

4v² = 16v² -32v v2 +16v2² +4v2².

Combine like terms on the right:

4v² = 16v² -32v v2 +20 v2².

Move everything to one side:

0 = 16v² -32v v2 +20v2² -4v² → 12v² -32v v2 +20v2² =0.

Divide all terms by 4:

3v² -8v v2 +5 v2² =0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of v2. Let me write it as 5v2² -8v v2 +3v²=0.

Using quadratic formula for v2:

v2 = [8v ± sqrt(64v² - 4*5*3v²)]/(2*5)

Calculate discriminant: 64v² -60v² =4v² → sqrt(4v²)=2v.

So v2 = [8v ±2v]/10.

So two possibilities:

v2 = (8v +2v)/10 =10v/10 =v → v2=v → but that would mean the large cart didn't change velocity, which can't be right because it did lose KE.

Alternatively, v2 = (8v-2v)/10 =6v/10=0.6v.

So v2=0.6v.

Then from equation (1), v1=4v -4*(0.6v)=4v -2.4v=1.6v.

Wait, so the small cart's velocity is 1.6v. But wait, that's not matching the earlier approach where I got 1.41v. Hmm, what's going on here.

Oh wait, the first approach assumed that the small cart's KE is m v². But the problem says the large cart loses half of its KE to the small cart. So the KE lost by the large cart is (1/2)(initial KE of large cart) = (1/2)(2 m v²) =m v². So the small cart gains m v².

So in that case, (1/2)m v1² = m v² → v1²=2v² → v1=sqrt(2)v≈1.414v. So that would be option I.

But using the conservation equations, I got v1=1.6v. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the problem again.

It says the large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the little cart. So the KE of the large cart after collision is half of its initial KE.

Wait, initial KE of large cart is (1/2)(4m)v²=2m v². Losing half would mean it's left with m v². So the small cart gains 2m v² - m v² = m v². So small cart's KE is m v². So (1/2)m v1² =m v² → v1= sqrt(2) v≈1.414v, which is option I.

But in the second approach, using the elastic collision equations, I got v1=1.6v. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the second method. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me go step by step again. The two equations are:

1) 4v = v1 +4 v2.

2) 4v² = v1² +4 v2².

And we got v2=0.6v, v1=1.6v.

But according to the KE approach, the small cart's KE is m v². Which would be (1/2)m (1.6v)^2= (1/2)m*(2.56 v²)=1.28 m v². But according to the problem, the small cart gains m v². So that doesn't match.

Hmm, so there's a discrepancy. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption in the first approach is wrong. Because when the problem says the large cart loses half its KE to the little cart, that might mean that the little cart gains KE equal to half of the large cart's initial KE. But that's what I thought.

Wait, initial KE of large cart is 2m v². Losing half to the small cart would mean the small cart gains m v². But in the conservation approach, the small cart's KE is (1/2)m (1.6v)^2= 1.28 m v², which is more than m v². So something's wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the KE lost by the large cart is equal to the KE gained by the small cart. So the KE lost by large cart is (initial KE) - (final KE) = 2m v² - (1/2)(4m)(v2)^2.

But according to problem, KE lost by large cart is m v², so:

2m v² - (1/2)(4m)v2² = m v² → 2mv² - 2m v2² = m v² → 2mv² -m v² =2m v2² → mv²=2m v2² → v²=2 v2² → v2= v/√2 ≈0.707v.

Wait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, maybe I should approach this again.

Wait, let's think in terms of KE. The large cart loses half of its KE, so its final KE is (1/2)(2m v²) = m v². So the final KE of the large cart is m v².

The initial KE of the large cart is 2 m v². So it lost m v², which must have been transferred to the small cart. Thus, the small cart's KE after collision is m v².

So, for the small cart: (1/2)m v1² = m v² → v1²=2 v² → v1=√2 v≈1.414v.

So that would point to option I: 1.41v.

But earlier, using the conservation of momentum and KE, I got v1=1.6v.

So which is correct?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the second approach.

Wait, perhaps I should correct the equation.

Wait, let's go back to the two equations:

Equation 1: 4v = v1 +4 v2.

Equation 2: 4v² = v1² +4 v2².

We can solve these two equations.

From equation 1: v1 =4v -4v2.

Plugging into equation 2: 4v² = (4v -4v2)^2 +4 v2².

Expanding (4v-4v2)^2: 16 v² -32 v v2 +16 v2².

So equation 2 becomes:

4v² =16v² -32 v v2 +16 v2² +4 v2².

Combine terms: 4v²=16v² -32v v2 +20 v2².

Move everything to left: 0=12v² -32v v2 +20 v2².

Divide by 4: 0=3v² -8v v2 +5v2².

Which is the same as 5v2² -8v v2 +3v²=0.

Using quadratic formula: v2 = [8v ± sqrt(64v² -60v²)]/(2*5) → [8v ±2v]/10.

So v2=(8v +2v)/10=10v/10=v → but that's the initial velocity, which would mean no collision, so not possible. Or v2=(8v-2v)/10=6v/10=0.6v.

So v2=0.6v.

Then v1=4v -4*(0.6v)=4v-2.4v=1.6v.

So from this method, v1=1.6v.

But according to the KE approach, v1 should be sqrt(2)v≈1.414v.

This discrepancy suggests I've made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem says the large cart loses half its KE to the little cart. So the KE lost by the large cart is (1/2)(2m v²)=m v². So the small cart's KE is m v².

But according to the conservation approach, the small cart's KE is (1/2)m (1.6v)^2= 0.5*m*(2.56v²)=1.28 m v².

Which is more than m v², so this suggests that the second approach is not aligning with the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read.

The large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the little cart. So the little cart gains half of the large cart's initial KE. So large cart's initial KE is 2m v². Half is m v². So small cart gains m v².

So small cart's KE after collision is m v². So (1/2)m v1²=m v² → v1²=2 v² → v1=√2 v.

So the answer should be option I.

But then why does the conservation approach give a different answer?

Ah, perhaps because I made a mistake in the setup. Let me recheck.

In the conservation approach, I have:

Equation 1: 4v = v1 +4v2.

Equation 2: 4v² =v1² +4v2².

Solving these gives v1=1.6v and v2=0.6v.

But according to the problem, the small cart's KE is m v², which would require v1=√2 v≈1.414v.

This suggests that my two approaches are giving conflicting results. There's a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't as I interpreted it. Maybe the large cart loses half of its kinetic energy, not necessarily all of that loss goes to the small cart. Wait, no—since it's an elastic collision, the KE lost by one should equal the KE gained by the other.

Wait, in an elastic collision, the total KE is conserved. So KE lost by large cart should equal KE gained by small cart.

So if the large cart loses half of its KE, that's m v², so the small cart gains m v².

So in the conservation approach, the small cart's KE is (1/2)m v1² = m v² → v1=sqrt(2)v.

So in that case, perhaps the mistake is in the earlier step where I used equation 2 as 4v² =v1² +4v2².

Wait, where did I get equation 2? It was from conservation of KE.

Wait, the initial total KE is 2m v². After collision, it's (1/2)m v1² + (1/2)(4m)v2².

So 2m v² = (1/2 m v1²) + 2m v2².

Multiply both sides by 2: 4m v² = m v1² +4m v2² → 4v² =v1² +4v2².

Which is correct.

So substituting v1=1.6v and v2=0.6v into equation 2:

v1²=2.56v², 4v2²=4*(0.36v²)=1.44v².

So v1² +4v2²=2.56v² +1.44v²=4v². Which matches equation 2. So that's correct.

But according to the problem, the small cart's KE should be m v², which would require v1=√2 v≈1.414v. But in this solution, v1=1.6v, which gives KE of 1.28 m v². So that's inconsistent.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the problem statement is different. Let me read it again.

"The large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the little cart."

So the large cart's KE is halved. So its final KE is (1/2)(2m v²)=m v². So the small cart's KE is m v².

But in the solution from the conservation equations, the small cart's KE is 1.28 m v², which is more than m v².

So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem says the large cart loses half of its kinetic energy, but not necessarily all of it to the small cart. No, that can't be—it's a two-body collision, so the only other body is the small cart. So all the KE lost by the large cart must be gained by the small cart.

So the small cart's KE is m v², meaning v1=√2 v.

But the conservation approach gives a different velocity. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the large cart loses half its KE, but in the conservation approach, the KE loss is different.

Wait, in the conservation approach, the large cart's final KE is (1/2)(4m)(0.6v)^2= 2m*(0.36v²)=0.72 m v². Its initial KE was 2m v², so it lost 1.28 m v².

Which would mean the small cart gained 1.28 m v², which is consistent with v1=1.6v.

But the problem states that the large cart loses half its KE. So half of 2m v² is m v². So it should have lost m v², not 1.28 m v².

Ah, so there's a contradiction. That suggests that the initial assumption in the problem leads to a different solution than the conservation approach. Therefore, perhaps the problem is designed so that the initial assumption (using KE loss) gives a different answer, but the correct approach is to use the conservation equations.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because both should align. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not an elastic collision, but the question says it's elastic. So that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that in an elastic collision, both KE and momentum are conserved. So the correct approach must satisfy both.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial KE approach. Let me think again.

In the problem, the large cart loses half its KE to the small cart. So the small cart gains m v².

So the small cart's velocity is sqrt(2) v. But according to the conservation equations, that's only possible if the large cart's velocity after collision is v2= (v + sqrt(2) v)/(4).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try to approach this again.

Let me denote:

Initial KE of large cart: (1/2)(4m)v² = 2 m v².

After collision, KE of large cart is 2 m v² - m v² = m v².

So (1/2)(4m)v2² = m v² → 2m v2² =m v² → v2²= v²/2 → v2= v/√2 ≈0.707
