Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's read it again. The question is about a phenomenon where like-minded groups take more extreme positions than the individuals in the group. Hmm, I remember learning about some group behavior concepts in psychology.

The options are A through J. Let me think about each term. 

First, option A is group polarization. I think that's when a group's decision becomes more extreme than the individual opinions. Like, if everyone is leaning in a certain direction, the group pushes it further. That sounds familiar. So group polarization might be the answer.

Option B is deindividuation. That's when individuals lose their sense of self in a group, leading to sometimes impulsive behavior. Like in mobs or riots. Doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about taking more extreme positions, not losing identity.

Option C: group escalation. I'm not too sure, but I think this might relate to escalating commitment, like when a group keeps investing in a failing decision because they've already committed so much. Not exactly about becoming more extreme in positions.

Option D: conformity pressure. That's about individuals conforming to the group's norms, even if they disagree. Like the Asch experiment. But this is more about the group becoming more extreme than individuals, not just conforming.

Option E: groupthink. Yeah, groupthink is when a group makes irrational decisions because they don't want to dissent. It leads to poor decisions but not necessarily more extreme positions. Though, groupthink can sometimes lead to more extreme outcomes because they're not considering alternatives, but I'm not sure if that's the exact term here.

Option F: shared identity effect. I think this is when group members identify strongly and make decisions based on that identity. Maybe related, but not exactly the concept described.

Option G: group conformity. Similar to D, this is about conforming to the group's norms, not necessarily becoming more extreme.

Option H: social facilitation. That's when being in a group improves performance, especially in simple tasks. Not related here.

Option I: social amplification. I'm not too sure about this one. It sounds like it could be about ideas spreading, but I'm not certain it's the right term for this question.

Option J: collective bias. That's a general term, but I don't think it specifically refers to the phenomenon described.

Wait, group polarization (A) definitely rings a bell. I remember it's when a group's discussion leads to a more extreme stance than the average of the individuals. For example, if people are already in favor of something, after discussing in a group, they become even more in favor. So that fits the description given in the question.

So the answer should be A: group polarization.

The term that describes the phenomenon where like-minded groups take more extreme positions than the individuals within the group is **group polarization**. This occurs when group discussions amplify the initial tendencies of the individuals, leading to more extreme decisions or positions than those held by the individuals before the group interaction.

Answer: A
