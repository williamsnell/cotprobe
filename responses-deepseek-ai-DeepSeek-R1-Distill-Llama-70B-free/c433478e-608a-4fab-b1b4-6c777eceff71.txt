Okay, so I've got this question about a complete graph. Hmm, I remember that a complete graph is one where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, like, no two vertices are left without an edge between them. The question is asking how many edges a complete graph with 10 vertices has.

Wait, I think the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph is something with combinations. Oh right, because each edge is a unique pair of vertices. So the formula is n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices. Let me think why that is. Oh yeah, because for each of the n vertices, you can connect to n-1 others, but that counts each edge twice (once from each end), so you divide by 2 to avoid double-counting.

So plugging in n=10. Let's calculate that. 10 times 9 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So the number of edges should be 45.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix it up with something else. Sometimes I confuse this with something else, like permutations. But no, in permutations, the order matters, so n(n-1) would be for ordered pairs, but edges are unordered. So yeah, it's combinations, so the formula is correct.

Let me think of a smaller example to test. Like, a triangle (3 vertices). Each vertex connects to two others. So edges would be 3. Using the formula: 3*2/2 = 3. Yep, that works. Another example: 4 vertices. Each connects to 3 others. So 4*3=12, divided by 2 is 6 edges. And a complete graph with 4 vertices (a tetrahedron) has 6 edges. So the formula works.

So applying it to 10 vertices: 10*9/2 = 45. So the answer should be 45, which is option J.

Looking back at the options, let me check. The options are A:60, B:35, C:90, D:20, E:50, F:25, G:100, H:55, I:10, J:45. So J is 45.

I think that's correct. So the answer is J.

To determine the number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices, we use the formula for a complete graph, which is given by:

\[
\text{Number of edges} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

Here, \( n = 10 \). Plugging this into the formula:

\[
\frac{10 \times 9}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, a complete graph with 10 vertices has 45 edges. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

J: 45

Answer: J
