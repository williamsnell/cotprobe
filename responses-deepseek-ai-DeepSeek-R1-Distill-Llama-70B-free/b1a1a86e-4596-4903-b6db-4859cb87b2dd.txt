Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the variance of a sample of observations: 2, 5, 7, 9, 12. Hmm, I remember that variance measures how spread out the numbers are, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think. Oh right, variance is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean. But wait, since this is a sample, not the entire population, I should use the sample variance formula, which divides by (n-1) instead of n. Oh yeah, that's to get an unbiased estimate.

First, I think I need to find the mean of these numbers. Let me add them up. 2 plus 5 is 7, plus 7 makes 14, plus 9 is 23, and then 12 brings it to 35. So the sum is 35. There are 5 numbers here, so the mean is 35 divided by 5, which is 7.

Wait, wait, the mean is 7. Now, for each number, I need to subtract the mean and square the result. Let's go through each one:

- For 2: 2 - 7 is -5. Squared is 25.
- For 5: 5 -7 is -2. Squared is 4.
- For 7: 7-7 is 0. Squared is 0.
- For 9: 9-7 is 2. Squared is 4.
- For 12: 12-7 is 5. Squared is 25.

Now, I add up all these squared differences. 25 +4 is 29, plus 0 is still 29, plus 4 is 33, and then 25 makes 58. So the sum of squared differences is 58.

Since this is a sample, I divide by (n-1), which is 5-1=4. So 58 divided by 4 is... let me calculate that. 58 รท4 is 14.5? Wait, no, wait. 4 times 14 is 56, so 58-56 is 2. So it's 14.5 exactly. Oh wait, 58/4 is 14.5. Wait, no, because 4*14 is 56, 4*14.5 is 58. So yes, 14.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 14.5. Hmm. Wait the options are A:10.2, B:10.6, C:12.4, D:9.8, E:7.4, F:12.8, G:13.2, H:8.5, I:14.6, J:11.6.

Hmm, none of these are 14.5. Did I do something wrong? Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum of the squared differences. Let me double-check.

Calculations again:

2,5,7,9,12.

Mean is 7.

Each (x - mean)^2:

(2-7)^2 = (-5)^2 =25.

(5-7)^2=(-2)^2=4.

(7-7)^2=0^2=0.

(9-7)^2=2^2=4.

(12-7)^2=5^2=25.

Sum: 25+4=29, +0=29, +4=33, +25=58. So that's correct.

So sum is 58, n=5, so sample variance is 58/(5-1) =58/4=14.5.

Wait, but none of the options match 14.5. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: I is 14.6, which is close but not exact. But maybe I made an error in the initial calculation. Or perhaps the question is about population variance, not sample variance.

Wait, the question says "variance of the sample", so it's the sample variance, which uses n-1. So that's correct. But let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mean. Let me compute the mean again.

2 +5 is 7, +7 is 14, +9 is 23, +12 is 35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So that's correct.

Wait, am I confident that the calculation is correct? Maybe I should try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the population variance, not sample variance. Let me recalculate with that assumption.

If I use population variance, I divide by n, which is 5. So 58/5 is 11.6. Hmm, looking at the options, option J is 11.6. So that would be the answer if it's population variance.

But the question says "sample of observations", so I think sample variance is intended. But the options don't have 14.5. Wait, let me check if perhaps I miscalculated the sum of squares. Maybe I added wrong.

Wait 25 (from 2) +4 (from5)=29. Then 0 from7, 4 from9, 25 from12.

Wait 25+4 is 29, plus 4 is 33? Wait no, 29+0 is 29, plus 4 is 33, plus 25 is 58. So that's correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6, but that would be population variance. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the data is considered as a population, not a sample. So if the question is about the population variance, then 58/5 is 11.6, which is option J.

But the question says "sample of observations", so the sample variance should be used, which is 14.5. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects population variance. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the sum of the squared differences.

2: (2-7)^2=25.

5:5-7 is -2, squared is 4.

7:0.

9:2, squared 4.

12:5, squared 25.

So sum is 25+4=29, 29+0=29, 29+4=33, 33+25=58. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the sample standard deviation squared, which would be the variance. No, I think that's the same thing.

Wait, wait, maybe I miscalculated the sum of the numbers. Let me add them again. 2+5 is 7, plus7 is 14, plus9 is 23, plus12 is 35. Yes, so mean is 7.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the sample variance is sometimes calculated with n instead of n-1. Wait no, that's population variance. So perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6, but that's population variance.

Wait, the options don't include 14.5, but option I is 14.6. Close to 14.5, but not exactly. Maybe I'm miscalculating the sum of squares.

Wait, perhaps I should try another method. Maybe I was supposed to use a different formula, like the shortcut method.

The shortcut formula for variance is: sum of (x^2) minus (sum x)^2 /n.

Wait, let me try that.

Sum of x is 35.

Sum of x squared: 2^2=4, 5^2=25, 7^2=49,9^2=81,12^2=144.

Sum of x squared is 4+25=29, +49=78, +81=159, +144=303.

So sum x squared is 303.

Now, (sum x)^2 is 35^2=1225.

So for population variance: (303 - 1225/5)/5.

Wait, 1225/5 is 245. So 303-245=58. Then 58/5=11.6. So that's the population variance.

Sample variance would be 58/(5-1)=14.5.

So same results as before.

So if I take the sample variance, it's 14.5 which isn't an option. The closest option is I:14.6, but that's 0.1 off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares. Let me recalculate that.

Sum of x squared: 2^2=4, 5^2=25,7^2=49,9^2=81,12^2=144.

Adding them up: 4+25=29, +49=78, +81=159, +144=303. That's correct.

So sum x squared is 303. Sum x is 35. Sum squared is 35^2=1225.

So 303 - (35^2)/5 = 303 - 245 =58.

Population variance:58/5=11.6.

Sample variance:58/4=14.5.

Wait, but none of the options have 14.5 except I is 14.6, which is close. Did I make a mistake in the sum of squares?

Wait, maybe I should double-check each square.

2^2 is 4.

5^2 is 25.

7^2 is 49.

9^2 is 81.

12^2 is 144.

Yes, that adds up to 4+25=29 +49=78 +81=159 +144=303. So no mistake there.

Hmm. So perhaps the question intended population variance, so the answer is J:11.6.

Wait, looking back at the question, the exact wording is "variance of the sample of observations". Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, in statistics, when we talk about the variance of a sample, it's usually the sample variance (divided by n-1). But perhaps the question is using "variance" in the population sense, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me try calculating the sample variance again.

Mean is 7.

Each deviation squared: 25,4,0,4,25. Sum is 58.

Sample variance is 58/(5-1) =14.5.

But in the options, the closest is I:14.6, which is 0.1 higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the addition when summing the squared differences. Let me add them again: 25 +4 is 29, plus 0 is 29, plus4 is 33, plus25 is 58. That's correct.

Wait another idea: maybe the question is asking for the sample standard deviation, not variance. Because then, sqrt(14.5) is about 3.8, which isn't in the options either.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the sum of the numbers is correct. Let me add 2+5+7+9+12 again.

2+5=7, +7=14, +9=23, +12=35.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6, but that's population variance. Alternatively, maybe the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the sample formula. Let me think again. The formula for sample variance is sum of squared differences divided by (n-1).

Yes, that's correct. So 58/4=14.5.

But since 14.5 isn't an option, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the population variance, which would be 11.6, which is option J.

Wait, but the question says "sample of observations", which implies that it's a sample, not the entire population. So the correct approach would be to use n-1.

But since the options don't have 14.5, perhaps the question expects the population variance, so the answer would be J.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the sum of squares. Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the variance using another method.

Wait, the data set is 2,5,7,9,12.

Mean is 7.

Compute each (x_i - mean)^2:

(2-7)^2 =25

(5-7)^2=4

(7-7)^2=0

(9-7)^2=4

(12-7)^2=25.

Sum is 25+4+0+4+25=58.

Yes, same as before.

So if it's sample variance, 58/4=14.5. But no option matches. So perhaps the question intended population variance, and the correct answer is J:11.6.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different divisor, but I can't think why.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have divided by n, not n-1, because sometimes people get confused between sample and population variance.

But I think the correct approach is to use n-1 for sample variance.

In this case, with the given options, perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6, but that would be under population variance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, option I is 14.6, which is close to 14.5. Maybe I should see if perhaps I made a mistake in adding the sum of squares.

Wait, let me sum the squared differences again.

25 (from 2) +4 (from5)=29, +0=29, +4=33, +25=58. So correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is I:14.6, but I don't see how that arises. Unless perhaps I made a mistake in the mean. Let me check the mean again.

Sum is 35, divided by 5 is 7. Correct.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the variance multiplied by something else, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the data was presented differently, but I think I copied it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the variance using another approach. For example, using the formula:

variance = E[x^2] - (E[x])^2.

E[x] is the mean, which is 7.

E[x^2] is the average of the x squared values.

Sum of x squared is 4 +25 +49 +81 +144 =303.

Average x squared is 303/5=60.6.

So variance would be 60.6 - (7)^2=60.6-49=11.6.

Wait, that's the population variance. So again, 11.6 is the population variance, which is option J.

So perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6.

But the question is about the sample variance. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but I have to choose from the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the population variance despite saying "sample".

In that case, the answer would be J:11.6.

But I'm a bit confused because the question specifies "sample of observations", which usually implies using n-1. However, none of the options match that result.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations, but I've checked them multiple times and I can't find an error.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sample variance but with a rounded value. For example, 14.5 is approximately 14.6, which is option I. But 14.5 is exactly halfway between 14 and 15, so it would round to 14.5, not 14.6. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mean was miscalculated as 7.2 or something, but that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the variance step by step again.

Data: 2,5,7,9,12.

Mean = 35/5=7.

Deviations: (2-7)=-5, (5-7)=-2, (7-7)=0, (9-7)=2, (12-7)=5.

Squares:25,4,0,4,25.

Sum of squares=58.

Sample variance=58/(5-1)=14.5.

So no, I don't see any error here.

Wait, perhaps the question had a typo, and the data is different. But I can only work with what's given.

Given that, the correct sample variance is 14.5, which isn't an option. But the closest is I:14.6. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to use n instead of n-1, which would give 11.6 (option J).

I think the intended answer is J:11.6, assuming the question expects population variance despite the wording. Or perhaps I made a mistake, but I can't see where. 

Wait, perhaps I should check with another method. Let me calculate the sample variance using the formula sum(x^2) - (sum x)^2 / (n-1) * n/(n-1).

Wait no, that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should use Excel or a calculator, but I can't do that here.

I think I'll have to go with the sample variance being 14.5, which isn't an option, but perhaps the intended answer is J:11.6, so I'll select that.

To find the variance of the sample of observations 2, 5, 7, 9, 12, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the mean**:  
   The sum of the observations is \( 2 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 12 = 35 \).  
   The mean is \( \bar{x} = \frac{35}{5} = 7 \).

2. **Compute the squared differences from the mean**:  
   For each observation \( x_i \), calculate \( (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \):  
   - \( (2 - 7)^2 = 25 \)  
   - \( (5 - 7)^2 = 4 \)  
   - \( (7 - 7)^2 = 0 \)  
   - \( (9 - 7)^2 = 4 \)  
   - \( (12 - 7)^2 = 25 \)  

   The sum of these squared differences is \( 25 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 25 = 58 \).

3. **Calculate the variance**:  
   Since this is a sample, the sample variance is calculated by dividing the sum of squared differences by \( n-1 \):  
   \[
   s^2 = \frac{58}{5-1} = \frac{58}{4} = 14.5
   \]

4. **Compare with the options
