Okay, so I've got this question about categorical grants. Hmm, I remember from my government class that grants are a way the federal government gives money to states or local governments. But wait, what's the difference between categorical and block grants?

Categorical grants are for specific purposes, right? Like, the money has to be used for a particular program or project. They usually come with strings attached, so the states can't just use them however they want. On the other hand, block grants give states more flexibility because they can use the money for a broader category of activities, not just one specific thing.

Let me look at the options one by one. The question is asking which is an example of a categorical grant.

Option A: Money for military defense. Wait, the federal government handles military defense, so maybe this is more of a direct federal responsibility, not a grant to states. I'm not sure, but I think states don't usually get grants for military defense from the feds. So probably not A.

Option B: Loan to prevent bankruptcy. Loans are different from grants. Grants are outright gifts, while loans have to be paid back. So B is about a loan, not a grant. So B is out.

Option C: Head Start programs. Oh yeah, Head Start is a federal program aimed at early childhood education. I remember that the federal government gives money to states specifically for this purpose. That sounds like a categorical grant because it's for a specific program. So C might be the right answer.

Option D: Loan for infrastructure. Again, this is a loan, not a grant. So D is not a grant example. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Money without conditions. That sounds more like an unconditional grant, which I think is a block grant. Or maybe even general revenue sharing, which doesn't have specific uses. So E isn't categorical.

Option F: Loan to a private company. This is a loan, not a grant, and it's to a company, not a state or local government. So F is irrelevant here.

Option G: Money to cities with no specific use. That seems like a block grant or general grant, where the city can decide how to use the funds. So G isn't categorical.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C: money given for Head Start. That's a specific program, fitting the definition of a categorical grant.

The correct answer is C: money given by the federal government to states to fund Head Start early education programs. This is an example of a categorical grant because it is provided for a specific purpose and must be used accordingly.

Answer: C
