Question:

For a class project, a student wants to see if boys and girls at their large high school differ in the number of contacts they have stored in their phone. The student conducts a survey of 50 randomly sampled boys and 40 randomly selected girls, and asks them to report the number of contacts. Which of the following is true about this situation?

Options:

A: Because the sample sizes are both less than 50, the student should not use a two-sample t-test.
B: Because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, the student shoulduse a two-sample t-test.
C: Because the student is testing for a difference in means, they should use a paired t-test.
D: Because the student is comparing two groups, they should use a Mann-Whitney U test.
E: Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.
F: Because the sample sizes are different, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.
G: Because the student is comparing two groups, they should use an ANOVA test.
H: Because the student is comparing two groups, they should use a one-sample t-test.
I: Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the student should use a Chi-square test.
J: Because the shape of the population distribution is not known, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.

Okay, so I have this statistics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a student's class project. The student wants to see if boys and girls at their high school differ in the number of contacts they have stored in their phones. They surveyed 50 boys and 40 girls randomly selected. The question is asking which of the options A-J is true about this situation.

The options are about choosing the correct statistical test to apply here. I remember that different tests are used for different scenarios, so I need to figure out which one applies here.

First, I need to understand what the student is testing. They're comparing the number of contacts between two groups: boys and girls. So, it's a comparison of two independent groups. The variable is the number of contacts, which I believe is a quantitative (numerical) variable.

So, the key here is that we're comparing the means of two independent groups. The appropriate test for this is typically a two-sample t-test. But wait, there are conditions for using a t-test. I think the main assumptions are that the data should be normally distributed, and the variances should be equal (homoscedasticity), or if not, we use Welch's t-test which doesn't assume equal variances.

But the question doesn't provide information about the population standard deviations. The options mention whether they're known or not. Also, sample size might be a factor. Let's look at the options.

Option A says because sample sizes are both less than 50, the student shouldn't use a two-sample t-test. Wait, sample sizes here are 50 and 40. So 50 is the sample size for boys, which is exactly 50, not less. So A is incorrect because it's not both less than 50.

Option B says because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, use a two-sample t-test. That sounds plausible because when population SDs are unknown, we use t-tests. But I also need to check if the other conditions are met, like normality. But the question doesn't say anything about the data distribution, so maybe we have to assume that the conditions are met. So B could be correct.

Option C suggests a paired t-test because testing difference in means. Wait, no. Paired t-test is when the same subjects are measured twice, like before and after a treatment. Here, the two groups are independent (boys and girls), so it's not paired. So C is wrong.

Option D says the student should use a Mann-Whitney U test because they're comparing two groups. Mann-Whitney is a non-parametric test used when the data isn't normally distributed or when the data is ordinal. If the number of contacts is normally distributed, t-test is better. But if we don't know, sometimes people default to non-parametric tests. However, the question doesn't specify the distribution, so I'm not sure yet.

Option E: sample sizes both greater than 30, so shouldn't use two-sample t-test. Wait, no. The usual rule is that if sample size is large (>30), the Central Limit Theorem applies, and t-test can be used even if the population isn't normal. So E is incorrect because sample sizes being over 30 doesn't stop us from using a t-test; in fact, it's better because assumptions are more likely met.

Option F: student shouldn't use two-sample t-test because sample sizes are different. No, that's not right. Two-sample t-tests can handle different sample sizes. So F is wrong.

Option G suggests using ANOVA because comparing two groups. No, ANOVA is for comparing three or more groups. Here, it's two groups, so t-test is appropriate. So G is incorrect.

Option H: use a one-sample t-test. That's when you compare a sample mean to a known population mean. Not applicable here since we have two samples. So H is wrong.

Option I: sample sizes >30, use Chi-square. Chi-square is typically used for categorical data, like counts in contingency tables. Here, the data is numerical (number of contacts), so I is incorrect.

Option J: shape of population distribution not known, so shouldn't use two-sample t-test. But if the sample sizes are large (like n>30), the t-test is robust to non-normality. Here, the samples are 50 and 40, which are both above 30. So even if the population isn't normal, the t-test can still be used. So J's reasoning is incorrect.

So, going back, the correct test here is the two-sample t-test. Now, considering the options.

Option B says that since the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, use a two-sample t-test. That makes sense. We don't know the population SDs, so we use t-test. The conditions being met would include independence, normality, and homogeneity of variance. Since the samples are large, normality might be assumed via CLT, and if variances are not known to be equal, Welch's test (which is a type of two-sample t-test without assuming equal variances) can be used.

So the correct answer should be B.

The student is comparing the number of contacts stored in phones between two independent groups: boys and girls. Since the data is quantitative and the goal is to compare means, the appropriate test is a two-sample t-test. This test is suitable when population standard deviations are unknown, and the conditions for its use (such as independence, normality, and homogeneity of variance) are assumed to be met. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because the sample sizes (50 and 40) are not both less than 50.  
- **Option B** is correct because the population standard deviations are unknown, and the conditions for a two-sample t-test are assumed to be met.  
- **Option C** is incorrect because a paired t-test is used for dependent samples, not independent groups like boys and girls.  
- **Option D** is incorrect because the Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test, which is unnecessary here if the data is assumed to be normally distributed.  
- **Option E** is incorrect because sample sizes greater than 30 do not preclude the use of a two-sample t-test; in fact, they strengthen the robustness of the test.  
- **Option F** is incorrect because two-sample t-tests can handle different sample sizes.  
- **Option G** is incorrect because ANOVA is used for comparing three or more groups, not two.  
- **Option H** is incorrect because a one-sample t-test compares a sample mean to a known population mean, which is not the case here.  
- **Option I** is incorrect because a Chi-square test is used for categorical data, not numerical data like the number of contacts.  
- **Option J** is incorrect because the t-test is robust to non-normality when sample sizes are large (e.g., >30), as is the case here.  

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as the two-sample t-test is appropriate under the given conditions.  

**Answer: B**
