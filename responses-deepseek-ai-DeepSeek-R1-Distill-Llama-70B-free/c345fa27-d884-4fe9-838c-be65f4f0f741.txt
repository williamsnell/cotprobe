Question:

A widow owned an apartment building. Several years ago, a student, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the widow. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that

Options:

A: the student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years.
B: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.
C: the student had made improvements to the property, thus extending the leasehold.
D: the student had a verbal agreement with the widow to extend the lease.
E: the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.
F: the widow had accepted rent for the following month before the three-year period ended.
G: the student was protected from eviction due to his status as a student.
H: the widow had not clearly communicated the end of the lease term.
I: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.
J: the leasehold contract was void ab initio.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about landlord-tenant law, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The scenario is about a widow who owns an apartment building. A student entered into a three-year lease agreement with her. They both signed a written lease, and the student agreed to pay $800 a month for the third-floor apartment. Now, the three-year term has expired, but the student has kept paying rent, and the widow has kept accepting it. The question is about what the student's strongest argument would be if the widow tried to evict him right after the three-year period ended, before she accepted the next rent check.

I remember that when a lease ends, what happens next depends on whether it's a term lease or a periodic tenancy. A term lease usually has a fixed duration, like a year or three years. Once that term ends, the lease is over unless it's been renewed or extended. But if the tenant stays and continues paying rent, and the landlord accepts it, the lease might automatically convert into a periodic tenancy. 

So in this case, the original lease was for three years. After that, the student kept paying, and the widow kept accepting. That probably means they went into a month-to-month tenancy because the original term ended, but they continued the arrangement without a new lease. 

If the widow wanted to evict the student right after the three years, she would need to give proper notice. For a periodic tenancy, which is usually month-to-month, the landlord typically needs to give a certain amount of notice, like 30 days, depending on the state's laws. If she didn't give that notice, the eviction might not hold up.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The student had a right to stay because he'd been there over three years. That doesn't sound right because the lease was for three years, and he's now on a month-to-month. The length of stay beyond the lease wouldn't automatically give him a right unless there's something else.

Option B: The widow didn't give notice for terminating a term of years. Wait, the lease was a term of years (three years), but that already ended. So she doesn't need to terminate that term anymore. So maybe this isn't the right argument.

Option C: Student made improvements. I don't think that affects the lease term; it's more about tenant rights but not directly about eviction after the term ends.

Option D: Verbal agreement. If there was a verbal agreement to extend, that could be a point, but the question says the student's strongest argument. Verbal agreements can be harder to prove, so maybe not the best option.

Option E: Lease terms are binding. The lease was for three years, so after that, it's a new arrangement. So E might not apply because the lease term ended.

Option F: Widow accepted rent before the three years ended. Wait, the eviction is after the three-year period. So if she accepted rent after, that might create a new periodic tenancy. But the question says she's trying to evict before accepting the next check. So F might not fit because it's about accepting before the period ended.

Option G: Student status. I don't think being a student gives any special protection against eviction in general.

Option H: Widow didn't communicate the lease end. But the lease ended by its own terms, so maybe notice wasn't needed unless they were continuing. Not sure.

Option I: Widow didn't give notice for terminating a periodic tenancy. That sounds right because after the lease ended, they were in a month-to-month. To evict, she needs to give proper notice (like 30 days). If she didn't, the eviction could be invalid.

Option J: Lease was void. Unlikely, as they both signed and it was a valid agreement.

So the strongest argument is probably I: she didn't give notice for terminating a periodic tenancy because after the lease ended, they were in a periodic tenancy, and she needs to follow the rules for ending that.

The question revolves around landlord-tenant law, specifically addressing the situation where a three-year lease has expired, but the tenant (student) continues to pay rent, and the landlord (widow) accepts it. This arrangement likely converts the tenancy into a month-to-month (periodic tenancy) after the fixed term ends. If the widow attempts to evict the student immediately after the three-year period without proper notice, the student's strongest argument would be that the widow failed to provide the requisite notice for terminating a periodic tenancy.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **A:** The student's right to stay is not based on the duration of occupancy but on the terms of the tenancy. This option is incorrect.  
- **B:** The lease was a term of years (three years), which already expired. The widow does not need to terminate a term of years again, so this option is irrelevant.  
- **C:** Improvements to the property do not extend the lease term or prevent eviction. This option is not applicable.  
- **D:** A verbal agreement to extend the lease could be a potential argument, but it is weaker than the requirement for proper notice in a periodic tenancy.  
- **E:** The lease terms were binding for the three-year period, but they do not apply after the lease expired. This option is incorrect.  
- **F:** The widow's acceptance of rent before the three-year period ended does not directly apply since the eviction is attempted after the lease expired.  
- **G:** The student's status as a student does not provide special protection against eviction. This option is incorrect.  
- **H:** The lease ended by its own terms, so the widow's communication about the end of the lease is not the central issue.  
- **I:** After the lease expired, the tenancy became periodic (month-to-month). To evict, the widow must provide proper notice, which she failed to do. This is the strongest argument.  
- **J:** There is no indication the lease was void ab initio, so this option is incorrect.  

The correct answer is **I**, as the widow's failure to provide proper notice for terminating a periodic tenancy is the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction.
