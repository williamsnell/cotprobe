Question:

A 72-year-old woman who has smoked 20 cigarettes daily for the past 38 years begins using eyedrops for glaucoma. Three days later, she has a marked increase in shortness of breath while walking up a flight of stairs. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of the development of shortness of breath in this patient?

Options:

A: Dorzolamide
B: Epinephrine
C: Brimonidine
D: Acetazolamide
E: Travoprost
F: Timolol
G: Apraclonidine
H: Bimatoprost
I: Latanoprost

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient who starts using eyedrops for glaucoma and then experiences shortness of breath. Hmm, I need to figure out which drug is causing this. Let's break it down.

The patient is a 72-year-old woman who's been smoking a pack a day for 38 years. That's a heavy smoking history, so she's probably at risk for COPD or other respiratory issues. She starts using eyedrops and three days later has trouble breathing when walking stairs. So the eyedrop is likely the culprit.

I remember that glaucoma medications can have different mechanisms. Let's look at the options:

A: Dorzolamide. That's a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. I think it's used topically, and side effects include taste changes and maybe some local irritation, but not sure about respiratory issues.

B: Epinephrine. It's an adrenergic agonist. Wait, but epinephrine can cause various systemic effects. If it's in the eye, maybe some absorption could affect the heart or cause bronchodilation or constriction? Not sure.

C: Brimonidine. That's an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. It can cause dry mouth, drowsiness, and maybe some local effects, but I don't recall it causing significant respiratory problems.

D: Acetazolamide. That's an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. It's used for glaucoma but has more systemic side effects like paresthesias, kidney stones... Not sure about SOB.

E: Travoprost. Prostaglandin analog, used to reduce intraocular pressure. Side effects might include eye color change, eyelash growth, but not respiratory.

F: Timolol. Oh wait, that's a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers can cause bronchospasm, especially in people with asthma or COPD. Since she's a smoker, maybe she has some underlying lung disease. Beta-blockers, especially non-selective ones like timolol, can worsen breathing.

G: Apraclonidine. Another alpha agonist, similar to brimonidine. Probably not related to SOB.

H: Bimatoprost. Another prostaglandin analog, similar to travoprost. Unlikely to cause breathing issues.

I: Latanoprost. Also a prostaglandin analog. Same as above.

So, putting it together. The patient started with an eyedrop and now has SOB. The most likely culprit is a beta-blocker, which is Timolol (option F). Beta-blockers can cause bronchial constriction, especially in susceptible individuals. Even though it's an eye drop, some systemic absorption can occur. For someone with a smoking history, her airways might already be compromised, so the beta-blocker effect could lead to increased shortness of breath.

The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a significant smoking history, which puts her at risk for underlying respiratory conditions such as COPD. She begins using eyedrops for glaucoma and three days later experiences shortness of breath, suggesting the eyedrop is the cause. Among the options:

- **Timolol (F)** is a beta-blocker, which can cause bronchospasm, particularly in individuals with compromised respiratory systems. Systemic absorption from the eyedrop could exacerbate breathing difficulties in this patient.
- Other options like **Dorzolamide (A)**, **Brimonidine (C)**, **Travoprost (E)**, **Bimatoprost (H)**, and **Latanoprost (I)** are less likely to cause respiratory issues.
- **Epinephrine (B)**, **Apraclonidine (G)**, and **Acetazolamide (D)** are not strongly associated with shortness of breath in this context.

The most likely cause is **Timolol**, as its beta-blocking activity can worsen respiratory symptoms in susceptible individuals. 

Answer: F
