Okay, so I've got this question here about the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019. The options are from A to J, with various percentages. I need to figure out the correct answer.

Hmm, I remember that extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. I've heard about the World Bank's reports on this. I think they track these statistics. Let me try to recall. 

I remember that in the 1990s, the percentage was much higher, maybe around 35% or so. But over the years, especially with global efforts and development, that number has been going down. I think by 2015, it was around 10%, maybe a bit less. But wait, the question is about 2019, so a few years after that.

Wait, I thought the World Bank had some data showing that in 2015, the percentage was like 9.2% or something close to that. So by 2019, maybe it's a bit lower than that. But let me think again. I've heard that in recent years, progress has been slowing down a bit due to various factors like conflicts, climate change, and maybe the COVID pandemic, but wait, COVID was in 2020, so 2019 would be before that. So maybe it was still on a downward trend.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the numbers. I think the World Bank's goal was to reduce extreme poverty to below 3% by 2030, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Wait, no, the first Sustainable Development Goal is to end poverty, but the exact target is to have less than 3% living on less than $1.90 a day by 2030. So in 2015, it was around 9%, and by 2019, it must have decreased further.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the percentage in 2015 was about 7% or so. Let me double-check in my mind. No, actually, I think in 2015, it was around 9.2%, and by 2020, it dipped to about 7%. So for 2019, maybe it was around 8% or so? But looking at the options, the closest lower option is E:5% or B:10%.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the exact figure as of 2019 was about 8.2% or something like that. So if the options are 5% or 10%, which one is closer? 8% is closer to 10% than to 5%, but I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the number was lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentage was around 7% in 2019. So the closest option would be E:5%, but that's a bit lower. Or maybe B:10% is too high. Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should think about other sources.

I remember reading that in 2019, approximately 736 million people lived in extreme poverty. The world population that year was around 7.7 billion. So let's do a rough calculation: 736 million divided by 7.7 billion is roughly 0.095, or 9.5%. So that would be about 9.5%, which is closest to option B:10%. But wait, another thought: sometimes the numbers are presented as less than 10%, so maybe in 2019 it was just under 10%, making option B correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure I'm recalling is for 2020, but the question is about 2019. Let me think again. Oh wait, I think in 2019, the World Bank reported that about 9% lived in extreme poverty. So that's just under 10%, so the closest option is B:10%. But wait, the options are A:35%, B:10%, etc. So 9% would be closest to 10%, so answer B.

Wait, but I've also heard that in 2015, it was 9.2%, and in 2019, it's slightly lower, so maybe around 8.7% or so. So that's still closer to 10% than to 5%. So the answer would be B:10%.

But wait another thought: perhaps the actual figure is lower. I'm getting conflicting memories here. Let me try to think of other sources. I remember that the United Nations also tracks this. They might have similar data. Alternatively, maybe the exact figure is around 7%, which would make E:5% too low, but B:10% too high. Hmm, maybe the numbers are a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the $1.90 figure with other poverty lines. For example, sometimes people talk about $2.50 a day, which is a higher poverty line. But the question specifically mentions $1.90, which is the World Bank's extreme poverty line.

So, to sum up, I think the correct figure as of 2019 is around 9-10%, so the answer is B:10%.

As of 2019, the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) was approximately 9%. This figure is based on data from the World Bank and other sources, which reported that around 736 million people lived in extreme poverty that year, out of a global population of about 7.7 billion. While the exact percentage fluctuates slightly depending on the source, it is closest to 10%. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: 10%

Answer: B
