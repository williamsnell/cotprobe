Okay, so I have this question about ADP degradation products increasing in the blood during multiple sprint sports, and I'm supposed to choose the right option from A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biochemistry, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that when muscles are working hard, especially in high-intensity activities like sprinting, they use a lot of ATP. But the ATP stores in the muscle cells are limited, so the body needs to break down other molecules to produce more ATP quickly.

ADP is adenosine diphosphate, which is what ATP becomes when it donates a phosphate group to provide energy. So when ATP is broken down into ADP, the cell can add another phosphate to ADP to make ATP again. But during intense exercise, the demand for ATP is so high that the cell can't keep up just by recycling ADP. So the ADP gets broken down further.

I think the breakdown of ADP leads to the production of inosine monophosphate (IMP). Wait, isn't IMP part of the purine nucleotide cycle? Oh right, during intense exercise, especially anaerobic, the muscle cells break down ADP beyond just recycling to ATP. So ADP is broken down into AMP (adenosine monophosphate), which then gets deaminated to IMP. Deamination means removing an amino group, I think.

So when AMP is deaminated, it becomes IMP, and ammonia is released as a byproduct. So ammonia levels go up. That's one of the products.

Then, what happens to IMP? I recall that IMP can be broken down further. I think it gets converted into inosine, then into hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is an intermediate in purine metabolism. So hypoxanthine would be another product that increases.

Hypoxanthine can then be further metabolized. I think it's part of the pathway that produces uric acid. Oh right, because uric acid is the end product of purine degradation in humans. So when the body breaks down purines, like from ADP, uric acid is formed. So uric acid levels should increase too.

Wait, but are all these products directly from ADP breakdown? Let me make sure. ADP is broken down to AMP, which becomes IMP and releases ammonia. Then IMP becomes inosine, then hypoxanthine, and eventually uric acid. So the products would be ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid.

Looking back at the options, I need to find which option includes these three. Let's look:

Option J: Ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. That fits.

But wait, any other possibilities? Let me check the other options. Option B has ammonia, hypoxanthine, and creatinine. I don't think creatinine is related here. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate, which is a different energy system. So during sprints, creatine phosphate is used, but its breakdown product is creatinine, which is excreted. But the question is about ADP degradation products, not creatine.

So the correct products from ADP would be ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. So the correct answer is J.

During high-intensity activities like multiple sprint sports, the body's demand for ATP increases significantly. When ATP is depleted, ADP is broken down further to maintain energy production. This process involves the purine nucleotide cycle, where ADP is converted into AMP, which is then deaminated to IMP, releasing ammonia as a byproduct. IMP is further metabolized into inosine and then hypoxanthine, which is eventually converted into uric acid, the end product of purine degradation in humans.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option J** (Ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid) correctly identifies the products of ADP degradation that increase in the blood during intense exercise.
- Other options include substances like creatinine or urea, which are not directly related to ADP degradation. Creatinine, for example, is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate, not ADP.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**.
