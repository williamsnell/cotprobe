Okay, so I have this history question here asking how many states were in the Confederate States of America. Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that the Confederacy was formed during the American Civil War, right? The Civil War was from 1861 to 1865, if I recall correctly.

I think the Confederacy was made up of Southern states that seceded from the Union. But how many exactly? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. I remember that the first state to secede was South Carolina, maybe in December 1860. Then, other Southern states followed. Let me try to list them out.

Starting with South Carolina, then Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia... that's five. What about the others? Texas seceded as well, I think. Then there's Louisiana, Arkansas, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina. Oh, and Kentucky and Missouri might have been part of it too, but I'm not sure if they were fully admitted or just had some representation.

Wait, I think it's 11 states in total. Let me count again. South Carolina (1), Mississippi (2), Florida (3), Alabama (4), Georgia (5), Louisiana (6), Texas (7), Virginia (8), Arkansas (9), Tennessee (10), and North Carolina (11). That makes 11. 

But wait, sometimes I've heard people mention other states like Kentucky and Missouri. Did they officially join the Confederacy? I think they might have had some involvement but perhaps weren't fully recognized as part of the Confederate States. Or maybe they were considered border states. So, sticking to the main 11 seems right.

I also remember that the Confederate flag had 13 stars at one point, but I think that included other regions or maybe territories, not just the states. So the official number of states was 11. 

Looking at the options, option B is 11. I think that's the correct answer.

The Confederate States of America (CSA) consisted of 11 Southern states that seceded from the United States during the American Civil War. These states were South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. While some border states like Kentucky and Missouri had sympathies or partial involvement with the Confederacy, they were not officially part of the CSA. Therefore, the correct number of states in the Confederacy is 11.

Answer: B
