Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral of A dot da over the surface S. Hmm, I remember that this is a surface integral, and the vector field A is given as x i - y j + z k. The surface S is a closed cylinder defined by x² + y² = c², with top at z=d and bottom at z=0. Alright, I need to find the value of this integral.

Wait, I think this is a job for the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the divergence of the field in the volume enclosed. So the integral of A · da over S should be equal to the integral of the divergence of A over the volume inside S.

Right, so first I should compute the divergence of A. The divergence is the sum of the partial derivatives of each component. So for A = x i - y j + z k:

div A = ∂(x)/∂x + ∂(-y)/∂y + ∂(z)/∂z.

Calculating each term: ∂x/∂x is 1, ∂(-y)/∂y is -1, and ∂z/∂z is 1. Adding them up: 1 -1 +1 = 1. So the divergence is 1. That simplifies things because the integral over the volume becomes just the integral of 1 dV, which is the volume enclosed by S.

Now, S is a cylinder with radius c and height d. The volume of a cylinder is πr²h, so here it's π c² d. So the integral should be π c² d. Looking at the options, option A is π c² d. That seems to be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. The surface S includes the top and bottom disks as well. When applying the divergence theorem, the closed surface includes all faces, but in this case, since the divergence is 1, the flux through the entire closed surface would equal the volume. But does the original integral include the top and bottom surfaces?

The problem says S is the closed surface defined by the cylinder. So yes, the integral includes the curved side, top, and bottom. But according to the divergence theorem, the total flux through all these surfaces is the volume times divergence, which is 1. So the integral would be π c² d, which matches option A.

But wait, let me make sure. Is there any chance that the divergence theorem doesn't apply here? No, because S is a closed surface. So yes, the divergence theorem should work.

Alternatively, I could compute the flux directly, but that might be more complicated. Let me think: the integral is the sum of the flux through the curved side, the top, and the bottom.

But since the divergence is 1, using the theorem is smarter. So I think I'm confident the answer is A. But wait, let me double-check the options. Option A is π c² d. Yep, that's the same as the volume.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the divergence. Let me check again. A is x i - y j + z k.

So ∂(x)/∂x is 1, ∂(-y)/∂y is -1, ∂(z)/∂z is 1. Sum is 1 -1 +1 = 1. Yeah, that's correct.

So the integral is the volume, which is π c² d. So the correct answer is A.

To solve the integral $\int_S \mathbf{A} \cdot d \mathbf{a}$, where $\mathbf{A} = x \mathbf{i} - y \mathbf{j} + z \mathbf{k}$ and $S$ is the closed surface of the cylinder $x^2 + y^2 = c^2$ with $z$ ranging from $0$ to $d$, we can use the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem states:

\[
\int_S \mathbf{A} \cdot d \mathbf{a} = \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) \, dV,
\]

where $V$ is the volume enclosed by $S$. First, we compute the divergence of $\mathbf{A}$:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = \frac{\partial (x)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (-y)}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial (z)}{\partial z} = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to the volume of the cylinder. The volume of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h = \pi c^2 d,
\]

where $r = c$ is the radius and $h = d$ is the height. Therefore, the value of the integral is $\pi c^2 d$.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: $\pi c^2 d$**
