Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about determining the focal length of a glass lens. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the focal length of a lens is related to its refractive index and the radii of curvature of its surfaces. Oh right, the lensmaker's formula! I think the formula is 1/f = (n-1) * (1/r1 - 1/r2) when the lens is thin and surrounded by air.

Wait, the problem says the lens is made of glass with index 1.5, surrounded by air. So the refractive index n is 1.5. The two radii are r1 = +10 and r2 = +9. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, the signs of the radii matter. R1 is the radius of the first surface, which is convex because it's positive. And r2 is also positive, so that's convex too. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. For a lens, if r1 is positive, the first surface is convex when looking from the outside. Similarly for r2. But wait, in the lensmaker's formula, the signs depend on whether the surface is facing towards the incoming light or away. Or wait, maybe the standard formula considers the first radius as positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light, which is usually the case for the first surface. 

Wait, the lensmaker's formula for a thin lens is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ], right? Or is it (1/r1) + (1/r2)? No, no, I think it's (1/r1 - 1/r2). Because for a double convex lens, both r1 and r2 are positive, so 1/r1 -1/r2 would be positive, making 1/f positive, so f positive, which is correct for a converging lens.

So given that, let's compute part a) first, which is when the lens thickness is zero. So the thin lens approximation holds, and I can directly apply the formula.

So substituting the values:
n = 1.5.
r1 = 10 units.
r2 = 9 units.

So,

1/f = (1.5 - 1) * (1/10 - 1/9)

Wait, what's 1/10 minus 1/9? Let me calculate that. 1/10 is 0.1, 1/9 is approximately 0.1111. So 0.1 - 0.1111 is negative 0.0111. Oh wait, that would make 1/f negative. But wait, if I have a lens with both radii positive, is that a diverging lens? Because if 1/f is negative, f is negative, which would mean a diverging lens. But a double convex lens should be converging, so maybe I messed up the signs of the radii.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. What's the correct formula? Oh wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/r1) + (1/r2) ) ] ? No, that doesn't sound right. Or maybe I have the sign conventions wrong for r2.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the lensmaker's equation properly. The formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ), but I need to make sure about the signs of r1 and r2. 

In the standard lensmaker's formula, r1 is the radius of the first surface (the one the light hits first), and r2 is the radius of the second surface. The sign conventions are as follows: r is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light, and negative if concave. So for a biconvex lens (both surfaces convex), r1 is positive, and r2 is negative? Or wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, no. Let me think. Wait, for a double convex lens, the first surface is convex outward (so r1 positive), the second surface is also convex outward, but when light exits the lens, the curvature is in the same direction as the first surface. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to recall. Oh wait, maybe I had it backwards. The correct formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/r1) + (1/r2) ) ] when the lens is surrounded by air, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I'm getting the signs wrong. 

Let me think about a simple case. For a plano-convex lens, where one surface is flat (r2 is infinite), then the formula becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/r1 + 0). So if r1 is positive, 1/f is positive, so f is positive, which is correct for a converging lens. So in that case, the formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/r1). So that suggests that the formula is 1/f = (n-1)[(1/r1) + (1/r2)], but wait, when r2 is infinite, 1/r2 is zero. Hmm, but in the case when the lens is biconvex, let's see.

Wait, maybe I should get the signs right. Let me think about the signs again. For a double convex lens, the first radius r1 is positive because the surface is convex towards the incoming light. The second surface is convex away from the incoming light, so perhaps r2 is negative? Because when the light comes out, the curvature is in the opposite direction. So in that case, r2 would be negative. So for a biconvex lens, r1 is positive, r2 is negative. Wait, but in the problem, both r1 and r2 are given as positive, which would imply that maybe the lens is not a conventional biconvex lens but perhaps a different configuration. Or maybe the problem assumes a different sign convention.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering both r1 and r2 as positive because the lens is surrounded by air on both sides, but perhaps it's a biconvex lens. So maybe the correct formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ) ].

Wait, let's try that. So for part a), r1=10, r2=9.

So 1/r1 is 0.1, 1/r2 is approximately 0.1111.

So 1/r1 - 1/r2 = 0.1 - 0.1111 = -0.0111.

Multiply by (n-1) which is 0.5: 0.5 * (-0.0111) = -0.00555.

So 1/f = -0.00555 → f ≈ -180 units.

Wait, that would make the focal length negative, meaning a diverging lens. But a double convex lens should be converging. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/r1) + (1/r2) ) ].

Wait, in that case, 1/r1 + 1/r2 = 0.1 + 0.1111 ≈ 0.2111.

Multiply by 0.5: 0.5 * 0.2111 ≈ 0.10555.

So 1/f = 0.10555 → f ≈ 9.49 units. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ 1/r1 - (-1/r2) ) ]? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's (1/r1 - 1/r2) when the lens is in air on both sides. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the lensmaker's equation. Wait, I can't, but I remember that the formula is:

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ]

But wait, if r1 and r2 are both positive, as in the problem statement, then 1/r1 - 1/r2 would be negative here, because 1/10 is 0.1, and 1/9 is ~0.111, so 0.1 - 0.111 = -0.011. So (n-1) is 0.5, so 0.5 * (-0.011) = -0.0055, so 1/f = -0.0055 → f ≈ -181.8 units. So about -180 units.

But a negative focal length would imply a diverging lens, which doesn't make sense for a lens with both surfaces convex. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the problem is using a different sign convention. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/r1) + (1/r2) ) ].

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: for a thin lens in air, the lensmaker's formula is:

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ) ]

But the signs of r1 and r2 depend on the direction of curvature relative to the incoming light. So for a surface that's convex when viewed from the incoming side, r is positive. Concave would be negative.

So for a biconvex lens, the first surface (r1) is positive because it's convex towards the incoming light. The second surface is also convex towards the incoming light? Wait, no. When the light exits the lens, it's leaving from the second surface. So if the second surface is convex, it's convex towards the inside of the lens, so from the perspective of the exiting light, it's concave. So for the second surface, when it's convex towards the outside (as in a biconvex lens), r2 would be negative because the center of curvature is on the same side as the incoming light. Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct signs are that for a biconvex lens, r1 is positive and r2 is negative. So when both r1 and r2 are positive, perhaps it's a different type of lens, maybe a meniscus lens.

Wait, but the problem states that r1 and r2 are both positive: +10 and +9. So maybe it's a plano-convex lens with a very short radius on the second surface? Or perhaps it's a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the lens is actually a diverging lens because both surfaces contribute in a way that the overall power is negative. So the focal length is negative, which would correspond to a diverging lens.

So, in part a), when the thickness is zero, the focal length is negative 180 units. So f = -180 units.

Now, looking at the options, let's check which ones have a) as -180. Let's look:

Option D: a) -180, b) 180

Option E: a) -270, b) -180

Option J: a) -180, b) -270

So possible options are D, J.

Now part b) is when the thickness is +1. Hmm, I'm not sure how the thickness affects the focal length. Wait, the lensmaker's formula is for thin lenses, where the thickness is negligible. When the lens has a finite thickness, do I need to adjust the formula?

Wait, I think when the lens is not thin, the formula becomes more complicated, involving the thickness, but I don't remember the exact correction. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approximation or a modified formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula when the lens has a finite thickness is:

1/f = (n - 1)[ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ) ] + (thickness term?)

Alternatively, maybe the formula becomes:

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ) ] + ( (n) * (d) ) / (n-1) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the thick lens formula. The thick lens formula, also known as the lensmaker's equation for thick lenses, is:

1/f = (n - 1) [ 1/r1 - 1/r2 + (d)/(n r2) ) ]

Wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is adjusted by the thickness in a different way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the effective radii change when the lens has a finite thickness. Or maybe the distance between the principal planes is affected, but I'm not sure how that ties into the focal length.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using an approximation where when the lens is thick, the focal length is calculated differently. But I'm not exactly clear on this.

Wait, perhaps the given lens has a thickness t = +1. So maybe the formula adjusts as:

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ] - (n * t)/(n-1)

Wait, that's a guess. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the lensmaker's formula for a thick lens is:

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ] + (t * (n) )/(n-1)

Hmm, but I don't remember the exact expression. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, maybe I can recall that for a thick lens, the formula becomes:

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ] + (d)/(n r2)

Wait, but I'm not certain. This is getting complicated, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the same formula as part a), but with a different sign for r2 because the lens has a finite thickness. Or maybe the lensmaker's formula is adjusted by the thickness in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking to compute the same formula as in part a), but with the addition that the lens has a certain thickness. But in the thin lens approximation, the thickness is neglected, so maybe the answer for part b) is the same as part a). But looking at the options, none of them have the same value for a) and b) except perhaps option F, but that has a) 180 and b) -180, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps when the thickness is considered, the formula changes, but I don't remember how. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the same formula but with a different value for r2 because of the lens's thickness.

Wait, perhaps the lens's thickness affects the radii of curvature. For example, the second radius might be adjusted by the thickness. Let me think: if the lens is a certain thickness, then perhaps the second radius is not exactly r2 but r2 plus the thickness. Or maybe it's r2 minus the thickness. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the lens's thickness t, perhaps the effective radius for the second surface is r2 + t. Because if the lens is thicker, the radius on the second surface would effectively be larger. But I'm not certain if that's correct.

Wait, if the lens has thickness t, then the distance between the two surfaces along the optical axis is t. So the center of curvature for the second surface would be at a distance r2 from the second surface. But if the lens's thickness is t, then the center of curvature of the second surface would be at r2 from the second surface, which is on the same side as the first surface. So perhaps the effective radius for the second surface, as seen from the first surface, is r2 + t. Hmm, maybe.

So perhaps when the lens has a thickness t, the formula becomes:

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/r1) - (1/(r2 + t)) ) ]

So for part b), t=1. So r2 would be 9 + 1 = 10.

Wait, let's try that.

So for part b), r1 remains 10, and r2 becomes 10 (since 9 +1 =10). So:

1/r1 = 0.1,

1/(r2 + t) = 1/10 = 0.1.

So 1/r1 - 1/(r2 + t) = 0.1 - 0.1 = 0.

So 1/f = (1.5 -1) * 0 = 0 → f is infinite. But that's not possible. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps when the lens has a thickness t, the formula for 1/f is adjusted by (n-1) [ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ] + (t (n))/(n-1). But I'm just making this up now.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

1/f = (n - 1)[ (1/r1) - (1/r2) ) ] + t/(n f_{thin})

But I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated, and I'm probably overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps part b) doesn't require any adjustment because the thickness is given, but the problem says "when the lens thickness is zero" for part a), and "when the thickness is +1" for part b). Maybe in part a), the lens is thin, so we use the standard formula, and in part b), the lens is thick, so perhaps the focal length changes.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the lens is thick, the radii are measured from the lens's surfaces, so perhaps the second radius is actually r2 + t. So for part b), r2 = 9 + 1 =10.

So using that, let's compute part b):

1/r1 = 1/10 = 0.1,

1/r2 = 1/10 = 0.1.

So 1/r1 - 1/r2 = 0.1 -0.1=0.

So 1/f = (1.5 -1)*0 = 0 → f is infinite, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the second radius becomes r2 - t. So r2 =9-1=8.

So 1/r1=0.1,

1/r2=1/8=0.125.

So 1/r1 -1/r2=0.1-0.125= -0.025.

So 1/f= 0.5 * (-0.025) = -0.0125 → f = -80 units.

But none of the options have 80. So that's not matching
