Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding out how many kilograms of O2 are in a tank. The tank's volume is 2 cubic feet, the gauge pressure is 2000 pounds per square inch, and the temperature is 27 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I remember that to find the amount of gas, I probably need to use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But wait, let me think through each step carefully.

First, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. So I need to find n, the number of moles of O2, and then convert that into kilograms.

Wait, but the pressure given is gauge pressure. Oh right, gauge pressure is the pressure above atmospheric pressure. So I need to add atmospheric pressure to get the absolute pressure. Atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi. So 2000 psi gauge plus 14.7 psi gives 2014.7 psi absolute. I should probably round that to 2015 psi for simplicity.

Next, the volume is in cubic feet. I think the gas constant R is usually in units that involve liters or something else, so I need to make sure the units are compatible. Oh wait, R can be 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mol·R) when using imperial units. So maybe I should use that value of R.

Temperature is given in Celsius, so I need to convert that to Rankine. To convert Celsius to Rankine: T (R) = T (C) + 273.15, then multiply by 9/5. So 27 + 273.15 is 300.15 K. Multiply by 9/5: 300.15 * 9/5 = let's see, 300 * 1.8 is 540, and 0.15 *1.8 is 0.27, so total 540.27 R.

So putting it all together:

P = 2014.7 psi
V = 2 ft³
R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mol·R)
T = 540.27 R

Wait, PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT)

So n = (2014.7 psi * 2 ft³) / (10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mol·R) * 540.27 R)

Let me compute the denominator first. 10.7316 * 540.27 ≈ let's see, 10 * 540 is 5400, 0.7316*540 is about 395. So total approximately 5795. So 2014.7 * 2 is 4029.4, divided by 5795 gives approx 0.695 lb-moles.

Wait, more accurately, let's compute the denominator: 10.7316 * 540.27.

10.7316 * 540 = 10.7316 *500=5365.8, 10.7316*40=428.264. So 5365.8 +428.264 =5794.064. Then 10.7316 * 0.27 = approx 2.897. So total denominator is 5794.064 + 2.897 ≈ 5796.96.

So n = (2014.7 * 2) / 5796.96 = 4029.4 /5796.96 ≈ 0.695 lb-mol.

Wait, maybe I should calculate that more accurately. Let me get the exact numbers.

2014.7 * 2 = 4029.4.

10.7316 * 540.27 = let me compute that precisely. 540.27 *10 is 5402.7, 540.27 *0.7316. Let me compute 0.7*540.27=378.189; 0.0316*540.27≈17.07. So 378.189 +17.07≈395.259. So total is 5402.7 + 395.259 =5797.959.

So n = 4029.4 /5797.959 ≈ 4029.4 /5798 ≈ approx 0.695 lb-mol.

Now, how many kg is that? Because the molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol.

So n * molar mass = 0.695 lb-mol * 32 g/mol = wait, no, wait, wait. No, wait, lb-mol is pounds-mole. So the molar mass is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol, but since we're dealing with pounds, maybe I should convert lb-mol to kg.

Wait, 1 lb-mol is the amount of substance whose mass is equal to the molecular weight in pounds. So O2 has a molecular weight of 32 g/mol, which is 32/453.592 = approximately 0.0705 lb/mol. Wait, no, wait, that's not it. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert lb-mol to kg. Because 1 lb is 0.453592 kg. So 1 lb-mol of O2 has a mass of 32 lb (since molecular weight is 32 g/mol → 32 lb·mol⁻¹ × 453.592 g/lb → No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, the molecular weight is 32 grams per mole. So 1 mole of O2 is 32 grams. Therefore, 1 lb-mole would be 32 pounds. Because 1 lb-mol is 453.592 moles (since 1 lb is 453.592 grams, so 453.592 grams / 32 grams per mole = approx 14.16 moles → no, wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert lb-mol to kg by using the molar mass.

Let me think again. 1 lb-mol is equal to (molecular weight in lb) of substance. So O2 has a molecular weight of 32 g/mol → 32 g/mol = 0.0705 lb/mol (since 1 lb is 453.592 g → 32/453.592 = approx 0.0705 lb per mole). So 1 lb-mol of O2 would have a mass of 0.0705 lb → No, wait, that's not right. Let me think differently.

Wait, the molar mass M is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol. 1 lb = 0.453592 kg. So 1 lb-mol is (0.453592 kg) per mole? No, wait. Hmm, perhaps the confusion comes because lb can be mass or force, but in chemistry it's used as mass.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to convert lb-mol to kg using the molar mass. So 1 lb-mol = (molecular weight in lb) → since 1 lb is 0.453592 kg, then 1 lb-mol of O2 is 32 lb (since molecular weight is 32 g/mol → 32 g is 0.0705 lb, but that's not right because 32 g is 0.0705 lb, but that's per mole. Wait, this is getting me stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert lb-mol to moles by multiplying by Avogadro's number. Wait, no, lb-mol is a unit of amount of substance. So 1 lb-mol is 453.592 moles. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 mole is 6.022e23 molecules. But in terms of mass, 1 mole is the molar mass in grams. So 1 lb-mol would be 1 mole multiplied by (1 lb/0.453592 kg) → no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should convert lb-mol to kg by considering that 1 lb-mol of O2 has a mass of 32 lb (since each mole is 32 grams → 32 grams is 0.0705 lb → but that's per mole, so 1 lb-mol would be 0.0705 lb * 453.592? Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass in lb first, then convert to kg. So n is 0.695 lb-mol. Each lb-mol has a mass of 32 lb (since molecular weight is 32 g/mol → 32 g = 0.0705 lb → but that's per mole, so per lb-mol it's 0.0705 lb * 453.592 (moles per lb-mol)? No, I'm getting this wrong. Maybe better to use the formula directly.

Wait, another approach: n (lb-mol) = mass (lb) / molecular weight (lb/mol). So mass = n * molecular weight. For O2, molecular weight is 32 g/mol → which is 32/453.592 lb/mol → 32/453.592 ≈ 0.0705 lb/mol.

So mass = 0.695 lb-mol * 0.0705 lb/g·mol → Wait, no, that can't be right because the units don't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of kg.

Wait, 1 lb is 0.453592 kg. So 1 lb-mol is 453.592 moles. Because 1 mole is 0.453592 kg for O2? No, wait, 1 mole of O2 is 32 grams, 0.032 kg. So 1 lb-mol would be 453.592 times that, so 0.032 kg * 453.592 ≈ 14.515 kg per lb-mol. Wait, no, that can't be right, because that would make 1 lb-mol equal to 14.5 kg, which seems too heavy.

Wait, perhaps I should take a step back. Moles (n) multiplied by molar mass (M) gives mass in kg. So n is in lb-mol, but M is in kg per lb-mol. Wait, no. Wait, the molar mass M is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol. So if n is in lb-mol, I need to convert lb-mol to mol.

Wait, 1 lb-mol is 453.592 moles, because 1 lb is 453.592 grams, and 1 mole is 17.031 grams for H2, for example. So for O2, 1 mole is 32 grams. So 1 lb is 453.592 grams, which is 453.592 / 32 = approx 14.168 moles of O2. So 1 lb-mol = 14.168 moles.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 lb-mol is the amount of substance whose mass is equal to the molecular weight in pounds. So O2 has a molecular weight of 32 g/mol → which is 0.0705 lb/mol. So 1 lb-mol would be (32 g/mol) * (1 lb / 0.453592 kg) ? No, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the lb-mol to kg by knowing that 1 lb-mol of O2 is 32 lb (since molecular weight is 32 g/mol, 32 g is 0.0705 lb → so 0.0705 lb per mole → so per lb-mol, it's 0.0705 lb * 453.592? No, that seems wrong.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the mass in lb and then convert to kg. So n is 0.695 lb-mol. The mass in lb is n * molecular weight (lb/mol). The molecular weight is 32 g/mol → which is 0.0705 lb/mol. So mass = 0.695 * 0.0705 lb → that would be 0.695 * 0.0705 ≈ 0.049 lb. Then convert to kg: 0.049 lb * 0.453592 kg/lb ≈ 0.0222 kg. That seems way too low, considering the options are around 6-15 kg.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have messed up the unit conversions. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach: Use SI units instead of imperial. Maybe that would be easier.

So, starting over:

Pressure P: 2000 psi gauge. So absolute pressure is 2000 + 14.7 = 2014.7 psi.

Convert psi to pascals. 1 psi = 6894.76 pascals. So 2014.7 psi * 6894.76 Pa/psi ≈ let's compute that.

2014.7 * 6894.76 → 2000 * 6894.76 = 13,789,520 Pa. 14.7 * 6894.76 ≈ 101,393. So total ≈ 13,789,520 + 101,393 = 13,890,913 Pa. So about 13.89 MPa.

Volume V is 2 ft³. Convert to m³. 1 ft = 0.3048 m, so 1 ft³ = (0.3048)^3 m³ ≈ 0.0283168 m³. So 2 ft³ → 0.0566336 m³.

Temperature T is 27°C → 300.15 K.

The ideal gas constant R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So using PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT).

Compute P*V: 13,890,913 Pa * 0.0566336 m³ ≈ let's calculate that.

13,890,913 * 0.0566336 → approximately 13,890,913 * 0.05 = 694,545.65, 13,890,913 * 0.0066336 ≈ let's see, 13,890,913 * 0.006 = 83,345.478, 13,890,913 * 0.0006336 ≈ 8,799. So total ≈ 694,545.65 + 83,345.48 = 777,891.13 + 8,799 ≈ 786,690. So n ≈ 786,690 / (8.314 * 300.15).

Compute denominator: 8.314 * 300.15 ≈ 8 * 300 = 2400, 0.314*300=94.2 → 2494.2, plus 8.314*0.15≈1.247 → total ≈ 2495.447.

So n ≈ 786,690 / 2495.447 ≈ 315.3 moles.

Wait, that seems high. Because 315 moles of O2 would be 315 * 0.032 kg/mol = 10.08 kg. Hmm, looking at the options, option I is 10.1 kg, which is close. But wait, let's check the calculations more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of P*V. Let me recompute:

13,890,913 Pa * 0.0566336 m³ = ?

Let me compute 13,890,913 * 0.0566336:

Let me break it down:

13,890,913 * 0.05 = 694,545.65

13,890,913 * 0.006 = 83,345.478

13,890,913 * 0.0006336 = let's compute 13,890,913 * 0.0006 = 8,334.5478

13,890,913 * 0.0000336 = 13,890,913 * 3.36e-5 → approx 466.1

So 8,334.5478 + 466.1 ≈ 8,800.65.

Adding all together: 694,545.65 + 83,345.48 = 777,891.13 + 8,800.65 ≈ 786,691.78.

So n = 786,691.78 / (8.314 * 300.15).

Compute denominator: 8.314 * 300 = 2494.2, plus 8.314 * 0.15 = 1.2471, so total 2495.447.

n = 786,691.78 / 2495.447 ≈ let's compute this division.

2495.447 * 315 = 2495.447 * 300 = 748,634.1; 2495.447*15=37,431.705 → total 786,065.805.

But our numerator is 786,691.78, which is about 786,065 + 626 → so it's 315 + (626 / 2495.447) ≈ 315 + 0.251 ≈ 315.251 moles.

So n ≈ 315.25 moles.

Now, molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol → 0.032 kg/mol. So mass = 315.25 * 0.032 kg = 10.088 kg. That's approximately 10.1 kg, which is option I.

Wait, but let me think again. When I did the first calculation in imperial units, I got about 0.695 lb-mol, which I tried to convert to kg but messed up the units. Maybe I should try that approach again correctly.

Alternative approach using imperial units:

P = 2014.7 psi
V = 2 ft³
R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mol·R)
T = 540.27 R

n = (2014.7 * 2) / (10.7316 * 540.27)
n = 4029.4 / (5797.96) ≈ 0.695 lb-mol

Now, to find the mass in kg: 1 lb-mol of O2 is 32 lb (since molecular weight is 32 g/mol → 32 g = 0.0705 lb, but wait, no, that's per mole). Wait, perhaps 1 lb-mol is 32 lb? Because 1 mole is 32 g, so 1 lb-mol would be 32 lb.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1 lb-mol is 453.592 moles (since 1 lb is 453.592 grams → 453.592 g /32 g/mol = 14.168 moles. So 1 lb-mol is 14.168 times more than 1 mole.

Wait, so 1 lb-mol is 14.168 moles. So 0.695 lb-mol is
