Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution. Hmm, pH calculations, right? I remember that pH is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+]. Let me think about this. 

The question says that the [H+] is 6.38 × 10^-6 mole per liter. Wait, I need to find the pH from that. I think pH is calculated using the formula pH = -log[H+]. Oh right, that's the key equation here. So I need to take the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration.

Wait, logarithm base 10, right? So, let's plug in the numbers. The [H+] is 6.38e-6. So taking the log of that. But wait, I have to remember that the logarithm of a number less than 1 is negative, so taking the negative of that would make it positive.

Let me think about how to calculate this. So, log(6.38e-6) equals... Well, 6.38e-6 is the same as 6.38 × 10^-6. So the log would be log(6.38) + log(10^-6). Log(10^-6) is -6, and log(6.38) is about... I remember log(6) is around 0.778, and log(6.38) would be a bit higher. Let me calculate it more precisely.

Wait, 6.38 is between 6 and 7. Log(6)=0.7782, log(6.38)=? Hmm, let me approximate. Maybe around 0.804? Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but I think I can get a better estimate. Let me think: 10^0.8 is about 6.3, because 10^0.8 is 10^(4/5) which is approximately 6.3. Oh wait, so 10^0.8 is about 6.3. So log(6.3) is 0.8. Since 6.38 is a bit more than 6.3, maybe the log is around 0.805 or so.

So, log(6.38e-6) = log(6.38) + log(1e-6) ≈ 0.804 + (-6) = -5.196. Then pH is the negative of that, so pH = -(-5.196) = 5.196. Oh, wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait another way: since [H+] is 6.38e-6, which is 6.38 × 10^-6. So, the pH = -log(6.38e-6). Let me compute this step by step.

First, separate it into 6.38 and 1e-6. So log(6.38e-6) = log(6.38) + log(1e-6) = log(6.38) + (-6). 

I think log(6.38) is approximately 0.804, so adding that to -6 gives -5.196. So pH is -(-5.196) = 5.196.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.195, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation of log(6.38) would change it a bit. Let's see: 

Using a calculator (if I had one), log(6.38) is approximately 0.8042. So that would make the log of [H+] equal to -5.1958. So pH is 5.1958, which rounds to 5.196. So the closest option is B:5.195. Wait, but the given options don't have 5.196, so B is 5.195, which is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think about significant figures. The given [H+] has three significant figures (6.38 × 10^-6), so the pH should be reported to three decimal places. But looking at the options, option B is 5.195, which has three decimal places. So that fits.

Wait, but some of the other options: option I is 5.804. That's higher than 5.195, so probably not. Option F is 4.8, which is lower. Option H is 6.38, which is the [H+] itself, so that's not the pH. Option J is 6, which would be neutral, but the [H+] here is higher than 1e-7 (which is neutral at 7), so pH should be below 7 but above 5. 

Wait, 6.38e-6 is 6.38 × 1e-6. So 1e-6 is pH 6, but since it's higher than 1e-6 (wait no, 6e-6 is higher than 1e-6?), wait wait. No, 1e-6 is 0.000001, and 6e-6 is 0.000006, which is higher concentration of H+ ions, meaning more acidic. So pH should be lower than 6. Because pH is inversely related. So pH should be less than 6. But wait, 6.38e-6 is 6.38 × 1e-6, which is 6.38 micro molar. So that's higher acidity than 1e-6, which is pH 6. So the pH would be less than 6, right?

Wait wait, if [H+] is 1e-7, pH is 7. [H+] is 1e-6, pH is 6. So if [H+] is 6.38e-6, that's higher than 1e-6, so pH is lower than 6. So pH is about 5.195. So among the options, B is 5.195, which should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought 6e-6 is 6 times 1e-6, which would make pH lower. So pH would be around 5.2. So B is correct.

To determine the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] = 6.38 × 10⁻⁶ mole/liter, we use the formula:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H⁺]
\]

### Step 1: Break down the calculation
The given [H⁺] is \( 6.38 \times 10^{-6} \). Taking the logarithm:

\[
\log(6.38 \times 10^{-6}) = \log(6.38) + \log(10^{-6})
\]

- \(\log(10^{-6}) = -6\)
- \(\log(6.38)\) is approximately \( 0.804 \), as \( 6.38 \) is close to \( 6.3 \), where \(\log(6.3) \approx 0.8\).

Thus:

\[
\log(6.38 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 0.804 - 6 = -5.196
\]

### Step 2: Calculate pH
The pH is the negative of the logarithm:

\[
\text{pH} = -(-5.196) = 5.196
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 5.196 \) is **5.195**, which corresponds to **option B**.

### Final Answer:
B
