Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric dipoles and the force on an electron. Hmm, I remember that an electric dipole consists of two charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign, separated by a small distance. The dipole moment is p = q * d, where q is the charge and d is the separation.

The question says that the electron is on the axis of the dipole, and it's 25 nm away from the center. The dipole moment is given as 3.6e-29 C·m. I need to find the magnitude of the electrostatic force on the electron.

Wait, I think the formula for the electric field along the axis of a dipole is different from the one perpendicular to it. Oh right, along the axis (the axial line), the electric field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/(r³), where r is the distance from the center of the dipole. And perpendicular, it's E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (p)/(r³).

So since the electron is on the axis, I should use the axial formula. But wait, the electron is negatively charged, so the force direction would be opposite to the electric field. But the question just asks for magnitude, so I can ignore the direction.

The electron's charge is e = 1.6e-19 C. So the force F is e times E. So putting it all together:

E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/(r³)
F = e * E = e * (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/(r³)

Let me plug in the numbers. First, I need the constants. 1/(4πε₀) is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². Oh yeah, that's Coulomb's constant, often written as k_e.

So let's compute step by step.

p is 3.6e-29 C·m.

r is 25 nm, which is 25e-9 meters.

So r³ = (25e-9)^3 = (25)^3 * (1e-9)^3 = 15625 * 1e-27 = 1.5625e-23 m³.

Now, let's compute 2p/r³: 2 * 3.6e-29 / 1.5625e-23 = (7.2e-29) / (1.5625e-23) = Let's compute that. 7.2 / 1.5625 is approximately 4.615... so 4.615e-6.

So 7.2e-29 / 1.5625e-23 = 4.615e-6 C·m⁻³.

Wait, wait, actually 7.2e-29 divided by 1.5625e-23 is (7.2 / 1.5625) * 1e-6. Because 1e-29 / 1e-23 is 1e-6. So 7.2 / 1.5625 is, let me compute that. 1.5625 is 25/16, so 7.2 * (16/25) = (7.2 * 16)/25. 7 * 16 is 112, 0.2*16 is 3.2, total 115.2. 115.2 /25 is 4.608. So approximately 4.608e-6.

So 2p/r³ is 4.608e-6 C·m⁻³.

Now multiply by k_e (8.988e9):

8.988e9 * 4.608e-6 = Let's compute this.

8.988e9 * 4.608e-6 = 8.988 * 4.608 * 1e3.

8.988 * 4.608 = let me approximate. 9 *4.6 is 41.4; but let's be precise.

8.988 * 4.608:

Calculate 8 * 4.608 = 36.864.

Then 0.988 *4.608: 0.988 *4=3.952, 0.988 *0.608= approx 0.600. So about 3.952 + 0.6 = 4.552. So total is 36.864 +4.552=41.416.

So 41.416 *1e3 = 41416.

Wait, but wait: 8.988 *4.608 is actually 8.988 *4 =35.952, 8.988 *0.608=5.462 approx. So 35.952 +5.462=41.414. So same as before.

So that's 41.414e3 = 41414 N/C.

Wait, no, wait: 8.988e9 *4.608e-6 = (8.988 *4.608) * 1e3. Because 1e9 *1e-6 is 1e3.

So that's 41.414 * 1e3 = 41414 N/C? So E is 41414 N/C? Hmm, that seems high. Wait, but let's think again.

Wait, E is equal to k_e * 2p / r³. So E = 8.988e9 * 2*(3.6e-29)/(25e-9)^3.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the exponents.

Let me recalculate 2p/(r³):

2p = 7.2e-29 C·m.

r³ = (25e-9 m)^3 = 25^3 * (1e-9)^3 = 15625 * 1e-27 m³ = 1.5625e-23 m³.

So 7.2e-29 / 1.5625e-23 = (7.2 / 15625) * 1e-6.

Wait, no: 7.2e-29 / 1.5625e-23 is (7.2 / 1.5625) * 1e-6.

Wait, 1e-29 / 1e-23 is 1e-6.

Yes, so 7.2 /1.5625=4.608 as before. So 4.608e-6.

So E = 8.988e9 * 4.608e-6.

Multiply 8.988e9 by 4.608e-6:

8.988e9 = 8.988 *1e9.

4.608e-6 =4.608 *1e-6.

Multiply them: 8.988 *4.608 = approx 41.4, as before.

Then 1e9 *1e-6=1e3.

So 41.4 *1e3 =4.14e4 N/C.

Wait, 41,400 N/C. Hmm.

So E is 41,400 N/C.

Wait, but that's the electric field. Now, the force on the electron is F = e * E.

e is 1.6e-19 C. So F = 1.6e-19 *41400.

Calculating that:

1.6e-19 *4.14e4 = (1.6 *4.14) *1e-15.

1.6 *4.14 = 6.624.

So F =6.624e-15 N.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.6e-15, which is 6.6e-15 N. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, I thought the dipole's electric field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/(r³) for on-axis points. But I should make sure about the formula.

Yes, the electric field on the axis of a dipole is given by E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2 p) / r³.

Yes, so the calculation seems correct.

So the force is approximately 6.6e-15 N. So the answer should be option A.
</think>

To determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force on the electron, we start by using the formula for the electric field along the axis of an electric dipole:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{2p}{r^3}
\]

where:
- \( p = 3.6 \times 10^{-29} \, \mathrm{C \cdot m} \) is the dipole moment,
- \( r = 25 \, \mathrm{nm} = 25 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} \) is the distance from the center of the dipole,
- \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \) is Coulomb's constant.

### Step 1: Calculate \( r^3 \)
\[
r^3 = (25 \times 10^{-9})^3 = 25^3 \cdot (10^{-9})^3 = 15625 \cdot 10^{-27} = 1.5625 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{m^3}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \frac{2p}{r^3} \)
\[
\frac{2p}{r^3} = \frac{2 \cdot 3.6 \times 10^{-29}}{1.5625 \times 10^{-23}} = \frac{7.2 \times 10^{-29}}{1.5625 \times 10^{-23}}
\]

\[
\frac{7.2}{1.5625} \approx 4.608 \quad \text{and} \quad 10^{-29} / 10^{-23} = 10^{-6}
\]

\[
\frac{2p}{r^3} \approx 4.608 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C \cdot m^{-3}}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( E \)
\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{2p}{r^3} = 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 4.608 \times 10^{-6}
\]

\[
E \approx 41414 \, \mathrm{N / C}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the force on the electron
The force on the electron is given by:

\[
F = e \cdot E
\]

where \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) is the charge of the electron. Substituting:

\[
F = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \cdot 41414
\]

\[
F \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{N}
\]

### Final Answer:
The magnitude of the electrostatic force on the electron is approximately \( 6.6 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{N} \), which corresponds to **option A**.
