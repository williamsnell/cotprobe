Okay, so I've got this question about chick embryos and their extraembryonic membranes. Hmm, I remember that extraembryonic membranes are structures that develop alongside the embryo but aren't part of the embryo itself. They play important roles in supporting the embryo's development.

The question is asking which membrane provides nourishment to the fetus. Let me think about each option.

Option A is the amnion. I recall that the amnion forms a fluid-filled cavity around the embryo, protecting it. So it's more about protection rather than providing nutrients.

Option B is the blastoderm. Wait, the blastoderm is actually the layer of cells in early embryos that will form the embryo itself. Not an extraembryonic structure, I think.

Option C is the embryonic disc, which is part of the early embryo too. So probably not the right answer.

Option D is the chorion. The chorion in mammals is involved in the placenta, but in birds, like chick embryos, I think the chorion might contribute to gas exchange, but not directly providing nourishment.

Option E is the yolk sac. Oh right, the yolk sac is a key structure here. Chick embryos have a lot of yolk in their eggs, and the yolk sac encloses this yolk. The yolk provides nutrients, so the yolk sac must play a role in delivering these nutrients to the embryo. That sounds right.

Option F is the eggshell, which is the hard outer shell protecting the egg. Definitely not involved in providing nourishment.

Option G is the egg yolk itself. The yolk is the nutrient source, but the question is about the membrane, so G is the substance, not the membrane.

Option H is the placenta. Wait, but humans and other mammals have placentas. Chickens don't have placentas in the same way; instead, they rely on the yolk sac for nutrients.

Option I is the zona pellucida, which is a glycoprotein layer around the oocyte, I think. It's more about structural support and maybe protecting the early embryo, but not providing food.

Option J is the allantois. I remember that the allantois is involved in waste storage and also contributes to the formation of the umbilical cord in mammals. In birds, it might also help with gas exchange, like the chorion. So maybe it's involved in respiration or excretion, not the primary source of nutrients.

Putting it all together, the extraembryonic membrane that provides nourishment would be the yolk sac. So the correct answer should be E: yolk sac.

The extraembryonic membrane in chick embryos that provides nourishment to the fetus is the yolk sac. This structure encloses the yolk, which serves as the primary source of nutrients for the developing embryo. Other options, such as the amnion (protection), chorion (gas exchange), and allantois (waste storage and respiration), serve different functions, while the placenta is specific to mammals and not relevant here.
