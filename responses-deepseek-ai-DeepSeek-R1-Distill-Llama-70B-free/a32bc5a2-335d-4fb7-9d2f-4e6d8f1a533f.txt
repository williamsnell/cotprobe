Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about symbolizing a given sentence into a propositional logic (PL) formula, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

The sentence given is: "Either England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."

Hmm, breaking this down, I remember that in logic, necessary conditions and biconditionals have specific translations. Let me try to parse each part.

First part: "England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." So, necessary condition means that if France is subsidizing agriculture (F), then it must be that England is not importing beef (~E). Because for F to happen, ~E must be true. So this translates to F → ~E.

Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, necessary condition is a bit tricky. Let me think again. If A is a necessary condition for B, then B can only happen if A happens. So B → A. So in this case, the necessary condition is England not importing beef (~E) for France's action (F). So F → ~E.

Yes, that makes sense. So the first part is F → ~E.

Second part: "China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds." If and only if is a biconditional, so that's S ≡ ~C, where S is China promoting human rights and C is South Africa supplying diamonds.

Wait, wait, no, let me check the variables again. Wait, in the options, I think E, F, C, S are used. Let me make sure I'm assigning correctly.

Wait, the variables probably are:
E: England is importing beef.
F: France is subsidizing agriculture.
C: South Africa supplies diamonds.
S: China promotes human rights.

Wait, no, the second part says "China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds." So S is China promoting human rights, and ~C is South Africa not supplying diamonds. So the biconditional is S ≡ ~C.

So the second part is S ≡ ~C.

Now, the entire sentence is an OR (either/or) between the first part and the second part. So the structure is (first part) ∨ (second part).

Putting it together, the whole sentence is (F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C).

Now, I look at the options to see which matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (E ⊃ ~F) ∨ (S ≡ ~C)
Option B: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S)
Option C: (~E ⊃ ~F) ∨ (C ⊃ S)
Option D: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (~C ≡ S)
Option E: (~F ⊃ ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C)
Option F: (~E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ ~S)
Option G: (F ⊃ ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S)
Option H: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ≡ S)
Option I: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ⊃ C)
Option J: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ≡ C)

Wait, my formula is (F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C). So looking for an option that has (F → ~E) as the first part and (S ≡ ~C) as the second.

Looking through the options:

Option G is (F → ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S). Wait, no, because the second part here is C ≡ ~S, which is South Africa supplying diamonds if and only if China doesn't promote human rights. That's not what we have. Our second part is S ≡ ~C, so S (China promotes) if and only if ~C (South Africa doesn't supply diamonds). So G's second part is the inverse; it's C and ~S, which would mean South Africa supplying iff China doesn't promote. That's the opposite.

Option E is (~F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C). The first part is ~F → ~E, which is different from F → ~E. So E's first part is "if France isn't subsidizing, then England isn't importing beef." That's the converse of what we have.

Option G's first part is correct (F → ~E), but the second part is wrong (C ≡ ~S). So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the variables. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem statement says:

"Either England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."

So variables:

England not importing beef: ~E

France's subsidizing agriculture: F

So the first part: ~E is a necessary condition for F. So F → ~E.

Second part: S (China promotes human rights) if and only if ~C (South Africa doesn't supply diamonds). So S ≡ ~C.

So the formula is (F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C).

Looking again at the options:

Option G: (F → ~E) is correct for the first part. Second part is (C ≡ ~S). So that's C if and only if ~S, which is not matching because we need S ≡ ~C.

Wait, S ≡ ~C is equivalent to ~C ≡ S, which is the same as C ≡ ~S, because equivalence is symmetric. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, S ≡ ~C is the same as ~C ≡ S, which is the same as C ≡ ~S. Because equivalence is symmetric. So S ≡ ~C is equivalent to C ≡ ~S. So Option G's second part is C ≡ ~S, which is the same as S ≡ ~C. Because equivalence is symmetric.

Wait, but in the option G, it's (F → ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S). So the second part is C ≡ ~S, which is equivalent to S ≡ ~C, right? Because in equivalence, A ≡ B is same as B ≡ A. So C ≡ ~S is same as ~S ≡ C, which would mean S ≡ ~C.

Wait, let me think: If C ≡ ~S, then whenever C is true, ~S is true, and vice versa. So that's same as S being true when C is false. So yes, S ≡ ~C is same as C ≡ ~S.

So in that case, option G's second part is equivalent to what we have. So the entire formula in G is (F → ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S), which is the same as (F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C). Because equivalence is symmetric.

Wait, so would option G's formula be equivalent to our desired formula?

Yes, because (C ≡ ~S) is the same as (S ≡ ~C). So the formula in G is correct.

But wait, let me check other options just to be sure.

Option A: (E → ~F) ∨ (S ≡ ~C). The first part is E → ~F, which is different from F → ~E. So that's not correct.

Option E: (~F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C). The first part is ~F → ~E, which is the inverse of F → E. Not the same as F → ~E.

Option G: (F → ~E) is correct, and (C ≡ ~S) is same as (S ≡ ~C), so that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me recheck.

Our target formula is (F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C).

Option G is (F → ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S).

But since S ≡ ~C is the same as C ≡ ~S, because equivalence is symmetric, so yes, option G is correct.

So the answer is G.

The sentence to symbolize is: "Either England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."

### Step 1: Analyze the first part
- "England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture" translates to: If France subsidizes agriculture (F), then England is not importing beef (~E). This is written as **F → ~E**.

### Step 2: Analyze the second part
- "China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds" is a biconditional. Let S represent "China promotes human rights" and C represent "South Africa supplies diamonds." This translates to **S ≡ ~C**.

### Step 3: Combine the parts
- The sentence is an OR statement between the two parts: **(F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C)**.

### Step 4: Match with the options
- **Option G**: (F → ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S). 
  - The first part, **F → ~E**, matches the necessary condition.
  - The second part, **C ≡ ~S**, is equivalent to **S ≡ ~C** because biconditionals are symmetric. Thus, this option matches the desired formula.

### Step 5: Verify other options
- **Option A**: (E → ~F) ∨ (S ≡ ~C). The first part is incorrect because it should be **F → ~E**, not **E → ~F**.
- **Option E**: (~F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C). The first part is incorrect because it should be **F → ~E**, not **~F → ~E**.
- Other options either have incorrect connectives or do not match the required structure.

### Conclusion
The correct symbolization is **(F → ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C)**, which corresponds to **Option G**.

Answer: G
