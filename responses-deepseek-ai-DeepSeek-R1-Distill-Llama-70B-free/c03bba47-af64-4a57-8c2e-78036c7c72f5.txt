Okay, so I've got this problem here about signals and complex exponentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The problem says that the signal x1(t) is given by cos(3πt) minus 4 times cos(5πt - 0.5π). And we need to express this as the sum of two real parts of complex exponentials. The form is Real(A e^{jπ B t}) plus Real(D e^{jπ E t}), and we need to find B and E.

Wait, I remember that Euler's formula connects cosines with exponentials. Euler's formula says that e^{jθ} = cosθ + j sinθ. So the real part of e^{jθ} is just cosθ. So when you take the real part of a complex exponential like A e^{jω t}, it becomes A cos(ω t), assuming A is a real constant. But wait, in the problem statement, the coefficients might be complex? Or maybe they're real. Let me think.

Looking back, the original x1(t) is expressed using cosines with some coefficients. So to express it as a sum of Real parts of complex exponentials, I think each term will correspond to each cosine term.

Let me break down x1(t): it's cos(3πt) minus 4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). So each cosine is a separate term.

First, the term cos(3πt). Using Euler's formula, cos(θ) is the real part of e^{jθ}. So cos(3πt) is Real[e^{j 3π t}]. So in the given expression, Real(A e^{j π B t}) would correspond to this. Comparing, the exponent is j π B t. So to match 3π t, we have π B t = 3 π t. Dividing both sides by π t (assuming t ≠0), we get B =3. Wait, but wait a second, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, let me write it again. The first term in x1(t) is cos(3πt). So Real(A e^{j π B t}) should equal cos(3πt). So the exponent's frequency is π B, and the cosine has 3π. So equate π B = 3 π, so B=3.

But wait, the second term is -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). Hmm. Let's see. The phase shift here complicates things. Because the cosine has a phase shift of -0.5π.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should express each term as a complex exponential and then take the real parts.

So let's think about each term:

Term 1: cos(3πt) = Real[e^{j 3πt} ]

Term 2: -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π) = -4 Real[ e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} ] 

Because e^{jθ} is cosθ + j sinθ, so Real part is the cosine.

Wait, but in the problem's expression, each Real part term is just A e^{j π B t} and D e^{j π E t}.

So for the first term, we have Real(A e^{j π B t}) = cos(3πt). So the exponent is j π B t, which should be j times the same argument as the cosine. So π B t must equal 3π t. Therefore, B=3.

Wait, but wait, that would mean the first term is Real(A e^{j3π t}) = A cos(3πt). Comparing to the given term, which is cos(3πt), so A must be 1.

Similarly, looking at the second term in x1(t), it's -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). So in the expression given, the second Real part is Real(D e^{j π E t} ). So we can write:

-4 cos(5πt - 0.5π) = Real(D e^{j π E t} )

Hmm, perhaps I can express this cosine with a phase shift as a complex exponential. Let's expand the cosine:

cos(5πt - 0.5π) = Real[ e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} ].

So,

-4 * Real[ e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} ] = Real( -4 e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} )

But the given expression is Real(D e^{j π E t} ), so the exponents must match.

So, the exponent in the second term is j (5π t - 0.5 π). Let me factor out π, so j π (5 t - 0.5). So the exponent becomes j π (5 t - 0.5) = j π (5 t) + j π (-0.5).

Wait, but the given form is D e^{j π E t}. So the exponent is j π E t. Comparing to j π (5 t - 0.5), we have:

j π E t = j π (5 t - 0.5 )

But wait, that's not matching exactly because of the minus 0.5. Unless E t equals 5 t - 0.5, which would require E t =5 t - 0.5, but that doesn't make sense because E is a constant and t is a variable. So that approach may not work. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can adjust for the phase shift by incorporating it into D. Because D is a complex constant, right? Because the problem says the Real part, so D can be a complex number. So let me think of D as having a magnitude and a phase.

Wait, let me write the second term as:

-4 cos(5πt - 0.5π) = Real( D e^{j π E t} )

I can express D as a complex number: D = M e^{j φ}.

So substituting in:

Real( M e^{j φ} e^{j π E t} ) = Real( M e^{j (π E t + φ)} ) = M cos(π E t + φ )

So, this should equal -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π).

So, equate:

M cos(π E t + φ ) = -4 cos(5π t - 0.5 π )

Comparing both sides, the cosine functions must match. So:

M = -4 (but wait, M is a magnitude, so it's positive. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.)

Wait, no, because D can be a complex number, but M is its magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps I shouldn't be getting M involved. Maybe I should think of D as absorbing the phase shift.

Wait, let me try another approach. The second term in x1(t) is -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). Let's write this as the real part of a complex exponential.

We can write:

-4 cos(5πt - 0.5π) = Real( -4 e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} )

But the problem's expression is Real( D e^{j π E t} ), so we can set D e^{j π E t} equal to -4 e^{j (5πt - 0.5π)}.

So:

D e^{j π E t} = -4 e^{j(5π t - 0.5 π)}

Let me write both sides with base e:

D = -4 e^{-j 0.5 π}  * e^{j 5π t} * e^{-j π E t} ?

Wait, maybe I should factor the exponents:

The right side is -4 e^{j 5π t} e^{-j 0.5 π}.

But the left side is D e^{j π E t}.

So,

D e^{j π E t} = -4 e^{-j 0.5 π} e^{j 5 π t}

Comparing exponents, the terms involving t must match, and the constants must match.

So for the exponents with t:

π E t must equal 5 π t → E =5.

And the constants:

D must equal (-4) e^{-j 0.5 π}.

But wait, D is just a complex constant, which is fine. So D = -4 e^{-j 0.5 π}.

So putting it all together, the second term is Real( D e^{j π E t} ) with E=5.

Wait, but the first term had B=3, and the second term E=5. So the values of B and E are 3 and 5, respectively.

Looking back at the options, let's see. The options are for B and E. So the first blank is B, the second E.

So in the options, the pair is [B, E]. So B=3, E=5.

Looking at the options:

A: [2,5] → B=2, E=5 → no, B is 3.

B: [5,3] → B=5, E=3 → No.

C: [7,4] → No.

D: [1,6] → Nope.

E: [5,2] → No.

F: [3,5] → Yes, B=3, E=5.

G: [2,4] → No.

H: [6,1] → No.

I: [3,7] → No.

J: [4,7] → No.

So the correct option is F: [3,5].

Wait, but I thought the second term gave E=5, right. Because comparing the exponents, π E t must equal 5 π t, so E=5. And for the first term, B=3.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be F.

The given signal is \( x_1(t) = \cos(3\pi t) - 4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \), and it is to be expressed as \( x_1(t) = \operatorname{Real}(A e^{j \pi B t}) + \operatorname{Real}(D e^{j \pi E t}) \). The goal is to determine the values of \( B \) and \( E \).

### Analysis of the First Term:
The first term in \( x_1(t) \) is \( \cos(3\pi t) \). Using Euler's formula, \( \cos(\theta) = \operatorname{Real}(e^{j\theta}) \), we can write:
\[
\cos(3\pi t) = \operatorname{Real}(e^{j 3\pi t}).
\]
Comparing this with \( \operatorname{Real}(A e^{j \pi B t}) \), we see that \( \pi B t = 3\pi t \), which implies \( B = 3 \).

### Analysis of the Second Term:
The second term in \( x_1(t) \) is \( -4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \). Using Euler's formula, we can write:
\[
\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) = \operatorname{Real}(e^{j(5\pi t - 0.5\pi)}).
\]
Thus:
\[
-4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) = \operatorname{Real}(-4 e^{j(5\pi t - 0.5\pi)}).
\]
Comparing this with \( \operatorname{Real}(D e^{j \pi E t}) \), we equate the exponents:
\[
\pi E t = 5\pi t,
\]
which gives \( E = 5 \).

### Final Answer:
From the analysis, \( B = 3 \) and \( E = 5 \). Among the given options, the correct choice is **F: [3, 5]**.
