Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about burglary, and I need to figure out which situation fits the definition. Hmm, let me think. I remember that burglary typically involves breaking into a structure with the intent to commit a felony, usually theft. The key elements are usually trespassory entry, intent to commit a crime inside, and it's typically a dwelling.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A person breaks into a house during a snowstorm, seeking shelter. The next morning, he takes a radio before leaving. Wait, so he entered without permission, but did he have the intent to commit a crime at the time of entry? If he was just seeking shelter, maybe the intent to steal came later. So maybe this isn't burglary because the intent wasn't there when he entered. That would make it theft, not burglary.

Option B: The defendant throws a brick through a window intending to kill. So he's using force, but did he enter the building? He threw a brick through the window, but if he didn't actually enter the house, some jurisdictions might not consider it a burglary. Plus, the intent was to kill, which is a felony, but again, if there's no entry, maybe it's not burglary. Or maybe some places consider the brick as a means to enter? I'm a bit confused here. I think burglary requires unlawful entry into the structure, not just causing damage. So if he didn't enter, perhaps it's assault or another crime, not burglary.

Option C: The defendant notices someone who owes him money at a hotel. He later breaks into the guest's room and threatens him. So here, entry into a hotel room (which is a dwelling) without permission, and with the intent to threaten or maybe extort money. Threatening someone could be considered intent to commit a felony, like assault or robbery. So the elements are there: unlawful entry into a dwelling with intent to commit a crime. That sounds like burglary.

Wait, let me double-check. Burglary requires the intent to commit a felony at the time of entry. In option C, when he broke in, he intended to threaten about the money, which is a criminal act. So yes, that fits. Option A's intent came after, so it's not burglary. Option B didn't enter the premises, so no burglary there. So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is:

C

In option C, the defendant unlawfully entered a hotel room (a dwelling) with the intent to threaten the occupant regarding money owed, fulfilling the elements of burglary: trespassory entry into a structure with intent to commit a felony.

Answer: C
