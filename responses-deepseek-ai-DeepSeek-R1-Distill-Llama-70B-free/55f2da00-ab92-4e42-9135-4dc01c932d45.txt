Question:

A man worked as a clerk in a gourmet coffee shop. His friend often stopped by the shop to chat with the man while the man was working. One afternoon, while the friend was visiting the shop, the man needed to use the bathroom. There were no customers in the shop at that moment, so the man asked the friend to watch the store for him while he went in the back to use the bathroom. The friend agreed to do so. While the man was in the bathroom, a customer came into the store. She wanted to purchase some freshly ground coffee. The shop had a grinding machine that customers could use. The customer selected a bag of coffee beans and then took it to the grinding machine. She was unsure how to start the machine, so she asked the friend for help. The friend tried to show the customer how to use the machine, but he was not familiar with how it worked, and he gave the customer erroneous instructions. The customer tried to follow the friend's instructions, but this led to her getting her finger pinched and cut by the machine. If the customer asserts a claim against the coffee shop company for her finger injury, the customer will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the company should have had a warning sign about the dangers of the machine.
B: not prevail, because the company is not liable for the friend's negligence.
C: prevail, because the company would be vicariously liable for the man's unauthorized actions.
D: not prevail, because the customer should have waited for an employee to operate the machine.
E: not prevail, because the friend was acting as a Good Samaritan.
F: not prevail, because the man acted outside the scope of employment by entrusting the supervision of the shop to his friend.
G: prevail, because the company failed to properly train the man on how to operate the machine.
H: not prevail, because the friend was not an employee of the coffee shop.
I: prevail, because the company failed to ensure that the man was never left alone in the shop.
J: prevail, because the friend's negligence would be imputed to the company.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically regarding vicarious liability and negligence. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is about a man who works as a clerk in a coffee shop. His friend comes by to chat while he's working. One afternoon, when there are no customers, the man needs to use the bathroom. He asks his friend to watch the store while he's gone. The friend agrees. 

While the man is in the bathroom, a customer comes in. She wants to buy freshly ground coffee. There's a grinding machine available for customers to use. She selects the beans and goes to the machine but doesn't know how to start it. She asks the friend for help. The friend tries to help but doesn't know how the machine works and gives her wrong instructions. As a result, her finger gets pinched and cut by the machine.

The question is whether the customer can successfully sue the coffee shop company for her injury. The options are A through J, with various reasons given.

First, I need to recall the legal principles involved. Vicarious liability is when an employer is held responsible for the actions of an employee performed within the scope of their employment. So if the friend were an employee, and acting within their job duties, the company might be liable. But in this case, the friend isn't an employee; he's just a friend helping out.

Wait, but the friend was asked by the clerk (an employee) to watch the store. Does that make the friend an agent of the company? Probably not. Agency requires some form of authority, and the friend here is just doing a favor, not acting in the capacity of an employee or agent. So the company wouldn't be vicariously liable for the friend's actions because the friend isn't their employee.

Another angle is negligence. The company has a duty to ensure that their premises are safe for customers. But in this case, the machine is provided for customer use. If the machine is dangerous and the company didn't provide proper warnings or instructions, maybe the company is negligent. But the question doesn't mention any lack of warnings or improper training of the machine to customers.

Wait, the customer was trying to use the machine herself, but she didn't know how. So she asked the friend, who gave wrong instructions. The friend's mistake caused her injury. But the friend isn't an employee, so the company isn't liable for his actions under vicarious liability.

Option B says the company isn't liable because they aren't responsible for the friend's negligence. That makes sense because the friend is not an employee. So the company can't be held vicariously liable.

Option H also says the company isn't liable because the friend wasn't an employee. So both B and H look similar. But wait, let me think: vicarious liability is about the employer's responsibility for the employee's actions. Since the friend isn't an employee, the company isn't liable for his negligence.

Looking at the options:

A: The company should have a warning sign. But the question doesn't say the machine was dangerous without a warning, just that the friend gave wrong instructions.

C: Company liable for man's unauthorized actions. The man didn't do anything wrong; he asked his friend to watch, which isn't a negligent act on his part.

D: Customer should have waited. But customers often use self-service machines, so it's not unreasonable that she tried to use it. Plus, the friend was there and offered help, which she relied on.

E: Friend as Good Samaritan. A Good Samaritan is someone who helps in an emergency without being obligated. Here, the friend agreed to watch the store, so maybe it's not exactly a Good Samaritan situation.

F: The man acted outside scope by leaving friend in charge. The man was using the bathroom, which is a necessary break. Entrusting a friend temporarily might not be outside the scope, but the issue is whether the friend's actions bind the company.

G: Failure to train the man about the machine. But the man wasn't the one operating it; he was in the bathroom. So the training issue isn't directly relevant here.

I: Company failed to ensure man wasn't left alone. But that's more about staffing; the man had to use the bathroom, so someone had to be there. The friend was just helping out, not an employee.

J: Friend's negligence imputed to company. But since the friend isn't an employee, his actions aren't imputed.

So the main issue is whether the company is liable for the friend's negligence. Since the friend isn't an employee, the company isn't vicariously liable. So the customer wouldn't prevail.

Looking back, option B says the company isn't liable because not responsible for friend's negligence. Option H says the company isn't liable because the friend wasn't an employee. Both seem correct, but the reasoning is slightly different.

Wait, the question is about whether the customer will prevail against the company. So if the company isn't liable because the friend's actions aren't their responsibility, that's the key point.

So the correct answer is B or H. Let me check the options again.

Option B: "not prevail, because the company is not liable for the friend's negligence."

Option H: "not prevail, because the friend was not an employee of the coffee shop."

Both are correct, but the reasoning in B is about the company not being liable for the friend's negligence, which is the precise issue. H is about the friend not being an employee, which is a fact leading to the same conclusion.

In tort law, if the friend isn't an employee, the company isn't vicariously liable. So the customer can't hold the company responsible for the friend's actions.

Therefore, the correct answer is B or H. Wait, but I think H is more specific. The reasoning is that the friend isn't an employee, so the company isn't liable. So perhaps H is the better answer.

Wait, but the question is about the company's liability. The friend's actions aren't within any scope of employment because he's not an employee. So the company isn't liable.

So the answer would be either B or H. Let me think again.

The options are:

B: Not prevail, because company not liable for friend's negligence.

H: Not prevail, because friend wasn't an employee.

Which one is the correct reason?

In this scenario, the friend is not an employee, so the company can't be held vicariously liable. Therefore, the reason is H. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but the friend was acting on behalf of the employee. But no, that doesn't make the friend an employee. So the company isn't liable.

So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but some might argue that the company could be directly negligent for leaving the friend in charge, but that's a different issue. The question is whether the customer would prevail against the company. If the company isn't liable for the friend's actions, then the customer can't recover from the company.

So the answer is H.

The question revolves around whether the coffee shop company can be held liable for the customer's injury caused by the friend's negligence. The key issue is the legal principle of vicarious liability, which holds employers responsible for the actions of their employees performed within the scope of employment. However, in this case, the friend is not an employee of the coffee shop; he is merely a friend helping out as a favor. Since the friend is not an employee, the company cannot be held vicariously liable for his actions.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Suggests the company should have had a warning sign. However, the injury was caused by the friend's erroneous instructions, not a lack of warnings about the machine.
- **Option B**: States the company is not liable for the friend's negligence. This is correct because the friend is not an employee, and the company cannot be held responsible for his actions.
- **Option C**: Claims the company is liable for the man's unauthorized actions. This is incorrect because the man did not act negligently by asking his friend to watch the store.
- **Option D**: Argues the customer should have waited for an employee. However, customers are allowed to use self-service machines, and the friend's presence and offer to help make this reasoning weak.
- **Option E**: Suggests the friend was acting as a Good Samaritan. This is not applicable because the friend agreed to watch the store, making it more than a spontaneous act of kindness.
- **Option F**: Claims the man acted outside the scope of employment. This is incorrect because using the bathroom is a necessary break, and asking a friend to watch the store temporarily does not constitute acting outside the scope of employment.
- **Option G**: Argues the company failed to train the man. This is irrelevant because the man was not operating the machine, and the issue lies with the friend's actions.
- **Option H**: States the company is not liable because the friend was not an employee. This is correct and more specific than Option B, as it directly addresses the lack of an employer-employee relationship.
- **Option I**: Suggests the company failed to ensure the man was never left alone. This is incorrect because the man was not acting negligently by using the bathroom and asking a friend to help.
- **Option J**: Claims the friend's negligence is imputed to the company. This is incorrect because the friend is not an employee, so his actions cannot be imputed to the company.

The most accurate answer is **Option H**, as it directly addresses the fact that the friend was not an employee, and therefore, the company cannot be held liable for his negligence.

Answer: H
