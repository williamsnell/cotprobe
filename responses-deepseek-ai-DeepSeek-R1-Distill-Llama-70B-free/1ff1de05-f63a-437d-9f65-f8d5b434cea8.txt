Okay, so I've got this finance problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but let me try to work through it. The question is about calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for an e-commerce company. Hmm, I've heard WACC is important for evaluating investment decisions, like whether a company should buy another company or project.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The company has total capital assets of $100,000, which is split into $60,000 equity and $40,000 debt. So total capital is 60k +40k =100k, right? The cost of equity is 10%, and the cost of debt is 5%. The corporate tax rate is 21%. I remember that taxes affect the cost of debt because interest is tax-deductible, but equity isn't. So I need to account for that.

Wait, so WACC is calculated by taking the proportion of each component (equity and debt) in the total capital, multiplying each by their respective cost, and then adding them up. But wait, for debt, the cost is after tax, right? Because interest payments reduce taxable income, so the effective cost is lower.

Let me write down the formula. The WACC formula is:

WACC = (E/V)*Re + (D/V)*Rd*(1 - Tc)

Where:
- E is the market value of equity,
- D is the market value of debt,
- V is E + D,
- Re is cost of equity,
- Rd is cost of debt,
- Tc is corporate tax rate.

Wait, so in this case, E is 60,000, D is 40,000. So V=100,000.

So plugging the numbers in:

E/V = 60,000 / 100,000 = 0.6
D/V = 40,000 / 100,000 = 0.4

Re is 10% or 0.10, Rd is 5% or 0.05. Tc is 21% or 0.21.

So WACC = (0.6 * 0.10) + (0.4 * 0.05 * (1 - 0.21))

Let me compute each part step by step.

First part: 0.6 * 0.10 = 0.06.

Second part: 0.4 * 0.05 = 0.02. Then multiply by (1 - 0.21) which is 0.79.

So 0.02 * 0.79 = 0.0158.

Now add both parts: 0.06 + 0.0158 = 0.0758.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait! The formula for the cost of debt is Rd*(1 - Tc), right. So yes, that's correct.

So the WACC is 0.0758, which is 7.58%. Looking at the options, option E is 0.0758. So the answer should be E?

Wait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly. Let me redo them.

E/V is 0.6, Re is 0.10: 0.6 * 0.10 = 0.06.

D/V is 0.4, Rd is 0.05, tax rate 0.21: so 0.4 * 0.05 = 0.02. Then multiply by (1-0.21)=0.79: 0.02 * 0.79 = 0.0158.

Adding 0.06 and 0.0158 gives 0.0758, which is 7.58%. So the correct WACC is 7.58%, which is option E.

I don't think I missed anything here. Yeah, I think E is the right answer.

To calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for the e-commerce company, we use the formula:

\[
\text{WACC} = \left(\frac{E}{V}\right)R_e + \left(\frac{D}{V}\right)R_d(1 - T_c)
\]

Where:
- \( E = \$60,000 \) (equity),
- \( D = \$40,000 \) (debt),
- \( V = E + D = \$100,000 \) (total capital),
- \( R_e = 10\% = 0.10 \) (cost of equity),
- \( R_d = 5\% = 0.05 \) (cost of debt),
- \( T_c = 21\% = 0.21 \) (corporate tax rate).

### Step 1: Calculate the weights
\[
\frac{E}{V} = \frac{60,000}{100,000} = 0.6, \quad \frac{D}{V} = \frac{40,000}{100,000} = 0.4
\]

### Step 2: Compute the weighted costs
\[
\text{Weighted cost of equity} = 0.6 \times 0.10 = 0.06
\]
\[
\text{Weighted cost of debt (after tax)} = 0.4 \times 0.05 \times (1 - 0.21) = 0.4 \times 0.05 \times 0.79 = 0.0158
\]

### Step 3: Add the weighted costs
\[
\text{WACC} = 0.06 + 0.0158 = 0.0758
\]

Thus, the WACC is 7.58%, which corresponds to option **E**.
