Okay, so I have this problem about water evaporation from a surface. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question gives me some parameters: relative humidity, air temperature, water temperature, and the length of the water surface in the direction of air flow. I need to find the quantity of water evaporated per hour per square foot.

Wait, I remember that evaporation from a water surface can be calculated using some formula, probably involving the mass transfer coefficient. Oh right, the formula is something like the mass transfer rate m_dot equals the mass transfer coefficient (k) multiplied by the area (A) and the difference in concentration (C). But wait, concentration here would be the humidity by volume or something else?

Alternatively, I think there's a formula involving the latent heat of vaporization and the heat transfer rate. Oh wait, maybe I should be using the Lewis equation or something related to the psychrometric chart. Or perhaps it's about the evaporation using the mass transfer equation where the rate is based on the vapor pressure difference.

Let me think. The basic mass transfer equation for evaporation is often given by m_dot = (k * A * (ρ_water - ρ_air)) / MW_water, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's using the enthalpy method, but that might be more for cooling towers.

Wait, I think the formula for evaporation rate from a water surface is given by:

m = (k * (P_s - P_a)) * A / (R * T)

Where:
- m is the mass transfer rate,
- k is the mass transfer coefficient,
- P_s is the saturation vapor pressure at the water temperature,
- P_a is the partial pressure of vapor in the air,
- A is the area,
- R is the gas constant for water vapor,
- T is the absolute temperature.

But wait, I might be mixing up some variables here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is m = (k * (ρ_s - ρ_a)) * A, where ρ is the density or concentration.

Hmm, but how do I find the mass transfer coefficient k? I think it depends on the velocity of the air and the length of the surface, which is given here as 7 inches. Oh wait, the formula for the mass transfer coefficient in laminar flow over a flat plate is given by the Sherwood number correlation. The Sherwood number Sh is equal to (0.332) * Re^(1/2) * Sc^(1/3), where Re is the Reynolds number and Sc is the Schmidt number.

But wait, the units here are in feet and inches, so I'll have to make sure to convert them to a consistent unit system, probably to SI units or English units. Let's see, the air velocity is 5 ft/s, the length is 7 inches, which is 0.5833 feet.

Wait, so first, I need to calculate the Reynolds number. Re is (velocity * length) / kinematic viscosity. What's the kinematic viscosity of air at the given temperature?

The air temperature is 75°F, which is about 23.89°C. The kinematic viscosity of air at 25°C is approximately 0.000016 ft²/s, but maybe I should look it up more accurately. Wait, 75°F is 24°C, so the kinematic viscosity ν is about 1.62e-5 ft²/s. Wait, no, let me double-check. Wait, in metric units, it's around 1.6e-5 m²/s at 20°C, which is 0.00016 m²/s. To convert to ft²/s, since 1 m² is about 10.764 ft², so 0.00016 m²/s is 0.00016 * 10.764 ft²/s, which is approximately 0.000001722 ft²/s. Wait, that can't be right because I might have messed up the conversion. Alternatively, I remember that the kinematic viscosity of air at 70°F (around 21°C) is about 0.0000167 ft²/s. Hmm, maybe I should use ν = 0.000017 ft²/s for simplicity.

So Re = (v * L) / ν. Let's plug in the numbers: v is 5 ft/s, L is 0.5833 ft, and ν is 0.000017 ft²/s. So Re = (5 * 0.5833) / 0.000017 = (2.9165) / 0.000017 ≈ 171,000. Wait, that's a pretty high Reynolds number, which suggests turbulent flow. But wait, the critical Re for a flat plate is around 500,000, so maybe this is still laminar. Or maybe in the transition region. Hmm, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we'll proceed with the laminar flow correlation, Sh = 0.332 Re^(1/2) Sc^(1/3).

Wait, but the problem is in English units, and the correlation is applicable as long as the units are consistent. Now, the Schmidt number Sc for air-water vapor is about 0.63. I remember that Sc for water vapor in air is approximately 0.6 to 0.7, depending on temperature. Let's take Sc = 0.63.

So, Sh = 0.332 * (Re)^(1/2) * (Sc)^(1/3). Let's compute Re first. Re = (5 ft/s * 0.5833 ft) / 0.000017 ft²/s. Let me compute that: 5 * 0.5833 is 2.9165. Divide by 0.000017 gives 2.9165 / 0.000017 = 171,500 approximately. So Re ≈ 1.715e5.

Sh = 0.332 * (1.715e5)^(0.5) * (0.63)^(1/3). Let's compute each part:

The square root of 1.715e5 is sqrt(171500) ≈ 414.28.

The cube root of 0.63 is approximately 0.86.

So Sh ≈ 0.332 * 414.28 * 0.86. Let's compute 0.332 * 414.28 first: 0.332 * 400 = 132.8, 0.332 * 14.28 ≈ 4.74. So total ≈ 137.54. Then multiply by 0.86: 137.54 * 0.86 ≈ 118.2.

Wait, but the Sherwood number Sh is defined as (k * L) / D, where D is the diffusion coefficient. So, k = (Sh * D) / L.

Wait, I need the diffusion coefficient D for water vapor in air. At 75°F, which is about 24°C, D for water vapor is approximately 0.000258 ft²/s. I think that's correct because at 20°C, D is about 0.00025 ft²/s, so 24°C would be a bit higher, maybe 0.000258.

So k = Sh * D / L. Let's plug in the numbers: Sh is 118.2, D is 0.000258 ft²/s, L is 0.5833 ft.

So k = (118.2 * 0.000258) / 0.5833.

Compute numerator: 118.2 * 0.000258 ≈ 0.0305. Then divide by 0.5833: 0.0305 / 0.5833 ≈ 0.0523 ft/s.

Wait, no, because D is in ft²/s, Sh is dimensionless, L is in ft. So k will have units of ft/s, since (ft²/s * dimensionless) / ft = ft/s. That makes sense because mass transfer coefficient has units of length/time.

Now, the mass transfer rate equation is m = k * A * (ρ_s - ρ_a). Where ρ_s is the density of water vapor at the water surface, and ρ_a is the density of water vapor in the air.

Wait, but maybe it's better to use the equation in terms of partial pressures or humidity ratios. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula m = (k * (P_s - P_a)) * A / (R * T), where R is the specific gas constant for water vapor.

Wait, the specific gas constant R for water vapor is 1106 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R), but wait, maybe I should convert units properly. Alternatively, in SI units, R is 461.5 J/kg·K, but let's work in English units.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula m = (k * (ω_s - ω_a)) * A, where ω is the humidity ratio (lb water/lb dry air). But to find ω, I need to calculate the humidity ratio at the water surface and in the air.

Wait, let me think. The relative humidity is 42%, air temp is 75°F, and water temp is 65°F. Since the air is moving over the water, the vapor pressure at the water surface is higher than that in the air.

So first, let's find the saturation vapor pressure at the water temperature, which is 65°F. Let me convert that to Rankine for calculation purposes. 65°F is (65 + 459.67) = 524.67 °R.

The saturation pressure P_s can be found using the psychrometric chart or the Antoine equation. Alternatively, I can look up the vapor pressure of water at 65°F.

Looking it up, at 65°F, the saturation vapor pressure is approximately 1.703 psia. Wait, let me confirm. Actually, at 60°F, it's about 0.519 psia, and at 70°F, it's about 2.68 psia. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, 65°F would be around 2.1 psia? Hmm, maybe it's better to use exact values. Alternatively, perhaps using P_s = 0.1 * exp(72.2 - (4000)/(T + 38)), where T is in °F. Let me compute that.

Wait, another approach: using the Antoine equation. The Antoine equation is log10(P) = A - B/(T + C), where T is in °C. So for water, A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485. So first, convert 65°F to °C: (65 - 32) * 5/9 ≈ 18.333°C.

So log10(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(18.333 + 244.485) = 8.14019 - 1810.94 / 262.818 ≈ 8.14019 - 6.894 ≈ 1.2462. So P = 10^1.2462 ≈ 17.6 mmHg. Wait, that's in mmHg, convert to psia: 1 psia = 2.036 mmHg, so 17.6 / 2.036 ≈ 8.65 psia? No, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no, 1 atm is 14.7 psia and 760 mmHg. So 17.6 mmHg is 17.6 / 760 atm, which is about 0.02315 atm. Convert to psia: 0.02315 * 14.7 ≈ 0.340 psia. Hmm, that seems low. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine equation.

Wait, perhaps the Antoine constants are different. Let me check: Antoine constants for water (IAPWS) in the range 1 to 100°C are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485, and T is in °C. So at 18.333°C, log10(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(18.333 + 244.485) ≈ 8.14019 - (1810.94/262.818) ≈ 8.14019 - 6.894 ≈ 1.246. So P = 10^1.246 ≈ 17.6 mmHg, which is about 0.023 atm or 0.34 psia. That seems more reasonable.

Wait, but when I look at a psychrometric chart, at 65°F, the saturation pressure is about 1.703 psia. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe I'm using the wrong Antoine constants. Alternatively, perhaps using a different form of Antoine equation. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the vapor pressure at 65°F. Let me think, from standard tables, the vapor pressure of water at 65°F is approximately 1.703 psia. So perhaps I should use that value. Similarly, the air is at 75°F and 42% relative humidity, so its vapor pressure P_a is 0.42 times the saturation pressure at 75°F.

So, let's find P_a. The saturation pressure at 75°F: again, using Antoine equation.

Convert 75°F to °C: (75-32)*5/9 = 23.89°C.

log10(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(23.89 + 244.485) = 8.14019 - 1810.94 / 268.375 ≈ 8.14019 - 6.751 ≈ 1.389. So P = 10^1.389 ≈ 24.5 mmHg. Convert to psia: 24.5 / 2.036 ≈ 12.04 psia? Wait, that can't be right because 1 atm is 14.7 psia, so 24.5 mmHg is 24.5/760 atm = 0.03224 atm * 14.7 psia/atm ≈ 0.474 psia.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because at 75°F, the saturation pressure is about 0.474 psia, so P_a = 0.42 * 0.474 ≈ 0.199 psia.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me check from a psychrometric chart. For example, at 75°F, the saturation vapor pressure is about 0.43 psia. Wait, maybe that's more accurate. So P_s_air = 0.43 psia. Then P_a = 0.42 * 0.43 = 0.1806 psia.

Wait, but earlier I thought the saturation pressure at 65°F is 1.703 psia, which I think is correct. So P_s_water = 1.703 psia, and P_a = 0.42 * P_s_air, where P_s_air is the saturation pressure at air temperature, which is P_s_air = 0.43 psia at 75°F. So P_a = 0.42 * 0.43 = 0.1806 psia.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting numbers. Let me try to find correct saturation pressures.

Looking up a psychrometric chart, at 75°F, the saturation vapor pressure is approximately 0.43 psia. At 65°F, it's about 1.703 psia? No, that can't be right because higher temperatures have higher vapor pressures. Wait, no, no, 65°F is lower than 75°F, so its saturation vapor pressure should be lower. Wait, that's the confusion. Wait no, 65°F is lower than 75°F, so its saturation vapor pressure is lower. So P_s_water would be lower than P_s_air. Wait, no, wait: the water surface is at 65°F, so its saturation vapor pressure is lower than that of the air at 75°F. So if the air is at 75°F and 42% RH, its vapor pressure is 0.42 times the saturation pressure at 75°F.

Wait, let me correct this. The water is at 65°F, so its saturation vapor pressure P_s_water is lower than the air's saturation at 75°F. So P_s_water is, for example, at 65°F, the saturation vapor pressure is about 0.407 psia. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me check:

Wait, using the Antoine equation again, more accurately. Let me compute P_sat at 65°F and 75°F.

At 65°F = 18.333°C:
log10(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(18.333 + 244.485) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/262.818 ≈ 8.14019 - 6.894 ≈ 1.246 → P ≈ 17.6 mmHg = 0.023 atm → 0.023 * 14.7 ≈ 0.338 psia.

At 75°F = 23.89°C:
log10(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(23.89 + 244.485) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/268.375 ≈ 8.14019 - 6.751 ≈ 1.389 → P ≈ 24.5 mmHg = 0.03224 atm → 0.03224 * 14.7 ≈ 0.474 psia.

So, P_s_water = 0.338 psia, and P_s_air = 0.474 psia. Then, the air has RH = 42%, so P_a = 0.42 * 0.474 = 0.199 psia.

Wait, this makes sense because the water is at a lower temperature, so its vapor pressure is lower than the air's. So the vapor will condense? No, wait, no, evaporation occurs when the air has lower vapor pressure than the surface. Wait, no, wait, no: the air's vapor pressure is 0.199 psia, and the surface's is 0.338 psia. So the surface vapor pressure is higher than the air's, so evaporation will occur.

Wait, no, that's correct because the surface is at a lower temperature but higher vapor pressure? Wait, no, no: the surface is at 65°F, lower than the air's 75°F, but the air is not saturated. So, the surface's vapor pressure is higher than the air's, so water will evaporate from the surface.

So, the driving force for evaporation is (P_s_water - P_a) = 0.338 - 0.199 = 0.139 psia.

Now, the mass transfer rate can be calculated using m = (k * (P_s - P_a)) * A / (R * T). But wait, I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the equation m = (k * (ρ_s - ρ_a)) * A, where �
