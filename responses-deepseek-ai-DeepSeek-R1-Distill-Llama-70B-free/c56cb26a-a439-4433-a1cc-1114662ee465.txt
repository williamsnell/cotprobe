Question:

During 1979, Mr. Anderson expected to earn $20,000. From thisincome he had planned to save $2,000. However, during 1979, Mr. Anderson got a raise which boosted his income to $23,000.If Mr. Anderson ended up saving a total of $3,000 outof his $23,000 income, what was his marginal propensity toconsume (MPC) ? (It may be assumed that if he had not receivedhis raise, Mr. Anderson would have actually saved the$2,000 that he had planned to save.)

Options:

A: 3/5
B: 2/3
C: 3/4
D: 4/5
E: 1/4
F: 7/8
G: 1/2
H: 2/5
I: 1/3
J: 5/6

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about Mr. Anderson and his savings. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). I remember MPC is the fraction of additional income that a household consumes rather than saves. So, it's like when you get more money, how much of that extra do you spend.

Let me read the problem again. So, Mr. Anderson expected to earn $20,000 in 1979 and planned to save $2,000. That means his planned consumption was $18,000 because 20k minus 2k savings is 18k. But then he got a raise, making his actual income $23,000. And with that, he ended up saving $3,000. So his actual consumption must have been 23k minus 3k, which is 20k.

Wait, so without the raise, he was going to save 2k out of 20k. But with the raise, he saved 3k out of 23k. The difference in income is 23k minus 20k, which is 3k. And the difference in savings is 3k minus 2k, which is 1k. So the extra income was 3k, and he saved 1k of that. That means he spent 2k of the extra 3k.

MPC is the amount he consumed from the additional income. So he consumed 2k out of 3k. So the MPC is 2/3. Wait, but let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, wait. Because I think I might have mixed up something.

Wait, when he got the raise, his income increased by 3k (from 20k to 23k). His savings went up by 1k (from 2k to 3k). So the change in savings is plus 1k, which would mean that the change in consumption is the remaining part. Because the additional 3k, he saved 1k, so he must have spent 2k. So the MPC is the change in consumption over change in income, which is 2k/3k = 2/3. So the MPC should be 2/3.

Looking at the options, option B is 2/3. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me think again. Another way to approach this is to calculate his consumption in both scenarios. Originally, income was 20k, savings 2k, so consumption was 18k. After the raise, income 23k, savings 3k, so consumption is 20k. The change in income is 3k (from 20k to 23k) and change in consumption is 2k (18k to 20k). So MPC is 2k/3k = 2/3. Yeah, that confirms it.

I think I've got it right. So the answer is B.

To determine Mr. Anderson's marginal propensity to consume (MPC), we analyze how much of his additional income was spent on consumption. 

1. **Initial Scenario**:  
   - Expected income: $20,000  
   - Planned savings: $2,000  
   - Therefore, planned consumption: $20,000 - $2,000 = $18,000  

2. **After the Raise**:  
   - Actual income: $23,000  
   - Actual savings: $3,000  
   - Therefore, actual consumption: $23,000 - $3,000 = $20,000  

3. **Changes**:  
   - Change in income: $23,000 - $20,000 = $3,000  
   - Change in consumption: $20,000 - $18,000 = $2,000  

4. **MPC Calculation**:  
   MPC is the fraction of the additional income that is consumed.  
   \[
   \text{MPC} = \frac{\text{Change in Consumption}}{\text{Change in Income}} = \frac{2,000}{3,000} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

Thus, Mr. Anderson's marginal propensity to consume is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The correct answer is **B**.
