Okay, so I have this problem about an American perpetual option in the Black-Scholes framework. Hmm, I remember that perpetual options have no expiration, so the formulas are a bit different from the regular Black-Scholes. Let me try to think this through.

The question gives me three things: first, h₁ + h₂ equals 7/9. Second, the risk-free rate is 5%, which is 0.05. Third, the volatility σ is 0.30. I need to find h₁.

Wait, I recall that in the case of a perpetual American option, there's a specific formula for the critical stock prices h₁ and h₂. I think they satisfy certain equations based on the risk-free rate and volatility.

Let me try to remember the formulas. Oh right, for an American perpetual call option, the critical stock price h₂ is the lower of the two boundaries where the option is exercised. And h₁ is the upper boundary, I think. Or maybe I have that backwards. Wait, no, h₂ is the lower boundary, and h₁ is the higher one. Because when the stock price reaches h₁, the option holder will exercise the call. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. For a put option, when the stock price falls to a certain level, you exercise the put. But here, the question is about a call option, I think, because h1 and h2 are part of the standard perpetual option model.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's a call or a put. Oh, wait, the question is about an American perpetual option. Oh, perhaps the same formulas apply regardless, but I might need to think about the context.

Wait, in the Black-Scholes model for perpetual options, the critical stock prices for a call option are determined by h1 and h2, where h1 is higher than h2. The call is exercised when the stock price reaches h1, and the put is exercised at h2. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe h1 and h2 are the solutions to a quadratic equation.

Wait, I think there's a quadratic equation that h1 and h2 satisfy. Let me recall. Oh yes, the equation is:

(r - σ²/2) * h + (σ²/2) * h² = 0

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like the sum and product of the roots. Because for a quadratic equation of the form a h² + b h + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product is c/a.

Wait, let me think again. The Black-Scholes formula for perpetual options leads to two critical stock prices, h1 and h2, which are the boundaries for exercising the option. These satisfy certain conditions.

I remember that the sum of h1 and h2 is (2*(r))/(σ²). Or wait, maybe it's (2*(r - dividend yield))/(σ²), but in this problem, there's no mention of dividends, so I can assume it's zero. So sum is (2*r)/(σ²). Wait, but the question says h1 + h2 = 7/9. Let me check that.

So, given the formula for sum of roots: h1 + h2 = (2r)/(σ²). Wait, let me make sure. I think I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's (2*(r + σ²/2)) / σ²? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, let me get back. The equation for the critical stock prices h1 and h2 in the perpetual American option model comes from setting the value function and its derivative to zero at those points. For a call option, the critical price h is found by solving (r h K)/(σ² (h - K)) ) = 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the equation is ( (r) / (σ²) ) h + ... maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the standard formula. For a perpetual American call option, the critical stock price h is given by:

h = ( (r) / (σ²) ) * ( (1 + sqrt(1 + (σ²/r)^2 )) ) * K

Wait, no, I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the sum of h1 and h2 comes from a quadratic equation where the sum is (2r)/(σ²). Let me test that.

Given that h1 + h2 = 7/9. So 7/9 equals 2r/(σ²). Let me compute 2r/(σ squared). r is 0.05, so 2*0.05 = 0.10. σ is 0.30, so σ² is 0.09. So 0.10 / 0.09 is 10/9 ≈ 1.111. But the given sum is 7/9 ≈ 0.777. That's not matching. So maybe I'm wrong about the formula.

Hmm, so perhaps the sum is something else. Wait, maybe the product of h1 and h2 is (K^2), where K is the strike price, but I don't have K here. Or perhaps the product is related to other terms.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is that h1 and h2 are the roots of the equation (σ²/2) h² - (r - σ²/2) h = 0. Let me see. That would factor as h ( (σ²/2) h - (r - σ²/2) ) = 0. So the roots are h=0 and h=( (r - σ²/2) )/(σ²/2) ). Wait, but this doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is (σ²/2) h² - (r) h = 0. Then the roots would be h=0 and h= 2r/(σ²). So the sum would be 2r/(σ²), which as before, is 2*0.05 /0.09 = 0.10/0.09=1.111..., which doesn't match 7/9 (~0.777). So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the quadratic equation is different. Let me think. The value of a perpetual American call option is given by (S * C - K) * something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the critical stock prices h1 and h2 are the solutions to the equation (S/(h2)) )^( (r + σ²/2)/σ² ) ) = (h1/h2), but I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the parameters. Another approach: in the perpetual option model, the critical prices h1 and h2 satisfy the equation h1 + h2 = (2r)/(σ²). Wait, but earlier that gave me a sum of 10/9, but the given sum is 7/9. So perhaps that's not the correct formula.

Alternatively, maybe the sum is (2(r - σ²/2))/(σ²). Let's compute that. r is 0.05, σ² is 0.09. So r - σ²/2 = 0.05 - 0.09/2 = 0.05 - 0.045 = 0.005. Then 2*0.005 = 0.01. Divided by 0.09 is 0.01/0.09 ≈ 0.111. That's much smaller than 7/9. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's think about the formula for the value of a perpetual American call option. The formula is:

C = (S (h2)^{-a} - K (h1)^{-a}) / (h1^{-a} - h2^{-a})

where a = (r)/(σ²) + 0.5.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the critical stock price h for the perpetual American call is h = K * [ (r + σ²/2)/(r) ) ]^{ 2 r / σ² }.

Wait, perhaps that's better. Let me think. Alternatively, the formula for h1 and h2 comes from solving the equation where the option value and its delta are zero. But perhaps I should just look up the standard equations for h1 and h2.

Wait, perhaps for a perpetual American call option, the critical stock price h is given by:

h = K * ( (r + σ²/2) / r )^{ 2 r / σ² }

Wait, even better, perhaps the critical stock price h is given by:

h = K * ( (r) / (σ²/2) )^{ (σ²/2) / r }

Wait, no, perhaps that's the formula for a different model. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think I remember that for a perpetual American option, the critical prices h1 and h2 are the roots of the equation:

(σ²/2) h² - r h = 0.

Wait, that equation would have roots at h=0 and h= 2r/(σ²). Then the sum would be 2r/(σ²) = 0.10/0.09 ≈1.111, which again doesn't match the given sum of 7/9.

Wait, maybe the equation is (σ²/2) h^2 + (r) h = 0. Then roots are h=0 and h= -2r/(σ²). But that gives negative h, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me think again. The value of a perpetual American option must satisfy the differential equation:

(σ² S² / 2) * d²V/dS² + r S * dV/dS - r V = 0.

But I'm looking for the critical stock prices where the option is exercised, so perhaps I should look for where the option value equals its payoff. For a call option, V = max(S - K, 0), but since it's perpetual, perhaps the value is S - K when S >= h, and some function otherwise.

Alternatively, the critical stock prices h1 and h2 are the solutions to the equation where the option's value and its derivative match the payoff. For a call, at h, V = h - K, and dV/dS = 1.

Wait, I think I'm getting too deep into the derivation. Let me try to think of another approach. The sum h1 + h2 is given as 7/9. I need to find h1, given that r=5% and σ=30%.

Wait, perhaps the sum h1 + h2 = 2r/(σ²). Let me compute that again. r=0.05, σ²=0.09. 2r=0.10. 0.10/0.09≈1.111. But the given sum is 7/9≈0.777, which is less than 1. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the formula is h1 + h2 = 2(r)/(σ²). Hmm, same as before. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the sum is (2(r + σ²/2))/(σ²). Let me compute that: r + σ²/2 = 0.05 + 0.045=0.095. Multiply by 2: 0.19. Divide by 0.09: ≈2.111. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is h1 * h2 = (K^2). But without knowing K, I can't use that.

Wait, maybe the product of h1 and h2 is (something else). Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the sum and product.

Wait, let me think again. If I have a quadratic equation a h² + b h + c =0, then sum of roots is -b/a, product is c/a.

Suppose that h1 and h2 are roots of the equation:

(σ²/2) h² - (r - σ²/2) h =0.

Then a=σ²/2, b= -(r - σ²/2), c=0.

Sum of roots is (-b)/a = (r - σ²/2)/(σ²/2).

Which is (r/(σ²/2) -1) = (2 r / σ²) -1.

Hmm, let's compute that.

2r/σ² = 2*0.05 / 0.09 = 0.10/0.09 ≈1.111. So sum would be 1.111 -1 = 0.111. That's not matching 7/9.

So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the correct quadratic equation for h is:

(σ²/2) h^2 + (r) h - K = 0.

Wait, but then the sum would be -r/(σ²/2) = -2r/(σ²). Which is negative, so that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think about the possible answers and see if any of them fit.

The options are A: 0.50, B: 2.00, C:1.75, D:1.40, E:0.75, F:1.10, G:1.51, H:1.25, I:2.50, J:1.00.

Wait, the sum is 7/9 ≈0.777. So h1 + h2 = 0.777.

Looking for two numbers among the options that sum to 0.777. Let's see:

Option J is 1.00. Then h2 would be 0.777 -1.00≈-0.223, which is negative. Doesn't make sense.

Option E is 0.75. Then h2= 0.777-0.75=0.027. That's possible.

But let's check if E (0.75) is a possible answer. Let me think, if h1 is 0.75, then h2 is 0.027.

Wait, but I think h1 is the higher boundary, so h2 would be lower. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, let's think about another approach. I remember that for a perpetual American call option, the critical stock price h is given by:

h = K * ( (r + σ²/2) / r )^{ (2 r)/(σ²) }

Wait, let me compute that. Let me compute the exponent first: 2r/σ² = 2*0.05/0.09 ≈ 0.1111.

Then, (r + σ²/2)/r = (0.05 + 0.045)/0.05 = 0.095/0.05 = 1.9.

So h = K * (1.9)^{0.1111}.

But I don't know K, so this doesn't directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for h1 is h1 = ( (r) / (σ²) ) * ( (1 + sqrt(1 + (σ²/r)^2 )) ) * K.

Wait, let me compute (σ²/r)^2. σ² is 0.09, r is 0.05. So 0.09/0.05=1.8. Square of that is 3.24. So sqrt(1 +3.24)=sqrt(4.24)=≈2.06.

So (1 + 2.06)=3.06. Multiply by (r/σ²)=0.05/0.09≈0.5556.

So 0.5556 *3.06≈1.70.

So h1≈1.70 * K.

But without knowing K, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the call and put options. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for h₁ is:

h₁ = ( (r) / (σ²) ) * ( 1 + sqrt(1 + (σ²/r)^2) ) * K.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should think about the sum of h1 and h2 being 7/9.

If h1 + h2 =7/9, and I need to find h1, perhaps I can find another equation involving h1 and h2.

Wait, perhaps the product of h1 and h2 is known. Let me think about that.

In the Black-Scholes model for perpetual options, the product h1 * h2 is equal to (K^2) times some factor. But without knowing K, I can't use that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find h1 using the quadratic equation. Let me assume that the quadratic equation for h is:

(σ²/2) h² - (r) h + C =0.

Wait, but I don't know C. Alternatively, maybe the equation is:

(σ²/2) h² - (r - σ²/2) h =0.

Wait, this equation has roots h=0 and h= [ (r - σ²/2) ] / (σ²/2) ) = [ (0.05 - 0.045) ] / 0.045 = 0.005 /0.045 ≈0.1111.

So sum is 0 + 0.1111≈0.1111. But the given sum is 0.777, so that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think about the value of the option. For a perpetual call, the option value is (S - h) when S >=h, and some function otherwise. So perhaps the critical h satisfies (S/(h))^( (r - σ²/2)/σ² ) ) = 1 + (h)/(S).

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when S reaches h, the option is exercised. So maybe the value function at h is S - K, and the derivative is 1.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to set up the differential equation and find h1.

The differential equation for a perpetual American call is:

(σ² S² / 2) V''(S) + r S V'(S) - r V(S) = 0.

At S = h, V = S - K, and V' = 1.

We can solve this ODE. The general solution is V(S) = A S^a + B S^b, where a and b are roots of the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is (σ²/2) a(a-1) + r a - r =0.

Which simplifies to (σ²/2) a² + (r - σ²/2) a - r
