Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about describing a work group where the workers have demarcated tasks and distant line managers. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let's break this down. The work group has workers with demarcated tasks. "Demarcated" means clearly defined and separated. So each worker has specific tasks they're responsible for, and there's a clear division of labor. 

Then, the line managers are distant. Line managers are typically involved in the day-to-day operations and directly supervise the workers. If they're distant, it might mean they're not as involved in the workers' tasks or that the management style is more hands-off. 

So, what kind of work group structure does this describe? Since the tasks are clearly defined and separated, each worker might be working more independently on their part. If the managers aren't closely involved, the workers might not be relying on each other as much either. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: Interdependent. That would mean the workers rely on each other a lot. But if tasks are demarcated and managers are distant, maybe they don't need to depend much on each other. So probably not A.

Option B: Co-dependent. I'm not sure if this is a common term in this context. It might refer to mutual dependence, but again, if tasks are separate, maybe not.

Option C: Cohesive. That refers to a group where members work well together and have strong bonds. But with distant managers and separate tasks, maybe the group isn't necessarily cohesive.

Option D: Integrated. Integration implies that different parts work together as a whole. If tasks are separate and managers are distant, integration might not be high.

Option E: Synergistic. This means the group's efforts create a combined effect greater than individual efforts. If they're working separately, maybe synergy isn't the focus here.

Option F: Independent. This makes sense. If each worker has their own tasks and managers are distant, the group might operate more independently, with each member handling their part without much collaboration.

Option G: Collaborative. Collaboration implies working together. But with demarcated tasks, they might not be collaborating much.

Option H: Hierarchical. A hierarchical structure has a clear chain of command. But the question says managers are distant, which might imply a less hierarchical structure, or at least not a traditional one.

Option I: Dependent. This would mean the group relies on others, but if tasks are separate and managers are distant, maybe they're not dependent on each other.

So, putting it all together, the work group with demarcated tasks and distant line managers sounds like each worker is handling their own part independently. So the correct term would be "Independent," which is option F.
</think>

The work group described has clearly defined, separate tasks for each worker and distant line managers, indicating a hands-off management style. This setup suggests that each worker operates independently with minimal collaboration or reliance on others. Among the options, "Independent" best captures this structure where individuals focus on their specific responsibilities without close managerial oversight or strong interdependence.

Answer: F
