Question:

What are the general contentions as to whether or not aggressiveness is instinctual?

Options:

A: Aggressiveness is determined by genetic inheritance alone
B: Aggressiveness has no instinctual basis in man
C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual
D: Aggressiveness is a response only to immediate environmental stimuli
E: Aggressiveness is an exclusively human trait not found in other animals
F: Aggressiveness is a trait that can be completely eradicated through education

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about whether aggressiveness is instinctual. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the general contentions, meaning the main arguments for or against the idea that aggressiveness is an instinct.

First, I remember that in psychology, there's a debate between nature (instincts, genetics) and nurture (environment, learning). So, some people argue that aggressive behavior is something we're born with, like an instinct, while others say it's learned from our surroundings.

Looking at the options, I see a lot of choices. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says aggressiveness is determined by genetics alone. That seems too extreme because most traits are a mix of genes and environment. So probably not the right answer.

Option B claims there's no instinctual basis, which would mean it's all learned. But I think some research suggests that aggression does have some biological components, so B might not be correct.

Option C states it's purely instinctual, which again is probably too absolute. Most behaviors are a mix, right?

Option D says it's only about immediate environment. That doesn't sound right because there's evidence that genetics play a role too.

Option E says it's only humans who are aggressive, which I know isn't true because animals exhibit aggression too. So E is out.

Option F suggests it can be completely removed through education. That seems unlikely because if there's a genetic component, education alone might not erase it entirely.

Option G says it's a mix of innate tendencies and learned responses. That sounds familiar. I think this is the interactionist view, which is pretty widely accepted. So G could be the right answer.

Option H claims it's solely learned, which again, ignores the biological aspect. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I talks about seasonal behavior, which doesn't make much sense in this context. Aggression isn't like migration, so I can skip I.

Option J says it only happens without societal structures. That doesn't seem right because aggression can occur even within societies.

Putting it all together, the contention is whether aggression is just instinct or learned. The general understanding is that it's both, so the correct answer should be G.

The question revolves around whether aggressiveness is instinctual, which touches on the debate between nature (instincts, genetics) and nurture (environment, learning). After evaluating the options:

- **A, C**: These options suggest aggressiveness is entirely genetic or instinctual, which is too extreme as most behaviors are a mix of both factors.
- **B, H**: These argue that aggressiveness is entirely learned or has no instinctual basis, which ignores the biological components supported by research.
- **D, E, I, J**: These options are either too narrow (e.g., only environmental, exclusive to humans, seasonal) or incorrect based on evidence.
- **F**: Suggests aggressiveness can be completely eradicated through education, which is unlikely due to potential genetic influences.
- **G**: This option aligns with the interactionist view, recognizing that aggressiveness results from a combination of innate tendencies and learned responses, which is widely accepted.

Thus, the most balanced and accurate answer is that aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses.
