Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the chi-squared probability distribution. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement is NOT true. Let's go through each option one by one.

The question is asking which statement is not true. So, the correct answer will be the false statement about the chi-squared distribution.

Starting with option A: "For small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness." I remember that the chi-squared distribution is always positively skewed because it's defined for values greater than 0. For small degrees of freedom (like 1 or 2), the distribution is skewed to the right, so the curve is skewed. So A is true. That means this is not the incorrect statement.

Option B: "The area under the χ2 curve is 1." Well, that's a fundamental property of probability distribution functions. The total area under the curve equals 1 because it represents the total probability. So B is true, not the answer.

Option C: "χ2 is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable." Yes, because the chi-squared variable is the sum of squares of standard normal variables, which are always non-negative. So the domain is 0 to infinity. So C is true, not the incorrect one.

Option D: "For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom decreases, the critical value for the rejection region increases." Hmm. The critical value in the chi-square distribution refers to the upper tail values. Let me think. When the degrees of freedom (df) decrease, the distribution shifts. For a given significance level α (like 0.05), the critical value is the point beyond which we reject the null hypothesis. Wait, when df decreases, does the critical value increase? Let me recall. For example, in the chi-square table, for a lower df at the same α, the critical value is higher. Because with fewer degrees of freedom, the chi-square variable has a lower mean and variance. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. For a smaller df, the distribution is more peaked towards the lower end. So for the same α, a lower df would require a higher critical value because the curve is more concentrated on the lower side. So yes, as df decreases, the critical value increases. So D is true, meaning it's not the incorrect statement.

Option E: "For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases." Wait, if df increases, the chi-square distribution becomes more spread out. The mean of the distribution is equal to the df. So as df increases, the mean shifts to the right. But the critical value is determined by the upper tail. I think that as df increases, the critical value for a given α actually increases because the distribution's tail extends further. Wait, no. Let me think about this. Suppose α is 0.05. For higher df, the critical value (the point where 5% is in the upper tail) becomes larger? Or smaller? Let me try with some numbers. For df=1, the 0.05 critical value is about 3.841. For df=5, it's 11.0705. For df=10, it's 18.307. So as df increases, the critical value increases. Oh wait, so option E says that as df increases, the critical value decreases. That can't be right. So option E is making a false statement. So E is the incorrect statement, which would be the answer to the question.

Wait, to double-check. The question is about which is NOT true. So the correct answer is E because it's not true that the critical value decreases as df increases. Instead, as df increases, the critical value for a given α increases.

To determine which statement is NOT true about the χ² probability distribution function, let us analyze each option:

**A:** "For small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness."  
This is true. The χ² distribution is always positively skewed, and for small degrees of freedom, the skewness is more pronounced.  

**B:** "The area under the χ² curve is 1."  
This is true. The total area under the curve of a probability distribution function, including the χ² distribution, is always 1.  

**C:** "χ² is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable."  
This is true. The χ² distribution is defined for nonnegative values because it represents the sum of squares of standard normal variables.  

**D:** "For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom decreases, the critical value for the rejection region increases."  
This is true. For a given significance level α, the critical value increases as the degrees of freedom decrease because the distribution becomes more concentrated toward lower values.  

**E:** "For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases."  
This is false. As the degrees of freedom increase, the mean and variance of the χ² distribution increase, causing the critical value for a given α to also increase, not decrease.  

The statement that is NOT true is **E**.
