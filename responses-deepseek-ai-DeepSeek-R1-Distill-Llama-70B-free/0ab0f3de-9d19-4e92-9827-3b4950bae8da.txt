Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The Chinese are all infidels: they worship images, and burn their dead just like the [Hindus]. The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan…In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China…
When we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand…In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]…"
Ibn Battuta, Voyages, 1332–1346 C.E.

Okay, so I've got this history question here about the Mongol administration comparing their rule in Russia and China. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives an excerpt from Ibn Battuta's travels, talking about China under Mongol rule. From what I remember, Ibn Battuta was a traveler who visited various places, including China during the Yuan dynasty, which was Mongol-ruled. The excerpt describes a pretty cosmopolitan city, Hangzhou, with Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks. It mentions that Muslims are numerous and treated well, with their own mosques and quarters. The city is well-organized with walls around districts, and there's a lot of trade and wealth.

So, the question is asking how the Mongol administration in their Russian domains differed from what's described here in China. The options are A to J, each pointing out a different contrast.

Let me recall what I know about Mongol rule in Russia versus China. The Mongols conquered both, but their administrative approaches might have been different.

In China, the Mongols established the Yuan dynasty. They took over an existing bureaucratic system, possibly adapting it. Kublai Khan, for example, tried to use the Chinese administrative structures but also maintained Mongol practices. They were pretty tolerant religiously, allowing various faiths to coexist, which aligns with Ibn Battuta's description of multiple religious groups in the cities.

In Russia, the Mongols (or the Golden Horde) ruled through a different system. They didn't set up a centralized bureaucracy like in China. Instead, they allowed local princes to rule as long as they paid tribute and acknowledged Mongol supremacy. So the Russian principalities had more autonomy, with the Mongols focusing on collecting tribute rather than direct administration.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Resulted in isolation of Russian territories, while China facilitated trade. I think the Mongols in China did facilitate trade, but I'm not sure about Russia being isolated. The Mongols actually helped create trade routes across Eurasia, including Russia as part of the Silk Road. So maybe this isn't the right difference.

Option B: Tolerant only of Orthodox Christianity in Russia, while China favored many religions. Wait, no, the Mongols in Russia were also pretty tolerant. They allowed Orthodox Christianity, Islam, and other religions. So B doesn't seem correct because both were tolerant, but perhaps in different ways.

Option C: Relied on tribute in Russia, while China emulated a centralized bureaucracy. That sounds right. China under Yuan had a more centralized system, using the existing bureaucracy. Russia was more about tribute and less direct control. So C looks like a possible answer.

Option D: Granted autonomy to local rulers in Russia, while China had direct control. Yes, that aligns with what I was thinking. So D might be correct. But wait, the question is how they differed. So the Mongol administration in Russia granted autonomy, while China had more direct control? Or was it the other way around?

Wait, the question asks, "differed in that..." So the correct option should point out that in Russia, they did X, whereas in China, they did Y.

So, looking at option C again: Russia relied on tribute, China had a centralized bureaucracy. That seems accurate. Option D says Russia granted autonomy, China imposed direct control. That also seems correct. So which is the better fit?

Wait, the question is about the administration's structure. In China, the Mongols set up a centralized system, perhaps emulating the Chinese model, using a bureaucracy. In Russia, they didn't establish such a system; instead, they managed through tribute and allowed local princes to rule as long as they complied. So option C says that: relied on tribute in Russia, emulated centralized bureaucracy in China. Yes, that fits.

Option D says Russia had autonomy, China direct control. That's somewhat similar. So which option is correct? The question is about the administrative approach.

I think the key difference is that in China, the Mongols set up a more centralized state, using the existing Chinese bureaucracy. In Russia, they didn't establish such a system; instead, they collected tribute and allowed local rulers to continue with their systems. So the difference is in the administrative structures.

Looking at the options again, option C says the Mongols in Russia relied on tribute, while in China, they emulated a centralized bureaucracy. That seems accurate.

Option G: Led to decline of cities in Russia, while China encouraged urban development. I'm not sure about that. I think Mongols in China did promote cities, especially as trade centers. In Russia, the Mongol rule might have led to some decline, but I'm not certain. So G could be a possibility, but I think C is more about administration.

Option H: Lacked administrative structure in Russia, while China had a robust system. That also sounds correct, but it's similar to C and D.

Wait, the question is about how the administration differed. So in Russia, the Mongols didn't impose a centralized system but instead relied on tribute and allowed local autonomy. In China, they used a centralized bureaucracy.

So option C says: "relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state." That seems spot on.

Another option is D: "granted autonomy to local rulers, while the Mongol administration in China imposed direct control." That's also a bit correct, but perhaps the main difference is in the administrative structures.

So between C and D. The question is about the Mongol administration's approach. The Russian domains were managed through tribute and local princes, without a centralized bureaucracy, whereas in China, they set up a more centralized state.

So option C is the correct answer.
</think>

The Mongol administration of its Russian domains and Chinese territories differed significantly in their approaches to governance. In China under the Yuan dynasty, the Mongols established a centralized bureaucratic state, emulating the existing Chinese administrative system. This approach facilitated international trade, cultural exchange, and urban development, as described in Ibn Battuta's account of Hangzhou. The Chinese system was characterized by direct control and a robust bureaucratic structure.

In contrast, the Mongols in Russia relied heavily on tribute from local principalities and granted autonomy to Russian rulers, allowing them to govern locally as long as they acknowledged Mongol supremacy and paid tribute. This system lacked the centralized bureaucratic structure seen in China and focused more on indirect control through tribute collection.

Among the options provided, the most accurate distinction is captured by **Option C**, which highlights that the Mongol administration in Russia relied on tribute, while in China, it emulated a centralized bureaucratic state.

Answer: C
