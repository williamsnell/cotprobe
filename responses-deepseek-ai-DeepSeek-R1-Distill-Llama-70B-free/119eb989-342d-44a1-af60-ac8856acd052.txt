Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields and charge in the Earth's atmosphere. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The electric field is directed vertically downward. At 300 meters altitude, the field is 60.0 N/C, and at 200 meters, it's 100 N/C. I need to find the net charge contained in a cube that's 100 meters on each edge. The cube has horizontal faces at 200m and 300m altitudes. Hmm, so the cube extends from 200m up to 300m, making its height 100m.

I remember something about Gauss's Law, which relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀. Wait, but wait—is the cube a closed surface? Oh, no, wait, the cube is a closed surface. Oh wait, no, wait again. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. The cube has six faces, but the problem only mentions horizontal faces at those two altitudes. Oh wait, no, the cube is just a regular cube, so all faces are there. But the cube's position is such that its top and bottom are at 300m and 200m, respectively.

Wait, but the cube is 100m on each edge, so each edge is 100m. So the cube is a 100m x 100m x 100m cube. So from 200m to 300m in altitude, that's the vertical direction. So the cube's bottom face is at 200m, top at 300m, and the four sides are vertical.

I think the approach is to calculate the electric flux through each face of the cube and sum them up, then use Gauss's Law to find the enclosed charge.

But wait, the cube's faces: the top and bottom are horizontal, and the four sides are vertical. The electric field is vertical, so the flux through the vertical faces would be zero because the field is parallel to the surface. Oh, right, because the electric field is vertical, and the normal vectors on the vertical faces are horizontal, so the dot product would be zero. So only the top and bottom faces contribute to the flux.

So the electric flux Φ is the sum of the flux through the top face and the bottom face. The flux through each face is E * A * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the electric field and the normal vector to the face.

Let's break this down. The electric field is directed downward. So for the top face, which is at 300m, the normal vector is upward. So theta between E (down) and normal (up) is 180 degrees. Cos(180) is -1.

Similarly, the bottom face is at 200m, and its normal vector is downward. So the angle between E (down) and normal (down) is 0 degrees. Cos(0) is 1.

Wait, wait, no—wait. The cube's faces: for the top face, the normal vector points upward, and the E-field points downward. So the angle is 180 degrees, so cos(theta) is -1. So the flux through the top face is E_top * A * (-1).

For the bottom face, the normal points downward, same direction as E. So theta is 0, cos(theta)=1. So flux is E_bottom * A * 1.

So the total flux is Φ = E_top * A * (-1) + E_bottom * A * 1.

Wait, but the top face is at 300m where E is 60 N/C, and the bottom is at 200m with E=100 N/C.

So substituting the values: Φ = (60) * A * (-1) + (100) * A * 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The cube's top face is at 300m. So when calculating the flux through the top face, the E is 60 N/C. Similarly, the bottom face at 200m has E=100 N/C.

So Φ = (-60 * A) + (100 * A) = (40) * A.

What's A? A is the area of each face. Since each face is a square of edge 100m, area is (100m)^2 = 10^4 m².

So A = 1e4 m².

So Φ = 40 * 1e4 = 4e5 N·m²/C.

Wait, but wait, the units: N/C * m² gives N·m²/C. Since 1 V = 1 N·m/C, so N·m²/C is (N·m/C)*m = V·m. But flux is dimensionless because it's E (V/m) * area (m²), so units would be (V/m)*(m²) = V*m, which is (J/C)*m, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating that. Anyway, the numerical value is 4e5.

Now, according to Gauss's Law, Φ = Q_enc / ε₀.

So Q_enc = Φ * ε₀.

What is ε₀? I remember ε₀ is about 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²).

So Q_enc = (4e5 N·m²/C) ) * (8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²)) )

Let me compute this. 4e5 * 8.85e-12 = ?

4e5 = 4 * 1e5 = 400,000.

So 400,000 * 8.85e-12 = (4 * 8.85) * 1e5 * 1e-12 = 35.4 * 1e-7 = 3.54e-6 C.

Wait, 3.54e-6 C is 3.54 microcoulombs. Checking the options, option C is 3.54 μC.

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the signs? Let me double-check.

The flux through the top face: E is 60 N/C downward, normal is upward. So the angle is 180 degrees, cos(theta) is -1. So flux is 60 * A * (-1) = -60A.

Flux through bottom face: E is 100 N/C downward, normal is downward. So cos(0)=1. So flux is 100 * A * 1 = +100A.

Total Φ = (-60A) + (100A) = 40A. So yes, that's correct.

Ah, wait, wait! A is 100m x 100m, which is 1e4 m². So 40 * 1e4 = 4e5.

So Φ=4e5.

Then Q_enc=Φ*ε₀=4e5 *8.85e-12.

Calculating that:

4 *8.85 = 35.4.

1e5 * 1e-12 = 1e-7.

So 35.4e-7 C is 3.54e-6 C, which is 3.54 microcoulombs. So yes, option C.

To solve the problem, we use Gauss's Law, which states:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
\]

where \( \Phi \) is the net electric flux through the closed surface, \( Q_{\text{enc}} \) is the total charge enclosed, and \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m^2)} \) is the permittivity of free space.

### Step 1: Analyze the cube and the electric field
The cube has edge length \( 100 \, \mathrm{m} \), so the area of each face is:

\[
A = (100 \, \mathrm{m})^2 = 10^4 \, \mathrm{m^2}
\]

The cube extends from an altitude of \( 200 \, \mathrm{m} \) (bottom face) to \( 300 \, \mathrm{m} \) (top face). The electric field is vertically downward, with magnitudes \( E_{\text{top}} = 60.0 \, \mathrm{N/C} \) at \( 300 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( E_{\text{bottom}} = 100 \, \mathrm{N/C} \) at \( 200 \, \mathrm{m} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the electric flux through the cube
The electric flux through a surface is given by:

\[
\Phi = E \cdot A \cdot \cos\theta
\]

- **Top face (at \( 300 \, \mathrm{m} \)):** The normal vector points upward, while the electric field points downward. The angle between them is \( 180^\circ \), so \( \cos(180^\circ) = -1 \). The flux through the top face is:

\[
\Phi_{\text{top}} = E_{\text{top}} \cdot A \cdot (-1) = (60.0 \, \mathrm{N/C}) \cdot (10^4 \, \mathrm{m^2}) \cdot (-1) = -6.0 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2/C}
\]

- **Bottom face (at \( 200 \, \mathrm{m} \)):** The normal vector points downward, and the electric field also points downward. The angle between them is \( 0^\circ \), so \( \cos(0^\circ) = 1 \). The flux through the bottom face is:

\[
\Phi_{\text{bottom}} = E_{\text{bottom}} \cdot A \cdot (1) = (100 \, \mathrm{N/C}) \cdot (10^4 \, \mathrm{m^2}) \cdot (1) = 10^6 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2/C}
\]

- **Vertical faces:** The electric field is parallel to the normal vectors of the vertical faces, so the flux through these faces is zero.

The total flux through the cube is:

\[
\Phi = \Phi_{\text{top}} + \Phi_{\text{bottom}} = (-6.0 \times 10^5) + (10^6) = 4.0 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2/C}
\]

### Step 3: Use Gauss's Law to find the enclosed charge
From Gauss's Law:

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = \Phi \cdot \epsilon_0
\]

Substitute \( \Phi = 4.0 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2/C} \) and \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m^2)} \):

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = (4.0 \times 10^5) \cdot (8.85 \times 10^{-12}) = 3.54 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

Convert to microcoulombs (\( 1 \, \mu\mathrm{C} = 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \)):

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = 3.54 \, \mu\mathrm{C}
\]

### Final Answer:
The net charge enclosed in the cube is \( 3.54 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
