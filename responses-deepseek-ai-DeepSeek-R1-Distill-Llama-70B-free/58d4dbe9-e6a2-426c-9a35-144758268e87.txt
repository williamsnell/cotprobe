Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly answers the question about the basic code of ethical research. The question is asking about the establishment of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. I remember these are the three main principles in research ethics, but I'm a bit fuzzy on which document or organization introduced them first.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: World Medical Association (WMA). I know they're involved in medical ethics, especially with the Declaration of Helsinki. But wait, wasn't that more about human rights in research rather than establishing these three principles?

Option B: UNESCO. They deal with broader issues like education, culture, science. I don't recall them being the ones to set these specific principles for research ethics.

Option C: Geneva Convention. That's related to conduct during war and treatment of prisoners, not directly related to research ethics principles.

Option D: World Health Organization (WHO). They're involved in global health, but I'm not sure if they were the first to set these three principles.

Option E: Declaration of Helsinki. That's a set of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. It was established by WMA, right? So it's more about guiding principles but maybe not the origin of the three basics.

Option F: Nuremberg Code. I remember this came after WWII, addressing issues from the Nazi experiments. It has ten points, but I think it focuses more on informed consent and voluntary participation. Not sure if it's the source of the three principles mentioned.

Option G: CIOMS. That's the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. They have guidelines, but I think they build on earlier principles rather than being the first.

Option H: ICMJE. That's about journal editing, so probably not relevant here.

Option I: Belmont Report. Ah, yes! The Belmont Report was created in 1978 by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in the United States. It established the three principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. So this might be the correct answer.

Option J: APA. American Psychological Association has ethical guidelines, but I don't think they were the first to establish these three principles in research ethics.

Wait, but I should double-check. The Nuremberg Code came first, in 1947, and while it's foundational, it's more about informed consent. The Belmont Report, from 1978, laid out the three principles explicitly. So the question is about when these three were first established. The Belmont Report is likely the origin.

So the answer should be I: Belmont Report.

The three principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in research ethics were first explicitly established by the Belmont Report. Created in 1978 by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in the United States, the Belmont Report is the foundational document that outlined these principles.
