Okay, so I need to figure out how many calories are in 6 ounces of this ice cream. The problem says that 4 ounces have 230 calories. Hmm, I think I can solve this by finding out how many calories are in one ounce first and then multiply that by six.

Alright, let me start by dividing the total calories by the number of ounces. So 230 calories divided by 4 ounces. Wait, let me do that calculation. 230 divided by 4... 4 times 50 is 200, so that leaves 30. 4 times 7 is 28, so that's 57.5 calories per ounce. Oh wait, no, wait. 230 divided by 4 is actually 57.5. Yeah, because 4 times 57 is 228, and then there's 2 left, which makes it 57.5.

Now that I know each ounce has 57.5 calories, I can find out what 6 ounces would be. So I multiply 57.5 by 6. Let me think about how to do that. 57 times 6 is 342, and then 0.5 times 6 is 3, so adding those together gives 345 calories. 

Wait, but let me check my calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 57.5 times 6: 50 times 6 is 300, 7 times 6 is 42, and 0.5 times 6 is 3. So adding 300 + 42 is 342, plus 3 is 345. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option H is 345. So the answer should be H.

To determine the number of calories in 6 ounces of ice cream, first calculate the calories per ounce by dividing 230 calories by 4 ounces, which equals 57.5 calories per ounce. Multiply this by 6 ounces to get 345 calories. 

The correct answer is H: 345.
