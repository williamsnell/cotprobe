The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order

Options:

A: valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.
B: valid, because the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergency relief efforts.
C: invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.
D: invalid, because the executive order did not specify the scope of the relief operations.
E: invalid, because the executive order infringes upon the rights of federal employees.
F: invalid, because the INS does not have jurisdiction in foreign countries.
G: valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.
H: valid, because the president's executive power extends to directing federal agencies in times of crisis.
I: valid, because the President has the power to issue executive orders in times of emergency.
J: invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a legal scenario involving the President's executive order. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that a devastating earthquake hit a foreign country, causing a lot of destruction and loss of life. The leader of that country asked the U.S. for help. The President wanted to send troops but they were unavailable, so he issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the INS to go assist in the rescue operations. This agency's main job is to patrol borders to prevent illegal entry.

A member of this agency refused, saying this is beyond his job responsibilities and sued, challenging the order's validity. The question is whether the court should rule the executive order valid or invalid.

The options are A through J. I need to figure out the correct answer based on what I know about presidential powers and administrative law.

First, let me think about the President's authority. The President has various powers, including being the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. However, this agency isn't military; it's under the INS, which is a federal agency. The main function of the agency is border patrol, not international rescue missions.

So the issue is whether the President can redirect federal employees to perform tasks outside their usual duties, especially in a foreign country, without Congressional authorization.

I remember that the President has broad executive power under Article II of the Constitution, which says the President "shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." But does that include redirecting agencies in emergencies?

Wait, there's also something about inherent presidential powers, especially in foreign affairs. But in this case, it's about using a domestic agency for a foreign relief effort. Is that within the President's authority?

I think about the case where the Supreme Court has sometimes upheld the President's ability to act in emergencies, but also that Congress has to authorize certain actions, especially those that are beyond the President's inherent powers.

The member argues that the order is beyond his job scope. So the question is whether the President can unilaterally expand the duties of federal employees in this way.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's valid because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority. But wait, the commander-in-chief power mainly applies to the military, not civilian agencies. So maybe A is incorrect because this agency isn't part of the military.

Option B says it's valid because the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergencies. I'm not sure. Does the President have that authority without Congress?

Option C says invalid because it's beyond presidential power without Congress. That sounds plausible if the action requires Congressional approval.

Option F says invalid because INS doesn't have jurisdiction abroad. That's a possibility. The agency's role is domestic, so maybe they can't operate outside the U.S.

Option G says valid because employees can be required to perform emergency functions. I'm not sure about that; it depends on whether the President can assign new duties unilaterally.

Option J says invalid because the INS director, not the President, has the power. That could be if the President is overstepping by issuing orders directly to an agency under another director.

Hmm. I think the key issue is whether the President can direct a federal agency, under another department (like INS), to perform duties outside their normal scope without Congress's authorization.

I recall that in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, the Supreme Court limited the President's ability to seize property without Congressional authorization, even in an emergency. So maybe without Congress allowing it, the President can't expand the agency's role like this.

Also, federal agencies are created by Congress, and their powers are defined by their enabling statutes. If the INS agency's statute doesn't allow for international operations, then the President's order would be beyond his authority.

So looking back, option C says the order is invalid without Congressional authorization. That seems correct because the President can't on his own expand the agency's mission beyond what Congress set.

Option F is about jurisdiction. If the agency's authority is only within the U.S., then operating abroad would be beyond their jurisdiction. That might also make the order invalid.

Between C and F. Which is more accurate? The question is about the scope of presidential power. If the agency's enabling statute doesn't allow foreign operations, then the President can't order them to do it. So, the order would be beyond the President's authority without Congress.

Alternatively, if the President's emergency powers allow him to repurpose agencies, but I don't think that's the case unless there's a statute backing it.

So I'm leaning towards C or F. But the question is about the President's authority, not the agency's jurisdiction. So option C is about the President's power needing Congressional authorization, which I think is correct.

Wait, another angle: the President's power as the head of the executive branch. He can direct executive agencies, right? So maybe he can order any federal employee to do something as part of their duties, even if it's outside their usual role, especially in emergencies.

But is that the case? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. If the President can order any executive branch employee to perform any duty, then maybe the order is valid. But I think there are limits, especially if it's not within the agency's mission or if it's not authorized by Congress.

So perhaps option G is correct, saying it's valid because the President can require federal employees to perform emergency functions.

Wait, but the agency is under the INS. So the President's authority over them depends on whether he has the power to direct any executive agency. I think the President does have authority over all executive branch agencies, but whether he can assign duties that are outside their statutory responsibilities is the question.

In that case, if the agency's statute doesn't allow for foreign operations, the President can't order them to do it. So the correct reason would be that it's beyond his power without Congress.

So I think the correct answer is C: invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.

The question revolves around whether the President's executive order directing a federal agency under the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to engage in emergency rescue operations in a foreign country is valid. The agency's primary role is border patrol, and the member challenging the order argues that such operations are beyond the scope of their job responsibilities.

Key considerations include the President's authority under Article II of the Constitution, particularly the power to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," as well as inherent powers in foreign affairs and emergencies. However, the President's ability to unilaterally redirect federal agencies to perform tasks outside their statutory responsibilities, especially in a foreign context, is limited without Congressional authorization. Federal agencies are created by Congress, and their powers are defined by their enabling statutes. If the agency's statute does not permit international operations, the President cannot expand its mission without Congressional approval.

Option C correctly identifies that the executive order is invalid because it exceeds the President's authority absent Congressional authorization. While the President has broad executive powers, repurposing a federal agency for foreign operations without statutory backing oversteps those limits. Other options, such as jurisdictional concerns (Option F) or the President's authority over federal employees (Option G), are less precise in addressing the core issue of presidential overreach.
