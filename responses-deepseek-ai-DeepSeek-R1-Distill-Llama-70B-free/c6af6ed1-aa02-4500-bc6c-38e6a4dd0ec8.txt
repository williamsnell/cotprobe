Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the equilibrium polarization of 13C nuclei in a 20.0 T magnetic field at 300 K. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

I remember that polarization in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has to do with the distribution of spins in a magnetic field. The formula for equilibrium polarization probably involves the Boltzmann distribution because it's about the population of spin states at thermal equilibrium.

Wait, the polarization (P) is given by the formula P = (N_up - N_down) / (N_up + N_down), right? But another approach might be to use the Brillouin function or maybe the high-temperature approximation since 300 K isn't extremely low.

Wait, carbon-13 has a nuclear spin I of 1/2, right? Because 13C has an atomic number of 6, and its isotope 13 has 7 neutrons. So for spin-1/2 nuclei, the polarization can be approximated using P ≈ (μ_B * B) / (k_B * T), but wait, no, that's for electrons maybe. Oh wait, no, for nuclei, the magnetic moment is much smaller.

Wait, the general formula for nuclear polarization when the nuclei are spin-1/2 is given by the hyperbolic tangent of (μB/(kT)), but considering that μ here is the nuclear magneton times the gyromagnetic ratio, perhaps. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Hold on. The formula I think is P = tanh( (μ·B)/(k_B·T) ), where μ is the magnetic moment of the nucleus. But wait, for spin-1/2, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = γħI, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and I is the spin quantum number. But I=1/2, so μ = γħ*(1/2).

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium polarization for a two-level system (like spin-1/2) is P = (e^{x} - e^{-x}) / (e^{x} + e^{-x}) ) where x is (μB)/(k_B T). But that's the same as tanh(x). So P = tanh( (μB) / (k_B T) )

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Maybe I should look up the formula for nuclear polarization. Oh wait, in the context of NMR, the polarization is given by the spin alignment. For high temperatures, when the thermal energy (k_B T) is much larger than the Zeeman energy (μB), the polarization is small. So perhaps we can approximate tanh(x) ≈ x when x is small.

So if x = μB/(k_B T) is small, then P ≈ μB/(k_B T).

But wait, what's μ for 13C? The magnetic moment μ for a nucleus is given by μ = g_I * μ_N * I, where g_I is the gyromagnetic ratio (or g-factor) for the nucleus, μ_N is the nuclear magneton, and I is the spin quantum number. For 13C, I think the g-factor is around 1, and I is 1/2.

Wait, no. Let me recall: For protons, the g-factor is about 5.586, but for 13C, I think it's lower. Oh wait, the gyromagnetic ratio for carbon-13 is about 10.71 MHz/T, I think. But wait, the magnetic moment μ is related to the gyromagnetic ratio γ by μ = γ ħ / (2π). Or maybe γ is defined as μ/(Iħ), so μ = γ I ħ.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C. Oh wait, I can't, but I remember that for 13C, γ is approximately 10.708 MHz/T. So γ = 10.708e6 Hz/T.

Then, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = γ ħ / (2π). Let's compute that.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So μ = (10.708e6 Hz/T) * (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2π). Let's calculate that.

But maybe it's easier to use the relation in terms of the nuclear magneton μ_N. Because μ_N = (eħ)/(2m_p) ≈ 5.0507837e-27 J/T.

So, for a nucleus, μ = g_I * μ_N * I. For 13C, I = 1/2, so μ = (g_I) * μ_N * (1/2). What's the g-factor for 13C? I think for 13C, the g-factor is approximately 1. I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed with that assumption. So μ = (1) * μ_N * (1/2) = μ_N / 2.

So μ = (5.0507837e-27 J/T) / 2 ≈ 2.52539185e-27 J/T.

Now, the magnetic field B is 20.0 T. So the Zeeman energy is μB = (2.525e-27 J/T)(20.0 T) = 5.05e-26 J.

The thermal energy k_B T is (1.380649e-23 J/K)(300 K) = 4.141947e-21 J.

So the ratio x = (μB)/(k_B T) = (5.05e-26) / (4.141947e-21) ≈ 1.219e-5.

Hmm, that's a small number, so the approximation P ≈ x should hold. So P ≈ 1.219e-5.

Wait, but let me compute tanh(x) exactly. For x = 1.219e-5, tanh(x) ≈ x - x^3/3 + ... So the approximation P ≈ x is pretty accurate here, as x is small. So P ≈ 1.219e-5.

Looking at the options, let me see:

Option E is 1.71e-5, which is larger. Option J is 2.05e-5, which is even larger. Option C is 3.43e-5, which is higher. Option A is 7.39e-5, way higher.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating μ. Because I think I might have confused the gyromagnetic ratio with something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the gyromagnetic ratio γ for 13C is about 10.708 MHz/T. So γ = 10.708e6 Hz/T.

The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = γ ħ / (2π) * (I), where I is the spin quantum number. Since I=1/2, it's:

μ = (10.708e6 Hz/T) * (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2π) * (1/2)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate γ * ħ / (2π):

10.708e6 Hz/T * 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.128e-27 J·T^-1·s^-1 * Hz (Hz is 1/s) → J·T^-1.

Wait, Hz is s^-1, so when you multiply by s, the units become J·T^-1.

Wait, perhaps better to compute numerically.

10.708e6 = 1.0708e7.

So 1.0708e7 * 1.0545718e-34 = approx 1.0708e7 * 1.0545718e-34 = (1.0708 *1.0545718) * 1e7 * 1e-34 → 1.127e-27.

Then, divide by 2π: 1.127e-27 / 6.283 ≈ 1.794e-28 J·T^-1.

Then multiply by I=1/2 → 1.794e-28 * 0.5 = 8.97e-29 J/T.

So μ ≈ 8.97e-29 J/T.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when calculating via g-factor.

Wait, let's see. The other approach was using g_I * μ_N * I. If g_I is 1, I=1/2, then μ = (1)*(5.05e-27 J/T)/2 = 2.525e-27 J/T, which is much larger than the 8.97e-29 J/T from the other method. So that suggests a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I got the g-factor wrong. Maybe the g-factor for 13C isn't 1. Let me think. Carbon-13 has a nuclear g-factor of approximately 1.404, if I remember correctly. Wait, no, that's for protons. Wait, for 13C, I think the g-factor is about 1. I might be mixing up with electron g-factors.

Wait, perhaps I should use the gyromagnetic ratio approach because it's more direct. Since the gyromagnetic ratio is given in MHz/T, that's a known value, so using that to compute μ makes sense.

So, using the gyromagnetic ratio:

γ = 10.708e6 Hz/T.

μ = γ * ħ * I / (2π).

As I computed, that gives μ ≈ 8.97e-29 J/T.

Wait, let me do the calculation more accurately.

Compute γ * ħ: 10.708e6 Hz/T * 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 

Let me compute 10.708e6 * 1.0545718e-34 = 

10.708e6 = 1.0708e7

1.0708e7 * 1.0545718e-34 = 

1.0708 *1.0545718 = approx 1.127.

So 1.127e7-34 → 1.127e-27 J·T^-1·Hz^-1? Wait, no, Hz is per second, so Hz*T would be in per second times Tesla? Maybe I'm getting confused with units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of energy. The magnetic moment μ produces a magnetic energy μ·B. The energy is in joules.

But let's proceed with the numbers:

γ (gyromagnetic ratio) = 10.708e6 Hz/T.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, γ * ħ = (10.708e6 Hz/T) * (1.0545718e-34 J·s) → the Hz and s units cancel, leaving J/T.

So, 10.708e6 * 1.0545718e-34 = 1.127e-27 J/T.

Then, divide by 2π to get μ:

μ = (1.127e-27 J/T) / (2π) ≈ 1.127e-27 /6.283 ≈ 1.794e-28 J/T.

Then, since I=1/2, μ = 1.794e-28 * (1/2) = 8.97e-29 J/T.

Wait, but earlier approach via g-factor gave me μ ≈ 2.525e-27 J/T, which is about 28 times larger. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the gyromagnetic ratio approach is the accurate one because the gyromagnetic ratio is a known value. So I should proceed with μ = 8.97e-29 J/T.

So then, the Zeeman energy is μ*B = (8.97e-29 J/T) * 20 T = 1.794e-27 J.

Thermal energy k_B*T = 1.380649e-23 J/K * 300 K = 4.141947e-21 J.

So x = (μB)/(k_B T) = 1.794e-27 / 4.141947e-21 ≈ 4.33e-7.

Wait, that's a very small x, much smaller than before. So the polarization P ≈ x, because tanh(x) ≈ x when x is small.

So P ≈ 4.33e-7.

Looking at the options, none of them are that small. The options are all on the order of 1e-5. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me double-check the gyromagnetic ratio approach.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me re-examine the formula for the magnetic moment.

Ah! Wait, the magnetic moment is given by μ = γ ħ I, where I is the spin quantum number. So for I=1/2, it's γ ħ (1/2).

Wait, but I think the correct formula is μ = γ (ħ/2) I, or perhaps (γ ħ) * I. Let me clarify.

The gyromagnetic ratio γ is defined as γ = (q μ_N)/(ħ) ), where q is the charge, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, the relation is μ = γ ħ I. So for I = 1/2, μ = γ ħ (1/2).

Wait, maybe I should have included the 1/2 factor earlier. Let me recalculate.

So μ = γ * ħ * (I), where I=1/2.

So, γ = 10.708e6 Hz/T.

Then, μ = 10.708e6 Hz/T * 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1/2) → because I=1/2.

Compute 10.708e6 * 1.0545718e-34 = same as before, 1.127e-27 J/T.

Then multiply by 1/2: 1.127e-27 * 0.5 = 5.635e-28 J/T.

So μ = 5.635e-28 J/T.

Wait, but earlier I got 8.97e-29 when I included the division by 2π. Hmm, perhaps I confused something. Maybe I should not have divided by 2π. Let me think about the units.

Wait, the gyromagnetic ratio γ is in units of Hz/T. When you multiply by Planck's constant (J·s), you get J/(T·s) * s = J/T.

So, μ = γ * ħ * I. So that would be (Hz/T) * (J·s) * (dimensionless I) → Hz is 1/s, so (1/s·T) * J·s = J/(T).

Yes, so μ has units of J/T, which is correct for magnetic moment.

So, with γ=10.708e6 Hz/T, I=1/2:

μ = 10.708e6 * 1.0545718e-34 * 0.5 = ?

Compute 10.708e6 = 1.0708e7.

1.0708e7 * 1.0545718e-34 = 1.127e-27 J/T.

Multiply by 0.5: 5.635e-28 J/T.

So μ ≈ 5.635e-28 J/T.

Now, μB = 5.635e-28 J/T * 20 T = 1.127e-26 J.

k_B*T = 1.38e-23 * 300 = 4.14e-21 J.

x = (1.127e-26) / (4.14e-21) ≈ 2.724e-6.

So x ≈ 2.724e-6, which is still a small value. So P ≈ x ≈ 2.724e-6, which is 2.724 x 10^-6.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 1.71e-5, or option J:2.05e-5, but none is as small as 2.7e-6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me try another approach.

Wait, the resonance frequency for 13C in a 20 T field is given by the Larmor frequency ω = γ B. So ω = (10.708e6 Hz/T) * 20 T = 214.16e6 Hz.

But the thermal energy is k_B T. So the ratio is ℏω/(k_B T), where ℏ is h/(2π), but wait, ω is already in radians per second. So ℏω = ħ * ω.

Wait, let me compute ℏω/(k_B T):

ℏ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ω = 10.708e6 Hz/T * 20 T = 2.1416e8 Hz.

So ℏω = 1.0545718e-34 * 2.1416e8 = approx 2.258e-26 J.

k_B T = 4.14e-21 J.

So (ℏω)/(k_B T) = 2.258e-26 / 4.14e-21 ≈ 5.456e-6.

So x = ℏω/(k_B T) ≈ 5.456e-6.

Wait, but earlier I had x ≈ 2.7e-6. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Because in the earlier approach, I was using μB/(k_B T), but μ is related to ℏω. Let me think.

Actually, μB = (γ ħ I) B. Since I =1/2, μB = (γ ħ (1/2)) B = (γ ħ B)/2.

But ω = γ B, so μB = (ħ ω)/2.

Thus, μB/(k_B T) = (ħ ω)/(2 k_B T) = x/2, where x is (ħ ω)/(k_B T).

So in the earlier approach, the ratio was 5.456e-6, so x = (μB)/(k_B T) would be half that, which is about 2.728e-6.

Which matches the previous calculation.

So the polarization P ≈ x = 2.728e-6.

But the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute without approximations. Compute tanh(x), where x=2.7e-6.

tanh(x) ≈ x - x^3/3. So
