Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this murder question. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the defendant hated the victim and decided to kill him. He put a loaded gun in his coat pocket and went for a walk, not sure if or when he'd see the victim. Then he went into a bar, had several beers, got intoxicated. On his way home, he bumped into the victim, recognized him, pulled out the gun, and shot and killed him.

The jurisdiction says first-degree murder is premeditated and deliberate killing. All other murders are second-degree. So the question is, what is the defendant guilty of?

Hmm. I remember that premeditation is a key element for first-degree murder. But wait, when did the premeditation happen? The defendant initially planned to kill the victim and even took the gun with him. But he was walking around not sure when he'd see the victim. Then he went to the bar, got drunk, and then the encounter happened.

Wait, does the initial plan count even if he was intoxicated later? Or does the intoxication affect his ability to premeditate?

I think about the concept of specific intent crimes. First-degree murder requires premeditation and deliberation, which are specific intents. Intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent. But when does the intoxication happen in relation to the planning?

In this case, the defendant formed the intent to kill before getting intoxicated. But when he actually committed the act, he was drunk. So, does that mean he couldn't form the specific intent required for first-degree murder at the time of the act?

Wait, but the initial plan was to kill, but the actual killing happened after he became intoxicated. So, the question is whether the premeditation was formed before intoxication, and whether the act was still deliberate.

I think that even if the initial intent was there, if at the time of the act, due to intoxication, he couldn't form the specific intent required, then he can't be guilty of first-degree murder. But wait, in some jurisdictions, if the defendant was voluntarily intoxicated, it doesn't negate premeditation if the plan was formed before intoxication.

Wait, maybe the rule is that voluntary intoxication can negate specific intent but doesn't negate general intent. So, for first-degree murder, which requires specific intent (premeditation), intoxication could reduce the crime to second-degree murder, which might be a general intent crime.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions hold that if the defendant, when sober, formed the intent to kill, and later, while intoxicated, carries out the act, the premeditation is still present because the initial plan was deliberate.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of the timeline:

1. Defendant decides to kill the victim (premeditation when sober).
2. He takes the gun, walks around, then goes to a bar.
3. He drinks, becomes intoxicated.
4. Later, he encounters the victim, recognizes him, and shoots him.

At the time of the shooting, he was intoxicated. But the act of shooting was intentionalâ€”he pulled out the gun and shot. So, even though he was drunk, he still formed the intent to kill at that moment. Or did the intoxication prevent him from deliberating?

Wait, but premeditation can be formed even a short time before the act. So, when he saw the victim, he recognized him, and then decided to shoot. But was that decision made with the required deliberation, or was it impulsive because of intoxication?

Alternatively, maybe the initial plan was premeditated, but the actual execution was on the spot. So, does that count as premeditated? Or does the intoxication negate the ability to deliberate at the time of the act.

I think the key here is whether the defendant had the capacity to form the specific intent required for first-degree murder at the time of the killing. If he was so intoxicated that he couldn't deliberate, then he couldn't form the specific intent. But if he could still form the intent despite being drunk, then it's first-degree.

But wait, in many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication doesn't negate premeditation if the defendant was capable of forming that intent while intoxicated. Or perhaps, the initial plan was already premeditated, so even if he was drunk, the act was a execution of that plan.

Alternatively, some courts might consider that the defendant, when sober, formed the intent, and the later intoxication doesn't break the chain of premeditation.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about possible outcomes.

If the defendant is guilty of first-degree murder, the answer would be B. If not, maybe second-degree (C) or voluntary manslaughter (A) or something else.

Wait, another angle: the initial intent was premeditated, but the actual killing was impulsive because he was drunk. So, maybe the killing wasn't deliberate at the time, but it was a deliberate act to shoot. So, perhaps it's still first-degree because the initial premeditation was there, and the act was intentional.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intoxication negates the deliberation required, reducing it to second-degree murder.

Wait, another point: in some jurisdictions, the time between the formation of the intent and the act can affect whether it's considered premeditated. If the defendant had time to cool off, but in this case, he was walking around, then drinking, which might have caused him to act impulsively when he saw the victim.

Wait, but the initial intent was formed before he got drunk. So, perhaps the premeditation was already done, and the actual act was the execution of that premeditated plan. So, even if he was drunk, the act was intentional and part of the premeditated plan.

But I'm still not entirely certain. If the defendant was so intoxicated that he couldn't form the specific intent to kill at the time, then first-degree murder wouldn't apply. But if he could still form that intent despite being drunk, then it's first-degree.

I think that in many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication can negate specific intent, but if the defendant's actions show that he was aware of what he was doing, then the intoxication doesn't serve as an excuse. In this case, he recognized the victim, pulled out the gun, aimed, and shot. Those are intentional actions, suggesting that he had the specific intent even while intoxicated.

So, perhaps the correct answer is first-degree murder, option B.

Wait, but another possibility: the defendant formed the intent to kill when sober, but the actual killing was on the spot when drunk. Does that mean it was premeditated? Or was the killing spontaneous because he was under the influence.

Alternatively, maybe the initial plan was to kill, but the actual encounter was sudden, so perhaps it's not premeditated because he didn't plan the exact time and place. But the initial intent was there, and when the opportunity arose, he acted on it.

I think the key is that premeditation can be formed even shortly before the act. So, when he saw the victim, he had the intent to kill, which was premeditated from before, and thus the killing was deliberate.

So, perhaps the answer is B: first-degree murder.

Alternatively, maybe the intoxication negates the deliberation, making it second-degree. But I'm leaning towards B because the initial intent was premeditated, and the act was intentional.

The defendant initially formed the intent to kill the victim while sober, which satisfies the premeditation element of first-degree murder. Although the defendant later became intoxicated, the act of shooting the victim was intentional, as evidenced by recognizing the victim, pulling out the gun, and firing. In many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication does not negate premeditation if the defendant was capable of forming the intent to kill, even while intoxicated. The initial plan to kill and the intentional act of shooting support the conclusion that the killing was premeditated and deliberate. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of first-degree murder.

Answer: B
