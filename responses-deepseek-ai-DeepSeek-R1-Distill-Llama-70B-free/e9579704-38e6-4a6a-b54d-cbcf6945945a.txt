Question:

A brother and a sister purchased land under a deed that conveyed title to them as joint tenants with right ofsurvivorship. Common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. The purchase price was $50,000, of which the sister paid $10,000 and the brother paid $40,000. The sisterlater mortgaged her interest in the land. The brother then died testate, leaving his entire estate to a cousin. Thesister later paid off her mortgage debt, and the mortgage was released. At the present time, who owns the land?

Options:

A: Title is entirely in the cousin as the beneficiary of the brother's will.
B: The answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory ofmortgages.
C: The brother's share of the land is in probate, while the sister retains her original share.
D: Title is in the sister, the cousin, and the mortgage lender as tenants in common.
E: Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 40% interest and the cousin having a 60% interest.
F: Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.
G: Title is in the sister and the cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship.
H: Title is in the sister as she has paid off her mortgage debt.
I: Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and thecousin having an 80% interest.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically joint tenancy and mortgages. Hmm, I need to figure out who owns the land now based on the given scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the brother and sister bought land as joint tenants with right of survivorship. I remember that in a joint tenancy, when one dies, the survivor automatically gets the entire property. That's the right of survivorship. So, if the brother dies, the sister would normally get his share, right?

But wait, there are some other factors here. The purchase price was $50,000. The sister paid $10k, and the brother paid $40k. So, they didn't contribute equally. I'm trying to remember how contributions affect joint tenancy. Oh right, in joint tenancy, the idea is that they each own an undivided half, regardless of how much each contributed. So the unequal payment doesn't change their ownership percentages—each is considered to own 50%.

Next, the sister mortgaged her interest. So she took a mortgage on her half. But then the brother died. Since they were joint tenants, the sister should have the right of survivorship, meaning she'd get the brother's half. But wait, what happens when one joint tenant mortgages their interest and then the other dies?

I think when the sister took out the mortgage, she only mortgaged her own interest. So the mortgage would be on her 50% share. But when the brother dies, her share would then become 100% because of survivorship. But wait, does the mortgage affect that?

Wait, no. The mortgage was only on her interest before the brother died. So when the brother dies, his 50% goes to her, making her the sole owner. But the mortgage was on her original 50%, not the brother's. So after the brother dies, she owns 100%, but she still has the mortgage on her original half. But then she paid off the mortgage, so that lien is released. So the mortgage being paid off means the lien is removed. So after that, she owns the whole thing free and clear?

Wait, but let's think again. At the time of the brother's death, the sister's 50% was mortgaged. But upon the brother's death, her interest increases to 100% by survivorship. Does the mortgage encumber the entire property now? Or just her original 50%?

I think the mortgage only affects her own share. So when she dies, the mortgagee's interest would only be on her 50%, but since she survives, she could pay it off. So after paying off the mortgage, the land is free of that lien.

So, the brother's will left everything to his cousin. But in joint tenancy, the brother's interest would pass to the sister by survivorship, not through the will. So the cousin wouldn't get any interest through the will because the brother didn't own the property at his death—it already passed to the sister.

Wait, but wait again. Does the mortgage affect the transfer? When the sister mortgages her interest, does that create some kind of lien that affects the survivorship?

In some jurisdictions, mortgages are treated differently. If the jurisdiction follows the lien theory, a mortgage is just a lien against the property. If it's the title theory, the mortgagee actually holds legal title until the mortgage is paid off.

So in lien theory states, when the brother dies, the sister's interest becomes 100%, but the mortgage was a lien on her 50%, which would encumber the entire property once she owns it. But since she paid off the mortgage, that lien is removed.

In title theory states, the mortgagee holds the legal title. So when the sister mortgages her interest, the title is with the mortgagee. But upon repayment, the title would revert to her. So if the brother dies, and she is the survivor, she would own the entire property, but the mortgagee had title to her 50% until she repaid it.

Wait, but the brother's death would complicate things. Let me think: when the sister mortgages her interest, which is 50%, and then the brother dies, the sister becomes the sole owner. But the mortgage was on her 50%, which would now be 100% because she owns the whole thing. So in title theory states, does the mortgagee's interest extend to the entire property once the sister becomes the sole owner?

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage only affected her 50% before the brother died. Once he dies, the sister's 50% becomes 100%, but the mortgage was only on the 50%. So upon repayment, the mortgage is lifted, and she owns everything.

But let's think about the options. Option B says the answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien or title theory. Hmm, so maybe that's the case.

Wait, if it's a lien theory state, the mortgage is a lien on her 50%. When she becomes the sole owner, she still has that lien on her 50%, which is now 100% of the property. So the mortgage would encumber the entire property, and upon repayment, the lien is removed.

In a title theory state, the mortgagee actually holds the title to her 50%. So when the brother dies, the sister's 50% is mortgaged, but the brother's 50% is not. So the sister's 50% is mortgaged, but upon the brother's death, she gets his 50%, making her the 100% owner. But her 50% was under mortgage, so the mortgagee has title to her 50%, and the brother's 50% is free. So when she repays the mortgage, she gets title back to her 50%, and already owns the brother's 50%, so she's the full owner.

In either case, after paying off the mortgage, she owns the entire property. So the cousin doesn't get anything because the brother's interest passed to the sister through survivorship before the will took effect.

Wait, but the options include some where the cousin has an interest. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Because in joint tenancy, the brother's will can't transfer his interest because he didn't own it at death—it passed to the sister. So the cousin gets nothing. Therefore, the sister owns the entire property.

But wait, looking at the options, option H says title is in the sister because she paid off the mortgage. But that's not considering the joint tenancy aspect. Another option is B, which says it depends on lien or title theory.

Wait, perhaps because if the jurisdiction is a title theory state, the mortgage would have severed the joint tenancy. No, wait, mortgages don't sever joint tenancy. Severance occurs when one joint tenant transfers their interest. A mortgage is a lien or a conveyance, depending on the theory.

Wait, in title theory states, a mortgage is a conveyance of legal title. So when the sister mortgages her interest, she conveys legal title to the mortgagee. So does that sever the joint tenancy? Because if she conveys her interest, that would terminate the joint tenancy.

Wait, but in joint tenancy, any conveyance by one tenant severs it. So if the sister mortgages her interest, and in title theory that's a conveyance, then the joint tenancy is severed. So the ownership becomes a tenancy in common between the brother, sister, and the mortgagee? Or between the brother and the sister as tenants in common, with the mortgagee holding a lien.

Wait, no, in title theory, the mortgagee holds the legal title to the sister's share. So the joint tenancy would be severed because the sister no longer holds the entire interest. So when the brother dies, the sister and the mortgagee would hold the property as tenants in common? Or maybe the mortgagee holds the sister's share, which would then pass to the mortgagee upon the sister's death.

Wait, this is getting complicated. So in title theory states, the sister's mortgage would convey legal title to the mortgagee, severing the joint tenancy. So the brother and sister would become tenants in common, each owning 50%. When the brother dies, his 50% would go to his estate, which is the cousin. So now the sister owns 50%, the cousin owns 50% through the brother's will.

But wait, the sister later paid off the mortgage, so the mortgagee would re-convey the legal title back to her. So she gets her 50% back, and the cousin has the brother's 50%. So they each own 50% as tenants in common.

In lien theory states, the mortgage is just a lien, so the sister's 50% is subject to the lien, but the joint tenancy isn't severed. So when the brother dies, the sister gets his 50%, becoming the sole owner, with a lien on the property for the mortgage. After paying off the mortgage, she owns 100%.

So the answer would depend on whether the jurisdiction follows lien or title theory. So option B would be correct.

But wait, the question says that the common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute, so perhaps the state's approach to mortgages (lien vs title) affects the outcome.

So in the scenario, the sister's mortgage would determine whether the joint tenancy was severed. If it was (in title theory), then the brother's share goes to the cousin, and the sister has her own 50%, making them tenants in common. But if not (lien theory), the sister owns everything after the brother dies.

So the answer is B: it depends on the jurisdiction's approach to mortgages.

The brother and sister purchased land as joint tenants with right of survivorship, meaning that upon the death of one, the survivor automatically acquires the entire property. The purchase price was $50,000, with the sister contributing $10,000 and the brother $40,000. Despite the unequal contribution, joint tenancy entitles each to an undivided 50% interest in the property.

The sister later mortgaged her interest, and the brother died, leaving his estate to his cousin. In joint tenancy, the brother's interest would normally pass to the sister by survivorship, excluding the cousin from inheriting through the will. However, the sister's mortgage complicates the situation, as the treatment of mortgages varies by jurisdiction.

In **lien theory jurisdictions**, a mortgage is treated as a lien against the property. The sister's mortgage would encumber her 50% interest, but the joint tenancy would remain intact. Upon the brother's death, the sister would acquire his 50% interest through survivorship, becoming the sole owner of the property. The mortgage would then encumber the entire property, but since the sister paid off the mortgage, the lien would be removed, leaving her as the sole owner.

In **title theory jurisdictions**, a mortgage is treated as a conveyance of legal title to the mortgagee. When the sister mortgaged her interest, legal title to her 50% share would pass to the mortgagee, severing the joint tenancy. This would convert the ownership into a tenancy in common, with the sister and brother each owning 50%. Upon the brother's death, his 50% would pass to his cousin through the will. The sister's 50% would remain with her, but subject to the mortgage. After she repaid the mortgage, she would regain full title to her 50%, leaving the sister and cousin as tenants in common, each owning 50% of the property.

Thus, the ownership of the land depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory of mortgages.
