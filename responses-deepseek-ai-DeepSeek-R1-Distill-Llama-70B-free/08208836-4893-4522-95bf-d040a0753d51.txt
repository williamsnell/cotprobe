Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the plastics company's waste cost. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The company has a fixed waste cost of $12 for up to 20 modules. Beyond that, the waste cost increases according to the function $4(p - 20)^2, where p is the number of modules produced beyond 20. So there are two parts to the total cost: the fixed part and the variable part when production exceeds 20.

The question has two parts. First, I need to find the total waste cost when producing 45 modules. Second, determine which number of modules minimizes the waste cost.

Starting with part (i): calculating the total cost for 45 modules. Since 45 is way more than 20, I definitely have to use the variable cost function. 

The fixed cost is $12. Now, the variable part is 4*(p-20)^2. Wait, wait. Wait, p is the modules in excess of 20. So p is 45-20=25 modules over. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the description says p is the modules in excess. So p is 45-20=25, right. So the variable cost would be 4*(25)^2.

Let me compute that. 25 squared is 625. Multiply by 4 gives 2500. So the variable cost is $2,500. Then add the fixed cost of $12, so total is $2,512.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is $2,512 at 20 modules. Hmm, but wait, 45 is more than 20, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check. The fixed cost is $12 for up to 20 modules. Beyond that, it's 4*(p-20)^2. So for 45 modules, p is 45, so (45-20)=25. So 4*(25)^2 is 4*625=2500. So total is 12+2500=2512. So part (i) is $2,512.

Now part (ii): what number of modules minimizes the waste cost. Hmm. So I need to find the value of p that will make the total cost as low as possible.

Wait, the total waste cost is a function of p. Let me model it. Let me denote the total cost as C(p).

For p ≤ 20, C(p) is fixed at $12. So no matter how many modules up to 20, it's $12. Beyond 20, the cost increases with C(p) = 12 + 4*(p-20)^2.

Wait, but if the cost is fixed at 12 for p ≤20, then the minimal cost would be $12, right? Because once you produce more than 20, the cost starts increasing. So producing 20 modules would give the minimal cost of $12. But wait, the options suggest that the minimal cost might be at a higher number of modules, which seems odd. Because if you produce beyond 20, the cost goes up, so the minimal should be at 20.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the fixed cost is $12 for up to 20 modules, and for each module beyond that, the cost is 4*(number beyond 20)^2. So the total cost function is:

C(p) = 12 + 4*(p-20)^2 when p>20.

So, to find the minimum, I should look at the function C(p). The function is flat at 12 for p ≤20, then increases quadratically beyond that. Therefore, the minimum occurs at p=20, because any p higher than that will increase the cost. So the minimal cost is $12 at p=20.

Wait, looking back at the options, part (ii) is the number that minimizes the cost. So the number is 20 modules. So the minimal cost is $12, but in the options, part (i) was 45 modules, which gave us $2,512. So in the options, looking for (i) $2,512 and (ii) p=20.

Looking at the options, option E says $2,512 and 20 modules. So that matches both parts.

Wait, but let's double-check. For part (i): 45 modules. So 45 >20, so variable cost is 4*(45-20)^2=4*25^2=2500. Fixed is 12. Total 2512. So the first part is correct. Second part: the minimum occurs at 20 modules with cost 12. So option E is (i) $2,512 and (ii) 20 modules.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: $2,512 and 20 modules. Yes, that's the one.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the function again. The cost is 12 for p ≤20, and 12 +4*(p-20)^2 for p>20. So the minimum is at p=20, giving 12. But some options have higher module numbers. Maybe the confusion is about whether the minimal occurs at 20 or at a higher number due to some other calculation. But no, because beyond 20 the cost increases, so 20 is the minimal point.

The problem involves calculating the total waste cost for producing 45 modules and determining the number of modules that minimizes the waste cost. The company has a fixed waste cost of $12 for up to 20 modules, and beyond 20 modules, the waste cost increases according to the function \( 4(p-20)^2 \), where \( p \) is the number of modules produced in excess of 20.

### Part (i): Total Waste Cost for 45 Modules
For \( p = 45 \), the fixed cost is $12. The variable cost is calculated as:
\[
4 \times (45 - 20)^2 = 4 \times 25^2 = 4 \times 625 = 2500
\]
Adding the fixed cost, the total waste cost is:
\[
12 + 2500 = 2512
\]
Thus, the total waste cost for producing 45 modules is **$2,512**.

### Part (ii): Number of Modules That Minimizes Waste Cost
The total waste cost function is:
\[
C(p) = 
\begin{cases} 
12 & \text{if } p \leq 20 \\
12 + 4(p-20)^2 & \text{if } p > 20 
\end{cases}
\]
For \( p \leq 20 \), the cost is fixed at $12. For \( p > 20 \), the cost increases quadratically. Therefore, the minimum waste cost occurs at \( p = 20 \), as any production beyond 20 modules increases the cost.

### Final Answer
The total waste cost for producing 45 modules is **$2,512**, and the number of modules that minimizes the waste cost is **20 modules**. Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is:

**E: $2,512 and 20 modules**
