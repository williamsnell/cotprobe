Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. So the question is about finding the period of a mass-spring system undergoing simple harmonic motion. Let me break down the information given.

The mass attached to the spring is 8 grams. Wait, grams are a unit of mass, but in physics, especially in formulas, I might need to convert this into kilograms because the standard unit for mass in SI is kilograms. Oh right, 1 kilogram is 1000 grams, so 8 grams is 0.008 kg.

Next, the spring requires a force of 1000 dynes to extend it 5 cm beyond its natural length. Hmm, I remember Hooke's Law, which states that F equals k times x, where F is the force applied, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. So I can find k here. But wait, the units for force are dynes. I think in SI, force is in Newtons, so I need to convert dynes to Newtons.

I recall that 1 Newton is equal to 10^5 dynes. So 1000 dynes would be 1000 divided by 1e5, which is 0.01 Newtons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 dyne equals 1e-5 Newtons. Because 1 N = 1 kg·m/s², and 1 dyne is g·cm/s². Let me think: 1 kg is 1000 g, 1 m is 100 cm. So 1 dyne is (g * cm/s²) where g is grams. So 1 dyne = (0.001 kg) * (0.01 m) / s² = 0.00001 kg·m/s² = 1e-5 N. So yes, 1000 dynes is 1000 * 1e-5 N = 0.01 N.

The displacement x is 5 cm, which is 0.05 meters.

So using F = kx, I can solve for k. Rearranging, k = F/x. F is 0.01 N, x is 0.05 m. So k = 0.01 / 0.05 = 0.2 N/m. Wait, let me check that calculation. 0.01 divided by 0.05 is indeed 0.2. Yep.

Now, the period of a mass-spring system is given by the formula T equals 2π times the square root of (mass divided by spring constant), T = 2π√(m/k). 

So plugging the numbers in: m is 0.008 kg, k is 0.2 N/m.

Let me compute m/k first. 0.008 divided by 0.2 is 0.04. Then take the square root of 0.04, which is 0.2. Then multiply by 2π: T = 2 * π * 0.2. Let's compute that.

2 * 0.2 is 0.4, so 0.4π. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 0.4 * 3.1416 is about 1.25664 seconds.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one is closest to this value. Let's look through the options:

A: 3.6 sec → No, too big.
B: 2.5 → No.
C: 0.5 → Way too small.
D:1.75 → Close but higher than our value.
E:3.14 → That's pi, which is around 3.14. No.
F: 2.0 → No.
G:0.8 → No.
H:1.26 → Oh, that's very close. 1.256 is approximately 1.26.
I:1.5 → No.
J:2.8 → No.

So the correct answer should be option H:1.26 sec.

To determine the period of the simple harmonic motion for the given mass-spring system, we start by converting the provided units into SI units. The mass is given as 8 grams, which is equivalent to \( m = 0.008 \, \text{kg} \). The force applied to the spring is \( F = 1000 \, \text{dynes} \), and since \( 1 \, \text{dyne} = 10^{-5} \, \text{N} \), this converts to \( F = 0.01 \, \text{N} \). The displacement is \( x = 5 \, \text{cm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \).

Using Hooke's Law, \( F = kx \), we solve for the spring constant \( k \):  
\[
k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.2 \, \text{N/m}.
\]

The period \( T \) of a mass-spring system is given by the formula:  
\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
\]  
Substituting \( m = 0.008 \, \text{kg} \) and \( k = 0.2 \, \text{N/m} \):  
\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.008}{0.2}} = 2\pi \sqrt{0.04}.
\]  
The square root of \( 0.04 \) is \( 0.2 \), so:  
\[
T = 2\pi \cdot 0.2 = 0.4\pi.
\]  
Approximating \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):  
\[
T \approx 0.4 \cdot 3.1416 = 1.25664 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \( 1.25664 \, \text{seconds} \) is \( 1.26 \, \text{seconds} \), which corresponds to option H.
