Okay, so I've got this question about calcium atoms, and I need to figure out the correct statement from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that calcium is a chemical element with a specific atomic number. The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, right? Calcium has an atomic number of 20, which means each calcium atom has 20 protons. Also, in a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. So that would mean 20 electrons as well.

Now, what about neutrons? The number of neutrons can vary, leading to different isotopes of the same element. The most common isotope of calcium is calcium-40, which has 20 neutrons. But wait, does every calcium atom have exactly 20 neutrons? No, because there are other isotopes like calcium-42, which would have 22 neutrons. So not all calcium atoms have 20 neutrons; some have more.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: It contains 20 protons and neutrons. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Does it mean 20 protons and 20 neutrons, making 40 in total? Or does it mean 20 protons and an unspecified number of neutrons? I think it's trying to say 20 each, but that's only for a specific isotope. Since the question isn't specifying an isotope, I can't assume that. So A might not be correct.

Option B: All atoms of calcium have 20 protons and 40 neutrons. Wait, 20 protons is correct for calcium, but 40 neutrons would make a specific isotope (like calcium-60?), but wait, wait. Wait, calcium's atomic number is 20, so the mass number is protons plus neutrons. If it's 20 protons and 40 neutrons, that's a mass number of 60. But I thought the most common isotope is Ca-40 with 20 neutrons. So not all calcium atoms have 40 neutrons. So B is incorrect.

Option C: It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. Wait, that's saying 20 of each. So protons 20, neutrons 20, electrons 20. That would make a calcium atom with 20 protons and 20 neutrons, which is calcium-40. So this is correct for that specific isotope, but the option doesn't specify. The question is about a general calcium atom, so if the question refers to any calcium atom, then the number of neutrons can vary. So C is correct only for a specific case, but the question is general, so maybe not the right choice.

Option D: All calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. So 20 each. That would mean all calcium atoms have 20 protons, 20 neutrons, and 20 electrons. But we know that's not true because there are isotopes with more neutrons. So D is incorrect.

Option E: All atoms of calcium have a mass of 40.078 u. Wait, 40.078 u is the atomic mass of calcium on the periodic table, which is an average of all isotopes. So each individual atom doesn't have that exact mass. For example, a calcium-40 atom would have a mass of around 40 u, and calcium-42 would be around 42 u. So E is incorrect because it's stating that every calcium atom has that exact mass, which isn't true.

Option F: It contains 40 protons and 40 electrons. That can't be right because calcium has 20 protons. 40 protons would make it a different element entirely, maybe something with atomic number 40, which is zirconium. So F is incorrect.

Option G: All calcium atoms have a mass of 20.078 u. No, wait, 20 u would be way too low. The atomic mass is around 40, so this must be a typo. So G is wrong.

Option H: It contains 20 protons and 20 electrons. Yes, that's correct for a neutral calcium atom. The number of electrons equals the protons in a neutral atom. So this is correct, but wait, what about the neutrons? The option doesn't mention them. So the statement is correct because it's only talking about protons and electrons. So H could be correct.

Option I: It contains 20 neutrons and 20 electrons. Well, 20 electrons is correct, but 20 neutrons is only for a specific isotope. So I is only correct for calcium-40, but the question is general. So I is not necessarily correct for all calcium atoms.

Option J: It contains 40 protons and 20 electrons. No, calcium has 20 protons. So J is incorrect.

So now, evaluating the options again. The correct fact is that a calcium atom has 20 protons and 20 electrons. So the correct statement is H: It contains 20 protons and 20 electrons.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question is asking which statement is correct about the calcium atom. So in any calcium atom, regardless of isotope, the number of protons is always 20, and electrons are 20 (if neutral). So H is correct because it doesn't mention neutrons, which can vary.

Looking back, option C says it contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. That would imply 20 each, which is only true for a specific isotope, so C is incorrect for a general calcium atom.

So the correct answer is H.

To determine the correct statement about the calcium atom, let's analyze the options based on known properties of calcium:

1. **Atomic Number and Electrons**: Calcium has an atomic number of 20, meaning it has 20 protons in its nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, so calcium also has 20 electrons.

2. **Neutrons and Isotopes**: The number of neutrons in a calcium atom can vary, leading to different isotopes. For example, calcium-40 has 20 neutrons, while calcium-42 has 22 neutrons. Therefore, not all calcium atoms have the same number of neutrons.

3. **Mass of Atoms**: The atomic mass of calcium (40.078 u) is an average of all its isotopes. Individual calcium atoms do not have this exact mass, as their mass depends on the specific isotope.

Now, evaluating the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While calcium has 20 protons, the number of neutrons varies depending on the isotope, so it does not always have 20 neutrons.
- **B**: Incorrect. Not all calcium atoms have 40 neutrons; this would only apply to a specific isotope like calcium-60.
- **C**: Incorrect. While calcium-40 has 20 protons, 20 neutrons, and 20 electrons, this is only true for that specific isotope, not all calcium atoms.
- **D**: Incorrect. Not all calcium atoms have 20 neutrons, as isotopes vary.
- **E**: Incorrect. The atomic mass of 40.078 u is an average of all isotopes, not the exact mass of every calcium atom.
- **F**: Incorrect. Calcium has 20 protons, not 40, so this is not possible.
- **G**: Incorrect. The mass of 20.078 u is far too low for calcium, as its atomic mass is around 40 u.
- **H**: Correct. Calcium atoms have 20 protons and 20 electrons in their neutral state, regardless of the isotope.
- **I**: Incorrect. While calcium has 20 electrons, the number of neutrons varies depending on the isotope.
- **J**: Incorrect. Calcium has 20 protons, not 40.

The correct answer is **H**, as it accurately states that calcium atoms have 20 protons and 20 electrons, which is true for all isotopes of calcium in their neutral state.

Answer: H
