Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, I have an inductor whose inductance varies with time, and I need to find the voltage across it when a certain current flows through it.

The inductance is given by L(t) = L0 (t + tanh t). Hmm, tanh t is the hyperbolic tangent function, right? So I remember that the derivative of tanh t is sech² t. That might come in handy later.

The current through the inductor is i(t) = cos(ωt). I know that the voltage across an inductor is given by the formula U(t) = d/dt (L(t) * i(t)). Oh wait, wait, actually, the general formula for the voltage across a time-varying inductor is U = L(t) * di/dt + i * dL/dt. Because both L and i can be functions of time.

So I need to compute two terms: the first term is L(t) multiplied by the derivative of the current, and the second term is the current multiplied by the derivative of L(t).

Let me break it down step by step.

First, find di/dt. Since i(t) = cos(ωt), the derivative di/dt would be -ω sin(ωt). So that's the first part.

Next, compute dL/dt. L(t) is L0 (t + tanh t), so the derivative is L0 (1 + sech² t), because the derivative of tanh t is sech² t. Oh wait, wait! Wait, no, the derivative of t is 1, and derivative of tanh t is sech² t. So yeah, dL/dt = L0 (1 + sech² t).

So putting it all together, the voltage U(t) is L(t)*di/dt + i(t)*dL/dt.

Let me compute each part.

First term: L(t) * di/dt = L0 (t + tanh t) * (-ω sin(ωt)).

So that's -ω L0 (t + tanh t) sin(ωt).

Second term: i(t) * dL/dt = cos(ωt) * L0 (1 + sech² t).

So that's L0 (1 + sech² t) cos(ωt).

Wait, but wait. So the voltage U(t) is the sum of these two terms. So,

U(t) = [L0 (1 + sech² t) cos(ωt)] + [-ω L0 (t + tanh t) sin(ωt)].

Hmm, let me rearrange that for clarity:

U(t) = L0 (1 + sech² t) cos(ωt) - ω L0 (t + tanh t) sin(ωt).

Now, let me look at the answer options. Let's see.

Looking at option B: U(t) = L0 (1 + sech² t) cos(ωt) + ω L0 (t + tanh t) sin(ωt). Wait, that's a plus between the two terms. But in my calculation, the second term is negative. So B is not matching.

Option E: U(t) = -L0 (1 + sech² t) sin(ωt) + ω L0 (t + tanh t) cos(ωt). Hmm, no, because the first term here is a sine, and the second term is a cosine. My result has first term cosine, second term sine. So E doesn't match.

Option C: U(t) = L0 (1 + sech² t) cos(ωt) - ω L0 (t + tanh t) sin(ωt). Wait, that's exactly what I have! Let me check the options again.

Option C: Yes, matches. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the signs. The first term in U is positive, and the second term is negative. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, let me go through the options again to make sure.

Option C says: L0 (1 + sech^2 t) cosωt - ω L0 (t + tanht) sinωt. Yes, that's exactly what I derived.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the voltage across the time-varying inductor, we use the formula for the voltage across a time-varying inductor:

\[
U(t) = L(t) \frac{di}{dt} + i(t) \frac{dL}{dt}.
\]

### Given:
- Inductance: \( L(t) = L_0 (t + \tanh t) \)
- Current: \( i(t) = \cos(\omega t) \)

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{di}{dt} \)
The derivative of \( i(t) = \cos(\omega t) \) is:
\[
\frac{di}{dt} = -\omega \sin(\omega t).
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{dL}{dt} \)
The derivative of \( L(t) = L_0 (t + \tanh t) \) is:
\[
\frac{dL}{dt} = L_0 \left( 1 + \text{sech}^2 t \right),
\]
since the derivative of \( \tanh t \) is \( \text{sech}^2 t \).

### Step 3: Substitute into the voltage formula
Substituting \( L(t) \), \( \frac{di}{dt} \), \( i(t) \), and \( \frac{dL}{dt} \) into the formula for \( U(t) \):
\[
U(t) = L_0 (t + \tanh t)(-\omega \sin(\omega t)) + \cos(\omega t)(L_0 (1 + \text{sech}^2 t)).
\]

Simplify:
\[
U(t) = L_0 (1 + \text{sech}^2 t) \cos(\omega t) - \omega L_0 (t + \tanh t) \sin(\omega t).
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option C**:
\[
U(t) = L_0 (1 + \text{sech}^2 t) \cos(\omega t) - \omega L_0 (t + \tanh t) \sin(\omega t).
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
