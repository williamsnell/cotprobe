Okay, so I have this question about antennas and their Q-factor. Hmm, I remember from my studies that Q-factor has something to do with the bandwidth and the cutoff frequency. But wait, what's the exact formula again? Oh right, I think the Q-factor is calculated using the formula Q = fc / BW, where fc is the cutoff frequency and BW is the bandwidth. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, no, the Q-factor is the center frequency divided by the bandwidth, but wait, in this question, it's given as the cutoff frequency. Hmm, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, so the question says the bandwidth is 0.8 MHz and the cutoff frequency is 44 MHz. So if I'm using Q = fc / BW, that would be 44 divided by 0.8. Let me calculate that. 44 divided by 0.8... well, 0.8 times 50 is 40, so 44-40 is 4. 4 divided by 0.8 is 5. So 50 +5=55. So that would give Q=55. But wait, is the formula Q = cutoff frequency divided by bandwidth, or is it the other way around?

Wait, another thought: I think the formula for Q-factor is the resonant frequency divided by the bandwidth. But wait, in this case, is the cutoff frequency the same as the resonant frequency? Or is the cutoff frequency something else? Oh, right, in antennas, the cutoff frequency is the lowest frequency at which the antenna can efficiently radiate. For a resonant antenna, the resonant frequency is where the antenna is at its best, which is in the middle of the bandwidth. Wait, no, the cutoff is the lower end of the operating frequency. So maybe the question is using the cutoff as the center frequency? Or perhaps I'm mixing this up.

Wait, another angle: the Q-factor (quality factor) for a resonant circuit is Q = fo / BW, where fo is the center frequency, and BW is the bandwidth. But in this problem, the given data is cutoff frequency as 44 MHz and bandwidth as 0.8 MHz. So perhaps the cutoff is considered as the resonant frequency here. So then, Q would be 44 / 0.8 =55. So the answer would be option A:55.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the antenna starts to radiate effectively, and the bandwidth is the range around the resonant frequency. If the bandwidth is given as 0.8 MHz and the cutoff is 44, maybe the center frequency is higher than the cutoff. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the cutoff frequency is the same as the resonant frequency. So using that, the calculation is 44 / 0.8 =55.

So looking at the options, option A is 55. That must be the correct answer.

The Q-factor of an antenna can be calculated using the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{f_c}{\text{Bandwidth}}
\]

where \( f_c \) is the cutoff frequency and the bandwidth is the range of frequencies over which the antenna operates efficiently. In this problem, the cutoff frequency is given as 44 MHz, and the bandwidth is 0.8 MHz. Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{44}{0.8} = 55
\]

Thus, the Q-factor of the antenna is 55. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

A: 55
