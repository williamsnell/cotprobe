Okay, so I have this question about the brain at birth, and I need to figure out which part is the least developed. Let me try to think this through step by step.

I remember that when a baby is born, their brain isn't fully developed yet. I think different parts develop at different rates. The question is asking which part is the least developed at birth.

The options are A through J, each a different brain structure. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Visual system. I know that newborns can see, but not very clearly. Their vision improves over time. So the visual system might not be fully developed, but I'm not sure if it's the least.

Option B: Thalamus. The thalamus acts as a relay station for sensory and motor signals. I think it's pretty developed because it's involved in basic functions that a newborn would need, like processing sensory input.

Option C: Frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for executive functions, like planning and decision-making. I remember reading that the frontal lobe develops later in life, during childhood and adolescence. So at birth, it's probably not very developed.

Option D: Brain stem. The brain stem controls vital functions like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. These are essential for survival, so it makes sense that the brain stem is fully developed at birth.

Option E: Parietal lobe. This part handles sensory information related to touch and spatial awareness. I think it's somewhat developed because babies can respond to touch, but maybe not fully.

Option F: Cerebellum. The cerebellum is involved in motor control and coordination. Infants have limited motor skills, so maybe the cerebellum is still developing.

Option G: Cortex. The cortex is the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher brain functions. It's definitely not fully developed at birth, but I'm not sure if it's the least.

Option H: Basal ganglia. They play a role in movement control and learning. I don't recall specific details about their development, but I think they might be functional early on.

Option I: Hypothalamus. This regulates body temperature, hunger, and hormones. It's probably developed since these functions are crucial from birth.

Option J: Limbic system. This includes structures like the hippocampus and amygdala, involved in emotions and memory. I think the limbic system starts developing early, but maybe not fully at birth.

Wait, the question is about the least developed. I remember that the frontal lobe, which handles higher-order thinking, is one of the last parts to mature. So at birth, it's the least developed. That would point to option C.

Alternatively, the cortex (option G) is also not fully developed, but I think the frontal lobe is a specific part of the cortex. So maybe the question is referring to the frontal lobe.

Yeah, I think the answer is C: frontal lobe.

The least developed part of the brain at birth is the frontal lobe. This area is responsible for executive functions such as planning and decision-making, which develop later in life during childhood and adolescence. In contrast, other brain regions like the brain stem and thalamus are more developed at birth to handle essential functions necessary for survival. 

Answer: C
