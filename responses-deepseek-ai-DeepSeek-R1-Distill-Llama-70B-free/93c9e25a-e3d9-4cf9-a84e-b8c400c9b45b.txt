Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Two men held-up a liquor store in a city. During the robbery, one of the participants shot and killed the owner of the store. Over a year later, police detectives arrested a defendant after obtaining reliable information that the defendant was the robber who was responsible for killing the store's owner. Afterward, the defendant was taken to the station house where he was booked for the crime and then incarcerated. The next day, the prosecuting attorney made a decision to delay indictment until he could discover the identity of the defendant's accomplice. The defendant was then released from police custody. In this jurisdiction the statute of limitations for murder is five years. Five months later, the prosecuting attorney, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure information on the defendant's cohort, indicted the defendant, charging him with felony murder. Shortly before trial, the only eyewitness to the crime died. He would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because of the delay between the date of the crime and the date of the indictment will most probably be

Options:

A: denied, because the delay did not infringe upon the defendant's rights.
B: granted, because the delay in prosecuting the defendant actually prejudiced him.
C: granted, because the defendant was not given the opportunity to confront his accuser.
D: denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations.
E: denied, because the delay was not excessive and was for a permissible purpose.
F: granted, because the only eyewitness to the crime died before the trial.
G: denied, because the defendant was eventually charged within the statute of limitations.
H: denied, because the prosecutor had a valid reason to delay the indictment.
I: granted, because the prosecutor failed to find the defendant's accomplice.
J: granted, because the prosecutor is constitutionally required to press charges, if at all, within a reasonable time after probable cause is established.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with pre-indictment delay and the statute of limitations. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. Two men robbed a liquor store, and one shot and killed the owner. A year later, the defendant was arrested based on reliable info that he was the robber responsible. He was booked, then released. The prosecutor delayed indictment to find the accomplice's identity. Five months later, they indicted him for felony murder after failing to find the accomplice. Then, the only eyewitness died before trial, and he would have said the defendant didn't participate. The defendant is moving to dismiss because of the delay.

So the issue is whether the delay between the crime and indictment violates the defendant's rights, leading to dismissal.

I remember that the statute of limitations is about the time limit for bringing charges. Here, the statute for murder is five years. The delay was five months, so well within the five-year limit. But the defendant is arguing that the delay itself caused prejudice.

Wait, I think the Constitution, specifically the Due Process Clause, protects against pre-indictment delays that cause actual prejudice to the defendant. So even if the delay is within the statute of limitations, if it causes prejudice, it might be a problem.

In this case, the key points are:

1. The delay was five months after the initial arrest and release.
2. The eyewitness died, and he would have testified that the defendant didn't participate.
3. The prosecutor's reason for delay was to find the accomplice, which could be a valid reason, but I'm not sure if that's a factor here.

I recall that in United States v. Lovasco, the Supreme Court said that pre-indictment delay doesn't violate the Due Process Clause unless there's actual prejudice. So the defendant needs to show that the delay caused them some harm.

Here, the eyewitness's death seems like clear prejudice. Without that witness, the defendant loses an alibi or someone who could say he wasn't involved. That could undermine his defense.

So, the defendant can argue that the delay caused him prejudice, so the indictment should be dismissed. But wait, does the reason for the delay matter? The prosecutor was trying to find the accomplice. But the key is whether the defendant was prejudiced, not necessarily the reasonableness of the prosecutor's actions.

So looking at the options:

Option B says granted because the delay actually prejudiced him. That seems to fit because the eyewitness died.

Option D says denied because pre-indictment delay doesn't violate the Constitution as long as it's within the statute. But that's not entirely accurate because even within the statute, if there's prejudice, it can be a problem.

Option E says denied because the delay wasn't excessive and for a permissible purpose. But the permissible purpose might not matter if there's prejudice.

Option F says granted because the eyewitness died. But I think the reasoning is more about the prejudice caused, not just the fact that the witness died. So B is better.

Option G says denied because within statute of limitations. But again, that's not the whole story.

Option H says denied because the prosecutor had a valid reason. But the reason doesn't negate the prejudice.

So I think the correct answer is B, because the delay caused actual prejudice by the loss of the eyewitness's testimony. So the motion to dismiss would be granted.

The question revolves around whether a pre-indictment delay violated the defendant's rights, particularly under the Due Process Clause. The key issue is whether the delay caused actual prejudice to the defendant. Here, the delay resulted in the death of the only eyewitness, who would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. This constitutes clear prejudice, as the loss of this testimony undermines the defendant's ability to defend himself.

Under the Due Process Clause, pre-indictment delay does not automatically violate constitutional rights unless it causes actual prejudice. The fact that the delay was within the statute of limitations is not dispositive, as the focus is on whether the delay harmed the defendant. The prosecutor's reason for the delay (to identify the accomplice) does not negate the prejudice caused by the loss of the eyewitness.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly identifies that the delay prejudiced the defendant by depriving him of critical testimony.
- Other options either focus on the statute of limitations (D, G), the reasonableness of the delay (E, H), or misstate the legal standard (F, J).

Thus, the motion to dismiss is most likely granted because the delay caused actual prejudice to the defendant.

Answer: B
