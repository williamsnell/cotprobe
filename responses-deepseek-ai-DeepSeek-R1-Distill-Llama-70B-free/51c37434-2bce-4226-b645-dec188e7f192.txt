Okay, so I need to figure out Pauline Key's gross earnings for last week. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, I know that Pauline earns $3.50 per hour. But she gets paid differently depending on when she works. So, I should separate her earnings into regular hours, overtime, and Sunday pay.

She worked a total of 48 hours during the regular week and 4.5 hours on Sunday. Wait, the regular workweek is 40 hours, right? So, the 48 hours she worked during the week must include some overtime.

Let me calculate the regular pay first. For the first 40 hours, she gets her regular rate. So, 40 hours times $3.50 per hour. 40 * 3.50 is $140.00. Got that part.

Now, the remaining hours beyond 40 are considered overtime. She worked 48 hours total in the week, so 48 - 40 = 8 hours of overtime. Overtime is paid at time and a half. Time and a half means one and a half times her regular pay. So, her overtime rate is 3.50 * 1.5. Let me compute that: 3.50 * 1.5 is $5.25 per hour. 

So, for 8 hours of overtime, she earns 8 * 5.25. Let's see, 8 times 5 is 40, and 8 times 0.25 is 2, so total is $42.00. 

Now, onto the Sunday pay. She worked 4.5 hours on Sunday. The problem states she's paid double her regular rate for Sunday work. Double of $3.50 is 7.00 dollars per hour. So, 4.5 hours * $7.00. Hmm, 4 hours would be 28.00, and half an hour is 3.50, so total is 31.50. 

Wait, let me double-check that Sunday calculation. 4.5 hours at $7 per hour: 4 *7=28, plus 0.5*7=3.5, so yes, 31.50.

Now, adding all three parts together. The regular pay is $140.00, overtime is $42.00, and Sunday pay is $31.50. So total is 140 +42 = 182, plus 31.50 is 213.50.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Are the Sunday hours part of the regular 40 or separate? Oh right, the Sunday is separate from the weekly hours. So she worked 48 regular week hours (with 8 overtime) and 4.5 Sunday hours. So yes, the three components are correct.

Looking at the options, option F is $213.50. So that should be the correct answer.

To calculate Pauline Key's gross earnings for the week, we break down her pay into three components: regular pay, overtime pay, and Sunday pay.

1. **Regular Pay**:  
   Pauline earns $3.50 per hour for the first 40 hours of work.  
   Regular pay = 40 hours × $3.50/hour = $140.00.

2. **Overtime Pay**:  
   She worked 8 hours beyond the 40-hour threshold (48 total hours - 40 regular hours = 8 overtime hours). Overtime is paid at time and a half, which is 1.5 × $3.50 = $5.25 per hour.  
   Overtime pay = 8 hours × $5.25/hour = $42.00.

3. **Sunday Pay**:  
   Pauline worked 4.5 hours on Sunday, for which she is paid double her regular rate (2 × $3.50 = $7.00 per hour).  
   Sunday pay = 4.5 hours × $7.00/hour = $31.50.

Adding all components together:  
Total earnings = $140.00 (regular) + $42.00 (overtime) + $31.50 (Sunday) = $213.50.

The correct answer is **F: $213.50**.
