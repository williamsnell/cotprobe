Question:

Congress enacts a statute that makes Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street. Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?

Options:

A: It is invalid because it conflicts with the ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., City Council.
B: It is valid as it is within the purview of Congress's power over transportation.
C: It is invalid because the law infringes upon the rights of the residents of Washington, D.C.
D: It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.
E: It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.
F: It is invalid because it violates the Tenth Amendment.
G: It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.
H: It is valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.
I: It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.
J: It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this constitutional law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that Congress enacted a statute making Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street. The reason they did this was to help members of Congress avoid heavy traffic when traveling to the Capital. Before this, the Washington D.C. City Council had passed an ordinance making Pennsylvania Avenue a two-lane street. So now, the federal law and the local ordinance are in conflict. The question is asking which statement about the constitutionality of the federal statute is correct.

First, I need to think about the powers of Congress and the relationship with the District of Columbia. I remember that Washington D.C. is a federal district, not a state, and Congress has exclusive authority over it under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17. That clause says Congress has the power to exercise exclusive legislation over the District. So that means Congress can make laws for D.C., right?

In this case, the City Council passed an ordinance, but Congress later passed a statute that conflicts with it. Since Congress has exclusive authority, their statute should take precedence. So the federal law would override the local ordinance.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's invalid because it conflicts with the D.C. ordinance. But if Congress has exclusive power, their law is valid, so A is probably wrong.

Option B says it's valid under Congress's transportation power. I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. The key point is the authority over D.C., not transportation powers specifically.

Option C claims it's invalid because it infringes on residents' rights. But the question doesn't mention any specific rights being violated, more about the power struggle between Congress and the City Council.

Option D says it's invalid due to burdening interstate commerce. There's nothing in the question indicating it affects interstate commerce, so D might not apply.

Option E talks about Congress's enumerated property power. I'm not sure if that's the right basis here. The issue is more about legislative jurisdiction over D.C., not property ownership.

Option F says it's invalid because of the Tenth Amendment. But the Tenth applies to states, not D.C., since D.C. isn't a state. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G states it's valid because Congress has exclusive power over D.C. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier, so G seems correct.

Option H mentions interstate commerce power. Again, the question doesn't tie this to commerce, so H might not be the right reason.

Option I claims the City Council has exclusive power. But that contradicts the exclusive authority of Congress, so I is wrong.

Option J says it's valid because of a governmental interest. Well, the law was made for a governmental purpose (helping Congress members), but the main constitutional issue is Congress's authority, not the purpose's validity.

So the correct answer should be G: It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a federal statute enacted by Congress designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a one-way street, which conflicts with a prior ordinance by the Washington, D.C., City Council. The key issue is whether Congress has the authority to override local ordinances in the District of Columbia.

Under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has exclusive legislative authority over the District of Columbia. This means Congress can enact laws that supersede local ordinances, even if they conflict. The statute in question was enacted to facilitate congressional operations, which is a valid governmental purpose. While other options address potential issues like transportation power, interstate commerce, or residents' rights, the primary constitutional basis for the statute's validity is Congress's exclusive authority over the District of Columbia.

Option G correctly identifies this principle, making it the most accurate answer.

Answer: G
