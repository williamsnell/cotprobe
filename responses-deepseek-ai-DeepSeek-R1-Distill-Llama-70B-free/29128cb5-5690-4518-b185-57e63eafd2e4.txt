Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A bacterial culture is divided into two halves, A and B, and bothhalves receive large but equal amounts of ultraviolet light. Culture B is then wrapped in brown paper to isolate it fromany light. Culture A is left unprotected from the incident visiblelight. After 24 hours the cultures are examined. Culture A shows much more growth than culture B. Explain.

Options:

A: Culture B was wrapped in brown paper, hampering its growth.
B: Culture A benefited from additional warmth provided by the incident visible light, promoting growth.
C: Culture A's cellular metabolism was enhanced by the visible light, leading to faster reproduction and growth compared to Culture B.
D: Culture B's lack of light triggered a dormancy state, while Culture A continued to grow due to its active state.
E: Culture B's growth was inhibited by the brown paper itself, which contained chemicals toxic to the bacteria.
F: Culture A produced more protective pigments in response to the visible light, which helped it grow more than Culture B.
G: Culture B's excision repair system was more efficient than Culture A's photoreactivation system.
H: Culture B consumed nutrients more quickly in the absence of light, leading to nutrient depletion and reduced growth.
I: Culture A's photoreactivation system was allowed to work because of its exposure to light. Culture B, because it was left in the dark, had to rely on its excision repair system alone, which may have been damaged by the UV light, making it inoperative.
J: Culture A grew more due to the exposure to visible light.

Okay, so I need to figure out this bacterial culture question. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

So, there's a bacterial culture split into two, A and B. Both get a lot of UV light. Then, B is wrapped in brown paper to block light, while A is left open. After 24 hours, A has much more growth than B. I need to explain why.

UV light is known to cause DNA damage, right? Like, it creates thymine dimers which distort the DNA structure. So, the bacteria can't replicate properly unless they repair that damage.

Wait, bacteria have ways to repair DNA damage. I remember two main mechanisms: excision repair and photoreactivation. Excision repair is a dark repair mechanism, meaning it doesn't require light. It's a slower process where enzymes cut out the damaged section and repair it.

Photoreactivation, on the other hand, uses an enzyme called photolyase which is activated by visible light, especially blue light. This enzyme can break the thymine dimers without cutting the DNA strand, which is a quicker repair method.

So, both cultures A and B received UV light, which damaged their DNA. Then, culture B is in the dark, so it can only use excision repair. Culture A is exposed to visible light, so it can use photoreactivation.

Why does A have more growth? Because photoreactivation is faster. So the bacteria in A can repair the damage more quickly, resume replication, and thus grow better than B.

Looking at the options now:

Option I says that A could use photoreactivation because of the light, while B had to rely on excision repair, which might have been damaged. Wait, but excision repair doesn't require light. If UV damaged the excision repair system, then B couldn't repair. But if both got the same UV, maybe their repair systems are both damaged. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again. Both cultures get UV. So their DNA is damaged. Culture A is in light, so photoreactivation can fix the damage. Culture B is in dark, so only excision repair is possible.

But if the UV was so strong that it overwhelmed both repair systems, then maybe A recovers faster because photoreactivation is a quicker repair. So, more bacteria survive in A, leading to more growth.

Looking at the options:

Option I: Culture A uses photoreactivation because of light. Culture B uses excision repair, which may have been damaged. But I think both A and B would have their repair systems affected by UV. But no, excision repair doesn't require light, so maybe it's not dependent on light exposure.

Wait, no, the UV exposure would affect the DNA but not directly the repair enzymes. Unless the UV is so intense that it damages the proteins (enzymes), but I think the question assumes that both have the same initial damage.

So the difference is that A can use photoreactivation (faster) because it's in light, while B can't and must rely on slower excision repair. So A grows more.

Looking at the options:

Option I says that A used photoreactivation, B used excision. And if excision was damaged by UV, then B can't repair. But I thought excision repair doesn't require light, and UV doesn't necessarily damage the repair enzymes.

Wait, maybe UV does inactivate the repair enzymes? Or perhaps the photoreactivation is more efficient, so A recovers better.

So, the correct explanation is that A could repair the UV damage faster because it had light for photoreactivation, while B had to do it slowly in the dark, leading to less growth.

Looking at the options again:

Option I: "Culture A's photoreactivation system was allowed to work because of its exposure to light. Culture B, because it was left in the dark, had to rely on its excision repair system alone, which may have been damaged by the UV light, making it inoperative."

Wait, so if the excision repair system in B was also damaged, then B couldn't repair at all. But I'm not sure if UV affects the repair systems themselves. Maybe the UV primarily damages DNA, not the proteins. So B's excision repair is functional, just slower than A's photoreactivation.

In that case, option I's second part might be incorrect because it assumes excision repair was damaged, which may not be the case. So perhaps the better answer is that A could repair faster because it used photoreactivation, while B used the slower excision repair, leading to less growth.

Looking for an option that says that. Option I is the only one that talks about photoreactivation and excision repair. Or, perhaps another option.

Wait, looking at option G: Culture B's excision repair was more efficient than A's photoreactivation. That would be the opposite of the correct situation.

Hmm, perhaps no. So the correct answer is option I, because it's the only one that mentions the repair systems. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. Both cultures received UV, so their DNA is damaged. Without repair, they can't grow. A is exposed to light, so photoreactivation can repair the DNA quickly. B is in the dark, so it can only do excision repair, which is slower. So A can resume growth sooner, leading to more growth after 24 hours.

So the reason is the repair mechanisms. So the correct answer should mention photoreactivation for A and excision repair for B.

Looking at the options again, option I is the only one that does that. So I think the answer is I.

The bacterial culture was divided into two halves, A and B, both exposed to large amounts of UV light, which damaged their DNA by creating thymine dimers. Culture A was left in visible light, while Culture B was wrapped in brown paper to block light. After 24 hours, Culture A showed significantly more growth than Culture B.

The key explanation lies in the DNA repair mechanisms of bacteria. UV light damages DNA, but bacteria can repair this damage through two main pathways: excision repair and photoreactivation. Excision repair is a slow, light-independent process where enzymes remove and repair damaged DNA sections. Photoreactivation, on the other hand, is a faster process that requires visible light and uses the enzyme photolyase to directly repair thymine dimers.

Culture A, exposed to visible light, could utilize photoreactivation, allowing it to repair DNA damage quickly and resume growth. Culture B, in the dark, could only rely on the slower excision repair mechanism, leading to delayed growth. This difference in repair efficiency explains why Culture A grew more than Culture B.

Option I correctly identifies that Culture A's photoreactivation system was functional due to light exposure, while Culture B had to rely on excision repair alone, which may have been less efficient or even inoperative due to UV-induced damage.
