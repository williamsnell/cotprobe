Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about what "new racism" refers to. Hmm, I remember the term "new racism" from some sociology or maybe cultural studies I did a while back. Let me think through this.

The question gives options from A to J. Let's go through each option one by one, but maybe I can recall the concept first.

From what I remember, "new racism" is a term used to describe a more subtle form of racism that's different from the overt, old-fashioned racism. It's more about cultural differences and nationalism rather than biological superiority. So it's not as obvious but still contributes to exclusion and discrimination.

Looking at the options:

Option A: a subtler form of prejudice, masked by nationalist pride. That sounds familiar. I think new racism often hides behind nationalism, emphasizing cultural incompatibility rather than racial inferiority.

Option B: a trend of neo-nazism masked as patriotism. Neo-nazism is more extreme and I think it's a different concept. New racism isn't necessarily tied to neo-nazism.

Option C: exists only on social media. No, that doesn't seem right. New racism isn't limited to social media; it's a broader societal issue.

Option D: an anti-fascist movement. No, that's the opposite. Anti-fascists are against racism, not a type of racism.

Option E: increased awareness. No, that's more about anti-racism efforts, not the racism itself.

Option F: post-modern deconstruction. That's more about scholarly analysis, not the practice of racism.

Option G: radical form encouraging open discrimination. That sounds more like old racism, which is more overt.

Option H: practiced by newly established countries. I don't think it's about new countries, but about new forms of racism in existing societies.

Option I: in new areas like cyberspace. While racism does exist online, I don't think new racism is limited to that.

Option J: rise in new political parties. Some new parties might use new racism, but the term refers to the type of racism, not just the political parties.

So putting it all together, the best fit seems to be Option A. New racism is a subtler form masked by nationalist pride, focusing on cultural differences rather than biological race. It's more about saying "our culture is better" than overtly racist slurs.

The 'new racism' refers to a subtler form of prejudice, masked by nationalist pride. This form of racism emphasizes cultural differences and is less overt than traditional racism, often manifesting through notions of cultural superiority or incompatibility rather than explicit biological or racial hierarchies.

Answer: A
