Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates and the rate equation. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says the reaction is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O. Wait, but the rate equation given is rate = k [H₂]² [H₂O]. Oh right, the rate equation tells us how the rate depends on the concentrations of the reactants.

So the overall order of the reaction is the sum of the exponents in the rate equation. Let me break it down. The rate equation is rate = k [H₂] squared multiplied by [H₂O]. So the exponents are 2 for H₂ and 1 for H₂O. Adding them together gives 2 + 1 = 3. So the overall order should be third order.

Wait, but wait—what about O₂? Oh, because O₂ isn't in the rate equation, its exponent is zero. So yeah, only H₂ and H₂O are contributing. Adding 2 and 1 makes three. So the overall order is third order.

Looking at the options, option B is third order overall. So the answer should be B.

The rate equation provided is **rate = k [H₂]² [H₂O]**. The overall order of a reaction is determined by summing the exponents of the concentration terms in the rate equation. Here, the exponent for [H₂] is 2, and the exponent for [H₂O] is 1. Adding these together gives **2 + 1 = 3**, so the overall order of the reaction is **third order**.

Option B corresponds to third order overall.

Answer: B
