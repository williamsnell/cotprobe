Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electroplating a spoon with silver. Hmm, I remember that electroplating involves using electricity to deposit a metal onto another object. The question is asking how much silver is deposited when the spoon is plated for 20 minutes at 0.50 amperes.

Wait, I think I need to use Faraday's laws of electrolysis here. Oh right, Faraday's first law says that the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the amount of electricity that passes through the solution. The formula I remember is m = (I * t * M) / (n * F), where m is the mass, I is current, t is time, M is molar mass, n is the valence number, and F is Faraday's constant.

So, let's break it down. The current I is 0.50 amperes. Time is 20 minutes, but wait, I think I need to convert that into seconds because Faraday's constant is in coulombs per mole. Oh right, 1 minute is 60 seconds, so 20 minutes is 20 * 60 = 1200 seconds.

Silver's molar mass M, I think, is about 108 grams per mole. What about the valence number n? Silver usually has a +1 charge when it's deposited, so n is 1. Faraday's constant F is approximately 96485 coulombs per mole.

Plugging in the numbers: m = (0.50 A * 1200 s * 108 g/mol) / (1 * 96485 C/mol). Let me calculate that step by step. 

First, 0.50 times 1200 is 600. Then, 600 multiplied by 108 is 64,800. Now, divide that by 96485. Let me see, 64,800 divided by 96,485 is approximately 0.671 grams. 

Wait, looking at the options, option J is 0.671 gm. So that must be the correct answer.

To determine the amount of silver deposited on the spoon, we use Faraday's first law of electrolysis:

\[
m = \frac{I \cdot t \cdot M}{n \cdot F}
\]

Where:
- \( I = 0.50 \, \text{A} \) (current),
- \( t = 20 \, \text{minutes} = 1200 \, \text{seconds} \),
- \( M = 108 \, \text{g/mol} \) (molar mass of silver),
- \( n = 1 \) (valence number of silver),
- \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \) (Faraday's constant).

Substituting the values:

\[
m = \frac{0.50 \cdot 1200 \cdot 108}{1 \cdot 96485}
\]

First, calculate \( 0.50 \cdot 1200 = 600 \). Then, \( 600 \cdot 108 = 64800 \). Finally, divide \( 64800 \) by \( 96485 \), yielding approximately \( 0.671 \, \text{g} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 0.671 gm**.
