Okay, so I have this math problem here: 32 multiplied by 67. Hmm, I need to find the product of these two numbers. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on my multiplication, but I think I can figure this out.

First, I remember that multiplying two numbers can be broken down into simpler steps. Maybe I can use the distributive property. So, 32 times 67... Well, 67 is 60 plus 7, right? So I can split the multiplication into two parts: 32 times 60 and 32 times 7, and then add the results together.

Wait, let me write that down. 32 * 60 is like 32*6 and then adding a zero at the end. 32 times 6 is... let's see, 30*6 is 180 and 2*6 is 12, so 180+12 is 192. Adding a zero makes it 1920. Okay, that's the first part.

Now, the second part is 32 * 7. Let me calculate that. 30*7 is 210, and 2*7 is 14. So 210 +14 is 224. So now I have 1920 and 224.

Adding them together: 1920 + 224. Let's do that step by step. 1920 plus 200 is 2120. Then, adding the remaining 24 gives me 2144. So the total is 2144.

Wait, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I'll try another method to verify. Another way to multiply is to use the standard algorithm.

So, 32 times 67. Let's write it out:

    32
  x 67
  ----
    224  (which is 32 *7)
  1920   (which is 32*60, shifted one position to the left)
  ----
  2144

Yep, that matches what I got earlier. So I think the product is 2144.

Looking at the options, option G is 2,144. So that should be the correct answer.

The product of 32 and 67 is calculated by breaking it down into 32 × 60 and 32 × 7. 

- 32 × 60 = 1920  
- 32 × 7 = 224  

Adding these together: 1920 + 224 = 2144.  

The correct answer is **G: 2,144**.
