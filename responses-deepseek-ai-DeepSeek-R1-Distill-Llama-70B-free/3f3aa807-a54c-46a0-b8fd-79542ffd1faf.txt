Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the temperature at which there are Avogadro's number of translational states available for O₂ confined to a volume of 1000 cm³. The options are from A to J, with various temperatures in Kelvin.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about translational energy levels and quantum states. Oh right, it relates to the partition function for translational motion. The partition function gives the number of available states, right?

Wait, the translational partition function, q, is given by something like q = (V / λ³) * something else, where λ is the thermal wavelength. Oh yeah, the formula is q = (V)(sqrt(2πmkT))³ / h³. Because the translational partition function for a particle in 3D is (V(2πmkT)^(3/2))^(1/2) divided by h cubed, or something like that. Let me get the exact formula right.

So the formula for the translational partition function is q = (V)(2πmkT)^(3/2)^(1/2) / h³? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of units. Thermal wavelength λ is h / sqrt(2πmkT), right? So λ³ would be h³ / (2πmkT)^(3/2). Then q is V divided by λ³, so that gives q = V*(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³.

But wait, I think the exact expression is q = (V)(sqrt(2πmkT))^3 / h^3. Because for each direction in 3D, the partition function is sqrt(2πmkT)*L / h, where L is the length in each dimension, so for 3D it's cubed.

So putting it all together, the translational partition function for one molecule would be q = (V)(2πmkT)^(3/2)^(1/2) ? Wait, no, let me think again. The formula should be q = (V (2 π m k T)^(3/2)) )^(1/ h³). Or maybe it's (sqrt(2 π m k T))³ * V / h³.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Oh wait, in an exam setting I can't do that. Let me try to write it correctly.

The translational partition function is given by q_trans = (V)(2πmkT/h²)^(3/2). Because the formula is q = (V)(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³. Yes, that's correct. So q = V*(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³.

But wait, the question is about the number of translational states available being equal to Avogadro's number, N_A. So for one mole of gas, the number of translational states per molecule would be q, and when you have N_A molecules, the total number of states is q^N, but wait, no, because each molecule is indistinct, so it's q divided by N! or something? No, wait, no. The partition function for the system is q^N / N! for indistinguishable particles. But the question is about the number of translational states. So perhaps when the partition function q equals N_A, that means that each molecule has N_A available states. Or wait, maybe the number of available translational states for the entire system is Avogadro's number.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem says "there are Avogadro's number of translational states available for O₂". So maybe it's saying that for one mole of O₂, the number of translational states is N_A. Or perhaps it's per molecule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the translational partition function per molecule equals N_A. Because if each molecule has N_A states available, then for a mole, you have N_A times that, but that might complicate things. Hmm.

Wait, the question says Avogadro's number of translational states available. So that would mean that the partition function q is equal to N_A. Because the partition function represents the number of available states per molecule. Or wait, no. The partition function itself is a sum over states, so if q is the number of states per molecule, then for N molecules, the total number would be q^N divided by N! (for indistiguishability), but that's for the entire system's partition function.

But the question is about the number of translational states available being Avogadro's number. So perhaps q equals N_A. So set q = N_A and solve for T.

So q = V*(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³ = N_A.

Let me write that equation:

V*(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³ = N_A.

We can solve for T here.

But wait, let me make sure about the constants. Let me get all the values right.

What's the mass of an O₂ molecule? The molar mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol, so the molecular mass m is (32 g/mol) / (N_A) → but wait, in kg. So 32 grams is 0.032 kg. So m = 0.032 kg/mol / Avogadro's number.

Wait, m is the mass of a single molecule. So m = (0.032 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 mol⁻¹) ) → 5.313e-26 kg.

Wait, let's compute that: 0.032 kg/mol divided by Avogadro's number (≈6.022e23 /mol) → 0.032 / 6.022e23 = approximately 5.315e-26 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, V is 1000 cm³, which is 1000 mL → 1 liter = 0.001 m³. So V = 0.001 m³.

Now, the constants: Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.381e-23 J/K.

So putting all together, let's write the equation:

V (2 π m k T )^(3/2) / h³ = N_A.

We need to solve for T.

Let me rearrange the equation to solve for T.

First, multiply both sides by h³:

V (2 π m k T )^(3/2) = N_A h³.

Then, divide both sides by V:

(2 π m k T )^(3/2) = (N_A h³) / V.

Raise both sides to the power 2/3 to get:

2 π m k T = [ (N_A h³) / V ]^(2/3).

Then, solve for T:

T = [ (N_A h³ / V )^(2/3) ] / (2 π m k ).

Wait, let's write it step by step.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the numerator (N_A h^3):

N_A = 6.022e23 mol⁻¹,

h = 6.626e-34 J·s,

so h^3 = (6.626e-34)^3 ≈ (6.626)^3 * 1e-102 → 6.626^3 is about 290. So 290e-102 → 2.9e-100.

Wait, wait, let me compute it accurately.

6.626e-34 cubed is (6.626)^3 * 1e-102.

6.626^3: 6.626 * 6.626 = approx 43.9, then 43.9 * 6.626 ≈ 290. So 6.626^3 ≈ 290, so h³ ≈ 290e-102 J³·s³.

Then N_A * h³ = 6.022e23 * 290e-102 → Let's compute that.

6.022e23 * 290e-102 = 6.022 * 290 * 1e(23-102) = 6.022*290 * 1e-79.

6.022 * 290 → 6 * 290 is 1740, 0.022 *290 ≈6.38 → total ~1746.38.

So N_A h³ ≈ 1746.38e-79 = 1.74638e-76.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the exponent.

6.022e23 * 290e-102 → 6.022e23 * 2.9e-100 (since 290e-102=2.9e-100) → 6.022 *2.9 = approx 17.464 → 17.464e(23-100) = 17.464e-77 → 1.7464e-76.

Wait, that seems more accurate. 6.022e23 * 2.9e-100 = (6.022 * 2.9) * 1e23 * 1e-100 → 17.464 * 1e-77 → so 1.7464e-76.

So N_A h³ ≈ 1.7464e-76.

Now, V is 0.001 m³. So N_A h³ / V = 1.7464e-76 / 0.001 → 1.7464e-73.

So (N_A h³ / V ) = 1.7464e-73.

Now, take that to the power of (2/3):

(1.7464e-73)^(2/3) → Let me compute that.

First, compute the cube root of 1.7464e-73: (1.7464e-73)^(1/3) → cube root of 1.7464 is about 1.2 (since 1.2^3=1.728), and cube root of 1e-73 is 1e-24.333. So 1.2e-24.333.

Then, square that: (1.2e-24.333)^2 = (1.44) * 1e-48.666 → 1.44e-48.666.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the exponent as (1.7464e-73)^(2/3) = (1.7464)^(2/3) * (1e-73)^(2/3).

(1e-73)^(2/3) = 1e^(-73*(2/3)) = 1e^(-48.666...) )= 1e-48.666.

(1.7464)^(2/3): Let me compute ln(1.7464) → approx 0.557. Multiply by 2/3: 0.371. So exponentiate: e^0.371 ≈ 1.45.

So (N_A h³ / V )^(2/3) ≈ 1.45e-48.666.

But wait, 48.666 is 48 and 2/3, which is 48.6667. So 1.45e-48.6667 is the same as approx 1.45e-48.6667.

Now, the denominator is 2 π m k.

Compute 2 π m k:

m is 5.313e-26 kg,

k is 1.381e-23 J/K.

So 2 π m k = 2 * 3.1416 * 5.313e-26 kg * 1.381e-23 J/K.

Compute the numbers:

2 * 3.1416 ≈6.2832.

5.313e-26 * 1.381e-23 → 5.313 *1.381 ≈7.34, and exponents 1e-26 *1e-23 = 1e-49. So 7.34e-49.

Multiply by 6.2832: 6.2832 *7.34e-49 ≈ 4.61e-48.

So denominator is 4.61e-48 kg·J/(K) (Wait, no, units: 2 π m k has units kg·m²/(s²·K) ? Wait, no. Let me think. Boltzmann's constant k has units J/K, which is (kg·m²/s²)/K. So 2 π m k has units kg * (kg·m²/(s²·K)) → kg²·m²/(s²·K). Hmm, but perhaps the units don't matter right now.

So putting it all together, T = [ (N_A h³ / V )^(2/3) ] / (2 π m k )

Which is 1.45e-48.6667 / 4.61e-48 → Let me compute this.

Wait, 1.45e-48.6667 is the same as 1.45 * 1e-48.6667. 48.6667 is 48 + 2/3, which is 48.6667 ≈ 48.6667.

So 1e-48.6667 is 1e-48 * 1e-0.6667 → 1e-48 * ~0.214 → 2.14e-49.

So 1.45e-48.6667 ≈ 1.45 * 2.14e-49 → approx 3.10e-49.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the exponents. Let me think again. Let me write 1.45e-48.6667 as 1.45 * 10^(-48.6667). To compute this, I can write it as 1.45 * 10^(-48) * 10^(-0.6667). 10^(-0.6667) is about 0.214, so 1.45 * 0.214 = approx 0.310, so 0.310e-48 → 3.10e-49.

So numerator is 3.10e-49.

Denominator is 4.61e-48.

So T = 3.10e-49 / 4.61e-48 = (3.10 /4.61 ) * 1e(-49+48) → 0.672 * 1e-1 → 0.0672 K.

So approximately 0.067 K. Looking at the options, E is 0.068 K, which is very close. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.

First, compute m for O₂: Molar mass is 32 g/mol → 0.032 kg/mol. So m = 0.032 / 6.022e23 → 5.315e-26 kg. That's correct.

V is 1000 cm³ → 0.001 m³.

h is 6.626e-34, k is 1.381e-23.

Compute (N_A h³) / V:

N_A h³ = 6.022e23 * (6.626e-34)^3.

Compute (6.626e-34)^3: 6.626^3 ≈ 290, so 290e-102 → 2.9e-100.

6.022e23 * 2.9e-100 = 1.746e-76.

Divide by V=0.001 → 1.746e-76 /0.001 = 1.746e-73.

Now, (1.746e-73)^(2/3):

Compute (1.746)^(2/3): cube root of 1.746 is approx 1.2, squared is about 1.44.

Exponent part: (1e-73)^(2/3) = 1e^(-73*(2/3)) = 1e^(-48.6667) → 2.14e-49.

So 1.44 * 2.14e-49 ≈ 3.08e-49.

Denominator: 2 π m k → 2 * 3.1416 * 5.315e-26 kg * 1.381e-23 J/K.

Compute 5.315e-26 *1.381e-23 → 5.315 *1.381 = ~7.34, exponents 1e-26 *1e-23 = 1e-49 → 7.34e-49.

Multiply by 2π (≈6.283): 6.283 *7.34e-49 ≈4.61e-48.

So T = 3.08e-49 /4.61e-48 → 3.08/4.61 → ~0.668 → 0.668e-1 → 0.0668 K.

So approximately 0.067 K, which matches option E (0.068 K).

I think that's correct. So the answer is E.

To determine the temperature at which there are Avogadro's number of translational states available for $\mathrm{O}_2$ confined to a volume of $1000~\mathrm{cm}^3$, we use the translational partition function:

\[
q = \frac{V (2 \pi m k T)^{3/2}}{h^3}
\]

Here:
- $V = 1000~\mathrm{cm}^3 = 0.001~\mathrm{m}^3$,
- $m$ is the mass of an $\mathrm{O}_2$ molecule, calculated as $m = \frac{0.032~\mathrm{kg/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \approx 5.315 \times 10^{-26}~\mathrm{kg}$,
- $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}~\mathrm{J \cdot s}$ is Planck's constant,
- $k = 1.381 \times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{J/K}$ is Boltzmann's constant,
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

The problem states that the number of translational states is equal to Avogadro's number, $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$. Setting $q = N_A$, we solve for $T$:

\[
\frac{V (2 \pi m k T)^{3/2}}{h^3} = N_A
\]
