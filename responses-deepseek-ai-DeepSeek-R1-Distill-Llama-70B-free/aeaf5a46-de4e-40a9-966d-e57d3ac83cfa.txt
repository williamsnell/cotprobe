Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about criminal law, specifically focusing on what crime the gang leader committed in the given scenario. 

First, let me read the question carefully. A new gang member points a gun at a pedestrian and orders her to give up her expensive watch. She complies, and then the gang member tosses the watch to the gang leader, who is nearby. The leader, although surprised, puts the watch in his pocket, and the pedestrian runs away. The question is asking what crime the gang leader committed.

Alright, so I need to figure out the possible crimes here. Let's break down the scenario.

The new gang member committed a robbery. Robbery is the unlawful taking of property from a person using force or the threat of force. So the gang member pointed a gun, which is a threat of force, and took the watch. That's robbery. 

Now, what about the gang leader? The gang leader was standing nearby. He didn't point the gun or take the watch himself. But he received the watch from the gang member and kept it. The key here is whether he had knowledge that the watch was stolen or that a robbery was taking place.

So, the gang leader's actions: he was surprised by the act, but he still took the watch and put it in his pocket. So, did he knowingly receive stolen property? 

There's a legal concept called "receiving stolen property," which typically requires that the person knows or should know that the property is stolen. If the gang leader was surprised, maybe he didn't know beforehand, but once he saw the situation, he might have realized it was stolen. 

Alternatively, if he was an accomplice, he might be guilty as an accessory. But the timing matters here. Accessory before the fact would mean he helped plan or encourage the robbery before it happened. Accessory after the fact would mean he helped after the robbery was committed, like hiding evidence or the perpetrator. But in this case, he received the property, so it might be more about receiving stolen goods rather than being an accessory.

Wait, in this scenario, the gang leader didn't plan the robbery. The new member acted on his own to impress the leader. So the leader didn't conspire beforehand. So conspiracy (option I) might not apply. 

Accomplice to robbery (option A) would require that the leader assisted in the commission of the robbery. But the leader didn't do anything during the robbery; he just received the watch after. So that's probably not it. 

Accessory after the fact (option F) is someone who helps the principal after the crime, like hiding them or destroying evidence. Receiving the stolen property might fall under this, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be theft by receiving, which is a separate crime.

Theft by receiving (option E) would be if the leader knowingly received the stolen watch. Even if he was initially surprised, once he took it and put it in his pocket, he must have known it was stolen. So that might fit.

Option D says no crime, but that's unlikely because he accepted stolen property. 

So, possible options are E (theft by receiving) or F (accessory after the fact). 

Wait, what's the difference between the two? Accessory after the fact involves assisting the principal to escape detection or punishment. Receiving stolen property is more about handling the goods. 

In this case, the leader didn't help the robber escape; he just took the stolen watch. So that might be more accurately described as receiving stolen property. 

Therefore, the correct answer would be E: Theft by receiving.

The gang leader committed the crime of theft by receiving. He knowingly accepted the stolen watch from the gang member who had just committed robbery, even if he was initially surprised. Theft by receiving involves knowingly accepting property that one knows or should know is stolen, which fits the gang leader's actions. 

E: Theft by receiving.

Answer: E
