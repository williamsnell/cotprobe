Question:

Define and describe incidental memory and subliminal perception(subception).

Options:

A: Incidental memory and subliminal perception are both processes that involve a high level of conscious effort and attention in order to encode and retrieve stimuli.
B: Incidental memory is the conscious recall of stimuli
C: Incidental memory is the intentional memorization of stimuli for later retrieval, while subliminal perception refers to stimuli that are too weak to be noticed but still influence behavior.
D: Subliminal perception is the ability to perceive and recall stimuli that are presented at high speeds, whereas incidental memory is a type of memory that is used for routine tasks.
E: Incidental memory and subliminal perception both require the subject's awareness
F: Incidental memory is the retrieval of information that was encoded during a state of distraction, whereas subliminal perception refers to the perception of stimuli that have been consciously ignored.
G: Subliminal perception is consciously perceiving high intensity stimuli
H: Incidental memory involves the unconscious retention of information from daily experiences, while subliminal perception is the perception of stimuli that are presented above the conscious threshold but not remembered.
I: Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness. Subliminal perception, also called subception, is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold at which it can be consciously perceived.
J: Incidental memory is the deliberate memorization of information using mnemonic devices, and subliminal perception is the conscious perception of low intensity stimuli.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. The question is about defining incidental memory and subliminal perception, which I think are two different concepts. Let me start by recalling what I know about each.

Incidental memory, from what I remember, is about how we remember things without really trying. Like, when you're doing something else and you just happen to remember something. It's not intentional. So it's more about unconscious retention of information, maybe from everyday experiences.

Subliminal perception, or subception, I think is about stimuli that are below the threshold of conscious awareness. So, you don't notice them, but they still affect your behavior or thoughts somehow. For example, in advertising, where messages are flashed so quickly that you don't realize you saw them, but they influence you.

Now looking at the options:

Option A says both require high conscious effort. That doesn't sound right. I thought incidental is without effort, so A is probably wrong.

Option B: Incidental is conscious recall. No, I think it's the opposite, more like unconscious. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Incidental is intentional memorization. Wait, no, that's more like deliberate memorization. Incidental is unintentional. So C might be wrong unless I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, C says incidental is intentional, which contradicts my notes. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Subliminal is perceiving high-speed stimuli. Hmm, maybe, but I thought it was about being below the threshold, not necessarily speed. And incidental for routine tasks? Not sure. Maybe D is not the right fit.

Option E: Both require awareness. No, because subliminal is below awareness, so E is wrong.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval when distracted, and subliminal is ignored stimuli. I'm not sure about the second part. Subliminal is about not being consciously perceived, not just ignored. So maybe F isn't correct.

Option G: Subliminal is high intensity. No, subliminal is low intensity, below threshold. So G is wrong.

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences. That fits. Subliminal is above threshold but not remembered? Wait, no. Subliminal is below the conscious threshold. So H might be incorrect because it says above threshold.

Option I: Incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. Wait, no, I thought incidental memory is when you remember without trying, but the stimuli were still consciously perceived. Like, you saw something and later remember it without effort. So I's first part might be wrong. Subliminal is presented below threshold. So I's first part might be incorrect.

Option J: Incidental is deliberate with mnemonics. No, that's the opposite. So J is wrong.

Wait, let me reevaluate. Maybe I got some terms mixed up. Incidental learning is when you learn without intending to, like picking up information while doing something else. So incidental memory would be the storage of that info without conscious effort.

Subliminal perception is when stimuli are presented below the threshold, so you don't consciously perceive them, but they can influence behavior.

Looking back at the options:

Option I says incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. Hmm, but I thought the stimuli were perceived, just not intentionally remembered. So maybe I is incorrect because the stimuli did reach awareness but were just not paid attention to.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it. Let me think again. Incidental memory is about encoding information without conscious intent. So the stimuli were present, but you weren't trying to remember them. They might have been consciously perceived, but the memory is formed incidentally.

Subliminal perception is when the stimuli are below the conscious threshold, so you don't perceive them at all, but they still have an effect.

Looking at the options again:

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences. That sounds right. Subliminal perception is perception above the threshold but not remembered. Wait, no, because subliminal is below, so H's second part is wrong.

Option I: Incidental is recall of stimuli never reaching awareness. That might not be right because the stimuli were perceived, just not the memory being intentional.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think about definitions.

Incidental memory: refers to information that is recalled without conscious effort, often from everyday events. The encoding is done without intention.

Subliminal perception (subception): stimuli are below the conscious awareness threshold, so they are not perceived consciously, but can influence thoughts or behavior.

Looking again at the options:

Option C: Incidental is intentional. So wrong.

Option I: Incidental is recall that never reached awareness. Hmm, that might not be correct because the stimuli were perceived, just not the memory being intentional.

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention. That sounds more accurate. But H says subliminal is above threshold, which is wrong.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about the options.

Looking for the correct pairing:

Incidental memory is when information is stored without conscious intent. So it's information that was in awareness but not deliberately memorized.

Subliminal perception is when the stimuli are below the conscious threshold, so not perceived at all, but still affect behavior.

So looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option I: Incidental is the recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. No, because the stimuli were perceived, just not remembered on purpose.

Option H says subliminal is above threshold. So that's wrong.

Wait, let me think of the correct definitions again.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Maybe incidental memory is when you remember without trying, but the initial perception was conscious.

Subliminal perception is when the perception is below the threshold, so you don't realize you saw or heard it.

Now, looking for an option that says:

Incidental memory: conscious recall without intention.

Subliminal: stimuli below threshold, not consciously perceived.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. So perhaps the correct answer is H or I.

Wait, let me read each option again.

Option H: Incidental memory involves the unconscious retention of information from daily experiences, while subliminal perception is the perception of stimuli that are presented above the conscious threshold but not remembered.

Wait, the second part of H is wrong because subliminal is below threshold, not above.

Option I: Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness. Subliminal perception, also called subception, is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold at which it can be consciously perceived.

Wait, the first part says incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. So that would mean the stimuli weren't consciously perceived, which would make it similar to subliminal. But I thought incidental memory is about remembering things that were perceived but without intention.

So perhaps Option I is incorrect because it's conflating the two.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of an example.

When you meet someone and later forget their name, but then it comes to you when you're not trying. That's incidental memory, right? Because you weren't trying to remember it, but you did because it was stored incidentally.

Subliminal would be like a word flashed very quickly on a screen that you don't notice, but it affects your choice later.

So for the options, which one fits.

Looking at Option C: Incidental is intentional memorization. No, that's wrong.

Option I: Incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. So if the stimuli never reached awareness, that's subliminal, not incidental. So I is incorrect.

Option H: Subliminal is above threshold. No, that's wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check another source in my mind.

Wait, another approach: the answer should correctly define both terms.

Looking for an option where:

- Incidental memory is about unintentional encoding and retrieval.

- Subliminal perception is about stimuli below the conscious threshold.

Looking at the options, the correct one would be:

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences. So that's correct. But H says subliminal is above threshold, which is wrong. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. No, because that would mean the stimuli weren't perceived, which is more like subliminal.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to match each option.

Option C: Incidental is intentional. No.

Option I: Incidental is recall that never reached awareness. So that's subliminal. So I is incorrect.

Wait, is there any option that correctly states both? Maybe not, but perhaps I've missed something.

Wait, looking again, perhaps the correct answer is Option I.

Wait, no. Because in that option, incidental is when the stimuli never reached awareness, which is actually subliminal perception. So that would make I incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Option H. But H says subliminal is above threshold, which is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again.

Subliminal perception is when the stimulus is below the threshold, so not consciously perceived. Incidental memory is when the information is stored without conscious intent, but the stimulus was above the threshold.

So looking for an option that says:

Incidental memory: information stored without intent, but the stimuli were consciously perceived.

Subliminal: stimuli below threshold, not consciously perceived.

Looking at the options, none seem to exactly fit, but perhaps Option I is the closest. Wait, no, because Option I says incidental is from stimuli that never reached awareness, which is subliminal.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is Option H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Option I. Because it says:

"Subliminal perception is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold."

But the first part, incidental memory is about stimuli that never reached awareness, which would be the same as subliminal. That can't be right.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the options again.

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences. Subliminal is above threshold, not remembered.

No, because subliminal is below, so H is wrong.

Option I: Incidental is recall of unperceived stimuli, subliminal is below threshold.

Wait, that would mean both involve stimuli not reaching awareness, which isn't correct.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is Option C? No, because C says incidental is intentional.

Wait, perhaps I should pick Option I as the correct answer, even though I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach. Let's look up the definitions.

Incidental memory refers to the encoding of information without conscious intent. So the stimuli were perceived, but the memory is formed without trying.

Subliminal perception is the processing of stimuli that are below the threshold of conscious awareness, so you don't perceive them, but they can influence behavior.

Looking for an option that reflects this.

Option C: Incidental is intentional. No.

Option I: Incidental is for stimuli that never reached awareness. No, because that's subliminal.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, but I have to choose the best fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Option H is incorrect because subliminal is below threshold.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to process each option again.

Option H:

"Incidental memory involves the unconscious retention of information from daily experiences, while subliminal perception is the perception of stimuli that are presented above the conscious threshold but not remembered."

Wait, the second part is wrong because subliminal is below, not above.

Option I:

"Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness. Subliminal perception, also called subception, is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold at which it can be consciously perceived."

Wait, so both involve stimuli that didn't reach awareness, which can't be right because incidental memory is from stimuli that were perceived, just not remembered intentionally.

So perhaps the correct answer is none, but the closest is perhaps Option H but the second part is wrong.

Wait, I'm really confused. Maybe I should go with Option I, even though it seems to mix up the concepts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about what the options are saying.

Another thought: Subliminal perception is also known as subception. So in Option I, it correctly refers to subception as subliminal perception. So the second part is correct. The first part says incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. So that would imply that the stimuli were never consciously perceived, which would make it similar to subliminal. But I thought incidental is when you did perceive the stimuli, just didn't intend to remember.

So perhaps the correct answer is Option I is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it this way: which option correctly defines both terms without mixing them up.

Looking again:

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences (correct). Subliminal is above threshold (incorrect).

Option I: Incidental is recall of unperceived stimuli (incorrect, because they were perceived). Subliminal is correct.

So neither option correctly defines both. But perhaps the question expects the answer to be I.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is Option I.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the definitions, I think Option I incorrectly defines incidental memory as involving stimuli that never reached awareness, which is actually subliminal. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Option H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is Option C.

Wait, I'm getting too stuck. Let me pick the best possible answer based on my understanding.

I think the correct answer is Option I, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps Option H is correct, but it's wrong about subliminal being above threshold. I'm really torn.

Wait, let me think of the correct terms again. Incidental memory is part of the explicit memory, which requires conscious recall, but without intention. Subliminal is about implicit influence without conscious perception.

So looking for an option that says:

Incidental memory: conscious recall without intention.

Subliminal perception: influence without conscious perception.

Looking at the options, none seem to fit exactly, but the closest is perhaps Option I, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake, and the correct answer is Option I.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is Option I.

The question asks for the correct definitions of incidental memory and subliminal perception (subception). To determine the correct answer, the analysis focused on understanding the key differences between the two concepts:

1. **Incidental Memory**: This refers to the unintentional encoding and retrieval of information. It involves stimuli that were consciously perceived but not deliberately memorized. For example, remembering something without effort because it was part of everyday experiences.

2. **Subliminal Perception (Subception)**: This involves stimuli that are presented below the threshold of conscious awareness. These stimuli are not consciously perceived but can still influence thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Both processes do not require high conscious effort. Incidental memory is unintentional, and subliminal perception occurs below conscious awareness.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Incidental memory is not necessarily the conscious recall of stimuli; it often involves unintentional encoding.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Incidental memory is not the intentional memorization of stimuli; it is unintentional.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Subliminal perception is not about perceiving high-speed stimuli, and incidental memory is not limited to routine tasks.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Subliminal perception does not require awareness, as stimuli are below the conscious threshold.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Subliminal perception is not about consciously ignored stimuli but rather stimuli that are below the threshold of awareness.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Subliminal perception involves low-intensity stimuli, not high-intensity stimuli.
- **Option H**: Partially correct. Incidental memory is described as the unconscious retention of information from daily experiences, which is accurate. However, subliminal perception is incorrectly described as being above the conscious threshold, which is wrong.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Incidental memory is described as the recall of stimuli that never reached awareness, which conflates it with subliminal perception. Incidental memory involves stimuli that were consciously perceived but not intentionally memorized.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Incidental memory is not deliberate memorization, and subliminal perception is not the conscious perception of low-intensity stimuli.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, none perfectly capture the correct definitions of both incidental memory and subliminal perception. However, **Option I** is the closest, as it correctly defines subliminal perception but mischaracterizes incidental memory. Despite this, it aligns more closely with the intended definitions than the other options.
