Okay, so I've got this legal question about defamation and evidence admissibility. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The scenario is: A high school basketball coach is suing a newspaper for defamation. The newspaper published that the coach was a bad role model and morally unfit. The coach called a player to testify that he was a good role model. Now, the newspaper is calling a witness who says he saw the coach giving beer to players three times after victories. The question is about whether this testimony is admissible.

Hmm, defamation cases... I remember that in defamation, the plaintiff has to prove that the defendant made a false statement that harmed their reputation. The newspaper is the defendant here, so they might be trying to prove that their statement was true, which would be a defense against defamation.

Wait, truth is an absolute defense in defamation. So if the newspaper can show that the coach was indeed a bad role model, their statement isn't defamatory. So the witness's testimony is about the coach giving beer to players. That sounds relevant because providing alcohol to minors (assuming the players are minors) is illegal and unethical, which would reflect poorly on the coach's character and role model status.

But what about the rules of evidence? The testimony is about specific instances of conduct. I recall that in general, specific instances of conduct can't be used to prove character, but there are exceptions. Oh right, in a defamation case where the plaintiff's character is at issue, character evidence is admissible. 

Wait, when is character evidence allowed? Normally, under FRE 404(a), evidence of a person's character or character trait is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion. But there are exceptions. For example, when character is a central issue in the case. In defamation cases, the plaintiff's reputation is a key element, so I think that opens the door for character evidence.

So in this case, the witness's testimony about the coach giving beer would be admissible as substantive evidence to show that the coach was indeed unfit, supporting the newspaper's statement. It's not just about intent or a common scheme; it directly goes to the truth of the statement, which is a defense.

Looking at the options:

A: Admissible as motive. Maybe, but motive isn't the main issue here. The issue is whether the statement was true.

B: Inadmissible for character, but for intent or scheme. Not sure, but I think it's more about the truth.

C: Admissible as substantive evidence. That sounds right because it's about a specific act showing the coach's behavior.

D: Admissible for impeachment only. Impeachment would be if it's used to contradict the plaintiff's witness, but the coach didn't testify about this, so maybe not.

E: Inadmissible as irrelevant. No, it's relevant to the coach's character.

F: Admissible to contradict plaintiff's testimony. The plaintiff didn't testify about this, so this might not apply.

G: Prejudicial. All evidence against the plaintiff is prejudicial, but it's still admissible if relevant.

H: Admissible as character evidence in defamation. Yes, because in defamation cases, character is a main issue.

I: Hearsay. The testimony is direct observation, so not hearsay.

So the options are between C and H. The witness's testimony is about specific acts, which under FRE 405 allows for proving character with specific instances when character is an essential element. Since this is a defamation case, the plaintiff's character is at issue, making this evidence admissible as substantive to show the truth of the newspaper's statement.

So the correct answer should be C: admissible as substantive evidence, or H? Wait, H says it's admissible as character evidence. But under FRE 405(a), when character is an essential element, specific instances are allowed. So in a defamation case, character is in issue, making it admissible as character evidence. But the testimony here is about specific instances, so it's substantive evidence to prove that the coach was unfit, which goes to the truth of the statement.

Wait, the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. As substantive evidence, it can be used to prove the truth, which is a defense. So the answer would be C: admissible as substantive evidence.

Alternatively, H says it's admissible as character evidence in a defamation suit, which is correct because in defamation, character is in issue, allowing such evidence.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The newspaper is asserting that their statement was true. So they need to prove that the coach was indeed a bad role model. The witness's testimony about providing beer is a specific instance of conduct that shows bad character, making the newspaper's statement true. So the evidence is admissible to prove the truth, which would be substantive evidence.

But under evidence rules, when character is in issue, you can use specific acts, so that would make it admissible under H as well. So both C and H could be correct, but looking at the options, H says it's admissible as character evidence in a defamation suit. C says it's admissible as substantive evidence.

I think the correct answer is H because in a defamation case, character is in issue, allowing the use of specific instances as character evidence. So the testimony is admissible as character evidence.

Wait, but the newspaper is trying to prove the truth of their statement, which would be a defense. So the testimony is relevant and admissible as substantive evidence because it shows the coach's conduct supports the newspaper's claim. So maybe C is correct.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's character evidence, making H correct. But I'm more inclined to think that the evidence is being used to show the truth, making it substantive evidence under C.

Wait, but in defamation cases, the defendant can introduce evidence of the plaintiff's character to show that the statement was true. So the testimony is about the plaintiff's character, which is an issue here. Therefore, under FRE 405(a), when character is an essential element, specific instances are admissible. So the testimony is admissible as character evidence, making H correct.

I think I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to outline:

- Defendant's defense: The statement was true (truth is a defense).
- To prove truth, they can show the plaintiff's bad character.
- In defamation, plaintiff's character is at issue, so under FRE 405(a), specific instances of conduct are admissible to prove character.
- Therefore, the testimony is admissible as character evidence in a defamation suit, so option H.

Yes, I think H is the correct answer.
</think>

In a defamation case, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false statement that damaged their reputation. The defendant, in this case, is asserting that the statement was true, which would serve as a valid defense. Here, the newspaper is attempting to prove that the coach was indeed a bad role model by introducing testimony about specific instances of conduct (providing beer to players). 

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), character evidence is generally inadmissible to prove that a person acted in conformity with a particular character trait on a specific occasion (FRE 404(a)). However, in defamation cases, the plaintiff's character is a central issue, making it an exception under FRE 405(a). This rule allows the use of specific instances of conduct to prove character when character is an essential element of the case.

The witness's testimony about the coach giving beer to players is directly relevant to the coach's character and role model status. It is admissible as character evidence in this defamation suit because the plaintiff's character is at issue, and the testimony supports the newspaper's defense that their statement was true. Therefore, the testimony is admissible as character evidence under the specific rules applicable to defamation cases.

ANSWER: H
