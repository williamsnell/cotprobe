Question:

After weeks of deliberation, a boyfriend decided to embark on his plan to rob a bank. As part of his scheme, the boyfriend enlisted his girlfriend, who agreed to drive the getaway car. On the day of the robbery, the girlfriend and the boyfriend drove to the bank. After the girlfriend parked outside and the boyfriend went into the bank, she saw a security guard in the bank and changed her mind and fled on foot, leaving the keys in the car with the motor running. A few minutes later, the boyfriend went into the bank, robbed it, and then ran back to the car. He drove off and was speeding away from the bank when he looked behind to see if he was being followed. As he took his eye off the road, the boyfriend's vehicle struck a pedestrian who was crossing the street, killing her. For the pedestrian's death, the girlfriend should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

Options:

A: Murder.
B: No crime.
C: Involuntary manslaughter.
D: Negligent homicide.
E: Conspiracy to commit murder.
F: Attempted murder.
G: Second degree murder.
H: Accessory after the fact.
I: Voluntary manslaughter.

Okay, so I've got this question here about criminal law, specifically about the possible crimes that the girlfriend might be guilty of after a bank robbery goes wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me go through the facts. The boyfriend and girlfriend plan to rob a bank. The girlfriend agrees to drive the getaway car. On the day, she parks outside, the boyfriend goes in, she sees a security guard, changes her mind, and flees on foot, leaving the keys in the car with the engine running. Later, the boyfriend robs the bank, comes back to the car, drives off, and while speeding away, he hits and kills a pedestrian because he was looking behind.

The question is asking what crime, if any, the girlfriend should be found guilty of regarding the pedestrian's death.

Alright, so the key here is to figure out the girlfriend's liability for the death. The girlfriend withdrew from the robbery by fleeing, but she left the car with the keys in it. So the boyfriend used that car to commit the robbery and then the accident happened.

Let's consider the possible charges:

A: Murder. That's probably too severe. Murder usually requires intent or extreme recklessness. The girlfriend didn't intend for anyone to die, and her withdrawal might remove her liability for the robbery itself. But maybe felony murder? Wait, felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony. But in this case, the girlfriend withdrew before the robbery. So if she withdrew effectively, she might not be on the hook for felony murder.

B: No crime. Maybe, but I'm not sure. She did agree to be part of the robbery, but she withdrew before it happened.

C: Involuntary manslaughter. This is killing without intent but during the commission of an unlawful act. So maybe if her actions contributed to the death, even unintentionally.

D: Negligent homicide. That's when someone's negligence causes death. But I'm not sure if her leaving the car running would count as negligence leading directly to the death.

E: Conspiracy to commit murder. No, because the original plan was robbery, not murder. They didn't plan to kill anyone, so this doesn't fit.

F: Attempted murder. No, she didn't attempt to kill anyone.

G: Second degree murder. That's more deliberate, which doesn't fit here.

H: Accessory after the fact. That's when someone helps a criminal after the crime. But she fled before the robbery, so maybe not applicable.

I: Voluntary manslaughter. That's intentional killing in heat of passion, which doesn't apply here.

So the main options are A, C, D, or B.

Now, considering the withdrawal. In criminal law, for conspiracy or aiding and abetting, if someone withdraws before the crime is committed, they might not be liable. But here, the girlfriend was part of the initial plan. She agreed to drive, which is an integral part of the robbery. But she withdrew before the robbery by leaving. So does her withdrawal before the crime (robbery) mean she's not liable for the robbery or any deaths arising from it?

Wait, but the robbery happened after she left. So the boyfriend went in, robbed the bank, then used the car she left. The accident happened during his getaway. So the question is whether her leaving the car made her responsible for his actions.

In terms of aiding and abetting, she initially agreed to help, but withdrew. But under the withdrawal rule, to avoid liability, she must withdraw before the commission of the crime and must communicate her withdrawal to the other conspirators. Here, she just left; she didn't tell the boyfriend she was out. So maybe her withdrawal wasn't effective, and she's still on the hook.

Alternatively, if she effectively withdrew, she might not be liable for the robbery, but what about the death?

Another angle is felony murder. If during the robbery (a felony), a death occurs, all participants in the felony can be liable for murder, even if the killing was accidental. But felony murder requires that the death occurred during the commission of the felony and that the defendant was a participant.

But the girlfriend withdrew before the robbery. So she's not part of the felony when it was committed. Therefore, she might not be liable under felony murder.

However, when she left the car, she facilitated the robbery. So perhaps she's an aider and abettor in the robbery, which makes her responsible for the felony, and thus for any deaths during the felony.

Wait, but she withdrew before the robbery occurred. So the robbery happened after she left. So maybe she's not part of the commission of the robbery, but she did aid in the initial planning.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's think about the possible charges. The pedestrian's death happened during the getaway, which is part of the robbery. So if the girlfriend is liable for the robbery, then under felony murder, she could be guilty of murder. But does her withdrawal before the robbery mean she's not liable?

I think the key here is whether her withdrawal was effective. If she withdrew before the commission of the crime, and communicated that withdrawal, then she's not liable. But she didn't communicate; she just left. So maybe her withdrawal wasn't effective, and she's still part of the conspiracy.

Alternatively, under the model penal code, a conspirator can withdraw if they do so before the commission of any crime and take affirmative steps to prevent the crime. She didn't take any steps to prevent the robbery; she just left. So perhaps she's still on the hook.

So if she's part of the robbery, then the death during the robbery (even though it's during the getaway) would make her guilty of felony murder. But felony murder is a form of murder, so option A.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, felony murder requires that the death was a natural and probable consequence of the felony. Here, the boyfriend was speeding and hit a pedestrian. That's a possible consequence, but maybe not entirely foreseeable. Though in felony murder, foreseeability isn't always required.

But wait, the question is asking about the girlfriend's liability. If she's guilty of felony murder, then the answer would be A: Murder. But she didn't commit the robbery herself; she withdrew before it happened. So maybe she's not part of the felony when it was committed.

Alternatively, maybe she's guilty of involuntary manslaughter because her actions (leaving the car) led to the death, even though she didn't intend it. So if her leaving the car was reckless, then she could be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

So which is it?

I think the key is whether she's still part of the robbery when the death occurred. If she effectively withdrew, then she's not. If she didn't, then she is.

Since she didn't communicate her withdrawal, perhaps she's still part of the conspiracy, making her liable for the robbery and thus the death as felony murder.

But felony murder is a type of murder, so that would make her guilty of murder.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. If she withdrew before the robbery, she's not part of the felony when it occurred. So she can't be guilty of felony murder.

So then, maybe her liability is for involuntary manslaughter, because her act of leaving the car running contributed to the death, even though she didn't intend it.

But was her act criminally negligent? She left the car with the keys in it, which the boyfriend used. She knew he intended to rob the bank, so she could foresee that he might drive recklessly. So perhaps her act was reckless, leading to involuntary manslaughter.

Alternatively, she's guilty of being an accessory or aiding and abetting the robbery, making her responsible for the death.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the possible theories.

1. Conspiracy: She initially conspired to commit robbery. If she withdrew before the robbery, does she avoid liability? If her withdrawal wasn't effective, she might still be on the hook.

2. Aiding and Abetting: She provided the getaway car. Even if she withdrew, if she didn't effectively withdraw, she's still an aider and abettor.

3. Felony Murder: If she's part of the robbery, any death during the robbery (including during the getaway) would make her guilty of murder.

But she withdrew before the robbery, so she's not part of the robbery when it happened. So she's not guilty of felony murder.

Wait, but the robbery was still part of their plan, and she provided the means (the car) which was used. So perhaps she's still liable as an aider and abettor, making her responsible for the robbery and thus the death.

Alternatively, she's not liable for the robbery because she withdrew, but she's liable for her own actions that caused the death.

But her action was leaving the car, which the boyfriend used. So perhaps she's guilty of involuntary manslaughter because her act was criminally negligent.

Involuntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another without malice. It can be based on the commission of a misdemeanor (misdemeanor manslaughter) or on criminal negligence (criminal negligence manslaughter).

If her leaving the car was a misdemeanor, then misdemeanor manslaughter applies. But what misdemeanor? Abandoning a vehicle? Or perhaps she's guilty of aiding a felony.

Wait, maybe she's guilty of being an accessory before the fact. But she withdrew, so maybe not.

Another angle: The girlfriend's act of leaving the car with keys in it enabled the boyfriend to commit the robbery and the subsequent death. So her action was a but-for cause of the death. But does that make her criminally liable?

In terms of causation, yes. But legally, does that translate to a criminal charge?

If she didn't commit any crime, but her action led to the death, perhaps she's guilty of negligent homicide. But negligent homicide requires that her negligence caused the death.

So, she left the car with the engine on, knowing that her boyfriend intended to commit a robbery. She could have foreseen that he might drive recklessly, leading to an accident. So her action was negligent, and that negligence led to the death.

So, perhaps she's guilty of involuntary manslaughter or negligent homicide.

Looking at the options, C is involuntary manslaughter, D is negligent homicide.

In some jurisdictions, involuntary manslaughter can be based on criminal negligence, so perhaps both C and D could apply. But the answer options are separate.

Alternatively, in this case, since she was part of a felony (robbery), even if she withdrew, maybe she's still guilty of felony murder. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the key is that she withdrew before the robbery. So she's not part of the robbery. Therefore, she can't be guilty of felony murder.

So, her only possible liability is for her own actions leading to the death, which would be involuntary manslaughter or negligent homicide.

Between C and D, which applies? Involuntary manslaughter is typically killing without intent but during an unlawful act. If her leaving the car was an unlawful act, then maybe. But she didn't commit a crime when she left the car. She just left.

Alternatively, her initial conspiracy to commit robbery is a crime, but she withdrew. So maybe she's not guilty of that.

Wait, but she did commit the act of conspiracy. Conspiracy is a crime. So if she conspired to commit robbery, and robbery is a felony, and she withdrew, but perhaps she's still guilty of conspiracy.

But the question is about the pedestrian's death, not about the conspiracy.

So, perhaps her liability is for involuntary manslaughter because her actions (leaving the car) were reckless and caused the death.

So the answer would be C: Involuntary manslaughter.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction doesn't require an underlying misdemeanor, then it's criminal negligence, which is D.

But I'm more inclined towards C, as involuntary manslaughter often includes criminal negligence.

Wait, but felony murder is a type of murder, and if she's not guilty of felony murder, then the other options are C or D.

I think in this case, the correct answer is C: Involuntary manslaughter because her action of leaving the car was part of the robbery plan, and the death occurred as a result. So she's guilty of manslaughter.

Alternatively, some might argue that she's guilty of murder under the felony murder rule, but I think she withdrew before the robbery, so she's not part of the felony when it occurred.

Therefore, the best answer is C.

The question revolves around determining the criminal liability of the girlfriend for the pedestrian's death following a bank robbery. The key facts are that the girlfriend agreed to drive the getaway car, withdrew before the robbery by fleeing, but left the car with the keys in it, enabling the boyfriend to commit the robbery and subsequently cause the pedestrian's death while speeding away.

To analyze the girlfriend's liability:

1. **Murder (A, G):** Murder requires intent or extreme recklessness. The girlfriend did not intend for anyone to die, and while felony murder could apply if a death occurs during a felony, the girlfriend withdrew before the robbery. Since the robbery occurred after her withdrawal, she is not part of the felony when the death happened, making felony murder inapplicable.

2. **No Crime (B):** This is unlikely because the girlfriend's actions contributed to the death, even if unintentionally. Her withdrawal does not entirely absolve her of liability.

3. **Involuntary Manslaughter (C):** This applies to unlawful killings without intent, often due to criminal negligence or during the commission of a misdemeanor. The girlfriend's act of leaving the car with the keys in it could be considered reckless, as she knew the boyfriend intended to rob the bank and could foresee reckless driving. This recklessness contributed to the pedestrian's death, making involuntary manslaughter a plausible charge.

4. **Negligent Homicide (D):** This involves negligence causing death. While the girlfriend's actions were negligent, involuntary manslaughter is more appropriate here because it often encompasses criminal negligence, especially in the context of contributing to a felony.

5. **Conspiracy to Commit Murder (E):** This does not apply, as the plan was to commit robbery, not murder.

6. **Attempted Murder (F):** There is no evidence the girlfriend intended or attempted to kill anyone.

7. **Voluntary Manslaughter (I):** This involves intentional killing in the heat of passion, which is irrelevant here.

8. **Accessory After the Fact (H):** This applies to assisting a criminal after the crime, but the girlfriend fled before the robbery, so this does not apply.

The girlfriend's withdrawal before the robbery means she is not liable under felony murder, but her actions (leaving the car) were reckless and contributed to the death. This makes involuntary manslaughter the most appropriate charge, as it accounts for her recklessness without requiring intent to kill.

**Answer: C**
