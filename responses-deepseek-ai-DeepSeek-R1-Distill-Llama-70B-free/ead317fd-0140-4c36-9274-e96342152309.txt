Question:

Doug Dogman had a domesticated golden retriever named Rover. Rover was a good, friendly dog who loved to run and chase cars but had never hurt anyone. One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for

Options:

A: Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.
B: Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.
C: Ginny, because Rover was not on a leash and was not supervised.
D: Doug, because Ginny was responsible for maintaining control of her vehicle.
E: Ginny, because Rover was chasing cars, a potentially dangerous activity.
F: Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.
G: Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.
H: Doug, because Rover was not known to be a dangerous dog.
I: Doug, because Ginny was negligent in hitting a parked car.
J: Ginny, because Doug was not present when the incident occurred.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically strict liability. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about whether Doug Dogman would be liable under strict liability when his dog, Rover, caused an accident.

First, I remember that strict liability for animals usually applies in certain circumstances. I think it's when the animal is known to have dangerous tendencies or when the owner is negligent. But wait, isn't there a general rule about domesticated animals?

So, Rover is a golden retriever, which is a breed not typically considered dangerous. The question says Rover had never hurt anyone, so no known vicious propensities. But he was chasing cars, which might be considered a dangerous activity.

Strict liability under the theory that the owner is responsible for the actions of their pets, but I think that's more in cases where the animal has a history of being dangerous. Like, if a dog bites someone and it's known to be aggressive, the owner is strictly liable. But for a first-time incident with a normally calm breed, maybe not.

So, the scenario is that Ginny swerved to avoid Rover and hit a parked car, causing her injury. The claim is under strict liability, not negligence. So I'm thinking about whether Doug is strictly liable regardless of whether he was negligent.

I think the key here is whether the dog was engaging in a dangerous activity. Chasing cars could be seen as such. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules. Another point is whether the dog was on a leash. The options mention whether the dog was leashed or not. Oh, the question says Rover was chasing cars, implying he wasn't on a leash.

Wait, but strict liability for dogs can sometimes depend on whether the owner violated a leash law. If a local ordinance requires dogs to be on a leash and the owner didn't do that, then maybe strict liability applies. But if there's no such statute, maybe Doug isn't liable.

Looking at the options, option A says Doug is liable unless there's a statute banning unleashed dogs. So, if such a statute exists, then Doug would be strictly liable. Otherwise, he might not be.

Option G says the strict liability rule wouldn't apply because Rover wasn't showing vicious propensities. But I think that's more about whether the owner knew the dog was dangerous, which is a different point.

Option C says Ginny wins because Rover wasn't on a leash and was unsupervised. But I'm not sure if that's enough for strict liability. It might relate more to negligence than strict liability.

Option E says Ginny wins because Rover was chasing cars, a dangerous activity. But I'm not sure if that's automatically a basis for strict liability without some other factor like a leash law violation.

So, putting it together: If there's a local ordinance requiring dogs to be leashed, then Doug's failure to leash Rover would make him strictly liable. But if there's no such law, then maybe not.

Looking at the options, option A says Doug wins unless a statute/ordinance bans unleashed dogs. So, the court would likely find for Doug unless there's such a law. So, without the statute, the strict liability wouldn't apply.

So the answer should be A.

The question revolves around whether Doug Dogman can be held strictly liable for injuries caused by his dog, Rover, under the given circumstances. Strict liability for animals typically applies when the animal has known dangerous tendencies or when the owner violates a statute or ordinance, such as a leash law. In this case, Rover, a golden retriever, has no history of vicious behavior, and the incident occurred while he was chasing cars, which could be considered a dangerous activity. However, the key factor is whether there is a statute or ordinance requiring dogs to be leashed. If such a law exists and Doug violated it, he could be strictly liable. Without such a statute, strict liability would not apply.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that Doug would not be liable unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs, aligning with the requirement for strict liability in such cases.
- **Option G** is incorrect because it focuses on the absence of vicious propensities, which is irrelevant here since strict liability can also apply based on statutory violations.
- Other options either misapply the law or focus on irrelevant factors like negligence.

Thus, the court would likely find for Doug unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs.

Answer: A
