Okay, so I'm trying to answer this history question about Hernando de Soto's expedition and the people he encountered. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Hernando de Soto was a Spanish explorer who led an expedition into the southeastern region of what is now the United States. This was in the 16th century, I think around the 1540s. His journey took him through parts of present-day Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and other areas.

The question is asking about the descendants of which people his expedition encountered. The options are various Native American groups, so I need to match the region De Soto was in with the correct Native American culture.

I recall that the Mississippian culture was prominent in the Eastern Woodlands, particularly in the Mississippi River Valley and the Southeast. They are known for building large earthen mounds, which were used for ceremonial and political purposes. Their society was more complex, with chiefdoms and agriculture, which aligns with what I remember about De Soto's encounters.

Wait, but I also remember that the Aztecs were in Mexico, so that's probably not the answer here. The Mayans were further south as well, in what's now Mexico, Guatemala, etc. The Incas were in South America, so definitely not the Southeast US.

The Hopewell and Adena cultures were earlier, part of the Eastern Woodlands as well, but I think they were more from the Ohio River Valley area and earlier time periods, maybe before the Mississippian. The Ancestral Puebloans were in the Southwest, like the Four Corners area, so that's not where De Soto went.

The Kwakiutl were a tribe on the Northwest Coast, so that's not relevant here. The Clovis culture was much earlier, like during the last Ice Age, so that's way before De Soto's time.

The Olmec were one of the earliest civilizations in Mesoamerica, but again, not in the region De Soto explored.

So putting it all together, De Soto was in the Southeast, and the main culture there at that time would have been the Mississippian. The Mississippian culture flourished from around 800 to 1500 CE, which includes the time when De Soto arrived. They had large settlements and mound-building, which matches historical accounts of De Soto's encounters.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: Mississippian.

Hernando de Soto's expedition took place in the southeastern region of North America in the 16th century, specifically the 1540s. During this time, the dominant culture in the area was the Mississippian culture, known for its complex societies, agriculture, and construction of large earthen mounds for ceremonial and political purposes. This aligns with historical accounts of De Soto's encounters. Other options, such as the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas, were located in Mexico or South America, while the Hopewell and Adena cultures were earlier and centered in the Ohio River Valley. The Ancestral Puebloans, Kwakiutl, and Clovis cultures were in entirely different regions or time periods. The Olmec, while significant in Mesoamerica, were not in the Southeast during De Soto's time. Therefore, the correct answer is the Mississippian culture.

Answer: C
