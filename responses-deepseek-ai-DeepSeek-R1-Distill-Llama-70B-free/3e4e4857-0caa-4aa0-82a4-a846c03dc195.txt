Question:

How can evaluation apprehension be eliminated fromsocial psychologicalexperimental settings?

Options:

A: By conducting the experiment with subject's peers present
B: By offering financial incentives to the subjects
C: By making the subject aware they are being observed
D: Through field experimentation and 'nonobtrusive' approaches
E: By providing subjects with false feedback on their performance
F: By increasing the number of observers in the experiment
G: By using a double-blind procedure where neither the subjects nor the experimenters know the true purpose of the study
H: By conducting the experiment in a familiar environment

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to eliminate evaluation apprehension in social psychology experiments. Hmm, what's evaluation apprehension again? I think it's when participants change their behavior because they're aware they're being judged or evaluated. So, like, if someone knows they're in an experiment, they might act differently than they normally would because they're worried about what others think of them.

The question is asking how to eliminate that. Let me look at the options:

Option A: Conducting the experiment with the subject's peers present. Wait, wouldn't having peers around make them more apprehensive? Because now they're not only being watched by the experimenter but also by their friends or others. That might make the problem worse, not better.

Option B: Offering financial incentives. I'm not sure. Maybe if you pay people, they might try harder, but does that reduce their concern about being judged? I don't think so. It could even make them more anxious to perform well for the money.

Option C: Making the subject aware they're being observed. Oh, that sounds counterintuitive. If you tell them they're being watched, wouldn't that increase their apprehension? So that's probably not the right choice.

Option D: Through field experimentation and nonobtrusive approaches. Field experiments are done in real-world settings, not in a lab. Nonobtrusive means the participants don't know they're being studied. So if they're unaware, they won't change their behavior because of evaluation apprehension. That makes sense. Like, if you observe people in their natural environment without them knowing, they behave more naturally.

Option E: Providing false feedback. Hmm, that might affect their performance, but does it address the root issue of evaluation apprehension? I'm not sure. If they're still aware they're being evaluated, even with false feedback, they might still be apprehensive.

Option F: Increasing the number of observers. That would probably make it worse. More people watching might make participants more nervous about being judged.

Option G: Double-blind procedure. That's when neither the subjects nor the experimenters know the true purpose. This is more about reducing experimenter bias, I think. It doesn't directly address whether the subjects are aware of being observed or judged.

Option H: Conducting the experiment in a familiar environment. That might make participants more comfortable, but if they still know they're in an experiment, they could still be apprehensive about evaluation.

So putting it all together, the best way to eliminate evaluation apprehension is to make sure participants aren't aware they're being observed or judged. That points to option D, using field experiments with nonobtrusive methods. Because if they don't know they're part of an experiment, they won't change their behavior due to evaluation fears.

To eliminate evaluation apprehension in social psychology experiments, the key is to ensure that participants are not aware they are being observed or judged, as this awareness can alter their natural behavior. Among the options provided:

- **Option A** would likely increase apprehension by adding more observers (peers).
- **Option B** (financial incentives) might motivate participants but doesn't address the core issue of evaluation concerns.
- **Option C** (making participants aware of observation) would exacerbate apprehension.
- **Option D** (field experimentation and nonobtrusive approaches) is effective because it observes participants in their natural environment without their knowledge, eliminating evaluation apprehension.
- **Option E** (false feedback) doesn't resolve the root issue of awareness.
- **Option F** (more observers) would worsen apprehension.
- **Option G** (double-blind procedure) addresses experimenter bias, not participant apprehension.
- **Option H** (familiar environment) may improve comfort but doesn't eliminate evaluation concerns if participants still know they're being studied.

The most effective approach is **Option D**, as it removes the awareness of being observed, thereby eliminating evaluation apprehension.
