Okay, so I've got this networking question here about polling in a network with primary and secondary stations. Hmm, I remember that polling is a method where the primary station asks each secondary if they have data to send. So the setup is one primary and four secondary stations. Each secondary has five frames to send. 

The question gives me the sizes of different frames: data frame is 1000 bytes, and each poll, ACK, NAK is 32 bytes. Oh wait, and each station can send only one frame per poll. So I need to figure out the total bytes exchanged.

Let me break it down. So the primary sends a poll to each secondary one by one. When a secondary gets a poll, it can respond with either an ACK (if it has no data) or send a data frame (if it does). But in this case, each secondary has five frames, so I guess they'll send data each time they're polled until all their frames are sent.

Wait, no, the question says each station can send only one frame in response to a poll. So each time the primary sends a poll, the secondary can send one data frame if it has any. So for each secondary, since they have five frames, the primary has to poll each of them five times to get all their data.

So for each secondary, there are five rounds of polling and data transfer. Let's think about the steps for one secondary.

Each poll from primary is 32 bytes. The secondary's response could be either a data frame plus an ACK, or if it's done, maybe an ACK. Wait, no—when the secondary has data, it sends the data frame, and then the primary sends an ACK. Or wait, maybe after each poll, if the secondary sends data, the primary sends an ACK. Or perhaps it's the other way around?

Wait, maybe the process is: primary sends a poll (32 bytes) to a secondary. If the secondary has data, it sends a data frame (1000 bytes). Then the primary sends an ACK (32 bytes) to acknowledge. So for each data frame sent, the exchange is poll (32) + data (1000) + ACK (32) = 1064 bytes per data frame.

But wait, what if the secondary has no more data to send? Then it would respond with an ACK or NAK? Or maybe the primary sends a poll, and if the secondary has no data, it just sends an ACK? Or maybe the secondary sends a NAK if it has no data. Hmm, the question says that each station has five frames to send, so I think the primary needs to poll each secondary five times to get all their data.

Wait, but each station can send only one frame per poll. So for each of the four secondaries, the primary must send a poll each time until all five frames are sent. So for each secondary, there are five poll cycles.

So for each secondary:

Each poll cycle involves:
- Primary sends a poll (32 bytes)
- Secondary sends a data frame (1000 bytes)
- Primary sends an ACK (32 bytes)
So per data frame, that's 32 + 1000 +32 = 1064 bytes.

Since each secondary has five frames, that's 5 * 1064 bytes per secondary. But wait, does the primary have to poll each secondary one by one each time? So for all four secondaries, does the primary have to go through each in each cycle until all are done?

Wait, maybe the approach is that the primary polls each secondary in turn. So for each frame that each secondary sends, it's three steps: poll, data, ACK. So for four secondaries each sending five frames, that's 4 *5 =20 data frames. Each data frame requires 1064 bytes as per the steps above. So 20 *1064 = 21,280 bytes.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For each data frame, the poll is 32, data is 1000, ACK is 32. So each data frame exchange is 1064 bytes. So for 20 data frames, that's 20 *1064 = 21,280.

But wait, perhaps the primary sends a poll to a secondary, and if the secondary has data, the secondary sends it, and the primary ACKs. Then the primary moves to the next secondary and repeats this until all secondaries have sent all their data. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe each secondary requires a poll each time, so for each of the 5 frames, each of the 4 secondaries are being polled once. So the total number of poll messages is 4 secondaries *5 frames =20 polls, each 32 bytes. So 20 *32 =640 bytes.

Each data frame is 1000 bytes, 20 data frames =>20,000 bytes.

Each ACK is 32 bytes, 20 ACKs =>640 bytes.

So total bytes would be 640 (polls) +20,000 (data) +640 (ACKs) =21,280 bytes.

But looking at the options, I don't see 21,280. The options are A:19536, B:20000, C:20500, D:22000, E:23000, F:24000, G:25000, H:26000, I:21536, J:18000.

Hmm, 21,280 isn't among them. Did I make a mistake?

Wait another approach: perhaps the primary sends a poll to each of the four secondaries each time, regardless of whether they have data. But that doesn't seem right because each secondary has five frames to send, so each would need to be polled five times.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The question says each station can send only one frame in response to a poll. So for each poll, a secondary can send a maximum of one data frame. So for each secondary to send five data frames, the primary must send five polls to that secondary.

But since there are four secondaries, does the primary need to send a poll to each of them each time? So that perhaps, each cycle consists of four polls (one to each secondary), and each secondary can respond once per cycle. So for each cycle, each secondary can send a frame if they have any left.

But in that case, each cycle would involve four polls (one per secondary) and four possible data frames (if each has data to send). But that's not the case here, because each secondary has five frames, so it would take five cycles to drain all four secondaries.

Wait, let me think again. Let's imagine the primary sends a poll to each secondary in each cycle.

But wait, perhaps the primary sends a poll to each secondary in sequence, not in parallel. So each time a secondary is polled, it can send one frame. So for one secondary to send five frames, the primary has to poll it five times.

Since there are four secondaries, each needing five polls, that's 5*4=20 polls. Each poll is 32 bytes. So 20 *32 =640 bytes.

Each time a poll is sent and a data frame is sent, that's 1000 bytes. So 20 data frames →20 *1000 =20,000 bytes.

Each data frame transmission is followed by an ACK, so 20 ACKs →20 *32=640 bytes.

Total bytes: 640 +20,000 +640=21,280.

But wait, the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the ACK is sent by the secondary, not the primary. Wait, the question says the poll, ACK, NAK are 32 bytes each. So perhaps the data transmission goes like this: primary sends a poll (32 bytes), secondary responds with data (1000) if it has any, and then the primary sends an ACK (32). So that's three messages per data frame.

So for each data frame, it's 32 +1000 +32 =1064 bytes.

For 20 data frames: 20 *1064 =21,280.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the primary sends a single poll, and each secondary can respond, but that's not standard polling. Oh, but the question says each station can send only one frame in response to a poll. So perhaps in each poll, each secondary can send one frame. No, that's not how it works. Normally, the primary sends a poll to a secondary, and only that secondary responds.

Wait, perhaps the primary sends a poll to each secondary in a round-robin fashion. So each poll is to one secondary, and that secondary can send one frame in response. So for each secondary to send 5 frames, the primary has to send 5 polls to that secondary. Since there are four secondaries, the total number of polls is 4 *5=20. Each poll is 32 bytes. Data frames: 20 *1000 =20,000. ACKs: 20 *32 =640. So total is 20*(32+1000+32) =20*1064=21,280. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps for each poll, the primary sends one poll, and the secondary responds with data if it has any. So for each secondary, the primary sends five polls, each time getting a data frame. So each secondary's five data frames would require 5 poll-response (data) pairs, plus 5 ACKs.

Wait, but perhaps the ACK is part of the data transmission and not an additional frame. Or perhaps I'm overcounting.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

Primary sends a poll (32) to secondary. If secondary has data, it sends data (1000). Primary then sends an ACK (32). So per data frame, 32 +1000 +32 =1064 bytes.

So for each secondary with five data frames, that's 5 *1064 bytes.

For four secondaries: 4 *5 *1064 = 20 *1064=21,280.

Again, same result.

Looking at the options, the closest higher is option H:26000, but that's way higher. Wait wait, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the question says the size of a data frame is 1000 bytes. Does that include any headers, or is that the payload? Because sometimes in networking, frames include headers, but perhaps in this case, the data frame is just the payload? Or perhaps the 1000 bytes is the entire frame, including headers.

Wait, the question says "size of a data frame is 1000 bytes." So I think that's the entire frame. So no additional bytes beyond that.

Wait, perhaps the poll is sent to all secondaries at once, but that doesn't make sense. Polling is usually one at a time.

Another angle: each time the primary sends a poll, it's to a single secondary. So each data frame requires a poll and an ACK. So for each of the 4 secondaries, 5 data frames, that's 20 data frames. Each data frame requires a poll (32), data (1000), and ACK (32). So 20 * (32 +1000 +32) = 20*1064=21,280 bytes.

Hmm, none of the options match 21,280. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the ACKs. Maybe the ACK is sent only once per data frame, but perhaps for multiple data frames, the primary can send a single cumulative ACK. Or perhaps the ACK is not needed each time, but that's not standard in polling.

Wait, maybe the primary sends a poll (32) to a secondary, which responds with data (1000). Then the primary sends an ACK (32). So each exchange is 32+1000+32=1064 bytes per data frame. So for 20 data frames, it's 20*1064=21,280.

But again, not matching any option. So I must have a misunderstanding.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says each station can send only one frame in response to a poll. So for each poll, a secondary can send one data frame. So for each data frame, the exchange is poll (32) from primary, data (1000) from secondary, and perhaps ACK from primary (32). So 1064 per data frame.

20 data frames: 20*1064=21,280. But the options don't have this.

Wait the options include 21536 (option I) and 20500 (option C). Let's see: 20,536 is 21536. How?

Wait 21536 is 5*4=20 stations? No. Alternatively, maybe I've miscounted. Maybe the number of frames is different.

Wait, each secondary has 5 frames to send. So for each secondary, the primary sends 5 polls, each getting a data frame. So for each secondary, it's 5*(32 +1000 +32) =5 *1064 =5320 bytes per secondary. 4 secondaries:4 *5320=21280. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps after the data frame, the primary sends an ACK, but that's 32 bytes. So that's accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the initial question includes the primary's own ACKs, but I'm not missing any other frames. Wait, perhaps NAKs are not being sent here because all secondaries have data to send. So all responses are data frames, so NAKs don't come into play.

But then why is the option 21536 present? Let's see 21536 is 5320 *4=21280 → wait, 5320 *4 is 21280, which is not matching 21536.

Alternatively, maybe each station (including the primary) sends something else. Wait, no, the primary is only sending polls and ACKs.

Wait perhaps I should consider that each time the primary sends a poll, whether or not the secondary has data, it sends a response. If the secondary has no data, it sends a NAK, but in this case, all secondaries have data to send, so all responses are data frames.

So NAKs are not being sent here.

Wait another approach: perhaps the primary sends a poll, gets a data frame, and sends an ACK. So for each data frame, 32 (poll) +1000 (data) +32 (ACK) =1064.

For 20 data frames:20 *1064=21,280. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the data frame is 1000 bytes payload, and the frame itself includes headers. But the question says data frame is 1000 bytes, so including headers, I think.

Wait maybe I should think about this differently. Let's calculate all the frames:

Polls: Each secondary requires 5 polls. 4 secondaries →4 *5=20 polls. Each poll is 32 bytes →20 *32=640 bytes.

Data frames:4 *5=20 frames →20 *1000=20,000 bytes.

ACKs:20 ACKs →20 *32=640 bytes.

Total:640 +20,000 +640 =21,280 bytes.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the primary sends a single poll to all secondaries, but that's not possible. Or perhaps the primary uses a single poll for all secondaries, and each responds, but that would cause collisions. So that's not correct.

Wait, maybe for each data frame, the primary sends a poll, and then the secondary sends data. Maybe the ACK is sent as part of the data frame, so not an extra frame. But that would mean per data frame, it's 32 (poll) +1000 (data) =1032 bytes. Then for 20 data frames, 20 *1032=20,640 bytes. Plus any ACKs?

But the question lists ACK and NAK as separate frames. So I think the ACK is a separate frame.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that the ACK is sent only once after all data frames are sent. But that doesn't make sense because ACKs are per frame usually.

Alternatively, perhaps the primary sends a single ACK after all the data has been received. No, that doesn't fit the polling mechanism.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look for an option that's near 21,280. The options don't have that. But let's see what the options are:

Option I is 21536, which is 21,536. So that's 256 more than 21,280.

Wait 21,536−21,280=256. 256 is 8 *32. Hmm, maybe I've miscounted the number of ACKs or polls.

Wait, perhaps each secondary, after sending all their data, sends a final ACK or something. Or perhaps there's an initial connection frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the primary sends a poll to each secondary, and each time the secondary responds, it's either a data frame (1000) or an ACK (32). So for each secondary, after sending five data frames, the next poll would get an ACK, but since each station has exactly five frames, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the primary sends a poll, the secondary sends data, and the primary ACKs. Then for each secondary, the process is: poll → data → ACK, five times. So 5 polls, 5 data frames, 5 ACKs. Per secondary, that's 5*(32+1000+32) =5*1064=5320. Four secondaries:4 *5320=21,280.

But the option I is 21,536, which is 256 bytes more. Hmm, 256 is 8 *32. So maybe there are 8 more frames.

Wait, perhaps after all data is sent, the primary sends a final ACK to each secondary. So for four secondaries, that would be four ACKs, each 32 bytes. So 4 *32=128. So total would be 21,280 +128=21,408. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the poll is sent to all secondaries each time, but that's not how polling works.

Alternatively, perhaps the primary sends a poll, and if the secondary has data, it sends data; otherwise, it sends a NAK. But in this case, the secondaries have exactly five frames, so each poll to a secondary with remaining frames will result in a data frame. So no NAKs are sent. So NAKs are not involved here.

Wait, maybe the primary sends a poll to all four secondaries each time. So each cycle consists of four polls. Each secondary can send one frame per cycle. So to send five frames, each secondary would need five cycles. So total cycles:5.

Each cycle: primary sends four polls (4*32=128 bytes). Each secondary sends one data frame (1000 bytes), four data frames per cycle (4*1000=4000 bytes). Then the primary sends four ACKs (4*32=128 bytes). So per cycle:128 +4000 +128=4156 bytes.

After five cycles:5 *4156=20,780 bytes.

Wait, but this would mean that all four secondaries send a data frame each cycle, requiring five cycles. So total data frames:4 *5=20, which matches.
