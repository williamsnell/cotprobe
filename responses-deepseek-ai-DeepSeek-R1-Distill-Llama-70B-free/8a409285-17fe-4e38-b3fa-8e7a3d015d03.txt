Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says: A single-electron atom has the electron in the l = 2 state. The number of allowed values of the quantum number m_l is... and then there are multiple choices.

Alright, I remember from my chemistry class that quantum numbers are important in describing the orbitals. Quantum numbers include n, l, m_l, and s. Oh wait, right, for each electron, these numbers determine its state.

So the question is about m_l. I think m_l is the magnetic quantum number. The value of m_l determines the orientation of the orbital in space. Like, for each l value, there are different m_l's possible.

Wait, what's the rule again? Oh right, for a given l, the m_l can take on integer values from -l to +l, including zero. So the number of possible m_l values is 2l + 1. Because if l is 0, m_l can only be 0. If l is 1, m_l can be -1, 0, +1, so three values, which is 2*1 +1 =3. Oh yeah, that makes sense.

So in this problem, l is given as 2. Let me calculate. So 2l +1 would be 2*2 +1 =5. That means m_l can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. So that's five possible values.

Looking at the options, option B is 5. So the answer must be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the letters. The options are A to J, right? So option B is 5. Yep, that's correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. I mean, sometimes I get confused between n and l, but no, the question clearly states l=2. So m_l ranges from -2 to +2, inclusive. That's five values.

The magnetic quantum number \( m_l \) determines the orientation of an orbital in space and can take integer values ranging from \(-l\) to \(+l\), inclusive. For a given \( l \), the number of possible \( m_l \) values is \( 2l + 1 \). In this case, the electron is in the \( l = 2 \) state, so \( m_l \) can be \(-2, -1, 0, +1, +2\), which corresponds to 5 possible values. 

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: 5**.
