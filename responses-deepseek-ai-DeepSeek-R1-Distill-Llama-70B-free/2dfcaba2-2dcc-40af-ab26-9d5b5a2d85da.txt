Okay, so I've got this problem with three nuclear reactions, and I need to find out what X is in each case. I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's see if I can figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that in nuclear reactions, the total mass number (A) and the atomic number (Z) must be conserved on both sides of the reaction. That means the sum of the mass numbers on the left should equal the sum on the right, and the same goes for the atomic numbers.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): ¹H + ⁹Be → X + n.

So, let's break down the numbers. The hydrogen is ¹H, so its mass number is 1, and its atomic number is 1 (since hydrogen has one proton). Beryllium-9 has a mass number of 9 and an atomic number of 4 (beryllium is Be, which is element 4).

On the right side, we have X and a neutron (n). A neutron has a mass number of 1 and no charge, so its atomic number is 0.

So, for mass numbers: 1 (H) + 9 (Be) = 10. On the right, X plus neutron (1) should sum to 10. So X must have a mass number of 10 - 1 = 9.

For atomic numbers: 1 (H) + 4 (Be) = 5. The neutron contributes 0, so X must have an atomic number of 5.

Wait, what element has atomic number 5? Oh right, that's boron (B). So X should be ⁹B, which is option D.

Wait, let me double-check. Boron-9 has a mass number of 9 and atomic number 5. Yeah, that fits.

Moving on to part (b): ¹²C + ¹H → X.

Carbon-12 has mass number 12 and atomic number 6. Hydrogen is again 1 and 1.

Sum of mass numbers on the left: 12 + 1 = 13. So X must have a mass number of 13.

Atomic numbers: 6 (C) + 1 (H) = 7. So X must have atomic number 7, which is nitrogen (N). So X is ¹³N.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see ¹³N. The options are A: ¹⁴N, B: ¹¹B, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction. Let me think again.

Wait, in part (b), the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X. So, the products are only X, nothing else. So mass number of X is 12 + 1 = 13. Atomic number is 6 + 1 =7. So X is ¹³N, which isn't one of the options. Wait, the options given are from A to J, and I'm looking at the provided options: A is ¹⁴N, B is ¹¹B, etc. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I copied the problem correctly. Oh wait, the question says part (b) is ¹²C + ¹H → X. So if X is ¹³N, but that's not among the options. Did I get the wrong element?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let's see: Carbon is 6, hydrogen 1. So 6+1=7. So element 7 is nitrogen, mass 13. So ¹³N. But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a fusion or something else. Wait, maybe the neutron is involved? No, the reaction in (b) doesn't have a neutron. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the atomic numbers. Let me double-check.

Carbon is element 6, correct. Hydrogen is 1. So sum is 7. Nitrogen is 7. So X is ¹³N. But in the options, the closest is option A: ¹⁴N. That's mass 14, which would require the sum being 14. But 12+1 is 13, so that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, looking back, the question says: for part (b) ¹²C + ¹H → X. So yeah, 12+1=13. So unless X is ¹³N, which isn't in the options. But looking at the options provided, let me check again:

Options:

A: ¹⁴N

B: ¹¹B

C: ⁸B

D: ⁹B

E: ¹⁶O

F: ¹⁰B

G: ⁶Li

H: ⁷Li

Hmm, none of these is ¹³N. So maybe I did something wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. Wait, maybe I should consider that sometimes in reactions, especially when a proton is involved, it's a proton emission or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a neutron, but no, part (b) doesn't have a neutron in the products.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X. So the possible products could involve other particles, but in this case, it's just X. So perhaps X is ¹³N, but that's not an option. Therefore, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the reaction is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another possibility.

Wait, maybe I should check for typos. Let me check the original problem again. Oh wait, wait, the user wrote part (b) as ¹²C + ¹H → X. So unless I'm missing a particle, but no, that's all.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a neutron-producing reaction, but no, there's no neutron on the right. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decay process, but that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. Let's see, maybe X is ¹³C, but that's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's ¹³O, but that's also not an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the atomic number. Let me think again: Carbon is 6, hydrogen is 1. So 6+1=7. So if X has atomic number 7, which is nitrogen, so mass number should be 13. So X is ¹³N. But it's not in the options, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should look at part (c) and see if any options are used there, maybe that can help.

Part (c): ¹⁵N + ¹H → ⁴He + X.

Nitrogen-15 has mass 15, atomic number 7. Hydrogen is 1, atomic 1. So sum of mass numbers: 15+1=16. On the right, ⁴He (mass 4) plus X. So X's mass is 16-4=12.

Atomic numbers: 7 +1 =8. He has atomic number 2, so X must have 8-2=6. Element 6 is carbon, so X is ¹²C.

Looking at the options, ¹²C isn't listed, but wait, the options are only for X in each part. So for part (c), X is ¹²C, which isn't an option here, but the options are A-J as given.

Wait, but part (a) was X as ⁹B, which is option D. Part (b), if X is ¹³N, which isn't an option. So maybe part (b) is not possible, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought. Let me look at the options again. Option B is ¹¹B, which is boron-11. But for part (b), the mass should be 13. So that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible reactions again. Alternatively, maybe the reaction in part (b) is a different type. For example, maybe the hydrogen is being absorbed, but perhaps a neutron is released? But the problem doesn't show a neutron in part (b). So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps in part (b), the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X, which could be ¹³N, but since that's not an option, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is ¹²C capturing a proton to become ¹³N, but again, that's not an option. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X + something else. But the problem says it's just X as a product. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps this is a typo, and I should proceed, considering that part (a) is D, part (c) is ¹²C, but that's not an option either. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ¹¹B, which is boron-11. Let me see if that makes sense for part (b). For part (b), if X is ¹¹B, then mass numbers would be 12+1=13, but X is 11, so that's not matching. So that can't be right. So perhaps part (b) isn't among the options, but that's not possible because the question expects us to choose from the given options.

Wait, maybe I should check if I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Part (b): ¹²C (mass 12) + ¹H (mass 1) → X.

So mass of X is 13. Atomic number: 6 (C) +1 (H) =7. So X is ¹³N, which is nitrogen-13. But that's not in the options. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X + n? But no, that's not what the problem states. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Maybe I should consider that perhaps part (b) is a typo and the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering that Hydrogen can be a different isotope. But no, it's ¹H, which is just a proton.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the other parts and see if any of the options fit, and then see if that helps with part (b).

Part (c): X is ¹²C, which isn't an option, but wait, looking at the options, option F is ¹⁰B, which is 10 mass, 5 protons. That doesn't fit. Option E is ¹⁶O, which would be mass 16, but in part (c), X is 12. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem may have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps for part (b), the reaction is actually ¹²C + ¹H → X, and X is ¹³N, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should reconsider. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a different element, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses atomic numbers differently. Let me check the periodic table again. Carbon is 6, hydrogen is 1. Sum is 7. So X must be nitrogen, atomic number 7, mass 13. So I'm confident in that.

But since ¹³N isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for all three parts together, but that's unclear.

Wait, looking back, the question says "Identify X in the following nuclear reactions (a), (b), (c)", and each part is a separate reaction. So the options must correspond to each part. So perhaps each part's X is among the options. So I must have made a mistake in part (b).

Wait, perhaps I should approach part (b) differently. Let me think about possible reactions where carbon-12 and a proton produce X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a neutron emission, but the problem doesn't show that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that maybe it's a different type of reaction, like a proton being absorbed, leading to a new nucleus. So ¹²C + ¹H → ¹³N. But again, that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm miscounting the atomic numbers. Let me check again. Carbon is Z=6, Hydrogen Z=1. Sum is 7. So X must have Z=7, which is nitrogen. So X is ¹³N, which is not among the options. So perhaps the reaction in part (b) is different. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to choose the closest option, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should check the possible options again. Here's the list:

A: ¹⁴N

B: ¹¹B

C: ⁸B

D: ⁹B

E: ¹⁶O

F: ¹⁰B

G: ⁶Li

H: ⁷Li

So none of these are ¹³N. So perhaps part (b) isn't among the options, but that can't be right. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in part (b), the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X, and X is ¹³C? No, because ¹³C would mean the atomic number is 6, but 6 +1 is 7, so X should have Z=7, which is nitrogen, not carbon. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a neutron emission. So if the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X + neutron, then the mass numbers would be 13 (12+1) = X +1 (neutron), so X would be 12. Atomic number would be 7. So X is ¹²N? But ¹²N is not stable, but perhaps that's the case. But ¹²N has a mass of 12 and Z=7, which would make it ¹²N, but that's not an option either. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to proceed. Since part (b) isn't matching any option, perhaps I should focus on the other parts and see if the options fit.

In part (a), I think X is ⁹B (option D). Part (c) gives X as ¹²C, which isn't an option, but perhaps I should check the given options again.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps in part (c), X is ¹²C, but that's not listed. So maybe the correct answers are D for (a), perhaps B for (b), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b). Let me try again. Maybe the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X. So mass is 13, Z=7. So X is ¹³N, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is actually a neutron being released, but it's not stated. So if ¹²C + ¹H → X + n, then X would have mass 12 (since 13-1=12) and Z=6 (since 7-0=7? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if a neutron is emitted, the atomic number would remain the same as before.

Wait, in that case, if ¹²C (Z=6) captures a proton (Z=1), the new nucleus would have Z=7, which is nitrogen. So X would be ¹³N, and a neutron is released. But the problem doesn't have a neutron in part (b), so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a different one. Wait, maybe it's ¹²C + ¹H → ¹²N + something else, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck on part (b). Let me try to think if any of the options could fit. Let's see option B is ¹¹B. So mass 11, Z=5. For part (b), if X were ¹¹B, then the mass on the left is 13 (12+1). So that doesn't add up. So no.

Option F is ¹⁰B (mass 10, Z=5). Again, 12+1=13, so that's not matching. So perhaps part (b) isn't among the options, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the possible reactions again. Another approach: let's look at each option and see if it fits any of the reactions.

Option D: ⁹B. That fits part (a), as we discussed. So for part (a), X is D.

Option B: ¹¹B. Let's see if it fits any part. For part (b), if X is ¹¹B, then the mass would be 11. But 12+1=13, so that's impossible. So no.

Option F: ¹⁰B. For part (b), X would be 10, but 12+1=13, so no.

Option A: ¹⁴N. If X is ¹⁴N, then mass would be 14. So in part (b), 12+1=13, which doesn't fit. So no.

Option E: ¹⁶O. Mass 16, but in part (b), 12+1=13, so no.

Options G and H are lithium isotopes, which have lower masses, so they don't fit part (b).

So perhaps part (b) is supposed to be ¹³N, but it's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in part (b).

Wait, perhaps the reaction is ¹²C + ¹H → X, and X is ¹³C. But that would require the atomic number to be 6, but 6 +1 =7, so that can't be. So that's not
