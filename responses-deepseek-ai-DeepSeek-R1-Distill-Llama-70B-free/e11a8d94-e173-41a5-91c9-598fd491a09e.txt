Okay, so I have this math problem here about an invoice amount and a cash discount. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that $416.50 was the payment made in full after taking a cash discount of $8.50. I need to find out the original amount of the invoice before the discount was applied.

Wait, cash discounts usually mean that the customer paid a certain percentage less than the invoice amount. So when a business offers a cash discount, they're giving the customer a percentage off if they pay within a certain time. For example, maybe something like 2% off if paid within 10 days.

So the way this works is that the payment made is the invoice amount minus the cash discount. Oh wait, no, actually, the cash discount is calculated as a percentage of the invoice, so the payment is the invoice minus the discount.

Wait, I think the formula is something like: Payment = Invoice Amount - (Invoice Amount × Discount Rate). But in this problem, we're given the payment and the discount amount, not the rate. So maybe I can rearrange that formula.

Let me think: If the payment is $416.50 and that's after a discount of $8.50, then the original invoice must have been higher than $416.50 by that $8.50, right? Because the discount is subtracted from the invoice to get the payment.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the discount is a percentage of the invoice. So the payment is the invoice minus the discount. So the discount is a portion of the invoice. So if I call the invoice amount as "I", then the payment is I minus (I × discount rate). But in this case, I don't know the discount rate; I know the discount amount is $8.50.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler than that. If the payment is $416.50 after taking an $8.50 discount, then maybe the original invoice was $416.50 plus $8.50. Because the discount is subtracted to get the payment. So I = Payment + Discount. That would make I = 416.50 + 8.50 = $425.00. So looking at the options, option A is $425.00. That seems straightforward.

But wait, maybe I should double-check that logic. If the invoice was $425, and you take a discount of $8.50, then the payment is 425 - 8.50 = 416.50, which matches the info given. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the discount rate. Suppose the discount is a percentage, say 'd'. Then, the payment is I*(1 - d) = 416.50. And the discount amount is I*d = 8.50. So I can write I = 8.50 / d. But I don't know 'd', but I can express one equation in terms of another.

Wait, substituting. Since I*(1 - d) = 416.50 and I*d =8.50, then I = 8.50 / d. Substitute into the first equation: (8.50/d)*(1 - d) = 416.50. That would be 8.50*(1 - d)/d = 416.50.

Hmm, this seems a bit more complicated, but maybe I can solve for 'd'. Let's see:

8.50*(1 - d) = 416.50 * d

Expanding: 8.50 - 8.50d = 416.50d

Combine like terms: 8.50 = 416.50d + 8.50d → 8.50 = 425d

So d = 8.50 / 425 = 0.02. So the discount rate is 2%.

Then, the invoice amount I is 8.50 / d = 8.50 / 0.02 = 425. So same answer, $425.00.

So yes, the original invoice was $425.00, which is option A.
</think>

To determine the original invoice amount, we know that $416.50 was the payment made after a cash discount of $8.50 was applied. The relationship between the invoice amount ($I$), the payment, and the discount can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Payment} = I - \text{Discount}
\]

Here, the payment is $416.50, and the discount is $8.50. Rearranging the formula:

\[
I = \text{Payment} + \text{Discount}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
I = 416.50 + 8.50 = 425.00
\]

Thus, the original invoice amount was **$425.00**. This matches option A.

To verify, if the invoice was $425.00 and a $8.50 discount was applied, the payment would indeed be:

\[
425.00 - 8.50 = 416.50
\]

This confirms the calculation is correct.
