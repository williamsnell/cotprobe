Question:

Large deficits of water can be only partly compensated for by renal conservation; drinking is the ultimate compensatory mechanism. What stimulates the subjective feeling of thirst which drives one to drink water?

Options:

A: Decreased blood sodium levels
B: Low plasma osmolarity
C: Low body temperature
D: High blood pressure
E: Low levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
F: A high intracellular fluid volume
G: A low extracellular fluid volume and a high plasma osmolarity
H: High extracellular fluid volume
I: Increased saliva production
J: High glucose levels in the blood

Okay, so I have this question about what stimulates the feeling of thirst. Hmm, I remember that thirst is related to the body's need to maintain water balance. Let me think.

The question says that when there's a large water deficit, the kidneys can only partly compensate, so drinking water is the main way to fix it. And the trigger for drinking is the feeling of thirst. So what causes that feeling?

I recall that the regulation of water in the body involves hormones like ADH (antidiuretic hormone) and the renin-angiotensin system. ADH helps the kidneys reabsorb more water when the body is dehydrated. But what about the actual sensation of thirst?

Thirst is triggered by changes in the body's osmotic pressure, I think. Osmotic pressure is related to the concentration of solutes in the blood. When blood osmolarity increases, that means the blood is getting more concentrated, which usually happens when there's not enough water. So the body needs to retain water and also signal to drink more.

So the factors involved would be high plasma osmolarity and low extracellular fluid volume. Wait, because when you lose water, your blood volume (extracellular fluid) decreases. So both the concentration of the blood (high osmolarity) and the low blood volume would be factors.

Looking at the options, option G says "A low extracellular fluid volume and a high plasma osmolarity." That sounds right. Let me check the other options.

Option A: Decreased blood sodium. Wait, low sodium would mean low osmolarity, which would decrease thirst. So that's not it.

Option B: Low plasma osmolarity. That would mean the blood is less concentrated, so you wouldn't feel thirsty. So B is the opposite.

Option C: Low body temp. Don't think that's directly related to thirst. Maybe more related to shivering.

Option D: High blood pressure. High BP can lead to increased urine production, but I don't think it directly causes thirst.

Option E: Low levels of ADH. ADH makes the kidneys retain water. Low ADH would lead to more urine, but if ADH is low, the body might be trying to conserve, but I don't think it's the direct cause of thirst.

Option F: High intracellular fluid. Hmm. If cells have a lot of fluid, maybe that's when the body is hydrated. I'm not sure, but I don't think that's the trigger for thirst.

Option G: As I thought, low extracellular and high osmolarity. That's when the blood is concentrated and volume is low, so the body needs more water.

Option H: High extracellular volume. That would mean excess fluid, so you wouldn't feel thirsty. So not H.

Option I: Increased saliva. I don't think so. More saliva might mean you can digest food, but not directly related to thirst.

Option J: High blood glucose. High blood sugar can cause more urine (like in diabetes), but the direct trigger for thirst is the dehydration from that, not the glucose itself. So maybe this is a secondary effect but not the main cause.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: a low extracellular fluid volume and a high plasma osmolarity.

Thirst is the body's response to dehydration and is primarily triggered by two factors: a decrease in extracellular fluid volume and an increase in plasma osmolarity. When the body loses water, the concentration of solutes in the blood (osmolarity) rises, and the volume of extracellular fluid decreases. These changes are detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which then stimulate the sensation of thirst to promote water intake and restore fluid balance.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Decreased blood sodium levels would lower osmolarity, reducing thirst.
- **B**: Low plasma osmolarity indicates diluted blood, which does not trigger thirst.
- **C**: Low body temperature is unrelated to thirst regulation.
- **D**: High blood pressure can lead to increased urine production but does not directly cause thirst.
- **E**: Low ADH levels result in increased urine production, but ADH itself does not directly stimulate thirst.
- **F**: High intracellular fluid volume suggests proper hydration, not thirst.
- **G**: Low extracellular fluid volume and high plasma osmolarity are the primary triggers for thirst.
- **H**: High extracellular fluid volume indicates excess fluid, so thirst is not stimulated.
- **I**: Increased saliva production is unrelated to thirst.
- **J**: High blood glucose can lead to dehydration, but thirst is triggered by the resulting dehydration, not the glucose itself.

The correct answer is **G**, as it accurately reflects the physiological conditions that stimulate thirst.
