Question:

The pressure in an automobile tire is measured by a tire gauge in winter at 0°C as 30 pounds per square inch (psi). The gauge measures the difference between the actual tire pressure and atmospheric pressure (15 psi). Assume that the tire does not leak air and does not change its volume. What will be the new gauge pressure if the same tire is measured during the summer at 50°C?

Options:

A: 34 psi
B: 32 psi
C: 40 psi
D: 35 psi
E: 44 psi
F: 36 psi
G: 45 psi
H: 38 psi
I: 48 psi
J: 42 psi

Okay, so I've got this problem about tire pressure changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember that pressure and temperature are related somehow, probably through the ideal gas law. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that in winter, the tire gauge reads 30 psi at 0°C. Oh wait, wait, the gauge measures the difference between the actual tire pressure and atmospheric pressure. Oh right, because atmospheric pressure is around 15 psi. So the actual pressure inside the tire in winter must be higher than that. So actual pressure P_winter = gauge pressure + atmospheric pressure. That would be 30 psi + 15 psi = 45 psi.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the gauge measures the pressure above atmospheric. So yes, the absolute pressure is 30 psi above atmospheric, which is 15 psi. So absolute pressure in winter is 30 + 15 = 45 psi. Got it.

Now, when the temperature increases to summer, 50°C. The tire doesn't leak, so the amount of air (moles) is constant. Also, the volume of the tire doesn't change. So it's a constant volume situation. That makes me think of Gay-Lussac's Law, which is P1/T1 = P2/T2, where pressure and temperature are directly proportional when volume is constant.

Wait, but temperature has to be in Kelvin for these calculations. So I need to convert the temperatures.

Winter temperature is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. Summer is 50°C, which is 323.15 K.

So the initial pressure P1 is 45 psi (absolute), T1 is 273.15 K. The final pressure P2 is what we're looking for, T2 is 323.15 K.

Applying Gay-Lussac's Law: P1/T1 = P2/T2 → P2 = P1 * (T2/T1)

Plugging in the numbers: P2 = 45 psi * (323.15 / 273.15)

Let me calculate that. 323.15 divided by 273.15 is approximately... Let's see, 273 is 0°C, 323 is 50°C. So 323/273 ≈ 1.183.

So P2 ≈ 45 * 1.183 ≈ let's see, 45 * 1.18 is 45*(1 + 0.18) = 45 + 8.1 = 53.1. Hmm wait, 45 * 1.183 → 45 * 1 is 45, 45 * 0.183 is about 8.235. So total about 53.235 psi.

Wait, that's the absolute pressure. But the gauge measures the pressure above atmospheric (15 psi). So the gauge pressure in summer would be P2_absolute - atmospheric pressure.

So 53.235 psi - 15 psi = 38.235 psi. So approximately 38.24 psi.

Looking at the options, option H is 38 psi. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

P1 = 45 psi, T1 = 273.15 K, T2=323.15 K.

P2 = 45 * (323.15/273.15) = 45 * (approx 1.1833) → 45 * 1.1833 is indeed approximately 53.25 psi.

Absolute pressure is 53.25 psi. Subtract atmospheric 15 psi gives 38.25, which rounds to 38 psi. So yes, option H.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the tire gauge measures the pressure difference between the actual tire pressure and atmospheric pressure. In winter, the gauge reads 30 psi, and atmospheric pressure is 15 psi. Therefore, the absolute pressure in the tire during winter is:

\[
P_{\text{winter}} = 30 \, \text{psi} + 15 \, \text{psi} = 45 \, \text{psi}.
\]

The problem specifies that the tire does not leak air and does not change its volume. This means the number of moles of air remains constant, and we can apply Gay-Lussac's Law, which states:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2},
\]

where \(P_1\) and \(T_1\) are the initial pressure and temperature, and \(P_2\) and \(T_2\) are the final pressure and temperature. Since temperature must be in Kelvin, we convert the given temperatures:

\[
T_{\text{winter}} = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{\text{summer}} = 50^\circ \text{C} = 323.15 \, \text{K}.
\]

Using Gay-Lussac's Law:

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_2 = 45 \cdot \frac{323.15}{273.15}.
\]

Calculating the ratio:

\[
\frac{323.15}{273.15} \approx 1.183.
\]

Thus:

\[
P_2 = 45 \cdot 1.183 \approx 53.235 \, \text{psi}.
\]

This is the absolute pressure inside the tire during summer. The gauge pressure is the difference between the absolute pressure and atmospheric pressure:

\[
\text{Gauge pressure} = P_2 - 15 \, \text{psi} = 53.235 \, \text{psi} - 15 \, \text{psi} \approx 38.235 \, \text{psi}.
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the gauge pressure is approximately 38 psi. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**H: 38 psi.**
