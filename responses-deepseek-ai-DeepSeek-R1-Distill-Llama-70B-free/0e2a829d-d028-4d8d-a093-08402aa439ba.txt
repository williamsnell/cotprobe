Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability problem. Let me read it again. Juan is rolling an 8-sided die, numbered 1 through 8. Then Amal rolls a regular 6-sided die. I need to find the probability that the product of their two rolls is a multiple of 3. Hmm, okay.

Wait, so the product being a multiple of 3 means that at least one of the numbers rolled must be a multiple of 3. Because if either Juan's number or Amal's number is divisible by 3, then their product will be too. Right, because 3 times anything is a multiple of 3.

So maybe the approach here is to find the probability that the product is a multiple of 3. Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement probability—like the probability that the product is NOT a multiple of 3—and subtract that from 1. That might be simpler because if neither die shows a multiple of 3, then their product won't be either.

Let me think about that. So the complement event is that neither die is a multiple of 3. If I can find the probability of that, then 1 minus that will be the answer.

First, let's find the probability that Juan's roll is not a multiple of 3. His die is 8-sided. The numbers are 1-8. How many multiples of 3 are there between 1 and 8? Let's see: 3, 6. So that's two numbers. So the number of non-multiples of 3 would be 8 - 2 = 6. So the probability that Juan doesn't roll a 3 or 6 is 6/8, which simplifies to 3/4.

Next, Amal's die is 6-sided, numbers 1-6. Multiples of 3 here are 3 and 6, so two numbers. So the number of non-multiples is 6 - 2 = 4. So the probability that Amal doesn't roll a 3 or 6 is 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3.

Since the two events are independent, the probability that both happen (neither rolls a multiple of 3) is the product of their individual probabilities. So that's (3/4) * (2/3) = (3*2)/(4*3) = 6/12 = 1/2.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me check that multiplication. 3/4 times 2/3. The 3s cancel out, leaving 2/4, which is 1/2. Yeah, that's correct.

So the probability that neither die is a multiple of 3 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that at least one is a multiple of 3 is 1 minus 1/2, which is 1/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because sometimes when events are independent, you think you can just multiply, but maybe I missed something.

Let me double-check the numbers. For Juan's die: numbers 1-8. Multiples of 3 are 3 and 6. So 2 out of 8, which is 1/4 chance to roll a 3 or 6. So the chance he doesn't is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. That's correct.

Amal's die: numbers 1-6. Multiples of 3 are 3 and 6, so 2 out of 6, which is 1/3. So the chance she doesn't roll a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. Correct.

So the probability that neither rolls a multiple of 3 is 3/4 * 2/3 = (3*2)/(4*3) = 6/12 = 1/2. So the complement is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Wait, but let me think again. Because sometimes when you're dealing with products, especially with more factors, you have to make sure that it's not possible for both to contribute. But in this case, since we're looking for any factor of 3, as long as at least one die has a 3, the product will have it. So the approach is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it directly. The product is a multiple of 3 if Juan's number is a multiple of 3, or Amal's is, or both. So the probability would be P(Juan's is multiple of 3) + P(Amal's is multiple of 3) - P(both are multiples of 3).

Let me calculate that way to cross-verify. So P(Juan) is 2/8 = 1/4. P(Amal) is 2/6 = 1/3. The P(both) is P(Juan) * P(Amal) since the rolls are independent. So that's (1/4)*(1/3) = 1/12.

So the total probability would be 1/4 + 1/3 - 1/12. Let's compute that. 1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so 3/12 + 4/12 = 7/12. Then subtract 1/12 gives 6/12, which is 1/2. So same answer as before. So that's correct.

So the probability is 1/2. Looking at the options, option H is 1/2, so the answer should be H.

To determine the probability that the product of Juan's and Amal's rolls is a multiple of 3, we can use the complement rule. The product will not be a multiple of 3 only if neither roll is a multiple of 3. 

1. **Probability that Juan's roll is not a multiple of 3**:  
   Juan rolls an 8-sided die. The multiples of 3 on this die are 3 and 6, so there are 2 multiples of 3. The probability of not rolling a multiple of 3 is:  
   \[
   P(\text{not a multiple of 3}) = \frac{8 - 2}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}.
   \]

2. **Probability that Amal's roll is not a multiple of 3**:  
   Amal rolls a 6-sided die. The multiples of 3 on this die are 3 and 6, so there are 2 multiples of 3. The probability of not rolling a multiple of 3 is:  
   \[
   P(\text{not a multiple of 3}) = \frac{6 - 2}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}.
   \]

3. **Probability that neither roll is a multiple of 3**:  
   Since the rolls are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities:  
   \[
   P(\text{neither is a multiple of 3}) = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

4. **Probability that the product is a multiple of 3**:  
   This is the complement of the above probability:  
   \[
   P(\text{product is a multiple of 3}) = 1 - P(\text{neither is a multiple of 3}) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

Thus, the probability that the product of the two rolls is a multiple of 3 is \(\frac{1}{2}\). The correct answer is:

**H: \(\frac{1}{2}\)**
