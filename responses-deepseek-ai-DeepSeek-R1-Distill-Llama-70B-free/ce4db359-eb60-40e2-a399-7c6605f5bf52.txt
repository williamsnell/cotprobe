Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about how mass communication affects the formation of our attitudes and beliefs. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking about the role of mass communication in shaping our attitudes and beliefs. I remember from my classes that mass communication includes things like television, radio, newspapers, and the internet. These media outlets spread information to a large audience, so they must have some influence.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it only affects political views. That doesn't seem right because I know mass communication influences a lot more than just politics. For example, advertising affects our purchasing decisions, which relates to our beliefs about products. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B suggests it's limited to educational content. Wait, but mass communication includes entertainment, news, ads, etc., not just educational stuff. So if someone only watches educational shows, maybe, but the question is about the general role. So B is too narrow and probably wrong.

Option C claims it reinforces existing opinions without new perspectives. That sounds like the selective exposure theory, where people choose content that aligns with what they already believe. But mass communication can also introduce new ideas, right? So I'm not sure if C is correct because it says it's only reinforcing, not introducing.

Option D says it's through humor and entertainment. While entertainment can influence attitudes, mass communication uses many methods, not just humor. So D is too limited.

Option E states that mass communication persuades subtly, often without us realizing. That rings a bell. I think this relates to theories like agenda-setting or cultivation theory, where media subtly influences what we consider important or shapes our perceptions over time without overt persuasion. So E sounds plausible.

Option F says it provides factual info without bias. That seems unlikely because media outlets often have biases, whether intentional or not. Plus, even factual info can be presented in a way that influences opinions. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G claims it's through direct and explicit messages. But I remember that a lot of media influence is implicit. Like, the way a story is framed can affect attitudes without directly telling you what to think. So G might not be the best choice.

Option H says it's only through news and current events. But mass communication includes ads, movies, social media, etc., all of which influence attitudes and beliefs beyond just news. So H is too narrow.

Option I says mass communication has no impact. That can't be right. There's a lot of research showing media does influence people, so I is incorrect.

Option J suggests it only affects purchasing decisions. Again, that's too narrow. Mass communication affects political views, social attitudes, cultural beliefs, etc., not just buying behavior. So J is wrong.

So, after evaluating all the options, E seems like the best fit. It captures the idea that mass communication influences us in subtle ways, shaping our attitudes and beliefs sometimes without us even noticing. That makes sense because media can set agendas, frame issues, and use persuasive techniques that aren't overtly obvious.

Mass communication plays a significant role in shaping our attitudes and beliefs through various subtle mechanisms. Among the given options, the most accurate is that it persuades us subtly, often without us realizing it. This aligns with theories like agenda-setting and cultivation, where media influences perceptions and beliefs over time through framing and implicit messages.

Answer: E
