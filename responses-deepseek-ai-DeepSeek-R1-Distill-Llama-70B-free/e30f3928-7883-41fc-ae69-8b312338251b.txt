Alright, let's tackle this question. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the enforcement of company privacy and how corporations are somewhat a certain way. The sentence has three blanks, each corresponding to a part of the options.

First, I need to understand the context. The first part says that companies are somewhat __________, and there are few clear barriers to define their limits. That makes me think about the word "boundaryless." Because if there are no clear barriers, they don't have defined boundaries. So the first blank is probably "boundaryless."

Moving on to the second part: it's difficult to _________ due to the number of individuals involved. The options suggest either "control information" or "maintain individual privacy." Hmm. If a company has many people, controlling information might be harder because more people are involved. So maybe it's "control information." But wait, the question is about company privacy, so perhaps it's about maintaining individual privacy within the company. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If the company is boundaryless, maybe it's about how they handle information. So perhaps it's "control information" because without boundaries, information spreads more easily, making control difficult.

Now the third part: much corporate activity takes place in ________. The options are "public spaces" or "private spaces." Corporate activities are usually in private spaces like offices, not public areas. So the third blank is "private spaces."

Putting it together, the options that fit are:

First blank: Boundaryless
Second blank: Control information
Third blank: Private spaces

Looking at the options, option D says: Boundaryless, Control information, Private spaces. That matches what I thought.

Wait, let me double-check. The second part is about the difficulty due to the number of individuals. If it's about controlling information because many people are involved, then yes, controlling becomes harder. So D makes sense.

The correct answer is D: Boundaryless, Control information, Private spaces.
