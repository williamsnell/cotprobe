Question:

Distinguish between the white and gray matter of the central nervous system.

Options:

A: "White matter" and "gray matter" are terms used to describe the coloration of neurons during staining procedures.
B: "White matter" is the nerve fiber pathways and "gray matter" is the collections of cell bodies.
C: "White matter" refers to unmyelinated axons, while "gray matter" refers to myelinated axons.
D: "White matter" consists of dendrites and "gray matter" consists of neuron cell bodies and axons.
E: "White matter" and "gray matter" are both types of neurons.
F: "White matter" is found only in the spinal cord, while "gray matter" is found only in the brain.
G: "White matter" is composed of glial cells only, while "gray matter" consists of both neurons and glial cells.
H: "White matter" contains the synapses and "gray matter" contains the neurotransmitters.
I: "White matter" is the myelin sheath and "gray matter" is the axons.
J: "White matter" is the collections of cell bodies and "gray matter" is the nerve fiber pathways.

Okay, so I have this multiple choice question about distinguishing between white and gray matter in the central nervous system. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that the brain has these two types of matter, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

Wait, white and gray matter are based on the appearance, right? I think gray matter looks gray because it's where the neurons' cell bodies are. Because the cell bodies are more densely packed there, it gives it that color. And white matter, I guess, is whitish because of the myelin sheaths on the axons. Myelin is fatty, so it makes the tissue look white.

So the question is asking about the distinction between them. Let me look at the options.

Option A says they're terms from staining procedures. I don't think so. I remember that the colors are natural because of the myelin, not just because of stains. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: White matter is nerve fiber pathways, gray is cell bodies. That sounds familiar. White matter is all the axons, which are like the cables transmitting signals, while gray matter has the cell bodies where processing happens. So B might be correct.

Option C: White is unmyelinated axons, gray is myelinated. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Myelin makes the matter white, so white matter has myelinated axons. So C is incorrect.

Option D: White matter has dendrites, gray has cell bodies and axons. Doesn't sound right. Dendrites are part of the cell bodies, so gray matter includes them. White matter is axons, so D doesn't seem right.

Option E says both are types of neurons. No, they're not. They're regions, not types. So E is wrong.

Option F: White only in spinal cord, gray only in brain. No, the spinal cord has both. The gray matter is in the center, and white matter surrounds it. So F is incorrect.

Option G: White is only glial cells, gray has both. No, white matter is mostly axons with glial cells, and gray matter has neurons and glial cells. So G is wrong.

Option H: White has synapses, gray has neurotransmitters. I think synapses are in the gray matter where the dendrites and cell bodies are, because that's where the connections happen. So H is incorrect.

Option I: White is myelin sheath and gray is axons. Wait, no. The myelin is part of the white matter, but the axons themselves are in white matter. So I is not correct.

Option J: White is cell bodies, gray is nerve fibers. That's the opposite of what B says. Since I thought B was correct, J must be wrong.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be B: White matter is the nerve fiber pathways (axons) and gray matter is collections of cell bodies.

The correct answer is:

B: "White matter" is the nerve fiber pathways and "gray matter" is the collections of cell bodies.

This is because white matter consists of myelinated axons that form the nerve fiber pathways, while gray matter is composed of neuron cell bodies where neural processing occurs. 

Answer: B
