Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromotive force, or emf, of a mechanical device. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a mechanical device moves a charge of 1.5 coulombs for a distance of 20 cm through a uniform electric field of 2 × 10³ newtons per coulomb. I need to find the emf of the device. The options are given from A to J, so I'll have to calculate it and pick the right one.

Wait, what's emf again? Oh right, emf stands for electromotive force, which is basically the energy provided by a device per unit charge. The formula I remember is emf (ε) equals the work done (W) divided by the charge (q), so ε = W/q.

But wait, how do I find the work done here? Oh, right! The work done by the electric field on the charge is given by W = q * E * d, where E is the electric field strength and d is the distance the charge moves. So putting that into the emf formula: ε = (q * E * d) / q. Oh wait, the q cancels out! So ε = E * d.

Wait, but wait a second. I should double-check that. Because electric field E is force per unit charge, E = F/q. And work done W is F * d. So substituting F = E * q, then W = E * q * d. So when calculating emf, which is W/q, that becomes E*d. So yes, ε = E * d.

But wait, units. Oh yeah, E is in newtons per coulomb (N/C), and d is in meters. So the product will be in (N/C) * m = N·m/C. But since 1 volt is equal to 1 N·m/C, the unit works out to volts.

So, the calculation. E is 2e3 N/C, which is 2000 N/C. Distance d is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters.

So ε = E * d = 2000 N/C * 0.2 m = 400 N·m/C, which is 400 volts.

Looking at the options: Option I is 400 volts. So the answer should be I.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Oh wait, wait! Is the device doing work against the field or with it? Oh, because if the device is moving the charge, it's providing energy. The emf refers to the work done by the device, so it's the energy per charge it provides. So whether the field is helping or opposing depends on the direction. But since we're just given the magnitude, the product should be correct.

Yes, I think that's right. So the emf is 400 volts. So the correct option is I.

To determine the emf of the mechanical device, we use the formula for emf (ε), which is given by:

\[
\varepsilon = E \cdot d
\]

where:
- \( E \) is the electric field strength (\( 2 \times 10^3 \, \text{N/C} \)),
- \( d \) is the distance the charge is moved (\( 20 \, \text{cm} = 0.2 \, \text{m} \)).

Substituting the values:

\[
\varepsilon = (2000 \, \text{N/C}) \cdot (0.2 \, \text{m}) = 400 \, \text{volts}.
\]

Thus, the emf of the device is **400 volts**, which corresponds to option **I**.

Answer: I
