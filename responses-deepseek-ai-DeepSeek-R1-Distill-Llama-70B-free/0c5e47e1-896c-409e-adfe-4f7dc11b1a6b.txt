Okay, so I've got this economics problem in front of me. It's about consumption and savings schedules. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that C is consumption, S is savings, and Y is disposable income. The consumption schedule is given by the formula C = 200 + (2/3)Y. There are two parts to the question: a) finding the formula for the savings schedule, and b) determining when savings would be zero.

First, I remember that in economics, savings (S) is calculated as disposable income (Y) minus consumption (C). So the basic formula should be S = Y - C. That makes sense because if your income is Y and you spend C, what's left is your savings.

So for part a), I'll substitute the given C into the savings formula. The given C is 200 plus (2/3)Y. So substituting that in, the savings S would be Y minus [200 + (2/3)Y]. Let me write that out:

S = Y - (200 + (2/3)Y)

Now, I need to simplify that expression. Let's distribute the negative sign inside the parentheses. So that becomes:

S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y

Wait, combining like terms here. Y is the same as (3/3)Y, right? So (3/3)Y minus (2/3)Y is (1/3)Y. So putting that together:

S = (1/3)Y - 200

Alternatively, rearranging the terms, that can be written as S = -200 + (1/3)Y. That looks right.

Now for part b), when would savings be zero? That means we set S equal to zero and solve for Y.

So:

0 = -200 + (1/3)Y

Let me solve for Y. Adding 200 to both sides:

200 = (1/3)Y

Multiply both sides by 3 to get Y by itself:

Y = 600

So when Y is 600, savings S would be zero.

Now I need to look at the options provided and see which one matches both of these results. Let's scan through the options.

Option A: S = -300 + (1/2)Y, Y=400. That doesn't match our S which is -200 + (1/3)Y, and Y=600.

Option B: S = -100 + (1/3)Y, Y=600. The S formula has the right coefficient for Y but the wrong intercept. Because our S is -200, not -100.

Option C: S=-200 + (3/4)Y, Y=266.67. The intercept is right, but the coefficient is 3/4 instead of 1/3, so no.

Option D: S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y, Y=600. Wait, simplifying D's S: Y is 1Y, minus 200, minus (2/3)Y. So (1Y - (2/3)Y) is (1/3)Y. So S= (1/3)Y -200. Which matches our a) part. And Y=600 matches our b) part. So option D looks correct for both parts.

Wait, but I should check the other options just to be sure. Option I also has S = -200 + (1/3)Y, which is the same as what I found. And Y=600. So option I's formula for S is correct, and Y is correct.

Wait, now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought option D was correct, but now I see option I also matches.

Wait, let me recheck:

Option D says S = Y -200 - (2/3)Y. Let me compute that: Y - (2/3)Y is (1/3)Y. So S = (1/3)Y -200, which is the same as our derived formula. And Y=600 when S=0. So D is correct.

Option I: S = -200 + (1/3)Y, which is the same as our formula. And Y=600, which is correct. So both D and I have the correct formula and Y value?

Wait, no. Wait, let me read the options again:

Option D: S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y, Y=600. So their S is Y -200 - (2/3)Y, which simplifies to (1/3)Y -200, same as our formula. So D is correct.

Option I: S = -200 + (1/3)Y, Y=600. So that's the same as our formula. So why are there two options with correct a and b?

Wait, no. Wait, looking again, the options each have two parts: the S formula and the Y when S=0. So both D and I have Y=600, which is correct.

Wait, but looking at their S formulas:

Option D's S is written as Y -200 - (2/3)Y. Which is correct, but perhaps the options are trying to present the formula in a standard form. So perhaps D is presenting the formula in an unsimplified way, whereas I has it simplified.

Wait, but the question says "What would be the formula for the savings schedule?" So perhaps both D and I are correct, but I think the standard form is S = -200 + (1/3)Y, which is option I.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options again. Let me recheck each option.

Option I: S = -200 + (1/3)Y, Y = 600. That's correct.

Option D: S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y, Y=600. That's also correct but written differently. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the question says "What would be the formula for the savings schedule?" So the formula is S = Y - C. Since C is 200 + (2/3)Y, substituting gives S = Y - [200 + (2/3)Y] = Y -200 - (2/3)Y = (1/3)Y -200. So that is the same as option I's formula. So option I is the correct formula.

Alternatively, option D's formula is the expanded version before simplification. But the standard form would probably be option I.

Wait, but in the options, each option gives a particular S formula and a particular Y value. So both D and I have Y=600, which is correct, but their S formulas are different. But wait, D's S formula simplifies to the same as I's. So perhaps both D and I are correct in terms of the S formula, but that seems unlikely because the options are multiple choice with only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the S formula:

Given C = 200 + (2/3)Y,

Then S = Y - C = Y - [200 + (2/3)Y] = Y -200 - (2/3)Y.

Compute Y - (2/3)Y: Y is 1, so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. So S = (1/3)Y -200.

Which can be written as S = -200 + (1/3)Y, which matches option I.

So the correct S formula is option I's. And the correct Y when S=0 is 600, which is also in option I.

So the correct answer is option I.

To solve the problem, we start with the relationship between savings (S), consumption (C), and disposable income (Y). The formula for savings is:

\[
S = Y - C
\]

Given the consumption schedule:

\[
C = 200 + \frac{2}{3}Y
\]

Substituting this into the savings formula:

\[
S = Y - \left(200 + \frac{2}{3}Y\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
S = Y - 200 - \frac{2}{3}Y
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
S = \frac{1}{3}Y - 200
\]

This can also be written as:

\[
S = -200 + \frac{1}{3}Y
\]

Thus, the formula for the savings schedule is:

\[
S = -200 + \frac{1}{3}Y
\]

For part (b), to find when savings are zero, set \( S = 0 \):

\[
0 = -200 + \frac{1}{3}Y
\]

Adding 200 to both sides:

\[
200 = \frac{1}{3}Y
\]

Multiplying through by 3:

\[
Y = 600
\]

Thus, savings are zero when disposable income \( Y = 600 \).

Now, comparing these results to the options provided:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The savings formula and the value of \( Y \) do not match.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the coefficient of \( Y \) in the savings formula is correct, the intercept is wrong.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The coefficient of \( Y \) is wrong, and the value of \( Y \) is incorrect.
- **Option D**: The savings formula is written as \( S = Y - 200 - \frac{2}{3}Y \), which simplifies to \( S = \frac{1}{3}Y - 200 \). This matches the derived formula, and \( Y = 600 \) is correct. However, the formula is not in its simplest form.
- **Option I**: The savings formula is \( S = -200 + \frac{1}{3}Y \), which matches the derived formula exactly, and \( Y = 600 \) is correct.

Since the question asks for the formula in its standard form, **Option I** is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer: I**
