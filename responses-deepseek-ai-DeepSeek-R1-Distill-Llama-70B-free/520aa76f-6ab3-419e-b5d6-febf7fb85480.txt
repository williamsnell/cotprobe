Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man committed a series of heinous crimes, including a kidnapping, that took him across state lines and violated federal law. He was convicted and received a life sentence. The felon, however, was pardoned by the President of the United States, who was a childhood friend. A great hue and cry ensued, and the talking heads on television proclaimed that legislation was needed to prevent such injustice again. Would such legislation be constitutional?

Options:

A: No, because the president's power to pardon can only be limited by a constitutional amendment.
B: Yes, because the Supreme Court can overrule a presidential pardon.
C: No, because the Constitution does not allow for any limitations on the presidential pardon power.
D: Yes, under Article II
E: Yes, under Article I.
F: Yes, because the president's power to pardon is not unlimited according to the Supreme Court.
G: Yes, under the Fifth Amendment.
H: Yes, because Congress can put limits on the pardon power.
I: No. While what the president did wasn't a good idea, the Constitution expressly grants the President an unqualified power to pardon.
J: No, because the Constitution gives the president the absolute power to grant pardons for federal offenses.

Okay, so I've got this question about the presidential pardon power and whether Congress can pass legislation to limit it after a controversial pardon. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Constitution gives the President the power to grant pardons. I think it's in Article II, Section 2. The exact wording is something like the President can grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment. So that's the starting point.

But wait, does this power have any limits? I recall that the pardon power is quite broad, but I'm not sure if it's absolute. There was a Supreme Court case, maybe United States v. Nixon, but I think that was about tapes, not pardons. Another case comes to mind, perhaps Ex parte Garland? No, I'm not sure about the details. I think in that case, the court held that the pardon power doesn't extend to impeachment or judicially related things, but generally, it's pretty broad.

So the question is about whether legislation can limit this power. The options suggest that some think yes, others no. The initial thought is that the pardon power is granted by the Constitution, so maybe only a constitutional amendment can change it. Because Article I is about Congress's powers, but if the pardon is an executive power under Article II, then Congress can't just pass a law limiting it.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no, because the power can only be limited by a constitutional amendment. That makes sense if the pardon power is absolute as per the Constitution.

Option C and J say no, citing that the Constitution doesn't allow limitations or gives absolute power. I think the Constitution doesn't explicitly allow limitations, so these could be correct.

Option F says yes, because the pardon power isn't unlimited according to the Supreme Court. Wait, I thought the Supreme Court generally upheld the breadth of the pardon power, except maybe in cases like impeachment or judicial functions. So F might not be correct because the Court hasn't said it's limited in the way the question suggests.

Option H says yes, Congress can limit it. But if the power is constitutional, I don't think Congress can just pass a law over it. Unless there's a specific constitutional provision allowing it, which I don't think exists.

So the key here is whether the pardon power is absolute. The Constitution says the President "shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment." So it's pretty broad, except for impeachment. That suggests that the President's pardon power is absolute for federal offenses, except in impeachment cases.

Therefore, any legislation by Congress trying to limit it would be unconstitutional because the power is granted by the Constitution, and only a constitutional amendment could change it. So the answer should be that such legislation would not be constitutional.

Looking at the options again:

Option I and J say no, because the Constitution grants the power unqualifiedly or absolutely. Option I says it's unqualified, J says absolute. Both seem similar, but looking at their exact wording. Option I says the power is unqualified, which aligns with the Constitution's wording.

So the correct answer is either I or J. Wait, the question is whether legislation would be constitutional. If the President's power is absolute, then Congress can't limit it via legislation. So the answer would be that such legislation is not constitutional.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because only a constitutional amendment can limit it. That's correct because Congress can't pass a law to limit a constitutional power.

I: No, because the Constitution expressly grants an unqualified power. That's also correct.

Wait, but the question is whether the legislation would be constitutional. So if the power is absolute, then the legislation is unconstitutional. So the answer would be that such legislation wouldn't be constitutional, so options A, C, I, J are possible.

Wait, but option A says that the power can only be limited by a constitutional amendment. That's correct because Congress can't do it by legislation. So the legislation would be unconstitutional.

Similarly, option I says the President has an unqualified power, so the legislation would be unconstitutional.

So between A and I, which is correct.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option I says "No. While what the president did wasn't a good idea, the Constitution expressly grants the President an unqualified power to pardon." That seems to align with the idea that the power is unqualified, so legislation can't limit it.

Option J says "No, because the Constitution gives the president the absolute power to grant pardons for federal offenses." So J is also a possible correct answer.

Hmm, but I think the more precise answer is that the pardon power is absolute except in impeachment, so any limitation by Congress would be unconstitutional. Therefore, the correct answer is either I or J.

Wait, in the Constitution, the pardon power is for federal offenses, so J's statement is accurate. So the correct answer would be J: No, because the Constitution gives the president the absolute power to grant pardons for federal offenses.

But wait, some sources say that the pardon power is plenary but not absolute. There's a distinction. Plenary means it's a complete power, but not necessarily without any limits. But traditionally, the courts have held that the pardon power is absolute for federal crimes, except in cases of impeachment.

So J would be the correct answer because it states absolute power for federal offenses.

The presidential pardon power is granted under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which allows the President to grant reprieves and pardons for federal offenses, except in cases of impeachment. This power is broadly interpreted as absolute for federal crimes, with no explicit constitutional provisions allowing Congress to limit it through legislation. While some argue that the power is not entirely unlimited, the Supreme Court has generally upheld its breadth, leaving any potential limitations to be addressed through a constitutional amendment rather than legislative action. Therefore, any attempt by Congress to pass legislation restricting this power would be unconstitutional, as the pardon power is a constitutional grant that cannot be altered by statute.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

J: No, because the Constitution gives the president the absolute power to grant pardons for federal offenses.
