Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that two whole numbers have a least common multiple (LCM) of 60. Each number is less than or equal to 12. Also, their greatest common factor (GCF) is 2. I need to find which pair of numbers from the options A to J satisfies all these conditions.

Hmm, I remember that LCM and GCF are related to the factors of the numbers. Oh right, there's a formula that connects LCM and GCF. I think it's something like the product of the two numbers equals the product of their LCM and GCF. So, if I have two numbers, a and b, then a * b = LCM(a, b) * GCF(a, b).

Let me write that down to clarify. So, a * b = LCM * GCF. In this problem, the LCM is 60, and the GCF is 2. So substituting, a * b = 60 * 2 = 120. So the product of the two numbers should be 120.

But wait, each number is less than or equal to 12. So both a and b are ≤12, and their product is 120. Let me think about possible pairs of numbers where both are ≤12 and multiply to 120.

Let me list the factors of 120 and see which pairs fit. The factors of 120 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. But since each number can't exceed 12, I'll only consider up to 12.

Looking for pairs where a ≤12 and b ≤12, and a*b=120.

Let me see: 10 and 12 multiply to 120, because 10*12=120. Another pair could be 8 and 15, but 15 is over 12. 6 and 20, but 20 is too big. 5 and 24, no. 4 and 30, nope. 3 and 40, no. 2 and 60, no. 1 and 120, nope. So the only pair within the limit is 10 and 12.

Wait, but let me check another possibility.  Maybe 10 and 12 isn't the only one.  Are there other pairs where both numbers are ≤12 and product 120?

Let's see: 120 divided by 12 is 10, which we've considered. 120 divided by 10 is 12. Next, 120 divided by 8 is 15, which is too big. 120/6=20, which is too big. 120/5=24, still too big. Hmm, no, I think 10 and 12 is the only pair where both are ≤12.

But wait, let me check 8 and 15. Oh, but 15 is over 12, so that doesn't work. So 10 and 12 is the only possible pair with product 120 and each ≤12.

Now, but wait, the options given include some pairs. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: 5 and 12 → 5*12=60 → LCM would be 60, but their GCF is 1, not 2. So this doesn't fit.

B: 12 and 15 → 15 is over 12, so invalid.

C: 6 and 12 → 6*12=72. LCM would be 12, and GCF is 6. So that doesn't fit.

D:4 and8 → product is 32. LCM is 8, GCF is 4. Not matching.

E:3 and9 → product 27, LCM 9, GCF 3. Doesn't fit.

F:8 and10 → product 80. LCM would be 40? Wait, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, 8 is 2^3, 10 is 2*5. So LCM is 2^3 *5 =40. GCF is 2. So their product is 80, which is 40 *2=80. So yes, that pair's product is 80, which is less than 120. So that's not the pair we're looking for.

G:6 and10 → product is 60. LCM of 6 (2*3) and 10 (2*5) is 2*3*5=30. GCF is 2. So 6*10=60=30*2, which fits. But their product is 60, which is less than 120, so not our case.

H:2 and10 → product 20. LCM is 10, GCF is 2. 20=10*2, which is correct, but product 20 is way below 120.

I: 2 and6 → product 12. LCM is 6, GCF is 2. So 12=6*2. But again, product is 12, not 120.

J:10 and12 → product 120, which matches. Now, let's check their LCM and GCF.

10 factors: 2*5. 12 factors: 2^2 *3.

GCF is the minimum exponents of shared primes. So for 2, min(1,2)=1. So GCF is 2^1=2. That matches the condition.

LCM is the max exponents. So 2^2, 3^1, 5^1 → 4*3*5=60. Which is the given LCM. So this pair fits.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 10 and 12 are the correct pair because their product is 120. But let me make sure no other options have product 120 and meet the conditions.

Looking back at the options, option J is 10 and12, so that's the correct one.

Wait, but what about option F:8 and10. Their product is 80, which is less than 120, so that's not the pair we want.

So the correct answer should be option J:10 and12.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers. The formula connecting these is:

\[
a \times b = \text{LCM}(a, b) \times \text{GCF}(a, b)
\]

Given that the LCM is 60 and the GCF is 2, we calculate:

\[
a \times b = 60 \times 2 = 120
\]

Thus, the two numbers must have a product of 120, and each number must be less than or equal to 12. Listing the factor pairs of 120, we find that the only pair where both numbers are ≤12 is \(10\) and \(12\).

Next, we verify the GCF and LCM for the pair \(10\) and \(12\):
- Prime factors of \(10\): \(2 \times 5\)
- Prime factors of \(12\): \(2^2 \times 3\)
- GCF: The minimum exponent of the shared prime factor \(2\) is \(2^1 = 2\), which matches the given GCF.
- LCM: The maximum exponents of all prime factors are \(2^2\), \(3^1\), and \(5^1\), giving \(4 \times 3 \times 5 = 60\), which matches the given LCM.

Finally, we check the options provided:
- Option J (\(10\) and \(12\)) satisfies all conditions: product \(120\), GCF \(2\), and LCM \(60\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: 10 and 12**
