Question:

In Python 3, what is the output of ['Hi!'] * 4?

Options:

A: ['Hi!', 4]
B: ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']
C: 4 * ['Hi!']
D: ['Hi!4']
E: Error
F: ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']
G: ['Hi!Hi!Hi!Hi!']
H: ['Hi!'] * 4
I: ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']
J: None of the above.

Okay, so I have this Python question here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking about the output when you multiply a list by 4 in Python 3. The code given is ['Hi!'] * 4. Hmm, I remember that in Python, multiplying a list by an integer n repeats the elements of the list n times. 

Wait, so if the list is ['Hi!'], multiplying by 4 should create a new list with four 'Hi!' elements. So the result should be ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!'], right? 

Let me make sure. I've seen examples where, like, [1] * 3 gives [1,1,1]. So applying that here, each element in the original list is repeated the specified number of times. 

Now, looking at the options. Option F says ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!'], which matches what I think. Option B has five elements, which would be the case if it was multiplied by 5. Option D is a single string, but the original is a list, so that's not right. Option G looks like it's concatenating the strings, but since it's a list, that doesn't happen. 

So the correct answer should be option F. None of the other options make sense except F. So I'll go with F.

The output of `['Hi!'] * 4` in Python 3 is a list containing the string `'Hi!'` repeated four times. This results in `['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']`, which corresponds to option F.
