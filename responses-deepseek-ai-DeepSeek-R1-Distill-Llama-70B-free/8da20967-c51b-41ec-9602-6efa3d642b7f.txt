Question:

A man works at a tire warehouse, where his job duties consist of loading tires onto trucks. The job is exhausting, and the warehouse is always short of personnel. One day, while loading a heavy tractor tire onto a truck by himself, he experienced a sharp and excruciating pain in his lower back. He did not report the incident to his employer, but continued to work. A week later, after work, he went to the doctor for treatment. The man then sues his employer, alleging that the employer failed to provide him with adequate assistance, safety equipment, and training to load heavy tractor tires, thereby contributing to his injury. The employer alleges that the man is merely trying to obtain compensation for an old back injury, unrelated to his employment. At trial, the man's doctor testified that the man told her that his back began hurting while he was loading the tire on the truck. The doctor's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis.
B: admissible as a statement made in the course of treatment.
C: inadmissible as a violation of the physicianpatient privilege.
D: admissible as it is a statement of fact.
E: admissible as expert testimony.
F: admissible as it is a statement made in anticipation of litigation.
G: inadmissible as it is a speculative statement.
H: inadmissible as it is a biased statement.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: inadmissible as it is a self-serving statement.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a man who works at a tire warehouse. His job is physically demanding, and the warehouse is understaffed. One day, while loading a heavy tire by himself, he feels a sharp pain in his lower back. He doesn't report it to his employer but keeps working. A week later, he goes to the doctor and now is suing his employer, claiming the employer didn't provide adequate help, safety equipment, or training, which led to his injury. The employer is saying it's an old back injury unrelated to work.

At the trial, the man's doctor testifies that he told her his back started hurting when he was loading the tire. The question is about the admissibility of this testimony.

So, the issue here is whether the doctor's testimony about what the man said is admissible. The options are about different hearsay exceptions and other evidence rules.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the man's statement to the doctor is being offered to show that the injury happened at work, which would make it hearsay. But there are exceptions.

I remember that statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are an exception. Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) says that statements made to a physician in the course of treatment are admissible because they're considered reliable—patients usually tell the truth when seeking treatment.

In this case, the man told the doctor about the incident when he went for treatment a week later. He was seeking treatment, so that should fall under the medical diagnosis exception. His statement explains the cause of his injury, which is relevant for treatment purposes. So the doctor's testimony is about a statement made for treatment, making it admissible under 803(4).

Looking at the options:

A: Admissible as statement for medical diagnosis. That sounds right.

B: Admissible as a statement in the course of treatment. Also correct, since it's the same idea.

Wait, but wait—what's the difference between A and B? Because 803(4) covers statements for diagnosis or treatment. So both A and B might seem correct, but maybe the options are trying to test if the statement was made during treatment.

Wait, the man went to the doctor a week after the incident, and told her then. That's part of the treatment process, so it would fall under both diagnosis and treatment. So either A or B could be correct.

But looking at the options, let me check the exact wording. Option A says "for the purposes of medical diagnosis," and B says "in the course of treatment." So both could apply, but the statement was made during the course of treatment, which includes diagnosis. So both A and B seem correct.

Wait, but the other options: Option E is expert testimony, which doesn't apply here because the testimony is about what the man said, not the doctor's opinion. Option C is physician-patient privilege, but the patient is the one offering the statement, so he waives the privilege by testifying about it.

Options D, F, G, H, J are about other issues. D says statement of fact, but that's not a hearsay exception. F is anticipation of litigation, which would make it inadmissible, but the man went to the doctor a week after, so it's more about treatment than litigation.

I is inadmissible hearsay without exception. But the statement does have an exception, so I is wrong.

So back to A and B. Are both correct? The options are mutually exclusive, so which one is correct?

Wait, the question is about the doctor's testimony. So the statement was made for the purpose of diagnosis. So the correct exception is 803(4), which covers statements for diagnosis or treatment. So both A and B are correct descriptions. But looking at the options, A and B are separate options.

Wait, but in the scenario, the man went to the doctor a week after the incident. So the statement was made in the course of treatment, which includes statements for diagnosis.

So both A and B could be applicable. But maybe the precise exception is that it's a statement made for diagnosis, so A. Or is it part of the treatment, so B.

Wait, the rule is that statements made to a physician are admissible if they were made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. So the man's statement explaining how he was injured would be for diagnosis. So that would fit under A.

But in some cases, the courts consider that statements made during treatment, regardless of whether they're for diagnosis or treatment, fall under the exception. So if the man was undergoing treatment and told the doctor, that's in the course of treatment, making B correct.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The man went to the doctor for treatment, and in the process, he told her about the incident. So the statement was made during the course of treatment, which would be option B.

Wait, but the statement was about the cause of his injury, which is more for diagnosis. So perhaps it's more accurate to say it's for diagnosis. So A would be correct.

Alternatively, the statement was made during the course of treatment, so B applies. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is "statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis," and B is "statement made in the course of treatment."

So the man's statement was made to the doctor while being treated. So it's in the course of treatment, making B correct. Because the statement was made during the treatment, not just for diagnosis.

Wait, I think the correct answer is A or B. But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to recall: the medical diagnosis exception includes any statement made to a healthcare provider for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. So if the statement is about the cause of the injury, that's for diagnosis, so A applies. But if the statement is part of the treatment process, then B applies.

Wait, but the rule (803(4)) covers statements made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. So if the man's statement was to explain how he got hurt, that's for diagnosis. So A would be the correct answer. But if the statement was made during treatment (as part of the process), then B.

Alternatively, both A and B could be correct, but the options are separate. So perhaps in this case, the correct answer is A, because the primary purpose was diagnosis.

Wait, but the man went to the doctor for treatment a week after the incident. So the statement is part of the treatment process. So the statement was made in the course of treatment, making option B correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me check an example: if a patient tells the doctor during treatment about how an injury occurred, that's admissible under 803(4). So that would fall under statements made for diagnosis or treatment.

So in this case, the man's statement was made during treatment, explaining the cause, so it's allowed under the exception. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but the options are A and B. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps both A and B are correct, but looking at the options, the question is which one applies. So perhaps the answer is A because the statement was for the purpose of diagnosis, and B is about the course of treatment, which is a broader context.

Wait, no, the statement was made in the course of treatment, so B would be correct. Because the man was undergoing treatment when he made the statement.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the statement was made to the doctor during treatment, so it's admissible under the medical exception, which is option B.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by a man to his doctor, which the doctor later testified about in court. The man alleged that his injury occurred while loading a tire at work, and the employer disputed this, claiming it was an old injury. The doctor's testimony about the man's statement is being evaluated under hearsay exceptions.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) provides an exception for statements made to a physician for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. These statements are considered reliable because patients typically provide truthful information when seeking medical care.

In this case, the man made the statement to the doctor during the course of treatment, explaining how his injury occurred. This statement falls under the medical diagnosis or treatment exception because it was made to explain the cause of his injury, which is relevant for diagnosis and treatment. The key issue is whether the statement was made for diagnosis or as part of the treatment process.

Option A focuses on "statements for the purposes of medical diagnosis," which applies because the man's statement about the cause of his injury was crucial for diagnosis. Option B emphasizes "statements made in the course of treatment," which also applies because the statement was made during the treatment process. Both options describe the same exception but frame it differently.

However, the statement was made during the treatment process, and its primary purpose was to explain the injury's cause for diagnosis. Therefore, while both A and B are accurate descriptions of the exception, the more precise answer is **A**, as the statement was specifically for the purpose of medical diagnosis.

ANSWER: A
