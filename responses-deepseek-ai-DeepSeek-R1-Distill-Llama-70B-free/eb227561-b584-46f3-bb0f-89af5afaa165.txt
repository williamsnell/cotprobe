Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem in front of me. It's about finding the curl of a vector field at a specific point. Hmm, I remember that the curl is a measure of the rotation or circulation density of the vector field. The formula involves partial derivatives, right?

The vector field given is a = x²y² i + 2xyz j + z² k. And I need to evaluate the curl at the point (1, -2, 1). Wait, no, the point is (1, -2, 1), right? Because the last part says (1), but maybe that's a typo. Oh wait, the point is (1, -2, 1). Got it.

So I think the curl of a vector field a, written as curl a, is calculated using the cross product of the del operator with a. The formula is:

curl a = ∇ × a

Which in determinant form is:

| i    j    k  |
|∂x  ∂y  ∂z|
|a_x a_y a_z|

So expanding this determinant, curl a would have components:

(i*(∂a_z/∂y - ∂a_y/∂z)) - (j*(∂a_z/∂x - ∂a_x/∂z)) + (k*(∂a_y/∂x - ∂a_x/∂y))

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the signs right. The determinant expansion for the curl gives:

i*(∂a_z/∂y - ∂a_y/∂z) - j*(∂a_z/∂x - ∂a_x/∂z) + k*(∂a_y/∂x - ∂a_x/∂y)

Yes, that's correct.

So first I need to find the partial derivatives of each component of a with respect to x, y, and z.

Let's break it down. The vector field a has components:

a_x = x² y²
a_y = 2 x y z
a_z = z²

So first, I'll compute each partial derivative needed for the curl.

Starting with the i component of curl a: ∂a_z/∂y - ∂a_y/∂z.

Compute ∂a_z/∂y: a_z is z², so derivative with respect to y is 0.

Compute ∂a_y/∂z: a_y is 2xyz. The derivative with respect to z is 2xy *1 = 2xy.

So the i component is 0 - 2xy = -2xy.

Next, the j component: -(∂a_z/∂x - ∂a_x/∂z)

Wait, wait, the formula is - [ ∂a_z/∂x - ∂a_x/∂z ]

So let me compute ∂a_z/∂x: a_z is z², so derivative is 0.

Compute ∂a_x/∂z: a_x is x² y², so derivative with respect to z is 0.

So ∂a_z/∂x - ∂a_x/∂z = 0 - 0 = 0. So the j component is -0 = 0.

Wait no, wait. Let me make sure I have the signs right. The j component in the curl formula is subtracted, so it's - [ (∂a_z/∂x) - (∂a_x/∂z) ) ].

So yes, since both are zero, j component is 0.

Now the k component: ∂a_y/∂x - ∂a_x/∂y.

Compute ∂a_y/∂x: a_y is 2xyz. Derive with respect to x: 2 y z.

Compute ∂a_x/∂y: a_x is x² y². Derive with respect to y: 2 x² y.

So the k component is 2 y z - 2 x² y.

Putting it all together, the curl a is:

(-2xy)i + 0j + (2 y z - 2 x² y)k.

Now I need to evaluate this at the point (1, -2, 1). So x=1, y=-2, z=1.

Compute each component:

i component: -2*(1)*(-2) = (-2)*1*(-2) = 4.

j component is 0, so that's easy.

k component: 2*(-2)*(1) - 2*(1)^2*(-2) = Let's compute each term.

First term: 2*(-2)*(1) = -4.

Second term: 2*(1)^2*(-2) = 2*1*(-2) = -4.

Wait wait, no: the k component is (2 y z) - (2 x² y). So substituting:

2*(-2)*1 = -4.

Minus 2*(1)^2*(-2) = - (2*1*(-2)) = - (-4) = +4.

Wait wait, more accurately:

2yz = 2*(-2)(1) = -4.

2x² y = 2*(1)^2*(-2) = 2*1*(-2) = -4.

So the k component is (-4) - (-4) = 0.

Wait wait, no:

The k component is (2 y z) - (2 x² y) = [2*(-2)(1)] - [2*(1)^2*(-2)].

Compute each term:

First term: 2*(-2)(1) = -4.

Second term: 2*(1)^2*(-2) = 2*1*(-2) = -4.

So subtracting: (-4) - (-4) = (-4) +4 = 0.

So the curl a at (1,-2,1) is (4)i + 0j + 0k.

So the vector is (4, 0, 0).

Looking at the options:

Option D is (4,0,0). Option A is (4,4,0), so not that. Option C is (0,0,4). So the answer is D.

To find the curl of the vector field **a** = \( x^2y^2 \, \mathbf{i} + 2xyz \, \mathbf{j} + z^2 \, \mathbf{k} \) at the point \( (1, -2, 1) \), we use the formula for the curl in determinant form:

\[
\text{curl } \mathbf{a} = \nabla \times \mathbf{a} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
a_x & a_y & a_z
\end{vmatrix}.
\]

Expanding this determinant, the components of the curl are:

1. **i-component**: \( \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial z} \),
2. **j-component**: \( -\left( \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial z} \right) \),
3. **k-component**: \( \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial y} \).

### Step 1: Compute the partial derivatives
The components of the vector field are:
- \( a_x = x^2y^2 \),
- \( a_y = 2xyz \),
- \( a_z = z^2 \).

Compute the required partial derivatives:
- \( \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial z^2}{\partial y} = 0 \),
- \( \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial (2xyz)}{\partial z} = 2xy \),
- \( \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial z^2}{\partial x} = 0 \),
- \( \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial (x^2y^2)}{\partial z} = 0 \),
- \( \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial (2xyz)}{\partial x} = 2yz \),
- \( \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial (x^2y^2)}{\partial y} = 2x^2y \).

### Step 2: Compute the components of the curl
1. **i-component**:
   \[
   \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial z} = 0 - 2xy = -2xy.
   \]

2. **j-component**:
   \[
   -\left( \frac{\partial a_z}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial z} \right) = -\left( 0 - 0 \right) = 0.
   \]

3. **k-component**:
   \[
   \frac{\partial a_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial a_x}{\partial y} = 2yz - 2x^2y.
   \]

### Step 3: Evaluate at the point \( (1, -2, 1) \)
Substitute \( x = 1 \), \( y = -2 \), and \( z = 1 \):
1. **i-component**:
   \[
   -2xy = -2(1)(-2) = 4.
   \]

2. **j-component**:
   \[
   0.
   \]

3. **k-component**:
   \[
   2yz - 2x^2y = 2(-2)(1) - 2(1)^2(-2) = -4 - (-4) = 0.
   \]

Thus, the curl at \( (1, -2, 1) \) is:
\[
\text{curl } \mathbf{a} = (4, 0, 0).
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The result \( (4, 0, 0) \) corresponds to **Option D**.
