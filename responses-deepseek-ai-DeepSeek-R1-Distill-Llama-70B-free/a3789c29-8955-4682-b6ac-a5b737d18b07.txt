Question:

A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?

Options:

A: Deltoid
B: Infraspinatus
C: Supraspinatus
D: Triceps Brachii
E: Subscapularis
F: Coracobrachialis
G: Teres Major
H: Pectoralis
I: Brachialis
J: Biceps Brachii

Okay, so I've got this question about a guy with shoulder pain, and I need to figure out which tendon is inflamed. Let me think through this step by step.

The patient is a 45-year-old man who started having right shoulder pain after chopping wood two days ago. So, the onset is recent, associated with physical activity. Chopping wood probably involves a lot of repetitive movements, maybe overhead or lifting, which can strain the shoulder muscles.

On examination, there are no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. That suggests it's not a fracture or something like a dislocation. The pain is reproduced when the patient externally rotates the shoulder against resistance, and there's no weakness. Hmm, so when he tries to rotate his shoulder outward (external rotation) and resists it, the pain happens. But he's not weak, which is interesting.

So, the question is asking which tendon, in addition to the teres minor, is most likely inflamed. The options are various muscles around the shoulder.

I remember that the shoulder has several muscles and tendons that form the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff includes the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. These muscles work together to stabilize the shoulder joint and allow for various movements.

External rotation of the shoulder is primarily done by the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. Since the pain is reproduced on external rotation against resistance, it makes me think that these muscles or their tendons are involved.

The teres minor is already mentioned, so the question is about another tendon. Since the patient doesn't have weakness but has pain on resistance, it's probably an inflammation rather than a tear, which would cause weakness.

So the other muscle involved in external rotation is the infraspinatus. So if both teres minor and infraspinatus are inflamed, their tendons would be the ones causing the pain.

Looking at the options, option B is Infraspinatus. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the muscles. The supraspinatus is involved in abduction, especially the first part of lifting the arm. The subscapularis is more about internal rotation. So the infraspinatus is the other external rotator.

So the correct answer should be B: Infraspinatus.

The patient is a 45-year-old man with right shoulder pain that began after chopping wood, involving repetitive movements. The pain is reproduced upon external rotation of the shoulder against resistance, but no weakness is noted. This suggests inflammation rather than a tear, as weakness would typically indicate the latter. The rotator cuff muscles, including the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis, stabilize the shoulder and facilitate movement. External rotation is primarily performed by the infraspinatus and teres minor. Since the teres minor is already implicated, the infraspinatus is the most likely additional tendon involved.

Answer: B
