Okay, so I've got this economics question here about monopoly versus perfect competition in the long run. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking what monopoly has compared to perfect competition. The options are A to H, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that perfect competition is a market structure where there are many firms producing a homogeneous product. Each firm is a price taker, meaning they can't influence the market price. In the long run, firms in perfect competition make zero economic profits because entry and exit are free.

Monopoly, on the other hand, is where there's only one firm supplying the entire market with a unique product. The monopolist is a price maker, so they have the power to influence prices. They can restrict output to maximize profits, which leads to higher prices and lower output compared to perfect competition.

Now, looking at the options:

A: More price stability. I'm not sure. In perfect competition, prices are determined by the market, so they might fluctuate a lot based on supply and demand. Monopolies can set prices, so maybe they have more stable prices? Or maybe not, because they might adjust prices strategically. I'm not certain about this one.

B: More choices for consumers. No, that doesn't make sense. Monopolies usually mean less product variety because there's only one seller. Perfect competition has many firms, but they all produce similar products. So B is probably wrong.

C: Lower prices. Definitely not. Monopolies are known for higher prices because they can charge more. In perfect competition, prices are lower because firms can't charge more than the market price.

D: More efficiency. I think perfect competition is more efficient in the long run. Monopolies may lead to allocative inefficiency because they produce less than the socially optimal quantity. So D is probably incorrect.

E: Less market control. No way. Monopolies have total market control since they're the sole seller. So E is wrong.

F: Equal profit maximization. Hmm, both monopolists and perfectly competitive firms maximize profits. But in perfect competition, in the long run, profits are zero because of free entry. Monopolies can have positive profits. So F is incorrect because their profit levels aren't equal.

G: Price greater than marginal revenue. Wait, in monopoly, the price is always greater than marginal revenue because the demand curve is downward sloping, and marginal revenue is below the demand curve. In perfect competition, price equals marginal revenue because firms are price takers. So G is correct for monopoly.

H: Less product differentiation. Monopolies might have some differentiation, but perfect competition has no differentiation since products are homogeneous. So H is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: price greater than marginal revenue.

In a monopoly, the price is always greater than marginal revenue because the demand curve is downward sloping, and marginal revenue lies below the demand curve. In contrast, under perfect competition, firms are price takers, and price equals marginal revenue. This distinction makes option G correct.
