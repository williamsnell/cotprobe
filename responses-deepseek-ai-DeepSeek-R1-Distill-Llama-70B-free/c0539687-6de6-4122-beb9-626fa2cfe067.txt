Okay, so I've got this problem here about Margaret's Toyland selling bags of marbles. I need to find out how many bags they should sell to maximize their profit. Hmm, let's see. I've taken some economics before, so I think I can figure this out.

Alright, the problem gives me a few things. The price per bag is p cents, and p is equal to 20 minus 0.03 times x. So p = 20 - 0.03x. And then there's the cost function, C = 3 + 0.02x. Wait, the cost is in terms of x bags, right?

I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So I need to find the profit function first. Let's break it down.

Total revenue (TR) is the price per bag times the number of bags sold. So TR = p * x. But p is 20 - 0.03x, so substituting that in, TR becomes (20 - 0.03x) * x. Let me write that out: TR = 20x - 0.03x².

Total cost (TC) is given as C = 3 + 0.02x. So the total cost is just that linear function.

Profit (π) is TR minus TC. So π = TR - TC = (20x - 0.03x²) - (3 + 0.02x). Let me simplify that. So combining like terms:

20x - 0.02x = 19.98x
And then -0.03x² -3. So the profit function is π = -0.03x² + 19.98x - 3.

Now, to find the maximum profit, I think I need to find the vertex of this parabola. Because the profit function is a quadratic, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-0.03), the parabola opens downward, so the vertex will be the maximum point.

The formula for the vertex's x-coordinate in a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). So here, a is -0.03 and b is 19.98.

Let me compute that. x = -19.98 / (2 * -0.03). Let's calculate the denominator first: 2 * -0.03 is -0.06. So x = (-19.98) / (-0.06). The negatives cancel out, so it's 19.98 / 0.06.

Hmm, what's 19.98 divided by 0.06? Let me compute that. 0.06 times 333 is 19.98, because 0.06 * 300 is 18, and 0.06 * 33 is 1.98. So 300 + 33 is 333. So x = 333.

Wait, but looking at the options, F is 333 bags. So that's probably the answer. But wait, should I double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes?

Let me go through the steps again. Profit is TR minus TC. TR is (20 - 0.03x)*x = 20x -0.03x². TC is 3 + 0.02x. So subtracting TC, π = 20x -0.03x² -3 -0.02x → 19.98x -0.03x² -3. So yes, that's correct.

Then, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a). a is -0.03, b is 19.98. So x = -(19.98)/(2*(-0.03)) = 19.98/(0.06) = 333. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be F: 333 bags.

To determine how many bags Margaret's Toyland should sell to maximize profit, we start by defining the profit function. The price per bag is given as \( p = 20 - 0.03x \), and the total revenue (TR) is the product of price and quantity sold:  
\[
\text{TR} = p \cdot x = (20 - 0.03x) \cdot x = 20x - 0.03x^2
\]  
The total cost (TC) is provided as \( C = 3 + 0.02x \). Profit (\( \pi \)) is then calculated as:  
\[
\pi = \text{TR} - \text{TC} = (20x - 0.03x^2) - (3 + 0.02x)
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
\pi = -0.03x^2 + 19.98x - 3
\]  

To maximize profit, we find the vertex of this quadratic function. The x-coordinate of the vertex for a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -0.03 \) and \( b = 19.98 \), so:  
\[
x = -\frac{19.98}{2(-0.03)} = \frac{19.98}{0.06} = 333
\]  

Thus, the store should sell 333 bags to maximize profit. The correct answer is:

F: 333 bags
