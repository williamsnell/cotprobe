Okay, so I've got this problem about an ideal gas and I need to find out the new volume when the pressure and temperature change. Hmm, I remember that ideal gases follow the combined gas law, which is something like P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. Right, because pressure, volume, and temperature are all related.

So, the initial conditions are: volume V1 is 2 cubic feet. The pressure P1 is 137 atmospheres. Temperature T1 is 27 degrees Celsius. Oh wait, wait. I think when using the gas laws, temperature has to be in Kelvin, not Celsius. So I need to convert that. To get Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 27 + 273.15 is 300.15 K. I can probably approximate that as 300 K for simplicity.

Now the final conditions are atmospheric pressure. I think atmospheric pressure is about 1 atmosphere. So P2 is 1 atm. The temperature T2 is 50 degrees Celsius. Again, converting to Kelvin, 50 + 273.15 is approximately 323.15 K, which I'll round to 323 K since 323 is a nice number.

Putting it all into the combined gas law equation: P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. I'm looking for V2, so I'll rearrange the equation to solve for V2. 

So V2 = (P1V1 T2) / (P2 T1). Let me plug in the numbers.

P1 is 137 atm, V1 is 2 ft³, T2 is 323 K. P2 is 1 atm, T1 is 300 K. So substituting:

V2 = (137 * 2 * 323) / (1 * 300). Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

First, 137 times 2 is 274. Then multiply by 323. Let's see, 274 * 300 is 82,200, and 274 *23 is about 6,302. So total is around 82,200 + 6,302 = 88,502. Then divide by 300.

88,502 divided by 300. Let me do that division. 300 * 295 is 88,500, because 300*200=60,000, 300*95=28,500, so 60k+28.5k=88.5k. Oh wait, 300 * 295 = 88,500. So 88,502 is just 2 more than that. So 88,502 /300 is 295.006... So approximately 295.01. 

Looking at the options, option C is 295 ft³. But wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another approach: Let me calculate 137 * 2 = 274. Then 274 * 323. Let me compute that more accurately.

323 * 200 = 64,600. 323 *70=22,610. 323 *4=1,292. So adding up: 64,600 +22,610 = 87,210. Then plus 1,292 gives 88,502. So yes, that part's correct.

Then 88,502 divided by 300. Let me compute this as 88502 /300. 300 goes into 88502 how many times? 300 * 295 is 88,500, so 295 times. The remainder is 2, so 2/300 is 0.00666..., so V2=295.00666... So approximately 295.01 ft³. 

Looking at the options, option C is 295 ft³. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup. Did I get the temperatures right? Yes: 27°C is 300 K, 50°C is 323 K. Pressures correct: 137 atm and 1 atm. Volume initial is 2. Okay, so the calculation seems correct.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

Rearranging for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( P_1 = 137 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( V_1 = 2 \, \text{ft}^3 \)
- \( T_1 = 27^\circ \text{C} = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( T_2 = 50^\circ \text{C} = 323 \, \text{K} \)

### Substituting into the equation:

\[
V_2 = \frac{(137)(2)(323)}{(1)(300)}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
137 \times 2 = 274
\]
\[
274 \times 323 = 88,502
\]

Now divide by 300:

\[
V_2 = \frac{88,502}{300} \approx 295.01 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \( 295.01 \, \text{ft}^3 \) is **295 ft³**, which corresponds to **option C**.
