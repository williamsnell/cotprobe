Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about perception of risk and how it's influenced by reminders. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my marketing and psychology terms, but let me think this through.

The question says that our perception of risk is greater if we're continually reminded of it rather than just considering it at the point of purchase. I remember that there are several cognitive biases and heuristics that influence decision-making, so I need to figure out which one fits this scenario.

Let me go through the options one by one. 

Option A is the anchoring effect. I think that's when you rely too much on the first piece of information you receive. Like if you see a high price and then a lower one seems better by comparison. But this question is about risk perception increasing with reminders, so maybe not anchoring.

Option B: Price bonding. Not sure what that is. Maybe it's about how prices create a bond with customers? Doesn't ring a bell in relation to risk perception.

Option C: Purchase context. That sounds like the environment in which you make a purchase, like online vs. in-store. But how does that relate to reminders of risk?

Option D: Availability heuristic. Oh wait, I remember this one. The availability heuristic is when you judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. So if something is frequently mentioned or reminded, you perceive it as more common or risky. That fits the question because being continually reminded makes the risk seem greater.

Option E: Loss aversion. That's about preferring to avoid losses rather than gain equivalents. Like feeling the pain of losing $100 more than the joy of gaining it. Not directly about reminders affecting risk perception.

Option F: Pricing illusion. I think that's when the way prices are presented affects perception, like 99 cents making something feel cheaper. Not related to risk reminders.

Option G: Risk premium. That's the excess return demanded for holding a riskier investment. Doesn't fit the context here.

Option H: Mark-up price. That's the difference between the cost and selling price. Not relevant to risk perception.

Option I: Odd number pricing. Like pricing things at $9.99 instead of $10. Again, presentation, not about reminders.

Option J: Cost fallacy. I think that's when you continue investing because of the resources you've already put in, even if it's not wise. Not about risk perception.

Putting it all together, the key here is that repeated reminders make the risk seem more significant. That matches with the availability heuristic, which is option D. So I think the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: Availability heuristic. This concept explains how repeated reminders of a risk make it seem more significant because it becomes more readily available in our minds.
