Question:

A surgeon performed an appendectomy on a patient in an operating room at the local hospital. The surgeon was assisted by a nurse who was assigned to the operation by the hospital. During the patient's early convalescence, he complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the surgeon, who had bandaged him following the operation, had done so in such a manner as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the surgeon for malpractice, claiming $25,000 in damages. In his case-in-chief, the patient called the nurse to testifS' that shortly after the surgery, she saw the surgeon destroy the postoperative x-rays of the patient's abdomen. Upon objection by the surgeon's attorney, the trial judge should rule the nurse's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, but only if the surgeon is given an opportunity to refute the nurse's testimony.
B: inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
C: inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.
D: admissible, if the patient can demonstrate that the destroyed x-rays would have supported his claim.
E: admissible, but leave the weight of the nurse's testimony to be determined by the jury.
F: inadmissible, as the x-rays were destroyed post-operation and do not pertain to the surgeon's performance during the surgery.
G: inadmissible, unless other evidence can corroborate the nurse's testimony.
H: admissible, only if the nurse can prove that the surgeon intentionally destroyed the x-rays.
I: inadmissible, because the nurse's testimony is hearsay.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with what's admissible in court. Let me try to break this down.

The scenario is a surgeon who did an appendectomy, and post-op, the patient had unusual pain. It turned out the surgeon's bandaging was too tight, causing issues. The patient sued for malpractice.

In the case, the patient called a nurse who saw the surgeon destroy the post-op x-rays. The surgeon's attorney objected, and the question is about whether the nurse's testimony is admissible.

I remember that in evidence law, certain things are inadmissible if they're extrinsic evidence on collateral matters. So, what's a collateral matter? From what I recall, a collateral matter is something that's not directly relevant to the main issue but might be used to impeach a witness's credibility. But if it's collateral, you can't bring in extrinsic evidence—like other witnesses or documents—to prove it. You can only ask the witness about it on cross-examination.

In this case, the destroyed x-rays might be relevant because they could have shown whether the surgery was done correctly. If the surgeon destroyed them, maybe he was hiding something, implying negligence. But wait, the x-rays are post-op, so maybe they don't directly show the surgery itself. Or perhaps the x-rays are about the patient's condition after the surgery.

But the issue here is the nurse testifying about the surgeon destroying the x-rays. Is that testimony admissible?

So, the possible options. Let's look at the options given.

Option C says it's inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter. Hmm. So, if the matter is collateral, extrinsic evidence isn't allowed. What's the collateral matter here? The destruction of x-rays might be a collateral matter if the issue is about the surgeon's performance during the operation. Because the x-rays are post-op, maybe they don't directly relate to the surgery but to the aftercare. But wait, the bandaging was done by the surgeon, which caused the problem. So maybe the x-rays would have shown issues caused by the bandaging.

Wait, but the main claim is about the surgeon's bandaging causing pain and retarding recovery. The x-rays were taken post-op, so perhaps they could have shown complications from the bandaging. So, if the x-rays were destroyed, that could be relevant as evidence of the surgeon trying to hide something, which would relate to his negligence.

But the question is about whether the nurse's testimony about the destroyed x-rays is admissible. So, the testimony is about the surgeon destroying evidence. But is that a collateral matter?

I think that when a party destroys evidence, it's sometimes considered spoliation of evidence, which can lead to adverse inferences. But the rules around that can vary. However, in terms of admissibility, if the testimony is about a fact that's relevant but not directly about the main issue, it might be collateral.

Wait, but the main issue is the surgeon's negligence in bandaging. The destruction of x-rays is about possible evidence tampering, but maybe the x-rays themselves are not directly about the surgery but about the aftercare. So, perhaps the x-rays are a collateral matter because they don't directly prove the surgeon's negligence during the operation or bandaging. Instead, they might be more about the consequences after, but if the surgeon destroyed them, it could indicate he knew they were damaging.

But under evidence rules, when a witness testifies, the opposing party can attack their credibility. One way to impeach is by showing that the witness (here, the surgeon) has engaged in conduct that affects credibility, like destroying evidence. But extrinsic evidence on collateral matters is not admissible. So, if the surgeon testifies and denies any negligence, the patient might want to bring up the x-rays' destruction to impeach him. But they can only do this by asking the surgeon about it on cross, not by bringing in another witness (the nurse) to testify about it. Because that would be extrinsic evidence on a collateral matter.

So, in this case, the nurse's testimony is extrinsic evidence about the surgeon's destruction of the x-rays, which is a collateral matter because it goes to the surgeon's credibility rather than directly proving his negligence. Therefore, the testimony should be inadmissible.

Looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter. That seems to fit.

Wait, but another angle: if the x-rays were relevant evidence themselves, their destruction could be a separate issue. But the question is about the admissibility of the nurse's testimony about the destruction. So, the testimony is about the surgeon's action, which is a fact that the patient might argue shows consciousness of guilt, thereby making it relevant. But if it's a collateral matter, the extrinsic evidence isn't allowed.

Alternatively, if the x-rays themselves were not a collateral matter, then maybe the testimony is admissible. But I think the destruction of evidence is more about the surgeon's credibility, which is collateral. So, extrinsic evidence (like another witness) can't be used to prove it.

So, the correct answer should be option C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a nurse's testimony regarding a surgeon's destruction of post-operative x-rays in a malpractice case. The patient alleges that the surgeon's negligent bandaging caused unnecessary pain and delayed recovery. The nurse's testimony about the surgeon destroying the x-rays is challenged, and the issue is whether this testimony is admissible.

Under evidence law, extrinsic evidence on collateral matters is generally inadmissible. A collateral matter is one that does not directly prove or disprove the main issue in the case but may relate to a witness's credibility. Here, the main issue is the surgeon's alleged negligence in bandaging. The destruction of the x-rays, while potentially suggestive of the surgeon's consciousness of guilt, does not directly prove negligence. Instead, it pertains to the surgeon's credibility, making it a collateral matter.

Extrinsic evidence, such as the nurse's testimony, cannot be used to prove a collateral matter. If the patient wishes to impeach the surgeon's credibility by suggesting evidence tampering, this must be done through cross-examination of the surgeon, not through extrinsic evidence like the nurse's testimony. Therefore, the nurse's testimony is inadmissible because it constitutes extrinsic evidence on a collateral matter.
