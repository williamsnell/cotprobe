Okay, so I've got this question about the molar heat capacity of a diatomic gas at high temperatures. Hmm, I remember that heat capacity relates to how much energy a substance can hold. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

Alright, I recall that for gases, the heat capacity depends on whether they're diatomic or monatomic and whether they're at constant volume or pressure. Oh right, and it also matters if the temperature is high or low because that changes whether certain degrees of freedom are active.

Diatomic molecules have more degrees of freedom than monatomic. Monatomic gases, like helium, have only translational motion. So their heat capacities are lower. For monatomic ideal gases, I think the molar heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) is (3/2)R. Right, because each of the three translational degrees contributes (1/2)R each. So 3*(1/2 R) = 1.5 R, but wait, is that per mole?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for Cv, monatomic gases have (3/2)R. Because each translational direction (x, y, z) has 1/2 R each. So 3*(1/2 R) = 3/2 R, which is 1.5 R. So that's for monatomic.

Diatomic molecules, on the other hand, have more degrees of freedom. At high temperatures, I think all the modes are active. So what are the degrees of freedom for a diatomic? Let me list them out.

Translational: 3 degrees, right? Like moving in x, y, z directions.

Rotational: For a diatomic, if it's a rigid rotor, then rotation about the axis connecting the two atoms doesn't contribute much because the moment of inertia is really small. But rotations about the other two axes (perpendicular to the bond axis) do contribute. So that's 2 rotational degrees.

Wait, but wait, sometimes in textbooks, they treat diatomic as having 2 rotational degrees of freedom. So total so far: 3 translational + 2 rotational.

What about vibrational? Oh, right. At high temperatures, vibrational modes become active. But wait, do they contribute at "high" temperatures? Wait, the question says "limiting high-temperature", so I think that includes vibrational.

Wait, but wait again. The equipartition theorem says each quadratic degree of freedom contributes (1/2) R per mole. So for each active degree, you add 1/2 R to the heat capacity.

So let's count. For a diatomic molecule, how many degrees of freedom are there in total? A diatomic has 5 degrees of freedom when considering translation and rotation. Wait, no. Wait, a diatomic has 3 translational, 2 rotational (since rotation about the bond doesn't count), and then 2 vibrational? Wait, vibrational is two degrees: the bond can stretch and compress, but wait, no, each vibrational mode is two degrees, or is it one?

Wait, no, each vibrational mode is two degrees per molecule. Wait, no. Each vibrational mode contributes two degrees of freedom: kinetic and potential. So for each vibrational mode, you get two contributions, each (1/2 R), so total R per vibrational mode. But wait, diatomic has only one vibrational mode (along the bond axis), so that's 2 degrees.

So now, putting it all together: translational (3) + rotational (2) + vibrational (2) = 7 degrees of freedom. Each contributes (1/2 R), so 7*(1/2 R) = (7/2) R, which is 3.5 R. But wait, when does vibrational kick in?

Wait, the question says "limiting high-temperature", so I think this includes vibrational modes. But wait, in the case of diatomic gases, at high temperatures, the vibrational mode becomes active, but rotational modes are already active at lower temps. So the total would be 3 translational, 2 rotational, 2 vibrational: 7 degrees.

Wait, but wait, I remember that for diatomic gases, the molar specific heat at constant volume (Cv) is (5/2) R when considering only translational and rotational, and higher when vibrations are included.

Wait, let me think again. At room temperature, diatomic gases have Cv of (5/2) R. Because they have 5 active degrees: 3 translational, 2 rotational. Each contributes (1/2 R), so 5*(1/2 R)= (5/2) R, which is 2.5 R.

But the question is about high temperatures. At high temps, the vibrational modes start contributing. So each vibrational mode adds 2*(1/2 R) = R. So adding that to the previous 2.5 R, we get 3.5 R.

Wait, so the total would be 3.5 R as Cv.

Looking at the options: option I is 3.5 R. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Because I've also heard that the high-temperature limit for diatomic gases is (7/2) R, which is 3.5 R. So yes, that matches.

So the correct answer is I.

The limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume (\(C_V\)) of a gas-phase diatomic molecule can be determined by considering the degrees of freedom that contribute to energy storage. 

For a diatomic molecule, the degrees of freedom are as follows:
1. **Translational motion**: 3 degrees of freedom (motion in \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) directions).
2. **Rotational motion**: 2 degrees of freedom (rotation about two axes perpendicular to the bond axis).
3. **Vibrational motion**: 2 degrees of freedom (one kinetic and one potential, along the bond axis).

At high temperatures, all these degrees of freedom are active. According to the equipartition theorem, each quadratic degree of freedom contributes \((1/2)R\) to the molar heat capacity. Therefore, the total contribution is:

\[
C_V = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2}R + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}R + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}R = \frac{3}{2}R + R + R = \frac{7}{2}R = 3.5R.
\]

Thus, the limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume for a diatomic gas is \(3.5R\).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: 3.5R**
