Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The setup is an electrical transmission line strung between two towers 200 meters apart. The mass of the line is 40 kg. A lineman strikes the line, creating a wave that travels to the other tower, reflects, and comes back. The total time measured for this round trip is 10 seconds. I need to find the tension force in the wire.

Hmm, I remember that waves on a string or wire depend on the tension and the mass per unit length. The wave speed equation is something like v = sqrt(T/μ), where T is tension and μ is the linear mass density.

So the first thing I should find is the mass per unit length, μ. The total mass is 40 kg and the length is 200 meters. So μ = mass/length = 40 kg / 200 m. Let me calculate that: 40 divided by 200 is 0.2 kg/m. So μ is 0.2 kg/m.

Next, I need to find the wave speed. The wave travels from one tower to the other, which is 200 m, reflects, and comes back. So the total distance the wave travels is 200 m there and 200 m back, making it 400 meters total. The time taken for this is 10 seconds. So the speed v is distance divided by time: 400 m / 10 s = 40 m/s.

Wait, that seems a bit high for a wave on a wire, but maybe it's correct. Let me think, 40 m/s is pretty fast, but depending on the tension, it could be possible.

Now, using the wave speed formula, v = sqrt(T/μ). I can plug in the values I have. We have v = 40 m/s and μ = 0.2 kg/m.

So rearranging the formula to solve for T: T = v² * μ.

Calculating that, v squared is 40^2 = 1600. Multiply by μ (0.2 kg/m): 1600 * 0.2 = 320. So T is 320 N. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3.2 × 10^2 N, which is 320 N. So that would be the answer.

Wait a second, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check.

Total distance: 200 m each way, so 400 m total. Time is 10 s, so speed is 400/10 = 40 m/s. Yes.

μ is 40 kg / 200 m = 0.2 kg/m. Correct.

Then T = (40)^2 * 0.2 = 1600 * 0.2 = 320 N. That's 3.2e2 N, which is option D.

I think that's right. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So the tension must be 320 N.

To determine the tension force in the wire, we start by analyzing the given parameters:

1. **Mass per unit length (μ):**  
   The total mass of the wire is 40 kg, and its length is 200 m. Thus,  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{length}} = \frac{40 \, \text{kg}}{200 \, \text{m}} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/m}.
   \]

2. **Wave speed (v):**  
   The wave travels a total distance of \(200 \, \text{m} + 200 \, \text{m} = 400 \, \text{m}\) (to the other tower and back). The elapsed time is 10 s, so the wave speed is:  
   \[
   v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{400 \, \text{m}}{10 \, \text{s}} = 40 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

3. **Tension force (T):**  
   Using the wave speed formula \(v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}\), we rearrange to solve for \(T\):  
   \[
   T = v^2 \cdot \mu.
   \]  
   Substituting \(v = 40 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(\mu = 0.2 \, \text{kg/m}\):  
   \[
   T = (40)^2 \cdot 0.2 = 1600 \cdot 0.2 = 320 \, \text{N}.
   \]

Thus, the tension force in the wire is \(320 \, \text{N}\), which corresponds to option **D** (\(3.2 \times 10^2 \, \text{N}\)).
