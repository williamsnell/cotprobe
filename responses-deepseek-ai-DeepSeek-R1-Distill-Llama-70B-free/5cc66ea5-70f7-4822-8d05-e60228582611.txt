Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the increase in enthalpy for 100 grams of H₂O going from ice at -10°C to liquid water at +15°C. Hmm, I remember that when a substance changes temperature or phase, we have to calculate the heat involved in each step and then sum them up.

First, I think the process has a few stages. The ice is at -10°C, so it's solid. Then, it needs to warm up to 0°C, melt into liquid water, and then the liquid water needs to warm up from 0°C to 15°C. Oh wait, right, so three steps: heating the ice, melting it, and heating the liquid.

But wait, the problem gives molar heat capacities for different phases and temperatures. Let me look at the table again. The ice (solid H₂O) has a heat capacity of 33.30 J/mol·K at 239 K and 37.78 J/mol·K at 271 K. Since -10°C is 263 K (because 273 -10=263), which is between 239 and 271. Hmm, but maybe I can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the average or maybe it's a typo, but perhaps I should use the 37.78 value because it's closer to 271 K, but wait, 263 is closer to 271 than 239? 271-263 is 8 K, while 263-239 is 24 K. So 263 is closer to 239? Hmm, maybe I should calculate using the specific heat at 271 K, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the data is just for specific phases, and I can use the one that's relevant for the temperature range.

Wait, the ice is at -10°C which is 263 K. There's a value for H₂O(s) at 271 K, which is 0°C. Maybe I can use that. Or maybe I can use the 33.30 J/mol·K because it's the lower temperature. Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the 37.78 J/mol·K for the solid because that's the value given for 271 K, which is the melting point. Maybe for heating the ice, I can use that.

Wait, but for the temperature change from 263 K (-10°C) to 273 K (0°C), which is a 10 K increase. So the first step is heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C. The heat for that step would be mass * specific heat * delta T. But wait, I need to do this in moles.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The steps are:

1. Heating ice from -10°C to 0°C (temperature increase of 10°C)
2. Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C
3. Heating the water from 0°C to 15°C (temperature increase of 15°C)

So each step contributes to the total enthalpy change.

First, I need to calculate the moles of H₂O. 100 grams. Molar mass of H₂O is 18 g/mol. So moles = 100 g /18 g/mol ≈ 5.5556 moles.

Step 1: Heating ice from -10°C to 0°C.

The specific heat of ice (solid) at 271 K is 37.78 J/mol·K. So delta T is 10 K.

The heat for this step is moles * C * delta T.

So 5.5556 mol * 37.78 J/mol·K * 10 K = Let me compute that.

37.78 *10 = 377.8, then *5.5556 ≈ 5.5556 *377.8 ≈ ?

377.8 * 5 = 1889, 377.8 *0.5556 ≈ 377.8 * 0.5 is 188.9, 377.8 *0.0556≈ 21. So total ≈ 1889 + 188.9 +21≈2100 J. So approximately 2100 J for step 1.

Step 2: Melting the ice at 0°C.

The molar heat of fusion is given as 6.02 kJ/mol. So per mole, it's 6020 J.

So 5.5556 mol *6020 J/mol = 5.5556 *6020 ≈ Let's compute:

5 *6020 =30100, 0.5556 *6020 ≈ 3344. So total ≈30100+3344=33444 J, so approximately 33444 J.

Step3: Heating the water from 0°C to 15°C.

The specific heat of liquid water at 273 K is 75.86 J/mol·K. The delta T is 15 K.

So heat is 5.5556 mol *75.86 J/mol·K *15 K.

75.86 *15 = 1138, then 5.5556 *1138 ≈ ?

5 *1138=5690, 0.5556 *1138 ≈ 632. So total ≈5690 +632 ≈ 6322 J?

Wait, wait, 5.5556 * 1138:

Let me compute 5.5556 * 1000 =5555.6, 5.5556 *138 = let's compute 5 *138=690, 0.5556 *138≈76.6. So 690+76.6=766.6.

So 5555.6 +766.6=6322.2 J.

So step3 is approximately 6322 J.

Now sum all steps:

Step1: 2100 J

Step2:33444 J

Step3:6322 J

Total: 2100 +33444 =35544 +6322=41866 J.

Wait, 2100 +33444 =35544, plus 6322 gives 35544+6322=41866 J.

Looking at the options, option H is 41,800 J. Which is very close. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, step1: 5.5556 *37.78 *10.

Let me compute 37.78 *10 =377.8.

5.5556 *377.8 = let's compute:

5*377.8=1889

0.5556 *377.8 ≈ 0.5*377.8=188.9, 0.0556*377.8≈21. So total 1889+188.9+21=2100.9 J.

Step2:5.5556 *6020= 5.5556*6.02e3 = let's compute:

5 *6.02e3=30100, 0.5556*6.02e3=0.5556*6020= 3344. So 30100+3344=33444 J.

Step3:5.5556*75.86*15.

75.86 *15=1138. So 5.5556 *1138.

Breaking it down:

5 *1138=5690, 0.5556 *1138= approximately 632. So total 5690 +632=6322 J.

So 2100.9 +33444=35544.9 +6322≈41866.9 J.

So approximately 41,867 J. The closest option is H:41,800 J.

Wait, but let me check if I used the correct specific heats.

Wait, in the table, ice at 271 K is 37.78 J/mol·K, which is 0°C. So for heating ice from -10°C (263 K) to 0°C (273 K), delta T is 10 K. So using 37.78 J/(mol·K) is correct.

For liquid water, at 273 K, the heat capacity is 75.86 J/mol·K. So for heating from 0°C to 15°C, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps for heating the ice, they use a different specific heat. Wait, the table has ice at 239 K (which is -34°C) as 33.30 J/mol·K and at 271 K (0°C) as 37.78. So from -10°C to 0°C, the specific heat is probably somewhere in between. But the problem probably expects us to use the value given at 271 K for that phase.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific heat for ice is considered as 37.78 J/mol·K for the calculation. So I think the initial calculation is correct.

So the total is approximately 41,867 J, so 41,800 J is the closest option, which is H.

To calculate the increase in enthalpy for 100 g of H₂O going from ice at -10°C to liquid water at +15°C, the process involves three steps:

1. **Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C**:  
   The specific heat capacity of ice (H₂O(s)) at 271 K is 37.78 J/mol·K. The temperature change (ΔT) is 10 K. The moles of H₂O are calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2\text{O} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{100}{18} \approx 5.5556 \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   The heat for this step is:  
   \[
   q_1 = n \cdot C \cdot \Delta T = 5.5556 \cdot 37.78 \cdot 10 \approx 2100.9 \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Melting the ice at 0°C**:  
   The molar heat of fusion of ice is given as 6.02 kJ/mol (6020 J/mol). The heat for this step is:  
   \[
   q_2 = n \cdot \Delta H_{\text{fusion}} = 5.5556 \cdot 6020 \approx 33444 \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 15°C**:  
   The specific heat capacity of liquid water (H₂O(l)) at 273 K is 75.86 J/mol·K. The temperature change (ΔT) is 15 K. The heat for this step is:  
   \[
   q_3 = n \cdot C \cdot \Delta T = 5.5556 \cdot 75.86 \cdot 15 \approx 6322 \, \text{J}
   \]

**Total enthalpy change**:  
\[
q_{\text{total}} = q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 2100.9 + 33444 + 6322 \approx 41866.9 \, \text{J}
\]

The closest option to the calculated value is **41,800 J**, which corresponds to option **H**.
