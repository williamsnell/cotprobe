Okay, so I've got this problem about the rotational partition function for two different nitrogen molecules. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that the rotational partition function is a statistical mechanics concept, right? It's used to determine the distribution of rotational energy states in a molecule at a given temperature.

So the molecules in question are ^14N_2 and ^14N^15N. Both have the same internuclear distance of 0.1095 nm. I think the key here is to calculate the rotational partition function Q_rot for each.

I recall that the formula for the rotational partition function for a diatomic molecule is Q_rot = (8π²/(σ h²)) * (2I k T)^(1/2), where I is the moment of inertia, σ is the symmetry number, h is Planck's constant, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. Another version I remember is Q_rot = (T / Θ_rot)^(3/2) * something. Oh right, Θ_rot is the rotational temperature, given by Θ_rot = (h²/(8π² I k)). So putting it all together, Q_rot for a diatomic is (8π² (k T)/(σ h²))^(3/2) * I think, but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So, first, I need to calculate the moments of inertia for both molecules. Let's see.

For ^14N_2, each atom is ^14N. The atomic mass of ^14N is 14 u. So the reduced mass μ1 is (14 * 14) / (14 +14) = (196)/(28) = 7 u? Wait, because μ = (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2). Since both are 14, μ = (14*14)/(28) ) = (196)/(28) = 7 u. So μ1 =7 u.

For ^14N^15N: the masses are 14 and 15 u. So μ2 = (14 *15)/(14+15) = (210)/(29) ≈ 7.241 u.

But wait, units matter here. I need to convert these to kilograms because the other constants are in SI units.

Wait, 1 u is 1 atomic mass unit, which is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ1 =7 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u = 1.16235e-26 kg. Similarly, μ2 is approximately 7.241 u * 1.6605e-27 = let's calculate that: 7.241 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 1.203e-26 kg.

The bond length r is given as 0.1095 nm, which is 0.1095e-9 meters.

So I for each molecule is I = μ r².

Calculating I1 for ^14N_2: I1 = (1.16235e-26 kg) * (0.1095e-9 m)^2.

Let's compute that. 0.1095e-9 squared is (approx) 1.196e-20 m². So I1 = 1.16235e-26 kg * 1.196e-20 m² = approximately 1.390e-46 kg m².

Similarly, I2 for ^14N^15N: I2 = (1.203e-26 kg) * (0.1095e-9)^2 = 1.203e-26 * 1.196e-20 = approx 1.437e-46 kg m².

Wait, but wait, the bond length is the same for both, right? So the difference is only in the reduced mass. So I1 is smaller than I2 because μ1 is smaller. Wait no, μ2 is larger, so I2 is larger than I1. Because I is proportional to μ.

So now, the rotational temperature Θ_rot is given by h²/(8 π² I k). So for each molecule, Θ_rot is inversely proportional to I. So for ^14N_2, I1 is smaller, so Θ_rot1 is larger. Because Θ_rot = h²/(8 π² I k).

Wait, if I is larger, then Θ_rot is smaller. For the same T, if Θ_rot is smaller, then T/Θ_rot is larger. So in the partition function, Q_rot is proportional to (T/Θ_rot)^(something).

Wait, but let me get the exact formula for Q_rot. For a diatomic, the high-temperature (classical) rotational partition function is given by Q_rot = (8 π² (I k T)/(σ h²))^(3/2) )^(1/2? Wait, no, for linear molecules, the rotational partition function is Q_rot = (8 π² I k T/(σ h²))^(1/2) * (k T/(h c)) )? Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with the translational or something else.

Wait, no, the rotational partition function for a diatomic is given by:

Q_rot = (sqrt( (8 π² I k T) / (σ h²) )) * (k T / (h c)) )? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's just Q_rot = (8 π² I k T/(σ h²))^(1/2) * (something else?).

Wait, no, I think for a diatomic molecule, the rotational partition function in the high-temperature limit (which is usually valid at room temperature) is:

Q_rot = ( (8 π² (I k T) )/(σ h²) )^(1/2) * (1/ (2 I) ) )? No, perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think I'm confusing it with the expression for the rotational energy levels. Let me think. For a diatomic, the energy levels are quantized as E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number.

The rotational partition function is the sum over all J of (2J+1) exp( - E_J/(k T) ). But at high temperatures, this sum can be approximated by an integral, leading to Q_rot ≈ (8 π² (I k T)/(h² σ))^(1/2) ) * (1/(2)).

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me be precise. From what I remember, the rotational partition function for a diatomic molecule is:

Q_rot = (sqrt( (8 π² I k T)/(σ h²) )) * (k T / (h c)) )^(something), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula involving the rotational temperature Θ_rot. So Θ_rot is defined as (h²)/(8 π² I k), so I = h²/(8 π² k Θ_rot).

Then, the rotational partition function can be expressed as Q_rot = (T/(Θ_rot))^(3/2) * sqrt( (8 π^2)/(σ) ) * something. Hmm, I'm not recalling correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Q_rot = (sqrt( (8 π² I k T)/(σ h²) )) ). Let me think about the units. I has units of kg m². h has units J s, which is kg m²/s. So h² has kg² m^4 /s².

So (I k T) has units (kg m²)(J/K * K) )= kg m² J. J is kg m²/s², so I k T is kg m² * kg m²/s² = kg² m^4 /s².

h² has kg² m^4 /s², so (I k T)/(h²) is dimensionless, which makes sense because it's inside a square root. So sqrt( (8 π² I k T)/(σ h²) ) would be dimensionless.

So Q_rot for a diatomic is Q_rot = sqrt( (8 π² I k T) / (σ h²) ) * something? Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Wait, another approach: The moment of inertia I is in kg m².

The general formula for the rotational partition function (for a diatomic) is:

Q_rot = ( (8 π² (I k T) )/(σ h²) )^(1/2) ) * ( (2 I )/(h^2) )^(1/2) ) ? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Q_rot = ( (8 π² I k T )/(σ h²) )^(1/2) * (k T/(h c)) ), but I'm not sure where the c comes from.

Wait, no, perhaps it's simpler. I think the formula is Q_rot = (sqrt( (8 π² I k T) / (σ h²) )) * (something), but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the formula in terms of Θ_rot.

Alternatively, since both molecules have the same bond length, but different reduced masses, their moments of inertia will differ. The one with the larger reduced mass will have a larger I, which affects Θ_rot and thus Q_rot.

Wait, let me get the formula correctly. From my notes, the rotational partition function for a diatomic molecule is given by:

Q_rot = ( (8 π² (I k T) )/(σ h²) )^(1/2) ) × ( (2 I )/(h²) )^(1/2) ) × something? No, perhaps it's a single term.

Wait, another approach. For a diatomic molecule, the rotational partition function in the high temperature limit (which is usually valid for T much larger than Θ_rot) is approximately:

Q_rot ≈ ( (8 π² I k T )/(σ h²) )^(1/2 )

So that's the formula I'll use.

So now, I can compute this for each molecule. Let me compute the constants first.

Given:
h = Planck's constant = 6.62607015e-34 J s
k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.380649e-23 J/K
T = 298 K
r = 0.1095 nm = 0.1095e-9 m
For ^14N_2: μ1 = 7 u = 7 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 1.16235e-26 kg
I1 = μ1 r² = 1.16235e-26 kg * (0.1095e-9 m)^2
Similarly for ^14N^15N: μ2 ≈7.241 u → 1.203e-26 kg
I2 = μ2 r².

But wait, let me compute I1 and I2 more accurately.

Compute I1:
r = 0.1095e-9 m
r² = (0.1095e-9)^2 = (0.1095)^2 * 1e-18 = 0.01197 * 1e-18 = 1.197e-20 m²
I1 = μ1 * r² = (7 u) * (1.6605e-27 kg/u) * (1.197e-20 m²)
Wait, no: μ1 is already in kg, so 1.16235e-26 kg * 1.197e-20 m² = 1.390e-46 kg m².

Similarly, I2 = μ2 * r² = 1.203e-26 kg * 1.197e-20 m² ≈ 1.437e-46 kg m².

Now, σ is the symmetry number. For N2, which is a homonuclear diatomic, the symmetry number is 2. Because for a homonuclear diatomic, rotating by 180 degrees brings the molecule into itself. But wait, for heteronuclear diatomic like ^14N^15N, the symmetry number is 1, because swapping the atoms (which are different) would not result in the same configuration.

So σ for ^14N_2 is 2, and for ^14N^15N is 1.

So now, plug into Q_rot for each.

Compute Q_rot for ^14N_2:

Q_rot1 = sqrt( (8 π² I1 k T) / (σ h²) )

Plugging in the numbers:

I1 = 1.390e-46 kg m²
σ = 2
k = 1.38e-23 J/K
T = 298 K
h = 6.626e-34 J s

Compute numerator: 8 * π² * I1 * k * T

8 * (pi^2) ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568
78.9568 * I1 (1.390e-46) = 78.9568 * 1.390e-46 ≈ 1.098e-44
Multiply by k (1.38e-23) → 1.098e-44 * 1.38e-23 = 1.516e-67
Multiply by T (298) → 1.516e-67 * 298 ≈ 4.519e-65

Denominator: σ h² = 2 * (6.626e-34)^2
(6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67
Multiply by 2 → 8.78e-67

So the ratio is 4.519e-65 / 8.78e-67 ≈ 51.5

Now take the square root: sqrt(51.5) ≈ 7.18

So Q_rot1 ≈ 7.18. Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the order of 1e23 or similar. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Because 7 is way too small.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate with more attention.

Compute numerator: 8 * pi^2 ≈78.9568
Multiply by I1: 78.9568 * 1.390e-46 = 1.098e-44 (correct)
Multiply by k: 1.098e-44 * 1.38e-23 = let's compute 1.098 * 1.38 ≈ 1.515, exponents -44 + (-23) = -67 → 1.515e-67
Multiply by T=298: 1.515e-67 *298 = approx 4.515e-65 (correct)

Denominator: 2 * (6.626e-34)^2 = 2*(4.39e-67) = 8.78e-67

So numerator / denominator: 4.515e-65 / 8.78e-67 = (4.515 /8.78 ) * 1e2 → approximately 0.514 * 100 = 51.4

sqrt(51.4) ≈7.17

Wait, that's just 7.17, but the options are way larger. So I'm missing something. Oh wait, I think the formula I used is wrong. Because the partition function can't be this small. I must have used the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Q_rot = (sqrt( (8 π² I k T) / (σ h²) )) * (something else). Oh, wait, perhaps I forgot the factor involving the rotational constant or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Q_rot = ( (8 π² I k T) / (σ h²) )^(1/2) × (k T / (h c)) ), but I'm not sure where the c comes from.

Wait, no, perhaps I forgot that the formula is actually Q_rot = (sqrt( (8 π² I k T)/(σ h²) )) × (something else). Alternatively, perhaps it's (8 π² I k T/(σ h²))^(1/2) multiplied by another term.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the rotational temperature. The rotational partition function can be written as Q_rot = (T/(Θ_rot))^(1/2) × (other terms).

Wait, Θ_rot = h²/(8 π² I k). So I can write I = h²/(8 π² k Θ_rot).

Then, substituting into the formula for Q_rot, I get:

Q_rot = sqrt( (8 π² (h²/(8 π² k Θ_rot)) k T ) / σ h² ) )

Simplify:

Inside the sqrt: (8 π² * h²/(8 π² k Θ_rot) *k T ) / (σ h² )

The 8 π² cancels with denominator, h² cancels with numerator. So:

= sqrt( ( (h² * k T )/( Θ_rot * h² * σ )) )
Wait, let me compute step by step:

(8 π² * I * k T) / (σ h²) = (8 π² * (h²/(8 π² k Θ_rot)) ) * k T ) / (σ h² )

Simplify numerator:

8 π² * (h²/(8 π² k Θ_rot)) * k T = (h² k T )/( Θ_rot )

So the entire expression becomes (h² k T )/( Θ_rot σ h² ) ) = (k T) / (Θ_rot σ )

So Q_rot = sqrt( (k T)/(Θ_rot σ) ) = sqrt( T/(Θ_rot σ) * k )

Wait, but this doesn't seem right. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Q_rot = (sqrt( (8 π² I k T) / (σ h²) )) × (something else). Maybe I missed a factor involving the Avogadro's number or something else, but I don't think so because the partition function is per molecule, not molar.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the moments of inertia and see what value I get, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach: compute Θ_rot for each molecule, and then compute Q_rot as (T/Θ_rot)^(3/2) multiplied by a constant.

Wait, the rotational partition function for a diatomic is:

Q_rot = ( (8 π² (k T I ) )/(σ h²) )^(1/2 )

But wait, this is the same as before. So perhaps the mistake is that I calculated only the square root of the ratio, but that's just the leading term. Wait, no, the formula is
