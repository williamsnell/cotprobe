Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about vapor pressure of solvents in a mixture. Hmm, I remember that when two solvents form an ideal solution, their vapor pressures follow Raoult's Law. Right, Raoult's Law states that the partial vapor pressure of each component is equal to its mole fraction in the solution multiplied by its pure vapor pressure.

So, the problem gives me two solvents, A and B. Solvent A has a vapor pressure of 345 torr, and solvent B's is 213 torr. The question asks for the vapor pressure of a mixture where the mole fraction of A is 0.285.

Wait, wait. Wait a second—is the question asking for the total vapor pressure of the mixture or just that of solvent A?

Oh, right. The total vapor pressure of the solution would be the sum of the partial pressures of both A and B. Because each contributes to the total vapor pressure.

So the mole fraction of A is 0.285, which means the mole fraction of B would be 1 - 0.285 = 0.715. Because the mole fractions add up to 1.

Now, using Raoult's Law, the partial pressure of A (P_A) is mole fraction of A multiplied by pure A's vapor pressure. So P_A = 0.285 * 345. Let me calculate that. 0.285 times 345... Let's see, 0.3 times 345 is 103.5, but since it's 0.285, subtract 0.015 times 345. 0.015 * 345 is 5.175, so 103.5 -5.175 = 98.325 torr.

Similarly, the partial pressure of B (P_B) is mole fraction of B (0.715) times pure B's vapor pressure (213 torr). So 0.715 * 213. Let me compute that. 0.7 * 213 is 149.1, and 0.015 * 213 is 3.195. So adding them together: 0.715 is 0.7 + 0.015, so 149.1 + 3.195 = 152.295 torr.

Wait, no. Wait, that's not right. Because 0.715 is 0.7 plus 0.015? No, wait, 0.715 is 0.7 + 0.015? No, 0.7 is 0.700, so 0.715 is 0.7 + 0.015. Oh wait, no, that's not correct. 0.715 is 0.7 + 0.015? No, wait. 0.7 is 0.700, and 0.715 is 0.700 + 0.015, right. So 0.7 * 213 is 149.1, and 0.015 * 213 is 3.195. So 149.1 + 3.195 equals 152.295 torr for P_B.

So the total vapor pressure P_total is P_A + P_B. That's 98.325 + 152.295 = let's add them. 98 + 152 is 250, and 0.325 + 0.295 is 0.62. So total is 250.62 torr. Wait, but looking at the options, B is 258, E is 251, etc. Hmm, so my calculation here is getting about 250.62, which is approximately 251. So option E is 251 torr.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up somewhere.

Calculating P_A again: 0.285 * 345.

Let me do it step by step. 345 * 0.2 is 69. 345 * 0.08 is 27.6. 345 * 0.005 is 1.725. So adding those together: 69 +27.6 is 96.6, plus 1.725 equals 98.325. That's correct.

P_B: 0.715 * 213. Let's compute 213 * 0.7 = 149.1. 213 * 0.015 = 3.195. So 149.1 + 3.195 = 152.295.

Total P is 98.325 + 152.295. Let's add:

98.325
+152.295
= 250.62 torr.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 251 torr. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Does it ask for the total vapor pressure, or is it perhaps asking for the vapor pressure of solvent A only? Because solvent A's mole fraction is given.

Oh, the question says "the vapor pressure of a mixture"—which generally refers to the total vapor pressure. So I think my approach is correct. So the total is approximately 250.62, so 251 is the right choice.

To determine the vapor pressure of the mixture, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the total vapor pressure of an ideal solution is the sum of the partial pressures of its components. The partial pressure of each component is given by the product of its mole fraction in the solution and its pure vapor pressure.

### Given Data:
- Vapor pressure of pure solvent A: \( P_A^{\text{pure}} = 345 \, \text{torr} \)
- Vapor pressure of pure solvent B: \( P_B^{\text{pure}} = 213 \, \text{torr} \)
- Mole fraction of solvent A in the mixture: \( x_A = 0.285 \)
- Mole fraction of solvent B in the mixture: \( x_B = 1 - x_A = 0.715 \)

### Step 1: Calculate the partial pressures
Using Raoult's Law:
\[
P_A = x_A \cdot P_A^{\text{pure}} = 0.285 \cdot 345 = 98.325 \, \text{torr}
\]
\[
P_B = x_B \cdot P_B^{\text{pure}} = 0.715 \cdot 213 = 152.295 \, \text{torr}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total vapor pressure
The total vapor pressure of the mixture is:
\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_A + P_B = 98.325 + 152.295 = 250.62 \, \text{torr}
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated total vapor pressure (\( 250.62 \, \text{torr} \)) is closest to \( 251 \, \text{torr} \), which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: **E**
