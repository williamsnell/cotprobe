Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the density of a block of wood. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me the weight and the dimensions. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? But wait, the weight is given in kg, and the dimensions are in cm, m, and another m. Oh, right, I should probably convert everything to the same units to make it easier.

Wait, the weight is 750 kg. Oh wait, wait a second. Because weight is a force, and mass is what's used in density. Oh, but wait, in everyday terms, people often use weight and mass interchangeably. So in this context, I think they're treating the 750 kg as the mass, not the force. So I can proceed with that.

So the formula for density is density equals mass divided by volume. So I need to calculate the volume first using the dimensions given. The dimensions are 25 cm × 0.10 m × 50.0 m. Oh wait, the units aren't all the same. I should convert them all to meters or all to centimeters. Let me think which is easier.

Centimeters might be easier because when I calculate the volume in cm³, I can then convert to grams per cc since 1 g is roughly 1 cm³ of water. Right, because 1 g/cm³ is the density of water. So let me convert each dimension to centimeters.

Wait, 25 cm is already in cm. 0.10 m is 10 cm because 1 m is 100 cm, so 0.1 m is 10 cm. And 50.0 m is 5000 cm, since 50 times 100 is 5000. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 m is 100 cm. So 50 m is 50 * 100 = 5000 cm. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.1 m is 10 cm because 0.1 *100=10. So 50 m would be 50 *100=5000 cm. Oh wait, no, 50 meters is 50 *100 cm = 5000 cm. So yeah.

So the volume is length × width × height. So 25 cm × 10 cm × 5000 cm. Let me calculate that. 25 *10 is 250, and 250 *5000 is... let's see, 25 *5000 is 125,000, but wait, 250 *5000. Oh, 25 *5000 = 125,000, but since it's 250, that's 2.5 times 100,000? Maybe more accurately: 25 * 10 = 250. 250 *5000 = 1,250,000 cm³. Because 5000 * 250 is 1,250,000.

So the volume is 1,250,000 cm³. Now the mass is 750 kg. Wait, but 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 750 kg is 750,000 grams. Because 750 *1000 = 750,000 grams.

So density is mass over volume. So 750,000 grams divided by 1,250,000 cm³. Let me compute that. 750,000 / 1,250,000 = ?

Let me simplify. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 250,000. 750,000 ÷ 250,000 is 3. 1,250,000 ÷250,000 is 5. So 3/5 is 0.6. So the density is 0.6 g/cm³.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.60 g/cc. So the answer should be C.

To calculate the density of the block of wood, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the dimensions to the same unit
The dimensions of the block are given as \( 25 \, \text{cm} \times 0.10 \, \text{m} \times 50.0 \, \text{m} \). Converting all dimensions to centimeters:

- \( 25 \, \text{cm} \) (already in cm)
- \( 0.10 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( 50.0 \, \text{m} = 5000 \, \text{cm} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the volume
The volume of the block is:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 25 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 5000 \, \text{cm} = 1,250,000 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 3: Convert the mass to grams
The mass of the block is given as \( 750 \, \text{kg} \). Converting to grams:

\[
750 \, \text{kg} = 750 \times 1000 = 750,000 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the density
Using the formula for density:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{750,000 \, \text{g}}{1,250,000 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.6 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer
The density of the block of wood is \( 0.60 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
