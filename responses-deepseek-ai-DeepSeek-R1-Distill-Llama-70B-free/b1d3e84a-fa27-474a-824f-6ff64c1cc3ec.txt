Okay, so I've got this question about the binary number system, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking about the first digit (bit) from the right to left being called what. Hmm.

Let me think, in binary, each digit is called a bit, right? And when we write binary numbers, we arrange them from the rightmost bit being the least significant. Oh wait, significant bit termsâ€”like LSB and MSB. So the rightmost bit is the least significant bit, and the leftmost is the most significant.

So the question is about the first digit from right to left. Wait, right to left means starting from the right end. So the first bit you encounter when moving right to left would be the rightmost bit. That's the least significant bit. So the term for that is LSB.

Looking at the options, option C is LSB. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me think of a binary number, say 1010. The bits are 1, 0, 1, 0 from left to right. But when we count from right to left, the first bit is the rightmost, which is 0 in this case. That's the least significant bit because it's 2^0 position, right? So yes, the first digit from right is LSB.

The first digit (bit) from right to left in a binary number is called the Least Significant Bit (LSB). This is because it represents the smallest value in the binary number, corresponding to \(2^0\). 

Option C: LSB, Least Significant Bit.

Answer: C
