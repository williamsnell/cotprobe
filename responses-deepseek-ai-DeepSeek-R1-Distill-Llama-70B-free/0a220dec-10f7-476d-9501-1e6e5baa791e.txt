Question:

A condominium development consists of two buildings, one with balconies attached to each unit, and one withno balconies. For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?

Options:

A: Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.
B: No, because the amendment was promptly recorded and is legally binding.
C: Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.
D: No, because the association is acting in the best interests of child safety.
E: No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.
F: No, because the association has the right to approve all sales.
G: No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about fair housing laws and condominium associations. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through step by step.

The scenario is about a condo development with two buildings. One has balconies, and the other doesn't. The condo association amended their covenants to prohibit selling balcony units to families with minor children. They did this because of safety concerns. The amendment doesn't affect existing families with kids in the balcony units. It was recorded promptly, which I think means it's properly filed and maybe enforceable.

The association also has a covenant that all sales must be approved by them. So, when an owner of a balcony unit contracts to sell to a family with minor children, the association steps in and says they can't buy because of the kids. They mentioned other units without balconies are available. The buyers then complain to a fair housing agency, saying this violates federal laws.

The question is whether there's reasonable cause to believe a violation occurred. So, I need to recall what the fair housing laws say. I remember that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on certain protected characteristics, which include race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial status. Familial status includes having children under 18 in the household.

So, the condo association is singling out families with minor children for the balcony units. But wait, they allowed existing families to stay. However, the issue is about future sales. The association is trying to prevent new families with children from buying balcony units, directing them to non-balcony buildings instead.

Is this legal? Well, under the FHA, it's illegal to discriminate by imposing different terms or conditions based on familial status. Even if the intent is safety, the effect might still be discriminatory. For example, if the rule has a disparate impact on families with children, it could be a problem unless it's necessary for safety and there's no less discriminatory alternative.

I think the FHA does allow some exceptions, like for housing intended for older persons, but that's not the case here. The association is targeting all families with minor children, regardless of age. So, even if they have safety concerns, the way they're handling it might not be permissible.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes, because families with children are already living there. Well, that might show that it's not a complete ban, but the rule still applies to new sales. So existing families aren't affected, but future ones are. This could still be discrimination.

B: No, because the amendment was recorded and is binding. But being recorded doesn't make it legal if it violates fair housing laws. So this option is probably incorrect.

C: Yes, because they're segregating families within the development. This makes sense because the FHA prohibits segregation based on protected classes. By forcing families to certain buildings, they might be in violation.

D: No, because it's for child safety. Intent might not matter if the policy is discriminatory. So even if they mean well, it's still a problem.

E: No, because they can buy non-balcony units. But this doesn't solve the discrimination; it's still a restriction based on having children. So the fact that other options are available doesn't make it okay.

F: No, because the association can approve sales. The approval power is there, but using it to discriminate is the issue. So this option is wrong.

G: No, because it's based on safety. Similar to D, the reason might not justify the discrimination. Safety concerns could be addressed in less restrictive ways, perhaps.

So, the key points are that the FHA prohibits discrimination based on familial status, and the condo's rule does that. Even if there's a safety reason, the rule might not be legally justifiable because it's a blanket prohibition against families with children in certain units. They might need a more narrowly tailored approach.

Therefore, the answer should be either A, C, or maybe another option. Wait, option C says families can't be segregated. That seems to fit because they're forcing families into certain buildings, which is a form of segregation.

Alternatively, option A says yes because families are already there. But the presence of existing families doesn't necessarily make the rule illegal; it's about new sales. So maybe C is better.

Wait, but does the rule create a segregation? If they can't buy balcony units, they're confined to non-balcony units. So, it's like separating them, which is prohibited. So yes, option C makes sense.

Another angle: the rule applies to all future sales, so it's a policy that excludes families from certain housing. That's a clear violation under FHA unless an exception applies. Since there's no exception here, the condo association is in the wrong.

So the answer is C: Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the development.

The Fair Housing Act (FHA) prohibits discrimination based on familial status, which includes households with minor children. In this case, the condominium association amended its covenants to prohibit the sale of balcony units to families with minor children, citing safety concerns. While the amendment allows existing families with children to remain, it restricts future sales to such families, effectively segregating them into non-balcony units. This creates a disparate impact on families with children, which violates the FHA's prohibition against segregation based on protected characteristics.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The presence of existing families with children in balcony units does not justify the discriminatory restriction on future sales.
- **B**: Incorrect. Recording the amendment does not make it legally binding if it violates fair housing laws.
- **C**: Correct. The amendment segregates families with children by restricting them to non-balcony units, which is prohibited under the FHA.
- **D**: Incorrect. While safety concerns may be a valid reason, the blanket prohibition on families with children is not a narrowly tailored solution and constitutes discrimination.
- **E**: Incorrect. Allowing families with children to purchase non-balcony units does not remedy the discriminatory restriction on balcony units.
- **F**: Incorrect. The association's approval power does not justify discriminatory practices.
- **G**: Incorrect. Safety concerns, while legitimate, do not excuse the violation of fair housing laws through segregation.

The amendment violates federal fair housing laws by segregating families with children, making **C** the correct answer.

C
