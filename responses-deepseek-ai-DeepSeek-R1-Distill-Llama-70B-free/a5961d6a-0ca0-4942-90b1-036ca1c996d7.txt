Okay, I'm trying to solve this equation sin(4x) + x = 54 using the Newton-Raphson method. Hmm, I remember that the Newton-Raphson method is an iterative way to find roots of a function. So first, I need to define the function and its derivative.

Let me set f(x) = sin(4x) + x - 54. I need to find the values of x where f(x) equals zero. The derivative f'(x) would be 4cos(4x) + 1, because the derivative of sin is cos, and chain rule gives the 4. Oh right, and the derivative of x is 1.

The Newton-Raphson formula is x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n). So I'll need an initial guess x0 to start with. But wait, since the problem is multiple choice, maybe I can find approximate solutions without doing all the iterations manually.

I should think about the behavior of the function. Sin(4x) oscillates between -1 and 1. So sin(4x) + x is x plus a small oscillation. So the function f(x) = sin(4x) + x - 54 will be zero when x is approximately 54, but adjusted a bit because of the sine term.

Wait, let me think about the possible number of roots. Since sin oscillates, each period could give a root. The period of sin(4x) is 2π/4 = π/2 ≈ 1.57. So between x=53 and x=55, there are a couple of periods, meaning maybe three roots? Because looking at the options, each has three roots in that region.

So possible roots are around 54, but where exactly? Let me try plugging in some numbers.

If x is 54, sin(4*54) = sin(216). Let me calculate 4*54 = 216 radians. Wait, 2π is about 6.28, so 216 radians is a lot. Let me find 216 mod 2π to find the equivalent angle. 216 / (2π) is roughly 216/(6.28) ≈ 34.4, so 34 full circles. The remainder is 0.4 * 2π ≈ 2.513 radians. So sin(216) = sin(2.513) ≈ 0.587. So f(54) = 54 + 0.587 -54 = 0.587. So f(54) is positive.

Wait wait, no. Wait, f(x)=sin(4x) +x -54. So at x=54, f(x)= sin(216)+54-54 = sin(216)= approx 0.587. So f(54)=0.587. So it's positive. So I'm looking for x where f(x)=0, so x needs to be a little less than 54 because at x=54, f is positive. Wait, but wait: the function x increases as x increases, but the sine term is oscillating. So maybe there's a point just below 54 where f(x)=0.

Wait, let me check x=53. Let's see f(53)= sin(4*53)+53-54 = sin(212) -1. 212 radians mod 2π: 212/(2π)= ~33.7, 0.7*2π≈4.398 radians. Sin(4.398) is sin(π + 1.257) since π≈3.14, so 4.398-3.14=1.258. Sin(π + theta) is -sin(theta). So sin(4.398)= -sin(1.258) ≈ -0.951. So f(53)= -0.951 -1= -1.951. That's negative. So f(53) is negative, and f(54) is positive. So by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root between 53 and 54.

Wait, wait, but the equation is f(x)=0. So between x=53 and 54, the function goes from negative to positive, so there's a root there. But wait, the options suggest that the roots are around 54, but each option has three roots, all near 54. So maybe I need to look for multiple roots around that area.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the function's behavior. The function x + sin(4x) is increasing because its derivative is 4cos(4x) +1. The cosine term oscillates between -1 and 1, so 4cos(4x) ranges from -4 to 4. So the derivative is between -4 +1 = -3 and 4+1=5. Oh wait, so the function f(x) is not always increasing. It can have regions where it decreases, which means it can have multiple roots.

But wait, let me think again. The function f(x) = sin(4x) + x -54. The derivative is f’(x) = 4 cos(4x) +1. So when 4cos(4x) +1 >0, the function is increasing. When it's negative, decreasing.

So cos(4x) can be negative enough to make the derivative negative. For example, if cos(4x) = -0.75, then 4*(-0.75) +1 = -3 +1 = -2. So yes, derivative can be negative.

That suggests that the function f(x) can have multiple turning points, leading to multiple roots. So perhaps in the vicinity of x=54, there are several roots.

But how to approximate them without doing the full Newton-Raphson? Maybe look for points where f(x) crosses zero.

Wait, perhaps I should compute f(54.25), f(54.76), etc., but without exact values, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can estimate the roots by considering where the function could cross zero.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Newton-Raphson method requires initial guesses. Let's say I pick x0=54, as an initial guess. Then compute f(x0)=0.587. f'(x0)=4cos(4*54)+1. 4*54=216 radians, which mod 2π is 216 - 34*2π. 34*2π≈213.628. 216-213.628≈2.372 radians. Cos(2.372)= approx cos(π - (2.372 - π)). π is about 3.14, so 2.372 is less than π. So cos(2.372)= -cos(2.372 - π/2?) Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute cos(2.372). 2.372 radians is about 135 degrees (since π is 3.14, so 2 radians is about 114 degrees). Wait, 2.372 is approximately 136 degrees. Cos(136 degrees) is negative. Let me compute cos(2.372) ≈ cos(136 degrees) ≈ -0.6947. So f'(54)=4*(-0.6947)+1 ≈ -2.7788 +1 = -1.7788.

So Newton-Raphson update x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 54 - (0.587)/(-1.7788) ≈ 54 + 0.330 ≈54.33.

So the first iteration brings x from 54 to 54.33. Compute f(54.33)= sin(4*54.33) +54.33 -54. Let me calculate 4*54.33≈217.32 radians. 217.32 mod 2π: 217.32/(2π)≈34.6. 34*2π≈213.628. 217.32-213.628≈3.692 radians. Sin(3.692)= sin(π + 0.552)≈ -sin(0.552)≈-0.525. So f(54.33)= -0.525 + 0.33 ≈-0.195. So f(x1)=~ -0.195.

f'(x1)=4cos(4*54.33)+1=4cos(217.32)+1. 217.32 mod 2π is 3.692 radians. Cos(3.692)=cos(π + 0.552)= -cos(0.552)≈-0.852. So f'(x1)=4*(-0.852)+1≈-3.408 +1= -2.408.

So x2 = x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1) =54.33 - (-0.195)/(-2.408) ≈54.33 - 0.081≈54.25.

Now, f(54.25)=sin(4*54.25)+54.25-54. 4*54.25=217 radians. 217 mod 2π is 217-34*2π=217-213.628≈3.372 radians. Sin(3.372)=sin(π + 0.232)= -sin(0.232)≈-0.230. So f= -0.230 +0.25= 0.02. So f(x2)=0.02.

f'(x2)=4cos(217)+1. 217 mod 2π=3.372. Cos(3.372)=cos(π+0.232)= -cos(0.232)=approx -0.973. So f'=4*(-0.973)+1≈-3.892+1= -2.892.

x3 =54.25 - (0.02)/(-2.892)=54.25 + 0.0069≈54.257.

f(54.257)=sin(4*54.257)=sin(217.028). 217.028 mod 2π=3.372 + something. Let me compute 217.028-213.628=3.4 radians. Sin(3.4)= sin(π + 0.26)= -sin(0.26)≈-0.258. So f= -0.258 +54.257 -54= -0.258 +0.257= -0.001.

Hmm, so f(x3)= -0.001. Then f'(x3)=4cos(4x3)+1. 4x3=217.028. Mod 2π is 3.4, as before. Cos(3.4)= ~-0.966. So f'=4*(-0.966)+1= -3.864 +1= -2.864.

x4 =54.257 - (-0.001)/(-2.864)=54.257 - 0.0003≈54.257. So it's converging to around 54.257.

So one root is approximately 54.26. Looking at the options, I see option B has 54.60, option C has 54.10, option D has 54.25. So perhaps one of the roots is near 54.25.

Wait, but the equation could have multiple roots, so perhaps I should look for other roots as well. Let's think about another initial guess.

Let me try x=55. Let's compute f(55)=sin(4*55)+55-54= sin(220)+1. 220 radians mod 2π: 220/(2π)= ~34.99, so 34*2π=213.628. 220-213.628=6.372 radians. 6.372 mod 2π is 6.372-2π*1=6.372-6.28=0.092 radians. Sin(0.092)=approx 0.0917. So f(55)=0.0917 +1=1.0917. So f(55)=1.0917, which is positive.

Wait, but I thought earlier that f(54) is positive and f(53) negative, so there's a root around 54. But with f(55)=positive, perhaps there's another root beyond 54. Wait, but wait: at x=55, f(x)=1.09. So if the function goes from positive at 54, then positive at 55, perhaps there's a maximum in between, so maybe another root beyond 55? Or perhaps another root between 54 and 55 if the function dips below zero.

Wait, perhaps I should check around x=54.5. Let me compute f(54.5)=sin(4*54.5)+54.5-54= sin(218)+0.5. 218 radians mod 2π: 218-34*2π=218-213.628=4.372 radians. 4.372 - π=4.372-3.14=1.232. So sin(4.372)=sin(π +1.232)= -sin(1.232)= approx -0.942. So f(54.5)= -0.942 +0.5= -0.442. So f(54.5)= -0.442. So between 54.5 and 55, f goes from -0.442 to +1.09, so there's a root there.

Wait, wait, but earlier at x=54.33, f was about -0.195, and at x=54.25, f was 0.02. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, when x=54.25:4x=217 radians. 217 mod 2π=217-34*2π=217-213.628=3.372 radians. Sin(3.372)=sin(π + (3.372-3.14))=sin(π+0.232)=-sin(0.232)=approx -0.230. So f(54.25)=sin(217)+54.25-54= -0.23 +0.25=0.02. So that's correct.

Then at x=54.33, f(x)=sin(217.32) +54.33 -54. 217.32 mod 2π=3.692 radians. Sin(3.692)=sin(π + 0.552)= -sin(0.552)=~ -0.525. So f= -0.525 +0.33= -0.195.

Wait, so the function at x=54.25 is 0.02, at x=54.33 is -0.195. So the function is decreasing there, indicating a root near 54.25 to 54.33. But when I did the Newton-Raphson, I converged to 54.257. So that's one root.

But when I check x=54.5, f is -0.442, and at x=55, f=1.0917. So the function goes from negative at 54.5 to positive at 55, so another root between 54.5 and 55.

So that's two roots so far. But the options have three roots. So perhaps there's another root beyond 55?

Wait, let's check x=55.5. f(55.5)=sin(4*55.5) +55.5 -54= sin(222)+1.5. 222 mod 2π=222-35*2π=222-219.91=2.09 radians. Sin(2.09)= approx 0.808. So f=0.808 +1.5=2.308, which is positive.

What about x=56? f(56)=sin(224) +56-54= sin(224) +2. 224 mod 2π=224-35*2π=224-219.91=4.09 radians. Sin(4.09)=sin(π +0.95)= -sin(0.95)=approx -0.813. So f= -0.813 +2=1.187, still positive.

Hmm, so f(x) increases beyond x=55, so no root beyond 55. But wait, perhaps another root between 53 and 54?

Wait, earlier I saw that f(53)= -1.951, which is negative, and f(54)=0.587, positive. So a root between 53 and 54. Let me try x=53.5.

f(53.5)=sin(4*53.5)+53.5-54= sin(214) -0.5. 214 mod 2π=214-34*2π=214-213.628=0.372 radians. Sin(0.372)=approx 0.365. So f=0.365 -0.5= -0.135. So f(53.5)= -0.135.

So between x=53.5 and x=54, f goes from -0.135 to +0.587, so a root there.

So possible roots are approximately:

- Between 53.5 and 54: say around 53.7.

- Between 54.25 and 54.33: around 54.26.

- Between 54.5 and 55: around 54.8.

Wait, but when I checked x=54.5, f was -0.442, and at x=55, 1.0917. So the root is around 54.8 perhaps.

So the three roots might be around 53.7, 54.26, and 54.8. Let's look at the options.

Option A: [53.52, 54.25, 54.76] → looks close.

Option B: [53.10,54.60,55.20] → 53.1 seems too low.

Option C: [54.10,54.85,55.60] → higher than our estimates.

Option D: [54.25,55.32,56.78] → way higher.

Option E: [52.45,53.76,54.90] → 52 is too low.

Option F: [52.34,53.45,54.56] → too low.

Option G: [51.25,53.00,54.75] → too low.

Option H: [52.50,53.75,55.00] → nope.

Option I: [52.80,53.90,54.95] → no.

Option J: [53.30,54.70,55.10] → 53.3, 54.7,55.1 → our estimate was 53.7, 54.26, 54.8, so this doesn't match exactly.

Wait, but perhaps my estimates are a bit off. Let me think again.

Wait, the first root
