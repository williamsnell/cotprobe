Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about information criteria, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question lists four statements (i to iv) and asks which are true. The options are combinations of these statements. I need to evaluate each one.

Starting with statement (i): "Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion." Hmm, I remember that R-squared measures the goodness of fit, and the adjusted R-squared is a modified version that penalizes for adding more variables. But is it considered an information criterion? I think information criteria like AIC and BIC are different from adjusted R-squared. They are more about model selection based on likelihood. So I'm leaning towards (i) being false.

Statement (ii): "If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall." Let me think. When you add a term, RSS (residual sum of squares) decreases. But information criteria (like AIC) have a penalty term for adding parameters. So while the RSS goes down, the penalty might make the overall AIC go up or down. Wait, but if the model is getting better by adding a term, maybe the AIC would decrease. Because AIC is something like -2 log L + 2k. So if adding a term makes the log likelihood increase enough to offset the 2k penalty, then AIC would decrease. But if you add a term that doesn't improve the model much, AIC would increase. So statement (ii) says the IC will fall when RSS falls. But adding a term always causes the RSS to fall, but the IC might rise or fall. So (ii) might be false because it's not guaranteed. Or wait, maybe it depends on which IC. For example, AIC and BIC have different penalties. So if the RSS falls, but the model's improvement isn't enough, the IC could go up. So statement (ii) is not necessarily true. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think again: when you add a term, the RSS decreases, which would generally make the model better. But the information criterion includes a penalty. So if adding the term improves the fit enough, the IC would decrease. If not, it would increase. So statement (ii) is saying that if RSS falls, IC will fall. But that's not necessarily true because it depends on the trade-off. So statement (ii) is false.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The residual sum of squares is part of the likelihood function. For a model with normal errors, the likelihood is related to the RSS. So when you add a term, the RSS decreases, which increases the likelihood. But the information criterion adds a penalty term. So whether the IC increases or decreases depends on whether the increase in likelihood (due to lower RSS) outweighs the penalty. So if you add a term that improves the model, the IC could go down. But sometimes it might go up if the improvement isn't enough. So statement (ii) says the IC will fall when RSS falls. But that's not always true. So statement (ii) is false.

Now statement (iii): "Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion." I recall that AIC tends to choose more complex models than BIC (Schwarz's). Because AIC has a smaller penalty for additional parameters than BIC. So if both are used, AIC might pick a model with more terms than BIC. So statement (iii) is true.

Statement (iv): "Akaike's information criterion is consistent." Consistent in the sense that as sample size increases, it will select the true model. I think AIC is not consistent. It's known that AIC can overfit and doesn't necessarily converge to the true model as n grows. On the other hand, BIC is consistent. So statement (iv) is false because AIC isn't consistent.

So now, evaluating each statement:

(i) False
(ii) False
(iii) True
(iv) False

Now, looking at the options, which statements are correct? Only (iii) is true among the four. Wait, but looking back, let me double-check.

Wait, the options are combinations of the statements. Let me see the options again.

The statements that are true are (iii) only. None of the options have only (iii). Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: (ii) and (iv) only → Both false, so A is wrong.

B: (ii) and (iii) only → (ii) is false, so B wrong.

C: All four → No, because we have (iii) true, others false.

D: (i) and (iv) → Both false.

E: (i) and (iii) → (i) is false, (iii) true → So E has one true and one false, so E is wrong.

F: (i), (iii), (iv) → All except (ii). But (i) and (iv) are false, so F is wrong.

G: (i) and (ii) → Both false, so G wrong.

H: (ii), (iii), (iv) → (ii) and (iv) are false, so H wrong.

I: (iii) and (iv) → (iv) is false, so I wrong.

J: (i), (ii), (iii) → (i) and (ii) are false, so J wrong.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in evaluating the statements?

Because according to my evaluation, only statement (iii) is correct. But none of the options have only (iii). So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another statement.

Wait, let me reevaluate.

Statement (i): Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion. Hmm, I thought it's not, because information criteria like AIC, BIC, etc., are separate. But maybe adjusted R-squared is considered an information criterion? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps adjusted R-squared is not an information criterion, so (i) is false.

Statement (ii): If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall. I thought this is false because the IC could go up or down. But perhaps I'm wrong. Let's think: when you add a term, the RSS decreases, which would make the model better. So for AIC, the formula is AIC = 2 log RSS/n + ... (Wait, the exact formula might vary, but for linear models, AIC is based on the RSS. So when RSS goes down, the AIC would go down if the penalty isn't too much. But the penalty is per additional parameter. So, if I add a term, the RSS decreases, but the penalty term increases. So the overall effect on AIC depends on whether the decrease in RSS outweighs the penalty.

But the statement says "the value of the information criterion will fall." So it's not necessarily always true. For example, adding a term that doesn't improve the model much would cause the IC to increase. So statement (ii) is false.

Statement (iii): AIC leads to model orders at least as large as SIC (Schwarz). Because AIC has a smaller penalty, so yes, AIC tends to choose more complex models. So (iii) is true.

Statement (iv): AIC is consistent. I think AIC is not consistent; it can have a tendency to overfit, meaning it doesn't necessarily select the true model even as n increases. So (iv) is false.

So among the four statements, only (iii) is true. But looking at the options, none of them have only (iii). So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the other statements.

Wait, looking again at statement (ii): If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall.

Wait, no, the residual sum of squares falls, which is a good thing, but the information criterion could go up or down. So the statement is not necessarily true. So (ii) is false.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding statement (ii). Maybe it's referring to the fact that adding a term that improves the model (as indicated by lower RSS) would cause the IC to decrease. But that's not necessarily always the case because the penalty could offset it.

So, perhaps (ii) is false.

Hmm, but the options don't have any option that selects only (iii). So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with statement (i). Is Adjusted R-squared considered an information criterion? My notes say that information criteria include AIC, BIC, etc. Adjusted R-squared is a different measure for model selection but isn't classified as an information criterion. So (i) is false.

So, given that, the correct statements are only (iii). But looking at the options, none of the options have only (iii). So perhaps the question is designed in a way that I made a mistake in evaluating another statement.

Wait, perhaps statement (ii) is actually true. Because when you add a term, the residual sum of squares (RSS) decreases, which would lower the AIC or other IC value if the model is better. But the IC also includes a penalty term. So the IC value is a function that combines both the RSS and the number of parameters. So adding a term that reduces RSS but increases the penalty. So the IC could go up or down. So statement (ii) is not necessarily true, because it's possible for IC to increase when adding a term if the RSS improvement isn't enough. So statement (ii) is false.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula. For AIC, the formula is:

AIC = n log(RSS/n) + n + 2k

Wait, not exactly, but for a regression model, it's often written as AIC = n ln(RSS/n) + n + 2k, where k is the number of parameters.

So when you add a term (k increases by 1), RSS decreases, so the first term (n ln(RSS/n)) becomes smaller (because RSS is smaller, ln(RSS/n) is more negative, multiplied by n it's a larger negative number, but added to n, which is positive). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how adding a term affects AIC.

If the term improves the model, the decrease in RSS would lead to a decrease in the first part, but the penalty term increases by 2. So overall, whether AIC increases or decreases depends on whether the improvement in RSS outweighs the penalty.

So statement (ii) says that when RSS falls, IC will fall. But that's not necessarily the case; it depends on the magnitude. So statement (ii) is false.

Thus, only statement (iii) is correct. But since none of the options select only (iii), perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option I: (iii) and (iv) only.

But (iv) is false, so I can't choose that.

Option B: (ii) and (iii) → (ii) is false.

Option J: (i), (ii), (iii) → (i) and (ii) false.

So, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating statement (iv): "Akaike's information criterion is consistent." Wait, consistency means that as n approaches infinity, the procedure selects the true model with probability approaching 1. I remember that AIC is not consistent. BIC is consistent. So (iv) is false.

So, with that, the only correct statement is (iii). But the options don't have an option with only (iii). So perhaps the correct answer is option I, but (iii) and (iv) are not both true. Wait, no, because (iv) is false.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating statement (i). Let me think again. Is adjusted R-squared considered an information criterion? I'm pretty sure it's not. Information criteria are based on the likelihood function and include penalties for model complexity, like AIC, BIC, etc. Adjusted R-squared is a different approach to avoid overfitting by penalizing additional terms, but it's not an information criterion. So (i) is false.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps statement (ii) is true in the sense that adding a term that reduces RSS will always cause the IC to decrease, but that's not correct because the penalty could cause it to increase. So (ii) is false.

So, only (iii) is correct, but since no option selects only (iii), perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A: (ii) and (iv) only → both false.

B: (ii) and (iii) → (ii) false, (iii) true → so only one correct, so B is wrong.

C: All four → No.

D: (i) and (iv) → Both false.

E: (i) and (iii) → (i) false, (iii) true → Only one correct, so E is wrong.

F: (i), (iii), (iv) → (i) and (iv) false, only (iii) correct → So F is wrong.

G: (i) and (ii) → Both false.

H: (ii), (iii), (iv) → (ii) and (iv) false, so H is wrong.

I: (iii) and (iv) → (iv) false, so I is wrong.

J: (i), (ii), (iii) → (i) and (ii) false → J wrong.

Wait a minute, this is confusing. So, according to my analysis, none of the options are correct, but that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in evaluating the statements.

Wait, perhaps statement (ii) is true. Let me think again: when you add a term, RSS falls. The information criterion is based on RSS and the number of parameters. If adding a term lowers RSS enough, the IC will fall. So in the case where adding the term actually improves the model, the IC would decrease. So perhaps statement (ii) is conditionally true, but the statement doesn't specify that the term is significant. So statement (ii) is too absolute. For example, adding a term that doesn't improve the model much would cause the IC to increase. So the statement is not always true, making (ii) false.

I'm stuck. According to my analysis, only statement (iii) is correct, but none of the options reflect that. Maybe I'm missing another true statement.

Wait, reviewing statement (iv) again: "Akaike's information criterion is consistent." No, as I thought, AIC isn't consistent. So (iv) is false.

So perhaps the correct answer is option I, but it includes (iii) and (iv), which is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question allows for multiple correct answers, and I'm missing another true statement.

Wait, let's think about statement (i) again. I've read that adjusted R-squared is sometimes referred to as an information criterion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's not. So (i) is false.

Alternatively, perhaps statement (i) is true. Let me think. Adjusted R-squared is a type of information criterion? I'm not too sure. I know that there are various information criteria, but the most common are AIC and BIC. Adjusted R-squared is more of a variant of R-squared. So I think (i) is false.

So, if only (iii) is correct, but none of the options have only (iii), perhaps the correct answer is option I, but that would require (iii) and (iv) to be correct, which they are not.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake regarding statement (ii). Let me think differently. The information criterion (like AIC) is calculated using the residual sum of squares and the number of parameters. If the RSS decreases when adding a term, the first part of the AIC (related to RSS) would decrease, but the penalty term increases. So the overall effect depends on which change is bigger. So statement (ii) is not necessarily true, because the IC could go up or down. So (ii) is false.

Thus, I'm back to square one. It seems that only (iii) is correct. But since none of the options have only (iii), perhaps I've overlooked something.

Wait, perhaps I should check the definitions again. Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion (SIC or BIC) has a stronger penalty for additional parameters than AIC. So AIC tends to choose more complex models than BIC. So statement (iii) is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option I: (iii) and (iv). But (iv) is false, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding statement (iv). Let me check what "consistent" means in this context. A consistent model selection procedure will select the true model as sample size grows. AIC is not consistent because it may not converge to the true model; it can overfit. BIC is consistent. So statement (iv) is false.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in some contexts, AIC is considered consistent for certain estimations, but I don't think so. I think AIC is not consistent for model selection.

So, I'm back to only (iii) being correct, but no option matches. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option I: (iii) and (iv), but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating statement (i).

Alternatively, perhaps statement (i) is correct, and I was wrong earlier. Let me think: adjusted R-squared is an information criterion. I thought information criteria are AIC, BIC, etc., but maybe adjusted R-squared is considered a type of information criterion. I'm not sure. Some sources might group them together as model selection criteria, but technically, they are different approaches. So (i) is false.

At this point, I think the correct answer must be option I, but it's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that would require (ii) and (iii) to be correct, which isn't the case. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've confused Schwarz's criterion with another. Wait, Schwarz's is BIC, which has a higher penalty than AIC. So AIC will often choose a more complex model, making (iii) correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I: (iii) and (iv). No, because (iv) is false.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: (ii) and (iii). But (ii) is false.

I'm stuck. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but again, I'm not sure.
