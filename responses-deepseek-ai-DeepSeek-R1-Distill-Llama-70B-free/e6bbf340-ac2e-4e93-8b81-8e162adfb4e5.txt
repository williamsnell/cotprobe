Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Black-Scholes problem. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the time-0 price of a contingent claim that pays S(1)^α at time 1. 

Alright, let's break down the given information. 

First, S(0) is 0.5. The stock price follows the process dS(t)/S(t) = 0.05 dt + 0.2 dZ(t). So the drift is 5% and the volatility is 20%. The risk-free rate is 3%, so that's important for discounting.

The contingent claim pays S(1)^α at time 1. So we need to find the expected value of S(1)^α, but wait, in the risk-neutral measure, right? Because in the Black-Scholes framework, we price options by calculating the expected payoff under the risk-neutral probability, then discount it at the risk-free rate.

Wait, but the problem gives us E[S(1)^α] = 1.4. Oh, but wait, is that the real-world expectation or the risk-neutral expectation? Hmm, I think in the Black-Scholes framework, when we calculate the price of a contingent claim, we use the risk-neutral measure. So the expectation given here might be under the physical measure, since it's just labeled as E without any notation. So I need to be careful here.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says E[S(1)^α] = 1.4, and α is a negative constant. So since α is negative, S(1)^α is like putting a negative exponent, which would make it similar to a bond or something—maybe a liability that depends inversely on S(1). But I'm not sure if that's relevant right now.

In the Black-Scholes model, the price of a contingent claim is the discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure. So I think the given expectation is under the physical measure, not the risk-neutral one. Because in the risk-neutral case, the drift would be the risk-free rate, not the 5% given here.

Wait, let me think again. The process is given as dS/S = 0.05 dt + 0.2 dZ. So 0.05 is the drift in the real world. Under the risk-neutral measure, the drift would be the risk-free rate, which is 3% here. So to compute the expectation under risk-neutral, I need to adjust the drift.

So the standard approach is to compute the risk-neutral expectation of S(1)^α, then discount it at r (which is 3%) to get the time-0 price.

But wait, the problem gives me E[S(1)^α] = 1.4, but is that under the real-world measure or the risk-neutral? Because if it's under the real-world, then I can't directly use it for pricing. I would need to adjust it using Girsanov's theorem or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the given expectation is under the risk-neutral measure. Let me check the problem statement again. It says E[S(1)^α] = 1.4, where α is negative. Hmm, maybe it's under the risk-neutral measure. Because if I compute the expectation under risk-neutral, then discount it, that gives the price. But in this case, the problem says E[S(1)^α] is 1.4. So perhaps that's the risk-neutral expectation, which would mean the price is 1.4 * e^{-r*T}.

Wait, but the time-0 price is e^{-rT} multiplied by the risk-neutral expectation of the payoff. So if E_r[S(1)^α] is 1.4, then the price would be 1.4 * e^{-0.03 *1} = 1.4 * e^{-0.03} ≈ 1.4 * 0.97045 ≈ 1.3586. Looking at the options, that's close to option E:1.360 or maybe F:1.390.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another approach: Maybe I need to compute E[S(1)^α] under the risk-neutral measure myself, and then discount it.

So under the risk-neutral measure, the drift is r=3%, so the process becomes dS/S = r dt + σ dZ^Q, where Q is the risk-neutral measure. So the drift is 0.03 instead of 0.05. So the process is:

dS/S = 0.03 dt + 0.2 dZ^Q.

So S(t) in risk-neutral measure is a geometric Brownian motion with drift 0.03 and volatility 0.2.

The formula for S(1) is S(0) * exp( (r - σ²/2) * T + σ * sqrt(T) * Z^Q ), where Z^Q is a standard normal variable.

So S(1) = 0.5 * exp( (0.03 - (0.2)^2/2) *1 + 0.2 * sqrt(1) * Z^Q )

Let me compute the exponent: (0.03 - 0.02) = 0.01. So S(1) = 0.5 * e^{0.01 + 0.2 Z^Q}.

So S(1)^α = (0.5)^α * e^{0.01 α + 0.2 α Z^Q}.

The expectation E^Q[S(1)^α] is then (0.5)^α * e^{0.01 α} * E^Q[ e^{0.2 α Z^Q} ].

Now, E[e^{k Z}] where Z is standard normal is e^{k²/2}. So here, k = 0.2 α.

So E^Q[ e^{0.2 α Z^Q} } = e^{ (0.2 α)^2 / 2 }.

Putting it all together:

E^Q[S(1)^α] = (0.5)^α * e^{0.01 α} * e^{ (0.2 α)^2 / 2 }.

Simplify the exponents:

0.01 α + (0.04 α²)/2 = 0.01 α + 0.02 α².

So the expectation is (0.5)^α * e^{ 0.01 α + 0.02 α² }.

But wait, the problem says that in the real-world expectation, E[S(1)^α] is 1.4. So under the real-world measure, the drift is 0.05. So let me compute that.

Under real-world, S(1) = 0.5 * exp( (0.05 - 0.02) + 0.2 Z ), because (σ²/2)=0.02.

So S(1) = 0.5 * e^{0.03 + 0.2 Z}.

So S(1)^α = (0.5)^α e^{0.03 α + 0.2 α Z}.

The expectation E[S(1)^α] under real-world is (0.5)^α e^{0.03 α} E[e^{0.2 α Z} ].

Again, E[e^{k Z}] is e^{k²/2}, so k=0.2 α.

Thus, E[S(1)^α] = (0.5)^α e^{0.03 α + (0.2 α)^2 / 2 }.

And this is given as 1.4.

So we have the equation:

(0.5)^α e^{0.03 α + 0.02 α²} = 1.4.

We need to solve for α. Let's take natural logs on both sides:

ln(0.5^α) + 0.03 α + 0.02 α² = ln(1.4).

ln(0.5^α) is α ln(0.5) which is α (-0.6931).

So:

-0.6931 α + 0.03 α + 0.02 α² = ln(1.4).

Compute ln(1.4): approximately 0.3365.

So:

0.02 α² + (0.03 - 0.6931) α - 0.3365 = 0.

0.02 α² - 0.6631 α - 0.3365 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in α. Let's write it as:

0.02 α² - 0.6631 α - 0.3365 = 0.

Multiply all terms by 100 to eliminate decimals:

2 α² - 66.31 α - 33.65 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: α = [66.31 ± sqrt( (66.31)^2 + 4*2*33.65 )]/(2*2).

Compute discriminant D: (66.31)^2 + 4*2*33.65.

66.31^2: approx 66^2=4356, 0.31^2≈0.0961, and cross term 2*66*0.31≈40.92. So 66.31^2≈(66 +0.31)^2=66² + 2*66*0.31 +0.31²= 4356 +40.92 +0.0961≈4396.0161.

Then 4*2*33.65= 8*33.65=269.2.

So D=4396.0161 +269.2≈4665.2161.

sqrt(D): sqrt(4665.2161) is approx 68.3, since 68^2=4624, 69^2=4761. So 68.3^2= approx 4665.

So sqrt(D)≈68.3.

Now, α = [66.31 ±68.3]/(4).

We have two solutions:

(66.31 +68.3)/4 ≈ (134.61)/4≈33.65.

(66.31 -68.3)/4≈ (-1.99)/4≈-0.4975.

But α is given as a negative constant, so α≈-0.4975. Let's say approximately -0.5.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using calculator steps:

Compute 66.31^2: 66 *66=4356, 66*0.31*2=40.92, 0.31^2=0.0961. So 4356 +40.92=4396.92 +0.0961=4396.0161?

Wait, no—no, wait, 66.31^2 is (66 +0.31)^2=66^2 + 2*66*0.31 +0.31^2=4356 +40.92 +0.0961=4396.0161.

Then 4*2*33.65=8*33.65= 8*(30 +3.65)=240 +29.2=269.2.

So D=4396.0161 +269.2=4665.2161.

sqrt(4665.2161)= let's see, 68^2=4624, 68.3^2= (68 +0.3)^2=68^2 +2*68*0.3 +0.3^2=4624 +40.8 +0.09=4664.89, which is just about our D of 4665.2161. So sqrt(D)=approx 68.3 + (4665.2161 -4664.89)/(2*68.3). The difference is 0.3261. So 0.3261/(136.6)= approx 0.002386. So sqrt(D)=68.3 +0.002386≈68.3024.

So back to α calculation. We have [66.31 ±68.3024]/4.

First solution: (66.31 +68.3024)=134.6124/4=33.6531.

Second solution: (66.31 -68.3024)= -1.9924/4≈-0.4981.

But α is negative, so α≈-0.4981.

Let me check if this is correct.

Wait, but let me plug α=-0.5 into the expectation expression to see if it approximates to 1.4.

Compute (0.5)^-0.5 = 1/sqrt(0.5)≈1.4142.

Then e^{0.03*(-0.5) + 0.02*(-0.5)^2 }= e^{-0.015 + 0.02*0.25} = e^{-0.015 +0.005}= e^{-0.01}≈0.99005.

So (0.5)^-0.5 * e^{-0.01}≈1.4142 *0.99005≈1.400. Which is 1.4 as given. So yes, α=-0.5.

So α is -0.5.

Now, going back to the risk-neutral expectation.

We had E^Q[S(1)^α] = (0.5)^α * e^{0.01 α + 0.02 α²}.

Plugging α=-0.5:

(0.5)^(-0.5) = 1/sqrt(0.5)≈1.4142.

Exponent: 0.01*(-0.5) + 0.02*( (-0.5)^2 ) = -0.005 + 0.02*(0.25) = -0.005 +0.005=0.

So E^Q[S(1)^α] =1.4142 * e^0=1.4142.

Then, the time-0 price is e^{-rT} * E^Q[ payoff ]=e^{-0.03*1} *1.4142≈0.97045 *1.4142≈1.372.

Looking at the options, J is 1.372. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check my numbers.

Wait, when I computed E^Q[S(1)^α], with α=-0.5, I got 1.4142, because the exponent was zero. Then discounting by e^{-0.03} gives 1.4142 * 0.97045≈1.372.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is J:1.372.

To determine the time-0 price of the contingent claim that pays \( S(1)^\alpha \) at time 1, we proceed as follows:

1. **Under the Risk-Neutral Measure**:  
   In the Black-Scholes framework, the price of a contingent claim is calculated as the discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure. The stock price process under the risk-neutral measure is:  
   \[
   \frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = r \, dt + \sigma \, dZ^Q
   \]  
   where \( r = 0.03 \) (the risk-free rate) and \( \sigma = 0.2 \).  

   The stock price at time 1 is given by:  
   \[
   S(1) = S(0) \exp\left( \left(r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)T + \sigma \sqrt{T} Z^Q \right)
   \]  
   Substituting \( S(0) = 0.5 \), \( r = 0.03 \), \( \sigma = 0.2 \), and \( T = 1 \):  
   \[
   S(1) = 0.5 \exp\left( 0.01 + 0.2 Z^Q \right)
   \]  

2. **Risk-Neutral Expectation of \( S(1)^\alpha \)**:  
   The contingent claim pays \( S(1)^\alpha \) at time 1, where \( \alpha \) is a negative constant. The expectation of \( S(1)^\alpha \) under the risk-neutral measure is:  
   \[
   E^Q\left[S(1)^\alpha\right] = (0.5)^\alpha \exp\left(0.01 \alpha + 0.02 \alpha^2\right)
   \]  
   Here, we used the fact that \( E^Q\left[e^{k Z^Q}\right] = e^{k^2 / 2} \) for standard normal \( Z^Q \), with \( k = 0.2 \alpha \).

3. **Given Real-World Expectation**:  
   The problem states that \( E[S(1)^\alpha] = 1.4 \) under the real-world measure. Using the real-world drift \( \mu = 0.05 \), the expectation is:  
   \[
   E\left[S(1)^\alpha\right] = (0.5)^\alpha \exp\left(0.03 \alpha + 0.02 \alpha^2\right)
   \]  
   Setting this equal to 1.4 and solving for \( \alpha \), we find \( \alpha \approx -0.5 \).

4. **Calculate the Time-0 Price**:  
   Substituting \( \alpha = -0.5 \) into the risk-neutral expectation formula:  
   \[
   E^Q\left[S(1)^\alpha\right] = (0.5)^{-0.5} \exp\left(0.01(-0.5) + 0.02(-0.5)^2\right)
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   (0.5)^{-0.5} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.5}} \approx 1.4142, \quad \text{and} \quad 0.01(-0.5) + 0.02(-0.5)^2 = -0.005 + 0.005 = 0
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   E^Q\left[S(1)^\alpha\right] = 1.4142 \cdot e^0 = 1.4142
   \]  

   The time-0 price is obtained by discounting this expectation at the risk-free rate:  
   \[
   \text{Price} = e^{-rT} \cdot E^Q\left[S(1)^\alpha\right] = e^{-0.03} \cdot 1.4142 \approx 0.97045 \cdot 1
