Alright, so I'm trying to answer this question about vaccines, specifically comparing killed and live vaccines. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus. The task is to determine why a killed vaccine would be the preferred choice over a live one. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should recall what I know about live versus killed (inactivated) vaccines. Live vaccines contain a weakened form of the virus, which can cause a mild or asymptomatic infection. This leads to a strong immune response, often providing long-term immunity, sometimes even lifelong. Examples include the MMR vaccine and chickenpox. On the other hand, killed vaccines use inactivated or killed pathogens. They can't cause the disease but might require booster shots because the immune response isn't as strong. Examples are the flu shot and polio (IPV) vaccine.

Now, the question is about a new severe respiratory virus. So, considering safety and potential risks is important, especially if the virus is severe. I remember that live vaccines have some drawbacks: they can be risky for immunocompromised individuals because the weakened virus might still cause disease in them. Also, there's a theoretical risk, though rare, that the weakened virus could revert to a virulent form, causing the disease it's meant to prevent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Is more likely to provide sterilizing immunity. Sterilizing immunity prevents the pathogen from establishing infection at all. Live vaccines are usually better at this because they mimic a real infection. So I think killed vaccines might not be better here; perhaps the opposite.

Option B: Can be administered in higher doses. I'm not sure about this. Killed vaccines might require more doses or higher amounts to be effective, but this doesn't directly relate to the rationale for choosing them for a new severe virus.

Option C: Develops more rapid protective immunity. I think live vaccines can sometimes provide immunity faster because they replicate, but I'm not certain. Killed vaccines might need more time or doses to build immunity.

Option D: Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity. Wait, no, I thought live vaccines often offer longer immunity with fewer boosters. Killed ones might need boosters more often, so this might not be correct.

Option E: Is less likely to cause an allergic reaction. I'm not sure about this. Both types can cause allergic reactions, but maybe killed vaccines have different components. I don't think this is the main rationale.

Option F: Is more effective for immunocompromised individuals. No, wait. Live vaccines are contraindicated in immunocompromised people because their weakened immune systems can't handle even a weakened virus. Killed vaccines are safer for them, so this could be a reason. But the question is about a new virus, so maybe the target population is the general public, not specifically immunocompromised.

Option G: Is most likely to generate mucosal immunity. Mucosal immunity is often better with live vaccines because they infect the body similarly to the wild virus, which might involve mucosal surfaces. Killed vaccines usually induce systemic immunity more than mucosal.

Option H: Is less likely to cause local adverse reactions at the site of injection. I think killed vaccines might have more local reactions because they can be more immunogenic in that area, but this isn't a strong point for choosing them for a new virus.

Option I: Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence. Ah, this rings a bell. Live vaccines carry a small risk that the attenuated virus could mutate back to a virulent form, especially in immunocompromised individuals. For a new virus, where the behavior isn't fully understood, using a killed vaccine would eliminate that risk entirely. This seems like a strong rationale.

Option J: Is less likely to be affected by preexisting antibodies. Preexisting antibodies (like from a previous infection or vaccination) can interfere with live vaccines because the antibodies might neutralize the weakened virus before it can cause an immune response. Killed vaccines might not be affected as much, but I'm not sure if this is the primary concern when choosing a vaccine type for a new virus.

Putting it all together: The main reason to choose a killed vaccine here is to avoid the possibility that the live virus could revert to a virulent form. This is especially important when dealing with a new virus, where the risks of the live vaccine might outweigh the benefits.

So the correct answer should be option I.

When deciding between a killed vaccine and a live vaccine for a new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus, it is important to consider the unique risks and benefits of each. Live vaccines, which contain a weakened form of the virus, can provide strong and long-lasting immunity. However, they carry risks such as causing disease in immunocompromised individuals and the theoretical possibility of reversion to virulence, where the weakened virus mutates back into a harmful form. 

Killed vaccines, on the other hand, use inactivated pathogens and are safer for immunocompromised individuals. They also eliminate the risk of reversion to virulence entirely, which is a critical consideration when dealing with a new virus whose behavior is not yet fully understood. This makes killed vaccines a more appropriate choice in this scenario, as they prioritize safety and avoid the potential dangers associated with live vaccines.

Among the options provided, the most relevant rationale for developing a killed vaccine is to avoid the concern for reversion to virulence.
