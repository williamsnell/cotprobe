Okay, so I have this question about China's military spending as a percentage of GDP in 2017. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on exact numbers, but I remember some general facts. Let me think.

I know that the United States spends a lot on its military, like around 3-4% of GDP. But China's spending is different. I've heard that China's military budget is lower as a percentage of GDP compared to the US, but it's been increasing over the years.

Wait, I think China's military spending is often cited as being around 2% of GDP. But wait, that might be a common figure, but is that accurate for 2017? I'm not sure. I remember that some sources say it's about 2%, but others suggest it might be a bit higher because of their rapid military modernization.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another country. Like, maybe Russia spends around 5% or so. No, that's probably not right. Let me try to recall specific data points.

I think in 2017, China's official defense budget was around 1.3 trillion yuan. To get the percentage of GDP, I'd need to know China's GDP that year. Let's see, China's GDP in 2017 was approximately $12.8 trillion. So converting yuan to dollars, 1.3 trillion yuan is about $190 billion. 

Wait, $190 billion divided by $12.8 trillion is roughly 1.48%. But that doesn't match any of the higher options. Hmm, that's strange. Or maybe my numbers are off. Perhaps the actual spending is higher than the official figures because some expenditures aren't included in the defense budget.

Oh right, some analysts believe that China's actual military spending could be higher than what's officially reported. They might include things like research and development, pensions, or other related costs that aren't part of the official defense budget. So maybe the percentage is higher.

If the actual spending is around 2% of GDP, then the correct answer would be B: 2%. But wait, I've also heard that China's spending is sometimes estimated to be around 1.9% or so. So 2% would be the closest option.

Looking at the options, option B is 2%. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard numbers closer to 1.5%, but maybe that's outdated. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the figures with India's military spending, which I think is around 2% as well.

Alternatively, let me think about other sources. I remember that the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reports on military expenditures. They might have data for 2017. From what I recall, SIPRI's estimates for China's military spending as a percentage of GDP have been around 2% or slightly higher.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is B: 2%.

As of 2017, China's military spending as a percentage of GDP is often reported to be around 2%. While the official defense budget was approximately 1.3 trillion yuan, which translates to roughly $190 billion, some analysts suggest that actual spending could be higher due to additional expenditures not included in the official figures. However, the commonly cited estimate aligns with 2% of GDP.

Answer: B
