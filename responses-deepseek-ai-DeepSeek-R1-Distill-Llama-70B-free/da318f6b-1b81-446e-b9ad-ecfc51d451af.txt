Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that 200 mL of oxygen is collected over water at 25°C and 750 torr. Then, when this oxygen is dried at the same temperature and pressure, what volume does it occupy? Also, what volume does the water vapor removed occupy under the same conditions?

Hmm. I remember that when gases are collected over water, the total pressure is the sum of the gas pressure and the water vapor pressure. So, first, I think I need to find out how much of the collected gas is actually oxygen and how much is water vapor.

The equilibrium vapor pressure of water at 25°C is given as 28.3 torr. So the total pressure is 750 torr. That means the pressure of just the oxygen gas would be the total pressure minus the vapor pressure. So, 750 minus 28.3 equals 721.7 torr. That's the partial pressure of oxygen in the mixture.

Wait, but when the oxygen is dried, the water vapor is removed, so the oxygen's pressure becomes the total pressure. So the initial volume is 200 mL, but that's under 721.7 torr of oxygen. When dried, the pressure becomes 750 torr. But wait, the temperature is the same, so I can use Boyle's Law here, right? Because temperature is constant, pressure and volume are inversely related.

Boyle's Law is P1V1 = P2V2. So P1 is 721.7 torr, V1 is 200 mL. P2 is 750 torr. I need to find V2. Plugging the numbers in:

721.7 * 200 = 750 * V2.

Let me calculate that. 721.7 * 200 is 144,340. So 144,340 = 750 V2. Divide both sides by 750: V2 = 144340 / 750 ≈ 192.453 mL. So about 192.45 mL. That's the first part.

Now, the second part: the volume of the water vapor removed. Since the vapor pressure is 28.3 torr, and the total pressure is 750 torr, the initial volume of the water vapor can be found using the same approach.

Wait, but initially, the total volume is 200 mL, which includes both oxygen and water vapor. So the vapor contributes a partial pressure of 28.3 torr. So the volume of vapor in the initial 200 mL can be found using the same method.

So, the initial pressure of vapor is 28.3 torr. When it's removed, it's maintained at 25°C and 750 torr. Hmm. Wait, when the vapor is removed, its pressure becomes the same as the surrounding, which is 750 torr, but the volume changes. Or wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, no. The water vapor that was in the oxygen is being removed and collected under the same conditions. Or maybe, the volume it would occupy when under 750 torr. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the volume is calculated using the ideal gas law. Since n is constant (the amount of water vapor), and temperature is constant, PV/T = nRT, so P1V1 = P2V2, same as before.

In the initial state, the vapor is at 28.3 torr, and the volume is the partial volume in the 200 mL. Wait, no, the initial total volume is 200 mL, which includes both the oxygen and the vapor. So the partial volume of the vapor would be (P_vapor / P_total) * total volume. So (28.3 / 750) * 200 mL.

Let me compute that: 28.3 * 200 = 5,660. Then, 5,660 / 750 ≈ 7.5467 mL. So approximately 7.55 mL.

Wait, but when you dry the oxygen, the vapor is removed, so that vapor's volume at the same conditions would be 7.55 mL. So the first part is about 192.45 mL, and the second is about 7.55 mL.

Looking at the options, F is 192.45 and 7.55, and J is 190 and 7.55. But wait, my calculation for the oxygen after drying is approximately 192.45 mL, which matches option F's first part. And the vapor is 7.55 mL, which is the second part. So option F would be the correct choice.

But wait, am I missing anything? Let me double-check. The initial volume is 200 mL, which includes both O2 and H2O vapor. The partial pressure of O2 is 750 - 28.3 = 721.7 torr. So using P1V1 = P2V2 for O2: 721.7 * 200 = 750 * V2. So V2 is 192.45 mL. Correct.

For the vapor, the initial pressure is 28.3 torr. When you collect the vapor at 750 torr, what's the volume? It's the same as the vapor's contribution in the original mixture. So the volume of vapor in the initial 200 mL is (28.3 /750) * 200 = 7.5467 mL. So when removed and kept at 750 torr, same T, that volume is correct.

So the two volumes are 192.45 mL and 7.55 mL, which is option F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using Boyle's Law and the ideal gas law principles. The total pressure is given as 750 torr, and the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at 25°C is 28.3 torr. This means the partial pressure of oxygen in the initial mixture is:

\[
P_{\text{O}_2} = 750 - 28.3 = 721.7 \, \text{torr}.
\]

### Step 1: Volume of dried oxygen
The oxygen is dried, meaning the water vapor is removed, and the oxygen now occupies the entire pressure of 750 torr at the same temperature. Using Boyle's Law:

\[
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2,
\]

where \(P_1 = 721.7 \, \text{torr}\), \(V_1 = 200 \, \text{mL}\), and \(P_2 = 750 \, \text{torr}\). Solving for \(V_2\):

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1}{P_2} = \frac{721.7 \times 200}{750} \approx 192.45 \, \text{mL}.
\]

### Step 2: Volume of water vapor removed
The water vapor initially contributes a partial pressure of 28.3 torr to the total pressure of 750 torr. The volume of water vapor in the initial 200 mL can be calculated as:

\[
V_{\text{vapor}} = \frac{P_{\text{vapor}}}{P_{\text{total}}} \times V_{\text{total}} = \frac{28.3}{750} \times 200 \approx 7.55 \, \text{mL}.
\]

When the water vapor is removed and maintained at 25°C and 750 torr, it occupies this calculated volume.

### Final Answer
The volume of the dried oxygen is approximately **192.45 mL**, and the volume of the water vapor removed is approximately **7.55 mL**. Comparing these values with the options, the correct choice is:

**F: 192.45 mL and 7.55 mL.**
