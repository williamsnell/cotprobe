Okay, so I have this accounting problem here about payment terms and due dates. Hmm, I need to figure out the answers to parts (a) and (b). Let's take it step by step.

Starting with part (a): The question is about when the payment is due. The invoice is dated June 10, and the terms are (n/30) ROG. ROG stands for "Remittance on Demand" or something like that? Wait, no, ROG is "Receipt of Goods." Oh right, the discount doesn't start until the buyer receives the goods.

So the machines were received on July 30. The payment terms are net 30 days, starting from when? From the date of receipt. So the due date would be 30 days after July 30.

Let me calculate that. July has 31 days, so July 30 plus 30 days... July 30 to August 30 is 31 days (July 30 to July 31 is 1 day, then 30 days in August). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is net 30 after receipt. So if the goods were received on July 30, then the due date is 30 days later. So July 30 plus 30 days would be August 29. Because July 30 to August 29 is exactly 30 days. Because July has 31 days, so from July 30 to July 31 is 1 day, then August has 28 days left (since 30-1=29?), no wait. Wait, 30 days from July 30:

July 30: day 1, July 31: day 2. Then August: 30 days total. So August 29 would be the 30th day. So the payment is due on August 29.

Looking at the options for part (a), option C is August 29, $987.70. But wait, part (a) is just about the due date, the amount isn't changing for part (a), since there's no discount mentioned in (a). So the payment due date is August 29. So for part (a), the answer would be August 29, which is option C. But wait, looking at the options, I need to look for the answer that matches (a) and (b) together. Wait, wait, no, the options are for each part. Wait, no, the options are each a possible answer for the entire question, which has two parts, (a) and (b). Hmm, no, no, the options are for the entire question, but each option gives a date and an amount. Wait, but the question is two separate parts, (a) and (b). So I think the first part is (a), and (b) is separate. So maybe I should focus on each part separately.

Wait, but the way the options are presented, each option includes both a date and an amount. So perhaps each option is a combined answer for both (a) and (b). But no, the question is in two parts, so I think each part is separate, but the options are giving possible answers for each part as a pair. Hmm, but looking back, the question says "Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J." So each option is a possible answer to the entire question, which includes both (a) and (b). But wait, the way it's worded, (a) and (b) are two separate questions. So perhaps each option corresponds to an answer for part (a) and part (b). But that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for each part, but the way it's presented, each option gives a date and an amount, which could relate to each part.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the options again. Looking at the options:

Option A: August 4, $967.95 → Maybe for part (b), because part (b) has a payment on August 4.

Option B: August 30, $987.70 → Part (a) due date, perhaps.

Option C: August 29, $987.70 → Part (a)'s due date.

Hmm, but part (a) doesn't involve any discount, so the amount is the full. So part (a) would have the amount as $987.70. So looking at the options, for part (a), the date is August 29, and the amount is $987.70, which is option C. But the question is a bit ambiguous because the options list both date and amount for each choice, and the question has two parts.

Wait, perhaps the options are for each part, but the way it's structured, each option is a possible answer to both (a) and (b). Or maybe each option is an answer for part (b), but that's unclear. Alternatively, the options might be the possible answers for each part.

Wait, but the question says: "selecting from the answer A through to J." So each option is a combined answer for both parts (a) and (b). But that doesn't make sense, because (a) is about due date, and (b) is about the amount paid. So perhaps each option gives a date for (a) and an amount for (b). So for example, option A: (a) date is August 4, which can't be right because (a) is about the due date when received on July 30. So option A's date is Aug 4, which would be too early.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on each part.

Part (a): Due date when machines are received July 30, terms n/30 ROG.

So ROG means the payment starts when the buyer receives the goods. So the 30-day period begins on July 30. So the due date is July 30 + 30 days.

July 30 is the start, so adding 30 days:

July has 31 days, so from July 30 to July 31 is 2 days (including both). Then August has 30 days, so 30-1 (since July 31 is day 2) → August 29 is day 30.

So due date is August 29. So for part (a), the answer is August 29.

Looking at the options, the dates in the options are:

A: Aug 4 → too early.

B: Aug 30 → that's 31 days from July 30.

C: Aug 29 → correct.

Part (b): Terms are (2/10), n/30. Invoice date is July 30, payment made on August 4.

Wait, so the terms are 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise net 30. So the invoice is dated July 30. So the last day for the discount is July 30 + 10 days = August 9. Because July 30 is day 1, July 31 is day 2, August 1 is day 3, ..., August 9 is day 10.

So payment made on August 4 is within the discount period. So the buyer can take the 2% discount.

The list price is $987.70. So the discount is 2% of 987.70.

Calculating 2% of 987.70:

987.70 * 0.02 = 19.754 → approximately $19.75 (since we usually round to the nearest cent).

So the amount paid is 987.70 - 19.75 = $967.95.

Looking at the options for part (b), the amount is $967.95, and the payment date is August 4. So the correct option would have August 4 as the date and $967.95 as the amount.

Looking at the options:

Option A: August 4, $967.95 → this matches part (b).

Option H: August 19, $967.95 → but payment is made on August 4.

So for part (b), the correct amount is $967.95, and the payment date is August 4.

Now, the question is about selecting an option that includes both parts. Wait, no, the question is two parts, (a) and (b), each with their own answer. But the options provided are each a single answer, which includes a date and an amount. So perhaps the question is asking for each part, but the options are presented as possible answers for each part. Alternatively, perhaps the options are each possible pairs of (a) and (b) answers.

Wait, but looking back, the question says: "Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J." So each option is a choice for the entire problem, which has two parts. So each option gives a date (probably for part a) and an amount (probably for part b).

So for part (a), the due date is August 29, and for part (b), the amount is $967.95.

Looking for an option that has August 29 and $967.95.

Looking at the options:

Option G: August 29, $967.95 → that's the combination.

Option C: August 29, $987.70 → that's part (a) correct, but part (b) wrong.

So the correct overall answer would be option G.

Wait, but let me double-check part (a). The invoice is dated June 10, but the ROG terms mean the due date starts when the goods are received, which is July 30. So due date is July 30 + 30 days = August 29. So part (a) is August 29. Part (b): payment made on August 4, which is within the 10-day discount period starting from July 30. So discount applies, amount is $967.95. So the correct option is G: August 29, $967.95.

Looking back, the options are:

G: August 29, $967.95.

So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to address both parts (a) and (b) separately and then match the results to the given options.

---

### Part (a): Determining the payment due date
- The invoice is dated June 10, but the terms are (n/30) ROG, meaning the payment period starts when the goods are received.
- The goods were received on July 30, so the 30-day payment period begins on this date.
- Adding 30 days to July 30:
  - July 30 to July 31: 1 day.
  - August 1 to August 29: 29 days.
  - Total: 30 days.
- Therefore, the payment is due on **August 29**.

---

### Part (b): Calculating the amount paid
- The terms are (2/10), (n/30), meaning a 2% discount is available if payment is made within 10 days of the invoice date (July 30).
- Payment was made on August 4, which is within the 10-day discount period (July 30 to August 9).
- The list price of the machines is $987.70.
- The discount is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Discount} = 987.70 \times 0.02 = 19.754 \approx 19.75
  \]
- The amount paid is the list price minus the discount:
  \[
  \text{Amount Paid} = 987.70 - 19.75 = 967.95
  \]

---

### Matching the Results to the Options
- For part (a), the payment due date is **August 29**.
- For part (b), the amount paid is **$967.95**.
- The correct option must include both **August 29** and **$967.95**.

From the given options:
- **Option G: August 29, $967.95** matches both parts.

**Final Answer: G**
