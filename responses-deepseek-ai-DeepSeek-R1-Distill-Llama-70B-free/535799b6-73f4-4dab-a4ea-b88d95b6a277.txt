Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about special relativity, specifically dealing with time intervals and reference frames. Hmm, I remember that in special relativity, time and space measurements can vary depending on the reference frame. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in a particular inertial reference frame S, two events occur a distance of 6e8 meters apart and are separated by a time interval of either 2 seconds or 1 second. The question is asking for the proper time interval between these two events.

Wait, wait. Proper time is the time interval measured in the reference frame where both events occur at the same location. So, the proper time (Δt') is the shortest possible time measurement for those events because in that frame, the events happen right next to each other, so no length contraction or anything. But wait, if the events are happening at different locations in frame S, then the proper time must be calculated using the spacetime interval, which is invariant.

Right, the spacetime interval squared is (c^2 Δt^2) - (Δx^2). Since this is invariant, it should be the same in all reference frames. So the proper time is when the spatial separation (Δx') is zero, right? So in that case, the spacetime interval squared equals (c^2 (Δt')^2) - 0. So (Δt')^2 = (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2. Wait, no, because Δx is in S, and in S, the events are separated by Δx and Δt. So the proper time is calculated using Δt' = sqrt(Δt^2 - (Δx/c)^2). But wait, this is only correct if the events are causally connected in such a way that they can be at the same place in another frame.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for proper time is when you have the events, so the proper time interval is the square root of (Δt^2 - (Δx/c)^2). But only if the events are timelike separated, which they would be if the time separation is larger than the spatial separation over c.

Wait, let me think about the units here. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 6e8 meters is 2 light-seconds. Because 3e8 m/s * 1 s = 3e8 m. So 6e8 m is 2 * (3e8) = 2 light-seconds.

So in case (a), the time interval is 2 seconds. So the spatial separation is 2 light-seconds, which makes the time separation equal to the spatial separation in light time. So the interval is (2 sec) and (2 light-sec). Hmm, so the spacetime interval squared is (c^2)(2)^2 - (6e8)^2. Let me compute this.

c is 3e8 m/s. So c^2 is 9e16 m²/s². So (c^2)(2^2) = 9e16 *4 = 3.6e17 m²/s².

The spatial part is (6e8)^2 = 36e16 m².

So 3.6e17 - 36e16 = (36e16 - 36e16) = 0. So the spacetime interval is zero. That implies that the events are light-like separated, meaning they lie on a null path. So the proper time would be zero. Wait, because if the spacetime interval is zero, then in any frame, the events are either simultaneous or the same event.

Wait, no. Wait, no. If the spacetime interval is zero, then the two events are connected by a light signal. So the proper time between them would be zero because there's no proper frame where both events happen at the same place except along the light path, but the proper time would be zero. So in that case, the proper time is zero.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have zero except option G, which says Δt' =0 and no reference frame S' can be found. Hmm. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, let's double-check. The formula for proper time is τ = sqrt(Δt² - (Δx/c)²). So in case (a), Δt is 2s, Δx is 6e8 m.

So Δx/c = (6e8 m) / (3e8 m/s) )= 2 seconds. So (Δx/c)^2 is (2)^2=4. Then τ² = (2)^2 -4 = 4-4=0. So τ=0. So the proper time is zero. So the only option that mentions zero is option G, but option G says Δt' =0 and no reference frame S' can be found. Wait, but if τ is zero, that would mean the two events are on the same light cone and there's no frame where they are at the same place with Δx' =0. Because to have Δx'=0, the events must occur at the same place in that frame. But if the spacetime interval is zero, then no such frame exists, so the proper time is zero. So option G says Δt' =0 and no frame S' exists. So that's correct.

But wait, the question is part (a) and part (b). Oh wait, the question is more about part (a) and (b) as two separate cases. Because the question is giving two possible time intervals: 2 sec and 1 sec. So let me think for each.

Wait, the question is as written: two events occur a distance 6e8 m apart and are separated by a time interval of (a) 2 sec, (b) 1 sec. So it's two separate scenarios. So the answer would be different for each.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "What is the proper time interval between these two events?" So perhaps the question includes both (a) and (b) as possible options. Wait, no. Looking back: the question says, "two events occur a distance 6 × 10^8 m apart and are separated by a time interval of (a) 2 sec (b) 1 sec." So perhaps each case, (a) and (b), is a separate question. But the way the user has presented the question makes it unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is presenting (a) and (b) as two possible options, but in the problem statement, it's a single question with the two time intervals given. Hmm, perhaps not. I think it's more likely that the question is considering each case separately, but the way it's written is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the initial problem is that the user wrote (a) and (b) as part of the question, but perhaps the actual question has two parts. However, since the user is providing a single multiple-choice question, I think perhaps the question is presenting either (a) or (b) for the time interval. Wait, but the way it's written is that in S, the events are separated by 6e8 m and a time interval of (a) 2 sec or (b) 1 sec. So perhaps the question is about each case, but the multiple-choice options are given as a single list, so perhaps the answer would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about both (a) and (b) in the same question, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the intended time interval is either 2 or 1 seconds.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually presenting two possibilities and asking which one is correct, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the original question is structured as a two-part question, but the way the user presented it is that each of (a) and (b) is a possible time interval, and the proper time is to be found for each.

But given that the multiple-choice options are single answers, I think the question is structured as two separate scenarios. So perhaps (a) is 2 sec, and (b) is 1 sec. So I'll have to compute both.

Wait, but the way the question is presented, it's a single question. Hmmm. Maybe I should proceed by considering each case, (a) and (b), and see what the proper time would be.

Starting with case (a), Δt = 2 seconds, Δx =6e8 m.

Compute τ² = (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2.

Δx/c = 6e8 / 3e8 = 2 seconds. So (Δx/c)^2 =4.

So τ² = (2)^2 -4 =0. So τ=0.

So the proper time is zero, which is option G. But option G says Δt' =0 and no reference frame S' can be found. Because if τ=0, the events are connected by a light-like interval, meaning that no inertial observer can see the events happening at the same place because that would require moving faster than light to catch up.

So in this case, the answer would be option G.

Now, case (b), Δt =1 second.

Again, Δx =6e8 m, so Δx/c =2 sec.

So τ² = (1)^2 - (2)^2 =1-4 =-3. Negative. So τ would be imaginary, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, in this scenario, the events are spacelike separated. That means there exists a reference frame where the two events occur at the same time, but not at the same place. Wait, but in this case, the spacetime interval is negative, which makes it spacelike.

Wait, but in the case of spacelike separation, the proper time is not defined because no single inertial frame will see both events happen at the same place, so the proper time is not real. Wait, no. Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the events are at the same place, but if the separation is spacelike, then such a frame exists where the events are simultaneous but not colocated, so the proper time isn't zero. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, proper time is defined when the events are timelike or lightlike. If they're spacelike, then no frame can have the events occurring at the same place, so the proper time isn't real. So in that case, the proper time is not defined, meaning that you can't have a proper time interval because there's no frame where both events happen at the same spot. So in case (b), when Δt=1 sec, the spatial separation is 6e8 m, so Δx/c=2 sec. Then the time interval is 1 sec, which is less than the spatial separation in terms of light time. So the events are spacelike separated, and thus, there's no proper time because no frame can have both events at the same location. So the proper time is not defined.

Wait, but the question is giving options, including option C: Δt' cannot be determined without additional information about the velocity of S' relative to S. But in case (a), we found that the proper time is zero, so answer G. In case (b), since the separation is spacelike, the proper time is not defined, but perhaps the question is only about case (a). Wait, the question seems to present both (a) and (b) as part of the same question, but perhaps more accurately, it's giving two possible time intervals and asking for the proper time in each scenario.

But perhaps the original question is only about one of them. Wait, let me read the question again.

"In a particular inertial reference frame S, two events occur a distance 6 × 10^8 m apart and are separated by a time interval of (a) 2 sec (b) 1 sec. What is the proper time interval between these two events?"

Oh, perhaps the question is presenting two possible time intervals, and the answer depends on which one is used. So the options would vary based on which time interval is considered.

Wait, but the options are given as A through J, each with a specific answer. So perhaps the correct answer is either G for case (a) or something else for case (b). Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the two cases as separate and the options include both possibilities, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it again. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events occur at the same location. So that frame S' must be moving such that the events are at the same place. But if the events are spacelike separated, then such a frame doesn't exist. If they're timelike, then the proper time is real, and if they're lightlike, then τ=0.

So for case (a), when Δt=2 sec:

Δx =6e8 m, so Δx/c=2 sec. Then τ² = (2)^2 - (2)^2 =0 → τ=0. So the answer is G.

For case (b), Δt=1 sec:

τ²=1² - (2)^2=1-4=-3 → τ is imaginary, so no proper time. So in this case, the proper time cannot be determined because the events are spacelike separated, and no frame exists where they occur at the same place. So the answer would be option C: cannot be determined without additional info about velocity, but wait, no. Because when the spacetime interval is spacelike, there's no frame where both events occur at the same place, so the question of proper time doesn't apply. So in case (b), the answer would be that the proper time is undefined, but looking at the options, there's no option that says that. Instead, option C says "cannot be determined without additional information about the velocity of S' relative to S." Hmm, but in reality, for case (b), it's impossible to have a proper time because the events are spacelike, so you can't find a frame where they are at the same place. So in that case, the proper time is not defined, but none of the options say that. Option C is about not being able to determine without knowing the velocity, but actually, you can determine that it's impossible, so the proper time is zero only in case (a), and in case (b), it's impossible, so perhaps the answer would be C for case (b), but I'm not sure.

But the way the question is presented, perhaps it's only about case (a), as the question might have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering both (a) and (b) as separate, but the options don't account for that.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually presenting two possible cases, but the options are for each case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is giving both (a) and (b) as possible time intervals, and the answer depends on which one applies. But the problem is, the user has presented the question as a single multiple-choice with options A-J, each with a single answer. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is G for case (a) and C for case (b). But the options given don't cover both scenarios, so perhaps the question is only about case (a), making the answer G.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. The proper time, τ, is the time interval measured in the frame where the two events occur at the same place. So, if the events are spacelike separated (Δx > cΔt), then no such frame exists, so τ is not defined. If they're timelike (Δx < cΔt), then τ is real and positive. If they're lightlike (Δx = cΔt), then τ=0.

In case (a), Δx =6e8 m, which is 2 light-seconds. Δt=2 sec. So cΔt= (3e8 m/s)(2 s)=6e8 m, so Δx = cΔt → lightlike. So τ=0. So answer is G.

In case (b), Δt=1 sec. So cΔt=3e8 m/s *1s=3e8 m < Δx=6e8 m. So Δx > cΔt → spacelike. So no frame where they occur at the same place, so proper time is undefined. So the answer would be C: cannot be determined without additional information.

But in the given options, option C is about not being able to determine without knowing the velocity. But in the case of spacelike events, you can determine that proper time is undefined because no such frame exists. So perhaps the correct answer is C when the events are spacelike because you can't find a frame where they occur together, so you can't determine the proper time. Wait, but proper time is only defined when the events are timelike. So in that case, for case (b), the answer would be that proper time is not defined, but the given options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about case (a), so the answer is G.

But looking back, the initial question says "are separated by a time interval of (a) 2 sec (b) 1 sec." So perhaps the question is giving two possible Δt values, and the possible answers are either G or C, depending on which part is being considered. But the way the multiple-choice is presented, only one option can be correct. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is G for case (a), and perhaps the question is only considering case (a). Alternatively, maybe the question is considering both cases together, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is G for case (a), and the question is only about case (a). So the answer would be G.

In this problem, we are tasked with determining the proper time interval between two events in a particular inertial reference frame \( S \), where the events are separated by a distance of \( \Delta x = 6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) and a time interval of either \( \Delta t = 2 \, \text{s} \) (case (a)) or \( \Delta t = 1 \, \text{s} \) (case (b)). The proper time interval \( \Delta t' \) is calculated using the spacetime interval formula:

\[
\tau^2 = \Delta t^2 - \frac{\Delta x^2}{c^2},
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light. The proper time \( \tau \) is the time interval measured in the reference frame where the two events occur at the same location. The interpretation depends on whether the events are timelike, spacelike, or light
