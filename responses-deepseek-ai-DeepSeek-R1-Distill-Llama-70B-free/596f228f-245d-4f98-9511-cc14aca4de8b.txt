Question:

A 50-year-old nurse who had been fired from his job at ahospital told his attorney, ÒI was fired because of my age, and I want to sue the hospital.Ó Based on this information, the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint against the hospital in federal court. As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurseÕs replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable. The hospital responded tothe complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against thenurseÕs attorney. Is the court likely to grant the hospitalÕs motion?

Options:

A: No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.
B: Yes, because the attorney should have known that age discrimination could not be proven in this case.
C: No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.
D: No, because the nurse's complaint was reasonable and thus cannot be sanctioned.
E: Yes, because the attorney did not consider the age of the replacement nurse before filing the complaint.
F: No, because sanctions are only proper when a complaint is filed with malicious intent.
G: No, because the attorney was acting in the best interests of his client.
H: Yes, because the nurseÕs complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.
I: Yes, because the nurseÕs attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.
J: Yes, because the hospital has the right to fire an employee without giving a reason.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a 50-year-old nurse who was fired and believes it's because of his age. He tells his attorney, who then files an age discrimination complaint in federal court. But then, it turns out the hospital hired a 52-year-old man as his replacement. That probably affects the age discrimination claim because if they hired someone older, it might not make sense that age was the reason for firing. 

Now, the hospital is responding by filing a motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney. The question is whether the court is likely to grant this motion. So, I need to understand when sanctions are appropriate in such situations.

I remember that under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 11, sanctions can be imposed if a claim is presented without a reasonable basis. The rule requires that before filing a document, the attorney must conduct a reasonable inquiry and have a basis in law and fact for the claims made.

In this case, the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint. However, the hospital's replacement was older, which undermines the age discrimination claim. The key point is whether the attorney had a reasonable basis to file the claim given this fact.

So, the attorney should have done a reasonable pre-filing investigation. If he didn't consider the age of the replacement, which is a crucial fact, that might mean he didn't conduct a proper inquiry. Filing a claim without such a basic fact could be considered a violation of Rule 11.

Looking at the options:

Option B says yes because the attorney should have known age discrimination couldn't be proven. That might be, but it's more about the merits than the procedure. Sanctions under Rule 11 are about the process, not whether the case would win.

Option H says yes because the complaint had contentions not warranted by law. That could apply if the law doesn't support it, but here the issue is more about the facts.

Option I says yes because the attorney failed to do a reasonable pre-filing inquiry. That seems to fit because not checking the replacement's age would be a failure in due diligence.

Option E says the attorney didn't consider the replacement's age before filing. That's similar to I but more specific. I think I is the correct reasoning because it's about the pre-filing inquiry.

So, the court would likely grant the motion if the attorney didn't do a reasonable investigation. The fact that the replacement was older is a material fact that should have been known. If the attorney didn't check that, it's a failure under Rule 11.

Other options: Option C says no because the hospital didn't give a chance to withdraw. But Rule 11 doesn't require that; parties can file a motion directly. So C is incorrect.

Options A, D, F, G, J don't seem to fit the Rule 11 criteria here. So the correct answer is either H or I.

Wait, H is about legal contentions not warranted by existing law. But the issue here is the factual basis, not the legal argument. So I is more accurate because it's about the factual inquiry.

So the answer should be I.

The court is likely to grant the hospital's motion for sanctions if the attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. This rule requires attorneys to ensure that claims are supported by both law and fact. In this case, the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint without adequately investigating the key fact that the replacement was older, which undermines the discrimination claim. This failure in due diligence likely violates Rule 11, making sanctions appropriate.

Answer: I
