Question:

In 1993, a farmer had good record title to a farm in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees. Before the professor had paid the rancher and taken his deed, the professor visited the farm and observed the fence. However, the teacher was not present when the professor visited the property, and nothing suggested who f anyone was using it. In any case, the professor did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The professor then recorded the deed. Note: This jurisdiction uses Grantor Grantee Indices and has no Tract IndexThe jurisdiction's recording act provides: "Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded. "In 2008, in an action to quiet title to the farm, which of the following parties would have priority of title?

Options:

A: The investor.
B: The professor, only if he had searched the title prior to his purchase.
C: The teacher.
D: The rancher.
E: The rancher, if he could prove he paid the highest price.
F: The farmer, if he could prove the initial sale to his son was invalid.
G: The professor.
H: The farmer's son.
I: The teacher, if he could prove he visited the farm regularly.
J: The investor, if he could prove he was the first to record the deed.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with recording acts and priority of title. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

So, the scenario starts in 1993 with a farmer who has a fee simple absolute title to a farm. That means he owns it outright. Then in 1994, the farmer delivers a deed to his son for $1,000. The deed is signed, names the son and his heirs as grantees, and looks valid. But the son didn't record it. So, I remember that recording a deed is important for notice to others, but if you don't record, it might still be valid between the parties but could cause issues with third parties later.

Next, in 1998, an investor approaches the farmer. The investor knows about the farmer-to-son deed but still asks to buy the farm for $10,000. The farmer gives the investor a deed, and the investor records it promptly. The investor's intent is to get color of title and maybe acquire ownership through adverse possession. They built a fence around the farm that year. So the investor is trying to establish some claim, perhaps through adverse possession, by having color of title.

Then, in 1999, the son sells the farm to a rancher for $15,000. The son gives the rancher a deed, but the rancher doesn't search the title, doesn't check the property, and doesn't record the deed. So the rancher has a deed but hasn't done the due diligence to ensure it's valid against others.

In 2003, a teacher buys the farm from the investor for $20,000. The teacher examines the property, searches the title, and knows about the prior farmer-to-son deed. The teacher doesn't live there but visits twice a week. He records his deed. So the teacher seems to have done his homework, checking the title and recording promptly.

In 2007, the rancher sells to a professor for $25,000. Before paying, the professor visits the farm, sees the fence, but doesn't see the teacher. He doesn't search the title before buying. He records the deed after. 

The question is about who has priority in 2008 when they all go to court to quiet title. The jurisdiction uses Grantor-Grantee indices, no tract index, and the recording act says that any unrecorded conveyance is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith who pays valuable consideration and records first.

So, let me think about the key points here. The recording act is probably a notice or race-notice type, but the exact wording is important. The act says that an unrecorded conveyance is void against a subsequent purchaser who is a good faith buyer, pays valuable consideration, and records first.

So, let's map out the chain of events and the deeds:

1. Farmer to Son in 1994: Deed delivered but not recorded. So the son has the deed, but it's unrecorded.
2. Farmer to Investor in 1998: Investor records immediately. Investor knows about the son's deed, so does that affect his good faith? Because if he knew, he might not be a bona fide purchaser.
3. Son to Rancher in 1999: Deed not recorded. Rancher didn't search title, so he might not be a BFP.
4. Investor to Teacher in 2003: Teacher records, and he knew about the son's deed. So he's aware, but maybe he's taking from someone who had a prior claim.
5. Rancher to Professor in 2007: Professor didn't search title and didn't know about prior deeds, perhaps.

Wait, but the key is the recording act's effect. Let's see who was the first to record and who qualifies as subsequent purchasers in good faith.

The first conveyance is Farmer to Son in 1994, unrecorded. Then, Farmer to Investor in 1998, which is recorded. So, under the recording act, the investor's deed would take priority over the son's because the son's was unrecorded. But wait, the investor had knowledge of the son's deed. So, if the investor knew about the prior conveyance, he can't be a bona fide purchaser. Because a BFP must purchase without notice of prior claims.

So, the investor, being aware of the son's deed, can't claim protection under the recording act. Therefore, the son's unrecorded deed would still be valid against the investor because the investor wasn't a BFP. So the son's title is better than the investor's.

But then, what about the teacher? The teacher bought from the investor in 2003. The teacher searched the title and found the farmer-to-son deed, so he knew about it. So, the teacher can't be a BFP either because he had knowledge. Therefore, the teacher's deed, even though recorded, would be junior to the son's unrecorded deed because the teacher wasn't a BFP.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The son's deed was unrecorded. The investor's deed was recorded in 1998, but the investor wasn't a BFP because he knew about the son's deed. So the investor's recorded deed doesn't take priority over the son's. So the son's deed remains valid, and the investor's is void against the son.

So, the son's title is still good. Then the son sold to the rancher in 1999, but the rancher didn't record. So the rancher's deed is also unrecorded. Then the rancher sold to the professor in 2007, who also didn't search the title but recorded.

So, the professor's deed is recorded, but he bought from the rancher, who had an unrecorded deed. Let's see if the professor is a BFP.

The professor didn't search the title, but he saw the fence built by the investor. But he didn't know who built it. So, does the fence give him inquiry notice? Inquiry notice is when a situation puts a person on notice that they should investigate further. If the professor saw the fence, maybe he should have inquired who built it or who owns the property. But in this case, the professor didn't make any attempts to search the title. So, perhaps he's not a BFP because he had a reason to inquire but didn't.

Wait, but the recording act here is about whether the subsequent purchaser is a BFP who records first. The act says that prior unrecorded conveyances are void against such a purchaser.

So, let's track each conveyance:

1. Farmer to Son (1994): unrecorded. Son has the title.
2. Farmer to Investor (1998): Investor records, but knew about the son's deed, so not BFP. So, the investor's deed doesn't prevail against the son's. So, the son still owns.
3. Son to Rancher (1999): unrecorded. Now, the rancher has a claim, but unrecorded. So, if a subsequent BFP comes along, they could take priority.
4. Investor to Teacher (2003): Teacher knows about the son's deed, so not BFP. Teacher's deed, even recorded, doesn't take priority over the son's.
5. Rancher to Professor (2007): Professor didn't search title, but saw the fence. If the fence constitutes notice, then professor had inquiry notice, making him not a BFP. But if he didn't, then he might be.

Wait, but the professor's purchase is from the rancher, whose deed was unrecorded. So, when the professor records, does he take priority over the son's unrecorded deed?

Wait, no. Because the son's deed was prior in time. The professor's claim comes through the rancher, who got it from the son. But the son's deed was unrecorded, so when the rancher sold to the professor, the rancher's deed was unrecorded. The professor, if he's a BFP, would take priority over the son because the son's deed was unrecorded, but the rancher's was also unrecorded.

Wait, no, because the rancher's deed is from the son, who had an unrecorded deed. So, the rancher's title depends on the son's title. If the son's title is invalid against a BFP, then the rancher's title would also be invalid.

But the professor didn't search the title, so he might not be a BFP. So, the professor can't take priority over the son.

Wait, but the son's deed was unrecorded. The professor purchased from the rancher, whose deed was unrecorded. So, the professor's claim is derivative of the rancher's, which is derivative of the son's. So, the son's deed being unrecorded means that any subsequent purchaser (like the investor) who is a BFP and records would take priority. But the investor wasn't a BFP because he knew about the son's deed.

So, the son's title remains. Then the rancher's deed is from the son, but unrecorded. So, when the rancher sells to the professor, who didn't search the title, can the professor be a BFP?

The professor didn't know about the prior deeds, but he saw the fence. The fence was built by the investor, but the professor didn't know that. So, does the fence give the professor constructive notice? Or is it insufficient?

In some jurisdictions, possession of the property (like someone living there) gives inquiry notice, but an unoccupied property with a fence might not necessarily. Since the professor saw the fence but didn't know who built it, maybe he's not on inquiry notice. So, he could be a BFP.

But wait, the recording act in this case says that an unrecorded conveyance is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for value who records first.

So, the son's deed was unrecorded. The professor, as a subsequent purchaser, would take priority if he's a BFP and records first. But the professor recorded after the teacher, right?

Wait, let's line up the recording dates:

- Farmer to investor: 1998, recorded immediately.
- Son to rancher: 1999, not recorded.
- Investor to teacher: 2003, recorded.
- Rancher to professor: 2007, recorded.

Wait, so the professor recorded in 2007, but the teacher recorded in 2003. So, the teacher's deed is recorded before the professor's.

But the teacher bought from the investor, whose deed was recorded in 1998, but the investor wasn't a BFP because he knew about the son's deed. So, the teacher's title would be derivative of the investor's, which may not be valid against the son's unrecorded deed.

But the teacher knew about the son's deed, so he's not a BFP either. So, the teacher's recorded deed doesn't help because he had knowledge.

So, the son's unrecorded deed is still the valid one. Then, the rancher's deed is from the son, but unrecorded. The rancher sells to the professor, who didn't search but recorded.

Wait, but the professor's deed is from the rancher, whose title is from the son, who had an unrecorded deed. So, the professor's title would depend on whether he's a BFP when he bought from the rancher.

If the professor is a BFP, then his recorded deed would take priority over the son's unrecorded deed. But if he's not a BFP, then the son's title remains.

So, the key is whether the professor is a BFP. He didn't search the title, but he saw the fence. Does seeing the fence constitute notice?

In property law, the concept of inquiry notice comes into play. If a buyer sees something that would make a reasonable person investigate further, they're said to be on inquiry notice. For example, if someone is in possession of the property, that's notice. But a fence might not be enough unless it's clear that someone is claiming ownership.

In this case, the professor saw the fence but didn't know who built it. There's nothing indicating ownership, so maybe he's not on inquiry notice. Therefore, he could be a BFP. If he is, then his recorded deed would take priority over the son's unrecorded deed, even though the son's deed was earlier.

So, let's recap the possible chain:

- Farmer to son (1994, unrecorded)
- Farmer to investor (1998, recorded but investor had knowledge)
- Son to rancher (1999, unrecorded)
- Investor to teacher (2003, recorded but teacher had knowledge)
- Rancher to professor (2007, recorded, professor possibly BFP)

If the professor is a BFP, then his deed takes priority over the son's because the son's was unrecorded, and the professor recorded first as a BFP.

But wait, the son's deed was in 1994, so it's earlier in time. But because it's unrecorded, a subsequent BFP who records would take priority.

So, if the professor is a BFP, he takes priority over the son. But if not, then the son's title holds.

Alternatively, the teacher's situation: he bought from the investor, who wasn't a BFP, so the teacher's title is no better than the investor's. Since the investor couldn't take priority over the son, the teacher can't either.

So, if the professor is a BFP, he would have priority. But if not, the son does.

So, the question is whether the professor had knowledge or notice. The professor didn't search the title, which is a red flag, but he saw the fence. If the fence doesn't give him notice, then he could be a BFP.

In many jurisdictions, fences are considered part of the property and don't necessarily give notice of a claim unless accompanied by other signs of possession or use. Since the teacher visited twice a week but the professor didn't see anyone, maybe the fence alone isn't enough. So, the professor might be considered a BFP.

If the professor is a BFP, then his recorded deed (2007) would take priority over the son's unrecorded deed (1994). So, the professor would have priority.

But wait, the rancher's deed to the professor was from 2007. But the son's deed was in 1994. So, the professor's claim comes through the rancher, who got it from the son. If the son's title was unrecorded, and the professor is a BFP, then the professor's title would be valid against the son's.

So, the possible priority would be the professor, but only if he's a BFP. Alternatively, if the professor isn't a BFP, then the son still holds.

But looking back, the rancher didn't record his deed. So, when the professor bought from the rancher, the rancher's deed was unrecorded. So, the professor, as a BFP, would take priority over the rancher's unrecorded deed.

Wait, no. The rancher's deed is from the son, who had an unrecorded deed. So, the rancher's title is only as good as the son's. So, if the son's title is invalid against a BFP, then the rancher's title is also invalid. So, the professor, as a BFP, would take the title from the rancher, who had a valid title because the son's title was unrecorded and the professor is a BFP. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, maybe the teacher's situation is better. The teacher bought from the investor, who had a recorded deed, but the investor wasn't a BFP. So, the teacher's title is junior to the son's. So, the teacher doesn't have a good claim.

So, the possible candidates are the son, the professor, or the teacher.

Wait, but the son's deed was unrecorded, so when the professor, as a BFP, records, he takes priority over the son. So, the professor would have the better title.

But the options given are:

A: Investor

B: Professor only if searched

C: Teacher

D: Rancher

E: Rancher if highest price

F: Farmer if initial sale invalid

G: Professor

H: Son

I: Teacher if visited regularly

J: Investor if first to record

So, if the professor is a BFP, then he has priority. So, option G would be correct. But if the professor isn't a BFP because he saw the fence, then the son would have priority (option H).

But earlier, I thought the fence might not be enough for inquiry notice. So, the professor could be a BFP, making option G correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the son's deed, being unrecorded, is void against the professor, a subsequent BFP who recorded. So, the professor would have priority.

Wait, but let me think about the chain again. The son's deed is from 1994, unrecorded. The professor's deed is from 2007, recorded, and he's a BFP. So, under the recording act, the professor's deed takes priority over the son's because the son's wasn't recorded, and the professor is a subsequent BFP who recorded.

So, the answer would be G: The professor.

But wait, another angle: the investor's deed was recorded in 1998, but the investor wasn't a BFP. So, the farmer's title was already gone when he sold to the investor? Because the farmer had already conveyed to the son in 1994. So, when the farmer sold to the investor in 1998, he had nothing to convey, because the son already owned it. Unless the son's deed was invalid, but the facts don't say that.

Wait, but the son's deed was delivered in 1994, so the son owns it from then. The farmer had no title to sell to the investor in 1998, so the investor's deed is worthless. Therefore, the teacher, who bought from the investor, also has no title. The rancher bought from the son, who had title, but the rancher didn't record. So, the professor bought from the rancher, whose title is valid but unrecorded. So, when the professor records, if he's a BFP, he takes priority over the son's unrecorded deed.

So, the key is whether the professor is a BFP.

If the professor is a BFP, then his recorded deed takes priority over the son's unrecorded deed. Therefore, the professor has priority.

Alternatively, the son's deed is still valid because the investor wasn't a BFP, so the son's title is good, and the rancher's deed is from the son, making the professor's deed valid if he's a BFP.

I think the correct answer is that the professor has priority because he's a BFP who recorded. So, the answer is G.
</think>

The question revolves around priority of title under a recording act that states: "Every conveyance
