Okay, so I have this question about the Premack Principle. Hmm, I remember that Premack is related to reinforcement in behavioral psychology. Let me think. The Premack Principle is about using a high-probability behavior as a reinforcer for a low-probability behavior. So, the idea is that if a person or animal does a behavior they don't do often (like homework), you can reinforce it by allowing them to do something they do frequently (like play a game).

Wait, the question is asking what the reinforcer is when using this principle. So the Premack Principle uses a high-frequency behavior as a reward. So the reinforcer here is a behavior that the individual already does often. Like, if a child doesn't want to eat their veggies (low frequency), you might let them play outside (high frequency) as a reward.

Looking at the options, option B says "a behavior that occurs frequently." That fits because the reinforcer is the high-frequency behavior. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, are there any other options that might fit? Let me check. Option C is a specific reward given after. That sounds more like a traditional reinforcer, like a treat, which is a primary reinforcer. The Premack Principle is more about using another behavior as the reward. So C is probably not the right choice.

So yeah, I think the answer is B. The reinforcer is a behavior that occurs frequently.

The Premack Principle uses a high-frequency behavior to reinforce a low-frequency behavior. The reinforcer is the high-frequency behavior the individual already exhibits. Among the options, B matches this description.

Answer: B
