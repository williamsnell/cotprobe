Okay, so I've got this question about a constant-volume gas thermometer. Hmm, I remember that these thermometers work based on pressure changes because the volume is fixed. Oh right, the idea is that when the temperature changes, the pressure changes proportionally since it's a perfect gas.

The question says the thermometer indicates a pressure of 6.69 kPa at the triple point of water, which is 273.16 K. And we need to find the change in pressure that corresponds to a 1 K change in temperature at that point.

Wait, the triple point is where water exists in all three phases, and that's a standard temperature. I think I remember that the gas thermometer is often calibrated at this point. So, the pressure at 273.16 K is 6.69 kPa.

I recall that for a constant-volume gas thermometer, the temperature is directly proportional to the pressure. So the relationship should be T = kP, where k is a constant. Alternatively, maybe it's P proportional to T, so P = T * (P0/T0), where P0 is the pressure at T0, which is the triple point here.

Wait, let me think. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. At constant volume V and amount n, P is proportional to T. So P1/T1 = P2/T2. And since it's a thermometer, maybe it's set up so that at T0 (273.16 K), P is P0 (6.69 kPa). So the proportionality is P = (P0 / T0) * T.

But the question is about the change in pressure when the temperature changes by 1 K. So, we're looking for ΔP when ΔT is 1 K.

Since P is proportional to T, the change in pressure would be based on the slope of this linear relationship. So the coefficient would be P0/T0, because P = (P0/T0) * T. So the derivative dP/dT would be P0/T0. So for each 1 K change in T, the pressure changes by P0/T0.

So let's compute that. P0 is 6.69 kPa, T0 is 273.16 K. So 6.69 / 273.16. Let me calculate that.

Let me do the division: 6.69 divided by 273.16. Hmm, 273 is about 273.16. Let me approximate this. 6.69 / 273.16 ≈ let's see, 273 goes into 669 about 2.44 times. Wait, no, 6.69 is 669/100. So 669 divided by 273.16 is approximately 2.447. Then divided by 100, so 0.02447 kPa per K. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6.69 is in kPa, 273.16 in K.

Wait, 6.69 / 273.16 = approximately 0.02447 kPa/K. So for each 1 K change, the pressure changes by about 0.02447 kPa. Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E is 0.0245 kPa, which is very close. Option B is 0.0299, which is higher. So E seems right.

But wait, wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 6.69 / 273.16 more accurately.

6.69 / 273.16 = ?

Well, 273.16 * 0.024 is 273.16 * 0.02 = 5.4632, plus 273.16 * 0.004=1.09264. So 5.4632 + 1.09264=6.55584. That's 0.024 * 273.16 = 6.55584. But our numerator is 6.69, which is higher. So the result is a little more than 0.024.

The difference is 6.69 - 6.55584 = 0.13416. So how much more is that? 0.13416 / 273.16 ≈ 0.00049. So total is 0.024 + 0.00049 ≈ 0.02449, which is around 0.0245 kPa/K. So that's 0.0245 kPa per 1 K change. So the change in pressure for 1 K is approximately 0.0245 kPa. So the correct option is E.

To determine the change in pressure corresponding to a 1 K change in temperature for a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer, we use the relationship between pressure and temperature. For a constant-volume gas, the ideal gas law implies that pressure is directly proportional to temperature: 

\[
P = \frac{P_0}{T_0} \cdot T
\]

Here, \(P_0 = 6.69 \, \mathrm{kPa}\) is the pressure at the triple point of water, and \(T_0 = 273.16 \, \mathrm{K}\) is the temperature at the triple point. The change in pressure for a 1 K change in temperature is given by the slope of this linear relationship:

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{P_0}{T_0}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{6.69}{273.16} \approx 0.0245 \, \mathrm{kPa/K}
\]

Thus, for a 1 K change in temperature, the pressure changes by approximately \(0.0245 \, \mathrm{kPa}\). Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**E: 0.0245 kPa**
