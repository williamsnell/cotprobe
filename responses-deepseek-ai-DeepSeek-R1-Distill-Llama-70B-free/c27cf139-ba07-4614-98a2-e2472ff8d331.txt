Alright, so I've got this question here asking which of the listed world leaders was assassinated. The options are A through J, each being a different leader. Let me try to think through each one and see which ones I remember as being assassinated.

Starting with option A: Ferdinand Marcos. I know he was the president of the Philippines, and he's known for his authoritarian rule. I think he died in exile, maybe in Hawaii, so probably not assassinated.

Option B is Neville Chamberlain. He was the British Prime Minister during the lead-up to WWII, famous for the "peace for our time" speech. I believe he died of natural causes, maybe cancer, so not assassinated.

Option C: Margaret Thatcher. She was the UK's first female PM, known for her conservative policies. She resigned and died much later, I think in her 80s from a stroke, so no assassination there.

Option D: Lee Kuan Yew. He was the first PM of Singapore and had a long tenure. He died at 91, I think it was natural causes, so no.

Option E: Winston Churchill. The famous British leader during WWII. He died in his 90s, natural death, so not assassinated.

Option F: Fidel Castro. The Cuban revolutionary leader. He died in 2016, I think from natural causes, not assassination.

Option G: Golda Meir. She was the Prime Minister of Israel. I remember she died of cancer, so not assassinated.

Option H: Muammar Gaddafi. He was the Libyan leader. I think he was killed during the uprising, maybe captured and killed by rebels, which could count as assassination, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. I'll keep that in mind.

Option I: Indira Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of India. I definitely remember that she was assassinated by her own Sikh bodyguards in 1984. That's a significant event, so that's a strong candidate.

Option J: Nelson Mandela. The South African leader who fought against apartheid. He died of natural causes in 2013, at a ripe age, so no assassination.

So, from this, the ones that stand out are options I and H. Now, I need to decide which one is correct. I'm more certain about Indira Gandhi because her assassination is a well-known historical event. Gaddafi was killed in the Libyan Civil War, but I'm not sure if that's classified as assassination or just killed in action. Assassination usually implies a targeted killing, often by a small group or individual, whereas Gaddafi was captured and killed during a conflict. So maybe Indira Gandhi is the correct answer here.
