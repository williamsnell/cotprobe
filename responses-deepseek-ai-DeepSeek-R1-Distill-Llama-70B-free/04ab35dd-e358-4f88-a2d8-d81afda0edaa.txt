Okay, so I've got this question about legal schools and their views on how customs become law. Hmm, I remember that different legal schools have different theories on the sources of law and how they're recognized.

The question is asking which school believes that a custom becomes law when it's recognized by courts. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Critical Legal Studies School. I think they focus more on how law is used to maintain power structures and are critical of traditional legal theories. Not sure if they're about custom becoming law through courts.

Option B: Legal Realism School. Legal Realists believe that law is what judges decide, so they focus on judicial decisions and the actual outcomes of cases. So maybe this is the one, since it's about courts recognizing customs.

Option C: Historical School. They emphasize that law develops over time based on the history and culture of a society. I think they might say that custom becomes law through long usage, not just court recognition.

Option D: Natural Law School. They believe law comes from a higher, moral authority, like nature or God. So customs would be part of natural law, not dependent on courts.

Option E: Analytical School. This is more about analyzing legal concepts and the structure of law, maybe focusing on definitions rather than sources.

Option F: Law and Economics School. They apply economic principles to law, looking at efficiency. Not directly related to customs becoming law via courts.

Option G: Sociological School. They study law in society, how it interacts with social structures. They might look at how customs become law through social practices, not necessarily through courts.

Option H: Normative School. This term is a bit vague; normative could relate to what the law should be, but I'm not sure how it ties to customs specifically.

Option I: Feminist Jurisprudence School. Focuses on gender issues in law. Probably not about the recognition of customs by courts.

Option J: Positivist School. Positivists believe that law is based on human-made rules, like statutes, and that it's separate from morality. They might say that law is what is written and enforced, so maybe customs become law when they're written down or enforced by courts.

Wait, but I thought positivists are more about law as commands from a sovereign, enforced by the state. So maybe it's about being written and having a sanction, but does that involve court recognition?

The question is specifically about judicial recognition. Legal Realists focus on judges' decisions, so maybe they're the ones who see customs as law once courts recognize them.

Alternatively, the Historical School believes in custom as a source, but through long usage rather than court decisions. So the key here is judicial recognition.

So between B and J. Positivists might say that custom becomes law when it's recognized and enforced by the courts, which are part of the state. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the main point is that the Positivist School holds that law is posited (i.e., formally enacted) by a sovereign. But custom can become law if it's recognized by the courts, which is a positivist viewpoint because it's through an official body.

Alternatively, the Historical School sees custom as law because it's evolved over time, regardless of court decisions. But the question is about needing judicial recognition.

So the answer is either B or J. I'm a bit torn. Let me think again.

Positivists believe that law is derived from the state, and for custom to become law, it needs to be incorporated through the legal system, like courts. So when courts recognize a custom, it becomes part of the law according to positivists.

Whereas Legal Realists focus more on how judges actually decide cases, which might include recognizing customs, but I'm not sure if that's their main stance on how customs become law.

Another angle: In common law systems, customs can become law through judicial recognition, which is a positivist approach because it's about the courts (state organs) making it law.

So the answer is J: Positivist School.

The question asks which legal school supports the view that a custom becomes law when it receives judicial recognition by courts. To answer this, it's important to evaluate the different schools of thought:

- **Critical Legal Studies School (A):** Focuses on power structures and critique of traditional legal theories, not specifically about customs becoming law through courts.
- **Legal Realism School (B):** Emphasizes that law is what judges decide, focusing on judicial decisions. This could align with the idea of customs being recognized by courts, but it's more about judicial discretion than the formal process of recognition.
- **Historical School (C):** Believes law evolves from history and culture, with customs becoming law through long usage, not necessarily through court recognition.
- **Natural Law School (D):** Holds that law comes from a higher moral authority, so customs are part of natural law, independent of courts.
- **Analytical School (E):** Focuses on analyzing legal concepts, not on how customs become law.
- **Law and Economics School (F):** Applies economic principles to law, unrelated to customs becoming law through courts.
- **Sociological School (G):** Studies law in society, focusing on social practices rather than judicial recognition.
- **Normative School (H):** Relates to what law should be, not specifically about customs.
- **Feminist Jurisprudence School (I):** Focuses on gender issues in law, not relevant to the question.
- **Positivist School (J):** Believes law is based on human-made rules enforced by the state. For positivists, customs become law when recognized and enforced by courts, as this is a formal process through state organs.

While Legal Realism (B) focuses on judicial decisions, the Positivist School (J) more directly aligns with the idea that customs become law through judicial recognition, as this is a formal process tied to the state's legal system. Therefore, the best answer is:

J: Positivist School

Answer: J
