Question:

A shrimp fishery is located in the coastal waters of a state. A large part of the catch is either frozen or canned, and distributed nationwide. The state legislature passed a statute requiring payment of a license fee of $25 for each shrimp boat owned by a resident and $2,500 for each boat owned by a nonresident. A resident of a neighboring state was a commercial shrimp fisherman who was denied a license after refusing to pay the $2,500 fee. The resident brought suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state shrimp boat licensing statute. The federal court should

Options:

A: hear the case on its merits.
B: abstain from jurisdiction because it involves the operations of a commercial business.
C: dismiss the case because the resident is not a citizen of the state implementing the statute.
D: dismiss the suit because it involves a question of state law.
E: hear the case but uphold the statute as it is within the state's rights to regulate its resources.
F: hear the case because it involves a potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause.
G: dismiss the suit because the resident lacks standing.
H: dismiss the suit because the resident has not exhausted all state-level legal remedies.
I: abstain from jurisdiction because the constitutional issue should be litigated first in a state court.
J: dismiss the suit because the federal court lacks jurisdiction over state legislature decisions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a shrimp fishery and state licensing fees. Let's break it down step by step. 

The situation is that there's a state with a shrimp fishery. They have a statute that charges different license fees based on whether the shrimp boat owner is a resident or a nonresident. Residents pay $25, and nonresidents pay $2,500. A commercial shrimp fisherman from a neighboring state refused to pay the higher fee and was denied a license. Now, he's suing in federal court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute.

The question is asking what the federal court should do. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that when a state law is challenged in federal court, especially regarding constitutional issues, the federal courts generally have jurisdiction under the supremacy clause. But there are exceptions, like when the case involves state-specific matters where federal courts should abstain.

Looking at the statute, it's charging nonresidents much more than residents. That seems like it could be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause or the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The Equal Protection Clause applies to states, so if the law treats residents and nonresidents differently without a substantial reason, it might be unconstitutional.

Now, what about the options? Let's go through them.

Option A: Hear the case on its merits. That's possible if the federal court has jurisdiction and the issue is ripe. But I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Abstain because it's a commercial business operation. I don't think so. Federal courts usually handle constitutional challenges even in business contexts.

Option C: Dismiss because the plaintiff isn't a state citizen. No, because federal courts can hear cases where a state's law is challenged, regardless of the plaintiff's residency, especially when it's a constitutional issue.

Option D: Dismiss as a state law question. But the challenge is constitutional, so federal courts can take it.

Option E: Hear and uphold the statute. Maybe states have some rights to regulate resources, but the fee discrepancy seems high. The Supreme Court has ruled on similar issues, like in Baldwin v. Fish and Game Commission of Montana, where a higher elk hunting fee for nonresidents was upheld. But more recent cases might have different outcomes. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, the commerce clause might come into play if the fee affects interstate commerce. Shrimping is a commercial activity, so if the fee is exorbitant, it could impede interstate commerce, violating the commerce clause.

Option F: Hear because of Equal Protection. That makes sense because the law treats residents and nonresidents differently. The Equal Protection Clause requires that similarly situated individuals be treated alike. But I think the Supreme Court has held that states can treat residents and nonresidents differently concerning conservation of resources, but the distinction must be substantial.

Option G: Dismiss for lack of standing. The plaintiff was denied a license because he didn't pay, so he has standing because he's directly affected.

Option H: Dismiss for not exhausting state remedies. Federal courts can hear constitutional challenges without requiring plaintiffs to go through state courts first, especially when federal issues are involved.

Option I: Abstain to let state courts decide the constitutional issue first. Sometimes federal courts abstain to avoid conflicting decisions, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option J: Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over state legislature decisions. No, federal courts can review state laws for constitutionality.

So, considering the options, the main issues are whether the law violates the Equal Protection Clause or the Commerce Clause. The federal court should hear the case because it's a constitutional matter. The state's differential fee could be seen as discrimination against interstate commerce, which the Commerce Clause prohibits unless it's necessary for a legitimate local purpose.

Wait, but in the case of Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.S. 385 (1948), the Supreme Court held that South Carolina's higher license fees for nonresident shrimpers were unconstitutional. The Court said that while states can regulate their fisheries, the fees must not be discriminatory against nonresidents without a justifiable basis. The fee here is 100 times higher, which seems excessive and likely unconstitutional.

So the federal court should hear the case because it's a constitutional violation. Looking back at the options, F says "hear the case because it involves a potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause." Alternatively, if the issue is more about the Commerce Clause, but the options don't mention that. So I think F is the correct choice because it's about equal protection, even though commerce might also be a factor.

Another angle: the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV also prohibits states from discriminating against citizens of other states in terms of fundamental rights, like earning a livelihood. So the court should hear the case on those grounds as well.

So the correct answer is F: hear the case because it involves a potential Equal Protection violation.

The question revolves around a state statute that imposes significantly different license fees on resident and nonresident shrimp boat owners. A nonresident commercial shrimp fisherman challenged the statute in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The federal court must decide how to proceed.

The statute charges residents $25 and nonresidents $2,500, raising concerns about discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause and potentially the Commerce Clause. Federal courts generally have jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges, even when state laws are involved. Dismissal options based on standing, state law questions, or lack of jurisdiction are incorrect because the plaintiff is directly affected, and federal courts can adjudicate constitutional issues.

The key issue is whether the fee disparity violates the Equal Protection Clause or related constitutional principles. In *Toomer v. Witsell*, the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot impose discriminatory fees on nonresidents without a substantial justification. Here, the 100-fold difference in fees likely lacks such justification, making the statute unconstitutional.

Among the options, the most appropriate is that the federal court should hear the case because it involves a potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause.
