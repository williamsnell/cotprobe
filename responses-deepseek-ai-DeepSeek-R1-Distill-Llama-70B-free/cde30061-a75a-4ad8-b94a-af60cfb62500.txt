Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the toy store selling puzzles. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question says that in December, a toy store sold 934 puzzles. Each puzzle costs $6, including tax. I need to find the total cost of the puzzles sold, including tax. And then choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, okay. So the basic approach here is to multiply the number of puzzles by the cost per puzzle. That should give me the total cost. Let me write that down.

Number of puzzles = 934
Cost per puzzle = $6

Total cost = 934 * 6

Wait, let me calculate that. 900 times 6 is 5400, right? And 34 times 6 is... 34*6 is 204. So adding those together, 5400 + 204 = 5604.

So the total cost is $5,604. Let me check the options. Option E is $5,604. So the answer should be E.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step. 

934 * 6:
Multiply 6 by 4, which is 24. Write down 4, carry over 2.
Then 6*3 is 18, plus the carried 2 is 20. Write 0, carry over 2.
6*9 is 54, plus 2 is 56. So it's 5,604. Yep, that's correct.

So option E is the right answer.

The total cost of the puzzles sold is calculated by multiplying the number of puzzles (934) by the cost per puzzle ($6). 

934 * 6 = 5,604.

The correct option is E.
