Okay, so I've got this question here about the weight of 1,000 cubic feet of air at STP. Hmm, I remember STP stands for Standard Temperature and Pressure, which is 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere pressure. Right?

Wait, I think the density of air at STP is something I learned before. Density is mass per unit volume, so if I can find the density, I can multiply by the volume to get mass, and then convert that to weight in ounces.

But wait, weight and mass aren't the same, but in common contexts, especially in problems like this, they often use mass and weight interchangeably, so I think it's safe to proceed.

So, the density of air at STP, I think it's about 1.29 kg/m³. Or was it in grams per liter? Oh wait, 1 g/L is about 1.29 kg/m³ because 1 m³ is 1000 liters. So yeah, that sounds right.

But wait, the volume here is in cubic feet, not cubic meters. So I need to convert 1,000 cubic feet to cubic meters to use that density. Or maybe there's another way. Alternatively, I could find the density in pounds per cubic foot or ounces per cubic foot.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's think about the units.

First, figure out the mass of 1,000 cubic feet of air. To do that, I need the density in compatible units.

I know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 0.0283168 cubic meters. So 1,000 cubic feet would be 1,000 * 0.0283168 = about 28.3168 cubic meters.

Now, the density of air is 1.29 kg/m³, so mass is density times volume. That would be 1.29 kg/m³ * 28.3168 m³ ≈ let's calculate that.

1.29 * 28.3168 = Let me compute. 1 *28 is 28, 0.29*28 is about 8.12, so total around 36.12 kg. Wait, that's an approximation. Let me do it more accurately.

1.29 * 28.3168:
Multiply 1.29 by 28: 1.29 * 28 = 36.12.

Then 1.29 * 0.3168 is approximately 0.409. So total is about 36.12 + 0.409 = 36.529 kg.

So the mass is approximately 36.529 kilograms.

But wait, the question is about ounces. Oh right, so I need to convert kilograms to ounces. I remember that 1 kg is about 35.274 ounces. So 36.529 kg * 35.274 oz/kg.

Let me compute that. 36.529 * 35.274.

Hmm, let me approximate. 36 * 35 is 1260. But more accurately:

35.274 * 36.529 = let's see:

35 * 36 = 1260

35 * 0.529 = 18.515

0.274 *36 = 9.864

0.274 *0.529 ≈ 0.145

Adding all together: 1260 + 18.515 +9.864 +0.145 = 1260 + (18.515+9.864)=28.379 + 0.145=28.524. So total is 1260 +28.524=1288.524 ounces.

Wait, that's about 1,288.5 ounces. But let me check my calculations again because this seems a bit high.

Wait, wait. Let me think about alternative approach. Maybe I should find the density in ounces per cubic foot directly, which might be easier.

I remember that the density of air at STP is approximately 0.0765 pounds per cubic foot. Oh wait, that rings a bell. Because 1 cubic foot of air weighs about 0.0765 lb.

Wait, so 1,000 cubic feet would be 1,000 * 0.0765 lb. That's 76.5 pounds.

Wait, but that's in pounds. So to convert to ounces, since 1 pound is 16 ounces, 76.5 lb *16 oz/lb = 1,224 ounces.

Wait, that's a different number than before. So which one is correct?

Wait a minute, I think I messed up the density value. Let me clarify.

So, another approach: at STP, one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters, which is about 0.0224 cubic meters per mole. The molar mass of air is about 28.97 g/mol. So the density would be (28.97 g/mol) / (22.4 L/mol) = 1.29 g/L, which is 1.29 kg/m³. So that's correct.

But when I calculated using cubic feet, I got around 1,288 ounces, and using pounds per cubic foot, I got 1,224 ounces. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion when using cubic feet.

Let me try again.

Density of air at STP: 0.0765 lb/ft³.

So 1,000 ft³ * 0.0765 lb/ft³ = 76.5 lb.

Convert 76.5 lb to ounces: 76.5 * 16 = 1,224 oz.

So the weight is approximately 1,224 ounces.

Looking at the options, let me see:

A: 1.10 ×10^3 oz → 1,100

B: 2.50 ×10^3 → 2,500

C: 1.00 ×10^3 → 1,000

D: 8.00 ×10^2 → 800

E: 2.00 ×10^3 → 2,000

F:1.5×10^3 →1,500

G:1.29×10^3 →1,290

H:1.50×10^3 →1,500

I: 1.00×10^2 →100

J:1.75×10^3 →1,750

So 1,224 is closest to option G (1,290) or perhaps option E is 2,000, which is way higher. Alternatively, perhaps my calculation is off.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the grams first.

Density is 1.29 kg/m³ = 1,290 g/m³.

1 cubic foot is 0.0283168 m³, so 1,000 cubic feet is 28.3168 m³.

Mass = density * volume = 1,290 g/m³ * 28.3168 m³ = let's compute that.

1,290 * 28.3168 = ?

Well, 1,000 *28.3168 =28,316.8

290 *28.3168 = let's calculate 200*28.3168=5,663.36 and 90*28.3168=2,548.512 → total 5,663.36 +2,548.512=8,211.872

So total mass is 28,316.8 +8,211.872 =36,528.672 grams.

Convert grams to ounces: 1 ounce is about 28.3495 grams.

So 36,528.672 g ÷ 28.3495 g/oz ≈ let's compute.

36,528.672 /28.3495 ≈ Let me approximate.

28.3495 * 1,200 = 34,000 (approx, since 28 *1,200=33,600).

36,528.672 -34,000=2,528.672.

28.3495 * 90 = 2,551.455.

So that's 1,200 +90=1,290 ounces, but wait, 90 is too much because 28.3495 *90=2,551 which is larger than 2,528. So perhaps 1,290 - (2,551-2,528.672)/(28.3495) → wait, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, 36,528.672 /28.3495 ≈ approximately 1,290 ounces.

Wait, because 28.3495 is about 28.35, so 36,528.672 /28.35 → Let's compute 36,528.672 ÷28.35.

Well, 28.35 * 1,200 =34,020.

36,528.672 -34,020=2,508.672.

28.35 * 88 = 2,494.8.

So 1,200 +88=1,288. So approximately 1,288 ounces.

Wait, so that matches my earlier calculation of about 1,288 ounces.

Looking back at the options, G is 1.29 ×10^3 oz, which is 1,290 oz. So that's very close. So option G is the answer.

But wait, earlier when I used the pounds per cubic foot approach, I got 76.5 lb, which is 1,224 oz, which is about 1.22e3 oz. Which is about 1,224, which is a bit lower than 1,290.

Hmm, so which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the density in lb/ft³ is more accurate. Let me double-check the density of air at STP in lb/ft³.

I think that the density of dry air at STP is approximately 0.0765 lb/ft³. So 1,000 cubic feet would be 76.5 lb, which is 76.5 *16=1,224 oz.

But that conflicts with the 1,290 oz from the kg/m³ approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion factors. Let me verify the exact density.

Wait, let's compute the density properly.

At STP, pressure is 1 atm (101325 Pa), temperature is 273.15 K.

The molar mass of air is about 28.97 g/mol (approximately).

Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

Density is (mass)/(volume) = (n*M)/(V) = (P*M)/(R*T).

So M is molar mass in kg/kmol. Wait, 28.97 g/mol is 0.02897 kg/mol.

So density ρ = (P * M) / (R*T).

P = 101325 Pa.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 273.15 K.

So ρ = (101325 * 0.02897) / (8.314 * 273.15).

Compute numerator:101325 *0.02897 ≈ Let's calculate.

101325 *0.02897 = let's see:

100,000 *0.02897 =2,897.

1,325 *0.02897 ≈ 1,325 *0.03=39.75, minus 1,325*(0.03-0.02897)=1,325*0.00103≈1.36. So approx 39.75-1.36≈38.39.

So total numerator ≈2,897 +38.39=2,935.39.

Denominator:8.314 *273.15≈8.314 *273 ≈2,272. (Because 8 *273=2,184, 0.314*273≈85.7 → total≈2,269.7).

So ρ≈2,935.39 /2,269.7 ≈1.293 kg/m³.

So that's about 1.293 kg/m³, which is 1.293 g/L, which matches the initial value.

So 1,293 kg/m³ → 1.293 kg/m³. So 1,000 cubic feet is 28.3168 m³.

Mass is 1.293 kg/m³ *28.3168 m³ ≈ (1.293 *28.3168) kg.

1.293 *28=36.244.

1.293 *0.3168≈0.410.

So total ≈36.244 +0.410=36.654 kg.

Convert kg to ounces: 36.654 kg * (1000 g/kg) / (28.3495 g/oz) =36,654 g /28.3495 g/oz ≈ let's compute.

36,654 /28.3495 ≈1,293 ounces.

So that's about 1,293 oz, which is 1.293e3 oz, which is option G.

But earlier using the lb/ft³ approach, I got 76.5 lb, which is 1,224 oz.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the 0.0765 lb/ft³ is for different conditions. Because STP in chemistry is 0°C and 1 atm, but in some engineering contexts, standard conditions might be 15°C and 1 atm. But the question says STP, so 0°C and 1 atm.

Wait, let me check the density of air at STP in lb/ft³.

I found a reference that says at 60°F (15°C), 1 atm, the density is about 0.0765 lb/ft³. But at 0°C, it's higher.

So perhaps the 0.0765 lb/ft³ is at 15°C, not 0°C. So that would explain the discrepancy.

So the correct density at STP (0°C) is higher than 0.0765 lb/ft³.

Wait, let me calculate the density in lb/ft³ at STP.

Density ρ =1.293 kg/m³.

Convert kg/m³ to lb/ft³.

We know that 1 kg/m³ = 0.062427961 lb/ft³.

So 1.293 kg/m³ *0.062427961 lb/ft³/kg/m³ ≈ let's compute.

1.293 *0.062427961 ≈0.0807 lb/ft³.

So about 0.0807 lb/ft³.

So 1,000 cubic feet would be 1,000 *0.0807 =80.7 lb.

Convert to ounces: 80.7 lb *16 oz/lb=1,291 ounces.

Which is about 1,291 oz, matching the earlier calculation of 1,293 oz.

So the correct weight is approximately 1,291 ounces, which is 1.29 ×10³ oz, so option G.

So the correct answer is G.
</think>

To determine the weight of 1,000 cubic feet of air at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure: 0°C and 1 atm), we start by using the density of air at these conditions. The density of dry air at STP is approximately **1.29 kg/m³** or **0.0807 lb/ft³**.

### Step 1: Calculate the mass of 1,000 cubic feet of air
Using the density in SI units:
- 1 cubic foot = 0.0283168 cubic meters, so 1,000 cubic feet = \( 1,000 \times 0.0283168 = 28.3168 \, \text{m}^3 \).
- Mass = density × volume = \( 1.29 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 28.3168 \, \text{m}^3 \approx 36.65 \, \text{kg} \).

### Step 2: Convert mass to ounces
- 1 kilogram = 1,000 grams, so \( 36.65 \, \text{kg} = 36,650 \, \text{g} \).
- 1 ounce = 28.3495 grams, so the weight in ounces is:
  \[
  \frac{36,650}{28.3495} \approx 1,293 \, \text{ounces}.
  \]

### Step 3: Verify using the density in lb/ft³
Using the density of air at STP in Imperial units:
- Density = \( 0.0807 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \).
- Mass = \( 1,000 \, \text{ft}^3 \times 0.0807 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 = 80.7 \, \text{lb} \).
- Convert to ounces: \( 80.7 \, \text{lb} \times 16 \, \text{oz/lb} = 1,291 \, \text{oz} \).

### Final Answer
Both methods yield approximately **1,290 ounces**, which matches the closest option provided:

**G: \( 1.29 \times 10^3 \, \text{oz} \)**.

Answer: G
