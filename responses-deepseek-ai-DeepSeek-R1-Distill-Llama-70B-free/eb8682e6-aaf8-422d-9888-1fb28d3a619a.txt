Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Maya civilization. The question is asking which of the listed options was NOT a central element of Mayan culture by 1900 B.P. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each option is saying. The question is about what they did NOT include, so I'm looking for the one thing that wasn't part of their culture at that time.

Option A: Hieroglyphic written language and calendar. From what I remember, the Maya were known for their advanced writing system and their calendars. They had a complex system, so this was definitely present.

Option B: Stratified societies ruled by kings. I think the Maya had a system where there were kings or rulers, and society was divided into classes. So this was part of their culture.

Option C: Sophisticated bronze producing industry. Hmm, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Wait, didn't the Maya not have a strong bronze industry? I thought that might have been more the Aztecs or other cultures. Or maybe the Incas? Wait, no, the Incas used bronze as well. The Maya, though, I'm not sure. Maybe they didn't focus on bronze as much because they had other materials like stone and obsidian. Or perhaps they didn't have a large-scale bronze industry.

Option D: Construction of large-scale pyramids. Oh yeah, the Maya built big pyramids as temples, like the ones at Chichen Itza or Tikal. So this was definitely part of their culture.

Option E: Usage of gold currency. I'm not too sure about this. I think the Maya used cacao beans as currency, maybe, or other items. Did they use gold as currency? Or was it more for jewelry and ornaments? I'm leaning towards they didn't use gold as a standard currency, but I'm not certain.

Option F: System of slavery. I believe the Maya did have slaves, often captives from wars. So this was present.

Option G: Ritual ball games and reverence for jade. The ball game was a big part of their culture, and jade was highly valued. So yes, this was included.

Option H: Established agriculture. The Maya were skilled farmers, growing crops like maize, beans, and squash. So this was definitely present.

Option I: Advanced maritime trade routes. I think the Maya had trade networks, including by sea, so this was part of their system. They traded goods like obsidian, cacao, and textiles.

Option J: Practice of human sacrifice. Yes, the Maya practiced human sacrifice, often to appease their gods. So this was included.

Now, the question is about which was NOT included. So looking back, option C is about bronze production. Did the Maya have a sophisticated bronze industry? I'm trying to recall. From what I remember, the Maya civilization flourished before the widespread use of bronze in Mesoamerica. Bronze working came a bit later, perhaps during the post-classic period, but by 1900 B.P. which is roughly 100 B.C., I think they were more focused on stone tools, not bronze. So the answer might be C.

Wait, but then option E is about gold currency. Did they use gold as money? I think the Aztecs used cacao beans as currency, but the Maya might have used something else. Maybe gold was used for ornaments but not as a standardized currency. Alternatively, perhaps they didn't use gold at all as currency. So option E might be the answer.

Wait, let me clarify. The question is about which element was NOT present. So which of these was absent.

If the Maya didn't have a sophisticated bronze industry, then option C is the answer. Alternatively, if they didn't use gold as currency, then E would be the answer.

I'm a bit confused between C and E.

Wait, I think the Maya did have bronze tools but perhaps not a sophisticated industry. Alternatively, maybe they didn't have bronze at all. Let me think. The use of bronze in Mesoamerica is a bit later than the classic Maya period. The classic Maya period was from about 200 to 900 CE. So 1900 B.P. would be around 100 BCE, which is before the classic period. So maybe during that time, they hadn't developed bronze working yet. So C would be correct.

Alternatively, considering that the Olmec civilization, which preceded the Maya, didn't have bronze either. Bronze technology might have arrived later. So the Maya might not have had a sophisticated bronze industry by 1900 B.P.

As for option E, did they use gold as currency? I think they used cacao beans and other items as currency, but gold was more for jewelry and status symbols, not as a standardized currency. So E would be the correct answer if the question is about currency.

Wait, but the question is about what they did NOT include. So if they didn't have a bronze industry, then C is correct. If they didn't use gold as currency, E is correct.

I think the key here is to identify which of these they didn't have. The Maya definitely had pyramids, writing, calendars, kings, agriculture, trade, ball games, jade, slavery, and human sacrifice. That leaves C and E as possibilities.

But did they have a bronze industry? I think Mesoamerican civilizations like the Aztecs and Maya had some knowledge of metallurgy, but perhaps not on a large scale. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, because they didn't use gold as currency. I've read that the Maya used cacao beans, shells, and textiles as forms of currency, not gold. So E would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about what they did NOT include. So if they didn't have a bronze producing industry, that's the answer. Or if they didn't use gold as currency.

Another angle: The options are about central elements. So which of these was absent. I'm more confident that the Maya did not have a sophisticated bronze industry, so option C is the correct answer.

By 1900 B.P., the Maya civilization had many advanced features, including a hieroglyphic written language and calendar (A), stratified societies ruled by kings (B), large-scale pyramids (D), ritual ball games and reverence for jade (G), an established agricultural system (H), advanced maritime trade routes (I), and the practice of human sacrifice (J). They also had a system of slavery (F). However, two options stand out as potential answers: C ("a sophisticated bronze producing industry") and E ("usage of gold currency").

The Maya did not have a sophisticated bronze-producing industry. Bronze technology, which involves alloying copper and tin, was not widely developed in Mesoamerica during this period. The Maya relied more on stone and obsidian tools rather than bronze. On the other hand, while the Maya valued gold for jewelry and status symbols, they did not use it as a standardized currency; instead, they used items like cacao beans, shells, and textiles for trade.

Given that the question asks for the element that was NOT included, the lack of a sophisticated bronze-producing industry (C) is the most accurate answer, as this was not a central element of their culture at that time.

Answer: C
