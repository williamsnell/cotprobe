Question:

The Lincoln Theater had been showing old films for two months. Admission was $2.00 and average daily attendance was 200. Then, the owner decided to present a recent blockbuster film. Admission price was raised to $4.00 to cover the cost of the new film and average daily attendance rose to 600. Does this example cast doubt upon the law of demand?

Options:

A: The demand curve is upward-sloping
B: The admission price increase caused the demand to rise
C: The law of demand predicts constant attendance regardless of price
D: The demand curve is perfectly inelastic
E: The law of demand is disproved
F: The law of demand is irrelevant in this scenario
G: The law of demand only applies to goods, not services
H: The change in attendance is due to factors other than price
I: The law of demand remains intact
J: The increase in attendance was a coincidence unrelated to the price change

Okay, so I've got this question about economics, specifically the law of demand. Hmm, I remember the law of demand says that as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa, assuming all else is equal. So it's like a inverse relationship.

The question is about a theater that was showing old films for two months. They had an admission price of $2.00 and an average daily attendance of 200 people. Then, they switched to showing a recent blockbuster and raised the price to $4.00. But instead of attendance dropping, it actually rose to 600 people. The question is whether this example casts doubt on the law of demand.

Wait, so higher price leads to higher attendance. That's the opposite of what the law of demand would predict, right? But wait, maybe I'm missing something. The scenario might not be as straightforward because other factors could be influencing the demand besides the price.

Oh, right, the law of demand assumes ceteris paribusâ€”all other factors being equal. So if something else changed, like the movie being shown, that could affect demand. In the first case, they were showing old films, which might not attract as many people. When they switched to a blockbuster, which is probably more popular, more people wanted to watch it. So the increase in attendance is not just because of the price change but because of the change in the product itself.

So even though the price went up, more people came because they really wanted to see the new movie. That means the demand increased, which isn't because of the price but because of the change in the movie's appeal. So the law of demand isn't being violated here because the demand curve itself shifted due to factors other than price.

Looking at the options, let me go through them.

Option A: The demand curve is upward-sloping. Wait, that's not right. The standard demand curve is downward sloping. An upward slope would imply higher price leads to higher quantity demanded, which isn't typical unless it's a Giffen good or something, but that's rare.

Option B: The admission price increase caused the demand to rise. That would suggest that higher price caused higher quantity, which would go against the law of demand, but that's not the case here because the change in the movie is the cause.

Option C: The law of demand predicts constant attendance regardless of price. No, the law doesn't say that. It says as price increases, quantity demanded decreases, so attendance should go down if price goes up, ceteris paribus.

Option D: The demand curve is perfectly inelastic. Perfectly inelastic would mean that quantity doesn't change at all with price. But here, quantity did change, so that's not it.

Option E: The law of demand is disproved. No, because other factors are at play. The law still holds because it's about price affecting quantity, assuming other factors are constant.

Option F: The law of demand is irrelevant here. No, the law is still relevant but only when other factors are held constant.

Option G: The law of demand only applies to goods, not services. I don't think that's correct. Services should also follow the law of demand.

Option H: The change in attendance is due to factors other than price. That makes sense because the movie changed from old films to a blockbuster, which likely increased demand.

Option I: The law of demand remains intact. Yes, because the increase in attendance isn't because of the price but because of the change in the movie, so the law still holds when considering only price changes.

Option J: The increase was a coincidence. I don't think it's a coincidence; it's due to the movie's popularity.

So the correct answer is either H or I. The question is whether the example casts doubt on the law of demand. Since other factors are changing, the law isn't being doubted. So option I says the law remains intact, and H explains why.

But looking back, the options are about whether the example casts doubt on the law of demand. The law of demand would predict that if price increases, quantity demanded decreases, assuming all else equal. But in this case, all else wasn't equal. The product changed, so the demand curve shifted. Therefore, the law isn't violated or doubted; it's just that other factors are causing a shift in demand.

So the correct answer is either H or I. The question is asking if the example casts doubt on the law. So since the change in attendance is due to factors other than price, the law still holds. So the answer would be H or I.

Wait, I think the options are about what the example implies. If the law of demand is about price affecting quantity, then when price goes up and quantity goes up, without other factors, it would cast doubt. But since other factors did change, it doesn't. So the answer is that the change in attendance is due to factors other than price, which is option H. Or option I, which says the law remains intact.

Alternatively, option I says the law remains intact. So the example doesn't cast doubt on it because other factors are at play.

So the correct answer is I: The law of demand remains intact.

The law of demand states that, ceteris paribus, an increase in price leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded. In this scenario, the Lincoln Theater increased the admission price from $2.00 to $4.00 and saw attendance rise from 200 to 600. At first glance, this might seem to contradict the law of demand. However, the change in attendance is not solely due to the price increase but also because the theater switched from showing old films to a recent blockbuster, which likely increased the appeal and demand for the movie. 

The law of demand assumes all other factors remain constant, but in this case, the product itself changed, causing a shift in the demand curve. Therefore, the example does not cast doubt on the law of demand because the law still holds when considering only the effect of price changes. The increase in attendance is due to factors other than price, such as the popularity of the new film.

Option I correctly captures this reasoning: the law of demand remains intact because the observed change in attendance is explained by factors other than price.
