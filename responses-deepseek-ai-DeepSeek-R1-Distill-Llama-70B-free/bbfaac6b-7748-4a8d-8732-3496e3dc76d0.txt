Okay, so I've got this problem here about carbon diffusing into a steel rod. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on diffusion problems, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: a hot mild steel rod is placed in a carbonaceous substance. The initial carbon concentration in the rod is c1 = 0.22% by weight. The surface concentration at equilibrium is c_e = 1.4%. We need to find the time it takes for a point 0.15 cm below the surface to reach 0.78% carbon. The diffusivity of carbon in steel is given as 5.7e-6 cm²/sec.

I remember that this is a diffusion problem, probably involving Fick's laws. Since it's a semi-infinite solid with a constant surface concentration, I think the error function solution might apply here.

The general equation for the concentration in a semi-infinite solid during diffusion is:

(c_x - c_initial) / (c_surface - c_initial) = 1 - erf(x/(2*sqrt(D*t)))

Wait, or is it the complementary error function? Oh right, sometimes it's written as (c - c_i)/(c_s - c_i) = 1 - erf(x/(2√(D t))).

Wait, let me make sure. So, the concentration at a distance x from the surface after time t is given by that equation. So, I should plug in the known values.

Given:
c_x = 0.78% (target concentration at point x)
c_initial = 0.22%
c_surface (c_e) = 1.4%
x = 0.15 cm
D = 5.7e-6 cm²/s

So, first compute (c_x - c_initial)/(c_surface - c_initial):

(0.78 - 0.22)/(1.4 - 0.22) = (0.56)/(1.18) ≈ 0.4745.

So, 0.4745 = 1 - erf(y), where y is x/(2√(D t)).

Rearranging, erf(y) = 1 - 0.4745 = 0.5255.

Wait, no, wait: 0.4745 = 1 - erf(y), so erf(y) = 1 - 0.4745 = 0.5255.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, no.

Wait, the equation is (c_x - c_initial)/(c_surface - c_initial) = 1 - erf(x/(2√(D t))).

So, 0.4745 = 1 - erf(y), which means erf(y) = 1 - 0.4745 = 0.5255.

Wait, but the error function tables I've seen... let me think. The error function, erf(y), gives values between 0 and 1 for y from 0 to ∞. So, if erf(y)=0.5255, I need to find the y value that corresponds to that.

I might need to use an error function table or approximation. Alternatively, I can use a calculator or an approximate formula.

Wait, I think I remember that erf(0.5) is about 0.5205, and erf(0.6) is approximately 0.6039. Oh wait, no, let me think again. Let me try to recall some values:

erf(0.5) ≈ 0.5205.

erf(0.6): I'm not sure. Let me think of some points. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think: erf(0.5) is about 0.5205, as I said. So, 0.5255 is slightly higher than that. So, y would be a little larger than 0.5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a linear approximation between y=0.5 and y=0.6.

Wait, wait, let me think: I think at y=0.5, erf(0.5)=0.5205, y=0.55: I'm not exactly sure, but let's imagine.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the error function values more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use an iterative approach. Let me try to find y such that erf(y)=0.5255.

Wait, I'll try to make a table:

y | erf(y)
0.4 → 0.4284
0.45 → 0.4755
0.475 → 0.4903
0.5 → 0.5205
0.525 → 0.5312
0.53 → 0.5375
Wait, but my target is 0.5255. So, perhaps that corresponds to y ≈ 0.52.

Wait, wait, let me think. At y=0.52, what is erf(y)?

Hmm, I might need a more precise table. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate formula for the inverse error function.

Wait, another approach: using a calculator. But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can use a Taylor expansion or an approximation.

Alternatively, use the approximation formula for inverse error function. Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I can look for y such that erf(y)=0.5255.

Wait, let's go back. Let me think about the target value again. So, from the earlier calculation:

erf(y) = 0.5255.

What's the value of y? Let me try to estimate:

From known values:

erf(0.5)=0.5205,
erf(0.51)=?

I think at y=0.51, erf(y) is approximately 0.5244. Let me check:

Wait, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps I can use linear interpolation between y=0.5 and y=0.55.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I can proceed with y ≈ 0.51, since 0.5255 is just a bit above 0.5205.

Wait, let me think. Let me assume that erf(0.51) is approximately 0.5255. So, y ≈ 0.51. Okay, perhaps that's a good approximation.

So, y = x/(2√(D t)) = 0.15 cm / (2 * sqrt(5.7e-6 cm²/s * t)).

Wait, but wait. Let me write that correctly: y = x/(2*sqrt(D*t)).

So,

y = 0.15 / (2 * sqrt(5.7e-6 * t)) )

But wait, sqrt(D*t) is sqrt( (5.7e-6) * t ), so 2*sqrt(D t) is 2 * sqrt(5.7e-6 * t).

Wait, but the units of D are cm²/s, so 5.7e-6 cm²/s. So, when multiplied by time in seconds, becomes cm², sqrt gives cm. So, the denominator is in cm, x is 0.15 cm, so units are consistent.

So, let me write:

y = 0.15 / (2 * sqrt(5.7e-6 * t)) )

But from earlier, y ≈ 0.51, so:

0.51 = 0.15 / (2 * sqrt(5.7e-6 * t) )

Let me solve for sqrt(5.7e-6 * t):

sqrt(5.7e-6 * t) = 0.15 / (2 * 0.51 )

Calculate denominator: 2*0.51=1.02

So, sqrt(5.7e-6 * t) = 0.15 / 1.02 ≈ 0.14706 cm.

Wait, no, 0.15 /1.02 is approximately 0.14706 cm.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that division: 0.15 / 1.02 = 0.1470588... ≈ 0.1471 cm.

So, sqrt(5.7e-6 * t) ≈ 0.1471.

Square both sides:

5.7e-6 * t ≈ (0.1471)^2.

Compute (0.1471)^2: 

0.1471 * 0.1471.

Let me compute 0.14^2 = 0.0196. 0.0071^2 is negligible, but let's be precise:

(0.1471)^2 = (0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0071)^2 = 0.1^2 + 2*0.1*0.04 + 2*0.1*0.0071 + 0.04^2 + 2*0.04*0.0071 + 0.0071^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1471 * 1471 and then adjust the decimal.

But perhaps a quicker approach: 0.1471 * 0.1471.

Hmm, 0.14 * 0.14 = 0.0196.

0.14 * 0.0071 = 0.000994.

0.0071 * 0.14 = same as above.

0.0071 * 0.0071 = approx 0.00005041.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use calculator-like steps.

Wait, 0.1471 * 0.1471:

Calculate 1471 * 1471 first. Let's see:

1471 × 1471:

Let me compute that:

First, 1400 ×1400 = 1,960,000.

But wait, 1471 is 1400 +71.

So,

(1400 +71)(1400 +71) = 1400² + 2*1400*71 + 71².

1400²=1,960,000.

2*1400*71= 2*1400=2800; 2800*71=198,800.

71²=5041.

So, total is 1,960,000 + 198,800 + 5,041 = 

1,960,000 + 198,800 = 2,158,800.

2,158,800 +5,041= 2,163,841.

So, 1471 ×1471=2,163,841.

Now, since 0.1471 is 1471e-4, so (1471e-4)^2 = 2,163,841e-8 = 0.02163841.

So, (0.1471)^2 ≈ 0.021638.

So, back to equation:

5.7e-6 * t ≈ 0.021638.

Solve for t:

t ≈ 0.021638 / (5.7e-6).

Compute that.

0.021638 / 5.7e-6 = (2.1638e-2) / (5.7e-6) 

= (2.1638 / 5.7) * (1e4).

2.1638 /5.7 → let's compute that.

5.7 × 0.38 = 2.166, because 5 ×0.38=1.9, 0.7 ×0.38=0.266. 1.9 +0.266=2.166.

So, 2.1638 is about 0.38 times 5.7. So, approximately 0.38.

So,

(2.1638e-2)/(5.7e-6) ≈ (0.38) * 1e4 = 3800 seconds.

Wait, because (2.1638e-2)/(5.7e-6) = (2.1638/5.7) * (1e-2/1e-6) )= (0.379) * (1e4) = 3790 seconds.

Wait, because 1e-2 /1e-6 is 1e4.

So, t ≈ 3790 seconds.

Now, convert seconds to hours.

3790 s ÷ 3600 s/hr ≈ 1.0528 hours.

Approximately 1.05 hours.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.5 hr, and option J is 1.1 hr, option G is 0.55, option B is 0.75, etc.

Wait, but wait, my approximation for y was 0.51, but perhaps the exact value might be a bit higher, leading to a longer time.

Wait, let me double-check my error function value.

Earlier, I assumed that erf(0.51)≈0.5255. Let me check more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use a better approximation for the error function.

The error function can be approximated using a series expansion:

erf(y) = (2/sqrt(π)) * (y - y^3/(3*1!) + y^5/(5*2!) - y^7/(7*3!) + ... )

But let's compute erf(0.51):

Compute up to a few terms.

So, y=0.51.

Compute each term:

First term: y = 0.51

Second term: y^3/(3*1!) = (0.51)^3 /3 = (0.132651)/3 ≈ 0.044217.

Third term: y^5/(5*2!) = (0.51)^5 / (5*2) = (0.034188)/10 ≈ 0.0034188.

Fourth term: y^7/(7*3!) = (0.51)^7 / (7*6) = (0.0177143)/42 ≈ 0.0004215.

Fifth term: y^9/(9*4!) = (0.51)^9 / (9*24) = (0.0090337)/216 ≈ 0.0000418.

So, putting it together:

erf(y) = (2/sqrt(π)) [ y - y^3/3 + y^5/(10) - y^7/(42) + y^9/(216) - ... ]

Compute the series inside:

= 0.51 - 0.044217 + 0.0034188 - 0.0004215 + 0.0000418.

Let's compute step by step:

Start with 0.51.

Subtract 0.044217: 0.51 -0.044217=0.465783.

Add 0.0034188: 0.465783 +0.0034188=0.4692018.

Subtract 0.0004215: 0.4692018 -0.0004215=0.4687803.

Add 0.0000418: 0.4687803 +0.0000418≈0.4688221.

Multiply by 2/sqrt(π):

sqrt(π) ≈1.77245, so 2/1.77245 ≈1.12838.

So, erf(0.51) ≈1.12838 * 0.4688221 ≈.

Compute 1.12838 * 0.4688221.

Let me compute:

0.4688221 * 1 = 0.4688221

0.4688221 * 0.12838 = ?

Wait, perhaps compute 0.4688221 * 0.1 = 0.04688221.

0.4688221 * 0.02 = 0.00937644.

0.4688221 *0.00838= Let's approximate: 0.4688221 *0.008=0.0037505768; 0.4688221*0.00038=0.000178113.

Adding these: 0.0037505768 +0.000178113≈0.00392869.

So, total 0.12838 contribution: 0.04688221 +0.00937644 +0.00392869 ≈0.06018734.

So, total erf(y)≈0.4688221 +0.06018734≈0.529009.

Wait, that can't be right because 0.4688221 is the sum before multiplying by 1.12838. Wait, no. Wait, earlier step:

Wait, the sum inside the brackets is 0.4688221. Then, multiply by 1.12838.

So, 0.4688221 *1.12838 ≈.

Let me compute 0.4688221 *1 =0.4688221.

0.4688221 *0.1 =0.04688221.

0.4688221 *0.02=0.00937644.

0.4688221 *0.008=0.0037505768.

0.4688221 *0.00038≈0.0001781.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.4688221 *1.12838.

Alternatively, use approximate multiplication.

Approximate 0.4688 *1.12838:

Multiply 0.4688 by 1.12838:

Let me compute 0.4688 * 1 =0.4688.

0.4688 *0.1=0.04688.

0.4688 *0.02=0.009376.

0.4688 *0.008=0.0037504.

0.4688 *0.00038≈0.000178.

Adding these:

0.4688 +0.04688=0.51568.

+0.009376=0.525056.

+0.0037504=0.5288064.

+0.000178≈0.5289844.

So, approximately 0.5290.

Wait, but earlier when I thought erf(0.5)=0.5205 and at y=0.51, erf(y)=0.5290. But wait, earlier I thought erf(0.51)=0.5255, but according to this calculation, it's about 0.5290.

Wait, but the target erf(y) is 0.5255, which is between erf(0.5) (0.5205) and erf(0.51) (0.5290). So, perhaps y is around 0.505 or something.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use linear interpolation between y=0.5 and y=0.51.

At y=0.5: erf(y)=0.5205.

At y=0.51: erf(y)=0.5290.

We need erf(y)=0.5255.

The difference between 0.5205 and 0.5255 is 0.005.

The total change from y=0.5 to y
