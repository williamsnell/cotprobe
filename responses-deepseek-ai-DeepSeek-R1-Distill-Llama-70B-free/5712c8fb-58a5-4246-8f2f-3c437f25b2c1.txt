Question:

What is a transgenic animal? Briefly describe a few ways in which they have impacted the field of genetics.

Options:

A: Transgenic animals are those that have adapted to extreme environments through selective breeding techniques.
B: Transgenic animals are those that have been enhanced with cybernetic implants. Their impact on genetics is limited to speculative fiction.
C: Transgenic animals are those that have been cloned
D: A transgenic animal is one that has undergone a spontaneous mutation that affects its phenotype. They have helped in the study of gene regulation and mutation effects.
E: A transgenic animal is one that has had exogenous DNA artificially introduced into its genome. They have significantly contributed to our understanding of development, tissue-specific gene expression, development and differentiation of the immune system, and disease.
F: Transgenic animals are those that have been subjected to radiation to induce genetic changes. They have been instrumental in studying mutation rates and DNA repair mechanisms.
G: Transgenic animals are those that have naturally evolved new traits
H: A transgenic animal is one that has had its DNA sequence decoded and fully mapped. They have played a role in the identification of genetic markers.
I: Transgenic animals are those that have been genetically modified to express human genes. They have been used to produce pharmaceuticals and to model human diseases.
J: Transgenic animals are those that have been crossbred with other species

Okay, so I have this question about transgenic animals and their impact on genetics. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that transgenic animals have something to do with genetic modification. Let's think about each option.

Option A says it's about selective breeding for extreme environments. Wait, no, selective breeding is traditional and doesn't involve adding new genes from other species. So A is probably wrong.

Option B mentions cybernetic implants. That sounds more like science fiction, like cyborgs. I don't think that's what transgenic means. So B is out.

Option C is cloning. Cloned animals are genetically identical to the original, but that's not the same as adding foreign DNA. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D talks about spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutations happen naturally, not by artificial introduction. So D is not correct.

Option E says exogenous DNA is introduced. Exogenous means from outside, so that fits. And it lists impacts like studying development, gene expression, immune system, and diseases. I remember that transgenic animals are used for these purposes, so E looks good.

Option F involves radiation to induce mutations. That's a mutagenesis approach, not transgenic. So F is incorrect.

Option G is natural evolution. Transgenic is about artificial modification, so G isn't right.

Option H is about DNA sequencing. That's mapping the genome, not modifying it. So H is wrong.

Option I says they express human genes for pharmaceuticals and disease modeling. That's part of what transgenic animals do, but it's more specific. E is broader and includes more uses, so I think E is better.

Option J is crossbreeding species, which is hybridization, not genetic modification. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. It correctly describes transgenic animals and their impact on various genetic studies.

A transgenic animal is one that has had exogenous DNA artificially introduced into its genome. They have significantly contributed to our understanding of development, tissue-specific gene expression, development and differentiation of the immune system, and disease.

The correct answer is E.
