Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about interferometry. So, a 5 cm thick transparent sample is being examined using green light with a wavelength of 550 nm. The accuracy desired is 1 part in 2 million. I need to find the fraction of the fringe width that any distortions must be measured, and whether it's possible.

Hmm, I remember that in interferometry, the fringe width is related to the wavelength of the light and the setup of the interferometer. But wait, let's think about what this accuracy means. The accuracy is 1 in 2 million, which is a very small fraction. So, 1/2,000,000 would be 0.0000005, but since percentages are involved, maybe I need to convert that.

Wait, the problem asks for the fraction as a percentage. So 1 part in 2 million is 1/(2e6) = 0.0000005. To get that in percentage, I multiply by 100, so 0.00005%. Wait, that seems really small. But the options are in percentages, so I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I got the question wrong. The accuracy of 1 part in 2 million refers to the measurement of the path difference, perhaps. Because in interferometry, the measurement is related to the phase shift, which depends on the path difference relative to the wavelength.

So the basic idea is that the path difference (d) that can be measured is related to the wavelength (λ) and the number of fringes (N). The formula is something like d = (N + 1/2)λ. But wait, for a thick sample, maybe we're considering the optical path length.

Wait, no, the sample is transparent, so the light passes through it. The optical path difference (OPD) would be 2t, where t is the thickness, if it's a Michelson interferometer setup, because the light goes through the sample twice (once in each pass). Or wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the OPD could be the difference in the path lengths between the sample and the reference arm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about measuring the thickness of the sample. So the OPD is 2t*(n-1), where n is the refractive index? Hmm, but I'm not sure if the refractive index is given here. It's a transparent sample, but n is probably close to 1 for something like glass or plastic. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I can assume n is 1. Wait, that can't be right because then the OPD would be zero. Hmm, perhaps the problem is just considering the physical thickness, and the OPD is 2t, because the light goes through the sample and back. Or maybe the sample is in one arm, making the OPD t*(n-1), but without n, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The key point is that the accuracy required is 1 part in 2 million, which is a measure of how precisely the fringe shifts can be measured.

In interferometry, the resolution is often given by the wavelength divided by the number of fringes or something like that. Alternatively, the phase measurement accuracy is related to the wavelength. Since each fringe corresponds to a half-wavelength shift, the phase is 2π per fringe. So, the phase accuracy would be a fraction of that.

Wait, but the problem is about the fraction of the fringe width. So, the fringe width (sometimes called the interval) is the distance between two consecutive bright or dark fringes. The width of each fringe is usually the same as the interval in a two-beam interferometer. So the total fringe width plus interval would be twice the fringe width, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the tolerance as a fraction of the fringe width.

Wait, maybe the key formula here is that the measurement accuracy (delta) is lambda/(2*pi) for phase shifts. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem states that distortions must be measured to a certain fraction of the fringe width. So, the maximum allowable distortion would be a fraction f of the fringe width. Since the accuracy is 1 in 2e6, this f would correspond to (1/2e6) in terms of the wavelength, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: The fringe width (w) is given by w = lambda / (2D) * L, where D is the distance between the source and the screen, and L is the slit separation. But perhaps for this problem, the actual formula isn't needed because the question is more about the ratio.

Wait, I think I've heard that the sensitivity of the interferometer is such that the minimum detectable phase shift is lambda/(2*pi). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, in terms of path difference, the minimum detectable change is lambda/2 for each fringe. So, perhaps the phase shift is 2π per lambda.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this from the point of view of the required precision in terms of wavelength. The desired accuracy is 1 part in 2 million, which is 1/(2e6). So the allowable error in the measurement is delta = lambda/(2e6). But we need to express this delta as a fraction of the fringe width.

Wait, the fringe width in terms of phase is 2π radians. So, each fringe corresponds to a path difference of lambda/2, because a full wavelength is 2π phase shift. So, the fringe width (w) in path difference terms is lambda/2. So, the allowable error delta is lambda/(2e6). Therefore, the fraction f is delta / w = (lambda/(2e6)) / (lambda/2) ) = (1/(2e6)) * 2 = 1/(1e6) = 1 part in a million, which is 0.0001%, which is 1e-4 percent.

Wait, but wait the question is about the fraction of the fringe width. So, the fringe width is lambda/2 in terms of path difference. So the maximum allowable distortion in the measurement would be delta = lambda/(2e6). So, the fraction f is delta / (lambda/2) ) = (lambda/(2e6)) / (lambda/2) ) = 1/(e6) = 1e-6, which is 0.0001%, but none of the options are that small. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe the fringe width in terms of the sample's physical dimensions. The sample is 5 cm thick, which is 0.05 meters. So, perhaps the OPD is 2t, which is 0.1 meters. But I'm not sure how that ties in.

Alternatively, perhaps the fringe width in the interferogram is proportional to lambda, so the fractional accuracy required is delta/lambda = 1/(2e6), which is 5e-7. But that's in terms of the wavelength. So as a percentage, it's 5e-5 percent, which is 0.000005%, which is even smaller. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the fraction of the fringe period. Let me think differently. The accuracy is 1 in 2e6, which is 5e-7. So, as a fraction of the fringe width, perhaps it's 1/(2e6) * 100% = 0.00005%, but again, that's not matching the options. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the phase shift due to a path difference is delta_phi = (2π / lambda) * OPD. So the OPD here is the thickness of the sample, t, but perhaps considering the refractive index, but since it's not given, maybe we can ignore it, or perhaps it's just t. Wait, no, the OPD would be 2t if the light goes through the sample once each way, so 2t.

But the question is about the allowable distortion in measuring the fringe. So perhaps the maximum allowable error in the OPD measurement is delta_OPD = lambda/(2e6), because the accuracy is 1 part in 2e6.

Wait, but the sample's OPD is 2t, which is 0.1 meters. So delta_OPD = (0.1 m) / (2e6) = 5e-8 meters, which is 0.05 nm. But how does that relate to the fringe width?

Wait, maybe the fringe width in terms of OPD is lambda/2, which is 275 nm for lambda = 550 nm. So, the allowable delta_OPD is 0.05 nm. So the fraction of the fringe width is 0.05 nm / 275 nm = 0.0001818, or about 0.018%, which is 0.018%. But again, none of the options are that small.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The desired accuracy is 1 part in 2 million. So, the measurement error must be less than 1/(2e6) of the quantity being measured. The quantity being measured is the sample's thickness, perhaps, but the problem is about distortions in the fringe measurement.

Wait, another angle: The fringe width (w) in an interferogram is given by w = lambda * D / d, where D is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the separation between the slits. But without knowing D and d, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the fringe width is related to the wavelength and the angle, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The fraction we're seeking is (delta) / (fringe width), where delta is the allowable error in the measurement, which is 1/(2e6) of the measured quantity.

If the measured quantity is the optical path length, then delta = (OPD) / (2e6). The fringe width in OPD terms is lambda/2. So, the fraction is [OPD/(2e6)] / (lambda/2) = (OPD) / (1e6 * lambda).

But the OPD is 2t, so OPD = 2*5 cm = 10 cm = 0.1 m. Lambda is 550 nm = 550e-9 m. Plugging in:

Fraction = (0.1) / (1e6 * 550e-9) ) = 0.1 / (5.5e-4) ) = approximately 0.1818, which is about 18%, but that's not matching any options either. So I must be making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the fringe width in terms of OPD is lambda/2. So the fraction is delta / (lambda/2) = [OPD/(2e6)] / (lambda/2) ) = (OPD) / (lambda * 1e6).

OPD = 2t = 0.1 m, lambda=550e-9 m.

So (0.1) / (550e-9 * 1e6) ) = 0.1 / (550e-3) ) = 0.1 / 0.55 ≈ 0.1818, again 18%, which is not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm really off track here. Maybe I should think in terms of phase.

The phase shift is delta_phi = 2π (OPD)/lambda. The desired accuracy is 1 part in 2e6, so delta_phi_accuracy = 2π/(2e6) )= π/e6.

The phase shift per fringe is 2π, so the fraction per fringe is (π/e6) / (2π) )= 1/(2e6 )= 5e-7, which is 0.00005% as before. But again, that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of fringes. The total number of fringes in the sample would be (OPD) / (lambda/2) )= (2t) / (lambda/2) )= (4t)/lambda.

t is 5 cm = 0.05 m. So 4*0.05 / 550e-9 = 0.2 / 550e-9 = approx 3.636e+8 fringes. But I'm not sure how this helps.

Wait, the accuracy of 1 part in 2 million would mean that the error in the fringe count is 3.636e8 / 2e6 ≈ 182 fringes. So the allowable error is 1/182 of a fringe. Hmm, but how does that translate to the fraction of the fringe width.

Each fringe is width w. So 1/182 of a fringe would be w/182. So the fraction is (w/182)/w )= 1/182 ≈ 0.0055, or 0.55%. But none of the options are 0.55%. The closest is option I:1%, but that's not matching. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction is 1/(2e6) of the fringe width. So 1/(2e6) = 5e-7. As a percentage, that's 0.00005%, but again, no options match.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options. The options given are from 1% to 9.5%. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the fact that the measurement accuracy is 1 part in 2e6, which is 0.5 parts per million. So, 0.5 ppm. So the fractional accuracy is 0.5e-6, which is 5e-7. Now, the fringe width is lambda/2, which is 275 nm. So the error must be less than 5e-7 * 275 nm = 0.1375 nm. But how does that relate to the fringe width.

Wait, 0.1375 nm is the allowable error. The fringe width is 275 nm, so the fraction is 0.1375/275 = 0.0005, which is 0.05%, still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fraction as (delta) / (fringe width). delta is (lambda/2) / (2e6) because the accuracy is 1 part in 2e6 of a fringe. So delta = (lambda/2) / (2e6) = lambda/(4e6). So the fraction is (lambda/(4e6)) / (lambda/2) ) = 1/(2e6) )= 5e-7, which is 0.00005%, but again, no options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of fringes. Let me compute the number of fringes N in the sample. The OPD is 2t = 0.1 m. Each fringe corresponds to a path difference of lambda/2. So N = OPD / (lambda/2) )= 0.1 / (550e-9 / 2 ) )= 0.1 * 2 / 550e-9 )= 0.2 / 550e-9 = approx 3.636e8 fringes.

The accuracy is 1 part in 2e6, which is delta_N = N / (2e6) )= 3.636e8 / 2e6 )= 181.8 fringes. So the allowable error is 181.8 fringes. Wait, but that can't be right because that's a lot of fringes. Maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, I think I'm getting more confused. Let me try to find a formula that relates accuracy in terms of fringe width.

In interferometry, the sensitivity is often given by the minimum detectable phase shift, which is approximately lambda/(2*pi). So the phase shift delta_phi = 2π (delta_OPD)/lambda. Setting delta_phi = lambda/(2*pi), we get delta_OPD = lambda^2/(4 pi). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum detectable OPD is lambda/(2), corresponding to a phase shift of pi. Wait, no, lambda/2 is a quarter wavelength, which is pi/2 phase shift.

Wait, perhaps the minimum detectable OPD is lambda/(2*2e6). Because the accuracy is 1 in 2e6, so lambda/(2e6) would be the OPD error. So the fraction of the fringe width would be [lambda/(2e6)] / (lambda/2) )= 1/(e6) = 0.0001%, which is 1e-4 percent. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the question is more about the fractional accuracy in measuring the distortion. So, the maximum allowable distortion is 1 part in 2e6 of the fringe width.

But I'm not getting any of the options to match. Let me think differently. The problem might be referring to the fact that the maximum allowable error is 1 part in 2e6 of the sample's thickness, but then that's 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5e-6 cm = 25 nm. But I'm not sure how that relates to the fringe width.

Wait, the fringe width in terms of the sample's thickness would be lambda/(2n), where n is the refractive index. If n is 1, then it's 275 nm. But 25 nm is 25/275 = 1/11, which is about 9.1%, which is option C:9.5%. That's close. Wait, 25 nm is 25/275 = 1/11 ≈ 0.0909, which is 9.09%, so approximately 9.1%, which is near option C:9.5%. But why would that be the case?

Wait, if the sample's thickness is 5 cm, and the error allowed is 1 part in 2e6, then the error in OPD is 0.05 m / 2e6 = 2.5e-8 meters = 25 nm. The fringe width is lambda/2 = 550/2 = 275 nm. So the fraction is 25/275 = 1/11 ≈ 0.0909, so 9.09%. That's approximately 9.1%, but the closest option is C:9.5%. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck. 5 cm is 0.05 meters. The error is 0.05/(2e6) = 2.5e-8 meters, which is 25 nm. The fringe width is 275 nm. 25/275 = 1/11 ≈
