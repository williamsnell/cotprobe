Okay, so I've got this problem here where Sam paid $8.28 for 18 stamps. The question is asking how much it would cost him to buy 12 stamps at the same rate. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I think I need to find out the cost per stamp. Since he bought 18 stamps for $8.28, I can calculate the price per stamp by dividing the total cost by the number of stamps. So that's 8.28 divided by 18. Let me do that calculation.

Wait, let me get this straight. 8.28 divided by 18... I'm a bit rusty on division, but maybe I can simplify this. Alternatively, I can think about how much 12 stamps would cost based on the rate. So the rate is price per stamp.

Let me compute 8.28 รท 18 first. Hmm, 18 goes into 8.28 how many times? Well, 18 times 0.4 is 7.2, because 18*0.4 is 7.2. Subtracting that from 8.28 leaves 1.08. Then 18 goes into 1.08 exactly 0.06 times because 18*0.06 is 1.08. So adding those together, 0.4 + 0.06 is 0.46. So each stamp costs $0.46.

Wait, let me double-check that. 18 stamps at $0.46 each: 18 * 0.46. Let's compute that. 10 * 0.46 is 4.6, and 8 * 0.46 is 3.68. Adding them together: 4.6 + 3.68 equals 8.28. Yep, that matches the given total. So the per-stamp cost is correct.

Now, Sam wants to buy 12 stamps. So I need to multiply the per-stamp cost by 12. 0.46 times 12. Let me compute that. 0.46 * 10 is 4.6, and 0.46 * 2 is 0.92. Adding those gives 4.6 + 0.92 = 5.52. So 12 stamps would cost $5.52.

Looking at the options, option C is $5.52. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me try another way. Maybe using proportions.

If 18 stamps cost $8.28, then 12 stamps would cost X. So the ratio is 18:8.28 as 12:X. Setting up the proportion: 18/8.28 = 12/X. Solving for X gives (12 * 8.28)/18. Let's compute that.

12 divided by 18 is 2/3. So 8.28 multiplied by (2/3). 8 * (2/3) is 16/3 which is about 5.333. 0.28 * (2/3) is 0.56/3, which is approximately 0.1867. Adding them together, 5.333 + 0.1867 is about 5.5197, which is approximately $5.52. Yep, that confirms it.

So, the correct answer should be option C: $5.52.

To determine the cost of 12 stamps, first calculate the price per stamp by dividing the total cost by the number of stamps:  
\[
\text{Price per stamp} = \frac{8.28}{18} = 0.46
\]  
Next, multiply the price per stamp by 12 to find the cost for 12 stamps:  
\[
\text{Cost for 12 stamps} = 0.46 \times 12 = 5.52
\]  
Thus, the cost for 12 stamps is **$5.52**, which corresponds to option **C**.
