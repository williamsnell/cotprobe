Okay, so I have this question about the Moon's rotation. Hmm, I remember learning something about the Moon always showing the same face to Earth. Wait, why is that? Oh right, it's because the Moon rotates on its axis in a way that's synchronized with its orbit around Earth. So, the rotation period matches the orbital period. 

The question is asking what evidence this is about the Moon's rotation. The options are various time periods. Let me think. The Moon takes about a month to orbit Earth, right? And since it's tidally locked, it rotates once per month. So the same face is always facing Earth because it's rotating once each month. 

Looking at the options, option J is "month," which would make sense. But wait, I should double-check. Another thought: do we perceive the Moon's rotation as once a day? No, because if it rotated once a day, we'd see different faces as it orbits, but since it's locked, it's the same face. So yes, it's once a month. 

Wait, could it be once a year? No, that doesn't fit. The orbital period is a month, so the rotation period must match that. So the answer should be J: month.

The Moon always shows the same face to Earth because it is tidally locked, meaning its rotation period matches its orbital period around Earth. Since the Moon takes about a month to orbit Earth, it rotates once per month. This synchronization explains why the same face is always visible from our planet.

Answer: J
