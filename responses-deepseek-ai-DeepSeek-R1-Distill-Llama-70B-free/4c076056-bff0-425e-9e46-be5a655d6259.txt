Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking how much sulfur needs to combine with aluminum to form 600 lbs of aluminum sulfide. The options are from A to J, each with different weights of sulfur. Hmm, I think I remember something about chemical reactions and molar masses, but I'm a bit rusty, so let's go through it step by step.

Alright, first, I need to write the chemical equation for the reaction between aluminum and sulfur to form aluminum sulfide. I think aluminum is Al and sulfur is S. Aluminum sulfide would be Al2S3, right? So, the reaction would be something like 2 Al + 3 S → Al2S3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Aluminum typically has a +3 charge, and sulfide is S^2-. So to balance the charges, the formula would be Al2S3. So the balanced equation is 2 Al + 3 S → Al2S3. Yes, that makes sense.

Now, the problem gives me the mass of aluminum sulfide as 600 lbs. I need to find out how much sulfur (S) is required. So, I think I'll have to use stoichiometry here, which relates the amounts of reactants and products based on the balanced equation.

First, I'll need the molar masses of aluminum and sulfur. Aluminum's molar mass is about 27 g/mol. Sulfur is around 32 g/mol. Wait, no, wait. Sulfur's atomic weight is approximately 32.07 g/mol, right? So Al is 27 g/mol and S is 32 g/mol.

The molar mass of Al2S3 would be (2 * 27) + (3 * 32). Let me calculate that. 2*27 is 54, and 3*32 is 96. Adding them together gives 150 g/mol. So each mole of Al2S3 weighs 150 grams.

The problem gives the mass in pounds, so I should probably convert that to grams to make things easier. Wait, but wait, 600 lbs is a big number. Let me think: 1 pound is about 453.592 grams. So 600 lbs is 600 * 453.592 grams. Let me compute that. Hmm, 600 * 450 is 270,000, but since it's 453.592, let's calculate it accurately. 600 * 453.592 = 272,155.2 grams. So approximately 272,155 grams of Al2S3.

Now, to find the number of moles of Al2S3, I divide the mass by the molar mass. So moles = mass / molar mass. That's 272,155 g / 150 g/mol. Let me do that division. 272,155 divided by 150. Let me compute that: 150 goes into 272,155 how many times? 150 * 1800 is 270,000. So 1800 times with 2155 left. 2155 /150 is about 14.3666. So total moles is approximately 1814.3666 moles of Al2S3.

But wait, I can check that calculation again. 150 * 1814 = 272,100. So that's close to 272,155. So about 1814.33 moles.

Now, from the balanced equation, 2 moles of Al react with 3 moles of S to produce 1 mole of Al2S3. So the mole ratio of S to Al2S3 is 3:1. Wait, no, wait. The equation is 2 Al + 3 S → Al2S3. So for each mole of Al2S3, we need 3 moles of S. So moles of S = 3 * moles of Al2S3.

So moles of S = 3 * 1814.33 ≈ 5442.99 moles.

Now, to find the mass of sulfur needed, multiply the moles by the molar mass of S. The molar mass of S is 32 g/mol. So mass = 5442.99 mol * 32 g/mol. Let me compute that. 5443 * 32. Let's compute 5000*32=160,000, 400*32=12,800, 43*32=1,376. So adding those: 160,000 +12,800 =172,800 +1,376=174,176 grams.

Wait, that's 174,176 grams. Now, convert that back to pounds because the answer options are in pounds. Since 1 lb is about 453.592 grams, the mass in pounds is 174176 g /453.592 g/lb. Let me calculate that.

So, 174176 divided by 453.592. Let me approximate. Let's see, 453.592 is about 450 for easier calculation. 450 lbs is 1 lb. So 174,176 /450 = approximately 386.8 lbs. Hmm, but let me do a more accurate calculation.

Using a calculator approach: 453.592 * 384 = let's see, 453.592 * 380 = 453.592 *300=136,077.6; 453.592*80=36,287.36. Adding them: 136,077.6+36,287.36=172,364.96. Then, 453.592 *4=1,814.368. So 172,364.96 +1,814.368=174,179.328. Oh wait, that's very close to our 174,176 grams. So 384 pounds gives about 174,179 grams, which is a bit over our target of 174,176. Hmm, that's very close. So approximately 384 pounds of sulfur.

Looking at the options, option F is 384 lbs. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through the steps again.

1. Chemical formula: Al2S3. Molar mass Al2S3: 2*27 +3*32=54+96=150 g/mol. Correct.

2. Mass of Al2S3: 600 lbs. Convert to grams: 600 *453.592= 272,155.2 grams. Correct.

3. Moles of Al2S3: 272155.2 /150 = 1810.34 moles. Wait, earlier I had 1814.33. Wait, maybe I did that wrong. Let me compute it accurately.

150 g/mol is the molar mass. So 272155.2 /150 = ?

150 * 1810 = 271,500. 272,155.2 - 271,500 = 655.2 grams left. 655.2 /150 = 4.368 moles. So total is 1810 +4.368=1814.368 moles. Yes, correct.

4. Moles of S: 3 * 1814.368=5443.104 moles.

5. Mass of S: 5443.104 *32= 174,179.328 grams.

6. Convert grams to pounds: 174179.328 /453.592 ≈ 383.999 lbs, which is approximately 384 lbs. So option F is correct.

I think that makes sense. So the answer should be F: 384 lbs. sulfur.

To determine how much sulfur is required to form 600 lbs of aluminum sulfide (Al₂S₃), we start by writing the balanced chemical equation:

\[
2 \, \text{Al} + 3 \, \text{S} \rightarrow \text{Al}_2\text{S}_3
\]

From the equation, 2 moles of aluminum react with 3 moles of sulfur to produce 1 mole of aluminum sulfide. This gives a mole ratio of sulfur to aluminum sulfide as \(3:1\).

### Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of Al₂S₃
The molar mass of Al₂S₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Al}_2\text{S}_3 = (2 \times 27) + (3 \times 32) = 54 + 96 = 150 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the mass of Al₂S₃ to moles
The mass of Al₂S₃ is given as 600 lbs. Converting this to grams:
\[
600 \, \text{lbs} \times 453.592 \, \text{g/lb} = 272,155.2 \, \text{g}
\]

The number of moles of Al₂S₃ is:
\[
\text{Moles of Al}_2\text{S}_3 = \frac{\text{Mass of Al}_2\text{S}_3}{\text{Molar mass of Al}_2\text{S}_3} = \frac{272,155.2}{150} \approx 1,814.34 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the moles of sulfur required
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Al₂S₃ requires 3 moles of sulfur. Therefore:
\[
\text{Moles of S} = 3 \times \text{Moles of Al}_2\text{S}_3 = 3 \times 1,814.34 \approx 5,443.02 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Convert moles of sulfur to mass
The molar mass of sulfur is \(32 \, \text{g/mol}\). The mass of sulfur required is:
\[
\text{Mass of S} = \text{Moles of S} \times \text{Molar mass of S} = 5,443.02 \times 32 \approx 174,176.64 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 5: Convert the mass of sulfur to pounds
Converting grams to pounds:
\[
\text{Mass of S (lbs)} = \frac{\text{Mass of S (g)}}{453.592} = \frac{174,176.64}{453.592} \approx 384 \, \text{lbs}
\]

### Final Answer
The weight of sulfur required to form 600 lbs of aluminum sulfide is approximately **384 lbs**.
