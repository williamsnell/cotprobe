Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 6.73 equals z divided by 7.74. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on algebra, but let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the equation is 6.73 = z / 7.74. I need to find the value of z. From what I remember, to solve for z, I should isolate it on one side of the equation. Right now, z is being divided by 7.74, so to get z by itself, I need to do the opposite operation, which is multiplication.

Wait, yeah, the opposite of division is multiplication. So if I multiply both sides of the equation by 7.74, that should do it. Let me write that out:

6.73 * 7.74 equals z. Because when I multiply both sides by 7.74, the right side becomes z (since (z/7.74) *7.74 is just z), and the left side becomes 6.73 *7.74.

So now I just need to calculate 6.73 multiplied by 7.74. Let me get a calculator or do this by hand. Wait, maybe I can approximate it. But I'm not sure, so I'll try doing it step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just multiply 6.73 by 7.74. Let's see:

First, I can think of 7.74 as 7 + 0.74. So 6.73 * 7 is 47.11. Then, 6.73 * 0.74. Hmm, let's compute that.

6.73 * 0.7 is 4.711, and 6.73 * 0.04 is 0.2692. Adding those together: 4.711 + 0.2692 = 4.9802. So the total for 6.73 * 0.74 is 4.9802.

Now add that to the 47.11 from earlier: 47.11 + 4.9802 equals 52.0902. So z equals approximately 52.0902.

Looking at the options, option G is 52.0902. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should do the multiplication more accurately.

Alternatively, another way to multiply 6.73 by 7.74 is to do it as:

7.74
x6.73
--------

Let me compute step by step:

First, multiply 7.74 by 3 (the cents part of 6.73). 7.74 * 3 is 23.22.

Then, multiply 7.74 by 0.7 (since 6.73 is 6 + 0.73). Wait, no, maybe it's better to break it down differently.

Wait, perhaps I should do 6.73 * 7.74 as (6 + 0.73) * (7 + 0.74). But that might complicate things. Maybe the way I did it before was correct.

Alternatively, just compute 6.73 * 7.74 directly:

6.73
x7.74
--------

Multiply 6.73 by 4 hundredths: 6.73 * 0.04 = 0.2692.

Multiply 6.73 by 7 tenths (0.7): 6.73 * 0.7 = 4.711.

Multiply 6.73 by 7 units: 6.73 *7 = 47.11.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 7.74 is 7 + 0.7 + 0.04, so when multiplying, each digit is considered. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, giving 52.0902, which matches option G. So I think that's the correct answer.

To solve the equation \(6.73 = \frac{z}{7.74}\), we isolate \(z\) by multiplying both sides by 7.74:

\[
z = 6.73 \times 7.74
\]

Calculating \(6.73 \times 7.74\):

1. Break down the multiplication:
   - \(6.73 \times 7 = 47.11\)
   - \(6.73 \times 0.74 = 4.9802\)
2. Add the results: \(47.11 + 4.9802 = 52.0902\).

Thus, \(z = 52.0902\), which corresponds to option **G**.
