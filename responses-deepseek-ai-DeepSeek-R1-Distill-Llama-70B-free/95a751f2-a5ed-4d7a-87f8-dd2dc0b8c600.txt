Question:

An internal hash table has 5 buckets, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Keys are integers, and the hash function h(i) = i mod 5 is used, with linear resolution of collisions (i.e., if bucket h(i) is filled, the buckets h(i) + 1, h(i) + 2, ... are tried successively with all bucket numbers computed modulo 5). If elements with keys 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3 are inserted, m that order, into an initially blank hash table, then the content of the bucket numbered 2 is

E: 24
F: 3

Okay, so I've got this hash table problem here. Let's see, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

The question says there's an internal hash table with 5 buckets, numbered 0 to 4. The hash function is h(i) = i mod 5. And collisions are resolved using linear probing, meaning if a bucket is full, we check the next one, and so on, wrapping around if necessary.

The keys to be inserted are 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3, in that order. We need to find out what's in bucket number 2 after all these insertions.

Let me start by calculating the hash for each key. The hash function is mod 5, so:

- 13 mod 5 is 3, because 5*2=10, 13-10=3.
- 8 mod 5 is 3, since 5*1=5, 8-5=3.
Wait, both 13 and 8 hash to bucket 3? Oh, that's going to cause a collision.

Then comes 24. 24 mod 5 is 4, since 5*4=20, 24-20=4. So bucket 4.

Next is 10 mod 5 is 0. So bucket 0.

Finally, 3 mod 5 is 3. So bucket 3 again.

So the order of insertion is:

1. 13 → bucket 3
2. 8 → bucket 3 (collision)
3. 24 → bucket 4
4. 10 → bucket 0
5. 3 → bucket 3 (another collision)

Now, since collisions are resolved by linear probing, each time a bucket is full, the next bucket is tried, and so on, wrapping around if necessary.

Let me map this out step by step.

Initially, all buckets are empty.

First, insert 13. It goes to bucket 3. So bucket 3 now has 13.

Second, insert 8. The hash is 3 again. But bucket 3 is already occupied. So we move to the next bucket: (3+1) mod 5 =4. Is bucket 4 empty? Yes. So 8 goes into bucket 4.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the hash function is i mod 5, so for 8, h(8)=3. But bucket 3 is full. So according to linear probing, the next bucket is 4. So 8 goes to bucket 4.

Third, insert 24. h(24)=4. So check bucket 4. It's now occupied by 8. So we move to bucket 5, which is 0 (mod 5). So bucket 0 is empty, so 24 goes there.

Wait, no. Wait, 24's hash is 4. If bucket 4 is full (it's got 8), then we try 4+1=5 mod5=0. Is bucket 0 empty? Yes. So 24 goes into bucket 0.

Fourth, insert 10. h(10)=0. Bucket 0 is now occupied by 24. So we check bucket 1. Bucket 1 is empty, so 10 goes there.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. When inserting 10, hash is 0. Bucket 0 is occupied (by 24), so we try bucket 0+1=1. Bucket 1 is empty, so yes, 10 goes to bucket 1.

Wait, but wait another moment. Wait, the order was 13,8,24,10,3.

Wait, let me track each insertion:

1. Insert 13: goes to 3.

Bucket 3: [13]

Others empty.

2. Insert 8: hash 3, which is full. So move to 4. Bucket 4 is empty, so 8 goes there.

Bucket 4: [8]

3. Insert 24: hash is 4. Bucket 4 is full (has 8), so we go to 4+1=5 mod5=0. Bucket 0 is empty, so 24 goes to 0.

Bucket 0: [24]

4. Insert 10: hash is 0. Bucket 0 is full. So check 0+1=1. Bucket 1 is empty, so 10 goes to 1.

Bucket 1: [10]

5. Insert 3: hash is 3. Bucket 3 has 13. So check 3+1=4. Bucket 4 has 8. So check 4+1=5 mod5=0. Bucket 0 has 24. Next, 0+1=1. Bucket 1 has 10. Then 1+1=2. Bucket 2 is empty. So 3 goes into bucket 2.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I followed that correctly.

So when inserting 3, hash is 3. Check bucket 3: full (13). So try bucket 4: full (8). Then bucket 5 mod5 is 0: full (24). Then bucket 1: full (10). Then bucket 2: empty. So 3 goes into 2.

So after all insertions, the buckets are as follows:

0: 24

1:10

2:3

3:13

4:8

Wait, but what about bucket 2? So the question is, what is the content of bucket 2. According to this, it's 3. So looking at the options, let's see.

Looking back at the options:

Options:

A:10

B:8

C:10 and24

D:Empty

E:24

F:3

G:10 and3

H:3 and8

I:13

J:13 and8

So the content of bucket 2 is 3, which is option F.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I haven't made a mistake in the insertion order.

Wait, the order is 13,8,24,10,3.

Wait, so after inserting 3, it goes to bucket 2.

But let me check each step again.

Insert 13: bucket3.

Insert8: bucket3 is full, so bucket4.

Insert24: bucket4 is full, so try bucket0.

Insert10: bucket0 is full, so try bucket1.

Insert3: bucket3 is full. So try 4 (full), 0 (full), 1 (full), then 2 (empty). So 3 goes to bucket2.

So yes, bucket2 has 3.

So the correct answer would be F:3.

Wait, but wait what about the other options. Let me make sure.

Wait, the question is about the content of bucket2. So bucket2 has only 3, so option F is correct.

The hash table has 5 buckets (0-4), and the hash function is \( h(i) = i \mod 5 \). Collisions are resolved using linear probing. The keys are inserted in the order: 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3. Let us track the insertion process:

1. **Key 13**:  
   \( h(13) = 13 \mod 5 = 3 \). Bucket 3 is empty, so 13 is placed in bucket 3.  
   **Bucket 3:** [13]

2. **Key 8**:  
   \( h(8) = 8 \mod 5 = 3 \). Bucket 3 is full, so linear probing begins. The next bucket is \( (3+1) \mod 5 = 4 \), which is empty.  
   **Bucket 4:** [8]

3. **Key 24**:  
   \( h(24) = 24 \mod 5 = 4 \). Bucket 4 is full, so linear probing begins. The next bucket is \( (4+1) \mod 5 = 0 \), which is empty.  
   **Bucket 0:** [24]

4. **Key 10**:  
   \( h(10) = 10 \mod 5 = 0 \). Bucket 0 is full, so linear probing begins. The next bucket is \( (0+1) \mod 5 = 1 \), which is empty.  
   **Bucket 1:** [10]

5. **Key 3**:  
   \( h(3) = 3 \mod 5 = 3 \). Bucket 3 is full, so linear probing begins. The next buckets are checked in order:  
   - Bucket 4: Full (8)  
   - Bucket 0: Full (24)  
   - Bucket 1: Full (10)  
   - Bucket 2: Empty.  
   Thus, 3 is placed in bucket 2.  
   **Bucket 2:** [3]

After all insertions, the content of bucket 2 is **3**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: 3**
