Okay, so I've got this problem here about a binary component system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says we have a system with 3 grams of component A and 7 grams of component B. So the total mass is 3 + 7 = 10 grams. Then, the system is brought to a temperature where two phases are present. One phase has 5% A by weight, and the other has 50% A. I need to find the masses of these two phases.

Wait, I remember something about lever rules or maybe using the composition to find the mass fractions. Oh right, in phase diagrams, sometimes you can use the concept of mass balance. Let me think about that.

So, the two phases are in equilibrium. Let's call them phase alpha and phase beta. Phase alpha has 5% A, so it's mostly component B. Phase beta has 50% A, so equal parts maybe? Or wait, 50% of each component by weight.

The overall composition of the system is 3g A and 7g B. So the weight percent of A in the entire system is (3/10)*100 = 30%. So overall, 30% A, 70% B.

Now, when the system separates into two phases, each phase has a different composition. I think the masses of these phases can be found using the lever rule or the method of averages.

Wait, the lever rule... I think it's a way to find the relative amounts of each phase based on the composition. So, the idea is that the overall composition lies between the two phases' compositions on the phase diagram.

So, let me set up some variables. Let's say the mass of phase alpha (5% A) is m_alpha, and the mass of phase beta (50% A) is m_beta. So m_alpha + m_beta = 10 grams.

Also, the amount of component A in each phase must add up to the total A, which is 3 grams. So for phase alpha, the mass of A is 5% of m_alpha, which is 0.05 * m_alpha. For phase beta, it's 50% of m_beta, which is 0.5 * m_beta.

So the equation would be: 0.05 * m_alpha + 0.5 * m_beta = 3 grams.

And we have another equation from the total mass: m_alpha + m_beta = 10 grams.

So now I can solve this system of two equations with two variables.

Let me substitute m_beta from the second equation into the first. Since m_beta = 10 - m_alpha.

Substituting into the first equation:

0.05 m_alpha + 0.5 (10 - m_alpha) = 3.

Let me expand that: 0.05 m_alpha + 5 - 0.5 m_alpha = 3.

Combine like terms: (0.05 - 0.5) m_alpha +5 =3 → (-0.45 m_alpha) +5 =3.

Subtract 5 from both sides: -0.45 m_alpha = -2.

Divide both sides by -0.45: m_alpha = (-2)/(-0.45) = 4.444... grams.

So m_alpha is approximately 4.444 grams. Then m_beta is 10 - 4.444 = 5.556 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option H is m_alpha=4.444g and m_beta=5.556g. So that's option H. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up alpha and beta.

Wait, phase alpha is the one with 5% A. So in my calculation, m_alpha is 4.444g. Let me see if that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the lever rule using the weight percentages. The overall composition is 30% A, which is between 5% (alpha) and 50% (beta). So the proportion of the phases would be determined by the distances.

The lever rule formula is something like (mass of beta) / (mass of alpha) = (C0 - Calpha) / (Cbeta - C0), where C0 is the overall composition.

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact lever rule. Let me think: in a binary system, the ratio of the masses of the two phases is inversely proportional to the distance from each phase's composition.

So the formula is (mass of phase with higher concentration) / (mass of phase with lower concentration) = (C0 - lower) / (higher - C0).

In this case, C0 is 30% A. The lower concentration phase is alpha at 5%, higher is beta at 50%. So the ratio would be (30 -5)/(50-30)=25/20=5/4.

So the mass of beta (higher concentration) divided by mass of alpha equals 5/4.

So, m_beta/m_alpha = 5/4 → m_beta = (5/4) m_alpha.

And since m_alpha + m_beta =10 → m_alpha + (5/4 m_alpha) =10 → (9/4 m_alpha)=10 → m_alpha= (10 *4)/9=40/9≈4.444g. Which matches my previous result. So m_beta is 5.556g.

So the correct masses are m_alpha≈4.444g and m_beta≈5.556g. That's option H.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let me check:

Option H: m_alpha = 4.444g, m_beta =5.556g. Yes, that's correct.

But wait, wait, I think I might have mixed up the phases. Because in lever rule, the phase with the composition closer to C0 will have a larger mass. Here, 30% is closer to 5% or 50%? 30% is closer to 50% than to 5%. So the phase that is richer in A (beta) would have a smaller mass. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, lever rule states that the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the distance from the overall composition.

In this case, the distance from alpha (5%) to C0 (30%) is 25%, and distance from beta (50%) to C0 is 20%. So the ratio m_beta/m_alpha =25/20=5/4.

So m_beta is (5/4) m_alpha. So m_beta is larger than m_alpha. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because the phase with composition closer to C0 should have a larger mass. Since 30% is closer to 50% (distance of 20%) than to 5% (distance 25%), so beta is closer. Hence, the mass of beta should be smaller than alpha? Or wait, maybe I have it backwards.

Wait, let me think. Lever rule is sometimes remembered as "the length of the lever balances the masses". So the phase that is farther from the overall composition has a smaller mass.

Wait, when C0 is between Calpha and Cbeta, the mass ratio is (Cbeta - C0)/(C0 - Calpha) = mass_alpha / mass_beta.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio inverted earlier. Let me get the formula right.

The lever rule formula for mass fractions is:

mass of alpha / mass of beta = (Cbeta - C0) / (C0 - Calpha).

So in this case, Calpha =5%, Cbeta=50%, C0=30%.

So (50-30)/(30-5) =20/25=4/5.

So mass_alpha/mass_beta=4/5 → mass_alpha = (4/5) mass_beta.

And since mass_alpha + mass_beta=10,

(4/5 m_beta) + m_beta =10 → (9/5 m_beta) =10 → m_beta=50/9≈5.5556g, m_alpha=10 -5.5556≈4.444g.

So that's the same result as before. So option H is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the phase with the lower concentration (alpha, 5%) would have a higher mass because the system is richer in B. Let me check: the overall system is 30% A. So the majority is B. So the phase with higher B (alpha) would have a larger mass. But according to my calculation, m_alpha is 4.444g, m_beta is 5.555g. Wait, but 4.444 is less than 5.555, so that would imply that the beta phase (50% A) has a larger mass. Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive since the system is only 30% A overall.

Wait, no, wait: the system is 30% A and 70% B. So the majority is B. So the phase that's richer in B (alpha) should have a larger mass. So m_alpha should be larger than m_beta. But according to the numbers, m_alpha is 4.444 and m_beta is 5.555, so m_beta is bigger. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the lever rule formula. Let me rethink this.

The lever rule can also be thought of as the ratio of the lengths on the phase diagram. The composition of the system (C0) is between Calpha and Cbeta.

Imagine a number line with Calpha (5%) on the left and Cbeta (50%) on the right. The point C0 (30%) is somewhere in between.

The distance from Calpha to C0 is 25%, and from C0 to Cbeta is 20%.

The lever rule says that the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to these distances. So the mass of the phase on the left (alpha) times the distance to C0 should equal the mass of the phase on the right (beta) times its distance to C0.

Wait, maybe the formula is (mass_alpha) * (C0 - Calpha) = (mass_beta) * (Cbeta - C0).

Which would be mass_alpha * 25 = mass_beta *20 → mass_alpha/mass_beta=20/25=4/5. So same as before.

So mass_alpha=4/5 mass_beta.

Thus, when you solve, mass_alpha comes out to be (4/5)(5.555)≈4.444g. But this makes m_beta larger than m_alpha, which seems to conflict with the idea that the B-rich phase (alpha) should have a larger mass since the system is B-rich.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The system is 30% A, which is more A-rich than alpha (5% A) but less than beta (50% A). So the system is closer to beta (since 30 is 25 units from 5% and 20 units from 50%).

Wait, no, 30-5=25, 50-30=20 → so system is 25 units away from alpha and 20 units away from beta. So beta is closer to the system composition. So the beta phase is the one with higher concentration of A.

In such a case, when the system is closer to the higher concentration phase (beta), the mass of beta would be less than the mass of alpha. Because the lever is shorter on the beta side, so less mass is needed to balance.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because imagine a see-saw: if you're closer to one end, you need less weight to balance.

So, if C0 is closer to beta, then beta has a smaller mass. So m_beta is smaller than m_alpha.

Wait, but according to the calculation, m_beta is 5.555g and m_alpha is 4.444g. So m_beta is larger. That contradicts. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me try the lever rule again. The lever rule states that the mass of the phase on the left (alpha) times the distance to C0 equals the mass of the phase on the right (beta) times their distance.

So, mass_alpha * (C0 - Calpha) = mass_beta * (Cbeta - C0).

Putting in the numbers: mass_alpha*(30-5)=mass_beta*(50-30).

→ mass_alpha *25 = mass_beta *20 → mass_alpha = (20/25) mass_beta = 0.8 mass_beta.

So mass_alpha = 0.8 mass_beta.

And mass_alpha + mass_beta =10.

Substituting, 0.8 mass_beta + mass_beta =10 → 1.8 mass_beta =10 → mass_beta=10/1.8=5.555g.

So mass_alpha=10 -5.555=4.444g.

So according to this, m_alpha is 4.444g (5% A phase) and m_beta is 5.555g (50% A phase). So beta phase is larger in mass, but that seems odd because the system is more B-rich. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the system is 30% A, so it's more A-rich than the alpha phase but less than beta. So the majority of the system is B, so the majority phase should be the one with less A, which is alpha.

But according to the calculation, the mass of alpha is 4.444g, which is less than beta's 5.555g. So that would mean beta is the larger phase, but beta is the A-rich phase, which isn't the majority. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the lever rule gives the opposite. Let me think about another approach.

Alternative approach: let me think about mass balance.

Total A: 3g.

Let me assume that the system splits into m_alpha grams of alpha phase (5% A) and m_beta grams of beta phase (50% A).

So total A is 0.05 m_alpha +0.5 m_beta=3.

And m_alpha +m_beta=10.

We can solve these two equations.

From the second equation, m_beta=10 - m_alpha.

Substitute into the first equation: 0.05 m_alpha +0.5*(10 - m_alpha)=3.

Expand: 0.05 m_alpha +5 -0.5 m_alpha=3.

Combine terms: (-0.45 m_alpha) +5=3 → -0.45 m_alpha= -2 → m_alpha= (-2)/(-0.45)=4.444g.

So m_alpha=4.444g, m_beta=5.556g.

So same result as before.

Wait, but why is the beta phase, which is richer in A, having a larger mass? The system has only 30% A. So it's more B-rich, so the phase that's B-rich (alpha) should be larger. But according to this, alpha is 4.444g, beta is 5.556g, which is larger.

Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I've made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the mass of A in each phase.

m_alpha =4.444g, so A in alpha is 0.05 *4.444≈0.222g.

m_beta=5.556g, so A in beta is 0.5 *5.556≈2.778g.

Total A: 0.222 +2.778≈3g. Correct.

But the system is 30% A, which is 3g in 10g. So the beta phase is 50% A, which is higher than 30%, and the alpha phase is 5% A, lower than 30%. So the system is a mixture of these two.

But why is the beta phase having a larger mass? Because the lever rule says that when the system is closer to one phase, that phase has a smaller mass. Wait, because the lever is shorter on that side, so less mass is needed to balance.

So when the overall composition is closer to beta (since 30% is closer to 50% than to 5%), the mass of beta would be smaller. But according to the calculation, beta's mass is larger. So maybe I have the lever rule inverted.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the masses being inversely proportional to the distances. So the phase farther from C0 has a larger mass.

So distance from alpha to C0 is 25%, distance from beta to C0 is 20%.

So the ratio of masses (alpha/beta) is (distance to beta)/(distance to alpha) → (20)/(25)=4/5.

So mass_alpha/mass_beta=4/5 → mass_alpha= (4/5) mass_beta.

Which gives, when mass_alpha + mass_beta=10,

(4/5 m_beta) + m_beta=10 → (9/5 m_beta)=10 → m_beta=50/9≈5.556g.

So same result. So the beta phase has a larger mass. But according to the lever rule, if the system is closer to beta, beta should have a smaller mass.

Wait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose the system is exactly at the composition of one phase, say alpha. Then all the mass would be alpha, and none beta. Similarly, if the system is at beta's composition, all mass is beta.

So when the system is closer to beta, the mass of beta is less, and alpha is more. Because you need less of the phase you're closer to.

Wait, but in our calculation, when C0 is closer to beta (because 30 is closer to 50 than to 5), the mass of beta is larger. That contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I should draw a phase diagram. Imagine a temperature-composition diagram where at a certain temperature, two phases coexist: alpha (5% A) and beta (50% A). The system is at 30% A.

So on the diagram, the composition line is horizontal. The lever rule says that the ratio of the lengths (in composition) determines the inverse ratio of the masses.

So the length from alpha to C0 is 25%, from C0 to beta is 20%.

So the masses should be in the inverse ratio: mass_alpha : mass_beta = 20 :25 → 4:5.

So mass_alpha is (4/9)*10=40/9≈4.444g, mass_beta is (5/9)*10≈5.555g.

So that's correct. Hence, the beta phase has a larger mass.

But wait, why is that? Since the system is closer to beta, beta has a larger mass. That seems opposite to what I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe I confused the lever rule. Let me think again: the lever rule says that the mass of a phase is inversely proportional to the distance from the overall composition.

So the phase that is farther away has a larger mass. Because imagine a lever: the further you are from the fulcrum, the more weight you need to balance.

So in this case, alpha
