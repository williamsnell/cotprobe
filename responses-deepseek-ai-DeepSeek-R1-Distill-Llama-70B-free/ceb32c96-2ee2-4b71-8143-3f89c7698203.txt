Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the vapor pressure of formic acid. Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure is related to the Gibbs free energy of formation for the gas and liquid phases. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives me the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for formic acid in both gaseous and liquid states at 298.15 K. The values are ΔGf°(HCOOH, g) = -351.0 kJ/mol and ΔGf°(HCOOH, l) = -361.4 kJ/mol. Wait, so the liquid has a more negative ΔGf°, which makes sense because it's more stable than the gas.

I think the formula to use here is the one that relates the Gibbs free energy change to the vapor pressure. Oh right, the formula is ΔG = RT ln(P), where P is the vapor pressure. But wait, I should check the exact relation. Oh wait, no, the correct formula is ΔG° = RT ln(P/P°), but since P° is standard pressure (1 bar, which is 1e5 Pa), maybe I need to adjust for that.

Wait another thing, the Gibbs free energy change for the vaporization process would be the difference between the gas and the liquid. So ΔG_vaporization = ΔGf°(gas) - ΔGf°(liquid). Let me compute that first.

ΔG_vaporization = (-351.0) - (-361.4) = 10.4 kJ/mol. Oh wait, but wait—that's the standard Gibbs energy change for the process HCOOH(l) → HCOOH(g) at standard conditions.

But I'm a bit confused about the sign. Because the process is going from liquid (lower energy) to gas (higher energy), so the ΔG should be positive, which it is (10.4 kJ/mol). That makes sense.

Now, the relation between ΔG° and the equilibrium vapor pressure. The formula is ΔG° = RT ln(P), where P is the vapor pressure. Wait, but wait—no, I think the equation is ΔG° = RT ln(P/P°), but P° is 1 bar. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as ΔG° = RT ln(P), where P is in terms of activity, but for gases, activity is P/P°, so maybe it's better to write it as ln(P/P°).

Wait, let's get that right. The standard Gibbs free energy change for the process is equal to -RT ln K, where K is the equilibrium constant. But in this case, the equilibrium constant for vaporization is P/P°, where P is the vapor pressure. So, ΔG° = -RT ln K. So K is P/P°, so:

ΔG° = -RT ln(P/P°)

But wait, in this case, ΔG° is 10.4 kJ/mol, which is 10,400 J/mol.

Wait, let's plug the numbers in. R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T is 298.15 K.

So,

10,400 J/mol = - (8.314 J/mol·K) * (298.15 K) * ln(P / 1e5 Pa)

Wait, wait, no. Because ΔG° is positive here, and the formula is ΔG° = -RT ln K. So K would be P/P°, and since vaporization is not favored (because the ΔG is positive), K should be less than 1, meaning P is less than P°.

So rearranging the equation:

ln(P/P°) = -ΔG°/(RT)

Wait, let's double-check. Because ΔG° is positive, the ln term would be negative, so P/P° is less than 1.

So,

ln(P/P°) = - (ΔG°) / (RT)

Wait, let me substitute the numbers.

ΔG° is 10,400 J/mol.

So,

ln(P / 1e5) = -(10,400) / (8.314 * 298.15)

Let me compute the denominator first: 8.314 * 298.15 ≈ 8.314 * 300 ≈ 2494.2, but more accurately, 8.314 * 298.15 = ?

Let me compute 8.314 * 298 = 2477.572, and 8.314 * 0.15 = 1.2471, so total is 2477.572 + 1.2471 ≈ 2478.819 J/mol.

So,

ln(P / 1e5) = -(10400) / 2478.819 ≈ -4.20

So,

P / 1e5 = e^(-4.20) = ?

e^4 is about 54.598, so e^4.2 is about 54.598 * e^0.2.

e^0.2 is approx 1.2214, so 54.598 * 1.2214 ≈ 66.686.

Thus, e^-4.2 is 1/66.686 ≈ 0.01499.

So,

P = 1e5 Pa * 0.01499 ≈ 1499 Pa.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.51e3 Pa, which is 1510 Pa. Close enough, considering rounding.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, e^(-4.2) is approximately 0.015, which gives P ≈ 1.5e3 Pa, so option A is 1.51e3, which matches.

But wait, let me confirm the sign. Because if the process is HCOOH(l) → HCOOH(g), the ΔG° is positive, which means the reaction is non-spontaneous, so vapor pressure should be low, which matches with 1.5e3 Pa being lower than 1e5 Pa.

Another way to think: If the ΔG° is positive, the natural log term is negative, so P is less than P°, which is the case here.

So I think option A is correct.

To calculate the vapor pressure of formic acid at 298.15 K, we use the relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) and the equilibrium vapor pressure (P). The formula is:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln\left(\frac{P}{P^\circ}\right)
\]

Here:
- ΔG° = 10.4 kJ/mol (calculated as the difference between the Gibbs free energy of formation of gaseous and liquid formic acid: ΔG° = ΔGf°(gas) - ΔGf°(liquid) = -351.0 - (-361.4) = 10.4 kJ/mol),
- \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol·K} \),
- \( T = 298.15 \, \mathrm{K} \),
- \( P^\circ = 1 \, \mathrm{bar} = 10^5 \, \mathrm{Pa} \).

Rearranging the equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P}{P^\circ}\right) = -\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{RT}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P}{10^5}\right) = -\frac{10,400}{8.314 \times 298.15}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
8.314 \times 298.15 \approx 2478.82 \, \mathrm{J/mol}
\]

Now:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P}{10^5}\right) = -\frac{10,400}{2478.82} \approx -4.20
\]

Exponentiating both sides:

\[
\frac{P}{10^5} = e^{-4.20}
\]

Using \( e^{-4.20} \approx 0.015 \):

\[
P = 10^5 \times 0.015 = 1500 \, \mathrm{Pa}
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is **1.51 × 10³ Pa**, which corresponds to option A.
