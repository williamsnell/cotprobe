Okay, so I've got this problem about a generator's EMF, and I need to figure out the answers for two scenarios. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the initial conditions are that the generator is driven at 1200 rpm and produces an EMF of 125 volts. So the question has two parts: part (a) is when the field flux is decreased by 10% while keeping the speed the same, and part (b) is when the speed is reduced to 1100 rpm with the flux unchanged.

Hmm, I remember that the EMF generated in a generator depends on the flux, the speed, and the number of turns in the coil, among other factors. Oh right, the formula for induced EMF is E = (P * Φ * N * S) / (60 * A), where P is the number of poles, Φ is the flux per pole, N is the speed in rpm, S is the number of phases (assuming it's AC), and A is the number of parallel paths. Or wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the basic formula E = Φ * ω * N, but I'm mixing things up. Wait, maybe the correct formula is E = (k * Φ * N * S) where k is some constant that includes the speed. Oh wait, the key thing is that EMF is directly proportional to flux (Φ), speed (N), and the number of conductors, but since the problem doesn't mention any changes in the number of conductors or poles, I can maybe consider those as constants.

Wait, let's get this right. The EMF equation for a generator is generally E = (PΦNZ)/(60A), where P is the number of poles, Φ is the flux per pole, N is the speed in rpm, Z is the number of armature conductors, and A is the number of parallel paths. But in this problem, when they change either flux or speed, the other factors (Z, A, P) remain the same, right? So for each part, when one variable changes, the EMF changes proportionally.

So for part (a), the flux is decreased by 10%, while speed remains the same. Since E is proportional to Φ when N is constant, the new EMF would be 90% of the original. So original E is 125 V. 10% decrease in Φ is 0.9Φ. So new E would be 125 * 0.9 = 112.5 V. So part (a) would be 112.5 volts.

Now part (b), speed is reduced to 1100 rpm from 1200, so that's a change in N. The flux remains the same, so EMF is proportional to N. So the new speed is (1100/1200) times the original speed. Let me calculate 1100 divided by 1200. 1100/1200 = 11/12 ≈ 0.9167. So the new EMF is 125 * (11/12) = ?

Let me compute that. 125 * 11 is 1375, divided by 12. 12 * 114 is 1368, so 1375 - 1368 =7. So 114 and 7/12 volts, which is approximately 114.5833 volts. Rounding off, maybe around 114.6 or 114.58 volts.

Wait, but let me check the options to see which one matches. Let's look at the options given:

Option I: (a) 112.5 V, (b) 114.6 V.

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So option I would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check in case I made a mistake. So for part (a), 10% decrease in flux, so 0.9 times 125 is 112.5, correct. For part (b), 1100 is 11/12 of 1200, so 125 * (11/12) = (125 * 11)/12 = 1375 /12. Let me compute 1375 ÷ 12. 12 × 114 = 1368, so 1375 - 1368 =7. So 114 and 7/12, which is approximately 114.5833 volts, or 114.6 when rounded to one decimal place.

So yes, option I is (a) 112.5, (b) 114.6, which matches my calculations.

To solve the problem, we analyze how the generated EMF changes under the two scenarios:

### Part (a): Field flux decreased by 10%, speed unchanged
The EMF is directly proportional to the flux (Φ). If the flux decreases by 10%, the new flux is 90% of the original flux. Since the speed (N) remains constant, the new EMF is:

\[
E_{\text{new}} = 0.9 \times 125 = 112.5 \, \text{volts}.
\]

### Part (b): Speed reduced to 1100 rpm, flux unchanged
The EMF is directly proportional to the speed (N). The new speed is:

\[
\frac{1100}{1200} = \frac{11}{12} \approx 0.9167.
\]

Since the flux (Φ) remains constant, the new EMF is:

\[
E_{\text{new}} = 125 \times \frac{11}{12} = \frac{1375}{12} \approx 114.58 \, \text{volts}.
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- Part (a): \( 112.5 \, \text{volts} \)
- Part (b): \( 114.6 \, \text{volts} \)

The correct option is **I**.
