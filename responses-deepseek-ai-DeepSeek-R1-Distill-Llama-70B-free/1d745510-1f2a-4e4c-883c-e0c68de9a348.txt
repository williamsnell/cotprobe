Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem describes a horizontal strip of N+2 squares. The first and last squares are black, and the N squares in between are white. Then, there's this process where I repeatedly choose a white square at random, pick one of its neighbors (left or right) with equal probability, and color that neighbor black if it's not already black. This continues until all the remaining white squares have only black neighbors. The question is about finding the limit of w(N)/N as N approaches infinity, where w(N) is the expected number of white squares remaining.

Hmm. So, the process starts with all middle squares white, and the two ends black. Each step involves selecting a random white square, then randomly picking one of its neighbors (left or right) and coloring it black if it's white. This repeats until no white squares can be changed anymore. Wait, but isn't the stopping condition when all white squares are adjacent only to black squares? So the process stops when every white square is between two black squares, meaning each white square has black neighbors on both sides.

Wait, no, I think the stopping condition is when all white squares have only black neighbors. So, if a white square exists, both of its neighbors must be black. So the process stops when the only white squares are those that are isolated, each surrounded by black on both sides. Wait, but that might not happen unless they're all single and can't be colored anymore.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

So, each step, I pick a white square uniformly at random. Then I choose one neighbor (left or right) with 50% chance each. If that neighbor is white, I color it black. I repeat this until no more white squares can be colored, I guess, but the stopping condition is when all remaining white squares have all their neighbors black. So, in other words, the white squares that are left are such that both their left and right neighbors are black. So those squares can't be turned black anymore because their only neighbors are already black. So, the process stops when each white square is isolated between two blacks.

Wait, but in the initial setup, the two ends are black, and the rest are white. So, for example, if N is 2, the strip is B W W B. So, all steps would start by choosing one of the two white squares. Let's say I pick the first W. Then I choose left (which is B, so nothing happens) or right (the next W). If I pick right, I color it black. So the strip becomes B W B B. Now, the only white square is the second one. But in this case, its left is B and right is B. So it can't be colored anymore, so the process stops. So w(2) is 1. But wait, when N=2, the initial setup is B W W B. After the first step, you color one of them, so you end up with one white square, so w(2) is 1. So for N=2, w(2)/2 = 0.5.

But as N grows, the behavior might change. The problem is about the limit as N approaches infinity of w(N)/N.

I think this problem is related to some kind of stochastic process or perhaps percolation. Maybe it's similar to the concept of the "largest empty interval" or something in probability. Alternatively, it might involve some kind of Poisson process approximation for large N.

Wait, another approach: let's model each white square as a site that can potentially become black, depending on the steps taken. Since each step randomly picks a white square and then randomly picks a neighbor to color, perhaps this resembles a kind of infection spreading. But here, the "infection" (coloring black) occurs only when a neighbor is selected and is white.

Wait, but the process is a bit different. Each time, you pick a white square, then pick a neighbor, and if that neighbor is white, you color it black. So each white square can potentially infect its left or right neighbor. But once a square is black, it can't be changed again.

Wait, but the process continues until no more white squares can be colored. So, the process stops when all remaining white squares are such that both their neighbors are black, meaning they can't be colored anymore. So, the remaining white squares are each isolated between two black squares.

Wait, but in that case, the remaining white squares must form single-site isolated regions. Because if there were two adjacent white squares left, then each of their neighbors would be white on one side and black on the other, but in that case, perhaps the process could still act on them. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think about the stopping condition again. The process stops when all remaining white squares have only black neighbors. So, any white square must have both neighbors black. So, for example, if two white squares are adjacent, neither can be the one that's selected because when you select a white square, you're trying to color a neighbor. So for two adjacent white squares, their mutual neighbor is white, so if you select one, you might color the other. Wait, no.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose after some steps, the strip looks like B W W B. So, the two middle squares are white. Now, if I pick the left W, I can choose left (which is B, nothing happens) or right (the other W). If I choose right, I color it black. So the strip becomes B W B B. Then, the remaining W is between B and B, so the process stops. Alternatively, if I picked the right W first, I might color the left W, leading to B B W B, then the process stops.

So in the case of two adjacent Ws, the process can continue until one of them is colored black, leading to the other being isolated.

So, in general, the process will stop when all the white squares are isolated between two black squares. So, the remaining white squares are all single, each surrounded by black on both sides.

So the problem is about finding the expected number of such isolated white squares in the limit as N becomes large.

I think this relates to the concept of records or maybe occupancy problems. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the idea of the number of gaps or spacings between black squares when the process stops.

Wait, but how does the process proceed? Each step, a white square is chosen uniformly at random. Then, one of its two neighbors is chosen at random. If that neighbor is white, it's colored black.

Wait, so each white square can cause one of its neighbors to be colored black. But the selection is random, so perhaps it's similar to a birth-death process, but in reverse.

Alternatively, considering the process as a way of inserting black squares into the white region. Each time a white square is selected, it has a chance to turn a neighbor black, but the chance depends on which neighbor is chosen.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a Markov chain where each state represents the configuration of the squares. But for large N, that's intractable. So perhaps we can find a differential equation approach or some kind of linearity of expectation to compute the expected number.

Alternatively, perhaps for each white square, we can compute the probability that it remains white in the end. Then, since expectation is linear, the expected number w(N) would be the sum over all N squares of the probability that each is white at the end. So, w(N) = sum_{i=1}^N p_i, where p_i is the probability that square i remains white.

If that's the case, then in the limit as N approaches infinity, the ratio w(N)/N would be the probability that a given square remains white, multiplied by N, but wait, no—wait, each square is identical in the sense of translation invariance. So all p_i are the same, so p_i = p for all i. Then, w(N) = N * p, so w(N)/N = p.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding p, the probability that a particular square (say, the i-th) remains white in the end.

So, what's p?

Now, for a square to remain white, it must not be colored black throughout the entire process. But wait, no—because the square itself starts as white, and it's possible that during the process, one of its neighbors gets colored black, which could affect whether this square remains.

Wait, no. Let me correct that: the square starts as white. If either of its neighbors gets colored black, then this square is no longer adjacent to another white square on that side. But for the square to remain white at the end, it must have both its left and right neighbors black. So, the square can't be colored black unless one of its neighbors is chosen and then this square is selected as the neighbor to color.

Wait, no. Wait, the process is that you select a white square, then choose a neighbor (left or right) at random, and color that neighbor black if it's white. So the only way a square gets colored black is if one of its neighbors is selected, and then this square is the chosen neighbor.

So, for square i to be colored black, either square i-1 or square i+1 must be selected, and then the direction towards i must be chosen.

So, the probability that square i is colored black is the probability that, in the entire process, either square i-1 or i+1 is selected, and then the respective neighbor (i) is chosen to be colored.

But wait, this seems complicated because the process is dynamic; the set of white squares changes over time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a kind of Poisson process where each white square can "influence" its neighbors to become black, but the exact timing is random.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the process resembles the "annihilating" or "coalescing" process, where each white square can cause its neighbors to become black, and once a neighbor is black, it can no longer influence others.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be thought of as starting with N white squares, and each white square has a certain rate of "firing" to the left or right, turning the neighbor black. Then, the expected number of white squares that remain is determined by how these firings occur.

Wait, let's model each white square as a source that can send a signal to its left or right at a certain rate. Once a square is turned black, it can no longer send signals. The process stops when all white squares have both neighbors black.

But perhaps this is overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

Each white square, when selected, will attempt to color one of its neighbors black. So, for a given square i, the probability that it remains white depends on whether neither of its neighbors (i-1 and i+1) ever successfully color it black.

Wait, but square i can only be colored black if either i-1 or i+1 is selected, and then the direction towards i is chosen. So, the probability that i is never colored black is the probability that neither i-1 nor i+1 ever successfully color it.

But this seems complex because the events are not independent. The selection of squares and their neighbors are dependent because the state of the system changes over time.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model each edge between squares as being "cut" when one of the neighboring squares is selected and the edge is chosen. So, the process stops when all the internal edges (between square 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc.) have been cut. The squares that remain white are those that are isolated by cuts on both their left and right edges.

Wait, that might be a useful approach. Let me consider the edges between squares. There are N+1 edges in total between the N+2 squares (since it's from 1 to N+2, but the first and last are black). Wait no: the initial setup is squares 1 and N+2 are black, and 2 to N+1 are white. So, the edges are between 1-2, 2-3, ..., (N+1)-(N+2). So, N+1 edges in total.

Each time a white square is selected, it attempts to cut one of its edges (left or right), chosen at random. If that edge hasn't been cut before, it gets cut now. Once an edge is cut, the squares on either side can't influence each other anymore.

Wait, no, perhaps that's not quite right. Because when a square is selected, it picks a neighbor. If that neighbor is white, it gets colored black. So the edge between them is effectively being cut, as that neighbor is now black and can no longer be selected.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each edge as being "active" until it's cut. Each time a square is selected, it picks an active edge at random (left or right, if active) and cuts it. Once an edge is cut, the neighboring square is colored black and can't be selected anymore.

Wait, perhaps that's a way to model it. So, the process continues until all edges are cut, which would mean all white squares have been colored black. But wait, that's not the case because the stopping condition is when all remaining white squares have only black neighbors, which would mean that all their adjacent edges have been cut. So, perhaps the process stops when all internal edges have been cut, leaving only isolated black squares.

Wait, but perhaps the model is similar to the "random cutting" of edges until all remaining white squares are isolated. Each time you select a white square, you cut one adjacent edge (left or right). So, for each edge between two white squares, the probability that it gets cut is determined by how often the adjacent squares are selected.

But I'm not sure if this approach is getting me anywhere. Maybe I should think about the problem in terms of each square's probability of being isolated.

Wait, going back to the idea that w(N) is the sum of the probabilities that each square remains white. So, if I can compute p, the probability that a particular square remains white in the end, then w(N) = N * p, so the limit is p.

Now, let's model p for the middle square. Let's assume that the system is large, so edge effects can be neglected, and each square is in the middle, with squares on both sides.

Each square can be turned black if either its left or right neighbor is selected, and then the respective direction is chosen. So, the square will be colored black if either neighbor successfully sends a color change to it.

But the process is memoryless, so each square's chance of being colored black depends on the rate at which its neighbors are selected and choose to color it.

Wait, perhaps each square can be thought of as being "attacked" by its left and right neighbors. Each neighbor has a certain rate of attacking this square. The square will be colored black if either neighbor successfully attacks it before the process stops.

But how do we model the probability that neither neighbor ever attacks it?

Alternatively, perhaps each edge can be considered as a Poisson process, where each edge has a rate of being cut. For a given square, the left edge and right edge are each being cut at a certain rate, and the square remains white only if both edges are cut before any of the attacks from the other side reach it.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I can model the situation as each edge between white squares being cut at a certain rate, and the probability that a square remains white is the probability that both edges adjacent to it are cut before the square itself is selected.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's try to think differently.

Suppose that each white square is equally likely to be chosen at each step. When a square is chosen, it will attempt to color one of its neighbors. So, for a given square i, the rate at which its left neighbor (i-1) can cause it to be colored black is proportional to the probability that i-1 is selected and then chooses to color i.

Similarly for the right neighbor (i+1). So, the total rate at which square i is colored black is the sum of the rates from left and right.

But in the limit of large N, perhaps the process can be approximated as a continuous-time Markov process, where each square has a certain hazard rate of being colored black.

Wait, if I model each square as being subject to a Poisson process where each neighbor contributes to the rate of it being colored. Then, the probability that square i remains white is the probability that neither of these Poisson processes has occurred by the time the process stops.

But I'm not sure how to calculate this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of each square being removed (colored black) at a certain rate, and the process stopping when no more squares can be removed.

Wait, maybe it's simpler to model the process as each white square being removed at a rate proportional to the number of active neighbors. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think of each internal edge as being cut at a certain rate. Each edge between i and i+1 can be cut in two ways: either square i chooses to cut the edge to the right, or square i+1 chooses to cut the edge to the left. Each of these happens with a certain probability per unit time.

Assuming that the process is memoryless and each square is equally likely to be chosen, the rate at which edge i-i+1 is cut would be proportional to the number of active squares adjacent to it, times the probability of choosing that edge.

Wait, suppose that at any time, the number of active (white) squares is m. Then, each active square is equally likely to be chosen, so the rate at which a particular square is chosen is 1/m per unit time. When a square is chosen, it picks one of its active edges (left or right) at random. So, for an edge between i and i+1, the rate at which it's cut would be the sum of the rates from both sides.

From square i: the rate is (1/m) * (1/2), since when square i is chosen, it picks the right edge with probability 1/2, provided that edge is still active.

Similarly, from square i+1: the rate is (1/m) * (1/2), since when square i+1 is chosen, it picks the left edge with probability 1/2, provided that edge is active.

So, the total rate at which edge i-i+1 is cut is (1/m) * (1/2) + (1/m) * (1/2) = 1/m.

Wait, but m is the number of active squares, which changes over time. So this complicates things because m isn't constant.

Alternatively, perhaps in the limit as N approaches infinity, we can model this using a differential equation. Let me consider the expected number of active squares over time.

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar problems or known results. Wait, I recall that this problem is related
