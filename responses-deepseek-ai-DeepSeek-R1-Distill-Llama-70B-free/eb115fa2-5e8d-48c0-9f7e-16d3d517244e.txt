Okay, so I've got this economics question here about potential GDP and what would cause it to fall, ceteris paribus. Hmm. Let me think about what potential GDP means first. From what I remember, potential GDP is the maximum level of output an economy can sustain when it's using its resources efficiently, right? It's like the economy's full capacity. So, factors that affect the supply side or the production capacity would influence potential GDP.

The question is asking, which option would cause potential GDP to fall, assuming all else is equal. So I need to look through each option and see which one reduces the economy's productive capacity.

Option A: Tariffs protecting domestic jobs are eliminated. Wait, tariffs are taxes on imports. If they're removed, that probably makes imports cheaper. But how does that affect potential GDP? Well, cheaper imports might lead to more competition for domestic industries. Could that reduce domestic production in some sectors? Or maybe it allows resources to shift to more efficient areas. Wait, but removing tariffs can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources, which might actually increase potential GDP. Or maybe not, because some industries might shrink, but others expand. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe this isn't the right answer because eliminating tariffs could lead to a more efficient economy, possibly increasing potential GDP, not decreasing.

Option B: The literacy rate improves. Literacy rate going up means a more educated workforce. That should increase productivity, right? Because a more educated workforce can be more efficient. So this would probably increase potential GDP, not decrease it. So B is not the answer.

Option C: The tax rate is lowered. Lower taxes can increase incentives for people to work and invest. That could lead to more investment in capital, maybe more labor supply. So lower taxes might increase potential GDP. So C is not the answer.

Option D: The inflation rate decreases. Hmm, lower inflation. I'm not sure how that directly affects potential GDP. Inflation is more about price levels, not the real output capacity. Unless high inflation was causing uncertainty and deterring investment, but the question is about a decrease. I'm not too sure, but I don't think this directly reduces potential GDP. So probably D isn't the answer.

Option E: Increase in technological advancements. That's a clear one. Technological progress increases productivity, which would increase potential GDP. So E isn't the answer.

Option F: Foreign investments increase. More foreign investment can lead to more capital in the economy, which can increase production capacity. So potential GDP would go up, not down. So F isn't it.

Option G: More immigration is allowed. Immigration increases the labor force. A larger labor force means more people working, which can increase potential GDP. So G isn't the answer.

Option H: The retirement age is lowered. Oh, wait, if the retirement age is lowered, more people retire earlier. That reduces the labor force because older workers leave the workforce. With fewer workers, the economy's potential output might decrease. So H seems like a possible correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Potential GDP depends on the factors of production: labor, capital, technology, and entrepreneurship. If the retirement age is lowered, the labor force participation rate might drop. Let's say people retire earlier, so the workforce becomes smaller. A smaller workforce would mean less production capacity, so potential GDP would fall. That makes sense.

So looking back at the options, the correct answer should be H.

Potential GDP represents the maximum output an economy can sustain when using its resources efficiently. To determine which option would cause potential GDP to fall, we analyze each choice:

- **A**: Eliminating tariffs can lead to more efficient resource allocation and increased competition, potentially increasing potential GDP.  
- **B**: An improved literacy rate increases workforce productivity, raising potential GDP.  
- **C**: Lowering the tax rate incentivizes work and investment, likely increasing potential GDP.  
- **D**: A decrease in inflation does not directly reduce potential GDP.  
- **E**: Technological advancements boost productivity, increasing potential GDP.  
- **F**: Increased foreign investment adds capital, raising potential GDP.  
- **G**: More immigration expands the labor force, increasing potential GDP.  
- **H**: Lowering the retirement age reduces the labor force, decreasing potential GDP.  

The correct answer is **H**, as a smaller workforce reduces the economy's productive capacity.  

Answer: H
