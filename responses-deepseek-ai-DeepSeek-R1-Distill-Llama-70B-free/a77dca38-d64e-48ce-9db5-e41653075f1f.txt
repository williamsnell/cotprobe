Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because infinite products can be tricky. But let's break it down step by step.

The problem is to evaluate the limit as x approaches 1 from the left of an infinite product. The product is from n equals 0 to infinity of ( (1 + x^{n+1}) / (1 + x^n) )^{x^n}. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me write it out to visualize it better.

So the expression is the product from n=0 to ∞ of [ (1 + x^{n+1}) / (1 + x^n) ]^{x^n}. And we're taking the limit as x approaches 1 from below.

First, I remember that when dealing with infinite products, taking the logarithm can be helpful because it converts products into sums, which are often easier to handle. So maybe I should take the natural log of the product and then see if I can evaluate the limit there.

Let me denote the product as P. So,

P = product_{n=0}^∞ [ (1 + x^{n+1}) / (1 + x^n) ]^{x^n}

Taking the natural log:

ln P = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n * ln( (1 + x^{n+1}) / (1 + x^n) )

Simplify the argument of the log:

ln( (1 + x^{n+1}) / (1 + x^n) ) = ln(1 + x^{n+1}) - ln(1 + x^n)

So,

ln P = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n [ ln(1 + x^{n+1}) - ln(1 + x^n) ]

Hmm, maybe this sum can be telescoped or simplified somehow. Let's look at the terms.

Let me write out the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.

For n=0:

x^0 [ ln(1 + x^{1}) - ln(1 + x^0) ] = 1*(ln(1+x) - ln(2))

n=1:

x^1 [ ln(1 + x^{2}) - ln(1 + x^1) ] = x*(ln(1+x²) - ln(1+x))

n=2:

x² [ ln(1 + x^3) - ln(1 + x^2) ]

And so on.

So the sum becomes:

[ln(1+x) - ln(2)] + x[ln(1+x²) - ln(1+x)] + x²[ln(1+x^3) - ln(1+x²)] + ... 

Hmm, maybe if I rearrange the terms. Let's see: each term has a positive part and a negative part. Maybe the negative part of one term cancels with the positive part of another.

Wait, let me think about it. Let's consider each term as a pair. For example:

The first term is (ln(1+x) - ln(2)).

The second term is x*(ln(1+x²) - ln(1+x)).

The third term is x²*(ln(1+x^3) - ln(1+x²)).

So, if I group them, perhaps some cancellation happens.

Let me try to write the sum S = sum_{n=0}^∞ a_n, where a_n = x^n [ln(1+x^{n+1}) - ln(1+x^n)].

So S = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... 

Now, a_0 = 1*(ln(1+x) - ln(2)).

a_1 = x*(ln(1+x²) - ln(1+x)).

a_2 = x²*(ln(1+x^3) - ln(1+x²)).

So let's write S as:

(ln(1+x) - ln(2)) + x*(ln(1+x²) - ln(1+x)) + x²*(ln(1+x^3) - ln(1+x²)) + ... 

Now, let's try to see if terms cancel. The first term has ln(1+x), and the second term has -ln(1+x) multiplied by x. Similarly, the second term has ln(1+x²) multiplied by x, and the third term has -ln(1+x²) multiplied by x².

Wait, perhaps we can factor these terms. Let me try to factor each term.

Looking at each a_n:

a_n = x^n [ln(1+x^{n+1}) - ln(1+x^n)].

Which can be written as:

a_n = x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}) - x^n ln(1 + x^n).

So, S = sum_{n=0}^∞ [x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}) - x^n ln(1 + x^n)].

Now, let's split the sum into two parts:

S = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}) ) - sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n ln(1 + x^n}.

Let me call the first sum S1 and the second sum S2.

So, S1 = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}).

S2 = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n ln(1 + x^n}.

Hmm, maybe there's a way to relate S1 and S2. Let me see.

Notice that in S1, each term has x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}), which is similar to the term in S2 but with n+1 instead of n.

So perhaps S1 can be expressed in terms of S2 shifted by one index.

Let me try to shift the index in S1. Let m = n + 1. Then when n=0, m=1, and as n approaches infinity, m approaches infinity.

So S1 becomes sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^{m}).

Which is the same as sum_{m=1}^∞ (x^{m-1}) ln(1 + x^m).

So S1 = sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m).

Now, S2 is sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n ln(1 + x^n} = sum_{m=0}^∞ x^m ln(1 + x^m).

So, S = S1 - S2 = [sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m)}] - [sum_{m=0}^∞ x^m ln(1 + x^m)}].

Let me write S as:

S = sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) ) - sum_{m=0}^∞ x^m ln(1 + x^m}.

Now, let's separate the m=0 term from the second sum:

sum_{m=0}^∞ x^m ln(1 + x^m) = x^0 ln(1 + x^0) + sum_{m=1}^∞ x^m ln(1 + x^m}.

Which is ln(2) + sum_{m=1}^∞ x^m ln(1 + x^m}.

So substituting back into S:

S = sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) ) - [ ln(2) + sum_{m=1}^∞ x^m ln(1 + x^m} ) ].

So S = sum_{m=1}^∞ [x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) - x^m ln(1 + x^m)}] - ln(2).

Factor out ln(1 + x^m) from each term in the sum:

sum_{m=1}^∞ ln(1 + x^m) (x^{m-1} - x^m) ) - ln(2).

Simplify x^{m-1} - x^m = x^{m-1}(1 - x).

So,

S = sum_{m=1}^∞ ln(1 + x^m) * x^{m-1}(1 - x) ) - ln(2).

Factor out (1 - x):

S = (1 - x) sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) ) - ln(2).

Hmm, wait a second. The sum here is sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m).

Let me make a substitution. Let k = m-1, so m = k+1. Then when m=1, k=0, and as m approaches infinity, k approaches infinity.

So,

sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) = sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{k} ln(1 + x^{k+1}).

Wait, but that's the same as the original S1, which was sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}).

Hmm, maybe I'm going in circles here. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression for this sum in terms of known functions.

Wait, I recall that there's a series expansion for -ln(1 - x) as sum_{n=1}^∞ x^n / n for |x| < 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating term by term. Because the logarithm can be expressed as an integral.

Wait, let me think. The logarithm function can be written as ln(1 + y) = integral from 0 to y of 1/(1 + t) dt.

So, ln(1 + x^m) = integral_{0}^{x^m} dt/(1 + t).

But substituting this into the sum might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe expanding ln(1 + x^m) as a power series.

I know that ln(1 + z) = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k+1} z^k /k for |z| < 1.

So, for |x^m| < 1, which would be true if |x| < 1. Since we're taking x approaching 1 from below, x is less than 1 but approaching it.

So, ln(1 + x^m) = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k+1} x^{m k} / k.

Substituting this into the sum:

sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) = sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k+1} x^{m k} / k.

Interchange the order of summation (if allowed):

= sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k+1} /k sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1 + m k}.

Simplify the exponent in x: m-1 + m k = m(k + 1) -1.

So, sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m(k+1) -1} = x^{-1} sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m(k+1)}.

The sum sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m(k+1)} is a geometric series starting at m=1, so it's x^{k+1}/(1 - x^{k+1}).

So,

sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m(k+1) -1} = x^{-1} * x^{k+1}/(1 - x^{k+1}) ) = x^{k}/(1 - x^{k+1}).

Putting this back into the sum:

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k+1} /k * x^{k}/(1 - x^{k+1}).

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of taking the logarithm, I should consider the infinite product directly, especially since each term is of the form (1 + x^{n+1})/(1 + x^n), which might telescope when multiplied across n.

Let me think about the product. The product is from n=0 to ∞ of (1 + x^{n+1})/(1 + x^n})^{x^n}.

Wait, let's write out the product terms:

For n=0: (1 + x^1)/(1 + x^0) = (1 + x)/2.

For n=1: (1 + x^2)/(1 + x)^{x}.

Wait, no, each term is [(1 + x^{n+1})/(1 + x^n}]^{x^n}.

Wait, perhaps I can write the product as a telescoping product. Because when you multiply terms, some factors might cancel out.

Let me think about the product up to some finite N and see if there's a pattern.

So, product_{n=0}^N [ (1 + x^{n+1}) / (1 + x^n) )^{x^n} ].

Let me take the logarithm of this finite product to see if it's easier.

ln P_N = sum_{n=0}^N x^n [ ln(1 + x^{n+1}) - ln(1 + x^n) ].

Wait, this is similar to what I had before when I took the logarithm. And earlier, I tried to find that this sum could telescope.

Wait, perhaps the sum S_N = sum_{n=0}^N x^n [ ln(1 + x^{n+1}) - ln(1 + x^n) ].

Let me see if this can be rewritten as a telescoping sum.

S_N = sum_{n=0}^N [x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}) - x^n ln(1 + x^n)].

Hmm, perhaps I can split this into two sums: sum x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}) and sum x^n ln(1 + x^n).

Wait, let's look at the first sum: sum_{n=0}^N x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}).

If I shift the index by letting m = n +1, then when n=0, m=1, and when n=N, m=N+1.

So sum_{n=0}^N x^n ln(1 + x^{n+1}) = sum_{m=1}^{N+1} x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m).

Similarly, the second sum is sum_{n=0}^N x^n ln(1 + x^n}.

So, S_N = sum_{m=1}^{N+1} x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) - sum_{n=0}^N x^n ln(1 + x^n)}.

Let me write this as:

sum_{m=1}^{N+1} x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) - sum_{m=0}^N x^m ln(1 + x^m}.

Now, let me separate the sums:

sum_{m=1}^{N+1} x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) = sum_{m=1}^{N} x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) + x^{N} ln(1 + x^{N+1}).

And the second sum is sum_{m=0}^N x^m ln(1 + x^m} = x^0 ln(2) + sum_{m=1}^N x^m ln(1 + x^m}.

Putting it together:

S_N = [sum_{m=1}^{N} x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) + x^{N} ln(1 + x^{N+1})] - [ln(2) + sum_{m=1}^N x^m ln(1 + x^m)} ].

Now, let's subtract term by term.

The sum from m=1 to N of x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) minus the sum from m=1 to N of x^m ln(1 + x^m}.

So, each term would be x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) - x^m ln(1 + x^m) = x^{m-1} (1 - x) ln(1 + x^m).

And then we have the additional terms:

+ x^{N} ln(1 + x^{N+1}) - ln(2).

So,

S_N = (1 - x) sum_{m=1}^N x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) + x^N ln(1 + x^{N+1}) - ln(2).

Hmm, this seems similar to what I had earlier. But as N approaches infinity, what happens?

As N approaches infinity, x^N approaches 0 since x < 1. So x^N ln(1 + x^{N+1}) approaches 0 because x^{N+1} approaches 0, and ln(1 + 0) = 0. So that term goes away.

Therefore, S = lim_{N→∞} S_N = (1 - x) sum_{m=1}^∞ x^{m-1} ln(1 + x^m) - ln(2).

Wait, but earlier I had an expression for S in terms of another sum. Maybe I can find a way to evaluate this sum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a generating function or relate it to known series.

Wait, another approach: since we're taking x approaching 1 from below, maybe we can approximate the sum for x near 1.

Let me set x = 1 - ε, where ε is a small positive number approaching 0.

So, x approaches 1 as ε approaches 0.

Now, let's consider the sum S for x near 1.

Wait, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that as x approaches 1, the sum can be approximated by an integral.

Because when x is close to 1, the terms vary smoothly, and the sum can be treated as an integral over
