Question:

A husband and wife divorced after 17 years of marriage. They had one son, aged 10. As part of the divorce decree, the wife was given custody of the son, while the husband was entitled to weekend visitation. Thereafter, the husband accepted a new job in a neighboring state. Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son. The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence. As a consequence, the attorney advised the husband that he could take the son to live with him and not be in violation of the law. This was erroneous legal advice, and his new state, in fact, did honor and give full faith and credit to other states' divorce decrees. When his next scheduled visitation took place, the husband picked up his son at his ex-wife's home. Instead of returning his son, he took him to live with him in his new state. After refusing to return his son to his ex-wife, the husband was subsequently arrested and charged with kidnapping. The applicable statute is defined as "knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location. "Should the husband be found guilty of kidnapping?

Options:

A: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.
B: Yes, because he intentionally kept his son from his ex-wife.
C: No, because as the father, he has the right to custody of his son.
D: No, because his actions were based on the legal advice he received.
E: Yes, because he did not have the legal right to take his son to another state.
F: No, because he received erroneous legal advice.
G: Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.
H: No, because the son willingly went with him.
I: Yes, because he knowingly moved his son to another location.
J: No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the husband should be found guilty of kidnapping based on the given scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the facts: The husband and wife divorced after 17 years, and the wife got custody of their 10-year-old son. The husband had weekend visitation rights. Then, the husband got a new job in a neighboring state and consulted an attorney about gaining full custody. The attorney told him that the new state didn't give full faith and credit to the divorce proceedings from the former state, so he could take the son without violating the law. But this was wrongâ€”the new state actually does honor such decrees. So, during his next visitation, he took the son to live with him in the new state and refused to return him, leading to his arrest for kidnapping.

The statute in question defines kidnapping as "knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location." The key elements here are "knowingly" and "abducting."

So, the legal issue is whether the husband's actions meet the elements of kidnapping, considering any possible defenses he might have.

Let's consider the elements. The husband did take the child to another state without the ex-wife's consent. That's moving him. But was it an abduction? Abduction implies taking someone without their consent or legal right. Since the divorce decree gave custody to the wife, the husband taking the child without permission would be against the law.

Now, the husband received erroneous legal advice. He was told by his attorney that the new state didn't recognize the divorce decree, so he thought he was acting legally. But in reality, the state does honor it, so his action was illegal.

The question is whether his mistaken belief, based on the attorney's advice, affects his mens rea, the mental state required for the crime. The statute requires that he "knowingly" abduct the person. If he believed, based on the attorney's advice, that he had the legal right to take the child, does that negate the "knowingly" element?

In general, a mistake of law can be a defense if it's a reasonable mistake based on official statements or advice. However, the idea that "mistake of law is no defense" is a common legal principle unless the mistake is based on an official statement of law that's later deemed incorrect.

So, the husband relied on his attorney's advice, which was incorrect. But does that reliance make his actions not "knowing"? If he genuinely believed he was acting legally, he might not have the intent to abduct unlawfully.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The attorney's advice was that the new state didn't give full faith and credit, so he thought taking the child was legal. But in reality, the state does honor the decree, so his action was against the law. So, does his mistaken belief about the law negate the intent?

In some jurisdictions, a mistake of law based on an attorney's advice can be a defense, but it's not always a sure thing. The general rule is that a mistake of law doesn't excuse illegal conduct unless the mistake is about the law's requirements and is based on an official source.

In this case, the attorney's advice was wrong, but the husband relied on it. So, he might argue that he didn't knowingly commit the crime because he thought he was acting legally.

However, I remember that in criminal law, the defense of mistake of law is limited. For example, if someone relies on an attorney's incorrect advice, it's not a defense unless the law explicitly allows it. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Wait, looking back: some crimes require specific intent, but kidnapping might not. If the statute requires knowingly abducting, then the husband's belief that he had the right might negate the "knowingly" part because he didn't realize he was abducting unlawfully.

But another angle: the husband's intent was to take the child, which he did. The question is whether he knew it was illegal. If he thought it was legal, he didn't have the intent to abduct unlawfully. So, his mistake might negate the mens rea.

But wait, the options given. Let's look at the options:

Option A: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense. This is the general rule, but if the mistake negates the mens rea, it's a defense. So this might not be correct.

Option E: Yes, because he didn't have the legal right. This focuses on the legality, not his mental state. So if he didn't have the right, he's guilty regardless of his belief.

Option G: Yes, because he transported the son unlawfully, violating the divorce decree. This also focuses on the action, not his intent.

Option J: No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind. This would mean his mistaken belief negates the intent.

So, the issue is whether the husband's mistaken belief based on the attorney's advice negates the "knowingly" element.

In many jurisdictions, a mistake of law, even if reasonable, is not a defense unless it's based on an official statement of the law. For example, if a statute is misleading, or a court decision is later overturned, but that's not the case here. The attorney's advice is not an official source, so perhaps the husband's mistake doesn't excuse him.

Therefore, even if he thought it was legal, if the law says it's illegal, his mistake doesn't matter. So, the answer would be A: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.

But wait, some cases do recognize that reliance on an attorney's advice can negate specific intent. For example, if the crime requires intent to violate the law, and the defendant thought they were acting legally, they might lack that intent.

So, if the crime requires knowingly abducting, and the husband thought he had the right, he didn't know he was abducting unlawfully. Therefore, he lacks the mens rea, so he's not guilty.

So, looking at the options, option J says no because he lacked the requisite state of mind.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn because the general rule is that mistake of law isn't a defense, but when it's based on an attorney's advice, sometimes it's considered. Also, whether the crime requires specific intent or just general intent.

In this case, the statute says "knowingly abducting," which implies a higher level of intent. If he didn't know his actions were illegal, he didn't knowingly abduct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is J: No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.

But earlier I thought A was the answer, relying on the general rule. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The attorney's advice was that he could take the son without violating the law. So, the husband believed he was acting lawfully. Therefore, he didn't knowingly abduct because he thought it was legal.

So, his mistake negates the mens rea. Thus, he's not guilty, making the answer J.

But wait, another thought: kidnapping in many jurisdictions doesn't require specific intent to violate the law, just the intent to take the person. So, if he intended to take the child, knowing that the other parent didn't consent, that might be enough.

Ah, so perhaps the "knowingly" in the statute refers to the act of abduction, not the legality. So, he knew he was taking the child without the mother's consent, which is enough for the mens rea. His belief about the legality might not matter because he knew he was taking the child against her will.

In that case, his mistaken belief about the law doesn't negate the fact that he knowingly abducted the child. So, he would be guilty, making option A correct.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify.

The elements are: (1) knowingly (2) abducts another person (3) and moves them.

If "knowingly" refers to the act of abduction, which includes taking without consent, then his knowledge that he's taking the child without consent is enough. His mistaken belief about the legality (that he thought he had the right) doesn't change the fact that he knew he was taking the child without the mother's permission.

So, in that interpretation, his mistake of law doesn't negate the mens rea. Therefore, he's guilty.

So, the answer would be A: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.

But wait, some might argue that "abduction" inherently implies illegality, so if he thought it was legal, he didn't believe he was abducting. So, the mistake could negate the "abduction" element.

But I think "abduction" in the legal sense is about the act, not the legality. So, taking someone without their consent is abduction regardless of whether you think you have a right.

So, the husband knew he was taking the child without the mother's consent, so he knowingly abducted him, regardless of his mistaken belief about the law.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option E says yes because he didn't have the legal right. That's a correct statement, but does it address the mental state? The statute requires knowingly, so even if he didn't have the right, if he didn't know he was acting wrongly, maybe he lacks the mens rea.

But I think the key is that he intended to take the child without consent, which is enough for the "knowingly" element. His mistake about the law doesn't change that he knew he was taking the child without the mother's permission, which is the essence of abduction.

So, I think the answer is A.

The question revolves around whether the husband should be found guilty of kidnapping under the given statute, which defines kidnapping as "knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location." The key elements to consider are the "knowingly" requirement and whether the husband's mistaken belief about the legality of his actions, based on erroneous legal advice, negates this mental state.

The husband took his son without the ex-wife's consent, violating the divorce decree, and moved him to another state. The attorney's advice that the new state did not honor the divorce decree was incorrect, but the husband relied on this advice, believing his actions were legal. The issue is whether this mistaken belief negates the "knowingly" element of the crime.

In general, "mistake of law" is not a defense unless the mistake is based on an official statement of the law. Here, the attorney's advice is not an official source, so the husband's reliance on it does not excuse his actions. The "knowingly" element refers to the act of abduction, which involves taking someone without consent. The husband intentionally took the child without the mother's consent, satisfying the "knowingly" requirement. His mistaken belief about the legality of his actions does not negate the fact that he knowingly abducted the child.

Therefore, the husband should be found guilty of kidnapping because mistake of law is no defense in this context.
