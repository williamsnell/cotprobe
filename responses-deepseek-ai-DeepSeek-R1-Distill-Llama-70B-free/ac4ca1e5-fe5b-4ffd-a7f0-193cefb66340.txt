Okay, so I have this question about family therapy approaches, specifically the structural approach by Salvador Minuchin. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option a family therapist using Minuchin's structural approach would most likely do. The options are A through I. 

First, I remember that Minuchin's approach focuses a lot on family structure, particularly the boundaries and subsystems within the family. I think he emphasized looking at the family as a system with different parts that interact. So the therapist would probably work on restructuring these boundaries.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Use a single-therapist model. I'm not sure about this. Some approaches use multiple therapists, like in some systemic approaches where an observing team is used. But I don't recall Minuchin specifically requiring that. Maybe he uses a single therapist, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Focus solely on individual sessions. No, that doesn't sound right. Structural family therapy is more about the family dynamics together, not just individual work. They probably do most of the work with the whole family present.

Option C: Work initially with the most differentiated family member. Differentiation is a concept from Bowenian theory, I think. It refers to how well a person can maintain their sense of self in the family. Minuchin's approach is more about restructuring the family's boundaries, so maybe not this.

Option D: Avoid discussing family dynamics and focus on external factors. No, that seems opposite. Structural therapy is all about the internal dynamics, not external factors like social environment. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Encourage solving issues independently. I don't think so. The approach is more about changing the interactions within the family, so the therapist would likely be involved in guiding those changes.

Option F: Avoid issuing directives. Wait, I think some approaches, like solution-focused, might avoid giving directives, but in structural therapy, the therapist is more active. Minuchin's approach is known for being directive, like setting up exercises or restructuring sessions, so F seems unlikely.

Option G: Use a multiple-therapist team to prevent triangulation. Triangulation is when a therapist gets drawn into the family's system. I thought Minuchin might sometimes work with a team, but I'm not sure if this is a key part of his approach. Alternatively, maybe he uses a single therapist but employs techniques to avoid being triangulated.

Option H: Encourage groupthink for harmony. That doesn't sound right. Groupthink is bad in therapyâ€”it leads to poor decisions. Structural therapy would aim for healthier communication, not forced harmony through groupthink.

Option I: Clarify boundaries to reduce enmeshment. Oh yeah, this rings a bell. Enmeshment is when family members are too involved in each other's lives, with unclear boundaries. Minuchin's approach often involves restructuring the family to have clearer boundaries and reduce enmeshment. So I think this is the correct answer.

Let me double-check. Structural therapy involves looking at the family structure, hierarchy, and boundaries. The therapist might set up exercises to redefine these boundaries. So yes, option I makes sense.

Another thing: I remember Minuchin using techniques like "boundary making" to help families become less enmeshed. So I'm pretty confident that the answer is I.

The structural approach of Salvador Minuchin focuses on examining and restructuring the boundaries and subsystems within a family to improve communication and reduce dysfunction. Among the options provided, the most consistent with this approach is clarifying boundaries to reduce enmeshment, as this directly addresses a key aspect of Minuchin's methodology.
