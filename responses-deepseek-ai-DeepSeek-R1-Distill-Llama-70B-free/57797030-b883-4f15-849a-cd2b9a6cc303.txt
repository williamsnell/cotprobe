Okay, so I have this question about signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see. The question says that the peak voltage of a signal is 20 times that of the noise. I need to find the SNR and then the SNR in decibels with three significant figures.

Hmm, wait SNR is usually the ratio of the signal power to the noise power, right? Oh wait, or is it voltage? Wait, I think sometimes people talk about voltage SNR, but I'm not sure if that's the same as power.

Wait, I remember that SNR can be expressed in terms of voltage or power. The formula I remember is SNR = (signal power)/(noise power). But power is proportional to the square of the voltage. Oh right, because power is V squared over resistance, but if the resistance is the same for both, then the power ratio is (V_signal / V_noise)^2.

So in this problem, the peak voltage of the signal is 20 times the peak voltage of the noise. So V_signal = 20 * V_noise.

So substituting into the power SNR, that's (20)^2 = 400. So SNR is 400.

But wait, the question first asks for the SNR, which I think is the power ratio, so 400. But looking at the options, I don't see 400. Wait the options are A:15, B:13, etc., so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the SNR in decibels as the first part and the second part is the same in dB? No, the question says what is the SNR and what is the SNR_dB.

Wait, the options are single numbers. Maybe the first part is the linear SNR, and the second is in dB. But the options don't have two answers. Hmm, perhaps the question is just asking for the SNR in dB?

Wait the question is phrased as two parts: "what is the SNR? What is the SNR_dB (in 3 sig.fig.)?" But the options are single answers, so perhaps the question is asking for the SNR_dB. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, what is the SNR? What is the SNR_dB. But the options are all single numbers. So maybe the first part is 400 and the second is 26 dB, but the options don't go that high. Wait, looking at the options, the highest is 40 (option F), but 400 isn't there. Hmm, perhaps I got something wrong.

Wait wait, maybe the SNR is sometimes calculated as the square of the voltage ratio when dealing with power, but in terms of voltage, it's just the linear ratio. So if the signal voltage is 20 times the noise voltage, then the SNR (voltage) is 20. But that would be the linear SNR, but when converted to dB, it's 20 log(20).

Wait no, wait. I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The SNR is usually the power ratio. So if V_signal = 20 V_noise, then power is V². So SNR_power = (20)^2 = 400.

But the options don't have 400, so perhaps the question is asking for the voltage SNR, which is 20, and the dB version. But none of the options match 20 except option I, which is 20.0.

Wait, no, the question is about the SNR and the SNR_dB. So maybe the first part is 20, and the second part is 20 log(20), which is around 26. So perhaps the SNR is 20, and SNR_dB is 26. But looking at the options, I don't see 20 as an option for the second part. Oh wait, the options are all single letters, so perhaps the question is only asking for one of them.

Wait the question says, "what is the SNR? What is the SNR_dB (in 3 sig.fig.)?" But the options are given as single choices, so perhaps it's asking for the SNR_dB.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased such that the first part is the linear SNR, and the second part is the SNR in dB, but the options are each for a different part. But the way the question is written, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the SNR in dB, as SNR_dB. Let me re-express.

If the SNR (power) is 400, then SNR_dB is 10 * log10(400). Let me calculate that.

Log10(400) is log10(4*100) = log10(4) + 2. Log10(4) is about 0.602, so 0.602 + 2 = 2.602. Multiply by 10 gives 26.02 dB. Rounded to three significant figures, that's 26.0.

Looking at the options, E is 26.0. So the answer would be E.

But wait, let me double-check. The peak voltage is 20 times. So V_signal =20 V_noise.

Power SNR is (20)^2 =400. So SNR_dB is 10*log10(400)=26.02≈26.0 dB.

So the correct answer would be E:26.0.

To determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the SNR in decibels (SNR$_{\mathrm{dB}}$), we start by noting that the peak voltage of the signal is 20 times the peak voltage of the noise. 

SNR is typically defined as the ratio of signal power to noise power. Since power is proportional to the square of voltage, the SNR in terms of power is:

\[
\text{SNR} = \left(\frac{V_{\text{signal}}}{V_{\text{noise}}}\right)^2 = 20^2 = 400.
\]

However, the question does not explicitly ask for the linear SNR but rather focuses on the SNR in decibels. The formula for SNR in decibels is:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}(\text{SNR}).
\]

Substituting the linear SNR value:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}(400).
\]

Breaking this down, $\log_{10}(400) = \log_{10}(4 \cdot 100) = \log_{10}(4) + \log_{10}(100)$. Using $\log_{10}(4) \approx 0.602$ and $\log_{10}(100) = 2$, we get:

\[
\log_{10}(400) \approx 0.602 + 2 = 2.602.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \cdot 2.602 = 26.02 \, \text{dB}.
\]

Rounding to three significant figures, $\text{SNR}_{\mathrm{dB}} = 26.0 \, \text{dB}$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 26.0**
