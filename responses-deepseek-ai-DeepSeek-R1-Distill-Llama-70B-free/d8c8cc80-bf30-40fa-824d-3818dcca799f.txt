Okay, so I've got this problem about a constant-volume gas thermometer, and I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem states that a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer reads 6.69 kPa at the triple point of water, which is 273.16 K. The question is asking what change in pressure indicates a change of 1.00 K at this temperature. The options are A through D, with various kPa values.

Hmm, I remember that for a constant-volume gas thermometer, the pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. Oh right, that's from the ideal gas law. Since the volume is constant, the pressure P is proportional to the temperature T. So P = kT, where k is some constant.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. At constant volume V and amount of gas n, P must be proportional to T. So yes, P = (nR/V) * T. So the constant of proportionality is nR/V, but since those are constants in this setup, P is directly proportional to T.

So if I have two points, I can write P1/T1 = P2/T2. Because the ratio P/T remains constant.

In this problem, the initial pressure P1 is 6.69 kPa at T1 = 273.16 K. We need to find the change in pressure when the temperature changes by 1 K. So the temperature could go up or down, but the change in pressure would be the same in magnitude.

Wait wait, the question is about the change in pressure that indicates a 1 K change. So I don't need to compute the new pressure after 1 K, but rather, find how much the pressure changes when the temperature changes by 1 K.

Since P is proportional to T, the change in pressure ΔP should relate to the change in temperature ΔT by the same proportionality. So ΔP is proportional to ΔT.

From P = kT, taking the derivative, dP = k dT. So the change in pressure is k multiplied by the change in temperature.

But what is k here? From P = kT, k is P_initial / T_initial. So k = P1 / T1.

Wait, let's compute that. P1 is 6.69 kPa, T1 is 273.16 K. So k = 6.69 / 273.16.

Calculate that: 6.69 divided by 273.16. Let me approximate. 273 is about 273. So 6.69 / 273 ≈ approximately 0.0245 per K.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 6.69 divided by 273.16. Let's see:

273.16 * 0.0245 = 273 * 0.0245. Let me compute 273 * 0.02 = 5.46, 273 * 0.0045 = 1.2285. So total about 6.6885, which is very close to 6.69. So 0.0245 kPa per K. So for a 1 K change, the pressure changes by approximately 0.0245 kPa.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.0245 kPa, and option A is 0.0127, which is about half. Hmm. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if P is proportional to T, then the change in P would be (P_initial / T_initial) * ΔT. So yes, ΔP = (P_initial / T_initial) * ΔT.

Let me calculate that. So P_initial is 6.69 kPa, T_initial is 273.16 K. So 6.69 / 273.16 = ?

Let me compute this with more precision. 6.69 ÷ 273.16.

Let me think: 273.16 * 0.0245 = ?

Well, 0.0245 is 2.45 x 10^-2. Let's compute 273.16 * 0.0245.

Compute 273.16 * 0.02 = 5.4632.

Compute 273.16 * 0.0045 = 1.22922.

Wait, 0.0045 is 45/10000, so 273.16 * 0.0045 = (273.16 * 45) / 10000.

Compute 273 *45: 270*45=12150, 3*45=135, total 12150+135=12285. 0.16*45=7.2. So 12285 + 7.2 = 12292.2. Divided by 10000: 1.22922.

So 5.4632 + 1.22922 = 6.69242, which is very close to 6.69. So our initial calculation is correct. So 6.69 / 273.16 ≈ 0.0245 kPa per K.

So a 1 K change would result in a 0.0245 kPa change in pressure. So looking at the options, option C is 0.0245 kPa. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in understanding the question. The question says, what change of pressure indicates a change of 1 K. So the ΔP would be 0.0245 kPa for 1 K. So the correct option is C.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option A is 0.0127, which is about half of 0.0245. Where would that come from? Oh wait, perhaps if someone thought in terms of Celsius instead of Kelvin, but no, because in this case, since it's a proportional change, it's per Kelvin. So the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we use the principle that for a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer, the pressure \( P \) is directly proportional to the absolute temperature \( T \). This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
P = kT
\]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality. For small changes, the relationship becomes:

\[
\Delta P = k \Delta T
\]

The constant \( k \) can be determined from the initial conditions. At the triple point of water, the temperature is \( T_1 = 273.16 \, \mathrm{K} \), and the pressure is \( P_1 = 6.69 \, \mathrm{kPa} \). Thus:

\[
k = \frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{6.69}{273.16}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
k \approx 0.0245 \, \mathrm{kPa/K}
\]

This means that for every 1 K change in temperature, the pressure changes by approximately \( 0.0245 \, \mathrm{kPa} \). Therefore, the change in pressure corresponding to a \( 1.00 \, \mathrm{K} \) change in temperature is \( \Delta P = 0.0245 \, \mathrm{kPa} \).

From the given options:

- **A: 0.0127 kPa** — This is approximately half of the correct value and is incorrect.
- **B: 0.0453 kPa** — This is much larger than the calculated value and is incorrect.
- **C: 0.0245 kPa** — This matches the calculated value and is correct.
- **D: 0.0332 kPa** — This is larger than the calculated value and is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: 0.0245 kPa**
