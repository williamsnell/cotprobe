Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about developmental models of intelligence, and I need to figure out which construct isn't pertinent to them. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully: "Identify the only construct that is not pertinent to developmental models on intelligence." The options are A through J, each listing a different theory or concept related to intelligence.

I remember that developmental models focus on how intelligence changes and develops over time. So I need to identify which of these options doesn't fit into that framework.

Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Triarchic theory of intelligence. I think this is Robert Sternberg's theory. It includes three components: analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. Sternberg's work does discuss how these aspects develop, so this is probably part of developmental models.

B: Multiple intelligences theory. That's Howard Gardner's theory, right? He proposes different types of intelligence like linguistic, spatial, etc. His theory definitely talks about how these intelligences develop in individuals, so this is pertinent.

C: Cognitive development theory. Jean Piaget's theory comes to mind here. He's all about the stages of cognitive development in children, so this is definitely a developmental model.

D: The positive manifold. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I recall that positive manifold refers to the idea that different cognitive abilities are positively correlated, meaning they tend to go together. This is more about the structure of intelligence rather than its development. I think it's related to the concept of g (general intelligence), but not specifically about how intelligence develops over time. So this might be the answer.

E: G theory. G refers to general intelligence, the idea that there's a common factor underlying all cognitive abilities. It's more about the structure and existence of general intelligence, not about how it develops. But wait, some theories might discuss how g changes, but I'm not sure. Maybe this is more about the structure than development.

F: Emotional intelligence theory. Peter Salovey and John Mayer's work. They talk about how emotional intelligence can be developed and improved, so this is part of developmental models.

G: Primary mental ability theory. This is from L.L. Thurstone, who proposed that intelligence consists of multiple primary abilities like verbal comprehension, spatial ability, etc. His work was more about the structure of intelligence in adults, not so much about development over time. So this might not be part of developmental models.

H: Fluid and crystallized intelligence theory. That's Raymond Cattell's theory. Fluid intelligence is about problem-solving in new situations and tends to decline with age, while crystallized intelligence is about knowledge and experience and increases with age. This definitely deals with development and changes over time, so it's pertinent.

I: Investment theory. I think this is related to the idea that people invest their abilities in certain areas to develop expertise. It's about how people develop their intelligence through investment of resources, so this fits into developmental models.

J: Information processing theory. This approach looks at how information is processed, focusing on cognitive processes like memory and attention. It's about how these processes develop and improve, so it's part of developmental models.

Now, narrowing it down. The question is asking which construct is NOT pertinent to developmental models. So I need to pick the one that doesn't focus on development.

Option D: Positive manifold is about the correlation between different abilities, supporting the idea of general intelligence. It's more a structural concept rather than a developmental one.

Option E: G theory is about the existence of general intelligence, which is a structural concept. But some theories might discuss how g develops, but I'm not sure. I think G is more about the structure than the development.

Option G: Primary mental abilities are more about breaking down intelligence into components, not about how they develop over time. So this might also be a candidate.

Wait, the question is about developmental models, so constructs not related to how intelligence develops but more about its structure wouldn't be pertinent.

So D is about the structure (positive correlations), G is about breaking down into primary abilities, and E is about general intelligence.

Which one is not related to development. Hmm.

Another angle: Developmental models focus on change over time, stages, or growth. So theories that don't discuss these aspects would be the answer.

Triarchic, Multiple Intelligences, Cognitive Development, Emotional Intelligence, Fluid/Crystallized, Investment, and Information Processing all discuss development.

Primary Mental Abilities (G) is more about the types of intelligence in adults. Positive Manifold (D) is about the correlations. G Theory (E) is about general intelligence.

Wait, but I think G Theory (E) is more about the structure of intelligence, not its development. So E might not be pertinent.

Wait, but the options are D, E, G as possible non-developmental.

But the question says only one is not pertinent.

Wait, let me think. Let me try to remember each theory.

Primary Mental Abilities (Thurstone) - factor theory that proposes several primary abilities. It's a structural model, not about development.

Positive Manifold (D) refers to the tendency for all cognitive abilities to correlate positively, which is the basis for general intelligence. It's a concept used in factor analysis and not about development.

G Theory (E) is about general intelligence, perhaps more about its structure than development.

So which of these is not related to developmental models.

I think the correct answer is either D or G.

Wait, the question is which is NOT pertinent to developmental models. So which of these constructs do developmental models not use.

Developmental models would use theories that explain how intelligence grows, changes, etc.

Positive Manifold is more of a statistical observation rather than a developmental model.

Primary Mental Abilities is a structural theory.

Wait, but the question is about which construct is not pertinent to developmental models. So the answer would be the one that is not a developmental model.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which one is not a developmental model. So the other options are developmental models, but one is not.

Wait no, the question says identify the only construct that is NOT pertinent to developmental models on intelligence.

So, the other options are all part of developmental models, and one is not.

Wait, let me think of each construct:

A: Triarchic - part of developmental theory.

B: Multiple Intelligences - yes.

C: Cognitive development theory - definitely.

D: Positive manifold - not a model, but a concept.

E: G theory - about general intelligence, not a developmental model.

F: Emotional intelligence - part of developmental.

G: Primary mental abilities - structural, not developmental.

H: Fluid and crystallized - developmental.

I: Investment theory - developmental.

J: Information processing - developmental.

So the ones that are not part of developmental models would be D, E, G.

But the question says only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which of these is not a model but a phenomenon.

Positive manifold is an observed phenomenon where different cognitive tests are positively correlated. It's not a model of development.

Similarly, G theory is about general intelligence, but not a developmental model.

Primary mental abilities is a theory about the structure.

So perhaps the answer is D or E or G.

Wait, the options are E: G theory. G: Primary mental ability theory.

Wait the question is about models, so perhaps the answer is G: Primary mental ability theory, since it's a theory about the structure of intelligence, not about development.

Alternatively, D: The positive manifold is a statistical phenomenon, not a model.

Wait, but the question is about constructs, not models. So perhaps the positive manifold isn't part of developmental models.

Wait, the options are constructs, so the question is which construct isn't part of developmental models.

I think the correct answer is G: Primary mental ability theory, as it's a structural theory, not about development.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to look for the answer.

Wait, I think the correct answer is D: The positive manifold.

Because developmental models focus on how intelligence changes over time, while the positive manifold is about the correlations between different abilities, supporting the idea of general intelligence (g). It's more about the structure of intelligence than its development.

So the answer is D.

To determine which construct is not pertinent to developmental models of intelligence, it is important to focus on whether each option discusses how intelligence changes or develops over time. Developmental models emphasize growth, stages, and changes in intelligence across the lifespan. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **A: Triarchic theory of intelligence**: This theory, proposed by Robert Sternberg, includes analytical, creative, and practical intelligence and discusses their development. It is pertinent to developmental models.

- **B: Multiple intelligences theory**: Howard Gardner's theory proposes different types of intelligence and how they develop in individuals. It is relevant to developmental models.

- **C: Cognitive development theory**: Jean Piaget's theory focuses on stages of cognitive development in children, making it a foundational developmental model.

- **D: The positive manifold**: This refers to the observation that different cognitive abilities are positively correlated, supporting the concept of general intelligence. It is a structural concept, not a developmental model, and does not focus on how intelligence changes over time.

- **E: G theory**: This refers to the concept of general intelligence (g). While it is more about the structure of intelligence, some theories may touch on how g develops, making it indirectly relevant to developmental models.

- **F: Emotional intelligence theory**: This theory discusses how emotional intelligence can be developed and improved, aligning it with developmental models.

- **G: Primary mental ability theory**: Proposed by L.L. Thurstone, this theory breaks down intelligence into specific primary abilities. It is more structural and does not focus on developmental aspects.

- **H: Fluid and crystallized intelligence theory**: This theory, by Raymond Cattell, explains how fluid intelligence declines and crystallized intelligence increases with age, making it pertinent to developmental models.

- **I: Investment theory**: This theory explains how individuals develop expertise by investing their abilities in specific areas, fitting within developmental models.

- **J: Information processing theory**: This theory focuses on how cognitive processes like memory and attention develop and improve, making it relevant to developmental models.

The key distinction lies in whether the construct focuses on the development of intelligence over time or its structure. **D: The positive manifold** is a statistical phenomenon describing the correlations between cognitive abilities and does not pertain to developmental models. While **G: Primary mental ability theory** is also structural, the positive manifold is more clearly disconnected from developmental frameworks.

**Answer: D**
