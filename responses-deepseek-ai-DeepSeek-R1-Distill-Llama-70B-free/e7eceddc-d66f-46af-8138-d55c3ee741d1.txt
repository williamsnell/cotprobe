Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the Phillips curve and how a temporary expansionary supply shock affects things. Hmm, I remember the Phillips curve has to do with inflation and unemployment. Let me try to think through this.

So, the question says the economy is in long-run equilibrium, which I think means that the actual unemployment rate equals the natural rate, and the expected inflation rate equals the actual inflation rate. Then there's a temporary expansionary supply shock. I need to figure out how this affects the short-run Phillips curve, the short-run unemployment rate, and the long-run unemployment rate.

Wait, what's a supply shock? Oh right, a supply shock is an event that affects the production capacity of the economy. An expansionary supply shock would be something like a positive shock—like a technological advancement or an increase in resource availability. This should shift the production possibilities curve outward, right? So more goods and services can be produced.

In the context of the Phillips curve, which is about the relationship between inflation and unemployment. The short-run Phillips curve is typically downward sloping, showing that lower unemployment (economic boom) leads to higher inflation, and vice versa.

When there's a positive supply shock, like an expansionary one, it's going to make the economy more efficient. So, for the same level of employment, businesses can produce more. How does that affect the Phillips curve?

I think the short-run Phillips curve shifts. The standard equation is something like inflation = expected inflation + (some coefficient)(unemployment - natural rate). If there's a positive supply shock, I believe the short-run Phillips curve will shift downward. Because with the same unemployment rate, the inflation rate would be lower. Because the supply shock makes production cheaper or more efficient, which reduces costs and thus reduces the inflation rate for any given level of unemployment.

So the first part is that the short-run Phillips curve shifts down. So looking at the options, the first column is about the curve shifting. Options that have 'shifts down' are D, E, H, J.

Next, the short-run unemployment rate. Wait, a positive supply shock would mean the economy can produce more without increasing costs as much. So businesses might hire more people because they can produce more. That would lower the unemployment rate, right? Because more jobs are created, so unemployment falls.

Wait, but wait. In the short run, if the economy is in long-run equilibrium and then a supply shock hits. Let me think about the AD-AS model. A positive supply shock would shift the AS curve to the right. So in the short run, real GDP increases, and the price level decreases. So lower unemployment because more people are employed. So yes, the short-run unemployment rate falls.

But wait, in the initial equilibrium, the economy was at the natural rate. So if the unemployment rate falls below the natural rate, that's possible in the short run. So the short-run unemployment rate would fall.

So the second column, which is about the short-run unemployment rate, would be 'falls' in the correct option.

Now the third part is the long-run unemployment rate. I remember that the long-run unemployment rate is the natural rate, which is determined by structural factors in the economy. A temporary supply shock shouldn't affect the natural rate because it's about the long run. So the long-run unemployment rate remains the same.

Wait, but wait, some sources say that certain shocks can affect the natural rate if they're structural. But in this case, it's a temporary expansionary supply shock. So it's probably a short-term shift, not affecting the long run. So the long-run unemployment rate remains unchanged.

So putting it together: the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, the short-run unemployment rate falls, and the long-run unemployment rate remains the same.

Looking at the options, let's check each.

Option H: Shifts down, falls, falls. No, because long-run doesn't change.

Option J: Shifts down, falls, rises. No, long-run shouldn't rise.

Option E: Shifts down, rises, falls. No, because the short-run unemployment shouldn't rise.

Option D: Shifts down, rises, rises. No, same issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the Phillips curve. The short-run Phillips curve might shift because of the supply shock. Suppose the shock causes potential output to increase. So for a given unemployment rate, the inflation rate would be lower than before. So the curve shifts down.

Therefore, in the short run, the economy can have lower unemployment (since more jobs are available) and lower inflation. So the unemployment rate falls, which is below the natural rate in the short run.

But the natural rate itself is the long-run rate. So the long-run unemployment rate remains unchanged.

So the correct changes are: short-run Phillips shifts down, short-run unemployment falls, and long-run unemployment remains the same.

Looking again at the options, the third column should be "remains the same". Let me look for that.

Wait, the options are:

Looking back at the choices, the columns are:

SHORT-RUN PHILLIPS CURVE | SHORT-RUN UNEMPLOYMENT | LONG-RUN UNEMPLOYMENT

So, the third column is about the long-run unemployment.

Which options have 'remains the same' in the third column?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Remains same, falls, rises.

Option B: Remains same, rises, falls.

Option C: Shifts up, rises, falls.

Option D: Shifts down, rises, rises.

Option E: Shifts down, rises, falls.

Option F: Shifts up, falls, rises.

Option G: Shifts up, falls, falls.

Option H: Shifts down, falls, falls.

Option I: Shifts up, rises, rises.

Option J: Shifts down, falls, rises.

Wait, none of the options have the third column as 'remains the same' except perhaps looking again.

Wait, no, the initial problem statement might have a different structure.

Wait, the options are A through J, with each option having three parts:

The first is the shift of the short-run Phillips curve, the second is the change in the short-run unemployment, and the third is the change in the long-run unemployment.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me look again.

The question is: Which of the following describes the changes in the short-run Phillips curve, the short-run unemployment rate, and the long-run unemployment rate.

So, in the first column, it's about whether the curve shifts up, down, or remains same.

So, in my analysis, the short-run Phillips curve shifts down.

Short-run unemployment rate falls.

Long-run unemployment rate remains same.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any option that has 'shifts down', 'falls', 'remains same' in the third column.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking through the options:

Option H: Shifts down, falls, falls.

So, third column is 'falls', which is long-run unemployment. But I thought the long-run rate doesn't change.

Hmm, perhaps I was wrong. Maybe the long-run rate can be influenced if the supply shock is permanent, but the question says it's temporary.

Wait, the question says it's a temporary expansionary supply shock. So the natural rate (long-run unemployment) is determined by factors that are not temporary. So the long-run rate should remain the same.

So none of the options have 'remains same' in the third column. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is J: Shifts down, falls, rises.

No, that doesn't make sense. Because J's third column is 'rises', which would imply the long-run unemployment rate goes up, which shouldn't happen.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, the supply shock is expansionary, so it increases potential output. In the short run, this would lower unemployment below the natural rate. But in the long run, the economy returns to the natural rate. So the long-run unemployment rate doesn't change.

So, the correct changes are:

- Short-run Phillips curve shifts down.

- Short-run unemployment falls.

- Long-run unemployment remains the same.

Looking back, the options don't have any that fit this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps the long-run unemployment is the natural rate, which is determined by the intersection of the long-run Phillips curve (which is a vertical line at the natural rate). The supply shock affects the short-run but not the long-run. So the long-run unemployment rate remains the same.

So, perhaps the correct option is that the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, short-run unemployment falls, and the long-run unemployment rate is unchanged.

But looking at the options, none of the options have 'unchanged' in the third column. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options for the third column in each option are:

A: Rises

B: Falls

C: Falls

D: Rises

E: Falls

F: Rises

G: Falls

H: Falls

I: Rises

J: Rises

Wait, none have 'remains same'. So perhaps the third column refers to whether it changes, but perhaps the natural rate doesn't change, meaning that in the options, it remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.

The question says it changes the short-run Phillips curve, the short-run unemployment rate, and the long-run unemployment rate. So perhaps all three change.

Wait, but I thought the long-run unemployment rate (natural rate) doesn't change. So maybe the correct option is shifts down, falls, remains same, but such an option doesn't exist.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the long-run rate. Maybe the supply shock somehow affects the natural rate. But a temporary shock shouldn't affect it. For example, a temporary technological improvement might not change the natural rate. But a permanent one would.

So the long-run rate is unaffected.

Thus, I need to find an option where the first column is 'shifts down', the second is 'falls', and the third is 'remains same'. But I don't see such an option.

Wait, perhaps the options don't have such an option, and I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternative approach: think about the impact on the Phillips curve. A positive supply shock would lower the inflation rate for a given unemployment rate, shifting the short-run curve down.

In terms of unemployment, a positive supply shock would cause the economy to move along the SRPC. If the SRPC shifts down, and the actual unemployment is at the natural rate, but then the shock occurs, leading to lower unemployment (since the economy can now produce more, so lower unemployment), so the unemployment rate falls.

The long-run unemployment rate is the natural rate, which is determined by factors like structural issues, so it doesn't change.

So now looking at the options, the correct answer should have:

- Short-run Phillips curve: shifts down.

- Short-run unemployment: falls.

- Long-run unemployment: remains same.

But looking through the options, none have the third column as 'remains same'. Hmmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the options for the third column are about the long-run unemployment rate. So perhaps the natural rate doesn't change, meaning in the options, it's 'remains same', but I don't see that. Wait, looking again:

Wait, perhaps the options have the third column as 'remains same' implicitly, but I don't see it. The options for the third column are 'falls' or 'rises' or what?

Wait, let me list all the options with their three parts:

Option A: Remains same, falls, rises

Option B: Remains same, rises, falls

Option C: Shifts up, rises, falls

Option D: Shifts down, rises, rises

Option E: Shifts down, rises, falls

Option F: Shifts up, falls, rises

Option G: Shifts up, falls, falls

Option H: Shifts down, falls, falls

Option I: Shifts up, rises, rises

Option J: Shifts down, falls, rises

So, none of the options have the third column as 'remains same'. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong about the long-run rate. Maybe in the context of the question, the long-run unemployment rate is considered to be the same as the short-run after the shock in the long run, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the long-run unemployment rate is the natural rate, which is unaffected, so the third column should have 'remains same', but since none of the options have that, perhaps the correct answer is that the long-run rate doesn't change, which is not reflected in any option. But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the long-run unemployment rate changes because the natural rate changes. But a temporary supply shock doesn't change the natural rate. So perhaps the correct answer is that the long-run unemployment rate remains the same, but since none of the options show that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the long-run unemployment rate is the same as the new short-run. No, that's not right. In the long run, the economy returns to the natural rate.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is that the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, the short-run unemployment rate falls, and the long-run unemployment rate is unaffected (remains the same). But since that's not an option, perhaps I should re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is H: shifts down, falls, falls.

But that would imply the long-run unemployment rate falls, which would only happen if the natural rate changes. But a temporary supply shock doesn't change the natural rate. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial analysis is wrong. Maybe the supply shock affects the natural rate.

Wait, a temporary supply shock probably doesn't affect the natural rate. For instance, a bumper wheat crop (temporary) doesn't change the natural rate of unemployment. But a permanent improvement in technology would lower the natural rate.

So in this case, the shock is temporary, so the natural rate doesn't change. So the long-run unemployment rate remains the same.

Looking again, perhaps the correct option is not among the ones I thought. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the short-run unemployment rate falls, but the long-run rate remains the same. So the third column is 'remains same' but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which says shifts down, falls, falls. But that would mean the long-run rate falls, which contradicts my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the shift in the Phillips curve with the movement along it. Let me think again.

In the long run, the economy returns to the natural rate. So the short-run unemployment rate falls, but in the long run, it goes back to the natural rate. So the long-run unemployment rate is unchanged.

Thus, the correct answer should have the third column as 'remains same', but none of the options have that. So perhaps there's a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option where the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, the short-run unemployment falls, and the long-run unemployment remains the same. Since that's not available, perhaps the intended answer is option H.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Phillips curve more carefully. The equation for the short-run Phillips curve is:

π = π^e + β(u - u_n) + supply shock term.

A positive supply shock would reduce π for a given u and u_n. So the curve shifts down.

So in the short run, u falls below u_n. So the short-run unemployment rate falls.

In the long run, the economy returns to u_n, so the long-run unemployment rate remains the same.

So the correct changes are: shifts down, falls, remains same.

But no option has that. So perhaps in the given options, the third column is not part of the answer? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says it changes all three: the short-run Phillips curve, the short-run unemployment, and the long-run unemployment.

Wait, if the long-run unemployment is u_n, which is the natural rate, and if the supply shock is temporary, then u_n doesn't change. So the long-run unemployment rate remains the same.

So, perhaps the answer is that the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, the short-run unemployment rate falls, and the long-run unemployment rate remains the same.

But I don't see any option that fits this. So perhaps the intended answer is option H: shifts down, falls, falls.

But that would imply the long-run rate falls, which I don't think is correct.

Wait, maybe the answer is option J: shifts down, falls, rises.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go through each step again.

1. The economy is in long-run equilibrium: u = u_n, π = π^e.

2. Temporary expansionary supply shock occurs.

3. The supply shock affects the short-run Phillips curve by shifting it down. Because for any given u, π is lower.

4. The economy moves along the new SRPC. Since the AS curve shifts right, u falls below u_n (so short-run unemployment rate falls).

5. In the long run, prices adjust, and the economy returns to u_n, so the long-run unemployment rate remains the same.

Thus, the changes are: SRPC shifts down, short-run u falls, long-run u remains same.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the long-run unemployment rate is considered to remain the same, and the third column in the options isn't about change but about the value. But the options for the third column are 'rises' or 'falls', not 'same'.

Wait, maybe the long-run unemployment rate remains the same, so the answer is that it doesn't change, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H: shifts down, falls, falls.

Wait, but if the long-run rate falls, that's only possible if the natural rate decreases, which would require a permanent change, not a temporary shock.

I'm a bit stuck. But considering that the short-run unemployment rate falls, the SRPC shifts down, and the long-run rate remains the same. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should pick the closest one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended that the long-run rate doesn't change, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps I should select the option where the first two are correct, and the third doesn't change. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Maybe the short-run unemployment rate rises.

Wait, no. An expansionary supply shock would increase output, leading to lower unemployment.

Alternatively, perhaps the short-run unemployment rate rises because of the shift in the Phillips curve. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the Phillips
