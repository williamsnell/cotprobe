Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about strict product liability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on tort law, but let me think it through. The question is about what Bill needs to prove in a strict liability claim against Ajax Minimart.

Alright, the scenario is Bill bought a can of Sipep from Ajax. After drinking, he found dead insects stuck inside the can. So he's suing Ajax under strict product liability. I remember that strict liability doesn't require proof of negligence, just that the product was defective and caused harm.

So the question is asking what Bill must prove, among other things. The options are A through D.

Let me recall the elements of strict product liability. I think it's something like: (1) the defendant is a commercial seller, (2) the product was defective, (3) the defect made the product unreasonably dangerous, (4) the defect existed when it left the manufacturer or seller, and (5) the defect caused the plaintiff's injury.

Wait, so in this case, Ajax is the seller, not the manufacturer. So for a seller to be strictly liable, I think they have to be in the business of selling such products regularly. So maybe option A is about that. Option A says Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. That sounds right because a merchant is someone who deals in goods of that type.

Option B is about Ajax knowing or should have known about the defect. Wait, strict liability doesn't require the seller to know about the defect, right? Because it's strict liability, meaning no fault needed. So B might not be necessary. But wait, maybe in some cases, like if the defect was in the manufacturing process, the seller might not be liable if they couldn't have known. Or perhaps not. I'm a bit confused here.

Option C says Ajax had prior notice of similar problems. Again, I don't think prior notice is required for strict liability. It's more about whether the product was defective when it left their control.

Option D says Ajax actually placed the insects in the can. Well, that would be more like intentional tort or negligence. Strict liability doesn't require intent, so D is probably not correct.

So focusing back, the elements: Bill must prove the seller is a merchant, which is A. Because in strict liability, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant is a commercial seller. If it's a casual sale, like a private person selling, strict liability might not apply.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. In strict product liability, the seller is liable if the product has a defect that makes it unreasonably dangerous. The key here is that the seller must be in the business of selling such goods. So yes, proving that Ajax is a merchant (a commercial seller) is a necessary element.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A. So among the options, A is what Bill must prove.

In a strict product liability case, the plaintiff must establish certain elements, including that the defendant is a commercial seller of the product. This is because strict liability applies to those in the business of selling goods, ensuring they stand behind the products they sell. 

Option A correctly identifies that Ajax must be proven to be a merchant selling Sipep, aligning with the requirement that the defendant is a commercial seller. Other options, such as knowledge of the defect (B), prior notice of similar issues (C), or intentionally placing the defect (D), are not necessary for strict liability, as it does not depend on fault or intent.

Answer: A
