Okay, so I need to find the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 1 eV. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength relates the momentum of a particle to its wavelength. The formula is lambda = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps. Let me think. I should probably start by figuring out the momentum of the electron. Oh right, the kinetic energy is given, and I can relate that to momentum using the kinetic energy formula.

The kinetic energy (KE) for a non-relativistic particle is KE = (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So I can solve for p. Let me write that down.

KE = p²/(2m) → p = sqrt(2m * KE)

But wait, the units! The kinetic energy is given in electron volts. I need to convert that to joules because Planck's constant is in J·s. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602×10^-19 joules. So 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So substituting the values: m is the mass of the electron, which is about 9.109×10^-31 kg. KE is 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

Calculating p: p = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-19 J). Let me compute that.

First, 2 * 9.109e-31 is about 1.8218e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-19 → 1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-19 = approx 2.920e-49. Then take the square root. sqrt(2.920e-49) is about 5.404e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, no, 2 * m is approximately 1.8218e-30 kg. Multiply by 1.602e-19 J gives 2.920e-49 kg·m²/s², because 1 J is kg·m²/s². So taking the square root gives sqrt(2.92e-49) = sqrt(2.92) * 1e-24.5? Wait, 1e-49 is (1e-24.5)^2. So square root of 1e-49 is 1e-24.5, which is the same as 3.16e-25? Wait, no, 1e-24.5 is 3.16e-25? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up exponents. Let me compute 2.92e-49.

Wait, sqrt(2.92e-49) = sqrt(2.92) * sqrt(1e-49). sqrt(2.92) is about 1.708, and sqrt(1e-49) is 1e-24.5, which is approximately 3.16e-25. So 1.708 * 3.16e-25 ≈ 5.40e-25 kg·m/s. So p ≈ 5.40e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, Planck's constant h is 6.626×10^-34 J·s. So lambda = h / p = (6.626e-34) / (5.40e-25). Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 divided by 5.40e-25 → approximately 1.227e-9 meters. Wait, 6.626/5.4 is about 1.227. And 10^-34 / 10^-25 is 10^-9. So lambda ≈ 1.227e-9 meters.

Wait, wait, but 1e-9 meters is 1 nanometer. However, looking at the options, let's see what the choices are.

Looking at the options:

Option F is 5.27e-9 m, which is larger than what I got. Option H is 4.14e-10 m, which is smaller. So my calculation gave around 1.2e-9 m, but that's not directly matching any option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the steps. Another approach: maybe using a shortcut formula. I remember that the de Broglie wavelength for an electron with kinetic energy K is given by lambda = h / sqrt(2m K). Alternatively, there's a known formula that for K in eV, lambda is approximately 1.226e-9 m / sqrt(K). Because when K is in eV, lambda (in meters) is roughly 1.226e-9 divided by the square root of K.

Wait, yeah, that sounds familiar. So for K=1 eV, lambda is approximately 1.226e-9 m. Which is 1.226 nanometers. But looking at the options, option F is 5.27e-9 m, which is about 5.27 nanometers, way longer. Option H is 4.14e-10 m, which is 0.414 nanometers. So none match 1.226e-9.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me try recalculating p.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of eV and use units more carefully. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach.

Another method: using the relation between de Broglie wavelength and voltage. For electrons accelerated through a voltage V, the de Broglie wavelength is given by lambda = h / sqrt(2 m e V), where e is the charge of electron.

Wait, but since the kinetic energy K is eV (electron volts), which is e times V in volts. So K = eV → V = K/e. Wait, no, because 1 eV is the energy when charge e is accelerated through 1 volt. So if K = 1 eV, then V is 1 volt. So perhaps the formula is lambda = h / sqrt(2 m K), with K in joules.

Alternatively, we can write the formula with K in eV. Let me think in terms of units.

h is in J·s, m is in kg. So sqrt(2 m K): K needs to be in J. So yes, K=1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, lambda = (6.626e-34) / sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 * 1.602e-19)

Let me compute the denominator again.

2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30

1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-19 = (1.8218 * 1.602) * 1e-49. 1.8218 *1.602 ≈ 2.921. So 2.921e-49.

sqrt(2.921e-49) = sqrt(2.921) * 1e-24.5. sqrt(2.921) is about 1.708, and 1e-24.5 is 3.16e-25, so 1.708 * 3.16e-25 = approx 5.40e-25 kg·m/s.

So lambda = 6.626e-34 / 5.40e-25 = approx 1.227e-9 meters. Which is 1.227e-9 m. So 1.227 nanometers.

Looking back at the options, the options given are in various units. Let me look for 1.2e-9 m.

Looking at option F: 5.27e-9 m. H is 4.14e-10 m. Wait, no, option F is 5.27e-9 m, which is longer than my result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

I think I might have confused the formula. Another formula I remember is lambda (in Ångströms) ≈ 12.3 / sqrt(K), where K is in eV. Because 1 Å is 1e-10 m.

So for K=1 eV, lambda ≈ 12.3 / 1 → 12.3 Å, which is 1.23e-9 m. So that's 1.23e-9 meters, which matches my earlier calculation. So the correct wavelength is approximately 1.23e-9 m.

Looking at the options again:

Option F is 5.27e-9 m → 5.27 nm.

Option G: 1.23e-7 cm → wait, 1.23e-7 cm is 1.23e-9 m (since 1 cm is 1e-2 m, so 1e-7 cm is 1e-9 m). So option G is 1.23e-9 m? Wait, no, option G says 1.23e-7 cm. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1e-7 cm is 1e-9 meters. So G is 1.23e-7 cm = 1.23e-9 m. Which matches our result.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option G is 1.23 ×10^-7 cm. So 1.23e-7 cm equals 1.23e-9 meters. Because 1 cm = 1e-2 m → 1e-7 cm = 1e-9 m.

So option G would be correct. So the answer should be option G.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Let me read them again.

Options:

A: 2.48e-8 cm → 2.48e-10 m

B: 5.92e7 cm/s → no, that's velocity, but the question is wavelength.

C: 8.66e-6 cm → 8.66e-8 m

D: 3.14e-5 cm → 3.14e-7 m

E: 9.81e-4 cm → 9.81e-6 m

F:5.27e-9 m → 5.27e-9 m

G:1.23e-7 cm → 1.23e-9 m

H:4.14e-10 m → 0.414e-9 m

I: 6.625e-27 erg·s → Planck's constant in erg·s, which is correct (since 1 J=10^7 erg). 6.626e-27 erg·s is correct, but that's Planck's constant, not wavelength.

J:0.512e6 eV → that's energy, not wavelength.

So the correct answer is option G, which is 1.23e-7 cm, equivalent to 1.23e-9 m.

To determine the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 1 eV, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( p \) is the momentum of the electron. The momentum can be derived from the kinetic energy using the relation:

\[
K = \frac{p^2}{2m} \quad \Rightarrow \quad p = \sqrt{2mK}
\]

Here, \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)) and \( K \) is the kinetic energy in joules. Since the kinetic energy is given in electron volts (1 eV), we convert it to joules using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
p = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19}}
\]

First, calculate \( 2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} = 1.8218 \times 10^{-30} \). Then, multiply by \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \):

\[
1.8218 \times 10^{-30} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 2.921 \times 10^{-49}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{2.921 \times 10^{-49}} \approx 5.40 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

Now, calculate the de Broglie wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{5.40 \times 10^{-25}} \approx 1.227 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}
\]

This is equivalent to \( 1.23 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), or \( 1.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm} \).

From the given options:

- **Option G**: \( 1.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm} \) matches the calculated wavelength exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G**
