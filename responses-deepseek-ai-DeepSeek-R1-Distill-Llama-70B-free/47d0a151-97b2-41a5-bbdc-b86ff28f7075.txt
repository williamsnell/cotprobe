Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about an organism that's exposed to wild temperature fluctuations but shows very little change in its metabolic rate. I need to pick the correct term from the options A to J.

Hmm, I remember that organisms are categorized based on how they regulate their body temperature. The main terms I know are endotherm and ectotherm. Endotherms are like mammals and birds; they generate heat internally, so their body temperature stays pretty constant regardless of the environment. Ectotherms, like reptiles, rely on external sources of heat, so their body temp varies with the environment.

Wait, but the question says the organism doesn't change its metabolic rate much despite temperature changes. Metabolic rate is related to how the body generates energy. So if the environment changes a lot and the organism's metabolic rate doesn't, that suggests it's regulating its internal processes somehow.

I think homeotherm might be another term for endotherm, meaning the organism maintains a constant body temperature. So if the environment's temperature is fluctuating wildly but the organism's metabolic rate doesn't change, it's probably because it's maintaining its internal temperature. So homeotherm makes sense here.

Looking at the options, I see option H is homeotherm. So the organism is likely a homeotherm. But let me think again. Another term that comes to mind is eurytherm, which means the organism can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. But eurytherm doesn't necessarily mean the metabolic rate stays the same; it just means they can survive in varying temperatures.

Wait, the question is about metabolic rate not changing. So that points more towards the organism regulating its internal temperature, making it an endotherm or homeotherm. Since endotherm is option D, and homeotherm is H, I think H is the correct term here because it directly refers to maintaining a constant body temperature, thus keeping metabolic processes stable regardless of external changes.

I'm a bit confused between endotherm and homeotherm. Are they the same thing? I think endotherm refers to generating heat internally, while homeotherm refers to maintaining a constant body temperature. So both might apply, but the key is that the metabolic rate doesn't change, which is more about the regulation of internal processes, so homeotherm fits better.

So the correct answer should be H: homeotherm.

The question asks about an organism that shows little to no change in metabolic rate despite exposure to significant temperature fluctuations. This suggests the organism regulates its internal temperature, maintaining a constant metabolic rate. 

Key terms to consider include **endotherm** (generates heat internally) and **homeotherm** (maintains constant body temperature). While both terms relate to temperature regulation, **homeotherm** specifically emphasizes maintaining a stable internal environment, which aligns with the question's focus on constant metabolic rate. 

Other options like **poikilotherm** (variable body temperature) or **eurytherm** (tolerates wide temperature ranges) do not fit, as they do not imply constant metabolic rates. Thus, the correct answer is **homeotherm**.

Answer: H
