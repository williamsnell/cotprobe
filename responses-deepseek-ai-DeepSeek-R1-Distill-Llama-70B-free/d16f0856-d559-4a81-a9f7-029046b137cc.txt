Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Kohler's studies with apes, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Wolfgang Kohler was a psychologist known for his work on animal cognition, especially with apes. His studies were quite famous, I think. From what I recall, he did experiments where he presented apes with problems that required them to find solutions, often using tools.

Wait, the options are A through J. Let's look at them one by one. Option A says that apes can use objects from their environment as tools. That sounds familiar because I remember something about apes using sticks to get food that's out of reach. But I think that was more like Thorndike's experiments with cats in puzzle boxes, or maybe it was someone else. Or was it Kohler? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Option B is about operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is Skinner's thing, where behavior is modified by consequences like rewards or punishments. I don't think Kohler focused on that. His work was more about problem-solving and insight.

Option C states that learning can occur via insight. Oh, right! Kohler is known for his theory of insight learning. He demonstrated that apes could solve problems suddenly, not just through trial and error. For example, using a stick to reach bananas placed outside their cage or stacking boxes to get something. This would fit with insight learning, where the solution comes as a flash of understanding rather than gradual learning.

Option D is about communication abilities. I don't recall Kohler's work focusing on communication. That's more like what people studying language in apes, like sign language experiments, would do.

Option E is latent learning, which is when learning occurs without immediate reinforcement. I think Tolman's experiments with rats in mazes showed latent learning, where the rats learned the maze layout even without rewards until later. So probably not Kohler.

Option F is mirror self-recognition. I remember that's the mirror test, which shows self-awareness. I think that was done by someone like Gordon Gallup. So F isn't about Kohler.

Option G is abstract thinking. While insight might involve some abstraction, I'm not sure if that's the main point. Kohler's work was more about the process of problem-solving through insight.

Option H is mimicry of human behavior. I don't think that's what his studies were about. It was more about problem-solving than imitation.

Option I is solving complex math problems. That doesn't sound right. Apes in Kohler's studies were solving physical problems, not math.

Option J is understanding human languages. Again, that's more about language acquisition studies, not Kohler.

So putting it all together, the key point is that Kohler's work demonstrated insight learning. The apes didn't just try different things randomly; they figured out the solution in their minds. So the correct answer should be option C.

Kohler's studies with apes are best known for demonstrating the concept of insight learning, where animals solve problems through sudden understanding rather than trial and error. This is exemplified by experiments where apes used tools like sticks or stacked boxes to reach food, showcasing their ability to think critically and solve problems. Among the options provided, option C aligns with this understanding, as it directly addresses learning via insight.

Answer: C
