Okay, so I've got this bond problem to solve. Let's see, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best. Alright, the question is about calculating the holding period return for a bond. Hmm, I remember that holding period return (HPR) is like the total return you get from holding an investment over a certain period, including any income and capital gains or losses.

So, the bond details are: it's a five-year maturity, pays 8% coupons annually, and has a face value of $100. It was bought at 104.1 in year 0, which is when it was issued. Now, the person needs to sell it at the end of the third year when the price is 82. Oh, right, and the coupons are not reinvested. The hint says to accumulate all coupons, so I guess I need to add those up.

First, let's break down what I know. The bond was purchased for $104.1. Each year, it pays an 8% coupon on the face value. So the coupon payment each year is 8% of $100, which is $8 per year. Since the bond is held for three years, the total coupons received would be 3 times $8, so $24.

Now, when the bond is sold after three years, the selling price is $82. So the capital gain or loss is the selling price minus the purchase price, but wait, no, the purchase price was at year 0, but the sale is in year 3. So the initial investment is $104.1, and then after three years, the bond is sold for $82.

Wait, but the HPR formula, I think, is (total cash received - initial investment) divided by initial investment. Or maybe it's (total cash received including sale) divided by initial investment. Let me think. Oh, right, the formula is:

HPR = (Sum of all cash inflows + Ending value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment

Wait, no, another way. The HPR is the sum of all cash flows received (including coupons and the sale price) divided by the initial investment. Wait, maybe it's (Total Cash Received - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the HPR can be calculated as the sum of the coupons received plus the capital gain (or loss) from selling, all divided by the initial investment. Or perhaps it's (Cash inflows + (Ending value - Beginning value)) / Beginning value.

Alternatively, I've heard it as the total return, which is (Income + Capital gain) divided by initial investment.

Let me structure this step by step.

Initial Investment (Purchase price) = $104.1.

Cash received from coupons each year = $8 per year. Over three years, that's 3 * $8 = $24.

At the end of year 3, the bond is sold for $82, so the cash from selling is $82.

So total cash received is the sum of all coupons and the sale price. Wait, no, because the coupons are received each year, so they are cash inflows. The sale is another cash inflow. So total cash received is $24 (coupons) + $82 (sale) = $106.

Wait, but wait: the initial investment is $104.1. So the total cash flows are:

At time 0: -104.1 (because you pay that to buy the bond).

At time 1: +8 (coupon).

At time 2: +8.

At time 3: +8 + 82 (coupon plus sale).

So the total cash flows are: -104.1 at 0, and then 8 at 1, 8 at 2, 90 at 3 (8+82).

But for HPR, I think we are to calculate the total return as a percentage over the three years. The formula I remember is:

HPR = (Total Cash Received) / Initial Investment - 1.

Wait, no, the formula is:

HPR = (Total Cash Received + End Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment.

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the HPR is calculated as the sum of all cash flows (excluding the initial investment) plus the ending value, divided by the initial investment, minus 1.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the total return as the sum of all cash received (coupons and sale) minus the initial cost, divided by initial cost.

Wait, let me think differently. The holding period return is the overall return from holding the bond for the period, so it's the sum of the coupon payments received plus the capital gain or loss, divided by the initial purchase price.

So, in this case:

Coupons received: $8 per year for 3 years → $24.

Capital gain or loss: Selling price ($82) minus purchase price ($104.1) → 82 - 104.1 = -22.1.

Wait, but wait! No, I think I'm mixing up something. Because the purchase price is the initial investment, but the sale is after three years. So the capital gain is the selling price minus the initial purchase price? Or is it the cost basis?

Wait, no, I think the capital gain is the difference between the selling price and the initial purchase price. So that's 82 - 104.1 = -22.1.

So the total return is (24 + (-22.1)) / 104.1.

Wait, but that can't be right because 24-22.1 is 1.9. 1.9 / 104.1 is approximately 0.018 or 1.8%. But looking at the options, I don't see 1.8% as an option. Hmm. So maybe I'm doing this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the HPR formula. Let me try again.

HPR is the total return, which is the sum of all the cash flows received (coupons) plus the change in the bond's value, divided by the initial investment.

So, the formula is:

HPR = [Sum of Coupons + (Sale Price - Purchase Price)] / Purchase Price.

Wait, but that would give [24 + (82 - 104.1)] / 104.1.

Which is (24 -22.1)/104.1 → 1.9 / 104.1 ≈ 0.0182 or 1.82%. But the options don't have anything close to that except maybe option C (2%) or I (-2%).

Wait, but that can't be right because selling at 82 is a loss from 104.1. So maybe the HPR is negative.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Sum of coupons is 24.

Purchase price is 104.1.

Sale price is 82.

So, the total cash received is 24 (from coupons) + 82 (from sale) = 106.

Total investment was 104.1, so the total return is 106 - 104.1 = 1.9.

So HPR is 1.9 / 104.1 = approximately 0.0182 or 1.82%.

But 1.82% isn't one of the options. The closest option is C: 2%, but wait another thought: perhaps I should compute it as the sum of the coupons plus the sale price, then subtract the initial investment, and divide by initial investment. So (24 + 82 - 104.1) / 104.1 = (106 - 104.1)/104.1 = 1.9/104.1 ≈ 1.82%.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1.82. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the capital gain is just the sale price minus the face value? No, that doesn't make sense because the purchase price was 104.1.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total cash flows.

The initial outlay is 104.1. Then, each year you get 8, and at year 3, you get 8 + 82.

So the HPR is calculated as the sum of all cash received (including sale) divided by the initial investment, minus 1.

So, the total cash received over three years is 8 + 8 + (8 +82) = 8+8=16, 16+90=106.

So total cash received is 106. Initial investment was 104.1.

So HPR is (106 / 104.1) - 1 = (1.0182) - 1 = 0.0182 or 1.82%.

So that's about 1.8%, which is approximately 2%. So option C is 2%, so that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thought. HPR is the total return, which includes all cash flows. So perhaps the formula is:

HPR = (Sum of Cash Flows) / Initial Investment - 1.

But the sum of cash flows is:

At time 0: -104.1

At time 1: +8

At time 2: +8

At time 3: +8 +82 = +90

So the total cash flows are -104.1 +8 +8 +90 = (-104.1 + 106) = 1.9.

So HPR is 1.9 / 104.1 = 0.0182, which is 1.82%, approximately 2%, so option C.

But wait, I'm seeing that the options have other choices. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the HPR as (Total Cash Received - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment.

Total Cash Received: 24 (coupons) +82 (sale) = 106.

So 106 - 104.1 = 1.9.

1.9 / 104.1 = 0.0182 → 1.82%. So yes, that rounds to 2%, which is option C.

But wait, I'm looking at the options again. Option C is 2%, option I is -2%. So is my calculation correct?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the HPR formula. Maybe I'm missing something.

HPR is the total return, which is:

HPR = (Cash inflows + End value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment.

Wait, but in this case, the End value is 82, and Cash inflows are the coupons, 24.

So HPR = (24 +82 -104.1)/104.1 → (106 -104.1)/104.1 → 1.9/104.1 → ~1.82%.

So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me think about the timing. Because the coupons are received at the end of each year, and the bond is sold at the end of year 3. So all cash flows happen at the end of each respective year. So the initial investment is at time 0, and the rest are at times 1, 2, 3.

But for HPR, we're just looking at the total return over the three-year holding period, regardless of timing. So the total cash received is 106, initial investment is 104.1, so profit is 1.9, which is 1.82% of 104.1.

So the HPR is 1.82%, which is approximately 2%, so option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, I have to choose from A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:16%, B:23%, C:2%, D:0%, E:-21%, F:18%, G:10%, H:24%, I:-2%, J:-24%.

Yes, option C is 2%.

Wait, but wait another thought: when calculating HPR, do we consider the time value of money? Because the coupons are received over three years, but HPR is a simple return measure, not an annualized one. So I think HPR just sums up all the cash flows and divides by initial investment without considering the time value.

So I think my approach is correct. So the answer is C: 2%.
</think>

To calculate the holding period return (HPR) for the bond, we need to consider the total cash flows received over the three-year holding period and compare them to the initial investment. The bond details are as follows:

- **Initial purchase price**: $104.1  
- **Annual coupon payment**: $8 (8% of the face value of $100)  
- **Sale price at the end of year 3**: $82  

### Step 1: Calculate total cash flows
1. **Coupon payments**: Over three years, the bond pays $8 annually, so the total coupons received are:  
   \[
   3 \times 8 = \$24
   \]
2. **Sale of the bond**: At the end of year 3, the bond is sold for $82.  

   Total cash received from the investment is:  
   \[
   \$24 \, (\text{coupons}) + \$82 \, (\text{sale}) = \$106
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate HPR
The HPR is calculated as the total cash received minus the initial investment, divided by the initial investment:  
\[
\text{HPR} = \frac{\text{Total Cash Received} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}}
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{HPR} = \frac{\$106 - \$104.1}{\$104.1} = \frac{\$1.9}{\$104.1} \approx 0.0182 \, \text{or} \, 1.82\%
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated HPR is approximately 1.82%, which is closest to **2%** among the given options.

### Final Answer:
C: 2%
