Okay, so I've got this question here about the distance from Earth to the star Altair. Hmm. Let me see. The question says that the distance is one million times greater than the Earth-Sun distance. Right, so I need to figure out what one million times the Earth-Sun distance is.

Wait, what's the average distance from the Earth to the Sun? Oh right, I remember it's about 1.5 x 10^11 meters. Yeah, that's the astronomical unit, right? So if Altair is a million times farther away, I need to multiply that by a million.

Wait, a million is 10^6. So 1.5e11 meters times 1e6. Let me calculate that. 1.5e11 times 1e6 would be 1.5e17 meters. Wait, no, wait. Let me check that again. 1e11 times 1e6 is 1e17, right? So 1.5e11 * 1e6 = 1.5e17. Oh wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me look again.

The options are A to J. Let me check each option. Option J is 1.5e17 meters. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait a minute. Did I make a mistake here? Because the Earth-Sun distance is 1.5e11, so one million times that is 1.5e11 * 1e6 = 1.5e17 meters. So that's J.

Wait but looking at the options again. Let me list them:

A:9.3e10
B:1.5e14
C:1.5e13
D:9.3e17
E:9.3e14
F:1.5e10
G:9.3e16
H:9.3e13
I:1.5e16
J:1.5e17

Oh, yes, option J is 1.5e17. So that's the right answer. Wait, but wait again. Am I mixing up the exponents correctly? Because 1e6 times 1e11 is 1e17, correct. So 1.5e11 * 1e6 is 1.5e17. So the answer should be J.

But wait, sometimes people use different units. Oh wait, the question says "one million times greater than the distance between Earth and Sun." Oh, wait, one million times greater can sometimes be interpreted as 1e6 times more, so that's 1e6 multiplied by the original distance. So yes, same as before.

Alternatively, if someone mistakenly thought a million is 1e9, which would be a billion, but no, in this case, it's correct.

So the calculation is correct. The answer is J.
</think>

The distance between the Earth and the Sun is approximately \(1.5 \times 10^{11}\) meters. Since Altair is one million times farther away, we calculate this distance by multiplying \(1.5 \times 10^{11}\) by \(10^6\) (one million). 

\[
1.5 \times 10^{11} \times 10^6 = 1.5 \times 10^{17} \text{ meters}.
\]

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: \(1.5 \times 10^{17}\) meters.**

Answer: J
