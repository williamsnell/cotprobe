Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Rawls and why he argues that parties in the original position would reject utilitarianism. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Rawls' theory involves the original position, where parties are behind a veil of ignorance. They don't know their place in society, their race, gender, social status, etc. The idea is to ensure fairness because they have to design principles that would be good for everyone, not knowing where they'll end up.

Now, utilitarianism is the theory that actions are right if they maximize overall happiness or utility. There are different types, like act and rule utilitarianism, but I think the question is more about the general idea.

So, why would the parties in the original position not accept utilitarianism? I think it has to do with risk and fairness. Behind the veil, they don't know their situation, so they have to choose principles that protect the worst-off members. Rawls argues for the maximin principle, which is about maximizing the minimum level of well-being.

Utilitarianism could allow for situations where the majority's happiness is increased at the expense of a minority. For example, imagine a policy that makes 90% of people much happier but makes 10% significantly worse off. A utilitarian might support this if the overall utility is higher. But in the original position, parties wouldn't want to risk being in that 10% who suffer for the greater good. They would prefer a system that ensures their basic rights and protections, even if it means slightly less overall happiness.

Looking at the options, option B says "doing so would be too risky." That makes sense because the parties are risk-averse in the original position. They don't know their position, so they avoid systems that could lead them to be in a disadvantaged group.

Option C mentions executing innocent people, which seems like a more extreme example. While utilitarianism can lead to such conclusions in certain scenarios (like the trolley problem or punishing an innocent person to prevent a riot), I'm not sure if that's the main reason Rawls gives. I think it's more about the general risk of being in the worse-off position rather than specific injustices.

Option A talks about difficulty in determining policies. While that might be a practical issue, I don't think Rawls makes that the main argument against utilitarianism. The original position is more about the ethical choice rather than the practical challenges.

Option D suggests they've never heard of utilitarianism because of the veil. But that doesn't make sense because the veil of ignorance is about not knowing personal characteristics, not about knowledge of ethical theories. They would know about different theories; they just don't know where they'd stand in society.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be B: doing so would be too risky. Because the parties in the original position are making decisions without knowing their place, they would find utilitarianism's potential to sacrifice some for the greater good too risky, opting instead for principles that provide more assured protections.

The correct answer is B: doing so would be too risky. Rawls argues that parties in the original position, behind the veil of ignorance, would reject utilitarianism because it could lead to situations where the well-being of some individuals, especially the worst-off, is sacrificed for the greater good. This risk is unacceptable under the maximin principle, which prioritizes protecting the least advantaged. 

Answer: B
