Question:

Biologists around the world have increased efforts at conservation. Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?

Options:

A: The correlation coefficient is -0.57.
B: The correlation coefficient is -0.84.
C: The correlation coefficient is 0.57.
D: The correlation coefficient is 0.71.
E: The correlation coefficient is 0.84.
F: The correlation coefficient is 0.29.
G: The correlation coefficient is -1.00.
H: The correlation coefficient is 1.00.
I: The correlation coefficient is -0.29.
J: The correlation coefficient is -0.71.

Okay, so I've got this question about correlation coefficients and their interpretation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says that biologists are monitoring terns by their calls. They found that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the number of nests. I remember that in statistics, when we talk about the correlation coefficient, it's related to the coefficient of determination, right?

Wait, the coefficient of determination is r squared, and it tells us the proportion of variance explained by the variables. So if the number of calls explains 71% of the variation, that means r squared is 0.71. But wait, r squared is the square of the correlation coefficient, r.

So r squared equals 0.71, which means r is the square root of 0.71. Oh wait, square root of 0.71 is approximately 0.843, right? Because 0.84 squared is about 0.7056, so 0.84 squared is roughly 0.71.

But wait, the square root could be positive or negative. However, in this context, the number of calls and the number of nests would be positively correlated. More calls mean more nests, right? So the correlation coefficient should be positive.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.84, and option D is 0.71. Wait, no, D is 0.71, which would be the square root of 0.5 approximately, since 0.71^2 is about 0.5. No, wait, 0.71 squared is 0.5041, which is about half, so that's not it.

Wait, the r squared is 0.71, so r is sqrt(0.71) ≈ 0.843, which is about 0.84. So the correlation coefficient is 0.84.

Now, checking the options:

A: -0.57 → No, positive.

B: -0.84 → No, same reason.

C: 0.57 → That would be r squared of 0.3249, which doesn't match.

D: 0.71 → r squared would be 0.5, no.

E: 0.84 → Yes, because 0.84^2 is 0.7056, which is about 0.71.

F: 0.29 → Too low.

G and H: ±1.00, that's perfect correlation, which isn't the case here.

I and J: Negative, so no.

So the correct answer should be E: 0.84.

The question involves interpreting the relationship between the number of calls made by terns and the abundance of their nests. It is stated that the number of calls explains 71% of the variation in nest abundance, which corresponds to a coefficient of determination (r²) of 0.71. The correlation coefficient (r) is the square root of r², so r = √0.71 ≈ 0.84. Since the relationship is positive (more calls correlate with more nests), the correlation coefficient must be positive.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, I, J**: These are negative values, which are incorrect because the relationship is positive.
- **C, F**: These values (0.57 and 0.29) are too low and inconsistent with r² = 0.71.
- **D**: 0.71 would imply r² ≈ 0.50, which is incorrect.
- **E**: 0.84 is correct because 0.84² ≈ 0.71, matching the given data.
- **G, H**: These represent perfect correlations (±1.00), which are not supported by the data.

Thus, the correct correlation coefficient is **0.84**.
