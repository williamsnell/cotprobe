Question:

The lowest point on Earth is the bottom of the Mariana Trench at a depth of 35,840 feet below sea level. The highest point on Earth is the summit of Mt. Everest at a height of 29,028 feet above sea level. Which of the following is the best estimate of the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth?

Options:

A: 75,000 feet
B: 65,000 feet
C: 55,000 feet
D: 60,000 feet
E: 7,000 feet
F: 64,000 feet
G: 70,000 feet
H: 50,000 feet
I: 6,000 feet
J: 80,000 feet

Okay, so I have this problem here about the highest and lowest points on Earth and I need to figure out the distance between them. Hmm, let me think. The question says the lowest point is the Mariana Trench at 35,840 feet below sea level, and the highest is Mount Everest at 29,028 feet above sea level. I guess I need to add these two depths together to get the total distance from the lowest to the highest point.

Wait, so if the trench is 35,840 feet below sea level and Everest is 29,028 above, adding them should give the total distance between the two points because one is below and the other is above. Let me do the addition. 35,840 plus 29,028... Let me add the thousands first. 35,000 plus 29,000 is 64,000. Then the remaining 840 plus 28 is 868. So the total would be 64,868 feet.

Now, looking at the options, I see option F is 64,000 feet. That's pretty close to my calculation. But wait, let me double-check. Did I add correctly? 35,840 + 29,028. Let's see: 35,840 plus 20,000 is 55,840. Then add 9,028. 55,840 +9,000 is 64,840, plus 28 makes 64,868. Yep, that's correct. So the exact value is 64,868, which is approximately 65,000. But let me look at the options again.

The options are A:75k, B:65k, C:55k, D:60k, E:7k, F:64k, G:70k, H:50k, I:6k, J:80k. So F is 64k, which is very close. But option B is 65k. Hmm, which one is a better estimate? Since 64,868 is closer to 65k than 64k? Wait, 64,868 is 64,000 plus 868, which is 0.868 of a thousand. So 64.868 thousand. So when rounding to the nearest thousand, 64.868 would round to 65, because 0.868 is more than 0.5. So the estimate would be approximately 65,000 feet.

Wait, but in the options, F is 64,000 and B is 65,000. So the better estimate is 65k. But wait, the question says "the best estimate". So perhaps the intended answer is the sum, which is about 65k, so option B.

Wait, but in the options, F is 64,000 which is only 868 less than the exact figure. But when estimating, 65,000 is a closer rounded number. So I think the answer should be B:65,000.

Wait another thought: the Earth is a sphere, so the distance between two points on its surface isn't just a straight line through the Earth, but rather along the surface. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the question isn't about the straight-line distance through the Earth. It's about the distance between the two points on the Earth's surface. Wait, no, no, wait a second. No, the question is about the vertical distance from the lowest point to the highest point. Because the Mariana Trench is the lowest, and Everest is the highest. So the total vertical distance is the sum of their depths. So the distance isn't along the Earth's surface but the total from the lowest to highest point, which is what I calculated.

So yeah, the answer should be approximately 65,000 feet, which is option B.

To determine the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth, we add the depth of the Mariana Trench (35,840 feet below sea level) to the height of Mount Everest (29,028 feet above sea level). 

Performing the addition:
\[
35,840 + 29,028 = 64,868 \, \text{feet}.
\]

This value is approximately 65,000 feet when rounded to the nearest thousand. Among the given options, the closest match is **65,000 feet**.

The best estimate of the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth is:

**B: 65,000 feet.**
