Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 10236 and 244 using the Euclidean algorithm. Hmm, I remember the Euclidean algorithm is a method to find the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying division and taking remainders. Let me try to recall how it works.

So the Euclidean algorithm works like this: you take the larger number and divide it by the smaller one. Then, you take the remainder from that division and repeat the process, replacing the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller with the remainder. You keep doing this until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the gcd.

Alright, let's apply this to the numbers 10236 and 244. First, I'll set a as 10236 and b as 244 since a is larger than b.

Step 1: Divide 10236 by 244. I need to find how many times 244 fits into 10236 and what the remainder is. Let me calculate 244 times 41 because 244*40 is 9760, and adding another 244 gives 10004. Wait, 244 * 41 is 10004? Let me check: 244*40 is 9760, plus 244 is 10004. But wait, 10004 is less than 10236. So 10236 minus 10004 is 232. So the remainder is 232. 

So now, according to the Euclidean algorithm, the next step is to find gcd(244, 232).

Step 2: Now a is 244 and b is 232. Divide 244 by 232. 232 goes into 244 once with a remainder. 244 - 232 = 12. So the remainder is 12. Now, we find gcd(232, 12).

Step 3: a is 232 and b is 12. Divide 232 by 12. Let's see, 12 * 19 is 228. 232 -228 is 4. So the remainder is 4. Now, compute gcd(12,4).

Step 4: a is 12, b is 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3 with no remainder (since 4*3=12). The remainder is 0. So the algorithm stops here, and the last non-zero remainder is 4.

Wait, that would mean the gcd is 4. Let me check the options given. The options are A through J. Looking at the options, option C is 4. So the answer should be C.

But wait, did I make any mistakes in my calculations? Let me double-check each step.

First step: 10236 divided by 244. Let me compute 244*41. Let's compute 244*40=9760, plus 244 is 10004. 10236-10004 is 232. Correct.

Second step: 244 divided by 232. 232*1=232. 244-232=12. Correct.

Third step: 232 divided by 12. 12*19=228, 232-228=4. Correct.

Fourth step: 12 divided by 4 is 3, remainder 0. So yes, the gcd is 4. So the correct answer is C.

To find the gcd of 10236 and 244 using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. **Step 1**: Divide 10236 by 244.  
   - 244 × 41 = 10004  
   - Remainder = 10236 - 10004 = 232  
   - Now find gcd(244, 232).

2. **Step 2**: Divide 244 by 232.  
   - 232 × 1 = 232  
   - Remainder = 244 - 232 = 12  
   - Now find gcd(232, 12).

3. **Step 3**: Divide 232 by 12.  
   - 12 × 19 = 228  
   - Remainder = 232 - 228 = 4  
   - Now find gcd(12, 4).

4. **Step 4**: Divide 12 by 4.  
   - 4 × 3 = 12  
   - Remainder = 0  
   - The last non-zero remainder is 4, so gcd(10236, 244) = 4.

From the options, the correct answer is **C: 4**.
