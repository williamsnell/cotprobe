Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Suppose all the electrons in a gram of copper could be moved to a position 30 cm away from the copper nuclei. What would be the force of attraction between these two groups of particles? The options are A through J, with various units like dyne and stateC.

Hmm, right. So I think I need to calculate the electrostatic force between the electrons and the nuclei. Since opposite charges attract, the electrons would be attracted to the nuclei.

Wait, but wait. Copper's atomic structure—each copper atom has a certain number of electrons, right? I remember that copper has an atomic number of 29, so each atom has 29 electrons. But wait, actually, in neutral copper atoms, each has 29 electrons. So if all the electrons are moved away, each nucleus would be positively charged by +29e, where e is the elementary charge.

So, first, I think I need to find the total charge of the electrons and the nuclei.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the number of moles in 1 gram of copper.
2. Determine the number of atoms in that.
3. Calculate the total charge of the electrons and the nuclei.
4. Use Coulomb's Law to find the force between them.

Coulomb's Law is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

So let's start step by step.

Step 1: Moles of copper. The molar mass of copper is about 63.55 g/mol. So 1 gram would be 1/63.55 moles.

Calculating that: 1 / 63.55 ≈ 0.01574 moles.

Step 2: Number of atoms. Moles multiplied by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 atoms/mol).

So atoms = 0.01574 mol * 6.022e23 ≈ 9.48e21 atoms.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.01574 * 6.022e23 = ?

0.01574 * 6.022 = approximately 0.0948. So 0.0948e23 = 9.48e21 atoms.

Each atom contributes 29 electrons, so total electrons is 29 * 9.48e21 = let's calculate that.

29 * 9.48e21 = (30 -1)*9.48e21 = 284.4e21 - 9.48e21 = 274.92e21 = 2.7492e23 electrons.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, 29 * 9.48e21. Let me compute 9.48e21 * 29.

9.48e21 *30 is 284.4e21, subtract 9.48e21 gives 274.92e21, which is 2.7492e23 electrons.

Each electron has a charge of -e, where e is 1.602e-19 C. So the total charge for the electrons is Q_e = (2.7492e23) * (-1.602e-19) C.

Calculating that: 2.7492e23 * 1.602e-19 = let's see. 2.7492 *1.602 ≈ 4.407, and the exponent is 10^(23-19) = 10^4. So 4.407e4 C. But since it's electrons, the charge is negative, so about -4.407e4 C.

But wait, the nuclei would have the opposite charge. So each nucleus has lost 29 electrons, so the charge per nucleus is +29e. So the total nuclear charge Q_n = 29e * number of atoms.

Wait, number of atoms is 9.48e21, so 29 * 9.48e21 * e.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the total number of electrons as 2.749e23, which is 29 * 9.48e21. So the total charge of the nuclei would be + (29 * 9.48e21) * e = same as the electrons' charge but positive. So the total nuclear charge is +4.407e4 C.

Wait, but wait. So the electrons would be at -4.407e4 C, and the nuclei at +4.407e4 C. So the magnitude of each charge is the same.

Now, the distance between them is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters.

So applying Coulomb's Law: F = k * |q1*q2| / r².

Since both charges are same in magnitude, it's (4.407e4)^2 multiplied by k, divided by (0.3)^2.

Let me compute that.

First, let me compute (4.407e4)^2.

(4.407)^2 is about 19.43, and (1e4)^2 is 1e8. So 19.43e8 C².

Wait, wait, 4.407e4 is 44070 C? No wait, 4.407e4 is 4.407 * 1e4 = 44070 C?

Wait no, 1e4 is 10,000. So 4.407 * 1e4 is 44,070 Coulombs, yes.

So (4.407e4)^2 is 4.407² * 1e8.

4.407 squared is approximately 19.43, so 19.43e8 = 1.943e9 C².

Now, Coulomb's constant k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So F = (8.988e9) * (1.943e9) / (0.3)^2.

Compute denominator: 0.3^2 = 0.09 = 9e-2.

So F = (8.988e9 * 1.943e9) / 9e-2.

Multiply the numerator:

8.988e9 * 1.943e9 = (8.988 * 1.943) * 1e18.

Compute 8.988 * 1.943. Let's see: 8 * 1.943 is about 15.544, and 0.988 * 1.943 is about 1.920. So total approximately 17.464. So 17.464e18.

Wait, more accurately:

Let me compute 8.988 * 1.943:

8 * 1.943 = 15.544

0.988 * 1.943: Let's compute 1 * 1.943 = 1.943, minus 0.012 *1.943=0.023316. So 1.943 - 0.023316 = 1.919684.

So total 15.544 + 1.919684 = 17.463684.

So 17.463684e18.

So F = (17.463684e18) / (9e-2) = (17.463684 /9 )e18 / 1e-2.

Wait, 17.463684 /9 is approximately 1.94085.

So 1.94085e18 / 1e-2 = 1.94085e20.

Wait, because when you divide by 9e-2, it's the same as multiplying by 100/9. So 17.463684e18 * (100/9) = (17.463684 *100/9 )e18.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 17.463684e18 / 0.09.

Because 9e-2 is 0.09.

17.463684e18 / 0.09 = (17.463684 /0.09) * 1e18.

17.463684 / 0.09 = approximately 194.0827.

So 194.0827e18 = 1.940827e20 N.

Wait, but wait, that would be in Newtons. But the options are in dyne. Oh, right, because 1 N = 1e5 dyne.

So converting Newtons to dyne, multiply by 1e5.

So 1.940827e20 N * 1e5 dyne/N = 1.940827e25 dyne.

Looking at the options, let me see.

Options:

A: 4.2 ×10^21 dyne

B: 7.0 ×10^13 stateC

C:63.5 g / mole

D:1.2 ×10^26 dyne

E:1.9 ×10^25 dyne

H:8.8 ×10^24 dyne

I:3.6 ×10^22 dyne

J:2.7 ×10^23 dyne

So the value I got is approximately 1.94e25 dyne, which is closest to option E:1.9e25 dyne.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistake in the calculation steps?

Let me double-check.

Number of moles: 1g /63.55 g/mol ≈ 0.01574 mol.

Number of atoms: 0.01574 * 6.022e23 ≈ 9.48e21 atoms.

Each has 29 electrons: 9.48e21 *29 = 2.749e23 electrons.

Charge of electrons: 2.749e23 * 1.602e-19 C ≈ 4.407e4 C.

Nuclear charge same magnitude, 4.407e4 C.

Distance r=0.3 m.

Coulomb force: F = k*(4.407e4)^2 / (0.3)^2.

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

Calculate numerator: 8.988e9 * (4.407e4)^2.

Wait, (4.407e4)^2 is 4.407^2 *1e8.

4.407 squared is approximately 19.43, so 19.43e8.

So 8.988e9 * 19.43e8 = 8.988 *19.43 = let's compute that.

8 *19.43 is 155.44, 0.988 *19.43≈19.20. So total about 174.64.

So 174.64e17 (since 1e9 *1e8=1e17) → 1.7464e19.

Wait wait, no, wait. 8.988e9 * 19.43e8 = (8.988 *19.43) *1e17.

Because 1e9 *1e8 =1e17.

So 8.988 *19.43 ≈ 174.64, so 174.64e17.

Wait, 174.64e17 is 1.7464e19.

Denominator: (0.3)^2=0.09=9e-2.

So F = (1.7464e19) / (9e-2) = (1.7464 /0.09 )e19.

1.7464 /0.09 = 19.4 (since 0.09 *19.4=1.746).

So 19.4e19 = 1.94e20 N.

Convert to dyne: 1.94e20 N *1e5 dyne/N = 1.94e25 dyne.

Yes, so that's consistent. So option E is 1.9e25 dyne. So the answer must be E.

Wait, but let me check if I considered the correct number of electrons per atom. Copper has an atomic number of 29, so in a neutral atom, 29 electrons. So when all electrons are removed, each nucleus has +29e charge. So yes, that's correct.

Also, the calculation steps seem correct. So I think the correct answer is E.

To calculate the force of attraction between the electrons and nuclei in this scenario, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the number of moles of copper**:  
   The molar mass of copper is approximately \(63.55 \, \text{g/mol}\). Therefore, the number of moles in 1 gram of copper is:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of copper} = \frac{1}{63.55} \approx 0.01574 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of copper atoms**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol}\)), the number of atoms is:  
   \[
   \text{Number of atoms} = 0.01574 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 9.48 \times 10^{21} \, \text{atoms}.
   \]

3. **Determine the total charge of the electrons**:  
   Each copper atom has 29 electrons, so the total number of electrons is:  
   \[
   \text{Total electrons} = 29 \times 9.48 \times 10^{21} \approx 2.749 \times 10^{23} \, \text{electrons}.
   \]  
   The charge of a single electron is \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\), so the total charge of the electrons is:  
   \[
   Q_e = 2.749 \times 10^{23} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \approx -4.407 \times 10^{4} \, \text{C}.
   \]

4. **Determine the total charge of the nuclei**:  
   Each nucleus has a charge of \(+29e\), so the total charge of the nuclei is:  
   \[
   Q_n = +4.407 \times 10^{4} \, \text{C}.
   \]

5. **Apply Coulomb's Law**:  
   Coulomb's Law is given by:  
   \[
   F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2},
   \]  
   where \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\), \(q_1 = Q_e = 4.407 \times 10^4 \, \text{C}\), \(q_2 = Q_n = 4.407 \times 10^4 \, \text{C}\), and \(r = 0.3 \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   F = 8.988 \times 10^9 \times \frac{(4.407 \times 10^4)^2}{(0.3)^2}.
   \]  
   First, calculate \((4.407 \times 10^4)^2\):  
   \[
   (4.407 \times 10^4)^2 = 19.43 \times 10^8 = 1.943 \times 10^9 \, \text{C}^2.
   \]  
   Then, calculate the denominator:  
   \[
   (0.3)^2 = 0.09 = 9 \times 10^{-2}.
   \]  
   Now, calculate the force:  
   \[
   F = 8.988 \times 10^9 \times \frac{1.943 \times 10^9}{9 \times 10^{-2}} = 8.988 \times 10^9 \times 2.159 \times 10^{10} \approx 1.94 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N}.
   \]  
   Convert to dyne (\(1 \, \text{N} = 10^5 \, \text{dyne}\)):  
   \[
   F = 1.94 \times 10^{20} \times 10^5 = 1.94 \times 10^{25} \, \text{dyne}.
   \]

6. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest match to \(1.94 \times 10^{25} \, \text{dyne}\) is option **E: \(1.9 \times 10^{25} \, \text{dyne}\)**.

ANSWER: E
