B: it leads us to believe that torture is always permissible.
C: all artificial thought experiments are philosophically useless.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Marcia Baron's argument regarding ticking bomb cases. I remember that ticking bomb scenarios are often used in debates about torture, where the idea is that if you have a bomb about to go off and the only way to save lives is to torture someone for information, is it permissible?

So the question is asking why Marcia Baron thinks the artificiality of these cases is problematic. The options are A, B, and C. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details of her argument, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I recall that philosophers use thought experiments to test intuitions and explore the boundaries of moral theories. Ticking bomb cases are a classic example. But critics argue that these scenarios are unrealistic and don't accurately reflect real-world situations. 

Marcia Baron, if I remember correctly, critiques these scenarios not because they're artificial per se, but because they make certain assumptions that might not hold up. She might argue that these cases rest on empirical claims that aren't necessarily true. For example, the assumption that torture will quickly yield accurate information is an empirical claim. If that's not the case, then the entire scenario's usefulness in the debate is undermined.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the artificial assumptions are empirical claims central to the debate. That sounds like what I was thinking. Baron might be saying that these scenarios make assumptions that are presented as fact, which they aren't, and these are crucial for the argument.

Option B suggests the artificiality leads us to believe torture is always permissible. I don't think that's her point. The ticking bomb case is often used to argue that torture could be permissible in extreme cases, but Baron's critique is more about the setup, not the conclusion.

Option C claims all artificial thought experiments are useless, which seems too broad. I don't think she's against all thought experiments, just the ones that rely on flawed assumptions.

So putting it together, the answer should be A because she's pointing out that the assumptions in the scenario are empirical claims that are central to the debate, and their artificiality makes them problematic because they might not be true.

The artificiality of ticking bomb cases is problematic, according to Marcia Baron, because the scenarios rely on assumptions that are presented as empirical claims central to the debate. These assumptions, such as the effectiveness of torture in yielding accurate information quickly, may not hold true in reality, thereby undermining the validity of the argument.

Answer: A
