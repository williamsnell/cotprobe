Question:

Long was a purchasing agent for Frost, a sole proprietor. Long had express authority to place purchase orders with Frost's suppliers. Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?

Options:

A: No, because Grant should have verified Frost's competency.
B: No, because the law protects those declared incompetent from contractual obligations.
C: Yes, because the contract was conducted online.
D: No, because Grant dealt only with Long.
E: Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.
F: No, because Frost's incompetence voided the agency relationship.
G: No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.
H: Yes, because Long had express authority to place orders.
I: Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.
J: Yes, because the order was placed before Frost was declared incompetent.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about agency law and whether Frost or their legal representative is liable to Grant after a purchase order was placed. Let me break it down.

So, Long was a purchasing agent for Frost, who's a sole proprietor. Long had express authority to place purchase orders. That's clear. Now, Long did business on the Internet and didn't have much contact with Frost. Then, after Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. Both Long and Grant didn't know about Frost's incompetence.

The question is: Is Frost or their representative liable to Grant?

Hmm. I remember that when a principal is incompetent, it affects the agent's authority. But wait, there's a concept called the "protection of bona fide purchasers" or something like that. So, if the agent is acting within their authority and the third party (like Grant) doesn't know about the principal's incompetence, the principal might still be bound.

Wait, but doesn't the agent's authority continue unless it's revoked? So, if the principal becomes incompetent, does that automatically revoke the agent's authority? Or does it depend on whether the third party knew about it?

I think when a principal is adjudicated incompetent, the agent's authority is suspended, but only if the agent or the third party knows about it. If neither knows, then the agent can still bind the principal. Because the agent's authority continues until the agent or the third party has notice.

So in this case, Long didn't know, and Grant didn't know. So Long still had authority to act on behalf of Frost. Therefore, the contract would be binding, and Frost would be liable.

Looking at the options:

Option E says "Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence." That sounds right because the order was placed without knowledge of the incompetence.

Option H says "Yes, because Long had express authority to place orders." Also a possible choice, but maybe E is more precise because it's about the validity regardless of incompetence.

Option I says "Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence." Hmm, but I thought the agency doesn't survive if the principal is incompetent, unless the agent and third party are unaware.

Wait, but upon incompetence, the agent's authority is suspended, but only if the agent or third party knows. If they don't know, the authority continues. So Frost's incompetence doesn't automatically terminate the agency; it's the knowledge that matters.

So since neither knew, the contract is valid, so Frost is liable. So the correct answer would be either E or H or I.

Wait, another thought. When the principal becomes incompetent, their ability to enter into contracts is limited, but for existing agents, the authority might continue unless revoked. But if the principal is incompetent, can they even have an agent? Or does the agent's authority end automatically?

Wait, no, the agent's authority can continue unless the third party knows about the principal's incompetence. So as long as Grant and Long didn't know, the authority is still there, so the contract is valid.

So looking at the options again:

Option E: Yes, the order was valid regardless. That seems to fit.

Option H: Yes, because Long had express authority. Well, he did, but what about the incompetence? So maybe E is better because it directly addresses the issue.

So I think the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around agency law and whether Frost or their legal representative is liable to Grant after Long, Frost's purchasing agent, placed an order without knowing about Frost's incompetence. Long had express authority to place orders, and both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's judicially declared incompetence. 

Under agency law, when a principal is declared incompetent, the agent's authority is suspended only if the agent or the third party has knowledge of the incompetence. If neither is aware, the agent can still bind the principal. Here, since neither Long nor Grant knew about Frost's incompetence, Long's authority to act on Frost's behalf remained valid. As a result, the contract with Grant is binding, and Frost or their legal representative is liable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E**: Correct. The order was valid because the contract was entered into without knowledge of Frost's incompetence, maintaining its enforceability.
- **Option H**: While Long had express authority, this option does not address the key issue of Frost's incompetence and its impact on the contract.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The agency relationship does not automatically survive incompetence; it depends on the knowledge of the parties involved.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as it directly addresses the validity of the contract despite Frost's incompetence.

Answer: E
