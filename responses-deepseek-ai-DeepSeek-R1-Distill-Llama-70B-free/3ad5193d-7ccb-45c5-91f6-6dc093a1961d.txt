Okay, so I've got this marketing research question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: A marketing research firm contracts with clients to conduct a complete marketing research project from data collection, analysis, and reporting. It is a__________ firm. And then there are options from A to J.

Alright, so the key here is understanding what each type of firm does. The question is about a firm that handles the entire projectâ€”data collection, analysis, and reporting. So I need to determine which term describes such a firm.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Data collection firm. Well, that sounds like they only handle collecting data, not the whole project. So probably not this one.

Option B: Freelance agency. Freelance usually refers to individuals working on their own or small groups, not necessarily handling all parts of the project. Plus, the term 'agency' might be part of it, but I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

Option C: Data analysis firm. Again, this seems to focus only on the analysis part, not the whole project.

Option D: Survey firm. Surveys are a method of data collection, so this firm would likely only handle that part, not the analysis or reporting.

Option E: Full-service agency. Hmm, 'full-service' suggests they handle everything from start to finish. That sounds like the complete project they're describing here. So this could be the right answer.

Option F: Tabulation agency. Tabulation is part of data analysis, specifically organizing data, so again, not the whole project.

Option G: Marketing agency. Marketing agencies typically handle advertising, promotions, etc., not necessarily all aspects of research. Though some might, but the term isn't specific to handling the entire research process.

Option H: Research firm. Well, a research firm might conduct studies, but does that include all three steps (data collection, analysis, reporting)? It's possible, but I'm not sure if it's the most precise term.

Option I: Consultant. Consultants usually provide expert advice. They might not handle data collection or reporting, just the analysis or strategy.

Option J: Field agency. Field agencies are involved in data collection, especially primary data through surveys, interviews, etc. So again, only part of the process.

So putting it all together, the firm in question does everything: data collection, analysis, and reporting. The term that best fits is 'full-service agency' because they offer all these services. So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: Full-service agency. 

The firm described handles the entire marketing research project, including data collection, analysis, and reporting, which aligns with the definition of a full-service agency.

Answer: E
