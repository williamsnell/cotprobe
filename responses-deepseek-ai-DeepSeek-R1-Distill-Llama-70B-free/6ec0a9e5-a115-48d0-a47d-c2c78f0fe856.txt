Okay, so I've got this problem about Shepp's Store buying camping hotplates. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on accounting terms, but I'll try to remember.

The problem says that on December 10, Shepp's Store bought the hotplates for $56.65, but there's a trade discount of 10%. Oh right, a trade discount is like a reduction in the price for bulk buying or something, so I need to calculate that first.

So the original price is $56.65, and the discount is 10%. To find the discounted price, I subtract 10% of 56.65 from the original. Let me calculate that. 10% of 56.65 is 5.665, so subtracting that from 56.65 gives me 50.985. Wait, but I think we usually round to two decimal places for money, so that would be $50.99.

Wait, but that might not be the final step. The terms are given as (2/10), (n/30). I remember that terms like this are about payment discounts. The first part is 2/10, which I think means 2% discount if paid within 10 days. The second part, n/30, probably means net 30 days, meaning the total is due in 30 days otherwise.

So Shepp's Store paid the bill on December 20. Let me check how many days that is from December 10. December has 31 days, so the 10th to the 20th is 10 days. Oh, that's within the 10-day window for the 2% discount.

So the initial amount after the trade discount is $50.99. Now, because they paid within 10 days, they get an additional 2% discount. So I need to calculate 2% of 50.99 and subtract that from 50.99.

Calculating 2% of 50.99: 0.02 * 50.99 = 1.0198. Subtracting that gives 50.99 - 1.0198 = 49.9702. Again, rounding to two decimals, that's $49.97.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So the steps are: 

1. Apply trade discount: 56.65 * (1 - 0.10) = 50.985 -> $50.99.
2. Then apply the 2% payment discount because they paid within 10 days: 50.99 * (1 - 0.02) = 50.99 * 0.98 = ?

Let me compute 50.99 * 0.98. Hmm, 50.99 * 0.98 is the same as 50.99 - (50.99 * 0.02). Which is 50.99 - 1.0198 = 49.9702, so $49.97.

Looking at the options, option B is $49.97. That should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I mix up the order of discounts. Oh, right, the trade discount comes first, reducing the invoice amount, and then the payment discount is applied on the reduced amount. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I compute step by step:

Trade discount: $56.65 * 10% = $5.665 discount. So 56.65 - 5.665 = $50.985 â†’ $50.99.

Then 2% of that for payment within 10 days: 50.99 * 2% = $1.0198 discount. Subtracting that gives 50.99 - 1.0198 = $49.9702, which is $49.97.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the amount Shepp's Store paid, we start by calculating the price after applying the trade discount. The original price is $56.65, and the trade discount is 10%. 

1. **Trade Discount Calculation**:  
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 56.65 \times 0.10 = 5.665  
   \]  
   Subtracting this from the original price:  
   \[
   56.65 - 5.665 = 50.985 \quad \text{(rounded to \$50.99)}  
   \]

2. **Payment Discount Calculation**:  
   The terms (2/10), (n/30) indicate a 2% discount if payment is made within 10 days. Since Shepp's Store paid on December 20 (10 days after December 10), they qualify for this discount. Applying the 2% discount to the discounted price:  
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 50.99 \times 0.02 = 1.0198  
   \]  
   Subtracting this from the discounted price:  
   \[
   50.99 - 1.0198 = 49.9702 \quad \text{(rounded to \$49.97)}  
   \]

Thus, the amount paid by Shepp's Store is **$49.97**.

**Answer: B**
