Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about CPA firms' quality control systems. Hmm, I remember from my studies that quality control is a big deal for accounting firms to ensure they meet professional standards. The question is asking which activity is NOT part of the quality control system when establishing policies and procedures.

Let me look at the options. 

Option A: Deciding whether to accept or continue a client relationship. I think this is part of quality control because firms need to assess if they can serve the client appropriately and if there are any independence issues or other risks. So A is probably part of the system, meaning it's not the correct answer.

Option B: Selecting personnel for advancement who have the necessary qualifications. This sounds like it's about staffing and making sure the right people move up. I'm pretty sure that's part of quality control since having qualified personnel is crucial for maintaining standards. So B is part of it, not the answer we're looking for.

Option C: Assessing a client's ability to establish effective internal controls. Wait, isn't that more of an audit procedure? I mean, when a CPA firm is auditing a client, they assess internal controls as part of the audit process. But is that part of the firm's quality control policies? Or is that a separate procedure during engagements? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Maybe it's part of the firm's policies on client acceptance or engagement processes, but perhaps it's more of an audit step rather than a quality control element for the firm's overall system.

Option D: Monitoring the effectiveness of professional development activities. Oh right, quality control includes ongoing training and making sure the staff are up-to-date. Monitoring if those training efforts are working would definitely be part of the system. So D is part of it.

So the question is which one is NOT part of the quality control system. I think C might be the answer because assessing internal controls is something done during an audit, not as part of the firm's overall quality control policies. The quality control system would include things like client acceptance (A), personnel management (B), and training (D), but not the specific client internal control assessments which are part of the engagement process.

The correct answer is C. 

In a CPA firm's quality control system, activities like accepting clients (A), advancing qualified personnel (B), and monitoring professional development (D) are all integral parts of ensuring the firm meets professional standards. However, assessing a client's internal controls (C) is a specific procedure conducted during an audit engagement, not a component of the overall quality control system.

Answer: C
