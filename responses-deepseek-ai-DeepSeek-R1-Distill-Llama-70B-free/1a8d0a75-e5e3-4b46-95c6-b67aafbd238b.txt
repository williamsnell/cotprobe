Okay, so I've got this problem about E. coli DNA and I need to calculate the total length of the DNA molecule and compare it to the length of the E. coli cell. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says that the DNA has about 4.5 million mononucleotide units. Wait, each mononucleotide is like a single unit, right? And each of these is spaced about 3.4 Å apart. So the total length should be the number of units multiplied by the spacing between each, I think. 

Wait, but wait a second, DNA is a double helix, right? So each nucleotide in the DNA is part of a base pair. So does that affect the calculation? Like, each base pair contributes a certain length. Oh, right, I remember that the distance between two base pairs in DNA is about 3.4 Å. So each base pair is 3.4 Å in length. So each mononucleotide unit, since it's a single nucleotide but part of a pair, but the spacing is per base pair. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question says each mononucleotide is spaced about 3.4 Å apart. So maybe each mononucleotide contributes 3.4 Å to the length. Or perhaps each base pair. Hmm, but wait, the number of mononucleotide units is 4.5 million. So if each is spaced 3.4 Å apart, then the total length would be 4.5e6 * 3.4 Å. That makes sense.

But wait, wait, let me double-check. In DNA, each base pair is 3.4 Å in the double helix structure. So for a single base pair, you have two nucleotides (one from each strand) making up the pair. So each base pair is 3.4 Å. So if I have N base pairs, the length is N * 3.4 Å.

But the question says the DNA has 4.5 million mononucleotide units. Since each base pair has two nucleotides, the number of base pairs would be half of that. Wait, no, wait. Wait no, wait. Each DNA strand has a certain number of nucleotides, but a base pair is two nucleotides (one from each strand) paired together. So for a DNA molecule with M base pairs, each strand has M nucleotides. So the total number of nucleotides is 2M. 

Oh wait, in this case, the problem states that the DNA contains about 4.5 million mononucleotide units. So that's the total number, so that would be both strands. So the number of base pairs is 4.5e6 / 2 = 2.25e6 base pairs.

So then each base pair contributes 3.4 Å. So the total length would be 2.25e6 * 3.4 Å.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The problem states that the mononucleotide units are spaced about 3.4 Å apart. So perhaps each nucleotide is 3.4 Å apart from the next in the same strand. But wait, in DNA, each nucleotide is connected to the next by a sugar-phosphate bond, and the vertical spacing between base pairs is 3.4 Å. So the length of the DNA is the number of base pairs multiplied by 3.4 Å.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide in the same strand contributes 3.4 Å. But that doesn't sound right because the vertical rise per base pair is 3.4 Å, but each nucleotide is part of a base pair.

Hmm, perhaps I should clarify this. The standard is that in B-DNA, the distance between two consecutive base pairs along the axis is about 3.4 Å. So each base pair adds 3.4 Å to the DNA's length. So if there are N base pairs, the DNA is N * 3.4 Å long.

But the problem says that the DNA contains 4.5 million mononucleotide units. So each mononucleotide is a single nucleotide, so the total number of nucleotides is 4.5e6. Since each base pair has two nucleotides, the number of base pairs is (4.5e6) / 2 = 2.25e6. So the total length of the DNA is 2.25e6 * 3.4 Å.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the spacing is per mononucleotide, then perhaps each nucleotide contributes 3.4 Å. So 4.5e6 nucleotides * 3.4 Å each. But that would double the length because each base pair has two nucleotides. So which approach is correct?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In a DNA strand, each nucleotide is connected via a phosphodiester bond, and the backbone forms the sugar-phosphate chain. The distance along the backbone per nucleotide is different. Wait, but the 3.4 Å refers to the vertical rise per base pair in the double helix. So each base pair adds 3.4 Å to the DNA's length. So the length is base pair count times 3.4.

So if the DNA has 4.5e6 nucleotides in total (both strands), then the number of base pairs is 4.5e6 / 2 = 2.25e6. So the total length is 2.25e6 * 3.4 Å.

Let me compute that.

2.25e6 * 3.4 = 2.25 * 3.4 = let's see:

2 * 3.4 = 6.8, 0.25 * 3.4 = 0.85. So 6.8 + 0.85 = 7.65. So 7.65e6 Å.

Wait, but 7.65e6 angstroms. But I need to convert that into something more manageable, perhaps meters or micrometers, to compare with the size of the E. coli cell.

Wait, I remember that E. coli cells are typically about 2 micrometers in length, perhaps a bit longer. Let me confirm. Oh wait, I think E. coli is around 2 micrometers long on average. So if the DNA is, say, X meters long, and the cell is 2 micrometers, then how many times longer is the DNA than the cell?

Wait, but wait, the DNA's length is 7.65e6 Å. Let's convert that into meters. Since 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 7.65e6 Å = 7.65e6 * 1e-10 m = 7.65e-4 meters, which is 0.000765 meters, or 0.765 millimeters. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1 meter is 1e10 angstroms. So 7.65e6 angstroms is 7.65e6 / 1e10 = 7.65e-4 meters, which is 0.765 millimeters. Wait, that seems really long. Because I thought DNA is much longer than the cell but maybe that's the case.

Wait, but E. coli is only about 2 micrometers long, which is 2e-6 meters. So the DNA is 0.765e-3 meters, which is 765e-6 meters, so 765 micrometers, which is 0.765 millimeters.

Wait, but wait, 7.65e6 angstroms is 7.65e6 * 0.1 nanometers (since 1 Å = 0.1 nm). So 7.65e6 * 0.1 = 7.65e5 nm, which is 765,000 nm. And 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, but wait, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So 765,000 nm is 765 micrometers (because 1 micrometer is 1000 nm). So 765 micrometers is 0.765 millimeters.

E. coli is about 2 micrometers in length. So the DNA is 765 micrometers long, and the cell is 2 micrometers. So the DNA is 765 / 2 = 382.5 times longer. But wait, none of the options are around 380. The options are like 500, 550, 665, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the number of base pairs is wrong. Because the problem says 4.5 million mononucleotide units. Each DNA strand contributes that number. So for example, each strand is 4.5e6 nucleotides long.

Wait, no, wait. Because the DNA is a double-stranded molecule. So the total number of nucleotides is 2 times the number of base pairs. So if the number of base pairs is N, then the total nucleotides would be 2N. So given that the DNA has 4.5e6 mononucleotide units, that would mean 2N = 4.5e6 → N = 2.25e6 base pairs.

So the length of the DNA is N * 3.4 Å = 2.25e6 * 3.4 Å = 7.65e6 Å. Which is 7.65e6 * 1e-10 m = 7.65e-4 m = 0.000765 m = 765 micrometers.

E. coli cell is about 2 micrometers in length. So the DNA is 765 / 2 = 382.5 times longer than the cell.

But looking at the options, the closest would be option J: 665, but that's not matching. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the length of E. coli. Maybe it's longer than 2 micrometers. Let me think. Oh, wait, E. coli is typically about 2 micrometers in length, but some sources might say 2.5. Alternatively, perhaps the cell's length used in the problem is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the DNA length. Let's recalculate.

Wait, 4.5e6 mononucleotide units. If each is spaced 3.4 Å apart, but wait, is that per nucleotide or per base pair? Because if it's per base pair, then the number of base pairs is 4.5e6, but that would mean each strand has 4.5e6 nucleotides, making the total 9e6 nucleotides, which doesn't match the question. So perhaps the 3.4 Å is per nucleotide, meaning each nucleotide in the strand adds 3.4 Å. But in that case, the DNA length would be 4.5e6 * 3.4 Å.

Wait, that would be 15.3e6 Å, which is 1.53e-3 meters, or 1530 micrometers. Then, compared to E. coli's 2 micrometers, that's 1530 / 2 = 765 times as long. Hmm, which would correspond to option F:765 times as long as the cell.

Wait, but why would the 3.4 Å be per nucleotide? I thought it's per base pair. So which is it?

The question says, "the single DNA molecule in an E. coli chromosome (MW = 2.80 × 10^9) contains about 4.5 million mononucleotide units which are spaced about 3.4 Å apart."

So if each mononucleotide is spaced 3.4 Å apart, that suggests that each nucleotide contributes 3.4 Å to the length, so the total would be 4.5e6 * 3.4 Å.

But wait, that's a longer length. So let's do that calculation.

4.5e6 * 3.4 = let's compute that. 4e6 *3.4 =13.6e6, 0.5e6 *3.4=1.7e6 → total 15.3e6 Å.

Convert to meters: 15.3e6 Å * 1e-10 m/Å = 1.53e-4 m → 0.000153 meters → 153 micrometers? Wait, no, wait. 1e6 Å is 1e-4 meters (since 1e6 * 1e-10 = 1e-4 m), so 15.3e6 Å is 15.3 * 1e-4 m = 0.00153 meters, which is 1.53 millimeters. Wait, wait, no:

Wait, 1e6 angstroms = 1e6 * 1e-10 m = 1e-4 m = 0.0001 m = 1e-4 m.

So 15.3e6 Å = 15.3 * 1e6 Å = 15.3 * 1e-4 m = 0.00153 meters, which is 1.53 millimeters, or 1530 micrometers.

So 1530 micrometers is the DNA length.

E. coli cell length is about 2 micrometers. So how many times longer is the DNA? 1530 / 2 = 765 times.

So the answer would be option F:765 times as long as the cell.

But wait, earlier I thought the 3.4 Å was per base pair, which gave 765 micrometers, but that's when I considered base pairs. But according to the problem statement, it's 3.4 Å per mononucleotide unit. So that would give 765 times.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the length of the cell as 1 micrometer. Wait, no, I'm pretty sure E. coli is about 2 micrometers in length, roughly. So if I use 2 micrometers, then the DNA is 765 times longer. So option F is correct.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

4.5 million mononucleotide units: 4.5e6.

Each spaced 3.4 Å apart. So 4.5e6 * 3.4 Å = 15.3e6 Å.

Convert to meters:

15.3e6 Å = 15.3e6 * 1e-10 m = 1.53e-4 m = 0.000153 m = 1.53e-4 m.

Wait, wait, no: 1.53e-4 m is 0.153 mm, which is 1530 micrometers.

E. coli cell is 2 micrometers long.

So 1530 / 2 = 765 times as long.

So the correct option is F:765 times as long as the cell.

To calculate the total length of the DNA molecule in an E. coli chromosome and compare it to the length of the E. coli cell, we proceed as follows:

1. **DNA Length Calculation**:  
   The DNA contains 4.5 million mononucleotide units, and each mononucleotide is spaced 3.4 Å apart. Therefore, the total length of the DNA is:  
   \[
   \text{DNA Length} = 4.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{nucleotides} \times 3.4 \, \text{Å/nucleotide} = 15.3 \times 10^6 \, \text{Å}.
   \]  
   Converting to meters:  
   \[
   15.3 \times 10^6 \, \text{Å} \times 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m/Å} = 1.53 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m} = 1530 \, \mu\text{m}.
   \]

2. **Comparison with E. coli Cell Length**:  
   The length of an E. coli cell is approximately 2 μm. To find how many times longer the DNA is compared to the cell:  
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{DNA Length}}{\text{Cell Length}} = \frac{1530 \, \mu\text{m}}{2 \, \mu\text{m}} = 765.
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The DNA molecule is 765 times as long as the E. coli cell. This matches option **F**.
