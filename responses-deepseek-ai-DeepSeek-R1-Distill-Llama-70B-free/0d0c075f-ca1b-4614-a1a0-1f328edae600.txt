Okay, so I have this question about adrenaline's effects on different parts of the body. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question is about adrenaline, which I know is a hormone released by the adrenal glands. And it's related to the sympathetic nervous system. I remember that the sympathetic system is often called the 'fight or flight' response. So, when adrenaline is released, the body prepares to either fight or run away, which means certain physiological changes happen.

The question asks about three specific effects: (a) the digestive tract, (b) the iris of the eye, and (c) the heartbeat. I need to figure out what happens in each case.

Starting with part (a), the digestive tract. I remember that during a fight or flight response, digestion isn't a priority because the body needs energy directed towards immediate actions like running. So, the digestive system probably slows down. I think this means decreased peristalsis, which are the wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the digestive system. Also, secretion of digestive enzymes might decrease because digestion isn't the main focus right now. So, for (a), I'm expecting something like 'slows peristalsis and reduces secretion'.

Moving on to part (b), the iris of the eye. The iris has two sets of muscles: the dilator pupillae and the sphincter pupillae. The dilator muscles are controlled by the sympathetic system, which causes the pupil to dilate (get bigger) when they contract. The sphincter muscles, on the other hand, are controlled by the parasympathetic system and cause constriction when they contract. Since adrenaline stimulates the sympathetic system, it should cause the dilator muscles to contract, making the pupils dilate. So, the radial muscles (dilator) contract, leading to dilation of the iris. So, (b) would be 'causes radial muscles to contract, resulting in dilation'.

Now part (c), the heartbeat. Adrenaline is known to increase heart rate. It does this by stimulating the heart's beta-1 receptors, which increases both the rate and the force of contractions. So, the heart rate accelerates and becomes stronger. Therefore, (c) should be 'accelerates and strengthens the heartbeat'.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option F says (a) slows peristalsis and reduces secretion, (b) radial muscles contract (dilation), (c) accelerates and strengthens heartbeat. That matches what I thought.

Wait, let me double-check the options. Option F is: (a) Slows peristalsis and reduces secretion, (b) radial muscles contract causing dilation, (c) accelerates and strengthens. Yes, that fits.

Is there any other option that matches? Let me glance. Option D has (a) enhances digestion, which is opposite. Option J for (b) says radial contract causing constriction, which isn't right because contraction of radial muscles dilates. Option F seems correct.

Adrenaline, a hormone associated with the sympathetic nervous system's 'fight or flight' response, has distinct effects on various bodily systems. 

1. **Digestive Tract (a):** During a fight or flight response, digestion is deprioritized to conserve energy for immediate actions. This results in decreased peristalsis (the wave-like contractions that move food) and reduced secretion of digestive enzymes. Thus, adrenaline slows peristalsis and reduces secretion.

2. **Iris of the Eye (b):** The iris contains two sets of muscles: the dilator pupillae (radial muscles) and the sphincter pupillae (circular muscles). The sympathetic system, stimulated by adrenaline, causes the dilator pupillae to contract, leading to pupil dilation. Therefore, adrenaline causes the radial muscles to contract, resulting in dilation.

3. **Heartbeat (c):** Adrenaline increases heart rate and strengthens contractions by stimulating the heart's beta-1 receptors. This accelerates and strengthens the heartbeat.

Among the options, **Option F** correctly states these effects: (a) slows peristalsis and reduces secretion, (b) causes radial muscles to contract, resulting in dilation, and (c) accelerates and strengthens the heartbeat.

Answer: F
