Question:

A defendant is on trial for theft of a used car that he took for a test drive and did not return. He was arrested in the car two days later. In his defense, the defendant has testified that he had no intention of keeping the car but got caught up in marital problems and simply delayed returning it. The defendant calls a witness to testify that the defendant told him, during the two days, "I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife." Is the witness's testimony admissible?

Options:

A: Yes, as it provides context to the defendant's actions.
B: Yes, as a prior consistent statement of the defendant.
C: No, because it is a statement that could potentially influence the jury.
D: Yes, as a statement of the defendant's future intentions.
E: No, because it is irrelevant to the case.
F: Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.
G: No, because it is a self-serving statement by an accused.
H: Yes, as it is evidence of the defendant's character.
I: No, because it is a statement made after the event.
J: No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about whether a witness's testimony is admissible. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The defendant is on trial for theft of a used car. He took it for a test drive and didn't return it. He was caught two days later. His defense is that he didn't intend to keep the car but got caught up in marital problems and just delayed returning it. 

He called a witness who will testify that the defendant said, "I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife." So the question is whether this testimony is admissible.

Hmm, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So this statement by the defendant is being offered to show that he intended to return the car, right?

Wait, but is this hearsay? The defendant is testifying himself, and now a witness is testifying about something the defendant said. So the statement is being offered for the truthâ€”that he intended to return the car. So yes, it's hearsay unless there's an exception.

What are the exceptions to hearsay? There's the exception for present state of mind, like under FRE 803(3). That includes statements about the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. 

So the statement here is about the defendant's intention to return the car, which relates to his state of mind. But wait, this statement was made two days after taking the car. So the timing is important. The event was the taking of the car, which was two days before the statement. 

I think that under FRE 803(3), the statement must be about the declarant's state of mind at the time of the statement or before. So in this case, the defendant's statement was about his current intention when he made it, which was two days after taking the car. So it's a statement about his then-existing state of mind, which would fit the exception.

Alternatively, if the statement was about a past state of mind, that's not covered by the exception. Because the exception is for the then-existing state of mind. So here, the statement was made two days after the initial taking, but it's about his current intention to return it. So that should fall under the exception.

Wait, but another angle: Is the statement about his intent to return the car admissible to show that he didn't have the intent to steal when he took it? Because intent is a key element here. Theft requires the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property.

So if the defendant took the car for a test drive and intended to return it but just delayed, that would negate the specific intent needed for theft. So the statement is relevant to show his intent when he took the car. 

But wait, the statement was made two days after the taking. So is this statement admissible as a present state of mind? Or is it being used to prove his past intent, which might not fit the exception.

Hmm, because the exception covers statements about the then-existing state of mind, which would include his intention at the time of making the statement. But does that help with his intent at the time of the act?

I'm a bit confused here. Because the statement is about his future intention (to return the car), but it also reflects his current state of mind. So under 803(3), statements about future intentions are admissible if they relate to the declarant's existing state of mind. 

Wait, no, I think the exception covers statements about the declarant's existing state of mind, including their intentions, plans, etc., so long as they are about the time the statement was made, not past.

So in this case, the defendant's statement was about his current intention to return the car. That's his existing state of mind at the time of the statement. So it's admissible under 803(3), even though it's about a future action.

Therefore, the witness's testimony is admissible as a statement of the defendant's then-existing state of mind. So looking at the options, option F says "Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind." That sounds right.

Other options: Option B says it's a prior consistent statement. But prior consistent statements are used to rebut charges of recent fabrication, and they require the declarant to be subject to cross-examination. Plus, the defendant is testifying, so maybe it's allowed, but I think the better fit is the state of mind exception.

Option J says it's hearsay without exception. But we think it does fit an exception, so J would be incorrect.

Option D says it's a statement of future intentions. Well, the statement does express future intent, but under 803(3), that's allowed if it's about the existing state of mind.

So the correct answer should be F.

The defendant is on trial for theft of a used car, and the key issue is whether the witness's testimony about the defendant's statement, "I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife," is admissible. This statement is being offered to show the defendant's intent to return the car, which is relevant to whether he had the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the car, a required element for theft.

The statement is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 803(3), there is an exception for statements that reflect the declarant's then-existing state of mind, including intentions, plans, or motivations. Here, the defendant's statement expresses his current intention to return the car, which reflects his state of mind at the time the statement was made. This fits the exception under FRE 803(3), even though the statement refers to a future action (returning the car).

Other options are less applicable. Option B, regarding prior consistent statements, is not the best fit because the statement is not being used to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. Option D, focusing on future intentions, does not fully capture the admissibility under the state of mind exception. Option J, which argues the statement is hearsay without an exception, is incorrect because the statement qualifies under the state of mind exception.

Thus, the witness's testimony is admissible as a statement of the defendant's then-existing state of mind.
