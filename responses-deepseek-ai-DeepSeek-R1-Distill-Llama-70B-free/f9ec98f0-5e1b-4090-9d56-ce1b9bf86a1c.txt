Question:

Heteroscedasticity in a scattergram suggests that:

Options:

A: there is a restriction of range of scores on the predictor and/or the criterion.
B: the variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor.
C: there is a statistically significant correlation between the predictor and criterion.
D: the predictor and criterion have a negative correlation.
E: there is a perfect correlation between the predictor and the criterion.
F: the predictor and criterion are independent of each other.
G: the relationship between the predictor and criterion cannot be described by a straight line.
H: the variability (range) of scores on the predictor is constant for all scores on the criterion.
I: the scores on the criterion are uniformly distributed across the range of the predictor.
J: the variability (range) of scores on the predictor varies for different scores on the criterion.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about heteroscedasticity in a scattergram, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, let's start by recalling what heteroscedasticity means. From what I remember in statistics, heteroscedasticity refers to a situation where the variance of the dependent variable (criterion) is not constant across different levels of the independent variable (predictor). So, in a scatter plot, if the points are spread out more in some areas than others, that's heteroscedasticity.

The question is asking what heteroscedasticity suggests. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A says there's a restriction of range on the predictor and/or criterion. Wait, restriction of range is when the range of scores is limited, like if all the data points are clustered closely together. I don't think that's what heteroscedasticity is about. It's more about varying variances, not necessarily the range being restricted.

Option B: The variability of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor. Oh, that sounds exactly like what I was thinking. If the criterion's variability changes with different levels of the predictor, that's heteroscedasticity. So B looks correct.

Option C suggests a statistically significant correlation. But heteroscedasticity isn't about whether there's a correlation, just about the variance being uneven. So C might not be correct.

Option D talks about a negative correlation. Again, the sign of the correlation isn't related to heteroscedasticity. It's about variance, not direction.

Option E is about a perfect correlation. If there was a perfect correlation, the points would lie exactly on a line, so there would be no variance at all. So E doesn't fit.

Option F says the variables are independent. If they were independent, there wouldn't be any correlation, but the presence of heteroscedasticity doesn't mean they're independent. It's possible to have heteroscedasticity with a correlation, just not homoscedasticity.

Option G suggests the relationship isn't linear. Heteroscedasticity doesn't necessarily imply that; it's about the variance, not the linearity. Although non-linear relationships might have varying variances, heteroscedasticity itself doesn't make that statement.

Option H says the variability of the predictor is constant across criterion scores. Wait, that's the opposite of what heteroscedasticity is. Heteroscedasticity is about the criterion's variance changing with the predictor, not the predictor's variance. So H doesn't fit.

Option I claims the criterion scores are uniformly distributed across the predictor's range. Uniform distribution would imply consistent variance, which is homoscedasticity, the opposite of heteroscedasticity. So I is incorrect.

Option J says the predictor's variability varies with the criterion. That's not right either. Heteroscedasticity is about the criterion's variance varying with the predictor, not the other way around.

Wait, I should double-check. So, when you have heteroscedasticity, as the value of the predictor changes, the spread (variance) of the criterion's values changes. So B is correct because it's variability of the criterion varying with the predictor. And J is about the predictor's variability varying with the criterion, which isn't what heteroscedasticity describes.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Heteroscedasticity refers to a situation where the variance of the dependent variable (criterion) is not constant across different levels of the independent variable (predictor). In a scattergram, this is visualized as varying spreads of data points across the range of the predictor. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because heteroscedasticity is not about restriction of range but about varying variances.
- **B** is correct as it accurately describes heteroscedasticity: the variability of the criterion varies with different scores on the predictor.
- **C** is incorrect because heteroscedasticity does not imply a statistically significant correlation.
- **D** is incorrect as the direction of correlation (positive or negative) is unrelated to heteroscedasticity.
- **E** is incorrect because a perfect correlation would result in no variance, not heteroscedasticity.
- **F** is incorrect because heteroscedasticity does not imply independence between variables.
- **G** is incorrect because heteroscedasticity pertains to variance, not the linearity of the relationship.
- **H** is incorrect because it describes the opposite of heteroscedasticity.
- **I** is incorrect as uniform distribution implies homoscedasticity, not heteroscedasticity.
- **J** is incorrect because it reverses the relationship described by heteroscedasticity.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
