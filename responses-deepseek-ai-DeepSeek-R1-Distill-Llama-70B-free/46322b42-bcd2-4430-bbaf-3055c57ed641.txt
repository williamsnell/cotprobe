Okay, so I have this problem where I need to round the number .1476 to different decimal places. The question has three parts: (a) to 2 decimal places, (b) to 3 decimal places, and (c) to 1 decimal place. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step.

Let me start by recalling how rounding works. Rounding to a certain decimal place means looking at the next digit after the place you're rounding to and deciding whether to round up or keep it as it is. If that next digit is 5 or higher, you round the previous digit up by one. If it's less than 5, you leave it unchanged.

So for part (a), rounding to 2 decimal places. The number is .1476. Let me write this out. The first two decimals are 1 and 4, so that's .14. The next digit is 7, right? Wait, no. Wait, .1476 is 0.1476. So when rounding to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal place. The third digit after the decimal is 7. Since 7 is greater than or equal to 5, we add 1 to the second decimal place. So, the second decimal is 4, adding 1 makes it 5. So .14 becomes .15. So part (a) should be .15.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, .1476 rounded to two decimals: the third decimal is 7. So yes, we round up. So .14 becomes .15. So (a) is .15.

Moving on to part (b), rounding to three decimal places. The number is .1476. So the fourth decimal place is 6. Looking at the third decimal, which is 7. Wait no, no, wait. When rounding to three decimals, look at the fourth digit. So the digits are: 1 (tenths), 4 (hundredths), 7 (thousandths), 6 (ten-thousandths). So to round to three decimals, we look at the fourth digit, which is 6. Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, we add 1 to the third decimal. The third decimal is 7. Adding 1 to 7 gives 8. So .147 becomes .148. So part (b) is .148.

Wait, but wait, let me check that again. The number is 0.1476. Rounding to three decimals: the third is 7, the fourth is 6. So 6 >=5, so 7 becomes 8. So yes, .148.

Now part (c), rounding to one decimal place. The number is .1476. So we look at the second decimal place, which is 4. If the next digit is 5 or higher, we round up. The next digit is 7, which is higher than 5. So the first decimal (1) becomes 2. So .1 becomes .2. Wait, but wait: 0.1 + 0.1 is 0.2. So part (c) is .2.

Wait, hold on, that's a big jump. Let me think again. When rounding to one decimal place, which is the tenths place, the number is .1476. The digit in the tenths place is 1. The next digit is 4 in the hundredths place. Since 4 is less than 5, do we round up? Wait, no. Wait, when rounding to a certain place, you look at the next digit after that place. So for one decimal place, the tenths place is the first after the decimal. So the next digit is the hundredths, which is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we don't round up. So the tenths digit stays at 1. So .1 remains as .1. Wait, but wait, wait. No, that doesn't make sense because the number is 0.1476, which is more than 0.145. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I mixed up the places. When rounding to one decimal place, the rule is to look at the second decimal place to decide whether to round the first. So in .1476, the first decimal is 1, the second is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we don't round up. So it stays at .1.

Wait, wait, but wait another thing. Let me think of it as 0.1476. So when rounding to 1 decimal place, we look at the number to two decimal places to decide. For example, 0.1476 is between 0.1 and 0.2. But the exact value is 0.1476. The cutoff is 0.15. So if the number is less than 0.15, it rounds down to 0.1; if it's 0.15 or higher, it rounds up to 0.2. Oh wait, but wait, 0.1476 is less than 0.15. So it would round to 0.1, not 0.2. So part (c) is .1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the second digit is 4, which is less than 5, so no rounding. So yes, part (c) is 0.1.

So to recap:

a) .15

b) .148

c) .1

Now looking at the options:

Option A: (a) .14, (b) .147, (c) .1 → a is wrong because we got .15.

Option B: (a) .16, (b) .149, (c) .1 → a is wrong, we got .15.

Option C: (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1 → This matches what I got.

Option D: (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .2 → c is wrong, should be .1.

So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem of rounding .1476 to different decimal places, we follow the standard rounding rules: if the digit immediately after the desired decimal place is 5 or higher, we round up the previous digit by 1; otherwise, we leave it unchanged.

### Part (a): Rounding to 2 decimal places
- The number is .1476.
- The first two decimal places are .14.
- The third decimal place is 7, which is greater than or equal to 5.
- Therefore, we round the second decimal place (4) up by 1, making it 5.
- Final result: .15.

### Part (b): Rounding to 3 decimal places
- The number is .1476.
- The first three decimal places are .147.
- The fourth decimal place is 6, which is greater than or equal to 5.
- Therefore, we round the third decimal place (7) up by 1, making it 8.
- Final result: .148.

### Part (c): Rounding to 1 decimal place
- The number is .1476.
- The first decimal place is 1.
- The second decimal place is 4, which is less than 5.
- Therefore, we do not round up the first decimal place.
- Final result: .1.

### Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: (a) .14, (b) .147, (c) .1 → Incorrect because (a) should be .15.
- **Option B**: (a) .16, (b) .149, (c) .1 → Incorrect because (a) should be .15 and (b) should be .148.
- **Option C**: (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1 → Correct, matches all results.
- **Option D**: (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .2 → Incorrect because (b) should be .148 and (c) should be .1.

### Final Answer
C
