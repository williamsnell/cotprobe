Okay, so I have this question here about developmental psychology and the primary research method they use. Hmm, I remember that developmental psychology studies human development across the lifespan, right? So, they look at how people change and grow from infancy through old age.

The question is asking which method is primary. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A is psychoanalysis. I think that's more of a therapeutic approach developed by Freud, focusing on unconscious thoughts and childhood experiences. It's a clinical method, not a primary research method in the field, I believe.

Option B: self-report inventories. Those are like questionnaires where people report their own feelings or behaviors. Useful in some areas, but I'm not sure if that's the main method for developmental psych.

Option C is longitudinal research. Oh wait, that's when you study the same group of people over a long period. So, for example, following a group of children into adulthood to see how they develop. That sounds like it would be very useful for seeing changes over time, which is exactly what developmental psychologists need.

Option D: naturalistic observation. That's observing behavior in natural settings without interfering. It's a good method, but I'm not sure if it's the primary one. Maybe more for specific studies rather than the main approach.

Option E and F are both about experimental methods. Wait, E says experimental method and F says experimentation. Those are similar. Experiments involve manipulating variables and seeing the effect. But in developmental psychology, you can't always control variables like age or life stages. So experiments might not be the primary method because they're more suited for controlled settings, which might not capture real-life development across time.

Option G: correlational research. That's looking for relationships between variables, but it doesn't establish causation. It's used, but again, I'm not sure it's the primary method for studying development over time.

Option H: survey research. Similar to self-reports, surveys collect data from a large number of people. But again, it's a cross-sectional approach unless done repeatedly, which would be more like longitudinal.

Option I: cross-sectional research. This involves studying different age groups at the same time to compare them. It's faster because you don't have to wait years, but it doesn't track individual changes over time. So it's another method used, but perhaps not the primary one since it has limitations in seeing individual development.

Option J: case study. That's an in-depth study of a single person or a small group. It provides detailed insights but isn't representative of a larger population. So it's useful for specific cases, not the main approach for broad developmental studies.

Putting it all together, developmental psychologists need to study changes over time. Longitudinal research (Option C) allows them to track the same individuals as they age, which is crucial for understanding development. While cross-sectional (I) is also used, it's not as primary because it doesn't follow the same people. Experiments (E/F) are limited by the nature of developmental processes.

So the primary method should be longitudinal research.

The primary research method used by developmental psychologists is longitudinal research. This method involves studying the same group of individuals over an extended period, allowing researchers to observe and analyze changes and developments across different life stages. While other methods like cross-sectional research, experimentation, and naturalistic observation are also used, longitudinal research is particularly suited for capturing the dynamic and progressive nature of human development, making it the primary approach in the field.
