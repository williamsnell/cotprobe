Question:

A furniture store had a truck that an employee of the store used to deliver furniture to the store's customers. One afternoon while the employee was driving the truck to deliver a chair to a customer, the employee negligently ran through a stop sign and hit a car. The driver of the car suffered a leg injury and succeeded in suing the furniture store, recovering $25,000. Assume that all of these events occur in a jurisdiction that has statutes permitting defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity. In the event that the furniture store brings suit against its employee (the truck driver) to recover for its losses, the furniture store will recover

Options:

A: $15,000, because the employee and the furniture store share 60-40 responsibility for the accident.
B: $25,000, unless the furniture store was fully insured against such losses.
C: nothing, because the furniture store should have maintained the truck in a safer condition.
D: $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident.
E: nothing, because the furniture store was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages.
F: $12,500, unless the furniture store had provided proper training to the employee.
G: nothing, because the employee was not acting negligently.
H: the full amount, only if the employee has sufficient personal insurance coverage.
I: $12,500, because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.
J: nothing, because the employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question here. Let me read it carefully and break it down. 

Alright, the scenario is about a furniture store whose employee was driving a truck to deliver furniture. The employee ran through a stop sign and hit a car, injuring the driver who then sued the store and got $25,000. Now, the store is suing the employee to recover their losses. The question is, how much will the store recover?

First, I remember that when an employee causes an accident while working, the employer can be held vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. That means the employer is responsible for the employee's actions during work hours. So the store got sued and had to pay $25k.

But now, the store is trying to get that money back from the employee. So I think this is about contribution or indemnity. Contribution is when each party pays their share, and indemnity is when one party is held responsible and can recover from another who is actually at fault.

Wait, the question says the jurisdiction allows for contribution and indemnity claims. So the store might be trying to get indemnified by the employee because the employee was negligent.

I remember that indemnity usually applies when one party is more at fault. So if the employee was entirely at fault, the employer can seek full indemnity. But sometimes, if both parties are at fault, they might have to share.

Looking at the options, option D says the store would recover $25k because the employee was at fault. That makes sense if the employee's negligence was the sole cause. But I'm not sure if there's a possibility of shared fault here.

Wait, another angle: when an employer is vicariously liable, they might seek indemnity from the employee if the employee's actions were the direct cause. But sometimes, if the employer is even slightly negligent, like in maintaining the truck or training, that could affect it.

In the question, the employee was delivering furniture, so within the scope of employment. The store's only connection was that it was the employer. The employee's negligence caused the accident. So the store, as the employer, can seek indemnity.

But wait, I've heard that in some cases, the employer can't get indemnity because the employer's liability is vicarious. So the employee's actions are the primary cause, but the employer isn't directly at fault. However, the indemnity would depend on whether the employer was actively negligent or not.

Wait, the store is trying to recover from the employee. If the employee was entirely at fault, the store can get indemnity for the full amount. So that would make the store recover $25k.

Looking at the options, option D says $25k because the employee was at fault. Option B says $25k unless the store was fully insured. I'm not sure about insurance affecting this; maybe in some cases, if the employer is insured, the insurer might have subrogation rights, but I don't think that affects the employer's ability to seek indemnity from the employee.

Option J says nothing because the employee was acting within scope. But that's about the initial liability, not the indemnity. The store can still seek indemnity even if the employee was within scope.

Option E says nothing because the store was primarily liable. But primary liability usually refers to the employer being directly responsible, but here the employee was the one who was negligent.

So I think the correct answer is D: $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident. But wait, another thought: some jurisdictions may prevent the employer from getting indemnity if the employer's liability is based solely on respondeat superior without any active negligence. So if the employer wasn't directly at fault, can they get indemnity?

I think in some jurisdictions, the employer can only seek indemnity if they were actively negligent as well. But if the employer wasn't negligent, maybe they can't. Wait, in this case, the store wasn't mentioned as being negligent in any way except through the employee. So if the employee was 100% at fault, can the employer get indemnity?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Contribution is about sharing fault, but indemnity is shifting the entire loss. If the employee was entirely at fault, the employer could seek full indemnity. So the store would get the $25k back.

But wait, another point: if the employee was acting within the scope, the employer is vicariously liable, but the employer can seek indemnity from the employee if the employee's negligence caused the loss. So the answer should be D.

Wait, what about option B? It says unless the store was fully insured. I'm not sure about that. If the store had insurance, maybe the insurer would cover the loss, but the store's claim against the employee wouldn't be affected by their insurance status. Or perhaps if the store was fully insured, they canâ€™t seek indemnity because the loss was covered. But I don't think that's the general rule. Indemnity is about who is ultimately responsible, not about insurance coverage.

So I think the correct answer is D: $25,000 because the employee was at fault.

The question revolves around the liability of a furniture store and its employee after an accident caused by the employee's negligence. The store, held vicariously liable under respondeat superior, paid $25,000 to the injured driver and is now seeking to recover this amount from the employee. The jurisdiction allows claims for contribution and indemnity, and the key issue is whether the store can recover the full amount from the employee.

Vicarious liability means the employer is legally responsible for the employee's actions during the scope of employment. However, indemnity allows the employer to shift the entire loss to the employee if the employee's negligence was the sole cause of the accident. Contribution, on the other hand, would apply if both parties shared fault, requiring them to split the loss proportionally.

In this case, the employee's negligence in running the stop sign directly caused the accident, and there is no mention of any active negligence by the employer, such as failing to maintain the truck or provide proper training. Therefore, the employee is entirely at fault, and the employer can seek full indemnity for the $25,000 paid to the plaintiff. 

Option D correctly reflects this reasoning, as the employee's fault justifies the employer recovering the full amount. Other options, such as B (insurance status) or J (scope of employment), are irrelevant or incorrect in this context. The employer's ability to recover does not depend on insurance coverage, and the employee's actions being within the scope of employment do not preclude indemnity.

Thus, the furniture store will recover $25,000 from the employee.
