Okay, so I've got this problem about diffraction gratings and spectrometers. Hmm, I remember that diffraction gratings are used to split light into its spectrum, and the way they work is based on the interference of light waves.

The question says a sodium light source is used, with a wavelength of 5.89e-5 cm. Wait, converting that to meters might be easier for calculation, but let me think. Oh, right, 1 cm is 1e-2 meters, so 5.89e-5 cm is 5.89e-7 meters, which is 589 nm. That's the standard wavelength for sodium, so I remember that part.

The problem states that the angular separation between the central order (which is zeroth order) and the 20th order is 15 degrees and 10 minutes. Oh wait, minutes are 1/60 of a degree, right? So 10 minutes is 10/60 degrees, which is 0.1667 degrees. So total angle is 15.1667 degrees. Let me note that down: theta = 15 + 10/60 = 15.1667 degrees.

Diffraction grating equation is d sin(theta) = m lambda, where d is the distance between grating elements, m is the order, lambda is the wavelength. But wait, the number of grating elements per cm is what's being asked. So if I can find d, the grating spacing, then 1 cm would be 1/d elements per cm.

Wait, but wait, the question mentions the 20th order. So m=20. So putting m=20 into the equation.

So, sin(theta) = (m lambda)/d.

I can rearrange this to solve for d: d = (m lambda) / sin(theta).

But I need to make sure all the units are compatible. Let's see, lambda is given in cm, so 5.89e-5 cm. Theta is in degrees, so I'll need to compute sin(theta) in the same units.

Let me compute theta in radians or just work in degrees? Well, calculators can handle that. So sin(15.1667 degrees) — let me calculate that. Hmm, 15 degrees is about 0.2588 radians. But let's compute sin(15.1667) using a calculator.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can compute it using exact values. Let me see, 15 degrees is 0.2588, but adding 10 minutes (which is 0.1667 degrees) would make it about 15.1667 degrees. Let me calculate sin(15.1667):

Using a calculator, sin(15) is approx 0.2588, sin(15.1667) is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps it's about 0.2609. Let me think: 15 degrees is 0.2588, 15.1667 is 15 degrees plus 10/60 = 0.1667 degrees. The sine of 15.1667 degrees, I can approximate using a small angle addition. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), so delta_x is 0.1667 degrees in radians.

Wait, 0.1667 degrees is approx 0.002908 radians (since 1 degree is approx 0.01745 radians). So delta_x is 0.002908 radians.

So sin(15.1667) ≈ sin(15) + (delta_x)*cos(15). Sin(15)=0.2588, cos(15)=0.9659.

So 0.2588 + 0.002908 * 0.9659 ≈ 0.2588 + 0.002809 ≈ 0.2616. So approximately 0.2616.

So sin(theta) ≈ 0.2616.

Now, m is 20, lambda is 5.89e-5 cm.

So d = (m * lambda) / sin(theta) = (20 * 5.89e-5 cm) / 0.2616.

Let me compute numerator first: 20 * 5.89e-5 = 1.178e-3 cm.

Divide by 0.2616: 1.178e-3 / 0.2616 ≈ (1.178 / 0.2616 ) * 1e-3.

Calculating 1.178 / 0.2616. Let's see, 0.2616 * 4.5 = 1.1772. Oh wait, 0.2616 *4.5=1.1772, which is almost exactly 1.178. So 4.5.

So d ≈ 4.5e-3 cm. Wait, 4.5e-3 cm is 4.5 micrometers? Or 450 nm? Hmm, that seems a bit tight but plausible for a diffraction grating.

But wait, the question is asking for the number of grating elements per cm. So since d is in cm per element, the number per cm is 1/d (in cm^-1) multiplied by 1 cm.

So number N is N = 1 cm / d.

Wait, wait, no. Because if d is the distance between two adjacent grating lines (in cm), then the number of lines per cm is 1/d (lines per cm). So for d in cm, N = 1/d (per cm).

So with d=4.5e-3 cm, N=1/(4.5e-3) = approx 222.222 lines per cm.

Looking at the options, option F is 222. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, lambda is 5.89e-5 cm? Because 1 cm is 1e-2 meters? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 5.89e-5 cm is 5.89e-7 meters, which is 589 nm. That's correct because sodium D line is about 589 nm.

Wait, but in the calculation, I used lambda as 5.89e-5 cm, which is correct because 1 cm is 1e-2 m. So 5.89e-5 cm is 5.89e-7 m, which is 589 nm.

Wait, but in the equation, d sin(theta) = m lambda, so all the units must be compatible. So when I plug in lambda in cm, d must be in cm as well.

So, I think my calculation is correct.

So d ≈ 4.5e-3 cm, which is 0.0045 cm per grating element.

Number per cm is 1 / 0.0045 = approx 222.22. So 222 per cm, which is option F.

But wait, let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 20 * 5.89e-5 cm.

20 * 5.89e-5 = 1.178e-3 cm.

Divide by 0.2616: 1.178e-3 / 0.2616 = (1.178 / 0.2616) * 1e-3.

Wait, 0.2616 * 4.5 = 1.1772, which is very close to 1.178, so 4.5 is correct.

So 4.5 * 1e-3 cm is d. So 1/d is 222.222 per cm.

So the correct answer must be F: 222.

To solve the problem, we use the diffraction grating equation:

\[
d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda
\]

where:
- \(d\) is the distance between adjacent grating elements (in cm),
- \(\theta\) is the angular separation (in degrees),
- \(m\) is the diffraction order,
- \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the light (in cm).

### Step 1: Convert the angular separation
The angular separation is given as \(15^\circ 10'\). Since \(1' = \frac{1}{60}^\circ\), we convert \(10'\) to degrees:
\[
10' = \frac{10}{60} = 0.1667^\circ
\]
Thus, the total angular separation is:
\[
\theta = 15 + 0.1667 = 15.1667^\circ
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\sin(\theta)\)
Using a calculator or approximation, we find:
\[
\sin(15.1667^\circ) \approx 0.2616
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(d\)
Rearranging the diffraction grating equation to solve for \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{m \lambda}{\sin(\theta)}
\]
Substitute the given values:
- \(m = 20\),
- \(\lambda = 5.89 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\),
- \(\sin(\theta) = 0.2616\),
\[
d = \frac{20 \times 5.89 \times 10^{-5}}{0.2616}
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
20 \times 5.89 \times 10^{-5} = 1.178 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm}
\]
Now divide by \(0.2616\):
\[
d = \frac{1.178 \times 10^{-3}}{0.2616} \approx 4.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of grating elements per cm
The number of grating elements per cm is the reciprocal of \(d\):
\[
\text{Number of elements per cm} = \frac{1}{d} = \frac{1}{4.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 222 \, \text{elements per cm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The number of grating elements in 1 cm is approximately **222**, which corresponds to option **F**.
