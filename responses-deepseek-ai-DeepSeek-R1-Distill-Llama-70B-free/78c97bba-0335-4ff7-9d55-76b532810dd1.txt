Okay, so I've got this question about Valls' discussion on discrimination in war. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking what Valls suggests regarding the concepts of combatants and noncombatants. The options are A through J, each presenting a different view. I remember that in discussions about just war theory, the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is a big deal. It's about who is a legitimate target in war.

Wait, Valls is talking about discrimination in war, which probably relates to the principle of distinction. The principle of distinction says that combatants can be targeted, while noncombatants (civilians) should not be. But I need to recall what Valls specifically said about this.

I think Valls might argue that the line between combatants and noncombatants isn't as clear-cut as it's often made out to be. Maybe he suggests that it's more of a spectrum or that the categories are ambiguous. Or perhaps he's saying the distinction is categorical, which would mean it's clear and definite.

Looking at the options, option E says the difference is categorical and clear. Option J says it's a matter of degree. Option I says it's subjective and varies with perspective. Option D says it's largely ambiguous. Option G mentions a fine line, which is similar to ambiguity or degree.

Wait, I think Valls argues that the distinction is not as clear as traditional just war theory makes it. He might say that in reality, the line is blurry because, for example, some noncombatants might support the war effort in various ways, making them not entirely innocent. Or perhaps he's pointing out that in modern warfare, with things like guerrilla tactics, it's harder to distinguish combatants from noncombatants.

So if the distinction is blurry or ambiguous, then the answer would be D: the difference is largely ambiguous. Alternatively, if it's a matter of degree, then J. Or maybe I says it's subjective.

Alternatively, I might be confusing Valls with another thinker. Wait, I remember that Valls discusses the moral equality of combatants, arguing against the idea that soldiers on one side are morally superior. But that's about the moral status, not the distinction.

Wait, no, the question is about discrimination, which is about targeting, so it's about the principle of distinction. So Valls must be talking about how that principle is applied.

I think Valls argues that the distinction is not as clear as we think. So maybe the difference is ambiguous or a matter of degree. So between options D, J, and I.

Another angle: the concept of terrorism. Some options are about defining terrorism. Option B says terrorism is violence against noncombatants. Option F says it's indiscriminate violence. Option H says it's violence outside of war.

But the question is about what Valls suggests regarding discrimination, which is about targeting. So maybe the answer is more about the distinction between combatants and noncombatants.

If Valls says the distinction is clear, that would be E. But I think he's more critical of that view. So perhaps the answer is D: the difference is largely ambiguous.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe he's saying that the distinction is categorical but often not applied correctly, making it ambiguous in practice. Or maybe he argues that it's a matter of degree, like J.

I'm a bit torn between D and J. Let me think again. If the categories are ambiguous, that suggests they're not clear-cut. If it's a matter of degree, that implies a sliding scale.

I think Valls might argue that the distinction is not as clear as often thought, making the difference ambiguous. So the answer would be D.

The question revolves around Valls' perspective on the distinction between combatants and noncombatants in the context of discrimination in war. This distinction is central to the principle of distinction in just war theory, which dictates that combatants are legitimate targets while noncombatants (civilians) are not. 

Analyzing the options, E suggests the difference is categorical and clear, which aligns with traditional just war theory. However, Valls is likely critical of this view, arguing that the distinction is not as straightforward. Options D, J, and I propose alternative perspectives: D states the difference is largely ambiguous, J suggests it is a matter of degree, and I claims it is subjective and varies with perspective.

Considering Valls' critique, it is reasonable to conclude that he argues the distinction is not clear-cut. The most fitting answer is D: the difference between combatants and noncombatants is largely ambiguous.

Answer: D
