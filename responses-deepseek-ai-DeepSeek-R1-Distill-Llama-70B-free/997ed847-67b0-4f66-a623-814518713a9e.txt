Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of the given elements is a metal. Let's see, the options are A through J, each representing a different element.

First, I remember that metals are elements that are shiny, malleable, and good conductors of electricity. They are typically found on the left side of the periodic table. Nonmetals are on the right, and metalloids are in between.

Looking at the options:

A: Ne. That's neon. I think it's a noble gas, so definitely not a metal.

B: N. Nitrogen is a nonmetal. It's a diatomic gas, right?

C: S. Sulfur is also a nonmetal. It's that yellow crystalline solid.

D: I. Iodine, another nonmetal. It's a halogen, so in the same group as chlorine and fluorine.

E: F. Fluorine is a halogen too, so nonmetal.

F: Se. Selenium. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think selenium is actually a metalloid. It's used in electronics, so maybe it's somewhere in the metalloid category.

G: Ga. Gallium. Now, gallium rings a bell as a metal. I remember that it's a soft, silvery metal used in semiconductors maybe? Or perhaps in alloys.

H: O. Oxygen is a nonmetal, right? It's a diatomic gas essential for breathing.

I: He. Helium is a noble gas, so not a metal.

J: H. Hydrogen is a nonmetal, and it's the lightest element. Sometimes it's debated, but generally considered a nonmetal.

So putting it all together, the metals in the list would be option G, Gallium. All the others are nonmetals or noble gases.

The question asks which element among the options is a metal. Metals are characterized as shiny, malleable, and good conductors of electricity, typically found on the left side of the periodic table.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Ne (Neon)** – A noble gas, not a metal.
- **B: N (Nitrogen)** – A nonmetal, diatomic gas.
- **C: S (Sulfur)** – A nonmetal, yellow crystalline solid.
- **D: I (Iodine)** – A halogen, nonmetal.
- **E: F (Fluorine)** – A halogen, nonmetal.
- **F: Se (Selenium)** – A metalloid, not a metal.
- **G: Ga (Gallium)** – A soft, silvery metal used in semiconductors and alloys.
- **H: O (Oxygen)** – A nonmetal, diatomic gas.
- **I: He (Helium)** – A noble gas, not a metal.
- **J: H (Hydrogen)** – A nonmetal, the lightest element.

Among the options, only **G: Ga (Gallium)** is a metal.

Answer: G
