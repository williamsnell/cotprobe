Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. The question says that at the beginning of a class period, half of the students go to the library. Then, later in the period, half of the remaining students go to the computer lab. After all that, there are 8 students left in the class. I need to find out how many students were originally in the class.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. Let me call the original number of students "x". So, initially, the class has x students.

First, half of them go to the library. So, the number of students who go to the library is (1/2)x. That means the number remaining in the class after this first group leaves is also (1/2)x. Because if half leave, half stay.

Then, later, half of those remaining students go to the computer lab. So, from the remaining (1/2)x, half of them leave. Let's calculate how many that is. Half of (1/2)x is (1/2)*(1/2)x = (1/4)x. So, (1/4)x students go to the computer lab, and the remaining in the class would be the other half of those who stayed after the library trip. So that's (1/2)x - (1/4)x = (1/4)x.

Wait, but the problem states that after these two departures, there are 8 students remaining. So, the last remaining is (1/4)x, which equals 8. So I can set up the equation (1/4)x = 8.

To solve for x, I'll multiply both sides by 4. So, x = 8 * 4 = 32. So the original number of students was 32.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Let's go through it again. Starting with 32 students.

First, half go to the library: 32 / 2 = 16. So 16 leave, 16 remain.

Then, half of those remaining go to the computer lab: 16 / 2 = 8. So 8 leave, 8 stay. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, 32 seems correct.

Looking back at the options, option D is 32. So that's the answer.

To determine the original number of students in the class, let's denote the initial number of students as \( x \).

1. **First Departure (Library):**  
   Half of the students go to the library, so the number of students remaining in the class is:  
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. **Second Departure (Computer Lab):**  
   Half of the remaining students go to the computer lab, so the number of students remaining in the class is:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

3. **Final Count:**  
   According to the problem, 8 students remain after both departures. Therefore:  
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 8
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**  
   Multiply both sides by 4:  
   \[
   x = 8 \times 4 = 32
   \]

Thus, the original number of students in the class was 32. This corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
