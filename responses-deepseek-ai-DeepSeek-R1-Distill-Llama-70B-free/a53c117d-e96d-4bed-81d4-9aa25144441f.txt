Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A motorist was traveling at 5 miles per hour when she became distracted, and negligently tapped the rear of another vehicle. A passenger in the struck vehicle had a rare medical condition that made her highly vulnerable to any slight physical impact or intrusion. The minimal impact caused the passenger to lightly bump her shoulder against the door, which triggered her rare immunosuppressant disease to surface. The passenger became permanently incapacitated from the impact. She sued the negligent motorist for all of her injuries. A physician submitted a report stating that the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability. Has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles?

Options:

A: No, because the motorist could not have predicted that such a small impact would have such severe consequences.
B: Yes, because the victim in this case is called a "predictably unpredictable plaintiff."
C: No, because the passenger's rare medical condition was not directly caused by the motorist.
D: Yes, because the motorist is always responsible for any harm caused by their negligent actions.
E: No, because the medical report did not conclusively prove that the collision was the sole cause of the disability.
F: Yes, because the law holds the defendant liable for all injuries, regardless of their severity or nature.
G: No, because the victim's psychosomatic reaction is usually held to be malingering under the law.
H: Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff "as he finds her."
I: No, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries that are not of psychological origin.

Okay, so I've got this tort question here about negligence and causation. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The facts are that a motorist was going 5 mph and tapped the rear of another vehicle. A passenger in that vehicle had a rare medical condition making her very vulnerable to even slight impacts. Because of the bump, she hit her shoulder against the door, and that triggered her condition, leading to permanent incapacitation. She's suing the motorist.

The question is whether she's stated a valid claim under the law. The options are A through J. Hmm.

I remember that in negligence, the key elements are duty, breach, causation, and damages. The motorist was clearly negligent—she was distracted and tapped the car, so duty and breach are probably met.

The main issue here is causation. The plaintiff needs to show that the defendant's action was the cause of her injury. But wait, the injury here is from a rare condition that was triggered by a minor impact. So does the defendant's action count as the proximate cause?

I think about the concept of 'taking the plaintiff as you find them.' That's the idea that defendants are responsible for the plaintiff's injuries even if the plaintiff was unusually vulnerable. Like if someone with a fragile skull is injured more severely than average, the defendant is still liable. So in this case, the passenger's rare condition would fall under that principle.

Looking at the options, option H says yes because the law holds the defendant to take the plaintiff "as he finds her." That sounds right. But I should check the other options to make sure.

Option A says no because the motorist couldn't predict the severe consequences. But foreseeability isn't always about the exact injury; it's about whether some harm was foreseeable. Here, a minor impact could cause some injury, even if not this severe. So A might not be correct because it's more about the type of harm than the exact extent.

Option B refers to the "predictably unpredictable plaintiff." I'm not too sure about that term. I think it's more about the plaintiff's condition being rare but existing, so the defendant is still liable. But I don't think that's the standard legal principle here.

Option C says no because the condition wasn't directly caused by the motorist. But the collision triggered it, so the motorist's action was the cause. So C seems incorrect.

Option D says the motorist is always responsible for any harm from their negligence. That's too broad because there has to be causation. So D is probably wrong.

Option E argues about the medical report not proving it was the sole cause. But in tort law, the defendant just needs to be a substantial factor, not the sole cause. So E is incorrect.

Option F says yes because the law holds defendants liable for all injuries. Again, this is too broad. It's about whether the injury was a foreseeable result, not just any injury.

Option G talks about psychosomatic reactions being malingering. But in this case, the reaction is physical, not psychological. The bump caused a physical trigger, so G is not applicable.

Option I says no because the injury wasn't foreseeable or is psychological. But the injury here is physical, and the minor impact could foreseeably cause some injury, even if the extent was due to her condition. So I is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer seems to be H because the defendant takes the plaintiff as they find her. The rare condition is part of who the plaintiff is, and the defendant is liable for the resulting harm even if it's more severe than usual.

The question revolves around whether the plaintiff has stated a valid claim for relief under negligence law. The key elements of negligence—duty, breach, causation, and damages—are present here. The motorist was negligent, and the collision caused the plaintiff's injury. The critical issue is causation, specifically whether the defendant's actions were the proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm.

The plaintiff's rare medical condition made her highly vulnerable to even minor impacts, and the collision triggered her condition, leading to permanent incapacitation. Under the legal principle that a defendant "takes the plaintiff as they find her," the defendant is liable for the plaintiff's injuries even if the plaintiff's preexisting condition made the harm more severe than foreseeable. This principle applies here because the plaintiff's vulnerability, though rare, existed at the time of the injury.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Foreseeability of the exact severity of harm is not required; only that some harm was foreseeable.
- **B**: Incorrect. The term "predictably unpredictable plaintiff" is not the relevant legal principle here.
- **C**: Incorrect. The collision was a substantial factor in triggering the plaintiff's condition, establishing causation.
- **D**: Incorrect. Liability is not absolute; causation must still be established.
- **E**: Incorrect. The collision need only be a substantial factor, not the sole cause.
- **F**: Incorrect. Liability is not automatic for all injuries, regardless of foreseeability.
- **G**: Incorrect. The injury was physical, not psychosomatic.
- **H**: Correct. The principle that the defendant takes the plaintiff "as he finds her" applies, making the defendant liable for the plaintiff's injuries despite her rare condition.
- **I**: Incorrect. The injury was physical and foreseeable, even if the extent was due to the plaintiff's condition.

The correct answer is **H**, as the defendant is liable under the principle that they take the plaintiff "as they find her."
