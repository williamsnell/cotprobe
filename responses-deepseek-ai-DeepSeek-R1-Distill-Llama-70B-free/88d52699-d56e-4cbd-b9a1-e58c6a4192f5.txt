Okay, so I have this question about where the majority of Kurds are found. Hmm, I remember that Kurds are a significant ethnic group in the Middle East, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact countries. Let me think.

I know that the Kurds don't have their own country, so they're spread across several nations. I've heard about the "Kurdish region" in different places. So, which countries are we talking about here? I think Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria are the main ones. Oh, and maybe some in Armenia or elsewhere, but those are probably smaller numbers.

Wait, the question is about the majority. So which of these countries has the largest Kurdish population? I remember that Turkey has a substantial Kurdish population, maybe the largest. Because Turkey is a bigger country, but does that mean more Kurds live there? Alternatively, Iraq has the Kurdistan region, which is quite autonomous, so maybe that's where a lot of Kurds are.

I should break it down. Let's see, I think the approximate numbers are something like 15-20 million Kurds in Turkey, around 6-8 million in Iran, about 5-6 million in Iraq, and smaller numbers in Syria and other places. So if that's the case, Turkey would have the majority.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the numbers. Another thought: I've heard that the largest Kurdish population is actually in Turkey. They make up a significant minority there. So that would mean the answer is Turkey, which is option H.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with Iraq because of the Kurdistan Regional Government there. But I think the population numbers are higher in Turkey. So the majority of Kurds are in Turkey.
