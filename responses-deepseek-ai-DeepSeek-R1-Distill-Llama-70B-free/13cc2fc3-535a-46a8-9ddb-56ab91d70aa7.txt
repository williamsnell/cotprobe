Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a plot of land that's 100 feet by 40 feet, sold for $75 a front foot. I need to compute the gross selling price and then find the net selling price after the broker's commission of 7 and a half percent.

Hmm, I think the first part is about calculating the total cost based on the front footage. Wait, front foot usually refers to the frontageâ€”the length of the property facing the street, right? So, in this case, the front foot would be the 100 feet side because that's probably the frontage. So, they're selling it at $75 per front foot.

So, the frontage is 100 feet. At $75 per foot, the gross selling price would be 100 * 75. Let me calculate that. 100 times 75 is 7500. So, the gross is $7,500. That seems straightforward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The plot is 100 by 40 feet, so the area is 4000 square feet. But the problem says it's sold per front foot, not per square foot. So, yeah, it's 100 feet frontage times $75. So, $7,500 is correct for the gross.

Now, the next part is the broker's commission. It's 7 and a half percent. So, 7.5% of the gross selling price. The commission comes out of the gross, so the net selling price is the gross minus the commission.

So, first, calculate 7.5% of $7,500. Let me think, 7.5% is the same as 0.075 in decimal. So, 7500 multiplied by 0.075. Let me do that math.

7500 * 0.075. Well, 7500 * 0.07 is 525, and 7500 * 0.005 is 37.5. So adding those together, 525 + 37.5 is 562.5. So the commission is $562.50.

Wait, but wait, 7.5% of 7500. Let me check another way. 10% of 7500 is 750, so 5% is half of that, which is 375. So 7.5% is 5% + 2.5%. 5% is 375, 2.5% would be half of 5%, so 187.5. Adding 375 + 187.5 gives 562.5. Yep, same as before.

So the commission is $562.50. Now, the net selling price is the gross minus the commission. So, $7,500 - $562.50 equals $6,937.50.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see $6,937.50. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, the options given are A through J, with values like $3,225, $75, etc. None of them are close to $6,937.50. So I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait a second, maybe I miscalculated the front foot. Oh, perhaps the front foot is 40 feet instead of 100. Because sometimes, front foot can be the shorter side if that's the street frontage. Wait, the question says the plot is 100 by 40 feet. So, which side is the front?

Hmm, the problem doesn't specify which side is the front. Oh wait, the problem says "front foot," which is usually the side along the street. So perhaps the front is 40 feet. Let me check that.

If the front is 40 feet, then the selling price per front foot is $75. So 40 *75 is 3000. So gross is $3,000. Then, the commission is 7.5% of 3000. Let's compute that.

7.5% of 3000 is 0.075 *3000 = 225. So the commission is $225. Subtracting that from $3,000 gives $2,775 as the net selling price.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is $2,775.00. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the front was 100 feet, but maybe I got that wrong. The question doesn't specify, but perhaps I need to think about how front foot is usually calculated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the plot is 100 feet by 40 feet, and the front is the longer side, which is 100 feet, but that would lead to a much higher gross, and the options didn't have that. So perhaps I misread the dimensions.

Wait, the problem says "100 feet by 40 feet." It's possible that the frontage is the 40-foot side. So then, 40 *75 is 3000. Which would match one of the options.

Ah, yes, let me think again. So if the front foot is 40 feet, then 40 *75 =3000. Then commission is 7.5% of 3000, which is 225. So net is 2775, which is option F.

So the correct answer should be F: $2,775.00.

Wait, but why did I initially think the front was 100 feet? Maybe because it's the first number, but perhaps the front is the smaller side. Or maybe the problem assumes that the front is the 100-foot side, and I should stick with that.

Wait, but if the front is 100 feet, the gross is 7500, which isn't in the options except for D:7500. But then the net would be 7500-562.5=6937.5, which isn't any of the options. So that can't be right.

So perhaps the front is 40 feet. Then, the gross is 3000, which is option G. Then the net would be 2775, which is option F.

So the correct answer is F.

The problem involves calculating the gross selling price of a plot of land and then determining the net selling price after accounting for a broker's commission.

1. **Gross Selling Price**:  
   The plot is sold at $75 per front foot. The front foot refers to the frontage of the property. While the dimensions are 100 feet by 40 feet, the frontage is assumed to be the shorter side (40 feet) based on the answer options.  
   \[
   \text{Gross Selling Price} = 40 \times 75 = 3,000.
   \]

2. **Broker's Commission**:  
   The broker's commission is 7.5% of the gross selling price:  
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 0.075 \times 3,000 = 225.
   \]

3. **Net Selling Price**:  
   The net selling price is the gross selling price minus the commission:  
   \[
   \text{Net Selling Price} = 3,000 - 225 = 2,775.
   \]

From the given options, the correct answer is **F: $2,775.00**.
