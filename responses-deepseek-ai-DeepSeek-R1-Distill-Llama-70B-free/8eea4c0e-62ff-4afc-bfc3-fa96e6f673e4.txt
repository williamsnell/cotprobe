Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about water expanding when it freezes and how much space should be left in a jug so that when the water freezes, it fills the jug exactly. 

Hmm, I remember that water is one of the few substances that expands when it freezes. So, when water turns into ice, it takes up more volume. That's why ice floats. So the key here is to find out how much volume increases when water freezes, and then determine what fraction of the jug should be empty initially.

The given data: density of water at 25°C is 0.9971 g/cm³, and density of ice at 0°C is 0.917 g/cm³. I think density is mass over volume, right? So density = mass/volume, which means volume = mass/density.

So maybe I should compare the volumes. Let's say we have a certain mass of water. When it freezes, the volume increases because the density decreases. Wait, because density is inversely related to volume for a given mass. So lower density means higher volume.

Let me think mathematically. Let's say the mass of water is m grams. The volume when it's water is V_water = m / density_water. The volume when it's ice is V_ice = m / density_ice.

So the ratio of V_ice to V_water is (m / density_ice) / (m / density_water) )= density_water / density_ice.

Plugging in the numbers: density_water is 0.9971, density_ice is 0.917. So the ratio is 0.9971 / 0.917. Let me calculate that.

0.9971 divided by 0.917 is approximately... let me compute. 0.9971 ÷ 0.917. Let's see. 0.917 times 1.087 is about 1. So 0.9971 is slightly less than 1. So the ratio would be around 1.087.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's do 0.9971 ÷ 0.917.

0.917 goes into 0.9971 how many times? Let's see. 0.917 * 1.08 = 0.917 * 1 =0.917, 0.917 *0.08=0.07336. So 0.917 +0.07336=0.99036. That's under 0.9971. So 0.08 gives 0.99036. The difference is 0.9971 - 0.99036=0.00674.

So 0.917 * x = 0.00674, where x is the additional part beyond 1.08. So x = 0.00674 / 0.917 ≈ 0.00735. So the total ratio is approximately 1.08 + 0.00735 = 1.08735, so about 1.087 or 8.7% increase.

Wait, but wait. So the volume increases by about 8.7% when water freezes. But the question is a bit different. It's asking, what percent of the jug should be left empty so that when the water freezes, it fills the jug. So, if the jug is currently filled to some level, and the rest is empty, upon freezing, the volume increases and fills the jug exactly.

Let me rephrase. Suppose the total volume of the jug is V_total. Let's say the volume of water we have is V_water, so the empty space is V_empty = V_total - V_water.

When water freezes, it becomes V_ice = V_water * (density_water / density_ice) ≈ V_water * 1.08735.

At that point, V_ice should equal V_total, because it just fills the jug. So:

V_ice = V_total
V_water * (density_water / density_ice) = V_total

So V_water = V_total * (density_ice / density_water)

Wait, V_water is the initial volume of water, and V_total is the volume of the jug. So the fraction filled initially is V_water / V_total = density_ice / density_water.

So what's that fraction? Let's compute density_ice / density_water = 0.917 / 0.9971 ≈ 0.9197, so around 91.97%.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the initial volume is 91.97% of the jug, then the empty space is 8.03%. But when it freezes, the volume increases to 100%. So the percentage of the jug that needs to be empty is 8.03%, which would be approximately 8%.

But looking at the options, option A is 8%, option J is 12%, etc.

Wait wait, maybe I did this backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is, what percent should be left empty so that when the water freezes, it fills the jug. So the empty space is the expansion needed.

Let me think in terms of the initial volume of water.

Let me denote:

V_water_initial = initial volume of water in the jug.

V_jug = total volume of the jug.

So the empty space is V_jug - V_water_initial.

When the water freezes, its volume becomes V_water_final = V_water_initial * (density_water / density_ice).

This V_water_final should equal V_jug.

So:

V_water_initial * (density_water / density_ice) = V_jug

We can rearrange this to find V_water_initial = V_jug * (density_ice / density_water)

So the initial volume is V_jug * (0.917 / 0.9971) ≈ 0.9197 * V_jug

So the empty space is V_jug - 0.9197 V_jug = 0.0803 V_jug, which is 8.03% of the jug's volume.

So approximately 8% should be empty. So the correct answer would be option A, 8%.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Compute 0.917 / 0.9971.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 0.917 ÷ 0.9971.

Let me see:

0.9971 × 0.92 = ?

0.9971 × 0.9 = 0.89739

0.9971 × 0.02 = 0.019942

So 0.92 is 0.9 + 0.02 → 0.89739 + 0.019942 = 0.917332.

Oh wait, that's almost exactly 0.917332, which is just a bit over 0.917.

So 0.9971 × 0.92 = approx 0.917332, which is very close to 0.917. So 0.917 / 0.9971 ≈ 0.92, but slightly less.

Wait, because 0.9971 × 0.92 = 0.917332, which is larger than 0.917, so the actual value is 0.92 minus a little.

So to find x where 0.9971 * x = 0.917.

We can approximate it as x ≈ 0.917 / 0.9971 = approx 0.9197.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 0.92, but perhaps a more exact calculation would help.

Let me compute 0.917 ÷ 0.9971.

Using a calculator approach:

0.917 ÷ 0.9971 ≈ ?

Well, 0.9971 is approximately 1. So 0.917 ÷ 1 is 0.917, but since 0.9971 is slightly less than 1, the result is slightly higher than 0.917.

Let me compute 0.917 ÷ 0.9971.

Compute it as 917 ÷ 997.1.

Hmm, 997.1 × 0.917 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate 0.917 / 0.9971.

Let me write this as:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to make it 917 / 9971.

Compute 917 ÷ 9971.

Let me see how many times 9971 goes into 917. Well, it's less than once, so 0. something.

Maybe compute 9971 × 0.92 = ?

Wait, 9971 * 0.9 = 8973.9

9971 * 0.02 = 199.42

So 0.92 × 9971 = 8973.9 + 199.42 = 9173.32, which is larger than 9170. So 0.92 gives 9173.32, which is larger than 9170.

So 0.92 ×9971=9173.32

But we have 917. So 0.92 is too high since 9173 is much bigger than 917.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of 917 ÷ 9971. So 9971 goes into 917 about 0.0918 times.

Wait, 0.0918 times 9971 is 0.0918 * 9971 = let's compute 0.09 *9971= 897.39, 0.0018 *9971≈17.9278. So total is about 897.39 + 17.9278≈915.3178, which is close to 917. So 0.0918 is about 915.3, so 917 would be 0.0918 + (917-915.3178)/(9971) = 0.0918 + 1.6822/9971 ≈ 0.0918 + 0.000169 ≈ 0.091969.

So 0.091969 is approximately 9.197% of 9971, but wait no, 0.091969 is the ratio of 917/9971, which is approximately 0.09197, or 9.197%. Wait, that can't be right because 917 is 91.7% of 1000. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the decimal places.

Wait, no. The actual calculation is 0.917 (density ice) divided by 0.9971 (density water) = approx 0.9197, which is about 91.97%. So the initial volume of water should be 91.97% of the jug's volume. Therefore, the empty space should be 100% -91.97% = 8.03%, which is approximately 8%.

So the correct answer should be A:8%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

The initial volume of water is V_water = m_water / density_water.

The volume after freezing is V_ice = m_water / density_ice.

We want V_ice = V_jug.

So V_jug = (m_water / density_ice).

But V_water = m_water / density_water → m_water = V_water × density_water.

Substituting, V_jug = (V_water × density_water) / density_ice.

So V_water = V_jug × (density_ice / density_water).

Thus, V_water = V_jug × (0.917 / 0.9971) ≈ 0.9197 V_jug.

So the empty space is V_jug - 0.9197 V_jug = 0.0803 V_jug → 8.03%.

Yes, that makes sense. So the percentage to leave empty is approximately 8%, which is option A.
</think>

To determine what percent of a water jug at 25°C should be left empty so that when the water freezes, it fills the jug, we analyze the relationship between the densities of water and ice. The density of water at 25°C is 0.9971 g/cm³, and the density of ice at 0°C is 0.917 g/cm³. Since density is inversely proportional to volume for a given mass, the volume of water increases when it freezes.

Let the total volume of the jug be \( V_{\text{jug}} \), and let \( V_{\text{water}} \) be the initial volume of water. The mass of the water is \( m = V_{\text{water}} \cdot \text{density}_{\text{water}} \). When the water freezes, its volume becomes:

\[
V_{\text{ice}} = \frac{m}{\text{density}_{\text{ice}}} = \frac{V_{\text{water}} \cdot \text{density}_{\text{water}}}{\text{density}_{\text{ice}}}.
\]

For the ice to just fill the jug, \( V_{\text{ice}} = V_{\text{jug}} \). Substituting:

\[
V_{\text{water}} \cdot \frac{\text{density}_{\text{water}}}{\text{density}_{\text{ice}}} = V_{\text{jug}}.
\]

Rearranging for \( V_{\text{water}} \):

\[
V_{\text{water}} = V_{\text{jug}} \cdot \frac{\text{density}_{\text{ice}}}{\text{density}_{\text{water}}}.
\]

Substituting the given densities:

\[
V_{\text{water}} = V_{\text{jug}} \cdot \frac{0.917}{0.9971} \approx V_{\text{jug}} \cdot 0.9197.
\]

This means the initial volume of water should be approximately 91.97% of the jug's total volume. The empty space required is:

\[
V_{\text{empty}} = V_{\text{jug}} - V_{\text{water}} = V_{\text{jug}} - 0.9197 V_{\text{jug}} = 0.0803 V_{\text{jug}}.
\]

Thus, about 8.03% of the jug should be left empty. The closest option is **8%**.
