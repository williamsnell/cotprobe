Question:

Good X is exchanged in a competitive market. Which of the following is true if an excise tax is now imposed on the production of good X?

Options:

A: If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price rises by the amount of the tax.
B: The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is more elastic.
C: Consumer surplus rises as a result of the tax.
D: The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.

Okay, so I have this economics question here about an excise tax imposed on a good in a competitive market. I'm a bit rusty on my microeconomics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which statement is true when an excise tax is imposed on the production of good X. The options are A through D.

First, I remember that an excise tax is a per-unit tax on production. It's different from a sales tax because it's imposed on the producer. So the producer has to pay the tax for each unit they produce. 

I think about how taxes affect supply and demand. When a tax is placed on producers, the supply curve shifts upwards by the amount of the tax. Because producers will only supply the same quantity if they get a higher price to cover the tax. So the supply curve becomes more expensive at every quantity.

Now, the effect on consumers and producers depends on the elasticity of demand and supply. The more elastic the demand, the more the tax burden falls on the producer. If demand is inelastic, consumers end up bearing more of the tax because they can't easily reduce their consumption.

Looking at the options:

Option A: If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price rises by the amount of the tax. Wait, perfectly elastic demand means that any increase in price would lead to zero quantity demanded. So if demand is perfectly elastic, a tax would cause the price to adjust such that the quantity demanded drops a lot. But I'm not sure if the price would rise by the tax amount. Or would the supplier just not supply at all? Hmm, maybe if demand is perfectly elastic, the producer can't pass any tax onto consumers because consumers would just stop buying. So the price wouldn't rise. So A might not be correct.

Option B: The consumer's burden rises as the demand is more elastic. Wait, no, that's the opposite. If demand is more elastic, consumers can adjust more, so the burden is more on producers. Because elastic demand means consumers are sensitive to price changes; they buy less if price goes up. So the incidence of the tax on consumers would be less when demand is elastic. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Consumer surplus rises as a result of the tax. That doesn't make sense. An excise tax should reduce consumer surplus because prices go up or quantity available goes down. So C is wrong.

Option D: The consumer's burden rises as the demand curve is less elastic. Yes, that makes sense. When demand is less elastic (more inelastic), consumers can't easily reduce their consumption, so they end up bearing more of the tax burden. So as demand becomes less elastic, the consumer's burden increases. So D is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. So if demand is inelastic, the tax burden falls more on consumers because they can't reduce buying much. So the more inelastic demand is, the higher the burden on consumers. So option D says that when demand is less elastic, the burden on consumers rises. So yes, D is correct.

So the answer should be D.

When an excise tax is imposed on the production of a good in a competitive market, the supply curve shifts upwards by the amount of the tax. The burden of the tax is distributed between consumers and producers, depending on the elasticity of demand. 

- **Option A**: If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, consumers would reduce their consumption entirely in response to any price increase, meaning producers cannot pass the tax onto consumers. Thus, the price would not rise by the amount of the tax, making this option incorrect.

- **Option B**: If demand is more elastic, consumers are more sensitive to price changes and can reduce their consumption significantly. This means the tax burden falls more on producers, not consumers. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: An excise tax reduces consumer surplus because it leads to higher prices or reduced quantity available. It does not increase consumer surplus, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: When demand is less elastic (more inelastic), consumers are less responsive to price changes and cannot easily reduce their consumption. As a result, they bear a larger portion of the tax burden. This makes Option D correct.

Answer: D
