Okay, so I've got this problem about Ringlet Wholesalers discounting dining sets with a chain discount of 30% and 10%. The total discount offered was $248.40. I need to find the list price and the net price of each set from the given options.

Hmm, chain discounts. I remember that chain discounts are when you have multiple discounts applied one after the other. So it's not just adding them up. Like, if you have 30% and 10%, it's not a 40% discount. Instead, you apply the first discount and then the second on the reduced price.

Right, the formula for the total discount when you have two chain discounts is: 

Total discount = List price × (1 - (1 - d1)(1 - d2))

Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should think about it differently. The net price is the list price after both discounts. So the first discount is 30%, so you pay 70% of the list price. Then the second discount is 10%, so you pay 90% of that already discounted price.

So, Net price = List price × (1 - d1) × (1 - d2). 

In percentages, that's List price × 0.7 × 0.9. Because 30% off means you pay 70%, which is 0.7, and 10% off is 0.9.

But the question gives the discount amount as $248.40, not the net price. So I think I need to relate the discount to the list price.

Wait, the discount is the amount subtracted from the list price to get the net price. So Discount = List price - Net price.

And Net price is List price × 0.7 × 0.9. So Net price = LP × 0.63.

Then, Discount = LP - (LP × 0.63) = LP × (1 - 0.63) = LP × 0.37.

So, 0.37 × LP = $248.40.

So to find LP, I can rearrange that: LP = 248.40 / 0.37.

Let me calculate that. 248.40 divided by 0.37. Hmm, 0.37 times 600 is 222, because 0.37*600=222. 248.40-222=26.40 left. 0.37*70 is 25.9. So 600+70=670, and 26.40-25.9=0.50. 0.37*1.35 is 0.50 (because 0.37*1=0.37, 0.37*0.35=0.13, total 0.50). So total is 670 +1.35= 671.35.

So the list price is $671.35.

Then the net price would be LP × 0.63. Let's compute that: 671.35 × 0.63.

Let me break it down. 600 × 0.63 = 378. 70 × 0.63=44.1, 1.35 × 0.63=0.8505. So adding them up: 378 +44.1=422.1, plus 0.8505 makes 422.9505. So approximately $422.95.

So the list price is $671.35, net price is $422.95.

Looking at the options:

Option F says list $671.35, net $422.95. That matches.

So the correct answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the list price and net price of the dining sets given a chain discount of 30% and 10%, with a total discount of $248.40. 

Chain discounts are applied sequentially, meaning the second discount is applied to the price already reduced by the first discount. The formula for the net price after two discounts is:

\[
\text{Net Price} = \text{List Price} \times (1 - d_1) \times (1 - d_2)
\]

Here, \(d_1 = 0.30\) and \(d_2 = 0.10\), so:

\[
\text{Net Price} = \text{List Price} \times 0.70 \times 0.90 = \text{List Price} \times 0.63
\]

The discount amount is the difference between the list price and the net price:

\[
\text{Discount} = \text{List Price} - \text{Net Price} = \text{List Price} - (\text{List Price} \times 0.63) = \text{List Price} \times 0.37
\]

Given that the discount is $248.40:

\[
0.37 \times \text{List Price} = 248.40
\]

Solving for the list price:

\[
\text{List Price} = \frac{248.40}{0.37} = 671.35
\]

Now, calculate the net price:

\[
\text{Net Price} = 671.35 \times 0.63 = 422.95
\]

Thus, the list price is $671.35, and the net price is $422.95. Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: List price: $671.35, Net price: $422.95**

F
