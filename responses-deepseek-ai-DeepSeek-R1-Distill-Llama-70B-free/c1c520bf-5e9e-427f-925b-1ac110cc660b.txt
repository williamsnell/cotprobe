Okay, so I'm trying to answer this economics question about total utility maximization when purchasing sardines. Hmm, I remember that in economics, utility has to do with the satisfaction a consumer gets from a product. So the question is asking when the total utility is maximized when buying sardines.

The options are A through J. Let me think about each one. 

Total utility is the overall satisfaction from consuming a product. I think the concept of diminishing marginal utility is key here. As you consume more of a good, the additional utility from each extra unit (marginal utility) decreases. So, to maximize total utility, a consumer would keep buying until the marginal utility of the next unit equals the marginal cost. Because if the next unit gives more utility than its cost, you'd buy it. If it's less, you wouldn't.

Wait, so when marginal benefit (which is marginal utility) equals marginal cost, that's the point where the consumer stops. Because beyond that, each additional unit would cost more than the benefit it brings. So the optimal point is where MB=MC.

Looking at the options. Option B says marginal benefit equals marginal cost. Option I says marginal utility equals marginal cost. Wait, aren't marginal benefit and marginal utility the same thing here? Because in consumer choice, marginal benefit is essentially the marginal utility a consumer gets from a product, and marginal cost is what they pay.

Wait, no, in economics, sometimes marginal benefit is considered the next unit's value to the consumer, which might include more than just utility, but in this context, I think they're using them interchangeably. So the correct condition is when marginal benefit (utility) equals marginal cost.

So looking at the options, option B is "marginal benefit equals marginal cost", and option I is "marginal utility equals marginal cost". Are these the same? Or is there a distinction?

Wait, the question is about maximizing total utility, which is a concept tied to marginal utility. So when the additional utility (marginal utility) of the next sardine equals the cost, that's the stopping point. So option I would be correct in that case.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Because in the theory of consumer choice, the consumer maximizes utility when the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods. But in this case, it's about a single good, sardines. So for one good, you'd buy until the marginal utility of the next sardine is equal to its marginal costâ€”in terms of money or what you're giving up.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up marginal cost and price. Because sometimes, the marginal cost is considered the cost of producing one more unit, but for a consumer, the marginal cost is the price they pay for each additional unit. So in consumer choice, the optimal point is where marginal utility equals price. But since price is the marginal cost to the consumer, then it's the same as when marginal utility equals marginal cost.

So the condition is that marginal utility equals marginal cost (price). So looking back, option I is "marginal utility equals marginal cost", which would be the correct condition.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B was the right answer. What's the difference between B and I? Option B is marginal benefit equals marginal cost, and I is marginal utility equals marginal cost.

I think marginal benefit is the same as marginal utility in this context. So B and I are similar. But which one is correct?

Wait, in economics, when we say "marginal benefit", it's often the additional satisfaction, which is marginal utility. So if the question is about utility, then the correct term would be marginal utility. So the answer would be I.

But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes marginal benefit is used interchangeably. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B.

Wait, let's think again. The question asks when total utility is maximized. The consumer should stop when the next unit's marginal utility equals the marginal cost. So the condition is marginal utility equals marginal cost. So option I.

But wait, another thought. The law of diminishing marginal utility says that total utility is maximized when the marginal utility of the last dollar spent equals the marginal utility of spending on other goods. But in this case, it's only about sardines. So perhaps the optimal point is when the marginal utility of sardines equals the price (marginal cost). So the answer would relate to that.

Wait, but the options don't mention price. So the closest is marginal cost. So in that case, option I would be correct.

The question asks when the total utility from purchasing sardines is maximized. In economics, total utility is maximized when the consumer stops purchasing additional units of a good at the point where the marginal utility of the next unit equals its marginal cost. This is because consuming beyond this point would result in the cost exceeding the additional utility gained.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "Total cost equals total benefit" is incorrect because this condition does not directly relate to the maximization of total utility.
- **Option B**: "Marginal benefit equals marginal cost" is a plausible answer, as marginal benefit is often used interchangeably with marginal utility in this context.
- **Option C**: "Consumer surplus is zero" is incorrect because consumer surplus refers to the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay, not the point of utility maximization.
- **Option D**: "Distributive efficiency is achieved" is unrelated to the concept of utility maximization.
- **Option E**: "Marginal utility is zero" is incorrect because utility maximization does not require marginal utility to be zero; it requires marginal utility to equal marginal cost.
- **Option F**: "Consumer demand is at its highest point" is incorrect because demand does not directly determine the point of utility maximization.
- **Option G**: "Price is at its lowest point" is incorrect because utility maximization depends on the relationship between marginal utility and marginal cost, not the absolute price level.
- **Option H**: "Production cost is at its minimum" is irrelevant to consumer utility maximization.
- **Option I**: "Marginal utility equals marginal cost" is correct because this condition directly aligns with the principle of utility maximization.
- **Option J**: "Marginal cost is zero" is incorrect because marginal cost being zero is not a realistic or relevant condition for utility maximization.

While both options B and I are closely related, the question specifically asks about utility, making "marginal utility equals marginal cost" (Option I) the most precise and correct answer.
