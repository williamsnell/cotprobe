Okay, so I have this question about psychosomatic disorders, and I'm a bit new to the topic. Let me try to break it down and think through it step by step.

First, the question is asking what a psychosomatic disorder is, how it's induced, and for some examples. The options are from A to J, so I need to go through each one carefully.

I remember that the term "psychosomatic" combines "psyche" (mind) and "soma" (body), so it's something related to both mental and physical aspects. I think psychosomatic disorders are physical symptoms that are influenced by psychological factors. Like, when someone is stressed and gets a stomachache, maybe that's psychosomatic.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's an illness where symptoms are produced for personal gain. That sounds more like factitious disorder or malingering. So A is probably not correct.

Option B mentions cognitive impairments like memory loss. That seems more like a neurological or mental disorder, not necessarily something with physical symptoms caused by psychological stress. So B might not be right.

Option C talks about a chronic disorder without recognizable symptoms but with psychological origins. Doesn't that sound more like something like neurosis or maybe a somatoform disorder? I'm not sure, but I think psychosomatic usually has physical symptoms, so C might not fit.

Option D says it's a disease cured by psychological treatment. Well, some psychosomatic disorders might be treatable with psychotherapy, but not all. Also, the question is about the definition and cause, not the cure. So D might not be the best choice.

Option E describes it as a bodily disturbance caused or worsened by psychological stress, with examples like ulcers, high blood pressure, asthma, etc. That sounds familiar. These are physical conditions that can be influenced by stress and mental state. So E looks promising.

Option F attributes it solely to environmental factors without psychological involvement, but that's the opposite of what psychosomatic is. F doesn't seem correct.

Option G is about mental disorders caused by physical illness. That's more like when a physical condition leads to mental issues, maybe something else, not psychosomatic.

Option H says the problem occurs spontaneously without stress. That doesn't fit because psychosomatic is stress-related. So H is out.

Option I is about mental illnesses with emotional symptoms. That's more like anxiety or depression themselves, not the physical symptoms part. So I isn't right.

Option J says it's a physical illness with no known cause. That's not accurate because psychosomatic has a known psychological component.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. It correctly defines psychosomatic disorders as physical issues caused or worsened by psychological stress, and the examples make sense. Conditions like peptic ulcers and high blood pressure are often linked to stress.
