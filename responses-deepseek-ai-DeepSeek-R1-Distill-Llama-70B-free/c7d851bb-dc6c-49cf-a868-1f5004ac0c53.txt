Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the equilibrium pressure of O2 over solid silver and silver oxide (Ag₂O) at 298 K is 11.85 Pa. I need to calculate the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Ag₂O(s) at that temperature. The options are given from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) is related to the equilibrium constant (K) of a reaction. The formula that connects them is ΔG° = -RT ln K. So that's the starting point.

First, I need to write the reaction for the formation of Ag₂O. The standard formation reaction would be:

2 Ag(s) + ½ O₂(g) → Ag₂O(s)

Right, because the standard Gibbs energy of formation is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So silver is a solid, oxygen is a gas here.

At equilibrium, the pressure of O₂ is given as 11.85 Pa. Wait, but standard pressure is 1 bar, which is 100,000 Pa. So I think I'll need to convert this pressure into a relative value, like in terms of the standard pressure.

Wait, the equilibrium expression for K would involve the partial pressure of O₂. Since the reaction is in the solid state except for O₂, the activity of solids is 1, so the K expression is based on the partial pressure of O₂.

So Kp for this reaction would be (activity of Ag₂O) / [ (activity of Ag)^2 * (P_O2 / P°)^(1/2) ) ]

But since Ag and Ag₂O are solids, their activities are 1. So the expression simplifies to:

Kp = 1 / ( (P_O2 / P° )^(1/2) )

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is 2 Ag(s) + ½ O₂(g) → Ag₂O(s). So the K expression is [Ag₂O]/([Ag]^2 [O₂]^½ ). But Ag and Ag₂O are solids, so their activities are 1. So K = 1 / (P_O2^½ / P°^½ ) )

So that simplifies to K = (P° / P_O2 )^(1/2 )

Wait, let me double-check. No, because the reaction is written as forming Ag₂O from Ag and O₂. So the K would be products/reactants. So in terms of pressure, it's [Ag₂O] is 1, divided by (1^2 * (P_O2)^½ / (P°)^½ )

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as K = (P° / P_O₂ )^(1/2 )

Because for the reaction, the O₂ is a reactant, so its pressure is in the denominator. So K would be (1) / ( (P_O2 / P° )^(1/2) ) )

So solving for K, K = (P° / P_O2 )^(1/2 )

Wait, but P° is standard pressure, which is 1 bar = 10^5 Pa. The given P_O2 is 11.85 Pa, which is much less than P°, so K would be larger than 1.

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting this right. Let me write the expression again:

The reaction is 2 Ag(s) + (1/2) O₂(g) → Ag₂O(s)

The equilibrium expression K is [Ag₂O]/( [Ag]^2 [O₂]^(1/2) )

Since [Ag₂O] and [Ag] are 1, K = 1 / [O₂]^(1/2 )

But wait, the standard state for O₂ is 1 bar, so the activity is (P_O2 / P° ), right? So the expression becomes:

K = 1 / ( (P_O2 / P° )^(1/2) )

Which is the same as K = (P° / P_O2 )^(1/2 )

Wait, that makes sense because if the pressure of O₂ is lower, K is larger, meaning the reaction is more product-favored, which is the case here since P_O2 is low.

So substituting the values: P° is 1e5 Pa, and P_O2 is 11.85 Pa.

So K = (1e5 / 11.85 )^(1/2 )

Let me calculate that. First, 1e5 / 11.85 is approximately 8441.548. Then the square root of that is sqrt(8441.548). Let me compute that.

Well, sqrt(8100) is 90, sqrt(8400)=91.65 (since 91^2 is 8281 and 92^2 is 8464). So 8441 is a bit less than 8464, so sqrt(8441.548) is approximately 91.88.

So K ≈ 91.88.

Now, the Gibbs free energy is calculated using ΔG° = -RT ln K.

I know R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T is 298 K.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔG° = - (8.314) * (298) * ln(91.88 )

First, calculate ln(91.88). Let me see, ln(100) is about 4.605, so ln(91.88) is a bit less. Let's approximate it.

Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately. Let me think:

e^4 = 54.598, e^4.5 = 90.017. Oh, wait, 4.5 is about 90. So 4.5 is e^4.5 ≈ 90.017. So 91.88 is a bit higher.

So ln(91.88) ≈ 4.517.

Wait, wait, let me check: 4.5 gives 90.017, so 4.51 would be higher.

Compute 4.51: e^4.51 = ?

Well, e^0.01 is approximately 1.01005.

So e^4.5 is 90.017, e^4.51 = 90.017 * 1.01005 ≈ 90.017 * 1.01 = 90.917. Hmm, but 4.51 gives around 90.917, which is lower than 91.88.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator-like approach isn't efficient. Let me just note that ln(91.88) is approximately 4.517.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me use the formula ln(a) ≈ ln(90) + (a-90)/90, using a linear approximation around a=90.

Wait, let me think: f(x) = ln(x), f'(x) = 1/x.

At x=90, f(90)= ln(90)=4.4998. The actual value is about 4.4998, and f'(90)=1/90≈0.01111.

So for x=91.88, which is 1.88 above 90.

So using linear approximation, ln(91.88) ≈ ln(90) + (1.88)/90 = 4.4998 + 0.02089 ≈ 4.5207.

So approximately 4.5207.

So ln(91.88) ≈ 4.5207.

So now, plug into ΔG°:

ΔG° = - (8.314) * (298) * 4.5207

Compute each step:

First, multiply 8.314 * 298:

8.314 * 300 = 2494.2, but subtract 8.314 * 2 = 16.628, so 2494.2 - 16.628= 2477.572.

So 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.57 J/mol.

Now multiply by 4.5207: 2477.57 * 4.5207.

Let me compute that step by step.

2477.57 *4 = 9910.28

2477.57 * 0.5 = 1238.785

2477.57 * 0.0207 = let's see: 0.02 is 49.551, 0.0007 is approx 1.734, so total about 51.285.

So adding all together: 9910.28 + 1238.785 = 11149.065, plus 51.285 gives 11200.35.

So approximately 11,200 J/mol.

So ΔG° = -11200 J/mol, which is -11.2 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have -11.2. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: -12.7 kJ/mol

B: -8.4

C: -13.9

D:-10.8

E: -7.1

F: -10.3

G: -15.3

H: -9.5

I: -14.5

J: -11.2

Oh, option J is -11.2 kJ/mol. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in the approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more precisely without approximation.

Let me compute ln(91.88) more accurately.

Using a calculator approach: 91.88.

I know that e^4.5 = 90.017.

So 4.5 gives 90.017. We need to find x where e^x =91.88.

The difference between 91.88 and 90.017 is 1.863.

So, using the Taylor series around x=4.5:

e^(4.5 + δ) = e^4.5 * e^δ ≈ 90.017 (1 + δ + δ²/2 )

Set this equal to 91.88:

90.017 (1 + δ + δ²/2 ) = 91.88

Divide both sides by 90.017:

1 + δ + δ²/2 ≈ 91.88 / 90.017 ≈ 1.0216

So, 1 + δ + δ²/2 ≈ 1.0216

Subtract 1: δ + δ²/2 ≈ 0.0216

Assume δ is small, so δ²/2 is negligible. So δ ≈ 0.0216.

So x ≈ 4.5 + 0.0216 =4.5216.

So ln(91.88) ≈4.5216.

So, more accurately, it's about 4.5216.

Now, compute ΔG°:

ΔG° = - (8.314) * 298 * 4.5216

Compute 8.314 *298 = let's be precise.

8 * 298 = 2384

0.314 *298 = 0.3*298=89.4; 0.014*298≈4.172 → total 93.572.

So 8.314*298=2384+93.572=2477.572 J/mol·K * K = J/mol.

Now multiply by 4.5216:

2477.572 *4.5216.

Hmm, perhaps breaking it down:

2477.572 ×4 = 9910.288

2477.572 ×0.5 = 1238.786

2477.572 ×0.0216 ≈ let's compute 2477.572 *0.02 =49.55144 and 2477.572 *0.0016= approx 3.96411. So total ≈53.51555.

Adding all three parts:

9910.288 +1238.786 =11149.074

11149.074 +53.51555 ≈112202.59?

Wait, wait, no: 9910.288 +1238.786 = 11149.074.

Adding 53.51555 gives 11149.074 +53.51555 =11202.5895 J/mol.

So ΔG° = -11202.5895 J/mol → approximately -11203 J/mol → -11.2 kJ/mol.

Which matches option J.

So the correct answer should be J: -11.2 kJ/mol.

To calculate the standard Gibbs energy of formation of $\mathrm{Ag}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$, we start with the relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G^\circ$) and the equilibrium constant ($K$):

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K
\]

The formation reaction for $\mathrm{Ag}_2\mathrm{O}$ is:

\[
2 \mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{s}) + \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ag}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})
\]

At equilibrium, the equilibrium constant $K$ is expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{1}{\left(P_{\mathrm{O}_2} / P^\circ\right)^{1/2}}
\]

Here, $P^\circ = 1 \mathrm{~bar} = 10^5 \mathrm{~Pa}$ (standard pressure), and $P_{\mathrm{O}_2} = 11.85 \mathrm{~Pa}$ (equilibrium pressure of $\mathrm{O}_2$). Substituting these values:

\[
K = \left(\frac{P^\circ}{P_{\mathrm{O}_2}}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\frac{10^5}{11.85}\right)^{1/2}
\]

First, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{10^5}{11.85} \approx 8441.55
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
K = \sqrt{8441.55} \approx 91.88
\]

Next, calculate $\Delta G^\circ$ using $R = 8.314 \mathrm{~J~mol^{-1}~K^{-1}}$ and $T = 298 \mathrm{~K}$:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K
\]

The natural logarithm of $K$ is:

\[
\ln(91.88) \approx 4.5216
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -(8.314)(298)(4.5216)
\]

First, calculate $8.314 \times 298$:

\[
8.314 \times 298 \approx 2477.57 \mathrm{~J~mol^{-1}}
\]

Now multiply by $4.5216$:

\[
2477.57 \times 4.5216 \approx 11202.59 \mathrm{~J~mol^{-1}}
\]

Convert to kJ:

\[
\Delta G^\circ \approx -11.2 \mathrm{~kJ~mol^{-1}}
\]

Thus, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of $\mathrm{Ag}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})$ is approximately $-11.2 \mathrm{~kJ~mol^{-1}}$, which corresponds to option **J**.

Answer: J
