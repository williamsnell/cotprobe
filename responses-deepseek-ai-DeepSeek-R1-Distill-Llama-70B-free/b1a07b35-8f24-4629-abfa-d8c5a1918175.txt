Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to calculate the average number of coin tosses until two consecutive heads appear. The probability of getting heads each toss is 3/7. Hmm, I remember that problems like this often use something called Markov chains or maybe recursive equations. Let me think about how to approach it.

Wait, the problem is asking for the expected number of tosses. So I think I should model this with states. The states would represent the current situation in terms of consecutive heads. Let's see:

- State S0: No heads in a row. This is the starting state.
- State S1: One head in a row.
- State S2: Two consecutive heads, which is the absorbing state where the experiment ends.

So, the process starts in S0. Each toss can lead to a transition between states. Let’s define E0 as the expected number of tosses from S0, and E1 as the expected number from S1.

From S0:
- If I toss a head (probability 3/7), I move to S1. Then I've used one toss, and the expected tosses from S1 is E1.
- If I toss a tail (probability 4/7), I stay in S0, having used one toss, and still expect E0 more tosses.

So the equation for E0 would be:
E0 = (3/7)*(1 + E1) + (4/7)*(1 + E0)

From S1:
- If I toss a head (probability 3/7), I reach S2, which ends the experiment. So that's one more toss, and we're done.
- If I toss a tail (probability 4/7), I go back to S0, having used one toss, and then expect E0 more tosses.

So the equation for E1 is:
E1 = (3/7)*(1) + (4/7)*(1 + E0)

Wait, let me double-check. From S1, if I get another head, I'm done. So that contributes (3/7)*1. If I get a tail, I go back to S0, which adds 1 toss and then the expectation E0. So yes, E1 = (3/7)*1 + (4/7)*(1 + E0).

Now I need to solve these equations. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: E0 = (3/7)(1 + E1) + (4/7)(1 + E0)
Equation 2: E1 = (3/7)(1) + (4/7)(1 + E0)

Let me simplify Equation 1 first. Expanding the terms:

E0 = (3/7) + (3/7)E1 + (4/7) + (4/7)E0

Combine like terms:

E0 = (3/7 + 4/7) + (3/7 E1) + (4/7 E0)
E0 = 1 + (3/7)E1 + (4/7)E0

Subtract (4/7)E0 from both sides:

E0 - (4/7)E0 = 1 + (3/7)E1

(3/7)E0 = 1 + (3/7)E1

Multiply both sides by 7/3 to simplify:

E0 = (7/3)*1 + E1
So, E0 = 7/3 + E1

Wait, that's an important relation: E0 = 7/3 + E1.

Now, let's look at Equation 2. Let's expand it:

E1 = 3/7 + (4/7)(1 + E0)
E1 = 3/7 + 4/7 + (4/7)E0
E1 = (3/7 + 4/7) + (4/7)E0
E1 = 1 + (4/7)E0

Now, substitute E0 from the earlier relation into this equation. Since E0 = 7/3 + E1, substitute that into E1 = 1 + (4/7)E0.

So:

E1 = 1 + (4/7)(7/3 + E1)

Let me compute this:

First, 4/7 * 7/3 is (4 *7)/(7*3) )= 4/3. So:

E1 = 1 + 4/3 + (4/7)E1

Combine the constants:

1 + 4/3 = 7/3

So:

E1 = 7/3 + (4/7)E1

Subtract (4/7)E1 from both sides:

E1 - (4/7)E1 = 7/3

(3/7)E1 = 7/3

Multiply both sides by 7/3:

E1 = (7/3) * (7/3) = 49/9

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the math again.

Wait wait, let's re-express:

From E1 = 1 + (4/7)E0, and E0 = 7/3 + E1.

So substituting E0 into E1 equation:

E1 = 1 + (4/7)(7/3 + E1) 

Calculate (4/7)(7/3):

(4 * 7)/(7 *3) ) → 4/3.

So:

E1 = 1 + 4/3 + (4/7)E1

1 + 4/3 is (3/3 +4/3) =7/3.

So E1 =7/3 + (4/7) E1

Subtract (4/7)E1 from both sides:

E1 - (4/7)E1 =7/3 → (3/7) E1 =7/3

Multiply both sides by 7/3:

E1= (7/3) * (7/3) → 49/9 ≈5.444...

Wait, that's 5 and 4/9, which is about 5.444. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if E1 is about 5.44, then E0 is 7/3 + E1 = 2.333 +5.444=7.777, which is around 7.78. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly that. Oh wait, option I is 7.77778.

Wait, the expected number of tosses would be E0, right? Because we start in state S0. So E0 is the answer.

Wait, but according to this, E0 is 7/3 + E1. And E1 is 49/9. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, E1 = 49/9 = 5.4444...

E0 = 7/3 + 49/9 = (21/9 +49/9) )=70/9 ≈7.7778...

Which is option I:7.77778.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equations. Let me re-express the equations.

Alternative approach: Let me denote E0 as the expected number of tosses starting from S0, E1 from S1.

When in S0, you toss once. With p=3/7, you get a head and move to S1. With 4/7, you get a tail and stay in S0.

E0 = 1 + (3/7) E1 + (4/7) E0

Similarly, in S1, you toss once. With p=3/7, you reach S2 (end), so that contributes (3/7)*0 (since no more tosses needed). Wait no, wait: E1 is the expected number of additional tosses from S1. So if you get a head, you're done, so you have 1 toss. Wait, no: when you're in S1, you toss once. If it's a head, you're done, so that's just 1 toss. If it's a tail, you go back to S0, adding 1 + E0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express E1 correctly.

When in S1, you toss the coin:

- Heads (3/7): you reach S2. So the number of tosses added is 1 (this toss) and then you're done. So that contributes (3/7)*1.

- Tails (4/7): you go back to S0, so you have 1 toss plus whatever is expected from S0. So (4/7)*(1 + E0).

So E1 = (3/7)*1 + (4/7)*(1 + E0)

Wait, that's correct, and that's what I had earlier.

So the equations are correct.

So solving:

E1 = 3/7 + (4/7)(1 + E0) → E1 = 3/7 +4/7 + (4/7)E0 → E1 =1 + (4/7)E0

And E0 = 1 + (3/7) E1 + (4/7) E0 → E0 = 1 + (3/7) E1 + (4/7) E0 → E0 - (4/7) E0 =1 + (3/7)E1 → (3/7) E0 =1 + (3/7)E1 → E0 = (7/3) [1 + (3/7) E1 ] → E0=7/3 + E1

Wait, perhaps an alternative way to substitute.

Let me substitute E0 from the first equation into the second.

From E0 =7/3 + E1 → E1 = E0 -7/3

Substitute into E1=1 + (4/7)E0:

E0 -7/3 =1 + (4/7) E0

Bring all terms to left:

E0 -7/3 -1 - (4/7)E0 =0 → E0 (1 -4/7) - (7/3 +1 )=0 → E0*(3/7) - (10/3 )=0 → (3/7)E0 =10/3 → E0= (10/3 )*(7/3 )=70/9 ≈7.777...

Yes, which is 7 and 7/9, approximately 7.77778. So the answer would be option I:7.77778.

Looking back at the options:

I:7.77778.

So the correct answer should be I.

To calculate the average number of coin tosses required until two consecutive heads appear, we model the problem using states and recursive equations. Define the following states:

- **S0**: No consecutive heads (starting state).
- **S1**: One consecutive head.
- **S2**: Two consecutive heads (absorbing state where the experiment ends).

Let **E0** represent the expected number of tosses starting from S0, and **E1** represent the expected number of tosses starting from S1. The equations for these expectations are derived as follows:

### From S0:
- Toss a head (probability = 3/7): Move to S1, contributing \(1 + E1\).
- Toss a tail (probability = 4/7): Stay in S0, contributing \(1 + E0\).

Thus, the equation for \(E0\) is:
\[
E0 = \frac{3}{7}(1 + E1) + \frac{4}{7}(1 + E0)
\]

### From S1:
- Toss a head (probability = 3/7): Reach S2, contributing \(1\) (since the experiment ends).
- Toss a tail (probability = 4/7): Return to S0, contributing \(1 + E0\).

Thus, the equation for \(E1\) is:
\[
E1 = \frac{3}{7}(1) + \frac{4}{7}(1 + E0)
\]

### Solving the Equations:
1. Simplify \(E0\):
\[
E0 = \frac{3}{7}(1 + E1) + \frac{4}{7}(1 + E0)
\]
\[
E0 = 1 + \frac{3}{7}E1 + \frac{4}{7}E0
\]
\[
E0 - \frac{4}{7}E0 = 1 + \frac{3}{7}E1
\]
\[
\frac{3}{7}E0 = 1 + \frac{3}{7}E1
\]
\[
E0 = \frac{7}{3} + E1
\]

2. Simplify \(E1\):
\[
E1 = \frac{3}{7}(1) + \frac{4}{7}(1 + E0)
\]
\[
E1 = \frac{3}{7} + \frac{4}{7} + \frac{4}{7}E0
\]
\[
E1 = 1 + \frac{4}{7}E0
\]

3. Substitute \(E0 = \frac{7}{3} + E1\) into \(E1 = 1 + \frac{4}{7}E0\):
\[
E1 = 1 + \frac{4}{7}\left(\frac{7}{3} + E1\right)
\]
\[
E1 = 1 + \frac{4}{3} + \frac{4}{7}E1
\]
\[
E1 - \frac{4}{7}E1 = \frac{7}{3}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{7}E1 = \frac{7}{3}
\]
\[
E1 = \frac{7}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{3} = \frac{49}{9} \approx 5.444
\]

4. Substitute \(E1 = \frac{49}{9}\) into \(E0 = \frac{7}{3} + E1\):
\[
E0 = \frac{7}{3} + \frac{49}{9}
\]
\[
E0 = \frac{21}{9} + \frac{49}{9} = \frac{70}{9} \approx 7.777
\]

### Conclusion:
The expected number of tosses starting from S0 is \(E0 = \frac{70}{9} \approx 7.777\). This matches option **I: 7.77778**.
