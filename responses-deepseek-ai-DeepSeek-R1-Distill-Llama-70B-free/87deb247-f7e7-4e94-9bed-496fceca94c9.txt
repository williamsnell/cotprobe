Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Cicero's claim. The question is asking which doctrine Cicero considered the most pernicious. The options are A through J, each presenting a different idea. 

First, I need to recall what I know about Cicero and his philosophical views. Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman, and he wrote a lot about ethics and moral philosophy. I remember that he was particularly concerned with issues related to moral relativism and the idea that actions could be justified by expediency rather than moral principles.

Looking at the question, the key part is identifying which doctrine Cicero found most harmful. The question mentions that the doctrine claims there's no more pernicious idea than the one presented. So I need to think about what Cicero opposed strongly.

Option A: Acting against one's principles sometimes. That sounds like it could be bad, but I'm not sure if this is the main point Cicero was against.

Option B: It's sometimes permissible to lie. Cicero might have had something to say about honesty, but I'm not certain this is his main issue here.

Option C: Moral rightness is relative to culture. That's moral relativism. I think Cicero was against this because he believed in a more universal moral law, not something that varies by culture.

Option D: Morality is subjective and changeable based on personal preferences. This is similar to C, but more about individual subjectivity rather than culture. Cicero might have opposed this as well, but I'm not sure if this is the exact point he was making in the quote.

Option E: A thing may be expedient without being morally right. This sounds familiar. I think Cicero argued against the idea that expediency (what's useful or practical) should take precedence over moral rightness. He believed that what's expedient can sometimes conflict with what's morally right, and that prioritizing expediency leads to moral decay.

Option F: Lying is always wrong. This is a strong stance, but I'm not sure if Cicero said this specific thing was the most pernicious doctrine.

Option G: Actions don't have consequences. That seems unlikely because consequences are a natural part of actions, and Cicero would probably agree that actions do have consequences.

Option H: The gods don't care what we do. This is a theological point, but the question seems more about ethical doctrines than theology.

Option I: No absolute truth. This is about truth relativism, which is different from moral relativism. Cicero might have opposed this, but I'm not certain it's the main point here.

Option J: The gods are indifferent to human affairs. Similar to H, this is about the gods' involvement, which I don't think is the focus of the question.

So narrowing it down, the key is whether it's about moral relativism (C or D) or the conflict between expediency and morality (E). I recall that Cicero, especially in his work "On the Republic," discusses the idea that the state or individuals should not prioritize expediency over justice. He argues that what is expedient can be opposed to what is morally right, and that the latter should take precedence.

Wait, but the question is about a doctrine that Cicero found pernicious. So if the doctrine is that "a thing may be expedient without being morally right," that suggests that expediency can justify actions even if they're not morally right. Cicero would oppose this because he believed that true expediency aligns with morality in the long run.

Alternatively, the option E says that a thing may be expedient without being morally right. So the doctrine is that expediency doesn't necessarily imply moral rightness. But Cicero's stance was against the idea that expediency can override morality, so he would find that doctrine dangerous because it could lead people to act immorally for what they think is practical.

Wait, but another angle: the question is phrased as the doctrine that Cicero claims is pernicious. So which of these is the doctrine he's attacking?

I think the correct answer is E: a thing may be expedient without being morally right. Because Cicero argues that what is expedient (useful) is often confused with what is morally right, and that separating them can lead to moral compromise. He believed that true expediency and moral rightness should align, and that acting against this leads to negative consequences.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be E.

The question asks which doctrine Cicero considered the most pernicious. Cicero, a Roman philosopher, was known for his strong stance against moral relativism and the prioritization of expediency over moral principles. Among the options provided, the key lies in identifying the doctrine Cicero found most harmful.

Option E states that "a thing may be expedient without being morally right." This aligns with Cicero's arguments against the idea that expediency can justify actions that are not morally right. He believed that true expediency and moral rightness should ultimately align and that separating them could lead to moral decay. This makes E the correct choice.

Answer: E
