Okay, so I've got this question about the production possibilities frontier (PPF) and opportunity cost. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is asking: When opportunity cost is constant across all production levels, what shape is the PPF? The options are A through J, each describing a different shape.

I remember that the PPF shows the maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced. The shape of the PPF is related to the concept of opportunity cost. So if opportunity cost is constant, that must mean something specific about the trade-offs when producing more of one good.

Wait, opportunity cost is the cost of producing one more unit of a good in terms of the other. If it's constant, then producing each additional unit requires giving up the same number of units of the other good. That sounds like a linear situation because the cost doesn't change as production changes.

So, when opportunity cost is constant, the PPF should be a straight line. But wait, let me think again. The PPF is usually drawn as a curve, like a concave (or convex) shape, which implies increasing or decreasing opportunity costs. But if the opportunity cost is constant, the PPF would be a straight line, right?

So looking at the options, I need to find which option describes a straight line. Let's go through the options:

A: Irregular zig-zag. No, that doesn't sound right for constant costs.

B: Concave to origin. That's the usual case with increasing opportunity costs, so probably not.

C: Straight horizontal line. Wait, a horizontal line would mean that producing more of one good doesn't affect the other, which doesn't fit with opportunity cost being constant across all levels. Because if you produce more, you should have to give up some of the other.

D: Convex to origin. That's when opportunity costs are increasing, so the PPF curves outward.

E: Curved line upward. That suggests increasing costs, so again, not constant.

F: Straight vertical line. That would imply that production of one good is fixed, regardless of the other, which doesn't fit constant opportunity cost.

G: Straight diagonal sloping upward from left to right. Wait, a diagonal line? Let me think. If the PPF is a straight line, it would mean that the opportunity cost is constant. So, for example, if you can produce combinations where each additional unit of Good A costs you one unit of Good B, the PPF would be a straight line with a negative slope. Or wait, in typical graphs, the PPF is plotted with Good A on the x-axis and Good B on the y-axis. So if producing more A requires a constant sacrifice of B, the PPF would slope downward, right? Because as A increases, B decreases.

Wait, no, because if you're moving along the PPF, increasing production of one good means decreasing the other. So the line would slope downward from left to right. But looking at the options, what do they say?

Option G is a straight diagonal line sloping upward from left to right. That would imply that as Good A increases, Good B also increases, which doesn't make sense because if you're producing more of one, the other should decrease.

Option H is a straight diagonal line sloping downward from right to left. Wait, that's the same as sloping upward from left to right but just reversed. No, actually, if you go from right to left, it's the same as the other direction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct PPF for constant opportunity cost is a straight line with a negative slope, meaning it goes from top left to bottom right. So like, starting high on Good B when Good A is low, and then as Good A increases, Good B decreases.

Looking at the options again, option I says a straight diagonal line sloping downward from left to right. That would mean starting from the top left, going down as you move right. That fits the scenario where producing more A means less B, with constant cost.

Wait, but earlier I thought option G was upward from left to right, which doesn't fit. So the correct answer should be option I.

Wait another thing, I might be mixing up the axes. Let's say Good A is on the x-axis and Good B on the y-axis. If the PPF is a straight line sloping downward, that means as x increases, y decreases. So the line starts at (0, max B) and goes to (max A, 0). That's a straight line with a negative slope, which would be a diagonal line sloping downward from left to right. So yes, option I is that.

So the options are:

G: upward from left to right (positive slope)
I: downward from left to right (negative slope)

Yes, so the correct answer is I.

When opportunity cost is constant across all production levels, the production possibilities frontier (PPF) is a straight line. This is because constant opportunity cost implies that the trade-off between producing one more unit of one good and the other remains the same at all production levels. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, E**: These describe curved or irregular shapes, which are inconsistent with constant opportunity cost.
- **C, F**: These describe horizontal or vertical lines, which do not reflect the trade-offs between two goods.
- **G**: A straight diagonal line sloping upward from left to right implies that producing more of one good allows for more of the other, which contradicts the concept of opportunity cost.
- **H**: A straight diagonal line sloping downward from right to left is equivalent to a line sloping upward from left to right, which also does not fit.
- **I**: A straight diagonal line sloping downward from left to right correctly represents the PPF when opportunity cost is constant. As production of one good increases, production of the other decreases, reflecting a constant trade-off.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**.
