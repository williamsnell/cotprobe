Okay, so I have this problem here about water freezing, and I need to calculate the heat evolved. Hmm, let me think. The question says that at constant pressure and a temperature of -10°C, water freezes. Wait, but wait, water usually freezes at 0°C, right? So why is it freezing at -10 here? Oh, maybe it's supercooled or something. But I don't think that affects the calculation directly.

The reaction given is H2O(l) turning into H2O(s). And the data provided is ΔH_273 = -79.7 cal g^-1. Wait, what's ΔH_273? Oh, I think that's the enthalpy change at the melting point, which is 0°C or 273 K. So at 0°C, water freezes, and the enthalpy change is -79.7 cal/g. That makes sense because freezing is exothermic, so the value is negative.

But in this problem, the temperature is -10°C, which is 263 K. So the process isn't happening at the standard melting point. I remember that when a process occurs at a different temperature, we might need to account for the heat capacity changes. Because the temperature is lower, the heat released (or absorbed) won't just be the ΔH at 273 K; it'll have an additional term based on the temperature difference and the heat capacities of liquid and solid water.

Wait, the problem gives me the heat capacities. Cp for liquid water is 1.00 cal/(K·g), and for solid (ice) it's 0.49 cal/(K·g). So to find the total heat evolved, I need to calculate two parts: the heat released when the water cools from 0°C to -10°C as a liquid, and then the heat released when it freezes at 0°C, but wait no, because the freezing is happening at -10°C. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait no, actually, when water is at -10°C and it freezes, it's going from liquid at -10 to solid at -10. But the standard enthalpy of freezing is given at 0°C. So to calculate the heat at -10°C, I think I need to adjust the standard ΔH using the heat capacities.

So the total heat change (q) would be the heat released in two steps:

1. Cooling the liquid water from 0°C to -10°C.
2. Freezing the water at -10°C.

Wait, but no, because the freezing is happening at a lower temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to think of it as the heat change when going from liquid at -10°C to solid at -10°C, which would involve calculating the enthalpy difference between these two states.

The formula I remember is that the enthalpy at a different temperature can be found using the heat capacities. So the overall enthalpy change ΔH_total would be the standard ΔH at 0°C plus the heat change due to the temperature difference.

Wait, more accurately, the enthalpy change when the process occurs at T2 instead of T1 is given by:

ΔH_total = ΔH_T1 + (T2 - T1) * (Cp_liquid - Cp_solid) * mass

Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think. Since the process is freezing at a lower temperature, the enthalpy change at T2 (263 K) can be calculated from the standard enthalpy at T1 (273 K) using the heat capacities.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of the liquid at T2 is H_liquid(T2) = H_liquid(T1) + Cp_liquid*(T2 - T1). Similarly, the enthalpy of the solid at T2 is H_solid(T2) = H_solid(T1) + Cp_solid*(T2 - T1). Then the enthalpy change for freezing at T2 is H_solid(T2) - H_liquid(T2). 

But since H_solid(T1) - H_liquid(T1) is ΔH_273 = -79.7 cal/g, we can express H_solid(T2) - H_liquid(T2) as ΔH_273 + (Cp_solid - Cp_liquid)*(T2 - T1). Because:

H_solid(T2) - H_liquid(T2) = [H_solid(T1) + Cp_solid*(T2-T1)] - [H_liquid(T1) + Cp_liquid*(T2-T1)] 
= [H_solid(T1) - H_liquid(T1)] + (Cp_solid - Cp_liquid)(T2 - T1)
= ΔH_273 + (Cp_solid - Cp_liquid)(ΔT)

So the total heat evolved would be this value. Let me plug in the numbers.

ΔH_273 is -79.7 cal/g.

Cp_solid is 0.49 cal/(K·g), Cp_liquid is 1.00 cal/(K·g). So Cp_solid - Cp_liquid is 0.49 - 1.00 = -0.51 cal/(K·g).

The temperature change ΔT is T2 - T1. Wait, T1 is 273 K (0°C), T2 is 263 K (-10°C). So ΔT = 263 - 273 = -10 K.

Putting it all together:

ΔH_total = (-79.7 cal/g) + (-0.51 cal/(K·g)) * (-10 K)

Calculate the second term: -0.51 * (-10) = +5.1 cal/g.

So ΔH_total = -79.7 + 5.1 = -74.6 cal/g.

Looking at the options, option J is -74.6 cal/g. So the answer should be J.

To calculate the heat evolved when water freezes at -10°C, we need to account for two contributions:

1. **The standard enthalpy change of freezing at 0°C (ΔH_273):** This is given as -79.7 cal/g, which represents the heat released when water freezes at its melting point.

2. **The temperature correction due to the heat capacities of liquid and solid water:** Since the process occurs at -10°C (263 K), we must adjust the standard enthalpy change using the heat capacities of water in its liquid and solid states. The heat capacities are:

   - \( C_p \, (\text{liquid}) = 1.00 \, \text{cal/(K·g)} \)
   - \( C_p \, (\text{solid}) = 0.49 \, \text{cal/(K·g)} \)

   The temperature difference is \( \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 263 \, \text{K} - 273 \, \text{K} = -10 \, \text{K} \).

   The correction term is calculated as:
   \[
   \Delta H_{\text{correction}} = (C_p \, \text{solid} - C_p \, \text{liquid}) \cdot \Delta T
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta H_{\text{correction}} = (0.49 - 1.00) \cdot (-10) = -0.51 \cdot (-10) = +5.1 \, \text{cal/g}
   \]

3. **Total enthalpy change at -10°C:** The total heat evolved is the sum of the standard enthalpy change and the correction term:
   \[
   \Delta H_{\text{total}} = \Delta H_{273} + \Delta H_{\text{correction}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta H_{\text{total}} = -79.7 + 5.1 = -74.6 \, \text{cal/g}
   \]

Thus, the heat evolved when water freezes at -10°C is **-74.6 cal/g**, which corresponds to option **J**.
