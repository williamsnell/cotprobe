Question:

A man placed the following advertisement in his local newspaper:"Public Auction Sale . . . without reserve December 7, 10:00 a. m. 110 Walnut St. , City, StateEntire furnishings of home must go: antiques, piano, pool table, appliances, tables, stereo system, etc. "On the morning of December 7, a group of approximately 20 people showed up at the man's home. The first item the man put up for bid was an antique Baldwin grand piano. The man announced that the bidding would be "without reserve" and said, "What's the opening bid on this beautiful Baldwin grand piano?" A woman opened the bidding with $100. The man then commented, "This piano is worth at least $5,000. What other bids am I offered?" When the man did not receive any other bids, he informed the woman that he would not accept $100 and was removing the piano from the sale. If the woman asserts an action against the man for breach of contract, the woman will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the auctioneer asked for other bids after the woman's opening bid, validating her bid.
B: prevail, because whether or not the auction is "without reserve," goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids.
C: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer may withdraw goods until he announces completion of the sale.
D: not prevail, because the auctioneer did not formally accept the woman's bid before withdrawing the piano.
E: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer invites offers, which he may accept or reject.
F: prevail, because the auctioneer stated that the piano is worth at least $5,000, implying a minimum bid.
G: not prevail, because the auctioneer has the discretion to withdraw any item from an auction.
H: prevail, because goods put up at an auction "without reserve" may not be withdrawn.
I: prevail, because the auction was advertised as "without reserve," meaning all items must be sold to the highest bidder.
J: not prevail, because the auctioneer has the right to reject any bid he considers too low.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about an auction gone wrong, and whether the woman can sue the man for breach of contract. Hmm. I remember that auctions can be a bit tricky in terms of contract law.

From what I recall, when an auction is "without reserve," it means that the seller isn't setting a minimum price. The item has to be sold to the highest bidder, no matter how low that bid is. But wait, does that mean the auctioneer can't withdraw the item once bidding starts?

In this case, the advertisement said it's an auction without reserve. The man started the bidding, the woman bid $100, and he didn't get any other bids. Then he refused the $100 and took the piano off the sale. So, the question is, can he do that?

I think under the UCC, when an auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can't withdraw the goods once bidding has started. Because without reserve implies that the seller is committed to selling the item to the highest bidder, even if that's lower than the reserve price. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Without reserve doesn't mean there's a reserve; it means the opposite, right? So, the seller is obligated to sell to the highest bidder, regardless of the bid amount.

So, when the woman made the $100 bid, and no one else bid, the auctioneer should have accepted it. But instead, he refused and withdrew the piano. That would be a breach because he can't withdraw the item after the bidding has begun in a no-reserve auction.

Looking at the options, let me go through them.

Option A: She prevails because the auctioneer asked for other bids, validating her bid. Well, he did ask for other bids, but that doesn't necessarily mean her bid was accepted. It's more about whether he can withdraw after starting.

Option B: She prevails because goods can't be withdrawn after bids are called. That sounds right, but it depends on whether it's without reserve.

Option C: She doesn't prevail because at without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw until sale completion. Wait, no, without reserve usually means the seller can't withdraw once bidding starts. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D: She doesn't prevail because he didn't accept the bid. But in auctions, the bid is accepted when the auctioneer says "sold" or bangs the gavel. But here, he didn't accept it. So maybe he can withdraw before acceptance.

Option E: She doesn't prevail because the auctioneer can accept or reject offers. But in without reserve, I think the auctioneer must accept the highest bid, even if it's low.

Option F: She prevails because he stated the piano's worth, implying a minimum. That doesn't seem right because without reserve means no minimum.

Option G: She doesn't prevail because the auctioneer can withdraw any item. I think that's only when there's a reserve, not without.

Option H: She prevails because without reserve items can't be withdrawn. That aligns with what I thought earlier.

Option I: She prevails because without reserve means all items must be sold. That sounds correct.

Option J: She doesn't prevail because he can reject bids he thinks are too low. But without reserve, I think he can't, because he's obligated to take the highest bid.

Wait, but the key here is that the auction is without reserve. So, according to the UCC, when an auction is without reserve, the seller is bound to sell to the highest bidder, and cannot withdraw the goods once the auction starts. So, the man shouldn't have been able to withdraw the piano after the woman's bid, especially since no one else bid.

So, the woman's bid was the only one. The auctioneer didn't accept it, so there's no contract yet. Wait, but in an auction without reserve, the auctioneer's call for bids creates an offer, and the first bid is an acceptance. Or is it that the auctioneer's call is an invitation to offer, and each bid is an offer. Then, the auctioneer's acceptance (like saying sold) would create the contract.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. In a without reserve auction, when the auctioneer starts the bidding, any bid is an offer, and the auctioneer must accept the highest bid. But if he doesn't accept, can he withdraw the item? Or does the failure to accept mean no contract is formed.

Alternatively, under the UCC, in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer must sell to the highest bidder, so if the highest bid is $100, he can't refuse it. So, by refusing, he's in breach.

So, looking back at the options, option H says she prevails because without reserve goods can't be withdrawn. Option I says she prevails because all items must be sold to highest bidder.

Wait, but the advertisement says "entire furnishings must go," which suggests that everything will be sold. So perhaps that's a factor.

But the key is that in a without reserve auction, the goods can't be withdrawn after bidding starts. So, the woman's bid was made, and the man shouldn't have withdrawn it. Therefore, the woman can sue for breach.

So, the correct options would be either H or I.

Wait, but the options: H says "goods put up at auction without reserve may not be withdrawn." I think that's correct.

Option I says the auction was without reserve, so all items must be sold to the highest bidder. That also sounds correct.

Wait, but the advertisement says "without reserve" and "entire furnishings must go." So, the man is obligated to sell everything. So perhaps the woman can argue that he breached by not selling the piano.

But the issue is whether the auctioneer can withdraw the item after opening bids. Under the UCC, in without reserve auctions, the seller can't withdraw the goods once the auction starts.

So, the correct answer would be either H or I. H says goods cannot be withdrawn, I says must be sold.

Wait, but the woman made a bid, but the auctioneer didn't accept it. So, was there a contract? Or is the auctioneer required to accept the highest bid as the offer?

In contract terms, the auctioneer's call is an invitation to offer. Each bid is an offer. The auctioneer can accept or not. But in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer must accept the highest bid. So, if he doesn't, he's in breach.

So, the woman's offer was $100. Since it's the only bid, the auctioneer is required to accept it. If he doesn't, he's breached the contract.

Alternatively, maybe under the UCC, when the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer's failure to accept the highest bid is a breach.

So, the woman can argue that a contract was formed when she made the bid, as the auctioneer was under an obligation to accept it.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. In a typical auction, the auctioneer isn't making an offer; they're facilitating bids. So, the bids are offers. The auctioneer can accept or reject, but in without reserve, they must accept the highest bid.

So, if the auctioneer refuses the highest bid without a reserve, that's a breach.

So, in this case, the woman's $100 was the highest and only bid. The auctioneer must accept it. If he doesn't, he's in breach.

So, the options that align with this are H and I.

Looking at the options again:

Option H: prevail, because goods put up at an auction "without reserve" may not be withdrawn.

Option I: prevail, because the auction was without reserve, meaning items must be sold to the highest bidder.

Which is more accurate? I think the rule is that in a without reserve auction, the seller cannot withdraw the goods once the auction starts, meaning that the auctioneer must sell to the highest bidder.

So, H is about not withdrawing goods, which seems correct.

But another thought: the auctioneer didn't accept the bid, so no contract was formed. But the woman might argue that the auctioneer's actions in putting up the item without reserve created a duty to accept her bid.

Wait, but contract formation requires an offer and acceptance. The woman's bid was an offer. The auctioneer's acceptance would typically be by hitting the gavel or saying "sold." Here, he didn't accept, so no contract.

But in a without reserve auction, perhaps the offer is irrevocable once the auction starts. Or maybe the auctioneer is required to accept the highest bid.

I think under UCC § 2-322, when goods are put up at auction without reserve, the seller is bound to sell to the highest bidder. So, the auctioneer must accept the highest bid. If he refuses, the bidder can enforce the contract.

So, in this case, the woman's bid was the highest, so the auctioneer was required to accept it. By refusing, he breached the contract.

So, the correct answer would be H or I. Option H says goods cannot be withdrawn. Option I says all items must be sold to the highest bidder.

Wait, the advertisement also said "Entire furnishings of home must go," which reinforces that everything is to be sold. So, that might support option I.

But the key legal point is the without reserve auction. So, looking back, I think the correct answer is H: prevail, because goods put up without reserve may not be withdrawn.

Alternatively, in the UCC, when an auction is without reserve, the seller can't withdraw the goods after the auction begins. So, once the bidding started, he can't pull the item. So, the woman's bid was the only one, and he must accept it.

So, the woman would prevail because the goods couldn't be withdrawn.

So, the correct answer is H.

In this scenario, the key issue revolves around the rules governing auctions without reserve. When an auction is advertised as "without reserve," the seller is obligated to sell the item to the highest bidder, regardless of the bid amount. This means that once bidding begins, the auctioneer cannot withdraw the item from sale. 

In the given situation, the woman placed an opening bid of $100 on the piano, and no other bids were made. The auctioneer, however, refused to accept the bid and withdrew the piano from the sale. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-322, in a without-reserve auction, the seller is bound to sell the item to the highest bidder. By refusing to accept the woman's bid and withdrawing the piano, the auctioneer breached this obligation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The auctioneer asking for other bids does not validate the woman's bid; the issue is whether the auctioneer can withdraw the item after bidding starts.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While goods cannot be withdrawn after bids are called, this is specifically true for without-reserve auctions, which is the key point here.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. At a without-reserve auction, the auctioneer cannot withdraw goods once bidding has begun.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The auctioneer's failure to formally accept the bid does not negate the obligation to sell the item in a without-reserve auction.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. In a without-reserve auction, the auctioneer must accept the highest bid and cannot unilaterally reject it.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The auctioneer's statement about the piano's worth does not imply a minimum bid in a without-reserve auction.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The auctioneer's discretion to withdraw items applies only when a reserve is present, not in a without-reserve auction.
- **Option H**: Correct. In a without-reserve auction, goods cannot be withdrawn once bidding starts, and the auctioneer must sell to the highest bidder.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the advertisement stated "entire furnishings must go," the legal issue hinges on the without-reserve nature of the auction, not the advertisement's language.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The auctioneer cannot reject a bid in a without-reserve auction once bidding has started.

The correct answer is **H**, as it accurately reflects the legal principle that goods put up for auction without reserve may not be withdrawn once bidding begins. 

Answer: H
