Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about calculating the molar energy required to reverse the direction of a water molecule that's located 100 pm away from a lithium ion. The dipole moment of water is given as 1.85 D. Hmm, I remember that dipole moments are involved in some kind of potential energy calculation when dipoles interact with charges.

Wait, I think the formula involves the interaction between a charge and a dipole. I recall something about the potential energy being proportional to the charge, the dipole moment, and the cosine of the angle between them. Oh right, the formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * μ * cosθ) / r². But wait, when you reverse the direction of the dipole, the angle θ goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. So cosθ goes from 1 to -1. So the change in potential energy would be the difference between these two states.

Let me write this down. The initial potential energy U_initial is when the dipole is aligned with the field (θ=0), so U_initial = (k * q * μ) / r², where k is 1/(4πε₀). The final potential energy U_final is when it's reversed (θ=180), so U_final = - (k * q * μ) / r². The energy required would be the difference, so ΔU = U_final - U_initial = -2k q μ / r².

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the work done to reverse the dipole. Because in the initial state, the dipole is aligned, so it's at a lower energy, and reversing it would take energy. So the energy required is the difference between the two states. So the energy needed is the absolute value of twice the initial potential energy since it's going from U_initial to U_final.

So the formula I'll use is ΔU = 2 * (k * q * μ) / r².

Now, let's plug in the numbers. The charge of Li+ is +1 elementary charge. One elementary charge is about 1.602 x 10^-19 C. The dipole moment μ is given in Debyes, and I need to convert that to C·m. I remember that 1 Debye is approximately 3.33564 x 10^-30 C·m. So 1.85 D is 1.85 * 3.33564e-30 C·m. Let me calculate that.

1.85 * 3.33564e-30 = let's see, 1.85 *3 is 5.55, 1.85 *0.33564 is approximately 0.6219. So total is about 5.55 +0.6219 = 6.1719e-30 C·m. So μ ≈ 6.172e-30 C·m.

The distance r is 100 pm, which is 100 picometers. Since 1 pm is 1e-12 meters, so 100 pm is 1e-10 meters. So r = 1e-10 m.

Now, plug into the formula. Let's compute each part step by step.

First, calculate k = 1/(4πε₀). I remember that 1/(4πε₀) is approximately 8.9875e9 N·m²/C².

So, k = 8.9875e9 N·m²/C².

Now, q is 1.602e-19 C (since Li+ has a +1 charge).

So, putting it all together:

ΔU = 2 * (k * q * μ) / r².

Let me compute the numerator first: 2 * k * q * μ.

2 * 8.9875e9 N·m²/C² * 1.602e-19 C * 6.172e-30 C·m.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 8.9875e9 * 1.602e-19 = (8.9875 * 1.602) * 1e9 * 1e-19.

8.9875 * 1.602 ≈ let's see:

8 * 1.602 = 12.816

0.9875 * 1.602 ≈ approx 1.582. So total is around 14.398.

So 14.398e-10.

Then multiply by 6.172e-30:

14.398e-10 * 6.172e-30 = (14.398 *6.172) * 1e-40.

14 *6 is 84, 0.398*6≈2.388. So 14.398 *6.172 ≈ let's compute exact:

14.398 *6 = 86.388

14.398 *0.172 ≈ approx 2.477

So total approx 86.388 + 2.477 = 88.865. So 88.865e-40.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check:

Wait, 8.9875e9 *1.602e-19 = (8.9875 *1.602) * 1e(9-19) )= (approx 14.4) *1e-10 = 1.44e-9? No, wait, 8.9875e9 is 8.9875 x 1e9, multiplied by 1.602e-19 is 8.9875 *1.602 x 1e9 *1e-19 = 14.4 x 1e-10 = 1.44e-9.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 8.9875e9 *1.602e-19.

Multiply the coefficients first: 8.9875 * 1.602 = let's compute that more accurately.

8 * 1.602 = 12.816.

0.9875 * 1.602: 0.9875 is approximately 15/16, which is 0.9375? No, 0.9875 is 63/64.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.9875 *1.602.

Well, 1.602 * 1 = 1.602.

0.602 * 0.9875: Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, 8.9875 * 1.602.

Let me compute 8 *1.602=12.816, 0.9875 *1.602=1.581375. So total is 14.397375.

So 14.397375e (9-19) )= 14.397375e-10.

Now, multiply by μ: 6.172e-30.

So 14.397375e-10 *6.172e-30 = (14.397375 *6.172) * 1e-40.

Compute 14.397375 *6.172.

Let me do this multiplication:

14 *6 = 84.

14 *0.172=2.408.

0.397375 *6=2.38425.

0.397375 *0.172 ≈ 0.0683.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 14.397375 *6.172.

Let me compute 14.397375 *6 = 86.38425.

14.397375 *0.172: 14.397375 *0.1 =1.4397375; 14.397375 *0.07 = 1.00781625; 14.397375 *0.002=0.02879475.

Adding those: 1.4397375 +1.00781625 =2.44755375 +0.02879475=2.4763485.

So total is 86.38425 +2.4763485 =88.8605985.

So 88.8606e-40. But since we have a factor of 2 in the numerator, wait no: the formula is 2*(k q μ)/r².

Wait no, the 2 is part of the numerator, so that's already included. Because the formula is 2*(k q μ)/(r²).

Wait, no, in the numerator, it's 2 *k*q*μ. So the 2 is part of the multiplication.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. The 2 comes from the change in potential energy when reversing the dipole.

So the 2 is multiplied to the product k*q*μ, then divided by r squared.

So in the calculation above, I have 2 *k*q*μ = 2 * (8.9875e9) * (1.602e-19 C) * (6.172e-30 C·m).

Wait, but when I computed the numerator, I think I included the 2 already. Let me check:

Wait, the way I started was that the numerator is 2 *k*q*μ. So when I computed the first part as 2 *8.9875e9 *1.602e-19, that's correct.

Wait, no, earlier I wrote:

2 * 8.9875e9 *1.602e-19 *6.172e-30.

But in my initial step, I calculated 8.9875e9 *1.602e-19 first, then multiplied by 6.172e-30, and then by 2.

Wait, perhaps I confused the order. Let me recalculate the numerator correctly.

Wait, let me redo the numerator calculation step by step.

Numerator: 2 * k * q * μ.

k =8.9875e9 N·m²/C².

q=1.602e-19 C.

μ=6.172e-30 C·m.

So:

2 * 8.9875e9 * 1.602e-19 *6.172e-30.

Compute 8.9875e9 * 1.602e-19 first.

8.9875e9 =8.9875 x 1e9.

1.602e-19 is 1.602 x1e-19.

Multiply 8.9875 *1.602 ≈ 14.397, as before.

Then 1e9 * 1e-19 =1e-10.

So 14.397e-10.

Now multiply by 6.172e-30:

14.397e-10 *6.172e-30 = (14.397 *6.172) * 1e-40.

14.397 *6.172 ≈ 88.86.

So 88.86e-40.

Now multiply by 2:

2 *88.86e-40 =177.72e-40 =1.7772e-38.

So the numerator is 1.7772e-38 N·m²·C·C·m/(C²·m²) ??? Wait, perhaps I should double-check the units.

Wait, k has units of N·m²/C².

q is in C.

μ is in C·m.

So when you multiply k*q*μ, the units would be (N·m²/C²) * C * (C·m) )= N·m²*C·m / C² )= N·m³/C.

Wait, but then when you divide by r² (m²), the overall units would be (N·m³/C) / m² )= N·m/(C).

Hmm, but energy is in joules, which is N·m. So perhaps I'm missing something in the units.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The potential energy U is given by U = (k q μ cosθ)/r².

The units of U should be in joules (J).

Let me confirm the units:

k has units N·m²/C².

q is C.

μ is C·m.

r² is m².

So when we multiply k*q*μ/(r²), the units are:

(N·m²/C²) * C * (C·m) / m².

Simplify:

N·m² * C * C·m / ( C² * m² ) )

Which is N * m * (C²) / C² )= N·m, which is J. Yes, correct.

So the calculation is correct.

So now, the numerator is 1.7772e-38 (unit-wise, it's N·m²·C·C·m, but perhaps I should just proceed numerically).

Wait, no, the numerator in the expression is 2*k*q*μ, and then we divide by r squared.

Wait, in the formula, it's (2 k q μ ) / r².

So the denominator is r squared, which is (1e-10 m)^2 =1e-20 m².

So now, putting it together:

ΔU = (1.7772e-38) / (1e-20) )= 1.7772e-18 J per molecule.

But wait, no. Because the calculation is 2kqμ/(r²), so after calculating 2kqμ as 1.7772e-38, and then divide by r²= (1e-10)^2=1e-20.

So 1.7772e-38 /1e-20 =1.7772e-18 J.

So that's per molecule.

But the question asks for molar energy, so we need to multiply by Avogadro's number.

Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 mol⁻¹.

So the molar energy U_molar = 1.7772e-18 J/molecule *6.022e23 molecules/mol.

Calculating this:

1.7772e-18 *6.022e23 = (1.7772 *6.022) * 1e5.

1.7772 *6 ≈10.663, 1.7772 *0.022≈0.0391. So total ≈10.663 +0.0391≈10.702.

So 10.702e5 J/mol =1.0702e6 J/mol.

Convert that to kJ: 1.0702e6 J =1070.2 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see 1.07e3 kJ/mol. Option I is 1.07e3, which is 1070 kJ/mol. So that's one of the options. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because the options have a range from 0.3e3 up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go through again.

Wait, my final result was 1.07e6 J/mol, which is 1070 kJ/mol. So option I is 1.07e3 kJ/mol, which is 1070 kJ/mol. So that's correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about dipole interactions, the energy is usually smaller, but maybe that's because of the units used.

Wait, let me re-express all the steps numerically.

Compute 2*k*q*μ =2*(8.9875e9) * (1.602e-19) * (6.172e-30).

Compute 8.9875e9 *1.602e-19 = ?

8.9875e9 is 8.9875 x1e9.

1.602e-19 is 1.602 x1e-19.

Multiply 8.9875 *1.602 = approx 14.4.

So 14.4 x1e9 *1e-19 =14.4e-10.

Then multiply by 6.172e-30: 14.4e-10 *6.172e-30 =14.4 *6.172 x1e-40.

14.4 *6=86.4, 14.4 *0.172=2.4768. Total 86.4 +2.4768=88.8768.

So 88.8768e-40 =8.88768e-39.

Multiply by 2: 2*8.88768e-39 =1.7775e-38.

Then, divide by r²: (1e-10 m)^2=1e-20 m².

ΔU per molecule =1.7775e-38 /1e-20 =1.7775e-18 J/molecule.

Multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022e23):

1.7775e-18 *6.022e23 = (1.7775 *6.022) *1e5.

1.7775 *6=10.665, 1.7775 *0.022=0.0391. So 10.665 +0.0391=10.7041.

So 10.7041e5 J/mol =1.07041e6 J/mol =1070.41 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.07e3 kJ/mol, which matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the energy required is 2 times the initial potential energy. Let me make sure that's correct. Because when the dipole is aligned (θ=0), U_initial = -k q μ /r² (since U = k q μ cosθ /r² and cos0=1, but wait, actually the sign depends on the direction.

Wait, the potential energy of a dipole in an electric field is U = -p·E, but in this case, the point charge creates an electric field. So the interaction energy is U = (1/(4πε₀)) (q μ cosθ) / r².

Wait, or is there a negative sign? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The potential energy of a dipole μ in an electric field E is U = -μ·E. The electric field from a point charge q is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / r²). So the potential energy is U = -μ E cosθ.

So when θ=0 (dipole aligned with field), U = -μ E.

When θ=180 degrees, U = μ E.

So the energy required to reverse from θ=0 to θ=180 is the difference between these two states: U_final - U_initial = μ E - (- μ E) )= 2 μ E.

So yes, the energy required is 2 μ E.

But E is (1/(4πε₀)) (q / r²).

So U = 2 μ E = 2 μ (1/(4πε₀)) (q / r²) ) = (2 μ q )/(4 πε₀ r² ) )= (μ q )/(2 ε₀ r² ) ).

Alternatively,
