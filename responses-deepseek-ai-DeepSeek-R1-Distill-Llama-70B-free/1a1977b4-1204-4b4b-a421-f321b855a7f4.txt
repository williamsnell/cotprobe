Okay, I have this physics problem about diffraction gratings and prisms. Hmm, I need to figure out the answers to parts a, b, and c. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

So, part (a) asks for the resolution of a grating. I remember that the resolution of a grating is determined by the number of lines it has. The formula I think is something like M = N * m, where M is the order of the spectrum, but wait, no, resolution relates to how well it can distinguish two close lines. Oh right, I think the resolving power of a grating is given by R = N * m, where N is the number of lines and m is the order. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the formula is R = n * N, where n is the number of lines per meter? Or wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the resolving power (R) of a diffraction grating is R = (n * N), where N is the number of lines in the grating and n is the order of the spectrum. So the higher the product, the better the resolution. So for part (a), the grating has 600 lines per mm. Oh wait, so that's 600 lines per millimeter. Since it's 15 cm wide, that's 150 mm wide. So total number of lines N is 600 lines/mm * 150 mm = 90,000 lines. So N is 90,000.

So the resolving power R is N multiplied by the order. But wait, the maximum order possible is determined by the number of lines. Oh wait, no, the order can be up to m where m_max is about N times something. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the resolving power is R = N * m, where m is the order of diffraction. But the maximum possible m is around N times (lambda / d), but maybe that's not directly relevant here. Since the question is just asking for the resolution of the grating, I think it's just R = N. Because the maximum possible m is when the path difference is an integer multiple, but perhaps in this question, R is just given as N. Or wait, maybe R is N multiplied by the order, but perhaps the order considered is the maximum possible. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says "what is the resolution of a grating with 600 lines/mm and 15 cm wide." So N is 600 lines/mm * 150 mm = 90,000 lines. So the resolving power R is N times m, but since m can vary, perhaps the question expects R to be simply N. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the maximum possible R, which would be when m is maximum. Wait but the maximum m is determined by the condition that m * lambda < d * (N), no, wait, the maximum order is m_max = floor(d / lambda), but without knowing lambda, perhaps the problem is treating R as N. Because the options seem to have R as a single number, like 90,000, 75,000, etc.

So for part (a), the correct R would be 90,000, which is N. Looking at the options, option E is 90,000, option I is 100,000, etc. So that would point towards option E or others.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the question is using the term "resolution" interchangeably with resolving power, which is R = N*m. But without knowing m, perhaps the question is considering R as N. So I'll proceed with R =90,000 for part (a).

Moving to part (b): How far apart must two green lines be for such a grating to resolve them? Hmm. The resolving power R is given by lambda / delta_lambda = N * m. So delta_lambda is the minimum resolvable wavelength difference, which is lambda divided by (N * m). So delta_lambda = lambda / (N * m). But wait, what's the wavelength of green light? Approximately 550 nm or 5500 Angstroms.

But wait, we're looking for the distance between two lines, which would be delta_lambda. So if the grating can resolve delta_lambda, then the separation is delta_lambda. So the minimum resolvable delta_lambda is lambda/(R), since R = N*m. So delta_lambda = lambda / R. But I'm not sure about the values of m and lambda. Alternatively, perhaps in the visible range, the maximum order m is around 1 or 2. Let's think.

Wait, if the grating has N lines, then the maximum order m is when m*lambda = d*N, where d is the distance between adjacent lines. Wait, d is 1/(lines per mm), so lines per mm is 600, so d is 1.666... micrometers (since 1 mm is 1000 lines, so each line is 1/1000 mm, which is 1e-3 mm, which is 1e-6 meters, which is 1 micrometer. Wait, 600 lines per mm means each line is separated by 1/600 mm = 0.001666... mm = 1.666 micrometers. So d = 1.666e-6 meters.

The maximum order m is the largest integer such that m * lambda < d * N. Wait, no, that's not correct. The condition for the max order is m_max = floor( (d * (N-1))/lambda ). Hmm, but without knowing the wavelength, perhaps the problem assumes that m is 1 for the first order. So let's proceed with m=1.

So delta_lambda = lambda / (N * m) = lambda / N. If lambda is 550 nm, which is 5500 Angstroms. Then delta_lambda would be 5500 / 90,000 = approximately 0.0611 Angstroms. Looking at the options, option E says 0.06 Angstroms, which is close. So that would fit part (b). Then for part (c), we have to find the width of a glass prism that would give the same resolution.

The resolving power of a prism is given by R = (b * (n - 1))/ (lambda * (dn/dlambda))), but wait, I'm not sure of the exact formula. Alternatively, the resolving power of a prism is given by R = (b (dn/dlambda)) where b is the base length of the prism. Wait, no, more accurately, the resolving power of a prism is R = (b * dn/dlambda) / lambda, where dn/dlambda is the dispersion, or the change in refractive index per change in wavelength.

Wait, another approach: The resolving power of a prism is given by R = (b (n - 1)) / (lambda), where b is the base length, and n is the refractive index. Alternatively, perhaps it's R = (b (dn/dlambda)) / lambda. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the formula I think is R = (b (n-1)) / (lambda) for a prism. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, the resolving power (R) of a prism is given by R = (b * (d n / d lambda)) / lambda, where b is the base length of the prism, dn/dlambda is the dispersion (rate of change of refractive index with wavelength), and lambda is the average wavelength. Alternatively, another formula I remember is R = b * (n - 1) / lambda, where n is the refractive index. But I'm not sure which one to use here.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula R = (b (n - 1)) / (lambda). Let me assume that. So if the prism's resolving power is the same as the grating's, which is 90,000, then:

R_prism = (b (n - 1)) / lambda = 90,000.

Assuming green light, lambda is 5500 Angstroms = 550 nm.

What's the typical value of (n-1) for glass? Let's say n is about 1.5 for crown glass, so (n-1) is 0.5.

So rearranging: b = (R * lambda) / (n - 1).

Plugging in numbers: b = (90,000 * 550e-9 m) / 0.5.

Wait, 550e-9 meters is 550 nm. Let me calculate:

550e-9 m = 5.5e-7 m.

So b = (90,000 * 5.5e-7) / 0.5.

Calculate numerator: 90,000 *5.5e-7 = 90,000 * 5.5 * 1e-7 = 495,000e-7 = 4.95e-2.

Then divide by 0.5: 4.95e-2 / 0.5 = 9.9e-2 meters, which is 9.9 cm. Hmm, but none of the options have 9.9 cm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the units. Wait, lambda is 550 nm = 550e-9 m. R is 90,000.

n-1 is 0.5.

So b = (90,000 * 550e-9) / 0.5.

Compute 90,000 * 550e-9 = 90,000 * 5.5e-7 = 90,000 *5.5 * 1e-7 = 495,000e-7 = 4.95e-2.

Then 4.95e-2 / 0.5 = 9.9e-2 m = 9.9 cm.

But looking at the options, option E for part (c) is 75 cm, which is much larger. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula for the prism's resolving power is R = (b * dn/dlambda) / (lambda).

But I don't know the dispersion dn/dlambda for glass. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (b * (n - 1)) / (lambda). Let me try with a different approach.

Wait, another formula I found is that the resolving power of a prism is given by R = (b * (n - 1)) / (lambda), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, another formula I've come across is R = (b * (dn/dlambda)) / (lambda). But without knowing dn/dlambda, I can't compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula R = (b * (n-1)) / lambda. So if the grating's R is 90,000, then the prism's R should also be 90,000.

Wait, but even with that, the calculation gives 9.9 cm, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me think again. Another approach: the resolving power of a prism is given by R = (b * (dn/dλ)) / (1), since the resolving power is R = λ / δλ, which is the same as the grating's R. So for the prism, R = (b * (dn/dλ)).

Wait, that makes sense because the resolving power R is delta_lambda = lambda / R. And for a prism, the angular dispersion is (n - 1) * theta, but I'm getting tangled here. Maybe I should consult another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolving power R of a prism is given by R = (b * (n - 1)) / (lambda) * (some factor). Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's see the options. For part (c), the options are:

A: 95 cm

B:60 cm

C:65 cm

D:100 cm

E:75 cm

F:55 cm

G:85 cm

H:90 cm

I:80 cm

J:70 cm.

In my earlier calculation, I got ~9.9 cm, but that's not in the options. So perhaps I made an error in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is R = (b * (n - 1)) / (lambda), but even that gave a small value. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (b * (n - 1) * something else).

Wait, perhaps the formula is R = (b * (n - 1)) / (lambda) * m, where m is the order. But without knowing m, that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula R = (b * (n - 1)) / lambda. But if I get 9.9 cm and the options have 70-100 cm, perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, maybe the base length b is the width of the prism. If the grating is 15 cm wide, perhaps the prism's base should be similar? But that doesn't directly apply.

Wait, maybe the resolving power for a prism is R = (b * (n - 1)) / (lambda). Let me try that again.

With R = 90,000, lambda = 550e-9 m, n-1=0.5.

Then b = (R * lambda) / (n-1) = (90,000 * 550e-9) / 0.5.

Compute 90,000 * 550e-9 = 90,000 * 5.5e-7 = 4.95e-2.

Then 4.95e-2 / 0.5 = 9.9e-2 m = 9.9 cm.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the correct formula is R = (b * (dn/dλ)) / lambda. But without knowing dn/dλ, I can't compute. Alternatively, perhaps for a glass prism, dn/dλ is about 0.01 per Angstrom or something. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that for a typical glass, dn/dλ is about -0.01 per nm, but I'm not sure. Let's say dn/dλ is about 0.02 per nm, but I'm not certain.

So R = (b * dn/dλ) / lambda.

But if R is 90,000, then:

b = (R * lambda) / (dn/dλ).

Assuming dn/dλ is 0.02 per nm (which is 0.02 per 1e-9 m, or 2e7 per m?), wait units are tricky.

Wait, dn/dλ would be in units of inverse meters.

Wait, if lambda is in meters, then dn/dλ would be per meter. So for example, if dn/dλ is 1e4 per meter, meaning a change of 1 in refractive index per meter of wavelength change.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the actual value for glass. Let me think. I found that for crown glass, dn/dλ at 550 nm is about -0.016 per micron, which is -1.6e4 per meter. Wait, because 1 micron is 1e-6 m, so 0.016 per 1e-6 m is 0.016 / 1e-6 = 16,000 per meter.

So if dn/dλ is approximately 1.6e4 per meter (assuming the negative doesn't matter since we take magnitude), then:

R = (b * 1.6e4) / 550e-9.

We set R =90,000.

So solving for b:

b = (R * 550e-9) / (1.6e4)

= (90,000 * 550e-9) / 1.6e4

Calculate numerator: 90,000 * 550e-9 = 4.95e-2.

Then 4.95e-2 / 1.6e4 = (4.95 / 1.6) * 1e-6 = approx 3.09375e-6 meters, which is 3.09375 mm. That's way too small, and doesn't match any options. So I must be making a mistake here.

Hmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Maybe the problem uses the formula R = (b (n-1)) / lambda, and I just miscalculated. Let me try with R =90,000.

R = (b (n-1)) / lambda.

b = R * lambda / (n-1).

Assuming lambda is 550 nm =550e-9 m.

n-1 is 0.5.

So b = 90,000 * 550e-9 / 0.5.

Compute numerator: 90,000 *550e-9 = 90,000 *5.5e-7 = 4.95e-2.

Divide by 0.5: 9.9e-2 m = 9.9 cm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem uses lambda in Angstroms.

Wait, 550 nm is 5500 Angstroms. So let me try that.

So R = (b (n-1)) / lambda (in Angstroms).

So lambda =5500 A.

Then b = (R * lambda) / (n-1).

R=90,000, lambda=5500 A, n-1=0.5.

So b = (90,000 * 5500) / 0.5.

Calculate: 90,000 *5500 = 495,000,000. Divide by 0.5: 990,000,000 Angstroms.

Convert to cm: 1 A = 1e-10 m = 1e-8 cm. So 990e9 A = 990e9 * 1e-8 cm = 99,000 cm. That's way too big, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me look back at the options. For part (c), option E says 75 cm, which is in the middle of the given options. Maybe the correct calculation gives around 75 cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: the resolving power of a prism is given by R = (b (n - 1)) / (lambda), where b is the base of the prism. If the prism's R should be equal to the grating's R, which is 90,000.

So:

b = (R * lambda) / (n-1).

Let me plug in the numbers again.

R=90,000.

lambda=5500 Angstroms =550 nm =550e-9 m.

n-1=0.5.

So:

b=(90,
