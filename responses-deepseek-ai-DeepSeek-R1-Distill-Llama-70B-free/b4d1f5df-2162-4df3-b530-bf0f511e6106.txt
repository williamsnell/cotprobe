Okay, I've got this logic problem to solve. So the argument is: E implies F, G implies not F. And the conclusion is ~G or ~E. I need to determine if this argument is valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I have to find a counterexample from the options given.

First, I should probably write down the premises and conclusion in logical terms to make it clearer. So the premises are E ⊃ F and G ⊃ ~F. The conclusion is ~G ∨ ~E. 

I remember that an argument is valid if whenever all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If there's any situation where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid, and that situation is a counterexample.

So, using indirect truth tables, I think I need to assume that the premises are all true and the conclusion is false. If I can find such a scenario, then the argument is invalid.

Let me break it down. The conclusion is ~G ∨ ~E. If this is false, then both G and E must be true. Because for an OR statement to be false, both parts must be false. So ~G is false means G is true, and ~E is false means E is true.

So, in this scenario, E is true, G is true, and the conclusion is false. Now, I need to check if the premises hold in this situation.

First premise: E ⊃ F. Since E is true, for this implication to hold, F must be true. Because if E is true and F is false, E⊃F would be false. So F must be true here.

Second premise: G ⊃ ~F. G is true, so for this implication to hold, ~F must be true. Which means F must be false. Wait a minute, but from the first premise, F is true. So we have a problem here. F can't be both true and false at the same time.

So, in this scenario where E and G are true (making the conclusion false), the premises would require F to be both true and false. That's impossible, which means that this situation can't occur. Therefore, there's no possible way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. So the argument must be valid.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through it again. 

Assume the conclusion ~G ∨ ~E is false. That means both ~G is false and ~E is false, so G is true and E is true.

Now, with E true (from premises), E⊃F requires F to be true.

G is true, so G⊃~F requires ~F to be true, which means F must be false.

But F can't be both true and false. So this situation is impossible. Therefore, there's no counterexample where premises are true and conclusion is false. Hence, the argument is valid.

Looking at the options, option E says it's valid. So the answer should be option E.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Some other options might present a scenario where E and G are true. Let me see the options:

Option A: E, F, G all true. But in that case, F is true, so G⊃~F would be G implies false, which is false because G is true. So the premise G⊃~F would be false in this scenario. So this can't be a counterexample because the premises aren't all true. So A isn't a valid counterexample.

Option B: E, G, F all true. Same issue as A; G⊃~F would be false, so premises aren't all true. So B isn't a counterexample.

Option C: E and G true, F false. So E⊃F would be E true, F false → E⊃F is false. So the first premise is false. So premises aren't all true. So C isn't a counterexample.

Option D: E and F true, G false. Let's see. E⊃F is true (E true, F true). G⊃~F: G is false, so the implication is true regardless. So premises are true. What about the conclusion? ~G is true (since G is false), so ~G ∨ ~E is true (because ~G is true). So conclusion holds. So this isn't a counterexample.

So the only possible scenario where premises are true and conclusion is false is when E and G are true, which forces F to be both true and false, which is impossible. So there's no counterexample. Therefore, the argument is valid.

So the correct answer is E, which states the argument is valid.

To determine the validity of the argument, we analyze the premises and conclusion:

- **Premises**:  
  1. \( E \supset F \)  
  2. \( G \supset \neg F \)  

- **Conclusion**:  
  \( \neg G \lor \neg E \)

An argument is valid if, in all scenarios where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. To test this, we assume the conclusion is false and check if the premises can still be true. If such a scenario is impossible, the argument is valid.

### Step 1: Assume the conclusion is false
For \( \neg G \lor \neg E \) to be false, both \( \neg G \) and \( \neg E \) must be false. This implies:
- \( G \) is true
- \( E \) is true

### Step 2: Check the premises under this assumption
1. **First premise (\( E \supset F \))**:  
   Since \( E \) is true, for \( E \supset F \) to hold, \( F \) must also be true.

2. **Second premise (\( G \supset \neg F \))**:  
   Since \( G \) is true, for \( G \supset \neg F \) to hold, \( \neg F \) must be true. This means \( F \) must be false.

### Step 3: Analyze the results
From the first premise, \( F \) must be true. From the second premise, \( F \) must be false. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that the conclusion is false while the premises are true leads to an impossibility.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: \( E, F, G \) are all true. This makes \( G \supset \neg F \) false, so the premises are not all true. Not a counterexample.  
- **Option B**: \( E, G, F \) are all true. Similar to Option A, \( G \supset \neg F \) is false. Not a counterexample.  
- **Option C**: \( E, G \) are true, \( F \) is false. This makes \( E \supset F \) false. Not a counterexample.  
- **Option D**: \( E, F \) are true, \( G \) is false. The premises are true, but the conclusion \( \neg G \lor \neg E \) is also true (since \( \neg G \) is true). Not a counterexample.  
- **Option E**: States the argument is valid. This aligns with the analysis, as no counterexample exists.  

Since no counterexample can make the premises true and the conclusion false, the argument is valid.

**Answer: E**
