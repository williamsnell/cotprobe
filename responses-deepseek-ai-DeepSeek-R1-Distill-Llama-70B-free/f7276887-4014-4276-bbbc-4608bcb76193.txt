Okay, so I have this question about compound interest rates. The question is asking for the effective rate when the nominal rate is 3% compounded monthly. Hmm, I remember that when interest is compounded more frequently, the effective annual rate (EAR) is higher than the nominal rate. 

Wait, the formula for effective annual rate when compounded monthly... I think it's (1 + r/n)^(n) - 1, where r is the nominal rate and n is the number of compounding periods. So in this case, r is 0.03 (since 3% as a decimal) and n is 12 for monthly compounding.

Let me plug in the numbers. So it would be (1 + 0.03/12)^12 - 1. First, I'll calculate 0.03 divided by 12. 0.03 divided by 12 is 0.0025. Then I add 1, so that's 1.0025. Now I need to raise this to the power of 12. 

Hmm, calculating 1.0025^12. I think the approximate value is around 1.0304. So subtracting 1 gives 0.0304. So the effective rate is 0.0304, which is 3.04%. 

Looking at the options, option B is 0.0304. So the answer should be B. I think that's correct because each compounding period adds a bit more interest, and monthly compounding leads to a slightly higher effective rate than the nominal. If it were compounded annually, the effective rate would just be 3%, but since it's monthly, it's a bit higher.

The effective annual rate (EAR) for a nominal interest rate of 3% compounded monthly is calculated using the formula:

\[
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n - 1
\]

Here, \( r = 0.03 \) and \( n = 12 \). Plugging in the values:

\[
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{0.03}{12}\right)^{12} - 1
\]

\[
EAR = (1.0025)^{12} - 1 \approx 1.0304 - 1 = 0.0304
\]

Thus, the effective rate is 0.0304, corresponding to option B.
