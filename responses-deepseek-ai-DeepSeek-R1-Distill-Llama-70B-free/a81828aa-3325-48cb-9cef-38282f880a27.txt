Question:

When may an issue fail to become securitized?

Options:

A: When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measure.
B: When the audience grants the securitizing actor the special rights requested but the actor fails to address the proposed threat.
C: When, following the discursive element of the process, extraordinary measures are not implemented.

Okay, so I have this question about securitization, and I'm a bit new to the concept, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about when an issue may fail to become securitized. The options are A, B, and C.

First, I remember that securitization is a concept from security studies, particularly associated with the Copenhagen School. From what I've read, securitization is the process by which an issue is framed as an existential threat to a referent object (like a state, nation, or group), and this framing is used to justify extraordinary measures that go beyond normal political procedures.

So, the process involves a securitizing actor (like a government or political leader) making a speech act, where they declare something a threat. This speech act needs to be accepted by the audience (the public, other policymakers, etc.). If the audience accepts this securitization, it legitimates the use of extraordinary measures to deal with the threat.

Now, the question is about when this process fails. So, failure would mean that the issue doesn't become securitized, meaning it's not successfully framed as an existential threat, or the necessary steps aren't taken.

Looking at the options:

Option A: When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measures. Hmm. So, if the actor doesn't get the right, then they can't take the extraordinary actions. So the securitization fails because the necessary measures aren't authorized. That makes sense. Without the special rights, the process can't move forward.

Option B: When the audience grants the rights but the actor fails to address the threat. Wait, if the audience grants the rights, then the securitization has succeeded, right? Because the key is whether the framing is accepted and the measures are authorized. Whether the measures are effective is a different issue, maybe, but the securitization itself has happened. So this scenario doesn't mean it fails to securitize; it just means the measures weren't effective.

Option C: When extraordinary measures aren't implemented after the discursive process. So, the discursive part is the speech act, the framing. If after that, the measures aren't implemented, does that mean securitization failed? Or is it that securitization requires both the speech act and the implementation? I think securitization is more about the acceptance of the frame, which allows for the measures. If the measures aren't implemented, maybe it's a failure in policy execution, not securitization itself. Or perhaps securitization requires the measures to be taken. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in the theory, securitization involves both the speech act and the acceptance by the audience. Once accepted, it legitimates the extraordinary measures. So if the measures aren't implemented, does that mean securitization didn't fully happen? Or is securitization just about the successful framing, regardless of the follow-through?

Hmm, I think the key is that securitization is about moving an issue into the security realm, which allows for extraordinary measures. So if the measures aren't implemented, maybe the securitization is incomplete. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the audience doesn't accept the framing, that's a failure, but if they do accept but the measures aren't taken, perhaps the securitization still succeeded but the policy failed.

So back to the original question: when does an issue fail to become securitized? That would be when the securitizing move isn't successful. So, in option A, the actor doesn't get the rights, so the securitization can't proceed. In option C, if the measures aren't implemented, maybe the securitization was successful, but the follow-through wasn't. Or maybe the securitization requires the measures to be taken.

Wait, another angle: the process of securitization includes both the speech act and the acceptance, which leads to the implementation of measures. So if the measures aren't implemented, does that mean the securitization failed? Or is the implementation a separate step that could fail for other reasons?

I think the core of securitization is the successful framing and acceptance, which then allows for the measures. So if the measures aren't taken, perhaps it's a failure in policy, but the securitization itself succeeded. So the issue did become securitized, but the measures weren't implemented. Therefore, the failure to securitize would occur when the framing isn't accepted, like in option A.

Wait, no. Option A is about not being granted the special rights. So the securitizing actor asks for special rights (to take extraordinary measures), and if they aren't granted, then the securitization fails, because the measures can't be taken. So the issue isn't securitized because the necessary step (granting rights) didn't happen. So in that case, option A is a correct scenario where securitization fails.

Option C says that after the discursive element, measures aren't implemented. So the discursive part is the speech act, which is accepted, leading to the right to implement measures. But if they don't implement, does that mean the securitization was successful? Or not? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: the securitization process, as per the Copenhagen School, involves three elements: a securitizing actor, a referent object (what is being secured), and an audience. The actor constructs a speech act that identifies something as an existential threat. The audience's acceptance of this speech act determines whether securitization occurs. If the audience accepts it, then the actor is granted the right to take extraordinary measures.

So, if the audience doesn't accept the speech act, securitization fails. But in option A, the audience doesn't grant the special rights, so securitization fails. In option C, the discursive process (speech act) is done, perhaps the audience accepted, but the measures aren't implemented. So, in that case, the securitization succeeded, but the measures weren't taken. So it's not a failure of securitization, just a failure to act.

So the correct answer would be A: when the securitizing actor isn't granted the right to implement extraordinary measures, the issue fails to become securitized.

When an issue fails to become securitized, it is because the process of framing it as an existential threat and gaining acceptance for extraordinary measures does not succeed. According to the Copenhagen School, securitization involves a securitizing actor making a speech act that constructs an issue as a threat, which must be accepted by the audience. This acceptance legitimizes the use of extraordinary measures. If the audience does not grant the securitizing actor the special rights to implement these measures, the securitization process fails.

**Option A** describes a scenario where the securitizing actor is not granted the special rights to implement extraordinary measures. This directly aligns with the failure of securitization, as the necessary acceptance and authorization for measures are absent.

**Option B** refers to a situation where the audience grants the rights but the actor fails to address the threat. However, this does not indicate a failure of securitization itself, as the issue has already been successfully framed as a threat and the rights have been granted. The failure here lies in the execution of measures, not the securitization process.

**Option C** describes a case where extraordinary measures are not implemented after the discursive process. While this could indicate a failure in policy execution, it does not necessarily mean that securitization failed. Securitization is primarily about the successful framing and acceptance of the issue as a threat, which may still have occurred even if measures are not implemented.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it directly addresses the failure of securitization when the necessary rights for extraordinary measures are not granted.
