Calculate the escape velocity from the earth, i.e., the speed with which a vertically moving body must leave the earth's surface in order to coast along without being pulled back to the earth. Also find the time it takes for a rocket projected upward with this escape velocity to attain a height above the earth's surface equal to its radius. In both cases ignore the effect of any other heavenly bodies and take the earth's radius as 6.38 × 10^6 m.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the escape velocity from Earth and the time it takes for a rocket to reach a certain height. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, escape velocity. I remember that the escape velocity is the minimum speed a body needs to escape Earth's gravitational pull without further propulsion. The formula, I think, is derived from equating the kinetic energy to the gravitational potential energy. So the formula should be v = sqrt((2 G M)/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and R is Earth's radius.

Wait, but wait, I'm not too confident. Let me think again. Oh right, gravitational potential energy U is -GMm/R, and kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv². At escape velocity, all the kinetic energy is used to overcome the potential energy, so setting K = -U (but since U is negative, it becomes positive on the other side). So (1/2)mv² = GMm/R. The m's cancel out, so v = sqrt(2 G M / R).

Now, what's the value of G? I think it's 6.67e-11 N·m²/kg². And Earth's mass M is about 5.97e24 kg. The radius R is given as 6.38e6 meters.

Let me plug in the numbers. So calculating 2 * G * M / R first.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. 2 * 6.67e-11 is 1.334e-10. Multiply by M: 5.97e24. So 1.334e-10 * 5.97e24 = let's see, 1.334 *5.97 is approximately 7.98, and exponents: 1e14 (because 1e-10 * 1e24 = 1e14). So 7.98e14. Then divide by R, which is 6.38e6.

So 7.98e14 / 6.38e6 = approx (7.98/6.38) * 1e8. 7.98 /6.38 is about 1.25. So 1.25e8 m²/s². Then take the square root of that for v.

Square root of 1.25e8 is sqrt(1.25) * 1e4. Because (1e4)^2 is 1e8. sqrt(1.25) is about 1.118. So 1.118e4 m/s. Wait, that's 11,180 m/s. Oh wait, the options have 11.2e3, which is 11,200 m/s. That's close enough, considering rounding.

So the escape velocity is approximately 11.2e3 m/s. Looking at the options, options A, C, D, and B have this in the first part.

Wait, option C says 11.2e3 m/s squared. No, that can't be right because velocity is m/s, not m/s². So probably A, B, or something else.

Wait, option B is 11.0e3 m/s, but our calculation is closer to 11.2. So maybe the exact calculation is a bit different, but I'll proceed.

Now, the second part: time to reach a height equal to Earth's radius. So the rocket starts at Earth's surface and goes up to an altitude of R above the surface, so total distance from Earth's center is 2R.

But wait, the question says 'a height above the earth's surface equal to its radius'. So height h is R, so distance from center is R + h = 2R.

But wait, the rocket is projected upward with escape velocity. So we have to find the time it takes to reach that height.

Wait, but when the rocket is moving at escape velocity, it's moving such that it just has enough energy to escape to infinity, but in this case, it's only going up to 2R, not infinity.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of energy conservation again, or maybe use kinematics equations. But wait, since gravity is changing with distance, using simple kinematics with constant acceleration won't work. So I might need to use the gravitational force as a function of distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the velocity as a function of distance and integrate to find the time.

Wait, the rocket is moving under the influence of gravity, which varies with distance from Earth's center. So the equation of motion is a bit tricky.

I think I can use the principle of conservation of mechanical energy here. The total mechanical energy at the surface is kinetic plus potential. At the point where the rocket is at height R above the surface, its kinetic energy will be less, and potential energy will be more than at the surface.

Let me set up the energy equation. At the surface (r=R): kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_e², and potential energy is -GMm/(R). So total energy E is (1/2)mv_e² - GMm/R.

Wait, but since v_e is the escape velocity, which we found using E=0, because at infinity, the kinetic energy is zero and potential is zero. So in that case, (1/2)mv_e² = GMm/(R), so E = 0.

Wait, but if the rocket is moving at escape velocity, it's just enough to reach infinity with zero speed. So when it reaches a height h=R, it's not at infinity yet. So its kinetic energy at that point would be positive, but it's moving under gravitational force, so perhaps I can compute the velocity at that point.

Wait, maybe I should compute the velocity at r=2R, given that the initial velocity is v_e (escape velocity at R).

So the total mechanical energy E is conserved. At any point, E = K + U.

At r = R, E = (1/2)mv_e² - GMm/R.

But since v_e is the escape velocity, (1/2)mv_e² = GMm/R. So E = (GMm/R) - (GMm/R) ) = 0.

Wait, but that can't be right because if E is zero, then at any point, including r=2R, the kinetic energy plus potential energy would be zero.

Wait, no, the potential energy at r=2R is -GMm/(2R), and kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv² = E - U = 0 - (-GMm/(2R)) ) = GMm/(2R). So v at 2R would be sqrt( (2 GM)/(2R) ) ) = sqrt( GM/(R) ). Wait, that's interesting.

Wait, let me compute that.

E = 0 = (1/2)mv² + (- GMm/(2R) )

So 0 = (1/2)mv² - GMm/(2R)

Multiply both sides by 2: 0 = mv² - GMm/(R)

Divide by m: 0 = v² - GM/(R)

So v² = GM/R → v= sqrt(GM/R )

Wait, but wait, the escape velocity v_e is sqrt(2GM/R ), right? Because earlier we had v_e = sqrt(2GM/R ). So sqrt(GM/R) is v_e / sqrt(2) ≈ 7.9e3 m/s.

So at the point where the rocket is at 2R from the center, its velocity is v = v_e / sqrt(2). So approximately 11.2e3 / 1.414 ≈ 7.9e3 m/s.

But how does that help us find the time taken to reach that point?

Hmm, perhaps I should model the motion. But considering that the gravitational force varies with distance, it's not a simple constant acceleration, so the usual kinematic equations (like s = ut + (1/2) a t²) don't apply directly.

Maybe I can set up an integral for the time taken. Since the rocket is moving under variable acceleration, I can express the equation of motion as:

d²r/dt² = - GM / r²

This is a second-order differential equation, which might be tricky to solve. Alternatively, I can use energy conservation and the expression for velocity as a function of r, then find dr/dt and integrate to find the time.

So starting from the energy equation, E = 0 = (1/2)mv² - GMm/r.

So v = dr/dt = sqrt( 2 GM (1/r - 1/(R)) ) )? Wait, let me check.

Wait, E = 0 = (1/2)mv² - GMm/r.

So (1/2)v² = GM (1/r - 1/(R)) )? No, wait, (1/2) v² = GM (1/r - 1/R ) * (-1) ?

Wait, no, E is zero, so 0 = (1/2)mv² - ( - GMm/r ) + (GMm/R )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, at the surface, r=R, and E=0. So at any point, E = (1/2) m v² - ( - GMm/r ). So (1/2) m v² = GMm (1/r - 1/R ), perhaps? Or is it (1/r +1/R )?

Wait, no, when r approaches infinity, v approaches zero, so E = 0 = (1/2) m 0 - ( - GMm / r ) → 0 = 0 + 0, which doesn't help. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the potential energy U(r) is - GMm / r. At r=R, U(R) = - GMm / R. So the total energy E is (1/2 m v_e²) + U(R) = (1/2 m v_e²) - (GMm/R ). But since v_e is the escape velocity, E=0. So (1/2 m v_e² ) = GMm/R → v_e = sqrt(2 GM/R ).

At any other point r, the kinetic energy is (1/2 m v² ) = E - U(r) = 0 - ( - GMm/r ) → (1/2 m v² ) = GMm/r → v = sqrt( 2 GM / r ) .

Wait no, because E is zero, (1/2 m v² ) = GMm/r → v = sqrt( 2 GM / r ). So that's correct.

So when the rocket is at a distance r from the center, its velocity is v(r) = sqrt(2 GM / r ).

Now, to find the time taken to go from r=R to r=2R, we can write:

dt = dr / v(r)

So the time t is the integral from R to 2R of dt = dr / v(r).

So:

t = ∫ (from R to 2R) [1 / sqrt(2 GM / r ) ] dr

Simplify the integrand:

1 / sqrt(2 GM / r ) = sqrt(r) / sqrt(2 GM )

So the integral becomes:

t = ∫ (R to 2R) sqrt(r) / sqrt(2 GM ) dr

Which can be written as:

t = (1 / sqrt(2 GM )) ∫ (R to 2R) sqrt(r) dr

The integral of sqrt(r) dr is (2/3) r^(3/2 )

So:

t = (1 / sqrt(2 GM )) [ (2/3) ( (2R)^(3/2) - R^(3/2) ) ) ]

Compute that:

Let me compute (2R)^(3/2 ) = 2^(3/2) R^(3/2 ) = 2*sqrt(2) R^(3/2 )

So (2R)^(3/2 ) - R^(3/2 ) = (2 sqrt(2) -1 ) R^(3/2 )

Putting it back:

t = (1 / sqrt(2 GM )) * (2/3) (2 sqrt(2) -1 ) R^(3/2 )

Simplify:

Let me factor out sqrt(R):

t = (2/3) (2 sqrt(2) -1 ) R^(3/2 ) / sqrt(2 GM )

Hmm. Let me express R^(3/2 ) as R * sqrt(R )

So:

t = (2/3) (2 sqrt(2) -1 ) R * sqrt(R ) / sqrt(2 GM )

Hmm, but from earlier, we have that v_e = sqrt(2 GM / R ) → sqrt(2 GM ) = v_e sqrt(R )

So let's substitute sqrt(2 GM ) = v_e sqrt(R )

Then:

t = (2/3) (2 sqrt(2) -1 ) R * sqrt(R ) / (v_e sqrt(R )) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

sqrt(R ) in numerator and denominator cancels, so:

t = (2/3) (2 sqrt(2) -1 ) R / v_e

Since v_e is 11.2e3 m/s, and R is 6.38e6 m.

Let me compute (2 sqrt(2) -1 ). sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 2*1.414=2.828. 2.828-1=1.828.

So (2/3) * 1.828 ≈ (0.6667) * 1.828 ≈ approx 1.219.

So t ≈ 1.219 * R / v_e.

Plugging numbers:

R = 6.38e6 m

v_e = 11.2e3 m/s → 1.12e4 m/s.

So R / v_e = 6.38e6 / 1.12e4 ≈ 569.64 seconds.

Multiply by 1.219:

t ≈ 1.219 * 569.64 ≈ 695 seconds.

Convert to minutes: 695 /60 ≈ 11.58 minutes.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 11.61 minutes, option D is 10.61, option B is 11, option A is 15.

So the calculated time is approximately 11.58 minutes, which is very close to option C's 11.61 minutes.

But wait, let me double-check the integral calculation, maybe I missed a factor or made a miscalculation.

Wait, the integral was from R to 2R of dr / v(r) → which is correct.

And v(r) = sqrt(2 GM / r ), so 1/v(r) is sqrt(r/(2 GM)).

So the integral becomes ∫ sqrt(r)/(sqrt(2 GM )) dr → correct.

Then the integral of sqrt(r) is (2/3) r^(3/2 ), correct.

Substituting limits: (2/3)( (2R)^(3/2) - R^(3/2) )

Factor out R^(3/2 ): (2/3) R^(3/2 ) ( (2)^(3/2 ) -1 )

Which is (2/3) R^(3/2 ) ( 2.828 -1 ) = (2/3) R^(3/2 ) (1.828 )

So that's correct.

Then, when substituting, the sqrt(2 GM ) comes from v_e's expression.

Wait, earlier substitution: sqrt(2 GM ) = v_e sqrt(R )

Because v_e = sqrt(2 GM / R ) → v_e^2 R = 2 GM → sqrt(2 GM ) = v_e sqrt(R )

So yes, correct substitution.

Thus, the time calculation seems accurate, leading to about 11.58 minutes.

Looking at the options, option C says 11.61 minutes, which is very close. So the correct option would have escape velocity around 11.2e3 m/s and time around 11.6 minutes.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: 11.2e3 m/s² → no, that's acceleration, not velocity.

Wait, no, looking back: option C says 11.2 × 10^3 m/s^2, which is wrong because escape velocity is m/s. So option C is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 11.2e3 m/s, 15 min.

Option C: 11.2e3 m/s², 11.61 min → wrong units.

Option B: 11.0e3 m/s, 11 min.

Option D: 11.2e3 m/s², 10.61 → wrong units.

Option H: 8.9e3 m/s.

Wait, so the only option with the correct velocity is A, B, or perhaps none. But wait, option C and D have m/s², which is wrong.

Wait, looking again:

The options:

A: 11.2 × 10^3 m/s, 15 min

B: 11.0 × 10^3 m/s, 11.0 min

C: 11.2 × 10^3 m/s², 11.61 min

D: 11.2 x 10^3 m/s², 10.61 min

E: 12.2 x 10^3 m/s², 12.61 min

F: 12.2 × 10^3 m/s, 8.2 min

G: 10 x 10^3 m/s², 10 min

H: 8.9 × 10^3 m/s, 9.42 min

I: 9.2 × 10^3 m/s, 8.5 min

J: 10.5 × 10^3 m/s, 12.34 min

So only options A, B, F, H, I, J have m/s for velocity.

Our calculated escape velocity is ~11.2e3 m/s, so options A, B. But B is 11.0e3, which is a bit lower.

In our calculation, the time was approximately 11.58 minutes, but none of the options A or B have that time. A has 15 minutes, B has 11 minutes.

Wait, but perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me recheck the time calculation.

Wait, when I substituted R as 6.38e6 m and v_e as 11.2e3 m/s.

So R / v_e = 6.38e6 / 1.12e4 → let me compute that accurately.

6.38e6 = 6,380,000.

1.12e4 = 11,200.

6,380,000 / 11,200 = let's compute:
