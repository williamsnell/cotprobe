Question:

A healthy 4-year-old girl is brought for a well-child examination. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Mitral valve prolapse
B: Tricuspid atresia
C: Transposition of the great arteries
D: Tetralogy of Fallot
E: Atrial septal defect
F: Ventricular septal defect
G: Coarctation of the aorta
H: Mitral regurgitation
I: Aortic stenosis
J: Pulmonary stenosis

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 4-year-old girl with some heart murmurs. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says she's healthy, came in for a well-child visit. So she doesn't have any major symptoms, I guess. Then, they found a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border. Wait, where is that? Upper left sternal border—so that's probably near the aortic or pulmonary valve area, right? Because those are usually heard there.

Then, the S2 is widely split and doesn't vary with respiration. Oh, wait, S2 is the second heart sound. Normally, it splits during inspiration because of increased venous return to the right side. If it's widely split and doesn't change with breathing, that suggests it's a fixed split. I remember that's characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD), because the defect allows blood to flow between the atria, so the splitting doesn't vary with respiratory changes.

Next, there's a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. Lower left is more towards the tricuspid valve area. Mid-diastolic murmurs are often due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve, like in cases where there's more blood flowing into the right atrium. So maybe something causing increased flow, like a left-to-right shunt?

Putting it together: The systolic ejection murmur could be from increased flow through the pulmonary valve, which happens if there's more blood going to the lungs. Like in ASD, where blood shunts from the left to the right atrium, leading to more flow through the pulmonary artery. That would explain the systolic ejection murmur at the upper left. The widely split S2 that's fixed—classic ASD. And the mid-diastolic at the lower left might be due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve because of the shunted blood.

Wait, what about other possibilities? Could it be a ventricular septal defect (VSD)? Well, VSD usually presents with a pansystolic murmur, not just systolic ejection. So that's probably not it. Or maybe a pulmonary stenosis? That would cause a systolic ejection murmur, but I think the S2 findings are more specific here.

Let's look at the options. Option E is atrial septal defect. That fits with the fixed split S2 and the murmurs. Option F is VSD, which as I thought, doesn't fit because of the murmur type. Option B is tricuspid atresia, but that's more complex and would probably have other signs like cyanosis, which the question doesn't mention.

Also, in ASD, especially the secundum type, the chest X-ray might show cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary markings, but the question doesn't mention imaging. But in a healthy child, the physical exam findings are key here.

So I think the most likely diagnosis is an atrial septal defect. So the answer should be E.

The question describes a healthy 4-year-old girl with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, a widely split and fixed S2, and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. These findings are characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD). 

- The systolic ejection murmur is likely due to increased flow through the pulmonary valve, a common finding in ASD.
- The widely split and fixed S2 is a hallmark of ASD, as the defect allows blood to flow between the atria, eliminating respiratory variation in the splitting of S2.
- The mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border suggests increased flow across the tricuspid valve, which can occur due to the left-to-right shunt in ASD.

Other options, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD), typically present with a pansystolic murmur rather than a systolic ejection murmur. Tricuspid atresia and other complex congenital heart defects often present with additional signs like cyanosis, which are not mentioned in the question. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is atrial septal defect.

Answer: E
