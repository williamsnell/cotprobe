Okay, so I have this question about silkworms and their internal secretions affecting their behavior. Hmm, I remember that hormones play a big role in insect development and behavior. Let me think.

The question is asking how internal body secretions, like hormones, influence behavior in silkworms. The options are from A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says it's based on the moon's phase. That sounds more like external environmental cues, maybe like some marine animals, but not sure about silkworms. I don't think that's right.

Option B says behavior is controlled by external stimuli. But the question is about internal secretions, so this is the opposite. Probably not B.

Option C is about light presence. I'm not sure if silkworms need light to spin cocoons. I think they might do it regardless, but this is an external factor again.

Option D is about age. Well, age could relate to internal changes, like hormone levels. But the option doesn't directly mention hormones, just age. Hmm, but the question is about internal secretions demonstrating the role.

Option E mentions vibrations. That's another external stimulus, so probably not relevant to internal secretions.

Option F talks about diet triggering cocoon spinning. Diet is an external factor too, so maybe not the right answer.

Option G is temperature changes. Again, external, although temperature can influence metabolism and maybe hormone levels. But the option doesn't state that directly, so I'm not sure.

Option H says juvenile hormone levels being high trigger cocoon spinning. Juvenile hormones are definitely internal secretions, part of the endocrine system. I remember that in insects, juvenile hormone influences molting and metamorphosis. So when levels are high, maybe they spin cocoons. That sounds plausible.

Option I states that cocoon-spinning is controlled by hormones. That's a broader statement. So if H is about juvenile hormone specifically, I is more general. The question is about demonstration, so maybe specific hormone examples are used in experiments.

Option J suggests it's a learned behavior, but silkworms are insects, and I don't think they learn much in that sense. Cocoon spinning is more instinctive and hormone-driven.

So putting it together, the correct answer is either H or I. The question asks how internal secretions have been demonstrated. I think experiments might involve manipulating hormone levels and observing behavior changes. So if juvenile hormone levels are high, that triggers cocoon spinning, that would demonstrate the role of internal secretions.

I recall that in the silkworm's life cycle, when they reach a certain stage, hormones signal them to start spinning cocoons. So H says when juvenile hormone levels are high, they spin. But wait, juvenile hormone usually relates to maintaining juvenile traits. Wait, in some insects, high juvenile hormone prevents metamorphosis. So maybe when it drops, they go into pupation.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. When juvenile hormone is present, the insect stays in the larval stage. When it drops, they go into the pupal stage. So for cocoon spinning, which is part of pupation, maybe the drop in juvenile hormone triggers it. But the option says "when levels are high," which would mean they're still in the larval stage. So maybe H is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of a hormone that triggers the behavior. Another hormone, maybe ecdysone, which is involved in molting. Or maybe in silkworms, a specific stage's hormone triggers cocoon spinning.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the fact that hormone changes internally signal the silkworm to start spinning. So option I says it's controlled by hormones, which is a correct statement. So how have they demonstrated this? Maybe by experiments where hormone levels were altered and the behavior changed.

So if I is the correct answer, then option I is the right choice. Because it directly states that hormones control the behavior, which demonstrates the role of internal secretions.

Wait, but the question is about how the role has been demonstrated. So perhaps an experiment where silkworms were given certain hormones and then observed spinning cocoons. So for example, if you have a silkworm that hasn't started spinning, and you inject it with a hormone, and it starts spinning, that demonstrates internal secretions (hormones) control the behavior.

So looking at the options, option I is a general statement, while H is specific about juvenile hormone. If the correct answer is about hormones in general, then I is correct. If it's about a specific hormone, then H.

I think the broader answer is I. Because the question is about internal secretions in general, not a specific hormone. But wait, looking at the options again, H says "when juvenile hormone levels are high." If high levels of juvenile hormone trigger cocoon spinning, that would mean the hormone is controlling the behavior, which supports the role of internal secretions.

Wait, but in reality, juvenile hormone levels typically decrease to allow metamorphosis. So I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should think about the actual biology. Silk moths, when they are ready to pupate, spin cocoons. The process is triggered by hormones.

In the silkworm (Bombyx mori), the spinning behavior is indeed hormone-regulated. The larvae go through instars, and when they're ready, the hormone ecdysone triggers the molting process. But cocoon spinning is part of the pupation process, which is under hormonal control.

Alternatively, the juvenile hormone might be involved in maintaining the larval state. So when its levels drop, the larvae stop eating, start spinning cocoons, and pupate. So if the question is about when juvenile hormone levels are high, that would not be the time they spin cocoons. So maybe option H is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe another hormone, like the pupation hormone, is involved. But the options don't specify that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is I: Cocoon-spinning behavior of silk worm larvae is controlled by hormones. Because that's a direct statement about internal secretions (hormones) controlling behavior.

So in the experiments, perhaps removing the source of the hormone (like the glands) or adding hormones would change their behavior, showing that internal secretions are responsible.

So the answer should be I.

The question asks how the role of internal body secretions, such as hormones, in behavior has been demonstrated in silkworms. To answer this, it is important to focus on how internal factors, specifically hormones, influence behaviors like cocoon spinning.

- **Option A** suggests that cocoon spinning is based on the phase of the moon, which is an external environmental cue and not related to internal secretions. This is incorrect.  
- **Option B** states that behavior is controlled by external stimuli, which is the opposite of what the question is asking. This is also incorrect.  
- **Option C** mentions light presence, another external factor, and does not relate to internal secretions. Incorrect.  
- **Option D** refers to age, which could indirectly relate to internal changes, but it does not specifically address the role of internal secretions like hormones. Not the best answer.  
- **Option E** talks about vibrations, an external stimulus, and is unrelated to internal secretions. Incorrect.  
- **Option F** suggests diet as a trigger, which is an external factor and not relevant to internal secretions. Incorrect.  
- **Option G** mentions temperature changes, which are external, though temperature can influence metabolism and hormone levels. However, the option does not directly link to internal secretions. Not the best answer.  
- **Option H** specifies that cocoon spinning is triggered by high juvenile hormone levels. While juvenile hormone is an internal secretion, its role in silkworms is typically associated with maintaining the larval state. High levels of juvenile hormone would not trigger cocoon spinning, as this behavior is more likely linked to a drop in juvenile hormone levels or the action of other hormones like ecdysone. Thus, this option is misleading.  
- **Option I** states that cocoon-spinning behavior is controlled by hormones, which directly addresses the role of internal secretions. This is a broad but accurate statement, as experiments have shown that altering hormone levels can influence cocoon-spinning behavior in silkworms. This is the correct answer.  
- **Option J** suggests that cocoon spinning is a learned behavior, which is incorrect, as this behavior is instinctive and hormonally driven in silkworms.  

The most accurate answer is **Option I**, as it directly highlights the role of hormones (internal secretions) in controlling cocoon-spinning behavior, consistent with experimental evidence.
