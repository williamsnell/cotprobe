Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about drag force on a flat plate moving through water. Hmm, I remember drag force has to do with the resistance an object experiences when moving through a fluid. The problem gives me some specifics, so I need to break it down step by step.

The plate is 10 ft by 100 ft, and it's being pulled lengthwise. Wait, lengthwise would mean it's moving along its longer side, right? So the length in the direction of motion is 100 ft, and the width is 10 ft. But wait, when calculating drag, the important dimensions are the ones that contribute to the area exposed to the flow. Since it's moving lengthwise, the area that's in contact with the water would be the length times the width. So area A is 100 ft (length) multiplied by 10 ft (width), which gives 1000 square feet. But wait, wait—no, I think I might have mixed that up. Because when you pull it lengthwise, the plate's area is the same as its full area, right? Or wait, maybe I'm confusing the wetted area. Oh, right, the wetted area is the area in contact with the fluid. So the plate is moving, so the entire surface is wetted. So yes, A is 10 ft * 100 ft = 1000 sq.ft.

The velocity given is 20 ft/s. Water's properties are density rho = 62.4 lb/ft³, and kinematic viscosity ν is 1.08e-5 ft²/s. Oh right, I remember the drag force equation uses the drag coefficient, area, velocity squared, and some other factors. Wait, the formula I think is F_d = ½ * ρ * v² * C_d * A. But wait, that's the general form, but I'm not entirely certain about the exact formula here. Alternatively, for flow over a flat plate, we might be using something related to viscous drag, maybe the boundary layer approach.

Wait, another thought—since the plate is moving through a fluid, the drag force could be calculated using F = (1/2) * ρ * u² * C_d * A, where C_d is the drag coefficient, and A is the frontal area. Wait, what's the frontal area here? If the plate is moving lengthwise, the frontal area would be the area facing the flow, which would be the shorter side. Wait, no, the plate is flat, so when moving lengthwise, the direction of motion is along the length of 100 ft, so the width is 10 ft. So the leading edge is 10 ft wide, and 100 ft long. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused about which area to use.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the type of flow. Since it's a flat plate, I might need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Then, use the appropriate formula for drag force.

So first, calculate the Reynolds number, Re. The formula is Re = (velocity * length) / kinematic viscosity. Wait, what's the characteristic length here? For a flat plate, when you're considering drag along the length, the length is the dimension in the direction of flow. So I think the length (L) here is 100 ft because that's the direction the plate is moving. So Re = (v * L) / ν. Let's compute that.

v is 20 ft/s, L is 100 ft, ν is 1.08e-5 ft²/s.

So Re = (20 * 100) / 1.08e-5 = 2000 / 1.08e-5. Let me calculate that. 2000 divided by 1.08e-5. 2000 divided by 0.0000108. Hmm, 2000 / 0.0000108 equals approximately 185,185,185. So Re is about 1.85e8.

Wait, that's a huge Reynolds number, which would indicate turbulent flow. Because typically, Re above 1e6 is considered turbulent. So for a flat plate, the drag coefficient C_d depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.

In laminar flow (Re < 1e5 or so), C_d is around 0.664 * Re^(-1/2). But for turbulent flow, it's lower. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Oh, no, actually, for the total drag on a flat plate, the drag coefficient is given by different formulas depending on Re.

Wait, I remember that for Re up to about 1e5, the flow is laminar, and the drag coefficient is (1.328) * Re^(-1/2). But once Re exceeds around 1e6, the boundary layer becomes turbulent, and the drag coefficient changes. Or was it that for Re over a certain value, the transition to turbulence happens, and the C_d becomes approximately 0.002 times something.

Wait, I think for a flat plate, the average drag coefficient C_d is:

- For Re ≤ 1e5 (laminar), C_d = 1.328 * Re^(-1/2)
- For Re > 1e6 (turbulent), C_d ≈ 0.002 * (1 + 9 * Re^(-1/2)) * [some function?]

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. Alternatively, a more precise approach: the drag coefficient for a flat plate under turbulent flow is often approximated as C_d = 0.074 / (Re)^ (1/5) when Re is about 1e6 or higher. Or maybe it's C_d = (0.0853) / (log(Re))^2 - (0.05) * (log(Re)) / (Re^0.5), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for high Reynolds numbers (like Re > 5e5), the C_d is about 0.0025. Wait, no, that's for a sphere. Flat plate might have a different C_d.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The problem says the plate is smooth, so it's a smooth flat plate. So for a smooth flat plate, the drag coefficient in turbulent flow is given by the Prandtl-Schlichting formula: C_d = (0.074 / Re^0.2) for Re between 1e6 and 1e7, approximately.

Alternatively, I've read that for a flat plate, when Re is greater than 1e6, the drag coefficient is about 0.002. But I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me try to calculate. So Re was around 1.85e8, which is 185 million, so higher than 1e6, so turbulent flow.

In that case, the drag coefficient for a flat plate in turbulent flow is approximately C_d ≈ 0.002. Or wait, maybe it's C_d ≈ 0.075 / (Re^0.2). Let me plug in Re=1.85e8. So Re^0.2 is (1.85e8)^(0.2). Let's compute that.

Wait, 1e8 is 10^8, whose 0.2 power is 10^(8*0.2) )=10^1.6≈ about 40 (because 10^1.6= approx 40). Similarly, 1.85e8 is approximately 1.85 * 1e8, so its 0.2 power would be (1.85)^(0.2) * (1e8)^(0.2) )= approx 1.13 *40 = 45.2.

So 0.075 / 45.2 ≈ 0.00166.

So C_d ≈ 0.00166.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct formula. Alternatively, another formula I found earlier is C_d = 0.074 / Re^0.2. So for Re=1e6, C_d would be 0.074/(1e6^0.2)= 0.074 / 10^(6*0.2 * log10(e))... Wait, perhaps a better way: 1e6^0.2 is (1e6)^(1/5)=10^(6/5)=10^1.2≈15.8489, so 0.074 /15.8489≈0.00467.

Wait, but in our case, Re is 1.85e8, so 0.074 / (1.85e8)^0.2.

Compute (1.85e8)^0.2:

Take natural logs: ln(1.85e8)=ln(1.85)+ln(1e8)= approx 0.6152 + 18.4207=19.0359.

Multiply by 0.2: 3.807.

Exponentiate: e^3.807≈ approx 44.7.

So 0.074 / 44.7≈0.001655. So C_d≈0.001655.

So approximately 0.001655.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should instead look for the formula for drag on a flat plate in laminar and turbulent flow.

Wait, another approach: The total drag force on a flat plate is given by F = ½ ρ v² C_d A, where C_d is the drag coefficient based on the Reynolds number.

But for a flat plate, the C_d is based on the length in the flow direction. So for a smooth flat plate in turbulent flow, C_d is approximately 0.002 * (1 + 1.5e-6 Re). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I've read that for a smooth flat plate, the C_d is given by:

C_d = (0.074) / (Re)^0.2 for Re between 1e6 and 1e7.

So using Re=1.85e8, which is 185e6, within that range.

So C_d = 0.074 / (1.85e8)^0.2.

Wait, earlier I calculated that as 0.074 / 44.7≈0.001655.

So C_d≈0.001655.

Now, the area A is 100 ft (length) * 10 ft (width) =1000 ft².

Wait, no, wait—if the plate is being pulled lengthwise, the area exposed is 100 ft * 10 ft, which is 1000 ft², correct. So yes, A=1000 ft².

Now, the drag force F = ½ * rho * v^2 * C_d * A.

So let's compute each part.

rho =62.4 lb/ft³.

v=20 ft/s.

So v²=400 (ft²/s²).

C_d≈0.001655.

A=1000 ft².

Compute F:

F = 0.5 * 62.4 * 400 * 0.001655 * 1000.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 0.5 *62.4=31.2.

31.2 *400=12480.

12480 * 0.001655= 12480 *0.001655.

Let me compute 12480 * 0.001655.

0.001655 is the same as 1.655e-3.

So 12480 *1.655e-3.

12480 * 1.655 = let me compute 12,480 * 1.655.

12,480 *1 = 12,480.

12,480 *0.655 = ?

Compute 12,480 *0.6=7,488.

12,480 *0.05=624.

12,480 *0.005=62.4.

So 7,488 +624=8,112 +62.4=8,174.4.

So total 12,480 +8,174.4=20,654.4.

Wait wait, no. Wait, 1.655 is 1 +0.655, so 12,480 *1.655 =12,480*(1 +0.655)=12,480 + (12,480 *0.655).

Which is 12,480 +8,174.4=20,654.4.

So 20,654.4 *1e-3=20.6544.

So F ≈20.6544 lb_f. Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 0.5 *62.4=31.2.

31.2 *400 =12,480.

12,480 *0.001655=?

Wait, 12,480 *0.001655:

12,480 *0.001 =12.48.

12,480 *0.000655=?

Compute 12,480 *0.0006=7.488.

12,480 *0.000055=0.6864.

So 7.488 +0.6864=8.1744.

So 12.48 +8.1744=20.6544.

So yes, that's 20.6544.

But then F=20.6544 *1000 (since A=1000 ft²? Wait, no, wait, because in the formula, we already have A incorporated. Wait, no, F is 0.5 * rho * v^2 * C_d * A.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation steps. Let me try again.

F = 0.5 * rho * v² * C_d * A.

So, 0.5 *62.4 =31.2.

Multiply by v²=400: 31.2 *400=12,480.

Multiply by C_d=0.001655: 12,480 *0.001655=20.6544.

Multiply by A=1000 ft²: 20.6544 *1000=20,654.4 lb_f.

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options. The options are in the 600-850 lb_f range. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in determining the area. Wait, because when the plate is moved lengthwise, the flow is along the length, which is 100 ft, so the wetted area is 100 ft (length) *10 ft (width). So A=1000 ft², correct.

Wait, but maybe I should have used the frontal area instead. Wait, the frontal area would be the area perpendicular to the flow. So if the plate is moving along its length, the leading edge is 10 ft wide and 100 ft long. So the frontal area would be 10 ft (width) * 100 ft (length) =1000 ft². So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, F is 20,654 lb_f, which is way higher than any option given. So I must have messed up something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the drag coefficient. Let me think again about the drag coefficient for a flat plate.

Wait, another approach: The drag force on a flat plate in laminar flow is given by F = (2 * mu * v * L ) / nu, where mu is dynamic viscosity, but wait, no, that's for Couette flow, which is between two plates. Hmm, not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the friction drag using the formula F = (1/2) * rho * v^2 * C_f * A, where C_f is the skin friction coefficient.

Ah, yes, I think I was confusing C_d and C_f. For a flat plate, the skin friction coefficient C_f is used, and the total drag is F = 0.5 * rho * v² * C_f * A.

Wait, so perhaps I should be using C_f instead of C_d. I think that's where I went wrong.

So, for a flat plate, F = ½ ρ v² C_f A.

So the correct approach is to find C_f, the skin friction coefficient, not the overall drag coefficient C_d. Because for a flat plate, the drag is solely due to friction (no form drag), so C_d is equal to 2*C_f, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, wait, actually, for a flat plate, the drag force is due to the shear stress along the surface, so F = integral of shear stress over the area. So F = (1/2) * rho * v² * C_f * A, where C_f is the average skin friction coefficient.

So I need to find C_f.

Now, C_f depends on the Reynolds number, Re.

For a flat plate:

- If Re_L is less than about 1e5, the flow is laminar, and C_f = (2 * (0.664)) / sqrt(Re_L). Wait, no, the formula is C_f = (2 * (1/sqrt(Re_L))) * something. Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula.

For laminar flow over a flat plate (Re_L < 1e5), the skin friction coefficient is given by C_f = (1.3282) / sqrt(Re_L).

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. The local skin friction coefficient C_f at a position x along the plate is given by C_f,x = 0.664 / sqrt(Re_x), where Re_x = (v x ) / nu.

The average skin friction coefficient over the entire plate of length L is C_f = (1/ L) * integral from 0 to L of C_f,x dx.

So integrating that, we get C_f = (2 * 0.664) / sqrt(Re_L) ) = 1.3282 / sqrt(Re_L).

So for Re_L =1.85e8, which is way higher than 1e5, so the flow is turbulent.

For turbulent flow, the skin friction coefficient is given by the Prandtl-Schlichting approximation, which is C_f = (0.074) / (Re_L)^0.2 for Re_L between 1e6 and 1e7, and C_f = (0.017) / (Re_L)^0.14 for Re_L >1e7 up to 1e9.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The Prandtl-Schlichting law for turbulent flow is:

C_f = (0.074) / (Re_L)^0.2 for 1e6 < Re_L < 1e8.

And C_f = (0.017) / (Re_L)^0.14 for 1e8 < Re_L < 1e10.

Wait, but our Re_L is 1.85e8
