Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about calculating the accrued liability for unemployment claims for Boca Co. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that companies have options for handling unemployment claims. They can either reimburse the state directly for the actual claims or pay a percentage of eligible gross wages. In this case, Boca chose to reimburse the state, which means they pay based on actual claims, not the percentage.

The problem says that Boca believes actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages. Wait, no, actually, the state allows them to pay 3% of eligible gross wages if they don't reimburse directly. But since Boca is reimbursing, they're estimating that their actual claims will be 2% of those wages. So, I think that 2% is the rate they expect to pay.

Eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15,000 of gross wages paid to each employee. So, each employee's eligible wages are capped at $15k, even if they earned more. Boca has four employees, each earning $20,000 during the year.

Let me break this down. Each employee's eligible wages are $15k because that's the first $15k. So for each of the four employees, eligible wages are $15,000. So total eligible gross wages for all employees would be 4 * $15,000. Let me calculate that: 4 * 15k = 60,000.

Now, the company expects the actual claims to be 2% of the eligible gross wages. So I need to calculate 2% of $60,000. Hmm, 2% of 60k is 0.02 * 60,000 = 1,200. So the accrued liability should be $1,200.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the options. The options are A to J, with A being $1,200. So the answer should be A.

But wait, another thought: the question says that the state allows them to pay 3% if they don't reimburse. But since they're reimbursing, they're paying based on actual claims, which they estimate at 2%. So yes, the calculation is correct. 4 employees * 15k each = 60k total eligible. 2% of 60k is indeed 1,200.

To determine the accrued liability for unemployment claims, we start by noting that Boca Co. has chosen to reimburse the state directly for actual unemployment claims. The company estimates that actual claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages. Eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15,000 of gross wages paid to each employee.

Boca Co. has four employees, each earning $20,000 during the year. Since eligible gross wages are capped at $15,000 per employee, the total eligible gross wages for all employees is calculated as:

\[
4 \text{ employees} \times \$15,000 = \$60,000
\]

The accrued liability is based on the company's estimate of 2% of eligible gross wages:

\[
2\% \times \$60,000 = 0.02 \times 60,000 = \$1,200
\]

Thus, the accrued liability for unemployment claims in Boca Co.'s year-end balance sheet is **$1,200**.
