Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with interest calculations. But let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says Paul took a loan of $384.75 for 60 days at 6% interest. The question is asking how much interest he paid. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right, I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky, especially when it's not a full year. Since this is for 60 days, I think that's a short-term loan, so maybe it's simple interest rather than compound. I hope I'm right about that.

Wait, simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * r * t, where P is the principal amount, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. Oh wait, but here the time is given in days. So I need to convert that into years, right?

So the principal is $384.75, the rate is 6%, which I think is 0.06 in decimal, and the time is 60 days. Wait, how many years is 60 days? There are 365 days in a year, so 60 divided by 365 would give the time in years. Let me calculate that: 60/365 equals approximately 0.1644 years.

Now, plugging the numbers into the simple interest formula: I = 384.75 * 0.06 * (60/365). Let me compute this step by step.

First, 384.75 multiplied by 0.06. Let me do that: 384.75 * 0.06. Well, 380 * 0.06 is 22.8, and 4.75 * 0.06 is 0.285, so adding those together gives 22.8 + 0.285 = 23.085. So that's the first part.

Now multiply that by (60/365). Let me compute 60/365 first. 60 divided by 365. Hmm, 365 goes into 60 zero times, so 0. something. Let me compute it: 60 ÷ 365. Well, 365 times 0.16 is 58.4, and 0.164 times 365 is 60 exactly because 0.164 * 365 = 60. Wait, exactly? Let me check that. 365 * 0.164: 365 * 0.1 is 36.5, 0.06 is 21.9, 0.004 is 1.46. So 36.5 + 21.9 is 58.4, plus 1.46 gives 59.86. Oh, that's close to 60, but not exact. So maybe 60/365 is approximately 0.16438.

So now I have 23.085 multiplied by approximately 0.16438. Let me compute that. Hmm, 23 * 0.16438 is about 3.78 (since 0.164 *23 is 3.772), and 0.085 * 0.16438 is approximately 0.014. So adding them together, 3.772 + 0.014 gives around 3.786. So approximately $3.79.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because I might have messed up somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me try this way: 384.75 * 0.06 = 23.085. Then 23.085 * (60/365) = ?

So 23.085 * 60 = 1385.1, and then divide by 365. Let's compute 1385.1 ÷ 365.

365 times 3 is 1095, and 365*3.8 is 1387, which is a bit higher than 1385.1. So maybe it's approximately 3.8. Wait, no, because 365 * 3.8 is 365 *3 + 365 *0.8 = 1095 + 292 = 1387. That's more than 1385.1. So perhaps 3.79 exactly.

So 1385.1 divided by 365 is approximately 3.796, which is about $3.80. But wait, the options don't have $3.80. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: $5.75

B: $3.85

C: $4.15

D: $5.00

E: $1.15

F: $2.75

G: $7.25

H: $2.50

I: $4.50

J: $6.00

Hmm, option B is $3.85, which is very close to my calculation of $3.80. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me try computing 23.085 * (60/365) more accurately.

First, 60 divided by 365 is approximately 0.16438356. So 23.085 * 0.16438356.

Let me compute this:

23.085 * 0.16438356.

I'll break it down:

23 * 0.16438356 = ?

0.16438356 * 20 = 3.2876712

0.16438356 *3 = 0.49315068

Adding them gives 3.2876712 + 0.49315068 = 3.78082188.

Then, 0.085 * 0.16438356 = ?

0.08 * 0.16438356 = 0.013110885

0.005 * 0.16438356 = 0.0008219178

Adding those gives 0.013110885 + 0.0008219178 ≈ 0.0139328.

So total is 3.78082188 + 0.0139328 ≈ 3.79475468.

So approximately $3.79475, which is about $3.79 or $3.80. But none of the options exactly match that. The closest option is B: $3.85, but that's a bit higher.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the interest might be calculated using a different method, like 360 days a year instead of 365. Sometimes in finance, they use 360 days for calculations. Let me try that approach.

So, using 360 days in a year, the time would be 60/360 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1666667 years.

So then the interest would be 384.75 * 0.06 * (1/6).

Let me compute that: 384.75 * 0.06 = 23.085 as before.

23.085 * (1/6) = 23.085 /6.

23.085 ÷6: 6*3=18, so 3.0 with 5.085 remaining.

5.085 ÷6 is 0.8475.

So total is 3.8475, which is $3.8475, approximately $3.85. Oh! That's exactly option B: $3.85.

So that makes sense. I think the confusion was whether to use 365 or 360 days. Since the result came very close to $3.85 when using 360 days, which is a common practice in some financial calculations, that must be the intended method here.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B, $3.85.

To calculate the interest Paul paid on his loan, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$384.75 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t = \frac{60}{360} = \frac{1}{6} \) (time in years, assuming a 360-day year, which is common in financial calculations).

First, calculate \( P \cdot r \):
\[
384.75 \cdot 0.06 = 23.085
\]

Next, multiply by \( t \):
\[
23.085 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 3.8475
\]

Thus, the interest paid is approximately \( \$3.85 \).

From the given options:
- **A: \$5.75** — Too high.
- **B: \$3.85** — Matches the calculation.
- **C: \$4.15** — Too high.
- **D: \$5.00** — Too high.
- **E: \$1.15** — Too low.
- **F: \$2.75** — Too low.
- **G: \$7.25** — Too high.
- **H: \$2.50** — Too low.
- **I: \$4.50** — Too high.
- **J: \$6.00** — Too high.

The correct answer is **B: \$3.85**.
