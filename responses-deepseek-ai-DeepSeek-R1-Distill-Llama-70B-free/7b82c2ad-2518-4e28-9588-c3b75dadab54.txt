Okay, so I've got this problem here about depreciation of a car. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the car cost $3,000 four years ago and now it's worth $1,000. I need to find the average yearly depreciation.

Alright, depreciation is when something loses value over time. So the car has lost value from $3,000 to $1,000. I think the first thing I should do is find out the total depreciation over those four years. 

Wait, how do I calculate that? Oh right, it's the original cost minus the current value. So that's $3,000 minus $1,000, which equals $2,000. So the total depreciation over four years is $2,000.

But the question asks for the average yearly depreciation. That means I need to spread that $2,000 loss over each year. So I guess I divide the total depreciation by the number of years.

So $2,000 divided by 4 years. Let me do that math. 2000 divided by 4 is 500. So that would be $500 per year on average.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Depreciation can sometimes be calculated using different methods like straight-line or other more complex ones. But since the question is asking for average yearly, I think straight-line is what they're looking for. Straight-line depreciation is just total depreciation divided by the number of years, which is exactly what I did.

So each year, the car loses $500 in value. That makes sense because over four years, 500 times 4 is 2000, which matches the total depreciation.

Looking at the options, option G is $500. So that's the one I should choose.

The automobile's total depreciation over four years is calculated as the difference between its original cost and current value: $3,000 - $1,000 = $2,000. To find the average yearly depreciation, this total is divided by the number of years: $2,000 รท 4 = $500. Thus, the average yearly depreciation is $500.

The correct answer is G: $500.
