Question:

On July 7, Magee Data stock sold at a high of 23(1/8) and a low of 22(5/8). Giant Industrials sold for a high of 24(1/4) and a low of 23(1/2). Mr. Taylor purchased 300 shares of Magee Data at the high of the day and 400 shares of Giant Industrials at the low of the day. What was the cost of his purchase?

A: $17,337.50
B: $18,337.50
C: $15,337.50
D: $19,337.50

Okay, so I need to figure out the cost of Mr. Taylor's purchases. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem states that on July 7th, Magee Data stock had a high of 23 1/8 and a low of 22 5/8. Giant Industrials had a high of 24 1/4 and a low of 23 1/2. Mr. Taylor bought 300 shares of Magee Data at the high of the day and 400 shares of Giant Industrials at the low of the day. I need to calculate the total cost.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to convert these mixed numbers (like 23 1/8) into decimal form because that's easier to work with for calculations. Let me start with Magee Data's high.

Magee Data high is 23 1/8. So, 1/8 is 0.125, right? Because 1 divided by 8 is 0.125. So 23 plus 0.125 is 23.125 dollars per share.

He bought 300 shares at this price. So the cost for Magee is 300 multiplied by 23.125. Let me calculate that. 300 * 23.125. Hmm, 300 * 23 is 6900, and 300 * 0.125 is 37.5 (because 0.125 is 1/8, so 300/8 is 37.5). So adding those together, 6900 + 37.5 equals 6937.5 dollars for Magee.

Next, Giant Industrials. The low for the day was 23 1/2. So 1/2 is 0.5, so 23.5 dollars per share. He bought 400 shares at this low. So 400 * 23.5. Let me compute that.

23.5 * 400: Well, 20 * 400 is 8000, and 3.5 *400 is 1400. So 8000 + 1400 is 9400. Alternatively, 23.5 * 400: 23 *400 is 9200, 0.5*400 is 200; 9200+200=9400. Yep, that's correct.

So now I have both amounts: Magee is $6937.5 and Giant is $9400. The total cost is the sum of these two.

Adding them together: 6937.5 + 9400. Let's see. 6937 +9400 is 16337, and then 0.5 more, so 16337.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the addition. 6937.5 plus 9400.

6937.5 + 9400:

Adding thousands: 9000 + 6000 = 15000.

Hundreds: 300 + 900 = 1200.

Tens: 30 +40=70.

Ones:7+0=7.

Plus the 0.5.

So 6937.5 + 9400 = (9000 + 6000) + (300 + 400) ? Wait, maybe breaking it down differently.

Wait, 6937.5 can be split into 6900 + 37.5, and 9400 is 9400.

So 6900 +9400 = 16300. Then 37.5 + 0 =37.5. So total is 16300 +37.5=16337.5.

So the total cost is $16,337.50.

Looking at the options, option I is $16,337.50. So the correct answer should be I.

To determine the total cost of Mr. Taylor's purchases, we first convert the stock prices from mixed numbers to decimal form for easier calculations:

1. **Magee Data Stock**:  
   - High of the day: \( 23 \frac{1}{8} = 23 + 0.125 = 23.125 \) dollars per share.  
   - Mr. Taylor bought 300 shares at this price.  
   - Cost for Magee Data: \( 300 \times 23.125 = 6,937.50 \) dollars.

2. **Giant Industrials Stock**:  
   - Low of the day: \( 23 \frac{1}{2} = 23 + 0.5 = 23.5 \) dollars per share.  
   - Mr. Taylor bought 400 shares at this price.  
   - Cost for Giant Industrials: \( 400 \times 23.5 = 9,400.00 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost**:  
   - Adding the costs of both purchases:  
     \[
     6,937.50 + 9,400.00 = 16,337.50
     \]

Thus, the total cost of Mr. Taylor's purchases is **$16,337.50**. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: $16,337.50**
