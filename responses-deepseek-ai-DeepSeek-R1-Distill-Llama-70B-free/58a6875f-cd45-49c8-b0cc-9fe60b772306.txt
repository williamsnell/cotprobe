Okay, so I have this question about a patient's behavior, and I need to figure out which psychological defense mechanism it's showing. Let's break it down.

The patient is a 55-year-old man, a business executive, admitted with abdominal pain. He's polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff. Hmm, so he's treating different people differently. Then, his family comes—wife and two of three kids. He says the missing child is and always has been worthless, with disgust.

Wait, so the key points are his behavior towards different people and his harsh words about his child. The question is asking which defense mechanism this is.

I remember that defense mechanisms are ways people cope with stress, anxiety, etc. They're mostly unconscious. Let's think about the options given.

Option A: Denial. That's when someone refuses to accept reality. Like, refusing to believe they're sick. Doesn't seem to fit here because he's not denying anything about himself.

Option B: Regression. That's acting like a younger person, maybe childlike. I don't see that here; he's being critical, not acting immature otherwise.

Option C: Projective identification. This is a term I'm a bit fuzzy on. I think it's when someone transfers their own feelings to another person and then identifies with them. Like, if I think you're angry, and then I get angry. Not sure if that's what's happening here.

Option D: Reaction formation. That's when someone expresses the opposite of their true feeling. For example, hating someone but being overly nice. But here, he's being mean to some and nice to others. Not sure.

Option E: Displacement. This is redirecting emotions to a safer target. Like, yelling at a kid because you had a bad day at work. Oh, wait, he's a business executive, so maybe he's stressed and taking it out on the staff. But why does he berate the staff but is polite to the physician? Maybe because the physician is higher status, so he holds back. So he's displacing his frustration onto lower-level staff.

Option F: Projection. That's attributing your own unacceptable feelings to someone else. Like, accusing someone of being angry when you're the one who's angry. So if he's saying his child is worthless, maybe he feels worthless himself but projects it onto the child.

Option G: Rationalization. Making excuses for behavior. Not really applicable here.

Option H: Splitting. This is seeing things as all good or all bad. Like, some people are perfect, others are terrible. Wait, he's polite to the physician (maybe seeing them as all good) and berates others (seeing them as all bad). So splitting could be it.

Option I: Intellectualization. Avoiding emotions by focusing on the abstract. Doesn't fit.

Option J: Sublimation. Channeling unacceptable impulses into positive actions. Doesn't fit here.

So, putting it together. He's being polite to the physician but mean to the staff and his child. That could indicate splitting—where he sees some people as all good and others as all bad. Alternatively, it might be displacement, where he's redirecting his anger.

Wait, but splitting is more about how you view people in terms of good or bad, not just directing anger. So if he's treating the physician with respect and others poorly, maybe it's splitting. Or perhaps he's displacing his anger towards the staff because maybe he can't express it towards the physician.

Another angle: his behavior towards the child. He says the missing child is worthless. If he's projecting, he might be saying the child is worthless when he actually feels that way about himself. But why would he do that? Maybe he's struggling with feelings of inadequacy and projects them onto the child.

Alternatively, using displacement, he's redirecting his anger towards the child because maybe the real source is elsewhere.

Wait, but the question says he's admitted for abdominal pain. Could that be stress-related, and he's taking his stress out on others. So perhaps he's displacing his frustration about his situation onto the staff and his child.

Alternatively, splitting is when someone sees people as either all good or all bad. So he might see the physician as all good (being polite) and others as bad (berating them), which could fit.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between displacement and splitting. Let me think again. Splitting is a defense mechanism often associated with borderline personality disorder, where people are seen as either idealized or devalued. So if he's being very polite to the doctor (idealizing) and harsh to others (devaluing), that fits splitting.

But then, his behavior towards his child could also be part of that. He's devaluing the child, perhaps because he's splitting them into good (the ones present) and bad (the absent one).

So putting it all together, the behavior towards the staff and family, especially the way he treats different people differently, seems to indicate splitting. So the answer would be H: Splitting.

The patient, a 55-year-old business executive, exhibits behavior that suggests a psychological defense mechanism. He is polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff, indicating a stark difference in how he treats individuals in positions of authority versus those in more subordinate roles. Additionally, he harshly criticizes his absent child, labeling them as "worthless," which further highlights his tendency to view people in extreme terms—either as all good or all bad.

Analyzing the options:

- **Denial (A):** This involves refusing to accept reality, which does not fit here as the patient is not denying any aspect of his situation.
- **Regression (B):** This involves reverting to childlike behavior, which is not evident in the patient's actions.
- **Projective Identification (C):** This involves transferring one's feelings to another and identifying with them, which does not align with the patient's behavior.
- **Reaction Formation (D):** This involves expressing the opposite of one's true feelings, which does not fit as the patient is not hiding his emotions but rather expressing them differently toward different people.
- **Displacement (E):** This involves redirecting emotions toward a safer target, which could partially explain his behavior toward the staff but does not fully account for his harsh criticism of his child or the stark contrast in how he treats the physician versus others.
- **Projection (F):** This involves attributing one's unacceptable feelings to someone else, which could explain his criticism of the child but does not fully capture the broader pattern of his behavior.
- **Rationalization (G):** This involves making excuses for behavior, which is not relevant here.
- **Splitting (H):** This involves seeing people as either all good or all bad, which aligns with the patient's behavior. He idealizes the physician (all good) and devalues the staff and his absent child (all bad), fitting the definition of splitting.
- **Intellectualization (I):** This involves focusing on the abstract to avoid emotions, which does not apply here.
- **Sublimation (J):** This involves channeling unacceptable impulses into positive actions, which is not relevant.

The patient's behavior is best explained by **splitting**, as he demonstrates a clear pattern of idealizing some individuals and devaluing others. This defense mechanism is often associated with stress or underlying psychological conflicts, which may be contributing to his abdominal pain and overall behavior.
