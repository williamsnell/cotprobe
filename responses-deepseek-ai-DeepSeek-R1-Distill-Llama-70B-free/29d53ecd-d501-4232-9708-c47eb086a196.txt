Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking. 

The question is about a machinist who worked for a certain number of hours and is paid a specific hourly rate. I need to calculate the total cost of his labor. 

First, the hours worked are given as 23 and a half hours. That notation, 23(1/2), probably means 23 hours plus half an hour. So that's 23.5 hours in total. Wait, yeah, because 1/2 of an hour is 0.5 hours. So 23 plus 0.5 is 23.5 hours.

Next, his pay rate is $3.90 per hour. So to find the total cost, I need to multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate. That makes sense.

So the calculation would be 23.5 hours multiplied by $3.90 per hour. Let me write that out: 23.5 * 3.90.

Hmm, let's think about how to compute this. Maybe breaking it down would help. 

23.5 hours times 3.90... Let's separate 23.5 into 20 + 3.5. So 20 * 3.90 plus 3.5 * 3.90.

Calculating 20 * 3.90: 20 times 3 is 60, and 20 times 0.90 is 18, so 60 + 18 = 78. So 20 * 3.90 is $78.

Now, 3.5 times 3.90. Let me think. 3 times 3.90 is 11.70, and 0.5 times 3.90 is 1.95. So adding those together, 11.70 + 1.95 equals 13.65.

So now adding the two parts together: 78 (from 20 hours) plus 13.65 (from 3.5 hours) equals 91.65.

Wait, so the total cost is $91.65. Now I need to look at the options provided and see which one matches.

Looking at the options:
Option A is $76.50 — that's too low.
Option B is $89.25 — also lower than my calculation.
Option C is $120.75 — way higher.
Option D is $91.65 — that's exactly what I got.
Option E is $98.70 — higher.
And the rest are other values, but D matches.

Wait, did I do the calculations correctly? Let me double-check.

23.5 * 3.90. Maybe another way to calculate it. Let's multiply 23.5 by 3, which is 70.5, and 23.5 multiplied by 0.90 is 21.15. Adding these together: 70.5 + 21.15 equals 91.65. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer should be option D.

The machinist worked 23.5 hours at a rate of $3.90 per hour. Multiplying the hours by the rate:

23.5 × 3.90 = 91.65.

Comparing this result with the options, the correct choice is:

D: $91.65.
