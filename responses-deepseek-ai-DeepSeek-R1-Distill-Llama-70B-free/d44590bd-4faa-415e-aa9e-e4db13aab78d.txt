Okay, so I have this question about the Osman v UK case and the test the European Court laid down. I'm a bit rusty on my law stuff, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which statement is NOT part of the Osman test. The options are A through D. I remember that the Osman case dealt with the positive obligation of states under the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 2, the right to life.

In Osman, the court established a test to determine when a state has failed in its positive duty to protect an individual from harm. The test, if I recall correctly, has a few key elements. Let me list what I remember.

First, the test involves whether there was a real and imminent risk of death or harm. So that would be something like option B, which says "If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm)." That sounds familiar, so B is part of the test.

Next, the state must have known or ought to have known about that risk. I think that's option D: "A state knows or ought to have known." So D is definitely part of the test.

Then, the risk must emanate from a state agent or someone else. Wait, no, I think in the Osman case, the risk was from a third party, not necessarily a state agent. The case involved a teacher who was stalking a student, and the police didn't take adequate action. So the test applies to risks from non-state actors as well. So if one of the options says the risk must come from a state agent, that might not be part of the test. Looking at option A: "The risk must emanate from a state agent." That doesn't sound right because the Osman test applies when the state fails to protect against third parties.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought the test didn't require the risk to be from state agents. So the test would apply even if the risk is from someone else, like a private individual. So if option A says the risk must be from a state agent, then that's probably not part of the test.

Another part of the test is that the state should have taken reasonable steps to prevent the harm. That's option C: "A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring." So C is part of the test.

Putting it together, the test includes:
1. Real and imminent risk (B)
2. State knew or should have known (D)
3. State failed to take reasonable steps (C)

So the statement that's not part of the test is A, because the risk doesn't have to come from a state agent. It can come from a third party, and the state is still obligated to protect.

But wait, I should double-check. Did the Osman test require the risk to be from state agents? No, I think that's more related to cases where the state itself is the perpetrator, but in Osman, the risk was from a private individual. So the test applies regardless of who is causing the risk, as long as the state had a duty to protect.

The Osman test, established in Osman v UK (1998), applies to determine when a state has failed in its positive duty to protect individuals from harm under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The test includes the following elements:

1. There must be a **real and imminent risk of death or harm** (Option B).
2. The **state must know or ought to have known** about the risk (Option D).
3. The state must have failed to take **reasonable steps to prevent the harm** (Option C).

The test does not require the risk to emanate from a state agent. It applies to risks posed by third parties as well. Therefore, the statement that is **not part of the Osman test** is:

**A: The risk must emanate from a state agent.**

Answer: A
