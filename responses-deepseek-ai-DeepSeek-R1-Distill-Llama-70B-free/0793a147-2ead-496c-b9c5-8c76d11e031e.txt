Okay, so I've got this problem here about a factory producing two types of automobile suspension struts, type I and type Y. The question has two parts, and I need to figure out both. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the given data. The factory can produce 699 units of type I struts per hour with a new machine, and each unit costs $1.20. For type Y, it's 30 units per hour at $1.30 each. Each production day is 24 hours long, and the daily budget is $4,005. The factory wants to maximize the number of type Y struts produced but has a quota of 2,700 type I struts per day.

So, the first part (i) is asking how many type Y struts are produced daily, and part (ii) is whether the budget is sufficient.

Starting with part (i). The quota is 2,700 type I struts daily. Since the factory can produce 699 per hour, let's find out how many hours are needed to meet the quota.

Wait, 699 units per hour for type I. So, time required to make 2,700 units is 2700 / 699. Let me calculate that.

2700 divided by 699. Let me see:

699 * 3 = 2097, which is less than 2700. 699 * 3.857 ≈ 2700?

Wait, let me compute it accurately. 699 * 3 =2097, 2700-2097=603. 603 /699 is 0.863. So total time is 3.863 hours, approximately 3 hours and 52 minutes.

But wait, since the factory operates for 24 hours a day, the remaining time can be used for producing type Y struts.

So, total hours available: 24.

Time used for type I production: 2700 / 699 = approx 3.86 hours.

Thus, time left for type Y: 24 - 3.86 = 20.14 hours.

Now, the production rate for type Y is 30 per hour. So in 20.14 hours, the number of type Y struts produced is 30 * 20.14.

Calculating that: 30 *20=600, 30 *0.14=4.2. So total is 604.2. But since you can't produce a fraction of a strut, it would be 604 units. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, 600 is an option, option A and C. But perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation.

Wait, let me compute the exact time for type I. 2700 / 699 = 3.86046 hours. So 3.86046 hours used for type I. Subtracting from 24 gives 20.1395 hours for type Y.

Multiply 20.1395 by 30 gives 604.185, which is about 604. But the options have 600, 585, etc. Hmm, perhaps I should check if my initial approach is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is in how we're calculating the time. Alternatively, perhaps the factory can only produce type I and Y in the same machine, so they have to split the 24 hours between the two.

Wait, the problem states that each day has a budget of $4,005, so the cost might be a limiting factor as well. Hmm, but part (i) is just about the number produced, so perhaps the budget isn't the constraint for part (i), but part (ii) is about whether the budget is sufficient for that production.

Wait, no, actually, the budget is a constraint on the total production, so perhaps I should approach this as a linear programming problem where we maximize Y given the constraints.

Let me think again. The factory wants to maximize the number of Y struts, but must produce at least 2700 I struts. So the constraints are:

1. Production of I >= 2700 units per day.

2. The total cost must not exceed $4,005.

3. The total time used for both productions cannot exceed 24 hours.

Wait, but each product uses the same machine, so time is a limiting factor. So both production runs can't exceed 24 hours combined.

So, let me model this.

Let x = number of type I struts produced.

y = number of type Y struts produced.

Constraints:

1. x >= 2700 (quota)

2. (x / 699) + (y / 30) <= 24 (time constraint)

3. 1.20x + 1.30y <= 4005 (budget constraint)

Objective: Maximize y.

So, to find the maximum y, we can set x as low as possible, which is 2700.

So, substituting x =2700.

Then, time constraint becomes: (2700/699) + (y/30) <=24.

Let me compute 2700/699:

2700 ÷ 699 = approximately 3.8605 hours.

So, 3.8605 + y/30 <=24.

Subtract 3.8605: y/30 <= 20.1395.

Multiply both sides by 30: y <= 604.185.

So maximum y is 604, but since the options don't have 604, perhaps it's 600, but let me check the budget.

Compute the cost when x=2700 and y=604.

Cost = 1.20 *2700 + 1.30 *604.

1.2 *2700 = 3240.

1.3 *604 = 785.2.

Total cost = 3240 + 785.2 = 4025.2.

But the budget is 4005, so 4025.2 exceeds the budget by about 20.2.

That's a problem. So, the time allows y=604, but the budget does not. So, the actual maximum y is limited by the budget.

So, I need to find the maximum y such that:

1. x >=2700,

2. (2700/699) + (y/30) <=24,

3. 1.2*2700 +1.3*y <=4005.

Let me compute the budget constraint.

We have 1.2*2700 = 3240.

So, 1.3*y <=4005 -3240 = 765.

Thus, y <= 765 /1.3.

Calculate that: 765 ÷1.3.

1.3 * 588 = 765 (because 1.3*500=650, 1.3*88=114.4; 650+114.4=764.4, close to 765). So approximately 588.46, so y=588.

Wait, but wait: 1.3 * 588 = 765 exactly? Let me check.

Yes, because 1.3 * 588:

588 *1 =588, 588 *0.3=176.4. Total 588+176.4=764.4. Hmm, almost 765, but not exact. So 764.4, so 588 units would give 764.4, which is under 765. Then 588 units would cost 764.4, leaving 0.6 unused.

Wait, but if y=588, then the time used would be (2700/699) + (588/30) = 3.8605 + 19.6 = 23.4605 hours, which is under 24, so possible.

But wait, earlier, when y=604, the cost was 4025.2, which is over budget. So the budget limits y to 588.

But wait, 2700/699 is 3.8605 hours, and 588/30 is 19.6 hours. So total time is 3.8605 +19.6=23.4605 hours, which is less than 24. So we have some slack time. But since the factory wants to maximize Y, perhaps we can use the remaining time to produce more Y, but within the budget.

Wait, but the budget is already the limiting factor here. Let's see.

Wait, in this scenario, when x=2700 and y=588, the time used is 23.46 hours, and the budget is exactly 3240 + 764.4=4004.4, which is under the 4005.

So, can we increase y further? Because we have unused time and a little unused budget.

Wait, let me check.

Suppose we increase y by one unit, to 589.

Then, cost would be 1.3*589=768.7. Remaining budget after 2700 type I is 4005-3240=765.

So 768.7 exceeds 765, so no. So y cannot be 589. Hence, maximum y is 588, but wait, no, because 1.3*588=764.4, which is under 765.

Wait, 765 is the remaining budget. So 764.4 is under, so we could perhaps increase y until we hit either the time or budget limit.

Wait, after producing 2700 I and 588 Y:

Time used: 3.8605 + (588/30)=3.8605 +19.6=23.4605 hours.

We have 0.5395 hours left (24 -23.4605=0.5395 hours), which is about 32.37 minutes.

In that time, the factory could produce more Y: 30 units per hour * 0.5395 = 16.185 units.

So, could we make 16 more Y units?

But wait, the cost for 16 more Y units would be 16 *1.3=20.8. The remaining budget is 4005 - (3240 +764.4)=4005-4004.4=0.6 dollars. So, we can't afford even one more Y, since 1 Y costs $1.30, which is more than the remaining $0.6.

Therefore, the maximum y is 588 units, but I don't see 588 in the options. The options have 585, 570, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the budget after 2700 I is 4005-3240=765.

So, maximum y is 765 /1.3=588.46. So, 588 units maximum, costing 764.4.

But let me check the time again. 588 Y units take 588/30=19.6 hours.

Adding to 3.8605 for I, total time 23.4605, leaving 0.5395 hours.

Now, could the factory use that extra time to produce more Y without exceeding the budget?

Wait, in the remaining 0.5395 hours, maximum Y produced is 30 *0.5395≈16.18 units. But each Y costs $1.30, so 16 units would cost 16 *1.3=20.8, but we only have $0.6 left, which isn't enough. So, we can't produce any more Y.

So, y=588 is the maximum possible under budget, but it's not in the options. The options are 585, 570, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the budget. Let me recalculate.

x=2700, so cost is 1.2*2700=3240.

Budget left is 4005-3240=765.

So, y=765 /1.3=588.46, so 588 units.

But none of the options have 588. So perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when maximizing Y, we have to consider both time and budget constraints, and the binding constraint might be the budget, but perhaps I should set up equations considering both.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it with both constraints.

Let me set up the problem again.

We need to maximize y, subject to:

x >=2700

( x /699 ) + ( y /30 ) <=24

1.2x +1.3y <=4005

x >=0, y>=0.

We can solve this as a linear program.

But since the factory wants to maximize Y, and must produce at least 2700 I, let's set x=2700, and see what's the maximum y possible under both time and budget.

So, substituting x=2700:

Time constraint:

2700/699 + y/30 <=24

Which gives y <= (24 - 2700/699)*30

Compute 2700/699 ≈3.8605

24-3.8605≈20.1395

20.1395 *30≈604.185, so y<=604.

Budget constraint:

1.2*2700 +1.3y <=4005

3240 +1.3y <=4005

1.3y <=765 → y<=765/1.3≈588.46.

So, the budget is the stricter constraint here, allowing only 588 Y units.

But the options don't have 588. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the budget. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1.3 * 585 = ?

585 *1=585, 585*0.3=175.5. Total 585+175.5=760.5.

So, 585 Y would cost 760.5, and 2700 I cost 3240.

Total cost:3240+760.5=4000.5, which is under 4005.

So, with y=585, we're within the budget. Now, what about time?

Time for I:2700/699≈3.8605 hours.

Time for Y:585/30=19.5 hours.

Total time:3.8605 +19.5=23.3605 hours, which is under 24, so possible.

But wait, can we make more than 585 Y and still be within budget?

Let me try y=585: cost=760.5.

Remaining budget:4005-3240-760.5=4005-4000.5=4.5.

So, with 4.5 left, we can't do much. 4.5 /1.3≈3.46, so could make 3 more Y, costing 3.9, but that would leave 0.6, which is not enough for another Y (needs 1.3).

So, y=585 +3=588, but as before, budget allows 588.

Wait, but 588 *1.3=764.4, which with 3240 is 4004.4, which is under 4005.

So why is 585 an option?

Ah, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering that x must be exactly 2700. Wait, the quota is that they must produce at least 2700 I. So perhaps they can produce more than 2700 I, but that would take away time from Y production, which is not desired since we're trying to maximize Y. So, the optimal is to produce exactly 2700 I.

So, in that case, the maximum Y is 588, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option G is (i) 585, (ii) Yes. Option B is 585 and No, etc.

Wait, but according to my calculation, 588 is possible, but 585 is an option. So perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me see.

Wait, 2700 I requires 2700/699 hours, which is exactly 3.8571428 hours.

So, 3.8571428 hours for I.

Then, the remaining time for Y is 24 -3.8571428 =20.1428572 hours.

Thus, maximum Y without considering budget is 20.1428572 *30=604.2857, which is 604 units.

But the budget may not allow that. So, let's calculate the cost for x=2700 and y=604.

Cost I: 2700 *1.2=3240.

Cost Y:604 *1.3=785.2.

Total cost:3240 +785.2=4025.2, which is over the budget of 4005.

So, we can't do 604 Y. So, need to find the maximum y where 1.2*2700 +1.3*y <=4005.

So, 1.3y <=4005 -3240=765 → y=765/1.3=588.4615.

Thus, y=588, which would cost 764.4, and under time:

y=588 → time=588/30=19.6 hours.

Total time:3.8571 +19.6=23.4571 <24. So, we have 0.5429 hours left.

Can we use this time to produce more Y without exceeding budget?

In 0.5429 hours, can produce 0.5429*30=16.287 units. But each unit costs $1.3, so 16 units cost 20.8.

But the remaining budget after y=588 is 4005 - (3240+764.4)=0.6.

So, can't afford any more Y units. Thus, y=588 is maximum, but it's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the budget constraint for part (i) and just calculate based on time, which would give 604, but the budget is insufficient, so the answer would be (i)604, but it's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, looking at the options again, the closest to 588 is 585.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done with x=2700, and then y is calculated based on the budget, but perhaps I should do it more accurately.

Let me compute y when time is exactly 24 hours.

So, x=2700, time for x=2700/699=3.8571 hours.

Time left for Y:24-3.8571=20.1429 hours.

Thus, y=20.1429*30=604.2857, which is 604 units. But as before, the cost is 4025.2, over budget.

So, need to reduce y to fit within budget.

Let me set up the budget equation:

1.2x +1.3y =4005.

We have x=2700, so 1.2*2700=3240.

Thus, 1.3y=4005-3240=765 → y=765/1.3=588.4615.

So y=588.

Thus, the maximum y is 588, but it's not in the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the
