Okay, so I need to figure out how to express 4:00 pm in military time. Hmm, I remember that military time is a 24-hour clock system, right? So unlike the 12-hour clock we usually use, which has am and pm, military time goes from 00:00 to 23:59.

Wait, so for times in the afternoon, like pm, you have to add 12 hours to the regular time. Let me think. If it's 12 pm, that's noon, which is 12:00 in military time. Then 1 pm would be 13:00, 2 pm 14:00, and so on. So 4 pm should be 16:00, right? Because 12 plus 4 is 16.

Looking at the options, option A is 1600, which would be 16:00. That matches what I was thinking. Option H is 16:00 as well, but the question asks for how it's expressed in military time, which typically doesn't use the colon. So 1600 would be the correct way.

Wait, let me double-check. What's the difference between option A and H? Oh, A is 1600, written without the colon, which is standard for military time. H is 16:00, which includes the colon but is also correct in 24-hour notation. But in military time, sometimes they omit the colon. So looking at the options provided, A is 1600, which is the four-digit number without the colon, so probably the right choice.

Other options: B is 1400, which would be 2 pm. C is 4000, which doesn't make sense because the maximum is 2359. D is 4:00, which is same as regular time without pm. E is 400, which is 4:00 am in military time. F is 4:00 pm, same as regular. G is 0400, which is 4 am. I is just 4, which is too vague and not correct. J is 2400, which is midnight.

So the correct answer should be A: 1600.

The correct way to express 4:00 pm in military time is 1600. This is because military time uses a 24-hour format, adding 12 to the afternoon hours. 4 pm becomes 16:00, written as 1600 without the colon.
