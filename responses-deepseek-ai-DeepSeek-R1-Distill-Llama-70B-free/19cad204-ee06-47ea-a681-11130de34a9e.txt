Okay, so I've got this question here asking about the measure of an angle that turns through three-fourths of a complete circle. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a full circle is 360 degrees, right? So if something turns through three-fourths of that, I guess I need to calculate three-fourths of 360.

Wait, how do I do that? Oh yeah, fractions. So three-fourths is 3/4. So I multiply 360 by 3/4. Let me do that math. 360 divided by 4 is 90, and 90 times 3 is 270. Oh, right! So 3/4 of 360 degrees is 270 degrees. 

Looking at the options, I see option C is 270°, so that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. A full turn is 360, so three-fourths would be less than that. 270 makes sense because a quarter is 90, so 3 quarters add up to 270. Yeah, that's right.

The measure of an angle that turns through three-fourths of a complete circle is calculated by finding three-fourths of 360°. 

Three-fourths of 360° is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 360° = 270°
\]

Among the given options, the correct answer is **C: 270°**.

Answer: C
