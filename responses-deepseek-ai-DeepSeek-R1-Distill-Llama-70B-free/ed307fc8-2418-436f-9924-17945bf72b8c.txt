Okay, so I have this problem about a department store's sales, and I need to find the net sales. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the problem says: The department store had gross sales this month of $72,800. Returns and allowances were 12% of the net sales. It also mentions that net sales plus returns and allowances equal gross sales. I need to find the net sales in dollars.

Hmm. Let me break this down. I remember that in accounting, gross sales are the total sales before any returns or discounts. Net sales are after subtracting returns and allowances. So the formula I think is: Gross Sales = Net Sales + Returns and Allowances.

Wait, the problem says net sales + returns and allowances = gross sales. Yes, that's the same as I thought. So, Gross = Net + Returns.

And the returns and allowances are 12% of the net sales. So Returns = 12% of Net.

Let me assign some variables to make it clearer. Let's let Net = N, and Returns = R. So according to the problem, R = 0.12 * N.

We also know that Gross (G) is $72,800. So from the first equation, G = N + R. Substituting R from the second equation, G = N + 0.12N. That simplifies to G = 1.12 * N.

Wait, so 1.12 times N equals $72,800. So to find N, I can rearrange the equation: N = G / 1.12.

Plugging in the numbers: N = 72,800 / 1.12.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 72,800 divided by 1.12. Let me think about this. Maybe I can simplify the division.

1.12 is the same as 112/100, so dividing by 1.12 is the same as multiplying by 100/112. So 72,800 * (100/112).

Wait, 100/112 can be simplified. 112 is 16 times 7, so 100 divided by 112 is 25/28. Alternatively, maybe I can just do the division step by step.

Let me try long division. 72,800 divided by 1.12.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of how much 1.12 goes into 72,800. Let's see.

First, 1.12 multiplied by 60,000 is 67,200. Because 1.12 * 60k: 60k *1 is 60k, 60k *0.12 is 7,200, so total 67,200. So if 60,000 gives 67,200, then 72,800 is 5,600 more than 67,200. So 5,600 divided by 1.12 is how much more N is than 60,000.

Hmm, 5,600 divided by 1.12. Let's compute that. 1.12 times 5,000 is 5,600. Because 5,000 *1 is 5k, 5,000 *0.12 is 600, so total 5,600. So 5,000 more.

So total N would be 60,000 + 5,000 = 65,000.

Wait, so that gives N = 65,000. Let me check that again.

So 65,000 * 1.12 should equal 72,800.

65,000 * 1 = 65,000.

65,000 * 0.12 = 7,800.

Adding them together: 65,000 +7,800 =72,800. Yes, that's correct.

So the net sales are $65,000.

Looking at the options, option C is $65,000.00. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we start with the relationship between gross sales, net sales, and returns and allowances. The formula is:

\[
\text{Gross Sales} = \text{Net Sales} + \text{Returns and Allowances}
\]

Let \( N \) represent net sales and \( R \) represent returns and allowances. The problem states that returns and allowances are 12% of net sales, so:

\[
R = 0.12N
\]

Substituting \( R \) into the first equation:

\[
\text{Gross Sales} = N + 0.12N = 1.12N
\]

We are given that gross sales (\( G \)) are $72,800. Thus:

\[
72,800 = 1.12N
\]

To find \( N \), divide both sides by 1.12:

\[
N = \frac{72,800}{1.12}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
N = 65,000
\]

Thus, the net sales are $65,000. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: $65,000.00**
