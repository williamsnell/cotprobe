Okay, so I have this problem about the phase difference caused by a quartz plate when a plane-polarized light passes through it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the plate is 0.54 mm thick. Wait, I should convert that to meters because I remember equations usually use meters. Oh wait, 0.54 mm is 0.54e-3 meters, which is 540e-6 meters. Or wait, actually, 0.54 mm is 540 micrometers, right? So 540 x 10^-6 meters.

The light is plane-polarized and normally incident. The wavelength is 5461 Angstroms. Oh yeah, I know that 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So the wavelength λ is 5461e-10 m, which is 5.461e-7 meters.

The quartz has n_o = 1.544 and n_e = 1.553. Since the light is plane-polarized, I think it will split into the ordinary and extraordinary rays. The phase difference comes from the difference in their optical paths.

Wait, I remember that when light enters a birefringent material, it splits into two components: the o-ray and the e-ray. Each travels with a different speed because their refractive indices are different. The optical path length for each is n multiplied by the physical thickness.

So for the ordinary ray, the optical path length is n_o * d. For the extraordinary, it's n_e * d. But wait, wait. Actually, I think the physical thickness is d, and each ray's optical path is n multiplied by d. But wait, the actual path length in the medium would be the physical thickness divided by cos(theta), but since it's normally incident, theta is 0, so cos(theta) is 1. So no problem there.

Wait, but wait another thing. The plate's faces are cut parallel to the optic axis. Oh, right, that's important. So when the plate is cut with faces parallel to the optic axis, the optic axis is along the faces, so the light is propagating perpendicular to the optic axis. In this case, the extraordinary ray's refractive index is n_e, and the ordinary is n_o? Or wait, is there a difference based on the direction?

Wait, I think when the light is propagating perpendicular to the optic axis, the refractive index for the e-ray is n_e, and the o-ray is n_o. So when the plate is cut this way, both rays are present.

Now, the phase change depends on the difference in optical paths. The formula for phase difference is (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d. But wait, wait, no. Because each ray travels through the same physical thickness, so the optical path for ordinary is n_o * d, and for extraordinary it's n_e * d. So the difference in optical paths is (n_e - n_o) * d.

But wait, the phase for each is (2π/λ) * optical path. So the phase difference Δφ would be (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d, but wait, do I have to account for the fact that it's the difference between the two? Let me think.

Yes, because each beam experiences a different optical path, so the phase of each is (2π/λ) * n * d. So the difference would be (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm not sure if it's (n_e - n_o) or (n_o - n_e), but since the phase difference is the absolute value, it doesn't matter. But in terms of calculation, I can just take the positive difference.

So plugging in the numbers:

n_e = 1.553, n_o = 1.544. So n_e - n_o = 0.009.

d is 0.54 mm = 0.54e-3 meters.

λ is 5461 Angstroms = 5461e-10 meters.

So Δφ = (2π / λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (n_e - n_o) * d: 0.009 * 0.54e-3.

0.009 * 0.54 = 0.00486. So 0.00486e-3 meters, which is 4.86e-6 meters.

Now, λ is 5461e-10 m, which is 5.461e-7 m.

So the ratio (n_e - n_o) * d / λ is 4.86e-6 / 5.461e-7.

Let me compute that: 4.86e-6 divided by 5.461e-7.

Well, 4.86e-6 is about 4.86 *1e-6, and 5.461e-7 is about 0.5461e-6. So 4.86 / 0.5461 is approximately 8.9.

Wait, wait, 5.461e-7 is 5.461 x 1e-7, which is 0.5461 x 1e-6. So 4.86e-6 is 4.86 x1e-6.

So 4.86e-6 / 5.461e-7 = (4.86 / 0.5461) ) * (1e-6 / 1e-7) )= (approximately 8.9) * 10 = ~89.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 5.461e-7 is 5.461 x 10^-7 meters.

So 4.86e-6 = 4.86 x10^-6.

So 4.86e-6 / 5.461e-7 = (4.86 /5.461) ) * (1e-6/1e-7) )= (approx 0.89) *10 = 8.9.

So 8.9 approx.

Wait, 4.86 /5.461 is about 0.89. So 0.89 * 10 =8.9.

So the ratio is approximately 8.9.

So the phase difference is 2π * 8.9.

Wait, 2π times 8.9 is about 17.8π radians.

Wait, that seems a very high phase difference. But phase is modulo 2π, so we can take it modulo 2π to find the smallest equivalent phase difference.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the phase difference is (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d.

Wait, but the way I calculated, (n_e - n_o)*d is 0.009 *0.54e-3 = 0.54e-3 *0.009 = 4.86e-6 m.

Then 4.86e-6 m / 5.461e-7 m = (4.86 /5.461 ) * (1e-6 /1e-7) )= (0.89) *10 =8.9.

So 8.9 wavelengths difference. Each wavelength is 2π phase, so phase difference is 8.9 *2π ≈ 17.8π.

But wait, when you have phase differences, it's the fractional part that matters. So 17.8π can be written as 17π + 0.8π. Since full cycles (2π) don't count, but wait, 17 is an odd number, so 17π is equivalent to π plus 8*2π. So 17.8π = 8*2π + 1.8π. So modulo 2π, the phase difference is 1.8π - 2π = -0.2π? Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the remainder when 17.8 is divided by 2.

Wait, 17.8π divided by 2π is 8.9. So 8 full cycles, and 0.9*2π as the remainder. So the phase difference is 0.9 *2π = 1.8π.

Wait, but the phase difference is modulo 2π, but when I'm asked for the phase difference, perhaps I don't need to take modulo, but the actual phase difference would be 17.8π. But looking at the options, the maximum option is 0.5π, which is option J. So clearly, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Oh wait! Because the light is split into two beams, each traveling through the same physical thickness but with different refractive indices. So the optical path lengths are n_o*d and n_e*d. The difference is (n_e -n_o)*d. But wait, the phase difference would be (2π/λ) * (n_e -n_o)*d. So perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but the wavelength in the medium is λ/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the wavelength is λ/n. So the number of wavelengths would be (n_e *d)/(λ/(n)) )? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the phase accumulation for each beam is (2π/λ_medium) * physical thickness. Since λ_medium = λ0 /n, where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength. So (2π/(λ0/n)) * d = (2π n / λ0 ) * d. So yeah, the phase is (2π n d )/ λ0.

So the phase difference between the two would be (2π (n_e - n_o) d ) / λ0.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So that part is correct.

So back to calculation: 0.009 *0.54e-3 = 4.86e-6 m.

4.86e-6 / 5.461e-7 = 8.9 approximately.

So phase difference is 2π *8.9 =17.8π.

But since phase is modulo 2π, the equivalent phase difference is 17.8π mod 2π.

Wait, 17.8 divided by 2 is 8.9, so 8 full cycles (16π) and 1.8π remaining. So modulo 2π, it's 1.8π. But none of the options are 1.8π. The options go up to 0.5π (option J is 0.5pi). So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, d is 0.54 mm. Oh wait, 0.54 mm is 0.54 x 1e-3 m, which is 5.4e-4 m? Wait, no, wait. 1 mm is 1e-3 m. So 0.54 mm is 0.54e-3 m. So 5.4e-4 m. So d=5.4e-4 m.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate (n_e -n_o)*d.

n_e -n_o =1.553 -1.544 = 0.009.

d=0.54e-3 m.

So (n_e -n_o)*d =0.009 *0.54e-3 = 0.54e-3 *0.009 = let's compute that.

0.54 * 0.009 =0.00486. So 0.00486e-3 m, which is 4.86e-6 m.

Wait, that's correct. So 4.86e-6 meters.

λ is 5461 Angstroms =5461e-10 m =5.461e-7 m.

So (n_e -n_o)*d / λ =4.86e-6 /5.461e-7.

Calculate 4.86e-6 /5.461e-7.

4.86e-6 =4.86 *1e-6.

5.461e-7=5.461 *1e-7 =0.5461 *1e-6.

So 4.86e-6 /5.461e-7 = (4.86 /0.5461) ) * (1e-6 /1e-7) )= (approx 8.9) *10 = 89? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, 4.86 /0.5461 is approximately 8.9. So 8.9 * 10 =89. So the ratio is 89. So the phase difference is 2π *89 = 178π.

Wait, 178 is an even number, but wait, 178 divided by 2 is 89, which is odd. So 178π mod 2π is 0π. Because 178 is even, 178π is 89 * 2π. So 178π is a multiple of 2π, so the phase difference would be 0, modulo 2π.

Wait, that would mean the phase difference is zero. But that can't be right either, because if the phase difference is 178π, that's 89 full cycles, so the phase difference is a multiple of 2π, so the two beams are in phase.

But looking at the options, the only option that's a multiple of 0.5pi is option J (0.5pi), but wait, if the phase difference is 0, that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait another approach: perhaps I need to compute (n_e -n_o) *d and divide by λ, then multiply by 2π. But wait, perhaps I should have used the wavelength in a vacuum, but that's what I did.

Wait, let me compute (n_e -n_o)*d =0.009 *0.54e-3=4.86e-6 m.

Divide this by λ=5.461e-7 m: 4.86e-6 /5.461e-7 = approx 8.9.

So 8.9 wavelengths. So the phase difference is (8.9) *2π =17.8π.

Since 17.8 is 17 +0.8, 17 is odd. So 17.8π = 8*2π + 1.8π. So modulo 2π, it's 1.8π, which is 1.8π. So 1.8π is 9π/5.

Wait, but none of the options are 1.8π. The options go up to 0.5π. So this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses (n_e -n_o)*d *2π/(λ), but I might have missed a factor somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the phase difference is (n_e -n_o)*d *2π/λ.

Wait, let me compute this again.

(n_e -n_o) = 0.009.

d=0.54e-3 m.

(n_e -n_o)*d =0.009 *0.54e-3 =4.86e-6 m.

Multiply by 2π/(5.461e-7 m):

(4.86e-6) * (2π) / (5.461e-7) = (4.86e-6 /5.461e-7) ) *2π.

Compute 4.86e-6 /5.461e-7 = 8.9, as before.

So 8.9 *2π=17.8π.

Hmm, same as before. So again, 17.8π mod 2π is 1.8π.

But the options don't have 1.8π. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the phase difference as ((n_e - n_o) * d) * (2π/λ). But perhaps I should have considered whether it's (n_e - n_o) or (n_o - n_e). No, because phase difference is a positive value, so it doesn't matter.

Wait, perhaps I got the refractive indices the wrong way around. The problem states that the plate is cut with faces parallel to the axis. Oh wait, when the faces are parallel to the optic axis, the o-ray and e-ray have their respective refractive indices. But maybe when the light is propagating perpendicular to the optic axis (as in this case), the ordinary ray sees n_o, and the extraordinary sees n_e. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase difference is ((n_e -n_o) *d ) * (2π/λ). But I'm getting 17.8π, which is 8.9*2π. So if I compute 0.8*2π, that's 1.6π. Wait, but that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the phase difference as 2π * ((n_e -n_o) *d ) / (λ). So yes, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (n_e -n_o) *d / λ.

Let me compute that more accurately.

(n_e -n_o) = 1.553 -1.544 =0.009.

d=0.54 mm =0.54e-3 m.

So (n_e -n_o) *d =0.009 *0.54e-3 =0.54e-3 *0.009 =4.86e-6 m.

λ =5461e-10 m.

So (n_e -n_o)*d / λ =4.86e-6 /5461e-10.

Wait, 5461e-10 is 5.461e-7.

So 4.86e-6 /5.461e-7 = (4.86 /5.461 ) * (1e-6 / 1e-7) )= (approx 0.89) *10 =8.9.

So 8.9 wavelengths difference.

Phase difference is 2π *8.9 =17.8π.

Hmm, same as before.

But looking at the options, none of them are close to 17.8π. The options are all less than 1π.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the phase difference is calculated. Maybe it's (n_e *d -n_o *d ) / (λ/2) ) *
