Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about a city's road expenses and how to report them. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that Large City doesn't use the modified approach for accounting for roads. At the beginning of the current year, they spent $800,000 on new roads. The roads have a 20-year useful life. The question is asking what amount should be reported as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year.

Hmm, I remember that in governmental accounting, especially for infrastructure assets like roads, there's something about the modified approach versus the traditional approach. I think the modified approach allows for recording the cost over time, maybe through amortization or something, but only if certain conditions are met, like maintaining the assets appropriately.

Since Large City doesn't use the modified approach, they must be using the traditional method. In the traditional approach, I believe that infrastructure assets are not capitalized and depreciated. Instead, they are expensed when they are acquired or constructed. Wait, no, wait. Or is it that under the traditional approach, they are capitalized as assets but not depreciated because they're infrastructure? Or maybe that's when using the modified approach.

Wait, let me think again. Under GASB standards, governments can choose between the modified approach and the traditional approach for infrastructure. The modified approach requires that infrastructure assets be depreciated over their useful lives, but only if the government can demonstrate that it's maintaining them at a certain level. If they don't use the modified approach, then they must be using the traditional approach.

Wait, no, the traditional approach doesn't capitalize the costs at all. Or does it? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. I think under the traditional approach, the government doesn't record infrastructure as capital assets except for when they're constructed or acquired. So when they spend the money, they record it as an expense immediately, and the assets are not capitalized on the balance sheet. Or is it that they are capitalized but not depreciated?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me get this straight. In governmental accounting, most capital assets are reported on the government-wide financial statements. For roads, if the government uses the modified approach, they capitalize the asset and then amortize the cost over the useful life. But if they don't use the modified approach, they might not capitalize the asset at all, meaning the entire cost is expensed in the period it's incurred.

Wait, but I think that's not right. I remember that under the traditional approach, infrastructure assets are capitalized but not depreciated. So the cost is recorded as an asset (capital asset), but since they don't recognize depreciation, the expense is only when they spend the money. Or is that not the case?

Alternatively, perhaps in the traditional approach, the cost is recorded as an expense when the road is built, and not capitalized at all. But I think that's not correct because capital assets are usually recorded as such regardless. So maybe under the traditional approach, the asset is capitalized but not depreciated, so the expense is only the amount spent in the year, but it's not spread out over the useful life.

Wait, but in this case, the city spent $800,000 on new roads. So if they are using the traditional approach, do they just expense the entire $800k in the current year, or do they capitalize it as an asset and not recognize any expense over the years except in the year of acquisition?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the approaches. Let me try to recall. The modified approach allows for the recognition of expense over the useful life of the asset, provided certain conditions are met (like preserving the asset's service potential). If the modified approach isn't used, then the traditional approach is applied. In the traditional approach, the government would not recognize depreciation expense for infrastructure assets. But that doesn't mean they don't recognize the expense at all. Wait, no, perhaps under the traditional approach, the entire cost is expensed in the year of acquisition.

Alternatively, maybe under the traditional approach, the government capitalizes the asset but does not recognize depreciation, so the expense is only the amount when they spend the money. So in the year the road is built, they would record an expense of $800,000.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to think about how expenses are reported in the statement of activities. The statement of activities reports expenses and revenues, so for the roads, if the city uses the traditional approach, the cost is expensed immediately as a capital outlay. So in the current year, the expense would be $800,000.

Wait, but that's one of the options, option B. But let me make sure. Because I remember that under the modified approach, they would spread the cost over the useful life, so each year's expense would be 800,000 / 20 = $40,000. But the question says they don't use the modified approach, so that's probably not the case here.

Wait, no, the modified approach is about whether to use depreciation or not. So if the city doesn't use the modified approach, they wouldn't recognize depreciation. Therefore, the only expense related to the road would be when it's acquired, which is the $800,000. So the expense in the current year would be $800,000.

Wait, but I'm second-guessing because another thought comes in. I recall that under the traditional approach, infrastructure assets are recorded as assets on the balance sheet but not depreciated. So they would be recorded as an asset, and the expense would be recognized as capital outlay in the year of acquisition. So the statement of activities would show an expense of $800,000 in the current year.

But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the entire $800k is capitalized as an asset, and no expense is recognized in the statement of activities. But that can't be right because all expenditures are supposed to be recorded as expenses when they're incurred, except for capital assets which are recorded as assets but their cost is recognized as expense over time through depreciation. But in this case, since they don't use the modified approach, which allows for depreciation, perhaps they don't depreciate, so the only expense is when the road is built.

Wait, but that would mean that the city's statement of activities would show an expense of $800,000 in the current year. That would be option B.

Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with the modified approach. Let me think: modified approach requires that the government maintain the infrastructure at or above a certain level and thus can use a depreciation-like method called "amortization" over the useful life. So if they don't use that approach, then they don't recognize any annual expense, and the entire cost is recognized when the road is built.

So in the current year, the city spent $800k, so that's the expense. So the answer would be option B, $800,000.

Wait, but another thought: The statement of activities reports governmental activities, and capital assets are presented net of accumulated depreciation. If the city is not using the modified approach, then they might not be depreciating the roads. So in the statement of activities, they would have recognized the entire $800k as an expense when they spent it, and that's it.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I think that in the traditional approach, the cost is capitalized as an asset, but not depreciated. So the expense is recognized when the asset is acquired. So the statement of activities would show $800k as an expense in the year it was spent.

So the correct answer would be option B: $800,000.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of the alternative: under the modified approach, they would have an annual expense of 800k/20 = 40k. But since they don't use that approach, they don't spread it out. So they expense it all at once.

Yes, I think that's right. So the answer is B.

In governmental accounting, the method used to account for infrastructure assets like roads depends on whether the government adopts the modified approach or the traditional approach. The question specifies that Large City does not use the modified approach. Under the traditional approach, the entire cost of the infrastructure asset is expensed in the year it is acquired or constructed. This means that the city would recognize the full $800,000 as an expense in the current year when the roads were built. 

The modified approach, which is not used here, would allow the government to spread the cost over the useful life of the asset through amortization, but since Large City does not use this method, the expense is recognized entirely in the current year. Therefore, the correct amount to report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year is $800,000.

Answer: B
