Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to find the Laplace inverse of the function F(s). The given function is (5s² - 15s +7) divided by (s +1)(s -2)³. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms are used to convert differential equations into algebraic ones, but the inverse is needed here. 

Wait, the inverse Laplace transform takes a function from the s-domain back to the time domain. I think the key here is to use partial fraction decomposition because the denominator factors into (s+1) and (s-2) cubed. Partial fractions will help break this down into simpler terms that I can recognize from Laplace transform tables.

So the first step is to express F(s) as a sum of simpler fractions. The denominator is (s + 1)(s - 2)^3, so the partial fractions should look like A/(s+1) + B/(s-2) + C/(s-2)^2 + D/(s-2)^3. Right, because for repeated linear factors, each power gets a term.

So I'll set up the equation: (5s² -15s +7)/[(s+1)(s-2)^3] = A/(s+1) + B/(s-2) + C/(s-2)^2 + D/(s-2)^3. 

To find A, B, C, D, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator (s+1)(s-2)^3 to get rid of the fractions. So:

5s² -15s +7 = A(s-2)^3 + B(s+1)(s-2)^2 + C(s+1)(s-2) + D(s+1).

Now I need to find the coefficients A, B, C, D. One way is to substitute suitable values of s to simplify the equation.

First, let s = -1: the term with A will remain because (s+1) is zero elsewhere. Plugging s=-1:

Left side: 5*(-1)^2 -15*(-1) +7 = 5 +15 +7 =27.

Right side: A*(-1 -2)^3 + 0's (because other terms have (s+1) which is zero). So A*(-3)^3 = A*(-27). So 27 = -27A → A = -1.

Next, let s=2: this will zero out the terms except D. Because (s-2)=0, so all other terms vanish.

Left side:5*(2)^2 -15*(2)+7= 20 -30 +7= -3.

Right side: D*(2+1)=3D. So -3 =3D → D= -1.

Now to find B and C, since we have A and D, perhaps plugging in other values or equate coefficients.

Alternatively, I can expand the right-hand side and equate coefficients for each power of s.

Let me expand each term on the right:

A(s-2)^3 = A(s³ -6s² +12s -8)
B(s+1)(s-2)^2 = B(s+1)(s² -4s +4) → B(s^3 -4s² +4s +s² -4s +4) → B(s^3 -3s² +0s +4)
C(s+1)(s-2) = C(s² -s -2)
D(s+1) = Ds + D

Wait, but I already know A and D. Let me plug A=-1 and D=-1 into these expressions.

So,

A(s-2)^3 = -1*(s³ -6s² +12s -8) → -s³ +6s² -12s +8

B(s+1)(s-2)^2 = B(s^3 -3s² + 4)

C(s+1)(s-2) = C(s² -s -2)

D(s+1) = (-1)s + (-1) → -s -1

Now, sum all these terms:

(-s³ +6s² -12s +8) + (B s³ -3B s² +4B) + (C s² -C s -2C) + (-s -1) 

Combine like terms:

s³ terms: (-1 + B) s³
s² terms: 6s² + (-3B)s² + C s² → (6 -3B + C) s²
s terms: (-12s) + (-C s) + (-s) → (-12 -C -1)s = (-13 -C)s
Constants: 8 + 4B -2C -1 → (7 +4B -2C)

This must equal the left side, which is 5s² -15s +7. So set up equations by equating coefficients.

Left side:
s³: 0
s²:5
s: -15
constant:7

So equate:

s³: (-1 + B) = 0 → B =1

s²: (6 -3B + C) =5 → substitute B=1 → 6-3(1) + C =5 → 3 + C =5 → C=2

s: (-13 - C) = -15 → substitute C=2 → -13 -2 =-15 → -15= -15 → correct.

Constants: 7 +4B -2C =7 → 4B -2C =0 → substitute B=1, C=2 →4(1)-2(2)=4-4=0 → correct.

So all coefficients match.

So now we have A=-1, B=1, C=2, D=-1.

So the partial fractions are:

F(s) = (-1)/(s+1) + 1/(s-2) + 2/(s-2)^2 + (-1)/(s-2)^3.

Wait, wait. Let me check: The expansion gives us the terms, so the partial fractions are:

A/(s+1) → (-1)/(s+1)

B/(s-2) → 1/(s-2)

C/(s-2)^2 → 2/(s-2)^2

D/(s-2)^3 → (-1)/(s-2)^3

Wait, but the denominator for D is (s-2)^3, correct.

Now, take the inverse Laplace transform term by term.

Inverse Laplace of each term:

-1/(s+1) → -e^{-t}

1/(s-2) → e^{2t}

2/(s-2)^2 → 2 * t e^{2t} (since L^{-1} {1/(s-a)^n} = (t^{n-1}/(n-1)!) ) e^{at} )

Similarly, -1/(s-2)^3 → - (t²/2!) e^{2t} → -(t²/2) e^{2t}

Putting it all together:

f(t) = (-e^{-t}) + e^{2t} + 2 t e^{2t} - (t²/2) e^{2t}

Hmm, let me factor e^{2t} terms:

e^{2t} [1 + 2t - (t²/2)] - e^{-t}

Looking at the options, I need to match this expression.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option J: -e^{-t} + e^{2t} - 2te^{2t} + (t²/2)e^{2t}

Wait, the signs don't match. In my result, the e^{2t} terms have 1 + 2t - (t²/2), but option J has 1 -2t + (t²/2). Hmm, that's the opposite signs for the 2t and t² terms.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the partial fractions? Let me double-check the coefficients.

Earlier, when I found the partial fractions:

A=-1, B=1, C=2, D=-1.

Wait, so:

F(s) = (-1)/(s+1) + 1/(s-2) + 2/(s-2)^2 + (-1)/(s-2)^3.

Which would give inverse transforms as:

- e^{-t} + e^{2t} + 2 t e^{2t} - (t²/2) e^{2t}

So combining, the e^{2t} terms are [1 + 2t - (1/2) t²] e^{2t} - e^{-t}.

So the expression is -e^{-t} + e^{2t} + 2 t e^{2t} - (t²/2) e^{2t}.

Looking through the options, let's see.

Option J says: -e^-t + e^2t -2t e^2t + (t²/2) e^2t.

No, that's different signs on the 2t and (t²/2) terms.

Option I: -e^-t + e^2t + 2t e^2t - (t²/2) e^2t.

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So Option I matches.

Wait, let me check Option I again.

Option I: - e^-t + e^2t + 2te^2t - (t^2 / 2)e^2t.

Yes, that matches.

Wait but earlier, I thought the answer was in the options. So perhaps the correct option is I.

But wait, looking back at the options, I think I might have made a mistake in the process. Let me check the partial fraction decomposition again.

Wait, when I found B and C, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the coefficient matching.

After expanding, the right-hand side was:

(-s³ +6s² -12s +8) + (B s³ -3B s² +4B) + (C s² -C s -2C) + (-s -1)

So combining terms, the s³ term is (-1 + B) s³.

Which must equal 0, so B=1.

s²: 6 -3B + C =5 → B=1 → 6-3 + C =5 → 3 + C=5 → C=2.

s term: -12s - C s -s → (-12 - C -1)s = (-13 -2) s = -15 s, which matches.

Constant term: 8 +4B -2C -1 =7.

So that's correct.

So the partial fractions are correct. So the inverse is as I derived.

Looking again at the options, option I is -e^{-t} + e^{2t} +2t e^{2t} - (t²/2) e^{2t}.

Hmm, but looking through the options, option J is -e^{-t} + e^{2t} -2t e^{2t} + (t²/2) e^{2t}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs of C and D.

Wait, the equation for the partial fractions is:

5s² -15s +7 = A(s-2)^3 + B(s+1)(s-2)^2 + C(s+1)(s-2) + D(s+1).

Wait, let me recheck the expansion, perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, when I expand B(s+1)(s-2)^2, I thought it was (s+1)(s² -4s +4) which is s^3 -4s² +4s +s² -4s +4 → s^3-3s² +0s +4.

Wait, that's correct.

Similarly, C(s+1)(s-2) is s² -s -2 → correct.

D(s+1) is Ds + D → correct.

So the expansion is correct.

Wait, but when I plugged in s=2, I got D = -1.

Yes, because when s=2, the left side is 5*(4) -15*2 +7 =20-30+7= -3.

The right side is D*(2+1)=3D → 3D =-3 → D=-1. Correct.

So everything seems correct.

So according to that, the inverse Laplace should be option I.

But wait, I don't see option I having the correct coefficients. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option I: -e^-t + e^2t + 2te^2t - (t^2 / 2)e^2t.

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Wait, but in the given options, the correct answer is not among the first few I thought. So perhaps the correct option is I.

Wait, but looking back, the original question's options are from A to J, including option J. So the correct option should be I.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse of 2/(s-2)^2. Because 1/(s-2)^2 is t e^{2t}, so 2/(s-2)^2 is 2 t e^{2t}, right?

And 1/(s-2)^3 is (t²/2) e^{2t}, so negative of that is - (t²/2) e^{2t}.

So yes, that part is correct.

So the final expression is -e^{-t} + e^{2t} + 2 t e^{2t} - (t²/2) e^{2t}.

Looking through the options, option I matches exactly.

So the correct answer should be option I.

To find the Laplace inverse of \( F(s) = \frac{5s^2 - 15s + 7}{(s + 1)(s - 2)^3} \), we use partial fraction decomposition. The denominator factors suggest the decomposition:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s+1} + \frac{B}{s-2} + \frac{C}{(s-2)^2} + \frac{D}{(s-2)^3}.
\]

Multiplying through by the denominator \((s+1)(s-2)^3\) and equating coefficients, we solve for \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Substituting \(s = -1\) gives \(A = -1\), and substituting \(s = 2\) gives \(D = -1\). Expanding and equating coefficients for \(s^3\), \(s^2\), \(s\), and the constant term yields \(B = 1\) and \(C = 2\). Thus, the partial fraction decomposition is:

\[
F(s) = \frac{-1}{s+1} + \frac{1}{s-2} + \frac{2}{(s-2)^2} + \frac{-1}{(s-2)^3}.
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term:

1. \(-\frac{1}{s+1} \rightarrow -e^{-t}\),
2. \(\frac{1}{s-2} \rightarrow e^{2t}\),
3. \(\frac{2}{(s-2)^2} \rightarrow 2t e^{2t}\),
4. \(\frac{-1}{(s-2)^3} \rightarrow -\frac{t^2}{2} e^{2t}\).

Combining these, the result is:

\[
f(t) = -e^{-t} + e^{2t} + 2t e^{2t} - \frac{t^2}{2} e^{2t}.
\]

Comparing this with the given options, the correct match is:

**Option I: \(-e^{-t} + e^{2t} + 2te^{2t} - \frac{t^2}{2}e^{2t}\).**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I**
