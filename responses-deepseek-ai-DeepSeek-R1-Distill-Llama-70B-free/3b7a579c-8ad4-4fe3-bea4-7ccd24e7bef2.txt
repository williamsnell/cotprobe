Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about a telephone survey. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about determining how sure we can be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were undecided a month before the election. The survey had 400 registered voters, and 256 said they hadn't made up their minds.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with sample data to estimate population parameters, we often use confidence intervals. So probably, this is about calculating a confidence interval for the proportion of undecided voters.

First, let's get the sample proportion. The number of undecided is 256 out of 400. So the proportion p_hat is 256/400. Let me calculate that: 256 divided by 400 is 0.64. So 64% of the sample were undecided.

Now, they're asking about the confidence that the true proportion in the population (let's call it p) falls between 60% and 68%. So we need to construct a confidence interval around p_hat and see if 60-68% falls within that interval.

Wait, but how do we calculate the confidence interval for a proportion? Oh right, the formula is p_hat ± Z*(sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n)), where Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.

But wait, the question is a bit different. It's asking how sure we can be that the true proportion is between 60% and 68%. So perhaps it's not about the confidence interval around the sample proportion, but about finding the confidence level that corresponds to a specific interval (60-68%). Hmm, that might be a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's asking what confidence interval (like 90%, 95%, etc.) would capture the 60-68% range. Wait, no. Let me think again.

So the sample proportion is 64%. The question is, what's the confidence level that the true proportion is between 60% and 68%. So perhaps we can compute the standard error and then see how many standard errors away 60 and 68 are from the sample proportion of 64.

The standard error (SE) would be sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n). Plugging in the numbers: p_hat is 0.64, n is 400.

So SE = sqrt(0.64 * 0.36 / 400). Let me compute that. 0.64 * 0.36 is 0.2304. Divide that by 400 gives 0.000576. Square root of that is approximately 0.024. So SE is about 0.024, or 2.4%.

Now, the margin of error for a confidence interval is typically Z * SE. But here, maybe we can calculate how far 60% and 68% are from the sample proportion in terms of standard errors.

Wait, 60% is 4% below 64%, and 68% is 4% above. So each is 4% away. Since SE is 2.4%, each is 4/2.4 ≈ 1.6667 standard errors away.

So we have a range of ±1.6667 SE around the sample proportion. Now, to find the confidence level that this interval corresponds to, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve that lies within ±Z, where Z is about 1.6667.

Looking at Z-tables, a Z of 1.6667 corresponds to about 0.95 probability for one tail. Wait, let me think. The cumulative probability up to Z=1.6667 is about 0.9525. So the area from -Z to Z would be about 0.9525 - (1 - 0.9525) )? Wait, no, the total area between -Z and Z is 2*(cumulative up to Z) -1.

Wait, no. The standard normal distribution is symmetric. The area from -Z to Z is the same as 2*Φ(Z) -1, where Φ is the CDF. So for Z=1.6667, Φ(1.67) is approximately 0.9525. So the area between -1.67 and 1.67 is 2*0.9525 -1 = 0.905, or 90.5%.

So the confidence level is about 90.5% that the true proportion lies between 60% and 68%. Looking at the options, option B is 90.4%, which is very close. So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the Z calculation. Let me compute Z for a 90% confidence interval. For 90% confidence, the Z-score is about 1.645. Wait, but our Z here is 1.6667, which gives a higher confidence level than 90%. Because 1.6667 is higher than 1.645 (Z for 90% CI is 1.645), so the confidence level would be higher than 90%.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the confidence interval is 60-68%, which is a width of 8% centered at 64. So the margin of error is 4% on each side.

We can compute the Z-score as (4%) / SE. Wait, SE is 2.4%, so 4/2.4 ≈ 1.6667, as before.

So the Z is about 1.6667. Now, what's the confidence level for Z=1.6667?

Using a Z-table, let's find the value closest to 1.6667. 1.67 corresponds to 0.9525 in the standard normal table. So the area between -1.67 and 1.67 is 2*0.9525 -1 = 0.905, or 90.5%. So the confidence level is approximately 90.5%. Looking at the options, option B is 90.4%, which is the closest match. So the answer must be B.

To determine how sure we can be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were undecided, we start by calculating the sample proportion of undecided voters. Out of 400 surveyed voters, 256 were undecided, so the sample proportion is:

\[
\hat{p} = \frac{256}{400} = 0.64 \, \text{(or 64%)}.
\]

The question asks for the confidence level that the true population proportion \( p \) lies between 60% and 68%. To analyze this, we calculate the standard error (SE) of the proportion:

\[
SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.64 \cdot 0.36}{400}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.2304}{400}} = \sqrt{0.000576} \approx 0.024 \, \text{(or 2.4%)}.
\]

Next, we determine how many standard errors lie between the sample proportion (64%) and the bounds of the interval (60% and 68%). The distance from 64% to 60% is 4%, and the same applies to 68%. Thus, the margin of error is:

\[
\text{Margin of Error} = \frac{4\%}{SE} = \frac{4}{2.4} \approx 1.6667 \, \text{standard errors}.
\]

To find the confidence level corresponding to this interval, we use the standard normal distribution. A \( Z \)-score of 1.6667 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.9525. The total area under the curve between \( -Z \) and \( Z \) is:

\[
2 \cdot \Phi(Z) - 1 = 2 \cdot 0.9525 - 1 = 0.905 \, \text{(or 90.5%)}.
\]

This means there is approximately 90.5% confidence that the true proportion of undecided voters lies between 60% and 68%. Among the given options, the closest match is 90.4%.
