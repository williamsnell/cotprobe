Question:

A traffic accident occurred at a road intersection. A motorcycle, a car, and a truck were involved. The motorcyclist was injured and brought suit against the driver of the car and the driver of the truck. The jury returned a verdict finding that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three of the parties. The jury assigned 55 percent of the fault for the motorcyclist's injuries to the motorcyclist, 25 percent to the driver of the car, and 20 percent to the driver of the truck. The jury found that the amount of the motorcyclist's injuries was$100,000. The motorcyclist enforces the judgment against the driver of the car and collects $45,000 from the driver of the car. If the driver of the car then brings an action against the driver of the truck for contribution, the driver of the car should

Options:

A: recover $5,000.
B: recover $45,000, the amount he paid to the motorcyclist.
C: recover $35,000.
D: recover $25,000.
E: recover nothing, as he has already collected from the motorcyclist.
F: recover $20,000.
G: recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the driver of the truck.
H: recover $27,000.
I: recover $15,000.
J: recover $30,000.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law and contribution among tortfeasors. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The scenario is a traffic accident with a motorcycle, car, and truck. The motorcyclist sues the car and truck drivers. The jury finds that all three were negligent. They assign 55% fault to the motorcyclist, 25% to the car driver, and 20% to the truck driver. The total injury is $100,000.

So the motorcyclist's recovery is reduced by his own negligence. Wait, how does that work? I remember that in some states, if you're more than 50% at fault, you can't recover. But here, the motorcyclist is 55% at fault, so does he get anything? Hmm, but the question says the motorcyclist brought suit and the jury found the amount of injuries was $100,000. So I think the motorcyclist can recover, but his recovery is reduced by his own percentage. So he can recover 45% of the $100,000 because 100% -55% =45%. So 45% of 100k is $45,000. But wait, the question says he enforced the judgment against the car driver and collected $45,000 from him.

Wait, but the car driver was 25% at fault, truck driver 20%. So the motorcyclist could have sued both, but in the suit, the car driver is found 25% liable. So the motorcyclist gets $45,000 from the car driver, but what about the truck driver? Did the motorcyclist collect from him? The question says he enforced against the car driver and collected $45k. So I guess the truck driver wasn't paid yet, or maybe the motorcyclist didn't sue him. But that's probably not relevant for this question.

Now, the car driver is suing the truck driver for contribution. So the question is about contribution among joint tortfeasors. I remember that in some jurisdictions, when multiple tortfeasors are involved, each is jointly and severally liable for the plaintiff's damages, but they can seek contribution from each other.

In the past, the rule was that each tortfeasor is liable for the entire amount, but now many states have moved to a system where liability is several, meaning each is only liable for their portion of fault. But I'm not sure how that affects contribution.

Wait, the car driver paid $45,000 to the motorcyclist. But the car driver's fault was 25%, so his share should be 25% of $100k, which is $25,000. But he paid $45k, which is more than his share. So he can seek contribution from the truck driver for the excess.

The truck driver was 20% at fault, so their share is $20k. So the car driver overpaid by $20k (since he was supposed to pay $25k but paid $45k) â€” wait, no. Wait, the total the motorcyclist can recover is $45k (because 55% fault). So the total liability of all tortfeasors is $45k, right? Because the plaintiff can't recover more than that.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Total damages are $100k, but the plaintiff is 55% at fault. So their recovery is 45% of $100k, which is $45k. So the total liability of the defendants is $45k. The defendants are the car driver (25%) and the truck driver (20%). So together, their combined fault is 45%, which matches the plaintiff's recovery.

So each defendant is liable for their percentage of the $45k. So the car driver's share is 25% of 45k, which is $11,250. The truck driver's share is 20% of 45k, which is $9,000.

Wait, but the car driver paid $45k to the plaintiff. So he paid the entire amount that the plaintiff was entitled to. So the truck driver hasn't paid anything yet. So the car driver is seeking contribution from the truck driver for the truck driver's share.

So the car driver paid $45k. The total that should have been paid by both is $45k. The car driver's share is $11,250, and the truck driver's is $9,000. So the car driver overpaid by $45k - $11,250 = $33,750. Therefore, the truck driver should reimburse him for $9,000, which is the truck driver's share.

Wait, but the options don't have $9,000. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 5k

B: 45k

C:35k

D:25k

E: nothing

F:20k

G: nothing, more at fault

H:27k

I:15k

J:30k

Hmm, none of these is 9k. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think differently. In some jurisdictions, when a defendant pays more than their share, they can seek contribution from other defendants for the excess. So the car driver paid $45k, but his share is 25% of the total damages allocated to the defendants, which is 25% of $45k (since the plaintiff can only recover $45k). So 25% of 45k is 11,250. So he paid 45k, so the excess is 45k - 11,250 = 33,750. So he can seek 33,750 from the other defendants. But the truck driver is only 20% of the defendants' total fault (25+20=45). So 20/45 of the total $45k is 20/45 * 45k = 20k. So the truck driver's share is 20k.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the total liability is $45k. The car's share is 25% of 45k, which is 11,250. Truck's is 20% of 45k, which is 9,000. So together, 20k. So the car driver paid 45k, which is 45k - (11,250 +9,000) = 45k-20k=25k. So he overpaid by 25k beyond the total. So the car driver can seek contribution from the truck driver for the truck driver's share, which is 9k.

But the options don't have 9k. Wait, perhaps in some states, the contribution is based on the percentage of fault among the defendants. So the car driver's fault is 25%, truck's 20%, total 45%. So the truck's proportion is 20/45, which is 4/9. So the car driver can recover 4/9 of the $45k? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the total amount the car driver should pay is 25% of the total damages, which is 25% of 100k, but the plaintiff's recovery was 45k. So maybe the car driver's liability is 25% of 100k, which is 25k, but the plaintiff could only recover 45k. So the car driver's share is 25k, but he paid 45k. So he can seek 20k from the truck driver, who is 20% liable. Because 20k is the truck's share of the 45k.

Wait, that would make sense. So the car driver should recover 20k from the truck driver, which is option F.

But wait, let me double-check. If the total the plaintiff can recover is 45k, and the car driver paid all of it, then the truck driver should pay their share, which is 20% of 45k, which is 9k. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the truck driver's share is 20% of the total 100k, which is 20k, but the plaintiff's recovery is 45k, so the truck's share is 20k * (45/100) = 9k.

Alternatively, perhaps the car driver can only recover up to the truck driver's proportionate share of the total damages. So the truck driver is 20% liable for the 100k, which is 20k. So the car driver can recover 20k from the truck driver, because the truck driver is 20% at fault, making their share 20k of the total 100k. But the plaintiff only recovered 45k, which is 45% of 100k. So the car driver's share is 25% of 100k, which is 25k, but he paid 45k. So the excess is 20k, which is what the truck driver should pay.

Wait, that makes sense. So the car driver can recover 20k from the truck driver, which is option F.

So I think the answer is F: recover $20,000.

The question involves a traffic accident where a motorcyclist, a car driver, and a truck driver were found negligent. The motorcyclist's injuries were valued at $100,000, but due to their 55% fault, their recovery was limited to $45,000. The car driver and truck driver were assigned 25% and 20% fault, respectively. The motorcyclist collected the full $45,000 from the car driver, who then sued the truck driver for contribution.

In this case, the car driver overpaid by paying the entire $45,000, as their proportionate share of liability was $25,000 (25% of $100,000). The truck driver's share, based on their 20% fault, was $20,000. Therefore, the car driver can seek contribution from the truck driver for the truck driver's share of the liability, which is $20,000.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: recover $20,000.**
