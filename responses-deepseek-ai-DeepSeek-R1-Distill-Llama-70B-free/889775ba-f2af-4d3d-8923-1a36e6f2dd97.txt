Options:

A: 2.4 × 10^-19 C
B: 6.4 × 10^-19 C
C: 8.0 × 10^-19 C
D: 4.8 × 10^-19 C

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the charge on an oil drop. Hmm, I remember that this relates to the Millikan oil drop experiment, right? Millikan's experiment was all about determining the elementary charge, which is the charge of a single electron. So the idea is that the charge on the oil drops should be multiples of this elementary charge.

Wait, right, the oil drops get charged by friction when they're sprayed, and then their charge is measured. Since electrons have a negative charge, the oil drops pick up a certain number of electrons. So the charge should be an integer multiple of e, which is approximately 1.6 × 10^-19 coulombs.

Looking at the options here, let me calculate each one and see if they fit into being a multiple of e. Let me jot them down:

Option A: 2.4e-19 C
Option B: 6.4e-19 C
Option C: 8.0e-19 C
Option D: 4.8e-19 C

So each of these is supposed to be a multiple of e. Let's check each one.

Starting with Option A: 2.4e-19. If e is about 1.6e-19, then 2.4 divided by 1.6 is 1.5. Wait, that's 1.5 times e. But charge should be an integer multiple, like 1e, 2e, 3e, etc. So 1.5e would mean a half-integer, which isn't possible because you can't have half an electron charge. So A might be the wrong one. But wait, maybe I should check all options.

Option B: 6.4e-19. Divide by 1.6e-19, that's 4. So 4e, which is a whole number. So B is okay.

Option C: 8.0e-19. 8 divided by 1.6 is 5. So 5e, which is fine. So C is acceptable.

Option D:4.8e-19. Dividing by 1.6 gives 3. So 3e, which is also a whole number. So D is okay.

So the only one that doesn't fit is A, because it's 1.5e, which isn't an integer multiple. Therefore, this measurement would be rejected as incorrect. So the answer should be option A.

The charge on an oil drop should be an integer multiple of the elementary charge \( e \), which is approximately \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). This is based on the principle that charge is quantized, meaning it cannot exist in fractions of \( e \). Let us analyze each option:

- **Option A: \( 2.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)**  
  Dividing \( 2.4 \times 10^{-19} \) by \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \) gives \( 1.5 \), which is not an integer. This is inconsistent with the quantization of charge.

- **Option B: \( 6.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)**  
  Dividing \( 6.4 \times 10^{-19} \) by \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \) gives \( 4 \), which is an integer. This is consistent with the quantization of charge.

- **Option C: \( 8.0 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)**  
  Dividing \( 8.0 \times 10^{-19} \) by \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \) gives \( 5 \), which is an integer. This is consistent with the quantization of charge.

- **Option D: \( 4.8 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)**  
  Dividing \( 4.8 \times 10^{-19} \) by \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \) gives \( 3 \), which is an integer. This is consistent with the quantization of charge.

The only measurement that does not fit the principle of charge quantization is **Option A**, as it results in a non-integer multiple of \( e \). Therefore, this measurement should be rejected as highly unlikely to be correct.
