Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about colorblindness. Hmm, I remember that colorblindness, specifically red-green, is a common X-linked recessive trait. Let me think about how that works.

The question says that a normal-visioned woman, whose father was colorblind, marries a normal-visioned man. We need to find the probability that their first child will be colorblind.

Wait, wait. Let me break this down. The woman has normal vision, but her father was colorblind. Since colorblindness is X-linked recessive, and the father passes his X to his daughter, that means the woman must have one X with the colorblind gene and one normal X. Because the father can only give his X (since he gives Y to the son), the woman's genotype must be a carrier. So her genotype is XcX, right? Because her dad gave her the Xc (colorblind allele) and her mom must have given a normal X, X.

The man she's marrying has normal vision. Since the man's X comes from his mother, and he's normal, his genotype must be XY, where the X is normal. So for the X chromosome, his genotype is X (normal) and Y.

Now, I need to figure out the possible children. Let's consider the possible gametes each parent can contribute.

The woman (XcX) can produce two types of eggs: one with Xc and one with X (normal). Each has a 50% chance. The man (XY) can produce two types of sperm: X (normal) and Y. Each with 50% chance.

So when they have a child, the possibilities are:

- If the child is a girl (gets X from dad and X from mom):
  - Mom's X could be Xc or X. So possible combinations are Xc (from mom) and X (from dad) → XcX, which would be a carrier like her mom.
  - Or X (from mom) and X (from dad) → XX, which is normal.

- If the child is a boy (gets Y from dad and X from mom):
  - The X from mom could be Xc or X. So possibilities are XcY (colorblind) or XY (normal).

Wait, but the question is about the first child being colorblind. So let's calculate the probabilities.

For a son to be colorblind, he must inherit the Xc from the mother. The chance of that is 50%, because the mom has a 50% chance of passing Xc.

Daughters can't be colorblind because they have two X's. They might be carriers (if they get Xc from mom and X from dad), but not colorblind themselves.

So the chance that a child is colorblind is the same as the probability that the child is a son and received the Xc.

Probability of having a son is 50% (since each child has an equal chance of being male or female).

So the overall probability is the chance of being a son multiplied by the chance he gets Xc.

That's 0.5 (for being a son) multiplied by 0.5 (Xc from mom) → 0.25, or 25% chance.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says the woman's father was colorblind. So the woman must have gotten his Xc. So her genotype is Xc from dad and X from mom. So yeah, she's XcX.

When she has a son, the son gets her X (either Xc or X) and the Y from dad. So 50% chance of XcY (colorblind) and 50% XY (normal).

So for sons, 50% chance of being colorblind. But the overall probability is for any child, not just sons.

Wait, no. Because only sons can be colorblind. Daughters will have two X's, so even if they get Xc, they have another X so they won't be colorblind.

So the probability that the child is colorblind is the probability that the child is male AND received the Xc.

The probability the child is male is 1/2. The probability that a male child is colorblind is 1/2. So overall probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

So the chance is 25%, which is 1/4. Looking at the options, option G is 1/4.

To determine the probability that the first child of a normal-visioned woman (whose father was colorblind) and a normal-visioned man will be colorblind, we analyze the genetic inheritance of the X-linked recessive gene for red-green colorblindness.

1. **The woman's genotype**: Since the woman has normal vision but her father was colorblind, she must be a carrier of the colorblind gene. Her genotype is **XcX**, where **Xc** is the colorblind allele inherited from her father, and **X** is the normal allele inherited from her mother.

2. **The man's genotype**: The man has normal vision, so his genotype is **XY**, where **X** is the normal allele and **Y** is the male sex chromosome.

3. **Gametes and offspring probabilities**:
   - The woman can produce two types of eggs: **Xc** (50% chance) and **X** (50% chance).
   - The man can produce two types of sperm: **X** (50% chance) and **Y** (50% chance).

   Combining these, the possible genotypes for their children are:
   - **Daughters**: **XcX** (carrier, 50% chance) or **XX** (normal, 50% chance).
   - **Sons**: **XcY** (colorblind, 50% chance) or **XY** (normal, 50% chance).

4. **Probability of colorblindness**:
   - Colorblindness only occurs in males who inherit the **Xc** allele from the mother. The probability of having a son is 50%, and the probability that the son inherits the **Xc** allele is also 50%. Therefore, the overall probability of having a colorblind child is:
     \[
     P(\text{colorblind child}) = P(\text{male}) \times P(\text{Xc from mother}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
     \]

Thus, the probability that their first child will be colorblind is **1/4**.
