Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me about α-thalassemia. Hmm, I remember that thalassemia has to do with hemoglobin production. Let me think through this step by step.

So the question is about a couple coming in for preconceptional genetic counseling. Both have a family history of α-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration, and genetic studies show a single gene deletion. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion, which is in trans configuration.

Wait, I need to clarify the genetics here. α-thalassemia is caused by mutations in the HBA1/2 genes on chromosome 16. Each person has two α-globin genes, one from each parent. So the number of deletions determines the severity.

The woman has a single gene deletion. That would mean she's heterozygous, right? Like, one normal gene and one deleted. So her genotype would be something like α/α^0, where α is normal and α^0 is the deletion.

The man has a two-gene deletion. Oh, but wait, the two-gene deletion is in trans. Trans configuration means that each gene deletion is on a different chromosome. So for α-thalassemia, a two-gene deletion would typically present as more severe. But in this case, if both are deleted but in trans, his genotype would be α^0/α^0? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, no. Each chromosome has two α-globin genes, right? Or wait, no, each chromosome (each allele) has one. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, each person has two α-globin genes, located on each of the two copies of chromosome 16. So normally, it's αα (homozygous normal). If one gene is deleted, it's α/− (where − represents the deletion), which is α-thalassemia trait (mild). If both are deleted on the same chromosome, that would be −/−, which is more severe, like Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis. But if the two deletions are on different chromosomes, like each chromosome has one deletion, then the genotype is −α/−α? Or wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the types. α-thalassemia can be due to deletions or mutations. The most common form is the deletion of one or more of the four α-globin genes (but wait, wait, humans have four? Or two? Maybe that's where I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Oh, right, humans have two α-globin genes on each chromosome 16, so four in total. So a person with two normal chromosomes would have four α-globin genes. Deletions can affect one, two, three, or all four genes.

Wait, no, wait. Each chromosome has two α-globin genes. So each person has four in total. So for each chromosome, it's two genes. So when we talk about α-thalassemia, the number of gene deletions determines the phenotype.

In this case, the woman has a single gene deletion. So, wait, does that mean she's missing one out of the four α-globin genes? Or maybe she's missing one of the two on a chromosome? Let me think.

Wait, I think each chromosome has two genes, so each parent contributes one chromosome. So for each α-globin gene locus, each chromosome has two genes. So a single gene deletion would mean that, on one chromosome, one of the two α genes is deleted. So her genotype would be αα/α−, where − is a deletion. So she's missing one gene. So she has three out of four α-globin genes. That's why she has a minimally decreased hemoglobin. Because she's got three functional genes, which is enough to be almost normal, just a bit low.

The man has a two-gene deletion. But it's in trans. So, his genotype would be α−/α−, meaning each chromosome has one deletion. Or wait, no. If he has two deletions in trans, that would mean each of his two chromosomes has one deletion. So for each chromosome, he's missing one α-globin gene. So his genotype is α−/α−. Wait, but each chromosome has two genes, so α− would mean that one of the two is deleted on each chromosome, making a total of two deletions. So in his case, he has two deletions, each on different chromosomes.

Wait, but wait. So the man's genotype is α−/α−, meaning each of his two chromosomes (each from his parents) has one deletion. So each chromosome has one normal and one deleted gene. Therefore, in total, he has two normal genes and two deleted genes (but spread across each chromosome as one each). So he has two functional α-globin genes, which is why he has microcytic anemia, which is more severe than the woman's condition.

Wait, but microcytic anemia in α-thalassemia is typically seen when there are two gene deletions. So if the man has two deletions, he's in the α-thalassemia trait, which can cause microcytic anemia but usually doesn't require transfusions.

Now, the question is about their offspring. The parents are the woman with a single gene deletion (so genotype perhaps αα/α−, but I'm getting a bit confused) and the man with two deletions in trans (so α−/α−). Wait, no, perhaps I should model this more accurately.

Wait, let me think in terms of alleles. Each parent contributes one allele (chromosome) to the offspring. So each allele has two α-globin genes. Wait, no, each chromosome has two genes, but when considering alleles, perhaps each allele is a combination. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think in terms of each parent's possible gametes.

Let me define the woman and man's genotypes properly.

The woman has a single gene deletion. Since each chromosome has two α-globin genes, this would mean that on one of her chromosomes, one of the two genes is deleted. So her genotype is α^A α^G / α^A −, where the − represents a deletion of one gene on the second chromosome. Wait, perhaps a better notation is to represent each chromosome as having two genes. So each chromosome can be normal (both genes present) or have one deletion.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each chromosome as either normal (both genes intact) or deleted (one gene missing). So the woman has one chromosome with one deletion (so only one functional gene on that chromosome) and one normal chromosome (two functional genes). So her genotype is (αα)/(α−), but I'm not sure if that's the standard way to write it. Alternatively, each chromosome is either normal (two genes) or has one deletion (so one gene).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it with the standard genetic counseling approach.

In α-thalassemia, the most common deletions involve one or both of the two α-globin genes on a chromosome. So when someone has a single gene deletion, their genotype is that one of their two chromosomes has one gene missing. So for example, the woman has one chromosome with two α genes (normal) and one chromosome with one α gene (one deletion). So her genotype can be written as (αα)/ (α−), but perhaps more accurately, each chromosome is either −α or αα.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model each parent's possible gametes.

The woman has a single gene deletion. So each of her chromosomes: one has two α genes (normal), the other has one α gene (one deletion). So when she produces gametes, each gamete will get one of her chromosomes. So 50% chance of passing the normal chromosome (with two α genes) and 50% chance of passing the chromosome with one deletion (so one α gene).

The man has a two-gene deletion in trans. So each of his chromosomes has one deletion. So each chromosome has one α gene. So his genotype would be (α−)/(α−), meaning each of his chromosomes contributes only one α gene. Therefore, when he produces gametes, each gamete will get one of his chromosomes, which each have one α gene. So 100% of his gametes will carry a chromosome with one α gene (because both his chromosomes are the same in this regard).

Wait, no, wait. If the two deletions are in trans, that means each chromosome has one deletion. So each chromosome has one functional α gene and one deleted. So when he produces gametes, each gamete will receive one of his two chromosomes, each of which has one α gene. So all his gametes will have one α gene.

So the woman can give either a chromosome with two α genes or one with one α gene. The man can only give a chromosome with one α gene.

So let's model the possible offspring.

Each child will get one chromosome from each parent.

The woman's possible contributions:

50% chance of giving a chromosome with two α genes (normal, let's call this A).

50% chance of giving a chromosome with one α gene (let's call this a).

The man's contributions:

100% chance of giving a chromosome with one α gene (a).

So the possible combinations are:

- Woman gives A, man gives a: child has A (two α) and a (one α). So total of three α genes. So the child would have three α genes, which is the same as the woman's case. So the child would have a single gene deletion, same as the woman, but wait, no—the number of α genes determines the phenotype.

Wait, let me think about how many α genes each child would have.

Each chromosome contributes a certain number of α genes. The woman's A chromosome has two α genes, her a chromosome has one. The man's a chromosome has one α gene.

So the possible offspring's genotype would be:

Case 1: Woman's A (2 α) + Man's a (1 α). Total α genes = 3.

Case 2: Woman's a (1 α) + Man's a (1 α). Total α genes = 2.

So each child has either 3 or 2 α genes.

Now, the question is about the percentage of offspring that have a two-gene deletion. Wait, wait. Wait, the two-gene deletion refers to the number of α-globin genes they have. So a person with two α genes would have two copies, so their genotype would be αα/− −? Or perhaps, no, because each chromosome has two genes.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the phenotypes based on the number of α genes.

In α-thalassemia:

- Normal: 4 α genes (two on each chromosome). Phenotype normal.

- Silent carrier: 3 α genes (one chromosome has a deletion, so one gene missing). Usually asymptomatic or mild.

- α-thalassemia trait: 2 α genes. May have microcytic anemia.

- HbH disease: 1 α gene. More severe.

- Homozygous (−/−): 0 α genes. Usually not viable without transfusions (Bart's hydrops fetalis).

So in this case, the woman has 3 α genes (so she's a silent carrier with minimal symptoms), and the man has 2 α genes (so α-thalassemia trait, microcytic anemia).

So their children can have either 3 or 2 α genes.

So the possible outcomes:

Each child has a 50% chance of getting the woman's A chromosome (2 α) + man's a (1 α) → total 3 α genes.

Each child has a 50% chance of getting the woman's a (1 α) + man's a (1 α) → total 2 α genes.

So half the children will have 3 α genes (like the woman), and half will have 2 α genes (like the man).

Wait, but the question is, which percentage of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion. So a two-gene deletion would mean that the child has two α genes. Because each parent contributes one chromosome, and each chromosome may have one or two α genes. So in the case where the child has two α genes, that comes from the woman's a (1) and the man's a (1).

So the percentage is 50% of the offspring having two α genes (so two-gene deletion?), but wait, no. Because the number of α genes is four in normal, so two would be two deletions.

Wait, no, the two-gene deletion refers to each chromosome having a deletion. Or perhaps the total number of α genes. So the child with two α genes would have two functioning genes out of four, implying two deletions.

So the question is asking what percentage of their children will have a two-gene deletion. So that's when the child has two α genes. Which happens in 50% of cases.

But wait, looking back at the options: option B is 50%. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck, because I might have made a mistake.

The woman is αα/α− (so three α genes), and the man is α−/α− (so two α genes). Wait, no, if the man has two-gene deletions in trans, that would mean each of his chromosomes has a single deletion, so each contributes one α gene. So his genotype is α−/α−, meaning each of his chromosomes has one α gene. So when he has children, he can only pass on a chromosome with one α gene.

The woman has one chromosome with two α, and one with one α. So when she has a child, there's a 50% chance she gives the two α chromosome, and 50% she gives the one α.

So the possible offspring genotypes are:

- 50%: two α (mom) + one α (dad) = three α genes.

- 50%: one α (mom) + one α (dad) = two α genes.

So the children have a 50% chance of having two α genes, which would mean they have α-thalassemia trait, like their father.

So the percentage is 50%, which is option B.
</think>

To determine the percentage of offspring who will have a two-gene deletion, we analyze the genotypes of the couple and the inheritance pattern of α-thalassemia.

### Key Information:
1. **Woman's Genotype**: She has a single gene deletion, meaning one of her chromosomes has one α-globin gene missing. Her genotype can be represented as **αα/α−**, where:
   - **αα**: One normal chromosome with two α-globin genes.
   - **α−**: One chromosome with one α-globin gene (one deletion).

   When producing gametes:
   - 50% chance of passing the normal chromosome (**αα**).
   - 50% chance of passing the chromosome with one deletion (**α−**).

2. **Man's Genotype**: He has a two-gene deletion in **trans**, meaning each of his chromosomes has one α-globin gene missing. His genotype is **α−/α−**, where both chromosomes have one α-globin gene. When producing gametes:
   - 100% chance of passing a chromosome with one α-globin gene (**α−**).

3. **Offspring Genotypes**:
   - Each child inherits one chromosome from each parent.
   - Possible combinations:
     - **50% chance**: The woman passes **αα** (normal chromosome), and the man passes **α−**. The child has **αα + α−**, resulting in **three α-globin genes** (like the woman).
     - **50% chance**: The woman passes **α−** (one deletion), and the man passes **α−**. The child has **α− + α−**, resulting in **two α-globin genes** (like the man).

4. **Phenotypic Implications**:
   - A child with **three α-globin genes** (50% chance) will be asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms (silent carrier).
   - A child with **two α-globin genes** (50% chance) will have **α-thalassemia trait**, characterized by microcytic anemia.

### Conclusion:
50% of the couple's offspring will inherit a two-gene deletion, resulting in α-thalassemia trait.
