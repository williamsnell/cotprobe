Okay, so I've got this electric dipole problem here. Let's see. An electric dipole has two equal but opposite charges, right? And the question is about finding the electric field strength at the midpoint between them. Hmm.

Alright, the charges are 4.0 nC each. Oh wait, but one is positive and the other negative since they're opposite. They're separated by 2.0 cm, which is 0.02 meters. The point we're looking at is the midpoint, so that's 0.01 meters from each charge.

I remember that the electric field due to a point charge is given by E = kQ / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, since these are point charges, each will contribute to the electric field at the midpoint.

So the midpoint is equidistant from both charges. Let me visualize it. The positive charge will create an electric field pointing away from it, so at the midpoint, that field would point to the right if the positive is on the left. The negative charge creates a field pointing towards itself, so at the midpoint, that field would also point to the right because the negative is on the right. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Let me make sure.

Wait, wait, the setup isn't given, so I have to assume the dipole is along a straight line, say horizontal. Let's say the positive charge is on the left, negative on the right. So the midpoint is in the middle. The field from the positive charge at midpoint points to the right (since field lines go away from positive). The field from the negative charge points towards the negative, which is to the right as well. So both fields are in the same direction. Oh wait, no, wait again. Because the negative charge is on the right, so the field at the midpoint due to the negative charge would be pointing towards the negative, which is to the right. So both fields are to the right. So they add up.

Wait, but wait a second: no! Wait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again. If the positive is on the left and the negative on the right, then the field from the positive at the midpoint is to the right. The field from the negative is toward the negative, which is also to the right. So both contribute in the same direction. So the total field is the sum of the two.

But wait, isn't the dipole's field at the midpoint zero? No, wait, isn't that only along the perpendicular bisector? Wait, no. Wait, when you're on the axis of the dipole, like the midpoint, the fields from each charge add. But wait, wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing with the case when you're along the perpendicular bisector. Let me think.

Wait, for a dipole, the electric field at a point on the axis (like the midpoint) is different than at a point on the perpendicular bisector. Let me recall: For a dipole, the field along the axis (like the line through the two charges) is different. Hmm.

Wait, the formula for the electric field on the axis of the dipole is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/(r³), where r is the distance from the center, and p is the dipole moment. But wait, wait, the dipole moment p is q*d, where d is the separation. So here, d is 0.02 m, q is 4.0e-9 C.

Wait, but wait, the midpoint is at r = d/2, which is 0.01 m. So substituting into the formula: E = (k * 2p) / r³. Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the electric field on the axis at a point a distance r from the center is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2 p) / r³. Since p = q*d, substituting, we get E = (2 k q d) / r³.

But wait, in this case, r is d/2, because the midpoint is halfway. So substituting r = d/2, we have E = (2 k q d) / ( (d/2) )^3 ) = (2 k q d) / (d³ / 8) ) = (2 k q d * 8 ) / d³ ) = (16 k q) / d².

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each field separately.

Each charge creates an electric field at the midpoint. Let me compute each and see. The positive charge, Q = 4e-9 C, is at a distance of 0.01 m. So E1 = k Q / r² = (8.988e9) * (4e-9) / (0.01)^2.

Wait, 0.01 squared is 0.0001, so 1e-4. So E1 is 8.988e9 * 4e-9 / 1e-4. Let me compute that. 8.988e9 *4e-9 is approximately 35.952. Dividing by 1e-4 is multiplying by 1e4, so 35.952e4, which is 3.5952e5 N/C.

Similarly, the negative charge will produce an electric field E2. The magnitude is the same, but the direction depends on the sign. So E2 is also 3.5952e5 N/C in magnitude, but since the charge is negative, the field points towards it. So at the midpoint, the negative is on the right, so E2 points to the right.

Wait, but earlier I thought that E1 and E2 are both to the right, so they add up. So total E is E1 + E2 = 7.19e5 N/C approximately.

Wait, let me compute the exact values. Let's compute E1: 

E1 = kQ/(r²) 
k = 8.988e9 N m²/C²
Q = 4.0e-9 C
r = 0.01 m
r² = 0.0001 m² = 1e-4 m².

So E1 = (8.988e9) * (4.0e-9) / (1e-4)
Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *4e-9 = (8.988 *4) * 1e0 = 35.952 * 1 = 35.952.

Divide by 1e-4: 35.952 / 0.0001 = 359520.

So E1 is 359,520 N/C. Similarly, E2 is the same magnitude because the charges are same magnitude, same distance. So E2 is also 359,520 N/C, but direction depends on the sign.

But wait, the positive charge creates a field to the right (away), the negative charge creates a field to the right (towards itself). So both E1 and E2 are in the same direction, so they add. So E_total = E1 + E2 = 359520 * 2 = 719,040 N/C.

Wait, that's 7.19e5 N/C. Looking at the options, let's see.

Options: 

A:9e4
B:7.2e5
C:1.8e5
D:1.2e6
E:6e5
F:5e5
G:3.6e5
H:8e5
I:2.5e5
J:0

So option B is 7.2e5, which is very close to our calculation of approximately 7.19e5. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, could I have made a mistake in the formula approach? Let me think again. Alternatively, the formula for the electric field at the midpoint of a dipole along its axis is E = (2kQ)/(d²) * (1/2), wait no, perhaps I should rederive it.

Wait, the dipole moment p = Q*d. The electric field along the axis at a distance r from the center is E = (2 k p) / r³. So p = Q*d, r is d/2. So substituting, E = 2k (Q d) / ( (d/2)^3 ) = 2k Q d / (d^3 / 8) ) = 2k Q * 8 / d² = (16 k Q) / d².

Wait, so let's compute that. k=8.988e9, Q=4e-9 C, d=0.02 m.

E = (16 * 8.988e9 *4e-9 ) / (0.02)^2.

Compute numerator: 16 * 8.988e9 = 143.808e9. Then multiply by 4e-9: 143.808e9 *4e-9 = 143.808 *4 * (1e9 *1e-9) )= 575.232 *1 = 575.232.

Denominator: (0.02)^2 = 0.0004 = 4e-4.

So E = 575.232 / 4e-4 = 575.232 / 0.0004. Let's compute that: 575.232 / 0.0004 = 575.232 * 2500 = ?

Well, 575 *2500=1,437,500. 0.232 *2500=580. So approximately 1,438,080 N/C.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, earlier approach gave me 7.19e5, which is 719,000. But this approach gives me 1.438e6 N/C, which is about 1.4 million. That's way larger than the multiple choice options.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I used the wrong formula.

Wait a minute, perhaps the formula I'm recalling is for a point along the axis but at a distance much larger than d, but in this case, the point is at the midpoint, which is at r = d/2, so the formula for the field on the axis when r is much larger than d is E = 2k p / r³. But when r is not much larger, perhaps this formula doesn't apply. Or perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, no, because in this case, r is d/2. So substituting into E = 2k p / r³, and p= Q d, so:

E = 2k (Q d) / ( (d/2)^3 )

So that's 2k Q d / (d^3 / 8) ) = (2k Q d *8 ) / d^3 ) = (16 k Q ) / d².

Wait, so that's correct. So plugging in the numbers: 16 * 8.988e9 * 4e-9 / (0.02)^2.

Wait, compute each part:

16 *8.988e9 = 143.808e9.

143.808e9 *4e-9 = 143.808 *4 *1e0 = 575.232.

Divide by (0.02)^2 = 0.0004. So 575.232 / 0.0004 = 1,438,080 N/C.

But earlier, using the direct method, each charge's field was 359,520 N/C, summing to 719,040 N/C.

There's a discrepancy here. Which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula approach. Let me think: the formula for the electric field on the axis (i.e., along the line connecting the charges) at a point r from the center is E = (2 k p) / r³. But when r is d/2, that's the midpoint, so the distance from each charge is d/2. So p = Q d.

So E = 2k (Q d) / ( (d/2)^3 )

Compute denominator: (d/2)^3 = d³ /8.

So E = 2k Q d *8 / d^3 = 16 k Q / d².

Which is what I did. So that should be correct.

Wait, but why does the direct method give a different answer? Because in the direct method, each charge produces a field of kQ/(r²) at the midpoint. Since r is d/2, each field is kQ/( (d/2)^2 ) = 4kQ/(d²). Since there are two charges, each contributing 4kQ/d², but in the same direction, the total is 8kQ/(d²).

Wait, but wait, 8k Q/(d^2) is the same as the formula approach. Because 16 k Q /d² would not match 8 k Q/d². So perhaps I made a mistake in the direct method. Let me check.

Wait, in the direct method, each charge's field is E = k Q / r², with r = d/2.

So for each charge, E1 = k Q / ( (d/2)^2 ) = 4 k Q / d².

So for two charges, since their fields are in the same direction, E_total = 2 * (4 k Q / d²) )= 8k Q /d².

Wait, but according to the formula approach, E = 16 k Q /d².

So which is correct? There's a factor of 2 discrepancy.

Hmm. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the field on the axis is E = (2 k p ) / r³, but when r is measured from the center. So in our case, r is d/2, so substituting, E = 2k (Q d) / ( (d/2)^3 ) = 16 k Q / d².

But according to the direct approach, each charge contributes 4kQ/d², so sum is 8k Q/d². So these two approaches give different results. That can't be.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the field when you're at a point along the axis but outside the dipole, meaning r >> d. But in our case, r = d/2, which is not much larger than d. Oh wait, no, because the dipole's size is d, and r is d/2. So the formula may not apply here.

Wait, perhaps the formula E = 2k p / r³ applies only when r is much larger than d. So in that case, using the formula when r is not much larger than d would give a wrong answer. So perhaps the direct method is more accurate here.

Let me calculate using the direct method.

Each charge contributes E = k Q / r².

r is 0.01 m.

E for each charge: (8.988e9) * (4e-9) / (0.01)^2.

Calculate numerator: 8.988e9 *4e-9 = 35.952.

Divide by (0.01)^2= 0.0001: 35.952 / 0.0001 = 359,520 N/C per charge.

Since both fields are in the same direction, the total is 359,520 * 2 = 719,040 N/C, which is approximately 7.19e5 N/C, matching option B:7.2e5.

Wait, but why does the formula approach give a different answer? Because I think the formula is for when the point is far away, so r is much greater than d. When the point is at the midpoint, the formula may not apply, and the direct method is correct.

So that makes sense. So the correct answer is 7.2e5 N/C, which is option B.

To determine the electric field strength at the midpoint between the charges of an electric dipole, we analyze the contributions from each charge. The dipole consists of two equal but opposite charges, each with magnitude \( Q = 4.0 \, \text{nC} = 4.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C} \), separated by a distance \( d = 2.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.02 \, \text{m} \). The midpoint is located at a distance \( r = d/2 = 0.01 \, \text{m} \) from each charge.

The electric field due to a point charge is given by:

\[
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
\]

where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) is Coulomb's constant. At the midpoint, the electric field from each charge has the same magnitude but points in the same direction because the positive charge creates a field pointing away from it (to the right), and the negative charge creates a field pointing toward it (also to the right). Thus, the total electric field is the sum of the fields from both charges.

### Step 1: Calculate the electric field from one charge
\[
E_1 = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E_1 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(4.0 \times 10^{-9})}{(0.01)^2}
\]
\[
E_1 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(4.0 \times 10^{-9})}{0.0001}
\]
\[
E_1 = \frac{35.952}{0.0001} = 359,520 \, \text{N/C}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total electric field
Since the fields from both charges are in the same direction, the total electric field is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2E_1
\]
\[
E_{\text{total}} = 2 \times 359,520 = 719,040 \, \text{N/C}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated electric field strength is approximately \( 7.19 \times 10^5 \, \text{N/C} \), which is closest to option **B: \( 7.2 \times 10^5 \, \text{N/C} \)**.

### Final Answer:
**B**
