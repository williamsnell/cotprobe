Question:

In 1985, a widow, the undisputed owner of a cottage, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when

Options:

A: the Boy Scouts of America discovered the gift in the will.

C: the tenant first moved into the cottage.
D: the widow left no heirs.
E: the widow died.

G: the widow first leased the cottage.
H: the Boy Scouts of America took legal action.

Okay, so I have this legal question about adverse possession, and I need to figure out when the statutory period started running for the tenant. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the facts. The widow leased her cottage to a tenant for seven years starting in 1985. The rent was monthly. Then in 1986, the widow died without any heirs. Her will left everything to the Boy Scouts, but the cottage wasn't specifically mentioned. So I think under the law, when someone dies and their will doesn't mention a specific asset, it usually goes into the residue, which means the Boy Scouts would get the cottage as part of the estate.

After the widow died, the tenant stayed on the property but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts didn't find out about the cottage until 2009 when their attorneys did an inventory.

The question is about when the statutory period for adverse possession began. The period is 20 years in this jurisdiction.

Adverse possession requires that the possession be open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, and continuous. The key here might be when the tenant's possession became hostile. Because the tenant had a lease, initially, they had the widow's permission to be there. So their possession wasn't adverse yet.

When does that change? Well, the lease was for seven years, so it would end in 1992. But the widow died in 1986, so after her death, who owns the property? The Boy Scouts, as beneficiaries of the will. So the lease was originally with the widow, but upon her death, the lease would transfer to her estate, which is now the Boy Scouts.

Wait, but the tenant's lease was for seven years. So even after the widow dies, the lease continues because the tenant has a legal right to stay until the lease ends. So from 1986 to 1992, the tenant is still a tenant under the lease, paying rent. But in this case, the tenant stopped paying rent after the widow died. So when the widow died, the tenant continued to live there but didn't pay rent anymore. 

But here's the thing: stopping payment doesn't necessarily make the possession adverse. Because the lease was still valid. So the tenant was still in possession with the permission of the landlord (now the Boy Scouts through the estate). So until the lease ends, the tenant's possession is not adverse. Because they're still within the lease term.

Wait, but the lease ends in 1992. So from 1985 to 1992, it's the lease period. The widow dies in 1986, so the tenant has the lease until 1992. If the tenant stays beyond 1992 without a new lease, that's when they might start adverse possession. But in this scenario, the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986, right after the widow died.

But the lease was still in effect until 1992. So until 1992, the tenant had legal permission to be there. So their possession wasn't hostile or adverse. Even though they stopped paying rent, they were still within the lease term. So any claim of adverse possession would start after the lease ends.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. When the widow dies, the lease doesn't terminate. It continues with the new owner, the Boy Scouts. So the tenant is still a tenant under the lease, which runs until 1992. So if the tenant stops paying rent, the landlord (Boy Scouts) could evict them for non-payment, but the possession isn't adverse yet because the tenant is still within their lease. So the statutory period for adverse possession begins when the lease ends, and the tenant continues to stay without permission.

Alternatively, maybe the lease is considered terminated upon the widow's death? No, I don't think so. Leases typically survive the death of the landlord unless the lease says otherwise. So the lease continues, and the tenant is still lawfully in possession until 1992.

So if the tenant stops paying rent, the landlord could take action, but the tenant's possession is still legal until the lease ends. So the adverse possession period can't start until after the lease ends, because until then, the tenant has a legal right to be there.

Wait, but the question says the tenant's statutory period began when. The options are about events. Let's look at the options.

Option B is when the lease with the widow expired. So that would be 1992. But the question is, when did the period start? So the period would start when the tenant's possession becomes adverse. So the period can't start while the lease is still in effect. So until 1992, the tenant is a tenant, so no adverse possession.

But wait, perhaps the tenant's continued possession after the lease term is when it starts. So the lease is for seven years from 1985, so 1992. So from 1992 onwards, the tenant is without permission, so that's when the adverse possession starts.

But the question is, when did the tenant's statutory period begin to run? So the answer would be when the lease expired, because that's when they no longer had permission.

Alternatively, let's think about the point when the tenant was in possession without the owner's permission. The owner is the Boy Scouts after the widow's death. So the lease was valid until 1992. So even though the tenant stopped paying rent, they were still in possession under the lease, so the possession wasn't adverse.

So the period for adverse possession begins when the lease ends, and the tenant continues to possess without permission. So that would be 1992. So the statutory period started in 1992, which is when the lease expired.

Looking at the options, option B says when the tenant's lease with the widow expired. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but another angle: The lease was with the widow, but upon her death, the new owner is the Boy Scouts. So the lease continues, but now the tenant is a tenant of the Boy Scouts. So the lease doesn't end until 1992. So the tenant's possession was lawful until then.

So the statutory period for adverse possession would begin when the tenant's lease ended, which is option B.

Another option is option E, when the widow died. But that's when the ownership transferred, but the lease was still in effect, so the tenant's possession was still lawful.

Option I is when the tenant stopped paying rent. But again, the lease was still in effect, so non-payment doesn't make it adverse. The landlord could evict for non-payment, but until the lease ends, the tenant is still within their rights to be there.

So the correct start time is when the lease ends, which is option B.

To determine when the statutory period for adverse possession began, it is essential to analyze the facts and the legal principles involved. Adverse possession requires that the possession be open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, and continuous. Initially, the tenant had the widow's permission to occupy the cottage under a valid lease agreement. This lease was for a term of seven years, beginning in 1985 and expiring in 1992. During this time, the tenant's possession was legal and not adverse, even after the widow's death in 1986, because the lease survived and transferred to the new owner, the Boy Scouts of America.

The tenant's possession could only become adverse after the lease expired in 1992, as that is when the tenant no longer had permission to occupy the property. Until then, the tenant's presence was lawful under the terms of the lease, even though they stopped paying rent. Stopping rent payments did not make the possession adverse, as the tenant was still within the lease term.

Analyzing the options:

- **A:** The Boy Scouts discovering the gift in 2009 is irrelevant because the statutory period would have already begun long before this.
- **B:** The lease expiring in 1992 is correct because this is when the tenant's legal permission to occupy the property ended, and their possession could become adverse.
- **C:** The tenant moving in is incorrect because the possession was lawful under the lease.
- **D:** The widow leaving no heirs is irrelevant because the property passed to the Boy Scouts through the will.
- **E:** The widow dying is incorrect because the lease continued after her death.
- **F:** The tenant signing the lease is incorrect because the lease was valid and permission was granted.
- **G:** The widow leasing the cottage is incorrect for the same reason as F.
- **H:** The Boy Scouts taking legal action is irrelevant because the statutory period is based on the tenant's adverse possession, not legal challenges.
- **I:** The tenant stopping rent payments is incorrect because the lease was still in effect, so the possession was not yet adverse.
- **J:** The tenant's subjective belief is irrelevant because adverse possession is based on objective facts, not the tenant's beliefs.

The statutory period for adverse possession began when the tenant's lease with the widow expired in 1992, as this is when the tenant's possession could first become adverse.
