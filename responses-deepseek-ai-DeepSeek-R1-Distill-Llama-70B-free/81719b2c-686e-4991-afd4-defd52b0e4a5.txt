Question:

A plaintiff was driving her car when she stopped at a red light at an intersection. A defendant, who was behind her, did not see the red light and failed to stop. He crashed into the rear of the woman's car and pushed her onto the curb and into a tree. When the plaintiff got out of her car, she felt fine physically, but was emotionally upset when she saw that the hood and trunk of her car were severely damaged. The next day she received an estimate from the mechanic for $1,950 to repair her car. She consulted an attorney the following afternoon and, that evening, suddenly developed shooting back pains. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the defendant based on a theory of negligence. One day prior to trial, two years after the accident, the plaintiff went to take a photograph of the accident scene. At trial, the photograph is

Options:

A: admissible, if the photograph correctly and accurately portrayed the accident scene.
B: admissible, if the photograph was taken by a professional photographer.
C: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph was taken two years after the accident.
D: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph does not show the damage to the plaintiff's car.
E: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph might influence the jury's opinion unfairly.
F: admissible, if the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conditions at the scene of the accident were the same as when the photograph was taken.
G: admissible, if the plaintiff identifies the photograph at trial.
H: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph was not taken immediately after the accident.
I: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph is non-verbal hearsay.
J: admissible, if the plaintiff can prove the photograph has not been altered in any way.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of a photograph in a trial. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is about a car accident where the plaintiff's car was damaged, and she is suing the defendant for negligence. The key point here is about the admissibility of a photograph taken one day before the trial, which is two years after the accident.

From what I remember, the general rule for admitting photographs or any evidence is that it must be relevant and not unfairly prejudicial. But for photographs, especially those taken after the event, there's an additional consideration about whether they accurately represent the scene at the time of the event.

So, the photograph in question was taken two years later. The concern here is whether the scene has changed in those two years. If the conditions are the same as at the time of the accident, then the photograph would be admissible. But if things have changed, like new signs, different road markings, or any alterations to the area, then the photograph might not accurately reflect the accident scene.

I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 401, evidence is relevant if it has a tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. But for photographs taken later, the issue is authentication. Rule 901 requires that the proponent of the evidence must authenticate it, showing it's what it's claimed to be. For a photograph of a scene, this might involve a witness testifying that the photo accurately depicts the scene as it was at the relevant time.

Wait, but in this case, the plaintiff took the photo herself a day before trial. So she can testify that the scene hasn't changed, or if it has, explain any differences. Alternatively, if she can show that the conditions are the same, then the photo would be admissible.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Admissible if it correctly portrays the scene. That makes sense because accuracy is key. But does the timing affect this? It doesn't say anything about when it was taken, just that it's accurate.

Option F: Admissible if the plaintiff can show conditions were the same. That seems to align with what I was thinking. The photo's admissibility hinges on whether the scene hasn't changed.

Option G: Admissible if the plaintiff identifies it. Identification is part of authentication, but that alone isn't enough if the scene has changed.

Option C and H: They say inadmissible if the defendant objects because of the timing. But I don't think a delay alone makes it inadmissible. It's more about whether the scene is the same.

Option D: Inadmissible because it doesn't show car damage. But the question is about the accident scene, not the car damage. The car damage is already established with the mechanic's estimate.

Option E: Unfair influence. Photographs can be prejudicial, but that's a separate issue. The question doesn't suggest the photo is gruesome or anything; it's just a scene.

Option J: Prove it hasn't been altered. That's part of authentication, but the main issue here is the timing and whether the scene is the same.

So the correct answer should be F. The photograph is admissible if the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conditions were the same as when the photo was taken. That would authenticate it as a fair representation of the accident scene.

The admissibility of the photograph hinges on whether it accurately represents the accident scene at the time of the event. Under evidence law, photographs must be authenticated to ensure they fairly depict the scene. Since the photograph was taken two years after the accident, the key issue is whether the conditions at the scene remained unchanged. If the plaintiff can demonstrate that the scene's conditions were the same when the photograph was taken, the photograph would be admissible. This aligns with the requirement that the evidence must be relevant and accurately reflect the circumstances it is intended to represent.

Answer: F
