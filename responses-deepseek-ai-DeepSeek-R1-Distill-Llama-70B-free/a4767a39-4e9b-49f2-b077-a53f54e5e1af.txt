Okay, I need to figure out the best estimate for 4,286 multiplied by 390. Hmm, let's see. I remember that estimating often involves rounding numbers to make the calculation easier. So maybe I should round both numbers to a more manageable form.

First, let's look at 4,286. That's a little more than 4,000, right? So I can round it to 4,000 for estimation purposes. And then 390 is almost 400, so I'll round that up too. So now the problem becomes 4,000 times 400.

Wait, how do I multiply these? Let's break it down. 4,000 times 400. Well, 4 times 4 is 16. But since both numbers have three zeros each, I need to add those zeros back. So 4,000 is 4 * 10^3 and 400 is 4 * 10^2. Multiplying those together gives 16 * 10^(3+2) = 16 * 10^5, which is 1,600,000.

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes rounding can change the answer a bit. The original numbers were 4,286 and 390. I rounded 4,286 down to 4,000, which is a bit less. And 390 up to 400, which is a bit more. So the estimate should be pretty close to the actual value.

Now looking at the options, I see option H is 1,600,000, which matches my calculation. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the rounding. 4,286 is 4.286 thousand, so rounding to 4,000 would make it a bit smaller. 390 is 3.9 hundred, so rounding to 400 makes it a bit larger. The two approximations might balance each other out, making the estimate accurate.

Alternatively, maybe I should do a quick exact calculation to check. Let's see, 4,286 * 390. Breaking it down: 4,286 * 400 would be 1,714,400. But since it's 390, which is 10 less than 400, I subtract 4,286 * 10, which is 42,860. So 1,714,400 minus 42,860 equals 1,671,540.

Oh, wait, so the exact value is about 1,671,540. My estimate was 1,600,000, which is a bit lower. But looking at the options, H is 1,600,000, which is the closest. So I think H is the right choice.

The best estimate for 4,286 × 390 is calculated by rounding the numbers to 4,000 and 400, respectively. Multiplying these gives 1,600,000. Comparing this to the exact calculation of 1,671,540, the estimate is slightly lower but remains the closest option provided.

The correct answer is H.
