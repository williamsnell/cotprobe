Okay, so I've got this math problem here about group theory, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the order of the group S_3 * Z_2. Hmm, the options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 4 to 24 and some others. 

First, I need to remember what S_3 and Z_2 are. S_3 is the symmetric group on 3 elements, right? So that's the group of all permutations of three objects. I think the order of S_3 is 6 because there are 3! = 6 permutations. Yeah, that makes sense. And Z_2 is the cyclic group of order 2, like the integers modulo 2. So its order is 2.

Now, the question is about the direct product of these two groups, S_3 * Z_2. The direct product of two groups has an order equal to the product of their individual orders. So I should multiply the order of S_3 by the order of Z_2. 

So order of S_3 is 6, order of Z_2 is 2. 6 multiplied by 2 is 12. So the order of S_3 * Z_2 should be 12. 

Wait, but wait a secondâ€”could this be a semidirect product instead? Because if it's a semidirect product, the order is still the product of the orders, right? Because whether it's direct or semidirect, the order is just the product. The structure changes, but the size remains the same. So in either case, the order is 12. 

Looking at the options, option H is 12. So the answer should be H.

The order of a direct product of two groups is the product of their individual orders. Here, \( S_3 \) (the symmetric group on 3 elements) has order \( 6 \), and \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) (the cyclic group of order 2) has order \( 2 \). Thus, the order of \( S_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \) is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \). This result holds regardless of whether the product is direct or semidirect, as the order depends only on the sizes of the groups involved.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

H: 12

Answer: H
