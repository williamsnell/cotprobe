Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a satellite accumulating charge and needing to find the surface charge density. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. I remember that surface charge density is related to the charge and the surface area of the object.

The satellite is spherical, right? So the formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4πr². Oh wait, but the problem gives me the diameter, not the radius. So I need to convert that. The diameter is 1.3 meters, so the radius would be half of that, which is 0.65 meters. Got it.

So the surface area A would be 4 * π * (0.65)^2. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 0.65 squared is 0.4225. Multiply that by 4π, so 4 * 3.1416 is about 12.5664. Then 12.5664 multiplied by 0.4225... Let me do that step by step. 12 times 0.4225 is 5.07, and 0.5664 times 0.4225 is roughly 0.5664 * 0.4 is 0.2265, plus 0.5664 * 0.0225 which is about 0.0127. So total is approximately 5.07 + 0.2265 + 0.0127 = around 5.31 square meters. Hmm, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, maybe just leave it as 4π*(0.65)^2 for exact calculation later.

The charge Q is given as 2.4 microcoulombs. Micro is 10^-6, so 2.4e-6 C. So the surface charge density σ is Q divided by A. So σ = Q / (4πr²).

Wait, let me write that down: σ = Q / (4πr²). So plugging in the numbers, Q is 2.4e-6 C, r is 0.65 m.

So 4π*(0.65)^2 is 4 * π * 0.4225. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.4225 * 4 is 1.69. Then 1.69 * π. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 1.69 * 3 is 5.07, 1.69 * 0.1416 is about 0.239. So total area is about 5.07 + 0.239 = 5.309 m².

So σ = 2.4e-6 C / 5.309 m². Let me compute that. 2.4 divided by 5.309 is approximately 0.452, and then 1e-6. So 0.452e-6 C/m², which is 4.52e-7 C/m². Wait, but wait, let me do the division more accurately.

2.4 / 5.309. Hmm, 5.309 times 0.45 is 5.309 * 0.4 = 2.1236, and 5.309 * 0.05 is 0.26545. So 2.1236 + 0.26545 = 2.38905. But 2.4 is a bit higher, so maybe 0.452 or so. So 0.452 *1e-6 is 4.52e-7.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option G is 4.5e-7, which is very close. Option A is 7.3e-7, which is higher. Option C is 5.8e-7. So maybe I miscalculated somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the surface area. 0.65 m radius. So surface area is 4πr². Let's compute r squared: 0.65 * 0.65 = 0.4225. Then 4π times that: 4 * 3.14159265 * 0.4225.

Calculating 4 * 0.4225 first: that's 1.69.

1.69 * π: let's compute it precisely. 1.69 * 3 =5.07, 1.69 * 0.14159265 = let's compute 1.69 * 0.1 =0.169, 1.69 * 0.04159265 ≈ 1.69 *0.04=0.0676, and 1.69*0.00159265≈0.00269. So 0.169 + 0.0676=0.2366 + 0.00269=0.2393. So total area is 5.07 + 0.2393=5.3093 m².

So sigma is 2.4e-6 / 5.3093. Let me compute 2.4 /5.3093.

Wait, 5.3093 * 0.45 is 2.3892. So 2.4 is 2.4 - 2.3892=0.0108 left. So 0.0108 /5.3093 is approximately 0.002035. So total is 0.45 + 0.002035=0.452035. So 0.452035e-6 C/m², which is 4.52035e-7. So approximately 4.52e-7 C/m².

Looking at the options, option G is 4.5e-7. So that's the closest. So the answer should be G.

But wait, let me check: maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach. Oh wait, sometimes for conductors, the charge resides on the surface, and the formula is correct. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more precisely. Let me calculate 2.4e-6 / (4 * π * (0.65)^2).

Compute denominator: 4 * π * (0.65)^2.

0.65 squared is 0.4225. 4 * 0.4225 =1.69. So 1.69 * π = approximately 5.3086 m².

So 2.4e-6 /5.3086 = (2.4 /5.3086 )e-6.

2.4 divided by 5.3086. Let me compute that.

5.3086 * 0.452 = ?

0.45 *5.3086 = 2.38887.

0.002 *5.3086=0.0106172.

So 0.452 *5.3086 = 2.38887 +0.0106172=2.399487.

But 2.4 is a bit higher. The exact value would be (2.4 /5.3086)= approximately 0.452.

So 0.452e-6 C/m² is 4.52e-7.

So option G is 4.5e-7, which is very close. So the correct answer must be G.

To determine the surface charge density of the spherical satellite, we use the formula for surface charge density:

\[
\sigma = \frac{Q}{A}
\]

where \( Q \) is the total charge and \( A \) is the surface area of the sphere. The satellite is spherical with a diameter of \( 1.3 \, \mathrm{m} \), so its radius is:

\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{1.3}{2} = 0.65 \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

The surface area of a sphere is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi r^2.
\]

Substituting \( r = 0.65 \, \mathrm{m} \):

\[
A = 4 \pi (0.65)^2 = 4 \pi (0.4225) = 1.69 \pi \, \mathrm{m}^2.
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[
A \approx 1.69 \times 3.1416 \approx 5.309 \, \mathrm{m}^2.
\]

The total charge \( Q \) is given as \( 2.4 \, \mu\mathrm{C} = 2.4 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \). Now, calculate the surface charge density:

\[
\sigma = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{2.4 \times 10^{-6}}{5.309}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\sigma \approx 0.452 \times 10^{-6} = 4.52 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{C/m}^2.
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is:

**G: \( 4.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{C/m}^2 \).**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G**
