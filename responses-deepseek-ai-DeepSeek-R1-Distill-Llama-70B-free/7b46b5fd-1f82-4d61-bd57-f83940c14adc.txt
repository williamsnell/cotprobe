Okay, so I've got this problem about a concentration cell, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what I remember about concentration cells. A concentration cell is an electrochemical cell where the two half-cells have the same electrodes but different concentrations of the same electrolyte. The cell generates electricity because of the difference in concentration, causing ions to move.

The cell notation given is Ag|AgNO3 (0.0100m) || AgNO3 (y) |Ag. So, I think the left side is the anode and the right is the cathode, but wait, wait. Wait, in a concentration cell, the more dilute solution is usually the anode because oxidation happens there. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Let me think. Oh right, in a concentration cell, the lower concentration side will have oxidation (so anode) because the higher concentration is more likely to gain electrons (reduction, cathode).

So, the left half-cell has 0.0100m AgNO3, and the right has y m. The voltage measured is 0.0650 V at 25°C. We need to find y.

I remember the Nernst equation is used for concentration cells. The formula for the cell potential (E) is E = (E^0_cathode - E^0_anode) - (RT/nF) ln Q. But wait, since it's a concentration cell, the standard potentials are the same, so E^0_cathode - E^0_anode is zero. Thus, E = -(RT/nF) ln Q.

Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as E = (RT/nF) ln (cathode/anode), but I might be mixing up the signs. Let me think again.

The general Nernst equation is E = E^0 - (RT/nF) ln Q, where Q is the reaction quotient. But for a concentration cell, E^0 is zero because both electrodes are the same. So, E = (RT/nF) ln (Q'), where Q' is the ratio of the concentrations.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. In a concentration cell, the cell potential is given by E = ( (E right - E left) ), but since both E^0 are same, it's E = ( (E right) - (E left) ). So the Nernst equation for each half-cell would be E = E^0 + (0.05916 V/n) log (1/[Ag+]) for each. Since it's a concentration cell, the cell voltage is E = E_cathode - E_anode.

Wait, the anode is where oxidation happens, so that's the left side (lower concentration). So the anode is the left (since it's 0.01m, lower than y?), but wait, wait, wait. No, wait. We don't know y yet. So the cell voltage is E = E_cathode - E_anode.

The E for each half-cell is E = E^0 + (0.05916/n) log (1/[Ag+]) because the reaction is Ag+ + e- → Ag. So for the cathode (reduction), it's E_cathode = E^0 + (0.05916/1) log([Ag+]cathode). Similarly, E_anode = E^0 + (0.05916) log([Ag+]anode).

But since it's the same metal, E^0 cancels out when you subtract. So E_cell = E_cathode - E_anode = (0.05916) [ log([Ag+]cathode) - log([Ag+]anode) ) ].

Wait, but in the cell, the anode is where oxidation occurs, which is Ag → Ag+ + e-. So for the anode, the [Ag+] is lower (0.01m), and the cathode has higher [Ag+] (y m?), because higher concentration would drive the reduction.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the cell is written as Ag | AgNO3(0.0100m) || AgNO3(y) | Ag. So the left side is the anode (oxidation) and the right is the cathode (reduction). So the anode has lower concentration, cathode higher.

So [Ag+]anode = 0.01m, [Ag+]cathode = y m. So substituting into the E equation:

E_cell = (0.05916 V) [ log(y) - log(0.01) ) ].

Wait, but wait, the cell voltage is given as 0.0650 V. So,

0.0650 = 0.05916 [ log(y) - log(0.01) ]

Let me compute log(0.01) first. 0.01 is 10^-2, so log(0.01) = -2.

So,

0.0650 = 0.05916 [ log(y) - (-2) ].

Which simplifies to:

0.0650 = 0.05916 [ log(y) + 2 ]

Divide both sides by 0.05916:

0.0650 / 0.05916 ≈ 1.100 approx.

So,

1.100 ≈ log(y) + 2.

Subtract 2 from both sides:

log(y) ≈ 1.100 - 2 = -0.900.

So y = 10^(-0.900) ≈ 0.12589 m.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.1255m, which is close to 0.12589. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, E = (0.05916/n) * log (cathode/anode). Since n=1 for Ag+ → Ag.

So E = 0.05916 * log (y / 0.01) → because the cathode is y and the anode is 0.01.

So,

0.0650 = 0.05916 * log(y/0.01)

log(y/0.01) = 0.0650 / 0.05916 ≈ 1.100

So y/0.01 = 10^1.100 ≈ 12.589.

Wait, because 10^1.1 is about 12.589, yes.

So y = 12.589 * 0.01 = 0.12589 m ≈ 0.1259 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.1255m, which is the closest.

Wait, but why is option G 0.1205? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the cell reaction direction. Let me re-examine.

If the cell voltage is positive, then the reaction is spontaneous as written. So the right side is higher in concentration, causing reduction, and the left side is lower, causing oxidation.

Wait, but when I plug the numbers, I get y ≈0.1259, which rounds to 0.126, but the options don't have that. Option B is 0.1255, which is very close. So perhaps the approximation leads to that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10^1.1 more accurately.

Let me calculate 10^1.1. 10^0.1 is about 1.2589, so 10^1.1 is 10 * 1.2589 ≈12.589. So y/0.01 is 12.589, so y is 0.12589 m.

So y ≈0.1259, which would round to 0.126. But in the options, B is 0.1255, which is very close. Maybe I should check if I did the division correctly.

Wait, let me compute 0.0650 / 0.05916.

0.0650 ÷ 0.05916.

Let me compute that: 0.05916 is approximately 0.05916.

0.0650 /0.05916 ≈ 1.100 (as before).

So 10^(1.100) is about 12.589.

So y = 0.12589.

So the closest option is B:0.1255.

Wait, but why is there a 0.0005 difference? Maybe I should use more precise values.

Wait, the given voltage is 0.0650 V, which is three significant figures. So perhaps the calculation should be precise.

Let me compute log(y) + 2 = 0.0650/0.05916.

Compute 0.0650 / 0.05916:

0.0650 ÷ 0.05916 = approximately 1.100.

Wait, 0.05916 * 1.1 equals 0.065076, which is very close to 0.0650. So 1.100 is accurate.

So log(y) = 1.100 -2 = -0.900.

So y = 10^(-0.900) = 1e-0.9.

Compute 10^-0.9:

Let me compute 10^0.9 first. 10^0.9 is approximately 7.943. So 10^-0.9 = 1/7.943 ≈ 0.1259.

So y ≈0.1259 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.1255, which is 0.1255. That's very close.

Wait, but perhaps the confusion is about whether the cell is set up as left being higher or lower concentration. Did I get the anode and cathode right?

Wait, in the cell notation, the left is the anode (oxidation) and the right is the cathode (reduction). So the anode is where the silver is being oxidized to Ag+, increasing the concentration in the anode half-cell, but in the problem, the anode has 0.0100m, lower than the cathode's y m.

So the higher concentration is on the cathode side, which makes sense for reduction.

So the calculation is correct, leading to y ≈0.1259, so the closest option is B:0.1255m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the cell voltage. Wait, the cell voltage is positive, so E is positive, which aligns with the calculation.

Wait another thing: maybe I should have considered that the cell is reversed? No, because the given voltage is positive, which would mean that the right side is at higher potential, so higher concentration.

Wait, but in concentration cells, the higher concentration is the cathode. So the cell voltage is positive when the cathode has higher concentration.

So I think my approach was correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the concentration cell **Ag|AgNO₃ (0.0100m) || AgNO₃ (y) |Ag**. The measured voltage is **0.0650 V** at 25°C, and we are tasked with finding the molality \( y \) of the right-hand half-cell, assuming \(\gamma_\pm = 1\).

### Key Concepts:
1. A concentration cell generates voltage due to the difference in concentrations of the same electrolyte in the two half-cells.
2. The Nernst equation for a concentration cell is:
   \[
   E = \frac{0.05916}{n} \log \left(\frac{\text{cathode concentration}}{\text{anode concentration}}\right)
   \]
   Here, \( n = 1 \) because the reaction involves \( \text{Ag}^+ \to \text{Ag} \).

3. The left half-cell (\( 0.0100m \)) is the anode (oxidation occurs), and the right half-cell (\( y \)) is the cathode (reduction occurs).

### Calculation:
1. Substitute the given values into the Nernst equation:
   \[
   0.0650 = 0.05916 \cdot \log \left(\frac{y}{0.0100}\right)
   \]

2. Divide through by \( 0.05916 \):
   \[
   \log \left(\frac{y}{0.0100}\right) = \frac{0.0650}{0.05916} \approx 1.100
   \]

3. Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{y}{0.0100} = 10^{1.100}
   \]

4. Calculate \( 10^{1.100} \). Since \( 10^{1.1} \approx 12.589 \), we find:
   \[
   y = 12.589 \cdot 0.0100 = 0.12589 \, \text{m}
   \]

5. Compare with the options. The closest value to \( 0.12589 \, \text{m} \) is **0.1255m**.

### Conclusion:
The molality \( y \) of the right-hand half-cell is approximately **0.1255m**, corresponding to **option B**.
