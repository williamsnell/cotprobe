Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve: the limit as x approaches 0 of [ln(1+x) - x] divided by x squared. Hmm, I remember that when both numerator and denominator approach zero, l'Hôpital's rule can be used. But the question also says to show that l'Hôpital's rule is like using Taylor expansions. So maybe I should try both methods.

First, let me think about using Taylor series. I know that ln(1+x) can be expanded around x=0. The Taylor series for ln(1+x) is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... So if I subtract x from that, the first term cancels out. So ln(1+x) - x would be -x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... 

So the numerator is approximately -x²/2 plus higher order terms. The denominator is x squared. So when I take the ratio, [ln(1+x) - x]/x², it's approximately (-x²/2)/x² which is -1/2. But wait, there are higher order terms. As x approaches 0, the higher terms become negligible, so the limit should be -1/2. That would correspond to option H.

Alternatively, using l'Hôpital's rule: since plugging x=0 gives 0/0, which is indeterminate. So take derivatives of numerator and denominator. The derivative of the numerator, ln(1+x) - x, is (1/(1+x)) - 1. The derivative of the denominator x² is 2x. So the new limit is [1/(1+x) -1]/(2x). Simplify the numerator: 1/(1+x) -1 = [1 - (1+x)]/(1+x) = -x/(1+x). So the expression becomes (-x)/( (1+x) * 2x ). The x cancels out, leaving -1/(2(1+x)). Now, take the limit as x approaches 0: -1/(2*1) = -1/2. Same answer as before.

Wait, but the options don't have -1/2. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option H is -1/2. So that's the correct answer. Hmm, wait the options are labeled A-J. Let me see: the options are A to J. Looking back, the options given were:

A: 3/2

B:0

C:-3/2

D:2

E:1/4

F:1

G:-1

H:-1/2

I:1/2

J:-2

So yes, H is -1/2. So both methods give the same answer, which makes sense because l'Hôpital's rule is connected to Taylor expansions.

I think I'm confident with this. The answer should be H.

To evaluate the limit

$$
\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\ln (1+x)-x}{x^2},
$$

we can use two approaches: Taylor series expansion and l'Hôpital's rule.

### Taylor Series Expansion:
The Taylor series expansion of $\ln(1+x)$ around $x=0$ is:

$$
\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \dots
$$

Subtracting $x$ from $\ln(1+x)$ gives:

$$
\ln(1+x) - x = -\frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \dots
$$

The numerator is approximately $-\frac{x^2}{2}$ (ignoring higher-order terms), and the denominator is $x^2$. Thus, the expression becomes:

$$
\frac{\ln(1+x) - x}{x^2} \approx \frac{-\frac{x^2}{2}}{x^2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
$$

As $x \to 0$, the higher-order terms vanish, so the limit is $-\frac{1}{2}$.

### L'Hôpital's Rule:
Since the limit is of the form $\frac{0}{0}$, we apply l'Hôpital's rule by differentiating the numerator and the denominator:

- The derivative of the numerator $\ln(1+x) - x$ is $\frac{1}{1+x} - 1 = -\frac{x}{1+x}$.
- The derivative of the denominator $x^2$ is $2x$.

The new limit is:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{-\frac{x}{1+x}}{2x}.
$$

Canceling $x$ in the numerator and denominator gives:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{-1}{2(1+x)} = \frac{-1}{2}.
$$

### Conclusion:
Both methods yield the same result: $-\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: -1/2**.
