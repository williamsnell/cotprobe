Question:

Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length. The tension in the string is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced. Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?

Options:

A: The wavelength will be greater, because the tension in the string varies inversely with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
B: Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
C: The wavelength cannot be determined without more information about the properties of the string and the wave generator.
D: Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
E: Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
F: Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
G: The wavelength will be less, because the tension in the string varies inversely with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
H: The wavelength will be greater, because the increased tension in the string will cause an increase in the wave speed, resulting in a longer wavelength.
I: The wavelength will remain the same, because the tension in the string does not affect the wavelength.
J: The wavelength will be less, because the increased tension in the string will cause a decrease in the wave speed, resulting in a shorter wavelength.

Okay, so I have this physics problem about standing waves on a string, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length. Then the tension is increased, and a new set of standing waves is formed. The question is whether the wavelength of the new waves is greater or less than the original.

Hmm. Standing waves on a string usually involve nodes and antinodes. The length of the string is fixed, so the possible wavelengths are determined by the harmonic series. Like, the fundamental wavelength is twice the length, and then higher harmonics are integer fractions of that.

Wait, but what affects the wavelength here? I remember that the speed of a wave on a string depends on the tension and the linear mass density. The formula is v = sqrt(T/μ), where T is tension and μ is mass per unit length.

So if the tension increases, the wave speed should increase, right? Because T is in the numerator. So v increases.

But how does wave speed relate to wavelength and frequency? Oh, right, the basic wave equation is v = f * λ. Frequency times wavelength equals speed.

In this problem, the generator's frequency is fixed at 100 Hz. Because the generator is providing the same frequency, I think the frequency of the waves doesn't change. So if v increases, and f stays the same, then λ must increase. Because v = fλ → λ = v/f. So if v goes up and f stays same, λ goes up.

Wait, but wait a second. The standing waves depend on the length of the string and the wavelength. The string's length determines the possible modes. Like, for a string fixed at both ends, the nth harmonic has wavelength λ = 2L/n.

But wait, the wavelength of the standing waves is determined by the length and the mode. However, the wave speed is determined by tension. So the frequency of each harmonic is related to the wave speed.

Wait, the frequency for the nth mode is f_n = (v/(2L)) * n. So when tension increases, v increases, which would increase the frequency of each mode. But in this problem, the generator is providing a fixed frequency of 100 Hz. So when the tension increases, the frequency of the standing wave modes would change. But the generator is fixed at 100 Hz, so the system has to adjust which mode it's in.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Let's say initially, the string is under some tension T1, and the wave speed is v1 = sqrt(T1/μ). The generator drives the string at 100 Hz, so the frequency f is 100 Hz. The possible standing wave modes are when L = (n λ)/2, where n is an integer. So λ = 2L/n. But the wave speed is also v = f λ → λ = v/f.

So combining these, the possible wavelengths are λ = (2L)/n = v/f. So v must equal (2Lf)/n. That makes sense because v is sqrt(T/μ), which depends on T and μ.

Now, when the tension T increases to T2, the new wave speed is v2 = sqrt(T2/μ) > v1. So the new possible wavelengths for the standing waves would be λ2 = v2/f. Since v2 is larger, λ2 is larger than before.

Wait, but wait again. The generator is providing the same frequency. So when the tension increases, the wave speed increases, but the frequency is fixed. So the system will find the new mode n that satisfies v2 = (2L f)/n. So n would be (2L f)/v2. Since v2 is larger than v1, n would be smaller. So the mode number decreases, meaning that the wavelength increases.

So the wavelength would be longer after the tension is increased. Therefore, the new wavelength is greater than the original.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on whether the wavelength depends on the mode. Let me think differently. The frequency is fixed by the generator, so f is 100 Hz. The wave speed v is determined by the tension. So the wavelength λ is v/f. Since v increases when tension increases, λ must increase. So the new wavelength is longer.

So the answer should be that the wavelength is greater.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Wavelength greater because tension varies inversely with wave speed, which varies inversely with wavelength. Wait, tension varies directly with wave speed. Because v = sqrt(T/μ). So if tension increases, v increases. So A is wrong because it says tension varies inversely.

Option H: Wavelength greater because increased tension increases wave speed, leading to longer wavelength. That makes sense. Because v increases, and v = f λ, so λ increases.

Option E: Less, because tension varies directly with v, which varies inversely with λ. So that's incorrect reasoning because if v increases and f is fixed, λ would increase.

Wait, let me look at all options.

Option E says less, but based on our analysis, it's more. So E is incorrect.

Option H: greater because increased tension causes higher v, resulting in longer λ. That's correct.

So the answer is H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach is to think about the relationship between the wave speed and the frequency. Since f is fixed, and v increases, λ must increase.

So the correct answer should be H.
</think>

When standing waves are produced in a string of fixed length, the wavelength is determined by the relationship between the wave speed \(v\), the frequency \(f\), and the string's length \(L\). The wave speed is given by \(v = \sqrt{T/\mu}\), where \(T\) is the tension and \(\mu\) is the linear mass density. The frequency of the standing waves is fixed at 100 Hz by the generator, and the wavelength is related to the wave speed by \(v = f \lambda\), so \(\lambda = v/f\).

When the tension \(T\) is increased, the wave speed \(v\) increases because \(v\) is directly proportional to \(\sqrt{T}\). Since the frequency \(f\) remains constant, the wavelength \(\lambda\) must also increase, as \(\lambda = v/f\). Therefore, the new wavelength will be greater than the original wavelength.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Tension varies directly with wave speed, not inversely.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Tension varies directly with wave speed, but the wavelength increases, not decreases.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The wavelength can be determined because the relationships between tension, wave speed, and wavelength are well-defined.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While tension varies directly with wave speed, the wavelength increases, not decreases.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Although tension varies directly with wave speed, the wavelength increases, not decreases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Tension varies directly with wave speed, but wavelength increases, not because wave speed varies directly with wavelength.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Tension varies directly with wave speed, not inversely.
- **Option H**: Correct. Increased tension increases wave speed, and since \(v = f \lambda\), the wavelength increases.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Tension affects the wavelength because it changes the wave speed.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Increased tension increases wave speed, and the wavelength increases, not decreases.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: The wavelength will be greater, because the increased tension in the string will cause an increase in the wave speed, resulting in a longer wavelength.**
