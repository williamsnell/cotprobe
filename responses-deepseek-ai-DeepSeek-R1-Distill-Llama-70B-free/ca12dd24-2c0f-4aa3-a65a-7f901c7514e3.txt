Question:

Ms. Fogg is planning an around-the-world trip on which she plans to spend $10,000. The utility from the trip is a function of how much she actually spends on it (Y), given by U(Y) = ln Y. If there is a 25 percent probability that Ms. Fogg will lose $1,000 of her cash on the trip, what is the tripâ€™s expected utility?

Options:

A: 8.895
B: 9.350
C: 9.210
D: 9.000
E: 8.500
F: 10.000
G: 9.184
H: 8.987
I: 8.750

Okay, so I've got this problem about Ms. Fogg planning a trip and her utility function. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question says she plans to spend $10,000 on the trip. Her utility is given by U(Y) = ln Y, where Y is the amount she actually spends. So, the utility depends on how much she ends up spending.

Now, there's a 25% chance she'll lose $1,000. So, I think that means a probability of 0.25 that she loses that money. So, her spending would be different in that case.

Wait, wait. If she loses $1,000, does that mean she can't spend that money, so her actual spending Y would be $9,000? Or does losing the money mean she has less to spend overall? Hmm, I think it's the first case. If she planned to spend $10k but loses $1k, she only spends $9k. So Y would be $9k in that scenario.

So, two possible scenarios here: one where she doesn't lose any money and spends the full $10k, and another where she loses $1k, so she spends $9k.

The probabilities: 25% chance of losing (so 0.25), and 75% chance of not losing (0.75).

The expected utility is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the utilities in each case.

So, expected utility E[U] = 0.25 * ln(9000) + 0.75 * ln(10000).

I need to compute this. Let me calculate each term.

First, ln(10000) is ln(10^4) = 4 * ln(10). I remember ln(10) is approximately 2.302585. So 4 times that is 9.21034.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 10,000 is 10^4, so ln(10^4) is 4 * ln(10). Yeah, that's correct. So ln(10000) is 9.2103.

Then, ln(9000). Hmm, 9000 is 9 * 1000, and 1000 is 10^3, so ln(9000) is ln(9 * 10^3) = ln(9) + ln(10^3) = ln(9) + 3*ln(10).

I know ln(9) is ln(3^2) which is 2*ln(3). And ln(3) is approximately 1.0986, so 2*1.0986 is 2.1972.

Also, 3*ln(10) is 3*2.302585 = 6.907755.

So ln(9000) = 2.1972 + 6.907755 = 9.104955.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because 9*1000 is 9000, so yes. So ln(9000) is about 9.105.

Now, putting it all together.

E[U] = 0.25 * 9.105 + 0.75 * 9.2103.

Let me compute each term.

0.25 * 9.105 is 2.27625.

0.75 * 9.2103: 0.75 is 3/4, so 9.2103 * 0.75. Let's compute that.

9.2103 * 0.75 = (9 * 0.75) + (0.2103 * 0.75) = 6.75 + 0.157725 = 6.907725.

So adding the two terms: 2.27625 + 6.907725 = 9.183975.

Hmm, rounding that to three decimal places, it's approximately 9.184.

Looking at the options, option G is 9.184. So the expected utility should be G.

The problem involves calculating the expected utility of Ms. Fogg's trip, where her utility function is given by \( U(Y) = \ln Y \). She plans to spend $10,000, but there is a 25% chance she will lose $1,000, reducing her actual spending to $9,000. The expected utility is calculated as the weighted sum of utilities in the two scenarios, using their respective probabilities.

1. **Utility when no money is lost**:  
   If she spends the full $10,000, the utility is \( U(10000) = \ln(10000) \).  
   Since \( \ln(10000) = \ln(10^4) = 4 \cdot \ln(10) \), and \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \),  
   \( \ln(10000) = 4 \cdot 2.3026 = 9.2103 \).

2. **Utility when $1,000 is lost**:  
   If she loses $1,000, her spending is reduced to $9,000, and the utility is \( U(9000) = \ln(9000) \).  
   Using \( \ln(9000) = \ln(9 \cdot 10^3) = \ln(9) + \ln(10^3) \),  
   \( \ln(9) = 2 \cdot \ln(3) \approx 2 \cdot 1.0986 = 2.1972 \), and \( \ln(10^3) = 3 \cdot \ln(10) \approx 3 \cdot 2.3026 = 6.9078 \),  
   \( \ln(9000) = 2.1972 + 6.9078 = 9.1050 \).

3. **Expected Utility Calculation**:  
   The expected utility is given by:  
   \[
   E[U] = 0.25 \cdot \ln(9000) + 0.75 \cdot \ln(10000)
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   E[U] = 0.25 \cdot 9.1050 + 0.75 \cdot 9.2103
   \]  
   Compute each term:  
   \[
   0.25 \cdot 9.1050 = 2.27625, \quad 0.75 \cdot 9.2103 = 6.907725
   \]  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   E[U] = 2.27625 + 6.907725 = 9.183975 \approx 9.184
   \]

Thus, the expected utility of the trip is approximately **9.184**, which corresponds to option **G**.
