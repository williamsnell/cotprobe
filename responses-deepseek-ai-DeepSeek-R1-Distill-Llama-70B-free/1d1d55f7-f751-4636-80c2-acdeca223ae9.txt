Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay and half-lives. Hmm, I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. The question is asking how many half-lives it takes to reduce 10.0 kg of a substance down to just 1.0 microgram. 

Wait, let me think about the units. 10 kg is a big number compared to a microgram. Let me convert them to the same unit to make it easier. I know that 1 kilogram is 10^3 grams, so 10 kg is 10 * 10^3 = 10^4 grams. And a microgram is 10^-6 grams. So I've got 1e4 grams reducing to 1e-6 grams. 

So the initial quantity is 1e4 g, and the final is 1e-6 g. To find out how much it's been reduced, I can use the decay formula. The formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^t, where N is the final quantity, N0 is the initial, and t is the number of half-lives. 

So plugging in the numbers: 1e-6 = 1e4 * (1/2)^t. Hmm, I can rearrange this to solve for t. Let me divide both sides by 1e4. That gives (1e-6)/(1e4) = (1/2)^t. Simplifying the left side: 1e-10 = (1/2)^t. 

Wait, 1e-10 is a very small number. Taking logarithms would help here. Let me take the natural log of both sides. ln(1e-10) = ln( (1/2)^t ). That becomes ln(1e-10) = t * ln(1/2). 

Calculating the left side: ln(1e-10) is ln(10^-10) which is -10 * ln(10). Since ln(10) is approximately 2.3026, this is about -10 * 2.3026 = -23.026. 

The right side is t multiplied by ln(1/2). ln(1/2) is about -0.6931. So putting it together: -23.026 = t * (-0.6931). 

Dividing both sides by -0.6931 gives t = (-23.026)/(-0.6931) = approximately 33.23. So around 33.23 half-lives. 

Looking at the options, the closest one is G:34. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversions. 

Wait, 10 kg to micrograms: 10 kg is 10,000 grams, right? Because 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 10 kg is 10*1000=10^4 grams. And 1 microgram is 1e-6 grams. So the ratio is 1e4 to 1e-6, which is 1e10 difference. So 1e4 / 1e-6 = 1e10. So the fraction is 1e-10, which is correct. 

Wait, but in the decay formula, it's N = N0*(1/2)^t. So N/N0 = (1/2)^t = 1e-10. Taking log base 2, since (1/2)^t = 1e-10 → t = log2(1e-10). 

I can calculate log2(1e-10) using natural logs or base 10. Let me try base 10. Log10(1e-10) is -10. And log10(2) is about 0.3010. So t = (log10(1e-10)) / (log10(2)) ) → t = (-10) / 0.3010 ≈ -33.22. But since t can't be negative, it's 33.22. So yeah, around 33.22. 

So the closest option is G:34, but wait, another thought. Sometimes these problems might consider using exact values or approximations. Let me try without approximations. 

Wait, using exact logs: ln(1e-10) is ln(10^-10) = -10 ln(10). And ln(1/2) is -ln(2). So t = [ -10 ln(10) ] / [ -ln(2) ] = (10 ln(10)) / ln(2). 

Calculating ln(10) is about 2.302585, ln(2) is approx 0.693147. So 10 * 2.302585 = 23.02585. Divide by 0.693147: 23.02585 / 0.693147 ≈ 33.22. 

So that's about 33.22, which is approximately 33. So looking at the options, the closest is option C:38, D:13, F:27, G:34, etc. Hmm, G is 34, which is just a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup, but I don't think so. 

Wait, another way: Let's think in terms of powers of 2. Each half-life reduces the quantity by half. So how many times do we have to halve 10 kg to get to 1e-6 grams. 

10 kg = 10^4 grams. 1e-6 grams is 1e-10 times smaller. So the ratio is 1e-10.

So (1/2)^t = 1e-10 → t = log2(1e-10).

As before, using log2(1e-10) = ln(1e-10)/ln(2) ≈ ( -23.02585 ) / (0.693147 ) ≈ 33.22.

So approximately 33.2 half-lives.

Looking back to the options: Option G is 34, which is very close. So the correct answer should be G:34.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A:15, B:40, C:38, D:13, E:21, F:27, G:34, H:8, I:50, J:29.

So yes, G is 34. So the answer is G. Wait, but wait, another thought: perhaps the initial and final masses were mixed up? Let me check. No, the problem says 10kg reducing to 1 microgram, so that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in terms of moles, but I don't think so; the problem doesn't specify anything about moles or molar mass, so it's probably just mass.

So I think the correct answer is G:34.

To determine how many half-lives it takes to reduce 10.0 kg of a radioactive substance to 1.0 microgram, we start by converting the units to the same base. 

- **Initial mass**: \( 10.0 \, \text{kg} = 10^4 \, \text{g} \) (since \( 1 \, \text{kg} = 10^3 \, \text{g} \)).
- **Final mass**: \( 1.0 \, \mu\text{g} = 10^{-6} \, \text{g} \).

The ratio of the final mass to the initial mass is:

\[
\frac{N}{N_0} = \frac{10^{-6}}{10^4} = 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the radioactive decay formula:

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{N}{N_0} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{N}{N_0} = 10^{-10} \):

\[
10^{-10} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(10^{-10}) = \ln\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(10^{-10}) = t \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right).
\]

Using \( \ln(10^{-10}) = -10 \cdot \ln(10) \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\ln(2) \):

\[
-10 \cdot \ln(10) = t \cdot (-\ln(2)).
\]

Rearranging for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{-10 \cdot \ln(10)}{-\ln(2)} = \frac{10 \cdot \ln(10)}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Substituting approximate values \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \) and \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
t = \frac{10 \cdot 2.3026}{0.6931} \approx \frac{23.026}{0.6931} \approx 33.22.
\]

Thus, it takes approximately **33.22 half-lives** to reduce the substance to 1.0 microgram. Among the given options, the closest value is **34**.
