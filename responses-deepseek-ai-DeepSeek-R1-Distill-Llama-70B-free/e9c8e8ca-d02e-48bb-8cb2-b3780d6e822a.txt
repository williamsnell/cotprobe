Question:

A homeowner was injured when he slipped and fell in a puddle of water on his sunroom floor; the water had accumulated on the floor during a rainstorm because of leaks in the roof. The roof's manufacturer had supplied nondefective materials to the installer, who was a franchisee (and not an employee) of the manufacturer. The leaks resulted from the carelessness of the installer during the from the carelessness of the installer during the installation of the roof. The installer's truck, which had been parked in front of the homeowner's house during the roof installation, bore the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer was aware that the truck and the literature supplied by the installer both displayed the manufacturer's logo. Is there any basis for a claim by the homeowner against the manufacturer?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer was aware that the installer used their logo.
B: Yes, because the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer.
C: No, because the homeowner was responsible for choosing the installer.
D: Yes, because the installer's truck displayed the manufacturer's logo.
E: No, because the manufacturer only supplied nondefective materials.
F: No, because the leaks were due to the installer's negligence, not the manufacturer's.
G: No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee.
H: Yes, under the rule of vicarious liability.
I: No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.
J: Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically product liability. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The situation is a homeowner who got injured when he slipped on a puddle in his sunroom. The water was there because the roof leaked during a rainstorm. The roof's manufacturer supplied materials to the installer, who was a franchisee, not an employee. So the installer was careless during installation, causing leaks. 

Now, the installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo, and the manufacturer knew about that. The question is whether the homeowner can claim against the manufacturer.

I remember that in product liability, manufacturers can be liable for defects. But here, the materials were nondefective. So the issue isn't with the product itself but with the installation. 

Wait, the installer is a franchisee. Franchisees are typically independent contractors, right? So the manufacturer isn't responsible for their actions unless there's some kind of agency relationship. But option B says yes because the installer was a franchisee. I don't think that's enough because franchisees usually aren't considered agents of the franchisor in a way that creates vicarious liability. 

Then, the installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo, and the manufacturer was aware. So maybe the homeowner thought the installer was the manufacturer's employee. That could be apparent agency. Apparent agency is when a principal (here, the manufacturer) creates an appearance of authority in the agent (installer) such that a third party (homeowner) reasonably believes the agent is acting on behalf of the principal. 

If the manufacturer allowed their logo to be used, perhaps they held out the installer as their agent. So the homeowner might have reasonably believed that the installer was acting under the manufacturer's authority. If that's the case, the manufacturer could be vicariously liable for the installer's negligence under apparent agency.

Looking at the options: 

Option J says yes under apparent agency. Option D says yes because the truck had the logo. But D alone might not be enough; it's more about whether that creates an agency relationship. So J seems more accurate.

Other options: Option E says no because materials were nondefective. That's true, but the issue is the installation, not the product. Option I says manufacturers are only liable for defects when the product leaves them. That would apply if the materials were defective, but here it's the installation causing the problem.

Option H is vicarious liability. But for that, the installer would need to be an employee, which they are notâ€”they're a franchisee, an independent contractor. So H might not apply.

So the main point is whether the manufacturer is liable through apparent agency because the installer appeared to be their agent due to the logo. If the homeowner reasonably believed the installer was the manufacturer's agent, then the manufacturer could be liable for the installer's negligence.

So the correct answer should be J.

The question revolves around whether the homeowner can hold the manufacturer liable for injuries caused by a leaking roof. The roof leaked due to the installer's negligence during installation, and the installer was a franchisee, not an employee, of the manufacturer. The installer's truck displayed the manufacturer's logo, and the manufacturer was aware of this. The key issue is whether the manufacturer can be held liable, despite supplying nondefective materials.

Under product liability law, manufacturers are generally not liable for defects arising from installation unless they have some responsibility for the installation. Here, the materials were nondefective, so liability would depend on the relationship between the manufacturer and the installer. Franchisees are typically independent contractors, and vicarious liability does not apply unless an agency relationship exists.

The installer's use of the manufacturer's logo on their truck, with the manufacturer's knowledge, could create an apparent agency relationship. Apparent agency occurs when a principal (the manufacturer) allows an agent (the installer) to appear as acting on its behalf, causing a third party (the homeowner) to reasonably believe the agent is authorized to act for the principal. If the homeowner reasonably believed the installer was acting under the manufacturer's authority, the manufacturer could be held liable for the installer's negligence.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option J** correctly identifies that the manufacturer could be liable under the doctrine of apparent agency due to the use of its logo.
- Other options, such as **B (franchisee relationship)**, **D (logo display)**, and **H (vicarious liability)**, are incorrect because they do not establish the necessary apparent agency relationship.
- **E, I, and F** focus on product defects or direct negligence, which are irrelevant here since the materials were nondefective, and the issue is the installer's negligence.

Thus, the correct answer is based on apparent agency.

Answer: J
