Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about rounding numbers to the nearest hundred and finding which two numbers both round to 1,500. Hmm, I remember that when rounding to the nearest hundred, you look at the tens digit to decide whether to round up or down. 

Wait, right. If the tens digit is 5 or higher, you round up the hundreds place by one. If it's less than 5, you leave the hundreds place as it is. So, for a number to round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred, it must be within the range that rounds up to 1,500.

What's the range around 1,500? Let me think. The nearest hundred below 1,500 is 1,400, and the one above is 1,600. So, the midpoint between 1,400 and 1,600 is 1,450. Because anything from 1,450 up to 1,549 would round up to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred. Wait, no, wait. When rounding to the nearest hundred, the cutoff is at the 50 mark of the tens place. So, numbers from 1,450 to 1,549 would round to 1,500. Because once you hit 1,550, that would round up to 1,600.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me clarify. When rounding to the nearest hundred, each hundred has a range of 50 below and 50 above. So, for 1,500, the range is from 1,450 (1,500 - 50) up to 1,549 (because 1,550 would round up to 1,600). So any number between 1,450 and 1,549 (inclusive?) would round to 1,500.

Wait, but is 1,550 inclusive? No, because 1,550 is exactly halfway between 1,500 and 1,600. Wait, no, that's when rounding to the nearest thousand maybe. For hundreds, 1,550 is 50 away from 1,500 and 50 away from 1,600. So, the standard rule is to round up when the digit is 5 or more. So 1,550 would round up to 1,600. So the maximum number that rounds to 1,500 would be 1,549. And the minimum would be 1,451? Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Wait, when you're rounding to the nearest hundred, you look at the tens and units digits. For example, take 1,444. The hundreds digit is 4, the tens is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, you round down, so 1,400. But 1,450 would round up to 1,500 because the tens digit is 5. Wait, no, wait. The tens digit is 5, so yes, you round up. So 1,450 would round to 1,500. So the range is from 1,450 up to 1,549. Because 1,550 would round up to 1,600.

So any number that is 1,450 or higher but less than 1,550 would round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred. So the two numbers in the options must both fall into this range.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 1,444 and 1,555. Let's check.

1,444: The hundreds digit is 4, tens is 4. So 4 is less than 5, so it rounds down to 1,400. So this doesn't round to 1,500. So option A is out.

Option B: 1,453 and 1,563.

1,453: Tens digit is 5, so rounds up to 1,500. 1,563: The hundreds digit is 5, so tens digit is 6. Wait, wait. Wait, 1,563 is 1 thousand 5 hundreds 6 tens 3 units. Wait, when rounding to the nearest hundred, you look at the tens digit. The hundreds digit is 5, but wait no—wait, the number is 1,563. So in the hundreds place, it's the 5 (as in 1,500). The tens digit is 6, which is 60. So 60 is more than 50, so 1,563 would round up to 1,600. So that's not rounding to 1,500. So option B is out.

Option C: 1,449 and 1,549.

1,449: Tens digit is 4, so rounds down to 1,400. So this doesn't round to 1,500. Option C is out.

Option D: 1,499 and 1,599.

1,499: Tens digit is 9, wait no. Wait, 1,499: the hundreds digit is 4, the tens is 9. Wait, wait: 1,499 is 1 thousand 4 hundreds and 99. So, the hundreds place is 4, the tens is 9. So when rounding to the nearest hundred, you look at the tens digit. 9 is more than 5, so you round up the hundreds place. So 4 becomes 5, making it 1,500. 

Now, 1,599: The hundreds digit is 5, the tens is 9. So 9 is more than 5, so you round up the hundreds place from 5 to 6, making it 1,600. So 1,599 would round to 1,600, not 1,500. So option D is out because one rounds to 1,500 and the other to 1,600.

Option E: 1,489 and 1,589.

1,489: hundreds digit 4, tens 8. 8>5, so rounds up to 1,500.

1,589: hundreds digit 5, tens 8. 8>5, so rounds up to 1,600. So only one rounds to 1,500. Option E is out.

Option F: 1,457 and 1,547.

1,457: hundreds 4, tens 5. So 5 rounds up, so 1,500.

1,547: hundreds 5, tens 4. 4<5, so rounds down to 1,500? Wait, no. Wait, 1,547: hundreds digit is 5. Tens digit is 4, which is less than 5. So you round down, so 1,500. So both numbers would round to 1,500. So F is a possible correct answer, but let me check the rest.

Option G: 1,445 and 1,555.

1,445: hundreds 4, tens 4. So 4<5, so rounds down to 1,400. So no. So G is out.

Option H: 1,399 and 1,599.

1,399: hundreds 3, tens 9. 9>5 so rounds up to 1,400. So that's not 1,500. So H is out.

Wait, so going back, F: 1,457 and 1,547. Let me confirm.

1,457: 4 in hundreds, 5 in tens. So 5 >=5, so rounds up to 1,500.

1,547: 5 in hundreds, 4 in tens. 4 <5, so rounds down to 1,500. So yes, both round to 1,500.

Wait, but wait—what about 1,550? As I thought earlier, 1,550 would round to 1,600. So any number from 1,450 to 1,549.999... would round to 1,500.

So 1,457 is within that range, and 1,547 is also within that range. So yes, both would round to 1,500.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So 1,457: 4 hundreds, 5 tens. Rounds up, so 1,500.

1,547: 5 hundreds, 4 tens. Rounds down to 1,500. So yes.

So the correct option is F.

Wait, but let me check the other options again in case I missed something.

Option D was 1,499 and 1,599. 1,499 rounds to 1,500, 1,599 rounds to 1,600. So no.

Option E: 1,489 rounds up, 1,589 rounds up to 1,600.

So the only correct option is F.

To determine which two numbers round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred, we need to understand the range of numbers that round to 1,500. When rounding to the nearest hundred, the tens digit is the deciding factor: if it is 5 or higher, the hundreds place rounds up; if it is less than 5, it rounds down. Therefore, the range of numbers that round to 1,500 is from 1,450 to 1,549 (inclusive).

Now, we evaluate each option:

- **Option A: 1,444 and 1,555**  
  - 1,444: Tens digit is 4 (less than 5), so it rounds to 1,400.  
  - 1,555: Tens digit is 5, but since the hundreds digit is 5, it rounds to 1,600.  
  - **Not valid.**

- **Option B: 1,453 and 1,563**  
  - 1,453: Tens digit is 5, so it rounds to 1,500.  
  - 1,563: Tens digit is 6, so it rounds to 1,600.  
  - **Not valid.**

- **Option C: 1,449 and 1,549**  
  - 1,449: Tens digit is 4 (less than 5), so it rounds to 1,400.  
  - 1,549: Tens digit is 4 (less than 5), so it rounds to 1,500.  
  - **Not valid.**

- **Option D: 1,499 and 1,599**  
  - 1,499: Tens digit is 9 (greater than 5), so it rounds to 1,500.  
  - 1,599: Tens digit is 9 (greater than 5), so it rounds to 1,600.  
  - **Not valid.**

- **Option E: 1,489 and 1,589**  
  - 1,489: Tens digit is 8 (greater than 5), so it rounds to 1,500.  
  - 1,589: Tens digit is 8 (greater than 5), so it rounds to 1,600.  
  - **Not valid.**

- **Option F: 1,457 and 1,547**  
  - 1,457: Tens digit is 5, so it rounds to 1,500.  
  - 1,547: Tens digit is 4 (less than 5), so it rounds to 1,500.  
  - **Valid.**

- **Option G: 1,445 and 1,555**  
  - 1,445: Tens digit is 4 (less than 5), so it rounds to 1,400.  
  - 1,555: Tens digit is 5, but since the hundreds digit is 5, it rounds to 1,600.  
  - **Not valid.**

- **Option H: 1,399 and 1,599**  
  - 1,399: Tens digit is 9 (greater than 5), so it rounds to 1,400.  
  - 1,599: Tens digit is 9 (greater than 5), so it rounds to 1,600.  
  - **Not valid.**

The only valid option is **F: 1,457 and 1,547**, as both numbers fall within the range of 1,450 to 1,549 and round to 1,500.

**Answer: F**
