Question:

Philosophy is concerned primarily with identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating arguments that support those beliefs.  These activities can be summarized in two questions that drive philosophical investigations:

Options:

A: who really believes X? and how can we explain differences in people's beliefs?
B: what is the origin of thought? and how does it impact our actions?
C: what do you mean? and how do you know?
D: how do beliefs shape society? and why do beliefs differ?
E: how do philosophers argue? and are their differences important?
F: why is there something rather than nothing? and how can we be sure?
G: how can we prove it? and what if we're wrong?
H: why should we bother? and what are the consequences of our believing one thing over another?

Okay, so I've got this question about philosophy, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that philosophy is mainly about identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating the arguments that support those beliefs. Then, it mentions that these activities can be summarized into two questions that drive philosophical investigations. The options are from A to J, but I can see the options given are A to H.

Hmm, I remember that philosophy often deals with questions about meaning and knowledge. So, the two main questions might be related to understanding concepts and knowing things. Let me think about the basic philosophical questions.

Wait, I think the two fundamental questions in philosophy are "What is the meaning of something?" and "How do we know it?" Or maybe more specifically, "What do you mean?" and "How do you know?" That sounds familiar. These are like the basic questions philosophers ask when examining beliefs and arguments.

Looking at the options, option C says: "what do you mean? and how do you know?" That fits what I was thinking. Let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A is about who believes and explaining differences. That seems more like sociology or psychology. Option B is about the origin of thought and its impact on actions, which sounds more like cognitive science or ethics. Option D is about how beliefs shape society and why they differ, again more social studies. Option E is about how philosophers argue and if differences matter, which is part of philosophical method but not the primary driving questions. Option F is more metaphysical, like why something exists rather than nothing, which is a big question but maybe not the two main ones here. Option G is about proof and being wrong, which is part of epistemology but again not the two main driving questions. Option H is about consequences of beliefs, which is more applied ethics or maybe pragmatism.

So, putting it all together, the two questions that philosophy uses to drive investigations are about clarifying meaning and understanding how we know something. That points to option C.

The question asks about the two primary questions that drive philosophical investigations, focusing on identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating supporting arguments. Philosophy often centers on clarifying meaning and understanding knowledge. The key questions are "what do you mean?" and "how do you know?" which align with option C. Other options relate to different fields or aspects of philosophy but don't capture the fundamental driving questions.

Answer: C
