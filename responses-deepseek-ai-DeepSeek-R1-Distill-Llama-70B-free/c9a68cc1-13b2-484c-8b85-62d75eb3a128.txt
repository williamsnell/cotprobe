Okay, so I've got this finance problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully. 

The company invested in a new machine that will generate revenues of $35,000 annually for seven years. They have annual operating expenses of $7,000, and depreciation expense is $4,000 per year. The expected payback period is 5.2 years. The question is asking how much the company paid for the machine.

Hmm, I remember that payback period is the time it takes for the cash inflows from the investment to repay the initial outlay. So the formula for payback period is the initial investment divided by the annual net cash inflow. 

Wait, but wait—net cash inflow would be the revenues minus expenses, including depreciation. But wait, is depreciation a cash flow? Oh right, depreciation is a non-cash expense, so when calculating cash flows, I should add it back. Because when you calculate net income, you subtract depreciation, but for cash flow, you don't because it's not a cash expense.

So the annual operating expenses are $7,000, which includes $4,000 depreciation. So the cash expenses would be $7,000 minus $4,000, which is $3,000 per year. So the net cash inflow would be the revenues minus the cash expenses. So that's $35,000 minus $3,000, which equals $32,000 per year.

So the annual net cash inflow is $32,000. The payback period is 5.2 years. So the initial investment is the annual cash inflow multiplied by the payback period. 

Wait, no. Wait, the payback period is calculated as Initial Investment divided by Annual Cash Inflow. So if I rearrange that, Initial Investment = Payback Period * Annual Cash Inflow.

So that would be 5.2 years * $32,000 per year. Let me calculate that. 5 * 32,000 is 160,000. 0.2 * 32,000 is 6,400. So 160,000 + 6,400 = 166,400. So that would make the initial investment $166,400.

Looking at the options, option C is $166,400. So I think that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

So the revenues are $35k annually. Operating expenses are $7k, which includes depreciation of $4k. So in terms of cash flow, the operating expenses after adding back depreciation would be $3k. So yes, net cash inflow is 35k -3k =32k. Then, payback period is 5.2. So 32k multiplied by 5.2 is indeed 166,400. 

Wait, but wait—another way to think about it: each year, the cash flow is 32k. So over five years, that's 5 *32k=160k. Then, 0.2 of a year would add 6.4k, bringing the total to 166.4k. Yep, that's correct.

So I think option C is the right answer.

To determine the amount the company paid for the new machine, we calculate the initial investment using the payback period formula:

\[
\text{Initial Investment} = \text{Payback Period} \times \text{Annual Net Cash Inflow}
\]

1. **Annual Revenues**: $35,000  
2. **Annual Operating Expenses**: $7,000 (includes $4,000 depreciation).  
   - Since depreciation is a non-cash expense, it is added back to calculate cash flow.  
   - Cash expenses = $7,000 - $4,000 = $3,000.  
3. **Annual Net Cash Inflow**: $35,000 - $3,000 = $32,000.  

Given a payback period of 5.2 years, the initial investment is:

\[
\text{Initial Investment} = 5.2 \times 32,000 = 166,400
\]

Thus, the company paid **$166,400** for the new machine. The correct answer is:

**C: $166,400**
