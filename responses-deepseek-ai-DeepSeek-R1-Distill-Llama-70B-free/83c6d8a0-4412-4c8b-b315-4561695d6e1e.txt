Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mr. Scaccioborrows $100 from his credit union. He agrees to pay back $20 a month, and there's an interest of 1% per month on the unpaid balance. I need to figure out how much he pays in total. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I should understand how the payments work. He borrows $100 and has to pay $20 each month. But wait, the interest is 1% on the unpaid balance each month. So each month, before he makes a payment, interest is added to the remaining balance he owes. Then he pays $20, part of which goes to interest and the rest to the principal.

Wait, but how does this exactly work? Let me think. Let's say he starts with $100. The first month, before he pays, the interest is 1% of $100, which is $1. So the total owed becomes $101. Now he pays $20. So out of that $20, $1 goes to interest, and the remaining $19 goes to reduce the principal. So the new balance after the first payment would be $100 - $19 = $81.

Now, moving on to the second month. The balance is $81. The interest is 1% of $81, which is $0.81. So the total owed before payment is $81.81. He pays another $20. Of this, $0.81 is interest, and the remaining $19.19 goes to principal. So the new balance is $81 - $19.19 = $61.81.

Third month: balance is $61.81. Interest is 1% of that, which is $0.6181, approximately $0.62. So total owed is $62.43 (after rounding). He pays $20 again. Now, the interest part is $0.62, so the principal reduction is $19.38. Subtracting that from $61.81 gives $42.43.

Fourth month: balance is $42.43. Interest is 1%, so that's $0.4243, approximately $0.42. Total owed is $42.85. He pays $20, with $0.42 going to interest, leaving $19.58 for principal. New balance is $42.43 - $19.58 = $22.85.

Fifth month: balance is $22.85. Interest is 1% of that, which is $0.2285, about $0.23. Total owed is $23.08. He pays $20. Now, the interest is $0.23, so principal reduction is $19.77. Subtracting that from $22.85 gives $3.08 left.

Wait, but he can't pay a fraction of a cent, so perhaps we should consider rounding each time. But let me just proceed.

Now, sixth month: balance is $3.08. Interest is 1% of that, which is $0.0308, so about $0.03. Total owed is $3.11. He needs to pay this off. So his payment this month would be the remaining balance, which is $3.11. But wait, he's supposed to pay $20 each month. So in the sixth month, does he pay the full $20 or just the remaining $3.11 plus interest?

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps each payment is $20, regardless. So, in the first five months, he's made five payments of $20 each, totaling $100. But wait, let me check how much he has paid in total.

Wait, let me recount each payment and the principal reduction.

Month 1:
- Starting balance: $100
- Interest: $1 → Total: $101
- Payment: $20 → Principal paid: $19
- Ending balance: $81

Month 2:
- Interest: $0.81 → Total: $81.81
- Payment: $20 → Principal: $19.19
- Ending balance: $62.62 (Wait, 81 - 19.19 is 61.81, right? Because 81 -19.19 is 61.81. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.)

Wait, okay, let's correct that.

Month 1:
- Start: $100
- Interest: $1 → $101
- Payment $20 → $101 - $20 = $81 (so principal is $81)
Wait, wait, no. Because the payment is applied first to interest, then the rest to principal. So the principal reduction is payment minus interest.

So in month 1: 
Interest: $1
Payment: $20
Principal reduction: $20 - $1 = $19
New balance: $100 - $19 = $81

Month 2:
Interest: 1% of $81 = $0.81
Payment: $20
Principal reduction: $20 - $0.81 = $19.19
New balance: $81 - $19.19 = $61.81

Month 3:
Interest: 1% of $61.81 = $0.6181 → ~$0.62
Payment: $20
Principal reduction: $20 - $0.62 = $19.38
New balance: $61.81 - $19.38 = $42.43

Month 4:
Interest: 1% of $42.43 = $0.4243 → ~$0.42
Payment: $20
Principal reduction: $20 - $0.42 = $19.58
New balance: $42.43 - $19.58 = $22.85

Month 5:
Interest: 1% of $22.85 = $0.2285 → ~$0.23
Payment: $20
Principal reduction: $20 - $0.23 = $19.77
New balance: $22.85 - $19.77 = $3.08

Now, month 6:
Interest: 1% of $3.08 → $0.0308 → ~$0.03
Payment: $20
Principal reduction: $20 - $0.03 = $19.97
New balance: $3.08 - $19.97 → Wait, that can't be right. Because $3.08 minus $19.97 would be negative. So perhaps in this last payment, he only pays the remaining balance plus interest, not the full $20.

Wait, but the problem states he agrees to pay back $20 a month. So maybe he continues to pay $20 each month until the balance is paid off. So, in month 6, the balance is $3.08. The interest is $0.03, making the total owed $3.11. But he pays $20, which is more than the total owed. So the payment would cover the $3.11, and the remaining $16.89 would be... Wait, no, because he only owes $3.11. So he would only need to pay $3.11, but the agreement is to pay $20 each month. So perhaps in the sixth month, he pays the remaining $3.11, and the rest is not required. Alternatively, maybe he still pays $20, but the excess is applied to close the loan.

Wait, but the question is, how much does he pay in total? So let's see. The first five payments are each $20, so that's 5 * $20 = $100. Then in the sixth month, he needs to pay the remaining balance, which is $3.11. So total payments would be $100 + $3.11 = $103.11, but looking at the options, $103.11 isn't present. Wait, the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the interest is calculated on the remaining balance each time, and each payment is $20. Let's see how many payments he makes.

Alternative approach: Each month, the payment is $20, and the interest is 1% on the outstanding balance. So the principal paid each month is payment minus interest.

Let me make a table:

Month | Balance | Interest | Payment | Principal paid | New Balance
-----|---------|---------|---------|---------------|------------
1 | 100.00 | 1.00 | 20.00 | 19.00 | 81.00
2 | 81.00 | 0.81 | 20.00 | 19.19 | 61.81
3 | 61.81 | 0.62 | 20.00 | 19.38 | 42.43
4 | 42.43 | 0.42 | 20.00 | 19.58 | 22.85
5 | 22.85 | 0.23 | 20.00 | 19.77 | 3.08
6 | 3.08 | 0.03 | 20.00 | 19.97 | -16.89

Wait, in month 6, the new balance is negative, which doesn't make sense. That suggests that after paying $20 in month 6, he's actually overpaying. So perhaps the correct approach is that in the sixth month, he only needs to pay the remaining balance plus interest, not the full $20.

Alternatively, maybe the loan is paid off in five payments. Let me check the total after five payments.

After month 1: 100 → 81

After month 2: 81 → 61.81

After month 3: 61.81 → 42.43

After month 4: 42.43 →22.85

After month 5:22.85 →3.08

So after five payments of $20 each, totaling $100, the balance is $3.08.

So he would need a sixth payment. But the sixth payment would only be the $3.08 plus the interest for that month. So interest is 1% of $3.08, which is $0.0308. So total owed in sixth month is $3.08 + $0.03 = $3.11. He can pay this, so sixth payment is $3.11.

Total payments: 5 * $20 = $100, plus $3.11 = $103.11. But looking at the options, the closest is J: $103.00. So perhaps the answer is J.

Wait, but maybe the interest is calculated monthly, and each payment is $20, so perhaps the total is $100 + $3.11 = $103.11, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I should consider that each payment is $20, and the interest is 1% on the unpaid balance each month. So the total amount paid is the sum of all payments until the balance is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the total payment is $20 each month until it's paid off. So let's see, after five payments, the balance is $3.08, so the sixth payment is $3.11, making the total $20*5 + $3.11 = $103.11, which would round to $103.11. But the options are in whole dollars, so perhaps it's $103.00.

Looking back at the options, option J is $103.00. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but wait another thought: maybe the interest is simple interest. So the total interest would be 1% per month on the initial principal, but that doesn't make sense because it's on the unpaid balance, so it's reducing balance each time.

Alternatively, perhaps the total amount paid is calculated using the concept similar to simple interest, but that might not be accurate here.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total payments would be $20 per month until the principal is paid off. Each payment's portion going to principal increases as the balance decreases.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the total amount paid as $20 per month, but the interest is 1% per month on the original amount. But that would be simple interest, leading to total interest of 6 months * 1% * 100 = $6. So total payment would be $106, which is option E. But that doesn't align with my earlier calculation.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the interest should be on the reducing balance, not the original.

Wait, perhaps the problem is being treated as simple interest, but that's probably not the case. Because the question says "interest of 1% per month on the unpaid balance", which implies it's on the remaining balance each month, so it's compound interest.

So my initial approach of calculating each month's payment and interest seems correct.

So, after five payments, the balance is $3.08, and a sixth payment of $3.11 is needed, making total payments $103.11. Since the options are in whole dollars, the closest is $103.00, which is option J.

But let me check, perhaps the monthly interest is calculated and added each time, but the payments are applied as $20, so maybe the total is $100 plus interest.

Wait, another approach: the total amount paid is the sum of all the monthly payments. Since he's paying $20 each month until the principal is paid, perhaps it takes 6 payments. So 6 * $20 = $120.00, which is option A. But that would be the case if each payment only covers the interest, and the principal remains the same, which isn't the case because each payment includes part principal.

No, that can't be right because each payment includes part principal, so the balance decreases each month.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total interest paid. Let me see:

Each month's interest:

Month 1: $1.00
Month 2: $0.81
Month 3: $0.62
Month 4: $0.42
Month 5: $0.23
Month 6: $0.03

Adding these up: 1 + 0.81 = 1.81; +0.62 → 2.43; +0.42 → 2.85; +0.23 → 3.08; +0.03 → 3.11.

So total interest is $3.11. So the total amount paid is $100 (principal) + $3.11 (interest) = $103.11. So the total paid is $103.11, which would be approximately $103.00 as the closest option. So the answer is J.

To determine how much Mr. Scaccioborrows pays in total, we analyze the loan repayment process. He borrows $100 and agrees to pay $20 per month, with an interest rate of 1% per month on the unpaid balance. The interest is applied to the remaining balance each month, and each payment consists of both interest and principal reduction.

### Monthly Breakdown:
1. **Month 1**:
   - Starting balance: $100
   - Interest: $1 (1% of $100)
   - Total owed: $101
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal reduction: $20 - $1 = $19
   - New balance: $100 - $19 = $81

2. **Month 2**:
   - Starting balance: $81
   - Interest: $0.81 (1% of $81)
   - Total owed: $81.81
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal reduction: $20 - $0.81 = $19.19
   - New balance: $81 - $19.19 = $61.81

3. **Month 3**:
   - Starting balance: $61.81
   - Interest: $0.62 (1% of $61.81)
   - Total owed: $62.43
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal reduction: $20 - $0.62 = $19.38
   - New balance: $61.81 - $19.38 = $42.43

4. **Month 4**:
   - Starting balance: $42.43
   - Interest: $0.42 (1% of $42.43)
   - Total owed: $42.85
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal reduction: $20 - $0.42 = $19.58
   - New balance: $42.43 - $19.58 = $22.85

5. **Month 5**:
   - Starting balance: $22.85
   - Interest: $0.23 (1% of $22.85)
   - Total owed: $23.08
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal reduction: $20 - $0.23 = $19.77
   - New balance: $22.85 - $19.77 = $3.08

6. **Month 6**:
   - Starting balance: $3.08
   - Interest: $0.03 (1% of $3.08)
   - Total owed: $3.11
   - Payment: $3.11 (only the remaining balance is paid)
   - Principal reduction: $3.11
   - New balance: $3.08 - $3.11 = $0

### Total Payments:
- First 5 months: $20 per month = $100
- Month 6: $3.11
- Total paid: $100 + $3.11 = $103.11

Since the options are in whole dollars, the closest match is **$103.00**.
