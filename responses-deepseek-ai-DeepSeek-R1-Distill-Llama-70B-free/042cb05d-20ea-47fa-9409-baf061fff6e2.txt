Question:

In 1985, a widow, the undisputed owner of a cottage, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when

Options:

A: the Boy Scouts of America discovered the gift in the will.
B: the tenant's lease with the widow expired.
C: the tenant first moved into the cottage.
D: the widow left no heirs.
E: the widow died.
F: the tenant initially signed the lease.
G: the widow first leased the cottage.
H: the Boy Scouts of America took legal action.
I: the tenant discontinued paying rent.
J: the tenant subjectively believed that he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about adverse possession, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the problem again and break it down step by step.

The situation is about a widow who owned a cottage. She leased it to a tenant for seven years starting in 1985. The rent was monthly, due on the first of each month. Then, in 1986, the widow died without any heirs. Her will left everything to the Boy Scouts, but the cottage wasn't specifically mentioned. So, I guess under the will, the Boy Scouts would get it because it's part of the estate.

After the widow died, the tenant stayed but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts didn't know about the gift until 2009 when their attorneys found out. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. The question is when the tenant's period for adverse possession started.

Hmm. I remember that adverse possession requires certain elements: the trespasser must possess the property openly, actually, continuously, exclusively, and hostilely (or under claim of right), for the statutory period. But the exact starting point can be tricky.

Wait, the tenant had a lease, so initially, they were there with permission. But after the lease ends, if they stay without permission, that's when adverse possession might start. But in this case, the lease was for seven years, starting in 1985, so it would end in 1992. But the widow died in 1986, a year after the lease started.

So the tenant's lease was from 1985 to 1992. After the widow died, the ownership passed to the Boy Scouts through the will. The tenant continued to live there but stopped paying rent. So, the question is whether the tenant's possession became adverse after the lease ended or when the widow died.

Wait, when the widow died, did the lease continue? I think that when a landlord dies, the lease doesn't automatically end; it transfers to the new owner. So the Boy Scouts would have become the landlords, and the tenant's lease would still be in effect until 1992. But the tenant stopped paying rent a month after the widow died, in 1986. So that's during the lease term.

But if the tenant stops paying rent, that's a breach, but the lease is still valid. So the tenant's possession was still under the lease until 1992. After that, if the tenant stays without a lease, that's when they might start adverse possession.

Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. So if the lease ended in 1992, and the tenant stayed without permission, their adverse possession would start then. But the problem is that the Boy Scouts didn't know about the cottage until 2009. So, from 1992 to 2009 is 17 years, which is less than 20, so maybe they wouldn't have completed adverse possession yet. But the question is about when the period began.

Alternatively, maybe the adverse possession started when the tenant's lease ended. Because before that, they had permission. So the period would begin in 1992.

Wait, but in the question, the tenant learned of the widow's death and decided to remain but stopped paying rent. So that was in 1986, during the lease term. The lease was until 1992. So from 1986 to 1992, the tenant was still under the lease but not paying rent. So when the lease ends, if the tenant continues to stay without permission, that's when the adverse possession would begin.

So the period would start when the lease ended, which is 1992. So the statutory period would run from 1992 onwards. So in 2012, 20 years later, the tenant could claim adverse possession.

But looking at the options, the question is when the period began. The options are about specific events.

Looking at the options:

Option B: the tenant's lease with the widow expired. That makes sense because until the lease is up, they have permission, even if they're not paying rent. So the lease ends in 1992, so the period starts then.

Option I: when the tenant stopped paying rent. But that was during the lease term. So stopping rent doesn't necessarily mean adverse possession starts because they still have a lease.

Option J: when the tenant believed they had no permission. Subjective belief might not matter; it's more about the objective facts. If they have a lease, their possession is permissive until the lease ends.

So the correct answer should be B: when the lease expired.

Wait, but wait, the widow died in 1986. The lease was for seven years from 1985, so it would end in 1992. So until then, the tenant was still a tenant under the lease, even though the landlord had changed. So the tenant's possession was still lawful until 1992.

So the adverse possession period would begin when the lease ends, because that's when they no longer have permission to stay. So the starting point is when the lease expired, which is option B.

The question revolves around determining when the tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began. The key is understanding that adverse possession requires possession without the owner's permission. Initially, the tenant had a valid lease from 1985 to 1992, granting them lawful possession. Even though the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986 after the widow's death, the lease remained in effect until its expiration in 1992. Until that point, the tenant's possession was permissive, as the lease transferred to the new owner, the Boy Scouts of America, upon the widow's death.

Stopping rent payments during the lease term does not automatically convert the possession into adverse possession, as the tenant still held a lawful right to occupy the property under the lease. Similarly, the tenant's subjective belief about permission is irrelevant; what matters is the objective legal status of the possession.

The statutory period for adverse possession could only begin once the lease expired in 1992, as that is when the tenant's lawful right to occupy the property ended. From that point onward, if the tenant continued to occupy the property without permission, the adverse possession period would start.

Option B correctly identifies that the statutory period began when the tenant's lease with the widow expired.
