Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It's about constructing a truth table for an argument and determining if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to find a counterexample from the given options. Hmm, let me think.

The argument given is in the form of three propositions:

1. ~X ⊃ Y
2. Y ⊃ Z
3. ~Z 
And the conclusion is / ~X. Wait, I think the conclusion is ~X, but maybe I should check the formatting. Oh right, the third line is written as ~Z / ~X, which probably means the premises are ~X→Y, Y→Z, and the conclusion is ~X. So the argument is:

~X → Y
Y → Z
∴ ~X

Wait, no, actually, looking again, the third line is written as ~Z / ~X. Oh wait, perhaps I misread that. Maybe it's presented as two premises and a conclusion. Let me parse this correctly.

Wait, in the question, it says: "Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid." So the argument is:

Premise 1: ~X ⊃ Y
Premise 2: Y ⊃ Z
Premise 3: ~Z
Conclusion: ~X

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the way it's written is:

~X ⊃ Y
Y ⊃ Z
~Z / ~X

Ah, I think the first two lines are premises, and the third line is the conclusion. So the argument is:

Premises:
1. ~X → Y
2. Y → Z

Conclusion:
~X

Wait, no, that can't be right because the third line is written as ~Z / ~X, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's an argument presented as three lines, with the last line being the conclusion. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the third line is a single premise, but that would make the conclusion ~X. Wait, perhaps the argument is:

Premises:
1. ~X → Y
2. Y → Z
3. ~Z

Conclusion: ~X

Wait, that would make the argument have three premises, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the third line is the conclusion, and the first two are premises. So the argument is:

Premises:
1. ~X → Y
2. Y → Z

Conclusion: ~X.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the third line is the conclusion, written as ~Z / ~X, but that's not clear. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should look at the argument structure.

Wait, perhaps the argument is in the form:

Premise 1: If not X then Y.
Premise 2: If Y then Z.
Premise 3: Not Z.
Therefore, conclusion: Not X.

Wait, no, because the third line is written as ~Z / ~X, which might mean that ~Z is a premise leading to ~X as the conclusion. So perhaps the argument is:

1. ~X → Y
2. Y → Z
3. ~Z
∴ ~X

So three premises: ~X→Y, Y→Z, and ~Z, and the conclusion is ~X.

Wait, but that would make the argument have three premises. Or perhaps it's two premises and a conclusion. Let me think. The way it's presented is:

~X ⊃ Y
Y ⊃ Z
~Z / ~X

Which I think translates to:

Premises:
1. ~X → Y
2. Y → Z

Conclusion:
~X

Wait, but where does ~Z come into play? Because the third line starts with ~Z. Alternatively, perhaps the third line is another premise. Hmm, now I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe the structure is:

Premise 1: ~X → Y
Premise 2: Y → Z
Premise 3: ~Z
Conclusion: ~X

So, the argument is: From ~X→Y, Y→Z, and ~Z, conclude ~X.

Wait, but that's three premises. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is two premises and a conclusion, with the third line being something else. Hmm, perhaps the third line is the conclusion. So the argument is:

Premise 1: ~X → Y
Premise 2: Y → Z
Conclusion: ~X

But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the third line is indicating that ~Z is a premise leading to ~X as the conclusion. So perhaps the argument is:

Premise 1: ~X → Y
Premise 2: Y → Z
Premise 3: ~Z
Conclusion: ~X

Yes, that makes sense. So the argument is:

1. ~X → Y
2. Y → Z
3. ~Z
∴ ~X

Wait, but that would mean three premises. Alternatively, perhaps the third line is the conclusion. Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed to build the truth table for all possible combinations of X, Y, Z.

The propositions are X, Y, Z. So the variables are X, Y, Z. So the truth table will have 8 rows.

I can structure the table as follows:

X | Y | Z | ~X | ~X→Y | Y→Z | ~Z | Conclusion: ~X

Wait, but for the argument, the premises are:

1. ~X→Y
2. Y→Z
3. ~Z (as a premise)
Conclusion: ~X

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is a syllogism where the premises are ~X→Y and Y→Z, and the conclusion is ~Z→~X, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the argument is:

If ~X, then Y.
If Y, then Z.
Therefore, if ~Z, then ~X.

Wait, that would make sense as a hypothetical syllogism. Because in that case, the form is:

~X → Y
Y → Z
∴ ~Z → ~X

But in the given problem, the conclusion is ~X, not ~Z→~X. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is:

From ~X→Y and Y→Z, conclude ~X.

But that doesn't seem valid because the premises don't necessarily lead to ~X. So perhaps the truth table will help.

Let me try to construct the truth table step by step.

The variables are X, Y, Z. So each can be T or F.

I'll list all 8 combinations.

For each row, I'll compute:

~X: negation of X
~X→Y: implication
Y→Z: implication
~Z: negation of Z
And then the conclusion ~X.

Wait, but how does that help? Because the argument is that from ~X→Y, Y→Z, and ~Z, we conclude ~X.

Wait, no, perhaps the argument is:

Premises: ~X→Y, Y→Z, and ~Z. Conclusion: ~X.

So, for each row, I need to check if when the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's any row where premises are true but conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that row is a counterexample.

So, let's build the table:

Row 1: X=T, Y=T, Z=T

~X=F

~X→Y=T (because F→T is T)
Y→Z=T (T→T)
~Z=F

So premises are: ~X→Y=T, Y→Z=T, ~Z=F. So not all premises are true here.

Row 2: X=T, Y=T, Z=F

~X=F

~X→Y=T
Y→Z=F (T→F is F)
~Z=T

So premises: ~X→Y=T, Y→Z=F, ~Z=T. So Y→Z is F, so premises are not all true.

Row3: X=T, Y=F, Z=T

~X=F

~X→Y=T
Y→Z=T (F→T is T)
~Z=F

So premises: ~X→Y=T, Y→Z=T, ~Z=F. So all premises are true except ~Z is F, so overall premises are not all true.

Row4: X=T, Y=F, Z=F

~X=F

~X→Y=T
Y→Z=T (F→F is T)
~Z=T

So premises: ~X→Y=T, Y→Z=T, ~Z=T. All premises are T here. Conclusion is ~X=F. So in this row, premises are all T, but conclusion is F. So this is a counterexample. So the argument is invalid.

Wait, but wait, in this row: X=T, Y=F, Z=F.

Let me confirm:

Premise1: ~X→Y. Since X=T, ~X=F. F→Y is T regardless of Y. So premise1 is T.

Premise2: Y→Z. Y=F, Z=F. F→F is T. So premise2 is T.

Premise3: ~Z. Z=F, so ~Z=T. So premise3 is T.

Conclusion: ~X. X=T, so ~X=F.

So in this row, all premises are true, but conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid. So the correct answer must be that the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when X=T, Y=F, Z=F.

Looking at the options, let me check each option.

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when X, Y, Z are T. But in that case, Z is T, so ~Z is F, so premises are not all true. So that's not a counterexample.

Option F: Invalid. Counterexample when X=F, Y=T, Z=T. Let's check that row.

Wait, X=F, Y=T, Z=T.

~X=T.

Premise1: T→T=T
Premise2: T→T=T
Premise3: ~Z=F.

So premises are all T except premise3 is F. So not all premises are true. So this can't be a counterexample.

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when Y=T, X=F, Z=F.

Wait, Y=T, X=F, Z=F.

So X=F, Y=T, Z=F.

Compute premises:

~X=T.

Premise1: T→T=T.

Premise2: T→F=F.

So premise2 is F. So not all premises are true. So not a counterexample.

Option H: Invalid. Counterexample when X=T, Y=F, Z=F. Which matches what I found earlier. So option H says: Invalid. Counterexample when X=T, Y=F, Z=F. Wait, no, option H says: X=T, Y=F, Z=F. So that's when X is true, Y and Z are false. Yes, that's our counterexample.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option H: Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false.

Yes, that's exactly our case: X=T, Y=F, Z=F. So that's the counterexample.

So the correct answer should be option H.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are T and Z is F. Wait, Y=T, Z=F. So when Y=T and Z=F. Let me see if that's a counterexample.

In that case, let's take Y=T, Z=F. So X can be T or F.

If X=T, then ~X=F. So premise1: F→Y=T, premise2: Y=T→Z=F, which is F. So premise2 is F. So not all premises are true.

If X=F, then ~X=T. So premise1: T→Y=T (since Y=T). Premise2: T→Z=F. So premise2=F. So not all premises are true. So D is not a counterexample.

Option E: X, Y, Z all T. Then ~Z=F. So premise3 is F. So not a counterexample.

Option F: X=F, Y=T, Z=T. Then ~Z=F. So premise3 is F. So not a counterexample.

Option G: Y=T, X=F, Z=F. So X=F, Y=T, Z=F.

Then, ~X=T.

Premise1: T→T=T.

Premise2: T→F=F. So premise2 is F. So premises not all true. So not a counterexample.

So the only counterexample is when X=T, Y=F, Z=F, which is option H.

To determine the validity of the argument, we construct a truth table for the propositions **~X → Y**, **Y → Z**, **~Z**, and the conclusion **~X**. The argument is:

1. **~X → Y**  
2. **Y → Z**  
3. **~Z**  
∴ **~X**

### Truth Table Analysis:
The truth table evaluates all possible combinations of **X**, **Y**, and **Z** (8 rows). For each row, we compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion. The argument is valid if, in every row where all premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there is any row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that row provides a counterexample.

| X | Y | Z | ~X | ~X → Y | Y → Z | ~Z | ~X (Conclusion) |
|---|---|---|----|--------|--------|----|-----------------|
| T | T | T | F  | T      | T      | F  | F               |
| T | T | F | F  | T      | F      | T  | F               |
| T | F | T | F  | T      | T      | F  | F               |
| T | F | F | F  | T      | T      | T  | F               |
| F | T | T | T  | T      | T      | F  | T               |
| F | T | F | T  | T      | F      | T  | T               |
| F | F | T | T  | F      | T      | F  | T               |
| F | F | F | T  | F      | T      | T  | T               |

### Key Observations:
1. The argument is invalid because there is at least one row where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false.
2. Specifically, in the row where **X = T**, **Y = F**, and **Z = F**:
   - **~X → Y = T** (since **~X = F** and **F → F = T**),
   - **Y → Z = T** (since **Y = F** and **F → F = T**),
   - **~Z = T** (since **Z = F**),
   - but **~X = F** (since **X = T**).

This row shows that the premises are all true, but the conclusion is false, making the argument invalid. The counterexample is when **X = T**, **Y = F**, and **Z = F**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A, B, C**: Incorrect. The argument is not valid because a counterexample exists.
- **D**: Incorrect. The counterexample described does not match the truth table analysis.
- **E**: Incorrect. When **X, Y, Z = T**, **~Z = F**, so not all premises are true.
- **F**: Incorrect. When **X = F**, **Y = T**, **Z = T**, **~Z = F**, so not all premises are true.
- **G**: Incorrect. When **X = F**, **Y = T**, **Z = F**, **Y → Z = F**, so not all premises are true.
- **H**: Correct. The counterexample occurs when **X = T**, **Y = F**, **Z = F**, as shown in the truth table.
- **I**: Incorrect. When **X, Y, Z = F**, **~X → Y = F**, so not all premises are true.
- **J**: Incorrect. When **X = T**, **Z = T**, **Y = F**, **~X → Y = T** and **Y → Z = T**, but **~Z = F**, so not all premises are true.

### Final Answer:
**H**
