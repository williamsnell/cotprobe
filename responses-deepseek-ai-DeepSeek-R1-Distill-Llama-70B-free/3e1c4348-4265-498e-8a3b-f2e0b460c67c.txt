Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive disintegration measurements. Let's see what it's asking. A student made 10 one-second measurements and got these values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. The question is, how long should the student count to establish the rate with an uncertainty of 1 percent?

Hmm. I remember that radioactive decay follows a Poisson distribution, especially when dealing with counts. The uncertainty in such measurements is related to the square root of the number of counts. Oh wait, because for a Poisson distribution, the variance equals the mean, so the standard deviation is the square root of the mean.

So first, I think I need to find the average count rate. Let me calculate the total counts. The numbers are 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. Let's sum them up.

3 + 0 is 3, plus 2 is 5, then +1=6, +2=8, +4=12, +0=12, +1=13, +2=15, +5=20. So total counts are 20 over 10 seconds. Therefore the average count rate is 20 counts over 10 seconds, which is 2 counts per second. So the mean is 2.

The uncertainty (standard deviation) for each one-second measurement would be sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414. But wait, the question is about the uncertainty in the rate, not the counts. Because each measurement is one second, the count rate is just the counts per second. So if the student takes multiple measurements, each of one second, and averages them, the uncertainty in the mean would be the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each measurement is a one-second count. The student made 10 such measurements, so the mean is 2 counts per second, as I calculated. The standard deviation (uncertainty) for each measurement is sqrt(2). But when you average N measurements, the uncertainty of the mean is sigma / sqrt(N), where sigma is the standard deviation of a single measurement.

So with N=10, the uncertainty is sqrt(2)/sqrt(10). Let's compute that. sqrt(2) is about 1.414, sqrt(10) is about 3.162. So 1.414 / 3.162 ≈ 0.447. So the uncertainty in the mean rate is about 0.447 counts per second.

But the question wants the uncertainty to be 1% of the rate. The rate is 2 counts per second. So 1% of 2 is 0.02. We need the uncertainty to be 0.02 or less.

So the formula for the uncertainty in the mean is sigma / sqrt(N_total), where N_total is the total number of measurements. Wait, wait. Wait, the total number of seconds is the number of measurements, since each measurement is one second. So the total time is T = N * 1 second.

But the count rate is (total counts) / T. The total counts would be a Poisson variable with mean λ*T, where λ is the true rate. The variance is λ*T, so the standard deviation is sqrt(λ*T). Therefore, the standard deviation of the rate (which is counts per second) would be sqrt(λ*T) / T = sqrt(λ/(T)).

Wait, yes. So the standard deviation of the rate is sqrt(λ) / sqrt(T), where lambda is the true rate.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The number of counts is a Poisson variable with mean μ = λ*T. The variance is also μ = λ*T. The rate is counts/T, so the variance of the rate is (λ*T)/(T^2) ) = λ / T. So the standard deviation is sqrt(λ / T).

So the uncertainty in the rate is sqrt(λ) / sqrt(T). Because sqrt(λ/T) is the same as sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T).

We want this uncertainty to be 1% of the rate, which is 0.01*λ.

So set sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T) = 0.01 * λ.

Let me write that:

sqrt(λ) / sqrt(T) = 0.01 * λ

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

(λ) / T = (0.01 λ)^2

Simplify that:

λ / T = 0.0001 λ²

Divide both sides by λ (assuming λ ≠ 0):

1 / T = 0.0001 λ

So solving for T:

T = 1 / (0.0001 * λ) ) = 1/(0.0001 λ) = 10000 / λ.

Wait, because 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4 * λ) ) = 1e4 / λ.

So T = 10000 / λ.

But wait, the student's initial measurements gave a mean rate of 2 counts per second. So lambda would be 2.

So T = 10000 / 2 = 5000 seconds.

Looking at the options, option G is 5000 s. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning.

We have uncertainty in rate = sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T) = 1% of λ.

So,

sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T) = 0.01 λ

Multiply both sides by sqrt(T):

sqrt(λ) = 0.01 λ * sqrt(T)

Square both sides:

λ = (0.01)^2 * lambda^2 * T

Simplify:

1 = (0.0001) * lambda * T

So,

T = 1 / (0.0001 * lambda) ) = 10000 / lambda.

Yes, that's correct. So if lambda is 2, then T is 5000 seconds.

So the correct answer is G:5000 s.

To determine how long the student should count to establish the rate of disintegration with an uncertainty of 1%, we start by analyzing the given data. The student made 10 one-second measurements of the radioactive disintegration, yielding the following counts: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. The total number of counts is:

\[
3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 20
\]

The average count rate is therefore:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Counts}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \, \text{counts per second}.
\]

In radioactive decay, the number of counts follows a Poisson distribution, where the variance equals the mean. The uncertainty in the count rate is given by the standard deviation of the rate, which is:

\[
\text{Uncertainty in Rate} = \sqrt{\lambda} / \sqrt{T},
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the true rate and \( T \) is the total counting time. The problem requires the uncertainty to be 1% of the rate, so:

\[
\sqrt{\lambda} / \sqrt{T} = 0.01 \lambda.
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\[
\lambda / T = (0.01 \lambda)^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\lambda / T = 0.0001 \lambda^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( \lambda \) (assuming \( \lambda \neq 0 \)):

\[
1 / T = 0.0001 \lambda.
\]

Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = 1 / (0.0001 \lambda) = 10000 / \lambda.
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 2 \):

\[
T = 10000 / 2 = 5000 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the student should count for 5000 seconds to achieve an uncertainty of 1% in the rate. The correct answer is:

**G: 5000 s.**
