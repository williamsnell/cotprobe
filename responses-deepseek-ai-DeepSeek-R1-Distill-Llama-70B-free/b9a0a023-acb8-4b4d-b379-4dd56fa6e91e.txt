Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: The probability that a point (x, y) in R² is chosen such that it follows a uniform distribution within the region described by 0 < |x| + |y| < 1. I need to find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1.

Hmm, okay. So the region is defined by |x| + |y| being between 0 and 1. Wait, no, it's 0 < |x| + |y| < 1, which means the points are inside the diamond shape (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1), but not including the boundary since it's strictly less than 1. But wait, the inequality is 0 < |x| + |y| < 1, so the area is actually the region between two diamonds: one at radius 0 (which is just the origin) and radius 1. So the region is the area inside the diamond of radius 1, but excluding the origin. But wait, the origin is a single point, so in terms of area, it's negligible. So the area we're considering is the diamond |x| + |y| < 1, excluding (0,0). But since the distribution is uniform, the probability density is uniform over the area.

First, I need to find the area of the entire region where the point can be. The region is a square with side length sqrt(2), but wait, no. The region |x| + |y| < 1 is a diamond. The area of a diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), etc., is calculated as follows: The diamond consists of four congruent right triangles. Each triangle has legs of length 1, so area is (1*1)/2 = 0.5 for each. So four of them give 4*(0.5) = 2. Wait, that can't be right because wait |x| + |y| < 1 is a square with vertices at (±1,0), (0,±1), right? So each side is sqrt(2), but the area is 2. Because the area of a square is side squared times (1/2) if it's a diamond. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the area when you have |x| + |y| ≤ k is 2k². So when k=1, area is 2*(1)^2=2. So the area is 2. But wait, the inequality is 0 < |x| + |y| <1, so the region is the same as |x| + |y| ≤1 but excluding the origin. But as I said, the origin doesn't contribute to area, so the total area is 2.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's compute the area step by step. The equation |x| + |y| = 1 describes a diamond with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1). So the shape is a square rotated by 45 degrees. The area can be calculated as the area of a square with side length sqrt(2) (the distance between (1,0) and (0,1) is sqrt(2)), but wait, the area of a square is side length squared, which would be 2. Alternatively, since it's a square with diagonals of length 2 (from -1 to 1 on both axes), the area is (d1 * d2)/2 = (2*2)/2=2. So yes, the area is 2.

But wait, the region is 0 < |x| + |y| <1, which is the interior of the diamond, excluding the boundary. So the area is exactly 2*(1)^2 = 2? Hmm, but wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Let me think again. The area enclosed by |x/a| + |y/b| ≤1 is 4ab. So in this case, a=1 and b=1, so area is 4*1*1=4? Wait no, that's not correct. Because for the diamond |x| + |y| ≤1, it's a square with side sqrt(2), area is 2. So that formula must be different. Alternatively, maybe it's 2*(base)*(height), but for a diamond, each triangle has area (1 *1)/2, four of them gives 2.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The region |x| + |y| ≤1 is a square centered at the origin, with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1). So each side is the line connecting (1,0) to (0,1), which is a line of length sqrt(2). So each of the four sides is a right triangle with legs of length 1. The area of each triangle is 0.5, so four give 2. So the total area is 2.

Now, the condition is 0 < |x| + |y| < 1. So the region is the interior of the diamond, excluding the origin. But the origin is a single point, so its area is zero. Therefore, the total area where the point can be is 2.

Wait, no. Wait, if |x| + |y| can be zero, but the condition is 0 < |x| + |y| <1, so the origin is excluded. But again, the area of a single point is zero, so the area is still 2.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense because if |x| + |y| is less than 1, and greater than 0, the area is the same as |x| + |y| ≤1, except for a single point. So the area is 2.

So the total area is 2. So the probability distribution is uniform over this area.

Now, the question is to find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1, which is equivalent to x + y > 1/2.

So we need to find the area within the diamond |x| + |y| <1 where x + y > 1/2, and then divide that by the total area (which is 2) to get the probability.

So the approach is:

1. Sketch the region defined by |x| + |y| <1.

2. Within this region, find the area where x + y > 1/2.

3. Divide that area by 2 to get the probability.

Let me visualize the diamond. It's a square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1). The line x + y = 1/2 is a straight line. Let's plot this line within the diamond.

The line x + y = 1/2 intersects where? Let's find the points where this line intersects the diamond.

The diamond's edges are the lines x + y =1, x - y =1, -x + y=1, and -x - y=1.

Wait, no, the diamond |x| + |y| =1 has four edges:

1. x ≥0, y ≥0: x + y =1.

2. x ≥0, y ≤0: x - y =1.

3. x ≤0, y ≥0: -x + y =1.

4. x ≤0, y ≤0: -x - y =1.

So the line x + y = 1/2 will intersect the diamond. Let's find where.

In the first quadrant (x ≥0, y ≥0), the diamond edge is x + y =1. So the line x + y =1/2 is parallel to this edge but lower. It will intersect the diamond edges in two points.

Wait, in which quadrants does x + y =1/2 lie? It's in the first and third quadrants? No, because x and y could be positive or negative. Wait, for x + y =1/2, in the first quadrant, x and y are positive, so it'll cut the diamond. Let's find the points of intersection.

In the first quadrant, the diamond edge is x + y =1. The line x + y=1/2 is parallel and lies inside the diamond. It will intersect the diamond's edges where else? Let's see: In the first quadrant, the diamond's edges are x=0 (to y=1), y=0 (to x=1), and x + y=1.

Wait, no. The diamond's edges are four lines. So the line x + y=1/2 will intersect two edges of the diamond.

Wait, in the first quadrant, the diamond's edge is x + y=1, but the line x + y=1/2 is inside. Wait, perhaps it only intersects the diamond in two other quadrants.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find where x + y =1/2 intersects |x| + |y| =1.

Let me solve for intersections.

Case 1: x ≥0, y ≥0.

Here, |x| + |y| = x + y =1.

We set x + y =1/2. So to find where these two lines meet, we can solve x + y =1 and x + y =1/2. But these are parallel lines, so they don't intersect. So no solution in this region.

Wait, that can't be. If I have two parallel lines, they don't intersect. So in the first quadrant, the line x + y=1/2 is parallel to x + y=1, so no intersection there.

Case 2: x ≥0, y ≤0.

In this region, |x| + |y| =x - y =1.

So we have x - y =1 and x + y =1/2.

Adding the two equations:

x - y =1

x + y =1/2

Adding: 2x = 3/2 → x=3/4.

Substituting back x=3/4 into x + y=1/2 → y=1/2 -3/4 = -1/4.

So one point is (3/4, -1/4).

Case 3: x ≤0, y ≥0.

Here, |x| + |y| =-x + y =1.

We have -x + y=1 and x + y=1/2.

Adding the two equations: (-x + y) + (x + y )= 3/2 → 2y =3/2 → y=3/4.

Substitute y=3/4 into x + y=1/2 → x=1/2 -3/4 = -1/4.

So another point is (-1/4, 3/4).

Case 4: x ≤0, y ≤0.

Here, |x| + |y| =-x - y=1.

Set this equal to x + y=1/2.

So -x - y=1 and x + y=1/2.

Adding the two equations: 0= 3/2 → which is impossible. So no solution in this case.

So the line x + y=1/2 intersects the diamond at two points: (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4).

Now, the region x + y >1/2 within the diamond is the area above the line x + y=1/2.

So to find this area, let's think about the shape. The line cuts the diamond, creating a polygon. The region where x + y >1/2 is a polygon bounded by parts of the diamond and the line.

So the polygon is a quadrilateral? Let me think about the vertices of this region.

Wait, in the first quadrant, the line x + y=1/2 doesn't reach the diamond's edge because in the first quadrant, the diamond's edge is x + y=1, which is higher. So in the first quadrant, above x + y=1/2 would be a region bounded by x + y=1, x=0, y=0, but wait, no. Because in the first quadrant, the line x + y=1/2 is below the diamond edge. So the region x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is a triangle bounded by x + y=1, x + y=1/2, x=0, and y=0.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In the first quadrant, the diamond's boundary is x + y=1. The line x + y=1/2 is below this. So above x + y=1/2 in the first quadrant would be between x + y=1/2 and x + y=1. So the area in the first quadrant where x + y >1/2 is a trapezoid or a triangle.

Wait, in the first quadrant, the line x + y=1/2 intersects the axes at (1/2,0) and (0,1/2). The diamond's edge is at (1,0) and (0,1). So the area in the first quadrant where x + y >1/2 is a quadrilateral with vertices at (1/2,0), (0,1/2), (0,1), (1,0), and (1/2,0). Wait, no, that can't be, because x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant would be the area above the line x + y=1/2 and within the diamond.

Wait, perhaps the area can be calculated as the area of the diamond (which is 2) minus the area where x + y ≤1/2.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the area where x + y >1/2 by integrating or by finding the geometric shape.

Let me focus on the region where x + y >1/2 within the diamond |x| + |y| <1.

I can split this into regions based on quadrants.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in the first quadrant and then multiply by 2, considering symmetry? Wait, no, because the line x + y=1/2 is not symmetric in all quadrants. Let me think: The line x + y=1/2 passes through the first and third quadrants?

Wait, no. Because x + y=1/2 when x and y are positive is in the first quadrant, but when x is negative and y is positive, it can also have points. Let me see: For example, x=-1/4, y=3/4 is on the line, as found earlier. So the line passes through the first and second quadrants. Wait, no: in the second case, x was negative and y positive, so it's in the second quadrant.

Wait, but the diamond is symmetric in all four quadrants, so perhaps the area where x + y >1/2 can be considered in each quadrant.

But maybe I should compute the area in each quadrant where x + y >1/2.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the area in the first quadrant where x + y >1/2 and then multiply by 2, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area where x + y >1/2 within the diamond. Let's model the diamond as four triangles.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the area using integration or geometric analysis.

Let me try to compute the area where x + y >1/2 within the diamond.

We found that the line x + y =1/2 intersects the diamond at (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4). So the region x + y >1/2 is a polygon bounded by:

- From (-1/4, 3/4) to (0,1): along the line x + y=1 (since in the second quadrant, the diamond's edge is -x + y=1, but wait, no, in the second quadrant x is negative, y positive, so |x| + |y| = -x + y =1.

Wait, maybe I should break the region into parts.

The region where x + y >1/2 is bounded by:

1. The line x + y=1/2 from (3/4, -1/4) to (-1/4,3/4).

2. The edges of the diamond beyond this line.

So the area where x + y >1/2 consists of two parts:

- The area in the first quadrant above x + y=1/2.

- The area in the second quadrant above x + y=1/2.

Wait, but wait, in the second quadrant, x is negative and y can be positive or negative. So perhaps it's better to think in terms of each quadrant.

But maybe I should compute the area in each quadrant where x + y >1/2.

Let's consider each quadrant:

First Quadrant (x≥0, y≥0):

In this quadrant, |x| + |y|=x + y <1.

The line x + y=1/2 cuts through this quadrant. The area where x + y >1/2 is a trapezoid bounded by x + y=1/2, x + y=1, x=0, and y=0.

Wait, but actually, in the first quadrant, the area where x + y >1/2 is a triangle with vertices at (1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1,0), (0,1). Wait, no, because x + y=1 is the diamond's edge, but the area above x + y=1/2 in the first quadrant is a quadrilateral with vertices at (1/2,0), (0,1/2), (0,1), and (1,0). Hmm, no, that can't be because the line x + y=1/2 is below x + y=1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a triangle formed by the points where x + y=1/2 intersects the axes in the first quadrant and the diamond's edge.

Wait, let's think: In the first quadrant, the line x + y=1/2 intersects the x-axis at (1/2, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 1/2). The diamond's edge in the first quadrant is x + y=1, which goes from (1,0) to (0,1).

So the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is the area between x + y=1/2 and x + y=1.

This is a region bounded by four points
