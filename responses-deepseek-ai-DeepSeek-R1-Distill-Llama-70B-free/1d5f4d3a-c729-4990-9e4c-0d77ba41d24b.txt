Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this fiscal policy question. The question is about what the appropriate fiscal policy would be to remedy inflation. Hmm, I remember that fiscal policy involves government spending and taxes, right? Oh wait, and there are two types: expansionary and contractionary.

Inflation is when prices for goods and services are rising too quickly. So, the government would want to cool down the economy. I think contractionary fiscal policy is used in such cases. Contractionary policies aim to reduce overall spending in the economy, which should help lower inflation.

So, how does contractionary fiscal policy work? I remember that it involves either decreasing government spending, increasing taxes, or both. If the government spends less, that directly reduces demand. Increasing taxes takes money out of people's pockets, so they have less to spend, which also reduces demand. Both actions should help control inflation.

Now looking at the options, I need to find the one that aligns with contractionary measures. Let's go through each option:

Option A: Decreased government spending and increased taxes. That sounds like contractionary because both spending is down and taxes up, reducing demand.

Option B: The federal government decreasing the money supply. Wait, isn't that monetary policy, handled by the central bank? Yes, the Fed controls the money supply, so this is monetary, not fiscal.

Option C: Running a deficit. That's when government spends more than it takes in. That's expansionary, which would increase demand, possibly worsening inflation. So not this.

Option D: Decreased taxes and increased spending. That's expansionary too, so wrong for fighting inflation.

Option E: Increasing the money supply. Again, monetary policy. Also, more money could cause inflation, so not the solution.

Option F: Increased spending and decreased taxes. Expansionary, so not right.

Option G: Running a surplus. If the government takes in more than it spends, that's contractionary. So this could help with inflation.

Option H: Balanced budget. That's neither expansionary nor contractionary. So it doesn't help either way.

Option I: Decreased spending and taxes. Wait, that's a mix. Lower spending is contractionary, but lower taxes are expansionary. So the net effect might be neutral or not as effective as a strong contractionary measure.

Option J: Increased taxes and spending. That's weird. Higher taxes are contractionary, but higher spending is expansionary. So they might offset each other, not sure.

So the correct options are either A or G. Option A is both decreasing spending and raising taxes, which are both contractionary. Option G is running a surplus, which would mean the government is taking in more than it's spending, which also reduces demand.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. How does a surplus affect the economy? If the government is running a surplus, it's collecting more taxes than it's spending, which reduces the amount of money in the economy. So that's contractionary. So both A and G are contractionary.

But the question is about the appropriate fiscal policy. So which one is more directly related? The question says "calls for"â€”I think the most direct actions are changing government spending and taxes, not necessarily the budget balance.

Wait, let me think again. Fiscal policy tools are government spending and taxation. So the correct approach would be to decrease spending and increase taxes, which is option A. Running a surplus (option G) is a result of those actions, but the policy itself is about changing spending and taxes.

So the answer should be A.

The appropriate fiscal policy to remedy inflation involves using contractionary measures, which aim to reduce overall demand in the economy. This can be achieved by decreasing government spending and increasing taxes, as both actions reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy, thereby helping to control inflation. While running a surplus (option G) is a possible outcome of contractionary policies, the question specifically asks about the policy actions themselves, not the result. Therefore, the correct answer focuses on the direct actions of decreasing government spending and increasing taxes.

Answer: A
