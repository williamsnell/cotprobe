Okay, so I've got this problem here about an equilateral triangle with sides of 12 inches, and I need to find its approximate area. Hmm, I remember that the area of a triangle is generally (base * height)/2, but since this is an equilateral triangle, there's a specific formula for that. Wait, what was it again?

Oh right, the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (sqrt(3)/4) multiplied by the side squared. So the formula is Area = (√3/4) * a², where a is the length of a side. Got it.

Alright, so the side length here is 12 inches. Let me plug that into the formula. So that's 12 squared, which is 144. Then, multiply that by sqrt(3)/4. Hmm, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, right? So I can substitute that in for calculation.

So let's do the math step by step. First, 12 squared is 144. Then, 144 multiplied by 1.732. Let me calculate that. 144 * 1.732. Let me break it down: 144 * 1 is 144, 144 * 0.7 is 100.8, and 144 * 0.032 is about 4.608. Adding those together: 144 + 100.8 is 244.8, plus 4.608 gives approximately 249.408.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the formula is (sqrt(3)/4) * a², so I have to remember to divide this by 4 as well. Oh right, I forgot that part. So after multiplying 144 by 1.732, I get 249.408, and then I divide that by 4.

Let me calculate that. 249.408 divided by 4. Well, 240 divided by 4 is 60, and 9.408 divided by 4 is about 2.352. So adding those together, 60 + 2.352 gives me 62.352.

Hmm, so the area is approximately 62.35 square inches. Now I need to look at the options provided to see which one is closest to 62.35.

Looking at the options: A is 142, which is way too high. B is 52, a bit lower. C is 102, even higher. D is 112, no. E is 84, still higher. F is 122, way up. G is 62, which is very close. H is 72, higher than 62.35. I is 132, and J is 92. So the closest option is G:62.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes. Let me recalculate 144 * 1.732. Let me do it differently. 144 * 1.732 = 144*(1 + 0.7 + 0.03 + 0.002) = 144*1 + 144*0.7 + 144*0.03 + 144*0.002.

Calculating each part:

144 * 1 =144

144 *0.7 = 100.8

144 *0.03=4.32

144 *0.002=0.288

Adding all together: 144 + 100.8 = 244.8; 244.8 +4.32 is 249.12; plus 0.288 gives 249.408. So that's correct. Then divide by 4: 249.408 /4 =62.352.

Yes, so the area is approximately 62.35. So the closest option is G:62. So the answer should be G.

The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2
\]

where \( a \) is the side length. For \( a = 12 \) inches:

1. Calculate \( a^2 \):  
   \[
   12^2 = 144
   \]

2. Multiply by \( \sqrt{3} \) (approx. 1.732):  
   \[
   144 \times 1.732 = 249.408
   \]

3. Divide by 4:  
   \[
   \frac{249.408}{4} = 62.352
   \]

Thus, the approximate area is 62.35 square inches. Among the given options, the closest value is **62**.
