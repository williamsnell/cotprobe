Question:

A professional football player was seriously injured when the football helmet he was wearing shattered as he was being tackled during a game. The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.
B: admissible as an admission.
C: inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.
D: admissible as evidence that the manufacturer knew the helmet was defective.
E: admissible, because the former employee has firsthand knowledge of the manufacturer's actions.
F: inadmissible, because the testimony is prejudicial to the manufacturer.
G: admissible as direct evidence that the player's injury was caused by the defective design of the football helmet.
H: inadmissible, because the testimony is hearsay.
I: inadmissible, because the testimony is irrelevant to the case.
J: admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with admissibility in a civil case. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a professional football player was injured when his helmet shattered during a tackle. He's suing the manufacturer. At trial, his attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify about a new helmet design the company made three weeks after the injury. The question is whether this testimony is admissible and under what grounds.

First, I need to recall the rules of evidence. I remember that subsequent remedial measures, like fixing a product after someone is injured, are generally not admissible to prove negligence or defect. The rationale is that it's public policy to encourage fixing problems without fear of legal repercussions. So if a company makes a change after an incident, that change can't be used as evidence that they were negligent before.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible because the former employee isn't authorized to speak for the manufacturer. Well, the testimony is about the company's actions, not the employee's authority. So maybe not the right reason.

Option B suggests it's an admission. I'm not sure. Admissions usually involve statements by a party, not just any employee's testimony about the company's actions. Plus, it's about a subsequent action, which might fall under another rule.

Option C says it's inadmissible because of public policy on safety precautions. That rings a bell because the rule against admitting subsequent remedial measures is based on public policy. So this might be correct.

Option D claims it shows the manufacturer knew the helmet was defective. But if the design change was after the injury, under the rule, it can't be used to prove prior knowledge or defectiveness.

Option E says it's admissible because the former employee has firsthand knowledge. Well, the employee's knowledge might make the testimony competent, but the content is about a subsequent measure, which is a separate issue.

Option F says it's inadmissible because it's prejudicial. While it might be prejudicial, the primary issue is the rule against subsequent remedial measures, not just prejudice.

Option G claims it's direct evidence of causation. I don't think so; it's more circumstantial. Plus, the timing is after the fact, so it can't directly link to the injury.

Option H says it's hearsay. The testimony is about the manufacturer's action, which is a statement of fact, so it's not hearsay. Hearsay is about out-of-court statements offered for their truth, but here it's about the company's action, not a statement someone made.

Option I says it's irrelevant. Well, the design change could be relevant to show negligence, but the rule makes it inadmissible despite relevance.

Option J says it's admissible as circumstantial evidence. But the rule specifically excludes such evidence for proving negligence or defect, even if it's circumstantial.

So putting it all together, the testimony about the new design after the injury is inadmissible because it's a subsequent remedial measure. The reason is public policy, as stated in Option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the rule. FRE 407 says that evidence of subsequent measures is inadmissible to prove negligence or defect, but it's admissible for other purposes like feasibility. So the fact that they changed the design can't be used to show they were negligent before. Therefore, the testimony is inadmissible, making Option C correct.

Alternatively, could it be inadmissible as hearsay? No, because the testimony is about an event (design change) the witness observed, not about someone's statement. So H is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer should be C.

The testimony of the former employee regarding the manufacturer's new helmet design, implemented three weeks after the player's injury, is inadmissible. This is because such evidence constitutes a subsequent remedial measure. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE 407), evidence of steps taken to remedy a problem after an injury is generally inadmissible to prove negligence, defect, or culpability. The public policy underlying this rule encourages parties to take corrective actions without fear that those actions will be used against them in litigation. While the testimony might be relevant, the rule specifically excludes it for the purposes of proving negligence or defectiveness. 

Option C correctly identifies this reasoning, making it the correct answer.
