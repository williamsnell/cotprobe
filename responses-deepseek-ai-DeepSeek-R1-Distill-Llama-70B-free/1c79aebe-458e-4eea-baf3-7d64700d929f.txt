Question:

Immediately after a shooting incident, the police chased one of the shooters into an apartment where he was apprehended and arrested. While in the apartment, a detective noticed some antique furniture that seemed of collectors' quality and was out of place in the squalidly furnished quarters. He moved and turned over the pieces to look for markings and insignia. He called headquarters, and was told that items with those markings and descriptions were stolen from a museum six months earlier. He seized the items and arrested another occupant, who claimed he owned the items, on charges of burglary. That suspect filed a motion to suppress based on there being a warrantless search without probable cause. The police relied on the plain view doctrine. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?

Options:

A: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the officer did not immediately recognize the items as stolen property.
B: No, the evidence was properly seized because the officer had a right to investigate it further once he had properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances.
C: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the items were stolen.
D: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the officer was in a place where he was legally allowed to be when he observed the antique furniture.
E: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply to items that are not immediately identifiable as contraband or evidence of a crime.
F: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the police had no warrant to search the apartment for additional evidence.
G: No, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.
H: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply where the officer had no probable cause to believe that the observed item was contraband.
I: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the police can never search a personal residence or seize any unrelated items after entering for exigent circumstances dealing with something else.
J: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the plain view doctrine allows an officer to seize any item that he or she believes is evidence of a crime.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about the plain view doctrine and whether the evidence will be suppressed. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that after a shooting, police chase a shooter into an apartment and arrest him. While there, a detective notices some antique furniture that looks out of place. He moves and turns over the pieces to check for markings. Then he calls headquarters and finds out they were stolen from a museum six months prior. He seizes them and arrests another occupant who claims ownership. The suspect moves to suppress the evidence, arguing it was a warrantless search without probable cause. The police are relying on the plain view doctrine.

I remember that the plain view doctrine allows police to seize items without a warrant if certain conditions are met. The main points I think are: the officer must be lawfully present at the place where the evidence is in plain view, the officer must have a lawful right of access to the object itself, and it must be immediately apparent that the object is contraband or evidence of a crime. So all three have to be met.

In this case, the officer was lawfully in the apartment because they were chasing a suspect under exigent circumstances, right? Exigent circumstances allow warrantless entry, so that part is probably satisfied. So the first condition is met.

Next, he noticed the antique furniture seemed out of place. So he moved the pieces to look for markings, which led him to call and find out they were stolen. The question is whether it was immediately apparent that the items were contraband. The officer didn't know right away; he had to make a call to find out. So maybe the third condition isn't met because he didn't immediately recognize them as stolen. 

Wait, but he had to investigate further by moving the furniture to find the markings. So does moving the furniture count as a search? If moving it was a search, then without probable cause, it might be an issue. But under the plain view doctrine, can he manipulate the object to check for markings without a warrant?

I think there's a case where officers can pick up or move an object to see if it's contraband, as long as it's in plain view and they have probable cause. So if the furniture was in plain view, and the officer had a reasonable belief that moving it would reveal evidence, then maybe it's allowed.

But wait, the officer didn't know the items were stolen until after he called. So initially, he just thought they looked out of place and were of collector's quality. That might not be enough for probable cause. He had a hunch but not immediate knowledge that they were contraband.

So the plain view doctrine requires that it's immediately apparent. If he didn't know until after checking, then maybe it doesn't apply. So the seizure would be invalid, and the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes, because the officer didn't immediately recognize them as stolen. That seems to align with this reasoning. 

Option E says yes because plain view doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable. That also fits.

Option H says yes because no probable cause. Hmm.

Wait, the plain view doctrine doesn't require probable cause, but rather that the incriminating nature is immediately apparent. So if the officer didn't know right away, then the doctrine doesn't apply. So the officer needed a warrant or probable cause.

So the correct reasoning is that the items weren't immediately recognizable as stolen, so the plain view exception doesn't apply. Thus, the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because officer didn't immediately recognize. That makes sense.

Option E: Yes, because plain view requires immediate identifiability. Also correct.

Wait, but I thought the officer had a reasonable suspicion. So what's the difference between reasonable suspicion and probable cause?

Plain view requires that the officer has probable cause to believe the item is contraband, and that this is immediately apparent. Or wait, no, I think it's that the officer is lawfully present, the item is in plain view, and the incriminating nature is immediately apparent.

So if the officer didn't immediately recognize it as stolen, the third condition isn't met. So the seizure was improper.

So the answer would be either A or E or H.

Looking back, the question is whether the court will suppress the evidence.

Option A: The evidence will be suppressed because the officer didn't immediately recognize the items as stolen. That seems correct.

Option E: The evidence must be suppressed because plain view doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable. Also correct.

Wait, but the officer called headquarters and then found out. So the knowledge came after the fact. So the initial observation wasn't enough for plain view.

So the court would likely suppress the evidence because the plain view doctrine doesn't apply—thus, options A or E.

Option A says the officer didn't immediately recognize, which is why it's suppressed. Option E says plain view doesn't apply because items not immediately identifiable as contraband.

I think both A and E are possible, but the precise legal reasoning is that the plain view doctrine requires immediate recognition. So the answer is either A or E.

Wait, in the case law, the Supreme Court case of Arizona v. Hicks (1987) is relevant. In that case, a police officer moved stereo equipment to check the serial number, which he suspected was stolen. The Court held that moving the equipment constituted a search because it was done to discover evidence, and without probable cause, it was unconstitutional. So in this scenario, by moving the furniture, the officer was conducting a search beyond plain view.

So the seizure would be improper because the officer didn't have probable cause to move the furniture. Thus, the evidence should be suppressed.

In that case, the issue is that moving the furniture to find the markings was a search requiring probable cause. Since he didn't have it yet, the search was invalid.

So in this question, the officer moved the furniture, which was a search. Without probable cause, that's a problem. So the plain view doctrine doesn't apply because he had to conduct a further search to find the evidence.

Therefore, the evidence would be suppressed because the plain view exception wasn't applicable—either because the items weren't immediately identifiable or because moving them was a search without probable cause.

Looking at the options again, option A focuses on immediate recognition, E on plain view not applying, H on no probable cause. 

Wait, in the Hicks case, the issue was that moving the item was a search, and without probable cause, it was invalid. So in this case, the officer's moving the furniture was a search. So the key is that the officer needed probable cause to do that.

So the correct answer would likely be that the evidence is suppressed because the plain view doctrine doesn't apply. So option A or E.

But the options:

Option A: Yes, evidence suppressed because officer didn't immediately recognize.

Option E: Yes, evidence must be suppressed because plain view doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable.

Hmm, both seem correct, but looking at the reasoning, it's because the officer had to conduct a search (moving the furniture) which required probable cause. Since he didn't have it, the evidence is suppressed.

Wait, but the initial observation of the furniture was in plain view. The problem was moving it to find the markings, which was a further search. So maybe the plain view doctrine allows the officer to see the furniture but not to move it without probable cause.

Thus, the officer's action of moving the furniture was a search, and without probable cause, it's invalid. So the evidence is suppressed because moving the furniture was a search beyond the plain view.

In that case, the correct option would be A or E.

Alternatively, the plain view doctrine requires immediate recognition of the item as contraband. Since the officer didn't know until after he called, it's not applicable.

So the correct answer is A or E.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Yes, evidence suppressed because officer didn't immediately recognize.

Option E: Yes, evidence must be suppressed because plain view doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable.

Hmm, both A and E seem to point to the same conclusion, but phrased differently.

Wait, in the question, the officer called headquarters after moving the furniture and found out they were stolen. So the initial moving was based on suspicion, not knowledge.

So the officer's moving the furniture to look for markings was a search. Without probable cause, that's a problem. So the seizure was unlawful.

In that case, the issue is that moving the furniture was a search without probable cause, so the evidence is suppressed. So the answer would be A, E, or perhaps another option.

Wait, let's look at all the options.

Option B: No, evidence properly seized because officer had right to investigate once in under exigent circumstances. I don't think so because exigent circumstances allow entry, but not necessarily further searches without probable cause.

Option C: No, because officer had reasonable suspicion. But reasonable suspicion isn't enough for plain view; needs probable cause.

Option D: No, because officer was legally present. But being legally present isn't enough; the plain view must also be immediately apparent.

Option F: Yes, evidence suppressed because no warrant. But the police might argue plain view, so this isn't necessarily correct.

Option G: No, because plain view and reasonable suspicion. But I think it needs more than reasonable suspicion—it needs probable cause.

Option H: Yes, because no probable cause. That's correct because the officer didn't have probable cause before moving the furniture.

Option I: Yes, police can't search after exigent circumstances. That's an overstatement; they can seize items in plain view.

Option J: No, because plain view allows seizure of any item believed to be evidence. But that's not accurate; it must be immediately apparent.

So the correct answer is either A, E, or H.

But the key issue is that the officer moved the furniture, which was a search, and without probable cause, it's invalid. So the seizure is unlawful.

In Hicks, the officer's moving of the equipment was a search requiring probable cause. So here, moving the furniture was a search, and without probable cause, it's invalid. So the plain view doctrine doesn't apply because the officer didn't have probable cause to conduct that search.

Therefore, the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options, option E states that the plain view doctrine doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable. That aligns because the officer had to search further to find out they were stolen. So E is correct.

Alternatively, option A says the officer didn't immediately recognize, which also points to the same conclusion.

Wait, but in the Hicks case, the Court held that the officer's moving the stereo to find the serial number was a search because it was done to discover evidence. So it's not just about immediate recognition but also that moving the item constitutes a search without probable cause.

So in this scenario, moving the furniture was a search, and without probable cause, it's invalid. Thus, the plain view doctrine doesn't apply because the officer didn't have probable cause to move the furniture.

Therefore, the evidence is suppressed because the officer didn't have probable cause to move the furniture, which was a search beyond plain view.

So looking at the options, option H says the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine doesn't apply where the officer had no probable cause to believe the observed item was contraband.

Wait, but the plain view doctrine doesn't require probable cause; it requires that the incriminating nature is immediately apparent. But in this case, the officer needed to move the furniture to find that out, which required probable cause.

So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to clarify:

Plain view doctrine requires:

1. Officer lawfully present.

2. Object in plain view.

3. Incriminating nature immediately apparent.

In this case, the officer was lawfully present. The furniture was in plain view. But the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent—the officer had to move the furniture to find the markings, which indicates that the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent.

So the third condition fails. Therefore, the plain view doctrine doesn't apply, and the evidence should be suppressed.

So the correct answer would be either A or E.

Option A: Yes, because the officer didn't immediately recognize.

Option E: Yes, because plain view doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable.

I think both are correct, but E is more precise about the doctrine's requirements.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, which focuses on probable cause.

Wait, no. Plain view doesn't require probable cause in the sense of a warrant. It requires that the officer can see the item and immediately recognize it as contraband. So it's more about immediate recognition than probable cause.

So in this case, the officer didn't immediately recognize it as stolen, so the doctrine doesn't apply. Thus, the evidence is suppressed.

So the correct answer is A or E.

Between the two, I think E is the better option because it directly addresses the plain view doctrine's requirement of immediate identifiability.

So I'm leaning towards option A and E. But let me check the options again.

Option A says the officer didn't immediately recognize them as stolen, so evidence suppressed.

Option E says the plain view doctrine doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable as contraband.

Both are correct, but E is more about the doctrine's applicability, while A is about the officer's knowledge.

Since the doctrine requires immediate identifiability, E is the correct reasoning.

Wait, but the officer's moving of the furniture was a search. So the issue is that moving it was a search without probable cause, making the seizure invalid. So that's another angle.

In that case, the problem is that moving the furniture was a search beyond plain view, and without probable cause, it's unconstitutional. So the evidence is suppressed because the officer didn't have probable cause to conduct that search.

So that would point to option H: Yes, evidence must be suppressed because plain view doesn't apply where officer had no probable cause.

Wait, no. The plain view doctrine doesn't require probable cause in the traditional sense but requires that the item's incriminating nature is immediately apparent. So if the officer didn't have that immediate knowledge, the doctrine doesn't apply, and moving the furniture was an unlawful search.

So the correct answer is E: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because plain view doesn't apply to items not immediately identifiable.

Alternatively, option H says it's because there was no probable cause. But I think the key is the immediate identifiability.

So I'm going to go with option E.

The question revolves around the plain view doctrine and whether the evidence will be suppressed. The key points of analysis are:

1. **Plain View Doctrine Requirements**: The doctrine allows warrantless seizure if:
   - The officer is lawfully present.
   - The object is in plain view.
   - The incriminating nature of the object is immediately apparent.

2. **Application to the Scenario**:
   - The officer was lawfully in the apartment under exigent circumstances, satisfying the first condition.
   - The furniture was in plain view, satisfying the second condition.
   - The officer did not immediately recognize the furniture as stolen. He had to move the pieces to find markings and subsequently called headquarters to confirm they were stolen. This means the incriminating nature was not immediately apparent, failing the third condition.

3. **Moving the Furniture as a Search**: Moving the furniture to find markings constitutes a search. Under *Arizona v. Hicks*, moving an object to discover evidence requires probable cause. Since the officer did not have probable cause before moving the furniture, the search was unlawful.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Correct because the officer did not immediately recognize the items as stolen, which is a requirement of the plain view doctrine.
   - **Option E**: Also correct because the plain view doctrine does not apply to items that are not immediately identifiable as contraband or evidence of a crime.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect because the plain view doctrine does not require probable cause in the traditional sense but rather immediate recognition of the item's incriminating nature.

Between A and E, **Option E** is more precise because it directly addresses the doctrine's requirement of immediate identifiability, which was the critical issue in this case.

**Answer: E**
