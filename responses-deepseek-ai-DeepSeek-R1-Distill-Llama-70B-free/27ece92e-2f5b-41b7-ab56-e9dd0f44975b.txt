Okay, so I have this question about Kant's philosophy, specifically about where the moral law comes from according to him. I'm a bit rusty on my Kant, but I remember that he was a big deal in ethics and moral philosophy. Let me try to think this through.

The question is asking who gives each person the moral law. The options are from A to J, each suggesting a different source like one's own will, emotions, God, etc.

I recall that Kant talked a lot about the categorical imperative, which is central to his moral philosophy. From what I remember, he believed that the moral law isn't something external like from God or society, but rather it's grounded in reason. So it's more internal.

Wait, but the question is about whom the moral law is given by. So if it's not from an external source, then maybe it's from the individual's own will. Because Kant's ethics are about acting according to maxims that could be universal laws, and that comes from reason, which is part of the individual's will.

I think he called it the "kingdom of ends," where each person acts as a legislator for the moral law. So each individual's will is part of the universal moral law. So the moral law is given by each person's own will, not by an external authority like God or government.

Looking at the options, option A is "one’s own will." That sounds right. Other options like C (God) or D (Nature) don't fit because Kant's view is more about reason and the individual's will, not external sources.

But wait, I should make sure. Did Kant say that the moral law is given by God? I don't think so. He argued that the moral law is a product of reason, and each rational being legislates it for themselves. So the source is within the individual's rational will, not from a divine being or society.

So yeah, the answer should be A: one’s own will.

Kant's moral philosophy emphasizes that the moral law is derived from reason and is not sourced from external entities like God, nature, or society. Instead, it is grounded in the individual's rational will, as each person acts as a legislator in the "kingdom of ends." Therefore, the moral law is given by one's own will.

Answer: A
