Okay, so I've got this problem here about an invoice payment and a cash discount. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question says that $416.50 was the payment made in full after taking a cash discount of $8.50. I need to find out what the original amount of the invoice was.

Wait, so the payment after discount is $416.50, and the discount was $8.50. I think this means that the $416.50 is the amount paid after subtracting the discount from the invoice total. So the original invoice must have been higher than that.

Let me put this into an equation. Let's say the invoice amount is X. The cash discount is $8.50, so the payment made would be X minus the discount. But wait, no, actually, I think the cash discount is a percentage or a fixed amount that's subtracted when the payment is made. So the payment equals the invoice amount minus the discount.

So, payment = X - discount. We know the payment is $416.50, and the discount is $8.50. So plugging in the numbers: 416.50 = X - 8.50. To find X, I would add the discount back to the payment. So X = 416.50 + 8.50.

Let me do the math. 416.50 plus 8.50. 416 plus 8 is 424, and 0.50 plus 0.50 is 1. So adding them together gives 425. So X is $425.00.

Looking at the options, option A is $425.00. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: The discount is the difference between the invoice and what was paid. So discount = invoice - payment. So 8.50 = X - 416.50. Solving for X, X = 416.50 +8.50 =425. Yep, same result.

I think I'm confident that the answer is A.

The question asks for the original invoice amount when a payment of $416.50 was made after a cash discount of $8.50. The relationship between the invoice amount (X), the payment, and the discount can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Payment} = X - \text{Discount}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
416.50 = X - 8.50
\]

To find \( X \), add the discount to the payment:

\[
X = 416.50 + 8.50 = 425.00
\]

Thus, the original invoice amount was $425.00, which corresponds to option A.
