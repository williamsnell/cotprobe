Okay, so I've got this question about Nagel and moral assessment. Hmm, I remember that Nagel wrote about moral luck, right? He argued that people shouldn't be morally judged based on factors beyond their control. Wait, but the question is about what people can't be assessed for prior to reflection.

The options are A through H. Let me think about each one. Nagel's point was that prior to reflection, people might hold others morally responsible for things they can't control. But after reflection, they realize that's not fair.

So the question is, what can't people be morally assessed for before reflection? The answer should relate to factors beyond their control. Looking at the options, option E says "what is due to factors beyond their control." That fits because Nagel says we shouldn't hold people responsible for such things.

Wait, let me double-check the other options. Option B is actions under duress. I think duress is a factor beyond control, so maybe that's also a possibility. But Nagel's main point is about broader factors, not just specific situations like duress. So E seems more general and correct.

Other options like actions affecting only themselves (A) or not violating rights (C) don't directly relate to control. So I think the answer is E.

The question asks about Nagel's claim regarding moral assessment prior to reflection. Nagel argues that people should not be morally judged for factors beyond their control. Among the options, E directly addresses this by stating "what is due to factors beyond their control," which aligns with Nagel's perspective. Other options, like B (actions under duress), relate to specific situations but are not as general or central to Nagel's argument as E.

Answer: E
