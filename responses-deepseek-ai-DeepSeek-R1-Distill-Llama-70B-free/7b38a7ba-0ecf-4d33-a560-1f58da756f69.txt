Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to evaluate f(t) given the Laplace transform F(s). The function F(s) is (2s² + 13s +17) divided by (s+1)(s+3). And I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms can be inverted to find the time domain function. So I think I need to perform partial fraction decomposition on F(s) to break it down into simpler terms. Then, using the inverse Laplace transform properties, I can find f(t).

Let me start by writing F(s) as:

F(s) = (2s² +13s +17) / [(s+1)(s+3)]

Wait a second, the denominator factors are already linear, which is good. But the numerator is a quadratic, so I'm thinking maybe I can split this into simpler fractions. But since the numerator's degree is equal to the denominator's degree (both are degree 2), I should first perform polynomial division to separate it into a proper fraction plus a polynomial.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the degree of the numerator is 2, same as denominator. So I can start by dividing. Let me do that. Let's see:

Divide 2s² +13s +17 by (s+1)(s+3) which is s² +4s +3.

So how many times does s²+4s+3 go into 2s²+13s+17? Let's see: 2 times because 2*(s²+4s+3) is 2s²+8s+6. Subtracting this from the original numerator:

(2s² +13s +17) - (2s² +8s +6) = 5s +11.

So F(s) becomes 2 + (5s +11)/(s² +4s +3). Wait, but s²+4s+3 factors into (s+1)(s+3), right?

Now, I can rewrite F(s) as 2 + (5s +11)/[(s+1)(s+3)].

Next step is partial fraction on (5s +11)/[(s+1)(s+3)]. Let's express this as A/(s+1) + B/(s+3).

So 5s +11 = A(s+3) + B(s+1).

Expanding the right side: A s + 3A + B s + B = (A+B)s + (3A + B).

Setting coefficients equal:

For s terms: A + B =5.

Constants: 3A + B = 11.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: 2A =6 → A=3.

Then B=5-3=2.

So the partial fractions give (3)/(s+1) + (2)/(s+3).

Putting it all together, F(s) is 2 + 3/(s+1) + 2/(s+3).

Now, taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term. Remember that the inverse of 1/(s+a) is e^(-a t) u(t), and the inverse of a constant term 'k' is k δ(t).

Wait, but '2' in the F(s) is a constant. The Laplace transform of a constant is s/(s), but wait, no. Wait, L{f(t)} = F(s), so if F(s)=2, that's 2 times 1, which would correspond to 2 δ(t) in the time domain. Because L{δ(t)} =1, so 2 δ(t) would have L{2 δ(t)}=2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Laplace transform of δ(t) is 1. So if F(s) has a term '2', that's 2 * (1), which corresponds to 2 δ(t) in the time domain.

But wait, another perspective: F(s) = 2 + 3/(s+1) + 2/(s+3). So the inverse Laplace would be:

L^{-1} {2} = 2 δ(t),

L^{-1} {3/(s+1)} = 3 e^{-t} u(t),

L^{-1} {2/(s+3)} = 2 e^{-3t} u(t).

So adding them up, f(t) = 2 δ(t) + 3 e^{-t} u(t) + 2 e^{-3t} u(t).

Looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option B is 2δ(t) + (3e^{-t} +2e^{-3t}) u(t).

Yes, that's exactly what I got.

Wait, let me double-check the other options. Option B is correct.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the partial fractions.

We had (5s +11) = A(s+3) + B(s+1).

Then for s=-3: 5*(-3) +11 = -15 +11 = -4 = A(0) + B(-3+1)= B*(-2). So -4 = -2B → B=2.

And s=-1: 5*(-1)+11= -5+11=6= A(-1 +3) + B(0) → 6=2A → A=3. So yes, correct.

So the inverse is correct, and option B is the right answer.

To evaluate \( f(t) \) given \( F(s) = \frac{2s^2 + 13s + 17}{(s+1)(s+3)} \), we start by performing polynomial division since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal. Dividing \( 2s^2 + 13s + 17 \) by \( s^2 + 4s + 3 \) yields:

\[
F(s) = 2 + \frac{5s + 11}{(s+1)(s+3)}.
\]

Next, we decompose \( \frac{5s + 11}{(s+1)(s+3)} \) into partial fractions:

\[
\frac{5s + 11}{(s+1)(s+3)} = \frac{A}{s+1} + \frac{B}{s+3}.
\]

Solving for \( A \) and \( B \), we set:

\[
5s + 11 = A(s+3) + B(s+1).
\]

Expanding and equating coefficients:

- For \( s \): \( A + B = 5 \),
- For constants: \( 3A + B = 11 \).

Solving these equations gives \( A = 3 \) and \( B = 2 \). Thus, the partial fractions are:

\[
\frac{5s + 11}{(s+1)(s+3)} = \frac{3}{s+1} + \frac{2}{s+3}.
\]

Now, \( F(s) \) can be written as:

\[
F(s) = 2 + \frac{3}{s+1} + \frac{2}{s+3}.
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term:

- \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{2\} = 2\delta(t) \),
- \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{3}{s+1}\right\} = 3e^{-t}u(t) \),
- \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{2}{s+3}\right\} = 2e^{-3t}u(t) \).

Combining these, the time-domain function is:

\[
f(t) = 2\delta(t) + (3e^{-t} + 2e^{-3t})u(t).
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**B: \( 2\delta(t) + (3e^{-t} + 2e^{-3t})u(t) \).**

Answer: B
