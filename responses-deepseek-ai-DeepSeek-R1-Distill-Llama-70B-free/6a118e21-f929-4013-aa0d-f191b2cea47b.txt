Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of the global population that doesn't have access to safe drinking water as of 2019. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I remember that access to clean water has been improving over the years. Let me think about what I know.

I've heard that a significant portion of the world's population still lacks access, but I'm trying to recall if it's around 10% or 20%. Wait, I think it's somewhere in that range. Maybe I remember something about the Millennium Development Goals, which were set up by the United Nations. One of the goals was to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water, and I believe they achieved that, so that would have brought the number down.

So, if the original number was, say, around 40%, halving that would bring it to 20%. But wait, I think the actual numbers are a bit different. I remember reading that in 2015, when the MDGs ended, the access was around 90% globally, which would mean that 10% didn't have access. But wait, that seems low. Maybe I'm mixing up the exact statistics.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 20%. Let me think about more recent data. I've heard that in 2019, the World Health Organization or UNICEF reported that around 785 million people lacked access to basic drinking water services. If the global population is about 7.9 billion, then 785 million is roughly 10% of that. So that would mean 10% don't have access, so 90% do. But the question is asking about those who do not have access, so that would be 10%.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the data differentiates between basic access and safely managed services. Basic access might be from an improved source, but safely managed is a higher level. Maybe the 10% is for those without any access, but the number for those without safely managed might be higher. But the question is about "safe drinking water," so maybe it's the higher standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is around 20%. I'm not entirely sure. I think I've heard that around 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, but that's a different measure.

Wait, another approach: when I took a quiz on this before, I think the correct answer was around 10%, so option I:10%. But sometimes the numbers can vary based on the source. Alternatively, maybe it's 20%, which would be option D.

I'm a bit torn between 10% and 20%. Let me try to think of another angle. I remember that in 2019, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme reported that 9% of the global population lacked access to even basic drinking water services. So that's about 9%, which would round to 10%. So the correct answer would be I:10%.

As of 2019, about 10% of the global population does not have access to safe drinking water. This aligns with reports from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, which indicated that 9% lacked access to basic drinking water services.
