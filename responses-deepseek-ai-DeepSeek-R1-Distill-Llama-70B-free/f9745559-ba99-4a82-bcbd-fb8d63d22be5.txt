Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve: the limit as x approaches pi/2 of cos(x) times cos(tan(x)). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially involving trigonometric functions, it's important to consider what each part does as x approaches the specified value. So, let's break down the problem into two parts: cos(x) and cos(tan(x)).

As x approaches pi/2 from the left (since approaching from the right isn't defined for tan(x) because pi/2 is where tan goes to infinity), cos(x) behaves in a certain way. Cos(pi/2) is 0, right? So as x approaches pi/2, cos(x) approaches 0.

Now, the other part is cos(tan(x)). Let's think about tan(x) as x approaches pi/2. Tan(pi/2) is undefined and goes to positive infinity when approaching from the left. So, tan(x) is getting really large as x approaches pi/2. So, tan(x) approaches positive infinity.

So now, the second part becomes cos(tan(x)) which is cos(infinity). Wait, but cosine is a periodic function with period 2pi, so as the argument goes to infinity, cos oscillates between -1 and 1. So, cos(tan(x)) doesn't settle to a single value; instead, it oscillates rapidly as x approaches pi/2.

Putting it all together, the function we're taking the limit of is cos(x) multiplied by cos(tan(x)). Cos(x) is approaching 0, and cos(tan(x)) is oscillating between -1 and 1. So, it's like 0 multiplied by something that's oscillating but bounded. I remember that when you have a product where one factor goes to zero and the other is bounded, the product goes to zero. So, the limit should be zero.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there any chance that the oscillations could cause the limit not to exist? Because if cos(tan(x)) oscillates, maybe the product doesn't settle. But the other factor is going to zero, which would dampen the oscillations. So, even though cos(tan(x)) is oscillating, the amplitude is diminishing because cos(x) is going to zero. So, the overall product should approach zero.

Let me think of another approach to confirm. Maybe using substitution. Let’s set t = pi/2 - x. Then as x approaches pi/2 from the left, t approaches 0 from the positive side. So, cos(x) becomes cos(pi/2 - t) which is sin(t). And tan(x) is tan(pi/2 - t), which is cot(t). So, the expression becomes sin(t) * cos(cot(t)).

Now, sin(t) as t approaches 0 is approximately t. Cot(t) is cos(t)/sin(t), which as t approaches 0 becomes approximately 1/t, since cos(t) approaches 1 and sin(t) approaches t. So, cot(t) ≈ 1/t, which goes to infinity as t approaches 0 from the positive side.

So, cos(cot(t)) is cos(1/t). As t approaches 0, 1/t approaches infinity, so cos(1/t) oscillates between -1 and 1 just like before. So, the product is approximately t * cos(1/t). As t approaches 0, t goes to zero and cos(1/t) is bounded. So, the product goes to zero.

Therefore, the limit is zero. Looking at the options, option I is 0. So, the answer should be I.

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{x \to \pi/2} \cos(x)\cos(\tan(x))\), we analyze the behavior of each component as \(x\) approaches \(\pi/2\).

1. **Behavior of \(\cos(x)\):**  
   As \(x \to \pi/2\), \(\cos(x) \to 0\).

2. **Behavior of \(\cos(\tan(x))\):**  
   As \(x \to \pi/2\), \(\tan(x) \to +\infty\). Consequently, \(\cos(\tan(x))\) oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\) because cosine is a periodic function with period \(2\pi\), and its argument (\(\tan(x)\)) grows without bound.

3. **Combining the two parts:**  
   The function \(\cos(x)\cos(\tan(x))\) is the product of a term approaching \(0\) (\(\cos(x)\)) and a term that oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\) (\(\cos(\tan(x))\)). Since the oscillations are bounded, the product is dampened by the factor approaching \(0\), leading the entire expression to approach \(0\).

4. **Alternative confirmation:**  
   Using the substitution \(t = \pi/2 - x\), as \(x \to \pi/2\), \(t \to 0\). The expression becomes \(\sin(t)\cos(\cot(t))\). Here, \(\sin(t) \approx t \to 0\), and \(\cot(t) \approx 1/t \to \infty\). Thus, \(\cos(\cot(t)) = \cos(1/t)\) oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\), but the product \(t \cdot \cos(1/t)\) approaches \(0\) because \(t \to 0\).

Therefore, the limit is \(0\).
