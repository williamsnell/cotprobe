Okay, so I have this economics question about monetary policy, specifically open market operations and their effect on the money supply. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the reserve requirement is 10 percent. The Fed sells $29 million worth of government securities. I need to figure out how the money supply is affected. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different change.

Alright, let's break it down. Open market operations involve the Fed buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply. When the Fed sells securities, they're taking money out of the economy. So, if the Fed sells, the money supply should decrease, right? Because they're draining cash from the system.

Wait, but how exactly does this work? When the Fed sells securities, they're doing it to banks, I think. So the banks have to pay the Fed for those securities. That means the banks' reserves decrease. If the banks have less reserves, they can't lend as much, which reduces the money supply.

But the reserve requirement is 10 percent. I remember something about the money multiplier. Oh right, the money multiplier formula is 1 divided by the reserve requirement. So here, it's 1/0.10, which is 10. So any change in reserves can have a multiplied effect on the money supply.

Wait, but wait. When the Fed sells securities, the immediate effect is on bank reserves. So if they sell $29 million, the banks lose $29 million in reserves. But because of the reserve requirement, this can lead to a larger change in the money supply.

Oh, right! The change in reserves is the initial amount, but the total effect on the money supply is that initial change multiplied by the money multiplier. But wait, no—actually, the multiplier works when there's an increase in reserves leading to more loans and thus more money. But when reserves decrease, the effect is a contraction.

So if the Fed sells $29 million in securities, that's a decrease in bank reserves by $29 million. With a reserve requirement of 10%, the money multiplier is 10. So the money supply should decrease by $29 million multiplied by 10, which is $290 million.

Looking at the options, option F is a decrease of $2900 million, which seems too big. Option J is a decrease of $290 million. So that must be the correct one.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't get the direction wrong. Selling securities reduces reserves, which reduces the money supply. So the money supply should decrease, not increase. So options E, H, I are increases, so they're out.

Options A, C, F, G, J are decreases. A is $29 million, which is just the initial amount without considering the multiplier. C is $2.9 million, which seems like 1% of 29. F is $2900 million, which is 29 times 100—maybe if the reserve requirement was 1%, but here it's 10%, so the multiplier is 10. So 29 * 10 is 290 million. So J is correct.

Wait, but is the money multiplier applied correctly? Let me think again. The formula for the money supply change is change in reserves divided by the reserve requirement. So if reserves decrease by 29 million, the potential change is 29 million / 0.10 = 290 million decrease in money supply. Yes, that matches option J.

When the Federal Reserve sells $29 million worth of government securities in an open market operation, it reduces the banks' reserves by $29 million. With a reserve requirement of 10%, the money multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{\text{reserve requirement}} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \). This means the reduction in reserves will lead to a proportional decrease in the money supply.

The total decrease in the money supply is the change in reserves multiplied by the money multiplier:  
\[
\text{Change in money supply} = \$29 \text{ million} \times 10 = \$290 \text{ million}.
\]

Analyzing the options:
- **A, C, F, G**: These options do not account for the money multiplier and are therefore incorrect.
- **E, H, I**: These options suggest an increase in the money supply, which contradicts the effect of the Fed selling securities.
- **J**: This option correctly reflects a decrease of $290 million in the money supply.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**.

Answer: J
