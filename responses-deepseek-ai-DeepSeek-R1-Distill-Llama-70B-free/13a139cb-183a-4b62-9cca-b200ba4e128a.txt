Okay, so I've got this question about cognitive biases, and I'm a bit new to this topic. The question is asking about the term for a 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making. The options are from A to J, each representing a different bias.

Hmm, I remember that in psychology, especially in the realm of decision-making, there's something called heuristics. Heuristics are like mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that people use to make decisions more quickly and efficiently. They help simplify complex situations but can sometimes lead to errors or biases.

Wait, but the options include 'Heuristics' as option J. So the question is asking for the term that refers to these rules of thumb. But I also recall that sometimes specific biases are types of heuristics. Like, for example, the availability bias (option B) is a heuristic where people judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. Similarly, anchoring bias (option I) is another heuristic where the first piece of information heavily influences subsequent decisions.

But the question is about the general term for the 'rule of thumb' approach. So heuristics would be the overarching concept, while the other options like availability bias or representativeness bias are specific instances. So the correct answer should be J: Heuristics.

Wait, but I should double-check. The question is phrased as "the 'rule of thumb' type of bias." So it's specifically about the bias that's a rule of thumb. Or is it the general term for using such rules, which can lead to various biases.

Wait, no. The term heuristics itself refers to the strategies or mental shortcuts. The biases are the errors that result from applying these heuristics. So maybe the answer isn't J, but one of the specific biases. But the question is phrased as the term for the rule of thumb bias. So perhaps it's heuristics because that's the term for the shortcuts, which cause biases.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is J because heuristics are the rules of thumb. So the question is asking for the term, and heuristics is the correct term. So the answer should be J.

The term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making is heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making processes but can lead to biases.

Answer: J
