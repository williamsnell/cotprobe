Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the correct order from greatest to least of these numbers: 3, 3 and 1 over 8, 3.8, 3.18. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. 

First, I need to understand what each of these numbers represents. I know that "3 and 1 over 8" is a mixed number. So I should convert that into a decimal to make it easier to compare with the others.

Wait, wait, how do I convert a mixed number to a decimal? Oh right, I need to divide the fractional part by the denominator. So for 1 over 8, I'll divide 1 by 8. Let me do that: 1 ÷ 8 is 0.125. So 3 and 1/8 is 3 + 0.125, which equals 3.125. Got it. So now I have all the numbers in decimal form except for the plain 3, which is just 3.0.

So now the numbers are: 3.0, 3.125, 3.8, and 3.18. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, the numbers given are 3, 3 1/8, 3.8, 3.18. So in decimal, that's 3.0, 3.125, 3.8, and 3.18.

Now I need to arrange them from greatest to least. Let me list them out in decimal form for clarity:

- 3.0
- 3.125
- 3.8
- 3.18

Wait, no, wait a second. I think I messed up. Because the numbers are: 3, 3 1/8, 3.8, 3.18. So let's list all four correctly:

1. 3 → 3.0
2. 3 1/8 → 3.125
3. 3.8 → 3.8
4. 3.18 → 3.18

Wait, so I have four numbers to compare. Let me make sure I wrote them all correctly. So the numbers are 3.0, 3.125, 3.8, and 3.18.

Now, to order them from greatest to least. So the largest number is the highest value, and the smallest is the lowest.

Let me line them up:

- 3.8 is the highest because 8 is in the tenths place, which is higher than the others. Next, looking at the others, 3.18 is next because 1 is in the tenths place, but the hundredths is 8. So 3.18 is 3.18.

Then comes 3.125, which is 3 and 1/8. Wait, but 3.125 is higher than 3.18? No, wait, 3.125 is 3.125, and 3.18 is 3.18. Let me compare them: 3.125 vs 3.18. 

Wait, 3.18 is larger than 3.125 because 0.18 is more than 0.125. Oh wait, no, wait. 3.18 is 3 and 18 hundredths, which is 3.18. 3.125 is 3.125, which is less than 3.18. So 3.18 is larger than 3.125.

Wait, that can't be right because 3.125 is 3 and an eighth, which is 3.125, and 3.18 is higher. So when I order them, 3.8 is the largest, then 3.18, then 3.125, then 3.0.

Wait no, wait a second. Wait, 3.8 is higher than 3.18, yes, because 0.8 is bigger than 0.18. So 3.8 is first. Then, between 3.18 and 3.125, which is bigger? Let me subtract: 3.18 - 3.125 = 0.055. So 3.18 is 0.055 larger than 3.125. So 3.18 is next after 3.8, then comes 3.125, and then 3.0.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me line them up:

3.8 is the largest. Then, between 3.18 and 3.125, 3.18 is bigger. So next is 3.18, then 3.125, then 3.0.

Wait, but I thought 3.125 is 3 and 1/8, which is 3.125, and 3.18 is 3.18, which is bigger. So the order from greatest to least is: 3.8, 3.18, 3.125, 3.0.

Wait, but wait, the initial numbers presented in the problem are 3, 3 1/8, 3.8, 3.18. So in the options, they are presented as 3, 3 and 1 over 8, 3.8, 3.18.

So the order is 3.8 (greatest), then 3.18, then 3 1/8 (3.125), then 3.0 (just 3).

Wait, but let me think again. Because in the options, the way the numbers are presented varies.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3.8, 3 1/8, 3.18, 3.

Option B: 3.18, 3.8, 3, 3 1/8.

Option C: 3, 3.8, 3 1/8, 3.18.

Option D: 3.18, 3 1/8, 3, 3.8.

Option E: 3.8, 3.18, 3 1/8, 3.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up some earlier. Let me re-express the numbers correctly.

So the numbers to order are:

- 3 → 3.0

- 3 1/8 → 3.125

- 3.8 → 3.8

- 3.18 → 3.18

So the correct order from greatest to least is:

1. 3.8

2. 3.18

3. 3.125 (which is 3 1/8)

4. 3.0 (which is 3)

So the order is 3.8 > 3.18 > 3.125 > 3.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option lists them in this order.

Looking at option E: 3.8, 3.18, 3 1/8, 3.

Which is exactly the order I have. So option E would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check all the options to make sure.

Option A: 3.8, 3 1/8, 3.18, 3 → No, because 3 1/8 comes before 3.18, which is incorrect.

Option B: 3.18, 3.8, 3, 3 1/8 → No, 3.18 is less than 3.8.

Option C: 3, 3.8, 3 1/8, 3.18 → No, starts with 3 which is the smallest.

Option D: 3.18, 3 1/8, 3, 3.8 → No, 3.18 is less than 3.8.

Option E: 3.8, 3.18, 3 1/8, 3 → Yes, this is correct.

Option F: 3 1/8, 3.8, 3.18, 3 → No, starts with 3 1/8 which is not the largest.

Option G: 3, 3 1/8, 3.18, 3.8 → No, starts with 3 which is smallest.

Option H: 3.18, 3 1/8, 3.8, 3 → No, 3.18 is less than 3.8.

Option I: 3 1/8, 3, 3.8, 3.18 → No.

Option J: 3, 3.18, 3.8, 3 1/8 → No.

So the correct option is E. So the answer is E.

The numbers to order from greatest to least are: 3, 3 and 1 over 8, 3.8, and 3.18. Converting "3 and 1 over 8" to a decimal gives 3.125. Thus, the numbers in decimal form are:

- 3 → 3.0  
- 3 and 1 over 8 → 3.125  
- 3.8 → 3.8  
- 3.18 → 3.18  

Arranging these from greatest to least:  
1. **3.8** (largest)  
2. **3.18**  
3. **3.125** (3 and 1 over 8)  
4. **3.0** (smallest)  

The correct order is: **3.8, 3.18, 3 and 1 over 8, 3**.  

Among the options, **Option E** matches this order.  

Answer: E
