Okay, so I've got this question about Carruther's view on the justification for moral criticism when it comes to how we treat animals. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with Carruther's specific arguments, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking where the justification comes from. The options are A through H, each giving a different reason. Let me go through each one.

Option A: The animal's lifespan. I'm not sure how lifespan would directly relate to moral criticism. Maybe if an action shortens their life, but that seems more about consequences than the justification itself.

Option B: Direct moral standing. This sounds like the idea that animals have inherent value and rights, so our actions towards them are judged based on their moral status. I've heard of moral standing before, like animals being ends in themselves.

Option C: Societal norms. That would mean it's about what society thinks is right or wrong. But the question is about Carruther's view, which I think is more about the moral agent's character rather than society's norms.

Option D: Role in the ecosystem. This seems more environmental or ecological. While important, I don't think it's the direct justification Carruther is pointing at for moral criticism.

Option E: Inability to defend themselves. That might relate to vulnerability, but again, I think Carruther's focus is elsewhere, perhaps on the moral character of the actor.

Option F: Bad qualities of character. Oh wait, this rings a bell. I remember something about virtue ethics, where actions reflect the character of the person. So if we treat animals poorly, it shows bad character traits like cruelty or indifference. That sounds like it could be Carruther's point.

Option G: Intelligence level. Some people argue that moral consideration is based on intelligence, but I'm not sure if that's Carruther's angle. Plus, the question is about justification for criticism, not necessarily the capacity for rights.

Option H: Capacity for emotion. Animals feeling emotions is a big point in animal ethics, like sentient beings deserving consideration. But again, I think Carruther is more focused on the moral character aspect.

Putting it together, Carruther's view probably centers on the idea that when we treat animals poorly, it reflects badly on our characterâ€”showing traits like cruelty or disregard. So the justification for moral criticism is based on the bad qualities our actions reveal about us. That would make option F the correct answer.

In Carruther's view, the justification for moral criticism when it comes to how we treat animals is rooted in the qualities of character that our actions reveal. Specifically, treating animals poorly reflects negatively on our moral character, evincing traits such as cruelty or indifference. This aligns with a virtue ethics perspective, where the focus is on the moral agent's character rather than the animal's inherent rights, societal norms, or other factors. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: the bad qualities of character that our actions evince.

Answer: F
