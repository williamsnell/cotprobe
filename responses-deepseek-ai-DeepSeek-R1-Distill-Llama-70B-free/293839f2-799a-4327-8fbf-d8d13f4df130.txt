Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about using Gauss's Law to find the force on a mass placed at certain depths within the Earth. Hmm, I remember that Gauss's Law is related to electric fields, but wait, I think the same principle applies to gravitational fields too. Oh right, Gauss's Law for gravity says that the gravitational flux through a closed surface is proportional to the mass enclosed by that surface.

The problem states that the Earth has a constant density. So I can model the Earth as a sphere with uniform density. The question asks for the force on a 1 kg mass at two depths: one-quarter the Earth's radius and half the Earth's radius. 

Wait, how do I approach this? I think I should recall the concept of the gravitational field inside a spherical shell. From what I remember, the gravitational force inside a uniform sphere depends only on the mass that's inside the radius where the object is located. So any mass outside the radius doesn't contribute to the force. That makes sense because of Newton's shell theorem. So the force at a depth d would be due to the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius (R - d), where R is the Earth's radius.

Wait, but the problem says "a deep hole in the earth". So when the object is placed at depth h, the distance from the center of the Earth is R - h. But wait, in the problem, the depths are given as fractions of the Earth's radius. So for the first case, the depth is 1/4 R, meaning the object is at a distance of R - (R/4) = 3R/4 from the center. Similarly, the second case is at R/2 depth, so the object is at R - R/2 = R/2 from the center.

But wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, if the depth is the distance from the surface, then the radius from the center would be R minus the depth. So in the first case, depth is R/4, so the radius is R - (R/4) = 3R/4. But wait, no, no. Wait, if the Earth's radius is R, then a hole of depth h would mean the object is at a distance R - h from the center. So yes, if h is R/4, then the object is at 3R/4 from the center. Similarly, for h=R/2, the object is at R/2 from the center.

Wait, but that depends on how the depth is defined. Oh, I think the problem says "depth of 1/4 of the radius of the earth". So it's h = R/4. So yeah, the object is at R - h = R - R/4 = 3R/4 from the center. Similarly for the other case.

Now, I need to compute the gravitational force on the 1 kg mass due to the Earth's mass enclosed within that radius. 

First, I'll need the formula for gravitational force inside a uniform sphere. The gravitational acceleration g' at a distance r from the center is given by g' = G * M_enclosed / r^2, where M_enclosed is the mass enclosed within radius r.

Since the density ρ is constant, the mass enclosed M_enclosed = (4/3) π r^3 ρ. But the total mass of the Earth is M = (4/3) π R^3 ρ. So M_enclosed = M * (r^3 / R^3).

So substituting, g' = G * (M * (r^3 / R^3)) ) / r^2 = G M (r) / R^3.

Alternatively, I can write it as g' = (G M / R^3) * r.

But wait, I remember another approach. The gravitational acceleration inside the Earth at radius r is g' = (G M r) / R^3. Because if r is less than R, then only a fraction of the Earth's mass contributes, scaled by the cube of (r/R).

So, the force F on the mass m would be F = m g' = m (G M r) / R^3.

But wait, that's for r being the distance from the center. So in our problem, for each depth h, r = R - h.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. When the object is at a depth h, the distance from the center is R - h. So in the first case, h = R/4, so r = R - R/4 = 3R/4. Second case, h = R/2, so r = R - R/2 = R/2.

So substituting r into the formula for F.

Let's compute each case.

But I also need to remember that at the Earth's surface, the gravitational acceleration is g = G M / R². So that's the familiar 9.81 m/s².

So perhaps it's easier to express F in terms of g.

Let me think. Let's express F as m * g' where g' is the acceleration at the depth.

So for the first case, r = 3R/4.

So g' = (G M (3R/4)) / R^3 = (G M) (3)/(4 R²) ) = (3/4) * (G M / R² ) = (3/4) g.

Wait, no, because (G M / R²) is g. So g' = (3/4) g. So the acceleration is (3/4)g, so the force F = m * (3/4) g. For m=1 kg, F = (3/4)*9.81 N.

3/4 of 9.81 is 7.3575 N. Wait, but I'm looking at the options, and option D is 7.35 N for the first case. Wait, but let me check the second case.

Wait, for the second case, r = R/2.

So g' = (G M (R/2)) / R^3 = (G M) (1)/(2 R²) )= (1/2) * (G M / R²) = (1/2) g.

So F = m*(1/2)g = (1/2)*9.81 = 4.905 N.

Looking at the options, let's see which one has first value around 7.35 N and second around 4.9 N.

Looking at options:

Option D: 7.35 N, 4.9 N.

Option F: 7.85, 5.1.

Option H: 6.00, 4.00.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because I'm assuming that the Earth's density is constant, and using the formula for the gravitational acceleration inside a uniform sphere, which is g' = (G M r)/R³.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the mass enclosed. Let me try that.

Total mass of Earth, M = (4/3) π R³ ρ.

Mass enclosed within radius r is M' = (4/3) π r³ ρ.

So M' = M (r³/R³).

Then, the gravitational force F = G (M') (m) / r².

Substituting M':

F = G (M (r³/R³)) m / r² = G M m r / R³.

Which is the same as before.

So F = m g (r/(R)).

Wait, because g = G M / R², substituting:

F = m (G M / R²) * (r/R) ) = m g (r/R).

Wait, no: Let me recheck.

Wait, F = G M' m / r².

M' = (r³/R³) M.

So F = G (r³ M / R³) * m / r² = G M m r / R³.

But G M / R² is g, so F = (g m r) / R.

Thus, F = m g (r/R).

So when r = (3R/4):

F = m g (3/4) = (1 kg)(9.81)(3/4) = 9.81 * 0.75 = 7.3575 N.

Similarly, for r = R/2:

F = m g (1/2) = 9.81 * 0.5 = 4.905 N.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So the first force is approximately 7.36 N, the second 4.905 N.

Looking at the options, option D is 7.35 N and 4.9 N.

So the correct answer is D.

To solve the problem, we use Gauss's Law for gravity, which states that the gravitational force inside a uniform sphere depends only on the mass enclosed within the radius at which the object is located. The Earth is modeled as a sphere with constant density, and the force on a 1 kg mass at a depth \( h \) is due to the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius \( r = R - h \), where \( R \) is the Earth's radius.

The gravitational acceleration at a distance \( r \) from the center of the Earth is given by:

\[
g' = \frac{G M r}{R^3}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the Earth's total mass, and \( R \) is the Earth's radius. The total mass of the Earth is \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho \), and the enclosed mass is proportional to \( r^3 \). Substituting \( g = \frac{G M}{R^2} \) (the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface), the force on the 1 kg mass becomes:

\[
F = m g' = m \frac{g r}{R}
\]

### Case 1: Depth \( h = \frac{R}{4} \)
At this depth, the object is at a distance \( r = R - h = \frac{3R}{4} \) from the center. Substituting \( r = \frac{3R}{4} \) into the formula for \( F \):

\[
F = m \frac{g \cdot \frac{3R}{4}}{R} = m \frac{3g}{4}
\]

For \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \) and \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):

\[
F = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 9.81 = 7.3575 \, \text{N}
\]

### Case 2: Depth \( h = \frac{R}{2} \)
At this depth, the object is at a distance \( r = R - h = \frac{R}{2} \) from the center. Substituting \( r = \frac{R}{2} \) into the formula for \( F \):

\[
F = m \frac{g \cdot \frac{R}{2}}{R} = m \frac{g}{2}
\]

For \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \) and \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):

\[
F = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.81 = 4.905 \, \text{N}
\]

### Final Answer
The forces at the two depths are approximately \( 7.35 \, \text{N} \) and \( 4.9 \, \text{N} \), which correspond to **Option D**.
