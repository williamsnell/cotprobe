Okay, so I've got this question about institutionalists in the early twentieth century and why they rejected laissez-faire. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that laissez-faire is an economic theory that says the government shouldn't interfere in the economy. So, businesses and markets should be free to operate without much regulation. But why would someone reject that?

Institutionalists, if I recall, were a group of economists who believed that economic systems are shaped by social and institutional factors, not just market forces. They were critical of the classical approach, which laissez-faire is a part of. So they probably saw problems with letting the market run completely on its own.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: They thought government intervention would reduce economic freedom. Wait, but if they rejected laissez-faire, maybe they wanted more government intervention, so this might not be the reason. Or perhaps they saw that without intervention, things weren't working. Not sure yet.

Option B: They thought laissez-faire ensured equitable wealth distribution. That doesn't sound right. Laissez-faire is more about minimal government, which can lead to more inequality since there's no regulation to check things like monopolies or unfair labor practices. So the institutionalists probably didn't think it was equitable.

Option C: They were disturbed by widespread poverty and business cycle fluctuations. That sounds plausible. The early 20th century had a lot of economic issues, like the Great Depression maybe? Or earlier cycles. If the business was fluctuating a lot and there was poverty, the institutionalists would argue that laissez-faire isn't working because it's leading to instability and inequality.

Option D: They thought laissez-faire would lead to more efficient and ethical business practices. No, that doesn't make sense. Without regulations, businesses might engage in unethical practices. So institutionalists probably rejected laissez-faire because they believed it didn't promote ethics or efficiency in reality.

Option E: They favored socialism. I'm not sure. Institutionalism isn't the same as socialism. They might have wanted some government intervention, but not necessarily complete state control.

Option F: They believed in supply and demand. That's more of a classical economics view. They probably didn't reject laissez-faire for that reason.

Option G: They were satisfied with the economy. No, because they were rejecting laissez-faire, implying they were dissatisfied.

Option H: They thought laissez-faire would prevent crises. That's the opposite. If they were against it, maybe because they saw that it didn't prevent crises.

Option I: They felt laissez-faire would eliminate corruption and monopolies. That doesn't seem right. Without regulation, monopolies can form more easily, so rejecting laissez-faire would be because it doesn't stop that.

Option J: They wanted complete government control. I don't think so. Institutionalists probably wanted more regulation but not total control.

So, narrowing it down, option C seems the best. They saw that with laissez-faire, there was a lot of poverty and the economy was unstable, like boom and bust cycles. That would make sense why they rejected itâ€”because it wasn't working as advertised.

The institutionalists of the early twentieth century rejected laissez-faire because they were disturbed by widespread poverty and the fluctuations of the business cycle. They recognized that unregulated markets led to economic instability and inequality, which laissez-faire failed to address.
