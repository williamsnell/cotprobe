Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I need to find the mass flow rate of steam condensing per unit length of a pipe. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the setup: Steam is condensing on the outside of a pipe, and there's cool water flowing inside. The bulk mean water temperature is 65°F. The water side coefficient is 300 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. Steam is at 3 in. Hg abs., and the steam side coefficient is 1500 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. The pipe is ¾ inch 18-gage standard size made of brass, with thermal conductivity 66 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

Wait, I remember that when a fluid condenses on a surface, we can model the heat transfer. The overall heat transfer coefficient (U) is important here. Since the pipe is cylindrical, I think I need to calculate the overall U considering the inside and outside coefficients and the pipe's thermal resistance.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Water side (inside): h_w = 300 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F)
- Steam side (outside): h_s = 1500 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F)
- Thermal conductivity of brass, k = 66 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)
- Pipe: 3/4 in., 18-gage standard. I need to find the outer diameter and the thickness perhaps.

Wait, I think the 18-gage refers to the wall thickness. What's the outside diameter for a 3/4" 18-gage pipe? Oh right, I might need to look up the pipe dimensions. Alternatively, I can calculate the outside radius, inside radius, and the thickness.

Wait, the problem says it's a standard pipe. For a ¾ inch nominal pipe size, 18-gage, the outside diameter is probably 0.875 inches, but wait, gages can be confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should just note that the wall thickness is given as 18-gage, but perhaps it's better to find the exact dimensions.

Wait, maybe I can use the standard pipe dimensions. For a 3/4" pipe, 18 BWG (which I think is the same as gage?), the outside diameter might be 1.05 inches, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the inside diameter is 0.785 inches for ¾” 18-gage? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can use the formula without needing the exact diameter, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient for a pipe is:

1/U = (1/h_w * A_w) + (ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πkL)) ) + (1/h_s * A_s)

Wait, but since we're dealing per unit length, L=1 ft, so that might simplify things. Also, since it's a pipe, A_w and A_s might be the areas for the inside and outside surfaces. Wait, no, actually, in the formula, the overall U is based on a specific area, perhaps the outside area or the inside. Wait, I think the standard formula is:

1/U = (1/(h_w * A_i)) + (ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πkL)) + (1/(h_s * A_o)) )

Wait, no, perhaps that's not right. Let me think again. The overall heat transfer coefficient U is based on the outside area, I think. Or perhaps the inside. I think the formula is:

1/U_o = (1/h_w) * (A_o/A_i) + (ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πkL)) + (1/h_s)

Wait, no, maybe it's:

1/U = (1/h_w) + (D_o ln(D_o/D_i))/(2k) * (1/D_o) ) + (1/h_s) ) * D_o/(D_i)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to write the formula correctly.

The overall heat transfer coefficient U for a cylindrical pipe can be calculated considering the thermal resistances in series. The resistances are:

- Convection resistance on the inside: R1 = 1/(h_w * A_i)
- Conductive resistance through the pipe wall: R2 = ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πkL)
- Convection resistance on the outside: R3 = 1/(h_s * A_o)

But the overall U is based on a reference area. If we take the outside area as the reference, then:

U_o = 1 / [ (1/(h_w * A_i)) + (ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πkL)) * (A_o/A_i) ) + (1/(h_s * A_o)) ) ]

Wait, I'm not confident about this. Maybe a better approach is to compute the overall U based on the inside area, then adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the overall U as:

1/U = (1/h_w) + (D_i * ln(D_o/D_i))/(2k) ) + (D_i/(h_s D_o)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the thermal resistances. For a unit length pipe, the total thermal resistance R_total is the sum of the three resistances: inside convection, conduction, and outside convection.

Each resistance can be expressed as:

R1 = 1/(h_w * A_inside)
R2 = ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πk * L)
R3 = 1/(h_s * A_outside)

But since L is per unit length, L=1 ft. So R2 = ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πk)

Wait, A_inside is the inside surface area per unit length. For a pipe, the surface area is circumference times length, so A = 2πr * L. So per unit length, A_inside = 2π r_i, and A_outside = 2π r_o.

But perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of diameters. Let me denote D_i as the inside diameter, D_o as the outside diameter.

So, the conduction resistance R2 is (ln(D_o/D_i))/(2πk * L). But for L=1, R2 is (ln(D_o/D_i))/(2πk).

Wait, but perhaps in terms of unit length, the areas can be considered as per foot, so A_inside = π D_i * 1 ft = π D_i ft², and similarly for A_outside.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed step by step.

First, I need to find the overall heat transfer coefficient U. Then, find the heat flux, and from that, the mass flow rate.

Wait, the heat transfer rate Q is given by Q = U * A * ΔT, where ΔT is the temperature difference. But in this case, the steam is condensing, so the temperature on the steam side is the saturation temperature at 3 in Hg abs.

Wait, I think I need to find the saturation temperature of steam at 3 in Hg absolute. Let me recall that at standard atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi), the boiling point is 212°F. But 3 in Hg is below that. Wait, wait, 3 in Hg absolute is the pressure. So how to find the saturation temperature for that.

Wait, 3 in Hg absolute is 3 inches of mercury. To find the saturation temperature, I think I can refer to the steam tables, but since I don't have them here, perhaps I can remember that around 3 in Hg, steam saturation is about 140°F? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, 1 atmosphere is about 29.92 in Hg. So 3 in Hg is about 0.1 atm. At 0.1 atm, the saturation temperature is around 45°C, which is about 113°F. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 3 in Hg absolute is 3/29.92 atm ≈ 0.1003 atm. So the saturation temperature is about 45°C, which is 113°F.

Wait, but the water inside is at 65°F. So the steam at 113°F is condensing on the outside, and the water is 65°F inside. So the temperature difference is 113 - 65 = 48°F. Wait, no, wait. When a fluid is condensing, the heat is transferred from the steam to the water. So the saturation temperature is higher than the water, so the ΔT would be T_sat - T_water. So ΔT = 113 -65=48°F.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have miscalculated the saturation temperature. Let me think again. At 1 in Hg, I think the saturation temperature is around 80°F. So 3 in Hg would be higher than that. Wait, perhaps I can look up a more accurate value. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the assumption that T_sat is 140°F? Or maybe 135°F? Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with the value I have, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps using 140°F for the saturation temperature. So T_sat = 140°F, T_water =65°F → ΔT=75°F. Alternatively, if I'm wrong, it might affect the answer. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. I might have to be precise. Let me recall that at 3 in Hg absolute, which is about 4.5 psia (since 1 psi ≈ 2.0366 in Hg), so 3 in Hg is about 1.47 psia. Checking a steam table, at 1.47 psia, the saturation temperature is about 102.5°F. So perhaps ΔT = 102.5 -65=37.5°F.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that T_sat is 140°F, but I think 102.5°F is more accurate. So I'll proceed with that.

Now, back to calculating the overall U.

First, I need the inside and outside diameters of the pipe. The pipe is 3/4 inch nominal, 18-gage. Gage 18 is a wall thickness. The standard pipe dimensions for a ¾” nominal pipe, 18 BWG (which is the same as 18 gage), would have an outside diameter of 1.05 inches and an inside diameter of 0.87 inches. Wait, no, let me think. Wait, 18 BWG is for tubing, perhaps. For steel pipes, the 18 gage might have a different thickness.

Wait, perhaps an 18-gage pipe has a thickness of 0.049 inches. So the outside diameter for a 3/4” pipe would be 0.875 inches, and the inside diameter would be 0.875 - 2*(0.049) = 0.875 - 0.098 = 0.777 inches.

Wait, wait, 3/4” pipe's nominal OD is 0.875 inches. So with a wall thickness of 0.049 inches (gage 18), the inside diameter would be 0.875 - 2*(0.049) = 0.777 inches.

So D_i = 0.777 inches, D_o = 0.875 inches.

But wait, this is in inches. I'll need to convert to feet because the units are in feet.

D_i = 0.777 /12 = 0.06475 ft.

D_o = 0.875 /12 ≈ 0.07292 ft.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the radius is easier. Let me calculate the radii.

r_i = D_i / 2 = 0.777/(2*12) = 0.03229 ft.

r_o = D_o /2 = 0.875/(2*12) = 0.03646 ft.

Wait, perhaps it's better to work in inches for the diameters and then convert to feet when needed.

Now, the thermal conductivity k is 66 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

The water side coefficient h_w is 300, steam side h_s is 1500.

Now, the overall U is calculated based on the outside surface area.

Wait, the formula for the overall U based on the outside area is:

1/U_o = (r_o / h_w) * (1/r_i) + (r_o * ln(r_o/r_i))/k + (r_o / h_s) * (1/r_o)

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct way. Alternatively, the thermal resistances per unit length would be:

R_conv_inside = 1/(h_w * 2π r_i * L)
R_cond = ln(r_o/r_i)/(2πk L)
R_conv_outside = 1/(h_s * 2π r_o * L)

Since L is 1 foot, we can ignore L in denominators.

So R_total = R_conv_inside + R_cond + R_conv_outside.

Wait, no, because each R is per unit length. So R_total would be the sum of the three.

So,

R_total = (1/(h_w * 2π r_i)) + (ln(r_o/r_i)/(2πk)) + (1/(h_s * 2π r_o)) )

But wait, the units here: h has units of Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), r_i and r_o are in feet. Let me check the units.

Yes, h_w is Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), so 1/h_w has units of hr·ft²·°F/Btu.

r_i is in feet, so 2π r_i is circumference in feet, so the area is 2π r_i * L (length), which is in ft². Since L=1, the area is 2π r_i ft².

So R_conv_inside is 1/(h_w * 2π r_i) → units: (hr·ft²·°F/Btu) / (ft²) ) = (hr·°F/Btu). Similarly for R_conv_outside.

R_cond is (ln(r_o/r_i))/(2πk) → units: (unitless)/(Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) → (hr·ft·°F)/(Btu). Wait, no, 2πk has units Btu/(hr·ft·°F), so 1/(2πk) has units hr·ft·°F/Btu. When multiplied by ln(r_o/r_i), which is unitless, the result is hr·ft·°F/Btu.

Wait, but the sum of R_conv_inside (unit hr·°F/Btu) and R_cond (unit hr·ft·°F/Btu) doesn't seem to add up because their units are different. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, R_cond is (ln(D_o/D_i))/(2πk * L). But since L is 1, it's ln(D_o/D_i)/(2πk). Now, the units of 2πk is Btu/(hr·ft·°F), so the denominator is Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So R_cond has units of (unitless) * (hr·ft·°F)/Btu → (hr·ft·°F)/Btu.

Wait, but R_conv_inside is 1/(h_w * 2π r_i). h_w is Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), 2π r_i is ft, so the denominator is Btu/(hr·ft²·°F) * ft → Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So 1/(h_w * 2π r_i) has units (hr·ft·°F)/Btu.

Similarly, R_conv_outside is 1/(h_s * 2π r_o) → (hr·ft·°F)/Btu.

So all three resistances have the same units, so they can be summed.

So R_total = [1/(h_w * 2π r_i)] + [ln(r_o/r_i)/(2πk)] + [1/(h_s * 2π r_o)]

Then, the overall heat transfer coefficient U is 1/R_total, but I think it's based on the outside area. Wait, no, U is defined such that Q = U * A * ΔT, where A is the area. So if we're using R_total, which is based on the outside area, then U would be based on the outside area.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute U based on the outside area, so:

1/U_o = (r_o / r_i) * (1/(h_w)) + (r_o * ln(r_o/r_i))/k + (1/h_s)

Wait, that might be another way to express U_o.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for U based on the outside surface is:

1/U_o = (1/h_w) * (A_o/A_i) + (ln(D_o/D_i)/(2k)) * (D_o/D_i) ) + (1/h_s)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to find a standard formula.

Upon recalling, the overall heat transfer coefficient U for a pipe, based on the outside area, is given by:

1/U_o = (r_o / h_w) * (1/r_i) + (r_o ln(r_o/r_i))/k + (1/h_s)

Wait, that might make sense. Let me see:

Each term is a resistance per unit area.

So, the inside convection resistance per unit outside area is (r_o / r_i) * (1/h_w), because the area inside is smaller than the outside, so the resistance increases.

The conduction term is (r_o ln(r_o/r_i))/k.

The outside convection resistance is 1/h_s.

So putting it all together:

1/U_o = (r_o/(h_w r_i)) + (r_o ln(r_o/r_i))/k + 1/h_s

Yes, this makes sense. Because each term is a resistance per unit outside area.

So let me plug in the numbers.

Compute each term:

Term1: r_o/(h_w r_i)
r_o = 0.03646 ft
r_i = 0.03229 ft
h_w = 300 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F)
So Term1 = (0.03646) / (300 * 0.03229) → calculate denominator: 300 * 0.03229 ≈ 9.687 → Term1 ≈ 0.03646 / 9.687 ≈ 0.003767 hr·°F/Btu

Term2: (r_o ln(r_o/r_i))/k
r_o = 0.03646 ft
r_i = 0.03229 ft
r_o/r_i ≈ 1.1308
ln(1.1308
