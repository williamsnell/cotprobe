Okay, so I've got this question about Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), and I need to figure out which statement is true. Hmm, I remember RPCs are a way for a program to execute a procedure on a different computer or server. But wait, what exactly do they do?

The question gives four options, A to D. Let me go through each one.

Option A: It is used to call procedures with addresses that are farther than 2^16 bytes away. Wait, 2^16 is 65536, so that's 64KB. I'm trying to remember if RPCs are specifically about distance in memory. No, I think RPCs are more about remote execution over a network, not about the memory address space. So this might be referring to something else, maybe local procedure calls or something about memory addressing. So probably A is not correct.

Option B: It cannot return a value. That doesn't sound right. I remember that functions can return values, and RPCs should be able to do that too. Like, when you call a remote function, it processes something and sends back a result. So B is probably false.

Option C: It cannot pass parameters by reference. Wait, parameters by reference... in RPC, when you pass data, how is it handled? I think RPC uses something like serialization or marshaling to send data over the network. So, when you pass by reference, the actual data is copied and sent, not the actual memory reference. Because the remote system can't access your local memory addresses. So maybe RPC can't pass by reference because it would require the same memory space, which isn't the case in a remote call. So C might be correct.

Option D: It cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. Hmm, I think RPC can handle different languages as long as there's a way to serialize the data. Like, using something like XML or JSON, or maybe with tools like thrift or gRPC which support multiple languages. So if a client is in Python and the server is in Java, as long as they agree on the RPC protocol, it should work. So D is probably false.

Wait, but let me think again about option C. If the RPC is designed to send the actual value, then passing by reference wouldn't make sense because the remote system doesn't have access to your local memory. So when you pass a parameter by reference, the RPC system would have to send the value instead. So in that case, you can't truly pass by reference. So option C says it cannot pass parameters by reference, which would be true.

So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C. Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) cannot pass parameters by reference because the remote system cannot access the local memory addresses of the caller. Instead, parameters are typically serialized and sent as values. 

Answer: C
