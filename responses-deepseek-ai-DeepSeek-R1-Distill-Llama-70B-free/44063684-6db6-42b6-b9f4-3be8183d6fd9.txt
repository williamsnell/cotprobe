Okay, so I have this question about Euler's Totient Function, phi(n), and I need to find phi(29791). The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Euler's Totient Function phi(n) counts the number of integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. So, phi(n) is the count of numbers less than n that don't share any common factors with n except 1.

But to compute phi(n), especially for a number like 29791, I think the best approach is to factorize n into its prime factors. Because once I have the prime factors, I can apply the formula for phi.

So, the formula for Euler's totient function when n is the product of prime powers is phi(n) = n * product (1 - 1/p) for each distinct prime p dividing n.

Wait, so first I need to factorize 29791 into its prime factors. Let's see, 29791 is the number in question. I'm not sure what it factors into off the top of my head, so I'll have to try dividing by some primes.

Let me start by checking if 29791 is divisible by small primes. Let's see:

Is it even? 29791 ends with a 1, so no, it's not divisible by 2.

Sum of digits: 2+9+7+9+1 = 28. 28 isn't divisible by 3, so 3 doesn't divide it.

Next, 5: ends with 1, so no.

What about 7? Let me try dividing 29791 by 7. Let's do the division:

7 * 4255 = 29785. 29791 - 29785 = 6, so remainder 6. So not divisible by 7.

Next, 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum. (2 - 9 + 7 - 9 + 1) = 2-9= -7 +7=0 -9= -9 +1= -8. Not divisible by 11, since -8 isn't a multiple of 11.

Next prime is 13. Let's try 29791 /13. Hmm, I'll do this step by step.

13 * 2000 = 26000. 29791 - 26000 = 3791.

13 * 291 = 3783. 3791 - 3783 = 8. So remainder 8. Not divisible by 13.

Next, 17. Let's see: 17 * 1750 = 29750. 29791-29750=41. 41 is more than 17, so 17*2=34, 41-34=7. So remainder 7. Not divisible by 17.

Next prime, 19. Let's compute 29791 รท19.

19*1500=28500. 29791-28500=1291.

Now 19*68=1292. Oh wait, 19*68 is 1292, which is 1 more than 1291. So 19*67=1273. 1291-1273=18, so remainder 18. So not divisible by 19.

Next prime, 23. Let's try 23.

23*1295=23*(1300-5)=23*1300=29900, minus 23*5=115, so 29900-115=29785. 29791-29785=6, so remainder 6. Not divisible by 23.

Next, 29. Let's see. 29*1000=29000. 29791-29000=791.

29*27=783. 791-783=8. So remainder 8. Not divisible by 29.

Next prime is 31. Let's try 31.

31*900=27900. 29791-27900=1891.

31*60=1860. 1891-1860=31. So 31*61=1891. So 29791 = 31*(900+61) = 31*961.

Wait, because 900 +61=961. So 31*961=29791.

So now I have 29791 =31 * 961.

Now I need to factor 961. Hmm, I think 961 is a square. Because 31^2 is 961, right? Wait, 30^2 is 900, 31^2 is 961. Yes, so 961=31^2.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, 31^2 is 961. So 29791 =31 * 31^2 =31^3?

Wait, no: 31*31^2 would be 31^3, but that would mean 31^3=29791. Wait, 31^3 is 29791? Let me check: 31^3 is 31*31*31= 961 *31. Let me compute 961*30=28830, plus 961=28830+961=29791. Oh, right! So 31^3=29791.

So, n=29791=31^3.

Now, since 31 is a prime, the totient function phi(n) when n is a prime power p^k is phi(p^k)=p^k - p^{k-1} = p^{k-1}(p-1).

So for n=31^3, phi(n)=31^3 -31^2=31^2*(31-1)=961 *30.

Compute 961*30. Let me calculate that.

961 *30 = (900 +61)*30 =900*30=27000 and 61*30=1830. So 27000+1830=28830.

Looking at the options, option J is 28830. So the answer should be J.

Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes in the factorization. So 31^3 is 29791. Yes, because 31*31=961, 961*31=29791. Correct.

So phi(31^3)=31^3 * (1 - 1/31) =31^3*(30/31)=31^2 *30=961*30=28830.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer is J.

To determine \( \phi(29791) \), where \( \phi \) is Euler's Totient Function, we first factorize 29791 into its prime factors. Through trial division, we find that:

\[
29791 = 31^3
\]

Euler's Totient Function for a prime power \( p^k \) is given by:

\[
\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = p^{k-1}(p-1)
\]

Applying this formula to \( n = 31^3 \):

\[
\phi(31^3) = 31^3 - 31^2 = 31^2(31-1) = 961 \cdot 30 = 28830
\]

Thus, the value of \( \phi(29791) \) is **28830**, which corresponds to option **J**.
