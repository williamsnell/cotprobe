Question:

Assume that all gases are perfect and that data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. Consider a system consisting of $2.0 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{~g})$, initially at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $10 \mathrm{~atm}$ and confined to a cylinder of cross-section $10.0 \mathrm{~cm}^2$. It is allowed to expand adiabatically against an external pressure of 1.0 atm until the piston has moved outwards through $20 \mathrm{~cm}$. Assume that carbon dioxide may be considered a perfect gas with $C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=28.8 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ and calculate $q$.

Options:

A: 100 J
B: -150 J
C: -100 $\mathrm{J}$
D:  0
E: -250 J
F: 50 $\mathrm{J}$
G: -200 J

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure out the value of q for the given process. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the system is 2.0 moles of CO2 gas. Initially, it's at 25°C, which is 298 K, and 10 atm pressure. It's confined in a cylinder with a cross-section of 10.0 cm². The process is an adiabatic expansion against an external pressure of 1.0 atm. The piston moves outward through 20 cm. CO2 is considered a perfect gas with Cv,m of 28.8 J/K/mol. I'm supposed to find q.

Hmm, since it's an adiabatic process, I remember that q (the heat) should be zero. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, no! Wait, adiabatic means no heat exchange, right? So q is zero. So the answer should be D: 0. But wait, is that correct?

Wait a second, I need to think carefully. Wait, the process is adiabatic, so yes, by definition, q=0. But wait! Wait, the system is expanding against an external pressure. So it's an irreversible process, but adiabatic still means q=0. Because in an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, regardless of whether it's reversible or irreversible.

Wait, but wait, the problem statement says it's allowed to expand adiabatically. So yes, q=0. So why are the answer options including other values? Oh, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the work done with the heat. Oh wait, no, the question is directly asking for q, the heat. So in an adiabatic process, q is zero. So the answer should be D: 0. So why are the options like negative values and others?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read again. The system expands adiabatically against an external pressure. So it's doing work on the surroundings, but since it's adiabatic, no heat is exchanged. So the first law, ΔU = q + w. But q is zero, so ΔU = w. But since the process is expansion, the system is doing work, so w is negative. But the question is about q, which is zero.

So the correct answer should be D: 0. So why are the other options present? Maybe I'm missing a trick here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that work done in expansion is considered negative. But that's about work, not heat. Since the process is adiabatic, q=0 regardless.

Wait, could the process be isothermal instead? No, the question says adiabatic. So no.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the answer is D: 0. But wait, looking at the options, D is 0. So that's the choice.

In this problem, the system consists of 2.0 moles of CO₂ gas initially at 25°C (298 K) and 10 atm, confined in a cylinder with a cross-sectional area of 10.0 cm². The gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion against an external pressure of 1.0 atm, with the piston moving outward through 20 cm. The problem specifies that CO₂ is treated as a perfect gas with \( C_{V,m} = 28.8 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}} \), and the task is to determine the value of \( q \), the heat exchanged during the process.

The key point here is that the process is explicitly stated to be adiabatic. By definition, an adiabatic process involves no heat exchange between the system and its surroundings, meaning \( q = 0 \). This holds true regardless of whether the process is reversible or irreversible. While the problem involves work being done by the system (as it expands against an external pressure), the question specifically asks for \( q \), which is dictated solely by the adiabatic nature of the process.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: 0**

This conclusion aligns with the definition of an adiabatic process, where no heat is exchanged, and the first law of thermodynamics (\( \Delta U = q + w \)) reduces to \( \Delta U = w \) since \( q = 0 \). However, the question is only concerned with \( q \), which is unambiguously zero in this case.
