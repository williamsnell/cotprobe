Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about tenants by the entirety and what happens when one spouse transfers their interest without the other's knowledge.

Alright, I remember that tenancy by the entirety is a form of co-ownership that's only available to a married couple. The key features are the right of survivorship, meaning when one spouse dies, the other gets the entire property. Also, each spouse doesn't own a 50% share; instead, they each own an undivided whole. So any conveyance by one without the other's consent might not be effective because it's not just about halvesâ€”it's about the entire interest.

The question says the wife transfers her interest via quitclaim deed to her aunt. So what's a quitclaim deed do? It transfers whatever interest the grantor has, if any. So if the wife didn't have the right to transfer, then the aunt gets nothing. But wait, in tenancy by the entirety, can one spouse convey their interest unilaterally?

I think that in a tenancy by entirety, each spouse cannot individually transfer the entire interest because it's a joint tenancy. To sever the tenancy, both spouses would typically need to act. So if the wife tries to transfer her interest, does that actually do anything? I remember that some jurisdictions hold that a spouse can't convey their interest in a tenancy by entirety without the other's consent. So if she tries to quitclaim, the transfer might not be valid.

Wait, but maybe that's not entirely correct. Some jurisdictions allow one spouse to transfer their interest, which would sever the tenancy by the entirety and create a tenancy in common. But in that case, the wife's interest would be split. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the tenancy by entirety can't be severed unilaterally, so the wife's attempt to transfer doesn't work.

Let me think again. In a tenancy by the entirety, each has the right to the entire property, but they don't have separate interests. So when one spouse tries to transfer their interest, it might not actually convey anything because the concept is that they both own the whole. So if the wife tries to transfer her interest, perhaps she doesn't have a separate interest to transfer. Therefore, the aunt would receive nothing because the wife can't convey what she doesn't own individually.

So applying that to the question, the wife's transfer would be ineffective. The aunt wouldn't gain any interest. So the answer would be H: No interest.

But wait, another angle. If the wife transferred her interest, and the law allows that, maybe it severs the tenancy by entirety, turning it into a tenancy in common. If that's the case, then the wife's half would go to the aunt. But earlier, I thought that you can't sever it unilaterally. So which is it?

I'm a bit shaky on this. In some states, a spouse cannot sever the tenancy by entirety without the other's consent. So any attempt to transfer would be void. But in other states, maybe it's allowed. Wait, but I think the traditional rule is that you can't sever the tenancy by the entirety without the consent of both spouses. So the wife's attempt to convey her interest would not affect the title.

Therefore, the aunt gets no interest, so the correct answer is H: No interest.
</think>

In a tenancy by the entirety, the spouses own the property as a single legal entity, with each spouse having an undivided right to the whole property. This form of ownership includes the right of survivorship, meaning that upon the death of one spouse, the other spouse automatically inherits the entire property. Importantly, each spouse does not own a separate, divisible interest that can be individually transferred without the consent of the other spouse.

When the wife attempts to transfer her interest in the dairy to her aunt via a quitclaim deed without the husband's knowledge or consent, the transfer is generally ineffective under the traditional rules of tenancy by the entirety. This is because the wife does not hold a separate, transferable interest; her ownership is inextricably tied to the joint ownership with her husband. As a result, the aunt acquires no interest in the property.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: No interest.**
