Okay, so I've got this question here about amino acids and proteins in cells. Hmm, I need to figure out how to demonstrate that amino acids are used to build proteins, while the existing proteins are used for catabolism. Let me think about this.

Alright, amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Cells make proteins by linking amino acids together, right? So if we want to show that amino acids are being used to build new proteins, we need a way to track where those amino acids go.

Wait, the question also mentions that the proteins already present are used in catabolism. Catabolism is breaking things down, so that would mean the cell is breaking down existing proteins, maybe for energy or releasing amino acids for other uses.

So how do we show that new proteins are being made from amino acids? I remember something about radioactive labeling. Like, if you use a radioactive isotope, you can track its path in the cell.

Oh right, autoradiography! That's a technique where you can detect radioactive substances in a sample. So if you label amino acids with a radioactive marker and then see where they end up in the cell, that would show they're incorporated into proteins.

Let me look at the options. Option D is Autoradiography with labelled amino acids. That sounds like what I was thinking. If the amino acids are used to build proteins, their radioactive labels should appear in the newly synthesized proteins. Over time, you can track their presence, showing they're part of protein structures.

Other options don't seem as relevant. Option B is fluorescent tagging, but that's more for tracking proteins in real-time, maybe, not showing their synthesis from amino acids. Option H, Western blot, detects specific proteins but doesn't directly show the use of amino acids in their creation. Option G, ribosomes, well, more ribosomes mean more protein synthesis, but that's a quantity measure, not a demonstration of the process itself.

So the best method would be using labelled amino acids and seeing if they're incorporated into proteins via autoradiography. That way, you can visually demonstrate that amino acids are building new proteins.

To demonstrate that amino acids are used to build proteins in cells while existing proteins are used in catabolism, the most effective approach is to track the incorporation of amino acids into newly synthesized proteins. This can be achieved using autoradiography with labelled amino acids. By labeling amino acids with a radioactive isotope, their movement and incorporation into proteins can be visually detected. Over time, the radioactive signal will appear in newly synthesized proteins, providing direct evidence that amino acids are being used to build proteins. This method specifically addresses the question by illustrating the dynamic process of protein synthesis.

Other options, such as fluorescent tagging (B) or Western blot analysis (H), are less suitable because they do not directly demonstrate the incorporation of amino acids into proteins. Similarly, quantifying ribosomes (G) only measures the capacity for protein synthesis, not the actual process. Autoradiography with labelled amino acids (D) is the most precise method for this purpose.

Answer: D
