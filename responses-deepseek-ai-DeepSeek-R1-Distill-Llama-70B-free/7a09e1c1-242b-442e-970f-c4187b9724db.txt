Question:

An on-duty Police Officer hears breaking glass and a blaring alarm, and sees Stan run out of a darkened liquor store at 3 a.m. Stan runs around the corner, out of Officer's view, and hops into a car. Officer sees Stan drive away and pursues, lights flashing. Stan pulls over and Officer arrests him. Officer sees nothing in the passenger compartment, but pops the trunk and finds cash and a baseball bat. Stan's motion to suppress the cash and baseball bat as evidence will likely be

Options:

A: Denied, because the Officer had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime.
B: Granted, because the arrest was illegal and therefore the evidence is considered to be fruit of the poisonous tree.
C: Granted, because the Officer did not have a search warrant to check the trunk of the car.
D: Granted, because the Officer did not have a valid reason to pull Stan over in the first place.
E: Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.
F: Denied, because the Officer had probable cause to search the trunk.
G: Denied, because the Officer had the right to search the car without a warrant.
H: Granted, because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.
I: Denied, because the Officer was in the pursuit of his duties and the search was incidental to the arrest.
J: Granted, because the Officer did not observe Stan commit any crime.

Okay, so I've got this question about criminal procedure, specifically regarding searches and seizures. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a police officer sees Stan running out of a liquor store late at night. The store's window is broken, and the alarm is blaring. Stan runs around the corner, gets into a car, and drives away. The officer pursues with lights flashing, and Stan pulls over. The officer arrests him and then checks the trunk, finding cash and a baseball bat. Stan is moving to suppress this evidence.

The question is whether Stan's motion will be granted or denied, and why.

First, I need to recall the legal principles involved. The main issue here is whether the search of the trunk was lawful. Under the Fourth Amendment, searches without a warrant are generally unreasonable unless an exception applies.

One exception is a search incident to a lawful arrest. When a person is arrested, the police can search the person and the area within their immediate control. However, when the arrest occurs in a car, the rules are a bit different. 

In New York v. Belton, the Supreme Court held that when a police officer makes a lawful arrest of the occupant of a car, the officer may search the entire passenger compartment as a search incident to that arrest. But the Belton rule specifically limits the search to the passenger compartment, not the trunk. So, searching the trunk would not fall under this exception unless there's another justification.

Another exception is probable cause. If the officer has probable cause to believe that the trunk contains evidence of a crime, they can search it without a warrant under the automobile exception. The automobile exception allows warrantless searches of vehicles if there's probable cause, based on the mobility of cars and the reduced expectation of privacy.

Let's apply this to the facts. The officer saw Stan running out of a liquor store with broken glass and an alarm sounding. This likely gives the officer probable cause to believe that a burglary or robbery occurred. When Stan drives away, the officer has probable cause to stop him. The arrest would be lawful if based on probable cause.

Now, after arresting Stan, the officer pops the trunk. Under Belton, the officer can search the passenger area but not the trunk. However, if the officer has probable cause to believe the trunk contains evidence, then the search would be valid under the automobile exception.

In this case, the officer saw Stan running from a liquor store that's presumably been robbed or burglarized. It's reasonable to think that evidence (like stolen goods or tools) might be in the trunk. So, the officer would have probable cause to search the trunk without a warrant.

Wait, but is the automobile exception applicable here? The automobile exception doesn't require a warrant if there's probable cause. So, yes, the officer can search the entire car, including the trunk, if there's probable cause.

Alternatively, if the trunk isn't within Stan's reach at the time of arrest, some might argue that it's not part of the search incident to arrest. But since the officer has probable cause, the search is justified under the automobile exception.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Denied because reasonable suspicion. But reasonable suspicion isn't enough for a search; probable cause is needed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Granted because arrest was illegal. But the arrest seems lawful based on probable cause, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Granted because no warrant. But the automobile exception allows warrantless searches with probable cause, so C is wrong.

Option D: Granted because no reason to pull over. The officer had probable cause to stop Stan, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Denied because search incident includes trunk. Belton says passenger compartment only, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Denied because probable cause to search trunk. This seems correct because the officer did have probable cause.

Option G: Denied because right to search without warrant. Since the automobile exception applies, G is correct, but F is more specific.

Option H: Granted because trunk out of control. Maybe, but the main issue is probable cause, so H is less likely.

Option I: Denied because pursuit and incidental arrest. No, because Belton doesn't cover the trunk, but the automobile exception does. So I is partly correct but not the best.

Option J: Granted because no observed crime. The officer had probable cause based on circumstances, so J is incorrect.

So the best answer is F: Denied because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk.

The scenario involves a police officer who arrests Stan after observing him flee a darkened liquor store with a broken window and blaring alarm at 3 a.m. The officer searches the trunk of Stan's car, finding cash and a baseball bat, and Stan moves to suppress this evidence. The legality of the search hinges on whether the officer had probable cause or relied on a valid exception to the warrant requirement under the Fourth Amendment.

Under the automobile exception, a warrantless search of a vehicle is permissible if the officer has probable cause to believe the vehicle contains evidence of a crime. Here, the officer had probable cause to arrest Stan based on the circumstances (broken glass, alarm, and Stan fleeing the scene), which also supports probable cause to search the trunk for evidence related to the crime. While the search incident to arrest (under New York v. Belton) allows searching the passenger compartment, it does not extend to the trunk. However, the automobile exception justifies the trunk search in this case due to the officer's probable cause.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Reasonable suspicion alone does not justify a search; probable cause is required.
- **B**: Incorrect. The arrest was lawful based on probable cause.
- **C**: Incorrect. The automobile exception allows warrantless searches with probable cause.
- **D**: Incorrect. The officer had probable cause to pull Stan over.
- **E**: Incorrect. Belton limits searches incident to arrest to the passenger compartment, not the trunk.
- **F**: Correct. The officer had probable cause to search the trunk under the automobile exception.
- **G**: Incorrect. While the automobile exception allows warrantless searches, F is more specific.
- **H**: Incorrect. The search was justified by probable cause, not Stan's lack of control over the trunk.
- **I**: Incorrect. The search was not merely incidental to arrest but also based on probable cause.
- **J**: Incorrect. The officer had probable cause based on the circumstances, even without directly observing Stan commit a crime.

The best answer is **F**.

Answer: F
