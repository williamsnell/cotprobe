Okay, so I have this problem here about George selling vacuum cleaners. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, George sells each vacuum cleaner for $75. And he gets a 30% commission on each sale. Hmm, commission means he gets a percentage of the selling price for each unit he sells, right? So for each vacuum he sells, he earns 30% of $75.

Let me calculate that first. 30% of $75. Well, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember that 10% of 75 is 7.5, so 30% would be three times that. So 7.5 times 3 is 22.5. So each sale gives him $22.5.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Another way to calculate it is 0.3 multiplied by 75. Let me do that: 0.3 * 75. 0.3 times 70 is 21, and 0.3 times 5 is 1.5, so 21 + 1.5 is 22.5. Yep, that's correct. So each machine he sells, he makes $22.5.

Now, the question says he sold 13 machines last week. So to find his total earnings, I need to multiply the commission per machine by the number of machines he sold. That would be 22.5 times 13.

Hmm, let me compute that. 22.5 * 10 is 225, and 22.5 * 3 is 67.5. So adding those together, 225 + 67.5 equals 292.5. So his total earnings should be $292.5.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to compute 22.5 * 13: I can break it down into (20 + 2.5) * 13, which is 20*13 + 2.5*13. 20*13 is 260, and 2.5*13 is 32.5. Adding those gives 260 + 32.5 = 292.5. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option J is $292.50. So that must be the right answer.

To determine George's total earnings, we start by calculating his commission per vacuum cleaner. Each vacuum is sold for $75, and he earns a 30% commission on each sale. 

30% of $75 is calculated as:
\[
0.3 \times 75 = 22.5
\]
So, George earns $22.5 for each vacuum cleaner he sells.

Next, we calculate his total earnings for selling 13 vacuum cleaners:
\[
22.5 \times 13 = 292.5
\]

Thus, George's total earnings are $292.50. The correct answer is:

J: $292.50

Answer: J
