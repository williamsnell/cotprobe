Question:

A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

Options:

A: admissible, because the original contract was lost.
B: inadmissible, unless the seller admits to the authenticity of the duplicate.
C: inadmissible, because the seller did not sign or acknowledge the duplicate.
D: inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.
E: admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.
F: inadmissible, because the duplicate might be a forgery.
G: admissible, only if the buyer can provide witnesses to confirm the authenticity of the duplicate.
H: admissible, if the court can confirm the fairness of the contract.
I: admissible, because the duplicate has the same legal value as the original contract.
J: inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.

Okay, so I have this evidence question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is that a buyer sued a seller over a contract related to a hot dog stand. The contract says the seller can't open another stand within two miles for two years. The buyer claims the seller violated this by opening one half a mile away. But the original contract was lost before the trial. Now, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy, and the seller objects, questioning the authenticity of the original contract.

The question is about whether this duplicate is admissible as evidence. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, I remember that evidence law has rules about originals and copies. There's something called the best evidence rule, right? I think it says that when the terms of a writing are in issue, you need to produce the original unless reasons are given why it's not possible.

Wait, but there are exceptions. Like, if the original is lost or destroyed, then a copy can be used. I think the rule is that if a party can show that the original is lost or destroyed, and they can't produce it by any reasonable diligence, then secondary evidence like a copy is admissible.

So in this case, the original was lost before trial. So the buyer can't produce it. They have a duplicate carbon copy. So under the best evidence rule, as long as they can account for the loss, the copy should be admissible.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's admissible because the original was lost. That sounds right. Because the best evidence rule allows a copy when the original is lost, provided the loss is accounted for.

Option B says inadmissible unless the seller admits authenticity. No, I don't think the seller's admission is necessary if the loss is properly explained. The seller's objection is about authenticity, but the procedure is to lay the foundation for the copy, not necessarily needing the seller's admission.

Option C says inadmissible because the seller didn't sign the duplicate. Well, the duplicate is a carbon copy presumably made at the time of the original. The issue isn't whether the seller signed the duplicate, but whether the original was genuine. The copy is evidence of the original, so the signature on the original would be what matters.

Option D says inadmissible because the best evidence rule requires the original always. That's not right because the best evidence rule has exceptions, like when the original is lost.

Option E says admissible because it's a carbon copy. Well, being a carbon copy might be a factor, but the main point is the loss of the original. So E might not be the best reason.

Option F says inadmissible because the duplicate might be a forgery. But that's an objection that goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. The court can consider the risk of forgery, but the evidence isn't automatically inadmissible just because of that possibility.

Option G says admissible only if the buyer has witnesses to confirm authenticity. I think the buyer would need to lay some foundation, like testifying that the copy is a true and accurate reproduction of the original. Witnesses might help, but it's not strictly necessary if the foundation is properly laid by other means.

Option I says the duplicate has the same legal value as the original. Wait, no, that's not generally true. Copies are considered secondary evidence. They don't have the same legal value unless they are certified or fall under another exception.

Option J says inadmissible because the seller contests authenticity. But the seller's objection is a basis for challenging the evidence, but not an automatic bar. The buyer can still present the copy as evidence, and the court will assess its reliability.

Putting this all together, the best answer seems to be A. Because the original was lost, the duplicate is admissible under the best evidence rule's exception for lost originals.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a duplicate carbon copy of a lost contract under the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule generally requires the original document when the terms of a writing are in dispute. However, exceptions apply, such as when the original is lost or destroyed. In this case, the original contract was lost, and the buyer seeks to introduce a duplicate carbon copy. 

Under the best evidence rule, a duplicate can be admitted if the original is unavailable and the party can account for its loss. The seller's objection regarding authenticity does not automatically bar the evidence but may affect its weight. The duplicate's admissibility does not depend on the seller's admission or the presence of witnesses, as long as a proper foundation is laid for its introduction.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is correct because the original was lost, allowing the duplicate to be admitted under the exception to the best evidence rule.
- **B, C, D, E, F, G, I, J** are incorrect because they either misstate the requirements for admitting a duplicate or fail to account for the best evidence rule's exceptions.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**

Answer: A
