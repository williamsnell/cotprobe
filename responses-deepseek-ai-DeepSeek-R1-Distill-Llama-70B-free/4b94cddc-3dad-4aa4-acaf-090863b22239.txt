Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says there's a tournament with 393 players, and each team has 3 players. I need to find out how many teams there are in the tournament. The answer choices are from A to J, each showing a different mathematical expression.

Hmm, right. So, the key here is to find the number of teams when you have a total number of players. Since each team has 3 players, I think I should divide the total number of players by the number of players per team. That makes sense because division would give me how many groups (teams) of 3 there are in 393.

Let me think, if I have 6 players and each team has 2, then the number of teams would be 6 divided by 2, which is 3. So it's the same logic here. 393 divided by 3 should give me the number of teams.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one represents 393 divided by 3. Let's go through them:

Option A is 3 + 393, which is addition. That would be adding the number of players and players per team, which doesn't make sense for finding the number of teams. So A is out.

Option B is 3 multiplied by 393. That would give a much larger number, which isn't right because we're looking for how many teams, not the total players if each team had more players. So B is wrong.

Option C is (393 minus 3) multiplied by 3. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Subtracting 3 first and then multiplying... I don't think that's the way to go. It changes the total players in a way that's not necessary.

Option D is 393 divided by 3. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. Dividing the total number by the number per team gives the number of teams. So D looks correct.

Option E is (393 plus 3) divided by 3. Adding 3 first would change the total, maybe making it 396 divided by 3, which is 132. But we have 393 players, so adding 3 would be incorrect. So E isn't right.

Option F is 393 multiplied by 3 again, which is the same as option B. So F is wrong.

Option G is 393 plus 3, which is again addition and not the right operation. So G is out.

Option H is 393 minus 3. That would give 390, but that's just subtracting one player, which doesn't help in finding the number of teams. H isn't correct.

Option I is 3 minus 393, which is a negative number. That doesn't make sense in this context because the number of teams can't be negative. So I is wrong.

Option J is 3 divided by 393. Oh, that would give a fraction less than one, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a team in this scenario. So J is incorrect.

So after going through all the options, the correct expression is option D: 393 divided by 3. That will give the number of teams needed for 393 players with 3 on each team.

To determine the number of teams in a tournament with 393 players and 3 players per team, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players per team. This is represented by the expression 393 ÷ 3. 

The correct answer is D.

Answer: D
