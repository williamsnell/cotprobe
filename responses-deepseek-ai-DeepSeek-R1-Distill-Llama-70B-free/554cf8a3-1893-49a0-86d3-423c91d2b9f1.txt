Okay, so I've got this quartic equation problem to solve. The equation is x⁴ - 18x³ + kx² + 200x - 1984 = 0. I'm told that the product of two of the four roots is -32, and I need to find the value of k. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to figure it out.

Hmm, quartic equations can be tricky, but I remember that Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. So let's try to apply that here.

Let me denote the roots as a, b, c, d. So the equation can be written as (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d) = 0. When expanded, the coefficients relate to the sums and products of these roots.

Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation x⁴ + p x³ + q x² + r x + s = 0 tell us that:

- The sum of the roots, a + b + c + d = -p.
- The sum of products two at a time, ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = q.
- The sum of products three at a time, abc + abd + acd + bcd = -r.
- The product of all roots, abcd = s.

Wait, in our equation, the coefficients are a bit different. Let me write it down correctly. The given equation is x⁴ - 18x³ + kx² + 200x - 1984 = 0. So comparing to the standard form x⁴ + p x³ + q x² + r x + s = 0, I see that p is -18, q is k, r is 200, and s is -1984.

So applying Vieta's:

1. Sum of roots: a + b + c + d = 18 (since p is -18, so -p is 18).
2. Sum of products two at a time: ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = k.
3. Sum of products three at a time: abc + abd + acd + bcd = -200.
4. Product of all roots: abcd = -1984.

The problem states that the product of two roots is -32. Let's say a * b = -32. So ab = -32. But I don't know the other roots.

I think I can express the other roots in terms of the known product. Let me consider the other variables. Let me call the other two roots c and d. So the product ab is -32, and abcd is -1984. So substituting ab = -32, we get (-32) * c * d = -1984. Simplifying, c*d = (-1984)/(-32) = 62. So c*d = 62.

Now, I need to find k, which is the sum of all possible products of two roots. So k = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd.

We already have ab = -32 and cd = 62. So k = (-32) + (ac + ad + bc + bd) + 62. So that simplifies to k = 30 + (ac + ad + bc + bd).

Hmm, so I need to find ac + ad + bc + bd. Let's factor this expression. Notice that ac + ad + bc + bd can be rewritten as a(c + d) + b(c + d) = (a + b)(c + d).

Wait no, wait: a(c + d) + b(c + d) = (a + b)(c + d). So yes, that's correct.

So ac + ad + bc + bd = (a + b)(c + d).

So if I can find (a + b) and (c + d), then I can compute this part.

From the sum of the roots: a + b + c + d = 18. So (a + b) + (c + d) = 18. Let me denote (a + b) as S and (c + d) as T. So S + T = 18.

We also know that (a + b)(c + d) = S*T. And from earlier, ac + ad + bc + bd = S*T.

So, our expression for k becomes:

k = 30 + S*T.

Now, we need to find S*T.

But what else do we know? Let's think about the sum of the products of three roots. Vieta's formula says that the sum of the products of three roots is -200. So:

abc + abd + acd + bcd = -200.

Let me factor this expression. Let's factor out ab from the first two terms and cd from the last two.

abc + abd = ab(c + d) = ab*T.

acd + bcd = cd(a + b) = cd*S.

So the sum becomes ab*T + cd*S = -200.

We know ab is -32, cd is 62, so substituting:

(-32)*T + 62*S = -200.

We have S + T = 18, so T = 18 - S.

Substituting T into the equation:

(-32)(18 - S) + 62 S = -200.

Let me compute this:

Multiply out:

-32 * 18 = -576.

-32*(-S) = 32 S.

So:

-576 +32 S +62 S = -200.

Combine like terms:

(32 S + 62 S) = 94 S.

So equation becomes:

-576 + 94 S = -200.

Add 576 to both sides:

94 S = 376.

Then, S = 376 / 94.

Let me compute that: 94 * 4 = 376, so S = 4.

So S = a + b = 4.

Then T = 18 - S = 14.

Now, (a + b)(c + d) = S*T = 4 *14 = 56.

So, going back to k:

k = 30 + S*T = 30 +56 = 86.

Wait, that gives k=86, which is option C.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Identified the roots as a, b, c, d. ab = -32, cd =62.

2. Sum of roots: S + T = 18.

3. Sum of products of three roots: (-32)T +62 S = -200.

4. Substituted T=18-S into equation, solved for S.

5. S=4, T=14. Then S*T=56. So k = 30 +56=86.

Yes, that seems right. So the correct answer should be C:86.

To solve the problem, we start by applying Vieta's formulas to the quartic equation \(x^4 - 18x^3 + kx^2 + 200x - 1984 = 0\). Let the roots of the equation be \(a, b, c, d\). Vieta's formulas give us the following relationships:

1. \(a + b + c + d = 18\),
2. \(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = k\),
3. \(abc + abd + acd + bcd = -200\),
4. \(abcd = -1984\).

The problem states that the product of two roots is \(-32\). Assume \(ab = -32\). Using the product of all roots, \(abcd = -1984\), we substitute \(ab = -32\) to find \(cd = \frac{-1984}{-32} = 62\).

Next, we need to find \(k\), which is the sum of all products of two roots. We already know \(ab = -32\) and \(cd = 62\), so:

\[
k = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = -32 + (ac + ad + bc + bd) + 62.
\]

To compute \(ac + ad + bc + bd\), we rewrite it as \((a + b)(c + d)\). Let \(S = a + b\) and \(T = c + d\). From the sum of the roots, \(S + T = 18\). Thus:

\[
ac + ad + bc + bd = S \cdot T.
\]

From Vieta's formula for the sum of products of three roots, \(abc + abd + acd + bcd = -200\), we factor it as:

\[
ab \cdot T + cd \cdot S = -200.
\]

Substituting \(ab = -32\), \(cd = 62\), and \(T = 18 - S\), we get:

\[
(-32)(18 - S) + 62S = -200.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
-576 + 32S + 62S = -200,
\]
\[
94S - 576 = -200,
\]
\[
94S = 376,
\]
\[
S = 4.
\]

Thus, \(T = 18 - S = 14\). Now, \(S \cdot T = 4 \cdot 14 = 56\). Substituting back into the expression for \(k\):

\[
k = -32 + 56 + 62 = 86.
\]

The value of \(k\) is therefore **86**.
