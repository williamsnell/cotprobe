Okay, so I have this question about production methods and technical efficiency. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on microeconomics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about Sigma Corporation choosing a production method to be technically efficient. So, technical efficiency means producing the maximum possible output given the inputs, or producing a given output with the least inputs. In this case, they want to produce 10 dozen pairs of shoes per day, which is 120 pairs, right? Because 1 dozen is 12, so 10 dozen is 120.

The production function is given as S = sqrt(W * M), where S is shoe output, W is the number of shoe workers, and M is the number of shoe-making machines. Both W and M are in terms of 8-hour days.

So the goal is to find which production method uses the least total inputs (W + M) to produce S = 10 dozen, which is 120 pairs. Wait, actually, wait no. Wait, S is in numbers of pairs per day, so 10 dozen is 120 pairs. So S = 120.

Wait, the production function is S = sqrt(W*M). So, plugging in S=120, we have 120 = sqrt(W*M). Squaring both sides, W*M = 120² = 14400.

So the product of W and M must be 14,400. The question is about technical efficiency, which in this context means using the least amount of inputs. But wait, technical efficiency is about producing the maximum output for given inputs or the minimum inputs for a given output. Since they're producing a fixed output (120), technical efficiency would mean using the least total inputs.

Alternatively, because the production function is given, perhaps any input combination that lies on the production function is technically efficient. Wait, no. Wait, the production function is the maximum output achievable for given inputs. So if you have W and M such that S = sqrt(WM) is exactly 120, then that's technically efficient because you can't produce more than that with those inputs. But if a method produces less than the maximum, it's inefficient.

But in this case, all the methods given produce exactly 10 dozen, which is 120 pairs, so they're all on the production function. So all of them are technically efficient in that sense. But wait, the question is about being efficient with the production function, meaning choosing the method that uses the minimal inputs.

Wait no, maybe the question is about choosing a method that is technically efficient, which would mean any method that's on the production function, as opposed to being inside, which would be inefficient. So since all the methods produce exactly 120, they are all technically efficient. So perhaps the question is about choosing the method that is cost-efficient, but the question doesn't mention costs. It's about being technically efficient, so any of the methods would do, but perhaps the question is looking for the one that uses the least total resources, assuming perhaps that they're minimizing W + M.

Wait, but the question's wording is a bit confusing. It says, "management should choose so that it will be technically efficient and consequently efficient with the production function." Hmm, so perhaps the production function is S = sqrt(WM), and being efficient with that function means using the right combination where S is maximized for the given inputs. But all the methods are on the production function, so they're all technically efficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to choose the method that uses the least inputs because that's technically efficient in terms of minimizing resource use for the desired output.

Wait, but perhaps the question is more about whether the methods are technically efficient. Since all the methods achieve S=120, which is exactly what the production function says for their W and M, then all are technically efficient. So perhaps the question is looking for the method that is the most efficient in some other sense, but the options don't mention cost. So maybe the answer is any of the methods, but perhaps the question is more about which method is on the production function.

Wait, no, the question provides five production methods (alpha to epsilon), each with different W and M, all producing 10 dozen. So each of these methods must satisfy S=120 = sqrt(WM), so W*M=14400.

Let me check each method:

Alpha: W=10, M=30. So W*M=300. Which is 10*30=300. But wait, 300 is nowhere near 14400. Wait, that can't be right. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, wait, no, the production methods table shows:

Production Method | Quantity of Shoes (dozens) | W | M
alpha | 10 | 10 | 10
beta | 10 | 30 | 25
gamma | 10 | 22 | 20
delta | 10 | 20 | 20
epsilon |10 |7 |5

Wait, but wait, the quantity is 10 dozen, which is 120. So S=120.

So for each method, let's compute W*M and see if it equals 14400.

Alpha: W=10, M=10. So W*M=100. But 100 is much less than 14400. So this would imply that S= sqrt(100)=10, which is 10 pairs, not 10 dozen. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, wait, I must have misread the table.

Wait the table says:

Production Method | Quantity of Shoes Produced per day (in dozens) | W | M
alpha | 10 | 10 | 10
Wait, no, looking again:

Wait, the first line after the headers is:

alpha beta gamma delta epsilon

Then the next line is:

10 10 10 10 10

Wait, no, perhaps the table is:

Each production method has three numbers: quantity, W, M.

Wait, perhaps the table is arranged as three rows. Let me parse it correctly.

The first line after the header is: 10 10 10 10 10.

Second line:30 25 22 20 20.

Third line:10 7 5 6 5.

Wait, that can't be right. No, perhaps the first data row is for the quantity, the second for W, third for M.

Wait, the initial question says:

Production Method Quantity of Shoes Produced per day (in dozens) Number of Shoe Workers (in 8-hour day) Number of Shoemaking Machines (in 8-hour day)

Then:

alpha beta gamma delta epsilon

10 10 10 10 10

30 25 22 20 20

10 7 5 6 5

Wait, that makes sense. So for each method, the data is:

- alpha: 10 dozen shoes, 30 workers, 10 machines.

Wait, no, wait. The first line lists the methods: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon.

Then the next line is the quantity for each: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. So all produce 10 dozen.

Then the next line is the W for each: 30,25,22,20,20.

Then the next line is M for each:10,7,5,6,5.

Wait, no, no, perhaps the next line is the number of shoe workers for each method, and then the next line is the number of machines.

So let's reorganize:

Production Method | Quantity (dozens) | W | M
alpha | 10 | 30 |10
beta |10 |25 |7
gamma |10 |22 |5
delta |10 |20 |6
epsilon |10 |20 |5

Wait, that seems more accurate. So each method's W and M are as above.

So now, for each method, let's compute W*M and see if it equals 14400 (since S=120, so sqrt(WM)=120 → WM=14400).

Wait, but looking at the numbers:

Alpha: W=30, M=10 → WM=300.

Beta: W=25, M=7 → 175.

Gamma: W=22, M=5 → 110.

Delta: W=20, M=6 → 120.

Epsilon: W=20, M=5 → 100.

Wait, none of these equal 14400. That's a problem because the production function requires that S=sqrt(WM)=120 → WM=14400.

So none of the production methods satisfy this condition. But that can't be right because the question states that all these methods produce 10 dozen shoes. So perhaps I've made a mistake in reading the table.

Wait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me read it again.

The initial data presented is:

Production Method Quantity of Shoes Produced per day (in dozens) Number of Shoe Workers (in 8-hour day) Number of Shoemaking Machines (in 8-hour day)

Then, the next lines:

alpha beta gamma delta epsilon

10 10 10 10 10

30 25 22 20 20

10 7 5 6 5

Wait, perhaps the second line is the W for each method, and the third line is M.

So:

- alpha: W=30, M=10.

- beta: W=25, M=7.

- gamma: W=22, M=5.

- delta: W=20, M=6.

- epsilon: W=20, M=5.

So, for each method:

S is given as 10 dozen, which is 120. So S = sqrt(W*M) should equal 120.

But let's compute sqrt(W*M) for each method.

Alpha: sqrt(30*10) = sqrt(300) ≈17.32, which is about 17.32 pairs, not 120.

Wait, that's way off. So this can't be right. Am I misinterpreting the data?

Wait, perhaps the initial table is structured differently. Maybe the first row is the quantity for each method, the second row the W, and the third the M.

So:

For alpha: 10 dozen, 30 workers, 10 machines.

Beta:10 dozen,25 W,7 M.

Gamma:10 dozen,22 W,5 M.

Delta:10 dozen,20 W,6 M.

Epsilon:10 dozen,20 W,5 M.

So their W and M are as above.

But according to the production function, S=sqrt(WM) must equal 120.

So for each method, let's compute S:

alpha: sqrt(30 *10)=sqrt(300)=~17.32, which is 17.32 pairs, not 120.

This is way off. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. Maybe the quantity is in dozens, so 10 dozen is 120 pairs. So S=120.

But according to the production function, S=sqrt(WM). So for S=120, WM=14400.

So which of the methods has W*M=14400?

Looking at each:

Alpha:30*10=300.

Beta:25*7=175.

Gamma:22*5=110.

Delta:20*6=120.

Epsilon:20*5=100.

None of these equal 14400. So this suggests that none of the methods are producing 120 pairs, which contradicts the question statement that all methods produce 10 dozen (120) pairs.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the table. Let me try another approach. Maybe the first data row after the header is the number of workers, and the next is machines.

Wait, no, the header says the first data is quantity, then W, then M.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented as:

For each method, the three values are:

Shoes (dozens), W, M.

So:

alpha: 10, 30,10.

beta:10,25,7.

gamma:10,22,5.

delta:10,20,6.

epsilon:10,20,5.

So, that's correct as before.

So, the issue is that none of the methods satisfy S=sqrt(WM)=120. Because for that, WM must be 14400, but all the methods have much lower W and M.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the production function. Let me recheck.

The production function is S = sqrt(W * M), where S is in pairs per day, and W and M are in 8-hour days.

So if a method is using W=30 and M=10, then S=sqrt(30*10)=sqrt(300)=~17.32 pairs, which is about 1.88 dozen. But the table says they produce 10 dozen, which is 120. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, so perhaps the data in the table is correct, but the production function is different. Or perhaps I'm misapplying the function.

Wait, perhaps the production function is S = sqrt(W * M) * 12, since 1 dozen is 12. So S in dozens would be sqrt(WM)/12? Wait, no, the problem states that S is in pairs, so sqrt(WM) gives pairs. So 10 dozen is 120 pairs, so sqrt(WM)=120 → WM=14400.

Looking back at the methods, none have W*M=14400. So perhaps the question has a typo, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, perhaps the table is structured differently. Maybe the first row after the headers is the number of workers, the next is machines. Let me try that.

So for alpha, W=10, M=10. Then S=sqrt(10*10)=10 pairs, which is 10/12 ≈0.83 dozen. But the table says alpha produces 10 dozen. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the table's first data row is W, second is M, third is S. But the header says the first is S.

Alternatively, perhaps the table is miswritten. Let me re-express it:

The table is:

Production Method | Shoes (dozens) | W | M

alpha |10 |30 |10

beta |10 |25 |7

gamma |10 |22 |5

delta |10 |20 |6

epsilon |10 |20 |5

So each method produces 10 dozen (120 pairs), but according to the production function S=sqrt(WM), which would require that for each method, sqrt(WM)=120. Let's check:

alpha: sqrt(30*10)=sqrt(300)=~17.32, which is way below 120.

So that can't be right. There's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the methods given are not supposed to produce 10 dozen each, but perhaps the question says that they produce 10 dozen, but according to the production function, they should, but in reality, their W and M don't add up.

Wait, but the question states that all five methods produce 10 dozen per day. So perhaps the production function is misapplied, or perhaps the correct method is the one that actually satisfies the production function.

So the correct method is the one where W*M = (120)^2 =14400.

Looking at the options, none of the methods have W*M=14400. So perhaps the correct answer is that none of the methods are technically efficient, but that can't be because the question asks to choose from the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check each method again.

Alpha: W=30, M=10 → 30*10=300. S=sqrt(300)=~17.32 pairs, which is about 1.44 dozen. But the table says 10 dozen. So this is inconsistent.

Beta: W=25, M=7 → 25*7=175. S≈13.23 pairs, about 1.1 dozen. Not 10.

Gamma:22*5=110 → S≈10.48 pairs, ~0.87 dozen.

Delta:20*6=120 → S=10.95 pairs, ~0.9125 dozen.

Epsilon:20*5=100 → S=10 pairs, 0.833 dozen.

Wait, none of these produce 10 dozen. So the data is inconsistent with the production function. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm misreading the table.

Wait, perhaps the table's first data row is the number of machines, not workers. Let me try that.

If for alpha, W=10, M=30. Then W*M=300. S=17.32, which is about 1.44 dozen. Still not 10.

Beta: W=7, M=25 → 175 → ~13.23 pairs.

No, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the table lists W and M in different units. For example, perhaps M is in some other measure. But the question states that M is in 8-hour days, same as W.

Wait, perhaps the production function is S= sqrt(W*M) in dozens, not in pairs. Wait, the question says S is in pairs, so that's not it.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The question asks which method is technically efficient, meaning it's on the production function. But according to the given data, none of the methods satisfy S=sqrt(WM)=120.

So perhaps the correct answer is that none of the given methods are technically efficient, but that's not an option here. The options are from A to J, with methods alpha to epsilon being options A to E and others being combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps the production function is S = sqrt(W + M), but that would make more sense with the given data. Let me check.

If S = sqrt(W + M), then for alpha, W=30, M=10 → W+M=40 → S=6.32, which is not 10.

No, that doesn't work either.

Wait, perhaps the production function is S = (W * M)^2. Then S would be (WM)^2. Let's see:

For alpha, 30*10=300. S=300^2=90000, which is way too high.

No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the production function is S = W + M. Then for alpha, 30+10=40 pairs, which is about 3.33 dozen, not 10.

No.

Wait, perhaps the production function is S = (W * M). Then for alpha, 30*10=300 pairs, which is 25 dozen. But the table says 10 dozen, so that's inconsistent.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. The question is about technical efficiency, which is about producing the maximum output possible given the inputs. So technically efficient means that there's no way to produce more output with the same inputs, which aligns with the production function.

But given that all the methods are stated to produce 10 dozen, but according to the production function S=sqrt(WM), they should produce much less, perhaps the data in the table is correct, but the production function is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the production function. Let me check the question again.

The production function
