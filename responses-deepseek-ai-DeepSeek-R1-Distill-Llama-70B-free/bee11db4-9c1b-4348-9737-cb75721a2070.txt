Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Anna confusing "who" and "whom." She wants to correct her mistake, and the question is asking which reference material will best help her. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that "who" and "whom" are both pronouns, but they're used differently. "Who" is the subject pronoun, like when someone is doing the action, and "whom" is the object pronoun, used when someone is receiving the action. But I'm not 100% confident about the exact rules, so maybe Anna needs a resource that explains grammar rules clearly.

Looking at the options, there are several reference materials listed. Let me go through each one and think about what they're used for.

Option A is a grammar guide. That sounds promising because grammar guides are all about the rules of language, including correct usage of words like "who" and "whom." They probably have sections explaining the difference, maybe with examples.

Option B is a glossary. Glossaries usually explain terms, often specific to a certain field or book. They might not go into depth about grammar rules, so maybe not the best choice here.

Option C is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias provide general knowledge on a wide range of topics, but they're not focused on language rules. Unless Anna is looking for examples in context, but I think a grammar guide would be better.

Option D is a style guide. Style guides, like the Chicago Manual of Style or AP Stylebook, do address grammar and usage. They might have sections on commonly confused words, so this could be a good option too. But I'm not sure if it's more detailed than a grammar guide.

Option E is a concordance. Concordances are like indexes of words, often used with religious texts or literature to find where certain words appear. Not really relevant to grammar rules.

Option F is a bibliography. That's just a list of sources or references, so it doesn't help with usage.

Option G is a thesaurus. Thesauruses help find synonyms, so if Anna was looking for alternative words, but not for correcting grammar mistakes.

Option H is a biography. That's about someone's life, so not relevant here.

Option I is a dictionary. Dictionaries define words but don't usually explain the grammatical differences between "who" and "whom." They might have usage notes, but perhaps not as detailed as a grammar guide.

Option J is an atlas. Atlases are for maps, so definitely not relevant.

So now I'm between A, D, and I. A dictionary might have some usage notes, but I think a grammar guide is specifically designed to explain such rules in depth. A style guide might also cover this, but maybe not as thoroughly as a dedicated grammar guide. So I think the best choice is A: a grammar guide.

The best reference material to help Anna correct her confusion between "who" and "whom" is a grammar guide because it provides detailed explanations of grammatical rules and usage.
