Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, specifically about uranium-238 emitting an alpha particle. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this, but I'm a little fuzzy on the details, so let me think through it.

Alright, I remember that when a nucleus undergoes alpha decay, it emits an alpha particle. An alpha particle is a helium nucleus, right? So it's two protons and two neutrons. That means when an atom emits an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by 2 because it's losing two protons. And the mass number decreases by 4 since the alpha has a mass of 4 (2 protons + 2 neutrons).

The question is about uranium-238. Uranium's atomic number is 92, I think. So if it emits an alpha, the new element will have an atomic number of 90. What element has atomic number 90? Oh yeah, that's thorium. So the new element is thorium.

Now for the mass number. Uranium-238 has a mass number of 238. Subtracting 4 for the alpha particle gives 234. So the resulting isotope should be thorium-234.

Wait, let me double-check the options. Looking at the options:

Option H is thorium-234. That matches what I just calculated. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers.

Uranium-238 (U-238) → emits alpha (He-4) → becomes Th-234. Yes, because 238 - 4 = 234. And the atomic number goes from 92 to 90, which is thorium.

So the correct answer should be option H.

When a nucleus of uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay, it emits an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This results in a decrease of 2 in the atomic number (from 92 to 90) and a decrease of 4 in the mass number (from 238 to 234). The element with atomic number 90 is thorium, so the resulting isotope is thorium-234.

Among the given options, the correct answer is **thorium-234**, which corresponds to option H.
