Question:

A deed executed by a grantor conveyed his property for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, "to my brother for life, then to the heirs of my brother. " A life interest in the property for the life of the brother is worth $20,000 on the date of the conveyance. The total worth of the property is $50,000. The brother accepted but didn't record the deed. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. "Four years later, the grantor purported to convey his property in fee simple absolute to his two sons, by a warranty deed, as a gift. The two sons recorded the deed. Shortly thereafter, the brother ascertained that the grantor's sons were about to take possession of the property. As a consequence, the brother promptly recorded his deed. In a dispute between the brother and the grantor's children as to the ownership of the property, if the brother prevails it will be because

Options:

A: the brother paid valuable consideration for his deed.
B: the grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children.
C: the brother is the grantor's sibling.
D: the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute.

F: the brother had a life interest in the property.
G: the brother recorded his deed before the grantor's children sought to oust him from the land.
H: the brother's deed was not void due to the recording statute.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about property conveyance and recording statutes. Let me start by breaking down the facts step by step.

First, the grantor executes a deed conveying his property. The consideration is one dollar, and he acknowledges receipt. The conveyance is "to my brother for life, then to the heirs of my brother." So the brother gets a life estate, and after the brother dies, it goes to his heirs. The life interest is worth $20,000, and the total property is $50,000. 

The brother accepted the deed but didn't record it. Now, the recording statute in this jurisdiction says that unless an instrument is recorded, it's void as to subsequent purchasers who pay value and have no notice. So if someone else buys the property without knowing about the prior deed, the prior deed is void against them.

Four years later, the grantor conveys the same property in fee simple absolute to his two sons by a warranty deed as a gift. The sons recorded their deed. Then, when the brother finds out the sons are about to take possession, he records his deed.

The question is who owns the property nowâ€”the brother or the sons?

So the key points here are the recording statute and the order of events. Let's think about the recording statute. It's a notice or a race-notice statute? The wording is "void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice." So it's probably a notice statute because it protects subsequent purchasers who pay value and have no notice.

The grantor first conveys to the brother but doesn't record. Then he conveys to the sons, who do record. But the sons took as a gift, so they didn't pay value. The statute requires that the subsequent purchaser pays value. So if the sons didn't pay anything, they might not be protected.

Wait, but the sons recorded their deed. However, the brother didn't record until after the sons had already recorded. But the brother's deed was delivered four years before, but not recorded until after the sons recorded. 

Wait, let me clarify the timeline. Grantor to brother: deed delivered but not recorded. Four years later, grantor conveys to sons as a gift, sons record. Then brother records his deed. So the sons recorded before the brother did. But since the sons took without paying value (it's a gift), do they qualify as subsequent purchasers under the statute?

The statute says "subsequent purchasers who paid value." So if the sons didn't pay value, they aren't covered by the statute. Therefore, the brother's prior unrecorded deed would still be valid against the sons because the sons didn't pay value. 

Alternatively, if the sons are considered bona fide purchasers (BFPs), they might have protection. But BFPs have to pay value without notice. Here, the sons took as a gift, so they didn't pay value. So they don't meet the requirements of the statute. Hence, the brother's deed, even though recorded later, would still be valid because the sons aren't protected by the statute.

Wait, but the brother recorded after the sons. But since the sons didn't pay value, their recording doesn't give them priority. Instead, the brother's deed, when recorded, would take priority over the sons' deed because the sons aren't protected. Or does the brother's recording after the sons matter?

Wait, no, the recording statute determines the priority. If the brother's deed was unrecorded, it's void against subsequent purchasers for value without notice. But since the sons didn't pay value, they aren't such purchasers. So the brother's interest isn't void as to the sons. Therefore, the brother's deed remains valid, and the sons' deed from the grantor doesn't affect it.

So the brother prevails because the sons aren't protected by the recording statute. Looking at the options, that would be option D: the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D says that. So the correct answer should be D.

The question revolves around a property dispute between a brother and the grantor's sons, focusing on the recording statute and its implications. The grantor first conveyed the property to the brother for life, creating a life estate worth $20,000, with the remainder to the brother's heirs. The brother accepted the deed but did not record it. Four years later, the grantor conveyed the same property to his two sons as a gift, and the sons recorded their deed. When the brother learned of the sons' intent to take possession, he promptly recorded his deed.

The recording statute in this jurisdiction provides that unrecorded instruments are void as to subsequent purchasers who pay value and have no notice. The sons, however, took the property as a gift and did not pay value. Since the statute protects only subsequent purchasers who pay value, the sons do not qualify for protection under the statute. As a result, the brother's unrecorded deed remains valid against the sons, even though he recorded it after the sons recorded theirs.

The brother prevails because the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute, as they did not pay value for the property. This aligns with option D.
