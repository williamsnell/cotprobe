Question:

In one month at a public health clinic, 70 patients were found to have the same inherited disorder; 55 were males and 15 were females. Assuming a 1:1 ratio for males versus females , use the chi-square (X^2) test to determine if any association of the disease with the male sex is statistically significant .

Options:

A: The association of the condition with the male sex is statistically significant at some levels but not at others
B: The association of the condition with the female sex is highly significant
C: Not enough information to determine the association
D: There is no association between the condition and the male sex
E: The association of the condition with the female sex is significant
F: The condition is equally prevalent among both sexes, indicating no statistical significance
G: There is an association between the condition and both sexes, but it is stronger in males
H: The difference in the condition's occurrence between males and females is due to chance
I: The association of the condition with the male sex is significant, but not highly significant
J: The association of the condition with the male sex is highly significant

Okay, so I have this statistics question here about using the chi-square test to determine if there's a significant association between an inherited disorder and the male sex. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question says that in one month, 70 patients were found to have the same inherited disorder. Out of these, 55 were males and 15 were females. The expected ratio is 1:1 for males to females, which means we're assuming equal distribution unless the data shows otherwise.

I remember that the chi-square test is used to determine whether there's a significant difference between the expected and observed data. So, in this case, we're testing if the observed numbers (55 males, 15 females) differ significantly from what's expected under a 1:1 ratio.

Let me think about how to set this up. Since we're dealing with a 2x2 table (two categories: males and females, two rows: observed and expected), the chi-square formula would apply here. The formula is X² = Σ [(O - E)² / E], where O is the observed frequency and E is the expected frequency.

So, calculating the expected values first. The total is 70 patients. If the ratio is 1:1, then expected males would be 70 * (1/2) = 35, and same for females, 35 each.

Now, the observed values are 55 males and 15 females. Let's plug these into the formula.

For males: O =55, E=35. So, (55-35)^2 /35 = (20)^2 /35 = 400/35 ≈11.4286.

For females: O=15, E=35. (15-35)^2 /35 = (-20)^2 /35 = 400/35 ≈11.4286.

Adding both together gives X² ≈ 22.857.

Wait, what's the next step? Oh right, we need to determine the degrees of freedom. For a 2x2 table, degrees of freedom (df) is (rows-1)*(columns-1) = (2-1)*(2-1)=1.

Now, we compare the calculated chi-square value to the critical value from the chi-square distribution table. The critical value depends on the significance level (alpha) and the degrees of freedom.

Assuming the question is using a 0.05 significance level, which is common. Looking up df=1, the critical value at 0.05 is about 3.841. Oh wait, our calculated X² is 22.857, which is way higher than 3.841. So this means the p-value is much less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance.

But wait, what's the conclusion? Since the X² is higher than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis here is that there's no association between the disease and sex; in other words, males and females are equally likely to have the disorder.

So rejecting the null would mean that the observed association is statistically significant. That suggests that the disease is associated with the male sex.

Looking at the options, option J says the association with male is highly significant. But what's the cutoff for 'highly' significant? Typically, a p-value below 0.01 is considered highly significant. Let me check the chi-square critical values again. For df=1, the 0.01 critical value is about 6.635. Oh wait, our X² is 22.857, which is way above 6.635. So the p-value is less than 0.01, meaning it's highly significant.

So the correct answer would be that the association with male is highly significant. Looking at the options, option J says exactly that.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Sometimes I might mix up the formula. So O for males is 55, E is 35. (55-35)=20, squared is 400. 400/35 is about 11.4286. Same for females, (15-35)= -20, squared 400, divided by 35 is same. So sum is 22.857. Yep, that's correct.

Another point: the chi-square test assumes that expected values are at least 5. Here, E is 35 for each, which is well above 5, so no problem with that assumption.

So, yeah, the conclusion is that the association is highly significant. So the answer should be option J.

To determine if there is a statistically significant association between the inherited disorder and the male sex, we use the chi-square test. The observed data shows 55 males and 15 females out of 70 patients, while the expected ratio under a 1:1 distribution is 35 males and 35 females.

The chi-square formula is:

\[
X^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
\]

For males:  
\[
O = 55, \, E = 35, \, \frac{(55 - 35)^2}{35} = \frac{400}{35} \approx 11.4286
\]

For females:  
\[
O = 15, \, E = 35, \, \frac{(15 - 35)^2}{35} = \frac{400}{35} \approx 11.4286
\]

Adding these gives:  
\[
X^2 \approx 11.4286 + 11.4286 = 22.857
\]

The degrees of freedom (df) for a 2x2 table is:  
\[
df = (2-1)(2-1) = 1
\]

Comparing the calculated \(X^2 = 22.857\) to the critical value from the chi-square distribution table at \(df = 1\):  
- At \(\alpha = 0.05\), the critical value is 3.841. Since \(22.857 > 3.841\), the result is statistically significant.  
- At \(\alpha = 0.01\), the critical value is 6.635. Since \(22.857 > 6.635\), the result is highly significant.

Thus, the association between the disorder and the male sex is highly significant. This conclusion aligns with option J.
