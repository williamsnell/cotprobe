Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the economic activities that led to rising immigration, which in turn caused a specific law to be enacted. The question refers to two passages, one from the Australian Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 and the other from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States. 

The question is asking which economic activity drove the rising levels of immigration that led to the second passage, which is the Chinese Exclusion Act. So I need to focus on the factors that caused increased immigration to the U.S., specifically from China, leading up to 1882.

I know that the Chinese Exclusion Act was a response to the significant influx of Chinese immigrants, particularly during the mid-19th century. Many Chinese came to the U.S. for work, especially in industries that were expanding rapidly and required a lot of labor.

Looking at the options given, they are all different economic activities. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Iron smelting. That's part of the metal industry, but I don't recall it being a major draw for Chinese immigration. It's more about processing iron ore, which might have been growing but perhaps not the biggest factor.

Option B: Fertilizer harvesting. I'm not too sure about this one. Fertilizers are more related to agriculture, but I don't think it was a major industry that pulled in a lot of immigrants at that time.

Option C: Coal mining. Coal was definitely a big industry, especially with the expansion of railroads and industrialization. But again, I'm not certain if coal mining was the primary reason for Chinese immigration.

Option D: Fur trading. That was more prominent in earlier centuries, like the 18th and early 19th, with the decline of fur-bearing animals and Native American relations. Probably not the main driver by the late 1800s.

Option E: Cotton farming. The cotton industry was huge, especially in the Southern states, but after the Civil War, many African Americans were freed and worked as sharecroppers. I don't think Chinese immigrants were primarily brought in for cotton farming on a large scale.

Option F: Tobacco cultivation. Similar to cotton, it's an agricultural product but again, I'm not sure it's the main reason for the Chinese immigration wave.

Option G: Silk production. Silk production is more associated with China itself, not the U.S. The U.S. wasn't a major silk producer at that time, so this might not be relevant.

Option H: Sugarcane production. Sugarcane plantations were present in places like Hawaii and the Southern U.S., but again, I'm not certain if this was the main draw for Chinese laborers in the 1800s.

Option I: Railroad construction. Ah, this rings a bell. The construction of the transcontinental railroad in the U.S. during the 1860s and 1870s required a massive workforce. The Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads hired thousands of Chinese workers to build the tracks under harsh conditions. This influx of workers led to increased tensions and anti-Chinese sentiment, which culminated in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.

Option J: Gold mining. The California Gold Rush of 1849 did attract a lot of Chinese immigrants. They came as prospectors, but many faced discrimination and were forced into other jobs. While gold mining was a significant factor in the initial wave, the larger and more sustained factor was probably the railroad construction, which employed more people over a longer period.

So putting it together, while gold mining was a factor, the major economic activity driving immigration that led to the Chinese Exclusion Act was railroad construction. The large-scale hiring of Chinese laborers for the railroads brought in so many workers that it sparked the political backlash resulting in the Exclusion Act.

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was primarily driven by the significant influx of Chinese immigrants who came to the United States to work on the construction of the transcontinental railroad. This massive infrastructure project, undertaken in the 1860s and 1870s, required a large and cheap labor force, which was largely filled by Chinese workers. While other economic activities, such as gold mining during the California Gold Rush, also attracted Chinese immigrants, the sustained and large-scale employment in railroad construction was the key factor that led to the rising immigration levels and subsequent anti-Chinese sentiment. This backlash ultimately resulted in the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act.
