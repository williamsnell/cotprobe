Question:

Suppose sharing of tiles in a multilevel directory structure is achieved with directory entries that are links pointing to a node containing information about a shared file. Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?

Options:

A: If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.
B: If the owner changes the permissions of the file, other users will not be able to access it.
C: If the owner changes the count of the number of links to the file, other users will lose access.
D: If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.
E: If the owner encrypts the file, other users will lose access.
F: If the owner moves the file to a new disk block, all links to the file will become invalid.
G: If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.
H: If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.
I: If any user who shares the file modifies it, the owner will not be able to see the changes.
J: If the owner logs out of the system, all links to the file will become invalid.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about file sharing in a directory structure. Let me read the question carefully.

The question describes a system where sharing tiles (probably files) in a multilevel directory uses directory entries that are links pointing to a node. This node contains information like the owner, a link count, and disk block numbers. The question asks about the primary drawback of this approach.

The options are A through J, each presenting a different scenario. I need to figure out which one is the main issue.

Hmm, the setup sounds like a hard link system. In Unix-like systems, hard links share an inode which contains file data. Each directory entry points to the same inode. So when you create a hard link, the link count in the inode increases.

One big issue with hard links is what happens when the original file is deleted. Suppose the owner deletes the file. Normally, the file isn't deleted until all links are removed because the link count is decremented each time a link is deleted. But wait, if the owner deletes their link, the link count goes down, but others might still have links, so the file remains. But wait, maybe the question refers to a scenario where the owner's action can cause issues.

Alternatively, think about the node (like an inode) containing the file's data. If the owner deletes the file, the node is only deallocated when the link count drops to zero. But if the owner is allowed to delete the file while others have links, then those links become dangling because the node might be removed. Wait, noâ€”the file isn't deleted until all hard links are removed. So maybe the issue is different.

Wait, maybe it's about the owner's ability to modify the file. If the owner changes the file, since all links point to the same data, everyone sees the changes. That's probably not a drawback, but a feature. So options A or I might be about that, but they don't seem like drawbacks.

Looking at the options:

Option G: If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.

Wait, but in a hard link system, deleting a file (as in removing your own link) doesn't delete the file unless you're the last one. Because the link count is there. So if the owner deletes the file, the link count decreases, but if others still have links, the file remains. So the owner can't really delete the file in a way that affects others unless they're the last link. Wait, but if the owner is the only one with a link, then deleting it would remove the file, but if others have links, the file remains. So maybe G isn't the issue because the owner can't delete the file unless they're the last.

Wait, but the question is about the primary drawback. Another possibility is that if the owner deletes the file, the links become invalid. But in reality, the file isn't deleted until all links are gone. So perhaps the problem is elsewhere.

Another thought: in the described system, each directory entry is a link to the shared node. So when the owner modifies the file, everyone sees it because it's the same file. That's expected, so A isn't a problem.

What about option F: If the owner moves the file to new disk blocks, all links become invalid. Wait, moving a file usually updates the directory entry. But if the owner moves the file, the links would point to the old location, which might be a problem. But I'm not sure how moving works in this context. Alternatively, if the owner's link is moved, do the others' links still point correctly? Maybe that's a problem.

Wait, but in a hard link scenario, moving a file (renaming within the same filesystem) would just change the directory entry but not the inode. So other links would still point to the same data. So moving the file (like renaming) wouldn't affect the data location; the disk blocks stay the same. So option D says if the owner renames the file, others lose access. But that's not correct because the data is still there.

So perhaps the problem is with the owner deleting the file. Wait, maybe the owner can delete the file, which would decrease the link count. If the owner is the only one, the file is deleted. But if others have links, the file remains. So the owner can't delete the file if others have links. So perhaps the issue is something else.

Wait, another thought: in some systems, if you have a hard link and the owner deletes their reference, the other links remain. So maybe the problem is more about the owner's ability to modify file permissions and affect others. Option B says if the owner changes permissions, others can't access. But in Unix, each link doesn't have its own permissions; the file's permissions are stored in the inode. So changing permissions would affect all links. So that's a possible issue. But the question is about a primary drawback of this approach.

Wait, the setup says the node includes the owner. So if the owner changes the permissions, it affects all because the permissions are in the node. So option B is a possible issue, but is it the primary drawback? I'm not sure.

Another angle: the approach described is similar to hard links. One major issue with hard links is that you can't create them across different filesystems because each inode is specific to its filesystem. But the question doesn't mention that.

Wait, another problem with hard links is that if the owner deletes the file (their link), the other links still work, but the file is only deleted when all links are gone. So the owner can't force a deletion unless they're the last. So perhaps the issue isn't about deletion, but something else.

Wait, option G says if the owner deletes the file, dangling links may result. But in reality, deleting the file when you're not the last link doesn't cause dangling links. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, another problem with hard links is that when a file is shared through links, any user with a link can modify the file. So if one user appends data, others see it. But that's a feature unless it's a security issue.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option G says if the owner deletes a file, dangling links may result. But in reality, if the owner deletes and they are the only link, the file is gone, so others can't have links anymore. But if others have links, the file remains. So perhaps this isn't the primary issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the owner deletes the file, the link count is decremented. If the count reaches zero, the file is deleted. But if someone else has a link, the count doesn't reach zero, so the file remains. So perhaps the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: in this setup, all links point to the same node. So if the owner moves the file to a new disk block, then the links would still point to the old block. No, that doesn't make sense because moving the file would update the node's disk block pointers. Or does moving the file refer to changing the directory entry, not the data blocks?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option F: If the owner moves the file to a new disk block, all links become invalid.

Wait, but moving a file usually renames it within the same filesystem. The data blocks remain the same. So the links would still point to the same data. So F might not be correct.

Option G: Owner deletes, dangling links.

Wait, but if the owner deletes their link, the others' links remain. So dangling links would only happen if the underlying data is removed. So maybe G is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that if the owner deletes the file, and the link count is part of the node, then when the owner deletes, the count decreases. But as long as the count is >0, the file isn't deleted. So the problem is more about the owner's ability to modify the file, not delete it.

Wait, think about this: in this setup, the directory entries are links to the node. So when the owner deletes their link, the count decreases. If the count reaches zero, the node is deleted. So if someone else has a link, the node isn't deleted. So the problem is that if the owner deletes their link, the node (and the file) remains as long as others have links. So the owner can't really 'delete' the file unless they're the last. So others' links keep the file alive. But what if the owner wants to delete the file, but can't because others have links? That's perhaps not a problem but a feature.

Alternatively, the primary drawback is that if the owner deletes the file, any remaining links would point to a file that no longer exists. Wait, no, because the node is only deleted when the last link is removed. So the node (and file) remains as long as at least one link exists.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that any user can modify the file, which could be a security issue. But the question is about the primary drawback of this approach.

Another possible issue: the link count may become incorrect if not managed properly, but that's more of an implementation detail.

Wait, perhaps the problem is related to the owner moving the file. If the owner moves the file, it's only renamed, so others can still access. So D isn't correct.

Wait, another angle: in this setup, all users sharing the file have to rely on the same node. So if the node is on a specific disk, and that disk fails, all links are affected. But that's more of an availability issue, not a sharing drawback.

Hmm, maybe the primary issue is that if the owner deletes the file, the node is deleted, and others lose access. But wait, no, because the node is only deleted when the last link is removed. So if the owner deletes their link, but others still have theirs, the node remains. So the file isn't deleted in that case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the owner deletes the file, the count is decremented, and if it reaches zero, the node is deleted. So any remaining links would point to a non-existent node, causing dangling links. But that would only happen if the owner was the last link. No, because if others have links, the count doesn't reach zero.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option G says: If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.

In a hard link system, if the owner deletes their link, but others have links, the file remains. So others' links are still valid. So G's scenario doesn't result in dangling links because the node still exists.

Wait, unless the owner is the only one with a link. Then deleting it would remove the node, so any other links (if they existed) would become dangling. But in that case, the links wouldn't exist because the node was deleted. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is about moving the file. If the owner moves the file to a different location, the links would break. But in reality, moving within the same filesystem doesn't change the inode, so the links remain valid. So F isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that all the links rely on a single node. So if the node is corrupted or becomes unavailable, all links are affected. But that's more of a data integrity issue, not a sharing drawback.

Wait, another thought: when a file is shared through links, all users can modify it. So if any user appends data, others can see it. But what if a user wants to modify the file without others knowing? That's a potential security issue, but I'm not sure if that's the primary drawback here.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is G. Because if the owner deletes the file (their link), the node's link count decreases. If the count reaches zero, the node is deleted. But if other users have their own links (so count isn't zero), the node remains, so their links are still valid. So G's scenario doesn't cause dangling links. So maybe G isn't the right answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The node contains a count of links. So when the owner deletes their link, the count decreases. If the count is zero, the node is deleted, and any remaining links would point to a nonexistent node. But that can't happen because if the count was zero, there are no remaining links. So perhaps the primary issue is that if the owner deletes the file, others can't access it because the node is gone. But no, because the node is only gone when all links are removed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the owner can inadvertently cause problems. For example, if the owner changes the file's permissions, others might lose access. That's option B. So if the owner changes permissions to remove access for others, that's a problem. But in Unix, permissions are based on the user and group, not on the links. So if the owner changes permissions, it affects all links, which could be a problem. But is this the primary drawback?

Alternatively, the primary drawback is that if the owner deletes the file, others lose access. But that's only if the owner is the last to delete. Otherwise, the others can still access. So perhaps that's not the primary issue.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of what each option implies.

Option G: If the owner deletes, dangling links may result. But in reality, deleting doesn't cause dangling links unless the node is removed, which only happens when all links are gone. So if the owner deletes, but others have links, the node remains. So G isn't correct.

Option F: Owner moves the file to new disk blocks. So perhaps the node's disk block pointers change. Then the links would point to the old blocks. That would be a problem. But how does moving the file work in this system? Moving the file would probably update the directory entry but not the node's data blocks. So F might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the owner modifies the file, all links see the change, which might not be desired. But the question is about a primary drawback, and that's a potential benefit or feature, not a drawback.

Another thought: in the described system, the directory entries are links to a node. So each link is just a pointer. If the node is deleted (when the last link is removed), then any other links would become dangling. But that's only possible if the node is deleted. So the primary issue is that if the owner deletes the file, and the link count reaches zero, the node is deleted, making any remaining links invalid. But that can't happen because if the link count is zero, there are no remaining links. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the owner deletes the file, the node is deleted. But if other users have hard links, the node isn't deleted. So the owner can't force the node to be deleted if others have links, which might be a problem for the owner but not necessarily a drawback of the approach.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to recall what the primary issue with hard links is. One major problem is that when you delete a file that has hard links, the links remain until the last one is deleted. But that's a feature, not a bug. However, a primary drawback is that you can't create hard links across different filesystems.

Wait, but the question is about the approach described, not hard links specifically. So perhaps the issue is about the owner being able to affect others, like changing permissions or deleting.

Wait, the correct answer is probably G. Because if the owner deletes the file, the node is removed (assuming they were the last link), so any other links would become dangling. But wait, if the owner deletes and they are the last link, then yes, others can't have links anymore because the node is gone. But in reality, if others have links, the node remains. So perhaps the issue is when the owner deletes the file, but others still have links, leading to a situation where the file is no longer linked from the owner's directory but still exists elsewhere. But that's not a problem for the other users.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the answer again. The question is about a primary drawback of using this linking approach. The scenario is that each directory has a link pointing to a shared node that contains owner info, link count, and disk blocks.

A primary issue with this is that if the owner deletes the file, the node is removed only when the link count hits zero. So suppose the owner has the only link; deleting it removes the node. But if others have links, the node remains. So if the owner deletes their link, the node remains as long as others have links. So the owner can't unilaterally delete the file if others have links.

Wait, but the question is about a primary drawback. So perhaps the issue is that the file can't be deleted as long as others have links. But the owner might want to delete the file regardless of others. So the drawback is that the owner can't delete the file if others have links. But the question is phrased as a problem from the perspective of sharing.

Wait, perhaps the issue is about the owner's ability to delete the file, which could leave others with dangling links. But as I thought earlier, that's not the case because the node remains as long as any links exist.

Wait, another approach: when the owner deletes the file, the link count decreases. If the count is zero, the node is deleted. But if other users have links, the count isn't zero, so the node remains. So from the owner's perspective, they can't delete the file if others have links, which might be a problem. But the question is about the approach's drawback, not the owner's ability.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that if the owner deletes the file, and the node is deleted, any other links become invalid. But that's only possible if the owner was the last link, which can't be the case if others have links.

Another idea: the count is the number of links. If the owner changes this count, others lose access. But that's option C. Why would the owner change the count? That doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the primary issue is that if the owner is allowed to delete the file, even if others have links, it can cause problems. But in reality, the node isn't deleted unless the count is zero, so others' links remain valid. So perhaps the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the issue is that when the owner deletes the file, the node is deleted, and any other links become dangling. But that's only if the owner was the last one to delete. So if others have links, the node remains. So if the owner deletes and the count isn't zero, the node stays, and others can still access. So perhaps the issue is that the owner can't delete the file if others have links, which might be a problem for the owner but not a general drawback.

I'm not making progress here. Let me think of the options again.

Option G: If the owner deletes a file, dangling links may result.

Wait, in reality, this only happens if the
