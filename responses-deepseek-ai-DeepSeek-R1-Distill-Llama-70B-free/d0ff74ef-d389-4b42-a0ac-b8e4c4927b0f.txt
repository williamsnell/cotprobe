Question:

A well-established paper mill and a logging company signed a written contract in which the mill agreed to buy from the company all the logs the mill would need for one year. The company was unable to keep up with the mill's needs, and its log deliveries fell short by 10% to 15% in each of the four quarters of the year. The mill paid the company on time for all delivered logs. The mill paid an attorney $2,000 for advice concerning its options in enforcing the contract. It paid a broker a reasonable fee of $5,000 to find additional logs to make up for the company's shortfall. The mill also incurred reasonable costs of $25,000 to transport the additional logs to its facility. Despite the mill's efforts to mitigate damages, it sustained $200,000 in losses because of the company's failure to timely deliver enough logs. The mill has sued the company for breach of contract. If the court finds for the mill, how much should it award in damages?

Options:

A: $205,000.00
B: $220,000.00
C: $225,000.00
D: $240,000.00
E: $200,000.00
F: $230,000.00
G: $232,000.00
H: $250,000.00
I: $235,000.00
J: $210,000.00

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the correct damages the mill should be awarded. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: a paper mill and a logging company have a written contract where the mill agrees to buy all the logs it needs for a year from the company. But the logging company didn't meet the mill's needs—deliveries were short by 10-15% each quarter. The mill paid for the logs they did receive on time. Now, the mill is suing for breach of contract, and the question is about the damages.

So, the mill incurred some costs because of the logging company's failure. They paid an attorney $2k for advice, a broker $5k to find more logs, and $25k to transport those additional logs. Despite all this, the mill still had a $200k loss. The question is, how much should the court award?

I remember that in contract law, the goal of damages is to put the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in if the contract had been fulfilled. So the mill should be compensated for the losses they suffered because of the breach, but they also have a duty to mitigate those damages.

Let me think about the different expenses:

1. Attorney fees: $2,000. Wait, are attorney's fees recoverable in contract cases? I think generally, each party bears their own attorney fees unless the contract says otherwise. Since the question doesn't mention the contract allowing for attorney fees, probably these aren't recoverable as part of the damages. So maybe we shouldn't include the $2k.

2. Broker fee: $5,000. This was to find additional logs to make up for the shortfall. That seems like a reasonable cost incurred to mitigate the damages. So this should be recoverable.

3. Transportation costs: $25,000. Again, this is a cost to obtain replacement logs, so it's part of the mitigation and should be included.

4. The $200k loss they sustained despite mitigation. That would be their actual loss from not having enough logs—maybe lost profits or additional costs beyond what they could recover by buying elsewhere.

So adding up the broker fee, transportation, and the $200k loss: $5k + $25k = $30k, plus $200k is $230k.

Wait, but some might think that the $200k is the net loss after considering the mitigation. So the total damages would be the sum of the mitigation costs plus the net loss. So that would be $200k + $30k = $230k.

Looking at the options, option F is $230,000. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, the measure is the difference between the contract price and the market price when obtaining substitutes. But in this case, the mill had to pay a broker and transport, which are part of the additional costs. Those should be recoverable. So yes, adding those to the loss makes sense.

I think the answer is F.

The court should award damages that place the mill in the position it would have been in had the contract been fulfilled. The mill incurred costs to mitigate the logging company's breach, including a broker fee of $5,000 and transportation costs of $25,000, both of which are recoverable. Additionally, the mill sustained a $200,000 loss despite its efforts to mitigate. Attorney fees of $2,000 are not recoverable unless explicitly provided for in the contract, which is not mentioned here. Therefore, the total damages are $230,000.

F: $230,000.00

Answer: F
