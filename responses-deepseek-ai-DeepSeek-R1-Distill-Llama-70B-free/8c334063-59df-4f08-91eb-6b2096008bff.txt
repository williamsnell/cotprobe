Okay, so I've got this question about the suicide rate in Greenland as of 2017. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage, but I remember hearing that Greenland has a high suicide rate compared to other countries. Let me think... I recall that some of the highest rates are in places like Lithuania, South Korea, and Guyana. But wait, I'm pretty sure that Greenland, being part of Denmark, has its own unique situation, especially with its indigenous population.

I think the suicide rate in Greenland is particularly high among young men. Maybe around 5% or more? But wait, the options go up to 9%. Let me try to remember any specific data points. I think I read somewhere that Greenland's suicide rate is one of the highest in the world. Oh right, I think it's something like 8% or so. Wait, but that seems high because when I think about it, most countries have rates below 2% for suicide deaths.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with another country. Let me think differently. I remember that the suicide rate in Greenland is significantly higher than the average. So looking at the options, the higher percentages are E:7.20%, G:9%, I:8.10%, H:6.30%, F:5.40%. So maybe around 8% or 7%. Alternatively, I think the rate might be around 8.1%, which is option I.

But wait, another thought: sometimes these statistics can vary by source and year. Since the question is about 2017, I should consider data from around that time. I think in 2016, there was a report stating that Greenland had a suicide rate of about 8.1 per 100,000 people. Wait, no, that's the rate per 100,000, not the percentage of deaths. Oh wait, the question is about the share of deaths caused by suicide, not the rate per population.

Oh, right, the question is about the percentage of deaths, not the rate per 100,000. So that changes things. If, say, 8% of all deaths in Greenland are due to suicide, that would be a high proportion. But I'm not sure if it's that high. I think the percentage might be around 5-6%. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's 9.00% as in option G. But I'm not certain. Wait, I've read that in some regions, like the Inuit communities, the suicide rate is particularly high, contributing a larger share of overall deaths. So perhaps it's around 8% or 9%.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, the higher ones are E (7.2), I (8.1), G (9.0). I think the correct answer is around 8.1%, which is option I. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the data I remember might be the per capita rate, not the percentage of total deaths.

Alternatively, maybe it's 5.4% (option F), but that seems lower than what I thought. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing it with another country. Wait, I think the correct answer is G:9.00%, but I'm not entirely sure now.

Wait, another angle: I remember that for Greenland, the suicide rate is about 8.1% of all deaths. So that would make option I the correct one. But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, it could be 7.2% (option E) or 9% (G). I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the global average. The global average for suicide as a cause of death is around 1.5-2%. So if Greenland is higher, it's probably 5% or more. So from the options, that would be F (5.4), H (6.3), E (7.2), I (8.1), G (9). I think the correct figure is 8.1%, so option I.

As of 2017, the share of deaths in Greenland attributed to suicide is notably high compared to the global average. After considering various data points and recalling reports about Greenland's unique situation, particularly among its indigenous population, the most plausible figure is around 8.1%. This aligns with the understanding that suicide contributes a significant proportion of total deaths in Greenland, making option I the correct choice.

Answer: I
