Question:

A woman was standing in the aisle of a subway car and put her purse on the seat next to her. A man approached the woman from behind and grabbed the purse off the seat. He then pushed the woman out of the way and ran out of the subway car while carrying the purse. The man was apprehended on the subway platform while in possession of the purse. In a jurisdiction that follows the common law with respect to criminal offenses, of what crime can the man properly be convicted?

Options:

A: Fraud, because he took the purse without the woman's consent.
B: Larceny, because he took the purse without the woman's permission.
C: Burglary, because he entered the subway car with the intention of committing a theft.
D: Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.
E: Robbery, because he used force to take possession of the purse.
F: Robbery, because he used force to remove the woman from the purse's vicinity.
G: Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse.
H: Assault, because he pushed the woman out of the way.
I: Larceny, because he made no threat to use force.
J: Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically about different offenses. Let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the scenario is a woman in a subway car. She puts her purse on the seat next to her. A man comes from behind, grabs the purse, pushes her out of the way, and runs with the purse. He's caught on the platform with the purse. The question is, what crime is he guilty of in a common law jurisdiction.

Let's go through the options. The possible crimes here are larceny, robbery, burglary, fraud, assault, etc.

First, I remember that larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. So the man took the purse without consent, which sounds like larceny.

But then there's robbery. Robbery is larceny plus the use of force or fear. So if the force happens at the time of taking the property, it's robbery. If the force is after, like chasing someone down after stealing, maybe that's not robbery but something else.

In this case, the man pushed the woman out of the way as he grabbed the purse. So he used force to take the purse. Wait, but did he push her before or after taking the purse? The way it's phrased, he grabbed the purse and then pushed her. Hmm. So the force might have been simultaneous or part of the taking.

Wait, under common law, robbery requires a taking with force or fear at the time of the taking. So if the force is used to take the property, it's robbery. If he took the purse and then pushed her while escaping, maybe that's just larceny plus assault, not robbery.

Wait, but in this situation, the force was used in the course of taking the purse. Because he pushed her out of the way while grabbing it. So perhaps that's enough for robbery.

Also, I think that under common law, robbery requires the taking to be from the person or their presence. So if the purse was on the seat next to her, that's in her presence. So that fits robbery.

So the elements for robbery would be: (1) taking and carrying away (asportation), (2) of the personal property of another, (3) from the person or their presence, (4) by force or fear, (5) with the intent to permanently deprive.

Here, the man took the purse from the seat next to her, which is her presence. He used force by pushing her while taking it. So that should satisfy robbery.

Looking at the options:

Option E says robbery because he used force to take possession. That sounds right. Option D says because he used force in leaving, which might be assault, not robbery. Option F says because he used force to remove the woman from the purse's vicinity. Hmm, but the force was in taking the purse, not just moving her away.

So the correct reasoning is that the force was contemporaneous with the taking, making it robbery. So option E. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, option E: "Robbery, because he used force to take possession of the purse." That fits because the force was part of the act of taking the purse.

Alternatively, option J says robbery because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence. So that's also a possibility, but the key is the force. So J seems to focus on the taking from presence but not the force.

So the correct answer should be E or J. Wait, but the taking is from her presence, so option J is about that. But the key element is the force. So perhaps E is better.

Wait, but in common law robbery, the force must be at the time of the taking. So if he took the purse and then pushed her, that might not be robbery. But in the scenario, he pushed her as he took the purse. So the force was part of the taking.

So E says because he used force to take possession. That makes sense. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but let me think again. Another perspective: larceny is taking without consent, and robbery is larceny with force. So if he took the purse without her consent, that's larceny. But since he also used force, it's robbery.

So the answer should be E.

The scenario involves a man who grabbed a purse from a seat next to a woman in a subway car, pushed her out of the way, and ran off with the purse. The question is to determine the appropriate crime under common law. 

To analyze this, it is important to distinguish between larceny and robbery. Larceny involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. Robbery, however, requires larceny plus the use of force or fear at the time of the taking. Additionally, under common law, robbery requires that the property be taken from the person or their presence.

In this case, the man took the purse from the seat next to the woman, which qualifies as taking from her presence. Furthermore, he used force by pushing her out of the way as he grabbed the purse. This use of force was contemporaneous with the taking, satisfying the requirement for robbery. 

Option E correctly identifies that the man used force to take possession of the purse, which aligns with the elements of robbery under common law. Other options either mischaracterize the timing or nature of the force or fail to address the key elements of robbery.

**Answer: E**
