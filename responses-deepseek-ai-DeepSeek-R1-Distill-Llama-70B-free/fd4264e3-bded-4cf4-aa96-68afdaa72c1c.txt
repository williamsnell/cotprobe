Question:

A professor employed by a state university is a well- known critic of foreign policy and has sometimes publicly stated that he wished for the United States to suffer some collective political tragedy in retribution for all the harms it does to the world. The professor was recently involved in a highly visible political protest against the government. The police eventually shut down the protest because they felt that it was becoming unruly. A television crew covered the entire rally. On the six o'clock news that evening, the film of the protest rally was shown during the broadcast. A news anchorman then made the following commentary: "It's a shame that public funds are spent to pay the salaries of such university professors, who are not grateful for what this country has done for them. In my opinion, these people like the professor should be deported. "If the professor asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the television station and the anchorman for his television commentary, the most likely result is that the professor will

Options:

A: not prevail, because the professor willingly participated in the public protest.
B: prevail, because the anchorman's comments were excessive and unnecessary.
C: not prevail, because the comments were based on the professor's public actions and statements.
D: not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally.
E: prevail, because the comments were intrusive and violated the professor's privacy.
F: prevail, because the professor, as a private individual, was placed in a false light.
G: prevail, because the comments were defamatory and damaged the professor's reputation.
H: not prevail, because the professor's public behavior and statements made him a public figure.
I: prevail, because the comments were made with actual malice.
J: not prevail, because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest.

Okay, so I've got this question about privacy law, specifically invasion of privacy. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The scenario is about a professor who works at a state university. He's a critic of foreign policy and has made some controversial statements wishing for the U.S. to suffer a political tragedy. He was involved in a political protest that got shut down by the police, and it was all covered by a TV crew. The news anchorman then made some comments criticizing the professor, suggesting he should be deported because he's ungrateful and public funds pay his salary.

The professor is claiming invasion of privacy against the TV station and the anchorman. I need to figure out if he'll prevail.

First, I should remember what invasion of privacy entails. I think there are a few types, but the main ones are intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts, and false light privacy. 

In this case, the professor is a public figure because he's a well-known critic and a professor at a state university. Public figures have less privacy protection because their actions and statements are considered newsworthy. 

The protest was public, so anything that happened there is fair game for media coverage. The anchorman's comments were about the professor's public actions and statements. So, the question is whether those comments crossed a line into invasion of privacy.

Looking at the options:

Option A says he won't prevail because he willingly participated in a public protest. That makes sense because by being in a public space, he's subject to coverage. But the anchorman's commentary goes beyond just reporting; it's more of an opinion.

Option B says he'll prevail because the comments were excessive. But I don't think excessiveness alone determines privacy invasion. It's more about whether it's a private fact or false light.

Option C suggests he won't prevail because the comments were based on public actions and statements. This seems relevant because public figures can expect scrutiny on their public conduct.

Option D claims the comments weren't directed personally. But the anchorman specifically mentioned the professor, so that might not apply.

Option E says the comments were intrusive. But the professor's statements were public, so maybe not intrusive in the privacy sense.

Option F is about false light. False light invasion of privacy happens when someone is portrayed in a way that's false and damaging, and the publisher acted with malice. The anchorman's opinion that he should be deported could be seen as putting him in a false light, but again, public figures have a higher bar. They need to prove actual malice, which is knowing falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. Here, the anchorman is expressing an opinion based on the professor's public statements, so it's probably protected.

Option G is about defamation. But the question is about invasion of privacy, not defamation, so maybe this isn't the right path. Plus, defamation would require proving falsity and damages, and as a public figure, he'd need to show actual malice.

Option H states he won't prevail because he's a public figure. Public figures have less expectation of privacy, especially regarding their public actions. So this seems likely.

Option I is about actual malice. Again, that's more for defamation, and the question is about privacy.

Option J says the broadcast was privileged as public interest. Public interest can be a defense, especially when it involves newsworthy events.

So putting it together, the professor is a public figure. The anchorman's comments, though harsh, are about his public actions and statements. The First Amendment protects a lot of this, especially when it's about public figures in public matters. So the professor likely won't prevail because his public status and the nature of the comments don't constitute an invasion of privacy.

Looking back at the options, option H says he won't prevail because he's a public figure. Option C says it's based on public actions. Both seem correct, but I think H is more precise because it's about his status as a public figure, which directly impacts the privacy claim. Public figures can't claim invasion of privacy as easily for public conduct.

Wait, but another angle is whether the anchorman's comments were opinion or fact. Opinion is protected under the First Amendment unless it's presented as fact. The anchorman's statement about deporting the professor is his opinion, so that's protected speech.

So the professor's claim of invasion of privacy would likely fail because he's a public figure, and the comments were about his public actions and opinions. Therefore, the correct answer is either C or H.

Option C: comments based on public actions and statements. Option H: public figure.

Invasion of privacy for public figures usually requires a showing that the matter is a private fact that's highly offensive and not of public concern. Here, the anchorman's comments were about the professor's public behavior, so it's of public concern. Therefore, C and H both seem applicable, but H is more about the status, while C is about the content.

Wait, in the question, the invasion of privacy claim is based on the commentary, not the broadcasting of the protest itself. So the issue is the anchorman's opinion about the professor.

In terms of false light privacy, the elements are: (1) defendant gave publicity to a matter concerning the plaintiff that was false and defamatory, (2) the false light would be highly offensive to a reasonable person and the plaintiff was placed in that light, (3) the defendant acted with knowledge or reckless disregard for the falsity, and (4) the statement caused actual damages.

But again, as a public figure, proving actual malice is tough. The anchorman's opinion may not meet the falsity and malice required.

So back to the options, H says he won't prevail because he's a public figure. That's probably the best fit. Public figures have a higher threshold, and their public conduct is fair game for commentary.

The professor, as a public figure, has a diminished expectation of privacy regarding his public actions and statements. The anchorman's commentary, while critical, focused on the professor's public behavior and statements made during a protest, which are newsworthy and of public interest. Invasion of privacy claims, particularly for public figures, require a showing that the matter is a private fact, highly offensive, and not of public concern. Here, the commentary was based on the professor's public conduct, making it unlikely to constitute an invasion of privacy. Additionally, the First Amendment protects such commentary, especially when it involves public figures and matters of public concern. Therefore, the professor is unlikely to prevail in his invasion of privacy claim.

The best answer is H.
