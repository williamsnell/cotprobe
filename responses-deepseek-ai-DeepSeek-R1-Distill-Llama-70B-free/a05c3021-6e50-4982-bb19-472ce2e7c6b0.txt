Question:

Statistical regression is a potential threat to a study’s internal validity when:

Options:

A: the researcher is unable to randomly assign participants to the different treatment groups.
B: there is a statistically significant difference in the gender distribution among the study's treatment groups.
C: participants are selected for inclusion in the study because of their extremely high or low scores on the pretest.
D: participants are selected for inclusion in the study based on their availability.
E: there is a statistically different number of participants in the study’s treatment groups.
F: the researcher has a personal bias towards a certain result.
G: the study is conducted in a controlled laboratory setting.
H: there is a statistically significant difference in the number of participants who drop out of the different treatment groups during the course of the study.
I: the researcher does not use a control group in the study.
J: the study's data is not normally distributed.

Okay, so I've got this question about statistical regression and internal validity. Hmm, I need to figure out when statistical regression becomes a threat. Let me think.

I remember that internal validity refers to whether a study's results are due to the variables being tested and not other factors. So, threats to internal validity are things that can lead to incorrect conclusions about the causal relationships.

Statistical regression, as I recall, is like when you have extreme scores on a pretest, and then on the posttest, they tend to regress towards the mean. So if you select people because they scored really high or low, their next scores might naturally go back towards average, which could make it look like the treatment had an effect when it didn't.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: Can't randomly assign participants. That's more about selection bias or assignment bias, not regression. So maybe not the right answer.

Option B: Gender distribution difference. That's a confounding variable maybe, but not directly related to regression.

Option C: Participants selected for high or low pretest scores. Oh, that sounds familiar. If you pick people with extreme scores, their next scores will likely be closer to the mean, causing a regression effect. So this could be the answer.

Option D: Availability sampling. That's a selection bias too, but not directly causing regression issues.

Option E: Different numbers of participants. That's more about unequal sample sizes, maybe power issues, but not regression.

Option F: Researcher's personal bias. That's more about experimenter bias or maybe confirmation bias, not directly statistical regression.

Option G: Controlled lab setting. That's actually good for internal validity, so not a threat.

Option H: Dropout differences. That's attrition bias, which is a threat, but not regression.

Option I: No control group. That can be a problem, but again, not about regression.

Option J: Non-normal data. That's about statistical assumptions, maybe affecting the tests used, but not internal validity related to regression.

So the key point is that when participants are selected because of their extreme scores, regression to the mean can make it seem like a treatment had an effect. So the correct answer should be C.

Statistical regression is a threat to internal validity when participants are selected for a study based on their extremely high or low scores on a pretest. This is because such scores tend to regress toward the mean on subsequent measurements, potentially creating the illusion of a treatment effect. Among the options provided, this scenario is best described by **Option C**.
