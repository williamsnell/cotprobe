Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about special relativity, specifically involving time dilation and possibly the simultaneity of events. Hmm, let's see.

So, the setup is that the Earth and the Sun are 8.3 light-minutes apart. Wait, a light-minute is the distance light travels in one minute, right? So that's the distance between them. Now, the problem says to ignore their relative motion and assume they're in a single inertial frame, the Earth-Sun frame. So, in this frame, the Earth and Sun are at rest relative to each other.

Events A and B occur at t=0 on Earth and t=2 minutes on the Sun. So, in the Earth-Sun frame, event A happens on Earth at time zero, and event B happens on the Sun at time two minutes. But wait, are these events simultaneous for this frame? No, because they happen at different times. So, from Earth's frame, the Sun's event B occurs two minutes after Earth's event A.

Now, the question is, what's the time difference between events A and B according to an observer moving at u=0.8c from Earth to Sun? And then the same when moving in the opposite direction at 0.8c.

I remember that in special relativity, when you have events that aren't simultaneous in one frame, their time and order can change in another moving frame. So I think I should use the Lorentz transformation here.

Wait, the Lorentz transformations relate the space and time coordinates in two different inertial frames. The Earth-Sun frame is S, and the moving observer's frame is S'. So I need to find the time difference in S' for the two events.

Let me recall the Lorentz transformations for time and space:

t' = γ (t - (v x)/c²)
x' = γ (x - v t)

Where γ is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.8c, let's compute γ. v is 0.8c, so v²/c² is 0.64. So 1 - 0.64 is 0.36, square root is 0.6, so γ is 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

Wait, 1/0.6 is 5/3, yes, which is approximately 1.6667.

Now, for each event, I'll compute t' for A and t' for B, then find the difference.

First, let's get the coordinates of each event in the Earth-Sun frame (S).

Event A: On Earth at t=0, x=0 (since Earth is at x=0 in S frame).

Event B: On Sun at t=2 minutes, x=8.3 light-minutes (since the Sun is 8.3 light-minutes away from Earth in S).

Wait, but wait. Let me think. In S, Earth is at x=0, Sun at x=8.3 light-minutes. So event B occurs at x=8.3, t=2.

So, for event A: t=0, x=0.

For event B: t=2, x=8.3.

Now, moving observer is moving at u=0.8c from Earth to Sun. So the velocity of S' relative to S is v=0.8c, in the positive x-direction.

So, for each event, compute t' using the Lorentz transformation.

Let me handle event A first.

Event A: t=0, x=0.

So t’_A = γ (t - (v x)/c² )

Plugging in the numbers: γ is 5/3, t=0, x=0.

So t’_A = (5/3)(0 - (0.8c * 0)/c²) )= 0.

So t’_A is zero.

Now, event B: t=2 minutes, x=8.3 light-minutes.

Compute t’_B = γ [ t - (v x) / c² ]

Wait, but let's make sure the units are consistent. Because x is in light-minutes, v is in terms of c, so when I compute (v x), the units should work out. Let me think: v x, with v=0.8c and x=8.3 light-minutes.

Wait, (v x) is 0.8c * 8.3 light-minutes. But since c is 1 light-minute per minute, right? No, wait, wait. Actually, 1 light-minute is the distance light travels in 1 minute. So speed is in light-minutes per minute.

Wait, no: c is 1 light-minute per minute, because in one minute, light travels one light-minute. So, when v is 0.8c, that's 0.8 light-minutes per minute.

So, for event B: x=8.3 light-minutes, v=0.8c = 0.8 light-minutes per minute.

So, (v x) would be 0.8 * 8.3 (light-minutes per minute * light-minutes) = 6.64 light-minute² per minute? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the units so that everything is in terms of minutes and light-minutes.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate (v x)/c².

Since v is 0.8c, and x is 8.3 light-minutes.

So, (v x) = (0.8 c) * (8.3 light-minutes) = 0.8 *8.3 * c * light-minutes.

But c is 1 light-minute per minute, so c * light-minutes = light-minutes² per minute. Hmm, maybe that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, alternatively, let's think about the term (v x)/c². Let me compute it in terms of time.

Because in relativity, the term (v x)/c² should have units of time.

So, x is in meters, v is m/s, but perhaps it's easier to use the fact that 1 light-minute is the distance light travels in a minute.

Wait, perhaps I can express x in light-minutes, v in terms of c, and time in minutes.

So, x = 8.3 light-minutes.

v =0.8c.

So, v x = 0.8c * 8.3 light-minutes.

But c is 1 light-minute per minute, so:

v x = 0.8 * 8.3 * (light-minute per minute) * light-minute.

Wait, that gives 0.8 *8.3 * light-minute² per minute.

But the denominator is c², which is (light-minute per minute)^2.

Wait, so (v x)/c² = [0.8 *8.3 * (light-minute^2 per minute)] / [ (light-minute per minute)^2 ].

The units would be light-minute^2 per minute divided by (light-minute^2 per minute^2) )= minutes.

So, (v x)/c² becomes 0.8 *8.3 * (light-minute^2 per minute) / (light-minute^2 per minute^2) ) = 0.8 * 8.3 * (1/(light-minute per minute)) * light-minute^2 per minute.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just compute it numerically.

v is 0.8c, x is 8.3 light-minutes.

So (v x)/c² = (0.8c * 8.3 light-minutes) / c².

The c's cancel: 0.8 *8.3 * light-minutes / c.

But wait, c is 1 light-minute per minute, so 1/c is 1 minute per light-minute.

So, (v x)/c² = 0.8 *8.3 * light-minutes * (1 minute)/(light-minute).

Wait, 1/(c) is (1 minute per light-minute).

But this would give (v x)/c² = 0.8 *8.3 * (light-minutes) * (1 minute)/(light-minute) ) = 0.8 *8.3 * (light-minutes * 1 minute) / (light-minute) )

Wait, light-minutes in numerator and denominator cancel, leaving (0.8 *8.3) minutes.

So (v x)/c² = 0.8 *8.3 minutes = 6.64 minutes.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.8 *8.3 is 6.64, correct.

So, t’_B = γ (t - (v x)/c² )

t is 2 minutes, so 2 - 6.64 = -4.64 minutes.

Multiply by γ, which is 5/3.

So t’_B = (5/3) * (-4.64) ≈ (5/3)*(-4.64) ≈ -7.7333 minutes.

So, event A is at t’=0, event B at t’≈-7.7333. So the time difference is 0 - (-7.7333) =7.7333 minutes. Wait, but wait, no, because in S', event A occurs at t'=0 and event B at t'≈-7.73, so the time difference would be from B to A, which would be 7.73 minutes. But wait, no, because if B happens at a negative t', and A at zero, then the time between A and B in S' is from B to A, but the problem says "the time difference between the events according to the observer". So perhaps it's the absolute value, so around 7.73 minutes. But none of the options are 7.73, which is approximately 7.73, close to 8. So perhaps option D is 8, which is one of the options.

Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's re-calculate (v x)/c².

v is 0.8c, x is 8.3 light-minutes.

So (v x) = 0.8c *8.3 light-minutes.

But since c is 1 light-minute per minute, so c = 1 light-minute / 1 minute.

So 0.8c = 0.8 light-minutes per minute.

Thus, (v x) = 0.8 light-minutes/minute *8.3 light-minutes = 6.64 (light-minutes)^2 / minute.

Then, (v x)/c² becomes 6.64 (light-minutes)^2 / minute divided by c², which is (light-minutes per minute)^2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of x as meters and t as seconds, but that would involve a lot more steps. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I compute (v x)/c².

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about it this way: (v x) is in units of (distance * velocity). Velocity is distance over time, so (v x) is (distance)^2 / time. Then, dividing by c², which is (distance^2)/(time^2), so (v x)/c² has units of time. So, yes, it's correct.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute in terms of time, using the fact that x is 8.3 light-minutes, and v is 0.8c. So (v x)/c² would be (0.8c *8.3 light-minutes)/c².

Which is 0.8 *8.3 * (c * light-minutes) / c².

But c * light-minutes equals (light-minutes per minute) * light-minutes = (light-minutes)^2 per minute.

Wait, perhaps another way: let's compute (v x)/c² in minutes. Since x is 8.3 light-minutes, and v is 0.8c, which is 0.8 light-minutes per minute.

So, (v x) = 0.8 (light-minutes/minute) *8.3 light-minutes = 6.64 (light-minutes)^2 / minute.

Divide by c², which is (light-minutes/minute)^2.

So, (v x)/c² = [6.64 (light-minutes)^2 / minute] / [ (light-minutes)^2 / minute^2 ) ].

The units become [ (light-minutes)^2 / minute ] * [ minute^2 / (light-minutes)^2 ) ] = minute.

So numerically, 6.64 (light-minutes^2 / minute) ) * ( minute^2 / (light-minutes)^2 ) ) = 6.64 * minute.

So, (v x)/c² is 6.64 minutes.

So, returning to t’_B = γ ( t - (v x)/c² )

t is 2 minutes, so 2 - 6.64 = -4.64.

Multiply by γ =5/3, which gives (5/3)*(-4.64)= approximately -7.73 minutes.

So in the S' frame, event A is at t'=0, and event B is at t'≈-7.73.

So the time difference between the two events as observed in S' is 0 - (-7.73) =7.73 minutes. So approximately 7.73, which is close to 8. So the first answer would be 8 minutes, which is option D.

But wait, the options are from A to J, and the first part is when moving from Earth to Sun (u=0.8c). So that's the first scenario.

Now, the second part is when the observer is moving in the opposite direction at u=0.8c. So now, the velocity is v = -0.8c.

So, same approach, but with v=-0.8c.

Compute t’_A and t’_B for this case.

Again, event A: t=0, x=0.

t’_A = γ (t - (v x)/c² ) = γ (0 - (-0.8c * 0)/c² )=0.

Similarly, event B: t=2, x=8.3.

So, t’_B = γ (2 - (v x)/c² )

v is -0.8c, so (v x) is -0.8c *8.3 light-minutes.

Compute (v x)/c²:

(v x) = (-0.8c) *8.3 light-minutes.

As before, this is -6.64 c * light-minutes, but we have to compute (v x)/c².

So, (v x)/c² = (-0.8c *8.3 light-minutes)/c² = (-0.8 *8.3) * (c * light-minutes)/c².

Again, c is 1 light-minute per minute, so (c * light-minutes) = light-minutes^2 per minute.

So, (v x)/c² = (-6.64) * (light-minutes^2 per minute ) / (c^2).

But c^2 is (light-minutes per minute)^2, so the units again give us (light-minutes^2 per minute) divided by (light-minutes^2 per minute^2 )= minutes.

So, (v x)/c² = -6.64 minutes.

Thus, t’_B = γ (2 - (-6.64 )) = γ ( 2 +6.64 )= γ *8.64.

γ is 5/3, so 5/3 *8.64 = 14.4 minutes.

So, event A is at t’=0, event B at t’=14.4. So the time difference is 14.4 minutes, which is approximately 14.4, so the closest option is I:14, but I must check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:18, B:22, C:16, D:8, E:24, F:12, G:10, H:20, I:14, J:6.

So, 14.4 is closest to 14, which is option I.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for the second case.

When v= -0.8c, for event B:

t’_B = γ [ t - (v x)/c² ]

v=-0.8c, so (v x) = (-0.8c)(8.3) = -6.64 c light-minutes.

(v x)/c² = (-6.64 c light-minutes) / c².

Which is -6.64 (light-minutes) * c/(c²) ) = -6.64 * (1/c) * light-minutes.

Wait, 1/c is 1/(1 light-minute per minute), so 1/c is 1 minute per light-minute.

So, (v x)/c² = -6.64 * (light-minutes) * (1 minute)/(light-minute) ) = -6.64 minutes.

Wait, but that's correct. So, t’_B=γ (2 - (-6.64 )) = γ (8.64) = (5/3)*8.64.

Calculating that: 8.64 /3 is 2.88, multiplied by 5 is 14.4.

So, t’_B is 14.4 minutes, and t’_A is 0. So the time difference is 14.4, which is option I:14.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the direction. When the observer is moving from Earth to Sun (first case), the velocity is positive, and when moving opposite, it's negative.

So, the first scenario gives a time difference of approximately 7.73, which is 8 minutes, option D. The second scenario gives 14.4, which is 14, option I.

But wait, the problem says "find the time difference in minutes between the events according to an observer moving at u=0.8c from Earth to Sun. Repeat if observer is moving in the opposite direction at u=0.8c."

So the two answers are 8 and 14.

Looking back at the options, the first part is 8 (option D), the second is 14 (option
