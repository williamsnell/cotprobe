Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about forward and backward shifting. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned in economics class. I think it's related to taxes and how the burden is passed on. Let me think.

Wait, I remember something about tax incidence. When a tax is imposed, the burden doesn't always fall solely on the taxpayer. Businesses might shift the tax burden forward or backward. Forward shifting would mean passing it on to the customers, like increasing prices. Backward shifting would be passing it to the suppliers or workers, maybe through lower wages or lower prices paid for resources.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E says forward shifting is passing the tax onto customers via higher prices, and backward shifting is passing it to workers or suppliers. That sounds right. But wait, are there other options that might fit?

Option A is about price increases and decreases, but that's more general. Option B is about product development, which doesn't seem related. Option C talks about government regulation changes, that's not it. Option D is about markets, so probably no. Option E still seems correct.

Wait, could it be about shifting costs in production? Or is it specifically about taxes? I think it's specifically about taxes. So yes, E makes sense. Other options don't fit the concept I remember from tax shifting.

The correct answer is E. Forward shifting refers to passing the tax burden to customers through higher prices, while backward shifting passes it to workers or suppliers.
