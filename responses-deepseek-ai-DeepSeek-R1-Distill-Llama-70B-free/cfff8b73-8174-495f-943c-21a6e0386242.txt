Images and sounds are maintained in sensory memory for:

Options:

A: less than 5 seconds.
B: 30 to 45 seconds.
C: only while the sensory input is present.
D: 10 to 15 seconds.
E: exactly 5 minutes.
F: about 60 to 90 seconds.

H: an hour to a day.
I: until the information is transferred to short-term memory.
J: an indefinite period of time.

Okay, so I have this question about sensory memory and how long images and sounds are maintained there. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but let me think this through.

I remember that sensory memory is the first stage of memory processing. It's where information from our senses is held very briefly. There are different types, like iconic memory for visual info and echoic for auditory. 

Wait, iconic memory lasts just a few seconds, right? Like when you see something and then it's gone quickly. Maybe less than a second? But I'm not too sure about the exact time. Oh, wait, sometimes they say it's up to a couple of seconds, maybe even less than five seconds. 

Then there's echoic memory, which is for sounds. I think that lasts a bit longer than iconic. Maybe a few seconds more, but still not very long. I've heard somewhere that echoic can last up to a few seconds, maybe around 4 seconds or so. 

So putting that together, both images and sounds don't stay in sensory memory for long. It's just a brief period while the brain decides if it's important enough to send to short-term memory. 

Looking at the options, option A says less than 5 seconds. That sounds right because both visual and auditory sensory memories don't last much longer than that. Option C says only while the sensory input is present. But I think the memory lasts a bit even after the stimulus is gone, so C might not be correct. 

Option D is 10-15 seconds, which seems too long for sensory memory. I thought that's more like short-term memory duration. Option B is 30-45 seconds, which is even longer, so probably not. 

Option I says until the info is transferred to short-term. But I don't think that's how it works. Sensory memory's duration is time-based, not dependent on transfer. 

Options E, F, G, H, J all seem to describe longer-term memories, like short-term, working, or long-term. So the correct answer should be A: less than 5 seconds.

The correct answer is A: less than 5 seconds. Sensory memory holds information briefly, with iconic memory (visual) lasting less than a second and echoic memory (auditory) up to a few seconds. This duration is shorter than options D, B, E, F, G, H, or J, which describe longer memory stages. Option C is incorrect because sensory memory persists briefly after the stimulus ends, and option I is incorrect because sensory memory's duration is time-based, not dependent on transfer to short-term memory.

Answer: A
