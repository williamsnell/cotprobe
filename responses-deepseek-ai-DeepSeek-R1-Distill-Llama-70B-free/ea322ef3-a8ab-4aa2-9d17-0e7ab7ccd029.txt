Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let me read it again. The question says that real GDP per capita was $20,000 in 1980 and $21,000 in 1990. Then it asks by what percentage the standard of living has increased, with the options given.

Hmm, I remember that real GDP per capita is a measure used to assess the standard of living. GDP per capita is total GDP divided by the population, and the 'real' part means it's adjusted for inflation. So when real GDP per capita increases, it suggests that the average standard of living has gone up.

So the formula to calculate the percentage change should be the difference between the two values divided by the original value, right? Let me write that down.

The initial value in 1980 is $20,000. In 1990, it's $21,000. So the change is 21,000 minus 20,000, which is 1,000.

To find the percentage increase, I take that change (1,000) and divide by the original amount (20,000). So 1,000 / 20,000 equals 0.05. To convert that to a percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives 5%.

Looking at the options, option F is 5.0 percent. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The time frame is from 1980 to 1990, which is a decade. So the increase is over ten years. But the question just asks for the percentage increase, not the annual rate. So yes, it's a straightforward percentage change, not an annualized rate. So 5% total increase over the period, so the answer is F.

The standard of living is measured by the increase in real GDP per capita. From 1980 to 1990, real GDP per capita rose from $20,000 to $21,000, showing a $1,000 increase. The percentage increase is calculated as (1,000 / 20,000) * 100 = 5.0%. 

Answer: F
