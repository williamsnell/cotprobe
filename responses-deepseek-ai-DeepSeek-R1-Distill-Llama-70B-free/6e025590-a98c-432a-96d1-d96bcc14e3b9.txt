Okay, so I've got this question about McDonaldization of Society, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that McDonaldization is a concept developed by George Ritzer. It refers to the process by which society becomes increasingly like a fast-food restaurant, emphasizing efficiency, calculability, predictability, and standardized processes. The model is based on the McDonald's fast-food chain, which exemplifies these characteristics.

The question is asking which option is NOT an aspect of McDonaldization. So, I need to go through each option and see which one doesn't fit.

Option A: Extensive use of technology. I think technology is a big part of McDonaldization. McDonald's uses technology to streamline processes, like automated ordering and production lines. So this is part of it. So A is an aspect, not the exception.

Option B: Rationalization into cost/benefit analysis. Rationalization is a key concept. It's about making decisions based on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, moving away from traditional methods. So B is part of McDonaldization.

Option C: Focus on efficiency and predictability. These are two of the main pillars. McDonald's is all about getting food quickly (efficiency) and ensuring it's the same every time (predictability). So C is definitely part of it.

Option D: Effort to achieve sameness across markets. McDonald's is known for being the same everywhere you go. Whether it's in the US or Japan, you get the same menu items, same taste. So D is part of McDonaldization.

Option E: Emphasis on quantity over quality. Fast food is about producing a lot quickly, which often means lower quality ingredients but higher quantity. So E fits.

Option F: Prioritizing profit over well-being. McDonald's is a business, so profit is key. They might not always prioritize societal well-being, like health concerns. So F is part of McDonaldization.

Option G: Bureaucratic organization with formal division of labor. McDonald's has a clear hierarchy and each worker has specific tasks. It's a very structured, bureaucratic setup. So G is part of it.

Option H: Standardization of societal norms. McDonaldization leads to standardized practices across different areas, so H fits.

Option I: Shift from craftsmanship to mass production. Instead of individual, unique items, everything is mass-produced. So I is part of it.

Option J: Dissolution of hierarchy into team-based decisions. Wait, McDonald's is known for having a strict hierarchy, not collaborative teams. They have a clear chain of command. So J doesn't fit. McDonaldization is about a top-down structure, not teams making decisions together. So J is the exception.

So the answer should be J.

The McDonaldization of Society, as described by George Ritzer, is characterized by principles such as efficiency, predictability, calculability, and standardization. It often involves the use of technology, rationalization of decisions, emphasis on quantity over quality, and a bureaucratic structure with a clear division of labor. However, one aspect that does not align with McDonaldization is the dissolution of hierarchical authority into collaborative, team-based decision-making. McDonaldization typically involves a strict, top-down hierarchy rather than decentralized or collaborative structures. 

Answer: J
