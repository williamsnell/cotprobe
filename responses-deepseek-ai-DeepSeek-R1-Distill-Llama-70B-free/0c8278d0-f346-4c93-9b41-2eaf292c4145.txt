Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive integer that leaves specific remainders when divided by numbers from 2 to 6. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem states:
- When divided by 2, the remainder is 1.
- When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.
- When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.
- When divided by 5, the remainder is 4.
- When divided by 6, the remainder is 5.

Hmm, I remember something about the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but I'm not too familiar with it. Maybe I can tackle this problem using a different approach.

Let me look at each condition. It seems like for each divisor, the remainder is one less than the divisor itself. Like for 2, remainder 1 (2-1=1), for 3, remainder 2 (3-1=2?), wait no, 3-1 is 2, yes. Wait, 4-1=3, 5-1=4, 6-1=5. So in each case, the remainder is one less than the divisor. So the number we're looking for is one less than a multiple of each of these divisors.

If that's the case, then the number plus one should be a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Because if N divided by d leaves a remainder of d-1, then N = k*d -1, so N+1 = k*d. So N+1 must be a multiple of each d.

So the smallest such N would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 2,3,4,5,6 minus 1.

Let me calculate the LCM of these numbers. 

First, factor each number:
- 2 is prime.
- 3 is prime.
- 4 is 2².
- 5 is prime.
- 6 is 2*3.

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So primes are 2, 3, 5.

Highest power of 2 is 2² (from 4). 
Highest power of 3 is 3¹ (since 3 and 6 have 3^1).
Highest power of 5 is 5¹.

So LCM = 2² * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 *5 = 60.

So N+1 = 60 → N=59.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me check each condition with N=59.

59 divided by 2: 59/2 is 29 with remainder 1. Correct.

59 divided by 3: 3*19=57, 59-57=2. Correct.

Divided by 4: 4*14=56, 59-56=3. Correct.

Divided by 5: 5*11=55, 59-55=4. Correct.

Divided by 6: 6*9=54, 59-54=5. Correct.

So 59 satisfies all the conditions. Now looking at the options, option A is 59, so that should be the answer.

But wait, let me check if any number smaller than 59 meets these conditions. Since the LCM is 60, the next smaller multiple would be 60-60=0, which isn't positive. So 59 is indeed the smallest positive integer that fits all the criteria.

The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer \( N \) that satisfies the following conditions:
- \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \)
- \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
- \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \)
- \( N \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
- \( N \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \)

Observing the pattern, the remainder in each case is one less than the divisor. This implies that \( N + 1 \) must be a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is calculated as follows:
- Prime factorization: \( 2 = 2 \), \( 3 = 3 \), \( 4 = 2^2 \), \( 5 = 5 \), \( 6 = 2 \cdot 3 \).
- Highest powers of primes: \( 2^2 \), \( 3^1 \), \( 5^1 \).
- LCM = \( 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 60 \).

Thus, \( N + 1 = 60 \), so \( N = 59 \).

Verifying:
- \( 59 \div 2 = 29 \) remainder \( 1 \) (correct).
- \( 59 \div 3 = 19 \) remainder \( 2 \) (correct).
- \( 59 \div 4 = 14 \) remainder \( 3 \) (correct).
- \( 59 \div 5 = 11 \) remainder \( 4 \) (correct).
- \( 59 \div 6 = 9 \) remainder \( 5 \) (correct).

Since 59 satisfies all conditions and is the smallest such number, the answer is:

A: 59
