Okay, so I've got this question about vitamin D and its functions. I'm a bit rusty on my vitamins, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is asking which of the options is not a function of vitamin D. The options are A through F.

First, I remember that vitamin D is often associated with bone health. I think it helps the body absorb calcium, which is important for bones. So that relates to bone turnover, which is option F. So F is a function, so it's not the answer.

Option A is regulation of the immune system. I'm pretty sure vitamin D has some role in immune function. I've heard that people with deficiencies might have more infections. So A is a function, not the answer.

Option B is muscle strength. I believe vitamin D does influence muscle function. There have been studies where deficiency leads to muscle weakness. So B is a function, so not the correct answer.

Option C is differentiation of adipocytes. Adipocytes are fat cells. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. I know that vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, so maybe it's involved in fat cell regulation. I'm not certain, but I'll keep this in mind as a possible candidate.

Option D is glucose metabolism. I'm not too sure about this either. I know that some vitamins, like D, have roles beyond their primary functions. I've heard that vitamin D might influence insulin sensitivity, so possibly this is a function. But I'm not entirely certain, so I'll need to think more.

Option E is acting as a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. Wait, antioxidants like vitamins C and E are more known for that. Vitamin D's main role isn't as an antioxidant. So E might be the correct answer here. Let me think more about the others before jumping to conclusions.

Wait, vitamin D's main functions: it's a steroid hormone that's involved in calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and it also plays a role in cell differentiation. Oh, right, vitamin D helps regulate the differentiation of cells, including possibly adipocytes. So option C might be a function, meaning it's not the answer.

Glucose metabolism, option D: I'm trying to recall. I think there's some research suggesting that vitamin D affects insulin secretion and sensitivity, which ties into glucose metabolism. So D is a function.

So, the functions are A, B, C, D, F. The only one that doesn't fit is E. Because vitamin D isn't known as an antioxidant in cell membranes. Antioxidants are more like vitamins C, E, and others like beta-carotene. Vitamin D's role isn't primarily antioxidant. So the answer should be E.

The question asks which option is not a function of vitamin D. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **A: Regulation of immune system function**  
  Vitamin D plays a role in immune function, with deficiencies linked to increased infections. This is a function of vitamin D.

- **B: Regulation of muscle strength**  
  Vitamin D influences muscle function, and deficiencies can lead to muscle weakness. This is a function of vitamin D.

- **C: Regulation of differentiation of adipocytes**  
  Vitamin D is involved in cell differentiation, potentially including adipocytes (fat cells). This is a function of vitamin D.

- **D: Regulation of glucose metabolism**  
  Vitamin D may influence insulin sensitivity and secretion, linking it to glucose metabolism. This is a function of vitamin D.

- **E: Lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes**  
  Vitamin D is not primarily known as an antioxidant. Antioxidants like vitamins C and E are more associated with this role. This is **not** a function of vitamin D.

- **F: Regulation of bone turnover**  
  Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and calcium absorption, regulating bone turnover. This is a function of vitamin D.

The only option that does not represent a function of vitamin D is **E**. 

Answer: E
