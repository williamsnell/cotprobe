Okay, so I've got this problem about heat dissipation through pin fins on an electrical device. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that pin fins are used to increase the surface area for heat transfer. Each fin is a small cylinder, I think. The device has eight of these fins. So, each fin's dimensions are given: 5 mm wide, 0.5 mm thick, and 25 mm long. Wait, wait—wait, is that width, thickness, and length? Or maybe it's diameter? No, probably it's the dimensions for a rectangular fin. But pin fins are cylindrical, right? Oh wait, no—sometimes pin fins are considered as cylindrical, but the problem says each is 5 mm wide, 0.5 thick, and 25 mm long. So maybe they're rectangular in cross-section? So each fin is like a small rectangular prism extending from the device.

But wait, wait, maybe I should clarify. For a pin fin, the cross-section is usually circular. But in this problem, the pin fin has width, thickness, and length. So maybe it's a rectangular pin fin. So each fin is a rectangular prism with width (w) 5 mm, thickness (t) 0.5 mm, and length (L) 25 mm. Oh, okay.

The thermal conductivity (k) of the fin material is 200 W/m·K. The film heat transfer coefficient (h) is 9 W/m²·K, and it's uniform along the fin. The device is at 350 K, ambient air is at 300 K. We need to find the power dissipated through the fins.

Wait, power dissipated would be the total heat transfer from all the fins. So each fin's heat transfer rate would be calculated and multiplied by eight.

So the formula for heat transfer from a fin is Q = (h * P * L * (T_base - T_ambient)) / ( (h * A)^(1/2) * tanh( sqrt(h*A/(k*P)) * L )) )

Wait, maybe I should get the formula correctly. For a rectangular fin (which I think is what this is, since the cross-section is width and thickness), the formula for heat transfer is:

Q = sqrt(h * k * P * A) * (T_base - T_amb) * tanh( L * sqrt(h * A/(k * P)) )

Wait, no, maybe it's:

Q = (h * P * L * (T_base - T_amb)) / ( (h * A)^(1/2) ) * tanh( sqrt( h A/(k P) ) * L )

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The general formula for a fin is:

Q = (h * P * L * θ_base) / ( (h * A)^(1/2) ) * tanh( sqrt( h A/(k P) ) * L )

Wait, θ_base is the temperature difference at the base, so T_base - T_amb.

Alternatively, another form I've seen is:

Q = sqrt( h k P A ) * (T_base - T_amb) * ( (2 / sqrt(π)) ) * ( (sqrt( h A/(k P) ) * L ) * (e^(sqrt( h A/(k P) ) * L ) + 1) ) / (e^(sqrt( h A/(k P) ) * L ) - 1) )

Wait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, the formula might be Q = (h * P * L * θ)/ ( (h A )^0.5 ) * tanh( m L ), where m is sqrt( h A/(k P) )

Wait, that sounds more familiar. So let's try to break it down.

Each fin is a rectangular prism, so the perimeter P is 2*(w + t), since it's width w and thickness t. So P = 2*(5 mm + 0.5 mm) = 2*(5.5 mm) = 11 mm. But wait, wait, no. Wait, for a rectangular cross-section, the perimeter is 2*(width + height). Since the fin is a small pin, the cross-section is a rectangle with width w=5 mm and thickness t=0.5 mm. So P = 2*(w + t) = 2*(5 + 0.5) mm = 2*5.5 mm = 11 mm. But wait, units matter—so convert to meters. So 11 mm is 0.011 m.

The cross-sectional area A is w * t = 5 mm * 0.5 mm = 2.5 mm². Convert to m²: 2.5e-6 m².

The length of the fin is L = 25 mm, which is 0.025 m.

Now, the parameters:

h = 9 W/m²·K.

k = 200 W/m·K.

Compute m = sqrt( (h * A) / (k * P) )

Wait, let's compute m.

h*A = 9 * 2.5e-6 = 2.25e-5.

k*P = 200 * 0.011 = 2.2.

So m = sqrt( (2.25e-5) / 2.2 ) = sqrt( 1.0227e-5 ) ≈ 0.00316 m⁻¹.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

h*A = 9 * 2.5e-6 = 22.5e-6 = 2.25e-5.

k*P = 200 * 0.011 = 2.2.

So m² = (2.25e-5) / 2.2 = approximately 1.0227e-5.

So m = sqrt(1.0227e-5) = approx 3.196e-3 1/m.

Now, m*L = 0.003196 * 0.025 m = 0.0000799 m²? Wait, no—m is 1/m, L is in meters, so m*L is dimensionless.

Wait, 0.003196 * 0.025 = 0.0000799, which is 7.99e-5.

Wait, that's a very small number. Then tanh(mL) would be approximately equal to mL, since for small x, tanh x ≈ x.

Because tanh(0.0000799) is approximately 0.0000799.

So the formula for Q:

Q = (h * P * L * (T_base - T_amb)) / sqrt(h*A) ) * tanh(mL).

But since tanh(mL) ≈ mL, which is 7.99e-5, the formula becomes:

Q ≈ (h P L (ΔT)) / sqrt(h A) ) * (m L).

Wait, but let's plug in the variables.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute Q as:

Q = (h * P * L * ΔT) / (sqrt(h A)) ) * tanh(m L).

But let me compute each part step by step.

Compute h*A: 9 * 2.5e-6 = 2.25e-5.

Compute k*P: 200 * 0.011 = 2.2.

m = sqrt( (h A)/(k P) ) = sqrt( (2.25e-5)/(2.2) ) = sqrt(1.0227e-5) ≈ 0.003196 m⁻¹.

mL = 0.003196 * 0.025 = 0.0000799.

tanh(0.0000799) ≈ 0.0000799 (since for small x, tanh x ≈ x).

Now, let's compute the numerator: h * P * L * ΔT.

h =9, P=0.011 m, L=0.025 m, ΔT=350-300=50 K.

So numerator = 9 * 0.011 * 0.025 *50.

Compute that:

9 * 0.011 = 0.099.

0.099 * 0.025 = 0.002475.

0.002475 *50 = 0.12375.

So numerator is 0.12375 W·m²/(m·K) ??? Wait, not sure about units, but moving on.

Denominator is sqrt(h*A) = sqrt(9 * 2.5e-6) = sqrt(2.25e-5) = approx 0.004743 m²/(m·K)^0.5.

Wait, but let's compute it accurately:

sqrt(2.25e-5) = sqrt(2.25)*1e-2.5? Wait, sqrt(2.25)=1.5. So 1.5e-2.5? Wait, 1e-5 is (1e-2.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-5) is 1e-2.5 = 3.16e-3.

Wait, wait, 2.25e-5 = 2.25 * 1e-5.

So sqrt(2.25e-5) = sqrt(2.25) * sqrt(1e-5) = 1.5 * (1e-2.5) ) ≈ 1.5 * 3.1623e-3 ≈ 4.743e-3.

So denominator is 4.743e-3.

So the first part is (0.12375) / (4.743e-3) = approx 26.08.

Then multiply by tanh(mL), which is ~0.0000799.

So 26.08 * 0.0000799 ≈ 0.002085 W.

Wait, that's per fin? Because each fin contributes that much.

Wait, but that seems really low. Is that correct? Because 0.002 W per fin times 8 fins is 0.016 W, which isn't even among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula I used isn't correct. Another approach: the formula for heat loss from a rectangular fin is:

Q = (h * P * L * (T_base - T_amb)) / ( (h * A)^(1/2) ) ) * tanh( sqrt( h A/(k P) ) * L )

Wait, that's what I used. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let's recompute m:

m = sqrt( (h A)/(k P) )

h*A = 9 * 2.5e-6 = 2.25e-5.

k*P = 200 * 0.011 = 2.2.

So m = sqrt( (2.25e-5)/(2.2) ) = sqrt(1.0227e-5) ≈ 3.196e-3 1/m.

m*L = 3.196e-3 * 0.025 = 7.99e-5.

tanh(7.99e-5) ≈ 7.99e-5.

So the formula gives:

Q = [h P L (T_base - T_amb) ] / sqrt(h A) ) * tanh(m L)

h P L ΔT = 9 * 0.011 m * 0.025 m * 50 K.

Compute that:

9 * 0.011 = 0.099 W/(m²·K) * m → 0.099 W/(m·K) ?

Wait, units are getting confusing. Let me compute numerically:

9 * 0.011 = 0.099.

0.099 * 0.025 = 0.002475.

0.002475 *50 = 0.12375.

So 0.12375.

Divide by sqrt(h A) = 4.743e-3.

0.12375 / 0.004743 ≈ 26.08.

Multiply by tanh(mL) ≈ 7.99e-5.

So 26.08 * 7.99e-5 ≈ approx 0.002085 W per fin.

That's 0.002085 W per fin. Multiply by 8 fins: 0.0167 W.

But this is way below any of the options, which are around 0.65 to 1.25 W. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the formula for a pin fin (cylindrical) is different than a rectangular one. Because the problem says 'pin fins each of 5 mm wide, 0.5 mm thick and 25 mm long.' Hmm, but pin fins are usually cylindrical, so perhaps each fin is a cylinder.

Wait, that might be the mistake. So if it's a cylindrical pin fin, then the cross-section is a circle with diameter. So perhaps the 5 mm is the diameter, but the problem says 5 mm wide. Alternatively, maybe the 5 mm is the diameter, or perhaps the 0.5 mm is the thickness (diameter?) and 5 mm is the length. Wait, the pin fin's dimensions are given as 5 mm wide, 0.5 mm thick, 25 mm long. That's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the width and thickness are for the cross-section. So if it's a cylindrical pin, then the cross-section is a circle. So maybe the diameter is 5 mm, or 0.5 mm? Or perhaps the 5 mm is the length.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me read the problem again.

"A small electrical device is having eight pin fins each of 5 mm wide, 0.5 mm thick and 25 mm long."

Pin fins are cylindrical. So in that case, the cross-section is a circle. So the diameter would be the width, perhaps. But 5 mm wide—maybe that's the diameter. Or 0.5 mm is the thickness, which would be the diameter. But 0.5 mm seems very thin for a pin.

Alternatively, perhaps the width is 5 mm, and the thickness 0.5 mm, which would make it a rectangular cross-section, but that's not a pin fin. So perhaps the problem intended the pin fin to have a diameter of 5 mm, and the length of 25 mm. But then what's the 0.5 mm? Or maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be the radius. Alternatively, maybe it's a square pin fin, but that's not typical.

Alternatively, perhaps 5 mm is the length, 0.5 mm is the diameter.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try assuming that each pin fin is a cylinder with diameter 5 mm, so radius 2.5 mm. Then the length is 25 mm.

Wait, but then the cross-section would be a circle with radius 2.5 mm. So the perimeter P (circumference) would be π*d = π*5 mm = ~15.707 mm. The cross-sectional area A would be π*(2.5 mm)^2 ≈ 19.635 mm².

Let me recalculate with these values.

So:

h =9 W/m²·K.

k=200 W/m·K.

L=25 mm = 0.025 m.

Diameter d=5 mm → radius r=2.5 mm =0.0025 m.

Perimeter P= π*d = π*0.005 m ≈0.01570796 m.

Area A= π*r² = π*(0.0025)^2 = 1.9635e-5 m².

So m = sqrt( (h*A)/(k*P) )

Compute h*A =9 *1.9635e-5 ≈1.76715e-4.

k*P =200 *0.01570796 ≈3.14159.

So m = sqrt( (1.76715e-4)/(3.14159) ) → sqrt(5.625e-5) ≈0.00749 m⁻¹.

m*L =0.00749 *0.025=0.00018725.

tanh(mL)= tanh(0.00018725)≈0.00018725.

Now compute Q:

Q = [h * P * L * (T_base - T_amb)] / sqrt(h*A)  * tanh(m L).

Compute numerator:

h * P * L * ΔT =9 *0.01570796 *0.025 *50.

Let me compute step by step:

9 *0.01570796 = 0.14137064.

0.14137064 *0.025= 0.003534266.

0.003534266 *50=0.1767133.

Denominator: sqrt(h*A) = sqrt(9 *1.9635e-5) = sqrt(1.76715e-4) ≈ 0.01329.

So (0.1767133)/(0.01329) ≈13.29.

Multiply by tanh(mL)= 0.00018725.

So 13.29 *0.00018725 ≈0.002486 W per fin.

But wait, that's even smaller than before. Hmm. So 8 fins would give 0.0199 W, which is 0.02 W, but the options are much higher. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the interpretation of the problem. Maybe the pin fins are rectangular, not cylindrical. So going back, the cross-section is rectangular: width 5 mm, thickness 0.5 mm.

So for a rectangular fin, the perimeter P = 2*(w + t) = 2*(5 + 0.5) =11 mm = 0.011 m.

Area A = w * t =5 *0.5 =2.5 mm²=2.5e-6 m².

So, m = sqrt( (h A )/(k P) ) = sqrt( (9 *2.5e-6) / (200*0.011) )

Compute numerator: 9*2.5e-6=2.25e-5.

Denominator: 200*0.011=2.2.

So m^2=2.25e-5 / 2.2 ≈1.0227e-5.

m= sqrt(1.0227e-5)= approx 0.003196 m⁻¹.

mL= 0.003196 * 0.025 =7.99e-5.

tanh(7.99e-5)=7.99e-5.

Now, the heat transfer per fin:

Q = [h * P * L * (T_base - T_amb)] / [sqrt(h A
