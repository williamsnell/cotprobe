Okay, so I've got this question about formal grammars and parsing. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives a grammar with two production rules:
1. S → ( S )
2. S → x

And then there are three statements, I, II, III, and we need to determine which are true.

First, I need to understand each statement.

Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous. Ambiguous means that there's at least one string in the language that can be derived in more than one way. So, for example, a string that can be parsed in two different parse trees.

Statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing. Top-down parsers, like recursive descent, usually work well with unambiguous grammars, especially ones in LL form. They predict the structure starting from the start symbol and work down.

Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing. Bottom-up parsers, like shift-reduce parsers (e.g., yacc), work with grammars that can be parsed in a left-to-right manner, often requiring the grammar to be LR(k) or similar.

Now, let's analyze the given grammar.

The grammar has S as the start symbol. The first production allows S to produce a pair of parentheses surrounding another S. The second allows S to produce x.

Let me think about the possible strings generated by this grammar. 

The simplest is x. Then, (x), then ((x)), and so on. So the language is all strings of the form (^n x )^n, where n is a non-negative integer.

Wait, but wait: Each S can be replaced by either x or ( S ). So for n=0, it's x. n=1: (x). n=2: ((x)), etc.

Now, is the grammar ambiguous? Let's see.

Take the string (x). How can it be derived?

Option 1: S → ( S ) → ( x ). So that's one way.

Is there another way? Let's see. Suppose the string is (x). The first production S→(S) is applied once, and then S→x. I don't see another way to derive (x). So no ambiguity here.

Wait, but let's consider a longer string. Let's take ((x)).

Possible derivations: 

1. S → ( S ) → ( ( S ) ) → ( ( x ) )
Wait, no, that's not right. Let me redo.

Actually, S can derive to ( S ), which can derive to ( ( S ) ), which then becomes ( ( x ) ). So that's one parse.

Is there an alternative way? Hmm, perhaps not. Because each step must expand the outermost parentheses first.

Wait, but maybe S can be expanded as ( S ), which could be ( x ), but that's when n=1. For n=2, the only way is to expand S to ( S ), then that S again to ( S ), then to x. So each step is forced. So there's only one parse tree for any string in this language.

Therefore, the grammar is unambiguous. So statement I is false.

Now, statement II and III: whether the grammar is suitable for top-down and/or bottom-up parsing.

For top-down parsing, the grammar should be LL(1). Let me check if this grammar is LL(1).

The grammar is:

S → ( S ) | x

The first set (what S can start with) is '(', x.

Wait, the first production starts with '(', and the second starts with x. So the first set of S is { '(', x }.

The follow set is whatever comes after S in the grammar. Since S is the only symbol, the follow set would be $ (end of input) and possibly the closing ).

Wait, but in the production S → ( S ), the S is followed by a ). So when you have S followed by something, the follow set includes the terminals that can come after S in the entire string.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the first and follow sets.

First(S) = { '(', x }

Follow(S) would be the set of terminals that can come after S in any production.

Looking at the production S → ( S ), the S is followed by a ), so after expanding S, there's a ). So for the production, after S comes ), so in the context, when S is followed by something else in a larger production, but in this case, the only production is S → ( S ), which is S followed by ), but wait, S is the only non-terminal.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's think about the entire language. The strings are x, (x), ((x)), etc. So the end of the string is always a closing ).

So the follow(S) would include the closing ) and the end of input (but in this grammar, the end is when S is x, which is a terminal. Wait, no, because in the production S→x, S is replaced by x, so when S is in the start symbol position, the follow would be the end.

Wait, perhaps for the non-terminal S, the follow set includes the closing ) and the end $.

Because, for example, in the string (x), after S (which is x) comes ).

But wait, in the production S → ( S ), after expanding, the S is followed by ), so the S in S → ( S ) is followed by ). So the follow set for S would include ), and also $, because in the case where S is the start symbol and the entire string is x, the S is followed by $.

So Follow(S) = { ), $ }

Now, for the LL(1) condition, the first sets of the productions for S must be disjoint.

The first set for S → ( S ) is { ( }, and for S → x is {x }.

So ( and x are distinct; their first sets are disjoint. So the grammar is LL(1), which makes it suitable for top-down parsing (statement II is true).

What about bottom-up parsing? That's typically about whether the grammar is LR(1).

LR(1) grammars can be parsed by a shift-reduce parser. One key point is that the grammar should not have any shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflicts.

So I need to check if this grammar is LR(1).

Another approach is to look for left recursion, but this grammar doesn't have any because the productions don't have S producing something starting with S on the left (like S → S something, which would be left recursion). So no left recursion, which is a good sign for LR parsers.

Wait, actually, the production S → ( S ) is right recursive, but that's okay because LR parsers can handle right recursion.

So let's think about the possible shifts and reduces.

Let's consider the parsing process for a string like x. The parser reads x, and then reduces it to S.

For the string (x), the parser would shift '(', then when S is parsed (which would read x and reduce to S), then it would see ')', shift it, and then reduce S → ( S ), I think.

Wait, but building the parse trees, let's think about the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is not LR(1) because of possible conflicts. Let me think deeper.

Wait, another approach: the grammar is a simple one, perhaps it's an example of a grammar that can be parsed both top-down and bottom-up.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let's think about the structure of the grammar.

The grammar is similar to the classic balanced parentheses grammar, except it's a single pair surrounding a single x. But in this case, the string is just nested parentheses around an x.

Wait, but the way it's structured, each S is either x or a pair of parentheses around another S. So the grammar is unambiguous and is suitable for both top-down and bottom-up parsing.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the parsing direction.

Top-down parsers start from S and predict the structure. Bottom-up parsers start from the terminals and build up to S.

In this grammar, let's see if it's possible to have a shift-reduce conflict.

For example, when the parser has read '(', what's next? It can either read another '(', which would mean expanding S → ( S ), or it can read x, which would be S → x.

Wait, but in the context where the parser is trying to parse S, upon seeing '(', it knows to expand via the first production. So perhaps no conflict.

Wait, but let's consider the situation where the parser is trying to parse S, and the next token is '('. So the parser would replace S with (S'), and then parse S' as the inner S. That seems straightforward.

Alternatively, if the next token is x, it would replace S with x.

So in terms of LR parsing, the grammar should be LR(1), meaning it's suitable for bottom-up parsing. So statement III is true.

Wait, but wait, the grammar's only non-terminal is S, and the productions are straightforward. So there's no ambiguity in the parsing steps. So yes, I think it's possible to build an LR parser for this grammar.

So, to sum up:

Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous. We determined it's unambiguous, so I is false.

Statement II: Suitable for top-down. Since it's LL(1), yes, II is true.

Statement III: Suitable for bottom-up. Since it's LR(1), yes, III is true.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the grammar is LL(1), so top-down is okay. For bottom-up, it's also suitable because it's LR(1). So II and III are true.

But wait, the options given are:

Options:

A: III only and not II

B: II only and not III

C: I only

D: I and II only

E: III only

F: Neither

G: II and III only

H: II only

I: I and III only

J: All correct.

So according to this, II and III are true. So option G is II and III only.

Wait, but earlier I thought statement I was false, but let me double-check. Was the grammar ambiguous?

Wait, let me think again. Ambiguous means more than one parse tree for some string.

Take the string (x). Its parse tree is S → (S) → (x). Only one way.

Take the string x: S→x. Only one way.

Take the string ((x)): S→(S) → ((S)) → ((x)). Only one parse.

So no ambiguity; so I is false.

So the correct statements are II and III.

Looking at the options, option G says II and III only. So the answer should be G.

But wait, let me double-check whether the grammar is indeed suitable for bottom-up parsing. Are there any issues?

The grammar doesn't have left recursion, so it's compatible with both LL and LR parsers.

Wait, but what about the fact that it's right-recursive? Well, that's fine for LR, which can handle right recursion without problems.

So yes, II and III are true. So option G.

The grammar provided is:

- \( S \rightarrow ( S ) \)
- \( S \rightarrow x \)

### Analysis of the Statements:

#### **Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous.**
A grammar is ambiguous if there exists at least one string in the language that can be derived in more than one way. For this grammar:
- The string \( x \) is derived directly as \( S \rightarrow x \).
- The string \( (x) \) is derived as \( S \rightarrow (S) \rightarrow (x) \).
- The string \( ((x)) \) is derived as \( S \rightarrow (S) \rightarrow ((S)) \rightarrow ((x)) \).

For all strings in the language, there is only one possible derivation and one parse tree. Therefore, the grammar is **unambiguous**, and **Statement I is false**.

#### **Statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.**
A grammar is suitable for top-down parsing if it is \( LL(1) \). For a grammar to be \( LL(1) \):
1. The first sets of the productions for a non-terminal must be disjoint.
2. The first and follow sets must not overlap.

- **First Set of \( S \):** \( \{ (, x \} \)
- **Follow Set of \( S \):** \( \{ ), \, \$ \} \)

The first sets of the two productions for \( S \) are disjoint (\( \{ (\} \) and \( \{ x \} \)), and the first and follow sets do not overlap. Thus, the grammar is \( LL(1) \), making it suitable for top-down parsing. **Statement II is true**.

#### **Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.**
A grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing if it is \( LR(1) \). For a grammar to be \( LR(1) \):
1. It must not have any shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflicts.
2. It must not have left recursion.

This grammar has no left recursion (it is right-recursive), and there are no shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflicts. Therefore, the grammar is \( LR(1) \), making it suitable for bottom-up parsing. **Statement III is true**.

### Conclusion:
- **Statement I** is false.
- **Statement II** is true.
- **Statement III** is true.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: II and III only**.

The answer is **G**.
