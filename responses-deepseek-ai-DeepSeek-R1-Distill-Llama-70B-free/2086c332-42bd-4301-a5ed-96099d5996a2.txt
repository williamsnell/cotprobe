Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about Refrigerant 12, which I think is also called Freon 12. The question involves calculating the work done during compression and the heat removed during compression for a pound of this refrigerant. Hmm, I remember that refrigerants are used in vapor-compression cycles, so this must be part of that process.

The problem gives me the initial and final states. Initially, it's at 20 psia and 30°F, and after compression, it's at 140 psia and 150°F. I need to find two things: work done and heat removed.

Wait, so first, I should probably think about the process. Compression in refrigeration cycles is typically a process where the refrigerant is compressed from a low-pressure, low-temperature vapor to a high-pressure, high-temperature vapor. So this is a vapor compression step. 

I recall that during compression, work is done on the system (the refrigerant), so the work should be negative from the system's perspective because the system is the refrigerant, and work done on the system is considered negative. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, in thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered positive, and work done on the system is negative. So when the compressor compresses the refrigerant, work is done on the system, so the work (W) will be negative. 

But wait, the options have both positive and negative values. So I need to be careful about the sign conventions here.

Next, for the calculations. Since this is a compression process, and if I can assume it's a reversible process (though the problem doesn't specify), I might need to use the first law of thermodynamics. The first law says that the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the heat added (Q) minus the work done by the system (W). So ΔU = Q - W. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as Q = ΔU + W, depending on the convention.

Wait, no, the first law is usually written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So if work is done on the system, W is positive. Or maybe it's the other way around again. Let me clarify: in physics, work done by the system is positive, so in that case, when work is done on the system, W is negative. But in some engineering contexts, they might define work done on the system as positive. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the work done during compression. For a compressor, the work is input, so from the system's perspective, it's negative. So if the options give negative values for work done, that might be correct.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the process. The refrigerant is being compressed, so the volume decreases. If it's an ideal gas, the work done would be the integral of PdV. But I don't think Refrigerant 12 behaves as an ideal gas, especially since it's a real refrigerant and the temperatures and pressures here are probably in ranges where real gas effects matter. So I can't assume ideal gas behavior.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects me to use the ideal gas equations anyway. Because without specific data or tables for Refrigerant 12, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps there are tables provided elsewhere, but since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe it's expecting me to use the first law and some approximate calculations.

Wait, but in that case, I might need the change in internal energy (ΔU) and the heat transfer (Q). The first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if the system is the refrigerant, and the compressor does work on it, then W would be negative. 

So, for the work done during compression, if I can find the work, then I can use the first law to find the heat removed. But how do I find the work?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use enthalpy. Because, for a process involving a compressor or turbine, the work is often calculated using the change in enthalpy (ΔH), especially if the process is adiabatic or if other conditions are given. But wait, the process here isn't stated as adiabatic. So that complicates things.

Wait, but in a typical vapor-compression cycle, the compression process is usually modeled as adiabatic for simplification. If that's the case, then Q would be zero, and ΔU = -W. But the problem doesn't state that it's adiabatic. So I can't assume that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the process is isentropic, but again, the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps I should proceed with the general first law approach.

I think the key here is to find the work done and the heat transfer using the properties of Refrigerant 12. So I would need to find the internal energy and enthalpy at the initial and final states.

But wait, without the tables or specific data, I can't compute the exact values. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas equations. Let me try that approach.

Assuming Refrigerant 12 behaves as an ideal gas during this process. For an ideal gas, the work done during a process can be calculated if we know the pressure-volume relationship. But since I don't have volume data, maybe it's a constant pressure process or something else. Alternatively, if the process is isentropic, but I don't know that.

Wait, but another approach: for an ideal gas, the work done during a compression process from state 1 to state 2 can be found by W = P1V1 - P2V2 when the process is isobaric, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, if it's a reversible process, perhaps using the formula W = nRT ln(P2/P1) when temperature changes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the problem gives me the pressure and temperature at both the initial and final states. So perhaps I can compute the work done using the ideal gas law to find the specific volume, then compute work as PΔV or using the formula for work in an ideal gas.

Wait, but the work done on the gas during compression can be calculated using the formula:

W = -∫ P dV from V1 to V2.

But if I don't know the process path (like is it isothermal, adiabatic, etc.), I can't compute it directly. So maybe I need to make an assumption here, perhaps that the process is reversible and polytropic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the enthalpy change to compute the work, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the first law again. The first law for a process is Q = ΔU + W, where W is the work done by the system. So if I can find ΔU and Q, I can find W, or vice versa. But without knowing Q or ΔU, I'm stuck.

Wait, but maybe the problem provides the data needed through the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: Work done is 11,670 ft-lb, heat removed is 2.059 Btu/lb.

Option D: Work done is -11,670 ft-lb, heat removed is -2.059 Btu/lb.

Option J: Work done is -11,670 ft-lb, heat removed is 2.059 Btu/lb.

So these options have positive and negative values for both work and heat.

Wait, the work done during compression is work done on the system, so it should be negative if we're taking the system's perspective. So option D and J have negative work.

As for heat removed, if heat is leaving the system (which is the refrigerant), then Q would be negative.

So the question is: during compression, is heat being removed or added? Well, in a compressor, often the process is not adiabatic, and depending on the situation, heat might be removed. But generally, in a real compressor, some heat is generated due to friction and compression, so the process might involve heat loss. But again, without knowing the process details, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the process as an isentropic process, calculate the work, and then find the heat transfer. But without knowing the specific heat capacities, that's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the specific heat of Refrigerant 12, but I don't have that data here. Alternatively, maybe the options are calculated using certain approximations that I can reverse-engineer.

Wait, looking at the numbers, 11,670 ft-lb per pound seems quite large. Let me think: 1 Btu is approximately 778 ft-lb. So 11,670 ft-lb is about 15 Btu. But looking at the options, some have 2.059 Btu, which is much smaller.

Alternatively, maybe the work is calculated using the enthalpy change. For Refrigerant 12, perhaps the enthalpy at the initial and final states is known, and the work is the change in enthalpy. But wait, that's for a steady-flow process. In a steady-flow compressor, the work per unit mass is given by (h2 - h1), assuming adiabatic and negligible kinetic and potential energy changes. 

So if I can find h1 and h2, then the work would be h2 - h1. But again, without the tables, I can't compute that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas equations.

Wait, let me try that. Assuming Refrigerant 12 is an ideal gas, so h is a function of temperature only. Then, the work done would be the change in enthalpy (h2 - h1). But wait, no: for a steady-flow compressor, the work is h1 - h2 (if it's a turbine) or h2 - h1 (if compressor), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, in a compressor, work is done on the system, so the enthalpy increases. So for a compressor, the work per unit mass is (h2 - h1), because the compressor adds energy to the system. So if I can find h2 and h1, I can compute the work.

But without the specific enthalpy values, I can't compute this. Alternatively, perhaps use the ideal gas specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) to find the change in enthalpy.

The specific heat at constant pressure for Refrigerant 12 (which is dichlorodifluoromethane, I think) is not something I remember exactly. But perhaps I can find it through another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the gas constant for Refrigerant 12. The molecular weight of Refrigerant 12 is approximately 121 g/mol (since CCl2F2 is 12 + 2*35.5 + 2*19 = 12 +71 +38 = 121 g/mol). So the gas constant R is 1716 (universal gas constant) / 121 g/mol ≈ 14.18 ft-lbf per lb-R.

Wait, 1716 ft-lbf/(lb-mol·R) divided by molecular weight in lb-mol (121 lb-mol is 121 lb). So 1716 /121 ≈ 14.18 ft-lbf per lb-R.

So R ≈ 14.18 ft-lbf/(lb·R).

Now, assuming the process is isentropic, the work can be calculated using:

W = (P2V2 - P1V1) / (J) (where J is the mechanical equivalent of heat, 778 ft-lbf/Btu), but without specific volumes, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, if I can find the specific volumes v1 and v2 using the ideal gas law, then I can compute the work as integral of PdV.

Wait, but for an ideal gas, the work done during a compression from P1, T1 to P2, T2 can be found if we know the specific heat ratio (gamma). The formula for work in an isentropic process is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(gamma-1), but without knowing gamma, that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between temperatures and pressures for an isentropic process: T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^((gamma-1)/gamma).

But without knowing gamma for Refrigerant 12, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe I can approximate gamma. For many gases, gamma is around 1.3 to 1.4. Let's say approximately 1.3.

So, T1 is 30°F, which is 30 + 459.67 = 489.67 R.

T2 is 150°F, which is 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 R.

The pressure ratio P2/P1 is 140/20 =7.

So, using the isentropic relation:

(T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^((gamma-1)/gamma)

Let me plug in the numbers:

609.67 / 489.67 ≈ 1.244.

So, 1.244 = 7^((gamma-1)/gamma)

Take natural logs:

ln(1.244) = (gamma-1)/gamma * ln(7)

ln(1.244) ≈ 0.215.

ln(7) ≈ 1.946.

So,

0.215 = (gamma-1)/gamma * 1.946

0.215 / 1.946 ≈ (gamma -1)/gamma → approx 0.1104 = (gamma-1)/gamma.

Multiply both sides by gamma:

0.1104 gamma = gamma -1 → gamma -0.1104 gamma =1 → 0.8896 gamma=1 → gamma≈1.123.

Hmm, that's lower than the typical gamma for diatomic gases. Maybe Refrigerant 12 has a lower gamma. But without exact data, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is not isentropic, so this approach might not work.

Wait, but perhaps the work done can be found using the ideal gas equation for the process.

Assuming that the process is a polytropic process, P V^n = constant, where n is the polytropic index. Then, the work done is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(1 - n) ), but again, without knowing n, this isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should use the first law: Q = ΔU + W.

But without knowing Q, I can't find W. Alternatively, perhaps I can find ΔU using the specific heat at constant volume (Cv) and the temperature change.

So, ΔU = m * Cv * (T2 - T1), where T is in absolute units.

Similarly, if I can find Cv, then I can compute ΔU.

But I don't have Cv for Refrigerant 12. Alternatively, using the ideal gas relation, Cv = R/(gamma-1). But again, without gamma, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe I can find the work using the enthalpy change. Enthalpy change for an ideal gas is ΔH = m * Cp * (T2 - T1). And since Cp = gamma * R / (gamma -1), perhaps I can express it.

Wait, but without knowing Cp or Cv, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps using the data given in the problem. Let me think: the initial state is 20 psia and 30°F, and the final state is 140 psia and 150°F. For Refrigerant 12, I think these states are in the superheated vapor region.

If I had the Refrigerant 12 tables, I could look up the specific volume, internal energy, and enthalpy at both states.

Wait, in the absence of those tables, perhaps I should proceed with the ideal gas assumption, knowing that it's an approximation.

So, assuming ideal gas:

At state 1:
P1 = 20 psia
T1 = 30°F = 489.67 R
v1 = specific volume (ft³/lb) = (R T1) / P1 → R is 14.18 ft-lbf/(lb·R), so:

v1 = (14.18 * 489.67) / 20 → (14.18 * 489.67) ≈ 6946 → 6946 / 20 ≈ 347.3 ft³/lb.

Similarly, at state 2:
P2 =140 psia
T2=150°F=609.67 R
v2 = (14.18 * 609.67)/140 → (14.18 * 609.67) ≈ 8643 → 8643 /140 ≈ 61.74 ft³/lb.

Now, the work done during compression, assuming a reversible process (quasi-static), is:

W = - ∫ P dV from V1 to V2.

Since we're dealing with an ideal gas, and if the process is isentropic, we can compute it using:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(J (1 - n)) ), but that's if n is the polytropic index. Alternatively, for an isentropic process, the work can be expressed as:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / J, where J is 778 ft-lbf/Btu.

Wait, no, that's for a constant specific heat, maybe.

Alternatively, using the formula for work in an isentropic process:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (J (1 - n)), where n= gamma/(gamma-1).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's better to use the formula:

W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (gamma - 1) * (1 - (P1/P2)^((gamma-1)/gamma)) )

Wait, but again, without gamma, this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the enthalpy change.

ΔH = H2 - H1 = m * Cp (T2 - T1).

But without Cp, I can't compute this.

Wait, but for Refrigerant 12, I think the specific heat at constant pressure is around 0.15 Btu/lb·°F. Hmm, I'm not certain about this value, but let's proceed with that approximation.

Cp ≈ 0.15 Btu/lb·°F.

Then, ΔH = 1 lb * 0.15 Btu/lb·°F * (150 - 30)°F → 0.15 * 120 = 18 Btu.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps Cp is around 0.2 Btu/lb·°F.

Wait, 0.2 * 120 = 24 Btu. Hmm.

Wait, the work done in a steady-flow compressor is given by the change in enthalpy, assuming adiabatic and other losses are negligible. So if the process
