Okay, so I need to answer this question about the ancient city of Cahokia. The question has two blanks: the first is about the number of a certain structure, and the second is about the population. I remember that Cahokia was a significant pre-Columbian city, located near present-day St. Louis. I think it was the largest city in what's now the United States before European colonization.

The options are A through J, each giving two numbers. I'm trying to recall what I know about Cahokia. I remember that it's known for its large earthen mounds, which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. The most famous one is Monks Mound, which is the largest pre-Columbian earthen pyramid north of Mexico.

So, the question is about how many structures and the population. I think Cahokia had a population around 20,000 to maybe 40,000 in its peak. Wait, but some sources say it might have been as high as 40,000, which made it one of the largest cities in the Americas at the time.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E says 80 ceremonial mounds and a population of 50,000. I'm not sure about 80 mounds; maybe that's too high. I think the number of mounds is more like around 100 or so. Option C says 120 earthen mounds and 10,000 population. Hmm, that population seems low. I thought it was higher, like around 40,000.

Wait, option A says 40 residential complexes and 40,000 population. That seems plausible. Or option E with 80 ceremonial mounds and 50k. I need to think about the structures. I remember that Cahokia had a large number of mounds, maybe over 100. So, looking at the options, option F has 200 pyramidal mounds but a population of 200,000, which sounds too high. I don't think the population was that large.

Option E has 80 ceremonial mounds, which is possible, but the population at 50k might be a bit high. I'm not sure. Alternatively, option C has 120 earthen mounds, which could include both ceremonial and others. If the population was around 10k, that seems low. From what I recall, Cahokia's population peaked around 40,000, making it a major urban center.

Looking back, option A says 40 residential complexes and 40k population. That sounds right. But I'm a bit confused because I think the number of mounds was higher than 40. Wait, the question says "more than" a certain number. So option A says more than 40 residential complexes. But I'm not sure if the structures in question are mounds or residential complexes. The first blank is about the number of structures, which in Cahokia's case would be the mounds.

Wait, I think the mounds were numerous. I've heard that there were around 120 mounds in Cahokia. So looking at the options, option C says 120 earthen mounds and 10k population. But the population was higher, so maybe that's not right. Alternatively, option E says 80 ceremonial mounds and 50k population. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the population first. If the population was around 40,000, which option has that? Option A has 40k. So the first part would be more than 40 residential complexes. But I'm not sure about the exact number of structures. Alternatively, maybe the mounds were around 120, which would make option C's first part correct, but the population in C is only 10k, which I think is too low.

I'm a bit torn. Another approach: I remember that Cahokia had a population of around 20,000 to 40,000. So the options that have 40k or 50k would be more accurate. Option A has 40k, and option E has 50k. Now, which structure count matches? If the structures are mounds, then I think it's more than 100. Option C has 120, which would fit the "more than" part. But then the population in C is 10k, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the structures. Maybe the question is about residential complexes. If the first blank is about residential complexes, then maybe option A is correct with more than 40 and 40k population.

Alternatively, I think the number of mounds was around 120, so option C could be correct, but the population doesn't fit. Hmm. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, I think the correct answer is E: 80 ceremonial mounds and 50,000 population. Or maybe it's A. I'm not entirely certain, but leaning towards E because I think the population was higher, around 40k to 50k, but I'm not sure about the exact number of mounds.

Alternatively, I recall that Cahokia had around 120 mounds, so option C would be 120 earthen mounds and 10k population, which doesn't fit because the population was higher. So maybe the answer is E, even if the mounds are 80, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: I think the population was around 40,000, which would point to option A, which has 40k. But does it have enough structures? Option A says more than 40 residential complexes. If they had more than 40, that's plausible. So perhaps the answer is A.

But I'm not entirely sure. I'm trying to remember if the structures were more like mounds or residential areas. Since the question's first blank is about structures, and Cahokia is famous for its mounds, maybe the correct option is C or E.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. I think the correct answer is E: 80 ceremonial mounds and 50,000 population, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the population was around 40k, making option A correct.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. I remember that Cahokia was the largest city, with a population estimated between 20,000 and 40,000. So the options with 40k or 50k are possible. Now, the structures: if the question is about mounds, then the number is higher. Option C has 120, which is a high number, but the population is 10k, which is too low. So maybe the answer isn't C.

Option E has 80 mounds and 50k population. That might fit if the population was on the higher side. Alternatively, maybe the number of mounds is around 100, so option F has 200, which is too high.

I'm a bit stuck. Another thought: the correct answer is E. Because I think the population was around 50,000, making it one of the largest cities. But I'm not entirely sure about the mounds. Alternatively, I might have heard that it had around 100 mounds, but none of the options exactly say that.

Wait, looking at the options again: option E is 80 ceremonial mounds, and 50k. Option C is 120 earthen mounds, 10k. Since I think the population was higher, I'm more inclined towards E, even if the mounds are 80 instead of 120. Maybe I was mistaken about the number of mounds.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: 40 residential complexes and 40k population. That seems plausible too. I'm not entirely certain, but I'll go with option E because I think the population was around 50k, and 80 mounds sounds reasonable.

The ancient city of Cahokia was a significant pre-Columbian urban center, located near present-day St. Louis. It is renowned for its large earthen mounds, particularly Monks Mound, the largest pre-Columbian earthen pyramid north of Mexico. The population of Cahokia is estimated to have been between 20,000 and 40,000 at its peak, making it one of the largest cities in the Americas at the time. The number of mounds, which served ceremonial and religious purposes, is believed to have been around 120, though this figure could vary.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: 40 residential complexes and 40,000 population. This aligns with the population estimate but focuses on residential complexes rather than mounds, which are more emblematic of Cahokia.
- **Option C**: 120 earthen mounds and 10,000 population. The number of mounds fits, but the population is too low.
- **Option E**: 80 ceremonial mounds and 50,000 population. The population is on the higher end of estimates, and the number of mounds is plausible, though slightly lower than some sources suggest.

Given the focus on mounds and the population, **Option E** seems most consistent, as it reflects a reasonable number of ceremonial mounds and a population closer to the higher estimates for Cahokia.

Answer: E
