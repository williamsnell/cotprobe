Okay, so I've got this question about the nitrate ion and its resonance forms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the nitrate ion is NO3^- . Nitrogen is the central atom with three oxygen atoms around it. Nitrogen typically has five valence electrons, and each oxygen has six. Since it's an ion with a -1 charge, that adds an extra electron, making the total valence electrons... let's calculate that.

Nitrogen has 5 electrons, each oxygen has 6, so 5 + 3*6 = 23. But wait, the charge is -1, so we add one more electron, making it 24 electrons in total. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, each oxygen contributes 6, right? So 3 oxygens is 18, plus 5 from nitrogen, that's 23. Then the charge is -1, which adds an electron, so 24 total.

Now, in the Lewis structure, we have to distribute these electrons. Nitrate ion has a trigonal planar shape, I think, because of resonance. So each resonance form has a double bond between N and one O, and single bonds with the other two oxygens. But wait, how does that work with the electrons?

Let's think about one resonance structure. The central nitrogen is double-bonded to one oxygen and single-bonded to the other two. So each double bond is one sigma and one pi bond, right? And single bonds are just sigma bonds.

So in one structure, for the double bond, there's 1 sigma and 1 pi. Each single bond is a sigma. So, how many sigma bonds in total? Let's count. The central N is bonded to three O's. If one is double (so one sigma), and the other two are single (so two sigma each?), wait no. Wait, each bond is a sigma. So regardless of single or multiple bonds, each bond contributes one sigma. So for each of the three N-O bonds, there's a sigma bond. So that's three sigma bonds from N to O.

Wait, but wait. Each double bond is one sigma and one pi. So in the structure where N is double bonded to one O and single to the others, the double bond has one sigma and one pi. The two single bonds each have one sigma. So total sigma bonds would be 3 (one from each N-O bond). But wait, the double bond is also a sigma plus a pi. So sigma bonds are from each N-O bond, regardless of being single or double.

Wait, let me get this straight. Each single bond is one sigma bond. Each double bond is one sigma and one pi bond. So in the nitrate ion's structure, each resonance form has one double bond. So that's one sigma and one pi from the double bond, and two sigma bonds from the single bonds. So total sigma bonds would be 3 (one from each N-O) because each bond, single or double, contributes one sigma. So 3 sigma bonds in total.

And pi bonds? Only the double bond contributes a pi bond. So in each resonance form, there's one pi bond.

Wait, but wait a second. In a single structure, each resonance form shows one double bond. So each form has one pi bond. But in reality, the pi bonds are delocalized across all three oxygens. But the question is about each resonance form, so in each individual form, there's only one pi bond.

So each resonance form has 3 sigma bonds (from the three N-O bonds) and 1 pi bond (from the double bond in that form). So the answer would be 3 sigma and 1 pi.

Looking at the options, option B says 3 sigma and 1 pi. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The total number of bonds in the structure would be 3 single bonds and one double bond? No, wait, each structure has two single bonds and one double bond. Because there are three N-O bonds total. So in each resonance form, N has a double bond with one O and single bonds with the other two. So for each structure, three sigma bonds (each N-O is a sigma) and one pi bond (from the double bond). So yeah, 3 sigma and 1 pi.

So the correct answer is option B.

Each resonance form of the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) has three sigma bonds and one pi bond. The nitrate ion is a trigonal planar molecule with delocalized electrons, and its Lewis structure can be represented by three resonance forms. In each resonance form, one of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds is a double bond (consisting of one sigma and one pi bond), while the other two are single bonds (each consisting of one sigma bond). 

Since each bond, whether single or double, contributes one sigma bond, there are a total of three sigma bonds in each resonance form. Additionally, the double bond contributes one pi bond. Therefore, each resonance form of NO₃⁻ has 3 sigma bonds and 1 pi bond.

The correct answer is:

B: 3 sigma and 1 pi

Answer: B
