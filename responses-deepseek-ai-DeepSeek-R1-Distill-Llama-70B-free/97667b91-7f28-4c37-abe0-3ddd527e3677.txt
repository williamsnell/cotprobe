Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about slander, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let me start by recalling what I know about defamation, specifically slander and libel.

First, I remember that defamation is the act of making false statements that harm someone's reputation. There are two types: libel and slander. Libel is written or published defamation, like in newspapers or online, while slander is spoken defamation. So looking at the options, B says "It is spoken defamation," which aligns with that. So B is true, which means it's not the correct answer to this question.

Now, looking at option A: "The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement for it to be considered slander." Wait, I think there's something about intent here. I remember that for slander, there's something called "slander per se" and "slander per quod." Slander per se doesn't require proof of damages because the statement is so obviously harmful. But for regular slander, the plaintiff usually needs to prove special damages, which are actual financial losses. However, does the accused have to intentionally spread the lie? I think that in some cases, like negligence, it can still be slander. So maybe A is not entirely accurate. Or perhaps it's about whether the statement was spoken with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard. Hmm, I need to think more on that.

Option C says there are four slander per se categories. From what I recall, slander per se typically includes four categories: (1) criminal conduct, (2) having a "loathsome" disease (like STDs), (3) adultery, and (4) professional misconduct. So C is correct, so it's not the answer.

Option D: "Slander is less serious than libel." I remember that historically, libel was considered more serious because written words are more permanent. But modern law treats them similarly, though some jurisdictions may still have differences. But generally, slander is indeed often considered less serious, so D is true, not the answer.

Option E: "Plaintiff has to prove special damages, unless it falls into slander per se." That sounds right. In slander cases, unless it's per se, the plaintiff must show special damages (like financial loss). So E is correct.

Option F: "The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se." Wait, slander is spoken, so publication usually refers to communication to a third party. For slander per se, I think the statement is so inherently harmful that the law presumes damage, so the plaintiff doesn't need to prove actual harm. But does that mean the statement doesn't have to be published? Wait, no. For slander, the statement must be communicated to a third party. So even in slander per se, the statement must have been published (i.e., spoken to someone else). So F is saying it doesn't have to be published, which I think is incorrect. So F might be the false statement.

Option G: "Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress." No, that's not right. For slander, unless it's per se, you usually need to show special damages, which are financial. Emotional distress alone (general damages) isn't enough unless it's slander per se. So G is incorrect because it's saying slander is only applicable if emotional distress is proven, which isn't the case. Wait, but wait: some jurisdictions might allow for emotional distress as part of damages, but the key is that for regular slander, you need special damages. So G's statement is incorrect because slander can be actionable without emotional distress if special damages are shown. Alternatively, if the statement is slander per se, then damages are presumed, which might include emotional distress, but G's statement is too restrictive. So G is not true, making it a possible answer.

Wait, but let me clarify each option again.

The question is asking which option is not true about slander.

Option F says the statement doesn't have to be published if it's slander per se. But in reality, for slander, the statement must be spoken to a third party (i.e., published) regardless of whether it's per se or not. The difference is that per se doesn't require proof of damages because they are presumed. So F is false because even in slander per se, the statement must be communicated to someone else.

Option G claims that slander is only applicable if emotional distress is proven. But for regular slander, you don't need emotional distress; you need special damages (like lost business). So G is not true because slander can be actionable based on financial loss without emotional distress.

Wait, but the question is which statement is NOT true about slander. So looking back:

Option G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress. Is this correct?

No, because slander can be actionable by proving special damages (like financial loss) without necessarily showing emotional distress. So G is incorrect, making it the statement that's not true.

Wait, but I thought F was incorrect because the statement must be published. So which one is the false statement?

Let me go through each option again.

Option A: Must have intentionally spread the false statement. I think that's not necessarily true because slander can also be based on negligence, not just intentional spreading. So A is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought A might be incorrect. Let me think. In some jurisdictions, for slander, the plaintiff must show that the defendant was at least negligent in making the false statement. So if the statement was made without any fault (like innocently), it might not be slander. So the statement in A says it must be intentionally spread. Is that true? Or can it be done negligently?

I think in common law, slander required a showing of malice (intent), but in many places now, it's enough to show that the defendant was negligent. So if A says "must have intentionally spread," that's incorrect because it could be due to negligence. So A is not true, making it the answer. But wait, I'm getting confused because different sources might vary.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline each option:

Option A: The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement for it to be considered slander.

- Is intent required? Or is negligence sufficient?

In many jurisdictions, for slander (which is spoken), the standard is negligence, not intent. So the statement in A is incorrect because intent isn't required. So A is false, making it the correct answer to the question.

But I'm a bit unsure because I'm trying to recall. Let's see: libel is usually more serious and sometimes requires actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard), but slander can be based on negligence. So if A says it's required to be intentional, that's not true. So A is false.

Wait, but I thought earlier that F and G were incorrect. But now, focusing on A, it seems incorrect.

So which options are incorrect:

- A: Incorrect, because intent isn't required, negligence suffices.

- F: Incorrect, because even slander per se requires publication (being spoken to a third party).

- G: Incorrect, because slander can be proven with special damages without emotional distress.

So the question is which is NOT true about slander.

So the options are:

The question is which is not true. So among the options, which statement is false.

So the correct answer would be the option that's false.

Looking back at the options, the question is which is NOT true.

So for example, option G: "Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress." That's false because slander can be actionable with special damages, which are about financial loss, not necessarily emotional distress.

Similarly, option A is false if it's asserting that intent is required.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this by process of elimination.

The question: which is NOT true about slander.

Looking at each option:

A: Must have intentionally spread the false statement.

- As I thought, slander can be based on negligence, so A is false.

B: It's spoken defamation. True.

C: 4 categories of slander per se. True.

D: Slander less serious than libel. True.

E: Plaintiff must prove special damages unless per se. True.

F: Statement doesn't have to be published if per se. False, because publication (to a third party) is required.

G: Slander only applicable if emotional distress proven. False, because you can have slander without emotional distress if you have special damages.

So the options that are not true are A, F, and G.

But the question is which is not true, so only one of them is the correct answer.

Wait, the options are:

A: Must have intentionally spread.

F: Doesn't have to be published.

G: Only applicable if emotional distress.

So, which one is definitely not true.

In slander, the statement must be published (spoken to someone else) regardless of per se or not. So F is false.

In slander, you don't have to prove emotional distress unless it's per se, but even then, per se presumes damages. So G is false because slander can be actionable without proving emotional distress.

A is false because intent isn't required, only negligence.

So which of these is one of the options given.

The question is asking which is NOT true, so the incorrect statements are A, F, and G.

But looking at the options, the answer choices are A through G, so the correct answer is one of them.

Now, looking at the options provided in the problem, let's read carefully:

The options are A to G, and the possible answers are A to J, but I think the options are A to G, each labeled as such.

Wait, the user provided the options as A to G.

The question is to select the correct answer from A to J, but the options provided are A to G.

So the possible correct answers are among A to G.

Now, going back to the question: which is NOT true about slander.

So which of the options A to G is false.

Let me think again.

Option A: Must have intentionally spread the false statement.

- In many jurisdictions, slander requires negligence, not intent. So A is false.

Option F: The statement doesn't have to be published if it's slander per se.

- No, even in slander per se, the statement must be published (spoken to a third party). So F is false.

Option G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove emotional distress.

- This is false because slander can be actionable with special damages, which are financial, not emotional.

So the question is which option is not true, so which is false.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true about slander.

So, among the options, A, F, and G are false statements about slander.

But the options are:

A: Accused must have intentionally spread.

F: Doesn't have to be published.

G: Only applicable if emotional distress proven.

So which one is the correct answer.

Looking back at the possible options, the correct answer is G: Slander is only applicable if plaintiff can prove emotional distress.

Wait, but I thought that for slander, you don't need to prove emotional distress unless it's per se, but even then, in per se cases, damages are presumed, which may include emotional distress. So G's statement is false because slander can be actionable without proving emotional distress.

Alternatively, option A is false because intent isn't required—negligence is sufficient.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check what each option says.

Option G says: "Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress."

That's incorrect because slander can be actionable by proving special damages (like financial loss), without needing to show emotional distress. So G is not true.

Option A says: "The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement for it to be considered slander." As I thought earlier, slander can be based on negligence, not just intent. So A is not true.

Now, which one is the correct answer to the question.

The question is asking which is NOT true.

So if A is not true, and G is not true, then both A and G are incorrect. But the options only allow one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: Must have intentionally spread.

- In common law, slander required malice (intent), but in many modern jurisdictions, negligence suffices. So A is not true.

Option F: Doesn't have to be published if per se.

- Publication is required even in per se cases. So F is false.

Option G: Only applicable if emotional distress is proven.

- Slander is actionable with special damages, so G is false.

So all three are false, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Looking back, the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So I need to figure out which one is the best fit.

The question is about what is NOT true about slander.

Option G: Slander only applicable if plaintiff can prove emotional distress.

That's not true because, for regular slander, you don't need to prove emotional distress; you need special damages. So G is not true.

Option A: Must have intentionally spread.

If the statement requires intent, that's not true because negligence suffices. So A is not true.

So both A and G are incorrect.

Wait, but the question has only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the elements of slander.

Slander requires:

1. False statement of fact.

2. About the plaintiff.

3. Published to a third party.

4. Caused damage (unless slander per se, where damage is presumed).

5. At least negligence on the part of the defendant.

So for element 5, it's negligence, not intent. So option A is incorrect because it's stating that intent is required.

Therefore, option A is not true, making it the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought G was incorrect. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G because it's stating that emotional distress must be proven, which isn't the case.

But wait, slander per se doesn't require proof of damages, including emotional distress. So in that case, G is incorrect because even without emotional distress, if it's slander per se, it's actionable.

So between A and G, which is the incorrect statement.

The question is which is NOT true about slander.

So, if A is not true, then it's the answer. If G is not true, it's the answer.

But I think the correct answer is G.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should approach it differently.

The possible answers are A to G, and I need to select the one that's false.

Option G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress.

That's incorrect because slander can be actionable with special damages, which don't require emotional distress. So G is not true.

Option A: The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement.

This is incorrect because slander can be based on negligence, not intent. So A is not true.

So both A and G are incorrect. But in the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up libel and slander.

In libel, the standard is higher, often requiring actual malice (intent or reckless disregard) in cases involving public officials or figures, but slander is typically based on negligence.

So for slander, the defendant must have been at least negligent in making the false statement. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it's stating that intent is required, which isn't the case.

So the correct answer is A: The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement for it to be considered slander. This is not true because negligence suffices.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn because I thought G was also incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option is saying.

Option G says that slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove emotional distress. That's not true because slander can be proven with special damages (like lost wages), which don't require emotional distress. So G is not true.

Similarly, option A is not true because intent isn't required, just negligence.

So both A and G are false statements about slander.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is which is NOT true about slander, so the false statement.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the answer is G.

But I'm getting stuck here. I think I need to make a decision.

Based on my analysis, both A and G are incorrect, but perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps F is incorrect.

Wait, option F: The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se.

But for slander, the statement must be spoken to a third party (published). So even in slander per se, publication is required. Therefore, F is incorrect because it's saying the statement doesn't have to be published, which is false.

So which of these is the correct answer to the question.

The question is which option is NOT true about slander.

So the false statements are A, F, and G.

But the options given are A through G, and only one can be correct.

I think I need to look for the most clearly incorrect statement.

Option G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove emotional distress.

This is clearly incorrect because slander can be actionable with special damages, which are financial, not emotional.

So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but another option: The statement in F is also incorrect because even in slander per se, the statement must be published.

So which one is the correct answer.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should go with the most clearly incorrect option.

In that case, option G is incorrect because it's asserting that emotional distress must be proven, which isn't the case.

So I'll go with G as the correct answer.

To determine which statement is NOT true about slander, let's analyze each option:

1. **Option A**: "The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement for it to be considered slander."  
   - This is **not true**. Slander can be based on negligence, not just intent. The defendant only needs to have been negligent in making the false statement.

2. **Option B**: "It is spoken defamation."  
   - This is **true**. Slander is, by definition, spoken defamation, as opposed to libel, which is written.

3. **Option C**: "There are four slander per se categories."  
   - This is **true**. Slander per se includes four categories: (1) criminal conduct, (2) having a "loathsome" disease, (3) adultery, and (4) professional misconduct.

4. **Option D**: "Slander is less serious than libel."  
   - This is **true**. Historically, libel has been considered more serious because written statements are more permanent, though modern law treats them similarly.

5. **Option E**: "Plaintiff has to prove special damages, unless it falls into slander per se."  
   - This is **true**. For regular slander, the plaintiff must prove special damages (financial losses). However, slander per se presumes damages,
