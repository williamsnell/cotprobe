Okay, so I have this question about human senses and their categories. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking how human senses can be divided into two major categories based on what they gather from the outside world. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that senses are usually classified based on the type of stimuli they detect. Wait, there's something about how they detect either energy or chemicals. Oh right, like how some senses detect forms of energy, like light or sound, and others detect chemical substances, like smell and taste.

So looking at the options, option E is "energy and chemical." That sounds right because vision detects light (energy), hearing detects sound waves (mechanical energy), while taste and smell detect chemicals.

Let me think again. Vision and hearing are examples where the stimuli are forms of energy—light and sound respectively. Taste and smell are definitely about chemicals. So the two main categories would split the senses into those that sense energy (like light, sound) and those that sense chemicals (like molecules in the air for smell or in food for taste).

Other options don't seem to fit as well. Option B is internal and external, but that's more about where the stimuli come from, like internal senses (like pain) versus external (like touch). But the question is about what they gather from the outside world, so maybe that's not it.

Option A is auditory and visual, which are two specific senses, not categories. Option C is tactile and olfactory, again specific senses. Option D, biological and physical—maybe, but I'm not sure if that's a standard classification.

Option E fits because it's about the nature of the stimuli—energy versus chemicals. So the two main categories are energy-based and chemical-based senses.

The human senses can be divided into two major categories based on the type of stimuli they detect. These categories are "energy" and "chemical." Energy-based senses include vision (light) and hearing (sound waves), while chemical-based senses include smell (olfactory) and taste (gustatory). This classification reflects the nature of the stimuli each sense detects.

Answer: E
