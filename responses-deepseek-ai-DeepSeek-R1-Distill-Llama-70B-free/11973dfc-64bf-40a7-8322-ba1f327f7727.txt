Question:

Four people own a property, and they agree to convey to an adult child of one of them. There is a purchasemoney mortgage on the property for which the four signed a promissory note as security. The loan was not satisfied at the time of the conveyance. The conveyance is a deed in fee simple to the adult child. The adult child then takes over the mortgage payments. The adult child stops making the payments and conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser who does not do a title search. The purchaser sues his grantor to get an order compelling him to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from his property. Will the court more than likely grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants?

Options:

A: Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.
B: Yes, but the court will also issue an order for the original four owners to pay a portion of the outstanding mortgage.
C: No, the court will order the purchaser to resume payments on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.
D: No, the court will order the bona fide purchaser to pay the outstanding mortgage.
E: Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.
F: Yes, the court will dismiss the case because the purchaser did not conduct a title search before buying the property.
G: No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.
H: No, the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage.
I: No, the court will order the adult child and the original four owners to equally share the remaining mortgage payments.
J: Yes, because the court can only force the adult child to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me break it down step by step. Hmm, the scenario is about four people who own a property and they agree to convey it to an adult child of one of them. There's a purchase-money mortgage on the property, and all four signed a promissory note as security. The loan wasn't satisfied when they conveyed the property. Then, the adult child takes over the mortgage payments but stops making them. The adult child then conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser who didn't do a title search. Now, the purchaser is suing their grantor (the adult child) to get an order to pay the mortgage and remove the lien. The question is whether the court will grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants.

Wait, so the key points here are: the original four owners conveyed the property to the adult child. The mortgage was still active, and they all signed the promissory note. Then the adult child took over payments but defaulted. Then they sold it to a BFP without a title search. Now the BFP is suing the adult child.

I remember that when a property is sold, especially with a mortgage, the buyer usually takes over the mortgage payments. But if the buyer doesn't pay, the lender can foreclose, right? But in this case, the BFP is suing the grantor (adult child) to make them pay the mortgage.

So, the issue is about who is responsible for the mortgage after the conveyance. The original four owners signed the promissory note, so they're personally liable. The adult child took over the property and the mortgage payments, but when they stop paying, does the liability fall back on the original owners, or is the adult child solely responsible?

Wait, no, the original four were on the promissory note, so they are personally liable, but the adult child, when they took the property, probably assumed the mortgage. So the adult child would be responsible for the mortgage payments. If they default, the lender can go after both the original four (if the mortgage is still in their name) or the new owner, depending on how the assumption works.

But in this case, the adult child conveyed the property to a BFP without paying off the mortgage. The BFP didn't do a title search, so they might not know about the mortgage. But as a BFP, they take the property free of any encumbrances except those they know about or are recorded. Wait, but the mortgage was already on the property when the original four owned it. So when the adult child took it, the mortgage was still there. Then the adult child sold it to the BFP without paying the mortgage, so the mortgage lien would still be on the property.

But the BFP is suing the grantor (adult child) to force them to pay the mortgage. The question is whether the court will dismiss the case, meaning the BFP can't compel the adult child to pay.

I think the concept here is that the BFP takes the property subject to the mortgage unless they explicitly assume it. But wait, when someone buys property, they usually either assume the mortgage or the seller pays it off. If the seller doesn't pay it off, and the buyer doesn't assume it, the mortgage remains, and the seller is still liable. But the buyer might have to deal with the lender foreclosing.

Wait, but if the buyer is a BFP and didn't know about the mortgage, maybe they can hold the seller responsible. But in this case, the BFP didn't do a title search, which is a mistake. Because if a buyer doesn't do due diligence, they might be stuck with the mortgage.

So, the options are about whether the court will grant the dismissal. Option A says yes, it's the risk the purchaser took by not doing a title search. That makes sense because the purchaser should have known about the mortgage if they did a proper search. So the court would likely dismiss the case because the purchaser can't now force the seller to pay the mortgage; it's their own problem for not ensuring the title was clear.

Option B says yes, but the court will also order the original four to pay part. I don't think so because the original four were the ones who conveyed to the adult child, and the mortgage was their responsibility. But when they conveyed, maybe the liability shifted. Wait, if the adult child assumed the mortgage, then the original four might be released from liability, depending on state law. Or maybe they're still liable if the mortgage wasn't properly assumed.

But regardless, the BFP is suing the adult child, not the original four. So the court's dismissal would be based on the BFP's failure to check the title, not about the original owners.

Option C says no, the court will order the purchaser to resume payments. That doesn't make sense because the purchaser is the one suing. They wouldn't be ordered to pay; they might be stuck with the mortgage, though.

Option D says the court orders the BFP to pay. That doesn't seem right because the BFP is suing the grantor, not the other way around.

Option E says yes, because the court can only force the original four. But again, the suit is against the adult child, not the original four, so this might not apply.

Option F says yes, because the purchaser didn't do a title search. That aligns with option A. Both A and F seem similar.

Wait, but option A says it's the purchaser's risk, whereas F says the court dismisses because no title search. They might be similar but phrased differently.

Wait, the answer options are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Yes, purchaser's risk for not doing a title search and not having the seller pay at closing.

Option F: Yes, court dismisses because purchaser didn't do a title search.

Hmm, so both A and F are about the purchaser's failure. But I think the main point is that the purchaser, as a BFP, would typically take the property free of encumbrances, but only if they did a proper search. Since they didn't, they can't now force the seller to clear the title. So the court would likely dismiss, as the purchaser should have ensured the mortgage was paid off at closing through a title search and arrangements.

So the correct answer would be A or F. Wait, but what's the difference between them? Option A says it's the risk the purchaser took because they didn't have the title company arrange payment. Option F says the dismissal is because no title search was done.

In real estate, it's standard for the buyer to hire a title company to ensure the title is clear and that any liens are paid off at closing. If the buyer didn't do that, they can't later hold the seller responsible for liens they should have discovered. So the court would dismiss the case, agreeing with the defendant's motion. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but option A says "the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements..." So yes, that's the reasoning. So I think the answer is A.

The question revolves around a real estate transaction where four original owners convey a property to an adult child, subject to a purchase-money mortgage. The adult child assumes mortgage payments but defaults, then conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who did not conduct a title search. The BFP sues the adult child to compel payment of the mortgage and removal of the lien. The issue is whether the court will grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants.

Key points:
1. The original four owners signed the promissory note and are personally liable for the mortgage.
2. The adult child took over the property and assumed the mortgage payments but defaulted.
3. The BFP purchased the property without conducting a title search, which would have revealed the outstanding mortgage.
4. The BFP is suing the adult child to force payment of the mortgage.

Analysis of options:
- **Option A**: Correct. The purchaser took the risk of not conducting a title search and ensuring the mortgage was paid off at closing. This aligns with the principle that buyers are responsible for ensuring clear title, typically through a title company.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The court is unlikely to involve the original four owners in this dispute, as the BFP is suing the adult child, not the original owners.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The court would not order the purchaser to resume payments, as the purchaser is the plaintiff seeking relief.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The court would not order the BFP to pay the mortgage; the BFP is seeking to compel the adult child to pay.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The court cannot force the original four owners to pay the mortgage, as the BFP is not suing them.
- **Option F**: Similar to A but focuses on the absence of a title search. While related, A more directly addresses the purchaser's failure to ensure the mortgage was paid at closing.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The adult child is responsible for the mortgage after assuming it, but the court is unlikely to order them to resume payments in this context.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The original four owners are not parties to this suit and have no legal responsibility to defend the adult child.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The court would not order the adult child and original four owners to share payments, as the BFP is suing only the adult child.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The court cannot force the adult child to pay the mortgage in full, as the BFP is seeking to compel payment, not assume responsibility.

The most accurate answer is **A**, as it reflects the principle that the purchaser bears the risk of not ensuring the mortgage was paid off at closing, either through a title search or arrangements with a title company.

Answer: A
