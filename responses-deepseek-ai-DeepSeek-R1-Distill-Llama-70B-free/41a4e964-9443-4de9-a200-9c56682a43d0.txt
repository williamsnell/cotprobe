Okay, so I have this question about tea, and I need to figure out which one is known for its bergamot flavor. Let me think. I remember that bergamot is a citrus fruit, and it's often used in teas to give a specific taste. 

Wait, isn't Earl Grey tea the one with bergamot? I think that's right. Earl Grey has that distinctive citrus flavor because bergamot oil is added to the tea leaves. But I'm a bit confused because I also remember that sometimes other teas might have bergamot, but Earl Grey is the most famous one.

Looking at the options, option D is Earl. So that should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I'm not mixing it up with any other. English Breakfast is more of a strong black tea without any citrus. Jasmine tea has floral notes, not citrus. Sencha is a Japanese green tea, so that's different. Oolong is a partially fermented tea, no bergamot there. Assam is another strong black tea. Rooibos is a herbal tea from South Africa, so that's not it. Grey Darjeeling... wait, Darjeeling is a type of tea, but Grey Darjeeling would imply bergamot, but I think that's not a standard name. Maybe that's a trick option. Prince of Wales, I'm not too sure about that one, but I don't recall it being associated with bergamot. Chai is spiced tea with cinnamon, ginger, etc., so no citrus there.

So yeah, the answer should be D: Earl.
