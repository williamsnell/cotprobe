Okay, so I'm trying to solve this logic problem. Let me take it step by step. The question gives me a formula in propositional logic and asks me to translate it into an English sentence using the provided key. The formula is ~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E). 

First, I need to break down the formula. Let's remember that '⊃' is the implication operator, which translates to 'if-then'. The tilde '~' is negation, so it means 'not'. The bullet operator '•' is conjunction, meaning 'and'.

So the formula is two parts connected by 'and': the first part is ~(A ⊃ B), and the second part is (B ⊃ ~E).

Let me tackle each part separately. 

Starting with the first part: ~(A ⊃ B). In logic, A ⊃ B is the same as 'if A then B' or 'A implies B'. The negation of that would be 'it is not the case that A implies B'. But wait, how do I express the negation of an implication?

I remember that A ⊃ B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B (not A or B). So the negation of that would be ~ (~A ∨ B ), which simplifies to A ∧ ~B (A and not B). So ~(A ⊃ B) is equivalent to A and not B. 

Wait, but in natural language, when we say "It's not the case that if A then B," it's a bit tricky. Because in English, "A implies B" sometimes is understood as a conditional, but the negation isn't straightforward. So for the first part, ~(A⊃B) would mean that it's not true that A being true leads to B being true. So in plain English, it could be phrased as "Marina reading a Percy Jackson book does not necessarily lead to Izzy playing Minecraft." Or more accurately, "It's not the case that if Marina reads a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft."

Now the second part is (B ⊃ ~E). Translating that, it's "If B then not E." So in English, "If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh does not stop by."

Putting it all together, the entire formula is saying that both these conditions hold: the first implication is negated, and the second implication is true. So the whole statement is "It is not the case that Marina's reading leads to Izzy playing Minecraft, and if Izzy does play, then Ashleigh won't stop by."

Now, looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this structure.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: "It's not true that Marina reading a Percy Jackson book causes Izzy to play Minecraft, but it is true that if Izzy plays Minecraft, Ashleigh won't stop by." This seems to match. The first part is the negation of A implying B, and the second part is B implying not E.

Option B: Talks about Marina reading only when Izzy plays, which is different. The negation of A→B is not the same as B→A. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Says Marina's reading has no effect on Izzy, which is similar to the first part, but then the second part is phrased as "if Izzy does play Minecraft, Ashleigh will not stop by." That's the same as option A's second part. But the wording in C might be slightly different. Let me check the exact phrasing.

Option D: Seems to state that if Marina reads, Izzy doesn't play. That's different because it's A→~B, not the negation of A→B. So D is incorrect.

Option E: "It's not the case that Marina's reading entails Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by." This matches the structure. The first part is the negation of A→B, and the second part is B→~E. So E is also a possible correct answer.

Wait, I need to be careful. Option A says "it's not true that Marina reading ... causes Izzy to play," which is ~(A→B), and the second part is as expected. Option E uses "entails" which is similar to 'implies.' So both A and E seem correct in structure. But looking at the wording, option A uses "causes," which is a stronger term than 'implies' or 'entails.' In logic, implication doesn't necessarily mean causation, but in the context of the question, they might be using it interchangeably.

Wait, the original formula is ~(A→B), which is the same as 'A does not imply B.' So in English, that could be phrased as "It's not the case that A implies B," not necessarily about causation. So perhaps option E is more accurate because it uses 'entails' which directly relates to implication.

Alternatively, option A uses 'causes,' which might imply a causal relationship, which the logical implication doesn't necessarily require. So maybe E is more precise.

Wait, but looking back, the question's options include both. Let me read again.

Option E says: "It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by." So that correctly captures the two parts: ~(A→B) and (B→~E).

Option A says: "It's not true that Marina reading a Percy Jackson book causes Izzy to play Minecraft, but it is true that if Izzy plays Minecraft, Ashleigh won't stop by." So the first part is about causation, which is a bit different from implication.

Wait, but the original formula is about implication, not causation. So perhaps the correct translation shouldn't use 'causes' but rather 'implies' or 'entails.' So option E might be the better choice.

Wait, but looking again, the first part of option E says "It's not the case that Marina's reading entails Izzy plays." So that's ~(A→B). The second part is "Izzy's playing entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by," which is (B→~E). So that fits perfectly.

Option A uses 'causes,' which may not be the intended translation. The formula is about implication, so 'entails' is more accurate. So I think option E is correct.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is ~(A→B) and (B→~E). So in English, "It's not the case that if Marina reads, then Izzy plays Minecraft, and if Izzy plays, then Ashleigh doesn't stop by."

Option E says: "It's not the case that Marina's reading entails Izzy plays, but Izzy's playing entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by." So it's matching exactly.

Option A talks about 'causes,' which is a bit off because implication doesn't necessarily mean causation. So I think E is the correct answer.

The formula provided is `~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E)`. Breaking it down:

1. **First Part: `~(A ⊃ B)`**  
   This represents the negation of the implication "If A, then B." In logic, this is equivalent to "A and not B" or "It is not the case that A implies B." In natural language, this translates to "It's not true that Marina reading a Percy Jackson book entails Izzy playing Minecraft."

2. **Second Part: `(B ⊃ ~E)`**  
   This represents the implication "If B, then not E." In natural language, this translates to "If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh does not stop by."

Combining these, the formula asserts two things:  
- It is not the case that Marina's reading entails Izzy playing Minecraft.  
- If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh does not stop by.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Refers to "causes," which introduces a causal relationship not explicitly stated in the formula. The formula deals with implication, not causation, so this is less precise.  
- **Option B**: Suggests "Marina reads only when Izzy plays," which misrepresents the first part of the formula.  
- **Option C**: States "Marina's reading has no effect on Izzy," which is ambiguous and does not align with the logical structure.  
- **Option D**: Claims "If Marina reads, Izzy doesn't play Minecraft," which is A → ~B, not the negation of A → B.  
- **Option E**: Accurately translates the formula: "It's not the case that Marina's reading entails Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by."  
- **Option F**: Misrepresents the second part by stating "Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by," which is not equivalent to `(B ⊃ ~E)`.  
- **Option G**: Incorrectly suggests "If Marina doesn't read, then Izzy doesn't play," which is not part of the formula.  
- **Option H**: Incorrectly states "If Izzy doesn't play, Ashleigh stops by," which is the converse of `(B ⊃ ~E)`.  
- **Option I**: Claims "Marina's reading entails Izzy plays," which contradicts the first part of the formula.  
- **Option J**: Suggests "If Marina doesn't read, Izzy plays," which is not part of the formula.

**Option E** is the most accurate translation of the formula, as it correctly captures both `~(A ⊃ B)` and `(B ⊃ ~E)` without introducing extraneous ideas or misrepresenting the logical structure.

**Answer: E**
