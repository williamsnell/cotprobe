Okay, so I've got this problem here where James took a loan of $240 for 30 days at 6% interest. I need to figure out how much interest he has to pay. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky, but the basic formula is usually something like I = P * R * T. Wait, P is principal, R is the rate, and T is time, right? But wait, the time here is in days, so I might need to convert that into years because the interest rate is probably an annual rate.

So, the principal P is $240. The rate R is 6%, which I should convert to a decimal, so that's 0.06. The time T is 30 days. But wait, how do I convert 30 days into years? I think a year has 365 days, so 30 divided by 365 would give me the fraction of the year.

Let me jot that down: T = 30/365. Calculating that, 30 divided by 365 is approximately 0.08219 years.

Now, putting it all into the formula: I = 240 * 0.06 * (30/365). Let me compute that step by step.

First, 240 multiplied by 0.06. 240 times 0.06 is 14.4. Then, multiply that by (30/365). Wait, 30/365 is about 0.08219. So 14.4 * 0.08219. Let me do that multiplication.

Calculating 14.4 * 0.08219. Hmm, 14 times 0.08 is 1.12, and 0.4 * 0.08 is 0.032. But wait, maybe a better way is to compute it accurately. Let me do 14.4 multiplied by 0.08219.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 240 * 0.06 first, which is 14.4, and then multiply by 30/365. So 14.4 * (30/365). Let me compute 30 divided by 365 first. 30/365 is 6/73, approximately 0.08219.

So 14.4 multiplied by 0.08219. Let me calculate that. 14 times 0.08219 is 1.15066, and 0.4 times 0.08219 is about 0.032876. Adding those together: 1.15066 + 0.032876 = 1.183536. So approximately $1.1835.

But wait, looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Let me check the options again. The options are A: $0.36, B: $14.40, C: $3.60, D: $2.40, E: $7.20, F: $12.00, G: $0.60, H: $4.80, I: $1.80, J: $1.20.

Hmm, my calculation gave me around $1.18, which isn't exactly any of the options. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated using a different method, like simple interest for 30 days without converting to a year.

Wait, another thought: maybe the interest is calculated as 6% per month? Because sometimes loans might have monthly interest rates. But the problem says 6% interest, without specifying, so I think it's more likely an annual rate. But perhaps I should consider that 30 days is approximately a month, so maybe the rate is applied per month.

If the rate is 6% per annum, then the monthly rate would be roughly 6% / 12 = 0.5% per month. So for one month (30 days), the interest would be 0.5% of $240. Let's compute that: 0.005 * 240 = $1.20. Oh, that's option J.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the exact days, I got approximately $1.18, which is close to $1.20. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the rate as monthly, hence 6% is annual, so monthly is 0.5%, leading to $1.20 interest.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects simple interest calculated for exactly 30 days without converting to a year. Wait, maybe the 6% is a monthly rate, so 6% per month. Then the interest would be 0.06 * 240 = $14.40, which is option B. But that seems high for a 30-day loan.

Wait, the problem says 6% interest, but it doesn't specify the period. If it's 6% per annum, then my first calculation gives around $1.18. If it's 6% per month, it's $14.40. But the options have J as $1.20, which is close to my first calculation. But I'm a bit confused because the problem might not specify whether it's annual or monthly.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

I = P * R * T.

P = $240.

R = 6% per annum = 0.06.

T = 30 days = 30/365 years ≈ 0.08219178.

So I = 240 * 0.06 * (30/365).

Calculating 240 * 0.06 = 14.4.

Then 14.4 * (30/365) = 14.4 * 0.08219178.

Let me compute 14.4 * 0.08219178.

14 * 0.08219178 = 1.150679.

0.4 * 0.08219178 = 0.0328767.

Adding them: 1.150679 + 0.0328767 = 1.1835557, approximately $1.18356.

Looking at the options, the closest is J: $1.20.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as (240 * 6%) / 10, assuming it's 6% per month, but that would be 14.4, which is option B. But that would mean the interest is 6% per month, which is high.

Wait, perhaps the problem says 6% per annum, but the time is 30 days, so using (6/365)*30 = 0.49315% per day, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps it's 6% simple interest for 30 days, which might be calculated as 6% of 240 is 14.4, but that's for a year. So perhaps for 30 days, it's 14.4 * (30/365) ≈ 1.18.

So the closest option is J: $1.20.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the simple interest formula where the time is in months. So 30 days is approximately 1 month. So 6% annual rate would be 0.5% per month. So 0.5% of 240 is 1.2, so $1.20, which matches option J.

So probably the correct answer is J: $1.20.

To determine how much interest James has to pay on a $240 loan for 30 days at 6% annual interest, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$240 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = \frac{30}{365} \) (time in years).

First, calculate \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{30}{365} \approx 0.08219
\]

Next, calculate the interest:
\[
I = 240 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.08219
\]

First, compute \( 240 \cdot 0.06 \):
\[
240 \cdot 0.06 = 14.4
\]

Then, multiply by \( 0.08219 \):
\[
14.4 \cdot 0.08219 \approx 1.18356
\]

This gives approximately \( \$1.18 \). Among the options provided, the closest value is \( \$1.20 \), which corresponds to option J. This slight discrepancy likely arises from rounding or interpreting the 6% rate as an annual rate applied monthly (0.5% per month), which also yields \( \$1.20 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: \$1.20**
