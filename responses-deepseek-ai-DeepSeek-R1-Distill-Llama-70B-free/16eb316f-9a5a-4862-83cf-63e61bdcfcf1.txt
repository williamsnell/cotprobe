Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the principle of comparative advantage and whether it applies only to international trade. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that comparative advantage has something to do with why countries trade with each other. But wait, does it only apply when countries are involved, or can it be broader?

Let me think. The concept was introduced by David Ricardo, right? He used the example of England and Portugal trading wine and cloth. Portugal could make both more efficiently, but England focused on cloth because it was relatively more efficient there, while Portugal specialized in wine. That way, both countries benefited. So that's an international trade example.

But the question is asking if it's limited to just international. I think the principle is about production efficiencies. So if one entity is relatively better at producing something compared to another, they should focus on that. This doesn't necessarily have to be countries. It could be businesses, regions, or even individuals.

Wait, so if two people are deciding who should do which task, the one who's relatively better at one task should do that, even if they're better at both. Like, if I'm better at both mowing the lawn and fixing a bike, but my friend is just worse at both, but relatively better at mowing, maybe we should split tasks based on that. So comparative advantage applies there too, not just between countries.

So looking at the options. The question asks if it only applies to international trade. The correct answer should say no, it applies more broadly. Let me look at the options.

Option A: No, it's only for consumer choice. No, that's not right. It's more about production and trade between entities.

Option B: No, only services. No, Ricardo's example includes goods, so it's not just services.

Option C: Yes, neighboring countries. No, because it's not just neighboring or any specific countries, and it's not only international.

Option D: No, applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies. That sounds right because it's about relative efficiency, whether it's countries, regions, or even within a company.

Option E: Yes, only international. No, that's what the question is asking, but we think it's broader.

Option F: No, only domestic. Hmm, no, because sometimes it's international.

Option G: Only financial transactions. No, it's about production.

Option H: Barter across borders. No, it's not limited to barter or just borders.

Option I: Division of labor within a company. Well, the principle is similar to the division of labor, but they're not the same. Comparative advantage is more about trade based on relative efficiency, while division of labor is about splitting tasks to increase productivity.

Option J: Same continent. No, irrelevant.

So the correct answer is D: No, it applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies.

The principle of comparative advantage is not limited to international trade. It applies in any situation where productive units, such as countries, businesses, or individuals, have different relative efficiencies in producing goods or services. This concept, introduced by David Ricardo, suggests that entities should specialize in what they are relatively better at producing to maximize efficiency and mutual benefit. It is a broader economic principle that extends beyond just international trade.

Answer: D
