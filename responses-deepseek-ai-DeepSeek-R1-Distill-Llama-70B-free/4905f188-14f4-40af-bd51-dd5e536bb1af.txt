Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question has two parts, (a) and (b), and I need to solve both and then match the answers to the given options. Let's start with part (a).

Part (a) says: I want to plate 5 grams of silver from a solution of Ag+. I need to find the number of amperes required over 1000 seconds. So, I guess this involves Faraday's laws of electrolysis.

From what I remember, Faraday's first law states that the amount of substance deposited at an electrode is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte. The formula that comes to mind is m = (M * Q) / (n * F), where:
- m is the mass deposited,
- M is the molar mass,
- Q is the charge (in coulombs),
- n is the valence or number of electrons transferred,
- F is Faraday's constant (about 96485 C/mol e-).

Wait, but Q is also equal to I * t, where I is current in amperes and t is time in seconds. So I can rearrange the formula to solve for I.

Let me plug in the numbers for part (a):
- Mass (m) = 5 grams = 0.005 kg? Wait no, wait, molar mass is in grams per mole. So 5 grams is 5g.
- Silver's molar mass (M) is about 107.87 g/mol. I'll approximate it to 108 g/mol for easier calculation.
- Valence (n) for Ag+ is 1, because Ag+ gains one electron to become Ag metal.
- Time (t) is 1000 seconds.
- F is 96485 C/mol.

So, the formula rearranged to solve for I is:
I = (m * n * F) / (M * t)

Plugging in the values:
I = (5g * 1 * 96485 C/mol) / (107.87 g/mol * 1000 s)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 5 * 1 * 96485 = 5 * 96485 = let's see, 96485 *5 is 482,425 C.

Denominator: 107.87 g/mol * 1000 s = 107,870 g·s/mol.

Wait, but wait, the grams in the numerator and denominator should cancel out. Let me write it properly.

I = (5 g * 96485 C/mol) / (107.87 g/mol * 1000 s) * 1 (since n=1)

The grams (g) cancel out, leaving (C·mol) / (mol·s) → C/s, which is amperes.

So I = 482425 / (107.87 * 1000) → let's compute the denominator first: 107.87 *1000 = 107870.

So 482425 / 107870 ≈ Let me compute that. Hmm.

Dividing 482425 by 107870. Let's see:

107870 * 4 = 431480. 482425 - 431480 = 50945 left.

50945 / 107870 ≈ 0.472. So 4.472 amperes approximately.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. Maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

482425 ÷ 107870.

Let me see: 107870 goes into 482425 how many times.

107870 * 4 = 431,480. Subtract that from 482,425 → 50,945.

Now, 50,945 ÷ 107,870 ≈ 0.472. So total is 4.472 amps. So approximately 4.47 amps.

Wait, but wait, the exact value of M for silver is 107.8682 g/mol, so maybe using 107.87 is precise enough. So my calculation is about 4.47 A.

But looking at the options, let's see. For part (a), the options are all combinations of amperes and seconds. So each option has an 'amps and seconds' value.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones have around 4.45 or 4.47 amps for part (a).

Option B: 4.45 amps and 29400 seconds.

Option G: 3.95 amps and 30500 s.

Option I: 4.00 amps and 31000 s.

So part (a)'s answer is approximately 4.47 A, which is closest to option B's 4.45 A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should check my calculations again. Let me compute 482425 ÷ 107870 more accurately.

482425 ÷ 107870:

Let me do this division step by step.

How many times does 107870 go into 482425?

Compute 107870 * 4 = 431,480.

Subtract: 482,425 - 431,480 = 50,945.

Now, how much is 50,945 ÷ 107,870?

Approx 0.472, so total is 4.472 A.

So 4.472 A, which rounds to 4.47 A. So option B is 4.45, which is close but perhaps exactly 4.45.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 5g/(107.87 g/mol) to get moles of Ag.

Moles = 5 / 107.87 ≈ 0.04635 mol.

Each mole of Ag+ requires 1 mole of electrons (since Ag+ + e- → Ag).

So total charge Q = moles * F = 0.04635 mol * 96485 C/mol ≈ 4467.5 C.

Time is 1000 s. So current I = Q / t = 4467.5 / 1000 ≈ 4.4675 A.

So 4.4675 A. So approximately 4.47 A, which is closer to 4.47 than 4.45. But none of the options have 4.47, but option B is 4.45. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding molar mass or F.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact values.

Molar mass of Ag is 107.8682 g/mol.

So moles = 5 / 107.8682 ≈ 0.04635 mol.

F is 96485 C/mol e-.

So Q = 0.04635 * 96485 = Let me compute that.

0.04635 * 96485 ≈ (0.04 *96485) + (0.00635 *96485).

0.04 *96485 = 3859.4.

0.00635 *96485 ≈ let's compute 0.006 *96485 = 578.91, and 0.00035 *96485 ≈ 33.8695. So total ≈ 578.91 +33.8695 ≈ 612.78.

So 3859.4 + 612.78 ≈ 4472.18 C.

I = 4472.18 C / 1000 s = 4.47218 A ≈ 4.472 A.

So 4.47 A. So the closest option is B, which is 4.45 A, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using a rounded value for F, like 96,500 C/mol.

Let me try that. F = 96,500 C/mol.

Then Q = 0.04635 * 96,500 ≈ 0.04635 * 96,500.

Compute 0.04 *96,500 = 3,860.

0.00635 *96,500 ≈ 612.775.

Total ≈ 3,860 + 612.775 = 4,472.775 C.

Then I = 4,472.775 / 1000 ≈ 4.4728 A, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again. Let's look at part (b) as well because the options combine both (a) and (b) answers.

Part (b) asks: With a current of 0.5 A, how much time is required to plate out 10g of gold from an Au^3+ solution?

So again, using m = (M * Q) / (n * F).

But rearranged to solve for time t.

Wait, Q = I * t → t = Q / I.

But Q is from m = (M * Q) / (n * F) → Q = (m * n * F) / M.

So t = (m * n * F) / (M * I).

Plugging in the values:

m = 10g,
M (Au) is about 196.9665 g/mol, approximately 197 g/mol,
n = 3 (because Au^3+ → Au requires 3 electrons),
I = 0.5 A,
F = 96485 C/mol.

So t = (10 * 3 * 96485) / (197 * 0.5).

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 10 *3=30 → 30 *96485 = 2,894,550 C.

Denominator: 197 *0.5 = 98.5.

So t = 2,894,550 / 98.5 → let me compute that.

Divide 2,894,550 by 98.5.

Hmm, 98.5 * 29,400 = ?

Let me compute 98.5 * 29,400.

Well, 100 *29,400 = 2,940,000.

But since it's 98.5, which is 1.5 less than 100, so subtract 1.5 *29,400 = 44,100.

So 2,940,000 - 44,100 = 2,895,900.

Wait, the numerator is 2,894,550, which is less than 2,895,900 by 1,350.

So 29,400 seconds gives 2,895,900 C.

But we have 2,894,550 C needed, which is 1,350 less.

So the time would be 29,400 - (1,350 /98.5) ≈ 29,400 - approx 13.7 seconds → 29,386.3 s.

Wait, that's approximately 29,386 seconds. So about 29,400 seconds.

Looking at the options, part (b) has 29,400 seconds in option B, and 27,000 in F, etc.

So for part (a), option B has 4.45 A and part (b) is 29,400 s.

Wait, but earlier calculation for part (a) was 4.47 A, and option B is 4.45. Is that acceptable? Or perhaps I made a mistake in molar mass or something.

Wait, let me check the molar mass of Ag again. Yeah, it's about 107.87 g/mol, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using F as 96,500 C/mol e- for simplicity.

Let me try that for part (a):

I = (5 *1 *96500) / (107.87 * 1000)

Compute numerator: 5 *96500=482,500 C.

Denominator: 107.87 *1000=107,870.

I=482500 /107870 ≈ 4.473 A. Hmm, same as before.

So 4.47 A. So option B is 4.45 A, which is a bit lower, but maybe due to rounding the molar mass.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses Ag's molar mass as 108 exactly.

So using 108 g/mol:

I = (5 *1 *96485) / (108 *1000) → 5*96485=482,425.

Denominator: 108*1000=108,000.

482425 /108000 ≈ Let's compute:

108000 *4=432,000.

482,425 -432,000=50,425.

50,425 /108,000 ≈ 0.4676.

So total I=4.4676 A ≈4.467 A.

So 4.467 A, which is about 4.47 A, but option B is 4.45 A. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should check the calculation for part (b) more accurately.

In part (b), using the exact values:

t = (10g *3 *96485 C/mol) / (196.9665 g/mol *0.5 A).

Compute numerator: 10 *3=30 → 30 *96485=2,894,550 C.

Denominator: 196.9665 *0.5 =98.48325.

So t = 2,894,550 /98.48325 ≈ let's compute.

Calculate 2,894,550 ÷ 98.48325.

Hmm, let's see:

98.48325 * 29400 = ?

Compute 98 *29400 = 2,892,200.

0.48325 *29400 ≈ let's compute 0.4 *29400=11,760; 0.08 *29400=2,352; 0.00325 *29400≈95.55.

So 11,760 +2,352=14,112 +95.55=14,207.55.

So total 2,892,200 +14,207.55=2,906,407.55 C.

But the numerator is 2,894,550 C, which is less than 2,906,407.55.

So 29,400 seconds would give a bit more charge than needed. So the exact time would be a bit less than 29,400 s.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 2,894,550 ÷98.48325.

Let me try 29,400 s: 98.48325 *29,400 = ?

Compute 98.48325 *29,400:

= (100 -1.51675) *29,400 = 100*29,400 -1.51675 *29,400.

100*29,400=2,940,000.

1.51675 *29,400: Let's compute 1 *29,400=29,400.

0.5 *29,400=14,700.

0.01675 *29,400= approx 0.01 *29,400=294; 0.00675 *29,400≈198.675 → total 294 +198.675=492.675.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute 1.51675 *29,400:

=1 *29,400 + 0.5 *29,400 + 0.01675 *29,400.

1 *29,400=29,400.

0.5 *29,400=14,700.

0.01675 *29,400= let's compute 0.01 *29,400=294.

0.00675 *29,400= 0.006 *29,400=176.4; 0.00075 *29,400=22.05. So 176.4 +22.05=198.45.

So 0.01675 *29,400=294 +198.45=492.45.

So total 29,400 +14,700 +492.45 = 44,592.45.

So 100 *29,400=2,940,000.

Subtracting 44,592.45 gives 2,940,000 -44,592.45=2,895,407.55 C.

But the charge needed is 2,894,550 C, which is 2,895,407.55 -2,894,550=857.55 C less.

So how much time less would that be? Since current is 0.5 A, 857.55 C /0.5 A = 1,715.1 seconds less. So time would be 29,400 -1,715.1 ≈ 27,684.9 seconds.

Wait, that can't be right because that's a significant difference. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me compute the exact division.

t = 2,894,550 /98.48325 ≈ Let me compute this.

Divide 2,894,550 by 98.48325.

Let me see: 98.48325 * 29,400 = 2,895,407.55 C, as before.

But we have 2,894,550 C needed, which is 857.55 C less.

So the time would be 29,400 s - (857.55 C /0.5 A) = 29,400 - 1,715.1 s = 27,684.9 s.

Wait, that's a big difference. But this doesn't match any of the options for part (b) which are in the tens of thousands. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the denominator is 98.48325, so when I compute t = 2,894,550 /98.48325:

Let me try a different approach. Let me compute 2,894,550 ÷ 98.48325.

Approximating:

98.48325 is approximately 98.483.

Let me compute 2,894,550 ÷98.483.

Let me try 29,400 → 98.483 *29,400 = ?

Well, 100 *29,400=2,940,000 → 98.483 is 1.517 less than 100 per unit.

So 98.483 *29,400 = 2,940,000 - (1.517 *29,400) → 1.517 *29,400.

Compute 1 *29,400=29,400.

0.5 *29,400=14,700.

0.017 *29,400=500. (Wait, 0.017 *294=4.998, so 0.017 *29,400=4,998.)

Wait, 0.017 *29,400 = 29,400 *0.017 = 29,400 *17/1000 = (29,400 /1000)*17 =29.4 *17=500. (Actually, 29*17=493, 0.4*17=6.8 → 499.8, so approximately 500.)

So 1.517 *29,400 = 29,400 +14,700 +500=44,600.

So
