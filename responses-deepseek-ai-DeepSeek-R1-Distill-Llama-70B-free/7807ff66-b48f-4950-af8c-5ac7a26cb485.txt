Options:

A: there are only moral rights; there is no utility.
B: all of the above
C: there are no moral rights; there is only utility.
D: a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will diminish overall welfare.

F: a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will not diminish overall welfare.
G: a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will lead to the maximization of individual welfare.
H: a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will lead to the minimization of overall welfare.
I: a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will have no impact on overall welfare.
J: a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will contribute to the maximization of overall welfare.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this utilitarian question about rights. Let's see. The question says that a utilitarian who recognizes rights will explain rights based on utility. I remember that utilitarianism is all about maximizing overall happiness or welfare. So, rights, in this context, must be justified by how they contribute to that goal.

Wait, the options are a bit confusing. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: "there are only moral rights; there is no utility." That doesn't make sense because the question is about a utilitarian who recognizes rights, so they must connect rights to utility. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: "all of the above." Hmm, I don't think so because not all options make sense. For example, some options say rights diminish welfare, which a utilitarian wouldn't support.

Option C: "there are no moral rights; there is only utility." No, the question states the utilitarian does recognize rights, so C is out.

Option D: Rights are justified because recognizing them diminishes overall welfare. That seems opposite of what a utilitarian would say. Utilitarians want to maximize welfare, not diminish it. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Recognition doesn't contribute to maximizing welfare. That doesn't fit because utilitarians would only support rights that do contribute. So E is unlikely.

Option F: Recognition doesn't diminish welfare. Hmm, that's a bit vague. I guess if it doesn't hurt overall welfare, maybe it's acceptable, but I think the stronger argument would be that it actually helps maximize welfare.

Option G: Recognition leads to maximizing individual welfare. Wait, but utilitarianism is about the overall, not just individual. So maybe G is correct, but I'm not sure.

Option H: Recognition minimizes overall welfare. Definitely not, since that's the opposite of utility.

Option I: No impact on welfare. That doesn't make sense for a right being recognized; rights should have some effect. So probably not I.

Option J: Recognition contributes to maximizing overall welfare. This sounds right because utilitarians base their decisions on what's best for the greatest number. So rights would be justified if they help achieve that.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about how a utilitarian explains rights. I remember that some utilitarians might say that rights are justified because they serve the overall good. So when a right is recognized, it's because it leads to the maximum overall utility.

So looking back, J says that a moral right is justified because its recognition contributes to maximizing overall welfare. That fits perfectly with utilitarian principles. Whereas G talks about individual welfare, which is more of a individualistic approach, perhaps more in line with deontological ethics.

So I think the correct answer is J.

The question asks how a utilitarian who recognizes rights would explain them on the basis of utility. Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall welfare, so rights must be justified by their contribution to this goal. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, E, H, I**: These options either contradict utilitarian principles (e.g., diminishing welfare, no impact on welfare) or reject the recognition of rights, which the question assumes.  
- **B**: "All of the above" is incorrect because not all options align with utilitarian logic.  
- **G**: While it mentions maximizing welfare, it refers to individual welfare, which is less relevant to utilitarianism's focus on overall welfare.  
- **J**: This option correctly states that a moral right is justified if its recognition contributes to maximizing overall welfare, aligning perfectly with utilitarian principles.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**.
