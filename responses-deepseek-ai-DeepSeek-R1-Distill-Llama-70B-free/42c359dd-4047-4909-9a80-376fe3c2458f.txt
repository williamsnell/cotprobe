Okay, so I've got this question about a shunt motor's armature. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question has three parts: a, b, and c. Let me take them one by one.

First, part (a): calculate the resistance needed in series with the armature at start-up so that the current doesn't exceed 76 amps. Oh right, when starting a motor, the armature resistance is low, so a high current would flow. To limit this, we add a resistor in series.

The armature's resistance is 0.18 ohms. The supply voltage is 230 volts, but wait, the question mentions a 2-volt drop at the brushes. So the actual voltage across the armature (E) would be 230V minus 2V, which is 228 volts.

Wait, no, wait. Or is the 2-volt drop part of the armature resistance? Or is E the counter-electromotive force (EMF) that develops as the motor runs? Oh, right, at starting, the motor isn't moving, so the back EMF (E_c) is zero. So the initial armature current is determined by the applied voltage minus the brush drop, divided by the total resistance.

So at start, the armature voltage is 230V - 2V = 228V. Because the brush contact causes a 2V drop. So the current is E / (R_armature + R_external).

We want this current to not exceed 76A. So:

I = (V - V_brush) / (R_arm + R_ext)

So 76 = 228 / (0.18 + R_ext)

Wait, wait. Let me write that correctly. 228 = 76*(0.18 + R_ext)

So 76*(0.18 + R_ext) = 228.

Divide 228 by 76. Let's calculate that: 228 ÷76 is 3. So 3 = 0.18 + R_ext.

So R_ext = 3 - 0.18 = 2.82 ohms. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let's recheck the calculation.

228 = 76*(0.18 + R_ext)

Divide both sides by 76:

228 /76 = 3. So 3 = 0.18 + R_ext → R_ext = 2.82 ohms. Right, that's part (a)'s answer.

Looking at the options, option H has (a) 2.82 ohms. So part (a) is 2.82 ohms.

Now part (b): the value to which this resistance can be reduced when the armature accelerates until E_c is 168 volts.

E_c is the back EMF, right? So when the motor is running, the armature voltage is E_c plus the voltage drop in the armature resistance.

So E_c = V - I_armature * R_arm - V_brush.

Wait, no. Wait, E_c is the induced EMF in the armature. So the applied voltage across the armature is E_c + I_arm * R_arm + brush drop.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the armature equation: V = E_c + I_arm * R_arm + V_brush.

Wait, no, the correct equation is V = E_c + I_arm * R_arm + brush drop. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the motor's armature is connected across the supply voltage. The supply voltage is 230V. But when the motor is running, the armature's induced EMF (E_c) opposes the supply. So the armature current I is given by:

I = (V - E_c - V_brush) / R_arm.

Wait, or is it I = (V - V_brush - E_c) / (R_arm + R_ext)?

Wait, no. Wait, when the motor is running, the armature has a resistance R_arm and an external resistance R_ext in series. So the total resistance is R_arm + R_ext.

The voltage available to drive current is (V - V_brush) minus E_c. Because E_c is opposing the applied voltage.

So the equation would be I = (V - V_brush - E_c) / (R_arm + R_ext).

So in part (b), E_c is 168 volts. So we have:

I = (230 - 2 - 168) / (0.18 + R_ext)

But wait, the current in this case, what's the condition? Oh, because the resistance is being reduced, the current can increase but it's allowed to. Or perhaps the resistance is being adjusted to maintain the same current as before?

Wait, no, the question says "the resistance can be reduced when the armature accelerates until E_c is 168 volts."

Wait, I think the idea is that when the motor speeds up, the back EMF increases, so the current decreases. But in this case, perhaps the current is still at 76A? Or is it whatever current that would flow with the reduced resistance.

Wait, no, I think the scenario here is that the motor is started with the resistance found in part (a), which limits the current to 76A. As the motor speeds up, the back EMF increases, so the current would decrease even with the same resistance. But to allow the motor to draw more current if needed (or perhaps to adjust the current?), the external resistance can be reduced.

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.

"(b) the value to which this resistance can be reduced when the armature accelerates until E_c is 168 volts."

So, I think that when the motor reaches a certain speed where E_c is 168 volts, the resistance can be reduced to a lower value without exceeding the maximum current of 76A. So the current should not exceed 76A in this condition.

So, the current equation is:

I = (V - V_brush - E_c) / (R_arm + R_ext)

We want I ≤76A.

So plug in E_c=168V:

76 = (230 - 2 -168) / (0.18 + R_ext)

Calculate numerator: 230-2=228; 228-168=60.

So 76 = 60 / (0.18 + R_ext)

Multiply denominator:

0.18 + R_ext = 60 /76 → 60 ÷76 ≈ 0.7895 ohms.

So R_ext = 0.7895 -0.18 = 0.6095 ≈ 0.61 ohms.

Looking at the options, option H has (b) 0.61 ohms.

So that's correct.

Now part (c): the armature current at the instant of starting if no resistance is inserted in the armature circuit.

So R_ext =0. So the current is (V - V_brush)/(R_arm + R_ext) → (230-2)/(0.18) → 228/0.18.

Calculate that: 228 divided by 0.18.

Well, 0.18 times 1000 is 180. 228 is 228/0.18 → let's see: 0.18 * 1266.666... → 228. So 1266.666... A? That's about 1,266.67 A. Looking at the options, option H has (c) 1,265 amp. Close enough, considering rounding.

So all three parts point to option H.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

### Part (a)
The resistance required to limit the armature current to 76 A at startup is calculated using the equation:

\[
I = \frac{V - V_{\text{brush}}}{R_{\text{arm}} + R_{\text{ext}}}
\]

Where:
- \( V = 230 \, \text{V} \) (supply voltage),
- \( V_{\text{brush}} = 2 \, \text{V} \) (brush drop),
- \( R_{\text{arm}} = 0.18 \, \Omega \) (armature resistance),
- \( I = 76 \, \text{A} \) (maximum current).

Rearranging for \( R_{\text{ext}} \):

\[
R_{\text{ext}} = \frac{V - V_{\text{brush}}}{I} - R_{\text{arm}}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
R_{\text{ext}} = \frac{230 - 2}{76} - 0.18 = \frac{228}{76} - 0.18 = 3 - 0.18 = 2.82 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the external resistance required is \( 2.82 \, \Omega \).

### Part (b)
When the motor accelerates and the back EMF (\( E_c \)) reaches 168 V, the resistance can be reduced. The current is still limited to 76 A, and the equation becomes:

\[
I = \frac{V - V_{\text{brush}} - E_c}{R_{\text{arm}} + R_{\text{ext}}}
\]

Rearranging for \( R_{\text{ext}} \):

\[
R_{\text{ext}} = \frac{V - V_{\text{brush}} - E_c}{I} - R_{\text{arm}}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
R_{\text{ext}} = \frac{230 - 2 - 168}{76} - 0.18 = \frac{60}{76} - 0.18 \approx 0.7895 - 0.18 = 0.61 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the reduced resistance is \( 0.61 \, \Omega \).

### Part (c)
If no resistance is inserted in the armature circuit, the current at startup is:

\[
I = \frac{V - V_{\text{brush}}}{R_{\text{arm}}}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
I = \frac{230 - 2}{0.18} = \frac{228}{0.18} \approx 1266.67 \, \text{A}
\]

This rounds to approximately \( 1,265 \, \text{A} \).

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- (a) \( 2.82 \, \Omega \),
- (b) \( 0.61 \, \Omega \),
- (c) \( 1,265 \, \text{A} \),

the correct option is **H**.
