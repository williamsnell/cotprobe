Question:

A customer at a fish market was leaving the store after purchasing an assortment of shrimp, oysters, and scallops. He was walking along the sidewalk in front of the store when he slipped on a piece of eel. He brought suit against the owner of the market claiming that he suffered leg and back injuries. The owner, although admitting that the customer was injured by slipping on the eel, denied negligence and claimed that the customer was contributorily negligent. At trial, the owner calls a witness to testify that before the fall he heard someone call out to the customer, "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish. "The witness's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, as it is a statement that was made in the heat of the moment.
B: inadmissible, because the customer did not acknowledge hearing the warning.
C: inadmissible, because it was not a spontaneous utterance.
D: inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.
E: admissible, because it is relevant as to the customer's contributory negligence.
F: admissible, because it provides context to the event.
G: inadmissible, because the witness was not directly involved in the incident.
H: admissible, because it indicates that the owner had no control over the situation.
I: admissible, as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind.
J: inadmissible, as it is considered second-hand information.

Alright, so I'm trying to tackle this evidence question about hearsay exceptions. Let me go through it step by step.

Okay, the scenario is a customer who slipped on an eel at a fish market. He's suing the owner, who claims the customer was contributorily negligent. At trial, the owner calls a witness who testifies that before the fall, someone yelled a warning to the customer: "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish." The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

First, I need to figure out if the statement is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the witness is testifying about someone else's statement to warn the customer. The purpose is probably to show that the customer was warned and thus was contributorily negligent. So, it's being offered for the truthâ€”that someone warned him, implying he should have been careful.

If it's hearsay, I need to check if it falls under any exception. Common exceptions include excited utterances (spontaneous), present sense impressions, statements against interest, etc.

The statement was made right before the fall, so maybe it's a spontaneous utterance. But wait, who made the statement? The witness heard someone else say it. The declarant (the person who made the statement) isn't the witness, and their identity isn't clear. So, for the excited utterance exception under FRE 803(2), the statement must be made under the stress of a startling event. Here, the eel on the ground could be the event, and the warning was in response. But unless we know the declarant was under stress, it's hard to say. Also, the witness is just recounting what they heard, so it's second-hand.

Another angle: is the statement admissible for a non-hearsay purpose? Like to show that the customer had a warning, which would make him negligent. But wait, the statement's content is that someone warned him, so it's about the fact that a warning was given. That's still hearsay because it's asserting that a warning occurred, which is being used to prove the customer was negligent.

Wait, but if the statement is offered not for the truth (that there was a fish), but just that the warning was given, maybe that's non-hearsay. For example, to show that the customer had a chance to hear it, regardless of whether there was actually a fish. But in this case, the eel was the cause, so the warning's content is important. So, it's probably hearsay.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Admissible as a statement made in the heat of the moment. That would be the excited utterance exception. But we don't know if the declarant was under stress. Also, the witness is not the declarant, so the exception applies to the declarant's state of mind.

Option B: Inadmissible because the customer didn't acknowledge hearing. I think that goes to the weight, not admissibility. If the customer didn't hear, it's irrelevant, but the statement's admissibility doesn't depend on that.

Option C: Inadmissible because not spontaneous. Maybe, but if it was spontaneous, it might fall under 803(2). But without knowing the declarant's circumstances, it's hard to say.

Option D: Inadmissible as hearsay without exception. If it's hearsay and no exception applies, then yes. But if an exception applies, D is wrong.

Option E: Admissible as relevant to contributory negligence. Even if it's relevant, if it's hearsay, it's inadmissible unless an exception applies. So E's reasoning is about relevance, not hearsay.

Option F: Admissible for context. Context might make it relevant, but again, hearsay issues remain.

Option G: Inadmissible because witness not involved. That's not a hearsay rule issue; it's about the witness's knowledge, but the witness is testifying about what they heard, so that's allowed.

Option H: Admissible because owner had no control. Not sure, seems irrelevant.

Option I: Admissible as present state of mind. The statement was about the present situation, not the declarant's state of mind, so probably not.

Option J: Inadmissible as second-hand. Well, all hearsay is second-hand, but if it's within an exception, it's okay. So J is about it being hearsay, but the point is whether an exception applies.

Back to the main issue: is the statement admissible under an exception? If it's an excited utterance, then yes. But the problem is that the declarant isn't identified, and we don't know their state of mind. So it's risky to assume it's an excited utterance.

Alternatively, is it a present sense impression under 803(1)? That's a statement describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. The warning was made as the customer was about to step, so perhaps. But again, without knowing the declarant's situation, it's unclear.

If no exception applies, then the statement is inadmissible hearsay. So the answer would be D: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

Wait, but the customer's contributory negligence is about whether he acted reasonably. The warning, if given, would be relevant. But the issue is the statement's admissibility as evidence.

Another thought: the statement's purpose is to prove the customer was negligent because he was warned. If the statement is hearsay and no exception applies, it's inadmissible. So the owner can't use it to prove the customer was negligent because the statement isn't coming in.

So looking at the options, D says it's inadmissible as hearsay with no exception. That seems correct unless an exception applies.

Wait, could it be non-hearsay if it's offered to show that a warning was given, not for the truth of the matter asserted about the fish? No, because the warning's content is about the fish, so it's for the truth that there was a fish to step on. Therefore, it's hearsay.

So the answer should be D.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's testimony regarding a warning statement made to the customer before he slipped on the eel. The key issue is whether the statement constitutes hearsay and, if so, whether it falls under any exception to the hearsay rule.

Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the witness is testifying about someone else's warning to the customer, which is being offered to prove that the customer was contributorily negligent. This makes the statement hearsay. The next step is to determine if it falls under any hearsay exception.

Potential exceptions considered include the excited utterance exception (FRE 803(2)) and the present sense impression exception (FRE 803(1)). However, the declarant's identity and state of mind are unclear, making it difficult to confirm whether the statement was spontaneous or made while perceiving the event. Without sufficient evidence that the statement meets the criteria for an exception, it remains inadmissible as hearsay.

Other options, such as relevance to contributory negligence or providing context, do not address the hearsay issue. The admissibility of the statement depends on whether it qualifies under a hearsay exception, which it does not in this case.

Thus, the correct answer is that the testimony is inadmissible because it is hearsay not within any exception.
