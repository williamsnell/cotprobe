Okay, so Paul wants to calculate the exact interest he'd pay on a loan. Let me see, the details are a loan of $720 with a 5% annual interest rate, taken from April 25 to June 15. Hmm, I need to find the exact amount of interest he'd have to pay.

First, I think I should figure out how many days the loan is for. Because the interest is probably calculated based on the time period. So from April 25 to June 15. Let me count the days.

April has 30 days, right? So starting on April 25th, that leaves 6 days in April (since 25th is the start, so 25,26,27,28,29,30 — that's 6 days including the 25th? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the loan starts on April 25, does that day count as day 0 or day 1? Hmm, I think when you take a loan, the day you get the money is day 0, and the next day starts counting. But sometimes it's counted as day 1. I'm a bit confused here, but maybe it's better to add the days correctly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total days between April 25 and June 15. Let me break it down.

April: From April 25 to April 30. So that's 30 - 25 = 5 days? Wait, no, wait. Let me count: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. That's 6 days in April.

Then May has 31 days, so all of May is included.

Then from June 1 to June 15: that's 15 days.

Wait no, wait. Because the loan is from April 25 to June 15. So it's April 25 (inclusive) to June 15 (inclusive?), or exclusive? Hmm, the wording says "from April 25 to June 15," which I think includes both days. So I need to calculate the number of days between them, including both start and end dates.

Wait, no, in interest calculations, typically the end date is not counted. Because the loan is being paid on June 15, so the interest stops on June 14. Or maybe it's up to June 15, but the exact method can vary. Hmm, but maybe for the sake of this problem, we can calculate the days as the number of days between those dates, inclusive or not?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add the days step by step.

April has 30 days. So from April 25 to April 30: that's 30 - 25 = 5 days, but wait, 25th is day 1, so 30-25=5, but including 25th, that's 6 days.

Wait, no, wait: if you have from day 1 to day 6, that's 6 days. So April 25 is day 1, and April 30 is day 6. So that's 6 days in April.

Then May has 31 days.

Then June 1 to June 15: that's 15 days.

Wait, but wait: the loan is from April 25 to June 15. So does that include June 15? Let me think again. If you borrow on April 25 and repay on June 15, the period is April 25 (inclusive) to June 15 (inclusive) or not? Because in some cases, the day you repay is not counted as a day you're using the money. So perhaps the period is April 25 to June 14, which would be the day before repayment.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to count the days as April 25 to June 15, exclusive of June 15. Let me check that.

Wait, perhaps instead of getting stuck, I can calculate the exact days using an online calculator or formula. But since I can't do that now, maybe I can compute it manually.

Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of months. From April 25 to May 25 is one month, and then from May 25 to June 15 is 15 plus 25 minus 25? Wait, no. Let me think: April 25 to May 25 is 31 days (since May has 31 days). Wait, no, April has 30 days, so from April 25 to April 30 is 6 days, then May has 31 days, so up to May 25 is 31 days. Wait, no, no, wait: from April 25 to May 25 is exactly one month. Because April 25 to May 25 is 30 days (April 25 to April 30 is 6 days, then May 1-25 is 25 days: 6+25=31? Wait, no, that's 31 days. So that's one month and one day? Hmm, perhaps this isn't the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of days in each month.

April: 30 days. From April 25 to April 30 is 6 days (25,26,27,28,29,30).

May: 31 days.

June: 15 days (up to June 15).

Wait, but wait: the loan is from April 25 to June 15. So that's April (6 days) + May (31 days) + 15 days in June.

Wait, that would be 6 +31 +15=52 days. But wait, does that include both April 25 and June 15?

Alternatively, maybe it's 6 days in April, 31 in May, and 15 in June, totaling 52 days. But wait, if you include April 25 as day 1, then the total days would be 52.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should compute the exact days between April 25 and June 15 inclusive.

Another approach: April has 30 days. So from April 25 to April 30 is 6 days (since 30-25+1=6). Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 to June 15 is 15 days. So total is 6+31+15=52 days.

Wait, but does that include June 15? Because the loan is taken until June 15. So I think the period is April 25 (day 1) through June 15 (day 52), making it 52 days.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check. For example, the number of days from April 25 to April 30 is 6 days (inclusive). Then May is 31 days, and June 1 to June 15 is 15 days. So total is 6+31=37 (April and May) +15=52 days in June. So 52 days in total.

Wait, but wait, when you take a loan from April 25 to June 15, the period is 52 days? Because April 25 is day 1, and June 15 is day 52. So the time period is 52 days.

But wait, sometimes in interest calculations, the end date is not counted. So perhaps the period is 51 days. Because from April 25 to June 14 is 51 days, and June 15 is the day you pay back, so not counted.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation and see if the options match. Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to calculate using the exact days, perhaps using the formula for simple interest.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where P is principal, r is the daily interest rate, and t is time in days.

Wait, the interest rate is 5% per annum. So I need to find the daily rate.

So 5% per year is 0.05 in decimal. To get the daily rate, divide by 365 days.

So daily rate is 0.05 / 365 ≈ 0.000136986 per day.

Then, I = 720 * (0.05/365) * t, where t is the number of days.

So first, I need to find t correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate using the number of months. But since the period isn't exact months, days would be more precise.

Wait, another approach: calculate the exact days between April 25 and June 15.

April 25 to April 30: 6 days.

May: 31 days.

June 1-15: 15 days.

Total: 6+31+15=52 days.

So t=52 days.

Then interest I = 720 * 0.05 * (52/365).

Let me calculate that.

First, 0.05 * 52 = 2.6.

Then, 720 * 2.6 = 1872.

Then, 1872 / 365 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1872 ÷ 365.

365 × 5 = 1825.

1872 - 1825=47.

So 5 + 47/365 ≈ 5.12878.

So approximately $5.13.

Wait, but looking at the options, there's an option E: $5.03, and D: $3.03, and others. Hmm, none of the options exactly match $5.13, but perhaps I made a mistake in the days calculation.

Wait, maybe I counted the days incorrectly. Let me recount the days, perhaps I included one day too many.

If the loan period is from April 25 to June 15, inclusive, that's 52 days.

But perhaps in reality, when you take a loan, the day you receive the money is counted as day 0, and the next day as day 1, so the period would be 51 days. Let me recalculate with t=51 days.

So I = 720 * 0.05 * (51/365).

0.05 *51 = 2.55.

720 *2.55 = 1836.

1836 /365 ≈ 5.027 approximately.

So that's about $5.03, which is option E: $5.03.

Wait, that's one of the options. So perhaps the correct number of days is 51, not 52.

But why the discrepancy? Because the interest is calculated up to but not including the day of repayment. So if you take the loan on April 25 and repay on June 15, the period is April 25 (day 0) to June 14 (day 51), making it 51 days.

So in that case, the interest would be approximately $5.03, which is option E.

Looking at the options, option E is $5.03.

But wait, let me double-check the days count. From April 25 to June 15.

Another way to calculate the days is to consider that April has 30 days. So from April 25 to April 30 is 6 days (including 25th). Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 to June 15 is 15 days. So 6+31+15=52 days.

But if the repayment is made on June 15, then the last day is June 14, making it 51 days.

Wait, that's the confusion. If you include June 15 as a day of the loan, then it's 52 days. But if you exclude it, it's 51.

I think in banking, when calculating interest, the day of repayment is not counted. So for example, if you borrow on day 1 and repay on day 52, the interest is for 51 days.

So in this case, t=51 days.

So then, the interest is 720 * 0.05 * (51/365) ≈ 5.03.

So option E is $5.03.

Looking at the options, E is $5.03, which seems to be the correct answer.

To calculate the exact interest Paul would pay on a loan of $720 with an annual interest rate of 5% from April 25 to June 15, we first determine the number of days in the loan period. 

1. **Counting the days**:
   - From April 25 to April 30: 6 days (inclusive of April 25).
   - May: 31 days.
   - June 1 to June 15: 15 days.
   - Total: \( 6 + 31 + 15 = 52 \) days.

   However, in financial calculations, the day of repayment (June 15) is typically not included. Thus, the loan period is 51 days.

2. **Simple interest formula**:
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   I = P \cdot r \cdot t
   \]
   Where:
   - \( P = 720 \) (principal amount),
   - \( r = 0.05 \) (annual interest rate),
   - \( t = \frac{51}{365} \) (time in years).

3. **Calculating the interest**:
   \[
   I = 720 \cdot 0.05 \cdot \frac{51}{365}
   \]
   - First, calculate \( 0.05 \cdot 51 = 2.55 \).
   - Then, \( 720 \cdot 2.55 = 1836 \).
   - Finally, \( \frac{1836}{365} \approx 5.03 \).

Thus, the exact interest Paul would pay is approximately **$5.03**.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: $5.03**
