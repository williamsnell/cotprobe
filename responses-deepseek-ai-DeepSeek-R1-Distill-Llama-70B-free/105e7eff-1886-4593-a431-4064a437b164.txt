Okay, so I have this question about a car accident and some psychological theories. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says that a man stops his car and starts helping people after a major accident. Then, others see him stop and also start helping. I need to figure out which theory best explains why the others joined in.

First, I should recall what each of these theories means because I'm a bit rusty on some of them.

Option A: Self-fulfilling Prophecy. That's when someone's expectation of an event makes it more likely to happen. Like if a teacher thinks a student will do well, the student does. Not sure how that fits here.

Option B: Social Identity. This is about people deriving part of their identity from group memberships. It's more about group behavior and how being in a group affects self-concept. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Cognitive Dissonance. This happens when there's a conflict between a person's beliefs and their actions, causing discomfort. They adjust one to reduce the discomfort. Doesn't seem directly relevant here.

Option D: Convergence. I think this is about people from different backgrounds coming together, like in a crowd. Maybe it's about collective behavior but I'm not sure.

Option E: Emergent-norm. I remember this has to do with new norms emerging in a situation, especially in crowds or emergencies. When people are together, they create new norms on the spot. That sounds possible because the man's action sets a new norm for others.

Option F: Deindividuation. This is when individuals lose their sense of self and responsibility in a group, leading to different behavior. Maybe related, but in this case, people are following an example, not losing their identity.

Option G: Value-added. Not too familiar, but I think it's more about how groups make decisions and the added value from group interactions. Not sure it fits here.

Option H: Social Facilitation. This is when being in a group enhances performance, especially in simple tasks. Like how cyclists go faster in a group. But here, it's about helping, not performance.

Option I: Bystander Effect. This is when individuals are less likely to help when others are present because responsibility is diffused. But in this scenario, others start helping after seeing one person. So it's the oppositeâ€”maybe the bystander effect is being overcome.

Option J: Contagion. This refers to the spread of behaviors or emotions through a crowd, like a wave or a panic. If one person starts doing something, others copy it because of the contagious effect.

So, putting it all together: the man starts helping, others see him and do the same. So it's about others imitating his behavior. Which theory explains that?

Emergent-norm theory (E) suggests that in a situation, a new norm emerges. The first man's action sets a norm that helping is the thing to do. So others follow, thinking it's the appropriate behavior now.

Alternatively, Contagion (J) is about behaviors spreading quickly, almost automatically. Like if someone starts clapping, others do too. It's more about the automatic spread rather than the establishment of a new norm.

In the scenario, the first person's action likely creates a new social norm that others follow. So Emergent-norm theory would explain that others are conforming to this new norm in the situation.

Wait, but what's the difference between E and J? Contagion is more about the immediate spread without much thinking, while emergent-norm is about a new understanding of what's appropriate behavior.

In the case here, others see someone helping and decide to help too. It's more of a norm being established, so E might be the answer.

Alternatively, another angle: the bystander effect (I) is when people don't help because others are present. But here, the opposite is happening. So the presence of someone helping encourages others, which could be overcoming the bystander effect. But the question is about why others started helping, not why they overcame the effect.

So the best fit is either E or J. Another thought: when someone starts an action, others follow because they see it as the right thing to do in that moment. That's more like an emergent norm.

So I think the answer is E: Emergent-norm.

The scenario describes a situation where a man stops to help after a car accident, and others follow his example. To determine the best explanation, we analyze the options:

- **A: Self-fulfilling Prophecy**: Involves expectations shaping outcomes, which doesn't fit here.
- **B: Social Identity**: Relates to group identity influencing behavior, but not directly relevant.
- **C: Cognitive Dissonance**: Involves conflict between beliefs and actions, which isn't applicable.
- **D: Convergence**: Refers to diverse individuals coming together, not the specific behavior spread.
- **E: Emergent-norm**: Explains how new norms emerge in situations, making certain behaviors seem appropriate. This fits as the man's action sets a norm for others.
- **F: Deindividuation**: Involves losing self-awareness in a group, not relevant here.
- **G: Value-added**: Pertains to group decision-making, not applicable.
- **H: Social Facilitation**: Enhances performance in groups, not about helping behavior.
- **I: Bystander Effect**: Explains why people don't help in groups, but here the opposite happens.
- **J: Contagion**: Refers to the automatic spread of behaviors, which is possible but less about norm formation.

The key distinction is that **Emergent-norm Theory** explains how the man's action establishes a new norm, leading others to follow, while **Contagion** is more about automatic behavior spread. The scenario better aligns with the emergence of a new norm, making **E: Emergent-norm** the best answer.
