Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the change in mass when an oxygen nucleus emits a gamma ray. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's think this through step by step.

The reaction given is ^19_8O* (excited state) turning into ^19_8O (ground state) plus a gamma ray. The energy released is 1.06 × 10^8 Kcal per mole. Wait, Kcal? Oh right, kilocalories. But wait, in physics, energy is often in joules, so I might need to convert that.

The question is asking for Δm, the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei, in grams per mole. I remember that mass and energy are related by Einstein's equation E=mc². So the energy change should correspond to a mass change. But wait, since energy is being released, the mass should decrease, right? Because the excited nucleus is higher in energy and mass than the ground state. So the initial mass is higher than the final, so Δm (final - initial) would be negative? Or wait, the problem says "difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei", so final minus initial. If mass decreases, then Δm would be negative.

But wait, the options have both positive and negative choices, so I need to get the sign right.

So the formula I need is Δm = ΔE / c². But wait, I have to consider per mole here. Oh right, because the given energy is per mole. So I need to calculate the mass change per mole.

But wait, the energy given is in Kcal per mole. Let me think about the conversions. 1 Kcal is 1000 calories, and 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So 1 Kcal = 4184 J. Therefore, 1.06e8 Kcal/mol = 1.06e8 * 4184 J/mol.

Wait, let me compute that. 1.06e8 Kcal/mol * (4184 J/Kcal) = 1.06e8 * 4.184e3 J/mol. Let's see:

1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = 1.06 *4.184e11 = Let me compute 1.06 *4.184. 4 *1.06 is 4.24, 0.184 *1.06 is about 0.195, so total around 4.435. So approximately 4.435e11 J/mol.

Wait, more accurately: 1.06 *4.184 = let's calculate:

4.184 * 1 =4.184, 4.184 *0.06=0.251, so total 4.435 J per Kcal. So 1.06e8 Kcal is 1.06e8 *4.435e3 J. So 1.06e8 *4.435e3 = (1.06 *4.435) * 1e11.

1.06 *4.435: Let's compute 4 *1.06 is 4.24, 0.435 *1.06: 0.435*1=0.435, 0.435*0.06=0.0261. So 0.435+0.0261=0.4611. So total 4.24 + 0.4611=4.7011. So ΔE = 4.7011e11 J/mol.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because 1 Kcal is 4184 J, so 1.06e8 Kcal is 1.06e8 *4.184e3 J. Let me compute that correctly.

1.06e8 *4.184e3 = (1.06 *4.184) * 1e11. Wait, 1e8 *1e3 is 1e11, right. So 1.06 *4.184: 1*4.184=4.184, 0.06*4.184=0.251. So 4.435. So 4.435e11 J/mol.

So ΔE = 4.435e11 J/mol.

Now, E=mc², so m= E/(c²).

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s, so c squared is 9e16 m²/s².

So m = (4.435e11 J/mol) / (9e16 m²/s²).

Joules is kg·m²/s², so J/(m²/s²) is kg.

So m = (4.435e11) / (9e16) kg/mol.

Calculate that: 4.435e11 /9e16 = (4.435 /9) * 1e-5.

4.435 /9 is about 0.493. So 0.493e-5 kg/mol.

Convert kg to grams: 1 kg = 1e3 grams, so 0.493e-5 kg = 0.493e-2 grams. So 4.93e-3 grams per mole.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 4.435e11 /9e16:

4.435e11 /9e16 = (4.435 /9) * 1e-5 = 0.4928 * 1e-5 = 4.928e-6 kg per mole.

Wait, 4.928e-6 kg is 4.928e-3 grams. So 4.928e-3 grams per mole.

But wait, the energy is released, so the mass of the final state is less than initial. The reaction is ^19_8O* → ^19_8O + γ. So the initial is the excited O, which is more massive, and the final is less massive plus the gamma. But the gamma has energy, but negligible mass because photons have no rest mass. So the mass lost is converted into the energy of the gamma ray.

Wait, but the problem says "the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei." So initial is the excited O*, final is the ground O. So final mass is less than initial. So Δm = mass_final - mass_initial = negative value.

So the calculation gives a Δm of about -4.928e-3 grams per mole.

Wait, but wait, in the calculation above, the mass is positive 4.928e-3 g/mol, but since the final is lighter, the difference (final - initial) would be negative. So Δm is negative.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 6.92e-3

B: -4.92e-3

C:4.92e-3

...

So the correct answer should be approximately -4.92e-3 grams/mole, so option B or option H.

Wait, let me check the calculation again for any mistakes.

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.06e8 Kcal per mole.

Wait, 1 Kcal = 4.184e3 J. So 1.06e8 Kcal = 1.06e8 *4.184e3 J = 4.435e11 J, yes.

Then m = E/c² = (4.435e11 J/mol) / (9e16 m²/s²) = 4.435e11 /9e16 = (4.435/9) *1e-5 kg/mol.

4.435/9 is approximately 0.4928, so 0.4928e-5 kg/mol = 4.928e-6 kg/mol = 4.928e-3 g/mol.

Since the mass of the final is less, Δm = final - initial = negative. So Δm = -4.928e-3 g/mol.

Looking back, option B is -4.92e-3, which is very close to my calculation. So B is the correct answer.

To calculate the difference in mass (Δm) between the final and initial nuclei for the given reaction:

\[
^{19}_8\text{O}^* \rightarrow ^{19}_8\text{O} + \gamma \quad (\Delta E = 1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{Kcal/mol}),
\]

we use Einstein's equation \( E = mc^2 \), which relates energy and mass. The energy released corresponds to a decrease in mass because the excited state (\(^{19}_8\text{O}^*\)) is higher in energy and mass than the ground state (\(^{19}_8\text{O}\)).

### Step 1: Convert energy to joules
The energy is given as \( \Delta E = 1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{Kcal/mol} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{Kcal} = 4184 \, \text{J} \), we convert:

\[
\Delta E = 1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{Kcal/mol} \times 4184 \, \text{J/Kcal} = 4.435 \times 10^{11} \, \text{J/mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass difference
Using \( E = mc^2 \), the mass difference is:

\[
\Delta m = \frac{\Delta E}{c^2},
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, so \( c^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \). Substituting:

\[
\Delta m = \frac{4.435 \times 10^{11} \, \text{J/mol}}{9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 4.928 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{kg/mol}.
\]

Convert to grams:

\[
\Delta m = 4.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the sign of Δm
Since the final state (\(^{19}_8\text{O}\)) is lighter than the initial state (\(^{19}_8\text{O}^*\)), the mass difference is negative:

\[
\Delta m = -4.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The closest option to \( -4.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol} \) is:

**B: -4.92 × 10⁻³ g/mol.**
