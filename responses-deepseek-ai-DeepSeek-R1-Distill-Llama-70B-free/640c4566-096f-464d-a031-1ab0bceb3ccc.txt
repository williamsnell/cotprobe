Question:

On May 10, 1955, a rancher, owner of a 300-acre cattle ranch in Texas, conveyed a 20-acre strip across the property as follows:"To the railroad, its successors and assigns, to have and to hold so long as the same shall be used for railroad purposes. "In 1972, the rancher made the followingconveyance:"To my daughter and her husband and their heirs, as much of the 300-acre cattle ranch as is not described in my deed to the railroad dated May, 10, 1955. "The following year, the rancher, a widower, died intestate, survived by the daughter and a son. In 2000, the railroad decided to discontinue operating its trains over the strip conveyed in 1955. By 2004, the growth of a nearby town had made the 300-acre cattle ranch valuable as a potential site for homes or for an industrial park. However, as of January 1, 2005, the governing body of the county (in which the ranch sits) took appropriate action, in accordance with Texas statutes, to zone the 300-acre cattle ranch as single-family residential property with a minimum lot size of one acre. The ordinance provided that the exclusion of ranching operations and industrial development was necessary to protect the health of county residents by limiting the extent of waste disposal and preventing pollution of air and the nearby river, the county's major water supply. The state's power authority has now taken appropriate action to condemn half of the 300-acre cattle ranch, which will be flooded as a result of construction of a dam for a proposed hydroelectric facility. The 150 acres taken includes the 20-acre strip described in the deed to the railroad. Is the railroad entitled to any compensation from the state's power authority?

Options:

A: Yes, because the railroad's rights to the land remain in effect as long as the land is used for public utility.
B: Yes, because the railroad was not given a fair chance to contest the condemnation of the land.
C: No, because by discontinuing its operation of trains, the railroad's determinable, feeterminated.
D: No, because the condemnation of the land by the state's power authority overrides any previous agreements.
E: Yes, because the holder of an easement benefit is entitled to compensation for the value lost.
F: No, because the holder of an easement is not entitled to compensation when the servient tenement is extinguished by condemnation.
G: No, because the railroad has ceased its operations and therefore forfeited any claims to the land.
H: Yes, because the railroad still holds the right to the land unless it is formally relinquished.
I: Yes, because if all the leased land is condemned for the full balance of the lease term, the lessee is entitled to compensation for the taking of the leasehold estate.
J: No, because the land was zoned for residential use, making the railroad's operations irrelevant.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with conveyances, easements, and condemnation. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves a rancher who conveyed a 20-acre strip to a railroad in 1955 with the condition "so long as the same shall be used for railroad purposes." Then in 1972, the rancher conveys the remainder of his 300-acre ranch to his daughter and her husband, excluding the part given to the railroad. The rancher dies intestate in 1973, leaving a daughter and a son. 

In 2000, the railroad stops using the strip for trains. Then in 2004, the county zones the ranch for single-family residential, and in 2005, the state power authority condemns half the ranch, including the 20-acre strip, for a dam.

The question is whether the railroad is entitled to any compensation from the state's power authority.

First, I need to figure out what kind of estate the railroad has. The conveyance says "to the railroad, its successors and assigns, to have and to hold so long as the same shall be used for railroad purposes." That sounds like a fee simple determinable. Fee simple determinable has a duration that's limited by a specific condition, and it automatically ends when the condition is no longer met. So if the railroad stops using it for railroad purposes, the estate automatically terminates, right?

Wait, but in real property, when a fee simple determinable ends, the property reverts back to the grantor or their heirs. So when the railroad stopped using it in 2000, their interest would have ended, and the land would go back to the rancher or his estate. But the rancher died in 1973, so his estate would have passed to his heirs. Wait, but in 1972, the rancher conveyed the rest of the ranch to his daughter and her husband, except for the part conveyed to the railroad. So when the rancher died intestate, his estate would pass to his children, but the ranch was already conveyed in 1972 except for the railroad strip. So in 2000, when the railroad stops using it, the 20 acres would revert back to the rancher's estate, but since he's dead, who gets it? Probably his heirs, which would be the daughter and the son. But wait, the daughter already got the remaining 280 acres, so maybe she and her brother would get the 20 acres back.

But the key point is, when the railroad stopped using it in 2000, their fee simple determinable ended. So they no longer have any interest in the property. Then, when the state condemns the land in 2005, the railroad doesn't have any rights to it anymore. So when the state takes the 150 acres, including the 20-acre strip, the railroad isn't entitled to compensation because they don't have an interest anymore.

Wait, but what about condemnation and how it affects different estates? Condemnation usually involves eminent domain, where the government takes property and must pay just compensation. If the railroad had an easement, they might be entitled to compensation for the loss of their easement. But in this case, the railroad had a fee simple determinable, which ended when they stopped using it. So when the state took the land, the railroad had already lost their interest, so they wouldn't be entitled to any compensation.

Looking at the options:

Option C says no because by discontinuing operations, the railroad's determinable fee was terminated. That seems to align with what I was thinking. Because once the condition fails, their fee ends, so they don't have any interest left to be compensated for.

Option F says no because the holder of an easement isn't entitled when the servient tenement is condemned. But wait, the railroad didn't have an easement; they had a fee simple determinable. So F might not apply here.

Option G says no because the railroad has ceased operations and forfeited their claim. That's similar to C, but more about forfeiture. I think C is more precise because it's about the determinable fee ending.

Other options, like A, E, I, etc., suggest the railroad is entitled, but if their interest ended in 2000, they wouldn't get compensation in 2005.

So the correct answer should be C or F, but I think C is the right choice because it's about the determinable fee terminating, not about easements.
</think>

The question revolves around the railroad's entitlement to compensation after the state's power authority condemned a portion of land that included a 20-acre strip previously conveyed to the railroad. The key issue is determining the nature of the railroad's interest and whether it survived to entitle them to compensation.

In 1955, the rancher conveyed the 20-acre strip to the railroad "so long as the same shall be used for railroad purposes." This created a **fee simple determinable**, which automatically terminates when the specified condition (use for railroad purposes) is no longer met. When the railroad discontinued operations in 2000, its interest in the land terminated, and the property reverted to the rancher's estate. Since the rancher had already died intestate, the reversion would pass to his heirs (the daughter and son). By 2005, when the state condemned the land, the railroad no longer held any interest in the property.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** correctly states that the railroad's determinable fee was terminated when it ceased railroad operations, meaning it had no interest left to be compensated for.
- **Option F**, while mentioning easements, is less precise because the railroad held a fee simple determinable, not an easement.
- Other options suggesting entitlement to compensation (e.g., A, E, I) are incorrect because the railroad's interest had already terminated before the condemnation.

Thus, the railroad is not entitled to compensation because its interest in the land ended when it stopped using the strip for railroad purposes.

**Answer: C**
