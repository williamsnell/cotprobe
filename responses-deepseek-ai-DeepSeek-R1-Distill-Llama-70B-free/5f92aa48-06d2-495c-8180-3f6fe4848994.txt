Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again. The question is asking for the measure, in degrees, of an angle that's equivalent to 1/360 of a circle. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that a full circle is 360 degrees. So if someone is talking about a fraction of a circle, like 1/360, that must be a very small angle. Because 1 divided by 360 would be a tiny slice of the circle.

Wait, wait. Let me think about this. If the whole circle is 360 degrees, then each degree is 1/360 of the circle. So if you take 1/360 of the circle, that should be 1 degree, right? Because 360 degrees divided by 360 would give 1 degree per each of those parts.

So the angle measure would be 1 degree. Looking at the options, I see option H is 1. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes these questions can be tricky.

Another way to look at it is to calculate (1/360) * 360 degrees. That's straightforward: the 360s cancel out, leaving 1 degree. Yep, that makes sense. So 1/360 of a circle is 1 degree.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be H.

The measure of an angle equivalent to 1/360 of a circle is calculated by multiplying 1/360 by 360 degrees, which equals 1 degree. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H

Answer: H
