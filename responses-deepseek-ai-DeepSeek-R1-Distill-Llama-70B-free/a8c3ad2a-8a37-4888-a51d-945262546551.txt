Question:

Most people use C째(degree Celsius) to measure everyday temperatures. Astronomers prefer to use K (Kelvin) to measure temperatures. Approximately how many Kelvin are 25 C째?

Options:

A: 350 Kelvin
B: 250 Kelvin
C: 200 Kelvin
D: 300 Kelvin
E: 375 Kelvin
F: 275 Kelvin
G: 450 Kelvin
H: 225 Kelvin
I: 400 Kelvin
J: 325 Kelvin

Okay, so I have this question about converting Celsius to Kelvin. Hmm, I remember that the Kelvin scale is used a lot in science, especially by astronomers. But wait, how exactly do you convert from Celsius to Kelvin again?

I think the formula is something like Kelvin equals Celsius plus 273.15. Oh wait, right, because 0 degrees Celsius is equal to 273.15 Kelvin. So that's the starting point. So if it's 25 degrees Celsius, I need to add 273.15 to that.

Let me do the math. 25 plus 273.15. Let's see, 25 plus 273 is 298, and then there's the 0.15, so 298.15 Kelvin. Wait, but the options are all in whole numbers. So I guess I should round it to the nearest whole number. That would be 298, which is approximately 300 Kelvin.

Looking at the options, D is 300 Kelvin. So I think the answer is D.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I remember the formula correctly? Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure it's K = C + 273.15. So 25 plus 273.15 is definitely 298.15, which rounds to 298. But the options don't have 298. The closest is 300, which is option D. So yeah, that's the right choice.

To convert 25째C to Kelvin, use the formula:  
**K = 째C + 273.15**  
25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K, which approximates to 300 K.  

The closest option is **D: 300 Kelvin**.  

Answer: D
