Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about asymptotic notations, and I need to figure out which one is the smallest. Hmm, I remember that asymptotic notations are used to describe the growth rate of functions, especially in the context of algorithms. The question gives me options from A to J, each with a different Big O notation.

Wait, the question is asking for the smallest asymptotically. So, I need to determine which function grows the slowest as n becomes very large. Because the smallest in terms of growth rate would be the one that's the least work for an algorithm as the input size increases.

Let me list out all the options first:

A: O(n²)
B: O(sqrt(n)) → which is same as O(n^(1/2))
C: O(1)
D: O(n^(1/2)) → same as B
E: O(2^n)
F: O(log n)
G: O(n)
H: O(n log n)
I: O(n!) → factorial
J: O(n³)

Wait, some options might be duplicates. Like B and D are both O(sqrt(n)), since sqrt(n) is n^(1/2). So I can treat B and D the same.

Now, I need to order these from smallest to largest growth rate.

I remember that the growth rates from slowest to fastest are something like:

O(1) < O(log n) < O(sqrt(n)) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(2^n) < O(n!) < ... 

Wait, let me think again. Constant time O(1) is the smallest because it doesn't change with n. Then logarithmic O(log n) grows very slowly. Then square root, which is n^0.5. Then linear O(n), which is n^1. Next is n log n, which is a bit faster than linear but slower than quadratic. Then comes quadratic (n²), which is n squared. Then exponential 2^n, which grows much faster. And finally, factorial n! grows faster than exponential because each step multiplies by n.

So putting the options in order:

Smallest -> O(1) (C) → then O(log n) (F) → then O(sqrt(n)) (B and D) → O(n) (G) → O(n log n) (H) → O(n²) (A) → O(2^n) (E) → O(n!) (I) → O(n³) (J). Wait, but J is O(n³), which is larger than O(n²), so it's after A. So the order from smallest to largest is:

C (O(1)) < F (O(log n)) < B/D (O(sqrt(n))) < G (O(n)) < H (O(n log n)) < A (O(n²)) < J (O(n³)) < E (O(2^n)) < I (O(n!)).

Wait no, wait. Let me recheck:

Wait, O(n log n) is like n multiplied by log n, which is larger than O(n). So after O(n) comes O(n log n), then O(n²), then higher powers like n³. So J is O(n³), which is bigger than O(n²). So the order is:

O(1) → O(log n) → O(sqrt(n)) → O(n) → O(n log n) → O(n²) → O(n³) → O(2^n) → O(n!).

Wait, but where does O(n³) stand? Oh right, O(n³) is larger than O(n²) because as n increases, n³ grows faster than n squared. So in the list, A is O(n²), J is O(n³), which comes after A.

So now, looking at the options, the question is to pick the smallest asymptotic. The smallest is O(1), which is option C. Then next is F, O(log n). After that, B and D, O(sqrt(n)), then G, etc.

So the answer should be C: O(1), which is the smallest.

The question asks for the smallest asymptotic growth rate among the given options. Asymptotic notations describe how functions grow as the input size \( n \) increases. The smallest growth rate corresponds to the function that grows the slowest.

The options are:

- **A: \( O(n^2) \)**
- **B: \( O(\sqrt{n}) \)**
- **C: \( O(1) \)**
- **D: \( O(n^{1/2}) \)**
- **E: \( O(2^n) \)**
- **F: \( O(\log n) \)**
- **G: \( O(n) \)**
- **H: \( O(n \log n) \)**
- **I: \( O(n!) \)**
- **J: \( O(n^3) \)**

To determine the smallest, we order the growth rates from slowest to fastest:

1. **\( O(1) \)**: Constant time, the slowest growth rate.
2. **\( O(\log n) \)**: Logarithmic growth, slightly faster than constant time.
3. **\( O(\sqrt{n}) \)**: Square root growth, faster than logarithmic.
4. **\( O(n) \)**: Linear growth, faster than square root.
5. **\( O(n \log n) \)**: Linearithmic growth, faster than linear.
6. **\( O(n^2) \)**: Quadratic growth, faster than linearithmic.
7. **\( O(n^3) \)**: Cubic growth, faster than quadratic.
8. **\( O(2^n) \)**: Exponential growth, much faster than polynomial growth.
9. **\( O(n!) \)**: Factorial growth, the fastest among the options.

From this ordering, the smallest asymptotic growth rate is **\( O(1) \)**, which corresponds to option **C**.
