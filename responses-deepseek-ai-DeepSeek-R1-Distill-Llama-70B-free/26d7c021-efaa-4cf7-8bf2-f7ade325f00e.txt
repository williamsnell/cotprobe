Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry has always been a bit tricky for me. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding out how many grams of carbon dioxide are produced when 84 grams of ethane reacts with excess oxygen. 

First, I need to understand the reaction. The given equation is C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. Wait, wait, ethane is C2H6, right? Because ethane has two carbons and six hydrogens. Oh, but wait, the formula in the problem is C2H4. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo or maybe I'm remembering wrong. No, no, wait. Oh wait, no, ethane is C2H6. So maybe the reaction in the problem has a typo? Because ethane is C2H6. Hmm, but the problem says the reaction is C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. So perhaps that's ethylene, not ethane. Wait, but the question says the reaction is of ethane. Hmmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe I misread. Let me recheck: the question says ethane, but the reaction is written as C2H4. Oh wait, that's ethylene. So perhaps that's a mistake. But maybe I'll proceed, assuming the correct formula is C2H6, but the reaction is written as C2H4. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the given formula regardless.

Wait, no, perhaps I should clarify. The question says that the reaction is provided as C2H4, but refers to ethane. That's conflicting. Because ethane is C2H6. Maybe the problem intended ethylene but wrote ethane. Or maybe it's a typo. But I'll proceed with the given equation, which is C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. So maybe the question is about ethylene, not ethane. Hmm, but okay, the given mass is 84g of ethane, which is C2H6. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, this is confusing. Let me re-read carefully.

The problem states: "if a reaction was provided with 84g of ethane and unlimited oxygen, how many grams of carbon dioxide would result." The reaction given is C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. Oh, wait, that's a problem because ethane is C2H6, not C2H4. So perhaps there's a mistake here. But perhaps I should proceed with the given equation, which uses C2H4, even though the question refers to ethane. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the reaction should be C2H6. But since I can't change the problem, I'll proceed with what's given, which is C2H4. 

So, the first step is to balance the equation. The reaction is C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. Let's balance it.

On the left side: 2 C, 4 H, 2 O (from O2).

On the right side: CO2 has 1 C and 2 O each, and H2O has 2 H and 1 O each.

Let me balance the carbons first. There are 2 C on the left, so on the right, we'll have 2 CO2.

Now, the equation becomes C2H4 + O2 → 2 CO2 + H2O.

Now, let's look at the hydrogens. On the left, there are 4 H in C2H4. On the right, H2O has 2 H, so we need 2 H2O to get 4 H. So, the equation becomes:

C2H4 + O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O.

Now, let's count the oxygens. On the right, 2 CO2 contributes 2*2=4 O, and 2 H2O contributes 2*1=2 O, total of 6 O atoms. On the left, O2 has 2 O atoms per molecule. So to get 6 O atoms, we need 3 O2 molecules.

So the balanced equation is C2H4 + 3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O.

Wait, let me double-check. C2H4 has 2 C, 4 H. On the right, 2 CO2 has 2 C, and 2 H2O has 4 H. So C and H are balanced. For O: 3 O2 is 6 O atoms. On the right, 2 CO2 has 4 O and 2 H2O has 2 O, total 6. So yes, balanced.

So the balanced equation is C2H4 + 3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O.

Now, the problem gives 84 grams of ethane, but wait, ethane is C2H6. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because the reaction is written with C2H4. So perhaps the problem is actually about ethylene, but mistakenly refers to ethane. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction should be for ethane. Hmm. But regardless, perhaps the problem is as given, and the starting material is C2H4, but the question refers to ethane. That's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the reaction as given, regardless of the name. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the reaction is correct, and the 84g is of C2H4. But the question says ethane, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. The question says that 84g of ethane is provided, but the reaction is written as C2H4. So perhaps that's a mistake, and the reaction should be for ethane, which is C2H6. So perhaps the correct reaction should be C2H6 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. Let me try that again with C2H6.

Let me balance that correctly. So C2H6 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

C2H6 has 2 C and 6 H.

To balance C, we'll have 2 CO2.

Hydrogen: 6 H in C2H6 will need 3 H2O (since each H2O has 2 H, so 3*2=6 H).

So equation becomes C2H6 + O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O.

Now, count O atoms. Right side: 2 CO2 has 4 O, 3 H2O has 3 O. Total O: 7 O atoms.

Each O2 has 2 O atoms, so to get 7 O, we need 7/2 O2, which is 3.5 O2. But since we can't have fractions, we can multiply all coefficients by 2 to eliminate the fraction.

So multiply each by 2:

2 C2H6 + 7 O2 → 4 CO2 + 6 H2O.

Wait, no, let me recheck. Original equation after C and H balance: C2H6 + O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O.

So, O on the right: 2*(CO2) has 2*2=4 O, 3*(H2O) has 3*1=3 O. Total O: 7. So O2 must provide 7 O atoms, which is 7/2 O2 molecules, which is 3.5 O2. So to eliminate the fraction, multiply everything by 2:

2 C2H6 + 7 O2 → 4 CO2 + 6 H2O.

Now, the equation is balanced.

So now, the problem states that we have 84g of ethane (C2H6), and excess O2, so ethane is the limiting reagent.

The question is how much CO2 is produced.

First, find the molar mass of C2H6.

C: 12 amu * 2 =24.

H: 1 *6=6.

So molar mass =24 +6=30 g/mol.

Given 84g of C2H6, moles = mass/molar mass = 84g /30 g/mol = 2.8 moles.

Now, from the balanced equation, 2 moles of C2H6 produce 4 moles of CO2.

Wait, because 2 C2H6 → 4 CO2, so the mole ratio is 4 CO2 per 2 C2H6, which simplifies to 2 CO2 per 1 C2H6.

So, moles of CO2 = 2.8 moles C2H6 * (4 CO2 / 2 C2H6) )= 2.8 * (4/2) = 2.8 * 2 =5.6 moles CO2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck the balanced equation. From 2 C2H6 →4 CO2, so per mole of C2H6, (4 CO2)/(2 C2H6)= 2 CO2 per 1 C2H6. So yes, 2.8 moles C2H6 * 2 CO2/C2H6 = 5.6 moles CO2.

Now, molar mass of CO2: C=12, O=16*2=32. Total=44 g/mol.

So mass of CO2 = moles * molar mass =5.6 *44 =246.4 g.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 246.4. Let's look at the options again.

The options are: A:78, B:210, C:312, D:528, E:156, F:44, G:264, H:180, I:132, J:396.

Hmm, 246.4 isn't listed. That's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the balanced equation. Let me go back.

Wait, wait, the initial reaction given in the problem is C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O, but the question says it's ethane (C2H6) that's reacting. So perhaps I should have used C2H6 instead of C2H4. So perhaps I should redo the calculation with the correct balanced equation for C2H6.

Wait, but earlier I tried that. Let me make sure.

Wait, in the initial problem, the question says that 84g of ethane is provided. So the reaction should involve C2H6, but the given reaction in the problem is C2H4. That's conflicting. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the given reaction, but adjust the calculations accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem gives the reaction as C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. But the substance provided is ethane (C2H6). So perhaps the reaction is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the given reaction as C2H4, so perhaps the 84g is of C2H4.

Wait, but the question says ethane (C2H6), so perhaps the reaction should be adjusted. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the reaction is for ethane, so I should use C2H6 in the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the given reaction's stoichiometry, regardless of the name. So the reaction is C2H4 +3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O. So let's proceed with that.

Wait, in that case, the given mass is 84g of C2H4. Because the reaction is for C2H4.

So, if the question is about ethane, but the reaction is for C2H4, perhaps there's a mistake. But perhaps I should proceed with the given data. Let's try that.

So, assuming the reaction is for C2H4, and the mass given is 84g of C2H4.

C2H4 has molar mass: 2*12 +4*1=24+4=28 g/mol.

Moles C2H4=84g /28 g/mol=3 moles.

The balanced equation is C2H4 +3 O2 →2 CO2 +2 H2O.

So, per 1 mole of C2H4, 2 moles of CO2 are produced.

So moles of CO2=3 *2=6 moles.

Molar mass of CO2=44 g/mol.

Mass CO2=6 *44=264g. So option G is 264g.

Looking at the options, option G is 264g.

But wait, earlier when I considered the reaction with C2H6, I got 246.4g, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the given reaction, C2H4, regardless of the name.

But wait, the question says ethane, which is C2H6, but the reaction is C2H4. So perhaps the problem intended the reaction to be for C2H6, but wrote C2H4. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and I should proceed with the given reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the reaction is for C2H4, but the given mass is of ethane (C2H6), which is 84g. But that would mean that the molar mass is different, leading to a different number of moles.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the given reaction, assuming that the 84g is of C2H4, not C2H6. Because the reaction is written as C2H4. So perhaps the question mistakenly refers to ethane when it's actually ethylene. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the reaction as given.

So, with 84g of C2H4, which has a molar mass of 28 g/mol. Moles=84/28=3 mol.

From the balanced equation, 1 mole C2H4 gives 2 moles CO2.

So 3 moles C2H4 → 6 moles CO2.

Each mole of CO2 is 44g, so 6*44=264g. So option G.

But wait, the question says ethane, which is C2H6. But if I proceed as if the reaction is C2H4, then the answer is 264g, which is option G.

Alternatively, if I proceed with C2H6 (ethane) with the reaction I balanced earlier, which gave 246.4g, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the given reaction (C2H4), and thus the answer is G.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check the balanced reaction.

The given reaction is C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

When I balanced it, I got C2H4 +3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O.

Yes, that's correct.

So moles of C2H4: 84g /28 g/mol=3.

Moles CO2=3 *2=6.

Mass CO2=6 *44=264g.

So option G is 264g, which is present.

Wait, but the question says ethane, which is different. So perhaps the correct answer is option G because that's what the given reaction leads to.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct approach is to use the given reaction, regardless of the name ethane. So the answer is G:264g.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start with the given reaction:

**Unbalanced reaction:**  
\[ \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

### Step 1: Balance the reaction
1. Balance carbon (C): There are 2 carbons on the left, so we place 2 CO₂ on the right.  
2. Balance hydrogen (H): There are 4 hydrogens on the left, so we place 2 H₂O on the right.  
3. Balance oxygen (O): On the right, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) oxygens from CO₂ and \(2 \times 1 = 2\) oxygens from H₂O, for a total of 6 oxygens. Since each O₂ molecule contains 2 oxygens, we need \(6 / 2 = 3\) O₂ molecules on the left.

The balanced reaction is:  
\[ \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + 3\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \]

### Step 2: Determine the limiting reagent
The problem states that 84 g of ethane (\(\text{C}_2\text{H}_6\)) is provided, but the reaction is written for ethylene (\(\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\)). This discrepancy suggests either a mislabeling in the problem or a mismatch between the reaction and the given compound. To proceed, we assume the reaction is for ethylene (\(\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\)) and that the 84 g refers to ethylene.

### Step 3: Calculate moles of \(\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\)
The molar mass of \(\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\) is:  
\[
\text{Molar mass of C}_2\text{H}_4 = (2 \times 12) + (4 \times 1) = 24 + 4 = 28 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The number of moles of \(\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\) is:  
\[
\text{Moles of C}_2\text{H}_4 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{84}{28} = 3 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Use stoichiometry to find moles of \(\text{CO}_2\)
From the balanced reaction, 1 mole of \(\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\) produces 2 moles of \(\text{CO}_2\). Therefore, 3 moles of \(\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\) produce:  
\[
\text{Moles of CO}_2 = 3 \times 2 = 6 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step
