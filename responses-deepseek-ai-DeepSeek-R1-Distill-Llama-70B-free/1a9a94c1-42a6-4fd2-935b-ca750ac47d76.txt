Okay, so I've got this question about the Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model by Atkinson, Morten, and Sue from 1993. Hmm, I remember that this model is about how people develop their racial and cultural identity, especially in the context of minority groups. The question is asking which stage is when people start to question their rejection of the dominant culture and their absolute loyalty to their own culture.

Let me think about the stages. I think the model has several stages. The options given are A to J, so I need to match each option to what I know.

I recall that the stages are something like: Pre-encounter, Encounter, Identification, Internalization, and maybe some others. Wait, or maybe it's a different order. Alternatively, I think some models break it down into more stages. Let me think again. Oh right, Atkinson's model has five stages: Pre-encounter, Encounter, Identification, Internalization, and maybe another one. Or perhaps it's Conformity, Dissonance, Resistance, etc. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think the model goes through stages like Conformity, Dissonance, Resistance and Immersion, Introspection, and Integrative Awareness. Or is that another model? Maybe the Sue and Sue model is similar. Wait, Atkinson's model is for racial identity, so the stages might be different.

Wait, the options given are: resistance and immersion, integrative awareness, immersion, reintegration, dissonance, encounter, pre-encounter, conformity, introspection, internalization and commitment.

So, the question is about a stage where someone begins to question their rejection of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own. So prior to this, they might have been rejecting the dominant culture and fully embracing their own. So moving beyond that stage.

I think the model's stages are as follows:

1. Pre-encounter: Where individuals are unaware or have not encountered issues regarding their race, so they might conform to the dominant culture.

2. Encounter: An event makes them aware of racial issues, leading to dissonance.

3. Identification: They start to explore and identify with their own culture, possibly rejecting the dominant one.

4. Internalization: They have a secure sense of self within their culture.

Wait, but another breakdown I've heard includes stages like Resistance and Immersion, where individuals immerse themselves in their own culture and resist the dominant one. Then, perhaps the next stage involves more introspection or integration.

So the person in the Resistance and Immersion stage is deeply into their own culture and rejecting the dominant. But the next stage might be where they start to question that stance. So the question is, which stage comes after Resistance and Immersion where they start to question their rejection.

Looking at the options, the next stage after Resistance and Immersion could be Introspection or Integrative Awareness. Alternatively, maybe Internalization and Commitment.

Wait, another approach. The question says, they begin to question their rejection of the dominant culture. So perhaps they're moving from a stage where they rejected the dominant culture to a more integrated view.

I think the stage after Resistance and Immersion is Introspection, where they question their previous beliefs. So in the Introspection stage, they might start to see that not all aspects of the dominant culture are bad and that their own culture can coexist or integrate with it.

Alternatively, the Integrative Awareness stage might be when they start to see both cultures more holistically. Or perhaps it's the Internalization and Commitment stage where they've committed to integrating both aspects.

Wait, but the question is about the beginning of questioning, which would be earlier. So maybe it's the Introspection stage.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the order. Atkinson's model, if I recall correctly, is:

1. Pre-encounter

2. Encounter

3. Identification (which includes Resistance and Immersion)

4. Internalization (which includes Integrative Awareness)

Wait, so perhaps the stages are more detailed. So the Identification stage is when they reject the dominant culture and immerse in their own. Then, the next stage is Internalization, which involves more integration.

So, the person in the Internalization stage may start to question their prior rejection. So, the stage would be Integrative Awareness, which is part of Internalization.

Looking at the options, option B is Integrative Awareness. So that might be the answer.

Alternatively, another model I'm thinking of is Cross's model for Black identity, which has stages like Pre-encounter, Encounter, Immersion, Internalization, etc. But this is the Atkinson model.

Wait, let me try to outline Atkinson's model more clearly. I think the stages are:

1. Pre-encounter: No awareness, conform to dominant culture.

2. Encounter: Experience makes them aware of racial issues, leading to dissonance.

3. Resistance and Immersion: Reject dominant culture, immerse in own culture.

4. Introspection: Questioning and exploring their previous stance.

5. Integrative Awareness: Integration and balance between cultures.

So the question is about when they begin to question their rejection of the dominant culture. That would be during Introspection, perhaps. Because in Resistance and Immersion, they're rejecting the dominant culture. Then, in Introspection, they start to question that.

But the question's wording says they begin to question their rejection, which is a shift from rejecting to maybe considering some aspects. So it's the transition from Resistance and Immersion to the next stage.

Wait, but the options include Resistance and Immersion as option A. So, perhaps the stage after that is Introspection. So the correct answer would be Introspection, which is option I.

Wait, but the question is about the beginning of questioning, so maybe that's the Introspection stage. So the answer would be I: introspection.

Alternatively, maybe the stage after Resistance and Immersion is Internalization and Commitment, which would be option J. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The model's stages as I remember are:

1. Conformity (Pre-encounter)

2. Dissonance (Encounter)

3. Resistance and Immersion

4. Introspection

5. Integrative Awareness (Internalization)

So the fourth stage, Introspection, is when they start to question their previous stance of rejecting the dominant culture. So the answer would be I: introspection.

Alternatively, perhaps the stage after Resistance and Immersion is Integrative Awareness, which is option B. Because after immersing in their own culture, they start to integrate both perspectives.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of each option's stage.

Option A: Resistance and Immersion – that's when they reject the dominant culture.

Option I: Introspection – they start to question their own culture's aspects and the dominant.

Option B: Integrative Awareness – when they can see both cultures more holistically.

So the question is about when they begin to question their rejection of the dominant culture. So during Introspection, they're questioning their own stance. So the answer would be I.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the model's stages are:

1. Pre-encounter (no awareness).

2. Encounter (event happens).

3. Resistance and Immersion (reject dominant, embrace own).

4. Introspection (questioning their position).

5. Integrative Awareness (integration).

So the person in the Resistance and Immersion stage is fully rejecting the dominant culture. Then, in Introspection, they start to question that. So the correct stage is Introspection, option I.

But I've also heard that the Internalization stage is when they commit to integrating both, so perhaps that's when they stop rejecting. Hmm, maybe I should look for another angle.

Wait, the question says "begin to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture." So they're moving away from that absolute loyalty, which was the Resistance and Immersion stage. So the next stage after Resistance and Immersion is Introspection, where they begin to question.

So the answer would be I: introspection.

The Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model by Atkinson, Morten, and Sue (1993) outlines stages through which individuals develop their racial and cultural identity. The question asks which stage marks the beginning of questioning the rejection of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to one's own culture. 

The stages of the model are as follows:

1. **Pre-encounter**: Characterized by a lack of awareness of racial issues and conformity to the dominant culture.
2. **Encounter**: Triggered by an event that raises awareness of racial issues, leading to dissonance.
3. **Resistance and Immersion**: Individuals reject the dominant culture and immerse themselves in their own culture, exhibiting absolute loyalty to it.
4. **Introspection**: A stage where individuals begin to question their previous rejection of the dominant culture and their absolute loyalty to their own culture.
5. **Integrative Awareness**: A stage of integration, where individuals develop a balanced and holistic view of both cultures.

The key to answering the question lies in identifying the stage where individuals start to question their rejection of the dominant culture. This occurs in the **Introspection** stage, where individuals reflect on and reassess their earlier stance of rejecting the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture.

Thus, the correct answer is:

I: introspection

Answer: I
