Okay, so I have this question about psychosomatic disorders, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Hmm, let's start by breaking down what I know about this topic.

First, the term "psychosomatic" comes from two Greek words: "psyche," meaning mind, and "soma," meaning body. So, I think it has something to do with the connection between the mind and the body. I've heard that psychosomatic disorders are conditions where psychological factors influence physical symptoms or illnesses. So, it's not just in the mind; there are real physical symptoms involved.

The question asks what a psychosomatic disorder is, how it's induced, and gives examples. Looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly describes this.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says it's an illness where symptoms are faked for personal gain. That doesn't sound right. I think that's more like malingering or factitious disorder, not psychosomatic. So A is probably wrong.

Option B claims it's a condition where psychological issues cause only cognitive problems like memory loss. Wait, no. Psychosomatic involves physical symptoms, so B is incorrect because it's only about cognitive issues.

Option C describes it as a chronic disorder without recognizable symptoms but psychological origins. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If there are no symptoms, how would it be a disorder? Plus, psychosomatic disorders do have physical symptoms. So C is wrong.

Option D says it's a disease cured by psychological treatment. Well, some might be helped by that, but not all. For example, if stress causes high blood pressure, managing stress could help, but it's not a cure-all. Also, the question is about the definition, not treatment. So D might not be the best choice.

Option E states it's a bodily disturbance caused or worsened by psychological stress, with examples like peptic ulcers, high blood pressure, asthma, etc. This aligns with what I remember. Psychological stress can trigger or exacerbate physical conditions. The examples listed here are classic ones I've heard before, so E looks promising.

Option F says it's caused solely by environmental factors with no psychology. That can't be right because psychosomatic is about the mind-body connection. F is incorrect.

Option G is about mental disorders caused by physical illness. That sounds more like a somatopsychic issue, maybe, but I'm not sure. Either way, it's the opposite of psychosomatic, so G is wrong.

Option H describes health problems without stress or psychological factors, like broken bones. That's the opposite of psychosomatic, so H is incorrect.

Option I talks about mental illnesses with emotional symptoms only, like anxiety. But psychosomatic is about physical symptoms, so I is wrong.

Option J says it's a physical illness with no known cause. That doesn't fit because psychosomatic has known psychological causes. So J is incorrect.

So, after going through each option, E seems to be the correct answer. It correctly defines psychosomatic disorders as physical disturbances induced or worsened by psychological stress, with appropriate examples.
