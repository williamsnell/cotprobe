Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the number of moles of hydrogen gas in a steel cylinder. Let me see... I remember that this has to do with the ideal gas law. The formula is PV = nRT, right? Where P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

Alright, the given values are: the volume V is 50 liters, pressure P is 10 atmospheres, temperature is 27 degrees Celsius, and R is 0.082 liter-atm/mole·K. Oh wait, temperature needs to be in Kelvin, so I have to convert that. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 27 + 273.15 is... let me calculate that. 27 plus 273 is 300, and then plus 0.15 makes it 300.15 K. I'll just round that to 300 K for simplicity, maybe? Or should I keep it as 300.15? Hmm, probably doesn't make a huge difference in the final answer, so I'll go with 300 K.

Now plug everything into the ideal gas equation. The formula rearranged to solve for n is n = PV/(RT). So let's plug in the numbers.

P is 10 atm, V is 50 L. Multiply those together: 10 * 50 = 500. Then R is 0.082, and T is 300. So the denominator is 0.082 * 300. Let me compute that. 0.082 times 300... 0.08 * 300 is 24, and 0.002 * 300 is 0.6. So 24 + 0.6 is 24.6. So denominator is 24.6.

Now n is 500 divided by 24.6. Let me do that division. Hmm, 500 / 24.6. Well, 24.6 times 20 is 492, because 24 * 20 is 480 and 0.6*20 is 12, so 480+12=492. So 24.6 *20=492. Subtract that from 500, we get 8. So it's 20 with a remainder of 8. Now, 8 /24.6 is approximately 0.325. So about 20.325 moles.

Looking at the answer choices, I see option A is 20, option H is 10, and others are between. Wait, but did I make any calculation errors? Let me double-check.

PV is 10 atm * 50 L = 500 L·atm. R is 0.082, T is 300 K. 0.082 *300 is 24.6, correct. So 500/24.6 is approximately 20.325. So that's about 20.3 moles. The closest option is A:20, but let me see if any other options are close. Oh, but wait, maybe I should be more precise with the temperature. Let me redo the temperature more accurately. 27°C + 273.15 is 300.15 K. So R*T =0.082 *300.15.

Calculating that: 0.082 * 300 is 24.6, and 0.082 *0.15 is 0.0123. So total is 24.6 + 0.0123 = 24.6123. So n = 500 /24.6123 ≈ let's compute this.

500 divided by 24.6123. Let's see, 24.6123 *20 = 492.246. 500 -492.246=7.754. So 7.754 /24.6123 ≈ approx 0.3145. So total is 20.3145. So approximately 20.3 moles.

Looking at the options, option A is 20, which is the closest. So the answer should be A:20 moles.

To determine the number of moles of hydrogen gas in the steel cylinder, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

### Given Data:
- **Pressure (P):** 10 atm  
- **Volume (V):** 50 L  
- **Temperature (T):** 27°C (converted to Kelvin: \( T = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \))  
- **Gas constant (R):** 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K)  

### Step 1: Calculate \( PV \)
\[
PV = 10 \, \text{atm} \times 50 \, \text{L} = 500 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( RT \)
\[
RT = 0.082 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \times 300.15 \, \text{K} = 24.6123 \, \text{L·atm/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( n \)
\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{500}{24.6123} \approx 20.3 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The closest option to \( n \approx 20.3 \, \text{moles} \) is **20 moles**.
