Question:

The circumference of a helium-filled balloon is measured for three different conditions: at room temperature, after being in a warm oven for 30 minutes, and after being in a freezer for 30 minutes. A student plotting the circumference cubed C^3 as a function of temperature T, should expect to find which of the following?

Options:

A: an indirect relationship between C^3 and T
B: an extrapolated temperature T where C^3 reaches zero
C: a constant value for C^3 irrespective of T
D: a quadratic relationship between C^3 and T
E: a direct relationship between C^3 and T
F: a cubic relationship between C^3 and T
G: a relationship where C^3 decreases exponentially as T increases
H: a linear relationship between C^3 and T
I: a minimum C^3 as the temperature T increases
J: a maximum C^3 as the temperature T increases

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a helium-filled balloon and how its circumference changes with temperature. I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I'll try to think this through.

The question says that a student is plotting the cube of the circumference (C³) against temperature (T). The options are about what kind of relationship they should expect. Hmm, I remember that for ideal gases, there are certain laws that relate pressure, volume, and temperature. 

Wait, the balloon is filled with helium, which is a noble gas and should behave like an ideal gas under normal conditions. So I think I should use Charles's Law or something similar. Charles's Law says that, at constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. But wait, this is about the circumference of the balloon, not the volume directly. 

So the balloon's circumference relates to its radius. The circumference C is 2πr, and the volume V is (4/3)πr³. So if I solve for r in terms of C, I get r = C/(2π). Then the volume V becomes (4/3)π (C/(2π))³. Let me compute that:

(4/3)π * (C³)/(8 π³) ) = (4/3) * (C³) / (8 π²) ) = (C³) * (4)/(24 π²) ) = (C³)/(6 π²). So V is proportional to C³. 

Oh, so V ∝ C³. And from Charles's Law, V ∝ T when pressure is constant. So putting those together, C³ should be proportional to T. That means when you plot C³ against T, you should get a straight line, a linear relationship. 

Looking at the options, option H says a linear relationship between C³ and T. That sounds right. The other options don't fit. Option E says a direct relationship, which is kind of the same as H, but H is more specific. So I think the correct answer is H.

The problem involves analyzing the relationship between the circumference cubed (\(C^3\)) of a helium-filled balloon and temperature (\(T\)). Helium behaves as an ideal gas under normal conditions, so Charles's Law applies, which states that volume (\(V\)) is directly proportional to absolute temperature (\(T\)) at constant pressure. 

The circumference of the balloon relates to its radius (\(r\)) as \(C = 2\pi r\), and the volume of the balloon is proportional to \(r^3\). Substituting \(r = \frac{C}{2\pi}\) into the volume formula, it can be shown that \(V \propto C^3\). Combining this with Charles's Law (\(V \propto T\)), it follows that \(C^3 \propto T\). 

Thus, when plotting \(C^3\) as a function of \(T\), a linear relationship is expected. Among the options, this corresponds to option **H**, which describes a linear relationship between \(C^3\) and \(T\).

Answer: H
