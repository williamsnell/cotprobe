Question:

A plumbing company hired a worker to work at various construction sites. The worker used his own truck to travel between the company's warehouse and the construction sites, but the company fitted the truck with a rack for carrying plumbing pipes. The company paid the worker for traveling between the warehouse and the construction sites, but not for his drive to and from work. Because the worker was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the construction sites, the company asked the worker, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The worker represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company made no effort to verify the worker's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the worker carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured. In her subsequent action against the plumbing company, based on a theory of negligent hiring, is the woman likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the company was not responsible for the worker's actions during his commute to work.
B: No, because the worker was an independent contractor.
C: No, because the worker was responsible for his own actions outside of work hours.
D: No, because the company was not aware of the worker's suspended license.
E: Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials.
F: Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.
G: Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.
H: No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.
I: Yes, because the worker was using a truck fitted by the company at the time of the accident.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this negligent hiring question. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, there's a plumbing company that hired a worker. The worker used his own truck to go between the company's warehouse and construction sites. The company added a rack for carrying pipes. They paid him for the travel between warehouse and sites but not for commuting to and from work. 

Before hiring, the company asked if he had a valid driver's license because he needed to haul pipes. He said yes, but actually, his license was suspended due to reckless driving. The company didn't check. Then, one morning while driving to work, he caused a collision, injuring a woman. She's suing the company for negligent hiring.

The question is whether she'll prevail.

Hmm, I remember that negligent hiring is when an employer fails to exercise reasonable care in hiring someone and that failure leads to harm. The key points are whether the employer knew or should have known about the employee's unfitness and whether that unfitness caused the harm.

In this case, the company asked about the license but didn't verify. His license was suspended because he was a reckless driver. But the accident happened while he was commuting to work, not during work hours or while driving between sites.

Wait, the company paid him for traveling between warehouse and sites, so that's part of his job. But the accident was during his commute, which isn't paid. So was he acting within the scope of employment when the accident occurred? That's a crucial point.

If the accident happened while commuting, generally, the employer isn't liable because the commute is outside the scope of employment. Unless there's something that ties the commute to the job, like using a company vehicle or something. But here, he's using his own truck, though the company fitted it with a pipe rack. But at the time of the accident, he was driving to work, not on a work-related trip.

Wait, but the company required him to have a valid license because he had to drive between sites. So the company's failure to check his license led to hiring someone unfit. But how does that connect to the accident?

The woman's lawsuit is based on negligent hiring. So she has to show that the company's negligence in hiring caused her injury.

But the accident occurred during his commute. So, is there a connection between the company's failure to verify the license and the accident? Because the worker's reckless driving caused the accident, which led to the injury.

But since the accident happened while commuting, which is outside the scope of employment, the company might not be liable. Unless there's a specific reason to extend liability.

Wait, but maybe the company had a duty to ensure he had a valid license because he was driving as part of his job. So, perhaps the negligent hiring is about the failure to check his driving eligibility, which made him a risk when driving for work. But in this case, the accident was when he was commuting, not driving for work.

So, does the company's duty in negligent hiring extend to situations where the employee is driving outside of work? I think not. Because negligent hiring applies when the employee's actions within the scope of employment cause harm.

But wait, another angle: the company required him to have a driver's license, so they had a duty to verify it. If they had, they wouldn't have hired him, perhaps. So by not verifying, they allowed him to drive for work purposes, which he wasn't supposed to do because his license was suspended. But the accident happened while commuting, not while working.

Alternatively, the fact that he was driving his own truck with the company's rack might imply that he was using it for work purposes even while commuting, but that's a stretch. I think the key is that the accident happened during his commute, which is outside the scope of employment.

So looking at the options:

Option A: No, because the company wasn't responsible for his commute. That seems plausible.

Option B: No, if he's an independent contractor. The question says he was hired as a worker, so probably an employee, not independent contractor.

Option C: No, because he was responsible outside work hours. But that's more about the time, not the activity.

Option D: No, because company didn't know. But they should have known if they checked.

Option E: Yes, because company should have verified. But if the accident wasn't during work, does that matter?

Option G: Yes, duty to ensure valid licenses. But the accident was during commute.

Option H: No, because duty extends only to actions in scope of employment. That seems correct because the accident was during commute.

So the answer would be either A or H.

Between A and H: The question is whether the company's duty in negligent hiring only applies when the employee is acting within the scope of employment. If the harm occurs outside that scope, like commuting, then the company isn't liable.

Therefore, the correct answer would be H: No, because the company's duty extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.

Wait, but the company's duty in negligent hiring is about the risk that the employee poses in the job. So if the employee's unfitness (bad driving) is a risk when driving for work, but the accident happened while commuting, which isn't part of the job. So the company might not be liable because the harm occurred outside the scope.

So the answer is H.

The question revolves around whether the plumbing company can be held liable for negligent hiring after the worker caused a collision while commuting to work. Negligent hiring occurs when an employer fails to exercise reasonable care in hiring, leading to harm caused by an employee's unfitness for the job. The key issue is whether the company's failure to verify the worker's driver's license, which was suspended due to reckless driving, constitutes negligent hiring, and whether this failure caused the harm in question.

The company required the worker to have a valid driver's license because his job involved driving between the warehouse and construction sites. However, the accident occurred during the worker's commute, which is outside the scope of his employment. Generally, employers are not liable for an employee's actions during their commute unless there is a specific connection to the job. While the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack for work purposes, this does not extend liability to the worker's commute.

The company's duty to verify the worker's credentials pertains to his ability to perform job-related tasks, such as driving between work locations. However, since the accident occurred during the worker's commute, the company's duty to exercise care in hiring does not extend to this situation. Therefore, the company is not likely to be held liable for negligent hiring in this case.

The best answer is H: No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.

Answer: H
