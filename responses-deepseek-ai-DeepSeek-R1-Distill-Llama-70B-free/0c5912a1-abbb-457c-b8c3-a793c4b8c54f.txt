Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with privileges. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a situation where a national association sued a city in federal court, and during the trial, the association's attorney called the city attorney as an adverse witness. The city attorney then asserted attorney-client privilege, arguing that the communications were confidential. Now, the issue is about which law applies when resolving these objections.

First, I remember that in federal courts, the admissibility of evidence is generally governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. But when it comes to privileges, like attorney-client privilege, there's a specific rule. I think it's Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. From what I recall, Rule 501 says that privilege issues are governed by the principles of the common law, except in cases where State law provides the rule of decision for an element of the claim or defense. So, if the case is based on federal law, like here where they're suing under federal statutes, then federal common law on privileges applies. But if it's a state law claim, then state privilege law would apply.

Wait, but the question says the suit is charging violations of several federal statutes. So it's a federal question case. Therefore, the federal court's decision on privileges would be based on federal common law, which in this case, the attorney-client privilege is well-established under federal law.

So looking at the options: Option G says federal privilege law, which fits because this is a federal case. The other options talk about state law where the association or the city is located, but since it's a federal case, those wouldn't apply. Option C mentions either federal or forum state law, but I think in federal cases, it's federal law that governs privileges unless it's a diversity case where state law might apply to substantive issues. But since this is based on federal statutes, it's federal law.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. The case is in federal court, so the Federal Rules of Evidence apply. But Rule 501 specifically states that for privileges, it's the common law as interpreted by federal courts unless it's a state law claim. Since the claims here are based on federal statutes, the federal common law applies, which includes the federal approach to attorney-client privilege.

So the correct answer should be G: federal privilege law.

The question revolves around determining the applicable law for resolving objections based on attorney-client privilege in a federal court case. The suit is brought under federal statutes, making it a federal question case. According to Federal Rule of Evidence 501, privileges in federal court are governed by federal common law when the case involves federal claims. Since the claims here are based on federal statutes, federal privilege law applies. 

Analyzing the options, G correctly identifies that federal privilege law governs such cases. Other options incorrectly suggest state or municipal law, which do not apply here.

Answer: G
