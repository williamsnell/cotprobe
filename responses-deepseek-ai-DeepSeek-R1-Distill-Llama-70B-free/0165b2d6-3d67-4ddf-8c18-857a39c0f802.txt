Question:

In fruit flies, black body color (b) is recessive to the normal wild-type body color (b^+). Cinnabar eye (cn) is recessive to the normal wild-type eye color (cn^+). A homozygous wild-type fly was mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes. The resulting heterozygous F_1 fly was mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes. These were the results in the offspring: 90 wild-type 92 black body and cinnabar eyes 9 black body and wild-type eyes 9 wild-type body and cinnabar eyes What is the map distance between the gene for black body and the gene for cinnabar eyes?

Options:

A: Twelve map units
B: Two hundred map units
C: Forty map units
D: One hundred map units
E: Five map units
F: Twenty-five map units
G: Seventy-five map units
H: Nine map units
I: Eighteen map units
J: Fifty map units

Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about fruit flies and map distances. Hmm, I remember that map distance is related to the percentage of crossing over between two genes. So the closer the genes are on a chromosome, the less likely they are to cross over, right?

The problem says that black body (b) is recessive to wild-type (b+), and cinnabar eye (cn) is recessive to wild-type (cn+). So both are recessive traits.

They did a cross between a homozygous wild-type fly and one with black body and cinnabar eyes. Since the wild-type is homozygous, I guess their genotype is b+ b+ cn+ cn+. The other fly is homozygous recessive: b b cn cn. So the F1 flies would be heterozygous for both traits, right? So F1 genotype is b+ b cn+ cn.

Then, the F1 was mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes, which is probably b b cn cn. So the cross is between a heterozygote (b+ b cn+ cn) and a recessive (b b cn cn). So the possible gametes from the heterozygote would be... hmm, if the genes are linked, the gametes would mostly be parental types, but some recombinant types if crossing over occurs.

The offspring are: 90 wild-type, 92 black and cinnabar, 9 black and wild-type eyes, 9 wild-type body and cinnabar eyes.

Wait, so the wild-type would be showing both dominant traits. The others show various combinations. Let's think about this.

In a test cross like this (where you cross to recessive), the phenotypic ratio can tell us about recombination. Normally, if the genes are linked, you get more of the parental types and less of the recombinants.

Looking at the numbers:

Total offspring: 90 +92 +9 +9 = 200.

So the parental types are wild-type (90) and black body and cinnabar eyes (92). The recombinant types are black body with wild eyes (9) and wild body with cinnabar eyes (9).

So the recombinant frequency is (9 +9)/200 = 18/200 = 0.09, which is 9%.

Wait, but wait, that might not be right. Because in a test cross, the parental phenotypes are the same as the F1's gametes. Wait, no, actually, let me think again.

Wait, the F1 is heterozygous for both traits and the other parent is homozygous recessive. So the F1's gametes would determine the offspring.

If the F1 produces gametes where the two genes are linked, the majority will be parental (b+ cn+ and b cn), and some recombinant (b+ cn and b cn+).

When these gametes meet the test cross gametes (b and cn), the offspring would be:

For gamete b+ cn+ × b cn: b+ b and cn+ cn → wild-type (b+ and cn+ dominant).

For gamete b cn × b cn: b b and cn cn → black and cinnabar eyes.

For gamete b+ cn × b cn: b+ b and cn+ cn → wild-type body (because b+ is dominant) but cinnabar eyes (since cn is recessive and from the other parent it's cn as well). Wait, actually, wait: the F1 gamete is b+ cn, and the other parent's gamete is b and cn. So:

Wait no, the test cross parent is b b cn cn, so it contributes b and cn gametes. So each gamete from F1 will combine with b and cn.

Wait, no, each gamete from the test cross is either b or cn? Wait, no, each gamete from the test cross parent (homozygous) is b for the body and cn for the eye. So the gamete from the test cross parent is b for the body gene and cn for the eye gene.

So F1 gamete types would be:

Parental: b+ cn+ and b cn.

Recombinant: b+ cn and b cn+.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The F1's genotype is b+ b cn+ cn. So the gametes could be:

If no crossing over: b+ cn+ and b cn.

If crossing over occurred, then b+ cn and b cn+.

So when F1 gametes combine with the test cross parent's gametes (b and cn), let's see:

F1 gamete: b+ cn+ × test gamete b cn → offspring genotype: b+ b (so body is wild-type, because b+ is dominant) and cn+ cn (so eyes are wild-type, because cn+ is dominant). So wild-type phenotype.

F1 gamete: b cn × test gamete b cn → b b (black) and cn cn (cinnabar). So black and cinnabar.

F1 gamete: b+ cn × test gamete b cn → b+ b (wild-type body) and cn+ cn (wild-type eyes? Wait, no. Wait, no: the gamete from F1 is b+ (dominant for body) and cn (recessive for eyes). The test gamete is b (recessive for body) and cn (recessive for eyes). So for body: b+ (from F1) and b (from test). So the offspring has b+ b, which is wild-type (dominant). For eyes: cn (F1) and cn (test) → cn cn, which is cinnabar (recessive). So this would be wild-type body and cinnabar eyes.

Similarly, F1 gamete: b cn+ × test gamete b cn → Body: b (F1) and b (test) → b b (black). Eyes: cn+ (F1) and cn (test) → cn+ cn, which is wild-type (dominant, so wild-type eyes). So the phenotype is black body and wild-type eyes.

So the recombinant phenotypes are wild-type body and cinnabar eyes (from gamete b+ cn) and black body and wild-type eyes (from gamete b cn+).

Looking back at the offspring counts:

- Wild-type: 90 → these come from the F1's parental gamete b+ cn+.

- Black and cinnabar: 92 → from F1's parental gamete b cn.

- Wild-type body and cinnabar eyes: 9 → recombinant (b+ cn gamete).

- Black body and wild-type eyes: 9 → recombinant (b cn+ gamete).

So the total recombinants are 9+9=18. So recombinant frequency is 18/200 = 0.09 → 9% map units.

So the map distance is 9 centimorgans.

Looking at the options, option H is nine map units.

To determine the map distance between the genes for black body (b) and cinnabar eyes (cn) in fruit flies, we analyze the results of the test cross. The F1 fly (genotype: b+ b cn+ cn) was mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes (genotype: b b cn cn). The offspring phenotypes were as follows:

- **90 wild-type** (b+ b cn+ cn): These result from the F1's parental gamete (b+ cn+).
- **92 black body and cinnabar eyes** (b b cn cn): These result from the F1's parental gamete (b cn).
- **9 black body and wild-type eyes** (b b cn+ cn): These result from the F1's recombinant gamete (b cn+).
- **9 wild-type body and cinnabar eyes** (b+ b cn cn): These result from the F1's recombinant gamete (b+ cn).

The total number of offspring is:

\[
90 + 92 + 9 + 9 = 200
\]

The recombinant phenotypes (black body and wild-type eyes, wild-type body and cinnabar eyes) total:

\[
9 + 9 = 18
\]

The recombinant frequency is calculated as:

\[
\text{Recombinant Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of Recombinants}}{\text{Total Offspring}} = \frac{18}{200} = 0.09 \, (\text{or } 9\%).
\]

Map distance is equivalent to the recombinant frequency in centimorgans (cM). Therefore, the map distance between the black body and cinnabar eyes genes is **9 centimorgans**.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: Nine map units**
