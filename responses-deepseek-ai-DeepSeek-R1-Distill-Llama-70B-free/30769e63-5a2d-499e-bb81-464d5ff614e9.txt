Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a transverse wave, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The equation given is y = 6.0 sin(0.020πx + 4.0πt), and I need to find several properties of the wave like amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and so on. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that the general form of a wave equation is something like y = A sin(kx ± ωt + φ), where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase constant. So comparing that to the given equation, I can identify each part.

Starting with part (a), the amplitude. That's straightforward because the coefficient in front of the sine function is the amplitude. So in this case, the amplitude A is 6.0 cm. So any option that doesn't have 6 cm for (a) can be eliminated. Looking at the options, I see that options A, E, F, I have 6 cm for part (a). Others have different values, so those are out.

Next, part (b) is the wavelength. I remember that the wave number k is related to the wavelength λ by the equation k = 2π/λ. In the given equation, the coefficient of x is 0.020π. So k here is 0.020π. So I can set up the equation: 0.020π = 2π/λ. Let me solve for λ. Dividing both sides by π gives 0.020 = 2/λ. Then multiply both sides by λ to get 0.020λ = 2. Then λ = 2 / 0.020. Calculating that, 2 divided by 0.02 is 100. So λ is 100 cm. So for part (b), the wavelength should be 100 cm. Now looking back at the options, options B, I have 100 cm for (b). Option A has 150, which is out. So the possible options now are B and I.

Wait, but wait. I should double-check. Oh right, no mistake there. K is 0.020π, so 2π/λ = 0.020π. Yeah, that gives λ=100 cm. So (b)=100 cm.

Moving on to part (c), the frequency. I know that the angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f by ω=2πf. In the equation, the coefficient of t is 4.0π, so ω is 4.0π. So 4π = 2πf. Dividing both sides by 2π gives f = 2 Hz. So for part (c), the frequency is 2 Hz. Looking at the options, option B has (c) 2 Hz. Option I has 1.59 Hz, which is different. So now only option B and maybe others that weren't in previous cuts. So the possible options now are B.

Wait, let me check. Oh, let me make sure. ω is the coefficient of t, so yes, that's 4π. So ω=4π rad/s. So 2πf is 4π, so f=2 Hz. Correct.

Part (d) is the speed of the wave. I remember that wave speed v is given by v = fλ. We already have f=2 Hz and λ=100 cm. So v = 2 * 100 cm/s = 200 cm/s. So part (d) is 200 cm/s. Looking at option B, (d) is 200 cm/sec. So that's matching.

Part (e) is the direction of propagation. The equation is y = 6 sin(0.020πx + 4πt). The general form is y = A sin(kx ± ωt). If it's positive, the wave is moving in the negative x-direction; if it's negative, it's moving in the positive x-direction. Wait, no, I get confused here. Let me think. The standard form is either y = sin(kx - ωt) which moves to the right (+x direction) or y = sin(kx + ωt) which moves to the left. Because the phase of a wave moving to the right would decrease x as t increases, so kx - ωt. So in our equation, we have kx + ωt, which would mean the wave is moving to the left. So direction is to the left. So part (e) is to the left. Now checking option B: (e) to the left. So that's correct.

Finally, part (f) is the maximum transverse speed of a particle in the wave. I remember that the maximum transverse speed is given by v_max = A * ω. Because the derivative of y with respect to t gives velocity, and the maximum is when the sine is at its maximum rate of change, which is when cos is 1. So dy/dt = A * ω cos(kx + ωt + φ). The maximum value is Aω. So here, A is 6 cm, ω is 4π rad/s. So v_max = 6 * 4π. Let me compute that. 6*4 is 24, so 24π cm/s. Since π is approximately 3.1416, 24*3.1416 is about 75.4 cm/s. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what they have for (f). Option B says (f) 75 cm/sec. Which is close to 24π (~75.4). So that matches.

So putting it all together:

(a) 6 cm

(b) 100 cm

(c) 2 Hz

(d) 200 cm/s

(e) to the left

(f) ~75 cm/s

Looking at the options, option B matches all these. So the correct answer should be option B.

The given wave equation is \( y = 6.0 \sin(0.020\pi x + 4.0\pi t) \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are in cm, and \( t \) is in seconds. The task is to calculate various properties of the wave and match them with the provided options.

### Analysis:

1. **Amplitude (a):**  
   The amplitude \( A \) is the coefficient of the sine function. Here, \( A = 6.0 \, \text{cm} \). Any option without \( 6 \, \text{cm} \) for (a) is eliminated. Options A, E, F, and I remain.

2. **Wavelength (b):**  
   The wave number \( k \) is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) by \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \). From the equation, \( k = 0.020\pi \). Solving \( 0.020\pi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \), we find \( \lambda = 100 \, \text{cm} \). Options B and I have \( 100 \, \text{cm} \) for (b).

3. **Frequency (c):**  
   The angular frequency \( \omega \) is related to the frequency \( f \) by \( \omega = 2\pi f \). From the equation, \( \omega = 4.0\pi \). Solving \( 4.0\pi = 2\pi f \), we find \( f = 2 \, \text{Hz} \). Option B has \( 2 \, \text{Hz} \) for (c), while I has \( 1.59 \, \text{Hz} \), so I is eliminated.

4. **Wave Speed (d):**  
   The wave speed \( v \) is given by \( v = f\lambda \). Substituting \( f = 2 \, \text{Hz} \) and \( \lambda = 100 \, \text{cm} \), we find \( v = 200 \, \text{cm/s} \). Option B matches this value for (d).

5. **Direction of Propagation (e):**  
   The general wave equation is \( y = A \sin(kx \pm \omega t) \). The positive sign in \( y = 6.0 \sin(0.020\pi x + 4.0\pi t) \) indicates that the wave is traveling to the left. Option B matches this for (e).

6. **Maximum Transverse Speed (f):**  
   The maximum transverse speed of a particle is \( v_{\text{max}} = A\omega \). Substituting \( A = 6.0 \, \text{cm} \) and \( \omega = 4.0\pi \, \text{rad/s} \), we find \( v_{\text{max}} = 6 \cdot 4\pi = 24\pi \, \text{cm/s} \). Approximating \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \), \( v_{\text{max}} \approx 75.4 \, \text{cm/s} \). Option B matches this value for (f).

### Conclusion:  
Option B matches all the calculated properties of the wave.
