Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The reaction is between metallic sodium and water, producing sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The reaction given is 2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g). So, for every 2 moles of sodium, 2 moles of water are consumed, and 1 mole of hydrogen gas is produced.

The question has three parts: (a) find the moles of H2 produced, (b) find the moles of water decomposed, and (c) find the percent error in (a) if the gas wasn't collected dry, considering the vapor pressure of water.

The data given is:
- Temperature: 25°C. Oh wait, I need to convert that to Kelvin for gas law calculations. 25 + 273.15 is 298.15 K.
- Pressure: 758 mm Hg. Oh right, standard atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg, but this is slightly less. But wait, when using the ideal gas law, pressure should be in atmospheres. So I'll need to convert mm Hg to atm. Since 760 mm Hg is 1 atm, 758 mm Hg is 758/760 ≈ 0.997 atm. Let me double-check that calculation. 758 divided by 760 is approximately 0.9973 atm. So about 0.997 atm.
- Volume of gas collected: 2.24 liters.
- R is given as 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

For part (a), using the ideal gas law PV = nRT. We can rearrange this to find n, the number of moles. So n = PV / (RT).

Plugging in the numbers:
P = 0.9973 atm,
V = 2.24 L,
R = 0.0821,
T = 298.15 K.

Calculating n:
n = (0.9973 * 2.24) / (0.0821 * 298.15)
Let me compute numerator and denominator.

First, numerator: 0.9973 * 2.24 ≈ 2.235 L·atm.
Denominator: 0.0821 * 298.15 ≈ 24.465 (since 0.08 * 300 is 24, but let's be precise).
0.0821 * 298 = let's compute:
298 * 0.08 = 23.84,
298 * 0.0021 = 0.6258. So total is 23.84 + 0.6258 ≈ 24.4658.

So n ≈ 2.235 / 24.4658 ≈ Let me calculate that.

2.235 divided by 24.4658. Hmm, let's approximate. 24 * 0.091 is 2.184, which is a bit less than 2.235. So 0.0913? Let me do exact division.

24.4658 * 0.0913 = 0.0913 * 24.4658.

Wait, but 2.235 / 24.4658 = approximately 0.0913 moles. So about 0.0913 moles of H2.

Wait, the options list B as 0.0913 moles H2, which seems to match. Let me keep that in mind.

For part (b), the moles of water decomposed. The reaction shows that 2 moles of H2O produce 1 mole of H2. So moles of H2O would be twice the moles of H2. So 0.0913 * 2 = 0.1826, which is approximately 0.183 moles of H2O. So part (b) is about 0.183 moles.

Looking at the options, option B for (a) is 0.0913, so (b) is 0.183. So option B could be a candidate. Let me check the other parts.

Now part (c): percent error in (a) if the gas had been collected dry, considering the vapor pressure of water. Wait, I think the question says that the gas was collected under these conditions, but if it had been collected dry, what's the percent error. Hmm, wait no, I think the initial assumption was that the gas was wet, but part (c) is asking if the hydrogen was collected dry, so perhaps the pressure was different.

Wait, no, let me think again. The initial calculation assumes that the pressure is 758 mm Hg. But if the gas was collected over water, the total pressure includes the vapor pressure of water. So the pressure of the hydrogen gas would be less than the total pressure because water vapor contributes to the total pressure.

Wait, the initial calculation for part (a) used the total pressure (758 mm Hg). But if the hydrogen was collected wet, meaning that it's saturated with water vapor, the actual pressure of the H2 would be lower than 758 mm Hg. Because the total pressure is the sum of H2 and H2O vapor.

So when we collected the gas, the pressure is 758 mm Hg, which is H2 plus water vapor. But in part (c), we're to find the percent error if the gas had been collected dry, meaning that the pressure is only H2. So, in that case, the pressure would be 758 mm Hg, without any water vapor.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I have this reversed.

Wait, when gas is collected over water, the total pressure is atmospheric pressure (or whatever the external pressure is), and the gas is saturated with water vapor. The pressure of the dry gas would be lower by the vapor pressure of water.

But in the given problem, the gas was collected under 758 mm Hg. Wait, perhaps the setup is that the gas is collected by displacement, and the pressure is 758 mm Hg. But whether it's wet or dry affects the partial pressure of H2.

Wait, the way the question is worded: "assuming the vapor pressure of water is 23.8 mm at 25 C." So if the H2 gas was collected wet, then the pressure of H2 would be total pressure minus water vapor pressure. But in the initial collection, perhaps they didn't account for that. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the initial calculation in part (a) used 758 mm Hg as the pressure, but if the gas is wet, that's the total pressure. The actual pressure of H2 would be 758 mm Hg minus 23.8 mm Hg (vapor pressure of H2O). So the actual pressure of H2 is 758 - 23.8 = 734.2 mm Hg. Which is 734.2 /760 atm.

Wait, but in part (a), the calculation used the total pressure (758 mm Hg) as P, which included both H2 and H2O vapor. But that's incorrect because according to Dalton's Law, the pressure in the gas law should be the partial pressure of H2, which is less than the total pressure.

So if we're considering the scenario where the gas is collected wet, the P used in the ideal gas law should be 758 mm Hg minus 23.8 mm Hg. But wait, in part (a), they used the total pressure as if it were all H2, which would lead to a higher calculated n.

But wait, no. Wait, in part (a), the question says that the gas was collected at 25°C under 758 mm Hg pressure. Wait, but if the gas is collected over water, then the total pressure is 758 mm Hg, but the H2's partial pressure is 758 - 23.8 = 734.2 mm Hg. So in reality, the moles of H2 would be based on 734.2 mm Hg, not 758.

But wait, in part (a), I think the initial calculation used P = 758 mm Hg (converted to atm), but that's the total pressure including water vapor. So in reality, the correct pressure for H2 is lower, so n would be lower than what we calculated in part (a).

Wait, but the question in part (c) is about the percent error in (a) if the gas had been collected dry. Hmmm. Let me think again.

Wait, when the gas is collected dry, meaning that there's no water vapor present, so the pressure is all H2. So if the gas is collected dry, P = 758 mm Hg, which is 758/760 atm.

But if the gas was collected wet, then the pressure of H2 is 758 - 23.8 = 734.2 mm Hg, which is 734.2/760 atm.

So the actual moles of H2 would be based on the partial pressure (wet case), but in part (a), we used the total pressure, which is incorrect. So the actual n is lower, and part (a) overestimated n.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: (c) find the percent error in (a) if the gaseous hydrogen had been collected dry. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the problem says: If you collect the gas at 25°C under 758 mm Hg of pressure. So perhaps the 758 mm Hg is the pressure of the gas, regardless of being wet or dry. But in reality, when collecting over water, the total pressure is atmospheric, but in this case, maybe it's a different setup. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it this way: The collection is done under 758 mm Hg pressure, but if the gas is wet, the actual pressure of H2 is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that the gas is collected by displacement, and the total pressure is atmospheric (758 mm Hg), so the partial pressure of H2 would be 758 - 23.8 = 734.2 mm Hg. So in part (a), we used 758 mm Hg, which is the total pressure, but the correct P for H2 is 734.2 mm Hg.

So the correct n in part (a) should be based on P = 734.2 mm Hg. Let's compute that.

n_correct = (734.2 /760) * 2.24 / (0.0821 *298.15)

Wait, let's compute 734.2 mm Hg in atm: 734.2 /760 ≈ 0.9665 atm.

So n_correct = (0.9665 * 2.24) / (0.0821 * 298.15)

Compute numerator: 0.9665 * 2.24 ≈ Let's see: 0.9665 * 2 = 1.933, 0.9665 * 0.24 ≈ 0.232. So total ≈ 2.165.

Denominator: same as before, 24.4658.

n_correct ≈ 2.165 /24.4658 ≈ approx 0.0884 moles.

In part (a), the calculated n was 0.0913, but the correct n is 0.0884. So the percent error would be the difference between these two divided by the correct value, times 100.

So the error is (0.0913 - 0.0884) / 0.0884 *100 = (0.0029 /0.0884)*100 ≈ 3.28%.

Wait, but option B gives 3.24% as the percent error. That's close to my calculation, so perhaps due to rounding, it's about 3.24%.

Wait, but let me do the calculations more accurately.

Compute n_initial (from part a) as 0.0913 moles.

n_correct: Let's compute 734.2 mm Hg to atm: 734.2 /760 = let me compute exactly.

734.2 ÷760 = let me compute 760 * 0.966 = 734.16, which is close to 734.2. So 734.2 /760 = 0.9665 approximately.

So n_correct = (0.9665 atm) * (2.24 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *298.15 K )

Compute denominator: 0.0821 *298.15 = 24.4658.

Numerator: 0.9665 *2.24 = Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 0.9665 *2 = 1.933, 0.9665 *0.24 = 0.23196. So sum is 1.933 + 0.23196 = 2.16496.

So n_correct = 2.16496 /24.4658 ≈ let's compute that.

24.4658 * 0.0884 = approx 2.164, which matches, so 0.0884 moles.

So the percent error is |(0.0913 - 0.0884)| /0.0884 *100 = (0.0029 /0.0884)*100.

0.0029 /0.0884 ≈ 0.0328, so 3.28%. The closest option is B, which says 3.24%, probably due to more precise calculations.

So putting it all together:

(a) 0.0913 moles H2,

(b) 0.183 moles H2O,

(c) 3.24% error.

Looking at the options, option B is: 0.0913 H2, 0.183 water, 3.24% error. So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the reaction and use the ideal gas law to determine the moles of hydrogen gas produced, the moles of water decomposed, and the percent error in the moles of hydrogen if the gas had been collected dry.

### Part (a): Moles of Hydrogen Produced
The ideal gas law is given by:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

Where:
- \(P = 758 \, \text{mm Hg} = \frac{758}{760} \, \text{atm} \approx 0.9973 \, \text{atm}\),
- \(V = 2.24 \, \text{L}\),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\),
- \(T = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298.15 \, \text{K}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{(0.9973)(2.24)}{(0.0821)(298.15)} \approx \frac{2.235}{24.4658} \approx 0.0913 \, \text{moles of H}_2.
\]

### Part (b): Moles of Water Decomposed
From the balanced reaction:

\[
2 \, \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 1 \, \text{H}_2 + 2 \, \text{NaOH},
\]

2 moles of water decompose to produce 1 mole of hydrogen gas. Therefore, the moles of water decomposed are:

\[
\text{Moles of H}_2\text{O} = 2 \times \text{Moles of H}_2 = 2 \times 0.0913 \approx 0.183 \, \text{moles of H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Part (c): Percent Error in (a) if Gas Had Been Collected Dry
If the gas had been collected dry, the pressure of hydrogen gas would have been the total pressure minus the vapor pressure of water. The vapor pressure of water at 25°C is \(23.8 \, \text{mm Hg}\). Thus, the partial pressure of hydrogen is:

\[
P_{\text{H}_2} = 758 \, \text{mm Hg} - 23.8 \, \text{mm Hg} = 734.2 \, \text{mm Hg} = \frac{734.2}{760} \, \text{atm} \approx 0.9665 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Using this corrected pressure in the ideal gas law:

\[
n_{\text{correct}} = \frac{(0.9665)(2.24)}{(0.0821)(298.15)} \approx \frac{2.165}{24.4658} \approx 0.0884 \, \text{moles of H}_2.
\]

The percent error is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percent Error} = \left| \frac{n_{\text{initial}} - n_{\text{correct}}}{n_{\text{correct}}} \right| \times 100 = \left| \frac{0.0913 - 0.0884}{0.0884} \right| \times 100 \approx 3.24\%.
\]

### Final Answer
- (a) Moles of hydrogen produced: \(0.0913 \, \text{moles}\),
- (b) Moles of water decomposed: \(0.183 \, \text{moles}\),
- (c) Percent error: \(3.24\%\).

The correct option is:

**B: 0.0913 mole H\(_2\), 0.183 mole of water, 3.24%**

Answer: B
