Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the shortest path on a conical surface between two points. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The points given are (0,-1,0) and (0,1,0), and the surface is defined by z = 1 - sqrt(x² + y²). Wait, so that's a cone. Let me visualize this. The cone's equation is z = 1 minus the radius in the xy-plane. So the tip of the cone is at (0,0,1), and it opens downward.

The two points are on the surface. Let me check: for (0,-1,0), plugging into the equation: z = 1 - sqrt(0 + (-1)^2) = 1 - 1 = 0. Yep, that's correct. Same for (0,1,0): z=0. So both points are on the cone's base, which is a circle in the plane z=0 with radius 1.

Wait, no, the base of the cone is when z=0, so x² + y² = (1)^2. So the base is a circle of radius 1 in the z=0 plane, centered at (0,0,0). The tip is at (0,0,1).

So the two points are on the base, at (0,-1,0) and (0,1,0). So they're diametrically opposite on the base circle. Wait, but the shortest path on the cone's surface between them—wait, normally, on a flat circle, the shortest path would be along the diameter, but on a cone, it's not so straightforward.

I remember that the shortest path on a cone (or any developable surface) is a geodesic, which when unwrapped onto a flat plane becomes a straight line. So maybe I should unwrap the cone into a flat sector and find the straight line distance there.

So to do that, I need to find the slant height of the cone and the angle of the sector when flattened. Let's think about the cone parameters.

The cone has a height h=1 (from z=1 to z=0) and a base radius r=1. So the slant height l is sqrt(r² + h²) = sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2).

When you unwrap the cone into a flat sector, the radius of the sector is equal to the slant height, so R = sqrt(2). The circumference of the base of the cone is 2πr = 2π(1) = 2π. But when flattened, the sector's arc length is equal to the base circumference. The sector's angle θ is given by θ = (arc length) / R = (2π) / sqrt(2) = (2π)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*π.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sector's circumference when flattened is the same as the base's circumference. So the length of the arc of the sector is 2πr, which is 2π*1=2π. The radius of the sector is the slant height, which is l = sqrt(2). So the angle θ in radians is (arc length)/(radius) = 2π / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*π. So the sector is a portion of a circle with radius sqrt(2) and angle sqrt(2)*π.

Wait, but when you unwrap a cone, the sector's angle is 2π*(r/l), because the arc length is 2πr, and sector radius is l, so θ = 2πr/l. Let me compute: r=1, l= sqrt(2), so θ=2π*1/sqrt(2)= (2π)/sqrt(2)= sqrt(2)*π. Yes, same as before. So the sector is a part of a circle with radius sqrt(2) and angle sqrt(2)*π.

Now, the two points (0,-1,0) and (0,1,0) are on the base of the cone. When unwrapped, they'll be points on the sector. But wait, when unwrapped, each point on the base circle corresponds to a point on the arc of the sector.

Wait, but when you cut the cone along a generator (a straight line from tip to base) and flatten it, the base becomes an arc. So, the two points (0,-1,0) and (0,1,0) are diametrically opposite on the base circle. But when unwrapped into the sector, their positions depend on the angle between them.

Wait, the original base circle has circumference 2π. The sector has an arc length equal to 2π, but the sector's angle is θ=2π*(r/l) = 2π*(1/sqrt(2))=sqrt(2)*π. So the sector is like a pac-man shape with angle θ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the unwrapped sector and see where the two points are. Let me imagine the sector: radius sqrt(2), central angle theta= sqrt(2)*pi.

When I unwrap the cone, each point on the base circle corresponds to a point on the sector's arc. The two points (0,-1,0) and (0,1,0) are on the base circle, diametrically opposite. So their angle around the base circle is π radians apart.

In the unwrapped sector, their positions would be separated by an angle phi, which is (original angle between them) * (sector angle / (2pi)). Because the sector's angle is theta= sqrt(2)*pi, so the factor is (theta)/(2pi) )= sqrt(2)*pi/(2pi) = sqrt(2)/2 = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, if the original angle between them on the base is π, then in the unwrapped sector, the angle between them would be phi = (pi) * (sector angle)/(2pi) ) = pi * (sqrt(2)*pi)/(2pi) )? That doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Another approach: when unwrapped, the sector's circumference is 2pi, so each point on the base circle corresponds to a point on the sector's arc. So if two points are separated by angle alpha on the base circle (e.g., pi radians), their separation on the sector's arc is determined by the angle beta, which is alpha multiplied by (sector's angle)/(2pi). Because the sector's arc is the same as the base's circumference.

So for alpha=pi radians, beta = pi * (sqrt(2)*pi)/(2pi) )= (pi^2 sqrt(2))/(2pi) )= (pi sqrt(2))/2. Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize the points on the sector.

Let me think: when you unwrap the cone, the sector is a part of a circle with radius l=sqrt(2). The points on the base circle (z=0) of the cone correspond to points on the arc of the sector.

So a point (x,y,0) on the base of the cone corresponds to a point in the sector. Let me parametrize the points.

Parametrizing the base circle as (cosφ, sinφ, 0), where φ is the angle parameter. When unwrapped, each such point maps to a point on the sector's arc, at a distance l=sqrt(2) from the origin, making an angle of (φ * (sector angle))/(2pi) ) times the sector angle.

Wait, the sector angle is theta=2pi*(r/l)=2pi*(1/sqrt(2))=sqrt(2)*pi. So each point on the base circle's angle φ corresponds to an angle in the sector given by (φ / (2pi)) * theta = (φ * sqrt(2) pi )/( 2 pi )) = (φ sqrt(2))/2.

Wait, no. Because when you unwrap, the entire base circle (which is 2pi) is represented as the sector's arc length, which is theta * l. Wait, no, the sector's arc length is 2pi*r, which is 2pi*1=2pi. But the sector's radius is l=sqrt(2), so the angle theta is 2pi/(sqrt(2)) )= sqrt(2)*pi. So the sector's angle is theta = 2pi*(r/l) )= 2pi/(sqrt(2))=sqrt(2)*pi.

So, the mapping from the base circle's angle φ (ranging from 0 to 2pi) to the sector's angle phi' (ranging from 0 to theta= sqrt(2)*pi ) is given by phi' = (phi * theta) / (2pi) )= (phi * sqrt(2)*pi )/(2pi) )= (phi * sqrt(2))/2.

So, if two points are at phi1 and phi2 on the base circle, their positions phi1' and phi2' on the sector are given by (phi1*sqrt(2))/2 and (phi2*sqrt(2))/2. The angle between them on the sector is delta_phi' = phi2' - phi1' = ( (phi2 - phi1) * sqrt(2) )/2.

In our case, the two points are (0,-1,0) and (0,1,0), which correspond to phi1 = 3pi/2 and phi2= pi/2, respectively. Wait, no: in standard polar coordinates, (0,-1) is at phi= 3pi/2, and (0,1) is at phi=pi/2. So the angle between them along the base circle is |phi2 - phi1|= |pi/2 - 3pi/2|= pi. Or, if I take the shorter path, it's pi radians.

So, their angular separation on the base circle is pi radians. So when unwrapped, their angular separation on the sector is delta_phi' = (pi) * (sqrt(2)/2 )= (sqrt(2)/2 ) pi.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to map each point's position.

Point 1: (0,-1,0) corresponds to phi1=3pi/2 on the base circle. Its position on the sector would be at angle phi1' = (3pi/2)*sqrt(2)/2 = (3 sqrt(2) pi)/4.

Point 2: (0,1,0) corresponds to phi2=pi/2 on the base circle. Its position on the sector is phi2' = (pi/2)*sqrt(2)/2 = (sqrt(2) pi)/4.

Wait, but then the angular difference between the two points on the sector is phi2' - phi1' = (sqrt(2) pi/4) - (3 sqrt(2) pi/4 )= (-2 sqrt(2) pi )/4 = -sqrt(2) pi/2. But since angles are periodic modulo 2pi, perhaps I should add theta to get the smaller angle. Alternatively, maybe I should take absolute value. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the unwrapped sector as a flat plane and represent the two points as points on this sector. The two points are on the arc of the sector, and the geodesic on the cone corresponds to a straight line in the unwrapped sector.

So, in the unwrapped sector, the two points are located at the ends of the arc, each at a distance l=sqrt(2) from the origin (tip of the cone). The angle between them in the sector is delta_phi' = (sqrt(2)/2 ) * pi, as calculated before.

Wait, let me think again. The sector's angle is theta = sqrt(2)*pi. So the two points are at an angle apart of (sqrt(2)/2)*pi on the sector. So the angle between them in the sector is delta= (sqrt(2)/2)*pi.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Once unwrapped, the two points lie on the arc of the sector, each at radius sqrt(2), and the angle between them is delta = (phi2 - phi1) * (theta)/(2pi). So since phi2 - phi1 is pi, theta is sqrt(2)*pi, then delta = pi * (sqrt(2)*pi)/(2pi) )= (sqrt(2) pi^2 )/(2 pi )= (sqrt(2) pi)/2.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when I unwrap the cone, the angle between the points should be less than the full angle of the sector. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the mapping.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parameterize the points without getting too bogged down. Let's think of the two points on the sector as two points on a circle of radius sqrt(2), separated by some angle.

The key idea is that when unwrapped, the geodesic on the cone becomes a straight line in the sector. So the shortest path on the cone is the length of this straight line.

Once I have the straight-line distance between the two points in the unwrapped sector, that's the length of the geodesic on the cone.

So, in the unwrapped sector, each point is at (sqrt(2), phi1') and (sqrt(2), phi2'), where the angle between them is delta_phi.

Wait, but to find the straight-line distance between them, we can use the law of cosines: distance = sqrt( l^2 + l^2 - 2 l^2 cos(delta_phi) )= l * sqrt(2(1 - cos(delta_phi))).

Wait, but I'm not sure what delta_phi is. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the sector as part of a polar coordinate system and find the chord length.

Wait, let me get back to the basics. The cone's slant height is l= sqrt(2). The sector after unwrapping has radius l and arc length 2pi*r=2pi.

So the sector's angle theta is theta= 2pi * (r/l) )= 2pi*(1/sqrt(2))= sqrt(2)*pi.

So the sector is a part of a circle with radius sqrt(2) and angle theta= sqrt(2)*pi.

The two points on the base of the cone, which are diametrically opposite, when unwrapped, will be points on the sector's arc, separated by an angle that's theta/2. Because on the base circle, they are separated by pi radians, which is half of the full 2pi. Since the sector's angle is theta, their separation in the sector would be theta/2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the sector's angle is theta, so half of that would correspond to the half-circle separation on the base. So the angle between the two points in the sector is theta/2= (sqrt(2)*pi)/2.

So, in the unwrapped sector, the two points are at the same radius l=sqrt(2), separated by angle delta_phi= theta/2= sqrt(2)*pi /2.

So the straight-line distance between them in the unwrapped sector is given by the chord length: chord= 2 l sin(delta_phi /2).

Wait, chord length formula is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle between the two points.

So here, l= sqrt(2), and delta_phi= sqrt(2)*pi/2.

So the chord length is 2*sqrt(2)* sin( (sqrt(2)*pi/2)/2 )= 2 sqrt(2) sin( sqrt(2) pi /4 ).

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Chord length = 2 * l * sin( delta_phi / 2 )

l = sqrt(2), delta_phi= sqrt(2) pi / 2.

So delta_phi /2 = (sqrt(2) pi /2 ) / 2 = sqrt(2) pi /4.

Thus, chord length= 2*sqrt(2)* sin( sqrt(2) pi /4 ).

Wait, let me compute sqrt(2)*pi/4 numerically to see if it's a familiar angle. sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 1.414 * pi ≈ 4.442, divided by 4 is approximately 1.11 radians, which is about 63.7 degrees. Doesn't ring a bell immediately.

But looking at the answer options, none of them have sqrt(2) in the argument. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the sector's angle differently. Let me think again about the sector's angle.

Another approach to compute the sector's angle: when you cut the cone along a generator, the sector's angle is 2pi*r/l, where r is the base radius, and l is the slant height.

So r=1, l=sqrt(2), so the sector's angle is 2pi*(1)/sqrt(2)= (2pi)/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)*pi. So that's correct.

But when the two points are diametrically opposite on the base, their angular separation in the unwrapped sector is (angle of sector) * (their separation on base)/(2pi).

So their separation on the base is pi radians, so in the sector, their separation is (sqrt(2)*pi) * (pi)/(2pi) )= (sqrt(2)*pi^2)/(2pi) )= (sqrt(2) pi )/2. Wait, that's what I had earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the two points in the unwrapped sector as points A and B. The sector is a part of a circle with radius l= sqrt(2), central angle theta= sqrt(2) pi.

Point A is at angle phi in the sector, point B is at phi + delta_phi, where delta_phi is the separation in the sector.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to place point A at angle 0, so its position is (l, 0) in polar coordinates. Then point B is at angle delta_phi, so (l, delta_phi).

Wait, but then the chord length between A and B would be the same as I calculated earlier. So that's 2 l sin(delta_phi/2).

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting tangled up here. Let me try to approach it differently.

When we unwrap the cone into a sector, the problem becomes finding the straight line between the two points in this sector. The length of this line is the length of the geodesic on the cone.

So, to find the straight line distance between the two points in the unwrapped sector, we can model the sector as a polar coordinate system with radius l and angle theta.

Let me represent point
