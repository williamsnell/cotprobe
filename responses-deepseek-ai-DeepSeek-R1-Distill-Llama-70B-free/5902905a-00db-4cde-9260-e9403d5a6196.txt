Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read it carefully. 

The question is about the admissibility of Officer Friendly's testimony in a wrongful death lawsuit. Justin's estate is suing Polly, and they're calling Officer Friendly as a witness. The officer interviewed Polly right after the event, and Polly said, "Oops, I was cleaning my pistol and it went off and shot Justin. I sure was negligent!" The question is whether the officer's testimony about this statement is admissible.

I remember that when a witness testifies about what someone else said, it's usually hearsay unless there's an exception. So the first thing I need to determine is whether Polly's statement falls under any hearsay exceptions.

Looking at the options, option A says it's an admission by a party. I think admissions by a party-opponent are an exception to hearsay. Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's own statement. So if Polly is the defendant, her statement admitting negligence would qualify as an admission. That makes option A potentially correct.

Option B says it's an opinion on an ultimate issue. Wait, Polly said "I sure was negligent." Negligence is a legal conclusion, but I think parties are allowed to express such opinions. The rules don't prohibit a party from stating their own negligence; in fact, that's an admission. So B might not be the right reason to exclude it.

Option C suggests it's a spontaneous statement. Spontaneous statements, or excited utterances under FRE 803(2), are admissible. But for that, the statement must be made under the stress of the event. Here, the officer interviewed Polly right after the event, so maybe she was still under stress. But wait, she was cleaning her pistol, which went offâ€”so the event just happened. But the statement does seem like an admission, so maybe both A and C could apply. But I think as an admission, it's definitely admissible regardless of whether it's spontaneous.

Option D says it's under duress. There's no indication that Polly was under duress when she made the statement to the officer. So D doesn't seem applicable.

Option E is about a recorded statement. The question doesn't mention a recording, so E probably isn't relevant.

Option F says it wasn't under oath. But the statement was made out of court, so it's not required to be under oath to be admissible as an admission. So F isn't a valid reason to exclude it.

Option G is excited utterance. As I thought earlier, if the statement was made while under the stress of the event, it could qualify. But the primary issue here is that it's an admission by a party, which is a more direct exception.

Option H says it's prejudicial. While the statement is damaging, relevance doesn't make it inadmissible unless it's unfairly prejudicial under FRE 403. But here, the statement is highly relevant to the issue of negligence, so the probative value likely outweighs any prejudice. So H isn't the reason.

Option I claims hearsay without exception. But we've established that it does fall under the admission exception, so I is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the best answer seems to be A: Yes, admission by a party. Polly's statement is an admission by the defendant, so it's not hearsay and is admissible.

The admissibility of Officer Friendly's testimony hinges on whether Polly's statement qualifies as an exception to the hearsay rule. Under FRE 801(d)(2), admissions by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay. Polly's statement, "I sure was negligent," directly admits fault, making it an admissible admission by the defendant. While other exceptions like excited utterance (FRE 803(2)) might apply, the statement's classification as an admission provides a clear and direct basis for admissibility. Other options, such as duress or lack of oath, are irrelevant here. Thus, the testimony is admissible as an admission by a party.
