Okay, so I have this question about converting Fahrenheit to Celsius. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out. The question is asking what temperature in Celsius corresponds to a common room temperature of 68°F. The options are from A to J, with various Celsius values.

I remember that there's a formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Let me try to recall it. Oh right, the formula is C = (F - 32) * (5/9). So I need to plug in 68 for F and do the math.

Wait, let me make sure I got the formula right. Yeah, I think that's correct. So first, subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature, then multiply by 5/9 to get Celsius.

So let's do the calculation step by step. 68 minus 32 is... let's see, 68-30 is 38, minus another 2 is 36. So that's 36. Now multiply that by 5/9. Hmm, what's 36 times 5? That's 180. Then divide by 9. 180 divided by 9 equals 20. So the Celsius temperature should be 20°C.

Looking at the options, option F is 20°C. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a second. I've heard that sometimes people approximate, like using 30/1.8 or something. Let me check my calculation again to be sure. 68°F is a common room temperature, right? I think it's like 20°C. Yeah, 20°C is about room temperature, so that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think of known values. For example, 32°F is 0°C, and 212°F is 100°C. So 68 is somewhere in between. 50°F is about 10°C, so adding 18 more degrees (from 50 to 68) should add about 10 more Celsius degrees because the scale is smaller. Wait, 18 times 5/9 is 10, so 10 + 10 is 20. That checks out.

So yeah, I'm confident the answer is F, 20°C.

The conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius uses the formula: 

\[ C = \frac{5}{9} \times (F - 32) \]

For \( F = 68 \):

1. Subtract 32: \( 68 - 32 = 36 \)
2. Multiply by \( \frac{5}{9} \): \( 36 \times \frac{5}{9} = 20 \)

Thus, 68°F corresponds to 20°C. Among the options, 20°C is option F.

Answer: F
