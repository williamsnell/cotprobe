Okay, so I've got this problem here about a pizza parlor offering 8 different toppings, and I need to figure out how many ways a customer can order a pizza with 3 toppings. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the key here is that the order of the toppings doesn't matter, right? Like, having mushrooms, pepperoni, and onions is the same as onions, mushrooms, pepperoni. So it's a combination problem, not a permutation.

Wait, combinations are when the order doesn't matter, and permutations are when it does. So since the pizza toppings are just a group without caring about the sequence, combinations are the way to go.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So in this case, n is 8 toppings, and k is 3.

Let me plug in the numbers. C(8,3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!). Simplifying that, 8-3 is 5, so it's 8!/(3!5!).

Wait, but 8! is a big number. Maybe I can simplify it before calculating. 8! is 8 × 7 × 6 × 5! So 8! = 8×7×6×5! So when I write the combination formula, the 5! in the denominator and numerator will cancel out. Oh right, so it becomes (8×7×6) / (3×2×1). 

Let me compute that. 8×7 is 56, 56×6 is 336. Then the denominator is 3×2×1 = 6. So 336 divided by 6 is... 56? No, wait, 6 times 56 is 336. Oh wait, no, 56 times 6 is 336. So 336 divided by 6 is 56. So the answer would be 56.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate. 8×7 is 56, ×6 is 336. Divided by 6 is indeed 56. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option A is 56. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the number of ways a customer can order a pizza with 3 toppings out of 8, we use combinations since the order of toppings does not matter. The formula for combinations is:

\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n - k)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 3 \). Plugging in the values:

\[
C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3! \cdot (8 - 3)!} = \frac{8!}{3! \cdot 5!}
\]

Simplifying further, \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5! \), so:

\[
C(8, 3) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5!}{3! \cdot 5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56
\]

Thus, the number of ways to choose 3 toppings out of 8 is 56. The correct answer is:

A: 56
