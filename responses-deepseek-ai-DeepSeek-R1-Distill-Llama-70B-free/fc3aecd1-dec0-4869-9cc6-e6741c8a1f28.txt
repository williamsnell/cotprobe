Okay, so I've got this question about creditor-debtor law, specifically dealing with agreements to discharge a debt. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The scenario is that a creditor loaned his friend $15,000 for college tuition. Six months later, the friend lost his job and couldn't repay. The creditor sends a letter offering to discharge the $15,000 debt if the friend delivers an autographed baseball bat by August 1. The friend accepts over the phone. The question is what kind of agreement this creates.

I remember that when dealing with debts, there are a few key concepts: accord, satisfaction, novation, substituted agreements, etc. Let me think about each option.

First, the creditor's offer is to accept something other than the original debt payment. Normally, the friend owes money, but now the creditor is willing to take a baseball bat instead. So it's a substitute performance.

Accord and satisfaction usually refers to a situation where the parties agree to substitute a different performance, and the new performance is done, which then discharges the original debt. However, I think accord is the agreement to accept something else, and satisfaction is the actual performance. So in this case, the creditor's letter is an offer for an accord. The friend's acceptance would create an accord, but until the bat is delivered, there's no satisfaction yet.

Wait, but the question is about the friend's verbal acceptance. So when the friend accepted the offer verbally, they agreed to the terms. So at that point, is it an executory accord or something else?

I'm a bit confused about the terminology. Let me think about the types of accords. There's unilateral and bilateral. A unilateral accord is when one party makes a promise to do something, and the other just needs to perform. In this case, the creditor is making a promise to discharge the debt if the friend delivers the bat. The friend's acceptance is a promise to deliver the bat. So both are making promises—so it's a bilateral agreement. Wait, or is it?

Wait no, the creditor is offering to discharge the debt upon delivery. So the friend's acceptance is a promise to perform, but the creditor is not making a new promise. The creditor is just conditionally promising to discharge the debt. So the creditor isn't promising to do anything beyond what's already in the original debt. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to look at it.

Alternatively, an accord requires mutual promises. So the creditor is promising to accept the bat in place of the $15,000, and the friend is promising to deliver the bat. So that's a mutual agreement. So that would make it a bilateral executory accord, which would be option F.

But wait, another possibility: a substituted compromise agreement. I'm not entirely sure what that refers to. I think a compromise is when the parties settle a dispute by each giving up something, but here, the creditor is just accepting a different form of payment, so it's more of an accord than a compromise.

Another angle: in a novation, a new contract substitutes for an old one, usually with a new party or changing terms. Here, the new agreement doesn't involve a new party; it's just a different way to pay, so novation (option D) doesn't seem right.

Debt recovery agreement (B) doesn't fit because that's more about collecting the debt, not substituting it.

Mortgage agreement (E) is about using property as security, which isn't the case here.

Unenforceable promise (H) is unlikely because the agreement is about substituting performance, which is a valid contract concept.

Mutual satisfaction (G) would come into play if both parties had performed, but here the question is about the agreement itself, not the performance.

Creditor-debtor agreement (I) is a general term, but the question is looking for the specific type.

So putting it all together, when the creditor offers to take the bat instead of cash, and the friend accepts, they form an executory accord. Since both are making promises (the creditor to discharge the debt upon delivery, and the friend to deliver the bat), it's a bilateral executory accord. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but some sources say that an executory accord is when the parties agree to perform; the actual discharge happens upon performance. So in this case, the agreement is executory because the performance (delivery of the bat) hasn't happened yet. So yes, it's a bilateral executory accord, which is option F.

Wait, but another thought: the creditor's offer is to discharge the debt upon delivery. The friend's acceptance is a promise to deliver. So it's a contract where each party's obligation is based on the other's performance. So it's a bilateral contract, making it a bilateral executory accord.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is F.

The question revolves around a creditor offering to discharge a $15,000 debt in exchange for an autographed baseball bat, with the friend verbally accepting the offer. The key issue is determining the legal nature of this agreement.

The creditor's letter constitutes an offer to accept a substitute performance (the baseball bat) in place of the original monetary debt. The friend's verbal acceptance creates a mutual agreement where the creditor promises to discharge the debt upon delivery of the bat, and the friend promises to deliver the bat. This mutual exchange of promises defines the agreement as a type of accord.

An **accord** is an agreement to substitute a different performance in place of the original obligation. In this case, the creditor agrees to accept the baseball bat instead of the $15,000, and the friend agrees to deliver the bat. Since both parties are making promises, this is a **bilateral executory accord**. A bilateral executory accord is characterized by mutual promises, where performance is still in the future (the bat has not yet been delivered).

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Substituted compromise agreement** — A compromise typically involves settling a dispute by each party giving up something, which is not the case here. This is more about substituting performance, not compromising a dispute.
- **B: Debt recovery agreement** — This does not fit, as the agreement is about substituting performance, not recovering the debt.
- **C: Accord and satisfaction** — Satisfaction refers to the act of performing the agreed-upon substitute, which has not yet occurred here.
- **D: Novation** — A novation involves replacing an old obligation with a new one, often involving a new party, which is not applicable here.
- **E: Mortgage agreement** — This involves using property as security, which is irrelevant to this scenario.
- **F: Bilateral executory accord** — Correct, as both parties have made mutual promises, and performance is still in the future.
- **G: Mutual satisfaction agreement** — Satisfaction refers to the completion of performance, which has not happened yet.
- **H: Unenforceable promise** — The agreement is valid under contract law, so this is incorrect.
- **I: Creditor-debtor agreement** — This is a general term and does not specify the type of agreement.
- **J: Unilateral executory accord** — Incorrect, as both parties are making promises, making it bilateral.

The correct answer is **F: a bilateral executory accord**, as the mutual promises create an agreement where performance is still pending.

Answer: F
