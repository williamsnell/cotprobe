The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the singing and chanting of songs from 1:00P. M. to 1:00A. M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, "We're number 1. . . we're number 1. " One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?

Options:

A: The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.
B: The ordinance is unjust as it discriminates against those who are not religious.
C: The ordinance is not fair because it only applies to two or more persons, thus single individuals can create noise without consequence.
D: The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.
E: The ordinance directly contradicts the students' right to celebrate their college's victory.
F: The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.
G: The ordinance is biased against persons who can't sing or chant religious songs.
H: The ordinance is invalid as it fails to consider the cultural importance of chanting and singing in a group.
I: The ordinance is not applicable because it was after a football game, a special occasion.
J: The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with First Amendment issues and equal protection. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a city ordinance that prohibits singing and chanting by two or more persons if the noise is audible off the premises. The ordinance is in effect from 1 PM to 1 AM. But there's an exemption for religious songs. Some college students were chanting "We're number 1" after a football game, which disturbed a resident. They were arrested under this ordinance and now are challenging its constitutionality.

The question asks which argument would be the weakest for the students. So I need to evaluate each option and determine which is the least likely to succeed in court.

Let's start by understanding the ordinance. It's targeting noise made by two or more people during certain hours. It specifically exempts religious singing. So the issue here is likely about content-based restrictions on speech and equal protection.

First Amendment analysis: The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction if it's based on the time and place, but the exemption for religious songs might make it content-based. Content-based laws are subject to strict scrutiny, requiring the government to show a compelling interest and that the law is narrowly tailored.

Alternatively, if the court finds it's content-neutral, then the test is intermediate scrutiny, requiring the law to be substantially related to an important government interest and not burden more speech than necessary.

But the exemption for religious songs could be problematic because it treats religious speech differently, which might violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Now looking at the options:

A: Argues the ordinance isn't related to a legitimate community interest. Well, reducing noise is a legitimate interest, so this is probably a weak argument. Cities often have noise ordinances, so the students would likely lose on this point.

B: Claims the ordinance is unjust because it discriminates against non-religious. This touches on equal protection but is phrased more as an argument about fairness rather than a legal doctrine. Maybe not the strongest, but not necessarily the weakest.

C: Points out it only applies to two or more persons. So single individuals can make noise. This could be a due process or equal protection argument, but it's about the scope of the restriction. It's a valid point, but perhaps not the weakest.

D: Argues equal protection by distinguishing religious from other singing. This seems strong because the ordinance treats religious and non-religious differently without a clear justification, which could be an equal protection violation.

E: Says it contradicts the right to celebrate. I don't think the Constitution guarantees a right to celebrate in this manner, so this argument is likely weak. The right to free expression is broader, but just celebrating isn't a specific right.

F: Claims it violates freedom of expression under the First Amendment. This is a strong argument because it's about content-based restriction. So this would be a solid argument, not weak.

G: Argues bias against those who can't sing religious songs. Not sure, but perhaps similar to D. It's about unequal treatment based on the content.

H: Talks about cultural importance of group chanting. This might be a policy argument but not a strong legal argument. Courts might not give much weight to cultural importance over a legitimate noise ordinance.

I: Says the ordinance doesn't apply because it was after a football game, a special occasion. I don't think the timing after a game would exempt them unless the ordinance has exceptions, which it doesn't mention. So this is a weak argument.

J: Argues the language is vague and overbroad. Vagueness and overbreadth are valid challenges. If the ordinance is too broad, it might chill protected speech. But if it's specific about time, place, and number of people, maybe it's not too vague. But overbreadth could be an issue.

Now, the question is which is the weakest argument. Let's evaluate each.

Option E says the ordinance contradicts the right to celebrate. The problem is that the Constitution doesn't recognize a specific right to celebrate in a noisy way. The students' chanting is a form of expression, but E frames it as a right to celebrate, which isn't a direct constitutional right. So this argument is weak because it misstates the legal issue.

Option I argues that the ordinance doesn't apply because it was a special occasion. Unless the ordinance has a specific exemption for such events, which it doesn't, this argument is weak. The ordinance applies regardless of the reason for the chanting.

Between E and I, which is weaker? I think E is weaker because it's based on a non-existent right. Option I might have a slightly better basis if they argue about selective enforcement or some exception, but the question doesn't mention that. Alternatively, the ordinance's applicability isn't tied to the reason for the gathering, so I's argument is weak.

Wait, the options are about the weakest argument the students would make. Let me think again.

Option A: The ordinance isn't related to a community interest. But reducing noise is a legitimate interest, so this argument is weak. The students would lose on this because the city does have a legitimate interest in noise control.

So comparing A, E, I.

A is a due process argument without a legitimate interest. Since the city does have an interest, this is a weak argument.

E is a made-up right, which is weaker than A because at least A relates to due process.

Wait, but due process under the 14th Amendment requires that laws be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. So if the students argue that the law isn't related to any interest, but the city has a noise interest, this argument would fail. So A is a weak argument.

So which is weaker: A or E?

A says the ordinance isn't related to any legitimate interest, which is false. E says it's a right to celebrate, which isn't a recognized right. So both are weak, but I think E is weaker because it's based on a non-existent specific right.

Alternatively, the weakest argument would be the one that's easiest for the court to dismiss. Arguing that there's no legitimate interest (A) is easier to dismiss because the court will recognize noise as a valid interest. Arguing a right to celebrate (E) is a misstatement, so perhaps E is weaker.

Alternatively, let me see the answer options. The question asks which is the weakest argument against the ordinance.

The weakest argument would be the one that's clearly incorrect or has no legal basis.

Option E: The ordinance directly contradicts the students' right to celebrate their college's victory. There's no such right in the Constitution. Celebrating is a form of expression, but not a specific right that would override a noise ordinance. So this argument is weak because it's based on a non-existent right.

Option I: The ordinance is not applicable because it was after a football game, a special occasion. Unless the ordinance includes exceptions, this is irrelevant. The timing of the event (after a game) doesn't make the ordinance inapplicable. So this is a weak argument.

Between E and I, E is weaker because the right to celebrate isn't a recognized legal argument.

Wait, but another thought: Option F is a strong argument because it's about First Amendment freedoms. The question is about the weakest argument. So the weakest would be E or I.

But looking back, the question gives options, and the weakest is the one that's least likely to succeed.

Option E is about a right to celebrate, which is not a strong legal argument. Option I is about applicability after a game, which might not be a valid exception.

Alternatively, Option E is not about any legal doctrine but a made-up right. So that's the weakest.

Wait, but let me check all options again.

Option D: Equal protection by distinguishing between religious and non-religious. This is a strong argument because the ordinance treats religious and non-religious differently, which could be an Equal Protection violation unless the city has a compelling reason.

Option F: Freedom of expression. Strong argument, as it's about content-based restriction.

Option G: Bias against those who can't sing religious songs. Similar to D, but perhaps less precise.

So the weakest arguments would be those that are not based on solid legal principles.

So, the options that are weak are:

A: No legitimate interest (likely incorrect because noise is a valid interest).

B: Unjust discrimination (more of a moral argument, not a legal one).

C: Applies only to two or more (could be an equal protection argument, but not the strongest).

E: Right to celebrate (non-existent right).

I: Special occasion (no legal basis).

So, the weakest would be E or I.

I think E is weaker because it's based on a non-existent right. So the answer is E.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

E: The ordinance directly contradicts the students' right to celebrate their college's victory.

This is a very weak argument because there's no constitutional right to celebrate in a way that disturbs the peace. The First Amendment protects expression, but not all forms of celebration. So challenging based on a right to celebrate is not a strong argument.

Alternatively, the weakest argument is E because it's based on a right that doesn't exist.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The question involves a constitutional challenge to a city ordinance that prohibits singing and chanting by two or more persons during specific hours, with an exemption for religious songs. The students argue that the ordinance is unconstitutional, and the task is to identify their weakest argument.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

- **A**: Argues the ordinance is unrelated to any legitimate community interest. This is weak because reducing noise is a legitimate government interest, and courts generally recognize noise ordinances as serving this purpose.

- **B**: Claims the ordinance is unjust because it discriminates against non-religious individuals. While this touches on fairness, it is more of a moral argument and less precise legally.

- **C**: Points out the ordinance applies only to two or more persons. This could raise equal protection concerns but is not the weakest argument.

- **D**: Argues the ordinance violates equal protection by distinguishing between religious and non-religious singing. This is a strong argument because the exemption for religious songs could be seen as impermissible content-based discrimination.

- **E**: Claims the ordinance contradicts the students' right to celebrate their college's victory. This is very weak because there is no specific constitutional right to celebrate in a manner that disturbs the peace. The First Amendment protects expression, but not all forms of celebration.

- **F**: Argues the ordinance violates freedom of expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This is a strong argument as it challenges the content-based restriction on speech.

- **G**: Argues bias against those who cannot sing religious songs. Similar to D but less precise.

- **H**: Talks about cultural importance of group chanting. This is a policy argument and not a strong legal basis.

- **I**: Argues the ordinance does not apply because it was after a football game, a special occasion. This is weak because the ordinance does not exempt special occasions unless explicitly stated.

- **J**: Argues the ordinance is vague and overbroad. While vagueness and overbreadth are valid challenges, the ordinance seems specific enough to avoid this criticism.

### Conclusion:
The weakest argument is **E**, as it is based on a non-existent constitutional right to celebrate. Courts are unlikely to recognize such a right, making this argument the least likely to succeed. While **I** is also weak, **E** is weaker because it misstates the legal issue entirely.
