Okay, so I've got this question about wills and estates, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see. The question is about Mary, a widow from St. Petersburg, who made her will on May 15, 1990, and died on August 18, 1990. Her will says her estate is to be divided equally between her only child, Joan, and the Salvation Army of Largo.

Hmm, the question is asking how the estate will actually be distributed. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that when a person dies, their will dictates how the estate is divided, assuming it's valid. But wait, there's something about the timing here. She made the will in May and died in August of the same year. So, that's about three months later. Does the time between making the will and death affect anything? I don't think so. The will is valid if it was properly executed, regardless of how soon after she died.

Now, the will says the estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. So, that would mean each gets 50%. So, at first glance, the straightforward answer would be F: 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army.

But wait, are there any other factors that might change this? I recall something about a spouse's right to elect against the will, but Mary is a widow, so she doesn't have a spouse. Also, Joan is her only child. Are there any laws that protect children from being disinherited? Like, some states have laws where a child can challenge the will if they're not adequately provided for.

So, in this case, Joan is getting 50% of the estate. Is that considered adequate? Or can she choose to take a certain share instead? I think in some places, children can take a portion of the estate regardless of the will, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Wait, the question mentions that Mary is a wealthy widow. So, the estate is probably significant. If Joan is the only child, under intestacy laws, she might be entitled to a certain percentage, maybe more than 50%. Let me think. In many jurisdictions, if the deceased has a spouse and one child, the spouse gets a certain share, and the child gets the rest. But since Mary is a widow, her estate would go to her children. If there's more than one child, they'd split it, but since Joan is the only child, she would get everything under intestacy. But Mary made a will leaving half to Joan and half to charity.

So, can Joan challenge the will to get more? I think she can, but I'm not sure. Some states have a "pretermitted heir" statute, which might apply if a child is left out or not adequately provided for. But in this case, Joan is not left out; she's getting half. So, whether she can challenge depends on whether the will's provision is considered adequate.

Another angle is that if the will was properly executed, Joan might not have grounds to challenge it unless there's evidence of undue influence or lack of capacity. The question doesn't mention any of that, so I think we can assume the will is valid.

So, if the will is valid and properly executed, then the distribution should be as per the will. That would mean each gets 50%. But wait, looking at the options, option F is exactly that. So, that would be the answer.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure. Option D says 100% to Joan if she files a petition to avoid the Salvation Army's share. I don't think that's correct because the Salvation Army is a charity and a valid beneficiary. Unless Joan can prove some impropriety, the will's terms should stand.

Option E is about a trust, but the will didn't mention a trust. It just divided the estate equally, so the straightforward split applies.

Option G says 100% to Joan, which would happen only if the will was invalid or if Joan successfully challenges it, but the question doesn't give any reason to think that's the case.

So, I think the correct answer is F: 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army.

The question involves the distribution of Mary's estate based on her will, which leaves her estate equally between her only child, Joan, and the Salvation Army of Largo. Mary executed the will on May 15, 1990, and died on August 18, 1990. The key issue is whether the will's terms will be upheld or if Joan can challenge the distribution.

Under the will, the estate is divided 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army. The will is valid as there is no indication of improper execution, undue influence, or lack of capacity. While Joan, as Mary's only child, might have rights under intestacy laws (which would grant her the entire estate in the absence of a will), the will explicitly provides for an equal split. There is no evidence that Joan is inadequate
