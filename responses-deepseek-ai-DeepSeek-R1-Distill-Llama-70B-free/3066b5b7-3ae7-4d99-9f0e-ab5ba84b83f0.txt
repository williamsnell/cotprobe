Question:

A developer wished to build an apartment house in a local city. He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. Loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per month, starting one month after the completion of the apartment house. The loan is to be secured by a mortgage on the property. "The developer then contracted with a construction company to build the apartment for $800,000. After the contract was signed and construction had begun, the developer asked the investor when he would be receiving the $100,000 the investor promised to lend him. The investor replied, "I've changed my mind. I think this is too risky an investment. I'm not going to lend you the money. "In an appropriate action to secure specific performance of the investor's promise to lend him the $100,000, the developer will

Options:

A: win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.
B: win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.
C: lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.
D: lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.

Okay, so I have this legal question to tackle, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.

So, there's a developer who wants to build an apartment house. He raised $1 million initially but couldn't find a vacant lot, so he bought a developed lot for $200k and spent another $50k to remove the existing structure. The total cost to build the apartment is about $850k. But he's short by $100k, so he approaches an investor. 

The investor agrees to lend him $100k at 5% interest within 30 days, but there's a condition: the developer must contract with a construction company for no more than $850k. They sign a written agreement. The loan is secured by a mortgage on the property, and repayments start after the apartment is completed.

Then, the developer contracts with a construction company for $800k, which is under the $850k limit. Construction begins, and the developer asks the investor for the $100k. But the investor backs out, saying it's too risky.

Now, the developer is suing for specific performance to get the $100k. The question is whether he'll win.

Hmm, so I need to think about the legal principles here. Specific performance is an equitable remedy, usually granted when monetary damages aren't sufficient. It's often awarded for breach of contract when the subject matter is unique, like real estate.

Looking at the agreement, it's in writing, which is good because contracts involving land usually need to be in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The agreement mentions a mortgage on the property, so it's tied to real estate. That should satisfy the Statute of Frauds because it's a written memorandum signed by the party to be charged (the investor).

Wait, does the Statute of Frauds apply here? The loan is secured by a mortgage on the property, which is real estate. So yes, any contract that involves an interest in land needs to be in writing. The written agreement here seems to satisfy that.

Now, can the developer get specific performance? Specific performance is typically available when the legal remedy (like damages) isn't adequate. In real estate deals, the property is often considered unique, so specific performance is granted. But here, the subject is a loan, not the sale of the property itself. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the loan is secured by a mortgage. So the contract isn't just about lending money; it's about granting a mortgage on real property. That might make the contract fall under the Statute of Frauds, which it does because it's in writing.

But the issue is whether specific performance is appropriate. The developer wants the investor to lend the money. The investor is refusing. So, can the court compel the investor to make the loan?

I remember that specific performance is more common in cases where the contract is for the sale of land. For example, if I contract to buy a house and the seller backs out, I can sue for specific performance. But for a loan, it's a bit different. Loans can often be replaced with other loans, so specific performance might not be granted because the remedy at law (damages) is adequate.

So, even though the agreement is in writing and satisfies the Statute of Frauds, the court might not grant specific performance because money is considered a substitute. Unless the loan has some unique terms that can't be replicated, the developer might just have to sue for damages instead.

Looking at the options, option A says the developer will win because there's a memorandum satisfying the Statute of Frauds. But just satisfying the Statute of Frauds doesn't automatically mean specific performance is available. The question is about the adequacy of the remedy. 

Option B says he'll win because land is unique, making legal remedy inadequate. But the contract here is about a loan, not the sale of land. The uniqueness of the property might not directly apply here because the loan is separate from the land's sale.

Option C says he'll lose because his only remedy is damages. That makes sense if the court doesn't see specific performance as necessary. 

Option D says he'll lose because he can't show detrimental reliance. Wait, detrimental reliance is more relevant to promissory estoppel, not specific performance. The developer did rely by entering into the construction contract, but specific performance isn't based on reliance but on the adequacy of the remedy.

So, putting it together: The agreement is enforceable because it's in writing and satisfies the Statute of Frauds. However, specific performance is discretionary. Courts are usually reluctant to order specific performance for money loans because money is fungible, and damages can compensate. Therefore, the developer's remedy would be in damages, not specific performance. So the answer is C.

The developer is seeking specific performance to compel the investor to lend $100,000 under a written agreement. The agreement is secured by a mortgage on real property, satisfying the Statute of Frauds. However, specific performance is typically granted when the legal remedy (such as damages) is inadequate, often in cases involving unique property or goods. Here, the subject of the contract is a loan, and money is generally considered fungible, meaning damages are an adequate remedy. While the agreement is enforceable, courts are reluctant to order specific performance for loans because the developer can likely obtain alternative financing. Therefore, the developerâ€™s remedy lies in damages, not specific performance.

The correct answer is:

C: lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.
