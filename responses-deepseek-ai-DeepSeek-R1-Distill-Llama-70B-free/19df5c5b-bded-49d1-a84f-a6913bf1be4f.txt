Okay, so I've got this problem here about gas pressure and volume. Hmm, I remember from chemistry class that when temperature is constant, the pressure and volume of a gas are related by Boyle's Law. Boyle's Law says that P1 times V1 equals P2 times V2. Right, so P1V1 = P2V2.

The problem is asking what pressure is needed to compress 5 liters of gas at 1 atm to 1 liter. So let me break that down. The initial volume V1 is 5 liters, and the initial pressure P1 is 1 atm. The final volume V2 is 1 liter, and we're looking for the final pressure P2.

Plugging the values into the equation: P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. So that's 1 atm * 5 L = P2 * 1 L. 

Wait, so 5 atm times liter equals P2 times 1 liter. Oh wait, actually, the liters would cancel out since they're on both sides. So the equation simplifies to 5 atm = P2. 

So P2 should be 5 atm. Let me double-check the options. Option C is 5 atm. That makes sense. 

I think that's it. Boyle's Law is straightforward when temperature is constant. So the answer should be C.

To determine the pressure required to compress 5 liters of gas at 1 atm to 1 liter at constant temperature, we use Boyle's Law, which states:

\[
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
\]

Here, \(P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm}\), \(V_1 = 5 \, \text{L}\), and \(V_2 = 1 \, \text{L}\). Substituting these values:

\[
1 \, \text{atm} \times 5 \, \text{L} = P_2 \times 1 \, \text{L}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
P_2 = 5 \, \text{atm}
\]

Thus, the pressure required is 5 atm. The correct answer is:

**C**
