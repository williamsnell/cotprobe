Okay, so I'm trying to solve this equation: x + 2.7 equals 8.4. Hmm, algebra can be a bit tricky sometimes, but I think I remember how to handle this. Let me see... The equation is x plus 2.7, so to find x, I need to get it by itself on one side. That means I should subtract 2.7 from both sides to isolate x.

Wait, right, if I subtract 2.7 from both sides, that would cancel out the 2.7 on the left. So, x plus 2.7 minus 2.7 equals 8.4 minus 2.7. Let me do that calculation. 8.4 minus 2.7... Hmm, 8 minus 2 is 6, and 0.4 minus 0.7 would be -0.3. So 6 minus 0.3 is 5.7. So x should be 5.7.

Now I need to look at the options provided. Let's see, the options are A through J. Option A is 5.7, which matches what I got. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, 8.4 minus 2.7. Let me write it down. 8.4 minus 2 is 6.4, and then minus 0.7. So 6.4 minus 0.7 is 5.7. Yep, that's correct. So x is definitely 5.7, which is option A. I don't think I made any errors here. So I'm confident the answer is A.

To solve the equation \( x + 2.7 = 8.4 \), we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 2.7 from both sides:

\[
x = 8.4 - 2.7
\]

Performing the subtraction:

\[
x = 5.7
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **A: 5.7**.
