Question:

A homeowner entered into a written contract with a house painter to have his house painted for $10,000. The contract stated in part: "It is agreed that the house painter will paint the house using off-white latex paint, and will finish the job within 30 days from the execution of this agreement. If the homeowner finds the completed job to be satisfactory, he will pay the house painter $10,000 within one week after the job is completed. "Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the homeowner's contractual obligation to pay the house painter $10,000?

Options:

A: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition subsequent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.
B: The performances of the homeowner and the house painter were, in essence, concurrent conditions.
C: The performances of the homeowner and the house painter were, in essence, independent conditions.
D: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be a concurrent condition to the house painter's duty of performance.
E: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.
F: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.
G: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
H: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job is an implied condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
I: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job would be an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
J: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job is an implied condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.

Okay, so I've got this contracts question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to understand the scenario first.

A homeowner and a house painter have a written contract. The painter agrees to paint the house using off-white latex paint and finish within 30 days. The payment is $10,000, but the homeowner will pay only if he finds the job satisfactory, and he must pay within a week after completion.

The question is about the homeowner's obligation to pay. I need to determine which of the options A to J correctly describes their contractual obligations in terms of conditions.

Hmm, I remember that in contract law, conditions can be precedent, concurrent, or subsequent. 

A condition precedent is something that must happen before a party's duty arises. So, if X is a condition precedent to Y, Y doesn't have to do their part until X happens.

Concurrent conditions are when both parties' obligations are mutually dependent; each is a condition of the other. Like, I do this, you do that, and we exchange performances simultaneously.

Independent conditions don't depend on each other. Each party's obligation is a condition to the other's, but they don't have to happen at the same time or in any particular order. Wait, no, actually, in contracts, conditions are usually either concurrent or independent. Or maybe it's between conditions precedent and subsequent.

Wait, in this case, the house painter must perform first. The painter paints the house within 30 days, and after the job is done, the homeowner has a week to pay if satisfied.

So the payment is dependent on the painter completing the job satisfactory. So the painter's performance is a condition precedent to the homeowner's payment. Because the homeowner doesn't have to pay until the painter has done the work, and the work is satisfactory.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option E says the house painter's performance is an express condition precedent to the homeowner's payment. That sounds right because the payment is only due after satisfactory completion.

Option A says the painter's performance is a condition subsequent. That would mean the homeowner has a duty to pay first, and the condition subsequent would allow him to withhold if the painter didn't perform. But I don't think that's the case here. The payment is conditioned on the painter completing and the homeowner being satisfied.

Option C says their performances are independent conditions. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Independent conditions are when each party's obligation is a condition to the other's, but in a way where one doesn't need to wait for the other. But in this case, the payment is clearly dependent on the painter's prior performance. So they're not independent; the payment is after the performance.

Option I says the homeowner's satisfaction is an express condition precedent to the painter's duty. Wait, that would mean the painter doesn't have to perform until the homeowner is satisfied, which doesn't make sense. The painter must perform first, and then the homeowner decides. So I think that's the opposite of what's correct.

Wait, the question is about the homeowner's obligation. The contract says if the homeowner finds the job satisfactory, he will pay. So the payment is conditioned on satisfaction, which is a condition precedent. So the painter must perform satisfactorily before the payment is due. Therefore, the painter's performance is a condition precedent to the payment.

Looking back, option E says exactly that. So E is the correct answer.

Wait, what about option B: concurrent conditions. That would mean both parties are to perform at the same time, or their performances are interdependent. But here, the painter's performance comes first, then the payment. So they’re not concurrent. Concurrent conditions would be like exchanging a deed and paying at the same time.

So, the correct answer should be E.

The contract between the homeowner and the house painter specifies that the homeowner will pay $10,000 within one week after the job is completed, provided the homeowner finds the work satisfactory. This indicates that the house painter's performance—painting the house satisfactorily within 30 days—is a prerequisite for the homeowner's obligation to pay. 

In contract law, a condition precedent is an event that must occur before a party's duty arises. Here, the painter's satisfactory performance is explicitly stated as a condition precedent to the homeowner's payment. This means the homeowner is not required to pay until the painter has completed the job to the homeowner's satisfaction.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because it describes the painter's performance as a condition subsequent, which would imply the homeowner's duty to pay arises first, allowing the homeowner to withhold payment if the painter fails to perform. This contradicts the contract terms.
- **Option B** is incorrect because concurrent conditions imply mutual and simultaneous obligations, which is not the case here. The painter must perform first before the homeowner is obligated to pay.
- **Option C** is incorrect because independent conditions suggest each party's obligation is separate and not dependent on the other, which does not align with the payment being explicitly conditioned on satisfactory performance.
- **Option E** is correct because it accurately describes the painter's performance as an express condition precedent to the homeowner's payment, consistent with the contract terms.
- **Option I** is incorrect because it reverses the order of obligations, suggesting the homeowner's satisfaction must occur before the painter's performance, which is not how the contract is structured.

Thus, the most accurate statement is that the house painter's performance under the contract is an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment.
