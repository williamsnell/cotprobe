Okay, so I've got this problem about linear transformations, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The function f is a linear transformation from the plane to the real numbers. Hmm, right, so f takes a vector in R² and maps it to a real number. I remember that linear transformations can be represented as matrix multiplications, but since the output is a single number, the matrix must be a 1x2 matrix. So f is like a dot product with some vector.

Oh wait, right! A linear transformation from R² to R can be written as f(x, y) = ax + by, where a and b are constants. So f is determined by these two coefficients.

The problem gives me two specific values: f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2. I need to find f(3,5). 

So first, I'll set up equations based on the given values. Let's write down what f(1,1) and f(-1,0) would be in terms of a and b.

For f(1,1) = 1:
1*a + 1*b = 1 → a + b = 1.

For f(-1,0) = 2:
-1*a + 0*b = 2 → -a = 2. So solving for a gives a = -2.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Then substitute a back into the first equation. So a = -2, so:

-2 + b = 1 → b = 3.

So now I have a = -2 and b = 3. Therefore, the function f is f(x,y) = (-2)x + 3y.

Now I need to compute f(3,5). Plugging in x=3 and y=5:

f(3,5) = (-2)*3 + 3*5. Let's calculate that. (-6) + 15 = 9. So the answer should be 9.

Looking at the options, option A is 9. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, let me double-check in case I made any mistakes. Let's go over the steps again.

1. f is linear, so f(x,y)=ax + by.
2. Given f(1,1)=1 → a + b = 1.
3. Given f(-1,0)=2 → -a + 0 = 2 → a = -2.
4. Substituting a into a + b =1: -2 + b =1 → b=3.
5. So f(3,5) = (-2)*3 +3*5 = -6 +15 =9.

Yes, everything checks out. So the answer is A:9.

To determine \( f(3, 5) \), we start by recognizing that \( f \) is a linear transformation from \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) to \( \mathbb{R} \), which can be expressed as \( f(x, y) = ax + by \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. 

Given:
- \( f(1, 1) = 1 \): Substituting into \( f(x, y) = ax + by \), we get:
  \[
  a(1) + b(1) = 1 \implies a + b = 1.
  \]
- \( f(-1, 0) = 2 \): Substituting into \( f(x, y) = ax + by \), we get:
  \[
  a(-1) + b(0) = 2 \implies -a = 2 \implies a = -2.
  \]

Using \( a = -2 \) in the first equation \( a + b = 1 \), we solve for \( b \):
\[
-2 + b = 1 \implies b = 3.
\]

Thus, the function is \( f(x, y) = -2x + 3y \). Now, we compute \( f(3, 5) \):
\[
f(3, 5) = -2(3) + 3(5) = -6 + 15 = 9.
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 9**.
