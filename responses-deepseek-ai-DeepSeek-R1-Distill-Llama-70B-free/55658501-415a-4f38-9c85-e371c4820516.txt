Okay, so I've got this problem here about expected value, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see... The setup is that we have a sequence of random variables X1, X2, and so on, each chosen uniformly and independently between 0 and 1. Then there's this sum S defined as the sum from i=1 to k of Xi divided by 2^i. The value of k is the smallest positive integer such that Xk is less than Xk+1, or infinity if no such integer exists. The task is to find the expected value of S.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to understand what k represents here. It's the first index where Xk < Xk+1. So, the sequence is being checked for the first time when a term is less than the next one. If that never happens, k is infinity, but I think in reality, the probability that it never happens is zero because the variables are independent and continuous, so the chance that Xk < Xk+1 never occurs is negligible. So, we can probably ignore that case for expectation purposes.

So, S is a sum that stops at the first k where Xk < Xk+1. So, for each i from 1 to k, we add Xi/(2^i). The expectation of S would then be the sum of the expectations of each term, because expectation is linear. So, E[S] = sum_{i=1}^k E[Xi / 2^i]. But wait, k is a random variable here because it depends on where the first Xk < Xk+1 occurs.

This complicates things because the number of terms in the sum is itself a random variable. So, I can't just compute the expectation term by term as I would for a fixed k. Instead, I have to consider the probability distribution of k and sum accordingly.

So, perhaps I should model this by considering the probability that k takes a particular value n. That is, for each n=1,2,3,..., compute the probability P(k=n), and then compute E[S] as the sum over n=1 to infinity of E[S | k=n] * P(k=n).

Wait, E[S | k=n] would be the sum from i=1 to n of E[Xi / 2^i] because, given k=n, the sum stops at n. Since each Xi is independent and uniform on [0,1], E[Xi] = 1/2 for each i. So, E[Xi / 2^i] = 1/(2^{i+1}).

So, E[S | k=n] is sum_{i=1}^n 1/(2^{i+1}) ) = sum_{i=2}^{n+1} 1/2^i ). Wait, because when i=1, 1/(2^{2}) = 1/4, which is 1/(2^2).

But wait, sum_{i=2}^{n+1} 1/2^i is a finite geometric series. The sum from i=2 to m is (1/2^2) + (1/2^3) + ... + (1/2^m) = (1/4)(1 - (1/2)^{m-1}) ) / (1 - 1/2) )? Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

The sum from i=2 to n+1 of 1/2^i is equal to sum_{i=1}^{n+1} 1/2^i - 1/2^1. The sum from i=1 to m of 1/2^i is 1 - 1/2^m, so substituting m = n+1, we get 1 - 1/2^{n+1} - 1/2 = (1 - 1/2) - 1/2^{n+1} = 1/2 - 1/2^{n+1}.

So, E[S | k=n] = 1/2 - 1/2^{n+1}.

Thus, E[S] = sum_{n=1}^\infty [1/2 - 1/2^{n+1}] * P(k=n).

Now, I need to find P(k=n) for each n. Since k is the first index where Xk < Xk+1, that means that for the first n-1 terms, each X_i >= X_{i+1}, and then Xn < X_{n+1}.

Wait, no. Actually, k is the first n where Xn < X_{n+1}. So, for k = n, we must have that X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn-1 >= Xn, and then Xn < Xn+1.

Wait, no. Wait, if k is the first n where Xn < Xn+1, then for all m < n, Xm >= Xm+1, and then Xn < Xn+1.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If k is the first index where Xk < X_{k+1}, then for all m < k, Xm >= X_{m+1}, and Xk < X_{k+1}.

So, for each n >=1, P(k=n) is the probability that X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn and Xn < X_{n+1}.

So, to compute P(k=n), I need the probability that the first n variables are in non-increasing order, and that the nth is less than the (n+1)th.

But wait, since all variables are independent, the probability that X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn is 1/n! because all possible orderings of X1 to Xn are equally likely, and only one ordering is non-increasing. Similarly, the probability that Xn < X_{n+1} is 1/2 because Xn and X_{n+1} are independent and uniform, so the probability that Xn < X_{n+1} is 1/2.

Wait, but are these events independent? Because the first n variables being non-increasing is one event, and then Xn < X_{n+1} is another, but they're dependent because Xn is part of both.

So, perhaps I need to compute the joint probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as P(k=n) = P(X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn) * P(Xn < X_{n+1} | X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn}).

So, the first term is 1/n! as before, because for the first n variables, the probability that they are in non-increasing order is 1/n!.

Then, given that X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn, what is the probability that Xn < X_{n+1}?

Since X_{n+1} is independent of the first n variables, which have been arranged in non-increasing order, the distribution of Xn is the distribution of the minimum of n uniform variables on [0,1], which is Beta distributed. Specifically, the minimum of n iid uniform [0,1] variables has pdf f(x) = n(1 - x)^{n-1}.

Wait, no. Wait, the maximum of n uniform variables has pdf f(x) = n x^{n-1}, because it's the nth order statistic. The minimum would have pdf f(x) = n(1 - x)^{n-1} for x in [0,1].

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The maximum is the nth order statistic, and its pdf is n x^{n-1}. The minimum is the first order statistic, and its pdf is n(1 - x)^{n-1}.

So, given that X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn, Xn is the minimum of the first n variables, so its distribution is f_{Xn}(x) = n(1 - x)^{n-1} dx.

Therefore, the probability that Xn < X_{n+1} is the expectation over Xn of the probability that X_{n+1} > Xn.

Since X_{n+1} is uniform [0,1], given Xn = x, the probability that X_{n+1} > x is 1 - x.

Thus, P(Xn < X_{n+1} | X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn) = E[1 - Xn] where Xn is distributed as the minimum of n uniform variables.

So, E[1 - Xn] = 1 - E[Xn]. Since Xn is the minimum of n uniform variables, E[Xn] = 1/(n+1). Therefore, E[1 - Xn] = 1 - 1/(n+1) = n/(n+1).

Wait, let me check that. The expectation of the minimum of n uniform [0,1] variables is indeed 1/(n+1). So, that's correct.

Therefore, P(k = n) = P(X1 >= X2 >= ... >= Xn) * P(Xn < X_{n+1} | X1 >= ... >= Xn) ) = (1/n!) * (n/(n+1)) ) = n / (n! (n+1)) ).

Wait, let me compute that: 1/n! multiplied by n/(n+1) gives n/(n! (n+1)).

Alternatively, that can be written as 1/( (n+1) (n-1)! ) ), since n! = n*(n-1)!.

So, n/(n! (n+1)) ) = 1/( (n-1)! (n+1) ) ).

Hmm, that's an interesting expression.

So, P(k = n) = 1/( (n+1) (n-1)! ) ) for n >=1.

Wait, let me check for n=1: P(k=1) = 1/(2 * 0! ) = 1/2, which makes sense. Because for n=1, we have X1 < X2, and since X1 and X2 are independent uniforms, the probability that X1 < X2 is 1/2.

Similarly, for n=2: P(k=2) = 1/(3 * 1! ) = 1/3. Because the probability that X1 >= X2 and X2 < X3. Let me see: the probability that X1 >= X2 is 1/2, and then given that, the probability that X2 < X3 is E[1 - X2], where X2 is the minimum of two uniforms, which has expectation 1/(2+1) = 1/3. So, 1/2 * (1 - 1/3) )= 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3, which matches.

So, yes, P(k=n) = 1/( (n+1) (n-1)! ) ) for n >=1.

Wait, but let me confirm for n=3: P(k=3) = 1/(4 * 2! ) = 1/(4*2) )= 1/8.

Let me compute it manually. The probability that X1 >= X2 >= X3 is 1/3! = 1/6. Then, given that, the probability that X3 < X4 is E[1 - X3], where X3 is the minimum of three uniforms, so E[X3] = 1/(3+1) = 1/4. Thus, E[1 - X3] = 3/4. Therefore, P(k=3) = (1/6) * (3/4) )= 1/8, which matches.

Okay, so the formula seems correct.

So, now, E[S] = sum_{n=1}^\infty [1/2 - 1/2^{n+1}] * P(k=n) ) = sum_{n=1}^\infty [1/2 - 1/2^{n+1}] * [1/( (n+1) (n-1)! )) ].

Wait, perhaps we can express this sum in terms of known series or find a generating function.

Alternatively, perhaps we can split the sum into two parts: sum [1/2 * P(k=n) ] minus sum [ (1/2^{n+1}) * P(k=n) ].

So, E[S] = (1/2) sum_{n=1}^\infty P(k=n) ) - sum_{n=1}^\infty (1/2^{n+1}) P(k=n) ).

But sum_{n=1}^\infty P(k=n) is 1, since k must be some finite n with probability 1. So, the first term is 1/2 * 1 = 1/2.

So, E[S] = 1/2 - sum_{n=1}^\infty (1/2^{n+1}) * [1/( (n+1)(n-1)! )) ].

Simplify the second term: sum_{n=1}^\infty (1/2^{n+1}) * [1/( (n+1)(n-1)! )) ].

Let me change variables to make this sum easier. Let m = n+1, so when n=1, m=2, and as n approaches infinity, m approaches infinity.

So, sum becomes sum_{m=2}^\infty [1/2^{m}] * [1/( m ( (m-2)! ) )) ].

Wait, because when n = m-1, then n+1 = m, and (n-1)! = (m-2)!.

Wait, let me check: n = m-1, so n-1 = m-2, so (n-1)! = (m-2)!.

Thus, the sum becomes sum_{m=2}^\infty [1/(2^m)] * [1/( m (m-2)! ) ) ].

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as sum_{m=2}^\infty 1/(2^m m (m-2)! ) ).

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate this expression to relate it to some known series, maybe involving exponentials or something else.

Alternatively, let's see if I can write it in terms of m starting from 0 by adjusting the index.

Wait, let me think. Let me consider m >= 2, so maybe I can change variable to k = m-2, so that k starts from 0.

Let k = m - 2, so m = k + 2. Then, sum becomes sum_{k=0}^\infty [1/(2^{k+2})] * [1/( (k+2) (k)! ) ) ].

So, that's sum_{k=0}^\infty 1/( 2^{k+2} (k+2) k! ) ).

Which can be written as (1/4) sum_{k=0}^\infty [1/( (k+2) k! ) ) ] * (1/2)^k.

Hmm, perhaps this can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral or something similar.

Wait, I know that sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / k! = e^x.

And sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / (k+1)! ) = (e^x -1)/x.

Wait, let me check: sum_{k=0}^\infty x^{k+1}/(k+1)! ) = e^x -1, so sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k/(k+1)! ) = (e^x -1)/x.

Similarly, sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / (k+2)! ) = (e^x -1 -x)/x^2.

But in our case, the denominator is (k+2) *k! = (k+2)! / (k+1) ), since (k+2)! = (k+2)(k+1)k!.

Wait, no, (k+2)! = (k+2)(k+1)k! So, (k+2) k! = (k+2)! / (k+1).

So, 1/( (k+2) k! ) = 1/( (k+2)! / (k+1) ) ) = (k+1)/(k+2)! )

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express 1/(k+2) as an integral. For example, since 1/(k+2) = ∫_{0}^{1} x^{k+1} dx.

So, substituting this into the sum:

sum_{k=0}^\infty [1/(k+2) k! ) ] * (1/2)^k = sum_{k=0}^\infty [ ∫_{0}^{1} x^{k+1} dx ] / (k! ) * (1/2)^k.

Interchanging sum and integral, we get:

∫_{0}^{1} sum_{k=0}^\infty (x^{k+1} ) / (k! ) * (1/2)^k dx.

Which is ∫_{0}^{1} x sum_{k=0}^\infty (x/2)^k /k! dx.

But sum_{k=0}^\infty (x/2)^k /k! = e^{x/2}.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{1} x e^{x/2} dx.

Thus, the sum is equal to ∫_{0}^{1} x e^{x/2} dx.

So, putting it all together, the second term, which is the sum, becomes (1/4) times this integral.

So, let me compute this integral:

∫ x e^{x/2} dx from 0 to1.

Use integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = e^{x/2} dx.

Then, du = dx, and v = 2 e^{x/2}.

So, ∫ x e^{x/2} dx = 2x e^{x/2} - ∫ 2 e^{x/2} dx.

= 2x e^{x/2} - 4 e^{x/2} + C.

Evaluated from 0 to1:

At 1: 2(1)e^{1/2} -4 e^{1/2} = (2 -4)e^{1/2} = (-2)e^{1/2}.
