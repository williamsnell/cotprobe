Question:

The managers of Disney World are considering changing the amount charged on their Humpty Dumpty ride. Presently they charge 25 cents a mile and this results in about 6,000 passengers each day. The managers believe the number of daily passengers will rise by 400 for each 1 cent decrease in the admission charge and drop by 400 for each 1 cent increase. What is the admission charge which maximizes the daily revenue?

Options:

A: 30 cents
B: 22 cents
C: 18 cents
D: 10 cents
E: 12 cents
F: 25 cents
G: 15 cents
H: 35 cents
I: 20 cents
J: 28 cents

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the optimal admission charge for Disney World's Humpty Dumpty ride to maximize daily revenue. Let's break this down step by step.

Right now, they charge 25 cents per ride, and they get 6,000 passengers each day. The managers think that for every 1 cent decrease in the price, the number of passengers increases by 400. Conversely, for each 1 cent increase, the passengers drop by 400. So, the number of passengers is sensitive to the price changes in 1-cent increments.

My goal is to find the price that will bring in the most revenue. Revenue is calculated as price multiplied by quantity (in this case, passengers). So, Revenue (R) = Price (p) * Quantity (q).

Let me represent the price as p cents. The current price is 25 cents, so I can model the price around this point. For every cent change from 25, the quantity changes by 400 passengers per cent.

Wait, actually, the change in quantity depends on how much the price changes. Let me define the variables more clearly. Let x be the number of cents they change the price. If x is positive, the price increases by x cents. If x is negative, the price decreases by |x| cents. For each cent increase (positive x), passengers decrease by 400. For each cent decrease (negative x), passengers increase by 400.

So, the new price would be (25 + x) cents. The number of passengers would then be 6000 + (400 * (-x/1)), wait, no. Wait, let's think again. For each 1 cent decrease (x negative), passengers increase by 400. So the change in passengers is 400 * (delta_x), where delta_x is the change in cents. Hmm, maybe it's better to model x as the change in price in cents.

Alternatively, perhaps I should let x be the number of cents the price is changed. So, the new price p = 25 + x cents. The number of passengers q = 6000 - 400x. Because if x is positive (they increase the price by x cents), then passengers decrease by 400x. If x is negative (they decrease the price by |x| cents), passengers increase by 400|x|, so q would be 6000 + 400|x|. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express this with x being the change in price, so q = 6000 - 400x, where x can be positive or negative.

Wait, no, if they decrease the price by 1 cent (x=-1), then q increases by 400. So q =6000 +400*(1) when x is -1. So in terms of x (the change in price), the equation is q =6000 +400*(-x). Because for each +1 cent increase in price (x=1), q decreases by 400. So yes, q =6000 -400x.

Wait, no, because x is the change. So if x is the change in price (in cents), then:

If they lower the price by 1 cent (x=-1), passengers increase by 400. So the equation would be q =6000 +400*(change in price's negative). Hmm, maybe I need to model it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should let the price be p cents. The original price is 25. So p =25 + delta, where delta is the change in cents. Then, the number of passengers is 6000 -400*(delta). Because for each cent increase (delta positive), passengers decrease by 400. For each cent decrease (delta negative), passengers increase by 400.

Wait, no. Wait, when delta is positive (price increase), passengers decrease by 400 per delta. So q=6000 -400*(delta). When delta is negative (price decrease), delta is negative, so q=6000 -400*(delta) would become 6000 + positive value. For example, if delta is -1 (price 24), q=6000 -400*(-1)=6000+400=6400. Which makes sense.

So, yes, the formula is q =6000 -400*(delta), where delta is the change in price. So, the price is p =25 + delta.

But maybe it's easier to model p as the new price. So, if p is the price in cents, then delta is (p -25). So, the number of passengers q =6000 -400*(p -25). Because when p increases above 25, delta is positive, so q decreases.

So, q =6000 -400*(p -25) =6000 -400p +10000 =16000 -400p. Wait, wait, let me calculate that again.

Wait, 6000 -400*(p-25) =6000 -400p + (400*25) =6000 -400p +10,000= 16,000 -400p.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it step by step:

q =6000 -400*(p-25) =6000 -400p +400*25.

What's 400 *25? 10,000.

So, 6000 +10,000 =16,000, so 16,000 -400p.

Wait, that's interesting. So, q =16000 -400p.

But wait, if p is in cents. So, for example, at p=25, q=16000 -400*25=16000-10,000=6000, which matches. If p=24, then q=16000 -400*24=16000-9600=6400, which is correct (since 1 cent decrease brings 400 more passengers, so 6000+400=6400).

So, the q equation is correct: q=16000 -400p.

Now, the revenue R is p multiplied by q, so R=p*(16000 -400p) =16000p -400p².

To find the maximum revenue, we can treat this as a quadratic equation. Since the coefficient of p² is negative (-400), the parabola opens downward, so the maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex of a parabola in the form R = ap² + bp + c is at p = -b/(2a). Here, a is -400, and b is 16000.

So, p = -b/(2a) = -16000/(2*(-400)) = -16000 / (-800) = 20.

Wait, that's 20 cents. So the price that maximizes revenue is 20 cents.

Looking at the options, option I is 20 cents. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, R = p * q = p*(16000 -400p) =16000p -400p².

The derivative dR/dp =16000 -800p. Setting derivative to zero for maximum:

16000 -800p =0 --> 800p=16000 --> p=20.

Yes, that's correct. So the optimal price is 20 cents.

To determine the admission charge that maximizes daily revenue for Disney World's Humpty Dumpty ride, we start by defining the price as \( p \) (in cents) and the number of passengers as \( q \). The relationship between price and passengers is given by:

\[
q = 6000 - 400(p - 25)
\]

Simplifying this:

\[
q = 6000 - 400p + 10000 = 16000 - 400p
\]

Revenue (\( R \)) is calculated as the product of price and quantity:

\[
R = p \cdot q = p(16000 - 400p) = 16000p - 400p^2
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( R = -400p^2 + 16000p \), where the coefficient of \( p^2 \) is negative, indicating that the parabola opens downward and the maximum revenue occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is located at:

\[
p = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = -400 \) and \( b = 16000 \). Substituting these values:

\[
p = -\frac{16000}{2(-400)} = -\frac{16000}{-800} = 20
\]

Thus, the price that maximizes revenue is 20 cents. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: 20 cents**
