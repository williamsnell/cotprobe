Okay, so I have this property law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a shopkeeper who owns a vacant lot in fee simple absolute. He conveyed the property in 1960 using a general warranty deed. The deed says: "The grantor hereby conveys the vacant lot to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25." 

Hmm, so the initial conveyance is to the friend, but there's a condition. If the property is used for church purposes, it goes to the sister's children who are 25 or older. 

At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single. Later, she married and had two sons. Then one son died in a car accident. Three years after that, the sister had a daughter. Now, the question is about determining ownership rights with all minors represented.

Wait, so the current situation is: the sister has two sons (one deceased, one alive) and a daughter born after the first son's death. We need to figure out who owns the lot now.

First, I think I should analyze the type of estate created here. The conveyance is to the friend, but with a condition. So it sounds like a fee simple determinable because it's "to A, but if...". That creates a possibility of reverter if the condition is met. 

Wait, or is it a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent? No, because the wording is "but if", which typically indicates a determinable fee. So the friend has a fee simple determinable, and the shopkeeper (grantor) has a possibility of reverter. But wait, the grantor's deed says that if the condition happens, it goes to the sister's children. So maybe it's a fee simple determinable with a springing executory interest.

Wait, no. The grantor is conveying to the friend, but if the property is used for church purposes, it goes to the sister's children. So the friend gets a fee simple determinable, and the sister's children have an executory interest. Because executory interests cut short another estate upon a condition.

So the structure is:

- Friend: fee simple determinable (FSD).
- Upon condition (use for church purposes), the property goes to the sister's children who reach 25. So that's an executory interest in favor of those children.

But what about the sister's situation? At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single, so she wasn't married yet. She later married and had two sons, then one died, and later had a daughter. So the sister has three children: two sons (one deceased) and a daughter.

Now, the executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25. So only those who are 25 or older would take. But the question says that in the action, all minors are represented, implying that the children are minors now.

Wait, but the condition is that the property is used for church purposes. So when does the executory interest take effect? Let me think.

If the property is ever used for church purposes, then the ownership shifts. But if that hasn't happened yet, the friend still holds the fee simple determinable. So the ownership is currently with the friend, unless the condition has been triggered.

But the question says "in an appropriate action to determine the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented." It doesn't specify that the condition has been met. So I think the condition hasn't occurred yet, meaning the property isn't being used for church purposes, so the executory interest hasn't been triggered.

Wait, but the question is asking about current ownership, not a future scenario. So perhaps the condition hasn't been met, so the friend still owns it. But I need to make sure.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the property is used for church purposes, and if that ever happens, then it goes to the sister's children. So the friend holds the property unless it's used for church purposes. If it's used for church purposes, then it goes to the sister's children who are 25. So until then, the friend owns it.

So the current ownership is with the friend, unless the condition has been met. But the question doesn't say that the property is being used for church purposes now. So perhaps the condition hasn't occurred, and the friend still holds the fee simple determinable.

Wait, but the question is about determining the ownership rights now. So friend owns it, but with the possibility that if it's used for church purposes, the sister's children who are 25 take over.

Alternatively, perhaps the executory interest is in the sister's children, and the condition is a limitation on the friend's ownership. So the friend has a defeasible fee, and the sister's children have an executory interest.

But the sister's children would only take if the condition is met. So if the property is used for church purposes, then the executory interest becomes possessory, and the friend's estate ends.

But in this problem, we don't know if the condition has been met. So the ownership is with the friend unless the condition has occurred.

Wait, but the question is about when the condition hasn't been met. So the answer would be that the friend owns it now. But looking at the options:

Option C is "the friend only." But let's look at the other options.

Wait, but perhaps the executory interest is a contingent remainder. Because the sister's children weren't in existence at the time of the conveyance. At the time, the sister was single, so she had no children. So the interest in the sister's children is a contingent remainder because their existence is uncertain.

Wait, no, because the executory interest is in a third party (the sister's children), not the grantor. So it's an executory interest, not a remainder.

But in any case, the friend still holds the property unless the condition is met. So if the condition hasn't been met, the friend is the current owner.

But wait, the problem says that the sister has children now. So the executory interest is in those children, but they haven't met the age condition yet. Because they are minors, so they haven't reached 25.

So the executory interest is contingent on two conditions: (1) the property being used for church purposes, and (2) the sister's children reaching 25.

Wait, but the condition is that the property is used for church purposes, and then it goes to the children who reach 25. So perhaps the use for church purposes triggers the shift, but the children have to survive to 25.

Wait, the deed says: "if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25."

So the condition is the use for church purposes, and the executory interest is in the children who reach 25. So the age condition is part of the executory interest.

So the sister's children must survive to 25 to take. So any child who dies before 25 doesn't take.

In the scenario, the sister has two sons. One died in an accident, and three years later, she had a daughter. So the first son died as a minor, I assume. The second son is alive but a minor, and the daughter is also a minor.

So, the executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25. So if the property is used for church purposes, then the children who have reached 25 would take. But if they die before 25, they can't take.

So if the condition is met now, who would take? The sister's children who have reached 25. But currently, the sister's children are minors, so none have reached 25. So the executory interest can't vest yet.

Wait, but if the condition is met (property used for church purposes), and none of the sister's children have reached 25, then the executory interest can't take effect. So perhaps the property would revert to the grantor or someone else.

But the grantor (shopkeeper) conveyed the property, so the executory interest is in the sister's children. If none of them reach 25, then the executory interest fails, and the property would revert to the grantor's estate or perhaps the friend.

Wait, but the friend has a fee simple determinable, so upon the condition, the estate automatically reverts to the holder of the executory interest. If the executory interest can't take effect (because the condition isn't met), then the property would revert to the grantor, but the grantor's estate was already transferred. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

But in the current scenario, I think the condition hasn't been met. So the friend still holds the fee simple determinable. The executory interest in the sister's children is still contingent on two things: the property being used for church purposes, and the children reaching 25.

So until the property is used for church purposes, the friend owns it. The sister's children have a potential interest, but it's not vested yet.

Therefore, the current ownership is with the friend only. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is "the friend and any children of the sister reaching the age of 25." Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the condition for the executory interest is the use for church purposes, not the age. The age is part of the executory interest.

Alternatively, perhaps the executory interest is a springing executory interest in the sister's children, but only if they reach 25. So the friend holds the property unless it's used for church purposes, in which case it goes to the sister's children who are 25.

But if the condition (church use) is met, and no children are 25, then the executory interest can't take effect. So the property may revert to the grantor, but the grantor conveyed it, so perhaps the friend's estate continues.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline:

- Shopkeeper (grantor) conveys to friend in fee simple determinable.

- The condition is "if used for church purposes."

- Upon condition, executory interest to sister's children who reach 25.

So the structure is:

1. Present estate: Friend has a fee simple determinable.

2. Future interest: Executory interest in sister's children (but only those who reach 25).

So, if the property is ever used for church purposes, the friend's estate ends, and the executory interest vests in the sister's children who are 25 or older.

If the property is never used for church purposes, the friend keeps it forever, and the executory interest never vests.

In the current scenario, the condition (church use) hasn't happened yet, so the friend still owns the property. The executory interest is still a future interest that hasn't vested because the condition hasn't occurred.

Therefore, the current ownership is with the friend only, regardless of the sister's children's ages because the condition hasn't been met.

So looking at the options, option C says "the friend only." That seems correct.

Wait, but let's look at the other options. Option E says "the friend and any children of the sister reaching the age of 25." That would imply that once a child reaches 25, they have an interest. But that's not the case unless the condition (church use) is met. The age is a condition for the executory interest, but the executory interest only cuts in if the property is used for church purposes. So the age condition is part of the executory interest, not a condition for current ownership.

So, the friend owns the property until the condition is met. Then, if the condition is met, it goes to the sister's children who are 25 or older. Until then, the friend is the sole owner.

So, the correct answer is option C: the friend only.

The shopkeeper conveyed the vacant lot to the friend in 1960 using a general warranty deed with the condition: "if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25." This created a fee simple determinable in favor of the friend, with a springing executory interest in the sister's children who reach the age of 25. The executory interest is contingent on two conditions: (1) the property being used for church purposes, and (2) the sister's children reaching the age of 25.

At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single and had no children. Subsequently, she married and had two sons and a daughter. One son died in an automobile accident, and three years later, she had a daughter. Currently, the sister has three children: two sons (one deceased) and a daughter. However, the condition for the executory interest—use of the property for church purposes—has not been triggered. Therefore, the executory interest remains contingent and has not vested.

The friend holds the fee simple determinable, and the executory interest in the sister's children has not yet taken effect because the condition (use for church purposes) has not occurred. The age condition (reaching 25) is irrelevant at this point since the executory interest cannot vest until the property is used for church purposes. As a result, the current ownership of the property is with the friend only.

Option C correctly reflects the current ownership: "the friend only."

**Answer: C**
