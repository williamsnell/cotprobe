Okay, so I've got this economics question here about inelastic demand. Hmm, I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a price change. Inelastic demand means that the quantity demanded doesn't change much when the price changes, right?

Wait, the formula for price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. If the result is less than 1, it's inelastic. So I'm looking for an option where the percentage change in quantity is smaller than the percentage change in price.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says a 10% price decrease leads to a 20% increase in quantity. So the elasticity is 20/10 = 2. That's elastic because it's greater than 1. So A isn't the answer.

Option B: 3% price decrease, 5% increase. Elasticity is 5/3 ≈1.67. Also elastic. Not B.

Option C: 2% price decrease, 5% increase. 5/2=2.5. Elastic. So C is out.

Option D: 4% price increase, 6% decrease. Wait, so price goes up 4%, quantity goes down 6%. The formula uses absolute values, so 6/4=1.5. That's elastic. So D isn't it.

Option E: 10% price increase, 15% decrease. 15/10=1.5. Elastic. So E is no.

Option F: 6% increase, 9% decrease. 9/6=1.5. Elastic again. F is out.

Option G: 7% price decrease, 10% increase. 10/7≈1.43. Elastic. So G isn't.

Option H: 5% price increase, 3% decrease. So 3/5=0.6. That's less than 1, which means inelastic demand. So H is the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is asking which situation shows inelastic demand. So yes, H fits because the quantity change is proportionally smaller than the price change.

Inelastic demand occurs when the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price. This means the price elasticity of demand is less than 1. To determine which option represents inelastic demand, we calculate the elasticity for each scenario:

- **A**: Elasticity = 20%/10% = 2 → Elastic  
- **B**: Elasticity = 5%/3% ≈ 1.67 → Elastic  
- **C**: Elasticity = 5%/2% = 2.5 → Elastic  
- **D**: Elasticity = 6%/4% = 1.5 → Elastic  
- **E**: Elasticity = 15%/10% = 1.5 → Elastic  
- **F**: Elasticity = 9%/6% = 1.5 → Elastic  
- **G**: Elasticity = 10%/7% ≈ 1.43 → Elastic  
- **H**: Elasticity = 3%/5% = 0.6 → Inelastic  

Only **H** has an elasticity value less than 1, indicating inelastic demand. 

Answer: H
