Okay, so I've got this investment problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question says that an investment of $4000 grows at a rate described by the function 320*e^(0.08t) dollars per year after t years. And we need to find out its value after 10 years, choosing the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, wait a second. Wait, the function given is 320e^(0.08t). But wait, that's the rate at which it's growing each year, right? Or is it the total value? I think I need to clarify that. Because if it's the growth rate per year, then maybe we're dealing with continuous compounding or something like that.

Wait, no, the problem says it grows at the rate of 320e^(0.08t) dollars per year after t years. Oh, so perhaps that function represents the annual growth rate. Or wait, maybe it's the total value at time t? That's a bit unclear. Let me read the question again.

The investment grows at the rate of 320e^(0.08t) dollars per year after t years. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps that function gives the value of the investment after t years. Like, the value V(t) is equal to 320e^(0.08t). But wait, the initial investment is $4000. That doesn't quite add up because if you plug t=0 into 320e^(0), you get 320, which is much less than $4000. So that can't be right.

Oh, wait! Maybe I misinterpret the question. Perhaps the investment grows by that amount each year. Or maybe the rate is given as 320e^(0.08t) dollars per year. Wait, perhaps the function represents the rate of growth, like the derivative. So if dV/dt = 320e^(0.08t), then V(t) would be the integral of that plus the initial condition.

But that seems a bit complicated. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to represent the future value. So perhaps the formula is V(t) = 4000 * e^(0.08t). But wait, 320 * e^(0.08t) doesn't make sense because at t=0, it's 320, which is less than 4000.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to parse the question again. It says, "grows at the rate of 320e^(0.08t) dollars per year after t years." So maybe that's the rate of change each year, like dV/dt = 320e^(0.08t). So then to find the value after 10 years, I need to integrate this rate from 0 to 10 and add the initial investment.

Wait, but the initial investment is $4000, so V(0) = 4000. If dV/dt is 320e^(0.08t), then V(t) would be the integral of 320e^(0.08t) dt from 0 to t, plus 4000. Let me compute that integral.

The integral of e^(kt) dt is (1/k)e^(kt) + C. So integrating 320e^(0.08t) dt would be 320*(1/0.08) e^(0.08t) + C. Let's compute 320 / 0.08. 0.08 is 8 hundredths, so 320 divided by 0.08 is 320 * (100/8) = 320 * 12.5 = 4000. So the integral is 4000 e^(0.08t) + C.

Now, applying the initial condition V(0) = 4000. At t=0, V(0) = 4000 e^(0) + C = 4000*1 + C = 4000 + C = 4000. So C must be zero. So V(t) = 4000 e^(0.08t).

Wait, so then after 10 years, t=10. So V(10) = 4000 e^(0.08 * 10) = 4000 e^(0.8). Let's calculate e^0.8. I remember that e^0.7 is approximately 2.01375, and e^0.8 is about 2.2255. Let me check that. Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 0.8 is a bit less than 1, and e^1 is about 2.71828. So e^0.8 is somewhere around 2.2255.

So V(10) = 4000 * 2.2255 ≈ 4000 * 2.2255. Let me compute that. 4000 * 2 = 8000, 4000 * 0.2255 = 902. So 8000 + 902 = 8902. So approximately $8,902. Let's see the options. Option E is $8,902. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another second. I'm assuming that the rate given is dV/dt = 320e^(0.08t), which seems a bit odd because when I integrated it, I ended up with V(t) = 4000 e^(0.08t), which would mean that the initial investment grows continuously with an annual rate of 8%, which is a standard formula. So perhaps the intended approach is to recognize that the given function is the continuous growth formula, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is saying that the investment's value is given by 320e^(0.08t), but that doesn't make sense because at t=0, it's 320, but the initial investment is 4000. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's say the investment grows at an annual rate of 8%, compounded continuously. Then the formula is V(t) = P e^(rt), where P is principal, r is rate, t is time.

Here, P is $4000, r is 8% or 0.08, t is 10 years. So V(10)=4000 e^(0.08*10) = 4000 e^0.8 ≈ 4000 * 2.2255 ≈ 8902, which is option E. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the given function is 320e^(0.08t), but that would imply that the initial value is 320, which contradicts the $4000 given. So perhaps the function given is the rate of growth, which would mean I should integrate as I did before, leading to the same result.

So either way, the answer seems to be approximately $8,902, which is option E.

The problem involves an investment of $4000 that grows at a rate described by the function \( 320e^{0.08t} \) dollars per year after \( t \) years. The goal is to determine the investment's value after 10 years.

To interpret the problem, the function \( 320e^{0.08t} \) likely represents the rate of growth (i.e., the derivative of the value function), meaning \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 320e^{0.08t} \). To find the total value \( V(t) \), we integrate this rate function:

\[
V(t) = \int 320e^{0.08t} \, dt + C
\]

The integral of \( 320e^{0.08t} \) is:

\[
V(t) = \frac{320}{0.08} e^{0.08t} + C = 4000e^{0.08t} + C
\]

Applying the initial condition \( V(0) = 4000 \), we find \( C = 0 \). Thus, the value function is:

\[
V(t) = 4000e^{0.08t}
\]

For \( t = 10 \):

\[
V(10) = 4000e^{0.8}
\]

Using \( e^{0.8} \approx 2.2255 \):

\[
V(10) \approx 4000 \times 2.2255 = 8902
\]

This matches option E, which is approximately $8,902. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: $8,902**
