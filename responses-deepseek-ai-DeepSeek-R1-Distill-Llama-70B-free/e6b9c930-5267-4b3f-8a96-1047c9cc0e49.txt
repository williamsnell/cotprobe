Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with possession of heroin. At the defendant's preliminary hearing, the prosecution presented evidence that the defendant was arrested while riding in a car. The heroin was found in a briefcase containing no identification, but several papers found inside contained references to the defendant. The defendant's attorney argued that the briefcase did not belong to the defendant, and the defendant had no idea how the heroin got inside the briefcase. The court ruled that there was insufficient probable cause to support a prosecution of the defendant on the heroin possession charge. The defendant was released from custody and charges were dropped. Several weeks later, a grand jury was convened to determine if the defendant should be re-indicted for heroin possession based on the same alleged incident reviewed at the preliminary hearing. The defendant was called to testif' as a witness at the grand jury hearing. He appeared and was sworn in as a witness. The defendant proceeded to challenge the proceeding on the basis that any grand jury indictment for heroin possession would constitute a violation of the double jeopardy clause. The defendant's double jeopardy challenge should be

Options:

A: denied, because there is no basis for a double jeopardy challenge.
B: granted, because the heroin possession charge was formally dismissed at the preliminary hearing.
C: denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction.
D: granted, because the defendant has the right to avoid self-incrimination.
E: denied, because the grand jury proceeding is not considered a trial.
F: granted, because by voluntarily appearing at the grand jury hearing, the defendant has standing to challenge the indictment.
G: granted, because the defendant has already been tried for the same charge.
H: denied, because double jeopardy only applies if the initial charge resulted in a conviction or acquittal.
I: granted, because the defendant was previously held in custody for the same charge.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the double jeopardy clause. Hmm, let me read through it again.

So, the situation is: A defendant was arrested for possession of heroin. At the preliminary hearing, the prosecution presented evidence that the defendant was in a car where a briefcase with heroin was found. The briefcase didn't have ID, but some papers inside mentioned the defendant. The defense argued that the briefcase wasn't his, and the court ruled there wasn't enough probable cause, so charges were dropped and the defendant was released.

Then, weeks later, a grand jury was convened to consider re-indicting him on the same charge. The defendant was called as a witness, sworn in, and he challenged the proceedings, saying a new indictment would violate double jeopardy.

The question is whether his challenge should be granted or denied, and why.

I remember that the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But when does jeopardy attach? I think in a trial, it's when the jury is sworn in or when the first witness is sworn in a bench trial. But wait, what about preliminary hearings or grand jury proceedings?

Wait, a preliminary hearing is not a trial. It's just to determine if there's enough evidence to proceed. So, if the case is dismissed at the preliminary stage, does that mean jeopardy has attached?

I remember from my studies that jeopardy doesn't attach at a preliminary hearing because it's not a trial. The purpose is to determine probable cause, not to determine guilt or innocence. So even if the case is dismissed at that stage, the prosecution can try again, maybe with a grand jury indictment.

So, when the defendant was at the preliminary hearing, the court found no probable cause, so the charges were dropped. But that doesn't mean he was acquitted. Acquittal is when a court finds you not guilty after a trial. A dismissal for lack of probable cause is different.

Now, the grand jury is considering indicting him again. The defendant argues double jeopardy. But since the first proceeding was a preliminary hearing, not a trial, jeopardy never attached. So, he can't claim double jeopardy now.

Looking at the options:

Option C says: "denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction." That sounds right because the preliminary hearing isn't a trial, so no acquittal or conviction, so no jeopardy attached.

Option E says: "denied, because the grand jury proceeding is not considered a trial." Wait, the grand jury is part of the charging process, not a trial. So, the issue is whether the first proceeding (preliminary hearing) was a trial. Since it wasn't, the grand jury can indict again.

Another option, H: "denied, because double jeopardy only applies if the initial charge resulted in a conviction or acquittal." That's similar to C. Both C and H seem plausible, but I think the key is that double jeopardy attaches at trial, not at preliminary stages.

So, the defendant's challenge is based on the idea that he's being tried again, but since the first time wasn't a trial, the challenge should be denied because there's no basis for double jeopardy.

Looking again, the correct answer is probably C or E. Wait, but E talks about the grand jury not being a trial, which is correct, but the real issue is that the preliminary hearing wasn't a trial, so no jeopardy attached in the first place. So the reason is more about when jeopardy attaches.

So, the defendant's challenge should be denied because double jeopardy rights only attach when there's an acquittal or conviction, which hasn't happened here. So the correct answer is C.

The double jeopardy clause protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. However, jeopardy does not attach at a preliminary hearing because it is not a trialâ€”it is merely a proceeding to determine probable cause. In this case, the defendant's charges were dismissed at the preliminary hearing due to insufficient evidence, but this does not constitute an acquittal or conviction, which are required for double jeopardy to apply. The grand jury proceeding is part of the charging process and not a trial, so the defendant's challenge based on double jeopardy is without merit.

The correct answer is:

**C: denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction.**

Answer: C
