Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about the melting point of sulfur under different pressures. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that the melting point of monoclinic sulfur at 1 atm is 119.3°C. They give me the change in volume during fusion as 41 cm³/kg and the enthalpy of fusion as 422 cal/mol⁻¹. I need to find the melting point when the pressure is raised to 1000 atm. The options are A through D, with temperatures ranging from 120°C to 200°C.

Hmm, I remember that when pressure changes, the phase transition temperature can shift. I think this involves the Clapeyron equation. Right, the Clapeyron equation relates the change in pressure to the change in temperature during a phase transition. The equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus)/(TΔV), where ΔH_fus is the enthalpy of fusion and ΔV is the change in volume.

Wait, but wait. So, ΔV is the volume change when the substance melts. Since it's going from solid to liquid, I should check whether the volume increases or decreases. The problem states the change in volume is 41 cm³/kg. I think when a substance melts, if the volume increases, then it's positive. So when pressure increases, whether the melting point increases or decreases would depend on whether the substance expands or contracts upon melting.

Wait, so the Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = ΔH_fus/(TΔV). But I need to make sure about the sign. Since we're dealing with fusion (melting), ΔH_fus is positive because melting requires heat. Now, ΔV is V_liquid - V_solid. If the substance expands upon melting, then ΔV is positive. So, if ΔV is positive, then dP/dT is positive because ΔH_fus is positive. That means when pressure increases, the melting temperature increases. Conversely, if the substance contracts upon melting (ΔV negative), increasing pressure would lower the melting point.

Wait, but in this problem, the volume change is given as 41 cm³/kg. I think that's per kilogram, so that's the specific volume change. But I need to relate this to molar quantities because the enthalpy is given per mole.

Wait, let me collect the data:

At 1 atm, melting point T1 = 119.3°C = 392.45 K (since to convert Celsius to Kelvin, add 273.15).

Pressure change ΔP = 1000 atm - 1 atm ≈ 999 atm. I might approximate this as 1000 atm for simplicity, but I should think about it.

ΔH_fus is 422 cal/mol. Wait, 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 422 cal is approximately 1762.048 J/mol.

The change in volume during fusion, ΔV, is 41 cm³/kg. But I need this in m³/mol. Wait, because the units for the Clapeyron equation need to be consistent. 

So, first, I need to calculate ΔV in m³/mol. Let's think about the molar mass of sulfur. Sulfur has an atomic weight of about 32 g/mol. So 1 mole is 32 grams.

Wait, but the given ΔV is per kg. So 41 cm³/kg is 41,000 cm³ per kg. Wait no, 41 cm³/kg is 0.041 m³/kg? Wait no, 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 1 m³ = 1e6 * 1000 cm³? Wait no, wait 1 m³ = 1e3 liters, because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. Oh right, 1 m³ is 1,000,000 cm³. So 41 cm³/kg is 41/1e6 m³/kg = 4.1e-5 m³/kg.

Wait, but I need per mole. So first, compute the specific volume change, then convert to molar volume change.

Wait, the specific volume is volume per mass, so 41 cm³/kg is the specific volume change, Δv = v_liquid - v_solid = 41 cm³/kg = 0.041 m³/kg? No, wait. 41 cm³/kg is 41 * (1e-6) m³/kg, because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So 41 cm³/kg = 41e-6 m³/kg = 4.1e-5 m³/kg.

Now, to get the molar volume change, ΔV, I need to multiply by the molar mass. Because the specific volume (v) is volume per unit mass, so v = V/m. Molar volume V_m = m * v, where m is molar mass.

So, the molar volume change ΔV_molar = (specific volume change) * molar mass.

Sulfur's molar mass is approx 32.065 g/mol, which is 0.032065 kg/mol.

So ΔV_molar = 4.1e-5 m³/kg * 0.032065 kg/mol = ?

Let me compute that: 4.1e-5 * 0.032065 = 1.31465e-6 m³/mol.

Wait, that seems really small. Let me double-check:

Wait, 4.1e-5 m³/kg * 0.032065 kg/mol = 4.1e-5 * 3.2065e-2 = (4.1 * 3.2065) x 1e-7.

4.1 *3.2065 is approximately 13.14665, so 13.14665e-7 = 1.314665e-6 m³/mol.

So ΔV_molar = 1.314665e-6 m³/mol.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the given ΔV is the specific volume change, but when using the Clapeyron equation, the ΔV should be the molar volume change, which is V_liquid - V_solid.

Now, the Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / (T ΔV). Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign. Let me think: when the pressure increases, how does the melting point change? For most substances, when pressure increases, the melting point increases if the substance expands upon melting (because the solid is denser than the liquid). So, for water, which expands upon freezing, the melting point decreases with pressure. But for most other substances, like sulfur, I think they contract upon freezing, so the solid is denser. So, when you increase pressure, the melting point would increase.

So, if the specific volume increases upon melting (Δv positive), then ΔV_molar is positive. So, when pressure increases, the melting point increases.

So, back to the problem. The pressure is changing from 1 atm to 1000 atm, so a change of approximately 999 atm. But since 1 atm is much smaller than 1000 atm, I can approximate the change as 1000 atm.

But wait, the Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = ΔH_fus / (T ΔV). So, integrating this, assuming ΔH_fus and ΔV are constant over temperature and pressure changes, which is an approximation.

The equation can be written as:

dP = (ΔH_fus / (T ΔV)) dT

We need to find the change in T when P changes from 1 atm to 1000 atm. So, integrating both sides:

ΔP = (ΔH_fus / ΔV) ∫ (1/T) dT from T1 to T2.

Wait, but wait, no. Because dP = (ΔH_fus)/(T ΔV) dT → rearranged as dT = (T ΔV / ΔH_fus) dP.

So, integrating from P1 to P2 and T1 to T2:

∫_{T1}^{T2} dT = ∫_{P1}^{P2} (T ΔV / ΔH_fus) dP.

Wait, but that's not quite right because T is a variable on both sides. Alternatively, assuming that T doesn't change much, perhaps we can approximate T as T1, the initial temperature. So then:

ΔT ≈ (T1 ΔV / ΔH_fus) ΔP.

Wait, but wait, that would be an approximation. Alternatively, if the change in T is small, this might be acceptable. Let's see.

So, the change in pressure ΔP is 1000 atm - 1 atm ≈ 999,000 atm? Wait no, no. Wait, 1 atm is 101325 Pascals. So 1000 atm is 101325 * 1000 = 1.01325e8 Pa. So the change in pressure from 1 atm to 1000 atm is ΔP = 999 * 1 atm = 999 * 101325 Pa ≈ 1.012e8 Pa.

But perhaps it's easier to work in atm units. Let me see what units I have.

Wait, but the units for the variables in the Clapeyron equation must be consistent. Because ΔH_fus is in cal/mol, which is energy per mole, and ΔV is in m³/mol.

Wait, but I'll proceed with the formula in terms of the variables I have.

So, the formula is:

dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / (T ΔV)

We can rearrange this as:

dT/dP = (T ΔV) / (ΔH_fus)

But since I'm dealing with a finite change, maybe I can approximate:

ΔT ≈ (T1 ΔV / ΔH_fus) ΔP

But wait, the units must be consistent. Let's make sure.

ΔH_fus is 422 cal/mol. Let's convert that to J: 422 cal * 4.184 J/cal ≈ 1762 J/mol.

ΔV is 1.314665e-6 m³/mol.

T1 is 392.45 K.

ΔP is 999 atm. But 1 atm is 101325 Pa, so 999 atm is 999 * 101325 ≈ 1.012e8 Pa.

So plugging into the equation:

ΔT ≈ (T1 * ΔV / ΔH_fus) * ΔP

Wait, but the units for ΔV are m³/mol, and ΔH_fus is J/mol, which is m³·Pa/mol. So let's check:

ΔV (m³/mol)

ΔH_fus (J/mol) = (N·m)/mol = (Pa·m³)/mol.

So, (T1 * ΔV) / ΔH_fus → (K * m³/mol) / (Pa·m³/mol) ) → K/Pa.

So, when multiplied by ΔP (Pa), the units become K, which is correct for ΔT.

So, let's compute this:

ΔT = (T1 * ΔV / ΔH_fus) * ΔP

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔT = (392.45 K * 1.314665e-6 m³/mol) / (1762 J/mol) ) * 1.012e8 Pa.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute numerator: 392.45 K * 1.314665e-6 m³/mol = 392.45 * 1.314665e-6 ≈ let's calculate that.

392.45 * 1.314665e-6 ≈ (approx 390 * 1.3e-6 )= 507e-6 = 5.07e-4, but let me compute it accurately.

Compute 392.45 * 1.314665e-6:

392.45 * 1.314665 ≈ 392.45 * 1.314665 ≈ let me compute:

392 * 1.314665 = ?

Well, 392 * 1 = 392

392 * 0.3 = 117.6 → 509.6

392 * 0.014665 ≈ let's see: 392 * 0.01 = 3.92; 392 * 0.004665 ≈ approx 1.83. So total ≈ 3.92 + 1.83 = 5.75 → total 509.6 + 5.75 ≈ 515.35. But since it's 1.314665, perhaps more accurately, but maybe I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 392.45 * 1.314665 = let's compute:

= (390 + 2.45) * 1.314665

= 390 * 1.314665 + 2.45 * 1.314665

Compute 390 * 1.314665:

= 390 * 1 =390

390 * 0.3 = 117 → total 507

390 * 0.014665 ≈ 5.728 → total approx 512.728.

Then 2.45 * 1.314665 ≈ approx 3.222.

So total ≈ 512.728 +3.222 = 515.95.

So 515.95e-6 → 5.1595e-4.

Wait no, wait:

Wait, ΔV is 1.314665e-6 m³/mol.

So 392.45 * 1.314665e-6 = (392.45 * 1.314665) * 1e-6 → 515.95 * 1e-6 = 5.1595e-4.

So numerator is 5.1595e-4 K·m³/(Pa·mol) ?

Wait, no: the numerator is 392.45 * 1.314665e-6 → 515.95e-6 K·m³/mol.

Denominator is ΔH_fus = 1762 J/mol = 1762 Pa·m³/mol.

So the division is (515.95e-6 K·m³/mol) / (1762 Pa·m³/mol) → (515.95e-6 / 1762) K/Pa.

Compute 515.95e-6 / 1762 → 515.95 / 1762 → approx 0.2928 → 0.2928e-6 → 2.928e-7 K/Pa.

Wait, wait, 515.95e-6 is 5.1595e-4, and 5.1595e-4 / 1762 is approximately:

Divide 5.1595e-4 by 1762:

5.1595e-4 / 1762 = (5.1595 / 1762) )e-4 → approximately 0.002928 → 2.928e-3 → multiply by 1e-4 → 2.928e-7.

So, 2.928e-7 K/Pa.

Now, multiply by ΔP = 1.012e8 Pa:

ΔT ≈ 2.928e-7 K/Pa * 1.012e8 Pa → 2.928e-7 * 1.012e8 = (2.928 * 1.012) * 1e1 → approx 2.96 *10 = 29.6 K.

Wait, that's a change of about 29.6 K, so about 29.6°C increase in melting point.

So the original melting point was 119.3°C, so the new melting point would be 119.3 + 29.6 ≈ 148.9°C. Looking at the options, option B is 150°C, which is very close. So the answer is B.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are a bit tricky.

Wait, in the calculation of ΔT, I approximated T as T1, but if the change is significant, this might introduce some error. However, given the options, it's probably acceptable.

Wait another thing: the sign. Since ΔV is positive (volume increases upon melting), so dP/dT is positive. So when P increases, T increases, which aligns with our conclusion that the melting point goes up, so from 119.3 to about 149°C, which is option B: 150°C.
</think>

To determine the melting point of sulfur at 1000 atm, we use the Clapeyron equation:

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{fus}}}{T \Delta V}
\]

Rearranging and approximating for finite changes:

\[
\Delta T \approx \frac{T_1 \Delta V}{\Delta H_{\text{fus}}} \Delta P
\]

### Given Data:
- Initial melting point: \( T_1 = 119.3^\circ \text{C} = 392.45 \, \text{K} \)
- Enthalpy of fusion: \( \Delta H_{\text{fus}} = 422 \, \text{cal/mol} = 1762 \, \text{J/mol} \)
- Specific volume change: \( \Delta v = 41 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{kg} = 4.1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg} \)
- Molar mass of sulfur: \( M = 32.065 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.032065 \, \text{kg/mol} \)
- Pressure change: \( \Delta P = 1000 \, \text{atm} - 1 \, \text{atm} \approx 999 \, \text{atm} = 1.012 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa} \)

### Step 1: Calculate Molar Volume Change
The molar volume change is:

\[
\Delta V = \Delta v \cdot M = (4.1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}) \cdot (0.032065 \, \text{kg/mol}) = 1.314665 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3/\text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Temperature Change
Substitute into the equation for \( \Delta T \):

\[
\Delta T = \frac{T_1 \Delta V}{\Delta H_{\text{fus}}} \cdot \Delta P
\]

\[
\Delta T = \frac{(392.45 \, \text{K
