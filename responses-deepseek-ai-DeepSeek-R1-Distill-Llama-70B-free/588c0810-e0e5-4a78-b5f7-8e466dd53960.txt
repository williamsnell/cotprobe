Question:

A farmer was the fee-simple owner of a tract of land inthe country. The farmer moved to the city in 1986. Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wanted to move back to the tract because he desired to return to the country. Finding the man in possession, the farmer initiated a suit in ejectment against the man. The most probable judicial determination would be

Options:

A: the farmer would lose, because he had abandoned the property for over 20 years.
B: the farmer would win, because the man had not paid property taxes during his occupancy.
C: the farmer would lose, because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.
D: the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.
E: the farmer would win, because the man did not have legal documentation of ownership.
F: the farmer would win, because the man had left the property for a year.
G: the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.
H: the farmer would lose, because the man was the current resident of the property.
I: the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder of record.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about adverse possession, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's a farmer who owns a tract of land in fee simple, which I remember means he has absolute ownership. He moved to the city in 1986. Then, in 1987, a man took possession of the land as an adverse possessor. Wait, what's adverse possession again? From what I remember, it's when someone takes possession of another's land without permission, and after a certain period, they can gain legal title. The requirements usually are that the possession is open, notorious, continuous, hostile, and for the statutory period.

In this case, the man stayed on the land from 1987 to 1997, which is 10 years. Then he left for a year to care for his sick mother, returning in 1999. So he was gone for one year. The statutory period here is 20 years. The farmer wants to move back in 2010 and sues the man in ejectment, which is a lawsuit to recover possession of the land.

The question is asking what the judicial determination would be. So the options are from A to J.

First, I need to figure out if the man's possession meets all the requirements for adverse possession. Let's break it down.

The statutory period is 20 years. The man started in 1987. If he had stayed continuously, he would have reached 20 years by 2007 (1987 + 20 = 2007). But he left from 1997 to 1998 (one year), then came back in 1999. Does that break the continuity?

I think the key here is whether the man's possession was continuous. If he left for a year, does that interrupt the adverse possession period? Because if the possession isn't continuous, then the time he was away wouldn't count, and he would have to start over.

Wait, but some states allow for a break if the adverse possessor returns within a certain time. Or maybe the possession is considered continuous if the absence is for a valid reason or if it's not too long. Alternatively, perhaps the time he was away doesn't count towards the statutory period, so when he returns, he has to start the count again.

So let's calculate the time the man was on the property. From 1987 to 1997 is 10 years. Then he left for one year, so from 1997 to 1998. Then he returned in 1999. So from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years. So total time on the property is 10 + 11 = 21 years. But wait, does the time count only when he's present?

No, I think the key is whether the possession was continuous. Because he left for a year, the continuity is broken. So the time before the break (10 years) and the time after (11 years) can't be added together. So he only has 11 years after 1999. Since the statutory period is 20 years, he hasn't met it yet by 2010 because 1999 + 20 would be 2019. So in 2010, he's only been there for 11 years since his return.

Wait, but maybe the time before and after the break can be added if the absence is due to certain circumstances. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the man's absence for a year interrupts the possession, so the 10 years before don't count, and he starts fresh upon returning in 1999. That would mean that by 2010, he's been there 11 years, which is still less than the 20-year requirement.

So if the man hasn't met the 20-year period, then the farmer would win because the adverse possession hasn't been completed yet.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the farmer would win because the man left for a year. Option G says because the man's possession was not continuous.

So if the man's possession isn't continuous, then he hasn't fulfilled the statutory period. So the farmer would win, which points to either F or G.

Wait, but what about the time before and after the break? Some sources say that if the adverse possessor is interrupted, the time before and after can't be tacked together. So each period has to be continuous. So in this case, the man had 10 years, then a break, then 11 years. But each is a separate period. So neither reaches 20, so he hasn't adversely possessed the land.

Therefore, the farmer would win because the man's possession wasn't continuous. So that would be option G.

Alternatively, option F is about the man leaving for a year, which would break continuity, so F could also be correct. But I think the precise reason is the lack of continuity, so G is better.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says the farmer loses because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous. But if the possession wasn't continuous because of the year-long absence, then C is incorrect.

Option D says the man fulfilled the 20-year period, but as per our calculation, he hasn't, because the time is split.

Option F says the farmer wins because the man left for a year. That's correct, but the reason is that it breaks continuity, which is option G.

So the correct answer should be G: the farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous.

The question revolves around adverse possession, which requires that the possession be open, notorious, continuous, hostile, and meet the statutory period. Here, the statutory period is 20 years. The man took possession in 1987 but left for a year in 1997, returning in 1999. This absence breaks the continuity of possession, meaning the time before and after the break cannot be combined to meet the 20-year requirement. By 2010, the man had only accumulated 11 continuous years of possession since his return, which is insufficient to complete adverse possession.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The farmer did not abandon the property; he was the rightful owner.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Non-payment of taxes does not automatically invalidate adverse possession.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The man's possession was not continuous due to the year-long absence.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The man did not fulfill the 20-year statutory period due to the break in continuity.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Lack of legal documentation does not determine the outcome in adverse possession cases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. While the man's absence is relevant, the precise issue is the lack of continuity, not just the absence itself.
- **Option G**: Correct. The man's possession was not continuous, which prevents him from meeting the statutory period.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The man being a current resident does not override the farmer's title.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the farmer is the titleholder, the question focuses on whether adverse possession has been completed.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Improvements on the land do not determine the outcome in this case.

The correct answer is **G**: the farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous.

Answer: G
