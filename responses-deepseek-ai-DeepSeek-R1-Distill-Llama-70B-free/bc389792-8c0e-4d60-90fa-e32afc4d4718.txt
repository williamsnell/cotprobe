Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a CPA's responsibilities after discovering an error in a tax return they prepared. Let me think through this step by step.

The question states that a CPA prepares income tax returns for a client. The client has already signed and mailed them. Then the CPA finds an error. The question is asking what the CPA must do according to Treasury Circular 230.

First, I remember that Treasury Circular 230 (also known as Circular 230) sets out the standards for practitioners, like CPAs, who practice before the IRS. It covers ethics, responsibilities, and procedures.

So, the CPA has a duty to act correctly when they find an error. The key here is what the CPA is required to do once they discover the mistake after the return has been filed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Promptly resign and cooperate with the successor. That doesn't seem right. The error doesn't necessarily mean the CPA should resign. They should probably fix it instead.

Option B: Prepare an amended return immediately and send it to the client. Well, the CPA should probably inform the client first, right? Also, amended returns are necessary, but maybe not the first step.

Option C: Inform the client's legal counsel. Hmm, that's not the first step. The CPA should talk to the client directly, not necessarily their lawyer unless it's a legal issue beyond tax.

Option D: Prepare an amended return within 30 days. I think there's a time frame, but I'm not sure if it's 30 days. Alternatively, maybe the CPA should act promptly, not wait.

Option E: Promptly advise the client of the error. This sounds correct. The CPA should inform the client as soon as possible about the mistake. That makes sense because the client needs to know and take corrective action.

Option F: Take responsibility and pay additional taxes. I don't think that's required. The CPA might be liable for penalties in some cases, but paying the client's taxes isn't usually a requirement here.

Option G: Document the error in workpapers. That's a good practice, but the question is about what the CPA must do according to Circular 230. While documentation is important, it's probably not the required action in terms of client notification.

Option H: Charge an additional fee. Unlikely. The CPA might not charge extra for correcting their own mistake, but this isn't a requirement.

Option I: Inform the IRS directly without telling the client. No, that's not right. The CPA should inform the client first, not go behind their back.

Option J: Ignore the error. Definitely not the case. Ethical standards require the CPA to correct errors.

So, putting it together, the CPA's responsibility is to promptly inform the client about the error. That's option E. The CPA should communicate this as soon as possible to allow the client to take necessary actions, like filing an amended return. 

I think the correct answer is E.

The CPA must promptly advise the client of the error after discovering it in the tax return. This aligns with the ethical standards outlined in Treasury Circular 230, which emphasize the practitioner's duty to inform the client promptly about any issues affecting their interests.
