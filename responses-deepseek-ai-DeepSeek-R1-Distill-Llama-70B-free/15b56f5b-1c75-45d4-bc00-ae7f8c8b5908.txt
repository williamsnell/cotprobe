Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about cystic fibrosis incidence among different populations and mixed matings. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll think it through step by step.

The question states that in Caucasians, the incidence of cystic fibrosis is about 1 in 2,000 births. Among nonwhites, it's much lower, about 1 in 250,000. So the first part is asking what the rate would be among matings between Caucasians and nonwhites. The second part is about what incidence would be expected if the offspring of such matings were to mate randomly among themselves.

I remember that cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. That means both parents must contribute a defective allele for the child to have the disease. Carriers (who have one defective allele) don't show symptoms but can pass it on.

Let me think about the carrier frequency in each population. The incidence is given, which is the percentage of affected individuals. For a recessive disease, the incidence (q²) relates to the carrier frequency (q). So if the incidence is 1 in 2,000, that's q² = 1/2000. To find q, I take the square root. Let me calculate that.

Square root of 1/2000 is approximately 0.02236, so about 2.24% of Caucasians are carriers. Wait, no wait—wait, no, wait. Wait, the incidence is the proportion of affected individuals, which is q². So for Caucasians, q² = 1/2000. So q is sqrt(1/2000) which is 1/sqrt(2000). Let me compute that: sqrt(2000) is about 44.72, so 1/44.72 is approximately 0.02236, so 2.24% as carriers. So the carrier rate is about 2.24% in Caucasians.

Wait, no! Wait, wait a second. No, wait: for a recessive disease, the incidence (affected) is q². So the carrier frequency is 2pq, where p is the dominant allele frequency and q the recessive. But if the disease is rare, p is approximately 1. So 2pq ≈ 2q, since p is about 1. So the carrier frequency is roughly twice the square root of the incidence. Wait no, wait, let me think again. Let me clarify.

If the incidence is q², then q is sqrt(incidence). The carrier frequency is 2pq. Since p = 1 - q, and if q is small, p ≈1, so 2pq ≈ 2q. So carrier frequency ≈ 2 * sqrt(incidence).

So for Caucasians, incidence is 1/2000, so q = sqrt(1/2000) ≈ 0.02236. So carrier frequency is about 2 * 0.02236 ≈ 4.47%, or roughly 4.5%.

Wait no, wait. Let me do it properly. Let me not approximate.

For Caucasians: incidence (q²) = 1/2000. So q = sqrt(1/2000) = (1/2000)^0.5. 2000 is 2e3, so sqrt(2e3) is sqrt(2)*sqrt(1e3)= ~1.414*31.62 ≈44.72. So q ≈1/44.72≈0.02236, or 2.236%. So the carrier rate is 2pq, but p =1-q ≈ 0.97764. So 2 * 0.97764 * 0.02236 ≈ 0.0435, or 4.35% carriers.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the incidence is the percentage of people affected, which is q². So if q² is 1/2000, then q is 1/sqrt(2000) ≈ 0.02236. The carrier frequency is 2pq, which when q is small, p ≈1, so 2q. So 2 * 0.02236 ≈ 0.0447, or 4.47% carriers. So about 4.5% of Caucasians are carriers.

Similarly, for nonwhites, incidence is 1/250,000. So q² = 1/250,000. So q = 1/sqrt(250,000). Let me compute sqrt(250,000). 250,000 is 2.5e5. The square root is sqrt(2.5)*1e2.5. Wait, sqrt(25e4) is 500, but 250,000 is 2.5e5. So sqrt(2.5e5)= sqrt(2.5)*sqrt(1e5)= approx 1.5811 * 316.23 ≈ 500. So wait, 500^2 is 250,000, so sqrt(250,000)=500. So q=1/500=0.002, or 0.2%. So q=0.2%. Then the carrier frequency is 2pq≈ 2q, which is 0.4%, because p≈1.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 2pq precisely. Since q is 0.002, p=0.998. So 2 * 0.998 *0.002= 0.003992, so approximately 0.4%, yes.

So now, when a Caucasian and a nonwhite mate, what is the probability their child has cystic fibrosis?

Well, each parent gives one allele. The Caucasian parent has a carrier frequency of about 4.5%, so the chance they pass on the defective allele is 0.045 (since they're carriers, they have one copy). Wait, no— Wait, if the Caucasian has a carrier frequency of 4.5%, that's the chance they carry one defective allele. So the chance a Caucasian mate is a carrier is 4.5%, so the chance they pass the defective allele is 0.045 * 0.5 = 0.0225. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

If a person is a carrier, they have a 50% chance of passing the defective allele to each child. So the probability the Caucasian parent is a carrier is 4.5%, so the chance they pass the defective allele is 0.045 * 0.5 = 0.0225, or 2.25%.

Similarly, the nonwhite parent has a carrier frequency of 0.4%, so the chance they pass the defective allele is 0.004 * 0.5 = 0.002, or 0.2%.

So the chance that both parents pass the defective allele is the product of their probabilities. So 0.0225 * 0.002 = 0.000045, which is 4.5e-5. That's 0.0045%, which is 1 in 22,222.22... So the incidence would be about 1 in 22,222 births. Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Wait, the first part of the question is "what would be the rate of incidence among matings between Caucasians and nonwhites?" So that would be the chance that both parents pass a defective allele, so the child has two copies, hence the disease.

So the calculation gives 0.0225 * 0.002 = 0.000045, which is 4.5e-5. So 1 divided by (1/0.000045) is approximately 22,222.22. So 1 in 22,222. Let me look at the options to see if any match this.

Looking at the options, option I says 1 in 22,000 births for the first part. That's very close to our calculation. So option I is a candidate.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the carrier frequencies.

Wait, for the Caucasians: incidence is 1/2000 = q². So q = sqrt(1/2000) ≈ 0.02236. So the carrier frequency is 2pq, which is 2*(1-q)*q ≈ 2q (since q is small). So 2*0.02236 ≈ 0.0447, so 4.47% carriers.

For nonwhites: incidence 1/250,000 = q², so q = 1/sqrt(250,000) = 1/500 = 0.002. So carrier frequency is 2pq ≈ 2*0.002 = 0.004, so 0.4%.

So when a Caucasian (carrier rate 4.47%) and nonwhite (carrier rate 0.4%) have a child, the chance the child gets the disease is:

Caucasian is carrier: 0.0447 → probability to pass allele: 0.5 *0.0447 = 0.02235.

Nonwhite is carrier: 0.004 → probability to pass allele: 0.5*0.004=0.002.

So the joint probability is 0.02235 * 0.002 = 0.0000447, which is 4.47e-5, so 1 in 22,366. So approximately 1 in 22,400. The option I says 1 in 22,000, which is close.

Wait, but option I's first part is 1 in 22,000. So that's our first answer.

Now the second part: If these offspring were to mate randomly among themselves, what incidence would be expected among their offspring.

Hmm. So the first generation is the offspring of Caucasians and nonwhites. Let's call them generation F1.

Each F1 individual has a certain probability of being a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Wait, but Wait, if the F1 individuals are the product of a Caucasian and a nonwhite, their genotype may vary.

Wait, but in the F1, each individual could be:

- From a Caucasian parent who is not a carrier (probability 95.5%) and a nonwhite parent who is not a carrier (99.6% not carriers), so child would be non-carrier and not have the disease.

But the chance that the F1 child is affected is what we calculated before, 1 in 22,000. But the question is about the carrier rate in the F1 population.

Wait, no, more accurately, the F1 population's allele frequency will depend on the parental allele frequencies.

Wait, let's think about the allele frequencies. Let me model this.

Let’s denote the frequency of the recessive allele (disease allele) in Caucasians as q1, and in nonwhites as q2.

From before:

For Caucasians, q1 = sqrt(1/2000) ≈ 0.02236.

For nonwhites, q2 = sqrt(1/250000) ≈ 0.002.

When they mate, each child gets one allele from each parent. So the allele frequency in the F1 generation would be the average of the two parents' allele frequencies.

Wait, because each parent contributes one allele. So for each child, the chance they get the q allele from the Caucasian parent is q1, and from the nonwhite parent is q2. So the overall frequency of q in F1 is (q1 + q2)/2.

So q_F1 = (0.02236 + 0.002)/2 = (0.02436)/2 = 0.01218, so approximately 1.218%.

Now, when these F1 individuals mate among themselves, the incidence of the disease in their offspring (F2) would be q_F1 squared, because it's a recessive disease, so both alleles need to be q.

So q_F1² = (0.01218)^2 ≈ 0.0001486, which is approximately 1.486e-4. So the incidence would be about 1 in 6,726 births.

Looking at the options, option I's second part is 1 in 6,700, which is very close. So option I would be the correct choice.

So putting it all together: the first incidence is approximately 1 in 22,000, and the second is approximately 1 in 6,700, which matches option I.
</think>

The question involves determining the incidence of cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder, among offspring of matings between Caucasians and nonwhites, and then among the offspring of these matings when they mate randomly among themselves.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Incidence and Carrier Frequency in Caucasians and Nonwhites**:
   - In Caucasians, the incidence of cystic fibrosis is 1 in 2,000 births. For a recessive disease, the incidence is \( q^2 \), where \( q \) is the frequency of the recessive allele. Thus, \( q = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2000}} \approx 0.02236 \), or 2.24%. The carrier frequency is approximately \( 2q \), which is \( 2 \times 0.02236 \approx 0.0447 \), or 4.47%.
   - In nonwhites, the incidence is 1 in 250,000 births. Similarly, \( q = \sqrt{\frac{1}{250,000}} \approx 0.002 \), or 0.2%. The carrier frequency is approximately \( 2q \), which is \( 2 \times 0.002 = 0.004 \), or 0.4%.

2. **Incidence Among Matings Between Caucasians and Nonwhites**:
   - The probability that a Caucasian parent passes the defective allele is \( 0.5 \times 0.0447 = 0.02235 \), or 2.235%.
   - The probability that a nonwhite parent passes the defective allele is \( 0.5 \times 0.004 = 0.002 \), or 0.2%.
   - The probability that both parents pass the defective allele, resulting in an affected child, is \( 0.02235 \times 0.002 = 0.0000447 \), or \( 4.47 \times 10^{-5} \). This corresponds to an incidence of approximately 1 in 22,222 births. Among the options, the closest match is 1 in 22,000 births.

3. **Incidence Among Offspring of F1 Individuals Mating Randomly**:
   - The allele frequency in the F1 generation is the average of the allele frequencies of the two parental populations: 
     \[
     q_{F1} = \frac{q_1 + q_2}{2} = \frac{0.02236 + 0.002}{2} = 0.01218, \text{ or } 1.218\%.
     \]
   - When F1 individuals mate randomly, the incidence of cystic fibrosis in their offspring is \( q_{F1}^2 \):
     \[
     q_{F1}^2 = (0.01218)^2 \approx 0.0001486, \text{ or } 1.486 \times 10^{-4}.
     \]
     This corresponds to an incidence of approximately 1 in 6,726 births. Among the options, the closest match is 1 in 6,700 births.

### Conclusion:
The incidence of cystic fibrosis among matings between Caucasians and nonwhites is approximately 1 in 22,000 births, and among the offspring of these matings, the incidence is approximately 1 in 6,700 births. These values match **Option I**.
