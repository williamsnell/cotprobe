Okay, so I have this economics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about exchange rates and arbitrage. There are two parts, a) and b), so I'll tackle them one by one.

First, part a) asks: What should the price of a British pound be in terms of German marks? 

I remember that exchange rates can be a bit tricky because they're often presented in terms of how much one currency is worth in another. So if the price of a British pound is $2.00, that means one pound equals two dollars. Similarly, a German mark is priced at $0.40, so one mark equals 0.40 dollars.

Wait, no, actually, wait. I think I might have that backwards. When they say the price of a pound is $2.00, that probably means that you can buy one pound by paying $2.00. Similarly, one mark costs $0.40. So each mark is cheaper in dollars than the pound.

So, to find out how many German marks equal one British pound, I should probably convert pounds to marks using their dollar values. Let me think. Since one pound is $2.00 and one mark is $0.40, how many marks would equal a pound?

I can set this up as an equation. Let me call the number of marks per pound as X. So, 1 pound = $2.00, and 1 mark = $0.40. Therefore, 1 pound = (2.00 / 0.40) marks. 

Calculating that, 2 divided by 0.4 is 5. So, 1 pound equals 5 marks. That makes sense because each mark is a fraction of a dollar, so more marks per pound.

So the answer to part a) should be 5 marks. Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option B says 5 marks, $0.40. Wait, no. Option E is 5 marks, $0.50. Hmm, wait. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, part a) is only about the pound in terms of marks, so I think the dollar part in the options might be for part b). Or maybe each option includes both a) and b). I'll keep that in mind.

Now, moving to part b): If the market was paying 6 marks for every British pound, how might an Englishman make an arbitrage profit?

Arbitrage profit happens when there's a price difference in different markets. So, the correct exchange rate from part a) is 5 marks per pound, but the market is offering 6 marks. That means someone is willing to pay more marks than the actual rate for a pound. 

An Englishman could exploit this. Let me think. He could buy pounds with marks at the correct rate (5 marks per pound) and then sell them in the market where he gets 6 marks per pound. Wait, no, because if the market is paying 6 marks per pound, that would mean that the market is buying pounds for 6 marks each. So, if he can get pounds cheaper elsewhere and sell them at the higher market rate, he can make a profit.

Wait, maybe the opposite. Suppose he can sell pounds in a market where he gets 6 marks per pound. So, he could buy pounds at the correct rate (5 marks) and sell them where he gets 6, making a profit of 1 mark per pound.

Alternatively, perhaps he can take advantage of the cross exchange rates. Let me think again. The correct rate is 5 marks per pound. If the market is offering 6 marks per pound, the Englishman can sell pounds for more marks than they're worth. So, how would he do that?

Alternatively, perhaps the Englishman can buy German marks with pounds where the rate is better. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of dollars as well.

Wait, the exchange rates given are in dollars. So, one pound is $2.00 and one mark is $0.40. So, 1 pound equals 5 marks because 2 / 0.4 is 5.

If the market is paying 6 marks per pound, that's higher than the equilibrium rate. So, the Englishman can take advantage by selling pounds where they get more marks than they should.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think of the steps an Englishman (who has pounds) would take.

1. He can exchange his pounds into dollars. Since 1 pound = $2.00, he can get dollars at that rate.

2. Then, he can use those dollars to buy German marks. Since 1 mark costs $0.40, $2.00 can buy 5 marks (2 / 0.4 = 5).

But wait, if the market is offering 6 marks for each pound, he can do better. So, he can exchange his pounds directly into marks at the market rate of 6, getting 6 marks per pound. But wait, the correct rate is 5 marks per pound. So, he's getting more marks than he should, which means he's effectively getting a better deal.

Alternatively, perhaps he can do the following: sell pounds for marks at the higher rate, then convert those marks back into pounds at the correct rate, making a profit.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's say he has pounds and wants to make a profit. He can sell his pounds for marks at the market rate of 6 marks per pound. Then, he can take those marks and convert them back into pounds at the correct rate.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because he's converting back. Alternatively, perhaps he can buy marks with pounds at a cheaper rate elsewhere and then sell them at a higher rate in this market.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

- He buys German marks using pounds at the correct rate. Since 1 pound = 5 marks, he can buy 5 marks for 1 pound.

- Then, he sells those 5 marks in a market that's paying 6 marks per pound. Wait, no, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps he can borrow pounds, exchange them into marks at the higher rate, then use those marks to buy more pounds than before.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of steps. Let's say he has £1.

At the correct rate, £1 = 5 marks. But the market is paying 6 marks for £1. So, he can exchange his £1 into 6 marks. But where can he get a better deal elsewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps he can take his pounds, exchange them into dollars, then into marks, and then back into pounds, making a profit at each step.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose he has £1.

Step 1: Exchange £1 into dollars. At $2.00 per pound, he gets $2.00.

Step 2: Exchange $2.00 into German marks. Since each mark is $0.40, $2.00 buys 5 marks (2 / 0.4 =5).

Step 3: Now, he has 5 marks. He can exchange these 5 marks back into pounds. But wait, the correct rate is 1 mark = 0.4 dollars, so 5 marks equal $2.00. Exchanging $2.00 back into pounds gives him £1. So that's just breaking even.

But wait, the market is paying 6 marks per pound. So, perhaps he can take his 5 marks and exchange them at a rate where he gets more pounds than he should.

Wait, maybe he can sell the 5 marks in a market where each mark is sold for more pounds than the correct rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the arbitrage involves the cross rate. Let me think of the cross exchange rate between pounds and marks. The correct rate is 5 marks per pound. If the market is offering 6 marks per pound, that's a higher number of marks than it should be. So, the pound is stronger in the market than it should be. So, an Englishman can sell pounds for more marks than they're worth.

Wait, so perhaps the process is: he can sell his pounds for 6 marks each, then use those marks to buy back pounds at the correct exchange rate, which would give him more pounds than he started with.

Wait, let's try that. Suppose he has 1 pound.

He sells it for 6 marks (because the market is paying 6 marks per pound). Now he has 6 marks.

At the correct rate, 5 marks can buy 1 pound. So, with 6 marks, he can buy 6/5 = 1.2 pounds.

So, he started with 1 pound, sold it for 6 marks, then used those 6 marks to buy back 1.2 pounds. He made a profit of 0.2 pounds.

That makes sense. So, the Englishman can profit by selling pounds at the higher market rate, then using those marks to buy more pounds than he started with.

Looking back at the options for part b), which asks how he might make the arbitrage profit. The options are combinations for a) and b), I think. So, looking for the option where a) is 5 marks, and the arbitrage involves selling pounds for 6 marks.

Wait, each option gives two answers: one for a) and one for b). So, the correct option should have a) as 5 marks, and b) something about exchanging at 6 marks.

Looking at the options, option E is a)5 marks, b)$0.50. Option I is a)6 marks, b)$0.50. Option J is a)6, b)$0.33. Option B is a)5, b)$0.40.

Wait, but in part b), the arbitrage would involve selling pounds for 6 marks. So, looking at the options, perhaps the correct part a) is 5 marks, so options B, E, and others.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: a)5 marks, b)$0.40.

Option E: a)5 marks, b)$0.50.

Option I: a)6, b)$0.50.

So, the correct a) is 5 marks, so options B or E.

But in part b), the arbitrage is possible when the market is giving 6 marks per pound, which is higher than the correct rate of 5. So, the Englishman can buy pounds with marks at 5 and sell them at 6. Or perhaps buy marks with pounds at 5 and sell them elsewhere at 6. Wait, no, because the market is giving 6 marks per pound, so he can sell pounds for more marks.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

He can buy pounds at the correct rate (5 marks per pound) and sell them at the market rate (6 marks per pound), making a profit of 1 mark per pound.

But how would that work? Let me think again.

If the correct cross rate is 5 marks per pound, but the market is offering 6, the Englishman can take advantage by somehow buying low and selling high.

Wait, perhaps he can do the following:

1. Borrow 5 marks.

2. Exchange those 5 marks into pounds at the correct rate. Since 5 marks = £1 (because 5 marks equal $2.00, which is 1 pound), so 5 marks get him 1 pound.

3. Then, he sells that 1 pound in the market where he gets 6 marks for it.

So, he started with 5 marks, turned them into 1 pound, then sold that pound for 6 marks. So, he makes a profit of 1 mark. That's arbitrage.

So, the Englishman can make a profit by exchanging 5 marks into 1 pound, then selling that pound for 6 marks, netting 1 extra mark.

Therefore, the correct answer for part b) is that the Englishman sells pounds at the higher rate, making a profit.

Looking back at the options, the one where a) is 5 marks and part b) is something related to selling pounds for 6 marks.

Wait, the options for part b) might be giving the amount in dollars or marks. Wait, the options seem to list two things for each option. For example, option I is a)6 marks, b)$0.50.

Wait, perhaps the second part of each option is the profit per pound or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read the question again.

The options are labeled A to J, each with two values. The question says for part a) and part b), so each option gives an answer for both a) and b).

Wait, no, the question wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me look again.

The question is:

a) What should the price of a British pound be in terms of German marks?

b) If the market was paying 6 marks for every British pound, how might an Englishman make an arbitrage profit?

The options are each a combination, perhaps a) is the first value, and b) is the second.

So, the correct answers would be a)5 marks, and for part b), the arbitrage would involve selling pounds at 6 marks.

But looking at the options, I think the second part refers to how much profit in dollars or something else. Or perhaps the second part is the exchange rate in dollars per mark.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In part a), the correct answer is 5 marks per pound. So, looking for options where the first part is 5 marks.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 5 marks, $0.40

Option E:5 marks, $0.50

Option B's second part is $0.40, which might be the price of a mark in dollars, but I thought the mark was $0.40 already. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the second part refers to the profit. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second part refers to how much a mark is worth in dollars. Since a mark is $0.40, perhaps the correct option has that.

Wait, but the correct a) is 5 marks per pound, and the second part is about the arbitrage. So, perhaps the correct option is B:5 marks, $0.40, but I'm not sure how that ties into part b).

Alternatively, perhaps part b) refers to the amount in dollars that the Englishman can make per pound. Let me think: in the arbitrage, he makes 1 mark per pound. Since each mark is $0.40, the profit per pound is $0.40.

So, the profit is $0.40 per pound. So, part b) would be $0.40, which is option B's second value. So, the correct option would be B: a)5 marks, b)$0.40.

Alternatively, perhaps the profit is calculated differently. Let me go through the arbitrage steps again.

He starts with 5 marks. He exchanges them for 1 pound (since 5 marks = $2.00, which is 1 pound). Then, he sells that 1 pound for 6 marks. So, he started with 5 marks, ended with 6, making a profit of 1 mark. Each mark is worth $0.40, so his profit is 1 * $0.40 = $0.40 per pound.

So, yes, that would match option B: a)5 marks, b)$0.40.

Wait, but option E is a)5 marks, b)$0.50. Hmm. Where would $0.50 come from? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's see: 1 mark is $0.40, so 1 mark profit equals $0.40. But perhaps the profit is per pound in dollars.

Wait, when he sells the pound for 6 marks, each mark is worth $0.40, so 6 marks equal 6 * 0.40 = $2.40. But he bought the pound for 5 marks, which is 5 * 0.40 = $2.00. So, the profit is $2.40 - $2.00 = $0.40 per pound. So, that's correct.

So, the arbitrage profit is $0.40 per pound. So, part b)'s answer is $0.40, which is option B's second part.

So, the correct option is B: a)5 marks, b)$0.40.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in the arbitrage, he makes 1 mark, which is $0.40, so yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check other options to make sure.

Option E: a)5 marks, b)$0.50.

Where would $0.50 come from? If he made a 1.25 mark profit, that would be 1.25 * 0.40 = $0.50, but that doesn't align with the earlier calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recalculate.

When he sells the pound for 6 marks, each mark is $0.40, so 6 marks = 6 * 0.40 = $2.40.

He bought the pound for 5 marks, which is 5 * 0.40 = $2.00.

So, his profit is $2.40 - $2.00 = $0.40.

Yes, that seems correct. So, part b)'s answer is $0.40, which is option B.

Wait, but looking again at the options:

Option B: 5 marks, $0.40

Option E:5 marks, $0.50

So, the correct answer for part a) is 5 marks, and for part b), $0.40 profit, so option B.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the exchange rates and arbitrage opportunity systematically:

### Part (a): What should the price of a British pound be in terms of German marks?
- The price of 1 British pound is $2.00, and the price of 1 German mark is $0.40.
- To find the exchange rate between pounds and marks, we calculate how many marks are equivalent to $2.00:
  \[
  \text{Marks per pound} = \frac{\$2.00}{\$0.40} = 5 \text{ marks}.
  \]
Thus, 1 British pound should be worth **5 German marks**.

### Part (b): Arbitrage Profit
- The market is paying 6 marks for every British pound, which is higher than the equilibrium rate of 5 marks per pound.
- An Englishman can exploit this by:
  1. Selling 1 British pound for 6 marks in the market.
  2. Using those 6 marks to buy back British pounds at the equilibrium rate of 5 marks per pound:
     \[
     \text{Pounds bought} = \frac{6 \text{ marks}}{5 \text{ marks per pound}} = 1.2 \
