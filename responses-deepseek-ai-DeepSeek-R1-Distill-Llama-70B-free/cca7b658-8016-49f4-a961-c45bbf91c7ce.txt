Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It's about equilibrium concentrations involving H2S and some ions. The problem gives me two reactions with their equilibrium constants, k1 and k2. I need to find the final concentration of S²⁻ given the concentrations of H3O+ and H2S.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. The first reaction is H2S + H2O ⇌ H3O+ + HS⁻, and the second is HS⁻ + H2O ⇌ H3O+ + S²⁻. Both reactions are in equilibrium, so their equilibrium constants are given. The concentrations I know are [H3O+] = 0.3 M and [H2S] = 0.1 M. I need to find [S²⁻].

Wait, so the problem is about two consecutive dissociation steps of H2S. H2S first dissociates into H+ (as H3O+) and HS⁻, and then HS⁻ can further dissociate into H+ and S²⁻. So, the overall process is H2S losing two protons to form S²⁻.

I remember that for such stepwise equilibria, the overall equilibrium constant is the product of the individual constants. So maybe I should find the overall K for the entire reaction and then use that to find [S²⁻].

Let me think about the reactions. The first reaction has k1 = 6.3e-8, and the second has k2 = 1e-14. So the overall reaction would be H2S + 2H2O ⇌ 2H3O+ + S²⁻. So combining the two steps, the overall K would be k1 * k2, right? Because each step contributes their own K.

So calculating that, K_total = (6.3e-8) * (1e-14) = 6.3e-22.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way. Let me make sure. Each reaction's K is [products]/[reactants]. So for the first step, K1 = [H3O+][HS⁻] / [H2S][H2O]. Similarly, K2 = [H3O+][S²⁻] / [HS⁻][H2O]. So when we multiply K1*K2, we get ([H3O+]^2 [HS⁻][S²⁻]) / ([H2S][HS⁻][H2O]^2). The HS⁻ cancels out, so it's [H3O+]^2 [S²⁻] / ([H2S][H2O]^2) = K1*K2. Hmm, but in the overall reaction, H2O is a reactant, but since it's a solvent, its concentration is considered constant and is incorporated into the K values. So perhaps the overall K is indeed K1*K2.

So K_overall = K1 * K2 = 6.3e-8 * 1e-14 = 6.3e-22.

Now, the overall reaction is H2S → 2 H+ + S²⁻. But wait, in the problem, the concentrations given are [H3O+] and [H2S], so I should probably set up an expression using these.

Wait, but in the problem, the [H3O+] is given as 0.3 M. Since H3O+ is H+ in solution, and the second dissociation step contributes another H+. So the total [H+] is from both steps. But wait, in the first step, each H2S that dissociates gives one H3O+, and the second step each HS⁻ gives another H3O+.

Wait, but in the problem statement, I'm given [H3O+] as 0.3 M. So that's the total [H+] from all sources. But in this case, maybe we can assume that [H3O+] is much larger than what comes from the dissociation of H2S. But I'm not sure. Let's proceed.

The overall equilibrium expression would be K_overall = ([H3O+]^2 [S²⁻]) / ([H2S][H2O]^2). But since [H2O] is a solvent and is constant, it's incorporated into the K, so K_overall = ([H3O+]^2 [S²⁻]) / [H2S].

Plugging in the values, 6.3e-22 = (0.3^2 * [S²⁻]) / 0.1.

Let me compute the numerator on the right. 0.3 squared is 0.09. So:

6.3e-22 = (0.09 * [S²⁻]) / 0.1.

Multiply both sides by 0.1:

6.3e-22 * 0.1 = 0.09 * [S²⁻]

So 6.3e-23 = 0.09 [S²⁻]

Divide both sides by 0.09:

[S²⁻] = (6.3e-23) / 0.09 = approximately 7e-22 M. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match 7e-22. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K_overall. Let me go back.

Wait, K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants for each step. So K1 = [H3O+][HS⁻]/[H2S], K2 = [H3O+][S²⁻]/[HS⁻]. So when I multiply K1*K2, I get ([H3O+]^2 [HS⁻][S²⁻])/([H2S][HS⁻]) ) = ([H3O+]^2 [S²⁻])/[H2S] = K1*K2.

So yes, K_overall is indeed K1*K2 = 6.3e-8 * 1e-14 = 6.3e-22.

So the setup is correct.

So [S²⁻] = (K_overall * [H2S]) ) / ([H3O+]^2 )

Wait, no, K_overall = ([H3O+]^2 [S²⁻])/[H2S] = 6.3e-22.

So rearranging, [S²⁻] = (K_overall * [H2S]) ) / ([H3O+]^2 )

Plugging in the numbers:

[S²⁻] = (6.3e-22 * 0.1) / (0.3)^2.

Compute denominator: 0.3^2 = 0.09.

Numerator: 6.3e-22 * 0.1 = 6.3e-23.

So [S²⁻] = 6.3e-23 / 0.09 = (6.3 / 0.09) * 1e-23.

6.3 divided by 0.09 is 70, because 0.09 *70 = 6.3.

So 70e-23 is 7e-22 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 9e-23, which is 0.9e-22. Option B is 8.1e-9. Option D is 1.2e-21. Hmm, none of these match 7e-22. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate.

Wait let me compute 6.3e-23 divided by 0.09:

6.3e-23 / 0.09 = (6.3 / 0.09) * 1e-23.

6.3 / 0.09 = 70. So 70 * 1e-23 = 7e-22 M.

Looking at the options, I don't see 7e-22. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.3 M

B: 8.1 × 10^-9 M

C: 9 × 10^-23 M

D: 1.2 × 10^-21 M

E: 7 × 10^22 M

F: 1 × 10^14 M

G: 4.2 × 10^-14 M

H: 5 × 10^-15 M

I: 2 × 10^-7 M

J: 6.3 × 10^8 M

Wait, I'm getting 7e-22, which isn't listed. Hmm. Did I miscalculate K_overall?

Wait, K1 is 6.3e-8, K2 is 1e-14. So K1*K2 = 6.3e-22. That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should express the overall reaction differently. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should consider the stepwise approach without combining the reactions. Let's see.

First, the first equilibrium is H2S ⇌ H+ + HS⁻, and the second is HS⁻ ⇌ H+ + S²⁻.

So for the first step, K1 = [H+][HS⁻]/[H2S].

For the second step, K2 = [H+][S²⁻]/[HS⁻].

Multiplying these, K_total = K1*K2 = ([H+]^2 [HS⁻][S²⁻]) / ([H2S][HS⁻]) ) = [H+]^2 [S²⁻]/[H2S].

So same as before.

So K_total = [H+]^2 [S²⁻]/ [H2S] = K1*K2.

Given [H+] is 0.3 M, [H2S] is 0.1 M.

Plugging into K_total: 0.3^2 * [S²⁻] / 0.1 = K1*K2.

So 0.09 * [S²⁻] / 0.1 = 6.3e-22.

So 0.09/0.1 is 0.9. So [S²⁻] = (6.3e-22 * 0.1) / 0.09.

Wait, that's the same as before. So [S²⁻] = (6.3e-23) / 0.09 = 7e-22. But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately. Let me compute 6.3e-23 divided by 0.09.

6.3e-23 / 0.09 = (6.3 / 0.09) * 1e-23 = 70 * 1e-23 = 7e-22 M.

But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given [H3O+] is the total concentration from both steps.

Wait, wait. Because in the first step, [H3O+] comes from H2S dissociation, and in the second step, more H3O+ comes from HS⁻ dissociation. So the total [H3O+] = [H3O+] from first step + [H3O+] from second step.

But wait, in the first step, each H2S that dissociates gives one H3O+ and one HS⁻. In the second step, each HS⁻ that dissociates gives another H3O+ and S²⁻. So the total [H3O+] is the sum from both steps.

Wait, but in that case, the [H3O+] given as 0.3 M would be equal to [H+] from first step (let's say x) plus [H+] from second step (y), so 0.3 = x + y.

But H2S is a weak acid, so in the first step, [HS⁻] = x, and in the second step, [S²⁻] = y.

Wait, this seems more complicated. Maybe the initial approach was incorrect because I assumed [H3O+] is 0.3 M, which is the total [H+], but in reality, each step contributes to it.

So perhaps I should model it more accurately.

Let me define:

Let x be the concentration of HS⁻ produced from the first dissociation. So, [H+]=x from the first step, and [HS⁻]=x.

Then, the second step: HS⁻ dissociates into H+ and S²⁻. Let y be the concentration of S²⁻, so [H+] from the second step is y, and [S²⁻]=y.

So total [H+] = x + y = 0.3 M.

But I also know that the first dissociation gives x, so K1 = (x * x) / [H2S] = x² / (0.1) = 6.3e-8.

Wait, no. Because [H2S] is 0.1 M, and the first dissociation is H2S ⇌ H+ + HS⁻. So K1 = [H+][HS⁻] / [H2S] = (x)(x) / (0.1) = x² / 0.1 = 6.3e-8.

So x² = 6.3e-8 * 0.1 = 6.3e-9.

x = sqrt(6.3e-9) ≈ 7.94e-5 M.

So [H+] from first step is x ≈ 7.94e-5 M.

Then, the second step: HS⁻ ⇌ H+ + S²⁻. K2 = [H+][S²⁻] / [HS⁻] = (y)(y) / (x) = y² / x = 1e-14.

Wait, because in the second step, [HS⁻] is x, and [H+] is y, and [S²⁻] is y.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the total [H+] is x + y = 0.3.

But from the first step, x is about 7.94e-5, which is much smaller than 0.3. So y would be approximately 0.3 M, but that can't be right because that would make y much larger than x, which would mean that K2 is very small, making y negligible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the second dissociation is so slight that y is much smaller than x. Or maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, K2 is 1e-14, which is very small, so the second dissociation doesn't release much H+. Therefore, y would be very small compared to x. So perhaps x is approximately 0.3 M, and y is negligible.

Wait, but earlier calculation of x from K1 gave x ≈7.94e-5, which is much less than 0.3. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and I can't ignore y.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that [H+] is dominated by the first step is incorrect, especially if the second step contributes significantly.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should use the approach of combining the two steps into the overall reaction. But then I have to account for the fact that [H+] is 0.3 M from both steps.

Wait, perhaps I should let [H+] = 0.3 M, and then express everything in terms of that.

Wait, K1 = [H+][HS⁻]/[H2S] → HS⁻ = (K1 [H2S])/[H+].

Similarly, K2 = [H+][S²⁻]/[HS⁻] → [S²⁻] = (K2 [HS⁻])/[H+].

Substituting HS⁻ from the first into the second:

[S²⁻] = K2 * (K1 [H2S]/[H+]) / [H+] = (K1 K2 [H2S]) / [H+]^2.

So [S²⁻] = (6.3e-8 * 1e-14 * 0.1) / (0.3)^2.

Compute numerator: 6.3e-8 * 1e-14 = 6.3e-22, times 0.1 is 6.3e-23.

Denominator: 0.09.

So [S²⁻] = 6.3e-23 / 0.09 = 7e-22 M.

But again, that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, let's look at the options again. Option C is 9e-23, which is 9 times 1e-23. My calculation is 7e-22, which is 70 times 1e-22 or 7e-22. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let's compute 6.3e-23 divided by 0.09.

6.3e-23 / 0.09 = (6.3 / 0.09) * 1e-23.

6.3 / 0.09 is 70, so 70 * 1e-23 = 7e-22 M.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to treat the two equilibria step by step, taking into account the contributions to [H+]. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the second dissociation is negligible, so [H3O+] is approximately equal to the [H+] from the first dissociation. But in that case, [H+] would be x, and x is 7.94e-5, but the problem states [H3O+] is 0.3 M, which is much higher. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the [H3O+] given includes contributions from both steps. So [H3O+] = x + y = 0.3 M.

But we have K1 = x^2 / 0.1 = 6.3e-8 → x^2 = 6.3e-8 * 0.1 = 6.3e-9 → x= ~7.94e-5 M.

Then, K2 = y * (x + y) / (x - y) ?

Wait, no. Because in the second step, [HS⁻] = x -
