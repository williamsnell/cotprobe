Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the roots of a cubic equation using Graeffe's root squaring method and then summing them up. Hmm, I remember that Graeffe's method is an iterative technique used to find the roots of a polynomial. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so I need to think this through.

The equation given is x³ + 3x² -4 =0. They asked for the sum of the roots correct to two decimals. Wait, but I also remember something about Vieta's formulas, right? Vieta's relates the coefficients of a polynomial to the sums and products of its roots. For a cubic equation like x³ + ax² + bx + c =0, the sum of the roots is -a. Oh wait, in this equation, a is 3. So the sum should be -3. Looking at the options, J is -3. But wait, the question says to apply Graeffe's method, so maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the point is to find the roots using Graeffe's method and then sum them, but according to Vieta's, the sum is straightforward. So why do the calculation? Maybe the question is testing both knowledge of Vieta's and the method. Alternatively, perhaps the equation has some multiple roots or something that makes the sum different. But no, Vieta's formula applies regardless of the nature of the roots.

Wait, but let's make sure. The equation is x³ +3x² -4=0. So a is 3, so sum is -a, which is -3. So the answer should be J, -3. But maybe the real question is to compute the roots and sum them, but that's more work. But since the options include -3 as J, and Vieta's gives that directly, I think that's the way to go. So the answer is J.

The problem involves finding the sum of the roots of the cubic equation \( x^3 + 3x^2 - 4 = 0 \) using Graeffe's root squaring method. However, recalling Vieta's formulas provides a direct solution. For a cubic equation of the form \( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -a \). In this case, \( a = 3 \), so the sum of the roots is \( -3 \). This result aligns with option J. While Graeffe's method could be used to compute the roots iteratively, Vieta's formula simplifies the process and confirms the answer as \( -3 \).
