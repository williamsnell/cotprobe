The problem involves a proton traveling at an initial speed of \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) into a region with a constant magnetic field of magnitude \( 1.5 \, \text{T} \). The proton's velocity vector makes an angle of \( 30^\circ \) with the magnetic field. The task is to compute the proton's speed 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field.

When a charged particle moves in a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field, given by the Lorentz force equation:
\[
\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}),
\]
where \( q \) is the charge of the particle, \( \mathbf{v} \) is its velocity, and \( \mathbf{B} \) is the magnetic field. This force causes the particle to undergo circular motion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, the speed of the particle remains constant because the magnetic force does no work on the particle.

The key insight here is that the magnetic field changes the direction of the proton's velocity but not its magnitude. Therefore, the speed of the proton remains the same as its initial speed, which is \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \).

To confirm this, we can analyze the components of the velocity. The proton's velocity can be resolved into two components:
1. A component parallel to the magnetic field (\( v_{\parallel} \)), which remains unchanged.
2. A component perpendicular to the magnetic field (\( v_{\perp} \)), which is affected by the magnetic field, causing circular motion.

The initial speed is given as \( v = 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \), and the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field is \( 30^\circ \). The perpendicular component of the velocity is:
\[
v_{\perp} = v \sin(30^\circ) = (1.5 \times 10^6) \times 0.5 = 0.75 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}.
\]
The parallel component is:
\[
v_{\parallel} = v \cos(30^\circ) = (1.5 \times 10^6) \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 1.3 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

While the perpendicular component will cause the proton to move in a circular path with a certain radius and period, the total speed of the proton remains the vector sum of the parallel and perpendicular components. Since the magnetic field does no work on the proton, the total speed remains constant.

Thus, after 4 seconds, the proton's speed is still \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \).

The correct answer is **E: \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \)**.
