Okay, so I've got this problem here about oil flowing through a pipe, and I need to find the pressure drop over the length of the tube for two different diameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the oil is flowing at an average velocity of 1.2 ft/s. The pipe is 100 ft long. They give the density of oil as 56 lb/ft³ and the kinematic viscosity ν as 5e-4 ft²/s. Oh right, and we're supposed to neglect the inlet and exit losses, so that simplifies things a bit because I don't have to consider those factors.

I remember that pressure drop in a pipe is usually calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is ΔP = f * (L/D) * (ρ * v²)/2, where f is the Darcy friction factor. But wait, to find f, I need to know if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Oh right, that's determined by the Reynolds number.

So the formula for Reynolds number (Re) is Re = v * D / ν. Let me calculate that.

First, for the 1/2 inch diameter pipe. I need to convert that to feet because the units have to be consistent. 1/2 inch is 0.5 inches, so since 1 ft = 12 inches, that's 0.5 / 12 = 0.041666 ft.

So Re for the first case is v * D / ν = 1.2 ft/s * 0.041666 ft / 5e-4 ft²/s.

Let me compute that. 1.2 * 0.041666 is approximately 0.05. Then divided by 5e-4 (which is 0.0005). So 0.05 / 0.0005 = 100. Oh, so Re is 100. That's well below 2000, so the flow is laminar.

In laminar flow, the friction factor f is 64 / Re. So f = 64 / 100 = 0.64.

Now plug into the Darcy-Weisbach equation: ΔP = f * (L/D) * (ρ v²)/2.

Wait, let's make sure I have the right formula. Oh, right, the formula is ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D).

So for the first part, L is 100 ft, D is 0.041666 ft, ρ is 56 lb/ft³, v is 1.2 ft/s.

Plugging in the numbers:

f is 0.64, L=100, D=0.041666, ρ=56, v=1.2.

So compute each part step by step.

First, (f * L) = 0.64 * 100 = 64.

Then, ρ * v² =56 * (1.2)^2. 1.2 squared is 1.44, so 56 *1.44. Let me calculate that: 56 *1.4 is 78.4, and 56*0.04 is 2.24, so total 80.64.

So now, 64 * 80.64 = let me see: 60*80.64=4838.4, and 4*80.64=322.56. Sum is 4838.4 + 322.56 = 5160.96.

Then divide by (2 * D). D is 0.041666, so 2*D is 0.083333.

So 5160.96 / 0.083333 ≈ let's see, 5160.96 divided by approximately 0.08333 is roughly 5160.96 * 12 (since 1/0.08333 is about 12). 5160.96 *12: 5000*12=60,000, 160.96*12=1931.52, so total 61831.52 lb/ft².

Wait, that's way too high. None of the options are that high. Did I mess up somewhere?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check.

Wait, the units for pressure in Darcy-Weisbach should be in consistent units. Since we're using lb/ft³ for density and ft for length, the pressure would be in lb/ft².

Wait, but maybe I should use the formula in terms of head loss first. Oh wait, no, the formula I used should give the pressure drop directly.

Wait, perhaps I did a calculation error. Let me re-calculate the steps.

Compute (f * L) = 0.64 * 100 = 64.

(ρ v²) =56 lb/ft³ * (1.2 ft/s)^2 =56 * 1.44 = 80.64 lb/(ft² s²) ?

Wait, the units for ΔP would be (lb/ft³) * (ft²/s²) ) * (ft) from L, divided by ft from D.

Wait, but let me think in terms of the equation again.

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 D)

Breaking down the units:

f is dimensionless.

L is in ft.

ρ is lb/ft³.

v² is ft²/s².

Multiply all together: (ft) * (lb/ft³) * (ft²/s²) ) = (lb * ft^0 * ft²/(s² ft³)) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should not get stuck on units and just proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: f * L * rho * v^2.

0.64 * 100 *56 * (1.2)^2.

Compute 0.64 *100=64.

64 *56=3584.

(1.2)^2=1.44.

So 3584 *1.44 = let's compute that. 3584 *1 =3584, 3584 *0.4=1433.6, 3584 *0.04=143.36. So 3584 +1433.6=5017.6 +143.36=5160.96.

Denominator is 2*D = 2*(1/2 in converted to ft)=2*(0.0416667 ft) = 0.083333 ft.

So 5160.96 / 0.083333 is approximately 5160.96 / 0.083333.

Hmm, 0.083333 is 1/12, so dividing by 1/12 is multiplying by 12.

So 5160.96 *12 = let's compute that.

5000 *12 =60,000.

160.96 *12: 160 *12=1920, 0.96 *12=11.52, so 1920+11.52=1931.52.

Total: 60,000 + 1,931.52=61,931.52 lb/ft².

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options given. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another thought: the Darcy-Weisbach equation gives the pressure drop, but perhaps I should have used the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow, which is for incompressible fluids. Oh wait, but Darcy-Weisbach is general, but for laminar flow, f=64/Re, which I used.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, another formula for pressure drop in laminar flow is ΔP = (8 * μ * v * L) / (π * r^4). But since I have ν (kinematic viscosity), which is ν = μ/ρ. So μ = ν * ρ.

So substituting in the formula:

ΔP = (8 * (ν ρ) * v * L) / (π * (D/2)^4 )

Wait, D is the diameter, so radius r is D/2.

So,

ΔP = (8 * ν * ρ * v * L) / ( π * (D/2)^4 )

Simplify the denominator: (D/2)^4 = D^4 / 16.

So,

ΔP = (8 * ν ρ v L * 16 ) / ( π D^4 )

Which is (128 ν ρ v L) / ( π D^4 )

Hmm, maybe that's a better approach.

Let me compute this way.

Given:

ν =5e-4 ft²/s,

ρ=56 lb/ft³,

v=1.2 ft/s,

L=100 ft,

D=0.041666 ft (1/2 inch).

Plugging in:

128 * 5e-4 *56 *1.2 *100 / ( π * (0.041666)^4 )

Compute each part step by step.

128 *5e-4 is 0.064.

0.064 *56=3.584.

3.584 *1.2=4.3008.

4.3008 *100=430.08.

Denominator: π*(0.041666)^4.

Compute 0.041666^4.

0.041666 is approx 1/24, since 1/24 ≈0.0416667.

So (1/24)^4 =1/(24^4) = 1/331776 ≈3.012e-6.

So denominator is π *3.012e-6 ≈ 9.442e-6.

So ΔP = 430.08 / 9.442e-6.

Compute that: 430.08 / 0.000009442 ≈ let's see.

Well, 430.08 / 9.442e-6 = approx 430.08 / 0.000009442.

So 430.08 / 0.000009442 ≈ let's compute 430.08 / 9.442e-6 = (430.08 / 9.442 ) * 1e6.

430.08 /9.442 is approximately 45.55.

So 45.55 *1e6 =45,550,000 lb/ft².

Wait, that can't be right. But wait, that's even higher than before. So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, maybe I messed up the units. Because the units in the second approach seem correct.

Wait, let me try the first approach again, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, in the first approach, using Darcy-Weisbach, I got about 61,931 lb/ft². But looking at the options, the highest for the first part is 2100 in option C.

Wait, that's way lower than my calculation. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for pressure drop in laminar flow is ΔP = (32 μ v L) / (D²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might have confused the formula.

Wait, I'm getting confused between the Darcy-Weisbach and other formulas. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the Reynolds number correctly.

Wait, let's recompute the Reynolds number.

Re = (v * D) / ν.

v=1.2 ft/s,

D=0.041666 ft,

ν=5e-4 ft²/s.

So Re = (1.2 * 0.0416667) / 5e-4.

Compute numerator: 1.2 * 0.0416667 ≈0.05.

So 0.05 / 5e-4 = 0.05 / 0.0005 = 100. So Re=100, correct, so laminar.

Then f=64/Re=0.64.

Then ΔP = (f L ρ v²)/(2 D).

So f=0.64, L=100, ρ=56, v=1.2, D=0.041666.

Compute numerator: 0.64 *100 =64.

64 *56=3584.

v²=1.44.

So 3584 *1.44 = 5160.96.

Denominator: 2*D=0.083333.

So 5160.96 /0.083333 = approx 61,931 lb/ft².

Hmm, but the options don't have anything near that. So maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure drop is expressed in a different unit, like psi instead of lb/ft². But the question says the options are in lb/ft².

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of 5160.96 divided by 0.083333.

Let me compute 5160.96 / 0.083333.

Well, 0.083333 is 1/12, so 5160.96 *12 = ?

5160.96 *12: 5000*12=60,000; 160.96*12=1,931.52. So total 61,931.52 lb/ft².

But that's way higher than any of the options. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²)/(2 D). But maybe I should have used the velocity in consistent units, but I think I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula in terms of the hydraulic diameter, but that's the same as D here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the kinematic viscosity. Given ν=5e-4 ft²/s, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the oil's density is given in lb mass per ft³, but in the formula, we need density in slugs. Oh wait, because in the formula, ρ is mass per unit volume, but in the imperial system, sometimes it's needed in slugs.

Wait, wait a second. Because in the formula, the pressure would be in lb/ft², but using ρ in lb/ft³ might not be correct because in the imperial system, ρ should be in slugs/ft³.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the ρ should be the mass density in slugs/ft³, not lb mass/ft³.

Oh! That's probably where I went wrong. Because I used ρ as 56 lb/ft³, but I should have converted that to slugs.

Wait, in imperial units, 1 slug = 32.174 lb mass per ft/s². So ρ in slugs/ft³ is (lb/ft³) / (32.174 lb·s⁻²·ft⁻¹) ) = lb/(ft³) * s²/(lb·ft) )= s²/(ft²·ft) ??? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's see: 1 slug/ft³ = (32.174 lb·s⁻²·ft⁻¹) / ft³ )? No, perhaps another approach.

Density in slugs per cubic foot is equal to density in lb mass per cubic foot divided by the acceleration due to gravity in ft/s². Since g is 32.174 ft/s².

So ρ (slugs/ft³) = 56 lb/ft³ / 32.174 lb·s⁻²·ft⁻¹ [g] = approx 1.742 slugs/ft³.

Wait, that makes sense because 56 /32 is about 1.75.

So I should have used ρ=1.742 slugs/ft³, not 56 lb/ft³.

Oh, that changes everything. So let me recalculate with the correct ρ.

So using ρ=56 lb/ft³ was the mistake. It should be in slugs, so divide by 32.174.

So let me compute ρ in slugs/ft³: 56 /32.174 ≈1.742 slugs/ft³.

Now, redoing the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 D).

So f=0.64, L=100 ft, ρ=1.742 slugs/ft³, v=1.2 ft/s, D=0.041666 ft.

Compute each part again.

f * L =0.64 *100=64.

ρ * v²=1.742 * (1.2)^2=1.742 *1.44= approx 2.506.

So 64 * 2.506= 160.384.

Divide by (2*D)=0.083333.

So 160.384 /0.083333 ≈1925 lb/ft².

That looks much better. Now, looking at the options, option A has 1925 for the first part, and option F has 1950, which is close. Wait, but my calculation is exactly 1925.

So for the first case, 1925 lb/ft².

Now the second part: when the diameter is 1 inch. So D=1 inch = 1/12 ft ≈0.083333 ft.

Compute Re again.

Re= v*D/ν =1.2 * 0.083333 /5e-4.

1.2 *0.083333≈0.1.

0.1 /5e-4= 0.1/0.0005=200.

So Re=200, which is still laminar, so f=64/200=0.32.

Now compute ΔP.

ΔP= (f L ρ v²)/(2 D).

f=0.32, L=100, ρ=1.742, v=1.2, D=0.083333.

Compute numerator: 0.32 *100=32.

32 *1.742=55.424.

55.424 * (1.2)^2 =55.424 *1.44=79.7216.

Denominator: 2*D=0.166666.

So 79.7216 /0.166666 ≈ approx 478.6 lb/ft².

Looking at the options, option A has 481.3 for the second part, which is close to my calculation of 478.6. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps when I approximated ρ as 1.742, I should be more precise. Let me compute it exactly.

Given ρ=56 lb/ft³, then in slugs, it's 56 /32.174 lb·s⁻²·ft⁻¹.

Compute 56 /32.174:

32.174 ×1.742 = approx 56. So it's about 1
