Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what a CPA usually does when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

First, I remember that when a CPA reviews financial statements, it's different from an audit. A review is less in depth than an audit, right? So the CPA's main goal is to provide limited assurance that there's nothing significantly wrong with the financials, like no material errors or misstatements.

The question is about a nonissuer, which I think means the company isn't publicly traded. So the rules might be a bit different compared to a public company. I'm trying to recall what procedures are typical in a review.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Make inquiries about cash restrictions. I think in a review, CPAs do make inquiries. They talk to management about things like cash availability because that's a key area. So this sounds plausible.

Option B: Examine trend analysis for detection risk. Trend analysis is more of an audit procedure where they look for unusual trends to assess risks. In a review, maybe they don't go that deep. Plus, detection risk is part of the audit risk model more than a review.

Option C: Physical inventory count. That's a substantive procedure, probably done in an audit to verify assets. In a review, I don't think they'd do physical counts; they might rely on other methods.

Option D: Market position and competitive advantage. That sounds more like strategic analysis, not something a CPA would typically do in a financial review. They might look at financial health, not the market position.

Option E: Management's plans for negative trends. I think this is part of management inquiries. CPAs might ask about how management is handling problems, so this could be a review procedure.

Option F: Inspect contracts for legal issues. That might be part of an audit, perhaps when assessing contingencies or legal liabilities, but in a review, maybe not so detailed.

Option G: Compliance with tax laws. I'm not sure if this is a standard part of a review. Maybe in an audit, especially if tax issues are material, but I don't think it's a usual part of a review.

Option H: Hiring practices and benefits. That seems more like HR consulting, not something a CPA would do during a financial review.

Option I: IT systems and cybersecurity. That's more of an audit of internal controls, maybe in a larger audit, but not typically part of a review unless it's specifically requested.

Option J: Communicate internal control deficiencies to audit committee. Wait, but the question is about a nonissuer, which might not have an audit committee. Plus, I think that's more of an audit requirement under SOX, but reviews are for nonissuers and might not require that.

Now, trying to remember the procedures in a review. Reviews involve making inquiries, analytical procedures, and other limited procedures. So they might ask about cash restrictions (A), and management's plans (E). 

I think the correct answer is A and E. But looking at the options, the question is which does the CPA usually perform. So which of these options is a typical procedure.

Wait, the question only gives one correct answer. So I need to pick the best option.

Option E is about evaluating management's plans for negative trends. That rings a bell. In a review, the CPA would inquire about management's responses to adverse situations, like if there are going concern issues or negative trends.

Option A is also about inquiries, but more about cash. I think both A and E are possible. But let me think more.

In a review, the CPA's procedures are primarily analytical procedures and inquiries. So they would make inquiries about various things, including cash and management's plans.

Wait, but the question is about which procedure a CPA usually performs. So perhaps the best fit is E.

Alternatively, looking for the correct answer, I remember that in a review, the CPA is required to make inquiries about the availability of cash, so option A is also correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the procedures listed in the review standards.

Under the AICPA's standards for reviews (SSRs), the CPA performs analytical procedures and makes inquiries. Common inquiries include:

- Liquidity and cash availability
- Any legal issues
- Management's knowledge of errors or fraud
- Changes in business conditions
- Plans for dealing with adverse events

So option A and E both fit.

But the question is about which option is correct. So perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, the question is about what the CPA "usually" does. So which of these options is more common.

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is E because it's about evaluating management's plans, which is part of understanding the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.

Alternatively, maybe A is correct because cash availability is a key area.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, looking back, option E says "evaluate management's plans for dealing with negative trends and financial difficulties." That sounds like something the CPA would do in a review, as part of assessing whether the financial statements are plausible.

Option A is about making inquiries about cash restrictions. That's also a common inquiry.

But I think in the context of a review, evaluating management's plans for negative trends is more specific to the review process. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A.

Wait, another approach. What is included in the review procedures? They include obtaining management's written representations, performing analytical procedures, and making inquiries.

So, making inquiries about cash restrictions (A) would be part of the standard procedures.

Evaluating management's plans (E) would also be part of the inquiries.

But looking at the options, the question is which is something the CPA usually performs.

I think both A and E are possible, but perhaps the best answer is E.

Wait, but I think the answer is E. Because when you review, you're looking at whether the financials make sense, and management's plans are part of that.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each option is.

Option A: Inquiries about cash availability. That's a standard part of a review.

Option E: Management's plans for negative trends. Also standard.

But looking at the answer options, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, I'm not certain, but I think the correct answer is E.

Wait, another thought. When I studied, I remember that in a review, the CPA will inquire about the existence of any information that would lead management to believe that the entity might not be a going concern. So that's part of the review procedures.

So option E would be part of that, as it's about management's plans for dealing with negative trends.

So I think the correct answer is E.

When a CPA reviews the financial statements of a nonissuer, the primary goal is to provide limited assurance that there are no material errors or misstatements. A review involves analytical procedures and inquiries, but it is less in-depth than an audit. The CPA typically makes inquiries about key areas such as cash availability and management's plans for addressing negative trends or financial difficulties.

- **Option A**: Making inquiries about cash availability is a standard procedure in a review, as cash is a critical area.
- **Option E**: Evaluating management's plans for dealing with negative trends is also a standard procedure, as it relates to assessing the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.

Both options A and E are plausible, but the question asks for the procedure the CPA "usually" performs. Evaluating management's plans for negative trends (Option E) is more specific to the review process and aligns with assessing the plausibility of the financial statements. Therefore, the best answer is:

E
