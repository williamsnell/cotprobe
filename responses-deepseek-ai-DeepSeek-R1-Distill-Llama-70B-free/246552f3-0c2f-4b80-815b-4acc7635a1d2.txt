Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gauge pressure in a water tank. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my fluid mechanics, but let me think this through.

Alright, the problem says the water stands 12.0 meters deep in a storage tank that's open to the atmosphere. I'm supposed to find the gauge pressure at the bottom of the tank, and the answer needs to be in units of 10^5 Pascals. The options are from A to J, each with a different value.

Wait, what's gauge pressure again? Oh right, gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. So it's the pressure above and beyond what the atmosphere is exerting. Since the tank is open to the atmosphere, the pressure at the top is atmospheric pressure, which is Patm.

I remember the formula for pressure at a certain depth in a fluid is P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height (or depth in this case) of the fluid. Oh, but wait, that's the absolute pressure. Since we're looking for gauge pressure, which is the pressure above atmospheric pressure, do I just subtract Patm from the absolute pressure?

Wait, no. Because when the tank is open to the atmosphere, the pressure at the surface is Patm. So the gauge pressure is just ρgh. Because gauge pressure P_gauge = P_absolute - P_atm. But P_absolute at depth h is P_atm + ρgh. So subtracting P_atm gives P_gauge = ρgh. Oh right, so in this case, the gauge pressure is just ρgh.

But wait, what about units? The question says the answer should be in 10^5 Pa. So I need to calculate and then convert accordingly.

Let me jot down the variables. The depth h is 12.0 meters. The density of water, ρ, I think is 1000 kg/m³. And g is 9.8 m/s².

So putting it all together: P = ρgh = 1000 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s² * 12.0 m.

Let me calculate that. 1000 * 9.8 is 9800, then multiply by 12. So 9800 * 12 = 117600 Pa.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 9.8 * 12 is... 117.6. Then 1000 * 117.6 is 117600. Yep, that's correct.

But wait, the question asks for the pressure in units of 10^5 Pa. So 117600 Pa is 1.176e5 Pa. So approximately 1.18 in units of 10^5 Pa.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.18. So the answer must be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Gauge pressure is ρgh, correct? Because the atmospheric pressure cancels out in this setup. Yes, because the tank is open, so the pressure at the top is atmospheric, and the pressure at the bottom is atmospheric plus ρgh. So gauge pressure ignores the atmospheric part, so it's just ρgh. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the calculation seems right. 12 meters of water gives a gauge pressure of approximately 1.18e5 Pa. So G is the correct answer.
</think>

The gauge pressure at the bottom of an open tank filled with water to a depth of 12.0 m can be calculated using the formula for gauge pressure:

\[
P_{\text{gauge}} = \rho g h
\]

Where:
- \(\rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\) (density of water),
- \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \(h = 12.0 \, \text{m}\) (depth of water).

Substituting the values:

\[
P_{\text{gauge}} = 1000 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 12.0 = 117600 \, \text{Pa}
\]

The question specifies the answer should be in units of \(10^5 \, \text{Pa}\). Converting:

\[
P_{\text{gauge}} = 1.176 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \approx 1.18 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

From the given options, the value closest to \(1.18 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}\) is **1.18**, which corresponds to option **G**.

Answer: G
