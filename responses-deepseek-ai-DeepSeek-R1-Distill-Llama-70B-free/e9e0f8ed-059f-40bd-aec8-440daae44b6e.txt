Question:

A man owned real estate in fee simple. He transferred a life estate in it over to a friend for the friend's lifetime. When the fee simple owner died, the life estate owner conveyed his interest to his children.

C: Yes, the life estate owner became the owner in fee simple when the original fee simple owner predeceased him.
D: Yes, the children of the life estate owner now own the property in fee simple.
E: No, the life estate terminated upon the death of the fee simple owner, and the property reverts back to the fee simple owner's estate.
F: No, the children of the life estate owner have a leasehold interest, not a life estate.
G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.

Okay, so I've got this question about property law, specifically dealing with life estates and fee simple ownership. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my property law, but I'll give it a shot.

So the setup is: A man owns real estate in fee simple, which means he owns it completely, right? Fee simple is the highest form of ownership, so he can do whatever he wants with it, including selling, transferring, etc. Now, he transfers a life estate to his friend. A life estate is an interest that lasts for the life of the holder. So the friend has the right to use and occupy the property until he dies. But when the friend dies, the property reverts back to the original owner or his heirs.

Wait, but in this case, the fee simple owner died. So the original owner, who granted the life estate, has died. Now, the friend (who holds the life estate) conveys his interest to his children. Then, the deceased fee simple owner's son sues the children, claiming the life estate is broken and he now owns the property absolutely.

The question is whether the children have an enforceable interest.

I remember that a life estate is transferable. The holder can transfer their interest, but only for the duration of their life. So if the life tenant (the friend) transfers it to someone else, that someone else gets the right to use the property until the life tenant dies. But once the life tenant dies, it goes back to the original grantor's estate.

Wait, but here the original grantor (the fee simple owner) died before the life tenant. So who gets the property when the life tenant dies? Because normally, when the life tenant dies, the property would go back to the grantor or his heirs. But if the grantor has already died, then it would go to his estate, which would be his son as the heir.

So in this scenario, the friend (life tenant) conveys his life estate to his children. So the children now have the life estate, right? But wait, the son of the original owner is suing, saying the life estate is broken and he now owns it.

Wait, what's the issue here? The key points are:

1. Life estate can be transferred. So the friend could convey his interest to his children. So the children would have a valid life estate, but only for the life of the original life tenant (their father, the friend). 

2. When the original fee simple owner dies, does that affect the life estate? No, because the life estate was granted by the fee simple owner. His death doesn't terminate the life estate; the life estate continues until the life tenant's death.

So when the friend transfers the life estate to his children, the children hold the life estate. So they can use the property until the friend dies. Once the friend dies, the property reverts to the original grantor's estate, which would be the son in this case.

But the son is suing, claiming the life estate is broken. Why? Maybe he's arguing that when the original fee simple owner died, the life estate somehow ended. But that's not how it works. The life estate continues until the life tenant's death, regardless of the grantor's death.

So the life estate was validly transferred to the children. But wait, the life tenant (friend) is still alive when he transferred it to his children. So the children's interest is a life estate measured by the friend's life, not their own. So when the friend dies, the life estate ends, and the property goes back to the original grantor's estate, which is the son.

But the question is whether the children have an enforceable interest now. So, yes, because they hold a valid life estate until their father (the friend) dies. So the son's claim that the life estate is broken is incorrect. The life estate was not broken by the grantor's death; it's still in effect.

Looking at the options:

Option G says "Yes, the life estate owner could convey his interest to third persons." That seems correct because the life tenant can transfer his interest. So the children would have the life estate now.

Option E says the life estate terminated upon the grantor's death. No, that's not correct because life estates aren't affected by the grantor's death.

Option A says the life estate was broken when the fee simple owner died. Again, no, because life estates are measured by the life tenant's life, not the grantor's.

Option C suggests the life tenant became fee simple owner when the grantor died. No, because the life tenant only has a life estate. The grantor's death doesn't elevate the life estate to a fee simple.

Option I says the children inherited upon their father's death. Wait, no, because the father (life tenant) conveyed it during his life, so it's a transfer, not inheritance. But the option is about inheriting upon death, which isn't the case here.

So the correct answer should be option G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his interest to third persons. So the children have an enforceable interest as they now hold the life estate.

The question revolves around the enforceability of a life estate interest after it has been conveyed to third parties. A life estate is an interest in property that lasts for the lifetime of the holder (the life tenant). When the life tenant dies, the property reverts to the grantor or their heirs. In this case, the original fee simple owner granted a life estate to a friend. The friend then conveyed this life estate to his children before the original fee simple owner died. The key issue is whether the children have an enforceable interest in the property.

1. **Key Principles of Life Estates**:
   - A life estate is transferable. The life tenant can convey their interest to others, but the interest transferred is limited to the duration of the life tenant's life.
   - The death of the original grantor (fee simple owner) does not terminate the life estate. The life estate continues until the life tenant's death.
   - When the life tenant dies, the property reverts to the original grantor's estate, which in this case would be the grantor's son.

2. **Analysis of the Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The life estate is not broken by the death of the fee simple owner. It continues until the life tenant's death.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. A life estate owner is allowed to convey their interest to others, though the interest conveyed is limited to the life tenant's lifetime.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The life tenant does not become the fee simple owner upon the grantor's death. The life estate remains in effect until the life tenant's death.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The children do not own the property in fee simple. They hold a life estate that terminates when the life tenant (their father) dies.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The life estate does not terminate upon the grantor's death. It continues until the life tenant's death.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The children hold a life estate, not a leasehold interest.
   - **Option G**: Correct. The life estate owner could convey his interest to third persons, and the children now hold a valid life estate.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The life estate was not broken by the conveyance to the children. It remains valid until the life tenant's death.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The children did not inherit the life estate upon their father's death. They received it through a conveyance during his lifetime.

3. **Conclusion**:
   The children of the life estate owner have an enforceable interest in the property because the life tenant validly conveyed the life estate to them. This interest will continue until the life tenant's death, after which the property will revert to the original grantor's estate.
