Okay, so I have this genetics question about mRNA and mutations. Hmm, I need to figure out which change after the start codon would have the most harmful effect. Let's think through each option.

Wait, the question is about the "greatest deleterious effect." So I'm looking for a mutation that really messes up the protein. I remember that the genetic code is read in triplets, codons, so any change that disrupts the reading frame could be really bad. Like, a frameshift mutation. Because that would change all the downstream codons from the point of mutation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Deletion of a triplet. That's three nucleotides. Since it's a multiple of three, it removes one amino acid but doesn't shift the reading frame. So the rest of the protein might be okay, except missing that one amino acid. Not as bad as a frameshift.

Option B: Deletion of a doublet (two nucleotides). Oh, that's not a multiple of three. So after this deletion, every subsequent codon would be shifted by two. But wait, the next codon would start two nucleotides earlier. Wait, or is it shifted by one? Maybe I should think in terms of how the reading frame changes. If three nucleotides are deleted, the frame remains the same. But two would cause a shift, because 2 mod 3 is 2. So after the deletion, each codon from that point is read differently. That would cause a frameshift, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from that point on. That sounds really bad.

Option C: Multiple substitutions in first, second, third positions of the first few codons. Substitutions can cause amino acid changes, maybe even stop codons. But if it's in the first few codons, maybe the protein is just not made correctly from the start. But whether it's more severe than a frameshift? A frameshift would change everything downstream, potentially leading to a completely nonfunctional protein or a premature stop codon. So maybe C is bad, but perhaps not as bad as a frameshift.

Option D: Single insertion after the first codon. So adding one nucleotide. That would shift the reading frame by one from that point. All the codons after that would be wrong. Frameshift again, which is a big problem. One insertion is a frameshift, causing all subsequent amino acids to be different. That's probably worse than a substitution.

Option E: Single substitution in the first codon position. The first codon is the start codon, right? Wait, no. The start codon is the first one, but after the start, the next codons are for amino acids. So if a substitution is in the first position of the next codon, that affects the amino acid. But the first position is more critical than the third for determining the amino acid. So this could lead to a different amino acid, but maybe not a stop codon unless it's a nonsense mutation.

Option F: Double substitution in first and second positions. That would change two out of three nucleotides in a codon. More likely to cause a different amino acid or a stop codon. But again, only affects that one codon. So the effect is limited to that one amino acid. Unless it's a stop, which is bad, but maybe not as bad as a frameshift.

Option G: Deletion of a single nucleotide. That's a frameshift because it's not a multiple of three. So the reading frame shifts by one. All codons after that point are wrong. This would mess up the entire protein from that point onward. That's a big problem, leading to a nonfunctional protein or a premature stop.

Option H: Substitution in the third position. That's often a silent mutation because the third base is the wobble position. So this might not even change the amino acid. If it does, it's a conservative change. So this is probably the least harmful.

Option I: Deletion of four nucleotides. Four isn't a multiple of three. So it causes a frameshift. The reading frame shifts by one (since 4 mod 3 is 1). So the rest of the mRNA is read incorrectly. That's a big problem, same as a single nucleotide deletion. Wait, but four is actually one more than a triplet, so the shift is by one, which affects everything after.

Option J: Substitution in the second position. Second position changes are more likely to result in a different amino acid because they're more critical in determining the codon. So this could lead to a non-conservative substitution, possibly disrupting the protein. But again, only that one codon is affected unless it's a stop codon.

So now, comparing the options. The question is which change is most likely to have the greatest deleterious effect. Frameshift mutations (like in D, B, G, I) are generally more severe than substitutions because they affect all downstream codons. Between the frameshift options, which would be worse?

Option G is a single nucleotide deletion, causing a frameshift. So every codon after that is wrong. Similarly, option B deletes two nucleotides, which would also cause a frameshift. Option D is inserting one, which causes a shift. Option I deletes four, which is like a shift of one as well.

Wait, but the number of nucleotides lost or gained affects how the frame shifts. Let me think: 

- Deletion of one (G): Each codon after is shifted by one nucleotide. So the triplet becomes shifted by one, leading to a completely different reading.

- Deletion of two (B): Each codon is shifted by two. So the next codon starts at position 2 instead of 1, so every codon is read as two nucleotides over. That's a frameshift as well.

- Deletion of four (I): 4 mod 3 is 1, so the shift is one. So same as G, but losing four nucleotides (so two extra after a triplet). So it's like losing one and a third, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the four-nucleotide deletion would cause a frameshift of -1 (since 4 is 3+1, so after the triplet, you're left with one extra, leading to a shift of one in the next codons).

But all these frameshifts are bad because they change the entire reading frame downstream. So the effect is similar in causing a lot of incorrect amino acids, potentially leading to a premature stop codon or a nonfunctional protein.

But what about the specific effect? Let me think about each.

Option G: Deletion of a single nucleotide. This causes a shift in the reading frame by one. So the next codon is read as nucleotides 2,3,4 instead of 1,2,3. This continues for the rest of the mRNA. So it's a severe effect.

Option B: Deletion of two nucleotides. The frame shifts by two, so the next codon is nucleotides 3,4,5 instead of 1,2,3. This is also a frameshift, leading to a different amino acid sequence.

Now, which frameshift is worse? Actually, all frameshifts are generally equally bad in terms of disrupting the protein, but perhaps some are more likely to cause a premature stop codon quicker than others. But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say. Alternatively, the question is about the most deleterious effect, which frameshifts are the worst.

So comparing all options, the worst change is a frameshift. So the options with frameshifts are B, D, G, I, and maybe others.

Wait, let me go back through the options. The question is which change would have the GREATEST deleterious effect. So, how about the number of amino acids affected?

Frameshifts affect all downstream amino acids. So for example, if the change is early in the mRNA, like right after the start codon, a frameshift would affect almost the entire protein.

So, which options involve frameshifts? Let's list them:

A: Deletion of triplet → no frameshift, just loses one amino acid.

B: Deletion of two → frameshift.

C: Substitutions in multiple positions → no frameshift.

D: Insertion of one → frameshift.

E: Substitution → no.

F: Substitution → no.

G: Deletion of one → frameshift.

H: Substitution → no.

I: Deletion of four → frameshift (since 4 mod 3 is 1, so shift of one).

J: Substitution → no.

So options B, D, G, I involve frameshifts. So these are all candidates.

Now, which of these would have the greatest effect? Well, the position where the frameshift occurs matters. Since the question says "following the start codon," so it's early in the mRNA. That means the frameshift would affect a large portion of the protein.

But all these options (B, D, G, I) would cause a frameshift early on. So which type of frameshift is worse? I think any frameshift is bad, but perhaps some cause more severe effects.

Wait, let me think about the number of nucleotides. The magnitude might affect how much is lost.

Option G: Deletion of a single nucleotide. So the reading shifts by one, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from that point.

Option I: Deletion of four. So four nucleotides lost, which is like losing one and a third codon. So the frame shifts by one (since 4 mod 3 is 1), leading to a shift. But in addition, the four-nucleotide deletion may remove more genetic information, but the frameshift is the same as a single deletion in terms of the shift. So for the same shift, the four-nucleotide deletion might have a bigger impact in terms of the information lost before the shift, but the frameshift itself is as bad as any other.

Wait, but the four-nucleotide deletion removes four nucleotides, which is equivalent to one codon (three nucleotides) plus one extra. So in addition to the frameshift, you lose the information from that one extra nucleotide, which becomes part of the next codon. Hmm, not sure if that's a bigger issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the triplet deletion (option A) is better because it doesn't shift the frame. So the rest of the mRNA is read correctly after that point.

So, considering that, the most deleterious is a frameshift that occurs early, causing the entire protein to be messed up.

Now, looking back at the options, which change is the worst.

Option C is a substitution in the first three codons. If all three change in all positions, that could cause multiple amino acid changes early on, perhaps introducing a stop codon. But if not, it's several wrong amino acids, but the rest of the protein is okay.

But a frameshift would cause the entire rest of the protein to be wrong, which is worse.

So among the options, the frameshift mutations (B, D, G, I) are the worst. Now, which of these is the most severe.

Wait, another thought: a single nucleotide insertion (option D) adds a nucleotide. That would cause a frameshift, but insertion versus deletion might have different effects depending on where they occur. But I don't think the type (insertion vs deletion) matters as much as the frameshift itself.

So all frameshifts are equally bad in terms of disrupting the protein. So in that case, perhaps any of these would have a severe effect. But the question asks which is the "most likely" to have the greatest effect.

Wait, perhaps considering that some frameshifts might result in a stop codon sooner than others. But without knowing the sequence, it's hard to predict. So perhaps the question is more about which mutation type (frameshift vs others) is worse.

So the answer should be among the frameshift options.

Now, looking at the options again. The options are:

A: deletion triplet → no frameshift.

B: deletion of doublet → frameshift.

C: substitutions in first three codons → possible early stop or bad amino acids.

D: insertion after first codon → frameshift.

E: substitution first position → possibly bad amino acid.

F: two substitutions → maybe a stop.

G: single deletion → frameshift.

H: substitution third → maybe no effect.

I: deletion of four → frameshift.

J: substitution second → maybe bad amino acid.

So the worst options are B, D, G, I.

Now, which of these would be the most severe.

Wait, another factor: the start codon is the first codon. The next codons are 2,3,4, etc. So if a frameshift occurs right after the start, it affects codon 2 onwards.

So all four options (B, D, G, I) would cause this.

But perhaps the size of the deletion affects how much is lost. For example, a four-nucleotide deletion removes one and a third codons, plus a frameshift. But I'm not sure if that's worse than just a single deletion.

Alternatively, perhaps a single nucleotide deletion (option G) is as bad as any other frameshift.

Wait, another point: the question asks for the change that would "most likely" have the greatest effect. So perhaps the most likely to cause a frameshift is more severe.

Wait, but all the options that involve frameshifts would have a severe effect. So I'm a bit stuck between these options.

Wait, the question is about the "most likely" greatest effect. So perhaps whichever is more likely to cause a frameshift. But the question is about the effect, not the likelihood of the mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of nucleotides involved: a single deletion (G) or a doublet deletion (B) etc. But in terms of effect, all cause frameshifts.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G. Because a single nucleotide deletion is a frameshift that changes the reading frame by one, which is a common type of mutation with severe effects.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option's effect.

Option G: Deletion of a single nucleotide. So the reading frame shifts by one. So codons become, for example, 2,3,4 instead of 1,2,3. This leads to a completely different amino acid sequence from that point on, likely introducing a premature stop codon somewhere, making the protein much shorter and probably nonfunctional.

Option B: Deletion of two nucleotides. The frame shifts by two, so codons are 3,4,5 instead of 1,2,3. This also changes all downstream codons.

Option D: Insertion of a single nucleotide. So the frame shifts by one, but in the other direction. For example, positions 2 becomes 1,2,3 after insertion. So similar to a deletion, but the shift is in the opposite way.

Option I: Deletion of four. So the frame shifts by one (since 4 mod 3 =1). So same as a single nucleotide deletion.

So all these options cause a frameshift, but the shift is either plus one or minus one or two.

Wait, but wait. Deletion of two would cause a shift of minus two? Because you lose two, so the next codon starts two earlier. That might have a different effect than a shift of one.

Alternatively, the key is that any frameshift is a severe mutation, but perhaps a shift of one is more likely to cause a stop codon sooner than a shift of two.

But without knowing the sequence, I can't be sure. So perhaps the answer hinges on which option causes a frameshift, and all of them are equally bad.

Wait, but the question is about the change that would have the greatest deleterious effect. So perhaps the biggest change in terms of nucleotides. But no, it's about the effect on the protein.

Another approach: Think about which type of mutation is more likely to disrupt the reading frame entirely. Since all the frameshift options do that, but perhaps the size of the deletion affects the number of codons that are incorrect before a stop codon is encountered.

But again, without knowing the sequence, it's hard to say. So perhaps the question is looking for the type of mutation that is a frameshift, which would be worse than substitutions.

So the correct answer is any of the frameshift options. Now, which option is among the choices.

Looking back at the options, the question is which change would have the most severe effect. So the correct answer is likely G: a single nucleotide deletion, which causes a frameshift.

Alternatively, option I: deletion of a quadruplet. But that's a four-nucleotide deletion, which is a bigger loss but the frameshift is the same as a single nucleotide in terms of shift (since 4 mod 3 is 1). So the frameshift effect is similar, but the four-nucleotide loss removes more information. So perhaps it's worse.

Wait, but the four-nucleotide deletion would remove one and a third codons. For example, if the mRNA is ...123456789..., a four-nucleotide deletion would remove 1,2,3,4, causing a shift of one. So the next codon starts at 5,6,7 but since the frame is shifted, it's 5,6,7 as a codon when it should have been 4,5,6. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

No, the way it works is that each codon is read as three nucleotides. So if you delete four nucleotides, after the deletion, the next codon starts at position 5 (since 1-4 are deleted). But the reading frame is now 5,6,7 as the first codon, then 8,9,10, etc. But because the original frame was 1,2,3; 4,5,6; 7,8,9, etc., the new frame after position 4 is 5,6,7; 8,9,10. So it's shifted by one (since 4 mod 3 is 1, so the shift is one). So the effect is the same as a single nucleotide deletion.

So in that case, the four-nucleotide deletion has the same frameshift effect as a single deletion, but with more nucleotides lost. So that might be worse because more information is lost before the shift.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on the protein. The four-nucleotide deletion would lose four nucleotides, but then the frameshift would occur, leading the rest of the codons to be misread. So compared to a single deletion, which just shifts the frame, losing four would mean that one codon is lost entirely (three nucleotides) plus one more, which affects the next codon. Hmm, but I'm not sure. The frameshift is the main problem.

Alternatively, perhaps a single nucleotide deletion is as bad as a four-nucleotide deletion in terms of the frameshift effect. So the key is that any frameshift is bad, but the question is which is
