Okay, so I've got this complex integral to compute. The integral is ∫_C dz / (z * (z-2)^2) where the contour C is defined by |z - 2| = 1. Hmm, I remember that in complex analysis, integrals around closed contours can often be evaluated using the residue theorem. 

Wait, let me think about the residue theorem. It states that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. So first, I need to identify the singularities of the integrand.

The function here is 1/(z*(z-2)^2). So the singularities are at z=0 and z=2. Both are poles. Now, the contour is |z-2|=1, which is a circle centered at z=2 with radius 1. So I need to check which of these singularities lie inside this contour.

The distance from z=2 to z=0 is 2 units. Since the radius is 1, z=0 is outside the contour. Because 2 - 0 = 2, which is greater than the radius 1. So only z=2 is inside the contour. Wait, no, z=2 is the center, so the point z=2 is actually on the contour? Because |z-2|=0 would be the point, but our radius is 1, so z=2 is the center and lies inside the contour, right?

Wait, no, the contour is |z-2|=1, so it's a circle that doesn't include z=2 as a point on the circle, but rather as the center. So z=2 is inside the circle because the distance from any point on the contour to z=2 is exactly 1, which is the radius. So any point inside will have a distance less than 1 from z=2. So z=2 is the center, so it's definitely inside the contour.

Wait, but z=2 is a singularity of the function. So the residue theorem applies here. So I need to compute the residue at z=2 and multiply by 2πi.

But wait, the function has a double pole at z=2, right? Because (z-2)^2 in the denominator. So the function is f(z) = 1/[z*(z-2)^2]. So the pole at z=2 is of order 2. So to find the residue at a double pole, I need to use the formula for residues at poles of order m.

The formula is Res(f, z0) = (1/(m-1)!) ) * lim_{z→z0} [d^{m-1}/dz^{m-1} ( (z - z0)^m f(z) ) ].

In this case, m=2. So Res(f, 2) = (1/(2-1)! ) * lim_{z→2} [d/dz ( (z-2)^2 * f(z) ) ].

Let me compute that. First, compute (z-2)^2 * f(z) = (z-2)^2 * [1/(z*(z-2)^2)] = 1/z. So that simplifies to 1/z.

Now take the derivative of 1/z with respect to z. The derivative of 1/z is -1/z². Then evaluate the limit as z approaches 2. So lim_{z→2} (-1/z²) = -1/(2²) = -1/4.

Since the factorial term is 1! =1, the residue is (1/1)*(-1/4) = -1/4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The function after multiplying by (z-2)^2 is indeed 1/z. Then the first derivative is -1/z². Evaluated at z=2 gives -1/4. So yes, residue is -1/4.

So the integral is 2πi times this residue. So 2πi * (-1/4) = (-π i)/2. But wait, the question says the answer is Ai, where i is the imaginary unit, so A must be the coefficient of i.

So in the integral, the result is (-π/2)i. So A is -π/2. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are exactly that. Hmm. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the residue calculation. Let me go through it again.

f(z) = 1/(z(z-2)^2). So near z=2, f(z) = 1/(z (z-2)^2). So the function has a double pole at z=2.

The formula for residue at a pole of order m is:

Res(f, z0) = 1/( (m-1)! ) * lim_{z→z0} [ d^{m-1}/dz^{m-1} { (z - z0)^m f(z) } ]

So m=2, so:

Res = 1/1! * lim_{z→2} d/dz [ (z-2)^2 * f(z) ]

Compute (z-2)^2 f(z) = (z-2)^2/(z(z-2)^2) ) = 1/z.

Derivative of 1/z is -1/z². Evaluated at z=2, gives -1/(4).

So residue is -1/4.

Wait, so integral is 2πi*(-1/4) = (-π/2)i.

So the answer is (-π/2)i, meaning A is -π/2. But looking at the options, I don't see π/2. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the fact that z=0 is outside the contour. Wait, the contour is |z-2|=1, which is a circle of radius 1 around z=2. So z=0 is two units away from z=2, so it's outside the contour. So only residue at z=2 contributes. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the residue calculation. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the function and perform partial fractions.

Wait, let's consider the function f(z) = 1/(z (z-2)^2). Let me try to express this as partial fractions.

We can write 1/(z (z-2)^2) = A/z + B/(z-2) + C/(z-2)^2.

Multiply both sides by z(z-2)^2:

1 = A(z-2)^2 + B z (z-2) + C z.

Now, let's solve for A, B, C.

Let me plug in z=0: 1 = A(-2)^2 + 0 + 0 => 4A=1 => A=1/4.

Now, plug in z=2: 1 = 0 + 0 + C*2 => C=1/2.

Now, to find B, let's expand the equation:

1 = A(z² -4z +4) + Bz(z-2) + Cz.

We know A=1/4 and C=1/2.

Substituting:

1 = (1/4)(z² -4z +4) + Bz(z-2) + (1/2) z.

Expand:

1 = (1/4)z² - (1/4)(4z) + (1/4)(4) + Bz² - 2Bz + (1/2) z.

Simplify each term:

1 = (1/4) z² - z + 1 + B z² - 2B z + (1/2) z.

Combine like terms:

Left side: 1.

Right side: (1/4 + B) z² + (-1 - 2B + 1/2) z + 1.

So equate coefficients.

Constant term: 1 = 1. That's okay.

z term: 0 = (-1 - 2B + 1/2) => -1 + 0.5 = -0.5. So -0.5 - 2B =0 => -2B = 0.5 => B= -0.25.

Wait, let me compute that again:

Coefficient of z: (-1 -2B + 1/2) = (-1 + 0.5) - 2B = (-0.5) -2B.

This must equal 0, so:

-0.5 -2B =0 → -2B = 0.5 → B= -0.25.

Coefficient of z²: (1/4 + B) must be 0 since there's no z² on the left.

So 1/4 + B =0 → B = -1/4, which is consistent with the previous result.

So the partial fractions are:

f(z) = (1/4)/z + (-1/4)/(z-2) + (1/2)/(z-2)^2.

Now, the integral around the contour C is the sum of the residues inside C times 2πi.

As before, only z=2 is inside C, so the residue at z=2 is the coefficient of 1/(z-2) term plus the residue from the 1/(z-2)^2 term.

Wait, actually, the residue of f(z) at z=2 is the sum of the residues from each term at z=2.

Looking at the partial fractions, the term (1/4)/z contributes nothing at z=2, since it's analytic there. The term (-1/4)/(z-2) has residue -1/4, and the term (1/2)/(z-2)^2 has residue 1/2. Wait, no, the residue of 1/(z-2)^2 is zero because it's a pole of order 2, and the residue is the coefficient of (z-2)^{-1}, which in this term is zero except for the (z-2)^{-2} term. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait no, the residue at z=2 is the coefficient of 1/(z-2) in the Laurent expansion. So in the partial fraction, we have f(z) = ... + (-1/4)/(z-2) + (1/2)/(z-2)^2.

So when we expand around z=2, the Laurent series includes terms like (z-2)^{-2}, (z-2)^{-1}, etc. So the coefficient of (z-2)^{-1} is -1/4. The (z-2)^{-2} term's coefficient is 1/2, but that doesn't contribute to the residue. So the residue at z=2 is -1/4.

Wait, so that's the same result as before. So the integral is 2πi * (-1/4) = (-π/2)i. So A is -π/2, but wait, looking at the options, I don't see -π/2. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: -0.3926

B: 0.1234

C: 0

D: 1

E: 0.7854

F: 0.3926

G: -0.5

H: -0.1234

I: -1

J: 0.5

Hmm, none of these are exactly -π/2, which is approximately -1.5708. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong contour or there's another singularity I'm missing.

Wait a second, wait. The contour is |z-2|=1. So the function has a singularity at z=0, which is outside the contour. So only z=2 is inside. So the residue is indeed -1/4, and the integral is 2πi*(-1/4)= -π i/2.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the residue calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should parameterize the integral. Let me try that. Let me parametrize the contour C: |z-2| = 1. So z = 2 + e^{iθ}, where θ goes from 0 to 2π.

Then dz = i e^{iθ} dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{2π} [i e^{iθ} dθ] / [ (2 + e^{iθ}) * (e^{iθ})^2 ) ]

Wait, let's compute the denominator:

z = 2 + e^{iθ}, so z-2 = e^{iθ}.

So denominator becomes z*(z-2)^2 = (2 + e^{iθ}) * (e^{iθ})^2 = (2 + e^{iθ}) e^{i2θ}.

So the integral is ∫ [i e^{iθ} dθ ] / [ (2 + e^{iθ}) e^{i2θ} } ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= ∫ i e^{iθ} dθ / [ (2 + e^{iθ}) e^{i2θ} ]

= i ∫ e^{iθ} / (2 + e^{iθ}) * e^{-i2θ} dθ

= i ∫ e^{-iθ} / (2 + e^{iθ}) dθ

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe I can simplify the integrand.

Let me write the denominator as 2 + e^{iθ} = e^{iθ/2} [ 2 e^{-iθ/2} + e^{iθ/2} ].

Wait, maybe it's better to factor out e^{iθ} from denominator:

2 + e^{iθ} = e^{iθ/2} (2 e^{-iθ/2} + e^{iθ/2} )

Hmm, perhaps using substitution. Let me set w = e^{iθ}, so dw = i e^{iθ} dθ. Wait, but perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, note that e^{iθ} = w, so the integral becomes a contour integral over |w|=1. Then the integral becomes:

i ∫_{|w|=1} [ w^{1} / (2 + w) w^{2} ] * (dw / i) )

Wait, let's clarify:

Wait, in the substitution, when z = 2 + w, and |w|=1, then w = e^{iθ}, dw = i e^{iθ} dθ.

So substituting into the integral:

The original integral is ∫ dz / [ z (z-2)^2 ].

With z = 2 + w, dz = dw.

So integral becomes ∫_{|w|=1} dw / [ (2 + w) w^2 ].

Which is ∫_{|w|=1} [ 1/( (2 + w) w^2 ) ] dw.

Now, this integral can be evaluated using residues. The function inside is 1/(w² (w + 2)). The singularities are at w=0 (double pole) and w=-2 (simple pole). The contour |w|=1 includes only w=0, since |-2|=2>1.

So the residue at w=0.

Since it's a double pole, we can compute the residue using the formula.

Res(f, 0) = (1/(2-1)!) lim_{w→0} d/dw [ w² * f(w) ]

w² f(w) = w² / [w² (w + 2) ] = 1/(w + 2).

So derivative of 1/(w + 2) with respect to w is -1/(w + 2)^2.

Evaluated at w=0: -1/(0 + 2)^2 = -1/4.

Thus, the residue is -1/4.

So the integral is 2πi * (-1/4) = -π i / 2.

So again, the result is (-π/2) i, so A is -π/2 ≈ -1.5708.

Wait, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question had a typo, and the answer is expected to be in a different form.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the integral computes to (-π/2)i, and looking at the options, perhaps A is -0.5. Because π is approximately 3.1416, so π/2 is about 1.5708, so -π/2 is about -1.5708, which isn't an option. Wait, but option G is -0.5, which is -1/2, and F is 0.3926, which is approximately 1/(2π) since 1/(2π)≈0.159, but no, 0.3926 is approximately 1/2.54, which isn't a standard fraction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the parameterization. Let me double-check.

In the parameterization approach, the integral is ∫_{|w|=1} [1/(w^2 (w+2))] dw.

Residue at w=0 is -1/4, so integral is 2πi*(-1/4) = -π i/2.

So that seems correct. But the options don't include this value. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the intended answer is option G: -0.5.

Wait, but that would be if the residue was -1/2, but I calculated -1/4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions approach.

Wait, going back to partial fractions:

We had f(z) = 1/(z(z-2)^2) = A/z + B/(z-2) + C/(z-2)^2.

We found A=1/4, C=1/2, and B=-1/4.

So the function is f(z) = (1/4)/z + (-1/4)/(z-2) + (1/2)/(z-2)^2.

So when integrating around C, which encloses z=2, the integral is 2πi times the sum of the residues inside.

At z=2, the residue is the coefficient of 1/(z-2), which is -1/4, plus the residue from the 1/(z-2)^2 term, which is 1/2. Wait, no. Wait, no, the residue is the coefficient of 1/(z-2) in the Laurent expansion. The term 1/(z-2)^2 contributes to the (z-2)^{-2} term, so its residue is zero. So only the term -1/
