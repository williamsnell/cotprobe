Question:

A gas main carrying natural gas and laid in a corrosive soil ultimately reaches the point where it develops small leaks that increase as time goes on. Assume the cost per mile of main is $8,000, that no gas is lost for the first 15 years of life, and that a main has zero net salvage value whenever retired. Assume also that the mile of main loses $60 worth of gas in the 16th year of life and that the cost of lost gas increases $60 every year thereafter. Interest or minimum attractive return is at 7%. Compare the equivalent uniform annual cost over the life of a main retired after 20 years with the equivalent uniform annual cost over the life of the main retired after 25 years.

Options:

A: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is substantially lower than that of the 20-year line due to reduced leak repair costs
B: The total annual cost of the 20-year line is equal to that of the 25-year line when including the cost of gas loss
C: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is equal to that of the 20-year line
D: The total annual cost of the 20-year line is lower than that of the 25-year line when factoring in technological improvements in leak detection
E: The total annual cost of the 20-year line is lower than that of the 25-year line
F: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is higher than that of the 20-year line due to higher cumulative gas loss
G: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is lower than that of the 20-year line
H: The total annual cost of the 20-year line is higher than that of the 25-year line due to increased maintenance costs
I: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is higher than that of the 20-year line
J: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is slightly higher than that of the 20-year line due to escalating gas prices

Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the equivalent uniform annual cost of a gas main that's retired after either 20 or 25 years. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The gas main is in corrosive soil and starts leaking after some time. The cost per mile is $8,000. No gas is lost for the first 15 years. Starting from the 16th year, it loses $60 worth of gas, and this cost increases by $60 each subsequent year. The interest rate is 7%. I need to compare the equivalent uniform annual costs for retiring the main after 20 vs. 25 years.

Wait, I think equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC) means converting all the costs into a yearly expense using the interest rate. So I need to calculate the EUAC for both 20 and 25 years and then compare them.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Initial Investment**: The main costs $8,000. Since it's a capital cost, it's a one-time expense at year 0.

2. **Cost of Gas Loss**: No loss for the first 15 years. Starting year 16, the loss is $60, then $120 in year 17, $180 in 18, and so on. But wait, does this mean each year after 15, the loss increases by $60 each year? So it's an arithmetic progression starting at year 16.

3. **Salvage Value**: The problem says zero net salvage value whenever retired. So no need to consider any salvage value at the end of the life.

So for each scenario (20 and 25 years), I need to calculate the EUAC which includes the initial cost and the cost of gas losses.

Let me think about how to model the gas loss costs. Since the gas loss starts at year 16, for a main retired at 20 years, the gas loss occurs for 5 years (years 16-20). For a main retired at 25, the gas loss is for 10 years (years 16-25).

Wait, let me clarify the timing. The first 15 years have no loss. So:

- For 20-year retirement: Years 16,17,18,19,20 → 5 years of gas loss.
- For 25-year retirement: Years 16 to 25 → 10 years.

Now, the gas loss cost each year increases by $60 each year starting from $60 in year 16.

So, for the 20-year case, the gas loss in each of the 5 years is:

Year 16: $60

Year 17: $120

Year 18: $180

Year 19: $240

Year 20: $300

Wait, wait. Wait, the question says "loses $60 worth of gas in the 16th year of life and that the cost of lost gas increases $60 every year thereafter." So each year after 16, it's increasing by $60. So in year 16, it's 60, year 17 is 120, year 18 is 180, and so on.

Wait, no. Does it increase by $60 each year from 16 onward, making it an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by $60? For example:

Year 16: 60

Year 17: 60 + 60 = 120

Year 18: 120 +60=180

Year 19: 180+60=240

Year 20:240+60=300

Yes, that's correct.

So for the 20-year main, the gas loss occurs in years 16-20, which is 5 years.

Similarly, for the 25-year main, gas loss is years 16-25, which is 10 years.

Now, for each scenario, I need to compute the present worth of the gas loss costs and then find the EUAC, including the initial investment.

Wait, but the initial investment is a single amount at year 0. So when calculating EUAC, I'll have to convert that initial cost into an annual cost using the capital recovery factor.

The formula for EUAC is the sum of:

- Initial cost converted to annual using CRF (capital recovery factor)
- Plus the annual equivalent of the gas loss costs.

So, the CRF is (i(1+i)^n)/( (1+i)^n -1 )

The initial cost is $8,000. So for each case (20 and 25 years), the CRF is different.

Then, for the gas loss, which is a series of costs starting at year 16, I need to find their present worth at year 0, then convert that present worth into an annual cost using CRF (using the same interest rate) because EUAC combines everything into an annual cost.

Alternatively, I could model the gas loss as an annuity starting at year 16, but for each scenario, the number of gas loss years is different.

Wait, another approach: calculate the present value of all gas losses for each scenario, then add the initial cost, and then find the EUAC over the respective life (20 or 25 years).

Hmm, perhaps I should first calculate the present worth (PW) of the gas losses for each case.

Let me consider the 20-year case first.

20-year main:

- Gas loss occurs in years 16-20 (5 years).

The cost each year is 60*(n-15), where n is the year. So for year 16, n=16: 60*(16-15)=60, year 17: 60*2=120, etc.

So it's an arithmetic series with first term a = $60, common difference d = $60, number of terms N = 5.

The present worth of an arithmetic series can be calculated with the formula:

PW = a * (P/A, i, N) + d * (P/AG, i, N)

Wait, I think the formula for the present worth of an arithmetic gradient is:

PW = a*(P/A, i, N) + d*(P/A/G, i, N)

Where (P/A, i, N) is the present worth of a uniform series, and (P/A/G, i, N) is the present worth factor for a gradient.

Alternatively, I could calculate each year's cost, discount them to present worth, and sum them up.

But for time efficiency, perhaps using the formula is better.

Similarly for the 25-year case, the gas loss runs for 10 years (years 16-25), so N=10, a=60, d=60.

So let's proceed.

First, I'll compute the PW for 20-year case.

For 20-year retirement:

Gas loss years: 16,17,18,19,20 → 5 years.

The series is 60, 120, 180, 240, 300.

Wait no, wait. The first term is 60, and each subsequent term increases by 60. So a=60, d=60, N=5.

So the present worth of this series is:

PW_20 = 60*(P/A,7%,5) + 60*(P/A/G,7%,5)

Wait, wait, no. Because the gradient starts at year 1 of the series (year 16 overall). So the formula should correctly represent the series.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the gas loss as a deferred annuity.

Wait, but each year's cost increases by 60. So it's an increasing annuity starting at year 16.

Alternatively, let me consider that the gas loss starts at year 16 as an arithmetic series.

So, the present worth of the gas losses for 20-year case is the present worth of the series from year 16 to 20.

Which is the same as the present worth at year 15 of the series from year 16 to 20, discounted back to year 0.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the present worth of the series at year 15 and then discount it back 15 years.

So for the 20-year case:

At year 15, the next 5 years (16-20) have gas losses of 60, 120, 180, 240, 300.

The present worth at year 15 would be:

PW_15 = 60*(P/A,7%,5) + 60*(P/A/G,7%,5)

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the present worth of each payment and sum them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the series as a simple arithmetic progression and compute its present worth.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate each year's loss, discount them, and sum.

So for 20-year case:

Year 16: 60 → PW = 60/(1.07)^16

Year 17: 120 → PW =120/(1.07)^17

Year 18:180 → PW=180/(1.07)^18

Year 19:240 → 240/(1.07)^19

Year 20:300 → 300/(1.07)^20

Sum all these to get PW_gas_20.

Similarly for 25-year case, the gas loss runs from year 16 to 25 → 10 years.

So for each of those years, the cost is 60*(year-15), so in year 16:60, year17:120,... year25:60*(25-15)=600.

So their present worths would be each term 60*(n-15) where n is from 16 to 25, discounted to year 0.

But calculating each term would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps using the arithmetic series formula is better.

Wait, let me recall the formula for the present worth of an arithmetic gradient series. The general formula is:

PW = a*(P/A, i, N) + d*(P/G, i, N)

Where:
a = first payment,
d = common difference,
N = number of periods.

Wait, but in this case, the first payment is at year 16, so the series starts after 15 years. So to find the present worth at year 0, I need to compute the present worth of the series as of year 15, then discount that back to year 0.

So for the 20-year case:

The series of gas losses starts at year 16 for 5 years. So the present worth at year 15 is:

PW_15 = a*(P/A,7%,5) + d*(P/G,7%,5)

Where a=60, d=60, N=5.

Then, the present worth at year 0 is PW_15 / (1.07)^15.

Similarly, for the 25-year case:

The series runs for 10 years, starting at year 16.

So present worth at year 15 is:

PW_15_25 = a*(P/A,7%,10) + d*(P/G,7%,10)

Then, PW_0_25 = PW_15_25 / (1.07)^15

So once I have the present worth of the gas losses for each case, I can add the initial investment and then compute the EUAC.

Wait, the initial investment is $8,000 at year 0. So the total present worth for each case is:

For 20 years: PW_total_20 = 8000 + PW_gas_20

For 25 years: PW_total_25 =8000 + PW_gas_25

Once I have the total present worth, the EUAC is then PW_total * (A/P, i, n), where n is 20 or 25.

Let me compute these step by step.

First, I'll compute the factors needed.

Compute (P/A,7%,5): Present worth factor for $1 per year for 5 years at 7%.

The formula is (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i.

So (P/A,7%,5) = (1 - 1.07^-5)/0.07 ≈ (1 - 0.71298)/0.07 ≈ 0.2879975.

Similarly, (P/G,7%,5) is the present worth factor for a gradient series.

The formula is [1/(i^2)] * [1 - (1+i)^-n * (1 + n*i) ]

For n=5, i=0.07:

(1 + 5*0.07) = 1.35

1.07^-5 ≈ 0.71298

So [1 - 0.71298 * 1.35 ] = 1 - (0.71298 * 1.35) ≈ 1 - 0.9628 ≈ 0.0372.

Divide by i^2: 0.0372 / (0.07)^2 = 0.0372 / 0.0049 ≈ 7.5918.

So (P/G,7%,5) ≈ 7.5918.

Now, for the 20-year case:

PW_15_20 = 60*(P/A,7%,5) + 60*(P/G,7%,5)

= 60 * 0.2879975 + 60 * 7.5918

= 17.27985 + 457.508 ≈ 474.78785 (thousands?)

Wait, no, units are in dollars, since all values are per mile. So 60 is dollars per year.

Wait, no, 60 is dollars, so yes.

So, 60 * 0.2879975 ≈ 17.28

60 * 7.5918 ≈ 455.5

So total PW_15_20 ≈ 17.28 + 455.5 ≈ 472.78

Then, to get present worth at year 0:

PW_gas_20 = 472.78 / (1.07)^15.

Compute (1.07)^15: Let me calculate that.

1.07^1 =1.07

^2=1.1449

^3=1.2250

^4=1.3108

^5=1.4025

^6≈1.5036

^7≈1.6057

^8≈1.7182

^9≈1.8385

^10≈1.9671

^11≈2.1058

^12≈2.2543

^13≈2.4132

^14≈2.5809

^15≈2.7566

So 1.07^15 ≈ 2.7566.

So PW_gas_20 ≈ 472.78 / 2.7566 ≈ 472.78 / 2.7566 ≈ let's calculate: 2.7566 * 170 ≈ 468. So 470 is about 170. So 472.78 /2.7566 ≈ approximately 171.42.

Wait, more accurately, 2.7566 * 171 = ?

2.7566 * 170 = 468.922

2.7566 * 1 = 2.7566 → total 468.922 +2.7566= 471.6786.

Which is very close to 472.78. So 171 gives 471.68, so the actual value is about 171.3.

So PW_gas_20 ≈ 171.3.

Then, the total present worth for the 20-year main is:

PW_total_20 = 8000 + 171.3 = 8171.3.

Now, the EUAC is this present worth multiplied by the capital recovery factor (A/P,7%,20).

Compute (A/P,7%,20) = i*(1+i)^n / [ (1+i)^n -1 ]

(1.07)^20 ≈ Let me compute:

I know that (1.07)^10 ≈ 1.9671.

So 1.07^20 is (1.9671)^2 ≈ 3.868.

So (A/P,7%,20) = 0.07 * 3.868 / (3.868 -1) = 0.07 * 3.868 / 2.868 ≈ 0.2709 / 2.868 ≈ 0.09446.

So EUAC_20 = 8171.3 * 0.09446 ≈ Let's compute:

8000 *0.09446= 755.68

171.3 * 0.09446≈ 16.18

Total ≈ 755.68 +16.18 ≈ 771.86.

So approximately $772 per year for the 20-year main.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this is getting a bit involved.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the present worth calculation. Let me recompute the PW_gas_20.

Wait, in the 20-year case, the gas loss is years 16-20, which is 5 years.

The present worth of each payment is:

Year 16:60/(1.07)^16

Year 17:120/(1.07)^17

Year 18:180/(1.07)^18

Year 19:240/(1.07)^19

Year 20:300/(1.07)^20

Alternatively, let me compute each term:

Compute 1.07^16: 1.07^10 is 1.9671, 1.07^5 is 1.4025. So 1.07^15=1.07^10 *1.07^5=1.9671*1.4025≈2.7566. So 1.07^16=2.7566*1.07≈2.9490.

So:

Year 16:60/2.9490≈20.33

Year 17:120/(2.9490*1.07)=120/(3.1533)≈38.07

Year 18:180/(3.1533*1.07)=180/(3.3698)≈53.43

Year 19:240/(3.3698*1.07)=240/(3.6037)≈66.62

Year 20:300/(3.6037*1.07)=300/(3.859≈) ≈77.72

Now, sum these: 20.33 +38.07=58.4; +53.43=111.83; +66.62=178.45; +77.72=256.17.

So the present worth of gas losses in the 20-year case is approximately $256.17.

Wait, that's a different result than before. I think I made a mistake earlier by using the gradient formula. Because when I computed the sum manually, I got $256.17, which is higher than the $171.3 I calculated earlier. Hmm, so perhaps using the gradient approach wasn't the right method here because the series starts after 15 years.

Wait, perhaps the way I applied the gradient formula was incorrect. Because when I used PW_15 = a*(P/A) + d*(P/G), then discounted by 15 years,
