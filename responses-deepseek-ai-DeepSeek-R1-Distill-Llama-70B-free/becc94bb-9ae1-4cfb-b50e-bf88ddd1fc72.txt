Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about periodic trends, specifically comparing magnesium and sodium. Hmm, I remember that elements are arranged in the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number, and their properties follow certain trends based on their position.

First, I think about where magnesium and sodium are located. Magnesium is in Group 2, right? And sodium is in Group 1. Also, looking at their periods, magnesium is in Period 3, and sodium is in Period 3 as well but to the left. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Magnesium is in Period 3, Group 2. Sodium is in Period 3, Group 1. So they're in the same period but different groups.

Wait, no, wait. No, that's not right. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, magnesium is actually in Period 3. Sodium is in Period 3 as well. Oh wait, no! Wait, sodium has atomic number 11, so it's in Period 3, Group 1. Magnesium is atomic number 12, so it's in Period 3, Group 2. So they are next to each other in the same period.

So when moving from left to right across a period, certain trends occur. Atomic radius decreases because the increasing nuclear charge pulls electrons closer. So atomic radius should be smaller for elements to the right. So sodium is to the left of magnesium, so sodium should have a larger atomic radius than magnesium.

Wait, the given atomic radius for magnesium is 160 pm. So sodium's radius should be larger than that. Let me think about typical atomic radii. Sodium usually has an atomic radius around 186 pm. Yeah, I remember that the atomic radius of sodium is about 186 pm. So that's larger than magnesium's 160 pm, which fits because sodium is to the left.

Now for ionization energy. Ionization energy generally increases across a period from left to right because the atoms hold onto their electrons more tightly as the nuclear charge increases. So sodium is to the left of magnesium, so sodium should have a lower first ionization energy than magnesium.

The given first ionization energy for magnesium is 737 kJ/mol. So sodium's should be less than that. I think sodium's ionization energy is around 496 kJ/mol. Let me confirm—yes, sodium's first ionization energy is approximately 496 kJ/mol, while magnesium's is higher, around 737 kJ/mol as stated.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm a bit confused because sometimes ionization energy can have exceptions, especially when moving across periods. For example, elements in the same group have similar properties, but moving across periods, the trend is mostly increasing. So sodium, being in Group 1, has a lower ionization energy than Group 2 elements like magnesium.

So putting it together, sodium's atomic radius is larger than magnesium's, and its ionization energy is lower. So looking at the options, I need to find which option has a radius larger than 160 pm and an ionization energy less than 737 kJ.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol. That fits. Because 186 is larger than 160, and 496 is less than 737.

Wait, let me check other options. Option A: 186 pm, 898 kJ. No, that's higher ionization than magnesium, which doesn't fit. Option B: 170 pm (smaller than 160?), wait no, 170 is larger than 160. But the ionization is 600 kJ, which is lower than 737. Wait, but sodium's ionization should be lower than magnesium's. Wait, 600 is lower than 737, so that's possible. But what's the correct value for sodium?

Wait, I think sodium's first ionization is 496 kJ/mol, and magnesium's is 737. So looking for 496. So which options have 496? Let's see:

Option D: 186 pm, 496. That's correct. Option F is 135 pm (too small) and 496. So F can't be right. Option C: 135 pm, 523—no. Option E: 147 pm, 523—no. Option H: 170 pm, 523. No, because the ionization is higher than 496, but 523 is higher than sodium's. Wait, no, 523 is higher than 496. So that's not correct. So option D seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. Sodium is in the same period as magnesium but to the left, so atomic radius is larger. So the radius should be larger than 160, which 186 is. And ionization energy lower than 737, which 496 is. So D is correct.

Wait, but wait, what about option F? No, F has 135 pm, which is smaller than 160, so that's not right. So yes, D is the correct option.

To determine the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium based on periodic trends, we analyze the positions of sodium and magnesium in the periodic table. Sodium (Na) is in Group 1, Period 3, while magnesium (Mg) is in Group 2, Period 3. 

1. **Atomic Radius Trend**:  
   Atomic radius decreases across a period from left to right due to increasing nuclear charge, which pulls electrons closer to the nucleus. Since sodium is to the left of magnesium, it should have a larger atomic radius. The given atomic radius of magnesium is 160 pm, so sodium's atomic radius should be larger than this. Sodium's atomic radius is typically around 186 pm.

2. **Ionization Energy Trend**:  
   Ionization energy generally increases across a period from left to right because atoms hold onto their electrons more tightly as nuclear charge increases. Sodium, being to the left of magnesium, should have a lower first ionization energy. Magnesium's first ionization energy is given as 737 kJ/mol, so sodium's should be less than this. Sodium's first ionization energy is approximately 496 kJ/mol.

3. **Evaluating Options**:  
   - **Option A**: 186 pm, 898 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as the ionization energy is higher than magnesium's, which contradicts the trend.  
   - **Option B**: 170 pm, 600 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as the atomic radius is smaller than sodium's expected value.  
   - **Option C**: 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as the atomic radius is far too small.  
   - **Option D**: 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol — Correct, as it matches the expected atomic radius and ionization energy for sodium.  
   - **Option E**: 147 pm, 523 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as the atomic radius is too small.  
   - **Option F**: 135 pm, 496 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as the atomic radius is too small.  
   - **Option G**: 160 pm, 737 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as these are magnesium's values, not sodium's.  
   - **Option H**: 170 pm, 523 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as the atomic radius is smaller than expected.  
   - **Option I**: 147 pm, 898 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as both the atomic radius and ionization energy are inconsistent with sodium's properties.  
   - **Option J**: 186 pm, 737 kJ/mol — Incorrect, as the ionization energy is too high.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option D: 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol**, as it aligns with the expected trends for sodium's atomic radius and ionization energy.
