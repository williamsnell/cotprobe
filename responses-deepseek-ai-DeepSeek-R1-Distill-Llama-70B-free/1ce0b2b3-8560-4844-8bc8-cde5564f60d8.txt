Okay, so I've got this question here about identifying which option lists only minerals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my geology, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question is asking which of the options A to J includes minerals only. So I remember that minerals are naturally occurring inorganic elements or compounds with a specific chemical composition and a crystalline structure. Rocks, on the other hand, are made up of one or more minerals. So I need to go through each option and check each item to see if it's a mineral or a rock.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: Coal, chert, limestone, dolomite, halite.
Coal is a fossil fuel, made of organic material, so it's not a mineral. Chert is a type of sedimentary rock. Limestone is also a rock, mostly calcium carbonate from shells. Dolomite is a mineral, but also the name of a rock that contains it. Wait, no, dolomite is a carbonate mineral. Wait, no, wait. Dolostone is the rock, whereas dolomite is the mineral. So in this case, dolomite is a mineral. Halite is the mineral form of salt, so that's a mineral. But since coal and chert and limestone are rocks, this option is out.

Option B: Iron, copper, zinc, lead, granite.
Iron, copper, zinc, lead are all elements, so they're minerals. But granite is a type of igneous rock, so that's not a mineral. So B includes a rock, so it's not correct.

Option C: Diamond, quartz, gypsum, salt, chalk.
Diamond is a mineral. Quartz too. Gypsum is a mineral. Salt is a mineral (halite). Chalk is a soft, white, porous sedimentary rock. So chalk isn't a mineral. So C is out.

Option D: Gneiss, schist, phyllite, chlorite, mica.
Gneiss and schist are types of metamorphic rocks. Phyllite is also a metamorphic rock. Chlorite is a group of minerals, and mica is a group of minerals. So this option has rocks and minerals. So D is out because it includes rocks.

Option E: Coal, quartz, gold, diamond, copper.
Coal isn't a mineral. The others are minerals. So E has a non-mineral, so it's out.

Option F: Marble, obsidian, basalt, quartz, diamond.
Marble is a metamorphic rock. Obsidian is a volcanic glass, so also a rock. Basalt is an igneous rock. Quartz and diamond are minerals. So F includes rocks, so it's out.

Option G: Sandstone, shale, limestone, diamond, gold.
Sandstone, shale, limestone are all sedimentary rocks. Diamond and gold are minerals. So G includes rocks, so it's out.

Option H: Granite, gabbro, diorite, quartz, feldspar.
Granite, gabbro, diorite are all igneous rocks. Quartz and feldspar are minerals. So H has rocks, so it's out.

Option I: Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, corundum.
All of these are minerals. Gold is a native element, so yes. Quartz is a mineral. Topaz, diamond, corundumâ€”all minerals. So I looks like a contender.

Option J: Granite, topaz, marble, quartz, feldspar.
Granite and marble are rocks. The others are minerals. So J includes rocks, so it's out.

Wait, let me double-check option I. Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, corundum. All minerals, right? Yes. Gold is a native element, so it qualifies. Same with the others.

So the correct answer should be option I.

To determine which option lists only minerals, we need to identify whether each item in the options is a mineral. Minerals are naturally occurring inorganic substances with a specific chemical composition and crystalline structure. Rocks, in contrast, are composed of one or more minerals.

- **Option A**: Coal (not a mineral), chert (rock), limestone (rock), dolomite (mineral), halite (mineral). *Includes rocks, so incorrect.*
- **Option B**: Iron (mineral), copper (mineral), zinc (mineral), lead (mineral), granite (rock). *Includes a rock, so incorrect.*
- **Option C**: Diamond (mineral), quartz (mineral), gypsum (mineral), salt (mineral), chalk (rock). *Includes a rock, so incorrect.*
- **Option D**: Gneiss (rock), schist (rock), phyllite (rock), chlorite (mineral), mica (mineral). *Includes rocks, so incorrect.*
- **Option E**: Coal (not a mineral), quartz (mineral), gold (mineral), diamond (mineral), copper (mineral). *Includes a non-mineral, so incorrect.*
- **Option F**: Marble (rock), obsidian (rock), basalt (rock), quartz (mineral), diamond (mineral). *Includes rocks, so incorrect.*
- **Option G**: Sandstone (rock), shale (rock), limestone (rock), diamond (mineral), gold (mineral). *Includes rocks, so incorrect.*
- **Option H**: Granite (rock), gabbro (rock), diorite (rock), quartz (mineral), feldspar (mineral). *Includes rocks, so incorrect.*
- **Option I**: Gold (mineral), quartz (mineral), topaz (mineral), diamond (mineral), corundum (mineral). *All are minerals, so correct.*
- **Option J**: Granite (rock), topaz (mineral), marble (rock), quartz (mineral), feldspar (mineral). *Includes rocks, so incorrect.*

The only option that lists minerals exclusively is **Option I**.

Answer: I
