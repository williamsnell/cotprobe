Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy gap in titanium dioxide. Hmm, I remember that when a material absorbs light, it promotes an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. The energy required for this is the band gap energy. Right, so the question says that the wavelength of light needed is less than 350 nm. Wait, wait, so the photon's energy has to be equal to or greater than the band gap, right?

So I think the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Oh wait, but the units here are important. I remember that 1 electronvolt (eV) is about 1.6e-19 joules. 

Let me jot down the numbers. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ here is 350 nm, but wait, nm is nanometers, so I should convert that to meters. 350 nm is 350e-9 meters, right?

So plugging into the equation, E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (350e-9 m). Let me compute that. The numerator is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 350e-9 m gives (1.9878e-25) / (350e-9) = approximately 5.68e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but I need to convert that energy into electronvolts. Since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, I can divide the energy in joules by 1.6e-19 to get eV. So 5.68e-18 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = let's see, 5.68 / 1.6 is about 3.55 eV. Oh wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 5.68e-18 divided by 1.6e-19 is (5.68 / 1.6) * (1e-18/1e-19) ) → 3.55 * 10 = 35.5? No, that can't be right because that would give 35.5 eV, which is way too high. Oh, wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me redo that.

5.68e-18 J divided by 1.6e-19 J/eV is equal to (5.68 /1.6) * (e-18 / e-19) ) → 3.55 * 10^(1) ) → 35.5 eV. But that's way too high because band gaps are typically a few eV. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. What did I do wrong?

Oh wait, wait! I think I made a mistake in the calculation of E. Let me recalculate E. So E = hc/λ → h is 6.626e-34, c is 3e8, λ is 350e-9. Let me compute hc first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then, divide by λ, which is 350e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 350e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 3.5e-7 → Let's compute this division.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 divided by 3.5e-7 is (1.9878 / 3.5) * 1e(-25 +7) → 0.5682 * 1e-18 → 5.682e-19 J? Wait, no, wait. Because 350e-9 is 3.5e-7 meters. So 1.9878e-25 / 3.5e-7 → Let's compute the exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-7 = 1e-18. So 1.9878 /3.5 is approximately 0.568, so 0.568e-18 J, which is 5.68e-19 J. Oh, right! So that's 5.68e-19 J per photon.

Now, converting that to eV: 5.68e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV. So 5.68 / 1.602 ≈ 3.54 eV. Oh, that makes more sense. So the energy gap is about 3.54 eV.

Looking back at the options, option G is 3.54 eV. So the correct answer should be G. But wait, the question says the wavelength is less than 350 nm. Oh wait, because the energy is inversely proportional to wavelength. So if the required wavelength is less than 350 nm, that means the energy must be higher than the energy corresponding to 350 nm. Because lower wavelength (higher frequency) means higher energy.

Wait, but wait. The question states that the promotion requires a wavelength of less than 350 nm. So the photon's energy must be greater than or equal to the band gap. So the minimum energy is when λ is 350 nm. So the energy I calculated (3.54 eV) is the minimum energy required, which is the band gap. So that would match option G.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option G is 3.54 eV. So yes, that's the one.

To calculate the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands in pure $\mathrm{TiO}_2$, we use the relationship between the energy of a photon and its wavelength: 

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}$ (Planck's constant),
- $c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s}$ (speed of light),
- $\lambda = 350 \, \mathrm{nm} = 350 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m}$ (wavelength of light).

First, calculate the energy in joules:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3.0 \times 10^8)}{350 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{350 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.68 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

Next, convert this energy to electronvolts using the conversion factor $1 \, \mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J}$:

\[
E = \frac{5.68 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.54 \, \mathrm{eV}.
\]

The question specifies that the wavelength of light required is less than $350 \, \mathrm{nm}$, meaning the energy of the photon must be greater than or equal to the energy corresponding to $350 \, \mathrm{nm}$. Thus, the calculated energy of $3.54 \, \mathrm{eV}$ represents the minimum energy required to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, which is the energy gap.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: 3.54 eV**
