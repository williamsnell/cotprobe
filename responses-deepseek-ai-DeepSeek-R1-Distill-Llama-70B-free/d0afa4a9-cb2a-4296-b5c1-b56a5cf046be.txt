Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the solubility product constant (Ksp) of pure PbSO4 in water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, the solubility product constant is a measure of the solubility of a compound in water. When a sparingly soluble salt like PbSO4 dissolves, it dissociates into its ions. The Ksp is calculated based on the concentrations of these ions.

The problem states that the solubility of PbSO4 at 25°C is 1.25 × 10^-4 moles per liter. I think solubility (s) is the amount that dissolves, and each mole of PbSO4 will produce one mole of Pb²+ and one mole of SO4^2- ions. So the concentration of each ion should be equal to the solubility.

Wait, right. The dissolution equation is PbSO4(s) ⇌ Pb²+(aq) + SO4^2−(aq). So if the solubility is s, then [Pb²+] = s and [SO4^2−] = s.

Ksp is the product of the ion concentrations, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. Here, both coefficients are 1, so Ksp = [Pb²+][SO4^2−] = s * s = s².

Wait a second, that's right. So substituting the given solubility, s = 1.25e-4 M. Then Ksp = (1.25e-4)^2.

Calculating that: 1.25 squared is 1.5625, and 10^-4 squared is 10^-8. So 1.5625e-8. Let me check that again: 1.25 * 1.25 is 1.5625, yes.

But looking at the options, I don't see 1.56e-8. Let me look through the options again.

Option E is 2.5e-8, which is higher. Option C is 1.6e-8, which is close. Wait, 1.56 is approximately 1.6 when rounded to two significant figures. Oh wait, the given solubility is 1.25e-4, which has three significant figures. So maybe my calculation should carry more decimals.

Wait, 1.25 times 1.25 is exactly 1.5625. So 1.5625e-8. Now, looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 6.25e-9
B:7.8e-8
C:1.6e-8
D:1.0e-7
E:2.5e-8
F:5e-8
G:0.8e-8
H:2e-9
I:3.2e-8
J:4e-8

So option C is 1.6e-8, which is close to 1.5625e-8. Hmm, but why isn't there an option exactly matching 1.56e-8? Because sometimes, the choices round off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Solubility s = 1.25e-4 M. So Ksp = s^2 = (1.25e-4)^2.

Calculating 1.25 squared: 1.25 * 1.25. 1 * 1 is 1, 1 * 0.25 is 0.25, 0.25 * 1 is 0.25, 0.25 * 0.25 is 0.0625. So sum all (1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.0625) = 1.5625.

So yeah, 1.5625e-8. Now, looking at the choices, the closest is C:1.6e-8. But wait, option E is 2.5e-8, which is higher. Did I miscalculate?

Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Wait, another thought: sometimes the solubility product is written differently. For PbSO4, the formula is PbSO4, which gives Pb²+ and SO4^2- in a 1:1 ratio. So Ksp = (s)(s) = s², which is correct.

So Ksp should be (1.25e-4)^2 = 1.5625e-8. So that's 1.5625 × 10^-8, which is 1.56 × 10^-8 when rounded to three significant figures. But in the options, the closest is option C:1.6e-8. Because 1.56 rounds to 1.6 when using two decimal places or considering significant figures?

Wait, the solubility is given as 1.25e-4, which is three significant figures. So Ksp would be calculated to three significant figures. 1.5625e-8 can be written as 1.56e-8, which is three sig figs. But looking at the options, option C is 1.6e-8, which is two sig figs. Hmm, none of the options present 1.56e-8.

Wait, perhaps I missed an option. Let me recheck the options:

Option C: 1.6 × 10^-8
Option I: 3.2 × 10^-8
Option E: 2.5 × 10^-8
Option J:4.0 × 10^-8

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute (1.25e-4)^2 again.

1.25e-4 is 0.000125. Squared is 0.000125 * 0.000125 = 0.000000015625.

Which is 1.5625 × 10^-8. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, the correct value isn't listed as an exact match. The closest is option C, which is 1.6e-8. But wait, maybe I missed an option. Let me check all the options again.

Wait, the options given are A to J. Let me list them:

A:6.25e-9 (too small)
B:7.8e-8 (bigger)
C:1.6e-8 (close)
D:1.0e-7 (much bigger)
E:2.5e-8 (bigger)
F:5.0e-8 (much bigger)
G:0.8e-8 (smaller)
H:2.0e-9 (too small)
I:3.2e-8 (bigger)
J:4.0e-8 (bigger)

Hmm, so none of the options exactly say 1.56e-8, but option C is 1.6e-8, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, am I sure about the dissolution equation? PbSO4 → Pb²+ + SO4^2-.

Yes. So each mole gives one mole of each ion. So Ksp = [Pb²+][SO4^2-] = s * s = s^2.

Yes. So s is 1.25e-4, so s squared is (1.25)^2=1.5625, and (e-4)^2 is e-8. So 1.5625e-8.

So the correct Ksp is 1.56e-8. Now, looking at the options, the closest is option C:1.6e-8. But wait, that's 1.6, which is a bit higher than 1.56. Let me check if any other option is closer. For example, option E is 2.5e-8, which is much higher. Option G is 0.8e-8, which is lower.

So the correct answer should be C:1.6e-8.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the exact value isn't in the options. Perhaps I should check the problem statement again.

The question says, "Calculate the solubility product constant of pure PbSO4 in water. The solubility of PbSO4 in water at 25°C is 1.25 × 10^-4 moles/liter."

Ah, maybe I made a mistake in squaring 1.25e-4. Let me compute that again. 1.25 * 1.25 is 1.5625, correct. So 1.5625e-8.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but I have to choose from the given options. So the closest is option C:1.6e-8.

Alternatively, maybe I should write 1.56e-8 and see if any option presents that, but it doesn't. So I think the correct answer is option C.

To calculate the solubility product constant (Ksp) of PbSO₄, we start with its dissolution equation:

\[
\text{PbSO}_4(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Pb}^{2+}(aq) + \text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)
\]

The solubility product constant is given by:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Pb}^{2+}][\text{SO}_4^{2-}]
\]

Since the solubility of PbSO₄ is \( s = 1.25 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol/L} \), the concentrations of \(\text{Pb}^{2+}\) and \(\text{SO}_4^{2-}\) are both equal to \( s \). Therefore:

\[
K_{sp} = s^2 = (1.25 \times 10^{-4})^2
\]

Calculating \( (1.25 \times 10^{-4})^2 \):

\[
(1.25)^2 = 1.5625 \quad \text{and} \quad (10^{-4})^2 = 10^{-8}
\]

Thus:

\[
K_{sp} = 1.5625 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{mol}^2/\text{L}^2
\]

This value rounds to \( 1.6 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{mol}^2/\text{L}^2 \) when considering significant figures. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**C: \( 1.6 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{mol}^2/\text{L}^2 \)**.

Other options, such as \( 1.0 \times 10^{-7} \) or \( 2.5 \times 10^{-8} \), are either too large or too small to be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: \( 1.6 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{mol}^2/\text{L}^2 \)**.
