Okay, so I've got this question about classical conditioning, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about how to eliminate a classically conditioned response. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one. Hmm, I remember that classical conditioning is all about associating stimuli with responses. Like Pavlov's dogs, right? They learned to salivate when they heard a bell ring because it was paired with food.

So, the main concept here is how to get rid of this learned response. I think this process is called extinction. From what I recall, extinction happens when the conditioned stimulus (like the bell) is presented without the unconditioned stimulus (like the food). Over time, the response (salivation) should decrease and eventually stop because the association is broken. 

Wait, let me make sure. So in Pavlov's experiment, every time the bell rang, the dogs were given food. But if you stop giving the food and just ring the bell repeatedly, the dogs will eventually stop salivating when they hear the bell. That makes sense. It's like when you unlearn something because it's no longer relevant.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says the unconditioned stimulus is presented a few seconds before the conditioned. That sounds like it's about changing the order, maybe affecting the conditioning, but not extinction.

Option B is a neutral stimulus. Not sure how that would eliminate the response. A neutral stimulus is one that doesn't naturally elicit a response, so maybe it's irrelevant here.

Option C is both conditioned and unconditioned presented together. That's just the usual conditioning process, so it would reinforce the response, not eliminate it.

Option D is a neutral stimulus right after the unconditioned. I don't think that does much for extinction. Maybe it's a distraction, but not the main method.

Option E is the unconditioned without a neutral. That doesn't seem right either. If you present the unconditioned without the conditioned, you're not addressing the learned association.

Option F is conditioned immediately after unconditioned. That might be another way of pairing, but I'm not sure how it affects extinction.

Option G is the conditioned without the unconditioned. Oh wait, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. If you present the conditioned stimulus (bell) without the unconditioned (food), the response should extinguish.

Option H is conditioned with a neutral. Not sure how that plays in. Maybe introducing a new neutral might not directly cause extinction.

Option I is unconditioned without conditioned. So presenting the food without ringing the bell. I don't think that affects the conditioned response because the conditioned stimulus isn't being presented to learn otherwise.

Option J is conditioned a few seconds before unconditioned. That's changing the timing of the stimuli, but again, not sure how that would eliminate the response.

So, putting it all together, the correct method to eliminate the conditioned response is to present the conditioned stimulus without the unconditioned one. That's option G.

To eliminate a classically conditioned response, the process of extinction is used. This involves presenting the conditioned stimulus (e.g., the bell in Pavlov's experiment) without the unconditioned stimulus (e.g., the food). Over time, this breaks the association, and the conditioned response (e.g., salivation) diminishes and eventually stops.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Presenting the unconditioned stimulus before the conditioned stimulus does not eliminate the response; it may alter the conditioning but not extinguish it.  
- **Option B**: A neutral stimulus alone has no direct role in extinction.  
- **Option C**: Presenting both stimuli simultaneously reinforces the conditioning rather than eliminating it.  
- **Option D**: A neutral stimulus after the unconditioned stimulus is irrelevant to extinction.  
- **Option E**: The unconditioned stimulus without a neutral stimulus does not address the conditioned response.  
- **Option F**: The conditioned stimulus immediately after the unconditioned stimulus may alter the timing but does not extinguish the response.  
- **Option G**: The conditioned stimulus without the unconditioned stimulus is the correct method for extinction, as it breaks the association.  
- **Option H**: The conditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus does not directly lead to extinction.  
- **Option I**: The unconditioned stimulus without the conditioned stimulus does not affect the conditioned response.  
- **Option J**: The conditioned stimulus before the unconditioned stimulus changes the timing but does not eliminate the response.  

Thus, the correct answer is **G**, as it describes the extinction process where the conditioned stimulus is presented without the unconditioned stimulus.  

Answer: G
