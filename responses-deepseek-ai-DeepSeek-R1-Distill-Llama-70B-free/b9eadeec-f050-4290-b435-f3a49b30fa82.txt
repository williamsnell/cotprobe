Okay, so I've got this problem here about Laplace transforms and finding the current i(0+) in an RC circuit. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. I think the Laplace transform is a tool used to solve differential equations, especially in circuits. 

The problem gives me the Laplace transform of i(t), which is I(s) = [E - V(0+)] / [R(s + (1/RC))]. Wait, V(0+) is the initial voltage across the capacitor, right? Because in an RC circuit, the capacitor's voltage can't change instantly, so at t=0+, the voltage is V(0+).

I remember that when dealing with Laplace transforms, the initial conditions are captured in the transform. Oh right, the inverse Laplace transform would give me i(t), but I need to find i at t=0+. I think the value of a function immediately after a discontinuity (like at t=0) can be found using the initial value theorem.

The initial value theorem says that the limit as t approaches 0 from the positive side of f(t) is equal to the limit as s approaches infinity of s times F(s), where F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). So, in this case, i(0+) should be the limit as s approaches infinity of s * I(s).

Let me write that down. So,

i(0+) = lim(s→∞) s * I(s)

Substituting I(s):

I(s) = [E - V(0+)] / [R(s + 1/RC)]

So s*I(s) becomes s * [E - V(0+)] / [R(s + 1/RC)].

Hmm, I can factor this as [E - V(0+)] / R multiplied by [s / (s + 1/RC)].

Now, when s approaches infinity, the term s/(s + 1/RC) simplifies. Let me think, dividing numerator and denominator by s gives 1/(1 + (1/(RC s))). As s approaches infinity, the second term in the denominator becomes negligible, so it approaches 1.

So the limit becomes [E - V(0+)]/R * 1 = (E - V(0+))/R.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option J is [E - V(0+)]/R, which matches what I got. But wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in applying the theorem?

Wait another thought: Alternatively, maybe I should consider the inverse Laplace transform of I(s). Let's see what I(s) looks like. It's of the form K / (s + a), where K is [E - V(0+)]/R and a is 1/RC. The inverse Laplace of 1/(s+a) is e^(-a t). So the inverse transform would be K e^(-a t). So i(t) = [E - V(0+)]/(R) e^(-t/RC).

Then, evaluating i(0+), that's when t=0. e^0 is 1, so i(0+) = [E - V(0+)]/(R), which is the same result as before. So that makes me confident.

Looking back at the options, option J says [E - V(0+)]/R. So the correct answer should be option J.

To determine \( i(0^+) \) in the given RC circuit, we start with the Laplace transform of the current:

\[
I(s) = \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R(s + \frac{1}{RC})}.
\]

Using the initial value theorem, the current at \( t = 0^+ \) is given by:

\[
i(0^+) = \lim_{s \to \infty} s \cdot I(s).
\]

Substituting \( I(s) \) into the expression:

\[
i(0^+) = \lim_{s \to \infty} s \cdot \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R(s + \frac{1}{RC})}.
\]

Factoring out constants:

\[
i(0^+) = \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R} \cdot \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{s}{s + \frac{1}{RC}}.
\]

As \( s \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{s}{s + \frac{1}{RC}} \) simplifies to 1. Therefore:

\[
i(0^+) = \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R}.
\]

This matches option **J**, which is \( \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R} \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**J**
