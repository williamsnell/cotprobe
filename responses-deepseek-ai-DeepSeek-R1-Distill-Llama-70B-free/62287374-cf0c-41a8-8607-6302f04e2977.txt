Question:

A previously healthy 40-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of constant substernal chest pain for 12 hours that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration. The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward. There is no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38째C (100.4째F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues?

Options:

A: Pulmonary alveoli
B: Aortic intima
C: Myocardium
D: Cardiac valves
E: Vascular endothelium
F: Esophageal sphincter
G: Pleural membrane
H: Tracheal tissue
I: Bronchial epithelium
J: Pericardium

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The patient is a 40-year-old man who's previously healthy. He's brought to the emergency department with constant substernal chest pain that's been going on for 12 hours. The pain gets worse when he coughs or takes a breath in. But when he sits up and leans forward, the pain eases. Hmm, that's an interesting clue.

His vital signs show a temperature of 38째C, so he's got a fever. His pulse is 120 beats per minute, which is tachycardic, and his blood pressure is 110/60, a bit on the lower side. The lungs are clear on auscultation, which probably rules out something like pneumonia. The cardiac exam shows distant heart sounds, which I think might be a sign of something like a pericardial effusion because the fluid can muffle the sounds. 

The ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. Wait, ST elevation in all leads? That doesn't sound like a typical myocardial infarction, where you might see ST elevation in specific regions corresponding to the affected coronary artery. Diffuse ST elevation could be indicative of pericarditis because the inflammation affects the entire pericardium. 

The chest X-ray is normal, so no signs of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. That makes me think it's not a lung issue causing the chest pain. 

Putting this together, the chest pain characteristics are classic for pericarditis. The pain is substernal, sharp, and improves when sitting up and leaning forward. That's a textbook description. The ECG changes support this too, as pericarditis often leads to widespread ST-segment elevation due to the inflammation of the pericardium surrounding the heart.

The other symptoms like fever also point towards an inflammatory or infectious cause. Pericarditis can be caused by viral infections, which would explain the fever and the absence of other cardiac risk factors (like family history of heart disease). 

Looking at the options, the question is about which tissue is injured. The pericardium is the sac surrounding the heart, so if that's inflamed, that's pericarditis. So the tissue injured would be the pericardium.

Wait, let me just check the options again. Option J is the pericardium. So the answer should be J.

The patient is a 40-year-old man with substernal chest pain that worsens with coughing and inspiration but improves when sitting up and leaning forward. He has a fever (38째C), tachycardia (120/min), and low blood pressure (110/60 mm Hg). The lungs are clear, but heart sounds are distant. The ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads, and the chest X-ray is normal.

The clinical presentation, particularly the chest pain characteristics and ECG findings, strongly suggests acute pericarditis. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. The pain improvement when sitting up and leaning forward is a classic feature of pericarditis. The diffuse ST-segment elevation on the ECG is also consistent with this diagnosis, as it reflects inflammation of the pericardium rather than a localized myocardial infarction. The fever supports an inflammatory or infectious cause, which is common in pericarditis.

Given the evidence, the injured tissue is the pericardium.

Answer: J
