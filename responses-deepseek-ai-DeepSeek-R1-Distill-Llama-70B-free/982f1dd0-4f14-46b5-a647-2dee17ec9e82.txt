Okay, so I've got this question about financial ratios, specifically the current ratio. Let me see... I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out.

Alright, the question is about Jefferson's Clothing. They have current assets of $150,000, current liabilities of $50,000, and capital of $200,000. The question is asking for their current ratio.

Wait, what's the current ratio again? From what I remember, it's a liquidity ratio that helps assess a company's ability to pay its short-term debts. The formula should be current assets divided by current liabilities. Yeah, that sounds right.

So plugging in the numbers: current assets are 150,000, and current liabilities are 50,000. So the calculation would be 150,000 divided by 50,000. Let me do that math: 150k divided by 50k is 3. So the current ratio is 3.

Looking at the options, option H is 3. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because sometimes people mix up the current ratio with the quick ratio. Oh right, the quick ratio excludes inventory, but the current ratio includes all current assets. So in this case, the question definitely asks for the current ratio, so using all current assets is correct.

I think I've got this right. The current ratio is 3, which matches option H.

The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. For Jefferson's Clothing, this is $150,000 divided by $50,000, which equals 3.

H: 3

Answer: H
