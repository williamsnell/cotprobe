Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about atoms emitting alpha or beta particles. Hmm, I need to figure out what happens to the atom when it emits these particles. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that alpha and beta particles are types of radiation emitted during radioactive decay. An alpha particle is a helium nucleus, right? So it's two protons and two neutrons. When an atom emits an alpha particle, it's losing those protons and neutrons. That must affect the atomic number because the number of protons changes. Oh wait, the atomic number is the number of protons, so losing two protons would decrease the atomic number by two. So the element would change because the atomic number defines the element.

Then, what about beta particles? Beta particles are electrons, right? But when emitted from the nucleus, it's actually a neutron turning into a proton, emitting an electron (beta particle) in the process. So in beta decay, the number of protons increases by one. That would increase the atomic number by one, changing the element as well.

Wait, so both alpha and beta emission change the atomic number. That means the atom becomes a different element. So looking at the options, I need to find which one matches that.

Option B says "becomes an atom of a different element always." That sounds right because both types of decay change the atomic number, thus changing the element. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: Changes atomic number but same element? No, because atomic number determines the element. So A is wrong.

Option C: Same element and isotope? No, because the element changes, so C is wrong.

Option D: Different element with same mass? No, because alpha decay reduces mass (loses 4 mass units) and beta doesn't change mass number, but the mass number isn't the same as atomic mass. Wait, atomic mass is protons plus neutrons. In beta decay, a neutron becomes a proton, so mass number (total nucleons) stays the same, but atomic number increases. So in beta decay, the atomic mass number doesn't change, but the element does. Hmm, but for alpha decay, mass number decreases by 4. So in any case, the element changes.

Wait, so the question is about any atom emitting alpha or beta. So in either case, the element changes. So the correct answer should be that it becomes a different element every time.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: becomes a different element always.

Option H: may become a different element. Wait, may? No, because in both cases, it does change. So H is not correct.

So the correct answer must be B. Because whenever an alpha or beta particle is emitted, the atomic number changes, leading to a different element.
</think>

When an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses two protons and two neutrons, decreasing its atomic number by two and changing the element. When it emits a beta particle, a neutron converts into a proton, increasing the atomic number by one and also changing the element. In both cases, the atomic number changes, which means the atom becomes a different element. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Changing the atomic number means the element changes.  
- **B**: Correct. Emission of alpha or beta particles always results in a different element.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The element changes, so it cannot remain the same.  
- **D**: Incorrect. The mass number changes in alpha decay, and the element always changes.  
- **E**: Incorrect. The element always changes, not just sometimes.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Mass changes in alpha decay but not in beta decay.  
- **G**: Incorrect. The atom does not become an ion; it becomes a different element.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The element always changes, so it is not a matter of "may."  
- **I**: Incorrect. The element changes, so it is not the same element.  
- **J**: Incorrect. Mass does not increase in either type of decay.  

The correct answer is **B**: becomes an atom of a different element always.

Answer: B
