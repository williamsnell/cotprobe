The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?

Options:

A: 90%
B: 80%
C: 1%
D: 60%
E: 20%
F: 40%
G: 70%
H: 50%
I: 10%
J: 30%

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this statistics question about a randomized controlled trial. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question is about a study comparing a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) with a standard single-drug therapy. The participants are 140 women and 60 men, so 200 in total. Their baseline blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The effectiveness is defined as getting BP below 140/90.

The key part is about the probabilities set by the investigators. They set the probability of wrongly finding Drug X is more effective as 1%. That sounds like the alpha level, which is the Type I error rate. So alpha is 0.01, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually trueâ€”in this case, concluding Drug X is better when it's not.

Then, they set the probability of wrongly finding that the two drugs are the same as 10%. Wait, that's the beta level, right? Beta is the Type II error rate, the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false. So beta is 0.10 here.

The question is asking for the statistical power of the study. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. I remember that power is 1 minus beta. So if beta is 0.10, power is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90, which is 90%. 

Looking at the options, option A is 90%. That seems to be the answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up alpha and beta.

Wait, alpha is the significance level, the cutoff for rejecting the null. Beta is the probability of a Type II error, which is failing to detect a true effect. So power is the ability to detect an effect if it's there. So yeah, if beta is 10%, then power is 90%. 

I don't think the other details like sample size or the specific drugs affect the power calculation in this question because they're asking about the definition of power based on the given alpha and beta. So the answer should be A: 90%.

The question involves a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) with a standard single-drug therapy. The investigators set the probability of a Type I error (alpha) at 1% and the probability of a Type II error (beta) at 10%. Statistical power is defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true and is calculated as \(1 - \beta\). Given that \(\beta = 0.10\), the power is \(1 - 0.10 = 0.90\), or 90%. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

A: 90%
