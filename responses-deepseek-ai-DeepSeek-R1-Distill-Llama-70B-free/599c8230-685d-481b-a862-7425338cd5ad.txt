Okay, so I have this problem about potassium-40 and K2SO4. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is about determining the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in potassium-40 (K-40) when it's part of K2SO4. The options are provided from A to J.

I remember that the atomic number of potassium is 19. That means each potassium atom has 19 protons. Since isotopes have the same atomic number, K-40 should also have 19 protons. Wait, but waitâ€”wait, no, no. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Potassium's atomic number is 19, so yeah, each K atom has 19 protons.

But wait, the isotope is K-40. So the mass number is 40. Mass number is protons plus neutrons. So protons are 19, so neutrons would be 40 - 19 = 21 neutrons. So each K-40 atom has 19 protons and 21 neutrons. Got that.

Now, the compound is K2SO4. Potassium sulfate, I think. In a compound, the electrons are involved in bonding, but the question is about each K-40 atom. So, when K is in a compound, it usually forms ions. Potassium is in group 1, so it typically loses one electron to form K+ ions. So each K+ ion has a +1 charge. 

Wait, but wait. The question is about the number of electrons in the K-40 when it's part of K2SO4. So as K+ ions. So the neutral K atom has 19 electrons. When it loses one electron, it has 18 electrons as K+.

Wait, but I have to make sure. The neutral potassium atom has 19 electrons. When it becomes K+, it loses one, so 18 electrons. So each K in K2SO4 is K+, so 18 electrons each.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check each option's protons, neutrons, and electrons.

So the K atom in K2SO4 is K+. So protons are 19, neutrons 21, electrons 18? Or wait, wait. Let me get this right.

Wait, no. The protons are fixed. The number of protons defines the element. So K is 19 protons. The neutrons are 21 because 40-19=21. Electrons in the ion: neutral K has 19 electrons. When it loses one, as K+, it has 18 electrons.

So in K2SO4, each K is K+ with 18 electrons.

So putting that together: 19 protons, 21 neutrons, 18 electrons.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons. So that's D.

Wait, let me scan through the options again to make sure.

Option D says 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons. Yes. That seems correct.

Wait, any other options with similar numbers?

Option F is 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons. No, because the electrons are 18 in the ion.

Option I: 22 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons. No, because neutrons are 21.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in potassium-40 (\(^{40}\text{K}\)) when it is part of potassium sulfate (\(\text{K}_2\text{SO}_4\)), we analyze the properties of the isotope and the compound:

1. **Protons**: Potassium has an atomic number of 19, meaning each potassium atom has 19 protons. This does not change when potassium forms ions or compounds.

2. **Neutrons**: The mass number of \(^{40}\text{K}\) is 40, which is the sum of protons and neutrons. Thus, the number of neutrons is \(40 - 19 = 21\).

3. **Electrons**: In its neutral state, a potassium atom has 19 electrons. However, in \(\text{K}_2\text{SO}_4\), potassium typically forms \( \text{K}^+ \) ions by losing one electron. Therefore, each \( \text{K}^+ \) ion has \(19 - 1 = 18\) electrons.

Combining these, potassium-40 in \(\text{K}_2\text{SO}_4\) has 19 protons, 21 neutrons, and 18 electrons. Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is:

**D: 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons.**
