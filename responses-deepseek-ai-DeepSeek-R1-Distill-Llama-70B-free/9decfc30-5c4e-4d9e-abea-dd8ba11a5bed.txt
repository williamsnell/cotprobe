Okay, so I have this question about insurance coverage. Let me read through it carefully. 

Thomas Siden has property-damage insurance on his car with a limit of $5,000. He damaged Frank Hartman's car, and the extent is $2,350. The question is, how much will his insurance company pay?

Hmm. So the insurance policy has a limit, which is the maximum amount they'll pay per claim. In this case, the limit is $5,000. The damage Thomas caused is $2,350, which is less than the limit. 

I remember that insurance companies typically cover up to the policy limit. So if the damage is below the limit, they pay the actual amount. If it's above, they pay up to the limit. 

So here, since $2,350 is less than $5,000, the insurance company should cover the full amount. That would mean the payment is $2,350.

Looking at the options, E is $2,350. So the answer should be E.

The insurance policy has a limit of $5,000, but the damage incurred is $2,350, which is below the limit. Therefore, the insurance company will pay the full amount of the damage.

Answer: E
