Okay, so I've got this economics question about expansionary monetary policy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... I remember that monetary policy has to do with the central bank controlling the money supply and interest rates. Expansionary policy is when they want to stimulate the economy, probably to get out of a recession or something.

Expansionsary monetary policy, I think, involves lowering interest rates. Because when interest rates are lower, borrowing becomes cheaper. So businesses might take loans to invest more, and consumers might borrow to buy big-ticket items like houses or cars. That would increase investment, right?

Wait, so if the central bank lowers interest rates, the cost of borrowing decreases. That should encourage private investment because companies can get loans more cheaply and invest in expansion or new projects. So private investment should increase.

Now, how does that affect aggregate demand? Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in the economy. If more people are buying things and businesses are investing, aggregate demand should go up. More demand means businesses produce more, which increases domestic outputâ€”like GDP.

So putting it together: expansionary monetary policy lowers interest rates, which increases private investment. Higher investment leads to higher aggregate demand, which in turn increases domestic output. So the options should have lower interest rates, higher private investment, higher aggregate demand, and higher domestic output.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says increase interest rate, which doesn't make sense because expansionary is about lowering rates. So A is out. Option B says decrease interest rate, but then it says decrease private investment, which contradicts what I thought. So B is wrong.

Option C starts with increasing interest rates again, so no. D says lower rates but then private investment increases? Wait no, D says decrease aggregate demand, which doesn't fit. E has higher rates, so no. F says lower rates, increase investment, but then it says increase unemployment rate. Wait, if output increases, unemployment should decrease, so F's last part might be wrong.

Option G: lower rates, but private investment decreases? No, that's opposite. H: lower rates, increase investment, increase aggregate demand, and increase output. That fits perfectly. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, let me double-check. Expansionary monetary policy aims to boost the economy. Lowering rates makes borrowing cheaper, so more investment. More investment leads to more production, so aggregate demand and output rise. So H should be correct.

Expansionary monetary policy is designed to stimulate economic activity by lowering interest rates. When interest rates decrease, borrowing becomes cheaper, which encourages private investment as businesses can more affordably take loans for expansion or new projects. Increased private investment leads to higher aggregate demand, as there is more spending on goods and services. This, in turn, boosts domestic output, such as GDP. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it suggests increasing interest rates, which contradicts the goal of expansionary policy.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it claims private investment decreases, which is inconsistent with the effects of lower interest rates.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it involves increasing interest rates.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it states aggregate demand decreases, which is not aligned with the expected outcome.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as it involves increasing interest rates.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it suggests an increase in the unemployment rate, which is unlikely when output increases.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it claims private investment decreases.
- **Option H**: Correct, as it accurately describes the effects of expansionary monetary policy: lower interest rates, increased private investment, higher aggregate demand, and increased domestic output.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it involves increasing interest rates.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as it involves increasing interest rates and decreasing aggregate demand.

Thus, the correct answer is **H**, as it aligns with the intended effects of expansionary monetary policy.

Answer: H
