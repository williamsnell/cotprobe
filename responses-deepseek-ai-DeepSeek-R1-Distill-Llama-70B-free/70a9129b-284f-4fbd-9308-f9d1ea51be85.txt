Question:

A man conveys to his wife's cousin a property to "cousin and the heirs of his body." He then conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. Under modern real estate laws and practice in most states today, what interest if any does his niece have?

Options:

A: The conveyance gives the niece nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to his wife's cousin.
B: She has an executory interest.
C: She has a fee simple.
D: She has a vested remainder.
E: She gets a leasehold interest.
F: She has a partial right, shared with the cousin's heirs.
G: A contingent remainder based upon whether or not cousin has heirs.
H: She gets a life estate.
I: She gets a reversion in case the cousin has no heir of his body at his death.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about property conveyances and estates. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about a man who conveys a property first to his wife's cousin and then to his niece. I need to figure out what interest the niece has under modern real estate laws.

Alright, let's break it down. The first conveyance is to the cousin "and the heirs of his body." Wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that a fee tail? Because when you convey to someone and the heirs of their body, that's a fee tail, which is a type of estate that can only be inherited by the grantee's direct descendants. If they die without heirs of their body, the property reverts to the grantor or their heirs.

So, the first conveyance gives the cousin a fee tail. That means the cousin has an estate that's limited to his lineal descendants. If he has kids, they inherit; if not, it goes back.

Then, the man conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. Wait, but he already gave it to the cousin. So what happens here? Does the second conveyance take effect immediately, or is it some kind of future interest?

In property law, when you have a fee tail, the grantor (the man in this case) has a reversion. A reversion is the future interest that the grantor retains when they convey a fee tail. So, if the cousin dies without any heirs of his body, the property comes back to the grantor or his heirs. 

But in this case, the grantor is trying to convey it again to his niece in fee simple. So does he have the authority to do that? Because he's already given the fee tail to the cousin. But wait, the grantor still has the reversion. So if he conveys the reversion to the niece, that might create a new interest.

Wait, the niece is getting the property in fee simple. So, does that mean she's getting the reversion? Because the first conveyance was fee tail, and the second is a fee simple. So the man's interest after the first conveyance is the reversion. So when he conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple, he's conveying his reversionary interest.

But wait, the reversion is a future interest. So the niece would get the reversion, which is a type of vested remainder? Or is it a contingent remainder? No, wait, the reversion is a vested remainder because it's a fixed eventâ€”when the cousin dies without heirs of his body. So the niece would have a vested remainder in fee simple, but it's subject to the prior estate (the fee tail) terminating.

Alternatively, maybe it's a contingent remainder because it's contingent on the cousin dying without heirs. But no, the reversion is always a vested interest because it's in the grantor, so when the grantor conveys it, it remains vested.

Wait, the grantor's reversion is automatically a vested remainder because it's a possibility that's certain to happen if the current estate ends without issue. So when he conveys the reversion to the niece, she gets a vested remainder. So her interest is a vested remainder in fee simple.

But wait, some might think that the second conveyance is void because the property was already given away. But no, because the grantor still has the reversion, so he can convey that. So the first conveyance gives the cousin a fee tail, and the second conveys the reversion (which is a vested remainder) to the niece.

So the niece has a vested remainder. Looking at the options, option D says she has a vested remainder. Option I says she gets a reversion in case the cousin has no heir. Wait, no, the reversion is what the grantor had, and he conveyed that to the niece, so the niece now holds the reversion, which is a vested remainder.

Wait, but option I says she gets a reversion. But reversion is the interest the grantor keeps after conveying a fee tail. So when the grantor conveys it to the niece, she gets the reversion, which is a type of future interest. So the niece's interest is a reversion, but in the context of the first conveyance, the cousin's estate is a fee tail, and the reversion is the future interest in the grantor. So when the grantor conveys his reversion to the niece, she now holds that reversion.

Wait, but reversion is a type of future interest. So the niece's interest is a reversion, which is a kind of future interest. But the options are about what interest she has. So looking back at the options:

A: Nothing, because already conveyed. No, because the grantor had the reversion to convey.

B: Executory interest. An executory interest is a type of future interest that cuts short another's interest, but it's more like a springing interest created by a condition. Here, the niece has a reversion, which is a type of vested remainder, I think.

C: Fee simple. No, because the first conveyance was fee tail, so the niece can't have a present fee simple.

D: Vested remainder. Yes, because the reversion is a vested remainder.

E: Leasehold. No, that's irrelevant here.

F: Partial right. No, the niece's interest is a future interest, not a present shared ownership.

G: Contingent remainder. No, because the reversion is vested, not contingent.

H: Life estate. No, the niece gets fee simple, which is a larger estate than a life estate.

I: Reversion in case cousin has no heir. Well, that's what the reversion is. But in this case, the niece holds the reversion, which is a vested remainder.

So between D and I. Option D says she has a vested remainder. Option I says she gets a reversion in case the cousin has no heir. But reversion is a type of future interest, which is a vested remainder. So I think D is correct.

Wait, but wait: when the grantor conveys the property to cousin in fee tail, the cousin gets the present estate, and the grantor has a reversion. When the grantor conveys his reversion to the niece, she now holds the reversion, which is a vested remainder. So her interest is a vested remainder in fee simple.

So the correct answer would be D: She has a vested remainder.

Under modern real estate laws, when a property is conveyed to someone "and the heirs of his body," it creates a fee tail. This means the grantee (the cousin) holds an estate that is limited to his lineal descendants. If the cousin dies without heirs of his body, the property reverts to the grantor or his heirs, creating a reversionary interest in the grantor.

In this case, the man first conveys the property to his wife's cousin in fee tail, giving the cousin a present estate. The man retains a reversion, which is a future interest that vests in him. Subsequently, the man conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. Since the man only retains the reversion after the first conveyance, he can transfer this reversionary interest to the niece. As a result, the niece receives a vested remainder in fee simple, which is a future interest that will take effect if the cousin dies without heirs of his body.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The niece does receive an interest because the man conveyed his reversion to her.
- **B**: Incorrect. An executory interest is not applicable here; the niece holds a vested remainder.
- **C**: Incorrect. The niece does not have a present fee simple; her interest is a future interest.
- **D**: Correct. The niece has a vested remainder in fee simple, as she holds the reversion conveyed by the man.
- **E**: Incorrect. A leasehold interest is irrelevant to this scenario.
- **F**: Incorrect. The niece does not share ownership; her interest is a future interest.
- **G**: Incorrect. The niece's interest is vested, not contingent.
- **H**: Incorrect. The niece does not have a life estate; she has a future interest in fee simple.
- **I**: Incorrect. While the niece's interest is contingent on the cousin dying without heirs, it is more accurately described as a vested remainder.

Thus, the niece has a vested remainder in fee simple.
