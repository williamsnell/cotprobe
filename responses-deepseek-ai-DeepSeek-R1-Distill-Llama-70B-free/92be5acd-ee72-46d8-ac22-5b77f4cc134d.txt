Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about correlation when changing units. Hmm, let me try to work through this.

The question says that the correlation between height in inches and weight in pounds is 0.65. Then, they convert height from inches to centimeters, and I need to find the new correlation. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, I remember that correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient, often denoted as r, ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 1 means a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 is perfect negative, and 0 means no linear relationship.

But how does changing the units of measurement affect this? Oh right, correlation is a measure that's unitless because it's based on standard deviations. So when you convert from inches to centimeters, you're just scaling the values, but not changing their relative proportions in terms of standard deviations.

Let me think about this more carefully. When you convert inches to centimeters, each inch is multiplied by 2.54 cm. So each height measurement is scaled by a factor of 2.54. But scaling a variable (like height) by a positive constant factor doesn't change its standard deviation in terms of relative units. Because when you calculate the correlation coefficient, you're using the covariance divided by the product of the standard deviations of each variable.

So the formula for Pearson's r is covariance(X,Y) divided by (std dev X * std dev Y). If I scale X by a factor a, say X' = aX, then std dev X' becomes a*std dev X. The covariance(X', Y) would be a*covariance(X, Y) because covariance is linear in X. So covariance(X', Y) = a * covariance(X,Y), and std dev X' is a * std dev X.

So r for X' and Y would be [a * covariance(X,Y)] / [a * std dev X * std dev Y] ] = covariance/(std X std Y) = same as before. So the scaling factor a cancels out.

Therefore, changing the unit from inches to cm (which is a linear transformation with a positive multiplier) won't change the correlation coefficient. So the correlation remains 0.65.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.65. So the answer should be J.

The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables and is unitless. When converting height from inches to centimeters, each measurement is scaled by a factor of 2.54 cm/inch. This scaling affects the mean and standard deviation of the height variable but does not alter the relative relationships between the data points. 

Correlation is calculated as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. Scaling one variable by a positive constant factor changes both the covariance and the standard deviation proportionally, but these changes cancel out in the calculation of the correlation coefficient. Therefore, the correlation remains unchanged when the units of measurement are converted.

Since the original correlation is 0.65, the correlation after converting height to centimeters remains 0.65. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

J: 0.65

Answer: J
