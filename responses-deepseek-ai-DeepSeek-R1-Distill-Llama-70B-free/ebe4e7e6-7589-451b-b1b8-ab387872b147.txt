Question:

Calculate the Gross Domestic Product using the total expenditure approach:
Consumption Expenditures | $500 billion
Wages and salaries | $400 billion

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using the total expenditure approach. Hmm, I remember that GDP can be calculated in a few different ways, but this one's specifically the expenditure method. Let me think about the formula.

From what I recall, the expenditure approach formula is GDP = C + I + G + (X - M). Where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, X is exports, and M is imports. Right? So I need to plug in all these values.

Looking at the data given:
- Consumption Expenditures (C) is $500 billion.
- Investment Expenditures (I) is $80 billion.
- Government Expenditures (G) is $100 billion.
- Exports (X) are $30 billion.
- Imports (M) are $50 billion.

Wait, but wait. There's also Wages and salaries at $400 billion and Taxes at $70 billion. Hmm, I'm not sure where those fit in. Oh, wait, maybe those are part of the income approach instead? Because in the expenditure approach, I don't think we use wages and taxes directly. So maybe I can ignore those for now, since the question is about the expenditure method.

So putting the numbers into the formula: C is 500, I is 80, G is 100, X is 30, and M is 50. So the equation becomes 500 + 80 + 100 + (30 - 50). Let's calculate that step by step.

First, 500 plus 80 is 580. Then adding 100 brings it to 680. Now, the exports minus imports part: 30 minus 50 is -20. So adding that to 680 gives me 660. Wait, but looking at the options, 660 is option J. But I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes the formula is written as C + I + G + X - M, which would be 500 +80+100+30-50.

Wait, let me check that again. 500 +80 is 580, plus 100 is 680. Then 30 minus 50 is -20. So 680 -20 is 660. So that's 660 billion. So the GDP would be $660 billion, which is option J.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh wait, taxes are not part of the expenditure approach. Because in the expenditure approach, government spending (G) includes all government purchases, but taxes are on the income side. So I shouldn't subtract taxes here. So my initial approach was correct.

So the calculation is indeed 500 +80 +100 +30 -50. Let me add those again. 500+80 is 580, plus 100 is 680. Add 30 gives 710, then subtract 50 gives 660. So 660 is the correct GDP.

Looking at the options, J is 660. So I think the answer is J.

To calculate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using the total expenditure approach, we use the formula:

\[
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = Consumption Expenditures = $500 billion
- \( I \) = Gross Private Investment Expenditures = $80 billion
- \( G \) = Government Expenditures = $100 billion
- \( X \) = Exports = $30 billion
- \( M \) = Imports = $50 billion

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[
GDP = 500 + 80 + 100 + (30 - 50)
\]

Breaking it down step by step:
1. \( 500 + 80 = 580 \)
2. \( 580 + 100 = 680 \)
3. \( 30 - 50 = -20 \)
4. \( 680 + (-20) = 660 \)

Thus, the GDP is $660 billion. The correct answer is:

J: 660
