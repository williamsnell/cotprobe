Okay, so I have this genetics question to tackle. Let's see what it's about. The question is about blood types and how they're inherited. Hmm, I remember that blood type is determined by the ABO system, which involves different alleles.

The question says a child has type A and B blood. Wait, no, correction: the child has type AB blood. Because type A has A antigens, type B has B antigens, and AB has both. Right, so the child inherited an IA allele from one parent and an IB allele from the other. IA and IB are the alleles that code for the A and B glycoproteins on red blood cells.

So, the child's genotype must be IA IB. Now, the question is about the pattern of expression here. It says the child carries both A and B glycoproteins on all red blood cells. I remember that in the ABO system, the IA and IB alleles are codominant. That means both alleles are expressed equally. So, unlike some other traits where one allele is recessive and the other is dominant, here both show their effect.

I'm trying to recall the terms. Codominance is when both alleles have an effect on the phenotype. For example, in blood type AB, both A and B are present, so you see both. Another example is the roan color in cattle, where both red and white are expressed as a mix.

Looking at the options, option E is codominance. Let me check the others to make sure. Option C is incomplete dominance, which is a bit different. Incomplete dominance is when the heterozygous condition results in a blending of the two homozygous traits. Like in snapdragons, where a red and white parent produce pink flowers. But in AB blood, both antigens are present, not a blend, so that's codominance, not incomplete dominance.

Recessive inheritance would mean that one allele is not expressed. But here, both IA and IB are expressed, so recessive doesn't apply. Genetic recombination (option B) is about the mixing of genes during meiosis, which isn't directly relevant here. The child's alleles came from each parent, but that's about how they were inherited, not the expression pattern.

Pleiotropy (option D) is when one gene affects multiple traits, which isn't the case here. Polygenic (option F) refers to multiple genes influencing a trait, but blood type is ABO, so two alleles. Dominant and recessive are more about one allele masking another, which isn't what happens in AB.

Epistasis (option H) is when one gene affects the expression of another gene, which isn't the situation here. Linkage (option I) is about genes being on the same chromosome and tends to be inherited together, but the question is about expression, not inheritance patterns. Genetic drift (option J) is a population genetics term and unrelated.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E: codominance.

The question involves a child with AB blood type, who inherits an IA allele from one parent and an IB allele from the other. This results in the expression of both A and B glycoproteins on the surface of red blood cells. In the ABO blood group system, the IA and IB alleles are codominant, meaning both alleles are expressed simultaneously in the heterozygous state, leading to the AB phenotype.

Analyzing the options:

- **A (recessive inheritance):** Incorrect, as both alleles are expressed, not just one.  
- **B (genetic recombination):** Irrelevant, as this refers to the mixing of genetic material during meiosis, not the expression pattern.  
- **C (incomplete dominance):** Incorrect, as incomplete dominance involves a blending of traits, whereas here both traits are fully expressed.  
- **D (pleiotropy):** Incorrect, as pleiotropy involves one gene affecting multiple traits, which is not applicable here.  
- **E (codominance):** Correct, as both IA and IB alleles are equally expressed, resulting in the AB phenotype.  
- **F (polygenic):** Incorrect, as polygenic traits involve multiple genes, but blood type is determined by two alleles of a single gene.  
- **G (dominant inheritance):** Incorrect, as dominance implies one allele masks the other, which is not the case here.  
- **H (epistasis):** Incorrect, as epistasis involves one gene affecting the expression of another, which is not relevant here.  
- **I (linkage):** Incorrect, as linkage refers to genes being inherited together, not the expression pattern.  
- **J (genetic drift):** Incorrect, as genetic drift pertains to population genetics and is unrelated to this question.  

The correct answer is **E: codominance**, as it accurately describes the simultaneous expression of both IA and IB alleles in the AB blood type.  

Answer: E
