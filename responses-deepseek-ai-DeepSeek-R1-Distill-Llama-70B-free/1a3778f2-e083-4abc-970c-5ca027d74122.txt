Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a mass attached to a wire oscillating. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the setup is a 10 kg mass on a table connected to a steel wire that's 5 meters long. When the table is removed, the wire stretches a bit, and the mass starts oscillating up and down. I need to find the frequency of these oscillations. The wire's cross-sectional area is 1 square millimeter, and Young's Modulus is given as 19e11 dynes per cm². Oh wait, units might be tricky here.

I remember that when dealing with oscillations like this, it's similar to a mass-spring system. So the formula for the frequency should be f = 1/(2π) * sqrt(k/m), where k is the spring constant. But wait, in this case, the wire isn't a spring; it's behaving more like one because it's stretching and then returning. So I need to find the effective spring constant of the wire.

Young's Modulus, Y, relates stress and strain. The formula is Y = (F/A)/(ΔL/L), which can be rearranged to F = (Y * A * ΔL)/L. Here, F is the force, A is the cross-sectional area, ΔL is the extension, and L is the original length.

Wait, but in a spring, the force is F = -kx, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement. So comparing the two equations, the effective spring constant k for the wire would be (Y * A)/L. Because F = (Y A ΔL)/L → k = Y A / L. Oh right, that makes sense.

So I can calculate k using Y, A, and L. Let's plug in the numbers.

But wait, the units are all over the place. Let me make sure I convert them correctly. Young's Modulus is given in dynes/cm². The area is in square millimeters, and length in meters. I need consistent units, probably SI units.

Let me convert everything to meters and kilograms and seconds.

First, Y is 19e11 dynes/cm². I know that 1 dyne is 1e-5 Newtons because 1 N = 1e5 dynes. Also, 1 cm is 0.01 meters. So 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m².

So Y in Pa (which is N/m²) is 19e11 dynes/cm² * (1e-5 N/dyne) / (1e-4 m²/cm²). Let's compute that.

Wait, let me compute the conversion step by step.

1 dyne = 1e-5 N
1 cm² = (1e-2 m)^2 = 1e-4 m².

So 1 dyne/cm² = (1e-5 N) / (1e-4 m²) )= 0.1 N/m².

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Because 1 dyne/cm² is (1e-5 N) per (1e-4 m²), so that's (1e-5)/(1e-4) = 0.1 N/m². So 1 dyne/cm² equals 0.1 N/m².

So Y = 19e11 dyne/cm² * 0.1 N/(dyne/cm²) → Y = 19e11 * 0.1 = 1.9e12 N/m². Oh wait, 19e11 * 0.1 is 1.9e11? Wait, 19e11 is 1.9e12. Oh wait no, 19e11 is 19 * 1e11 = 1.9e12 when considering that 19e11 is 1.9e12. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, 19e11 is 19 * 10^11, which is 1.9 * 10^12. Oh because 19 is 1.9 * 10^1. So 19e11 = 1.9e12. So when I multiply by 0.1 (which is 1e-1), it becomes 1.9e12 * 1e-1 = 1.9e11 N/m². Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no—wait, when converting from dynes/cm² to N/m², 1 dyne/cm² is 0.1 N/m² as I thought earlier.

So Y = 19e11 dyn/cm² * 0.1 N/(m² per dyn/cm² unit) → Y = 19e11 * 0.1 = 1.9e11 N/m². Oh wait, 19e11 * 0.1 is 1.9e11.

Wait, 19e11 is 1.9e12. So 1.9e12 * 1e-1 is 1.9e11. Yes, that's correct.

Next, the area A is 1 square millimeter. 1 mm² is (1e-3 m)^2 = 1e-6 m².

The length L is 5 meters.

So now, the effective spring constant k is (Y * A) / L.

Plugging in the numbers:

Y = 1.9e11 N/m²

A = 1e-6 m²

L =5 m

So k = (1.9e11 * 1e-6) /5 = (1.9e5) /5 = 3.8e4 N/m.

Wait, 1.9e11 * 1e-6 = 1.9e5. Then divided by 5 gives 38000 N/m, which is 3.8e4 N/m. So k is 3.8e4 N/m.

Now, the mass m is 10 kg.

The formula for the frequency is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m).

So let's compute sqrt(k/m): sqrt(3.8e4 /10) = sqrt(3800) ≈ ?

Wait, 3800 is 3.8e3. So the square root of 3.8e3 is approximately... Let's think. 60^2 is 3600, 62^2 is 3844. So sqrt(3800) is roughly 61.64.

So sqrt(3.8e4 /10) = sqrt(3.8e3) ≈ 61.64 rad/s.

Then, f = 1/(2π) * 61.64 ≈ (1/6.2832) * 61.64 ≈ approx 9.8 Hz.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option J:10 vib/s. But wait, let me double-check my calculations, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the units somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the Y calculation.

Y is given as 19e11 dynes/cm².

1 dyne/cm² = 0.1 N/m², right?

So Y = 19e11 * 0.1 = 1.9e11 N/m².

Yes, that's correct.

Then, A is 1 mm² = 1e-6 m².

L is 5 meters.

So k = (1.9e11 * 1e-6) /5.

1.9e11 *1e-6 is 1.9e5.

1.9e5 /5 is 3.8e4 N/m.

So k is 38000 N/m.

Mass m is 10 kg.

So angular frequency ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(38000/10) = sqrt(3800) ≈61.64 rad/s.

Then f = ω/(2π) ≈ 61.64/(6.283) ≈ approx 9.81 Hz.

So about 9.8 Hz, which would be closest to option J:10 Hz.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option J is 10, which is the closest. But perhaps my approximation of the square root is a bit off. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(3800):

61^2 = 3721, 62^2=3844.

3800 is between 61^2 and 62^2.

Compute 61.64^2: 61 *61 is 3721, 0.64^2 is 0.4096, and cross terms (2*61*0.64)= 2*61*.64= 78.08.

So 61.64^2 = (61 +0.64)^2 = 61² + 2*61*0.64 + 0.64² = 3721 + 78.08 + 0.4096 ≈ 3800.4896.

Which is very close to 3800. So sqrt(3800) is approximately 61.64.

So f = 61.64 / (2π) = 61.64 /6.28319 ≈ 9.81 Hz.

So about 9.8 Hz. So the closest option is J:10 Hz.

But wait, looking at the options, J is 10 vib/s, which matches.

But wait, let me think again. Did I miss any conversion steps?

Wait, the wire's cross-sectional area is 1 square millimeter. Oh, did I convert that correctly to m²? Yes, 1 mm² is 1e-6 m².

Wait another thing: when the mass is 10 kg, when the table is removed, the wire will stretch due to the weight. But in SHM, the equilibrium position is where the force from the wire equals mg. But for the frequency, the formula f=1/(2π) sqrt(k/m) still holds, because k is the effective spring constant. So I think that part is correct.

Hmm, but another thought: in the initial setup, the wire is 5m long. When the table is removed, the mass causes an extension ΔL. The frequency doesn't depend on ΔL, it only depends on k and m. So the approach with the effective k is correct. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 10 Hz as option J. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:2, B:20, C:18, D:5, E:30, F:8, G:12, H:25, I:15, J:10.

Yes, option J is 10. So the answer should be J.

To calculate the frequency of oscillation, we treat the steel wire as an effective spring. The formula for the angular frequency \( \omega \) of a mass-spring system is:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

where \( k \) is the effective spring constant of the wire and \( m \) is the mass. The frequency \( f \) is then given by:

\[
f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the effective spring constant \( k \)
The effective spring constant for the wire can be derived using Young's Modulus \( Y \), the cross-sectional area \( A \), and the length \( L \) of the wire:

\[
k = \frac{Y \cdot A}{L}
\]

Given:
- \( Y = 19 \times 10^{11} \, \text{dynes/cm}^2 = 1.9 \times 10^{11} \, \text{N/m}^2 \) (after converting dynes to Newtons and cm to meters),
- \( A = 1 \, \text{mm}^2 = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \),
- \( L = 5 \, \text{m} \),

we calculate:

\[
k = \frac{(1.9 \times 10^{11}) \cdot (1 \times 10^{-6})}{5} = \frac{1.9 \times 10^5}{5} = 3.8 \times 10^4 \, \text{N/m}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the angular frequency \( \omega \)
Using \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( m = 10 \, \text{kg} \):

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{3.8 \times 10^4}{10}} = \sqrt{3.8 \times 10^3} \approx 61.64 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the frequency \( f \)
The frequency is:

\[
f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{61.64}{2\pi} \approx \frac{61.64}{6.283} \approx 9.81 \, \text{Hz}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated frequency \( f \approx 9.81 \, \text{Hz} \) is closest to option \( J: 10 \, \text{vib/s} \).

### Final Answer:
J
