Okay, so I've got this question here about ectomesenchyme and which structure it's derived from. Hmm, I remember that mesenchyme is a type of connective tissue, right? And it's divided into different types based on their origin.

Wait, ectomesenchyme must be a specific kind. I think mesenchyme can be from mesoderm, but ectomesenchyme is probably from ectoderm. Oh right, because 'ecto' refers to ectoderm. So ectomesenchyme is mesenchyme that originates from the ectoderm layer.

Now, what structures come from ectomesenchyme? Let me think. I know that most connective tissues like bone, cartilage, and blood vessels come from mesoderm, specifically mesenchyme. But ectomesenchyme is different. 

Ectomesenchyme is involved in the formation of certain tissues, especially in the head and neck area. Oh, right! It contributes to structures like the adrenal medulla, the cornea of the eye, and also some parts of the face and skull. But I'm not sure about the options here.

Looking at the options provided: A is cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle is from mesoderm, specifically the heart develops from splanchnic mesoderm. So A is probably not the answer.

B: Liver cells. Liver is from endoderm, so B isn't it.

C: Blood vessels. Blood vessels are usually from mesoderm, but wait, some might come from other sources. I'm not sure here. Maybe not, because I think blood vessels in general are mesodermal.

D: Adipose tissue. That's connective tissue, from mesoderm.

E: Melanocytes. These are pigment cells. Melanocytes originate from the neural crest, which is ectodermal in origin. Oh wait, neural crest cells are a type of ectomesenchyme. So melanocytes are derived from ectomesenchyme.

F: Pancreatic cells. Those are from endoderm.

G: Skeletal muscles. From mesoderm, specifically somites.

H: Motor neurons. They come from the neural tube, which is ectoderm, but motor neurons are more from the endoderm? Wait no, neural tube is ectoderm. But motor neurons are from the neural ectoderm, not ectomesenchyme. Because motor neurons are part of the nervous system, which is from neuroectoderm, not mesenchyme.

So, the correct answer should be E, melanocytes. Because melanocytes come from neural crest cells, which are ectomesenchyme.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let me make sure. Another thought: do any other options involve ectomesenchyme?

Oh, another possibility: are there any other structures? For example, the teeth's dentin and enamel. Enamel from ectoderm, dentin from ectomesenchyme (neural crest). But none of the options relate to teeth.

So among the options, E is the one from ectomesenchyme.

Ectomesenchyme is a type of mesenchyme derived from the ectoderm, specifically from neural crest cells. It plays a role in the development of certain structures, particularly in the head and neck region. Among the given options:

- **A: Cardiac muscle** originates from mesoderm, specifically splanchnic mesoderm, so this is not correct.  
- **B: Liver cells** are derived from endoderm, not ectomesenchyme.  
- **C: Blood vessels** are generally formed from mesoderm, so this is also incorrect.  
- **D: Adipose tissue** is a type of connective tissue derived from mesoderm.  
- **E: Melanocytes** are pigment cells that originate from neural crest cells, which are a type of ectomesenchyme. This makes **E** the correct answer.  
- **F: Pancreatic cells** are derived from endoderm.  
- **G: Skeletal muscles** originate from mesoderm, specifically somites.  
- **H: Motor neurons** are derived from neuroectoderm, not ectomesenchyme.  

Thus, the structure derived from ectomesenchyme is **melanocytes**.  

Answer: E
