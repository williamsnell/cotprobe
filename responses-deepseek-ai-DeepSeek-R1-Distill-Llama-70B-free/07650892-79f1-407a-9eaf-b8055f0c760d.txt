Okay, so I've got this question about Van den Haag and his views on the death penalty. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Van den Haag thinks we can't know about a murderer who gets the death penalty. The options are A through J, each with different possibilities.

I remember that Van den Haag was a defender of capital punishment. He argued that even if we can't know for certain whether it deters others, it's still just because it's what the criminal deserves. But wait, the question is about what we can't know, not what he believes about punishment.

Another point I recall is that he discussed the idea of whether a murderer might be rehabilitated. He argued that even if a murderer could change, the punishment should still be based on the crime, not the possibility of rehabilitation. But does that mean he thinks we can't know if they can be rehabilitated? Or is it more about whether the punishment is just regardless of that?

Looking at the options, option J says "is capable of rehabilitation." So if Van den Haag thinks that even if we don't know if the murderer can be rehabilitated, the punishment is still justified, then the answer would be J. Because he argues that the possibility of rehabilitation doesn't affect the justice of the punishment. So whether they can be rehabilitated is something we can't know for sure, but it's not necessary for determining the punishment's justness.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is stating that Van den Haag thinks we can't know whether the murderer... So the answer is the thing we can't know. So from his perspective, he might be saying that we can't know if the murderer is capable of rehabilitation, which is why it doesn't factor into the punishment decision.

Alternatively, I think he also talks about the idea that even if a person could be rehabilitated, they still deserve the punishment for their crime. So the key point is that rehabilitation possibility is uncertain, and therefore, it's not a factor in whether the death penalty is applied.

So putting it together, the correct answer is J: is capable of rehabilitation.

Van den Haag argues that the justice of the death penalty does not depend on whether a murderer can be rehabilitated, as this is uncertain and irrelevant to the punishment's justness. Therefore, the answer is:

J

The answer is J.
