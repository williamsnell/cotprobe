Alright, so I've got this question about Watson and Noble's five-step model for circular evaluation. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, the question is asking at which step the pre-testing of strategy and tactics should be carried out. The options are A through J, with some being steps 1 to 5, and others being phrases like "after the third step" or "the beginning."

First, I need to remember what the five-step model entails. I recall that evaluation models often include steps like defining objectives, planning, implementing, assessing, and reviewing. But I'm not exactly sure how Watson and Noble structured theirs.

Wait, circular evaluation. That might mean it's a cyclical process, so maybe the steps loop around. But the model has five steps, so each step must be distinct.

I think the steps probably go something like: 1. Define objectives, 2. Develop strategies, 3. Implement, 4. Monitor, and 5. Evaluate or something like that. Or maybe it's more about the evaluation process itself.

If I consider a typical evaluation process, pre-testing strategies and tactics would make sense before full implementation. So when would that happen? Maybe after the planning phase, but before actual execution.

Wait, maybe the steps are: (1) Define objectives, (2) Plan the evaluation, (3) Develop strategies and tactics, (4) Pre-test them, (5) Implement and evaluate. But I'm not sure if that's how Watson and Noble structured it.

Alternatively, perhaps the pre-testing is part of the planning phase. So step 2 could be where you plan and pre-test.

Wait, another angle: the question says the model is for circular evaluation, so perhaps it's a cycle that includes planning, acting, evaluating, etc. So maybe the steps are:

1. Define the evaluation focus and objectives.
2. Develop the evaluation strategy and tactics.
3. Implement the strategy.
4. Monitor and collect data.
5. Analyze, report, and take action.

If that's the case, when does pre-testing happen? Pre-testing would logically occur after developing the strategy and tactics but before full implementation. So that would be between step 2 and 3. But the steps are sequential, so perhaps step 3 includes pre-testing as part of implementation.

Alternatively, maybe the pre-testing is part of the second step when you're developing strategies. Like, after developing, you test them on a small scale before moving forward.

Wait, but the question is about the step in the model where pre-testing should be carried out. So if the model has five steps, and each step is a phase, then pre-testing would fit into one of these.

If step 2 is developing strategies, then pre-testing would be part of step 2. Alternatively, maybe it's a separate step before implementation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline what each step might entail.

Step 1: Define objectives. Determining what you want to evaluate.

Step 2: Develop strategy and tactics. Planning how you'll evaluate, including methods and tools.

Step 3: Pre-test the strategy and tactics. Testing the approach before full rollout.

Step 4: Implement the evaluation. Carrying out the evaluation as planned.

Step 5: Analyze and report findings. Drawing conclusions and sharing results.

If that's the case, then pre-testing is step 3. So the answer would be H:3.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's how Watson and Noble's model is structured. Maybe the steps are different.

Another approach: some evaluation models include pre-testing as part of the planning phase, which would be step 2. So in that case, pre-testing occurs in step 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are: 1. Engage stakeholders, 2. Describe the program, 3. Focus the evaluation, 4. Develop a logic model, 5. Plan the evaluation. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit the question.

Wait, I think I remember that in some models, pre-testing is done after the strategy is developed but before full-scale implementation. So that would be step 3.

Alternatively, maybe the model groups steps differently. Maybe the steps are:

1. Define purpose and scope.

2. Develop evaluation design.

3. Implement the evaluation.

4. Analyze data.

5. Report and use findings.

In that case, pre-testing would be part of step 2, the design phase.

Wait, but the question is about when to pre-test the strategy and tactics. So that would be before they're used, which would be after they're developed but before implementation.

So if step 2 is developing strategy, then step 3 would be pre-testing. Or maybe step 2 includes pre-testing.

Alternatively, perhaps the five steps are:

1. Define objectives

2. Plan strategy and tactics

3. Pre-test

4. Implement

5. Evaluate

In that case, pre-test is step 3, so the answer is H:3.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: sometimes, models include pre-testing as part of the planning phase, so it might be part of step 2.

Wait, the options are given as letters, with each option being a possible answer. Looking at the options:

Option B is 2, which would mean step 2. Option H is 3.

So without precise recall, I'm trying to deduce.

If pre-testing is done after developing the strategy (step 2) but before implementation, then it's step 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the model doesn't explicitly include pre-testing as a separate step, but it's part of step 2.

Wait, looking back, the question says "Watson and Noble (2005) lay out a five-step model for circular evaluation." So perhaps their model includes specific steps where pre-testing is an explicit part.

I think that in their model, the steps are:

1. Define the purpose and scope.

2. Develop the evaluation strategy and plan.

3. Implement the plan, which includes pre-testing.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is the actual data collection, so pre-testing would be in step 2.

Another way to approach this is to think about the process. You define your objectives first, then plan your strategy, then test it, then implement, then evaluate.

So step 1: define.

Step 2: plan.

Step 3: pre-test.

Step 4: implement.

Step 5: evaluate.

So pre-testing would be step 3, so the answer is H.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pre-testing is part of step 2, making the answer B:2.

Wait, I think I've heard that in some evaluation models, pre-testing is part of the design phase, which would be step 2. So that would make the answer B.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to think of it logically. If you're developing a strategy, you'd first plan it (step 2), then pre-test it (maybe as part of step 2 or as step 3). If the model includes pre-testing as a separate step, it's step 3. If it's part of the strategy development, then step 2.

Since the options include step 2 (B) and step 3 (H), I need to decide which is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's steps are:

1. Define objectives.

2. Develop strategy.

3. Pre-test strategy.

4. Implement.

5. Evaluate.

In that case, pre-test is step 3, so answer H.

Alternatively, if the model doesn't include pre-testing as a separate step, the answer would be D: The pre-testing step is not included in the model.

But the question is about where it should be carried out, implying that it is part of the model.

Another thought: Circular evaluation might involve iterative steps, so perhaps pre-testing occurs in step 5, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are: 1. Planning, 2. Implementation, 3. Monitoring, 4. Evaluation, 5. Reporting. Then pre-testing would be in step 1.

But that's more of a project management approach.

I think the most plausible answer is that pre-testing occurs at step 2 or 3. Given that, I'm going to go with step 2 being the development of strategy, and pre-testing being part of that step. So the answer is B:2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way to think: in program evaluation, pre-testing often happens after you've designed your data collection tools but before full implementation. So that would be after the strategy is developed, which would be step 3.

Wait, maybe the model's steps are:

1. Define objectives.

2. Develop strategy and tactics.

3. Pre-test.

So, step 3 is pre-testing.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Given that, I'll make an educated guess that pre-testing is step 2, as part of developing the strategy. So answer B:2.

The question asks at which step pre-testing of strategy and tactics should be carried out in Watson and Noble's five-step model for circular evaluation. To answer this, it is important to consider the typical structure of evaluation models and the logical sequence of steps involved in the process.

1. **Understanding the Model**: Watson and Noble's model is described as a five-step process, likely involving stages such as defining objectives, developing strategies, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating. The exact steps are not explicitly provided, but they can be inferred based on common evaluation frameworks.

2. **Logical Sequence**: Pre-testing of strategies and tactics would logically occur after the strategies have been developed but before they are fully implemented. This suggests that pre-testing would follow the development phase and precede implementation.

3. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option B (Step 2)**: If Step 2 involves developing the strategy and tactics, pre-testing could be part of this step as a way to refine the approach before moving forward.
   - **Option H (Step 3)**: If Step 3 is dedicated to pre-testing, this would place it after the development phase and before implementation, which aligns well with the logical sequence.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the typical structure of evaluation models and the logical flow of the process, pre-testing is most likely to occur in Step 3, as it follows the development of strategies and tactics and precedes their implementation.
