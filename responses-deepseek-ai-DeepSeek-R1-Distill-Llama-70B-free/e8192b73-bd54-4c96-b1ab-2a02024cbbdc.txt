Question:

A landlord owned a large building in the city. On January iS, the landlord leased the building to atenant for a period of 20 years at a rental of $10,000 per month. The leasehold agreement between the landlord and tenant provided that the latter was not permitted "to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. " On February 1 of the following year, the tenant leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The tenant corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the tenant. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide "by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the landlord and the tenant. "One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a health club for the balance of the term of the corporation tenant lease. The health club owner took possession of the said premises on February 1, the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation health club leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The health club has a B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. For one year, the health club paid $17,500, each month directly to the corporation. During that same period, the corporation continued to pay $15,000 each month to the tenant, while the latter paid $10,000 (each month) to the landlord. The landlord knew about the leases to the corporation and the health club and protested promptly, but took no further action, apparently satisfied as long as he received his $10,000 per month from the tenant. Thereafter, the health club abandoned the premises and stopped paying rent to the corporation. After the health club discontinued paying rent, the corporation stopped paying rent to the tenant. When the tenant failed to receive his rent, he, too, stopped paying rent to the landlord. If the landlord brings suit to recover for past rent due, which of the following is most accurate?

Options:

A: The landlord may only recover against the health club for past rent due.
B: The landlord may recover against the health club for past rent due.
C: The landlord may recover against the tenant and the health club, jointly and severally, for past rent due.
D: The landlord may recover against the health club and the corporation, but not the tenant, for past rent due.
E: The landlord may only recover against the corporation for past rent due.
F: The landlord may recover against the tenant and the corporation, jointly and severally, for past rent due.
G: The landlord may recover against the corporation for past rent due.
H: The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.
I: The landlord cannot recover against anyone for past rent due.
J: The landlord may recover against the corporation and the health club, jointly and severally,for past rent due.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about landlord-tenant law, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about lease agreements and who's liable for past rent when things go wrong.

So, the setup is that a landlord leased a building to a tenant for 20 years at $10,000 per month. The lease agreement says the tenant can't assign the lease to anyone except a corporation with an 'A' credit rating. Then, the tenant leased it to a corporation without the required rating. That corporation then subleased to a health club with a 'B' rating. 

Now, the health club stops paying rent, which causes the corporation to stop paying the tenant, who in turn stops paying the landlord. The landlord is suing to recover past rent. The question is, who is liable?

First, I need to understand the chain of leases here. The original lease is between the landlord and the tenant (let's call them L-T). Then the tenant subleases to a corporation (T-C). The corporation then subleases to a health club (C-H).

In property law, when a tenant assigns or subleases the property, the original tenant remains liable unless there's a novation. A novation would require the landlord's consent, where the new tenant (assignee) takes on the lease, and the original tenant is released. But in this case, the lease only allows assignment to an 'A' rated corporation, and the tenant assigned it to a corporation that doesn't meet that criteria. So the assignment was not permitted, which might make it a breach of the lease.

Wait, but the question says the tenant leased to a corporation without the required rating. So, that's a violation of the lease terms. But the landlord knew about this and protested but didn't take action, as long as he was getting his $10k. So, does that mean the landlord accepted the situation, maybe implicitly consenting to the assignment?

Hmm, but the lease terms require that any assignee must have an 'A' rating. If the tenant assigns to someone without that, it's a breach. But the landlord's knowledge and inaction might affect this. Wait, but the landlord protested, so he didn't consent. So the assignment might be in violation, but the landlord didn't terminate the lease. So the tenant is still liable, because the assignment was improper.

Now, when the tenant assigns to the corporation, that's likely a sublease, not an assignment, because the tenant's lease isn't being transferred entirely; the corporation is just taking over for a portion (5 years out of 20). So the tenant remains liable on the original lease. The corporation becomes the subtenant.

Then, the corporation subleases to the health club for the balance of their term (which would be 4 years, since the corporation's lease was 5 years and they've been in for a year). The health club has a 'B' rating, which probably isn't allowed under the original lease's conditions, but the corporation's lease with the tenant didn't specify any such restrictions, or maybe it did. Wait, the lease between tenant and corporation says the corporation must abide by all terms of the landlord-tenant lease. So maybe any sub-sublease must also comply with the original terms.

Wait, the T-C lease says that the corporation must abide by all terms of L-T lease. So does that mean that when the corporation subleases to the health club, it must ensure that the health club meets the same conditions as the original lease? Or maybe not, because the health club is a sub-subtenant, not an assignee. 

But regardless, the main issue is the chain of liability. The original tenant is on the hook because any assignment or sublease doesn't release them unless there's a novation. Since the assignment to the corporation was without the landlord's consent and in violation of the lease terms, the tenant is still liable.

The corporation, as a subtenant, is liable to the tenant for the rent under their sublease. The health club is liable to the corporation for their sublease. But the question is about the landlord's ability to recover past rent.

Wait, the landlord's lease is with the tenant. The tenant is leasing to the corporation, then the corporation to the health club. The landlord isn't a party to those subleases. So the only direct obligation is between L-T. Then, when the health club stops paying, the corporation stops paying the tenant, who then stops paying the landlord.

So the landlord can sue the tenant for breaching the lease because the tenant isn't paying. But can the landlord also go after the corporation or the health club?

In general, the landlord can only seek remedies against the tenant because that's the only lease they have. The subleases are between the tenant and others, so the landlord isn't a party to them. Unless the landlord has some other rights, like if the subtenants have attorned to the landlord, but I don't think so here.

Wait, but the T-C lease says that the corporation must abide by all terms of the L-T lease. Does that make the corporation bound to the landlord? I don't think so. Because the corporation's lease is with the tenant, not the landlord. So the corporation's obligations are to the tenant, not the landlord.

Unless the landlord has a right to enforce the terms of the sublease, but generally, a landlord can't sue a subtenant unless the lease agreement allows it. Here, the original lease didn't say that, so probably not.

So when the tenant stops paying, the landlord can sue the tenant. But the tenant might have a claim against the corporation, and the corporation against the health club, but that's separate from the landlord's rights.

Wait, but the question is about who the landlord can sue. The options are about whether the landlord can recover from the health club, the corporation, the tenant, etc.

Option H says the landlord may only recover against the tenant. That seems likely because the landlord's lease is with the tenant, and the tenant is liable regardless of who they subleased to.

But wait, some jurisdictions allow the landlord to hold subtenants liable if they've taken over the premises, but I'm not sure about that. Or perhaps when the tenant assigns without permission, the assignee becomes liable as well.

Wait, but in this case, the assignment was prohibited, so it's an invalid assignment. So the tenant remains liable, and the corporation is just a subtenant. So the landlord can only go after the tenant.

But another thought: in some cases, if a tenant subleases in violation of the lease, the subtenant may be considered a tenant at sufferance, and the landlord can evict them but not necessarily collect rent from them. Alternatively, the subtenant may be liable for use and occupancy, but that's a different matter.

Alternatively, if the landlord has privity of estate with the subtenant, perhaps they can sue them for rent. But privity of estate comes from a lease agreement, which the landlord doesn't have with the subtenant.

So, putting it all together: the landlord's only direct contract is with the tenant. The tenant is in breach by not paying rent. So the landlord can sue the tenant for past rent due.

Looking at the options:

H: The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.

Another option is F: recover against tenant and corporation, jointly and severally. But I don't think the corporation is liable to the landlord. The corporation's liability is to the tenant, not the landlord. Unless the corporation has somehow become a co-tenant or assignee, but in this case, it's a sublease.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The landlord's lease agreement is with the tenant, and the tenant remains liable for the rent regardless of any subleases. The tenant's assignment to the corporation was in violation of the lease terms, as the corporation did not have the required 'A' credit rating. This breach does not release the tenant from liability. The corporation, as a subtenant, is liable to the tenant under the sublease, and the health club, as a sub-subtenant, is liable to the corporation. However, the landlord's only direct contractual relationship is with the tenant, and the landlord cannot pursue the corporation or the health club directly for past rent unless explicitly allowed by law or the lease terms, which is not the case here.

Given this, the landlord may only recover against the tenant for past rent due.
