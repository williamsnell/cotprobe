Okay, so I have this problem about a DC shunt motor and I need to find the speed at half load and at 125% overload. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on motor calculations, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in a DC shunt motor, the flux is constant because the field current is constant. But wait, is that always true? Oh right, if the field current changes, the flux changes. But in this case, the field resistance is 60 ohms and the supply voltage is 120 V. So the field current should be I_f = V / R_f. Let me calculate that: 120 V divided by 60 ohms is 2 A. So I_f is 2 A.

The motor is drawing a line current of 40 A at full load. For a shunt motor, the line current is the sum of the armature current (I_a) and the field current (I_f). Wait, wait, no—wait, the field current is separate. So I_line = I_a + I_f. Wait no, no, in a shunt motor, the field is across the same lines. So the line current is I_a + I_f. So if I_f is 2 A, then I_a at full load is 40 A - 2 A = 38 A. Wait, no, wait: wait, the line current is I_a plus I_f? Or is it I_f plus I_a? Yes, because the field is in parallel with the armature. So the total current drawn is armature current plus field current. So yes, I_a = 40 A - 2 A = 38 A.

Now, the armature circuit resistance is 0.2 ohms. So the armature voltage drop is I_a * R_a. At full load, that's 38 A * 0.2 ohm = 7.6 volts. So the induced voltage E_b is V - I_a R_a. Wait no, wait: E_b = V - (I_a * R_a). Because the armature resistance causes a voltage drop. So E_b = 120 V - 7.6 V = 112.4 V.

But wait, the brush voltage drop is 3 V. Oh right, the brush drop is a separate loss. So the actual induced voltage E is E_b minus brush drop. So E = 112.4 V - 3 V = 109.4 V?

Wait, no, I might be getting that wrong. Let me clarify. The total voltage across the armature is E_b, which is the sum of the back EMF and the armature resistance drop and brush drop. Or is it that the back EMF is equal to the supply voltage minus the drops? Hmm.

Wait, the correct formula is E_b = V - I_a R_a - brush drop. Or is it E_b = V - (I_a R_a + brush drop)? I think it's E_b = V - (I_a R_a) - brush drop. Because the armature resistance and brush drop are voltage drops in the armature circuit.

Wait, no. Let me get the formula straight. For a DC motor:

E_b = V - I_a R_a - brush drop.

So in this case, E_b = 120 V - (38 A * 0.2 Ω) - 3 V.

Calculating that: 38 * 0.2 =7.6, so E_b = 120 -7.6 -3 = 109.4 V. So E_b is 109.4 V.

Now, the speed of a DC motor is given by N = (E_b * 60) / (2π φ Z / A), but I think it's more commonly written as N = (E_b * 60) / (Z φ (P / A)), but perhaps using the formula N = (E_b * 60 * A) / (Z φ P), where A is the number of parallel paths, Z is the number of armature conductors, P the number of poles. Alternatively, I might be mixing some variables here. Alternatively, speed is proportional to E_b divided by flux, because N is proportional to E_b / φ, since E_b = (φ Z N P)/(60 A). So N = (60 A E_b) / (φ Z P).

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the relationship between speed and armature current. Wait, for a shunt motor, the flux is approximately constant if the field current is constant. So E_b is proportional to speed. So if E_b increases, speed increases, and vice versa.

At full load, the speed is 1800 rpm. So E_b is 109.4 V when N is 1800 rpm.

Now, the problem is to find the speed at half load and at 125% overload.

First, let's find the armature current at half load. Wait, the load torque is proportional to the armature current. Because torque T = (I_a * φ Z P )/(2π A). So torque is proportional to I_a. So if it's half load, the torque is half, so I_a is half of the full load current.

At full load, I_a is 38 A. So half load would be 19 A. But wait, no, because the field current remains the same. So I_line at half load would be I_a (19 A) + I_f (2 A) = 21 A. Hmm, but the question is about the speed when the load is half, so the torque is half.

Now, when the load changes, the armature current changes, which affects E_b because E_b = V - I_a R_a - brush drop. So E_b changes with I_a, which affects the speed.

So at half load, I_a is 19 A. So E_b = 120 V - (19 A * 0.2 Ω) - 3 V.

Calculating: 19 * 0.2 = 3.8 V. So E_b = 120 - 3.8 -3 = 113.2 V.

Since speed is proportional to E_b (because flux is constant in shunt motor), the new speed N1 = (E_b1 / E_b_full) * N_full.

E_b1 is 113.2 V, E_b_full is 109.4 V. So N1 = (113.2 / 109.4) * 1800.

Let me compute that ratio: 113.2 / 109.4 ≈ 1.0353. So 1.0353 * 1800 ≈ 1863 rpm. Hmm, that's around 1863 rpm.

Looking at the options, let's see which have a half-load speed of approximately 1860 or close. Let me look at the options:

Option A: Half-load 1870, 1.25 load 1790.

Option C: Half 1900, 1.25 1850.

Option G: Half 1860, 1.25 1765.

Wait, 1863 is close to 1860, so Option G's half-load is 1860. That would be a possible match.

Now, let's check the second part: speed at 125% overload. That is, 125% of full load torque, so I_a would be 1.25 times the full load I_a.

Full load I_a is 38 A, so 1.25 * 38 = 47.5 A. So I_a is 47.5 A.

Then, E_b is V - I_a R_a - brush drop.

E_b = 120 - (47.5 * 0.2) - 3.

47.5 * 0.2 = 9.5. So E_b = 120 -9.5 -3 = 107.5 V.

Again, speed is proportional to E_b. So N2 = (107.5 / 109.4) * 1800.

Compute 107.5 / 109.4: approximately 0.983. So 0.983 *1800 ≈ 1770 rpm.

Looking at the options, let's see what each option gives for 1.25 load.

Option G's second value is 1765, which is close to 1770. So that would match.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me re-calculate the values because I might have made a mistake.

At full load:

E_b_full = 120 - 38*0.2 - 3 =120 -7.6 -3=109.4 V.

Half load I_a is 19 A.

E_b_half = 120 -19*.2 -3=120-3.8-3=113.2 V.

Speed ratio: 113.2/109.4 = approx 1.0353. So N=1.0353 *1800= 1863 rpm.

Option G says half load is 1860 which matches approximately.

At 125% load, I_a=38 *1.25=47.5 A.

E_b =120 -47.5*0.2 -3= 120 -9.5 -3=107.5 V.

Speed ratio:107.5/109.4≈0.983. So 1800 *0.983≈1770 rpm.

Option G's second value is 1765, which is a bit lower. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 113.2 / 109.4:

113.2 ÷ 109.4.

109.4 * 1.035 is 109.4 + (109.4 *0.035).

109.4 *0.035= approx 3.829, so 109.4 +3.829≈113.229. So 113.2 is exactly 1.035 times 109.4, so N=1800 * 1.035= 1863 rpm, which is 1863. So option G says 1860, which is 3 rpm less. Hmm, maybe I should consider more accurate calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact calculations instead of approximate.

E_b_half = 120 - (19 * 0.2) -3 = 120 - 3.8 -3=113.2 V.

E_b_full =109.4 V.

So the ratio is 113.2 /109.4 = Let me compute that exactly.

113.2 ÷ 109.4 ≈ 1.0353.

So N=1800 *1.0353≈ 1863 rpm.

So the closest option is G, which has 1860 rpm. The difference is 3 rpm, which might be due to rounding.

Now, for the 125% load:

I_a=47.5 A.

E_b =120 - (47.5 *0.2) -3=120 -9.5 -3=107.5 V.

107.5/109.4 = 0.9828.

So N=1800 *0.9828≈1770.24 rpm. So approximately 1770 rpm.

Option G's second value is 1765 rpm, which is 5 rpm less. Hmm, but considering possible rounding, it's the closest.

Wait, but let me check other options to make sure.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: half-load 1870, 1.25 load 1790.

Wait, in my calculation, the 1.25 load speed is lower than full load (1770 vs 1800). But option A shows 1790, which is higher than 1800, which doesn't make sense because at higher current, E_b would be lower, so speed would drop.

Wait, no, wait: At higher load (higher current), E_b decreases. So speed would decrease. So if in option A, the 1.25 load speed is 1790, which is lower than 1800. Wait, no, 1790 is lower than 1800, so that makes sense. Wait no, 1790 is less than 1800. So that can't be, because 125% load would be more current, lower E_b, lower speed.

Wait, but 1790 is lower than 1800, yes. So if E_b at 1.25 load is 107.5 V, which is less than 109.4 V, so speed is lower.

So option A's 1.25 load is 1790, which is 10 rpm lower than 1800, but my calculation gives 1770, which is 30 rpm lower. So option A is not matching.

Option G's 1.25 load is 1765, which is 35 rpm lower, which is closer to my 1770.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the flux is constant. Wait, but in a shunt motor, the flux depends on the field current. Let's check if the field current changes.

Wait, the field is connected across the supply voltage, so if the supply voltage is constant, the field current remains the same. So I_f = V / R_f = 120/60=2 A, which is constant regardless of load. So flux is constant. So speed is proportional to E_b, which is V - I_a R_a - brush drop.

So my approach should be correct.

Wait, but wait, in the full load calculation, E_b is 109.4 V, and when the load decreases, E_b increases, leading to higher speed. So my half load speed is higher than full load, which makes sense, as the motor would run faster when the load is less because E_b is higher.

So in the options, Option G has half load of 1860 (close to my 1863) and 1.25 load of 1765 (close to my 1770). So that's the best fit.

But wait, let me check the other options again.

Option J: half 1840, 1.25 1800. Hmm, 1.25 load can't have higher speed than full load. So J is out.

Option C: half 1900, 1.25 1850. That would mean E_b increased further at 1.25 load, which isn't possible because higher current would lower E_b.

Option B: half 1780, which is lower than full load, which is not correct. Because lower load should have higher speed.

So the only option that fits is G: 1860 and 1765.

Wait, but let me recheck my 125% load calculation.

I_a = 47.5 A.

E_b = 120 - (47.5 *0.2) -3 = 120 -9.5 -3=107.5 V.

So N = (107.5 /109.4) *1800 = (107.5/109.4)=approx 0.9828 *1800= approx 1770 rpm.

But option G says 1765, which is 5 rpm less. Maybe my approximation is a bit off because I'm using approximate division.

Let me compute 107.5 /109.4 more accurately.

109.4 * 0.98 = (109 *0.98) + (0.4 *0.98)= 106.82 + 0.392=107.212.

107.5 is a bit higher than 107.212, so 0.98 plus a little. So 0.98 + (0.288/109.4)≈0.98 +0.0026=0.9826.

0.9826 *1800= 0.9826 *1800= let's compute 1800 *0.9826.

1800 *0.9 =1620, 1800*.08=144, 1800*.0026=4.68.

Adding up: 1620 +144=1764 +4.68=1768.68 ≈1769 rpm.

So about 1769 rpm, which is closer to 1770. So option G's 1765 is 5 rpm off. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in I_a. Let me double-check.

At full load: I_line=40 A.

I_f=2 A, so I_a=38 A.

Yes, correct.

At half load, torque is half, so I_a is half of 38 A, so I_a=19 A.

E_b=120 -19*.2 -3=120-3.8-3=113.2 V.

At 125% load, torque is 1.25 times, so I_a=38*1.25=47.5 A.

E_b=120 -47.5*.2 -3=120-9.5-3=107.5 V.

Yes, correct.

So the speeds are 1863 and 1769.

Looking again at the options, perhaps the closest is option G: 1860 and 1765.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial E_b calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, in the full load case, E_b is 109.4 V. So the base speed is 1800 rpm.

At half load, E_b is 113.2 V, so speed is 113.2/109.4 *1800 ≈1863.

At 125% load, E_b is107.5 V, so speed is107.5 /109.4 *1800 ≈1769.

So looking at the options, let's check all of them.

Option G: (half 1860, 1.25 1765)

That's very close.

Another option is Option A: half 1870, 1.25 1790. But 1790 is higher than my 1769, which is not correct.

Option H: half 1820, 1.25 1740. Hmm, 1740 is lower than our calculated 1769. So perhaps that's not.

Option F: half 1830, 1.25 1775. 1775 is a bit higher than our 1769.

Wait, 1765 is option G's 1.25 load speed.

So which option is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option where the half load is approximately 1860 and the 1.25 load is approximately 1765.

Looking at the options, option G is the only one that matches this.

Wait, but wait another thing: perhaps the armature reaction affects the flux, but in a shunt motor, it's assumed that the flux is approximately constant because the shunt field provides the excitation. So armature reaction is negligible, so flux remains same. So my initial approach holds.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the performance of the DC shunt motor under different load conditions. The key steps are as follows:
