Okay, so I've got this problem here about a vertical plate subjected to a constant heat flux, and I need to find the average surface temperature. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on heat transfer, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the plate is 3.5 meters by 2 meters. The heat flux is 800 W/m². The back is insulated, so all the heat must be going out through the front. The ambient air is at 30°C. Oh wait, and the question says to assume that all the incident radiation is lost by free convection. So radiation isn't a factor here; it's all natural convection.

I remember that for free convection, we use Newton's law of cooling, which is q = h*A*(T_s - T_ambient). But wait, the problem gives the heat flux, which is q" (q per unit area). So the equation would be q" = h*(T_s - T_ambient). So solving for T_s, that's the surface temperature, which is T_s = T_ambient + q"/h.

So the key here is finding the convective heat transfer coefficient, h. But to find h, I probably need to calculate the Grashof number and then use a correlation for natural convection on a vertical plate.

Wait, the Grashof number is Gr = gβ(T_s - T_inf)L^3 / ν². But since T_s is what we're trying to find, that complicates things because Gr depends on T_s. Oh right, so this becomes an iterative process. Because h is dependent on the temperature difference, which we don't know yet.

Hmm, maybe I can make an initial guess for T_s, compute Gr, find h, then check if it's consistent. If not, adjust the guess. Alternatively, maybe I can use some approximate method or assumptions to get around it.

Alternatively, I think there's a way to relate the heat flux directly using the Rayleigh number, which is Ra = Gr * Pr. And for a vertical plate, the average Nusselt number is a function of Ra. The correlation I remember is something like Nu = 0.67 Ra^(1/4) for laminar flow, but I'm not sure if that's the right one. Oh wait, the exact correlation might depend on the Prandtl number and the range of Ra.

Wait, the given data includes properties of air at various temperatures. Since T_s is unknown, I can't directly pick the right row. Hmm. So perhaps I should start with an approximate temperature. Let's see, the ambient is 30°C, and the heat flux is 800 W/m². So the surface must be hotter than ambient. How much hotter?

Well, let's think about free convection coefficients. For air, h for free convection is typically in the range of 5 to 30 W/m²K, depending on the temperature difference and the geometry. Let's say h is around 10 W/m²K. Then the temperature difference would be 800 / 10 = 80 K, so T_s would be 110°C. But wait, looking at the options, that's not one of them. Wait, the options are A:185, B:80, C:104, D:70.

Wait, that's an initial guess, but maybe I'm off. Alternatively, perhaps the h is higher. Let's think again. If the surface is much hotter, then the air properties would be evaluated at a higher temperature. Let me think about the steps.

The process is probably something like this:

1. Assume a surface temperature T_s.
2. Calculate the properties of air at the film temperature, which is (T_s + T_inf)/2.
3. Compute Grashof number Gr = gβ(T_s - T_inf) L^3 / ν².
4. Compute Ra = Gr * Pr.
5. Use the correlation for Nu = f(Ra, Pr), then h = Nu * k / L.
6. Use Newton's law q" = h (T_s - T_inf) to check if the calculated h gives the correct q".
7. Iterate until the assumed T_s matches the calculated one.

But this is a bit involved. Let me see if I can find a way to approach it without too many iterations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the relation for heat transfer in free convection when the heat flux is given. I've heard of the Churchill and Chu correlation for vertical plates, which is:

Nu = 0.68 + 0.67 Ra^(1/4) for Ra ≤ 10^9.

Ra is the Rayleigh number, which is (gβ(T_s - T_inf) L^3) / (ν²) * Pr.

Wait, but again, this requires knowing T_s, which is what we're trying to find.

An alternative approach is to express q" in terms of the temperature difference and the properties, then solve for T_s.

Let me try to write the equations.

Given q" = 800 W/m², which is equal to h*(T_s - 30°C).

So T_s = 30 + (800/h).

But h is determined by the properties of air. Let's see, perhaps express h in terms of the properties and the temperature difference.

Wait, maybe I can write the equation in terms of the Rayleigh number. Let's see.

The Nusselt number is Nu = h L / k, so h = Nu * k / L.

And Nu is a function of Ra and Pr. So substituting h into the heat equation:

q" = (Nu * k / L) * (T_s - T_inf).

But Nu is given by the Churchill-Chu equation: for vertical plates, Nu = 0.67 Ra^(1/4), where Ra = (gβ(T_s - T_inf) L^3 Pr) / ν².

Wait, that's getting complicated, but maybe I can substitute and solve for (T_s - T_inf).

Let me try substituting:

q" = (0.67 * Ra^(1/4) * k / L) * (ΔT), where ΔT is T_s - T_inf.

But Ra is (gβ ΔT L^3 Pr) / ν².

So substituting Ra into the equation:

q" = [0.67 * ( (g β ΔT L^3 Pr) / ν² )^(1/4) * k / L ] * ΔT.

Simplify this expression.

Let me write each term:

0.67 is a constant.

Inside the fourth root: (g β ΔT L^3 Pr) / ν².

Take the fourth root of each term:

(g β ΔT L^3 Pr / ν² )^(1/4) = (g β)^(1/4) * (ΔT)^(1/4) * L^(3/4) * Pr^(1/4) * ν^(-2*(1/4)) = (g β)^(1/4) * ΔT^(1/4) * L^(3/4) * Pr^(1/4) * ν^(-1/2).

So putting it all together:

q" = 0.67 * (g β)^(1/4) * ΔT^(1/4) * L^(3/4) * Pr^(1/4) * ν^(-1/2) * k / L * ΔT.

Wait, the k is divided by L, because h = Nu*k/L.

Wait, let me see: h = Nu * k / L. So in the equation q" = h * ΔT, substituting h:

q" = (Nu * k / L ) * ΔT.

And Nu is 0.67 Ra^(1/4), so:

q" = [0.67 * (g β ΔT L^3 Pr / ν² )^(1/4) * k / L ] * ΔT.

Simplify:

q" = 0.67 * (g β)^(1/4) * (ΔT)^(1/4) * L^(3/4) * Pr^(1/4) * ν^(-1/2) * k / L * ΔT.

Simplify the terms:

L^(3/4) / L = L^(-1/4).

So:

q" = 0.67 * (g β)^(1/4) * (ΔT)^(5/4) * L^(-1/4) * Pr^(1/4) * ν^(-1/2) * k.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to collect all the constants and variables. Alternatively, maybe we can rearrange the equation to solve for ΔT.

Let me write this as:

q" = 0.67 * k * (g β)^(1/4) * Pr^(1/4) * L^(-1/4) * ν^(-1/2) * (ΔT)^(5/4).

So solving for ΔT:

ΔT = [ q" / (0.67 * k * (g β)^(1/4) * Pr^(1/4) * L^(-1/4) * ν^(-1/2) ) ]^(4/5).

Wait, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.

Wait, let's collect all the terms:

Let me write the equation as:

ΔT^(5/4) = q" / [ 0.67 * k * (g β)^(1/4) * Pr^(1/4) * (L^(-1/4)) * ν^(-1/2) ) ]

Wait, actually, maybe I should re-express the equation correctly.

Let me reorganize:

q" = 0.67 * (g β)^(1/4) * (ΔT)^(1/4) * (L^3 Pr / ν²)^(1/4) ) * (k / L) * ΔT.

Wait no, perhaps I should go back. Maybe it's better to use the form:

q" = h * ΔT.

h = (k / L) * Nu.

Nu = 0.67 * (Gr Pr)^(1/4) = 0.67 Ra^(1/4).

But Ra = (g β ΔT L^3) / ν² * Pr.

So Nu = 0.67 [ (g β ΔT L^3 Pr) / ν² ) ]^(1/4).

So h = (k / L) * 0.67 [ (g β ΔT L^3 Pr) / ν² ) ]^(1/4).

Then, rearranging for h:

h = 0.67 k (g β)^(1/4) (Pr)^(1/4) (ΔT)^(1/4) L^(3/4 - 1) ν^(-1/2).

Because (L^3)^(1/4) is L^(3/4), and divided by L gives L^(3/4 - 1) = L^(-1/4).

So h = 0.67 k (g β)^(1/4) (Pr)^(1/4) (ΔT)^(1/4) L^(-1/4) ν^(-1/2).

Then, putting this into q" = h ΔT:

q" = 0.67 k (g β)^(1/4) (Pr)^(1/4) (ΔT)^(5/4) L^(-1/4) ν^(-1/2).

So solving for ΔT:

ΔT = [ q" / (0.67 k (g β)^(1/4) (Pr)^(1/4) L^(-1/4) ν^(-1/2) ) ) ]^(4/5).

Hmm, okay, but I'm getting a bit stuck in the algebra. Maybe I should instead look for the relevant properties and plug in the numbers.

Wait, but I don't know the surface temperature yet, so I can't pick the exact properties. But perhaps I can make an initial guess for the film temperature, then iterate.

Let's see. Let's make an initial guess for T_s. Since the heat flux is 800 W/m², which is quite high for free convection. So the surface must be significantly hotter than ambient.

Let me start by assuming that T_s is around 100°C. So the film temperature is (100 + 30)/2 = 65°C. Looking at the table, 65.6°C is listed as 338.8 K. Let me check what properties are given for 65.6°C (it's the 5th row):

At 65.6°C (338.8 K):

rho = 1.043 kg/m³

Cp = 1.0090 kJ/kg·K

mu ×1e5 = 2.03e-5 Pa·s → mu = 2.03e-5 / 1e5? Wait, no, the header says mu ×1e5 (Pa·s). So mu is 2.03e-5 Pa·s.

k = 0.702 W/m·K

Pr = 2.95.

g is 9.81 m/s², which is constant.

Beta (β) is given as 1e3 * beta = 0.02925 → beta = 0.02925e-3 1/K.

Wait, let me confirm: the column is labeled beta×10^3 (1/K), so to get beta, divide by 1e3. So beta = 0.02925e-3 = 2.925e-5 1/K.

Similarly, the last column is g*beta*rho^2/mu^2, but maybe I don't need that for now.

So, let's compute the variables:

L is the height of the plate, which is 3.5 m.

Compute Grashof number Gr = (g * beta * (T_s - T_inf) * L^3) / (mu^2 / rho^2) → Wait, no. Wait, the Grashof number is Gr = (g β (T_s - T_inf) L^3 ) * rho² / mu². Because Gr = [g β (T_s - T_inf) L^3] * (rho^2 / mu^2). Wait, no, more accurately:

Gr = (g β (T_s - T_inf) L^3 ) / (nu^2 ), and nu = mu / rho.

So, nu = mu / rho → nu^2 = (mu^2)/(rho^2). So Gr becomes:

Gr = [g β (T_s - T_inf) L^3 * rho² ] / mu².

Which can be written as Gr = (g β rho² (T_s - T_inf) L^3 ) / mu².

So, with T_s = 100°C, T_inf =30°C. So ΔT = 70 K.

Compute Gr:

g =9.81 m/s².

beta = 2.925e-5 1/K.

rho =1.043 kg/m³.

mu = 2.03e-5 Pa·s.

L=3.5 m.

Putting it all in:

Gr = (9.81) * (2.925e-5) * (1.043)^2 * (70) * (3.5)^3 / ( (2.03e-5)^2 )

Let me compute each part:

First, compute numerator:

9.81 * 2.925e-5 = let's see, 9.81 * 2.925 = approx 28.7, so 28.7e-5 = 0.000287.

Multiply by (1.043)^2 ≈ 1.088.

0.000287 * 1.088 ≈ 0.0003126.

Multiply by 70: 0.0003126 *70 ≈ 0.02184.

Multiply by (3.5)^3 = 42.875: 0.02184 *42.875 ≈ 0.936.

Denominator: (2.03e-5)^2 = approx 4.12e-10.

So Gr ≈ 0.936 / 4.12e-10 ≈ 2.27e9.

Wait, but let's compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each part step by step.

Compute numerator step by step:

g =9.81.

beta=2.925e-5.

rho=1.043, so rho squared is 1.043^2 = 1.088.

(T_s - T_inf)=70 K.

L=3.5 m → L^3=42.875 m³.

mu=2.03e-5, so mu squared is (2.03e-5)^2 =4.12e-10.

Putting it all together:

Numerator = 9.81 * 2.925e-5 * 1.088 *70 *42.875.

Compute each multiplication step:

9.81 * 2.925e-5 = let's calculate 9.81 * 2.925 = approx 28.7, so 28.7e-5 → 0.000287.

0.000287 * 1.088 ≈ 0.000287 * 1 = 0.000287, 0.000287 * 0.088≈ 0.0000253. So sum≈ 0.0003123.

Multiply by 70: 0.0003123 *70=0.021881.

Multiply by 42.875: 0.021881 *42.875.

0.021881 *40=0.87724, 0.021881 *2.875≈0.06291. Sum≈0.94015.

Denominator: 4.12e-10.

So Gr≈ 0.94015 /4.12e-10 → 0.94015 / 4.12e-10 ≈ 2.28e9.

So Gr≈2.28e9.

Then, Ra = Gr * Pr = 2.28e9 *2.95 ≈ 6.72e9.

Wait, but the Churchill-Chu correlation is for Ra up to 1e9. Oh, so if Ra exceeds 1e9, the correlation might not be valid. Hmm, perhaps I should use a different correlation for higher Ra.

Wait, I think for Ra > 1e9, the Nusselt number correlation changes. Let me recall: for vertical plates, when Ra is between 1e9 and 1e13, the correlation is Nu = 1.0 Ra^(1/3) Pr^(1/15). Or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the Churchill and Chu correlation which is applicable for all Ra.

Wait, the Churchill and Chu correlation for a vertical plate is:

Nu = ( (0.8257 Ra^(1/4) (1 + (0.4925/Pr)^(1/2
