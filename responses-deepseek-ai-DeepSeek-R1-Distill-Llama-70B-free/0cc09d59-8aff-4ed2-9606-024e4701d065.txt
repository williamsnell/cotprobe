Okay, so I've got this question about reducing hostility between groups of junior high students. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what's the best approach to decrease this hostility. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A suggests individual counseling sessions. That might help with individual issues, but if the problem is between groups, maybe it's not the most effective. It doesn't directly address the intergroup dynamics.

Option B talks about assigning goals that require cooperation. Oh wait, that rings a bell. I think this is related to the concept of cooperative learning or something like that. When groups have to work together towards a common goal, it can reduce conflicts because they have to rely on each other. This might build mutual respect and understanding.

Option C is about a community speaker. While having someone respected talk can inspire, it might not have a lasting impact. It's more of a one-off thing and doesn't actively involve the students in changing their behavior.

Option D uses educational materials. Teaching about the negatives of hostility is good, but similar to C, it's passive. The students might understand intellectually but not change their behavior unless they have a reason to.

Option E suggests group representatives discussing ways to reduce hostility. That could help, but it might not involve all members and could lead to more division if not handled properly. Plus, it's a bit indirect.

Option F is a reward system for low hostility. Rewards can motivate, but they might not address the root causes. Plus, if the rewards are the main focus, it might not lead to genuine change once the rewards stop.

Option G proposes competitive games between groups. Wait, competition can actually increase hostility, not decrease it. If they're competing, it might make the groups more adversarial, which is the opposite of what we want.

Option H is about increasing contact under pleasant conditions. Oh, right! The contact hypothesis in psychology says that positive interactions between different groups can reduce prejudice and hostility. If the students have more chances to interact in a friendly environment, they might see each other in a better light.

Option I says each group should make their own rules. That might actually increase division because each group is focusing on themselves, not interacting with others. It could reinforce their separate identities rather than building unity.

Option J is strict rules and penalties. While consequences might deter some behavior, they don't address the underlying issues. It's a punitive approach that might not lead to genuine change and could even cause resentment.

So now, considering the options, I think B and H are the strongest. B is about cooperative goals, and H is about positive contact. Which one is better?

I remember that the contact hypothesis (H) is a well-supported theory for reducing intergroup conflict. When groups have positive interactions, especially in relaxed, non-competitive settings, they start to see each other more positively. So H seems effective.

On the other hand, cooperative goals (B) also work, but maybe more in structured, task-oriented settings. If the situation is more about general hostility, increasing positive contact might be more broadly effective.

So the best answer is probably H: increase opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions.

To decrease hostility between groups of junior high school students, it's essential to focus on strategies that promote positive interactions and mutual understanding. Among the options provided, **Option H: Increase opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions** stands out as the most effective approach. This is based on the contact hypothesis, a well-supported psychological theory that suggests positive interactions between groups can reduce prejudice and hostility. By fostering a friendly environment where students can engage with one another, they are more likely to develop empathy and break down barriers that contribute to conflict.

Other options, such as cooperative goal-setting (Option B), also have merit but may be more effective in structured, task-oriented settings. In contrast, increasing positive contact (Option H) offers a broader and more flexible approach to reducing general hostility. Therefore, the best choice is:

H
