Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The question is about a ball hanging from a string. Initially, when it's at rest, the tension in the string is mg, which makes sense because tension has to balance the weight. Then, the ball is made to move in a horizontal circle, so the string describes a cone shape. The question is asking about the tension in the string in this new scenario. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, right. When the ball is moving in a horizontal circle, the string is at an angle, right? Because the ball is moving in a circle, so the string must be making a conical shape. That means the string isn't vertical anymore; it's at some angle theta from the vertical.

I remember that when an object moves in a horizontal circle, it experiences a centripetal force directed towards the center of the circle. In this case, the tension in the string provides that centripetal force. But wait, tension also has to support the weight of the ball against gravity. Oh, right! So the vertical component of the tension must balance the weight, and the horizontal component provides the centripetal force.

Let me think about the forces. The tension T can be resolved into two components: the vertical component, which is T*cos(theta), and the horizontal component, which is T*sin(theta). The vertical component has to equal mg because the ball isn't moving up or down, so the net vertical force is zero. So we have T*cos(theta) = mg. 

The horizontal component is providing the centripetal force, which is mv²/r, where m is the mass, v is the speed, and r is the radius of the circle. So T*sin(theta) = mv²/r.

Wait, but how does this affect the tension compared to when it was at rest? When it's at rest, T was mg. Now, in the moving case, I have T*cos(theta) = mg. That means T must be greater than mg because cos(theta) is less than 1 (since theta is some angle above zero). Because, for example, if theta is 0, cos(theta) is 1, and T would be mg. But in this case, theta is not zero, so T must be larger than mg. 

So the tension in the string must be greater than mg. But wait, is that always the case? Let me think again. Suppose the speed increases, the angle theta would increase as well because a higher speed requires a larger horizontal component. But regardless of the speed, as long as it's moving in a circle, there's a horizontal component, so T must be more than mg. 

Looking at the options:

Option B says the tension is mg, which is only true when the ball is at rest. So that's not correct here.

Option D says the tension is greater than mg always. That seems to align with what I was thinking because T*cos(theta) = mg implies T is mg/cos(theta), which is larger than mg as cos(theta) is less than 1.

Option J says it may be greater or less than mg depending on speed. But wait, in this case, the tension can't be less than mg because cos(theta) can't be greater than 1. So T can't be less than mg. So J is incorrect.

Option A says it may be equal to mg, but that's only if the speed is zero. So when the ball is moving, it's always greater.

So the correct answer should be D: is greater than mg always.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the vertical component. The vertical component supports the weight. So T*cos(theta) = mg. So T = mg / cos(theta). Since cos(theta) is less than 1, T is greater. So yes, D seems correct.

Another way to think about it: the tension in the string must not only support the weight but also provide the centripetal force. So it's doing two jobs now, which means the tension must be higher than when it was just supporting the weight.

When a ball is at rest hanging by a string, the tension in the string is **mg**, as it only needs to balance the weight of the ball. However, when the ball is made to move in a horizontal circle, the string tilts at an angle **θ** to the vertical, forming a cone. In this scenario, the tension **T** in the string must now perform two roles: 

1. The vertical component of the tension, **T*cos(θ)**, must still balance the weight of the ball (**mg**).  
2. The horizontal component of the tension, **T*sin(θ)**, provides the centripetal force required for the circular motion, which is given by **mv²/r**, where **m** is the mass, **v** is the speed, and **r** is the radius of the circle.

From the vertical force balance, we have:  
\[
T \cos(\theta) = mg \implies T = \frac{mg}{\cos(\theta)}
\]  
Since **cos(θ)** is less than 1 (because **θ > 0**), it follows that **T > mg**. This means the tension in the string is always greater than **mg** when the ball is moving in a horizontal circle, regardless of the speed. 

Analyzing the options:  
- **A**: Incorrect. Tension cannot equal **mg** when the ball is moving, as it must also provide a centripetal force.  
- **B**: Incorrect. Tension is **mg** only when the ball is at rest.  
- **C**: Incorrect. Tension is never less than **mg** in this scenario.  
- **D**: Correct. Tension is always greater than **mg** due to the additional centripetal force requirement.  
- **E**: Incorrect. Tension is not equal to the square of the speed.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Tension changes as the speed changes.  
- **G**: Incorrect. Tension is not inversely proportional to speed.  
- **H**: Incorrect. Tension is not always less than **mg**.  
- **I**: Incorrect. Tension is not directly proportional to speed.  
- **J**: Incorrect. Tension cannot be less than **mg**; it is always greater.  

Thus, the correct answer is **D: is greater than mg always**.
