Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about psychological perspectives on aging. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: If you believe that we are mostly in control of our own development and that our behaviors, good or bad, determine how successful our aging will be, which perspective does that fit?

The options are A through J, each a different term: Continuity, Discontinuity, Organismic, Nurture, Dynamic Systems, Stochastic, Nature, Mechanistic, Evolutionary, Contextual.

Alright, I'm a bit rusty on some of these theories, but let me think. So the key here is the belief that our own actions and behaviors significantly influence our aging process. So it's about personal control and the impact of our choices on how well we age.

I remember that in psychology, there are different theories about development and aging. One of them is the nature vs. nurture debate, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Nature would be about genetics, and Nurture about environment. But the question is more about personal control over one's own development.

Wait, there's also the idea of organismic theories, I think. Organismic theories, like those proposed by Goldstein or Rogers, emphasize the individual's potential for self-actualization and personal growth. They suggest that people have an innate drive towards self-realization and that their behaviors and choices play a significant role in their development.

Another thought: the mechanistic perspective views humans as machines, more passive and determined by external factors. That doesn't fit because the question is about being in control, so it's more active.

Contextual perspectives, like Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, look at the environment's role. But again, the focus here is on the individual's own behaviors, so maybe not.

Dynamic Systems theory is about the interaction of variables and changes over time, but I'm not sure if that's the exact fit here.

Stochastic refers to randomness, which doesn't seem to apply. Evolutionary perspective is about traits that have evolved, but that's more about why certain behaviors exist rather than individual control.

Continuity vs. Discontinuity refers to whether development is a smooth process or has stages. That might not directly relate to control over aging.

Oh wait, the question is about believing that our behaviors determine our successful aging. So it's about the impact of our actions, implying that we have agency. That sounds like the organismic view, which focuses on the individual's active role in their development.

Alternatively, is there another perspective that's more about personal control? Maybe the contextual perspective? No, I think contextual is more about the environment influencing behavior.

Wait, another angle: some theories talk about successful aging as being influenced by lifestyle choices, which would tie into the idea of personal control. The organismic approach does focus on the individual's drive and self-actualization, which aligns with the belief that our behaviors determine our aging success.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C: Organismic.

The question asks which psychological perspective aligns with the belief that individuals are mostly in control of their own development and that their behaviors significantly influence the success of their aging process. The key focus is on personal agency and the impact of individual choices.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Continuity** and **B: Discontinuity** refer to whether development is smooth or stage-based, which doesn't directly relate to personal control.
- **C: Organismic** emphasizes the individual's active role in growth and self-actualization, fitting the idea that behaviors determine aging success.
- **D: Nurture** and **G: Nature** pertain to environmental and genetic factors, respectively, not personal control.
- **E: Dynamic Systems** involves interactions and changes over time but doesn't specifically highlight individual agency.
- **F: Stochastic** refers to randomness, which is irrelevant here.
- **H: Mechanistic** views humans passively, contrary to the active control described.
- **I: Evolutionary** explains why traits exist but doesn't focus on individual control.
- **J: Contextual** emphasizes environmental influences rather than personal behaviors.

The organismic perspective best matches the belief in personal control and the impact of behaviors on aging.

Answer: C
