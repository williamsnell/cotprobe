Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about an isentropic expansion of a gas mixture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a mixture of helium and nitrogen. The amounts are 6 moles of helium and 4 moles of nitrogen. The initial conditions are 170°F and 120 psia. They expand isentropically to 25 psia. I need to find the final temperature and the entropy change for each gas.

Wait, isentropic means no entropy change for the process, right? Or wait, since it's an ideal gas, the entropy change is calculated for each gas, but the total is zero because it's isentropic overall. Hmm, but wait, the question says to find the entropy change for each constituent. So maybe each has its own change, but the sum is zero because the overall process is isentropic.

But wait, for an ideal gas, the entropy change when the process is isentropic should be zero. Oh wait, no. Wait no, in an isentropic process, the total entropy change is zero. But each constituent might have their own entropy changes that sum to zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the process is isentropic, so the total entropy change of the system is zero. So, the sum of the entropy changes of both gases should be zero. So if helium's entropy change is +X, nitrogen's must be -X.

Wait, but let's think about the process. Since the process is isentropic, the total entropy change is zero. Each gas contributes to the total, so their individual changes should add up to zero. So for each gas, the entropy change would be based on their own properties during expansion.

Okay, moving on. The first part is finding the final temperature.

Wait, the process is isentropic, so for each gas, the process can be considered isentropic. But wait, in a mixture, each gas expands, but since they’re both ideal gases, they don’t interact. So each follows their own isentropic process.

Wait, but the initial temperature is the same for both, and the final temperature will be the same as well because they’re in the same mixture. So each gas undergoes expansion from the same initial T and P to the same final P, but each has their own gamma (Cp/Cv ratio).

Wait, that makes sense.

So for each gas, I can model it as expanding isentropically from initial state (T_initial, P_initial) to final pressure P_final, and find the final temperature for each. But since they are in a mixture, the final temperatures must be the same, so I can set up equations for each to find T_final.

Wait, but wait, for each gas, the process is isentropic, so the relation is:

(P_initial / P_final) = (T_initial / T_final) ^ (gamma/(gamma-1)) )

Wait, no, the isentropic relation for an ideal gas is T_final = T_initial * (P_final / P_initial)^((gamma-1)/gamma) )

Wait, no. Let me think. The isentropic relations are:

For pressure and temperature: (T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1) ^ [(γ-1)/γ]

Or, it can also be written as (P2 / P1) = (T2 / T1) ^ [γ/(γ-1)]

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get it right. The isentropic relation for an ideal gas is:

T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1) ^ [(γ - 1)/γ ]

Wait, no, wait: the correct formula is T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1) ^ [(γ-1)/γ ]

Wait, let me think about it. Because when pressure increases, temperature increases if it's an isentropic compression. So if P increases, T increases. So the formula must reflect that. So if P2 > P1, then T2 > T1.

So for expansion, P2 < P1, so T2 < T1.

So, the formula is T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1) ^ [(γ -1)/γ ]

Wait, but let's clarify. The relation is:

(T2/T1) = (P2/P1) ^ [(γ-1)/γ ]

Yes, that's correct.

So, for each gas, I can compute T2 based on their γ.

But wait, the final temperature must be the same for both gases because it's a mixture. So I can set up two equations for T2, one for helium and one for nitrogen, and solve.

Wait, but that would mean that (T2/T1) = (P2/P1) ^ [(γ_he -1)/γ_he ] for helium, and similarly for nitrogen. But T2 is same for both, so:

(T2/T1) = (P2/P1) ^ [ (γ_he-1)/γ_he ] = (P2/P1) ^ [ (γ_n2 -1)/γ_n2 ]

Wait, but that's only possible if (γ_he-1)/γ_he equals (γ_n2 -1)/γ_n2. Which would only be true if γ_he = γ_n2, which isn't the case.

Wait, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe each gas expands isentropically, but the final temperatures are different? But that can't be, because in a mixture, the temperature is the same for all components.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, the key here might be that the mixture expands isentropically. So the entropy change for the entire mixture is zero. But each component's entropy change depends on their own expansion.

So, perhaps I should model each gas's process as an isentropic expansion, but the final temperature is the same for both.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach. Since the process is isentropic for the mixture, the total entropy change is zero. So the sum of the entropy changes of helium and nitrogen is zero.

So, for each gas, the entropy change is calculated using the formula for an ideal gas in an isentropic process. But wait, in an isentropic process, the entropy change is zero. But that's for each gas? Or for the whole system?

Wait, no. Wait, each gas is undergoing its own process. Suppose the whole mixture is expanding isentropically, but each gas's process may not be isentropic because they interact through the mixture. Hmm, but the problem states that the expansion is isentropic, so the total entropy change is zero.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering the entropy change for each gas during expansion and set their sum to zero.

Each gas's entropy change can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Wait, because entropy change for ideal gas is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

But wait, another formula I recall is:

ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1)

Hmm, but depending on the process. Alternatively, for an ideal gas, the entropy change can be expressed as:

ΔS = n R ln( (P1 V2)/(P2 V1) ) + n Cv ln(T2/T1)

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, for an ideal gas undergoing a process from state 1 to 2, the change in entropy is:

ΔS = m [ Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

Wait, but m is mass. Alternatively, with n moles, it's:

ΔS = n [ Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

Wait, but wait, Cp is the molar specific heat at constant pressure. And R is the gas constant.

Wait, another approach: for an isentropic process of an ideal gas, the entropy change is zero. But this is for a process where the gas is expanding without exchange of heat, etc. But in this problem, the mixture is expanding, but each gas is part of the mixture. So the overall process is isentropic, but individual gases might have entropy changes that cancel each other.

So, the sum of the entropy changes for helium and nitrogen is zero.

Each gas's entropy change is:

ΔS_he = n_he [ Cp_he ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

ΔS_n2 = n_n2 [ Cp_n2 ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

Wait, because both gases are expanding to the same P2 and same T2, since they are part of the same mixture.

Wait, but is that correct? Hmm.

Wait, the initial and final pressures are the same for both gases because they're in the same container. So P_initial is 120 psia, P_final is 25 psia. The initial temperature is the same (170°F), and the final temperature T2 is same for both.

So, each gas undergoes a process from (T1, P1) to (T2, P2), and since the overall process is isentropic, ΔS_total = ΔS_he + ΔS_n2 = 0.

So, let me write the equations:

ΔS_he = n_he [ Cp_he ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

ΔS_n2 = n_n2 [ Cp_n2 ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

And ΔS_he + ΔS_n2 = 0.

So,

n_he [ Cp_he ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ] + n_n2 [ Cp_n2 ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ] = 0

Hmm, perhaps. Let's factor this equation.

Let me factor out the terms:

[ n_he Cp_he + n_n2 Cp_n2 ] * ln(T2/T1) - [ n_he R + n_n2 R ] ln(P2/P1) = 0

Wait, because both terms have ln(T2/T1) and ln(P2/P1) respectively.

Hmm, that's a good step. Let me compute the terms.

First, I need to know Cp for helium and nitrogen. Helium is a monatomic gas, so Cp_he = (5/2) R.

Nitrogen is diatomic, so at room temperature, Cp_n2 = (7/2) R. Wait, but wait, at high temperatures, diatomic gases have Cp of (7/2) R, but at lower temps, it's (5/2) R. But for this problem, perhaps it's safe to assume full degrees of freedom.

So, Cp_he = (5/2) R, and Cp_n2 = (7/2) R.

R is the gas constant, 10.73 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R) ??? Wait, no, more accurately, R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R), but I'm not sure about the exact value. Wait, perhaps we can use R as 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R).

Wait, but maybe the exact value will cancel out in the equations. Let's proceed.

Let me compute the coefficients:

Term1 = n_he * Cp_he + n_n2 * Cp_n2
Term2 = (n_he + n_n2) * R

Wait, because both have R as the coefficient for the pressure term.

So, the equation becomes:

Term1 * ln(T2/T1) - Term2 * ln(P2/P1) = 0

So,

Term1 * ln(T2/T1) = Term2 * ln(P2/P1)

So,

ln(T2/T1) = (Term2 / Term1) * ln(P2/P1)

Then,

T2 = T1 * (P2/P1) ^ (Term2 / Term1 )

Okay, now let's plug in the numbers.

n_he = 6 lbmol
n_n2 =4 lbmol

Cp_he = (5/2) R
Cp_n2 = (7/2) R

Term1 = 6*(5/2 R) + 4*(7/2 R) = [6*(5/2) +4*(7/2)] R
= [15 +14] R = 29 R

Term2 = (6 +4) R =10 R

So,

ln(T2/T1) = (10 R / 29 R ) * ln(P2/P1)

The R cancels:

ln(T2/T1) = (10/29) * ln(P2/P1 )

So,

T2 = T1 * (P2/P1 )^(10/29 )

Now, compute P2/P1: P2 is 25 psia, P1 is 120 psia.

P2/P1 = 25/120 = 5/24 ≈ 0.208333...

ln(0.208333) is approximately ln(5/24) = ln(5) - ln(24) ≈ 1.6094 - 3.1781 ≈ -1.5687.

So,

ln(T2/T1) = (10/29)*(-1.5687) ≈ (0.3448)*(-1.5687) ≈ -0.5413.

So,

T2 = T1 * exp(-0.5413) = T1 * 0.582.

Wait, but wait, T1 is given in °F. We need to convert that to absolute temperature, Rankine.

T1 = 170°F = 170 + 459.67 = 629.67 °R.

So,

T2 = 629.67 * 0.582 ≈ let's compute that.

629.67 * 0.5 = 314.835

629.67 *0.08= 50.3736

So, 0.582 is 0.5 + 0.08 +0.002.

Wait, 0.582 = 0.5 + 0.08 + 0.002.

So,

314.835 + 50.3736 = 365.2086

Then, 629.67 * 0.002 = 1.25934.

So, 365.2086 +1.25934 ≈ 366.467 °R.

Hmm, approximately 366.5 °R.

Looking at the options, option A is 366.8°R, option C is same temp, D same.

So part (a) is around 366.8°R, which matches option A, C, D.

Now part (b): entropy change for each gas.

We know that the total entropy change is zero. So, ΔS_he + ΔS_n2 =0.

Each gas's entropy change is:

ΔS = n [ Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

Wait, but wait, no. The formula for entropy change is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Wait, but let me think again. The correct formula for entropy change when both T and P change is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Wait, yes, that's correct. Because for an ideal gas, the entropy change is given by:

ΔS = n [ Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

Alternatively, it can be written as ΔS = n R ln( (P1 V2)/(P2 V1) ) + n Cv ln(T2/T1), but the first form is more useful here.

So, for each gas:

ΔS_he = n_he [ Cp_he ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

ΔS_n2 = n_n2 [ Cp_n2 ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

We can plug in the numbers.

First, compute ln(T2/T1). We have T2=366.467 °R, T1=629.67 °R.

T2/T1 = 366.467 / 629.67 ≈ 0.5825.

ln(0.5825) ≈ -0.5413.

Similarly, P2=25 psia, P1=120 psia.

P2/P1 =25/120=0.208333.

ln(0.208333) ≈-1.5687.

Now, compute for helium:

n_he =6 lbmol.

Cp_he = (5/2) R.

So,

ΔS_he =6 [ (5/2 R) * (-0.5413) - R * (-1.5687) ]

=6 R [ (5/2)(-0.5413) +1.5687 ]

Compute inside the brackets:

(5/2)(-0.5413) = (2.5)(-0.5413) ≈-1.35325

Adding 1.5687 gives: -1.35325 +1.5687 ≈ 0.21545.

So,

ΔS_he =6 R * 0.21545 ≈6 * 0.21545 R ≈1.2927 R.

Wait, but the units are in Btu/°R. Because entropy is in Btu/(lbmol·°R).

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify the units. 

The gas constant R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R). But when calculating entropy in terms of Btu, it's better to use R in units that will lead to entropy in Btu/(lbmol·°R).

Wait, R in Btu units: 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf.

So, R =10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R).

But psia is lbf/in². So 1 psia = 1 lbf/in².

And 1 ft³ = 12³ in³ = 1728 in³.

So,

R =10.7316 (lbf/in²) * ft³ / (lbmol·°R )

But 1 ft³ = 1728 in³, so:

R =10.7316 * 1728 (lbf·in³) / (lbmol·°R )

But 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf. So 1 lbf·ft = 1 lbf * 12 in = 12 lbf·in.

So converting R to Btu/(lbmol·°R):

R =10.7316 *1728 * (lbf·in³) / (lbmol·°R )

But 1 ft³ is 1728 in³, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use R = 1.986 Btu
