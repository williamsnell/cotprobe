The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Question 13. A buyer sent a signed letter to a seller that stated: "Ship 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box, the price quoted in your circular." The seller mailed the buyer a signed form acknowledgment that agreed to the buyer's terms and stated on the reverse side: "Disputes regarding quality shall be arbitrated." The buyer did not reply to the seller's acknowledgment, and the seller shipped the nails. When the buyer received the nails, it found their quality to be unsatisfactory and sued the seller for breach of warranty. The seller has asked an attorney whether the parties' contract requires arbitration of the buyer's claim. What is the best advice the attorney can provide?

Options:

A: A contract was formed when the buyer received the nails, but the arbitration term is not valid as it was not explicitly agreed upon by the buyer.
B: A contract was formed pursuant to conduct when the buyer received the nails, and a court would exclude the arbitration provision from the contract.
C: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term must be accepted by the buyer because it was included in the acknowledgment.
D: No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment was a new term that was not in the original agreement.
E: No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment created a counteroffer that the buyer never accepted.
F: A contract was formed when the buyer sent the letter, and the arbitration term is not valid because the buyer didn't agree to it.
G: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.
H: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term automatically became part of the contract because the buyer didn't object.
I: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract. arbitration term became part of the contract.
J: No contract exists, because the buyer didn't respond to the seller's acknowledgment.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) because it's about the sale of goods. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A buyer sends a signed letter to a seller. The letter says, "Ship 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box, the price quoted in your circular." So the buyer is making an offer here, right? They're offering to buy these nails at a specific price.

Then, the seller mails back a signed form acknowledgment. This acknowledgment agrees to the buyer's terms but adds something on the reverse side: "Disputes regarding quality shall be arbitrated." So the seller is responding, but adding an extra term about arbitration.

The buyer doesn't reply to this acknowledgment, but the seller ships the nails anyway. When the buyer gets them, they're unhappy with the quality and sue for breach of warranty. The seller is now asking if the contract requires arbitration.

I need to figure out if the arbitration term is part of the contract and whether the buyer is bound by it. 

Under the UCC, when dealing with merchants, additional terms become part of the contract unless they materially alter it or the offeror objects. Also, the 'battle of the forms' concept comes into play. 

So the buyer's offer was in their letter. The seller's response was an acknowledgment with an additional term. Since both are merchants (I assume because they're buying/selling goods), the UCC rules apply.

Now, the key points: The buyer's offer didn't include arbitration. The seller's acknowledgment includes an arbitration clause. The buyer didn't respond but accepted the goods.

Under UCC § 2-207, which deals with additional terms in commercial contracts, when both parties are merchants, additional terms don't become part of the contract if they materially alter it. But if they're non-material, they're included unless the offeror (buyer) specifically objects. Also, in some cases, the additional terms can be considered a proposal for addition, and if the offeror doesn't object and later accepts the goods, those terms become part of the contract.

In this case, the seller added a term about arbitration. Is this a material alteration? Arbitration clauses can sometimes be seen as material because they affect the parties' rights to a trial. But in commercial settings, they're often considered standard. 

So when the seller sent the acknowledgment with the arbitration term, it's an additional term under UCC 2-207. Since the buyer didn't object and later accepted the goods, the arbitration term would likely be considered part of the contract. 

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be one where a contract was formed when the seller mailed the acknowledgment, and the arbitration term is part of the contract. 

Option H says the term automatically became part because the buyer didn’t object. But wait, under 2-207, the additional terms are considered unless they materially alter the contract or the offeror objects. If the term is a material alteration, it's excluded unless the offeree (seller) is the one proposing it, and the offeror (buyer) doesn't object. But in this case, the seller is the offeree, so their additional term is treated as a proposal. Since the buyer didn't object and accepted the goods, the term is included.

Option I says the term became part of the contract. But the option is a bit redundant. Option H says it automatically became part because the buyer didn't object. So which is correct?

Wait, under 2-207(2), the additional terms become part of the contract unless: 

- They materially alter the contract, or 

- The offeror (buyer) objects within a reasonable time, or 

- The offeror has already objected in a signed agreement.

In this case, the seller added an arbitration term. If it's not a material alteration, then it stands. If it is, then it doesn't. But courts often find that arbitration clauses in standard forms are not material alterations, especially between merchants. So the term would likely be included.

So the contract was formed when the seller sent the acknowledgment (the offer was the buyer's letter; the seller's response was an acceptance with additional terms). Because the buyer didn't object and accepted the goods, the additional term is part of the contract.

Looking at the options:

Option C: contract formed when seller mailed acknowledgment, and arbitration term must be accepted. But that's not entirely correct because the buyer didn't have to accept it explicitly; their silence and acceptance of goods would suffice.

Option H: contract formed when seller mailed it, and term automatically became part because no objection. That's closer. 

Option G: court decides whether term is a material alteration. That's a possibility, but the question is about the best advice. Since the term is likely not a material alteration, the attorney would advise that it's part of the contract.

Wait, let me think again. The seller's acknowledgment was an acceptance with an additional term. Under 2-207, when the seller (offeree) sends an acceptance with additional terms, the buyer (offeror) can object. If the buyer doesn't object and later accepts the goods, the additional terms are included unless they're material alterations.

So the best answer is H: contract formed when seller mailed acknowledgment, and the term is part because the buyer didn't object. So the arbitration term is in.

Alternatively, option I says the same but is a bit awkwardly phrased. Looking at the options, H and I are similar. Option I says "arbitration term became part of the contract" twice, so maybe it's a typo. So probably, the correct answer is H.

Wait, but option I says, "arbitration term became part of the contract. arbitration term became part of the contract." That seems like a mistake, perhaps a typo where it was meant to say something else. So perhaps the intended correct answer is H.

Alternatively, another approach: under the UCC, when the seller sends an acknowledgment with additional terms, and the buyer doesn't object but accepts the goods, those terms are incorporated. So the contract includes the arbitration term.

So the attorney should advise that the arbitration term is part of the contract, so the buyer's claim must be arbitrated.

Looking back at the options:

Option H: Contract formed when seller mailed acknowledgment, term automatically part because no objection.

That's correct. So the answer is H.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-207, when both parties are merchants, additional terms in a contract become part of the agreement unless they materially alter the contract or the offeror objects. In this scenario, the buyer sent an offer to purchase nails, and the seller responded with an acknowledgment agreeing to the terms but adding an arbitration clause for disputes regarding quality. The buyer did not object to this additional term and subsequently accepted the goods.

The arbitration clause is not considered a material alteration of the contract, as such clauses are often deemed standard in commercial agreements. Since the buyer did not object to the additional term and accepted the goods, the arbitration clause became part of the contract under UCC § 2-207. Therefore, the buyer is bound by the arbitration term, and the attorney should advise the seller that the arbitration provision is valid and enforceable.

The best answer is:

**H: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term automatically became part of the contract because the buyer didn't object.**
