Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the crime of solicitation. I'm a bit rusty on criminal law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the options does not apply to solicitation. Let's go through each option one by one.

First, I remember that solicitation is when someone tries to get another person to commit a crime. It's like offering or encouraging someone else to do something illegal. So, the key elements are the intent to have the crime committed and the act of soliciting.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Withdrawal is generally not a defense. Hmm, I think that in some crimes, if you withdraw your solicitation before the crime is committed, it might be a defense. But for solicitation itself, I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think that once you've solicited, even if you later try to stop it, the act of solicitation has already been committed. So withdrawal isn't a defense for the solicitation charge. So A might be correct because it applies to solicitation.

Option B: It is an agreement between two or more to commit a crime. Wait, no, that sounds more like conspiracy. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime. Solicitation is just one person asking another to do it. So B doesn't apply to solicitation; it applies to conspiracy. So B would be the correct answer because it's not applicable to solicitation.

Option C: It is not considered a crime in some jurisdictions. Well, laws can vary by place. I think some places might not criminalize solicitation for certain crimes, maybe like misdemeanors. So C could be true, meaning it does apply to solicitation.

Option D: It is solicitation of another to commit a felony. I believe solicitation can be for any crime, not just felonies. Wait, but in many jurisdictions, solicitation to commit a felony is a crime, but maybe if it's a misdemeanor, it's not. Or perhaps the question is about whether it's specifically for a felony. I'm a bit confused. But I think the general idea is that solicitation can apply regardless, but I'm not certain. Maybe D is correct because it's describing a scenario where it's a felony.

Option E: No act is needed other than the solicitation. That sounds right. Solicitation is a specific intent crime; you don't need any further action beyond the act of soliciting. So E applies to solicitation.

Wait, back to option B. It's talking about an agreement, which is conspiracy. So B is not applicable to solicitation. So the question is which does NOT apply. The answer should be B.

So the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B.

**Explanation:**

- **Option A:** Correctly applies to solicitation because withdrawal after solicitation does not negate the initial act.
- **Option B:** Incorrectly describes solicitation; it refers to conspiracy, which requires an agreement between parties.
- **Option C:** Correctly applies as solicitation laws can vary by jurisdiction.
- **Option D:** Correctly applies as solicitation can involve felonies.
- **Option E:** Correctly applies because solicitation requires no act beyond the solicitation itself.

Thus, the answer is **B**.

B
