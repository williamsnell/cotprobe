Okay, so I've got this question about the percentage of Indian GDP that agriculture made up as of 2015. Hmm, I remember that agriculture is a significant part of India's economy, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact figure. Let me think through this.

First, I know that India is a developing country with a large population, and a substantial portion of its workforce is engaged in agriculture. But over the years, the contribution of agriculture to the GDP has been decreasing as other sectors like services and industry grow. So, I'm guessing it's lower than maybe what it was a few decades ago.

Wait, I think I've heard that around 2015, agriculture was about 15-20% of India's GDP. Let me see, the options given are A through J. Looking at the options: H is 16%, G is 22%, D is 8%, E is 10%, and so on. So, if my memory serves right, it's around 16%.

But wait, I might be mixing up numbers. I recall that sometimes the percentage can be around 18-20%, but maybe that's for employment or something else. Let me think again: in 2015, India's GDP composition was primarily from services, followed by industry, and then agriculture. Services were around 50-60%, industry maybe 25-30%, so agriculture would be the remaining, which would be around 20% or less.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing employment statistics with GDP contribution. Because a large percentage of the population works in agriculture, but their contribution to GDP is lower because agriculture isn't as productive per person as other sectors. So if a lot of people work in agriculture but their output isn't as high, the GDP percentage would be lower than the employment percentage.

So, if around 50% of the workforce is in agriculture, but maybe it only contributes 15-20% to GDP. So among the options, 16% is option H, 22% is G. Now, I'm trying to remember if it's 16 or 22. I think in 2015, it was around 18%, but that's not one of the options. Wait, maybe I'm off by a few years.

Alternatively, perhaps it's lower. I think around 2015, the figure was approximately 17-18%, but since that's not an option, the closest would be 16% (H) or 22% (G). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: I remember reading that in 2015, India's agriculture sector accounted for around 18% of GDP. But since that's not an option, I have to pick the closest one. But looking at the options, the closest is 16% (H). Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken and it's 22% (G).

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the trend. In the early 2000s, agriculture was around 25%, and it's been declining since. So by 2015, it would have gone down to maybe 16-18%. So 16% (H) is an option, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another way: I think the service sector was about 50%, industry around 25%, so 100 minus 75 would leave 25% for agriculture, but that might not be accurate because sometimes the exact numbers vary.

Wait, perhaps I should recall a specific statistic. I think as of 2015, the percentage was around 18%, but since that's not an option, maybe the closest is 16% or 22%. If I have to choose between H and G, I think I might have heard 16% more recently, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing with the percentage of the workforce. If 50% of the workforce is in agriculture, but contributes 16% to GDP, that makes sense because each worker in other sectors is more productive.

So, considering all that, I'll go with 16%, which is option H.

As of 2015, agriculture made up about 16% of India's total GDP. This figure reflects the sector's declining contribution compared to previous decades, as the services and industrial sectors have grown significantly. While a large portion of the workforce is engaged in agriculture, its productivity per worker is lower than in other sectors, leading to a smaller GDP share. Among the given options, 16% is the closest and most accurate estimate.
