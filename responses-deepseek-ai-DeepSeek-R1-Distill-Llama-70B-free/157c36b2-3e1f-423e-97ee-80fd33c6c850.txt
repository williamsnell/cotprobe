The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Which reason may constitute sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to enable a litigant to file a late notice of appeal past the 30-day deadline?

Options:

A: The district court judge assured the litigant that the late filing would be permitted.
B: The litigant's original attorney neglected to file notice on time, and now the litigant has retained a new attorney to file the appeal and has also sued the former attorney for malpractice.
C: The litigant ran a red light causing a car crash just before the judgment was rendered, and was in the hospital for two months recovering.
D: Opposing counsel agreed not to object to the late notice of appeal.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about appellate procedure, specifically dealing with the rules around filing a notice of appeal late. Hmm, I remember that generally, the notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days from the entry of the judgment. But sometimes, people can file late if they have a good reason, which is called "good cause" or "excusable neglect."

The question is asking which of the options A to D would be a sufficient reason to allow a late filing. Let me think about each option.

Option A says the district court judge assured the litigant that the late filing would be permitted. I'm not sure about this. If a judge tells someone it's okay, does that count? But wait, I think that generally, a judge's assurance isn't enough. Because the rules are pretty strict, and even if a judge says it's okay, they might not have the authority to extend the deadline beyond the allowed time. So maybe A isn't a good reason.

Option B is about the litigant's original attorney neglecting to file on time, and now they have a new attorney and are suing for malpractice. So attorney error. I recall that sometimes excusable neglect includes situations where the attorney made a mistake, like missing a deadline. But I think it depends. If the client gave the attorney timely instructions, and the attorney just messed up, that can be a valid reason. But if the client was the one who didn't tell the attorney in time, then maybe not. So B could be a good option because it's the attorney's fault, not the client's.

Option C states the litigant was in a car crash just before judgment and was hospitalized for two months. That sounds like a serious situation. If someone is incapacitated and couldn't file because they were in the hospital, that might count as good cause. Incapacity or significant circumstances beyond their control preventing timely filing could be a valid reason. So C could be a possible answer.

Option D mentions opposing counsel agreed not to object. I think that's not sufficient. Just because the other side agrees doesn't mean the court will accept it. The rules don't allow for extensions by agreement; it's up to the court's discretion based on good cause shown. So D probably isn't a valid reason.

So now I'm considering B and C. Between the two, which is more likely to be considered excusable neglect or good cause.

Option B is about attorney negligence. I think courts have held that an attorney's mistake can be excusable neglect. For example, if the attorney thought they had more time or misfiled the notice, that can be a reason. So B seems valid.

Option C is about the litigant being hospitalized. That's a personal issue beyond their control. If they were unable to file because they were incapacitated, that would definitely be good cause. So C also seems valid.

Wait, but in the case of the hospitalization, does the timeline make sense? The crash happened just before the judgment was rendered, so the 30-day period would start when the judgment is entered. If the person was in the hospital for two months, that would cover the entire 30 days and then some. So they couldn't have filed on time because they were in the hospital. That sounds like a solid reason.

So both B and C could be correct. But I need to pick the best option. The question asks which "may" constitute good cause, so either could be possible, but looking back at the options, I need to see which is more likely.

I think both are valid, but the question only gives one correct answer. So perhaps I should think about which is more clearly established.

In some cases, attorney neglect is a common reason for excusable neglect. For example, if the attorney made a mistake in calendaring the deadline. So B would be a reason. Similarly, being hospitalized and unable to act would also be a reason.

Wait, but the question is about which option may constitute good cause. So both could, but I have to pick the correct one.

Alternatively, maybe one of them isn't. Let me think about the rules. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 4(a)(5) allows the district court to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal if the moving party shows excusable neglect or good cause.

Case law examples: For example, in cases where an attorney mistakenly thought the deadline was longer, or miscalculated it, leading to a late filing, courts have found excusable neglect. Similarly, when a litigant was incarcerated and couldn't file, that's been considered. But in the case of a car accident causing hospitalization, that would prevent the litigant from filing, so that's good cause.

So both B and C seem valid. But the answer options have only one correct answer.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B says the litigant has sued the former attorney for malpractice. Does that affect anything? I don't think so; the fact that they've sued may indicate they're taking action, but the key point is that the original attorney neglected to file on time.

So, between B and C, both could be valid. But perhaps the answer expects B as the correct choice because it's about attorney neglect, which is a classic example of excusable neglect.

Alternatively, some might argue that option C is more clearly a case of good cause because it's a physical incapacity beyond the litigant's control.

Wait, but the question is which may constitute sufficient good cause. So either could, but I think the correct answer is B and C are both possible.

But since the question asks for which option may be correct, perhaps only one is.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

In the case where the litigant was in the hospital, that's a clear case of being unable to file due to circumstances beyond their control. So that's good cause.

In the case of the attorney's neglect, that's excusable neglect.

So both options B and C could be correct. But in the answer options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B. Because the option says the litigant has retained a new attorney and is suing the former one. Maybe that shows diligence. But the key is whether the original attorney's neglect is excusable. The courts often consider whether the client acted reasonably in relying on the attorney.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, because it's a more direct case of being unable to file.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to recall any specific examples or cases. Oh, for example, in cases where the appellant was in the hospital during the filing period, courts have granted extensions. Similarly, when an attorney makes a mistake, like missing the deadline, that's also a reason.

So perhaps both B and C are correct, but the question only allows one answer. Wait, looking back at the question, the options are A through D, and only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Because the question is about the litigant's situation, and the attorney's neglect is a common reason. On the other hand, option C's situation would definitely prevent the litigant from filing, making it a clear case of good cause.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B because the attorney's mistake is a well-established reason, while option C's situation might be more about impossibility, which might require a different standard.

Alternatively, perhaps both are correct, but looking at the answer options, I have to choose the best one.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to D, and the question is about which may constitute sufficient good cause. So perhaps the answer is B.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is B. Because in some cases, when the client relies on the attorney, and the attorney makes a mistake, that's excusable neglect. But if the client is in the hospital, that's more about impossibility, which might fall under a different standard, perhaps a different rule.

Wait, no, Rule 4(a)(5) covers both excusable neglect and good cause. So either situation could apply.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to think of it from the perspective of what's more likely to be accepted.

Attorney error is a common reason for excusable neglect. For example, in the case where the attorney thought the deadline was longer, or the court's clerk gave wrong information, that's excusable.

In option C, the litigant was in a car crash and hospitalized. That's a clear case of being unable to file, so that's good cause.

So I think both B and C are correct, but the question only allows one correct answer. Wait, no, each option is separate, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but that's not possible here.

Wait, the options are given as four separate choices, and I have to choose the correct one. So perhaps the correct answer is B because it's about excusable neglect by the attorney, which is a standard reason, while option C might be a more extreme situation, but perhaps it's not covered under excusable neglect but rather under a different rule.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the correct answer is B and C are both possible, but perhaps the answer is B.

Wait, no, I think the answer is B. Because the question is about excusable neglect, which includes attorney neglect. While option C is about good cause, which is a different standard.

Wait, no, the question says "good cause or excusable neglect." So either situation could apply. But the options are separate.

I think I'm stuck. But I'll go with B as the correct answer because attorney error is a classic example of excusable neglect. So the answer is B.

To determine which reason may constitute sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to allow a late notice of appeal, we analyze each option:

- **Option A**: A district court judge's assurance that a late filing would be permitted is generally not sufficient. The rules governing appellate deadlines are strict, and a judge's informal assurance does not override the requirement to file timely.

- **Option B**: Attorney negligence, such as failing to file the notice of appeal on time, is a well-established example of excusable neglect. Courts have consistently held that a client's reasonable reliance on an attorney's actions (or inactions) can justify a late filing. This option is a strong candidate.

- **Option C**: A litigant being hospitalized for two months due to a car crash before the judgment was rendered presents a clear case of good cause. Incapacitation or circumstances beyond the litigant's control that prevent timely filing are commonly recognized as valid reasons for a late appeal.

- **Option D**: An agreement by opposing counsel not to object to the late filing is insufficient. Appellate rules do not permit extensions by mutual agreement; the court must independently determine whether good cause or excusable neglect exists.

Both **B** and **C** present valid reasons, but the question asks for the most appropriate answer. Attorney negligence (B) is a classic example of excusable neglect, while hospitalization (C) is a clear case of good cause. However, since the question requires selecting one option, **B** is the more established and frequently recognized reason under the rules of appellate procedure.

Answer: B
