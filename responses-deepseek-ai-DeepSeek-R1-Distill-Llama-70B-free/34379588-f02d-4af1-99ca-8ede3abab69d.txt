Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Gwen wrote a number pattern: 1, 5, 9, 13. And I need to find the next two terms. The options are from A to J, each with different pairs of numbers.

Hmm, I remember that number patterns usually follow a certain rule, often involving addition or subtraction. Let me look at the given numbers: 1, 5, 9, 13. So the first thing I should do is check the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern there.

So, let's calculate the differences. Between 1 and 5, that's an increase of 4. Then between 5 and 9, that's another 4. Oh wait, no, 5 to 9 is also 4. Then 9 to 13 is 4 again. Wait, no, wait. 1 to 5 is +4. 5 to 9 is +4. 9 to 13 is +4. Oh wait, that's consistent. So each time, we're adding 4. That means it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.

If that's the case, then the next term after 13 would be 13 + 4 = 17. Then the term after that would be 17 +4 =21. So the next two terms should be 17 and 21.

Looking at the options, let me check each one. Option A is 17,23. That's not right because after 17 comes 21, not 23. Option B is 19,25. No, that's adding 6 each time. Option C is 19,23. Also adding 4 each time but starting from 19. Wait, no, 19 to 23 is +4, but the previous step was 13 to 17, so 17 should come next. So C is incorrect.

Option D is 21,23. That would mean the next term is 21, which is correct after 17, but the option doesn't include 17. Wait, the question asks for the next two terms, so after 13, which are 17 and 21. So the pair should be 17,21. Let me check which option that is.

Looking back: Option A is 17,23. No. Option H is 17,21. Yes, option H. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. Option A: 17,23. Option H: 17,21. So yes, option H is 17,21.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me double-check the differences. 1 to 5 is +4, 5 to 9 is +4, 9 to 13 is +4. So yes, each step adds 4. So after 13, next is 17, then 21. So the next two terms are 17 and 21.

So looking at the options, which option has 17 and 21? Let's see:

A:17,23 → No, because after 17 should be 21, not 23.

H:17,21 → Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option H.

The pattern given is 1, 5, 9, 13. Each term increases by 4, indicating an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. The next two terms are calculated as follows:

- After 13: 13 + 4 = 17  
- After 17: 17 + 4 = 21  

Thus, the next two terms are 17 and 21. Among the options, H matches this result.

Answer: H
