Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down what's given and what's being asked.

So, the setup is that we have a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, X_n for n ≥ 1. Each X_i can take the values 1 or -1. The probabilities are given as P(X_i=1) = 0.8 and P(X_i=-1) = 0.2. That means each step is more likely to be +1 than -1.

We define S_0 as 0, and S_n as the sum from i=1 to n of X_i. So S_n is like a random walk starting at 0 and moving according to the X_i's.

The range R_n is the number of distinct values taken by the sequence S_0, S_1, ..., S_n. So for each step up to n, we count how many different values the S_k's have taken. We're interested in the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) * E[R_n], where E is the expectation.

Hmm, the question is about the limit of the expected range divided by n. So I'm thinking this relates to some kind of asymptotic behavior of the random walk.

First, I should consider the expected behavior of S_n. Since each X_i is +1 with probability 0.8 and -1 with 0.2, the expected value E[X_i] is 0.8*(1) + 0.2*(-1) = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6. So the drift is positive; on average, each step increases S by 0.6. Therefore, over time, S_n grows without bound, albeit with fluctuations.

But R_n is about the number of distinct values visited up to time n. So, for a random walk, the range would be related to how much the walk has spread out. But since the walk has a positive drift, it's moving mostly upwards, but with some downward steps.

Wait, but the range R_n counts all the distinct S_k's from k=0 to n. So even if the walk goes up and then down, it might revisit some values, but since it's more likely to go up, it's probably moving in an overall upward direction, so the range increases as the walk explores new maximums and maybe some new minimums, but the minimums might not go too far below zero because of the positive drift.

But wait, over time, the walk is more likely to go up than down. So the maximum value of S_k up to time n is going to be roughly around n*0.6, because on average each step adds 0.6. But due to the variance, the actual path will fluctuate around this mean.

Now, the range R_n would be the difference between the maximum and minimum S_k up to time n, plus one (since it's inclusive). But wait, no—range as the number of distinct values is actually (max - min + 1). Because if the walk goes from a to b, where a < b, the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1.

Wait, but does that hold? Let's say the walk goes from 0 to 5 and back to 3. Then the max is 5, min is 0, so the range would be 5 - 0 + 1 = 6. But the walk has visited 0,1,2,3,4,5, so that's 6 distinct values. So yes, R_n = max - min + 1.

But wait, in reality, the walk might not visit every integer between min and max. For example, if the walk jumps from 0 to 2 without hitting 1, then the range would not include 1. So my initial assumption that R_n is max - min +1 isn't correct. Instead, R_n could be less than that because some integers in between might not be visited.

Hmm, that complicates things. So R_n isn't just max - min +1, but the actual count of unique S_k's. So the range is the cardinality of the set {S_0, S_1, ..., S_n}.

I'm not sure how to compute E[R_n] directly. Maybe there's a way to model this as a Markov chain or use some asymptotic results from random walk theory.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of renewal theory or use the concept of the range of a random walk. I've heard that for symmetric random walks, the expected range grows linearly with n, but in this case, the walk is asymmetric and has a positive drift.

Wait, but in the symmetric case (p=0.5 for +1 and -1), the expected maximum of S_n up to time n is known to be on the order of sqrt(n), and similarly for the minimum. So the range would be roughly 2*sqrt(n), which would make E[R_n] grow like sqrt(n), so E[R_n]/n would go to zero as n approaches infinity. But wait, the options here don't have zero. So maybe I'm mixing up cases.

Wait no, in this problem, the walk is asymmetric with a drift to the right. So the behavior might be different. Let me think again.

In the asymmetric case where p > 0.5, the walk is transient and goes to infinity almost surely. So the maximum of S_n up to time n would be approximately the drift times n, which is 0.6n. Wait, but that's the expectation of S_n. But the maximum would be higher than that.

Wait, no. For a random walk with positive drift, the maximum M_n up to time n is going to be about the expected position plus some fluctuation. But I'm not sure about the exact scaling.

Wait, I think for a random walk with positive drift, the maximum position reached up to time n is approximately μn, where μ is the drift. So in our case, μ = E[X_i] = 0.6. So M_n ≈ 0.6n.

Similarly, the minimum position m_n reached up to time n would be less clear. Since the walk is drifting upwards, the minimum might not go too far below zero. Maybe the minimum would be around something like -sqrt(n), since the fluctuations are on the order of sqrt(n).

Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, the probability that it ever returns to zero after reaching a positive value might be less than one, but over time, the walk will eventually drift to infinity. So the minimum would be somewhere around negative sqrt(n), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe I'm complicating things. Another approach is to consider that in the long run, the walk is moving to the right, so the number of distinct sites it visits would be approximately the maximum it reaches, because it's not likely to revisit too many points on the left. But that's just a heuristic.

Alternatively, perhaps the range R_n is asymptotically equal to the maximum minus the minimum, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should look for some known results on the expected range of a random walk with drift.

Upon a quick recall, I think that for a random walk with positive drift, the expected range grows linearly with time. The coefficient would be related to the drift. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: since each step is +1 with high probability, the walk is moving to the right most of the time. So the number of distinct values visited up to time n would be roughly the number of steps to the right, minus some overlaps. But since the walk can sometimes go back, but overall, the net movement is positive.

Wait, but the walk can't go back too much because the drift is positive. So the number of new points visited each time would be something like the drift rate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the expected number of new points visited at each step is equal to the probability that the walk is making a new maximum. For a random walk with positive drift, the probability that each step sets a new maximum is equal to the probability that the walk hasn't returned too far, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the Kac moment formula or other renewal theory concepts. But maybe that's too advanced for this problem.

Another thought: since each X_i is either +1 or -1, the walk can only move one step at a time. So the range R_n counts how many unique integers have been visited from S_0 to S_n.

In the long run, the walk will have visited approximately n * p steps to the right, minus n*(1-p) steps to the left. But since p > 0.5, the walk is going to the right overall.

Wait, but the range R_n can't be more than n+1, because there are n steps from S_0 to S_n, so the maximum possible distinct values would be n+1 (if every step goes in the same direction without revisiting any point). But in reality, some steps will go back, so R_n will be less than n+1.

Wait, but as n grows, the expected R_n should grow proportionally to n. So the limit we're seeking is the proportionality constant.

Wait, perhaps the limit is the probability that each step takes the walk to a new maximum. For a random walk with positive drift, the probability that each step is a new maximum is equal to the probability that the walk hasn't yet turned around, which might be related to the generating function of the first return to the origin.

Alternatively, for each step, the probability that S_k is a new maximum is equal to the probability that the walk hasn't returned to any previous point, which in a symmetric walk is 1/k or something like that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps for an asymmetric walk, the probability that the k-th step is a new maximum tends to a constant as k becomes large. Let me think: for a simple asymmetric random walk on integers, starting at 0, with probability p of moving right and q=1-p of moving left, where p>0.5.

The expected number of new maxima up to time n is then the sum from k=1 to n of the probability that S_k is greater than all previous S_j's, j < k.

In the asymmetric case, I think the probability that S_k is a new maximum tends to a constant as k increases. Specifically, in the Gambler's ruin problem, the probability that the walk reaches a new maximum at each step approaches 1 - q/p, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the Gambler's ruin problem, the probability of eventual ruin when starting from 1 is (q/p). So the probability that the walk ever reaches 0 again is (q/p). So the probability that the walk never returns to 0 after the first step is 1 - (q/p).

Wait, but in our case, the walk starts at 0, and each step is +1 with probability p=0.8, so q=0.2. So the probability that the walk ever returns to 0 after the first step is (q/p) = 0.2/0.8 = 0.25. So the probability that it never returns to 0 is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.

Hmm, but how does that relate to the number of new maxima?

Wait, perhaps for each step, the probability that S_k is a new maximum is equal to the probability that the walk hasn't returned to any previous position. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the expected number of new maxima up to time n is approximately c*n, where c is some constant. Then, since R_n is the number of distinct values, which would be roughly the number of new maxima plus the number of new minima. But since the walk has a positive drift, the number of new minima would be negligible compared to new maxima.

Wait, but the walk can't go too far below zero because it's drifting upwards. So the number of new minima would be limited. For example, once the walk reaches a new maximum, it's less likely to go back far enough to create a new minimum. So perhaps the range R_n is dominated by the number of new maxima.

If that's the case, then the expected number of new maxima up to time n is roughly c*n, so R_n would be approximately c*n, and the limit would be c.

So what's c? It would be the probability that each new step is a new maximum. In the asymmetric case, I think this probability approaches a constant as n increases.

Wait, for a random walk starting at 0, the probability that S_1 is a new maximum is 1. For S_2, the probability that it's higher than S_1 is p, since to have S_2 > S_1, the second step must be +1, which happens with probability 0.8.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because S_2 = S_1 + X_2. So for S_2 to be a new maximum, S_2 must be greater than S_1, which requires X_2=+1. So the probability that S_2 is a new maximum is p=0.8.

Similarly, for S_3, the probability that S_3 > max(S_1, S_2). But this becomes more complicated because it depends on the previous steps.

Wait, perhaps the probability that S_k is a new maximum is equal to p^k or something, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a constant for each step after some point.

Wait, perhaps in the limit as k becomes large, the probability that S_k is a new maximum approaches some constant c. If that's the case, then the expected number of new maxima up to n would be approximately c*n, and thus R_n would be approximately c*n, so the limit would be c.

So the problem reduces to finding c, the limiting probability that each new step is a new maximum.

In the asymmetric random walk with drift to the right, I think this probability c is equal to p, the probability of moving right. But wait, that doesn't make sense because as the walk progresses, the steps to the right don't always result in new maxima.

Wait, no. Because even if you go right, if you've gone further right before, then it's not a new maximum. So the probability that S_k is a new maximum is actually the probability that the walk hasn't returned to the previous maximum before step k.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this as a Markov chain where each state is the current maximum. But that might get complicated.

Alternatively, I recall that for a transient random walk (like this one with p > 0.5), the number of new records (new maxima) that the walk achieves up to time n grows linearly with n. The constant is given by 1 - (q/p), where q is the probability of moving left.

Wait, in our case, p=0.8, q=0.2. So 1 - (q/p) = 1 - (0.2/0.8) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. So the expected number of new maxima up to time n is approximately 0.75n, so the limit of E[R_n]/n would be 0.75, which is 0.75, so the answer would be 0.75. But looking at the options, 0.8 is option E, 0.6 is I, 0.75 isn't listed. Wait, the options are A:1.0, B:0.5, C:1.2, D:1.6, E:0.8, F:0.9, G:1.4, H:0.2, I:0.6, J:0.4.

Wait, 0.75 isn't among the options. Hmm. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the expected number of new maxima is p, so 0.8, which would be option E. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The range R_n is the number of distinct S_k's. Each time the walk moves to a new maximum, it increases the range. Similarly, each time it moves to a new minimum, it also increases the range, but since the drift is positive, new minima become less frequent as n increases.

So perhaps the main contribution to R_n comes from the new maxima. So if the expected number of new maxima up to n is c*n, then R_n is approximately c*n, and the limit is c.

So what's c? Well, for a random walk with p > 0.5, the probability that the walk ever reaches a new maximum at each step tends to a constant. From some references I recall, for an asymmetric random walk on integers, the expected number of new maxima up to time n is approximately (1 - ρ)n, where ρ is the correlation between steps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: In a right-drifting random walk, the number of times the walk reaches a new maximum is a Bernoulli process with probability approaching p. So the expected number of new maxima up to n would be roughly p*n. So in our case, p=0.8, so the limit would be 0.8, which is option E.

But wait, earlier I thought it was 1 - (q/p) = 0.75. Hmm, conflicting ideas here. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of new maxima up to time n is n*(p - q) = n*(0.8 - 0.2) = 0.6n. Then the limit would be 0.6, which is option I. But that doesn't seem right because p - q is the drift per step, but I'm not sure if that directly translates to the number of new maxima.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the expected change in the maximum. Each time the walk takes a step to the right, it might set a new maximum. The probability that a step to the right sets a new maximum depends on whether the previous maximum was at the current position minus one. Hmm, maybe it's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the concept from the theory of records. In a sequence of independent random variables, the expected number of records (new maxima) up to time n is the harmonic series, which grows like log n. But that's for i.i.d. variables, not for a random walk.

Wait, no, for a random walk, the situation is different because each step depends on the previous position. So the number of new maxima isn't the same as in the i.i.d. case.

Wait, perhaps I can model the expected number of new maxima as the sum over k=1 to n of the probability that S_k is greater than all previous S_j's.

In the case of a random walk with positive drift, this probability for each k tends to a constant as k increases. Specifically, for a right-drifting walk, the probability that S_k is
