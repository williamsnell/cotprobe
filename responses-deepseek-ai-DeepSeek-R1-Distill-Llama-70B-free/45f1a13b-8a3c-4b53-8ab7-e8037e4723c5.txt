Okay, so I've got this question about the free induction decay and T2 relaxation time. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from my notes. 

Alright, the question says the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial intensity after 1.0 second. And Ω is zero, which I think means that the frequency offset isn't a factor here, so it's just about the relaxation. 

Wait, free induction decay (FID) is related to T2, right? Because FID is the signal we observe after a pulse, and T2 is the spin-spin relaxation time. The decay is exponential, so the formula should involve an exponential function.

The general formula for the amplitude of FID as a function of time is something like M(t) = M0 * e^(-t/T2), where M0 is the initial amplitude. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes I've seen it written as e^(-2t/T2) or something. No, wait, no, I think it's just e^(-t/T2). Because T2 is the time constant for the decay to 1/e of the initial value. 

So the problem says that after t = 1.0 s, the amplitude is 25% of the initial. So M(t)/M0 = 0.25. 

Plugging into the equation: 0.25 = e^(-t/T2). We know t is 1.0 s. So let's solve for T2.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides. ln(0.25) = -t/T2. 

Hmm, ln(0.25) is the same as ln(1/4), which is ln(1) - ln(4) = 0 - ln(4) = -ln(4). So ln(0.25) = -1.386 approximately. 

So substituting: -1.386 ≈ - (1.0)/T2. 

The negatives on both sides cancel out, so 1.386 ≈ 1.0 / T2. 

Solving for T2: T2 ≈ 1.0 / 1.386 ≈ 0.721 seconds. Wait, that's like option D, which says 0.721 s. 

Wait, but wait a second. I'm getting confused. Because sometimes, I've heard that FID is governed by T2*, which includes inhomogeneous broadening, but the question says Ω is zero, so maybe that term is zero. So in that case, T2* would equal T2. So yeah, the calculation I did should be correct. 

So the answer should be D: 0.721 s. 

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. If M(t) = M0 e^(-t/T2), then yes. Let me plug in T2 as 0.721 s and see if it works. 

At t=1.0, e^(-1/0.721) ≈ e^(-1.386) ≈ 0.25, which matches the question. So yes, that's correct. 

So looking at the options, option D is 0.721 s. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the value of \( T_2 \), we use the exponential decay formula for the amplitude of free induction decay (FID):

\[
M(t) = M_0 e^{-t/T_2}
\]

The problem states that the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial value after \( t = 1.0 \, \text{s} \), so:

\[
\frac{M(t)}{M_0} = 0.25
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
0.25 = e^{-t/T_2}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.25) = -\frac{t}{T_2}
\]

Since \( \ln(0.25) = \ln(1/4) = -\ln(4) \approx -1.386 \), we have:

\[
-1.386 = -\frac{1.0}{T_2}
\]

Canceling the negatives:

\[
1.386 = \frac{1.0}{T_2}
\]

Solving for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 = \frac{1.0}{1.386} \approx 0.721 \, \text{s}
\]

Thus, the value of \( T_2 \) is approximately \( 0.721 \, \text{s} \), which corresponds to option D.
