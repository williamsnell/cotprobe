Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about a single throw of a single die, and I need to find the probability of getting either a 2 or a 5. The options are from A to I, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that a standard die has six faces, each numbered from 1 to 6. So when you throw it once, there are six possible outcomes, each equally likely if the die is fair. That makes sense because each face should have the same chance of landing face up.

Now, the question is asking for the probability of getting either a 2 or a 5. So I think this is about mutually exclusive events because getting a 2 and getting a 5 can't happen at the same time in a single throw. So I should be able to add their individual probabilities.

Let me break it down. The probability of rolling a 2 is 1 out of 6 because there's only one 2 on the die. Similarly, the probability of rolling a 5 is also 1 out of 6. So if I want either of these two outcomes, I should add these probabilities together.

So adding them, 1/6 + 1/6 equals 2/6. Wait, but 2/6 can be simplified, right? Dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives me 1/3. So the probability should be 1/3.

Looking at the options provided, option E is 1/3. So that must be the correct answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The die has six sides, two favorable outcomes (2 and 5), so 2 divided by 6 is indeed 1/3. Yep, that seems right.

The probability of obtaining either a 2 or a 5 in a single throw of a die is calculated by noting there are two favorable outcomes (2 and 5) out of six possible outcomes. Thus, the probability is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3. 

The correct answer is E: 1/3.

E
