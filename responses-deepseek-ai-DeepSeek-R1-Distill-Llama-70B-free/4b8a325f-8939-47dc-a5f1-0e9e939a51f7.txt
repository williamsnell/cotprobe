Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state)."

Okay, I need to figure out why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861. Let me think about what I know about this period.

From what I remember, Lincoln was the President during the Civil War, and the Radical Republicans were a faction within his own party that had stronger views on slavery and Reconstruction. They wanted more immediate and drastic action against slavery and the South.

In 1861, the Civil War had just started. I think Lincoln's initial goal was to preserve the Union, not necessarily to abolish slavery right away. The Emancipation Proclamation came later, in 1863, which was a war measure. But before that, the Radicals were pushing for immediate emancipation.

Wait, the question is about 1861. So maybe the issue was that Lincoln wasn't moving fast enough on ending slavery. The Radicals wanted slavery abolished immediately, but Lincoln's approach was more cautious. He might have been trying to keep border states in the Union, so he didn't want to push for abolition too quickly, which could have driven those states to join the Confederacy.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Emancipation without congressional oversight. But the Emancipation Proclamation was in 1863, and it was a presidential proclamation, so maybe that's a point. But the question is about 1861, so I don't think this is the right time frame.

Option B: Disapproved of handling the war. I'm not sure about that. I think Lincoln's military strategy was a point of contention, but the main issue was slavery and Reconstruction policies.

Option C: Lincoln's stance on Union expansion. I'm not certain. Maybe expansion wasn't the main issue here. It was more about dealing with the existing states and slavery.

Option D: Radicals wanted immediate emancipation, Lincoln refused. This sounds plausible because I remember that Radicals were pushing for freeing all slaves from the start, while Lincoln took a more gradual approach or waited until 1863.

Option E: Suspension of habeas corpus. That was a controversial move, but I'm not sure if that was the main reason Radicals opposed him. I think it was more about slavery policy.

Option F: Andrew Johnson as VP. That was in 1865, after Lincoln's re-election, so not relevant to 1861.

Option G: Too sympathetic to Confederacy. I don't think that's right. Lincoln was against the Confederacy, but maybe the Radicals thought he wasn't harsh enough in his policies towards them.

Option H: Refusal to impose harsher punishments. This could be related, but I think the main issue was about ending slavery, not the punishments.

Option I: Against Lincoln's reintegration plan. His plan was the 10% plan, but that came later, in 1863-64. But the opposition in 1861 would be before that.

Option J: Ten Percent Plan lacked black suffrage. That's about Reconstruction, which comes after the war, so maybe 1864 or later. So in 1861, that wasn't the issue yet.

So, putting it together, the main issue in 1861 was that Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation, and Lincoln wasn't moving fast enough. So the best answer would be D: They wanted immediate emancipation but Lincoln refused.

Wait, but another thought. I remember that Lincoln's plan was more about preserving the Union, and he didn't make slavery the main issue at first. The Radicals were pushing for immediate action on slavery, so maybe that's why they opposed him. So yes, D makes sense.

The Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861 primarily because they wanted immediate emancipation of all slaves, while Lincoln's approach was more cautious. At the time, Lincoln's focus was on preserving the Union, and he avoided pushing for immediate abolition to prevent border states from joining the Confederacy. This cautious approach clashed with the Radicals' desire for swift and decisive action against slavery. Among the options provided, the best explanation is:

D: The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.

Answer: D
