Question:

Algae may be microscopic single-celled organisms or enormousmulticellularseaweeds hundreds of feet long. The body of one of these organisms is termed athallus. How does athallusdiffer from a plant body?

Options:

A: A plant body shows differentiation of parts, with its roots, stems, and leaves all varying greatly in structure and in function. Multicellular algae show very little, if any, tissue differentiation.
B: Algae have a more complex structure than plants
C: A thallus has a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, which is absent in plant cells
D: A thallus consists of a single layer of cells, unlike the multilayered tissues of plants
E: Algae possess true flowers and seeds, which differentiates them from plants
F: Algae cells are much smaller than plant cells
G: Algae have vascular systems similar to plants for transporting nutrients
H: Algae bodies are typically organized into root-like, stem-like, and leaf-like structures
I: Algae are capable of photosynthesis while plants are not
J: Algae perform cellular respiration, while plants only perform photosynthesis

Okay, so I've got this question about algae and plants. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking how an algal thallus differs from a plant body. Hmm, I remember that algae can be single-celled or multicellular, like seaweeds. The term thallus refers to their body structure.

I think plants have more complex structures. They have roots, stems, and leaves, right? And each of these parts is specialized. Roots for absorbing water, stems for support and transport, and leaves for photosynthesis. This specialization probably means that plants have tissues that are differentiated into different functions.

Algae, on the other hand, might not have such distinct parts. So their thallus is probably less differentiated. I've heard that even when algae are multicellular, they don't form true tissues like plants do. So the thallus is more of a simple structure without specialized tissues.

Looking at the options, option A says that plant bodies show differentiation with roots, stems, leaves, and algae show very little. That sounds right because plants have more complex structures. Option B says algae are more complex, which doesn't make sense. I know plants are more complex.

Option C mentions a rigid cell wall. Both algae and plants have cell walls, so that's probably not the difference. Option D says thallus is single layer, but I think some algae are multicellular but still not multilayered like plant tissues. Wait, plants have multi-layered tissues, but some algae might have multiple layers too. Not sure about that.

Option E talks about flowers and seeds. Algae don't have those; plants do. But the question is about the thallus vs plant body structure, not reproductive parts. So E might not be the right answer here.

Option F is about cell size. I don't think that's the main difference. Option G mentions vascular systems. Plants have xylem and phloem for transport, but algae don't have vascular tissues. So G is incorrect because it says algae have similar systems, which they don't.

Option H says algae have root-like structures, but I don't think they do. They might have structures that look similar, but not organized into roots, stems, etc. Option I is wrong because both algae and plants do photosynthesis. Option J is also wrong because both do cellular respiration.

So circling back, the main difference is the differentiation of tissues. Plant bodies have specialized parts, while algae (even multicellular ones) have a thallus without such differentiation. So option A should be the correct answer.

The correct answer is:

A: A plant body shows differentiation of parts, with its roots, stems, and leaves all varying greatly in structure and in function. Multicellular algae show very little, if any, tissue differentiation.
