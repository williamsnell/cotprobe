Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the declining-balance method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the Five Star Hotel spent $3,000 on carpeting that's supposed to last five years. The accountant wants to use the declining-balance method. I need to find the depreciation for the second year.

Wait, I remember that depreciation methods spread the cost of an asset over its useful life. The straight-line method is pretty straightforward, where you divide the cost by the life. But declining-balance is different because it's an accelerated method, meaning more depreciation in the early years and less later on.

So, the key here is to find the depreciation rate. For declining-balance, the formula for the rate is 1 minus the nth root of the salvage value over the cost. But wait, in this case, the problem doesn't mention salvage value. Oh, right, sometimes when it's not given, it's assumed to be zero. Or maybe I should think again. Wait, no, the declining balance method doesn't necessarily require a salvage value because the book value could be zero at the end, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the standard declining-balance method is calculated with a rate that's twice the straight-line rate. Because straight-line for 5 years is 1/5, so 20%. Declining balance would be 40%, which is 2 times 20%. So the rate is 40% each year.

But wait, I think the formula for the depreciation each year is the current book value multiplied by the depreciation rate. So for year one, it's $3,000 * 40% = $1,200. The book value then becomes $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800.

In the second year, we multiply the new book value by 40%. So $1,800 * 40% = $720. That should be the depreciation for the second year.

Let me double-check. First year: 3000 * 0.4 = 1200. Second year: 1800 * 0.4 = 720. Yes, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option H is $720. So the answer should be H.

To calculate the depreciation for the second year using the declining-balance method, we start by determining the depreciation rate. For an asset with a useful life of five years, the straight-line rate is \( \frac{1}{5} = 20\% \). Since the declining-balance method uses twice the straight-line rate, the depreciation rate is \( 2 \times 20\% = 40\% \).

Next, we calculate the depreciation for each year:

1. **First Year Depreciation**:  
   \( \$3,000 \times 40\% = \$1,200 \).  
   The book value at the end of the first year is:  
   \( \$3,000 - \$1,200 = \$1,800 \).

2. **Second Year Depreciation**:  
   \( \$1,800 \times 40\% = \$720 \).

Thus, the depreciation for the second year is \$720. Among the given options, the correct answer is **H**.

Answer: H
