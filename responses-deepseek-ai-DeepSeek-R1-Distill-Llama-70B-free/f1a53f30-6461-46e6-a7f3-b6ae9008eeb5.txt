Okay, so I have this question about scheduling jobs on a single processor to minimize the average completion time. Hmm, I remember that there's a specific algorithm for this. Oh right, I think it's the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm. Because scheduling the shortest jobs first should lead to lower average completion times.

So the question gives five jobs with service times: 25, 15, 5, 3, and 2 units. I need to arrange them in the order that would give the minimum average completion time.

Wait, let me think about how the completion times work. Completion time for each job is the time when it finishes. So if I process the jobs in order of increasing service time, the completion times should add up to a smaller total, which would then make the average lower.

So first, I should sort the jobs from shortest to longest. Let's list the service times: 2, 3, 5, 15, 25. That's the order they'll be processed in.

Now, I need to calculate the completion time for each. Let's go step by step.

The first job is 2. It starts at time 0 and finishes at 2. So its completion time is 2.

The next job is 3. It starts right after the first job finishes, so at time 2. It takes 3 units, so it finishes at 2 +3 =5. Completion time is 5.

Third job is 5. It starts at 5 and takes 5 units, so finishes at 10. Completion time is 10.

Fourth job is 15. It starts at 10, takes 15, so finishes at 25. Completion time is 25.

Last job is 25. Starts at 25, takes 25, finishes at 50. Completion time 50.

Now I need to compute the average of these completion times. Let's add them up:

2 +5=7, plus10 is 17, plus25 is 42, plus50 is 92. Wait, 2+5 is 7, plus 10 is 17, plus 25 is 42? Wait, 17 plus 25 is 42? Oh wait, no, 17 +25 is 42? Wait, 17+25 is 42? Hmm, 17 plus 20 is 37, plus 5 is 42, yeah. Then 42 plus 50 is 92. So the sum is 92.

Since there are 5 jobs, the average is 92 /5. Let me compute that: 5*18=90, so 92/5 is 18.4, which is 18 and 2/5, or 92/5.

Looking at the options, option G is 92/5, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the completion times.

First job: 2. Sum is 2.

Second: 5. Sum is 7.

Third: 10. Sum is 17.

Fourth: 25. Sum is 42 (17+25=42? Oh wait, 17+25 is 42? 17 +25=42? No, 17+25 is 42? Wait, 17+20 is 37, plus 5 is 42, yes. Then the last job's completion is 50. So 42 +50 =92. Yep, that's correct.

So the average is 92/5, which is option G. So the answer should be G.

To determine the minimum value of the average completion time for the given jobs, we use the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. The service times of the jobs are 25, 15, 5, 3, and 2. Sorting these in ascending order gives the processing sequence: 2, 3, 5, 15, 25.

Next, we calculate the completion times for each job:

1. The first job (2 units) finishes at time 2.  
   Completion time = 2.

2. The second job (3 units) starts at time 2 and finishes at time 2 + 3 = 5.  
   Completion time = 5.

3. The third job (5 units) starts at time 5 and finishes at time 5 + 5 = 10.  
   Completion time = 10.

4. The fourth job (15 units) starts at time 10 and finishes at time 10 + 15 = 25.  
   Completion time = 25.

5. The fifth job (25 units) starts at time 25 and finishes at time 25 + 25 = 50.  
   Completion time = 50.

The total completion time is the sum of these values:  
\[
2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 92
\]

The average completion time is the total completion time divided by the number of jobs:  
\[
\text{Average completion time} = \frac{92}{5} = 18.4
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **G: 92/5**.
