Okay, so I have this problem about gasoline evaporation, and I need to find out how long it takes for the gasoline to evaporate into still dry air. Hmm, let me think about what I know about evaporation and diffusion.

The problem gives me four gallons of gasoline poured over a 20 square foot area. The diffusivity D_AB is 6.5 ft²/hr. The evaporation occurs through a 6-inch film at 65°F. The vapor pressure is 2 psia. I need to find the time for evaporation.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact equations here. I think evaporation can be modeled using diffusion principles, maybe Fick's law? But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall. Oh right, evaporation of a liquid into a gas can be treated as a diffusion process where the concentration gradient drives the mass transfer.

But wait, the problem mentions a film. Oh, right, the film theory! In that case, the evaporation is through a thin film, and the model assumes that the concentration gradient is linear across this film. So I think the formula would involve the diffusivity, the film thickness, and maybe some concentration terms.

The formula for the rate of diffusion (or mass transfer) in a film is probably something like N = (D_AB * (C1 - C2) * A) / δ, where δ is the film thickness. But wait, that's for steady-state mass transfer. But in this case, we're looking at the time-dependent evaporation of a certain volume. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, I remember that when a liquid is spread out and evaporates, the evaporation time can be estimated using the formula t = (L²)/(D * π²), where L is the thickness of the liquid layer. Wait, that sounds familiar. Or is that for the time it takes for diffusion to occur over a distance L?

Wait, another thought: The evaporation process can be considered as the time it takes for the gas to diffuse through the film. The film thickness here is 6 inches, which is 0.5 feet. So maybe L is 0.5 feet. Then the time t would be (L^2)/(D * π^2). Let me check this.

So if L is 0.5 ft, then L squared is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 ft². D is 6.5 ft²/hr. Pi squared is about 9.87. So t = 0.25 / (6.5 * 9.87).

Wait, let's calculate that. 6.5 times 9.87 is approximately 64.055. So 0.25 divided by 64.055 is about 0.0039 hours. That seems way too small, like a fraction of a minute. But that can't be right because the options are in hours, like 2.5 to 14 hours.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me think again. Maybe the evaporation is limited by the diffusion of the vapor through the air film.

Wait another approach: The evaporation can be considered as the time it takes for the entire volume of liquid to vaporize, considering the rate of mass transfer.

The mass of gasoline can be found using the volume and density. But wait, I don't have the density of gasoline. Oh, but maybe I don't need that because the problem provides vapor pressure, which relates to the concentration.

Alternatively, I think the relevant formula for the time of evaporation when the liquid is a thin film is t = (pi * L^2 * V) / (4 * D * A), where V is the molar volume and A is the area. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the penetration depth in diffusion. The average distance a molecule travels in time t is proportional to sqrt(D*t). So maybe the time it takes for the vapor to diffuse through the film is when this distance equals the film thickness.

Wait, but this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to find the correct formula. Oh, right, for the evaporation of a liquid into a gas, the time to evaporate can be estimated by the formula:

t = (δ²) / (D * (pi^2 / 4))

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is t = (4 * δ²) / (pi * D), or something like that. Alternatively, I think the time to completely evaporate a film of thickness δ is t = (δ²)/(D * (π²/4)) ), which comes from considering the diffusion as a one-dimensional process with the concentration gradient.

Wait, let me think about the solution to Fick's second law for a slab. The time to reach a certain concentration profile would relate to the diffusion time scale. The characteristic time for diffusion is (δ^2)/(D), but with a constant factor based on geometry.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is t = (δ²)/(D * (π²/4)), which would be (4 δ²)/(π² D). Let me compute that.

δ is 0.5 ft. So δ squared is 0.25 ft². D is 6.5 ft²/hr. So (4 * 0.25) / (9.8696 * 6.5) = (1) / (64.0824) ≈ 0.0156 hours. Wait, that's about 0.9376 minutes, which is about 56 seconds. That seems way too short, so that can’t be right either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the formula is t = (δ²)/(D * (π²/8)) ), or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach uses the concept of evaporation rate as a function of the vapor pressure and other factors.

Wait, another approach. The rate of evaporation (m_dot) can be found using m_dot = (P_vapor * A) / (R * T) * sqrt(D / (pi * t))), perhaps? I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the molar flux.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the evaporation time of a volatile liquid. The formula is t = (s^2)/(D * alpha), where s is the initial film thickness and alpha is a constant based on boundary conditions. Alternatively, for a liquid evaporating into a semi-infinite medium, the time to evaporate a film of thickness δ would involve the solution to the diffusion equation with moving boundary conditions.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the time to evaporate a volume of liquid considering the surface area, diffusivity, and film thickness.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the time constant for diffusion. The time constant is (δ^2)/(D). So t = δ^2/(D). But with δ = 0.5 ft, that would be (0.5)^2 /6.5 = 0.25/6.5 ≈ 0.0385 hours, which is about 2.31 minutes. Still too short.

Wait, but the problem gives the volume as four gallons. Maybe I need to convert that to a film thickness. Oh, wait! Four gallons spread over 20 square feet. So the volume is 4 gallons, and the area is 20 ft². So the initial film thickness would be volume/area.

But wait, the film is already given as 6 inches, which is 0.5 ft. So maybe that's the film thickness. So perhaps the 6 inches is the thickness of the gasoline layer, so I don't need to calculate it. So the effective film thickness is 0.5 ft.

Wait, going back. The diffusivity is given as D_AB = 6.5 ft²/hr. The film thickness δ is 0.5 ft.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the time to fully evaporate a film is t = (δ^2)/(D * (π²/4)), as I thought earlier.

So let's compute that.

delta squared is 0.5^2 = 0.25.

Multiply by 4: 0.25 *4 = 1.

Divide by D (6.5) and pi squared (approx 9.8696):

t = (1) / (6.5 * 9.8696) → 1/(64.083) ≈ 0.0156 hours.

No, that's 0.0156 *60 ≈ 0.94 minutes. That can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is t = (delta^2) / (D * (pi^2)).

So 0.25 / (6.5 * 9.8696) → 0.25 / 64.083 ≈ 0.0039 hours, which is even smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach entirely.

Wait, maybe the correct formula uses the square root of time. Let me think of the evaporation rate.

Wait, I think when a liquid is evaporating into a quiescent gas, the time to completely evaporate can be estimated by t = (s^2)/(D) * (1/(pi^2)) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the mass transfer rate. The rate of evaporation would be proportional to the concentration gradient across the film.

Wait, the mass flux (J) is given by J = D * (C1 - C2)/delta, where C1 is the concentration at the surface (saturation) and C2 is the concentration in the bulk (dry air, so zero). So J = D * C1 / delta.

But the total mass to be evaporated is the mass of four gallons of gasoline. So the time would be mass divided by rate.

Wait, that sounds promising. Let me try that.

So first, find the mass of four gallons of gasoline. But I don't know the density. Wait, gasoline's density is around 6-7 pounds per gallon. Let's say 6.2 lb/gal. So 4 gallons would be 4 * 6.2 = 24.8 pounds. Wait, but actually, let me check: I think gasoline is about 6 pounds per gallon, so 4 gallons is 24 pounds.

But wait, in terms of moles, maybe. Because concentration might be in molar terms. Hmm, that complicates things because I don't have the molar mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the mass transfer rate in terms of volume.

Wait, maybe another approach. The molar flux (in mol/(ft²·hr)) is J = D * (C1 - C2)/delta. Since C2 is zero (dry air), J = D * C1 / delta.

The total moles of gasoline is mass / molar mass. But without knowing the molar mass, maybe I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the vapor pressure can help. Vapor pressure P is related to concentration via the ideal gas law. C = P/(R T). So C1 is P/(R T).

Wait, so C1 = P / (R T). Let me compute that.

P is given as 2 psia. R is the gas constant. Wait, in units that match, let's see. R for air is approximately 53.35 ft·lb/(mol·R). Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, R could be 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Or perhaps I should convert units carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert P to units that match the concentration in lbmol per cubic foot.

So, P is 2 psia. Let's convert that to lb per square foot: 1 psi = 144 psf, so 2 psia = 288 lb/ft².

The gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). But the temperature is 65°F, which is 65 + 459.67 = 524.67 R.

So, using the ideal gas law PV = nRT → C (n/V) = P/(R T).

So C = P/(R T) = (288 lb/ft²) / (10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 524.67 R).

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, P is 2 psia = 288 lb/ft².

R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

T is 65°F = 524.67 R.

So C = (288 lb/ft²) / (10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 524.67 R).

Wait, the units: psi is lb/ft², so 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) becomes (lb/ft²)*ft³/(lbmol·R) )= lb/(ft²) * ft³/(lbmol R) )= lb*ft/(lbmol R) )= ft/(lbmol R).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the numerical value.

C = (288) / (10.7316 * 524.67) → let's compute denominator: 10.7316 * 524.67 ≈ 10.7316 * 500 = 5365.8, plus 10.7316 *24.67 ≈ 264. So total ≈ 5365.8 + 264 ≈ 5629.8.

So C ≈ 288 / 5629.8 ≈ 0.05116 lbmol/ft³.

So C1 is approximately 0.05116 lbmol/ft³.

Now, the molar flux J is D * C1 / delta.

Wait, D is given as 6.5 ft²/hr. So J = (6.5 ft²/hr) * (0.05116 lbmol/ft³) / (0.5 ft).

Wait, delta is 0.5 ft. So J = (6.5 * 0.05116) / 0.5 = (0.33364) / 0.5 = 0.66728 lbmol/(ft²·hr).

Now, the total moles to be evaporated is n = mass / molar mass.

Wait, but we have four gallons of gasoline, which is 24 pounds (if 6 lb/gal). The molar mass of gasoline is roughly around 100-120 g/mol, but let's take 105 g/mol as an average. So 24 pounds is 24 * 453.592 grams = 10,886.368 grams. Moles = 10,886.368 / 105 ≈ 103.7 lbmol.

Wait, wait: 1 lb is 453.592 grams. So 24 lb = 24 * 453.592 = 10,886.368 grams. Molar mass is 105 g/mol, so moles = 10,886.368 / 105 ≈ 103.7 moles. Wait, but that can't be right because 103.7 lbmol is way too high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 lb = 453.592 grams, correct. So 24 lb = 24 * 453.592 = 10,886.368 grams. Molar mass of gasoline varies, but let's say it's about 120 g/mol. So moles = 10,886.368 / 120 ≈ 90.7 moles. So 90.7 lbmol? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 lbmol is 454 grams per mole? No, wait, no: 1 lb is 453.592 grams. So 1 lbmol is 453.592 grams per mole. So molar mass in lb/mol would be 0.120 lb/mol (since 120 g/mol is 0.120 lb/mol).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with units. Let me try a different approach.

The mass of gasoline is 24 lb (4 gallons * 6 lb/gal). The molar mass M is about 120 g/mol, which is 0.120 lb/mol (because 120 g = 0.2646 lb, wait no, 120 g is 0.2646 lb? Wait, 1 lb is 453.592 grams. So 120 g is 120/453.592 lb ≈ 0.2646 lb. So molar mass M = 0.120 lb/mol? No, wait, wait: molar mass is grams per mole, so 120 g/mol is 120/453.592 lb/mol ≈ 0.2646 lb/mol.

So moles n = mass / M = 24 lb / 0.2646 lb/mol ≈ 90.7 mol. Wait, but 90 moles is 90 lbmol? No, wait, moles and lbmol are different units. 1 lbmol is 453.592 moles. So 90 moles is 90 / 453.592 ≈ 0.1984 lbmol.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me clarify.

n (lbmol) = mass (lb) / M (lb/lbmol). M is 0.120 lb/lbmol (since 120 g/mol = 0.2646 lb/lbmol? Wait, no, wait: 120 g/mol is 0.2646 lb per lbmol.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert the mass to grams. 24 lb = 24 * 453.592 g ≈ 10,886 g. Molar mass M = 120 g/mol. So moles n = 10,886 / 120 ≈ 90.7 moles.

But how to convert moles to lbmol? Since 1 lbmol is 453.592 moles, so 90.7 moles is 90.7 / 453.592 ≈ 0.2 lbmol.

So n ≈ 0.2 lbmol.

Now, the rate of evaporation is J * A, where J is in lbmol/(ft²·hr) and A is in ft².

So rate = J * A = 0.66728 lbmol/(ft²·hr) * 20 ft² = 13.3456 lbmol/hr.

So time t = n / rate = 0.2 lbmol / 13.3456 lbmol/hr ≈ 0.015 hours, which is 0.9 minutes. That can't be right because the options are much larger.

Wait, this can't be correct. I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Let me go back. Let's recheck the steps.

1. Calculate C1 using P = 2 psia. So C1 = P/(R T) = (2 psia) / (R * T). Wait, but earlier I converted P to lb/ft², which may not be necessary.

Wait, perhaps using R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), T in °R, P in psi.

So C
