Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of truth tables and argument validity. But I'll take it step by step.

The problem is to construct a complete truth table for the given argument and determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.

The argument is:
Premise 1: (G ≡ H) · ~I
Premise 2: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)
Conclusion: G

Wait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is a bit confusing. Oh, I see now. It's written as:

(G ≡ H) · ~I
~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)
Therefore, G

So the argument has two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is (G if and only if H) and not I. The second premise is not G or (not H or I). The conclusion is G.

I need to evaluate whether this argument is valid. An argument is valid if whenever all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If there's any situation where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that situation is a counterexample.

To do this, I'll construct a truth table that includes all possible truth values for G, H, and I. Since there are three variables, there will be 2^3 = 8 rows in the table.

Let me list the variables and their possible truth values:

Row 1: G=T, H=T, I=T
Row 2: G=T, H=T, I=F
Row 3: G=T, H=F, I=T
Row 4: G=T, H=F, I=F
Row 5: G=F, H=T, I=T
Row 6: G=F, H=T, I=F
Row 7: G=F, H=F, I=T
Row 8: G=F, H=F, I=F

Wait, actually, for the sake of the truth table, I should list all possible combinations systematically.

Now, for each row, I'll compute the truth values of each premise and the conclusion.

Let me break it down.

First, the first premise is (G ≡ H) · ~I.

(G ≡ H) is true when G and H have the same truth value. So for each row, I can compute G≡H as G<->H, which is equivalent to (G→H) ∧ (H→G). Then, ~I is the negation of I. So the first premise is true only when both (G≡H) is true and I is false.

Second premise is ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I). Let's parse that. ~H ∨ I is "not H or I". Then the entire second premise is "not G or (not H or I)". Alternatively, using associativity, it's equivalent to (~G) ∨ (~H) ∨ I.

The conclusion is simply G.

So, for each row, I'll compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

Let me start building the table.

Row 1:
G=T, H=T, I=T
G≡H: T
~I: F
So first premise: T ∧ F = F
Second premise: ~G (F) ∨ (~H (F) ∨ I (T)) → F ∨ (F ∨ T) → F ∨ T = T
Conclusion: G=T
So premises are F and T. Since both premises are not both true (first is F), this row doesn't satisfy the condition where all premises are true.

Row 2:
G=T, H=T, I=F
G≡H: T
~I: T
First premise: T ∧ T = T
Second premise: ~G (F) ∨ (~H (F) ∨ I (F)) → F ∨ (F ∨ F) = F
So second premise is F.
So both premises are T and F. So not all premises true. Doesn't apply.

Row 3:
G=T, H=F, I=T
G≡H: F
~I: F
First premise: F ∧ F = F
Second premise: ~G (F) ∨ (~H (T) ∨ I (T)) → F ∨ (T ∨ T) = T
So premises F and T. Not all true.

Row 4:
G=T, H=F, I=F
G≡H: F
~I: T
First premise: F ∧ T = F
Second premise: ~G (F) ∨ (~H (T) ∨ I (F)) → F ∨ (T ∨ F) = T
Premises F and T. Not all true.

Row 5:
G=F, H=T, I=T
G≡H: F
~I: F
First premise: F ∧ F = F
Second premise: ~G (T) ∨ (~H (F) ∨ I (T)) → T ∨ (F ∨ T) = T
Premises F and T. Not both true.

Row 6:
G=F, H=T, I=F
G≡H: F
~I: T
First premise: F ∧ T = F
Second premise: ~G (T) ∨ (~H (F) ∨ I (F)) → T ∨ (F ∨ F) = T
Premises F and T. Not all true.

Row 7:
G=F, H=F, I=T
G≡H: T
~I: F
First premise: T ∧ F = F
Second premise: ~G (T) ∨ (~H (T) ∨ I (T)) → T ∨ (T ∨ T) = T
Premises F and T. Not all true.

Row 8:
G=F, H=F, I=F
G≡H: T
~I: T
First premise: T ∧ T = T
Second premise: ~G (T) ∨ (~H (T) ∨ I (F)) → T ∨ (T ∨ F) = T
So both premises are T and T. So this is the only row where both premises are true. Now check the conclusion: G is F here.

Wait, that's a problem. Because when both premises are true, the conclusion is G=F. So the conclusion is false in this scenario. Therefore, the argument is invalid because there's a case where premises are true, but the conclusion is false. So the counterexample is when G=F, H=F, I=F.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations, because I might have made a mistake.

Looking at row 8 again:

G=F, H=F, I=F.

G≡H: Since both are F, G≡H is T.

~I: T.

So first premise: T * T = T.

Second premise: ~G is T, ~H is T, I is F. So ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is T ∨ (T ∨ F) which is T.

So both premises are T, conclusion G is F. So the argument is invalid because in this case, the premises are true but the conclusion is false.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option presents this counterexample.

The counterexample is when G=F, H=F, I=F. Let's look at the options.

Option C says: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and G are false. That matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A: H and G are true, I is false.

That's row 2. In that case, first premise is T, second premise is F. So both premises are not true. So that's not a counterexample because the premises aren't all true.

Option B: H and I are true, G is false. That's row 5. First premise F, second premise T. Not all true.

Option C: All false. That's the row we found.

Option D and E are valid, which isn't the case.

Option F: I true, H and G false. That's row 7. Premises F and T, so not all true.

Option G: G true, H and I false. Row 4. First premise F, second T. Not both T.

Option H: H true, I and G false. Row6. Premises F and T.

Option I: H false, I and G true. Row3. Premises F and T.

Option J: I false, H and G true. Row2. Premises T and F.

So only option C correctly identifies the counterexample where all G, H, I are false.

To determine the validity of the argument, we construct a truth table for the premises and conclusion:

1. **Premise 1**: \((G \equiv H) \cdot \neg I\)  
   - This is true only when \(G \equiv H\) (G and H have the same truth value) and \(\neg I\) (I is false).

2. **Premise 2**: \(\neg G \vee (\neg H \vee I)\)  
   - This simplifies to \(\neg G \vee \neg H \vee I\), which is true if at least one of \(\neg G\), \(\neg H\), or \(I\) is true.

3. **Conclusion**: \(G\)  
   - This is simply the truth value of \(G\).

We evaluate all possible truth values for \(G\), \(H\), and \(I\) (8 combinations). The argument is valid if, in every row where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there is any row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that row provides a counterexample.

### Truth Table Analysis:

  - Conclusion: \(T\)  
  - **Not a counterexample** (premises not both true).

- **Row 3**: \(G=T, H=F, I=T\)  
  - Premise 1: \(F\)  
  - Premise 2: \(T\)

- **Row 7**: \(G=F, H=F, I=T\)  
  - Premise 1: \(F\)  
  - Premise 2: \(T\)  
  - Conclusion: \(F\)  
  - **Not a counterexample** (premises not both true).

- **Row 8**: \(G=F, H=F, I=F\)  
  - Premise 1: \(T\)  
  - Premise 2: \(T\)  
  - Conclusion: \(F\)  
  - **Counterexample found**: Both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **invalid** because there is a counterexample where \(G=F\), \(H=F\), and \(I=F\). Among the options, only **Option C** correctly identifies this counterexample.

**Answer: C**
