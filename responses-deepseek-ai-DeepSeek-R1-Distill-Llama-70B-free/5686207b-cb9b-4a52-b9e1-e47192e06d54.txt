Okay, so I've got this question about life insurance premiums and benefits. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question is about Mr. Ozaku, who is 20 years old and took out a $5,000 ordinary life insurance policy. He pays a semiannual premium until he's 75. I need to find out how much he'll pay in total premiums and how much his beneficiary will get if he dies.

Wait, ordinary life insurance... I think that's also called whole life insurance. Right, whole life covers you for your entire life as long as premiums are paid. The policy has a death benefit and a cash value component. But the question is about the premiums paid and the amount the beneficiary receives.

So first, let's break down the time period. He starts at age 20 and pays until 75. That's 75 - 20 = 55 years. Since he's paying semiannually, that's twice a year. So the total number of payments is 55 * 2 = 110 payments. 

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, because if he starts paying at age 20, let me make sure about the exact number of years. From 20 to 75 inclusive? Let me think. If he makes the first payment at 20, and the last at 75, that's 55 years. So yes, 55 years times 2 is 110 payments. 

But wait, let me make sure. For example, if he pays at 20, that's the first payment, and then each six months. At 75, he's making the last payment. So yes, 55 years. So 110 payments. 

Now, the policy is for $5,000. So the death benefit is $5,000, right? Because that's what's stated in the policy. So the beneficiary would receive $5,000 if he dies, regardless of when, as long as the policy is active (premiums are paid).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes policies have increasing premiums, but I think in this case, it's a level premium. Because it's an ordinary life policy, which I think is whole life with level premiums. So each payment is the same amount.

But wait, the question is asking how much he will pay in premiums. So I need to calculate the total amount paid over time.

Wait, but the answer choices don't seem to require calculating the exact premium amount, because none of the options show a calculated total based on the premium rate. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps the semiannual premium is a fixed amount, let's say, and the question is just about the total payments.

Wait, wait, the question doesn't give the premium rate. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the question again.

Ah, wait. The question says he took out a $5,000 ordinary life policy. It doesn't give the premium amount. So perhaps the question is testing something else. Wait, the options have two numbers: total premiums paid and the death benefit.

Wait, in the question, the policy is $5,000. So the death benefit is $5,000. So the second part of the question is straightforward: the beneficiary receives $5,000.

Looking at the options, let me see which ones have the death benefit as $5,000.

Option A: $5k death benefit. Option D: $5k. Option I: $5k. Option E: $4,801.50? No, that's less. Option J: $5,750, higher. So possible options are A, D, I.

Wait, but Mr. Ozaku is paying until 75, so let's compute how much he pays in total. The question is, how much in total premiums does he pay?

Wait, but the problem is that the semiannual premium amount isn't given. So perhaps the question is assuming that the total premiums equal the death benefit? That can't be right, because with whole life insurance, you pay more than the death benefit over time because of the cash value accumulation.

Wait, but maybe the question is a trick. Because the policy is for $5,000, but the total premiums paid over 55 years would be more. But without knowing the premium amount, I can't calculate it. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about term life insurance, but the question says "ordinary life insurance". No, term life usually has lower premiums and no cash value. But in that case, the death benefit would be $5,000, but the total premiums would depend on the term and the rate.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the total premiums paid would be based on actuarial calculations, but without knowing the interest rate or the premium rate, I can't compute that. Therefore, perhaps the question is not about calculating the exact amount, but rather about understanding what the beneficiary receives.

Wait, but the death benefit is $5,000, as per the policy. So the second part of the question is $5k. So looking at the options, the correct answer must have the second number as $5,000.

Looking again, options A, D, and I have $5k as the second number. So the answer must be among these.

Now, the first part is the total premiums paid. Let's think: how much does he pay each time? If it's a $5k policy, perhaps the total premiums paid would be more than $5k because he's paying for 55 years.

Wait, but without the premium amount, how can we know? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the semiannual premium is such that the total paid equals a certain amount. Alternatively, perhaps the policy is a term life, but that's unlikely since it's called ordinary life.

Wait, perhaps the semiannual premium is calculated in a way that the total paid is the same as the death benefit. But that doesn't make sense because in whole life, the premiums are higher to build cash value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that Mr. Ozaku is purchasing the policy with a single premium, but that doesn't fit with paying semiannual premiums.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing whether the student knows that in life insurance, the total premiums paid are more than the death benefit. So the death benefit is $5k, so the options with $5k as the second number are A, D, I.

Now, looking at the total premiums paid. How much would he pay over 55 years, semiannually.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the premium is $100 per semiannual payment. But that's not given, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. Let me think again. The policy is $5,000. The beneficiary gets $5,000 upon death. So the second part is $5k. So options A, D, I.

Now for the first part: the total premiums paid. Let's compute the number of payments. From age 20 to 75 is 55 years. Each year has 2 payments, so 55 * 2 = 110 payments.

If each payment is, say, X dollars, then total is 110 * X.

But the question is multiple choice, and the options for the first part are varying. For example, option A is $7,000 total. So 7k divided by 110 payments would be roughly 63.64 per payment.

But without knowing the premium, I can't calculate that. So perhaps the question is not requiring us to compute the exact amount, but to know that the total paid is more than the death benefit. So looking at the options, the only options where the first number is higher than 5k are options A, B, G, J, etc.

Wait, but in the options, for A, D, and I, the first numbers are 7k, 5.5k, and 4.8k respectively.

Hmm, but 4.8k is less than 5k, which would mean he paid less in premiums than the death benefit, which doesn't make sense for a whole life policy. So option I is probably incorrect.

So between A and D.

Option A: 7k and 5k.

Option D: 5.5k and 5k.

So which one is correct? Well, without the premium amount, I can't compute, but perhaps in the context of the question, the total premium is the sum of all payments, which would be more than 5k. So 7k is more than 5k, and 5.5k is also more. So both A and D are possible.

Wait, but perhaps the question is a trick. Maybe he pays until age 75, but if he dies before that, the beneficiary gets the $5k. But the question is, how much will he pay in premiums? So if he lives until 75, he stops paying. So the total is 55 years of payments.

Wait, but in that case, if the policy is ordinary life, perhaps the premiums are paid until age 75, and then the policy might continue, but no, the policy is until death, so if he lives beyond 75, he stops paying but the policy remains.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering that the policy is paid-up at 75, meaning he stops paying, but the coverage continues. So the total premiums would be until 75.

So the total number of payments is 55 years * 2 = 110.

But again, without knowing the premium per period, I can't compute the total. Therefore, perhaps the question is designed so that the total premiums paid equal the death benefit, but that doesn't fit with whole life insurance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the policy is term life for a certain period, but the question says ordinary life, which is whole life.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that Mr. Ozaku is purchasing the policy with a single premium, but that's not the case here because he's paying semiannual premiums.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the question again.

"how much will he pay in premiums? If he dies, how much will his beneficiary receive?"

So the first part is total premiums paid during his lifetime until 75. The second is the death benefit, which is $5,000.

But without knowing the premium amount, I can't compute the total. So perhaps the question is using an example where the semiannual premium is such that the total paid is the same as the death benefit plus some amount.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the total premiums paid equal the face amount, but that can't be because in whole life, the total paid exceeds the death benefit.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick, and the total premiums paid are simply twice the number of years times the semiannual premium. But without knowing the premium, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but looking at the answer options, perhaps the correct answer is option I: $4,801.50 and $5,000. But wait, the total premiums would be 110 payments. So 4,801.50 / 110 is approximately 43.65 per payment. That seems low for a $5k policy, but maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that he pays a certain amount each time, and the total adds up to one of the options. But without the rate, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing the concept that in whole life insurance, the total premiums paid over time exceed the death benefit. So the death benefit is $5k, and the total premiums are higher.

Looking at the options, option D has total premiums of $5,500, which is higher than $5k, and death benefit of $5k. So that would make sense. Option A has $7k, which is also higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the policy's premiums are structured so that the total paid equals the death benefit plus some interest or something. But without more info, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option I, but that would mean the total paid is $4,801.50, which is less than the death benefit. That can't be right because in whole life insurance, the policyholder pays more than the death benefit over time.

So the only options where the first number is more than $5k are A, B, D, G, J.

Wait, but the question is from the perspective of a 20-year-old paying until 75. Let's think about how many payments that is. As before, 55 years, 110 payments.

So the total premiums paid would be 110 times the semiannual premium. But without knowing the premium, I can't calculate the exact amount. So perhaps the question expects me to remember that for an ordinary life insurance policy, the total premiums would be higher than the death benefit, so the correct option must have the first number higher than $5k.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 7k >5k, death benefit 5k. So possible.

Option D:5.5k>5k, death benefit 5k. Possible.

Option B:6,750>5k, death benefit 5,250. So the death benefit here is higher than the policy amount. Because the policy is $5k. So option B is wrong.

Similarly, option J has 5,750 as death benefit, which is higher than the policy's 5k. So J is incorrect.

Option G: death benefit 6,500, which is higher than 5k. So incorrect.

So the remaining options are A, D, E, H, I.

Wait, but E and I have lower total premiums than 5k, which I think is impossible for a whole life policy.

So now, the options are A and D.

So which one is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the question expects us to know that in a whole life policy, the total premiums paid would be significantly more than the death benefit. So 7k is more than 5k, making option A a possibility.

But perhaps the answer is option D, where the total is 5.5k, which is just 10% more. That seems lower than expected. I think whole life policies have higher premiums.

Wait, but let's think about the time factor. Paying for 55 years, so even a small premium adds up. For example, if the semiannual premium is $50, then 110 payments would be $5,500. Which is option D. So that would make sense.

So if each semiannual payment is $50, total is 110 x 50 =5,500. So the total premiums would be $5,500, and the death benefit is $5,000.

So the answer would be option D: $5,500 and $5,000.

But wait, I'm making an assumption here about the premium being $50 per payment. The question doesn't provide that number. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that he only pays until 75, and the policy's total premiums equal the death benefit. But that's not how whole life works.

Wait, but if the policy is for $5,000, and the total premiums are $5,500, that's only a 10% increase over 55 years. That seems low because usually, whole life insurance has higher premiums.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the policy is term life, but the question states it's ordinary life, which is whole life.

Hmm. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the question is testing the understanding that the death benefit is fixed at $5,000, and the total premiums paid are more than that. So in the options, the only ones where the first number is higher than 5k and the second is 5k are A and D.

Between those, perhaps option D is more realistic because 5.5k over 55 years would be lower per payment, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick where the total premiums equal the death benefit. But that's not possible because whole life insurance has higher premiums.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking about the death benefit, which is straightforward, but the total premiums are not computable without the rate, so perhaps the question is expecting that the death benefit is $5k, and the total premiums are $5k as well, but that's not an option except perhaps option I, but that's 4,801.50, which is less.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me summarize:

- Death benefit is $5k. So the correct answer must have the second number as 5k. So options A, D, I.

- Total premiums paid would be the semiannual payments over 55 years, which is 110 payments.

- Without the premium amount, I can't compute the exact total, but I can infer that it must be more than $5k.

So among A, D, and I:

- Option A: total 7k, death 5k.

- Option D: total 5.5k, death 5k.

- Option I: total 4.8k, death 5k.

Since I is less than 5k, it's unlikely. So between A and D.

I think the intended answer is D: $5,500 total premiums, $5k death benefit.

But wait, that would be paying $50 every six months for 55 years. 50*2=100 per year, 100*55=5,500. That seems plausible.

So I think the correct answer is D.
</think>

The question involves Mr. Ozaku, age 20, who took out a $5,000 ordinary life insurance policy and pays semiannual premiums until age 75. The task is to determine the total premiums he will pay and the death benefit his beneficiary will receive.

1. **Policy Type and Death Benefit**:  
   The policy is an "ordinary life insurance" policy, which is another term for whole life insurance. Whole life insurance provides a guaranteed death benefit as long as premiums are paid. The death benefit for this policy is explicitly stated as $5,000. Therefore, the beneficiary will receive $5,000 if Mr. Ozaku dies.

2. **Total Premiums Paid**:  
   Mr. Ozaku pays semiannual premiums from age 20 to age 75, which is a total of 55 years. Since he makes two payments per year, the total number of payments is:  
   \[
   55 \, \text{years} \times 2 \, \text{payments/year} = 110 \, \text{payments}.
   \]  
   However, the question does not provide the exact semiannual premium amount. To determine the total premiums paid, the semiannual premium would need to be multiplied by 110. Without this information, the total premiums cannot be calculated directly.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   The question provides multiple-choice options, and the correct answer must align with the following:  
   - The death benefit is $5,000.  
   - The total premiums paid must be greater than $5,000, as whole life insurance policies typically require total premiums to exceed the death benefit due to the cash value component and other factors
