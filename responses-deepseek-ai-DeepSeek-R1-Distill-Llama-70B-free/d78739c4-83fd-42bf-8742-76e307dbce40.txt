Question:

An adult feels himself becoming aroused when looking at a child and realizes that the response is totally inappropriate, as a result he feels anxiety rather than arousal. This is an example of __________ according to Walen and Roth's cognitive model of the sexual response.

Options:

A: cognitive arousal
B: negative perception
C: positive perception
D: positive arousal
E: cognitive coherence
F: negative arousal
G: positive evaluation
H: negative evaluation
I: negative dissonance
J: cognitive dissonance

Okay, so I have this psychology question in front of me about sexual response models. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an adult who feels aroused when looking at a child but realizes it's inappropriate, leading to anxiety instead of arousal. It's asking which concept from Walen and Roth's cognitive model this exemplifies.

I remember that Walen and Roth proposed a model where cognitive factors play a big role in sexual response. Their model includes things like perceptions, evaluations, and coherence.

So, in this scenario, the initial arousal is there, but the person recognizes it's wrong. So, their cognitive evaluation must be conflicting with their physical response. That sounds like some kind of cognitive dissonance maybe. Wait, cognitive dissonance is when there's a conflict between thoughts or beliefs, causing discomfort.

But let's break it down. The model probably has stages. First, perception: the person perceives a stimulus. Then evaluation: they assess whether that stimulus is sexually arousing and appropriate. If there's a mismatch, that might cause a problem.

Walen and Roth's model talks about cognitive-affective factors. If the cognitive evaluation is negative, it can override the physical arousal. So the person feels arousal but then evaluates it negatively, leading to anxiety.

Wait, what's the term for that? I think it's cognitive dissonance. But wait, in their model, maybe it's specifically called something else. Oh, right, they might use the term 'cognitive coherence'. Or maybe I'm mixing terms.

Wait, another term comes to mind: negative evaluation. Because the person is evaluating their arousal as negative. But the options don't have 'negative evaluation' as an answer; let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is cognitive arousal, B negative perception, C positive perception, D positive arousal, E cognitive coherence, F negative arousal, G positive evaluation, H negative evaluation, I negative dissonance, J cognitive dissonance.

So the options include H (negative evaluation) and J (cognitive dissonance). Now, what's the difference here.

In the scenario, the person feels arousal (positive) but then evaluates it as inappropriate, leading to anxiety. So the evaluation is negative. But the model might describe this as a conflict between arousal (positive) and evaluation (negative), leading to dissonance. Or perhaps it's simply a negative evaluation causing the anxiety.

Wait, I think in Walen and Roth's model, the sexual response cycle includes appraisal. If the person appraises the stimulus as inappropriate, that leads to a negative affect, which can inhibit arousal. So the key here is the evaluation step.

So in this case, after the initial arousal, the negative evaluation occurs, which then leads to anxiety. So the example is showing a negative evaluation overriding the arousal.

Looking at the options, H is negative evaluation. Alternatively, cognitive dissonance (J) is about conflicting cognitions. So the man has an aroused feeling but a negative thought about it, causing discomfort. That's dissonance between the two.

Wait, but which term is used in the model for this specific scenario. I'm trying to recall. Oh, I think Walen and Roth's model includes concepts like positive and negative evaluations. So when someone evaluates the sexual stimulus negatively, it leads to negative affect and decreased arousal. So the answer would be negative evaluation, option H.

Alternatively, if the model describes this as a coherence issue, like cognitive coherence (E), but I think that's when cognitions align. So in this case, the opposite is happeningâ€”dissonance. So perhaps J is the answer.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing different theories. I think another model, the one by Kaplan, includes desire, arousal, and orgasm. But Walen and Roth's is more cognitive. So in their model, if the cognitive evaluation is negative, it's called a negative evaluation, leading to anxiety.

So the correct term here is negative evaluation. So the answer should be H.

The question involves an adult experiencing arousal when looking at a child, followed by the realization that the response is inappropriate, leading to anxiety. This scenario is analyzed through the lens of Walen and Roth's cognitive model of sexual response, which emphasizes cognitive factors like perception, evaluation, and coherence.

In this case, the adult initially experiences arousal (a positive physical response) but then evaluates the situation as inappropriate, leading to a negative cognitive assessment. This conflict between the positive arousal and the negative evaluation creates discomfort, which aligns with the concept of **negative evaluation** in Walen and Roth's model. Negative evaluation occurs when a person cognitively assesses a stimulus as inappropriate or harmful, overriding the initial arousal and resulting in anxiety or inhibition.

While cognitive dissonance (option J) refers to a conflict between conflicting thoughts or beliefs, the specific term used in Walen and Roth's model for this scenario is **negative evaluation**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: negative evaluation

Answer: H
