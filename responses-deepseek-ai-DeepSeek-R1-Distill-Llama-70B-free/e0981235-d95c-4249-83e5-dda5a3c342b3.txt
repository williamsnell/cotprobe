Okay, so I've got this question about fatty acids in vegetable oils. Hmm, I remember from my biochemistry class that fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated, and when they're unsaturated, they have double bonds. The question is about polyunsaturated ones, which means more than one double bond.

The options give different numbers of carbon atoms and double bonds. Let me think. Vegetable oils are usually from plants, right? And I remember that they often have unsaturated fats. Like, olive oil has monounsaturated, but we're talking poly here.

Wait, the term is 'natural polyunsaturated fatty acids'. So these would have multiple double bonds. Poly means more than one, so at least two. Okay, so looking for options with at least two double bonds.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 22 carbons, two double bonds. I don't think vegetable oils have such long chains. They're usually 16-18 carbons maybe.

Option B: 20 carbons, two double bonds, trans. Wait, trans is more common in processed stuff, not natural. So probably not B.

Option C: 20 with one double bond. But the question is about poly, so at least two. So C is out.

Option D: 20 carbons, at least two, cis. Hmm, 20 seems a bit long. I thought vegetable oils are more like 18 carbons.

Option E: 18, at least two, cis. That sounds more right. Like linoleic acid maybe, which is 18 carbons and two double bonds.

Option F: 16, two. Maybe palmitic is 16, but that's saturated. Oh, but some have 16 with maybe one double bond, but not sure about poly.

Option G: 18, three cis. That's possible too. Linolenic acid has three, like in flaxseed oil.

Wait, the question says "polyunsaturated", which includes any number above one. So, the minimum is two, but some have three. The options include "at least two" or "three".

Looking back, the question is about what they "contain". So for vegetable oils, most have 18 carbons. Like, oleic acid is 18 with one double bond (mono), but we're talking poly here, which is two or more.

So, the options E has 18, at least two, cis. G has 18, three. So which is it?

Wait, the question is about the general case. Not all veg oils have three. Some have two, some have more. So the question says "contain", which implies the correct structure they have.

So each option is a possible answer, but the correct one must fit the general case.

So, natural polyunsaturated would have multiple double bonds, and in the cis configuration. Because naturally occurring usually have cis, while trans are more from hydrogenation.

So, looking again, option E is at least two, 18, cis. Option G is three, cis. But the question is about what the molecules contain. If some have two, some three, but all have at least two, then the correct option would be E or G.

Wait, the question is about what the molecules contain. So each molecule has a certain number. So, for example, linoleic acid has two double bonds, so its molecule has two. So if the question is about any polyunsaturated, then each molecule must have at least two.

So the correct options would have at least two, and 18 carbons.

Looking back, option E is 18, at least two, cis. Option G is three. So the correct choice would be E or G, but the question is about what they contain, not necessarily all of them.

Wait, the question says "molecules of natural polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils contain:"

So each molecule has what? If a molecule has two, then E is correct. If it has three, then G is correct. But the question doesn't specify the exact number, just that they are poly. So the answer must reflect that they have at least two, but the options are about what each molecule contains.

Wait, no, the options are about each molecule. So for a polyunsaturated fatty acid, each molecule has at least two double bonds.

So looking for 18 carbons and at least two double bonds, cis.

So the options are E, D, G.

Hmm, E says 18, at least two, cis. So that fits. G says three.

But the question is about what the molecules contain, not how many in each. So E and G are possibilities.

Wait, the question is about what they contain. So each molecule would have a certain number. So for example, alpha-linolenic acid has three, but others have two.

But the question is about what the molecules contain, not each one. Wait, no, the question is about the molecules themselves. So each molecule has a certain number.

Wait, perhaps the general case is that they have 18 carbons and at least two double bonds, in cis configuration.

So option E and D, but D has 20.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: 18 carbons, at least two double bonds in cis.

Wait, let me think of examples. Linoleic acid is 18:2 (two double bonds), and linolenic is 18:3. Both are cis. So the molecules have either two or three, but the question is about what they contain. So the correct option should include at least two, which is option E.

Natural polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils are characterized by the presence of multiple double bonds in the cis configuration. Vegetable oils typically contain fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, by definition, have at least two double bonds. Among the options provided:

- **Option A**: 22 carbons with at least two double bonds in the cis configuration. This is incorrect because vegetable oils generally do not contain fatty acids with 22 carbons.
- **Option B**: 20 carbons with at least two double bonds in the trans configuration. This is incorrect because trans double bonds are uncommon in natural fatty acids and are typically associated with processed foods.
- **Option C**: 20 carbons with one double bond in the cis configuration. This is incorrect because the question specifies polyunsaturated fatty acids, which require at least two double bonds.
- **Option D**: 20 carbons with at least two double bonds in the cis configuration. This is unlikely because vegetable oils predominantly contain fatty acids with 18 carbons, not 20.
- **Option E**: 18 carbons with at least two double bonds in the cis configuration. This is correct, as it aligns with the typical structure of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils, such as linoleic acid (18:2) and linolenic acid (18:3).
- **Option F**: 16 carbons with at least two double bonds in the cis configuration. This is incorrect because 16-carbon fatty acids are more commonly saturated or monounsaturated.
- **Option G**: 18 carbons with three double bonds in the cis configuration. While this is true for some polyunsaturated fatty acids like linolenic acid, the question asks about the general case, which includes fatty acids with at least two double bonds.
- **Option H**: 18 carbons with one double bond in the trans configuration. This is incorrect because trans double bonds are rare in natural fatty acids.
- **Option I**: 18 carbons with at least two double bonds in the trans configuration. This is incorrect for the same reason as above.
- **Option J**: 18 carbons with one double bond in the cis configuration. This is incorrect because the question specifies polyunsaturated fatty acids, which require at least two double bonds.

The most accurate answer is **Option E**, as it reflects the general structure of natural polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils, which typically have 18 carbons and at least two double bonds in the cis configuration.
