Question:

In learned helplessness research, it was found that giving solvable problems eliminated the helplessness caused by unsolvable problems. It is argued thar this is due to

Options:

A: the shift in locus of control from internal to external
B: a reduction in stress levels caused by the presence of solvable problems
C: the application of a continuous reinforcement schedule
D: a practice effect
E: a boost in self-confidence after solving problems
F: the development of a coping mechanism
G: a change in attribution with the realization that one can sometimes succeed
H: a change in the problem-solving strategy
I: the application of a partial reinforcement schedule

Okay, so I've got this question about learned helplessness. Hmm, I remember learned helplessness is a concept in psychology where people or animals feel they can't control their environment, so they stop trying even when they can. I think this was studied by Seligman and others. 

The question says that when solvable problems are given after unsolvable ones, the helplessness goes away. And they're asking why that happens. The options are from A to I. Let me think about each one.

Option A: Shift in locus of control from internal to external. Wait, locus of control is about whether you think your outcomes are due to your own actions (internal) or external factors. If someone shifts from internal to external, that might mean they feel less control. But wait, if given solvable problems, they might feel more internal control because they can solve things. So maybe this isn't the right reason.

Option B: Reduction in stress from solvable problems. Solving problems might lower stress, but does that explain why helplessness is eliminated? Maybe, but I'm not sure if this is the main reason. Stress reduction could be a result, but what's the underlying cause?

Option C: Continuous reinforcement schedule. That's a Skinner term where every correct response is rewarded. I don't think this applies directly here. The question is more about problem solving and control, not reinforcement schedules.

Option D: Practice effect. That's when you get better at something just by doing it. But the question isn't about improving at a task, it's about overcoming helplessness. Maybe it's part of it, but not the main reason.

Option E: Boost in self-confidence. Solving problems would make you feel more confident. That makes sense. If you feel you can succeed, you're less helpless. But is this the specific argument made in the research?

Option F: Development of a coping mechanism. Learning to cope could help, but I'm not sure if that's the direct explanation given in the theory.

Option G: Change in attribution, realizing you can succeed. Attribution is about why you think things happen. So if you start believing that your actions can lead to success, that changes your behavior. That sounds familiar. Learned helplessness is about attributing failure to something unchangeable, like your ability. So giving solvable problems might make people attribute success to their actions, changing their belief.

Option H: Change in problem-solving strategy. Maybe they start using better strategies, but the question is more about the psychological reason rather than the method.

Option I: Partial reinforcement schedule. That's when rewards are given intermittently. Not sure how that applies here.

So the key here is understanding why solvable problems help overcome learned helplessness. The theory says that when people are given solvable problems, they learn that their actions can lead to success. This changes their attributions. They realize that sometimes they can succeed, which counters the helplessness from before when they thought they couldn't do anything.

So looking back at the options, G says a change in attribution with the realization that one can sometimes succeed. That fits perfectly. So the answer should be G.

The concept of learned helplessness involves individuals feeling a lack of control over their environment, leading them to stop trying even when they can succeed. The question focuses on why providing solvable problems after unsolvable ones eliminates this helplessness. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** suggests a shift in locus of control, but this doesn't directly explain the elimination of helplessness.
- **B** mentions stress reduction, which might be a result but not the primary explanation.
- **C** and **I** refer to reinforcement schedules, which are unrelated to the context of problem-solving and control.
- **D** refers to a practice effect, which is about task improvement, not the psychological mechanism here.
- **E** highlights self-confidence, which is plausible but not the specific argument made in the research.
- **F** and **H** focus on coping mechanisms and strategies, which are secondary to the core explanation.
- **G** emphasizes a change in attribution, where individuals realize their actions can lead to success, directly addressing the psychological shift that overcomes helplessness.

The correct explanation is that solvable problems change individuals' attributions, helping them understand that success is possible, which aligns with option **G**.

Answer: G
