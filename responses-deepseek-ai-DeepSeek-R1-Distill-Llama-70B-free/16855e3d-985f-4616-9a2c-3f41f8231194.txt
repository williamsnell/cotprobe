Okay, so I've got this question here about group theory, which I'm a bit fuzzy on, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the identity element in the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8} under multiplication modulo 10. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember that in group theory, the identity element is the element that, when combined with any element in the set, leaves it unchanged. So for multiplication, the identity element should be 1 because any number multiplied by 1 is itself. But wait, in this case, the group is under modulo 10, and the set doesn't include 1. That's confusing. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the identity element doesn't have to be in the set G. Or does it? No, wait, in a group, the identity element must be part of the set. Otherwise, the set wouldn't satisfy the group axioms. So if G doesn't contain 1, maybe it's not a group? But the question says it's a group, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the identity element is different under modulo 10. Wait, but no, the identity for multiplication modulo n is still 1 because 1 is the multiplicative identity. For example, 2 * 1 mod 10 is 2, 3 * 1 mod 10 is 3, etc. So if G is a group under multiplication modulo 10, it must include 1 as the identity element. But looking at the set G given, which is {2,4,6,8}, there's no 1. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the group isn't actually a group unless it's closed under the operation, contains the identity, and every element has an inverse. So perhaps the given set isn't a group, but the question states it is. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach: maybe the identity element isn't 1 in this case? Let's think. The identity element e must satisfy a * e â‰¡ a mod 10 for all a in G. Let's test each element in G as possible e.

So for each element x in G, check if multiplying any element y in G by x mod 10 gives y.

Take x = 2: Let's see. 2*2 mod10=4, which is in G. 4*2=8, which is in G. 6*2=12 mod10=2, also in G. 8*2=16 mod10=6, which is in G. Wait, but this would mean that 2 is acting like an identity, but when I multiply 4 by 2, I get 8, which is different from 4. So no, 2 isn't the identity.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The identity e must leave every element unchanged when multiplied. So for e=2, 4*2 mod10=8, which is not equal to 4. So e can't be 2.

Next, try e=4. Let's see: 2*4=8 mod10=8. Not equal to 2, so no. So 4 isn't the identity.

e=6: 2*6=12 mod10=2. That's equal to 2. 4*6=24 mod10=4. Equal to 4. 6*6=36 mod10=6. Equal to 6. 8*6=48 mod10=8. Equal to 8. Oh wait, so 6 seems to satisfy the condition for all elements in G. So 6 is acting as the identity element in this group.

But wait, traditionally, the identity element in multiplicative groups modulo n is 1. So why is 6 working here? Maybe because the group is a subset of the multiplicative group modulo 10, but perhaps it's a different structure.

Wait, but normally, the multiplicative group modulo 10 has elements that are coprime to 10, which are {1,3,7,9}. But our group G here is {2,4,6,8}, which are all even, so they're not coprime to 10. Therefore, this group isn't the usual multiplicative group modulo 10. So perhaps it's a different kind of group, maybe under a different operation or with a different structure.

Wait, but the question says it's under multiplication modulo 10. So maybe I'm missing something about groups of even numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the group G isn't actually a group under multiplication modulo 10 unless it contains the identity element. But according to the problem statement, it is a group, so perhaps the identity element is not 1, but another number in the set.

Wait, let me think again. Let's compute for each possible e in G whether it acts as identity.

Check e=2:

2*2 mod10=4, which is in G. But 4*2=8, 6*2=2, 8*2=6. So when you multiply by 2, you don't get the same elements back. So 2 isn't the identity.

e=4:

2*4=8 mod10=8. 4*4=16 mod10=6. 6*4=24 mod10=4. 8*4=32 mod10=2. So it's not giving the same elements, so 4 isn't the identity.

e=6:

2*6=12 mod10=2. 4*6=24 mod10=4. 6*6=36 mod10=6. 8*6=48 mod10=8. Oh, so in this case, multiplying each element by 6 gives back the same element. So e=6 is acting as the identity. That's interesting.

e=8:

2*8=16 mod10=6. 4*8=32 mod10=2. 6*8=48 mod10=8. 8*8=64 mod10=4. So it's not leaving the elements unchanged. So 8 isn't the identity.

So the only element in G that acts as the identity is 6. So the answer should be I:6.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because in general, the identity element is unique in a group. So if 6 is the identity, then that makes sense. But I'm a bit confused because traditionally, 1 is the identity, but in this case, since 1 isn't in the group, perhaps 6 is the identity here.

So looking back at the options, option I is 6, so the answer should be I.

To determine the identity element in the group \( G = \{2, 4, 6, 8\} \) under multiplication modulo 10, we need to identify an element \( e \) such that for all \( a \in G \), \( a \cdot e \equiv a \mod 10 \). The identity element must leave every element in the group unchanged when multiplied.

### Testing Each Element:
1. **\( e = 2 \):**
   - \( 2 \cdot 2 \equiv 4 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 2).
   - \( 4 \cdot 2 \equiv 8 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 4).
   - \( 6 \cdot 2 \equiv 2 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 6).
   - \( 8 \cdot 2 \equiv 6 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 8).
   - **Conclusion:** 2 is not the identity element.

2. **\( e = 4 \):**
   - \( 2 \cdot 4 \equiv 8 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 2).
   - \( 4 \cdot 4 \equiv 6 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 4).
   - \( 6 \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 6).
   - \( 8 \cdot 4 \equiv 2 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 8).
   - **Conclusion:** 4 is not the identity element.

3. **\( e = 6 \):**
   - \( 2 \cdot 6 \equiv 2 \mod 10 \) (equal to 2).
   - \( 4 \cdot 6 \equiv 4 \mod 10 \) (equal to 4).
   - \( 6 \cdot 6 \equiv 6 \mod 10 \) (equal to 6).
   - \( 8 \cdot 6 \equiv 8 \mod 10 \) (equal to 8).
   - **Conclusion:** 6 satisfies the condition for all elements in \( G \), so 6 is the identity element.

4. **\( e = 8 \):**
   - \( 2 \cdot 8 \equiv 6 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 2).
   - \( 4 \cdot 8 \equiv 2 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 4).
   - \( 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 8 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 6).
   - \( 8 \cdot 8 \equiv 4 \mod 10 \) (not equal to 8).
   - **Conclusion:** 8 is not the identity element.

### Final Answer:
The identity element in the group \( G = \{2, 4, 6, 8\} \) under multiplication modulo 10 is \( 6 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
