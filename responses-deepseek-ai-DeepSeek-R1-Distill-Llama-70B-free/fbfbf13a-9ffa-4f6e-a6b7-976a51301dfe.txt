Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 3^(x – 3) + 10 = 19. Hmm, I'm a bit nervous because exponential equations can be tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I should probably isolate the exponential part. So, I need to get 3^(x-3) by itself on one side. The equation has +10, so I'll subtract 10 from both sides to get rid of it. Let's see, 19 minus 10 is 9. So that simplifies the equation to 3^(x-3) = 9. 

Wait, 3 to the power of something equals 9. I remember that 3 squared is 9 because 3*3 is 9. So, maybe the exponent (x-3) is 2. That would make sense because 3^2 is 9.

So, if I set x-3 equal to 2, then I can solve for x. Let's do that: x-3 = 2. Adding 3 to both sides gives x = 5. 

Wait, let me double-check. If x is 5, then plugging back into the original equation: 3^(5-3) + 10. That's 3^2 which is 9, plus 10 is 19, which matches the right side of the equation. So that checks out. 

I think that's it. So the answer should be 5.

The equation given is 3^(x – 3) + 10 = 19. To solve for x:

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:  
   3^(x – 3) = 9.

2. Recognize that 3^2 = 9, so set the exponent equal to 2:  
   x – 3 = 2.

3. Solve for x:  
   x = 5.

Verification: Substituting x = 5 into the original equation gives 3^(5–3) + 10 = 3^2 + 10 = 9 + 10 = 19, which is correct.
