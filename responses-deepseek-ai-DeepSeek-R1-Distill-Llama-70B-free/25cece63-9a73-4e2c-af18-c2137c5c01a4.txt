Okay, so I have this question about subsoil permeability and texture. Hmm, I need to figure out which texture corresponds to rapid permeability. Let me start by recalling what I know about soil textures and their properties.

Soil is generally classified into different textures based on the proportions of sand, silt, and clay particles. The main types are clay, silt, loam, sand, and some others like peat or rocky soils. Each of these has different properties, including how water moves through them.

Permeability refers to how easily water can pass through the soil. If the permeability is rapid, that means water moves through the soil quickly. Which soil texture allows for that? Well, I remember that sandy soils have larger pores because the sand particles are bigger. Larger pores mean water can move through more quickly. So sandy soils are more permeable.

Wait, let me think about each option:

A: clayey. Clay has very small particles, so the pores are tiny. Water moves slowly through clay soils. So this would have low permeability, not rapid.

B: medium. Medium texture, like loam maybe? Loam is a mix of sand, silt, and clay. It has moderate permeability, I think. Not the fastest.

C: peaty. Peat is organic soil, it's kind of spongy. It can hold a lot of water, so maybe it's more about water retention than permeability. I'm not too sure, but I don't think peat is known for rapid permeability.

D: loamy. As I thought earlier, loam is a balanced soil. It's fertile and has good water retention but doesn't have the largest pores. So permeability is moderate.

E: rocky. Rocky soil has a lot of rocks and gravel, which means large particles. But if it's rocky, maybe the soil is more fragmented, but I'm not sure if that's the best fit. Rocky might imply good drainage, but the actual classification is about texture, so maybe this isn't the right choice.

F: fine. Fine texture usually refers to smaller particles, like silt or clay. Fine soils have slower water movement. So not rapid permeability.

G: coarse. Coarse texture means larger particles, like sand. Larger particles have bigger pores, so water moves through quickly. That sounds like rapid permeability.

H: silty. Silt particles are smaller than sand but larger than clay. Silty soils have moderate permeability, maybe better than clay but not as good as sand.

So the question is asking for the classification when permeability is rapid. Based on this, coarse texture (option G) is the one that fits because it's sandy, allowing water to move quickly.

When considering the permeability of subsoil, rapid permeability is associated with soil textures that have larger pores, allowing water to move quickly. Among the options provided:

- **Clayey (A)** and **Fine (F)** soils have small particles, resulting in slow water movement.
- **Peaty (C)** and **Loamy (D)** soils have moderate water retention and permeability.
- **Silty (H)** soils have smaller particles than sand, leading to moderate permeability.
- **Rocky (E)** soils, while having large particles, are not classified as a specific texture in this context.
- **Coarse (G)** soils, characterized by larger particles like sand, have the largest pores, enabling rapid water movement.

Thus, the soil texture most likely to exhibit rapid permeability is **coarse**.

Answer: G
