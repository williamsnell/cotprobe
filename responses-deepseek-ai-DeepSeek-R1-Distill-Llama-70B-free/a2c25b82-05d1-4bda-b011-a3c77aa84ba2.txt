Okay, so I've got this question about a psychologist's duty when a patient admits to molesting a child. Hmm, I remember that psychologists have confidentiality, but there are exceptions. Like, if someone is in danger, right?

The patient is 35 and admitted to molesting a nine-year-old. He has a history of this behavior, so it's likely to happen again. So the psychologist needs to decide what to do.

Let me go through the options.

Option A: Inform the family first before authorities. Wait, but the family might not be able to stop him, and the child is in danger. Plus, the family might not even know. Not sure if that's the best step.

Option B: Seek advice from ethics committee. That could take time, and the child might be in immediate danger. So maybe not the first step.

Option C: Discuss in therapy without authorities. That doesn't help the child. The molestation is ongoing, so the psychologist can't just keep it confidential. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Notify child protection without telling the patient. That could be an option, but I think some laws require informing the patient when breaking confidentiality, especially if they're aware. Or maybe not, I'm not certain.

Option E: Notify authorities immediately and inform the patient. This seems right because the psychologist must protect the child. By informing the patient, they're being upfront, but also ensuring the authorities step in. I think this is the correct approach.

Option F: Encourage patient to turn himself in. That might not work, especially since he has a history. The psychologist can't rely on that; they need to take action themselves.

Option G: Warn the patient to stop or else. So this is like giving an ultimatum. But if the patient continues, the psychologist would have to report. But is that the immediate action? I think the immediate risk requires immediate reporting, not just a warning.

Option H: Handle within therapy and maintain confidentiality. No, that's not right because the child is at risk.

Option I: Inform the child's parents first. But what if the parents don't take action? The psychologist's duty is to protect the child, so they might need to go straight to authorities. Also, in some cases, the parents might be the abusers, but here the patient is someone else.

Option J: Keep it confidential. Definitely not, because of the risk to the child.

So the correct answer must be E. The psychologist should notify the authorities immediately and inform the patient about it. This upholds the duty to protect the child while being transparent with the patient.

The psychologist has a duty to protect the child from further harm, as the patient's admission of molesting a nine-year-old with a history of such behavior indicates a significant risk. Confidentiality must yield to this ethical imperative. Among the options:

- **A, I**: Notifying family or parents first may not ensure immediate protection for the child.
- **B**: Consulting an ethics committee delays action when immediate intervention is needed.
- **C, H, J**: Maintaining confidentiality or handling the issue internally ignores the imminent danger to the child.
- **D**: Notifying authorities without informing the patient may violate transparency standards.
- **F, G**: Relying on the patient to self-report or issuing warnings is insufficient given the risk.
- **E**: Notifying authorities immediately and informing the patient is the most appropriate course of action, balancing transparency with the urgent need to protect the child.

**Answer: E**
