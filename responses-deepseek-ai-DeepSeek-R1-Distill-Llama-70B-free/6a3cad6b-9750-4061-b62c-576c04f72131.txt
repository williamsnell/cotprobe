Okay, so I've got this problem here: 3^(3^(3^(...))) mod 100, and there are 2012 threes in the expression. Hmm, that's a tower of exponents, which can get really big. I remember that calculating such large exponents directly isn't feasible, so I need a smarter way to find the modulus.

First, I think about modular exponentiation properties. Maybe Euler's theorem can help here. Euler's theorem states that if two numbers are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ is Euler's totient function. Since 3 and 100 are coprime (their GCD is 1), this should apply.

So, φ(100)... Let me calculate that. 100 is 2^2 * 5^2. The totient function is multiplicative for prime powers, so φ(100) = φ(2^2) * φ(5^2). φ(p^k) is p^k - p^(k-1). So φ(2^2) is 4-2=2, and φ(5^2) is 25-5=20. Multiply those together: 2*20=40. So φ(100)=40.

That means 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100. So if I can express the exponent as something modulo φ(100), I can simplify the calculation. But wait, the exponent itself is another power of 3, which is going to be way larger than 40. So I need to find the exponent modulo φ(100), which is 40.

So let me denote the exponent as E. E is 3^(3^(...)) with 2011 threes. So 3^E mod 100 is the same as 3^(E mod 40) mod 100, because of Euler's theorem.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Wait, Euler's theorem tells us that 3^40 ≡1 mod 100. So 3^k mod 100 cycles every 40. So if k is larger than 40, we can write k as 40*q + r, so 3^k = (3^40)^q * 3^r ≡ 1^q * 3^r mod 100. So yes, we can reduce the exponent modulo 40, but that's only if 3 and 100 are coprime, which they are, but wait, wait, no, because 3 and 40 are coprime? Well, 40 is φ(100), which is 40. So 3 and 40 are coprime, yes, since 3 is prime and doesn't divide 40.

So to compute 3^E mod 100, where E is a tower of 2011 threes, I can compute E mod 40, then compute 3^(that result) mod 100.

So let's compute E mod 40. E is 3^(3^(...)) with 2011 threes. So E = 3^F, where F is the tower of 2010 threes.

So E mod 40 = 3^F mod 40. Again, since 3 and 40 are coprime, maybe Euler's theorem applies again. Let's compute φ(40). 40 is 2^3 *5^1. So φ(40) = φ(8)*φ(5) = (8-4)*(5-1) = 4*4=16. So φ(40)=16.

Thus, 3^16 ≡ 1 mod 40. So 3^F mod 40 can be written as 3^(F mod 16) mod 40.

So now I need to find F mod 16, where F is 3^(3^(...)) with 2010 threes.

Compute F mod 16. F is 3^G, where G is the tower of 2009 threes.

So F mod 16 = 3^G mod 16.

Now, since 3 and 16 are coprime, Euler's theorem applies. φ(16)=8. So 3^8 ≡1 mod 16. So 3^G mod 16 = 3^(G mod 8) mod 16.

So find G mod 8.

G is 3^(3^(...)) with 2008 threes. So G mod 8 is 3^H mod 8, where H is the tower of 2007 threes.

Now, φ(8)=4. So 3^4 ≡1 mod 8. So 3^H mod 8 = 3^(H mod 4) mod 8.

Wait, but 3 mod 4 is 3. So 3^1 mod 4 is 3, 3^2 is 1 mod 4. So the exponents cycle every 2. Let's think again.

Wait, 3 mod 4 is 3. So 3^1 mod4=3, 3^2=9 mod4=1, 3^3=3 mod4, etc. So the pattern cycles every 2 exponents. So 3^k mod4 is 3 if k is odd, 1 if even.

So for H mod 4: H is 3^... with 2007 threes. Let's see, H is 3^something. So H is 3^something, which is an exponent. So H is equal to 3^K, where K is a tower of 2006 threes. So H is an exponentiation of 3 again.

Wait, but H is 3^something, which is definitely an odd number. So 3^something is odd. So H is odd, so H mod 2 is 1, but wait, we're looking for H mod 4. Because to compute 3^H mod 8, we need H mod 2, because φ(8)=4? Wait, no, let's clarify.

Wait, earlier step: to compute 3^H mod 8, we can use Euler's theorem. φ(8)=4, so 3^4 ≡ 1 mod8. So 3^H mod8 = 3^(H mod 4) mod8. So to find H mod4.

H is 3^K, K is a tower of 2006 threes. So H = 3^K.

We need H mod4. 3 mod4 is 3. 3^1 mod4=3, 3^2=9 mod4=1, 3^3=3 mod4, etc. So, the exponent K: if K is even, 3^K mod4=1, else 3.

So H mod4 is 3^(K mod 2) mod4.

Wait, but K is 3^(3^(...)) with 2006 threes. So K is 3^something, which is again an exponent. So K is 3^something.

Wait, but 3^anything is odd. So K is 3^something, which is odd. So K is odd.

So K mod2=1. So H mod4=3^(1) mod4=3.

Wait, let me retrace:

We have H =3^K. K is 3^something, which is an exponent.

We need H mod4. Since 3^k mod4 is 3 if k is odd, 1 if even.

So, is K odd or even? Well, 3^something is always odd. So K is 3^something, which is odd.

So K is odd, so 3^K mod4 is 3. So H mod4=3.

So going back, H mod4=3.

So, now, 3^H mod8=3^(3) mod8. 3^3=27 mod8=3. So 3^H mod8=3.

So F mod16=3^G mod16, which is 3^3 mod16. 3^3 is 27 mod16=11.

So F mod16=11.

Going back, E mod40=3^F mod40. F mod16=11, so E mod40=3^11 mod40.

Wait, 3^11. Let's compute that mod40.

Compute 3^1 mod40=3.

3^2=9.

3^3=27.

3^4=81 mod40=1.

Wait, 3^4=81, 81-2*40=1. So 3^4 ≡1 mod40.

So 3^11=3^(4*2 +3) =(3^4)^2 *3^3=1^2 *27=27 mod40.

So E mod40=27.

Now, the original problem: 3^E mod100.

So 3^E mod100, where E mod40=27.

So 3^27 mod100.

Compute 3^27 mod100.

I can compute this by successive squaring, perhaps.

Compute powers of 3 modulo100:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27

3^4=81

3^5=243 mod100=43

3^6=43*3=129 mod100=29

3^7=29*3=87

3^8=87*3=261 mod100=61

3^9=61*3=183 mod100=83

3^10=83*3=249 mod100=49

3^11=49*3=147 mod100=47

3^12=47*3=141 mod100=41

3^13=41*3=123 mod100=23

3^14=23*3=69

3^15=69*3=207 mod100=7

3^16=7*3=21

3^17=21*3=63

3^18=63*3=189 mod100=89

3^19=89*3=267 mod100=67

3^20=67*3=201 mod100=1

Wait, wait. 3^20 is 1 mod100? That's interesting. Because φ(100)=40, but sometimes the order can be lower. So 3^20≡1 mod100. That's a useful result.

So 3^20=1 mod100.

So 3^27=3^(20+7)=(3^20)*(3^7)=1 *87=87 mod100.

So 3^27 mod100=87.

So the answer is 87, which is option A.

To solve \( 3^{3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}} \mod 100 \) with 2012 threes, we use modular arithmetic and Euler's theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Euler's Theorem**: Since \( \gcd(3, 100) = 1 \), Euler's theorem tells us \( 3^{\phi(100)} \equiv 1 \mod 100 \), where \( \phi(100) = 40 \). Thus, \( 3^k \mod 100 \) depends on \( k \mod 40 \).

2. **Reduce the Exponent Modulo 40**: Let the exponent be \( E = 3^{3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}} \) with 2011 threes. To compute \( E \mod 40 \), we use \( \phi(40) = 16 \), so \( 3^k \mod 40 \) depends on \( k \mod 16 \).

3. **Reduce the Exponent Modulo 16**: Let \( F = 3^{3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}} \) with 2010 threes. To compute \( F \mod 16 \), we use \( \phi(16) = 8 \), so \( 3^k \mod 16 \) depends on \( k \mod 8 \).

4. **Reduce the Exponent Modulo 8**: Let \( G = 3^{3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}} \) with 2009 threes. To compute \( G \mod 8 \), note that \( 3^k \mod 8 \) cycles every 2 (e.g., \( 3^1 \equiv 3 \mod 8 \), \( 3^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \), \( 3^3 \equiv 3 \mod 8 \), etc.). Since \( G \) is a tower of 3s, \( G \) is odd, so \( G \mod 2 = 1 \). Thus, \( G \mod 4 = 3 \).

5. **Backtrack to Compute \( F \mod 16 \)**: Since \( F = 3^G \mod 16 \), and \( G \mod 4 = 3 \), we compute \( 3^3 \mod 16 = 27 \mod 16 = 11 \). Thus, \( F \mod 16 = 11 \).

6. **Backtrack to Compute \( E \mod 40 \)**: Since \( E = 3^F \mod 40 \), and \( F \mod 16 = 11 \), we compute \( 3^{11} \mod 40 \). Using successive powers:
   - \( 3^1 = 3 \mod 40 \)
   - \( 3^2 = 9 \mod 40 \)
   - \( 3^3 = 27 \mod 40 \)
   - \( 3^4 = 81 \mod 40 = 1 \)
   - \( 3^{11} = (3^4)^2 \cdot 3^3 = 1^2 \cdot 27 = 27 \mod 40 \).
   Thus, \( E \mod 40 = 27 \).

7. **Final Computation**: Now, compute \( 3^E \mod 100 \), where \( E \mod 40 = 27 \). Compute \( 3^{27} \mod 100 \) using successive powers:
   - \( 3^1 = 3 \mod 100 \)
   - \( 3^2 = 9 \mod 100 \)
   - \( 3^3 = 27 \mod 100 \)
   - \( 3^4 = 81 \mod 100 \)
   - \( 3^5 = 243 \mod 100 = 43 \)
   - \( 3^6 = 43 \cdot 3 = 129 \mod 100 = 29 \)
   - \( 3^7 = 29 \cdot 3 = 87 \mod 100 \)
   - \( 3^8 = 87 \cdot 3 = 261 \mod 100 = 61 \)
   - \( 3^9 = 61 \cdot 3 = 183 \mod 100 = 83 \)
   - \( 3^{10} = 83 \cdot 3 = 249 \mod 100 = 49 \)
   - \( 3^{11} = 49 \cdot 3 = 147 \mod 100 = 47 \)
   - \( 3^{12} = 47 \cdot 3 = 141 \mod 100 = 41 \)
   - \( 3^{13} = 41 \cdot 3 = 123 \mod 100 = 23 \)
   - \( 3^{14} = 23 \cdot 3 = 69 \mod 100 \)
   - \( 3^{15} = 69 \cdot 3 = 207 \mod 100 = 7 \)
   - \( 3^{16} = 7 \cdot 3 = 21 \mod 100 \)
   - \( 3^{17} = 21 \cdot 3 = 63 \mod 100 \)
   - \( 3^{18} = 63 \cdot 3 = 189 \mod 100 = 89 \)
   - \( 3^{19} = 89 \cdot 3 = 267 \mod 100 = 67 \)
   - \( 3^{20} = 67 \cdot 3 = 201 \mod 100 = 1 \)
   - \( 3^{27} = 3^{20} \cdot 3^7 = 1 \cdot 87 = 87 \mod 100 \).

Thus, the final answer is **87**.
