Okay, so I have this problem here about a bin with green and purple balls, and I need to find the number of purple balls, k. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: there are 5 green balls and k purple balls. So the total number of balls in the bin is 5 + k. Got that.

When a ball is drawn at random, if it's green, the player wins $2, and if it's purple, they lose $2. I'm supposed to find k such that the expected amount won is 50 cents. Hmm, wait, that's $0.50 because 50 cents is half a dollar.

Wait, expectation is like the average outcome. So the expected value (EV) is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing them up.

So the possible outcomes are two: win $2 with probability of drawing green, and lose $2 (which is -$2) with the probability of drawing purple.

Let me write the probabilities. The probability of drawing green is the number of green balls divided by total balls. So, that's 5/(5 + k). Similarly, the probability of drawing purple is k/(5 + k).

The expected value is then the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. So:

EV = (Probability of green) * (Amount won) + (Probability of purple) * (Amount lost)

Plugging in the numbers:

EV = [5/(5 + k)] * 2 + [k/(5 + k)] * (-2)

And we know that this expected value is $0.50.

So the equation is:

[5/(5 + k)] * 2 + [k/(5 + k)] * (-2) = 0.50

Let me simplify this equation.

First, let's compute each term:

First term: (5 * 2)/(5 +k) = 10/(5 +k)
Second term: (k * (-2))/(5 +k) = (-2k)/(5 +k)

Adding them together:

(10 - 2k)/(5 +k) = 0.5

So the equation is (10 - 2k)/(5 +k) = 0.5

Now, I can solve for k.

Let me multiply both sides by (5 +k) to eliminate the denominator:

10 - 2k = 0.5*(5 +k)

Expand the right side:

0.5*5 is 2.5, and 0.5*k is 0.5k. So:

10 - 2k = 2.5 + 0.5k

Now, let's get all the terms with k on one side and constants on the other.

I'll add 2k to both sides:

10 = 2.5 + 0.5k + 2k

Which simplifies to:

10 = 2.5 + 2.5k

Wait, because 0.5k + 2k is 2.5k.

Subtract 2.5 from both sides:

10 - 2.5 = 2.5k

7.5 = 2.5k

Now, divide both sides by 2.5:

k = 7.5 / 2.5

Let me compute that. 2.5 times 3 is 7.5, so 7.5 divided by 2.5 is 3.

Wait, wait a minute. So k equals 3? Let me check the options. Option D is 3. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Let me go through the steps again.

We set up the EV equation correctly. The two probabilities are 5/(5+k) and k/(5+k). The payouts are +2 and -2. So the equation is correct.

Then [10 -2k]/(5 +k) = 0.5.

Multiply both sides: 10-2k = 0.5*(5 +k).

10-2k = 2.5 + 0.5k.

Adding 2k to both sides: 10 = 2.5 + 2.5k.

Subtract 2.5: 7.5 = 2.5k.

Divide: k=3.

So k is 3, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check by plugging k=3 into the original expectation.

Total balls: 5+3=8.

Probability green: 5/8. EV from green: 5/8 * 2 = 10/8 = 1.25.

Probability purple: 3/8. EV from purple: 3/8 * (-2) = -6/8 = -0.75.

Total EV: 1.25 - 0.75 = 0.5. Which is 50 cents. So yes, that works.

So the correct answer is D:3.

To determine the value of \( k \), we start by calculating the expected value (EV) of the game. The bin contains 5 green balls and \( k \) purple balls, making the total number of balls \( 5 + k \). The probabilities of drawing a green or purple ball are \( \frac{5}{5+k} \) and \( \frac{k}{5+k} \), respectively. The payouts for drawing a green ball is \( +\$2 \), and for drawing a purple ball is \( -\$2 \).

The expected value is given by:

\[
\text{EV} = \left( \frac{5}{5+k} \right)(2) + \left( \frac{k}{5+k} \right)(-2)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{EV} = \frac{10 - 2k}{5+k}
\]

We are told that the expected value is \$0.50. Setting up the equation:

\[
\frac{10 - 2k}{5+k} = 0.5
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( 5+k \):

\[
10 - 2k = 0.5(5+k)
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:

\[
10 - 2k = 2.5 + 0.5k
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
10 - 2.5 = 2.5k
\]

\[
7.5 = 2.5k
\]

Dividing both sides by 2.5:

\[
k = 3
\]

To verify, if \( k = 3 \), the total number of balls is \( 5 + 3 = 8 \). The expected value becomes:

\[
\text{EV} = \left( \frac{5}{8} \right)(2) + \left( \frac{3}{8} \right)(-2) = 1.25 - 0.75 = 0.5
\]

This matches the given condition. Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: 3**
