Okay, so I have this question about how changing sin x to 3 sin 2x affects the domain and range of the function. Hmm, I remember that for trigonometric functions, the domain and range can change based on transformations applied. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the original function is f(x) = sin x. The domain of sin x is all real numbers, right? So any x value is allowed. The range is from -1 to 1 because sine of any angle is between -1 and 1.

Now, the function is changed to 3 sin 2x. Let's break this down. There are two transformations here: a horizontal compression and a vertical stretch.

Starting with the horizontal compression. The 2x inside the sine function affects the period. The period of sin x is 2π. When you have sin(Bx), the period becomes 2π/B. So here, B is 2, so the period is π. That means the graph completes a cycle twice as fast. So the domain, which was all real numbers before, is technically still all real numbers because there's no restriction. Wait, but does the period affect the domain? Hmm, the domain is about the input values, and since it's still defined for all x, the domain doesn't change. So the domain remains the same as before.

Next, the vertical stretch. The 3 multiplied in front of the sine function. This affects the amplitude, which is the maximum value the function reaches. The original amplitude was 1, so stretching it by 3 makes the amplitude 3. So the range, which was [-1, 1], now becomes [-3, 3]. So the range is tripled because it's multiplied by 3.

Putting it all together: changing sin x to 3 sin 2x doesn't change the domain (all real numbers) but triples the range from [-1,1] to [-3,3].

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where the domain stays the same and range is tripled. Let me check the options:

A: Domain same; range tripled → This fits.

B: Both same → No, range changes.

C: Domain halved; range tripled → No, domain same.

H: Domain same; range doubled → No, tripled.

So the correct answer should be A.

The original function is \( f(x) = \sin x \), which has a domain of all real numbers and a range of \([-1, 1]\). When the function is transformed to \( 3 \sin 2x \), two changes occur:

1. **Horizontal Compression**: The factor \( 2x \) inside the sine function reduces the period from \( 2\pi \) to \( \pi \). However, this does not affect the domain, which remains all real numbers.

2. **Vertical Stretch**: The factor \( 3 \) outside the sine function triples the amplitude, changing the range from \([-1, 1]\) to \([-3, 3]\).

Thus, the domain remains the same, while the range is tripled. The correct answer is:

**A: Domain is the same; range is tripled.**
