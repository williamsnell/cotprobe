Okay, so I've got this probability question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking, what's the probability of getting a 5 on each of two successive rolls of a balanced die. Hmm, okay, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of multiple events happening in sequence, you usually multiply the probabilities of each individual event, assuming they're independent.

So first, I need to find the probability of rolling a 5 on a single roll of a die. A standard die has six faces, numbered 1 through 6. So there's only one favorable outcome, which is rolling a 5. That means the probability for one roll is 1 out of 6, so 1/6.

Now, since the rolls are successive and independent—that is, the outcome of the first roll doesn't affect the second—the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So I need to multiply 1/6 by itself. Let me write that down: (1/6) * (1/6) equals 1/36.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes in probability questions, people get tripped up between combinations and permutations, but in this case, since each roll is independent and we're looking for both to be 5, it's straightforward. There's only one way to get 5 on the first roll and 5 on the second. So the total number of favorable outcomes is 1 (for the first roll) multiplied by 1 (for the second), giving 1. The total possible outcomes for two rolls is 6 * 6, which is 36. So yes, 1/36 is correct.

Looking at the options provided, option E is 1/36. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, just to double-check, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is, each roll is separate. The first roll has a 1/6 chance of being 5. Then, regardless of the first roll, the second has another 1/6 chance. So for both to happen, multiply them. Yep, that's 1/36. So I'm confident that E is the right choice.

The probability of rolling a 5 on a single roll of a balanced die is \( \frac{1}{6} \). Since the two rolls are independent, the probability of getting a 5 on both rolls is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: \( \frac{1}{36} \)
