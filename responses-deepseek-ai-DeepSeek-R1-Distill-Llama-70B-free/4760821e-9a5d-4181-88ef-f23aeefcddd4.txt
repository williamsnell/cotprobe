Okay, so I have this question here: "What can murtis be translated as?" with options from A to J. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

First, I remember that "murti" is a term I've heard in the context of Hinduism. I think it's related to statues or images used in worship. So, murtis are like the physical representations of deities.

Looking at the options, I need to find the best translation. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Sacrifices. That doesn't seem right. Sacrifices are more like offerings given to deities, maybe like in some rituals, but not the statues themselves.

Option B: Blessings. Blessings are what you might receive from a deity, not the physical object. So probably not that.

Option C: Offerings. Offerings are things given to the gods, like food or flowers, so again, not the statue itself. So C is out.

Option D: Prayers. Prayers are the acts of praying, not the physical items. So D isn't right.

Option E: Apparitions. That's more like visions or ghostly appearances, which doesn't fit with murtis. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Idols. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I've heard the term "idols" used to describe statues of deities in temples. So F is a strong candidate.

Option G: Rituals. Rituals are the ceremonies or practices, not the statues. So G isn't it.

Option H: Scriptures. Scriptures are the holy texts, like the Vedas or Bible, so H is not correct.

Option I: Spirits. Spirits are the non-physical beings, but murtis are physical representations. So I doesn't fit.

Option J: Symbols. Symbols are representations, but murtis are more than just symbols; they're actual statues. So J might be a possibility, but not as precise as "idols."

Wait, but I should think about the exact meaning. In Hinduism, murtis are considered manifestations of the divine, so they're idols in the sense of being worshipped images. So F: Idols would be the correct translation.

The term "murtis" refers to statues or images of deities in Hinduism, used in worship. Among the options provided, "idols" is the most accurate translation, as it directly corresponds to the physical representations of deities.
