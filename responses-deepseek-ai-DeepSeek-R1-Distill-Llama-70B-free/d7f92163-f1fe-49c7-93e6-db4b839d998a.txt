Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about simple random samples, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking which statement is false about simple random samples. The options are A through E. I need to figure out each one and see which one doesn't hold true.

First, I should probably recall what a simple random sample (SRS) is. From what I remember, an SRS is a subset of the population where each individual has an equal chance of being selected, and the selection of one doesn't affect the others. So every member of the population has the same probability of being in the sample, and the sample is drawn in such a way that all possible samples of that size are equally likely.

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: "The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample." Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I remember that the randomness of a sample refers to how each member has an equal chance. So maybe the population size doesn't affect that. Or does it? Wait, maybe larger populations require more careful sampling methods to ensure randomness, but the actual randomness (each element having equal chance) isn't dependent on population size. So maybe A is false because the size doesn't affect the randomness, but I'm not certain yet. I'll come back to this.

Option B: "Every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked." That sounds correct. That's the definition of an SRS. Each element has the same probability of selection. So B is a true statement, which can't be the false one we're looking for.

Option C: "A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample." Wait, no. I think the size of the sample doesn't determine if it's a simple random sample. Even a small sample, like 10 people, can be an SRS if each individual has an equal chance. So C is probably a false statement, but wait, maybe there's more nuance. I think some sources might say that while technically any size can be SRS, in practice, larger samples better represent the population. But the definition doesn't require a minimum size. So C might be the false statement.

Option D: "Attributes of a simple random sample may be very different from attributes of the population." That makes sense because of sampling variability. Even if the sample is random, it's possible for sample statistics to differ from population parameters, especially with smaller samples. So D is a true statement.

Option E: "Inspection of a sample will give no indication of whether or not it is a simple random sample." That's correct because you can't just look at the sample and tell if it was randomly selected or not. For example, a sample might look diverse, but that doesn't mean it's random. So E is a true statement.

Wait, going back to option A: "The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample." I don't think the size affects the randomness. Randomness is about equal probability. So whether the population is large or small, as long as each element has an equal chance, the sample is random. So statement A is false because the population size doesn't impact the sample's randomness. So A is a false statement.

Wait, but I thought C was a candidate. Let me clarify: the question is about which is false. So, if C says the sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered an SRS, is that correct? I think the size doesn't matter; even a small sample is SRS if the selection was random. So C is a false statement.

Wait, but which is the correct answer here. The question is which is false. So if option C is false because a sample doesn't have to be large, and option A is also false because population size doesn't affect randomness, then I need to figure out which one is actually false.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Option A's statement: "The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample." So, does the population size affect the sample's randomness? I don't think so. Because randomness is about the selection process, not the population's size. So, whether the population is 100 or 1,000,000, as long as each element has an equal chance, it's random. Therefore, A is a false statement because the size of the population doesn't affect the sample's randomness.

Option C says a sample must be reasonably large to be an SRS. That's not true because SRS doesn't require a minimum size. So C's statement is false, making C the false statement.

Wait, but wait, the question is about which is false. So both A and C are false? That can't be the case because the question expects one correct answer.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think:

Simple random sampling doesn't depend on population size. So A is false because it says the population size affects randomness, which it doesn't.

C is about sample size needing to be reasonably large. But SRS can be any size, so C is also a false statement.

Wait, but the options can't both be false. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts. Let me check:

In statistics, a simple random sample is defined as a sample where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. The size of the sample is a separate consideration. So, for example, a sample of size 2 can be an SRS if each individual had an equal chance.

So, option C is incorrect because it says the sample must be reasonably large. That's not a requirement. Therefore, C is a false statement.

Option A: The population's size affects the sample's randomness. I think that's not correct. The sample's randomness is about selection, not population size. So A is also false.

But the question is about which is a false statement, so perhaps more than one is false, but the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The options are A through E, and each is a statement about SRS. The question is which is false.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A because the population size doesn't affect the sample's randomness. Or maybe it's C because sample size doesn't have to be large.

Wait, the question is about which is a false statement. So let's consider each option again.

Option A: The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. No, the randomness is about the selection process, not the population size. So A is false.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. No, because even a small sample can be SRS. So C is false.

So both A and C are false statements, but that can't be because the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about one of them. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct. Because while technically any size can be SRS, sometimes in practice, people might say that a sample needs to be of a certain size to be reliable, but that's more about the sample's representativeness, not whether it's an SRS. So, the size doesn't affect whether it's an SRS, only whether it's a good sample. Therefore, C is a false statement.

Option A: The size of the population affects randomness. If the population is larger, does that make it harder to achieve randomness? Not inherently. It's about the method, not the size. So A is false.

But if both A and C are false, that's a problem. But looking back, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, perhaps option A is not about the population's size affecting the sample's randomness, but rather the sample's size. Or perhaps I'm interpreting it wrong.

Wait, the wording is: "The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample." So it's the population's size influencing the sample's randomness. I don't think that's the case. The sample's randomness is about the selection method, not population size. So A is false.

But then, if both A and C are false, but the options only allow one correct answer, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option C. Let me think again. Is a sample required to be reasonably large to be an SRS? No, because an SRS can be of any size, even 1. So, option C is a false statement because it's not necessary for the sample to be large. Therefore, C is false.

So now I'm confused because both A and C seem false. But that can't be the case, so I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the statement in C is false because it's not required for the sample to be large. So the correct answer is C.

Option A, perhaps, is true. Wait, no, because the population's size doesn't affect the sample's randomness. So A is false.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: think of what's true and false.

True statements about SRS:

- Every element has an equal chance (B is true).

- Inspection can't tell if it's SRS (E is true).

- Sample attributes may differ from population (D is true).

- A sample doesn't have to be large (so C is false).

- The population size doesn't affect the sample's randomness (so A is false).

Wait, so both A and C are false statements, but the question asks for which is false. That suggests that I'm misunderstanding one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option A. Maybe the population's size does affect randomness. But how?

Wait, for example, in a very small population, say 10 people, and a sample size of 5. The randomness would still be about each having equal chance. So regardless of the population size, as long as the selection is random, the sample is SRS. So population size doesn't affect randomness. Therefore, A is a false statement.

Similarly, C is a false statement because sample size doesn't have to be large.

But the question can only have one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should check some sources. From what I recall, the key characteristics of an SRS are that each element has an equal chance, and each possible sample of that size is equally likely. The size of the sample doesn't have to be large; even a small sample is SRS if the selection is random.

So, option C is false because it's not necessary for the sample to be large.

Option A is also false because the population size doesn't affect the sample's randomness.

Wait, but perhaps the question is testing knowledge that a larger population may require a larger sample for accuracy, but that's about representativeness, not about the SRS definition.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between population size and sample size. Let me read the options again.

Option A: "The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample."

So, population size (N) affects the sample's randomness. I don't think that's true. Randomness is about the selection method, not N.

Therefore, A is a false statement.

So, now I'm torn between A and C being false statements.

But the question is to pick the false statement, and the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should consider what each option is stating.

Option C says a sample must be reasonably large. That's a false statement because sample size doesn't determine if it's SRS.

Option A says population size affects randomness, which is also false.

But since the question gives only one correct answer, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the definitions again.

In the definition of SRS, the population size is N, and the sample size is n. The key is that each element has an equal chance to be in the sample. The population size could be any size, and the sample size could be any size, as long as the selection is random. So, both A and C are false statements.

But that can't be, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, as the population size does affect the sample's randomness because in larger populations, it's harder to achieve true randomness, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. The method of random selection (like using a random number generator) is what ensures randomness, regardless of N.

So, A is a false statement because it's saying that population size affects randomness, which it doesn't.

So, if the options are A to E, the false statements would be A and C. But since only one option is correct, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm going to go with option C being the false statement because the sample doesn't need to be large.

To determine which statement is false about simple random samples (SRS), let's analyze each option carefully:

### Option A: "The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample."
This statement is **false**. The randomness of a sample is determined by the selection process, where each element of the population has an equal chance of being chosen. The size of the population does not inherently affect the randomness of the sample. Whether the population is small or large, as long as the selection method is random, the sample is considered a simple random sample.

### Option B: "Every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked."
This statement is **true**. This is the defining characteristic of a simple random sample. Every element in the population must have an equal probability of being selected.

### Option C: "A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample."
This statement is **false**. The size of the sample does not determine whether it is a simple random sample. Even a small sample can be an SRS if the selection process is random. While larger samples may better represent the population, size is not a requirement for a sample to be classified as an SRS.

### Option D: "Attributes of a simple random sample may be very different from attributes of the population."
This statement is **true**. Due to sampling variability, the attributes of a simple random sample (e.g., sample mean, proportion) may differ from the corresponding population attributes, especially with smaller sample sizes.

### Option E: "Inspection of a sample will give no indication of whether or not it is a simple random sample."
This statement is **true**. A sample's appearance or characteristics do not provide evidence of whether it was randomly selected. For example, a sample might look representative, but that does not confirm it is an SRS.

### Conclusion:
Both **Option A** and **Option C** are false statements. However, since the question asks for a single false statement, **Option C** is the better choice because it directly contradicts the definition of an SRS by implying that sample size is a determining factor, which it is not.
