Okay, so I've got this question about the boiling point of water at high altitude, specifically on top of Mount Everest. Hmm, I remember that boiling point changes with atmospheric pressure. Oh right, lower pressure means a lower boiling point because the vapor pressure can reach equilibrium at a lower temperature.

The question gives me the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) as 40.656 kJ/mol. Wait, I think that's the heat of vaporization, right. And the normal boiling point is 373.12 K, which is 100 degrees Celsius, makes sense. But on Everest, the pressure is lower—253 Torr. I need to find the new boiling point.

So I think I'll need to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation here. The equation relates the vapor pressure of a liquid to the temperature. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2), where P1 and P2 are the pressures, T1 and T2 the corresponding temperatures.

Wait, but wait, is it P2 over P1 or the other way? Let me think. At higher pressure (like standard atmospheric pressure), the boiling point is higher. So when pressure decreases, the boiling point decreases. So if P2 is lower than P1, T2 should be lower than T1.

So the equation should be ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). Or is it the negative? Oh wait, the equation is usually written as ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH/(R)(1/T2 - 1/T1). Or maybe I should consult the formula again.

Wait, the correct form is (dP/dT) = (PΔH)/(RT^2) or something like that. But for the integrated form, assuming ΔH is constant, which is probably the case here. So the equation is ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH_vap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1). Alternatively, sometimes written as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, let me get the signs right. Let me think: if P2 > P1, then the boiling point T2 would be higher. So when P increases, T increases. So suppose P2 is higher than P1. So (P2/P1) is greater than 1, so ln is positive. So the right side must be positive. So (1/T1 - 1/T2) would be positive because if T2 is higher, 1/T2 is lower. So 1/T1 -1/T2 is positive. So (ΔH/R) times positive gives a positive ln(P2/P1). So the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). Yeah, that makes sense.

So in this problem, P1 is the standard pressure where water boils at 373.12 K. What is that pressure? I think standard atmospheric pressure is 760 Torr. So P1 = 760 Torr, T1 = 373.12 K. P2 is 253 Torr, which is lower. So we're solving for T2.

So plug into the equation:

ln(253/760) = (40656 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/373.12 - 1/T2)

Wait, wait, wait. Units! Oh, ΔH_vap is given in kJ/mol. I need to convert to J. So 40.656 kJ is 40656 J/mol.

So let's compute the left side first: 253/760 is approximately 0.33289. The natural log of that. Let me calculate ln(0.33289). Hmm, ln(1/3) is about -1.0986; 0.33289 is roughly 1/3 (0.3333), so ln(0.33289) is approximately -1.104.

Now the right side. Let's compute 40656 / 8.314. Let me calculate that. 8.314 times 4880 is about 40,000. So 40656 / 8.314 ≈ 40656 / 8 = 5082, but more accurately, 8.314 * 4900 = let's see: 8 *4900 is 39200, and 0.314*4900≈1538.6, total around 40738.6. So 40656 is a bit less, so 4900 - (approx) 82/8.314. Hmm, maybe around 4890 or so. Let me just compute 40656 ÷8.314.

8.314 × 4890 = ?

8 * 4890 = 39120.

0.314 *4890= 0.3 *4890=1467, 0.014*4890=68.46. Total 1467 +68.46=1535.46. So 39120 +1535.46=40655.46. Oh wait, that's exactly 40655.46, which is very close to the given 40656. So 4890. So approximately 4890 K·mol⁻¹? Wait, no, the unit would be in 1/K.

So 40656 /8.314 ≈ 4890, so let's say 4890 K for the term.

So the equation becomes:

-1.104 ≈ 4890 * (1/373.12 - 1/T2)

Let me compute 1/373.12: 1/373 ≈ 0.002681 K^-1.

So,

-1.104 = 4890 * (0.002681 - 1/T2 )

Let me compute 4890 * 0.002681: 4890 * 0.002681. 4000 *0.002681=10.724, 890 *0.002681≈2.385. So total around 13.109.

So,

-1.104 ≈ 13.109 - (4890 / T2 )

Wait, because it's 4890*(0.002681 - 1/T2) = 4890*(a - b) = 13.109 - 4890*(1/T2)

So the equation is:

-1.104 = 13.109 - (4890 * (1/T2))

Rearranging, 4890*(1/T2) = 13.109 + 1.104 → 14.213.

So,

4890 / T2 = 14.213 → T2 = 4890 /14.213 → Let me compute that.

4890 ÷14.213. Let's see. 14 × 344 = 4816. Because 14*300=4200, 14*44=616 → 4200+616=4816. So 344 *14=4816, which is less than 4890. The difference is 74. 74 /14 ≈5.2857. So T2 is approximately 344 +5.2857 = 349.2857 K.

Wait, wait, no wait, 4890 ÷14.213 → let me compute 14.213 × 344 =?

14 ×344= 4816, 0.213 ×344 ≈73.3, so total around 4889.3. So 14.213 *344 ≈4889.3. So 4890 is 0.7 more, so 344 + (0.7 /14.213) ≈344.049 K.

Wait that's around 344 K. Let me check the options. The options are A:355, B:338, C:340, D:365, E:345, F:360, G:325, H:350, I:344, J:330. So 344 is option I. But wait, my calculation gave about 344. So perhaps the correct answer is I:344 K.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made an error in the initial steps.

Wait, let me redo some steps with more precise numbers.

Compute ln(253/760): 253 ÷760 = 0.3328947. ln(0.3328947) is approximately, let me calculate using calculator: ln(0.333) is about -1.0986. But 0.3328947 is a bit less than 0.333, so ln would be a bit less, maybe -1.105.

ΔH_vap is 40656 J/mol, R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

Compute 40656 /8.314: Let's compute 8.314 × 4890 = 40655.46, so 40656 /8.314 = 4890.005. So approximately 4890. So that's correct.

Compute 1/373.12: 373.12 is 373 K and 0.12 K. 1/373 ≈0.002681. 1/373.12 will be slightly less. Let me compute it: 1 / 373.12 = approximately 0.002681 (since 373.12 is a little more than 373, so 1/373.12 is a little less than 1/373). Let's say 0.002679.

So 4890 * (0.002679 - 1/T2 ) = -1.105.

Compute 4890 *0.002679: 4890 *0.002679 = ?

Well, 4890 *0.002 =9.78, 4890 *0.000679 = approx 4890 *0.0006=2.934, 4890 *0.000079≈0.386. So total≈2.934 +0.386=3.32, so 9.78 +3.32=13.1. So 4890 *0.002679≈13.1.

So,

4890*(0.002679 - 1/T2) = -1.105 → 13.1 - (4890/T2) = -1.105 → 4890/T2 = 13.1 + 1.105 → 14.205 → T2 = 4890 /14.205 → Let's compute that.

14.205 × 344 = 14 ×344=4816, 0.205×344=70.62 → total 4886.62. So 14.205 ×344 ≈4886.62. 4890 -4886.62=3.38. So 3.38 /14.205 ≈0.238. So T2=344.238 K, approximately 344.24 K.

Looking at the options, option I is 344 K. So the answer should be I.

But wait, let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the formula? Sometimes I get confused with the signs.

Alternative approach: The Clausius-Clapeyron equation can also be written as:

ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH_vap/R) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Wait, that's another version. Let me check that possibility. So if that's the case, let me recalculate.

So using ln(253/760) = -(40656/8.314)(1/T2 - 1/373.12 )

Compute ln(253/760)= ln(0.3328947)= approx -1.105.

So,

-1.105 = -(40656/8.314) (1/T2 - 1/373.12 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.105 = (40656/8.314)(1/T2 -1/373.12 )

Compute 40656/8.314=4890 as before.

So,

1.105 =4890*(1/T2 - 0.002679 )

Compute 1/T2 = (1.105 /4890 ) + 0.002679.

1.105 /4890 = approx 0.0002257.

So,

1/T2 = 0.0002257 + 0.002679 = 0.0029047.

Thus, T2 = 1 / 0.0029047 ≈ 344.2 K.

Same result as before, so T2 is approximately 344 K. So option I.

To calculate the boiling point of water at the top of Mt. Everest, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

where:
- \(P_1 = 760 \, \text{Torr}\) (standard atmospheric pressure),
- \(T_1 = 373.12 \, \text{K}\) (normal boiling point of water),
- \(P_2 = 253 \, \text{Torr}\) (pressure at the top of Mt. Everest),
- \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 40.656 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 40656 \, \text{J/mol}\),
- \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\ln(P_2 / P_1)\)
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{253}{760} \approx 0.33289
\]
\[
\ln(0.33289) \approx -1.105
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R}\)
\[
\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} = \frac{40656}{8.314} \approx 4890 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(T_2\)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]
\[
-1.105 = 4890 \left(\frac{1}{373.12} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{373.12}\):
\[
\frac{1}{373.12} \approx 0.002679 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

Substitute into the equation:
\[
-1.105 = 4890 \left(0.002679 - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

Simplify:
\[
-1.105 = 4890 \cdot 0.002679 - \frac{4890}{T_2}
\]
\[
-1.105 = 13.1 - \frac{4890}{T_2}
\]

Rearranging:
\[
\frac{4890}{T_2} = 13.1 + 1.105
\]
\[
\frac{4890}{T_2} = 14.205
\]

Solve for \(T_2\):
\[
T_2 = \frac{4890}{14.205} \approx 344.2 \, \text{K}
\]

### Final Answer
The boiling point of water at the top of Mt. Everest is approximately **344 K**, which corresponds to option **I**.

**Answer: I**
