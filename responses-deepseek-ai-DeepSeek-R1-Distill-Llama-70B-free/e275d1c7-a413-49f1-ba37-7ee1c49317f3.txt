Question:

Consider that in horses a single pair of genes controls gait. Some horses can only exhibit a trotting gait, while others exhibit only a pacing gait. In an attempt to determine the pattern of inheritance displayed by this trait, a horse breeder crossed a stallion (\male) that came from a long line of pacers to several mares (\venus) that were trotters. All of the foals were trotters. Which gait is under the control of the dominant gene? Using the letters T and t to represent the dominant and recessive genes, respectively, identify the genotypes of the stallion, the mares and the foals.

Options:

A: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
B: Pacing gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
C: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
D: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
E: Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is TT.
F: Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
G: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
H: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
I: Pacing gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
J: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about horses and their gaits. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. The question says that a single pair of genes controls the gait in horses. Some can only trot, others can only pace. 

So the breeder crossed a stallion from a long line of pacers with several mares that were trotters. All the foals ended up being trotters. I need to figure out which gait is dominant, and then determine the genotypes of the stallion, mares, and foals.

Wait, let me remember how dominant and recessive traits work. If a trait is dominant, it will show up if the organism has at least one copy of the dominant allele. Recessive traits only show when the organism has two copies of the recessive allele.

In this case, the stallion is a pacer. The mares are trotters. All the foals are trotters. So what does that tell me about the genotypes?

Let's think about possible scenarios. Let's say that the pacer is the dominant trait. Then, if the stallion is a pacer, he might be either TT or Tt. The mares are trotters, so if pacer is dominant, the mares must be tt because they can't show the dominant pacer trait unless they have at least one T. But wait, if the mares were tt, then any foal would get a T from the stallion and a t from the mare.

If the stallion is TT, then he can only give T. So the foal would be Tt. If the pacer is dominant, then Tt would show pacer trait. But the foals are all trotting, which is the opposite. So that doesn't fit. So pacer can't be dominant in this case because the foals would have been pacers.

Alternatively, maybe the pacer is recessive. So if pacer is recessive, then the pacer stallion must be tt. The mares are trotters, so they must be either TT or Tt. But the foals are all trotting, which is dominant. So if the stallion is tt, he can only give t. The mares must give T or t. If the mares are TT, then all foals would get T from the mares and t from the stallion, so Tt. If pacer is recessive, then Tt would show the dominant trait, which is trotting. That fits because the foals are all trotters.

Wait, but the mares were trotters. If the mares were TT, then their genotype is homozygous dominant. But the foals would be Tt. Alternatively, if the mares are Tt, then when they mate with tt, the foals would have a 50% chance of TT and 50% tt. But in the question, all foals are trotters. So in that scenario, if the mares were Tt, half the foals would be TT (trotters) and half would be tt (pacers). But in reality, all foals are trotters, so that can't be the case. Therefore, the mares must be TT.

Wait, but that's not possible because the problem says the mares are trotters, and if the pacer is recessive, then being a trotter would mean that they have at least one T. So if the mares are TT, then any foal would get a T from them, making the foals Tt, which would be trotters. That makes sense.

So putting this together: the pacer is the recessive trait. The stallion is tt (since he's a pacer and can only pass t). The mares are TT (trotters, so they can only pass T). The foals are Tt, which since T is dominant, they are trotters.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option F says Trotting is dominant (T), stallion is tt, mares are TT, foals are Tt. That's exactly what I concluded.

Another option to check: Option A says Trotting is recessive (t), which would be wrong because then the foals would be Tt, but if T is dominant (pacer), then they would be pacers, which contradicts the outcome. So A is incorrect.

Option G also says Trotting is recessive, so that's out. Option B says pacer is recessive, but the stallion is tt, mares are TT. Foals are tt. Wait, no, because the stallion is tt (so gives t), and mares are TT (give T), foals would be Tt, not tt. So B is wrong.

Option F seems correct. Let me check others just in case.

Option J: Pacing is dominant, stallion TT, mares tt. Foals Tt. So the foals would be pacers if T is dominant. But question says foals are trotters, so J is wrong.

Option E: Trotting is dominant. Stallion Tt, mares TT. Foals TT. But if the stallion is Tt, he could pass T or t. But if mares are TT, they can only pass T. So the foals would be TT (get T from both) or Tt (if stallion gives t). Wait, no, if the stallion is Tt, and mares are TT, the foals would get T from mares and either T or t from stallion. So 50% TT, 50% Tt. But all foals are trotters, which would fit because both TT and Tt would show the dominant trait, which is Trotting. But in this case, the stallion is a pacer, so if pacer is recessive, the stallion would have to be tt. So E's scenario doesn't fit because the stallion is Tt, which would mean he's a trotter if T is dominant. But the stallion is a pacer, so E is wrong.

So yeah, Option F is the correct one.

To determine the pattern of inheritance for the gait trait in horses, we analyze the given information:

1. **Key Observations**:  
   - A stallion from a long line of pacers (pacer) was crossed with mares that were trotters.  
   - All the resulting foals were trotters.  

2. **Genetic Analysis**:  
   - Since all foals are trotters, trotting must be the dominant trait, and pacing must be the recessive trait.  
   - If pacing were dominant, the foals would have shown the pacing trait, as they would inherit at least one dominant allele from the stallion. This contradicts the observation that all foals are trotters.  

3. **Genotype Assignments**:  
   - The stallion, being a pacer, must be homozygous recessive (**tt**), as it can only pass the recessive allele (**t**) to its offspring.  
   - The mares, being trotters, must be homozygous dominant (**TT**), as they can only pass the dominant allele (**T**) to their offspring.  
   - The foals inherit one allele from each parent, resulting in the genotype **Tt**. Since **T** (trotting) is dominant, all foals exhibit the trotting trait.  

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option F** correctly states that trotting is controlled by the dominant gene (**T**), the stallion is **tt**, the mares are **TT**, and the foals are **Tt**.  
   - Other options either misidentify the dominance hierarchy or assign incorrect genotypes based on the observed outcomes.  

Thus, the correct answer is:  

**F: Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.**  

Answer: F
