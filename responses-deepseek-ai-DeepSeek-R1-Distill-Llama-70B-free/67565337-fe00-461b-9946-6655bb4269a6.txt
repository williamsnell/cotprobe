Question:

In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. "In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Options:

A: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.
B: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.
C: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
D: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this real property question about restrictive covenants and whether they run with the land. Let's go through it step by step.

Alright, the facts: In 1996, a developer buys 100 acres and subdivides it into 100 one-acre lots. In 1997, the subdivision plan is recorded. From 1997 onwards, the developer sells 60 lots, each deed including a restriction against mobile homes. Then in 2003, the developer sells the remaining 40 lots to a builder. The deed to the builder includes the same mobile home restriction and is recorded. The builder then sells all 40 lots, but these deeds don't include the restriction. Now, a buyer from the builder puts a mobile home on his lot in 2009. The question is about which statement is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed.

The options are A through D. Let's think about each one.

First, I need to recall the requirements for a restrictive covenant to run with the land. There are a few key elements: the covenant must "touch and concern" the land, there must be privity of estate at the time the covenant is created (usually horizontal privity for the original covenant), and the successor must have notice, either actual or constructive.

In this case, the developer created the subdivision and recorded the plan, which likely includes the restrictive covenants. When the developer sold each lot, the deeds included the restriction. So for the first 60 lots, each buyer is bound by the covenant because it's in their deed, and as subsequent purchasers, they have constructive notice from the recorded deeds.

Now, when the developer sold the remaining 40 lots to the builder in 2003, the deed included the same restriction. So the builder takes the 40 lots with the covenant. But when the builder sells those lots, the deeds don't include the restriction. However, the builder's deed was recorded, so any buyer from the builder should have constructive notice of the restriction because it's in the chain of title.

Wait, but when the builder sells the lots, the deeds don't have the restriction. Does that matter? Because the original covenant was in the subdivision plan and in the developer's deeds, including the one to the builder. So when the builder sells, the buyer's deed might not include it, but the buyer is still bound if the covenant runs with the land.

So the question is about the buyer's deed from the builder. The buyer didn't have the restriction in their deed, but the prior deed (from developer to builder) did. So does the covenant still apply?

I think the key here is whether the covenant runs with the land to subsequent grantees. For it to bind the buyer, the covenant must have been intended to run, which it was since it's in a subdivision and each deed included it. The original covenant was in the developer's deed to the builder, which was recorded. So when the builder sells, the buyer would take subject to the covenant if it runs.

Wait, but if the builder didn't include the restriction in their deed to the buyer, does that affect the enforceability? No, because the covenant is in the chain of title from the developer to the builder, and that was recorded. So the buyer, upon purchasing, would have constructive notice because when they do a title search, they'd find the developer's deed to the builder which includes the restriction.

So the buyer should be bound by the covenant, even though their deed from the builder didn't mention it. Therefore, the statement that is least accurate would be the one that says the buyer's deed doesn't have the restriction. But let's look at the options.

Option A says the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not the buyer. That can't be right because if it runs to the builder, it should continue to run to subsequent purchasers like the buyer.

Option B says the covenant can be enforced by any lot owner. That's likely true because in a subdivision, each lot owner has the right to enforce the covenant against other lot owners.

Option C says the buyer had constructive notice. Since the developer's deed to the builder was recorded, the buyer should have constructive notice, so this is accurate. So the statement that the buyer should have had constructive notice is correct, meaning option C is accurate and not the least accurate.

Option D says all subsequent grantees of the builder are in privity of estate. Wait, privity of estate refers to the relationship between the original covenanting parties and their successors. For a covenant to run, there needs to be privity. So when the developer sells to the builder, there's privity (they're transferring the land), and when the builder sells to the buyer, there's privity again. So all subsequent grantees (like the buyer) are in privity with the builder, who was in privity with the developer. So D seems correct.

Wait, looking back at option A: If the covenant ran with the land to the builder, then it should also run to the buyer. So A is saying it stops at the builder, which would be incorrect. Therefore, option A is the least accurate.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the builder's deed didn't include the restriction, so maybe the covenant doesn't run beyond the builder. Wait no, because the developer's deed to the builder included the restriction, which was recorded. So when the builder conveys, the buyer is a subsequent purchaser and would be bound by the recorded covenant, even if their deed doesn't mention it.

So the covenant runs with the land to the builder and then to the buyer. Therefore, the statement in option A is incorrect because it says it doesn't run to the buyer. So the least accurate statement is A.

To determine which statement is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed, we must analyze the enforceability of the restrictive covenant prohibiting mobile homes. The key issue is whether the covenant runs with the land and binds subsequent purchasers, even if the restriction is not explicitly included in their deed.

### Key Analysis of the Restrictive Covenant
1. **Requirements for a Restrictive Covenant to Run with the Land**:
   - The covenant must "touch and concern" the land.
   - There must be intention for the covenant to run with the land.
   - The successor must have notice (actual or constructive) of the covenant.

2. **Facts and Chain of Title**:
   - The developer recorded the subdivision plan and deeds for the first 60 lots, all of which included the restrictive covenant.
   - The developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to the builder in 2003 via a deed that included the same covenant, which was recorded.
   - The builder sold the 40 lots to subsequent purchasers, but the deeds did not include the covenant. However, the covenant was in the chain of title through the recorded deed from the developer to the builder.

3. **Constructive Notice**:
   - Since the developer's deed to the builder (which included the covenant) was recorded, any subsequent purchaser, including the buyer in question, would have constructive notice of the covenant. This means the buyer is bound by the covenant, even though it was not explicitly included in their deed.

### Evaluation of Each Option
- **Option A**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer."
  - This is incorrect. The covenant runs with the land to the builder and then to the buyer because it is in the chain of title and the buyer has constructive notice.

- **Option B**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner."
  - This is correct. In a subdivision, restrictive covenants are typically enforceable by all lot owners because they are intended to benefit the entire subdivision.

- **Option C**: "The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes."
  - This is correct. The covenant was in the chain of title through the recorded deed from the developer to the builder, giving the buyer constructive notice.

- **Option D**: "All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate."
  - This is correct. The builder and the buyer are in privity of estate, as the buyer purchased the lot directly from the builder.

### Conclusion
The least accurate statement is **Option A**, as the covenant runs with the land to both the builder and the buyer.
