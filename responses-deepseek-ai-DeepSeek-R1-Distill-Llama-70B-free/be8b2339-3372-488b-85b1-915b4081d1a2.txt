Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture containing dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile (AN). The relative intensities of the lines are α and 3α for each respectively. And the question is asking for the ratio of their concentrations, [DMSO]:[AN].

Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the intensity of a signal is proportional to the number of protons causing that signal. So if two compounds are present, the ratio of their signal intensities would relate to the number of protons each contributes, multiplied by their concentrations.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about each compound's structure.

DMSO is (CH3)2SO. The structure is such that the two methyl groups are attached to the sulfur. Each methyl group has three protons, and since there are two methyl groups, that's 6 protons in total. But wait, in DMSO, are these methyl groups split into different signals? I think in DMSO, the two methyl groups are equivalent because the molecule is symmetrical. So in the NMR, DMSO shows as a single peak, right? And that peak corresponds to all six protons. So the integration for DMSO would be 6 protons.

Then, acetonitrile is CH3CN. The structure is a methyl group attached to a nitrile. The methyl group has three equivalent protons. So in the NMR, AN would show as a single peak integrating to 3 protons.

Wait, but wait. The question says the relative intensities are α and 3α for DMSO and AN, respectively. Or is it the other way around? Let me check the question again.

Oh, no! Wait, the question says the lines have relative intensities α and 3α, respectively. So I think the first compound (DMSO) has intensity α, and the second (AN) has 3α. Or wait, no, the way the question is phrased: the lines are for the mixture, so each line corresponds to each compound. So the DMSO line has intensity α, and the AN line has 3α.

So, the intensity ratio is DMSO:AN = α : 3α. But wait, no, the question says "lines with relative intensities α and 3α, respectively." So the first line (maybe DMSO) is α, and the second (AN) is 3α. Or maybe it's the other way around? I think so, because the wording says "of a mixture... contains lines with relative intensities α and 3α, respectively." So the two substances each contribute their own lines, so DMSO has intensity α, AN has 3α.

But wait, I might have that backwards. The order is important. So the mixture contains DMSO and AN. The spectrum has lines from each. Let's say, DMSO's line is at some chemical shift, and AN's at another. So the intensity of DMSO's peak is α, and AN's is 3α.

But wait, I thought DMSO has more protons. Let me think again: DMSO has 6 H, AN has 3 H.

In NMR, the area under each peak (the integration) is proportional to the number of protons. So for DMSO, each molecule contributes 6 H, and for AN, each contributes 3 H.

Let me denote the concentration of DMSO as [D], and AN as [A].

The intensity from DMSO would be proportional to [D] * 6.

The intensity from AN would be proportional to [A] * 3.

According to the problem, the intensity of DMSO is α, and AN is 3α.

Wait no, the problem states that the lines have intensities α and 3α. So if DMSO's line is α, then:

α ∝ [D] * 6.

Similarly, 3α ∝ [A] * 3.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The intensity for DMSO is α, so:

Intensity (DMSO) = 6 * [D]

Intensity (AN) = 3 * [A]

And according to the problem, Intensity (DMSO) = α, Intensity (AN) = 3α.

So:

6 [D] = α,

3 [A] = 3α.

Wait, let me write equations.

Let me denote:

I_D = 6 [D] = α,

I_AN = 3 [A] = 3α.

Wait, but the way the problem states the intensities, I think I might have misread. Because the "relative intensities" could be the ratio between the two. So the intensity of DMSO is α, and that of AN is 3α. So the ratio I_D : I_AN = α : 3α = 1:3.

But since I_D =6 [D], I_AN =3 [A], then:

(6 [D]) / (3 [A]) ) = (α)/(3α) ) = 1/3.

So:

(6 [D])/(3 [A]) = 1/3.

Simplify numerator: 6/3 = 2, so 2 [D]/[A] = 1/3.

Multiply both sides by [A]:

2 [D] = (1/3) [A]

Wait, no. Let me solve:

6 [D] / 3 [A] = 1/3.

Divide both sides by 3 [A]:

(6 [D])/(3 [A]) = 2 [D]/[A] = 1/3.

So, 2 [D]/[A] = 1/3.

Multiply both sides by [A]:

2 [D] = (1/3) [A].

Then, [D] = (1/3 [A])/2 = [A]/6.

So, [D] : [A] = [A]/6 : [A] = (1/6) :1 = 1:6.

Wait, that would mean the ratio of DMSO to AN is 1:6. But looking at the options, option B is 1:6.

Wait, but let me check that again.

Another approach: Let's express [D] and [A] in terms of α.

From I_D = 6 [D] = α → [D] = α /6.

From I_AN =3 [A] =3 α → [A] = (3 α)/3 = α.

So [D] = α/6, [A] = α.

So the ratio [D] : [A] is (α/6) : α → (1/6) :1 → 1:6.

So the answer would be 1:6, which is option B.

But wait, wait another moment. Let me think about what the relative intensities mean.

The "relative intensities" could refer to the ratio between the areas of the peaks. So if DMSO's peak has area α and AN's has 3α, then the ratio of areas is α:3α = 1:3.

Each area is proportional to number of H's multiplied by concentration.

So area DMSO = 6 [D] = α,

area AN =3 [A] =3α.

So 6 [D] = α → [D] = α/6.

3 [A] =3α → [A] = α.

So [D]/[A] = (α/6)/α = 1/6 → [D]:[A] =1:6.

So the correct answer is option B, 1:6.

The question involves determining the ratio of concentrations, [DMSO]:[AN], based on the relative intensities of their respective peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. The relative intensities are given as α for DMSO and 3α for acetonitrile (AN). 

In 1H NMR, the intensity of a peak is proportional to the number of protons contributing to that peak, multiplied by the concentration of the compound. 

1. **DMSO**: The structure of DMSO is (CH3)2SO, where the two methyl groups are equivalent. Each methyl group contributes 3 protons, so DMSO has a total of 6 equivalent protons. The intensity of the DMSO peak is proportional to \( 6[DMSO] \), where \([DMSO]\) is the concentration of DMSO. From the problem, the intensity of DMSO is given as \( \alpha \), so:
   \[
   6[DMSO] = \alpha \implies [DMSO] = \frac{\alpha}{6}.
   \]

2. **Acetonitrile (AN)**: The structure of AN is CH3CN, where the methyl group contributes 3 equivalent protons. The intensity of the AN peak is proportional to \( 3[AN] \), where \([AN]\) is the concentration of AN. From the problem, the intensity of AN is given as \( 3\alpha \), so:
   \[
   3[AN] = 3\alpha \implies [AN] = \alpha.
   \]

3. **Ratio of Concentrations**: The ratio of concentrations \([DMSO]:[AN]\) is:
   \[
   [DMSO]:[AN] = \frac{\alpha}{6} : \alpha = \frac{1}{6} : 1 = 1:6.
   \]

Thus, the ratio of the concentrations of DMSO to AN is **1:6**.

The correct answer is:

**B: 1:6**
