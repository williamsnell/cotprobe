Okay, so I've got this biology question about meiosis and crossing-over. Hmm, I remember that meiosis is the type of cell division that results in gametes, like sperm and eggs. Crossing-over is a process that happens during meiosis I, right? It's when the homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange segments. This must increase genetic variation because it shuffles the genes around.

The question is asking what crossing-over permits scientists to determine. The options are A through J. Let me think about each option.

Option A: The rate of mutations. I don't think crossing-over causes mutations; it's more about recombination of existing genes. So this is probably not the right answer.

Option B: The chance for variation in zygotes. Oh wait, crossing-over does increase variation by creating new combinations of alleles. So this might be a possible answer, but the question is what it allows scientists to determine. So maybe it's about genetic mapping or something else.

Option C: The age of an organism. I don't see a direct link between crossing-over and aging. Maybe telomeres or something, but that's not related here.

Option D: The potential for genetic disorders. I'm not sure. Some disorders are due to chromosomal issues, but crossing-over itself is a normal process. Maybe it's not about determining the potential.

Option E: The sequence of DNA bases. That's more about DNA sequencing techniques, not crossing-over.

Option F: The rate of cell division. Doesn't seem related. Crossing-over happens during meiosis, but I don't think it's used to measure how fast cells divide.

Option G: The number of chromosomes in a cell. That's more about karyotyping or counting during metaphase.

Option H: Which traits are dominant or recessive. That's determined through Mendelian genetics and punnett squares, not directly via crossing-over.

Option I: The sex of an organism. Sex is determined by chromosomes like XX or XY, but crossing-over isn't used to determine sex.

Option J: The distance between genes on a chromosome. Oh wait, I remember something about genetic maps and linkage. Because during crossing-over, the closer two genes are on a chromosome, the less likely they are to be separated. So the frequency of crossing-over can be used to determine the distance between genes. That's how genetic maps are made.

Wait, so the question is what crossing-over allows us to determine. So if crossing-over frequency is used to map the distance between genes, then option J would be the correct answer. Because the further apart two genes are, the higher the chance of crossing-over between them. So by measuring the recombination frequency, we can determine how far apart the genes are on the chromosome.

So the correct answer should be J: the distance between genes on a chromosome.

Crossing-over during meiosis is a process where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, increasing genetic variation. The question asks what crossing-over permits scientists to determine. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Crossing-over does not measure mutation rates.  
- **B**: While crossing-over increases variation, the question focuses on what it allows scientists to determine, not its effect on variation.  
- **C**: Age determination is unrelated to crossing-over.  
- **D**: Crossing-over is a normal process and does not directly determine the potential for genetic disorders.  
- **E**: DNA sequencing determines base sequences, not crossing-over.  
- **F**: Crossing-over does not measure cell division rates.  
- **G**: Chromosome counting is done through karyotyping, not crossing-over.  
- **H**: Dominance or recessiveness is determined through Mendelian genetics, not crossing-over.  
- **I**: Sex determination involves chromosomal analysis, not crossing-over.  
- **J**: Crossing-over frequency is used to measure the distance between genes on a chromosome, as closer genes are less likely to recombine. This is the basis for constructing genetic maps.

Thus, crossing-over allows scientists to determine the distance between genes on a chromosome.

Answer: J
