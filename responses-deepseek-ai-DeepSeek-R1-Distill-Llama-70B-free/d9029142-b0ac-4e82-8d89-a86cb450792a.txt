Question:

Let 12-9+c=12. What value of c makes the equation true?

Options:

A: 15

F: -9
G: -3
H: 6
I: 9
J: 1

Answer:
    <think>


Let's solve the equation step by step.

Given the equation:
\[ 12 - 9 + c = 12 \]

First, simplify the left side:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \]
So the equation becomes:
\[ 3 + c = 12 \]

To isolate \( c \), subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ c = 12 - 3 \]
\[ c = 9 \]

Now, compare this result with the provided options. The value \( c = 9 \) corresponds to option **I**.

Answer: I
