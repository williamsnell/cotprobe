Question:

Sometimes, when the percentages in a discount series are familiar fractions, such as 33(1/2)% = (1/3) , 12(1/2)% = (1/8) or 6(1/4)% = (1/16) you can solve the problem more easily if you change the order of the discounting. What is the net amount you get from (a) $63.60 less 16(2/3)% and 10% (b) $126.00 less 2% and 66(2/3)%?

Options:

A: $54.24, $44.52
B: $50.88, $37.80
C: $47.70, $41.16
D: $53.00, $42.00
E: $5.30, $0.84
F: $48.96, $38.88
G: $42.84, $39.06
H: $45.30, $43.20
I: $60.00, $40.00
J: $10.60, $84.00

Okay, so I've got this problem here about discounts, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is.

The question is asking about the net amount after applying a series of discounts. There are two parts, (a) and (b), each with different starting amounts and discount percentages. The hint says that when the discounts are familiar fractions, you can change the order of discounting to make it easier. I remember that sometimes applying discounts in a different order can simplify the calculation, especially when dealing with fractions that are easy to work with.

Let's break down each part.

Starting with part (a): $63.60 less 16(2/3)% and then 10%. Hmm. So first I need to figure out what 16(2/3)% is as a fraction. 16 and 2/3 percent. Well, 16 is 16/1, so 16 and 2/3 is 16 + 2/3 = 50/3 percent. Wait, because 16 is 48/3, plus 2/3 is 50/3, so 50/3%. To convert that to a decimal, 50/3 is approximately 16.666...%. But maybe it's easier to think in fractions. Let me think: 16(2/3)% is the same as 1/6, because 1/6 is about 16.666...%. Right, because 1 divided by 6 is 0.1666..., so 16.666... percent.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check that. 1/6 is 0.1666..., so 16.666... percent. So 16(2/3)% equals 1/6. So taking 1/6 off means the remaining is 5/6. So the first discount is 16(2/3)%, which is 1/6, so the remaining is 5/6 of the original amount.

Then the second discount is 10%, which is 0.10, so the remaining after that would be 90%, or 9/10.

So the total discount would be 5/6 multiplied by 9/10, right? Because each discount is applied one after the other. Wait, but wait the hint says that sometimes you can change the order of discounting if the fractions are familiar. So perhaps it's easier to multiply them in a different order.

Wait, 5/6 and 9/10. Let me compute that. 5/6 * 9/10 is (5*9)/(6*10) = 45/60 = 3/4. So 3/4 of the original amount. Because 5/6 * 9/10 equals 3/4. So 3/4 is 75%, so the net amount is 75% of $63.60.

Let me calculate that. 75% of 63.60 is 0.75 * 63.60. Let's do that.

63.60 * 0.75: Let's break it down. 63 * 0.75 is 47.25, and 0.60 * 0.75 is 0.45. So total is 47.25 + 0.45 = 47.70. So part (a)'s answer is $47.70.

Now moving to part (b): $126.00 less 2% and 66(2/3)%. Hmm. Let me see, 66(2/3)% is 66.666...%, which I think is 2/3 as a fraction. Because 2/3 is approximately 0.666..., so 66.666... percent is 2/3. So 66(2/3)% is 2/3. So the discount is 2/3, so the remaining is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

The other discount is 2%, which is 0.02, so the remaining is 98%, or 49/50 (since 2% is 0.02, so 98% is 0.98, which is 49/50 as a fraction).

So the total discounting factor is 49/50 multiplied by 1/3. Alternatively, since multiplication is commutative, I can do 1/3 * 49/50 which is 49/150. Let me compute that. 49 divided by 150. So 49/150 is approximately 0.326666..., so 32.666... percent of the original amount remains.

Wait, wait, no, I think I messed up. Because 2% is 2 per 100, so 2% off means you pay 98%, which is 98/100 or 49/50. So applying 2% discount and then 66(2/3)% discount would mean:

First, 2% off: 49/50 of the original.

Then, 66(2/3)% off, which is 2/3 off, so you're left with 1/3 of that.

So the total factor is 49/50 * 1/3 = (49)/(150) = 0.326666... So 32.666...% of $126.00.

Let me compute that. 126 * 49/150. Hmm, let me simplify the calculation.

Alternatively, I can compute 126 * (49/150) as (126/150) *49. 126 divided by 150 is 0.84. So 0.84 *49. Let me compute 0.8 *49 = 39.2, and 0.04 *49=1.96. So 39.2 +1.96 =41.16. So the net amount is $41.16.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, since 66(2/3)% is 2/3, which is same as 50% more than half. So perhaps the order can be changed. Since 2% and 66(2/3)% are applied, perhaps it's easier to compute 2% first or 66% first, but I think the way I did it is correct.

So part (a) is $47.70 and part (b) is $41.16.

Looking at the options, option C is (a) $47.70, (b) $41.16. Let me check the options:

Option C: $47.70, $41.16. So that's our answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. Did I get the order right? Because sometimes changing the order of discounts might change the result, but the problem says that when they're familiar fractions, you can change the order to make it easier. So perhaps in part (b), I can apply the 1/3 first and then the 49/50.

Wait, if I switch the order, let's see: 126 * (1/3) is 42, then 42 less 2% is 42 * 0.98 = 41.16. So same result. So the order doesn't affect the final amount because multiplication is commutative. So yeah, same answer.

So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the net amount after applying the discounts in each part. The discounts are given as percentages, and we convert them into fractions or decimals for easier computation. The key is to recognize that the order of applying discounts does not affect the final result due to the commutative property of multiplication.

### Part (a): $63.60 less 16(2/3)% and 10%
1. **Convert 16(2/3)% to a fraction**:  
   \( 16\frac{2}{3}\% = \frac{50}{3}\% = \frac{1}{6} \).  
   This means the remaining amount after this discount is \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \).

2. **Convert 10% to a fraction**:  
   \( 10\% = \frac{10}{100} = \frac{9}{10} \).  
   This means the remaining amount after this discount is \( 1 - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{9}{10} \).

3. **Combine the discounts**:  
   The total discounting factor is \( \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{9}{10} = \frac{45}{60} = \frac{3}{4} \).  
   Thus, the net amount is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 63.60 = 0.75 \times 63.60 = 47.70 \).

### Part (b): $126.00 less 2% and 66(2/3)%
1. **Convert 2% to a fraction**:  
   \( 2\% = \frac{2}{100} = \frac{49}{50} \).  
   This means the remaining amount after this discount is \( 1 - \frac{49}{50} = \frac{49}{50} \).

2. **Convert 66(2/3)% to a fraction**:  
   \( 66\frac{2}{3}\% = \frac{200}{3}\% = \frac{2}{3} \).  
   This means the remaining amount after this discount is \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Combine the discounts**:  
   The total discounting factor is \( \frac{49}{50} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{49}{150} \).  
   Thus, the net amount is \( \frac{49}{150} \times 126 = 0.326666 \times 126 = 41.16 \).

### Final Answer:
The net amounts are:  
(a) $47.70 and (b) $41.16.  

From the given options, the correct choice is **C: $47.70, $41.16**.
