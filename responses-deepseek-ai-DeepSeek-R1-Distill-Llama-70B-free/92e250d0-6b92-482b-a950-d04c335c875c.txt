Okay, so I've got this problem about a Michelson interferometer being used to measure the separation of a doublet in atomic emission lines. Hmm, I remember that Michelson interferometers are used for things like measuring wavelengths and their differences. Let me think about what I know.

The question says that the average wavelength is 676 nm. So the two lines are around this value, probably one a bit higher and one a bit lower. The periodic variations in fringe contrast happen when one mirror is moved 0.44 mm. I think this movement relates to the path difference causing constructive and destructive interference.

Wait, in a Michelson interferometer, when you move a mirror, you change the path difference. The fringe contrast depends on the coherence of the light. For two wavelengths, the fringes will periodically go from high contrast (when both wavelengths are in phase) to low contrast (when their phases interfere destructively). So the periodicity is related to the difference in wavelengths, I guess.

I remember something about the condition for constructive interference. The path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength. But here, since it's a doublet, there are two wavelengths, λ1 and λ2. The variation in the fringe contrast happens when the path difference changes by a certain amount—specifically, the coherence length or something related.

Wait, the formula I think I need is the relation between the movement of the mirror (which introduces a path difference Δ) and the change in the number of fringes. Or maybe it's the condition for the two wavelengths to interfere constructively again after moving the mirror. Oh right, when the mirror moves a distance d, the path difference changes by 2d (since the light goes to the mirror and back). So the change in path difference is 2d.

The periodic variations occur when moving through a distance where the phase changes cause the contrast to repeat. I think the formula is that the distance moved (d) relates to the difference in wavelengths (Δλ) and the average wavelength (λ_avg) by the equation d = (λ_avg^2) / (2 Δλ). Or wait, maybe it's something like d = (Δλ * λ_avg) / (2) ? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The path difference that causes a change in the interference from maximum to minimum and back would be when each wavelength goes through an integer plus a half-integer number of cycles. But for the doublet, the condition for the fringes to repeat their contrast is when the path difference is such that the phase difference for each wavelength causes them to interfere constructively again. Or perhaps when the path difference is an integer multiple of the average wavelength? I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, I've heard of the concept of fringe spacing and how moving the mirror affects the number of fringes passing a point. But this is about the contrast varying periodically, which I think relates to the coherence length. Wait, the coherence length is the path difference over which the phase relationship is lost. But in this problem, the movement causing the periodic variation might be related to the beat wavelength or something.

Wait, another approach. The separation between the two emission lines is the difference in their wavelengths, say δλ = λ2 - λ1. The average wavelength is (λ1 + λ2)/2 = 676 nm. So λ1 = 676 - δλ/2 and λ2 = 676 + δλ/2.

The problem states that when the mirror is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm, the fringe contrast varies periodically. So the distance the mirror moves (d) is 0.44 mm, which is 440 micrometers or 440,000 nm.

Wait, I think the condition is that the change in path difference corresponds to the point where the two wavelengths interfere constructively again. So the path difference (2d, because moving the mirror by d changes the path by 2d) should be equal to an integer multiple of the average wavelength, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be that the path difference causes the two wavelengths to have gone through an integer number of wavelengths plus a half, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another thought: when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, you get constructive interference. But for two wavelengths, the condition for the fringes to have maximum contrast is when the path difference is a multiple of both λ1 and λ2. But since λ1 and λ2 are close, that's only possible when the path difference is a common multiple of both, which would be related to their least common multiple. But since the wavelengths are close, their LCM is approximated by 1/(difference in wavelengths), perhaps.

Wait, I think the formula I need is that when the mirror moves a distance d, the path difference is 2d. The maximum contrast occurs when 2d = m * λ_avg, where m is an integer. Wait, but that might be for a single wavelength. For a doublet, the periodicity comes from the beat frequency between the two wavelengths.

Alternatively, the formula might be that the distance moved, d, causes a change in the optical path difference (OPD) of 2d. The condition for the contrast to repeat (like going back to a similar state) is when this OPD is equal to the wavelength of the average, divided by the fractional difference. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I remember that the relation between the mirror movement and the wavelength separation is given by δλ = λ²/(2d), where d is the distance moved. Let me check if that makes sense. So δλ is the difference in wavelength, λ is the average wavelength, and d is the mirror movement.

So plugging in the numbers: d=0.44 mm = 0.44e-3 m = 440,000 nm. λ is 676 nm. So δλ = (676 nm)^2 / (2 * 440,000 nm) = ?

Let's compute that. 676^2 is 676 * 676. Let me calculate that. 600^2=360000, 70^2=4900, 6^2=36, and cross terms: 2*(600*70)=84000, 2*(600*6)=7200, 2*(70*6)=840.

Wait, 676 squared is (600 + 76)^2 = 600² + 2*600*76 + 76². So 600²=360000, 2*600*76=2*45600=91200, 76²=5776. So total is 360000 + 91200 = 451200 +5776=456,976 nm².

So δλ = 456976 / (2*440000) = 456976 / 880000 ≈ 0.519 nm.

Wait, 456976 / 880000.

Let me compute that: 456976 ÷ 880000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 28561 / 55000. Hmm, that's about 0.519. So δλ ≈ 0.519 nm.

Wait, that's the separation between the two wavelengths. So the two wavelengths are 676 ± (0.519/2) nm.

Because δλ is λ2 - λ1. So each is offset by δλ/2 from the average.

Wait, wait. If the average is (λ1 + λ2)/2 = 676, and δλ=λ2-λ1=0.519 nm, then:

λ1 = 676 - (0.519/2) = 676 - 0.2595 = 675.7405 nm.

λ2 = 676 + 0.2595 = 676.2595 nm.

So approximately 675.74 nm and 676.26 nm.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 675.74 nm and 676.26 nm. That matches.

So the correct answer is option A.

To determine the two wavelengths of the doublet, we use the relationship between the mirror movement in a Michelson interferometer and the wavelength separation of the doublet. The average wavelength is given as \( \lambda_{\text{avg}} = 676 \, \text{nm} \), and the mirror is moved a distance \( d = 0.44 \, \text{mm} = 440,000 \, \text{nm} \). The formula relating these quantities is:

\[
\delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda_{\text{avg}}^2}{2d}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\delta \lambda = \frac{676^2}{2 \times 440,000}
\]

First, calculate \( 676^2 \):

\[
676^2 = 456,976 \, \text{nm}^2
\]

Now divide by \( 2 \times 440,000 \):

\[
\delta \lambda = \frac{456,976}{880,000} \approx 0.519 \, \text{nm}
\]

This is the wavelength separation between the two lines. Since the average wavelength is \( 676 \, \text{nm} \), the two wavelengths are:

\[
\lambda_1 = \lambda_{\text{avg}} - \frac{\delta \lambda}{2}, \quad \lambda_2 = \lambda_{\text{avg}} + \frac{\delta \lambda}{2}
\]

Substituting \( \delta \lambda = 0.519 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
\lambda_1 = 676 - \frac{0.519}{2} = 676 - 0.2595 = 675.7405 \, \text{nm}
\]
\[
\lambda_2 = 676 + \frac{0.519}{2} = 676 + 0.2595 = 676.2595 \, \text{nm}
\]

Thus, the two wavelengths are approximately \( 675.74 \, \text{nm} \) and \( 676.26 \, \text{nm} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A: 675.74 nm and 676.26 nm**
