Okay, so I have this problem about cascaded amplifiers and noise temperature. Hmm, I remember that when amplifiers are cascaded, their noise performance isn't just the sum of their individual noise temperatures. I think it's something to do with the gains and each stage's noise contributing less as you go along.

So the problem gives me three stages with their power gains and effective noise temperatures. The gains are G1=15, G2=10, G3=5. The noise temps are Te1=1350K, Te2=1700K, Te3=2500K.

Part (a) asks for the overall effective noise temperature. I'm pretty sure the formula for the total effective noise temperature when you have cascaded stages is something like:

Te_total = Te1 + (Te2 - 1)/(G1) + (Te3 - 1)/(G1*G2)

Wait, wait, no, maybe it's (Te2)/(G1) and Te3/(G1*G2), because each subsequent stage's noise is divided by the product of the gains of all the previous stages. So the formula would sum each stage's noise contribution.

Wait, no, the formula is:

Te_total = Te1 + (Te2)/(G1) + (Te3)/(G1*G2)

Because each stage's noise is multiplied by the inverse of the product of the gains before it. So the first stage contributes Te1, the second contributes Te2 divided by G1, and the third Te3 divided by G1*G2.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Another approach: the noise factor for each stage. Oh wait, the noise factor F is related to Te, where F = 1 + Te/(290K), but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Wait, the formula for the overall noise temperature when stages are cascaded is:

Te_total = Te1 + Te2/(G1) + Te3/(G1*G2)

Yes, that sounds right. Because the second stage's noise is reduced by the gain of the first, and the third's by both G1 and G2.

So plugging the numbers in:

Te1 =1350

Te2/(G1)=1700/15 ≈ 113.333

Te3/(G1*G2)=2500/(15*10)=2500/150≈16.6667

So adding them up: 1350 + 113.333 + 16.6667 ≈ 1480 K.

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking at the options, option C is 1480K, highest gain first. Option A is 1480K, lowest gain first.

But wait, the second part of the question is about the ordering to achieve optimal noise performance. So the ordering affects the overall noise temperature.

Wait, so for part (b), we need to arrange the stages in the order that minimizes the overall noise temperature.

I remember that to minimize the total noise, the stages with higher gains should come first. Because the noise of the subsequent stages is divided by higher gains, thus contributing less.

So the optimal arrangement is to have the highest gain first, then next highest, and so on. So the order should be G1=15 first, then G2=10, then G3=5. Wait, but the given gains are G1=15, G2=10, G3=5. So if we leave them in that order, that's highest gain first. But maybe the question is considering a different arrangement.

Wait, but the problem gives the gains as G1=15, G2=10, G3=5. So in the given order, it's arranged from highest to lowest gain. So for the overall noise temp, if we arrange them as highest gain first, the noise contributions from the latter stages are minimized.

So in the current order, the overall Te is 1480K. But if we arrange them differently, what happens? Let's see.

Suppose we rearrange the stages. Let's consider all possible orders and calculate Te_total for each.

But that would take a lot of time, but perhaps we can reason it out.

The formula is:

Te_total = Te1 + Te2/(G1) + Te3/(G1*G2)

But the order of the stages affects which Te is where and the gains' multiplicative factors.

Wait, when we reorder the stages, the gains and their corresponding Te's are permuted.

So, for example, if we arrange the stages as stage2 first, then stage1, then stage3, what would happen.

Wait, but the problem asks for the ordering to achieve optimum noise performance, which is when the total Te is minimized.

The way to minimize Te_total is to have the highest gain stage first. Because the stages after contribute less due to being divided by higher gains.

So the optimal order is highest gain first.

Given that, the current order is G1=15, G2=10, G3=5. So that's already highest gain first. So the overall Te is 1480K, and the optimal arrangement is highest gain first.

Looking at the options, option C is 1480K, highest gain first. So for part (a), the overall effective noise temperature is 1480K, and part (b) the ordering is highest gain first.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but option C says "highest gain first." But wait, the given stages are in order G1, G2, G3, which is 15, 10,5, which is indeed highest first.

So the answer for (a) is 1480K and (b) highest gain first.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1480K, highest gain first. That's the correct one.

To determine the overall effective noise temperature and the optimal ordering of the cascaded amplifier stages, we use the formula for the total effective noise temperature of cascaded stages:

\[
T_{e,\text{total}} = T_{e1} + \frac{T_{e2}}{G_1} + \frac{T_{e3}}{G_1 \cdot G_2}
\]

### Given Data:
- Power gains: \( G_1 = 15 \), \( G_2 = 10 \), \( G_3 = 5 \)
- Effective noise temperatures: \( T_{e1} = 1350 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{e2} = 1700 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{e3} = 2500 \, \text{K} \)

### Part (a): Overall Effective Noise Temperature
Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
T_{e,\text{total}} = 1350 + \frac{1700}{15} + \frac{2500}{15 \cdot 10}
\]

1. \( \frac{1700}{15} \approx 113.333 \, \text{K} \)
2. \( \frac{2500}{150} \approx 16.667 \, \text{K} \)

Adding these contributions:

\[
T_{e,\text{total}} = 1350 + 113.333 + 16.667 \approx 1480 \, \text{K}
\]

Thus, the overall effective noise temperature is approximately \( 1480 \, \text{K} \).

### Part (b): Optimal Ordering of Stages
To achieve optimal noise performance, the stages should be arranged such that the highest gain stage comes first. This minimizes the noise contribution of subsequent stages, as their noise temperatures are divided by the product of the gains of all preceding stages. 

The given order of stages (\( G_1 = 15 \), \( G_2 = 10 \), \( G_3 = 5 \)) already follows the optimal arrangement, with the highest gain first.

### Final Answer:
- Overall effective noise temperature: \( 1480 \, \text{K} \)
- Optimal ordering: Highest gain first

From the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C: 1480K, highest gain first**
