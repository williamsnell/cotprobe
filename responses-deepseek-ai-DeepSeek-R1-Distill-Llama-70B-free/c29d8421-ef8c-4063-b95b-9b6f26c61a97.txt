Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. So, Alex is placing paving stones in a path. The first stone is placed by starting at the crate, walking three feet, placing the stone, and then returning to the crate. For each subsequent stone, Alex walks two feet farther each way. And the question is asking, after placing the 50th stone, what's the total distance Alex walked?

Hmm, I think I need to break this down. Let's start by understanding the pattern here. The first stone is placed after walking 3 feet, then returning, so that's 3 each way, which makes 6 feet total. 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, when he places the first stone, he walks three feet, places it, then returns. So that's 3 feet going out, and 3 feet coming back. So that's 6 feet for the first stone.

Then, for the second stone, he walks two feet farther each way. So that would be 3 + 2 = 5 feet each way. So going out and back would be 5 * 2 = 10 feet. 

Wait, no, the problem says "walks two feet farther each way". Oh, wait, no, wait. The problem says "walks two feet farther each way" for each subsequent stone. So the first stone is 3 feet each way. The second is 3 + 2 = 5 each way. The third would be 5 + 2 = 7 each way, and so on.

Wait, no, no. Wait, let me read it again. It says, "For each subsequent stone, Alex walks two feet farther each way." So for the first stone, it's 3 feet each way. The second stone, he walks 3 + 2 = 5 each way. The third stone, 5 + 2 = 7 each way. So each time, the distance each way increases by 2 feet. So, for each stone after the first, the distance per trip increases by 2 each way.

Wait, but wait, the first stone is 3 feet each way, so 6 feet round trip. The second stone is 5 each way, round trip 10. The third is 7 each way, round trip 14. So I see a pattern here. Each stone after the first adds 4 feet to the round trip distance because each way increases by 2, so round trip is 4 more each time.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The round trip for the first stone is 3 out, 3 back: 6 total. Second stone is 5 each way: 10. So that's 4 more than the first. Third is 7 each way: 14, which is 4 more than the second. So each stone's round trip distance increases by 4 feet compared to the previous one.

So the round trip distances form an arithmetic sequence where the first term (for the first stone) is 6, and each subsequent term increases by 4.

So for the first 50 stones, the total distance is the sum of this arithmetic sequence from n=1 to n=50.

Let me recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum S of the first n terms is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term and d is the common difference.

In this case, a = 6, d = 4, and n =50.

So substituting:

S = 50/2 * (2*6 + (50-1)*4)
S = 25 * (12 + 49*4)
Wait, 49*4 is 196, so 12 + 196 is 208.

So 25 * 208. Let me calculate that. 25 times 200 is 5000, and 25 times 8 is 200, so total 5200.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, using another formula: S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the nth term.

So the 50th term a50 is a1 + (n-1)d. a1 is 6, so a50 =6 +49*4=6+196=202.

Then sum S=50*(6 +202)/2 =50*(208)/2=50*104=5200.

Wait, so the total distance is 5200 feet.

Looking at the options, option H is 5200. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me think through the steps again.

First stone: 3 ft each way, round trip 6.

Second: 5 each way, 10.

Third:7 each way, 14.

This is an arithmetic sequence with a=6, d=4. So the sequence is 6,10,14,... up to 50 terms.

Sum formula: S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d].

Plugging in the numbers: n=50, a=6, d=4.

So S=50/2 [12 + 49*4]

49*4=196; 12+196=208.

50/2=25; 25*208=5200. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer is H: 5200.

To determine the total distance Alex walked after placing the 50th stone, we analyze the pattern of his movements. For the first stone, Alex walks 3 feet each way, resulting in a round trip of 6 feet. For each subsequent stone, the distance each way increases by 2 feet, making the round trip distance increase by 4 feet each time. This forms an arithmetic sequence where:

- The first term \( a = 6 \) (round trip for the first stone),
- The common difference \( d = 4 \),
- The number of terms \( n = 50 \).

The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \left[ 2a + (n-1)d \right]
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
S = \frac{50}{2} \left[ 2(6) + (50-1)(4) \right]
\]

\[
S = 25 \left[ 12 + 196 \right]
\]

\[
S = 25 \times 208 = 5200
\]

Thus, the total distance Alex walked after placing the 50th stone is 5200 feet. The correct answer is:

**H: 5200**
