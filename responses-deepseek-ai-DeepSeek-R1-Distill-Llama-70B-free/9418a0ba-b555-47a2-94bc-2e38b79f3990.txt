Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about bending a tree branch by hanging on its end. I'm supposed to figure out what the top side of the branch is under. The options are various forces and stresses, so I need to recall what happens when a branch bends.

Hmm, when you hang on a branch, you're applying a force at the end, causing it to bend. I remember that when a material bends, it's experiencing some kind of stress. Stress is the internal force that resists the deformation. But wait, what kind of stress is this exactly?

I think when a branch bends, it's under something called bending stress. Bending stress is a type of mechanical stress caused by the external load, which in this case is my weight hanging from the branch. So the branch is under bending, which would mean bending stress is involved.

Wait, but the question is about the top side. When a branch bends, the top part is being stretched, and the bottom part is being compressed. Oh right, because the top is getting longer, so it's under tension, while the bottom is squashed, so compression there.

So the question is asking about the top side. So the top is experiencing tension. But let me make sure. Tension is a pulling force, so when you bend something, the outer side stretches and feels tension. So when I hang from the branch, the top of the branch (the convex side) is in tension.

Wait, but the answer options include compression, tension, bending stress, etc. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:
A: Friction.
B: Neither.
C: tension.
D: Normal force.
E: compression.
F: Strain.
G: Bending stress.
H: Torsion.
I: Shear stress.
J: Both.

So the top side is under tension. Therefore, the answer should be C: tension.

Wait, but I thought about bending stress too. Bending stress is a combination of both tension and compression. But the question is specifically about the top side. So the top side experiences tension, the bottom experiences compression, and overall, the branch experiences bending stress.

But the question is phrased as: the top side is under what? So the correct answer should be tension, which is option C.

I think I'm confident with that. So the answer should be C.

When you bend a tree branch by hanging from its end, the branch experiences bending stress, which involves two types of internal forces: tension on the outer (convex) side and compression on the inner (concave) side. Specifically, the top side of the branch, being the outer side, is stretched and therefore under tension.

The correct answer is **C: tension**.
