Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these entropy and enthalpy calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about the entropy change of the surroundings when chloroform vaporizes. The data given is the enthalpy of vaporization, which is 29.4 kJ/mol at its normal boiling point of 334.88 K. Hmm, I think I remember that the entropy change of the surroundings is related to the heat transfer during a reversible process.

Wait, right, when a substance is vaporizing at its boiling point, it's a phase change, so it's a reversible process at constant temperature. That makes sense. So for a reversible process at constant temperature, the entropy change is calculated by dividing the heat by the temperature.

But wait, the enthalpy of vaporization is the heat absorbed by the system, right? So for the system (chloroform), the enthalpy change ΔH is positive because it's vaporizing (endothermic). But the surroundings are losing that heat, so their entropy change would be negative because they're losing energy.

The formula I think is ΔS = q_rev / T. But since the surroundings are losing heat, q_surroundings is negative. So the entropy change for the surroundings is -ΔH_vap / T.

Wait, no, wait. The system gains heat (q = +ΔH), so the surroundings lose that same amount (q = -ΔH). So the entropy change for surroundings is q_surroundings divided by T. That would be (-ΔH) / T.

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of vaporization is the amount of heat absorbed at constant pressure. So for the system, q = +ΔH_vap. So for the surroundings, q = -ΔH_vap.

So entropy change of surroundings, ΔS_surr = q / T = (-ΔH_vap) / T.

But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. At constant pressure, the heat of vaporization is q = ΔH. Since the process is reversible, q_rev is equal to TΔS for the system. So for the system, ΔS_system = q_rev / T = ΔH_vap / T.

But for the surroundings, the heat is released, so q_surr is -ΔH_vap. So the entropy change for surroundings is q_surr / T_surroundings. But wait, the temperature is the same as the system when it's a reversible process, right? So T_system = T_surroundings = T_boiling_point.

So yes, ΔS_surroundings = (-ΔH_vap) / T.

Wait, but wait, let me check units. The enthalpy is given in kJ/mol, so I need to convert it to J. 29.4 kJ is 29400 J. The temperature is 334.88 K.

So plugging the numbers, ΔS_surr = (-29400 J/mol) / 334.88 K.

Let me do the calculation. 29400 divided by 334.88. Let me approximate this.

Hmm, 334.88 times 87 is about 334 * 80=26640, 334*7=2338. So 26640+2338=28978. Close to 29400. So 29400 / 334.88 is approximately 87.8, and the sign is negative. So ΔS_surr is approximately -87.8 J/K·mol.

Looking at the options, option C is -87.8 J K^-1 mol^-1. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second—am I absolutely sure about the sign? Because the system is absorbing heat, the surroundings are losing it. So for the surroundings, it's an exothermic process, so their entropy decreases. So the entropy change is negative, which matches the options.

Yes, so the correct answer should be option C.

To calculate the entropy change of the surroundings during the vaporization of chloroform, we use the relationship:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = \frac{q_{\text{surroundings}}}{T}
\]

Here, \( q_{\text{surroundings}} \) is the heat lost by the surroundings, which is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the heat absorbed by the system during vaporization. The enthalpy of vaporization (\( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} \)) is given as \( 29.4 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \), and the normal boiling point is \( T = 334.88 \, \mathrm{K} \). Since the surroundings lose heat, \( q_{\text{surroundings}} = -\Delta H_{\text{vap}} \).

Converting \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} \) to joules:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 29.4 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} = 29400 \, \mathrm{J/mol}
\]

Now, calculate the entropy change of the surroundings:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = \frac{-\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{T} = \frac{-29400 \, \mathrm{J/mol}}{334.88 \, \mathrm{K}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} \approx -87.8 \, \mathrm{J/K \cdot mol}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the entropy of the surroundings decreases, as expected when heat is released to the surroundings during an exothermic process.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: -87.8 $\mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}$**
