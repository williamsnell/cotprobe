Okay, so I've got this economics question about the motives for holding money. The question gives three reasons: transactions purposes, precautionary purposes, and speculative purposes. I remember these are from Keynes' theory, right? So the question asks me to match each of three individuals to the most important motive.

Let me break it down. The three people are:

i) A student on a small allowance from his parents.
ii) A financially conservative professor with young children to support.
iii) A "wheeler-dealer."

I need to figure out which motive is most important for each.

Starting with the student. He's on a small allowance, so he probably doesn't have a lot of money. His main need would be to have enough cash for day-to-day expensesâ€”like buying meals, snacks, maybe some small purchases. So transactions purposes make sense here because he needs the money to make regular transactions. I don't think he's holding onto money for a rainy day (precautionary) because his allowance is small and maybe not enough to save much. And speculative purposes would involve investing or trying to make a profit, which a student with limited funds might not be doing much of. So for i), it's transactions.

Next, the professor. He's financially conservative and has young children. Conservative people tend to save more for security, so precautionary motive comes into play. He might want to have a cushion in case of emergencies, like medical issues or unexpected expenses. Since he's supporting a family, having some savings makes sense. So ii) is precautionary.

Now the wheeler-dealer. That term makes me think of someone who's into making deals, maybe in business or investing. They might be holding money to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. So the speculative motive, which is about possible profits, fits here. They might keep money liquid to invest when they see a profitable opportunity. So iii) is speculative.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches i) transactions, ii) precautionary, iii) speculative.

Let me scan the options:

Option E: i) Transactions, ii) Precautionary, iii) Speculative. That's exactly what I thought.

Wait, let me double-check the others. Option E is the fifth option down. Yes, that matches each case as I analyzed.

The three motives for holding money are transactions, precautionary, and speculative purposes. 

- A student on a small allowance primarily needs money for daily expenses, making transactions the most important motive.
- A financially conservative professor with a family would prioritize precautionary savings to ensure financial security.
- A "wheeler-dealer" is likely focused on making profits, so speculative purposes are most relevant.

The correct answer is E: i) Transactions purposes, ii) Precautionary reasons, iii) Speculative purposes.
