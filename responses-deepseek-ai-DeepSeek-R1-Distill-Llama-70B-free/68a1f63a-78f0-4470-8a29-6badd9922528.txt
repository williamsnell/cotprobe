Okay, so I have this problem about finding the molarity of ethanol in 90-proof whiskey. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the proof of alcohol is related to its ethanol content. I think 90-proof means it's 45% ethanol by volume. Wait, no, wait. Proof is calculated as twice the percentage by volume. So 90 proof is 45% ethanol by volume, right? Because 90 divided by 2 is 45. So that means 45% of the whiskey is ethanol by volume.

But wait, the question is about molarity, which is moles per liter. So I can't just use the volume percentage directly. I need to find out how many moles of ethanol are present in a liter of the solution.

Wait, but the density comes into play here. The density of ethanol is given as 0.8 g/ml. But wait, wait a second. Whiskey is a mixture, so its overall density might be different. Oh, but the problem states the density of alcohol is 0.8 g/ml. So maybe they're assuming that the density of the ethanol solution is close enough to that of pure ethanol? Or perhaps the problem is simplifying things by using ethanol's density for the solution.

I'm a bit confused about that. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the total volume as 1 liter (since molarity is per liter), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to approach this systematically.

So, 90-proof is 45% ethanol by volume. Let's consider 1 liter of the solution. Then, the volume of ethanol is 45% of 1 liter, which is 0.45 liters or 450 milliliters.

Now, the density of ethanol is 0.8 g/ml. So, the mass of ethanol in 450 ml would be density multiplied by volume. So that's 0.8 g/ml * 450 ml = 360 grams. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.8 g/ml times 450 ml is 360 grams. Right.

Now, I need to find the number of moles of ethanol. The molar mass of ethanol (C2H5OH) is calculated as follows: Carbon is 12 g/mol, so 2 carbons = 24. Hydrogen is 1 g/mol; there are 6 H's in ethanol, so 6. Oxygen is 16, so total is 24 + 6 + 16 = 46 g/mol.

So moles = mass / molar mass = 360 g / 46 g/mol ≈ let's calculate that. 360 divided by 46. Hmm, 46 times 7 is 322 (because 46*7=322), and 46*7.8 is about 358.8 (because 46*7=322, 46*0.8=36.8, total 358.8). So 7.8 something. Let me compute it more accurately: 46 * 7.826 = 360. So approximately 7.826 moles.

Wait, but wait, I'm considering 450 ml of ethanol in 1 liter of solution. So the volume is 1 liter, which is the total solution. So the molarity is moles per liter of solution. So the moles we calculated, 7.826, are in a liter of solution, so the molarity is approximately 7.83 M.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes in these problems, the assumption is that the solution's volume is additive, but when you mix ethanol and water, the volume isn't exactly additive. But perhaps the problem is simplifying and ignoring that. So I think the approach is correct.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the density of the solution. But the problem gives the density of alcohol as 0.8 g/ml, but perhaps the solution's density is different. However, the problem doesn't provide that, so maybe it's intended to use 0.8 as the density of the ethanol. So I think the first approach is correct.

So the moles are approximately 7.83, which would correspond to option D: 7.83 M.

To determine the molarity of ethanol in 90-proof whiskey, we start by noting that 90-proof corresponds to 45% ethanol by volume. This means that in 1 liter of whiskey, 450 mL (or 0.45 liters) is ethanol.

The density of ethanol is given as 0.8 g/ml. Using this, the mass of ethanol in 450 mL is calculated as:

\[
\text{Mass of ethanol} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume} = 0.8 \, \text{g/ml} \times 450 \, \text{ml} = 360 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, the molar mass of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of ethanol} = (2 \times 12) + (6 \times 1) + (1 \times 16) = 46 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The number of moles of ethanol is then:

\[
\text{Moles of ethanol} = \frac{\text{Mass of ethanol}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{360 \, \text{g}}{46 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 7.83 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since molarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution, the molarity of ethanol in 1 liter of 90-proof whiskey is approximately:

\[
\text{Molarity} = 7.83 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: 7.83 M**
