Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about calculating the heat absorbed (ΔH) when one mole of nitrogen gas is heated from 25°C to 150°C at constant pressure. They've given the heat capacity at constant pressure, C_p, as a function of temperature: C_p = 6.76 + 0.606×10^-3 T + 1.3×10^-7 T² cal·K⁻¹·mol⁻¹. And I need to choose the correct answer from the options provided, which are all in J/mol.

Wait, okay. So I remember that at constant pressure, the heat absorbed (q_p) is given by the integral of C_p with respect to temperature. Since it's a function of T, I can't just use the average C_p; I have to integrate it over the temperature change.

So the formula should be ΔH = ∫(from T1 to T2) C_p dT. But since C_p is given as a function of T, I'll need to integrate each term separately.

Breaking down C_p: it's a quadratic in T. So C_p(T) = a + bT + cT², where a=6.76 cal/(K·mol), b=0.606e-3 cal/(K²·mol), and c=1.3e-7 cal/(K³·mol). Wait, no, looking again: the terms are 6.76, which is a constant, then 0.606×10^-3 multiplied by T, and 1.3×10^-7 multiplied by T squared. So yeah, a=6.76, b=0.606e-3, c=1.3e-7.

So when I integrate C_p from T1 to T2, each term becomes:

Integral of a dT = a(T2 - T1)
Integral of bT dT = (b/2)(T2² - T1²)
Integral of cT² dT = (c/3)(T2³ - T1³)

So putting it all together:

ΔH = a(T2 - T1) + (b/2)(T2² - T1²) + (c/3)(T2³ - T1³)

Now I need to plug in the numbers. But wait, the temperatures given are in Celsius. The initial temperature T1 is 25°C, which is 298 K (since 25 + 273 = 298), and T2 is 150°C, which is 423 K (150 + 273). So T1 = 298 K, T2 = 423 K.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate (T2 - T1): 423 - 298 = 125 K.

Then, the first term is a*(125) = 6.76 cal/(K·mol) * 125 K = 6.76 * 125.

Wait, 6.76 * 100 is 676, 6.76 *25 is 169, so 676 + 169 = 845. So 845 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait, 6.76 *125 is 6.76*(100+25) = 676 + 169 = 845 cal/mol. So first term is 845 cal/mol.

Second term: (b/2)(T2² - T1²). Let's compute T2² and T1².

T1=298, T2=423.

T1 squared: 298^2. Let me compute that. 300^2 is 90,000, but 298 is 2 less. So (300-2)^2 = 300^2 - 2*300*2 + 2^2 = 90000 - 1200 +4 = 88804.

T2 squared: 423^2. Let's calculate that. 400^2=160000. 23^2=529. Then cross terms: 2*(400)*(23) = 18400. So 423^2 = (400 +23)^2 =400^2 + 2*400*23 +23^2 = 160000 + 18400 + 529 = 160000 + 18400 is 178400 +529=178929.

So T2² = 178929, T1²=88804. The difference is 178929 -88804 = 89,125 K².

Then (b/2) * 89,125. Let's compute that.

b is 0.606e-3 cal/(K²·mol). So 0.606e-3 / 2 = 0.303e-3.

Multiply by 89,125: 0.303e-3 * 89,125.

Let me compute 0.303 * 89125 first, then handle the 1e-3.

0.303 * 89125.

Hmm, maybe break it down: 0.3 * 89125 = 26,737.5 and 0.003 * 89125=267.375. So total is 26,737.5 + 267.375 = 27,004.875.

Now multiply by 1e-3 (since it's 0.303e-3), so 27,004.875e-3 = 27.004875 cal/mol.

So the second term is approximately 27.004875 cal/mol.

Third term: (c/3)(T2³ - T1³). Let's compute T2³ and T1³.

T1=298 K, so T1³ = 298^3.

298^3: Let's compute 298*298 first, which is 88804, then multiply by 298 again.

88804 * 298. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute it.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute T2³ - T1³ as (T2 - T1)(T2² + T2*T1 + T1²). Since a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²). So T2^3 - T1^3 = (T2-T1)(T2² + T2*T1 + T1²).

We already know T2-T1 is 125 K. Let's compute T2² + T2*T1 + T1².

We have T2² = 178929, T1²=88804.

T2*T1 = 423 * 298. Let me compute that. 400*298=119200, 23*298= 6854, so total is 119200 + 6854= 126,054.

So T2² + T2*T1 + T1² = 178929 + 126054 + 88804.

Adding them: 178,929 + 126,054 = 304,983; 304,983 +88,804 = 393,787.

So T2³ - T1³ = 125 * 393,787 = let's compute that.

125 * 393,787. Well, 100 * 393,787 = 39,378,700. 25 * 393,787 = 9,844,675 (since 25 is 1/4 of 100, so 393,787 * 25 is 393,787 *100 /4 = 39,378,700 /4 = ~9,844,675). So total is 39,378,700 +9,844,675=49,223,375 K³.

Now, c is 1.3e-7 cal/(K^3·mol), so c/3 is (1.3e-7)/3 ≈ 4.333e-8 cal/(K^3·mol).

So the third term is 4.333e-8 *49,223,375.

Let me compute 4.333e-8 * 49,223,375.

First, 49,223,375 * 4.333e-8 = ?

Well, 49,223,375 *4.333e-8 = (49,223,375 *4.333) * 1e-8.

Compute 49,223,375 *4.333.

Hmm, that's a big number. Let's approximate.

Wait, 49,223,375 *4 = 196,893,500.

49,223,375 *0.3 = 14,767,012.5.

49,223,375 *0.033 = approximately 1,623,371.275.

So adding them:

196,893,500 +14,767,012.5 = 211,660,512.5

+1,623,371.275 = 213,283,883.775.

So 4.333 *49,223,375 ≈ 213,283,883.775.

Multiply by 1e-8: 213,283,883.775e-8 = 2.13283883775 cal/mol.

So third term is approximately 2.1328 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait: 4.333e-8 *49,223,375 = let me compute this correctly.

Wait, maybe a better approach: 49,223,375 *4.333e-8.

Let me rewrite 4.333e-8 as 4.333 *1e-8.

So 49,223,375 *4.333 = let me compute this accurately.

Wait, 49,223,375 *4 = 196,893,500.

49,223,375 *0.333 = ?

Well, 0.333 is approximately 1/3, so 49,223,375 /3 = approx 16,407,791.6667.

So 0.333 *49,223,375 ≈16,407,791.6667.

So 4.333 *49,223,375 = 196,893,500 +16,407,791.6667 = 213,301,291.6667.

Now multiply by 1e-8: 213,301,291.6667e-8 = 2.133012916667 cal/mol.

So approximately 2.133 cal/mol.

So putting it all together, the three terms are:

First term: 845.0 cal/mol

Second term: ~27.00 cal/mol

Third term: ~2.133 cal/mol

So total ΔH in cal/mol is 845 + 27 + 2.133 = 874.133 cal/mol.

But wait, the question asks for the answer in J/mol. Because the options are in J.

So I need to convert calories to joules. I remember that 1 cal = 4.184 J.

So 874.133 cal/mol * 4.184 J/cal = ?

Let me compute that.

First, 800 cal *4.184 = 3,347.2 J.

74.133 cal *4.184 = let's compute:

70 cal *4.184 = 292.88 J.

4.133 cal *4.184 ≈ 4 *4.184 =16.736; 0.133 *4.184≈0.557. So total ≈16.736 +0.557=17.293 J.

So 70 +4.133 =74.133 cal → 292.88 +17.293=310.173 J.

So total ΔH is 3,347.2 +310.173 = 3,657.373 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 3658.6 J/mol, which is very close. Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made some approximations. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let me more accurately compute 874.133 cal *4.184 J/cal.

Compute 874 *4.184:

Break it down:

800 *4.184 = 3,347.2

70 *4.184 = 292.88

4 *4.184 =16.736

So 3,347.2 +292.88 = 3,640.08 → plus 16.736 = 3,656.816 J.

Now the 0.133 cal: 0.133 *4.184 ≈0.557 J.

So total is 3,656.816 +0.557 ≈3,657.373 J/mol, which is approximately 3657.37 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 3658.6 J/mol. That's very close, but why the slight difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Let me double-check the integration steps.

The integral of C_p dT is:

Integral [6.76 +0.606e-3 T +1.3e-7 T² ] dT

Which is 6.76 T + (0.606e-3)/2 * T² + (1.3e-7)/3 * T³ + C

Evaluated from T1 to T2.

So:

[6.76 T2 + 0.303e-3 T2² + 4.333e-8 T2³] - [6.76 T1 + 0.303e-3 T1² + 4.333e-8 T1³]

Which is 6.76*(T2-T1) + 0.303e-3 (T2² - T1²) +4.333e-8 (T2³ - T1³)

Wait, earlier I computed each term correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should carry out the calculations with more precise numbers, maybe I approximated too early.

Let me re-calculate each term with more precision.

First term: a*(T2-T1) =6.76 *125 = 845 cal/mol.

Second term: (b/2)(T2² - T1²) → b=0.606e-3, so b/2=0.303e-3.

Compute T2² - T1² = (423)^2 - (298)^2 = 178,929 -88,804 = 90,125.

So 0.303e-3 *90,125 = ?

Compute 90,125 *0.303e-3.

0.303e-3 = 0.000303.

So 90,125 *0.000303 = ?

90,125 * 0.3e-3 = 90,125 *0.0003 =27.0375.

90,125 *0.003e-3 = 90,125 *0.000003 =0.270375.

So 0.303e-3 is 0.3e-3 +0.003e-3, so sum is 27.0375 +0.270375=27.307875 cal/mol.

So second term is 27.307875 cal/mol.

Third term: (c/3)(T2³ - T1³) → c=1.3e-7, c/3≈4.333333e-8.

We have T2³ - T1³ = (423)^3 - (298)^3.

As I calculated earlier, using the formula (a³ - b³) = (a - b)(a² +ab +b²).

a=423, b=298. a-b=125.

a²=178,929, b²=88,804.

ab=423*298.

Wait, 423 *298:

Let me compute 400*298 = 119,200.

23*298 = let's compute 20*298=5,960; 3*298=894 → 5,960+894=6,854.

So ab=119,200 +6,854=126,054.

So a² +ab +b² =178,929 +126,054 +88,804 = 393,787.

So T2³ - T1³ =125 *393,787 =49,223,375.

So third term: 4.333333e-8 *49,223,375.

Let me compute this more precisely.

4.333333e-8 *49,223,375 = ?

4.333333e-8 = 0.00000004333333.

Multiply by 49,223,375:

0.00000004333333 *49,223,375 = ?

Well, 49,223,375 *4.333333e-8 = let's compute this.

First, 49,223,375 *4e-8 = 1,968,935e-8 = 1.968935.

Then, 49,223,375 *0.333333e-8 = ?

0.333333e-8 = 3.33333e-9.

So 49,223,375 *3.33333e-9 ≈ 0.164075 (since 49,223,375 *3e-9 is 0.14767, 49,223,375 *0.33333e-9 is about 0.0164075. So total ≈0.164075).

Wait, perhaps better to compute 49,223,375 *4.333333e-8.

Wait, 4.333333e-8 is 4 + 1/3, so 4.333333e-8 = 4e-8 + (1/3)e-8.

So 49,223,375 *4e-8 = 49,223,375 *4 *1e-8 = 196,893,500 *1e-8 = 1.968935.

Then 49,223,375 * (1/3)*1e-8 = 49,223,375 /3 *1e-8 ≈ 16,407,791.6667 *1e-8 ≈ 0.164077916667.

Adding the two: 1.968935 +0.164077916667 ≈ 2.13201291667 cal/mol.

So third term is approximately 2.132 cal/mol.

So now adding all three terms:

First term: 845.0 cal/mol.

Second term: 27.307875 cal/mol.

Third term: ~2.1320129 cal/mol.

Total ΔH = 845.0 +27.307875 +2.1320129 = 874.44 cal/mol.

Wait, that's 845 +27.307875 = 872.307875 +2.1320129=874.4398879 cal/mol.

So more precisely, 874.44 cal/mol.

Now converting to J: 874.44 cal *4.184 J/cal = ?

Compute 874 *4.184:

Let me compute 800 *4.184 = 3,347.2.

70 *4.184 = 292.88.

4 *4.184 =16.
