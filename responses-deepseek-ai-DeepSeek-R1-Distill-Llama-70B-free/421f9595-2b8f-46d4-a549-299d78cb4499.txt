Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: Suppose the price level in the United States has risen in the past year but production of goods and services has remained constant. Based on this, which of the following is true for Nominal GDP and Real GDP?

Hmm, I remember that GDP can be a bit tricky because there are two types: nominal and real. Let me try to recall what each means.

Nominal GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country, measured at current prices. So it includes the effects of price changes. If prices go up, nominal GDP would increase even if the quantity of goods produced stays the same.

Real GDP, on the other hand, adjusts for inflation. It's the value of goods and services measured using a base year's prices. This means it reflects the actual volume of production, without the influence of price changes. So if production stays the same, real GDP should stay the same too, right?

The question states that the price level has risen. So prices are up, but production is constant. Let's break it down.

If production (the quantity of goods and services) is the same as the previous year, then without any price changes, both nominal and real GDP would be the same as before. But since prices have gone up, nominal GDP would increase because it's calculated using current (higher) prices. However, real GDP is adjusted for these price changes, so it should remain unchanged because the actual output hasn't increased.

So looking at the options, I need to find where nominal GDP increases and real GDP doesn't change.

Let me go through the options:

A: No change, No change. No, because prices went up, so nominal should change.

B: Increased, Increased. No, real GDP shouldn't increase since production is same.

C: Decreased both. No, because prices went up, nominal would increase.

D: Increased, No change. This sounds right. Nominal up because of prices, real same because production same.

E: Increased, Decreased. No, real should stay same.

F: No change, Decreased. No, because prices affect nominal.

G: Decreased, No change. No, nominal can't decrease if prices rise.

H: Decreased, Increased. No, opposite of what's happening.

I: No change, Increased. No, real can't increase without production.

So the correct answer should be D: Nominal increased, Real no change.

The question involves understanding the difference between nominal GDP and real GDP. Nominal GDP reflects the current prices of goods and services, while real GDP adjusts for price changes, showing the actual volume of production.

Given that the price level has risen but production has remained constant:

- **Nominal GDP** increases because it incorporates the higher prices.
- **Real GDP** remains unchanged because it accounts for inflation and reflects the constant production level.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** correctly states that nominal GDP increases while real GDP remains unchanged.

Answer: D
