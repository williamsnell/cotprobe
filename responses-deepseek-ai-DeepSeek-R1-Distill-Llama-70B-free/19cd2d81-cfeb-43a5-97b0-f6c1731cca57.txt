Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about Butler & Stokes' 1969 study on why the working class supports the Labour Party. I'm a bit rusty on my political sociology, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Butler and Stokes were part of the field of electoral studies. Their work was influential in understanding voting behavior. They looked at factors that influence how people vote, like social class, party identification, and other socio-political elements.

The question is about the reason behind working-class support for the Labour Party. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different factor.

Option A says it's a rational calculation of self-interest. That makes sense because working-class people might support a party that promises policies benefiting them economically. But I'm not sure if Butler & Stokes emphasized this the most.

Option B is socialization into working-class families and communities. I think this is about how people are raised in environments that shape their political views. Like, if you grow up in a Labour-supporting family, you're likely to vote Labour. This sounds familiarâ€”I think this is more about social identity rather than just self-interest.

Option C mentions trade unions and worker rights movements. Trade unions have historically been linked with the Labour Party, so their influence could be a big factor. But does that directly tie to Butler & Stokes' argument?

Option D suggests upper-class influence, which doesn't make much sense because Labour is a working-class party. So probably not D.

Option E is about the local political landscape and voting habits. Local factors can influence voting, but I'm not sure if this was Butler & Stokes' main point.

Option F talks about conforming to societal norms. That's similar to socialization but broader. It might be part of it, but I'm not certain.

Option G is false consciousness and hegemony. That's more of a Marxist idea, like Gramsci's hegemony, where the ruling class's ideas dominate. This might be more associated with why the working class doesn't revolt, but I'm not sure if Butler & Stokes focused on that.

Option H is lack of exposure to other ideologies. That could be a reason, but I don't recall this being a key point in their theory.

Option I is about cultural and lifestyle issues. That seems more related to modern identity politics, which might not be the focus here.

Option J is dissatisfaction with other parties. This is possible, but it feels like a more reactive reason rather than a proactive support for Labour.

Now, thinking back, Butler and Stokes' work was part of the Michigan School of electoral behavior, which emphasized party identification and social factors. They talked about how people's voting habits are shaped by their social environment and background, like family and community ties, rather than just rational choice.

So, the idea is that working-class individuals are socialized from a young age in their families and communities to support Labour. It's more about the socialization process than just self-interest or union influence.

Looking back at the options, B seems to fit this description. Socialization into working-class families and communities would mean that people grow up with certain political views because that's what they're surrounded by. This aligns with the idea that party identification is often formed early and influenced by one's environment.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The question asks about Butler & Stokes' (1969) explanation for working-class support for the Labour Party. The correct answer is based on their emphasis on socialization into working-class families and communities, which shapes political views and party identification from a young age. This aligns with their focus on social environment and background influences rather than rational self-interest or other factors.

Answer: B
