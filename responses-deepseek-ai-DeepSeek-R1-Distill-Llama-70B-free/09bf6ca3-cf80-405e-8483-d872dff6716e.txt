Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Supreme Court justices, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by reading the question carefully. The question is: "The majority of Supreme Court justices..." and then it gives several options from A to J.

I remember that Supreme Court justices are appointed by the President and then confirmed by the Senate. So looking at the options, I see option D says they're appointed by the Senate. That doesn't sound right because the Senate only confirms, they don't appoint. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E says they're nominated by the Speaker of the House. No, I think the President does the nominating, so E is wrong. Option B says they're appointed by presidents of the same political party. Hmm, that makes sense because usually, Presidents nominate justices who align with their political views. So B seems plausible.

Option A suggests most have no prior judicial experience. I'm not sure about that. I think many justices do have prior experience as judges, maybe in lower courts, so A might not be correct.

Option C, having served as Vice President, that's rare. I don't think many justices have that background. Option F, background in criminal law? Maybe some, but I don't know if it's the majority. I think their backgrounds can vary widely.

Option G says they stay on the court for only a decade. No, I remember that justices often serve for many years, sometimes 20, 30 years or more. So G is incorrect.

Option H requires a degree in constitutional law. I don't think that's a requirement. They usually have law degrees, but not necessarily specializing in constitutional law.

Option I requires retirement at 70. No, Supreme Court justices serve for life unless they resign or are impeached. So I is wrong.

Option J says they switch party affiliation during their term. That's uncommon. Once appointed, their decisions can sometimes surprise, but switching parties is rare.

So putting it all together, the majority are appointed by presidents of the same party, which is option B. That makes sense because Presidents typically choose nominees who share their political ideology.

The majority of Supreme Court justices are appointed by presidents of the same political party. This is because Presidents typically select nominees whose views align with their own political ideology, ensuring ideological consistency on the Court. 

Answer: B
