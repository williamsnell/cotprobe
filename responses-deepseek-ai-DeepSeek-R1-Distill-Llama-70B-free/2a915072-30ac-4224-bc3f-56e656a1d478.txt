Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: A box of mass m slides on a horizontal surface with an initial speed v0. It only feels gravity and the force from the surface. The coefficient of kinetic friction is μ. We need to find how far the box slides before coming to rest.

Hmm, I remember that when an object is moving on a surface and friction is acting, it's a problem about motion with constant acceleration or deceleration. Since the box comes to rest, friction must be doing negative work, slowing it down.

Wait, so the forces acting on the box are gravity pulling it down and the normal force pushing up from the surface. But since the surface is horizontal, the normal force equals mg, right? So the frictional force would be μ times the normal force, which is μmg. Oh, but wait, kinetic friction is when the object is moving, so yeah, that's correct.

Since the box is sliding on a horizontal surface, the only horizontal force is friction opposing the motion. So the net force on the box is the frictional force, which will cause deceleration.

I think the key here is to find the acceleration (actually, deceleration) caused by friction and then use kinematic equations to find the distance traveled until the box stops.

So, let's break it down. First, find the acceleration. Newton's second law says F = ma. The frictional force here is the only horizontal force, so F_friction = ma.

F_friction is μmg. So μmg = m a. Oh, the mass m cancels out, so a = μg. But wait, since friction is opposing the motion, the acceleration will be negative. So a = -μg. But when calculating distance, the sign might not matter as much as the magnitude, depending on how we set up the equations.

Now, we can use kinematic equations to find the stopping distance. The initial velocity is v0, and the final velocity is 0 when it stops. The acceleration is a, which in this case is μg (but negative because it's deceleration).

Which kinematic equation applies here? I think the one that relates initial and final velocities, acceleration, and distance is: 

v² = u² + 2 a s

Where v is final velocity (0 here), u is initial velocity (v0), a is acceleration, and s is displacement (distance).

Plugging in the numbers, 0 = v0² + 2 * (-μg) * s.

Wait, let's write that correctly. The equation is v² = u² + 2 a s. Here, a is the acceleration (which is negative, because it's against the direction of motion). So:

0 = v0² + 2*(-μg)*s

So simplifying this, 0 = v0² - 2 μg s

Bring the 2 μg s term to the other side:

2 μg s = v0²

Then, solving for s:

s = v0² / (2 μg )

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option C is v0²/(2gμ), which is the same as what I got. Option H is v0²/(2μg), which is the same. Wait, no, option C and H are the same? Let me look again.

Wait, no: option C is v0 squared divided by (2g mu). Option H is v0 squared divided by (2 mu g). Oh wait, no, wait a second, because mu and g are multipliers in the denominator. So 2g mu is same as 2 mu g. So both options would give the same result. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are different letters.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

Option C: v0^2/(2gμ)

Option H: v0^2/(2μg)

Wait, so 2gμ is the same as 2μg because multiplication is commutative. So both would give the same value. But that's impossible because each option has a unique answer. So maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the acceleration a is μg, but since it's deceleration, perhaps I should use a = -μg. But when substituting into the equation, maybe I should take the magnitude for distance. Or perhaps I should have used the absolute value of a.

Wait, the kinematic equation is v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s.

Using the correct signs: final velocity v is 0, initial u is v0, and a is -μg.

So 0 = (v0)^2 + 2*(-μg)*s

Which simplifies to:

v0² = 2 μg s

So s = v0²/(2 μg )

Looking back at the options, option H is v0^2/(2μg), which matches. Option C is v0^2/(2gμ), which is the same as option H. Wait, no, because μ is multiplied by g. So 2gμ is same as 2μg. So both options C and H would have the same denominator. But that can't be right because the options are different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, the frictional force is μ multiplied by the normal force. The normal force is equal to mg because it's on a horizontal surface. So F_friction = μ m g.

Then, F_friction = m a => a = F_friction/m = μ g.

So the acceleration is a = -μ g (negative because it's opposite to the direction of motion).

Now, using the kinematic equation:

v² = u² + 2 a s

0 = v0² + 2*(-μ g)*s

So 0 = v0² - 2 μ g s → 2 μ g s = v0² → s = v0²/(2 μ g )

So that's s = v0²/(2 μ g )

Looking at the options:

Option C: v0²/(2gμ) → same as (v0²)/(2μg) because 2gμ = 2μg.

Option H is written as v0²/(2μg), which is same as option C.

Wait, that can't be. Let me look again.

Wait, the given options are:

A: 2v0²/(μg)

B: μv0²/(2g)

C: v0²/(2gμ)

D: v0²/(μg^3)

E: v0²/(μg)

F: 2μv0²/g

G: v0²/(μg²)

H: v0²/(2μg)

I: mv0²/(μg)

J: mv0²/(2μg)

So, Option C is v0^2/(2gμ) → which is the same as v0^2/(2μg), which is what I have. So, both option C and H are the same? No, because 2gμ is denominator in C, and 2μg in H. But since multiplication is commutative, 2gμ = 2μg. So both options would evaluate to the same value, meaning two options have the same correct answer, which can't be. That suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of acceleration. Let me see: the frictional force is μ * normal force. Normal force is mg, so F_friction = μ m g. Newton's second law: F = m a → a = F/m = (μ m g)/m → a = μ g. So a is μg. But since it's acting opposite to the direction of motion, the acceleration is -μg. So when I plug into the equation, it's 2 a s, which would be 2*(-μg)*s.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the magnitude. So the distance s would be v0^2/(2 a), where a is μg, giving s = v0^2/(2 μg).

But in the options, I see that option H is v0^2/(2μg), so that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C and H were the same, but looking again, perhaps I read it wrong. Let me check:

Option C: v0²/(2gμ)

Option H: v0²/(2μg)

Ah, no, they are the same because 2gμ equals 2μg. So both options would have the same expression, which can't be. Because then two options would be correct. But that's impossible because the problem expects a single correct answer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, I can compute the work done by friction and equate it to the kinetic energy.

The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v0².

Work done by friction is force times distance. Friction force is μ m g, so work W = -F_friction * s = -μ m g s.

When the box stops, all the kinetic energy is lost, so the work done by friction equals the initial kinetic energy. So:

(1/2) m v0² = μ m g s

The mass m cancels out:

(1/2) v0² = μ g s → s = v0²/(2 μ g )

Which is the same result as before.

So looking at the options, that's option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C was the same as H, but no, looking at them, option C is v0²/(2gμ), which is same as H's denominator.

Wait, because 2gμ is same as 2μg, so s = v0²/(2gμ) is same as v0²/(2μg). So both options C and H have the same value. But that's a problem because the correct answer can't be both.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait the options are:

C: v0²/(2gμ)

H: v0²/(2μg)

But 2gμ is same as 2μg, so both are same. So why are they separate options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Did I perhaps forget to include the mass somewhere?

Wait, in the work-energy approach, the mass canceled out. So the correct answer doesn't include mass. So looking at the options, options I and J include mass, so they're incorrect.

So the correct answer must be either C or H. But since both have the same denominator, perhaps there was a typo in the options, but in the real question, they must be different.

Wait, in the problem statement, the options are given as:

C: v0^2/(2gμ)

H: v0^2/(2μg)

So perhaps a typo, but in reality both are same. But that can't be. So maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the frictional force is different. Wait, no, the frictional force is μ times the normal force, which is μmg. So that is correct.

Wait, another approach: using time to stop.

The deceleration is a = μg. So time taken to stop is t = v0 / a = v0/(μg).

The distance covered is s = v0 * t - 0.5 a t².

Wait, let's compute that.

s = v0 * (v0/(μg)) ) - 0.5 * μg * (v0/(μg))²

Simplify:

s = v0²/(μg) - 0.5 μg * v0²/(μ² g² )

Simplify each term:

First term: v0²/(μg)

Second term: 0.5 * μg * v0² / (μ² g² ) → 0.5 * v0²/(μ g )

So s = (v0²)/(μg) - 0.5 (v0²)/(μg )

Which is 0.5 (v0²)/(μg )

So s = (v0²)/(2 μg )

Same result as before.

So the correct answer is s = v0²/(2 μg ), which is option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C and H were same, but now I think perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options.

Wait, looking again:

Option C: v0^2/(2gμ) → denominator is 2gμ.

Option H: v0^2/(2μg) → denominator is 2μg.

But 2gμ is same as 2μg, so both options would give same value. So the correct answer would be both C and H, which isn't possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again.

Wait, perhaps the person who made the question intended for option E to be similar. Looking at option E: v0^2/(μg). That's double the correct answer.

So I think the correct answer is option C or H, but since they are same, perhaps the intended answer is H.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says "how far does the box slide before coming to rest?".

So the correct formula is s = v0²/(2μg ), which is option H.
</think>

To determine how far the box slides before coming to rest, we analyze the forces and use kinematic equations. The box is subject to a frictional force opposing its motion, given by \( F_{\text{friction}} = \mu m g \), where \( \mu \) is the coefficient of kinetic friction, \( m \) is the mass of the box, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Using Newton's second law, \( F = m a \), the deceleration caused by friction is:

\[
a = \frac{F_{\text{friction}}}{m} = \mu g
\]

The box starts with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) and comes to rest (\( v = 0 \)) due to this deceleration. Using the kinematic equation:

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s
\]

where \( v \) is the final velocity, \( u \) is the initial velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration (or deceleration), and \( s \) is the distance traveled, we substitute \( v = 0 \), \( u = v_0 \), and \( a = -\mu g \):

\[
0 = v_0^2 + 2(-\mu g)s
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v_0^2 = 2 \mu g s
\]

Solving for \( s \):

\[
s = \frac{v_0^2}{2 \mu g}
\]

This matches the expression in **Option H**. While Option C appears similar, the denominator \( 2g\mu \) is equivalent to \( 2\mu g \) due to the commutative property of multiplication, making both options mathematically identical. However, since only one answer can be correct, the intended answer is:

**H: \( \frac{v_0^2}{2 \mu g} \)**.

Answer: H
