Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about cross-cultural tests and I need to figure out the answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the characteristics of cross-cultural tests and then to name four examples of popularly administered ones. The options are from A to J, each listing different tests.

First, I should understand what cross-cultural tests are. I remember that cross-cultural tests are designed to be administered to people from different cultural backgrounds. They should ideally minimize cultural bias so that the results are comparable across different groups. These tests often focus on non-verbal or performance tasks because language and cultural content can vary a lot.

So the characteristics would include things like being non-verbal, using pictures or gestures instead of language, or being based on universal concepts that don't depend on specific cultural knowledge. They should also have been standardized across diverse populations to ensure fairness.

Now, looking at the options, I need to pick which one lists four tests that fit this description.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Stanford-Binet, Kaufman Brief, Naglieri Nonverbal. I know that Wechsler scales have both verbal and performance sections. The Naglieri is nonverbal, so that fits. But WISC and Stanford-Binet might have verbal components, so maybe they're not the best examples of cross-cultural tests unless they're adapted. Not sure yet.

Option B: Leiter International, Culture Fair Test, Progressive Matrices, Goodenough Draw-a-Man. Leiter is a performance scale, non-verbal. The Culture Fair test is designed to be culture-fair, so that fits. Progressive Matrices (like Raven's) are non-verbal and used cross-culturally. The Draw-a-Man test assesses intelligence through drawing, which is non-verbal. So this option seems strong.

Option C: Myers-Briggs, Big Five, Emotional Intelligence, Strengths and Difficulties. These are personality tests, not necessarily cross-cultural. Myers-Briggs is widely used but not sure if it's considered a cross-cultural test. Probably not the right category.

Option D: Peabody Picture Vocabulary, WAIS, Raven's, Differential Ability Scales. PPVT is verbal, relying on vocabulary, which might be culture-bound. WAIS includes verbal and performance, but again, the verbal part might not be cross-cultural. Raven's is good, but others might not fit.

Option E: All personality tests, so probably not relevant for cross-cultural cognitive tests.

Option F: Miller Analogies is verbal and culture-specific. Others are achievement or cognitive but might not be cross-cultural.

Option G: Creative thinking and behavior scales. Not sure if these are cross-cultural focused.

Option H: Personality and clinical tests, not about cognitive cross-cultural.

Options I and J: Focus on self-concept, career, and developmental scales, not the cognitive cross-cultural tests.

So the best options seem to be between A and B. Option A includes some verbal tests, which might not be as cross-culturally fair, while option B has tests specifically designed to be culture-fair and non-verbal.

Wait, let me think again. The Leiter International Performance Scale is non-verbal, so it's good. Culture Fair Intelligence Test is explicitly designed to reduce cultural bias. Progressive Matrices are non-verbal. The Goodenough Draw-a-Man is a non-verbal measure of intelligence. So option B has four tests that are indeed cross-cultural.

Option A includes the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, which fits, but the others might not be as focused on cross-cultural aspects.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The question asks for the characteristics of cross-cultural tests and provides options listing different tests. Cross-cultural tests are designed to minimize cultural bias, often using non-verbal tasks or universal concepts to ensure fairness across diverse populations. They are typically standardized for administration to people from various cultural backgrounds.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** includes tests like the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and Stanford-Binet, which have verbal components that may introduce cultural bias. While the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test fits, the others may not be ideal examples of cross-cultural tests.
- **Option B** lists the Leiter International Performance Scale, Culture Fair Intelligence Test, Progressive Matrices, and Goodenough Draw-a-Man Test. These are all non-verbal or specifically designed to reduce cultural bias, making them strong examples of cross-cultural tests.
- **Options C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J** include tests that are either personality assessments, developmental scales, or verbal/culture-bound measures, which do not align with the focus on cross-cultural cognitive tests.

Option B is the most appropriate choice as it includes four tests that are specifically designed to be cross-cultural and non-verbal.

Answer: B
