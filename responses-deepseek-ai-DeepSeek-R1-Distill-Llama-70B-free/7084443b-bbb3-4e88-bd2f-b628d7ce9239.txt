Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Seizing me, he led me down to the House of Darkness…
To the house where those who enter do not come out,
Along the road of no return,
To the house where those who dwell, do without light,
Where dirt is their drink, their food is of clay…
Where light cannot be seen. They dwell in the dark,
And upon the door and bolt, there lies dust.
from Tablet VII, The Epic of Gilgamesh, Sumeria, ca. 2100 B.C.E.
Truth is good and its worth is lasting.
It has not been disturbed since the day of its creator,
Whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished.
It lies as a path in front of even him who knows nothing.
Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port…
Those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves.
Those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.
from The Maxims of Ptahhotep, Egypt, ca. 2400 B.C.E.

Okay, so I have this question about two ancient texts, one from Sumeria and the other from Egypt. I need to figure out which conclusion they best support from the options given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the Sumerian text from the Epic of Gilgamesh. It describes a place called the House of Darkness. The description is pretty grim—no light, people dwell in the dark, drinking dirt and eating clay. It sounds like a place where there's no escape, and it's pretty miserable. So this seems to be a depiction of the afterlife as a dark and gloomy place. It's not a positive view; it's more about suffering or at least a bleak existence after death.

Then there's the Egyptian text from The Maxims of Ptahhotep. This one talks about truth being good and lasting, and that those who follow the right path (guided by the gods) will be okay. It mentions that wrongdoing doesn't lead to success and that the gods forbid some from crossing the "river of life." This sounds more positive in a way, emphasizing morality and divine guidance. It doesn't describe the afterlife as a place of suffering but rather as something that can be navigated successfully if one follows the right path. There's an emphasis on truth and proper behavior leading to a better outcome.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which conclusion is supported by these texts. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says Sumerians had a darker perspective on life than Egyptians. Well, the Sumerian text is about the afterlife, not necessarily life itself. So maybe not the best fit.

Option B suggests Sumerians focused more on physical aspects of life. The Gilgamesh text is about the afterlife, which is more spiritual, so this might not be right.

Option C claims Egyptians saw the afterlife as punishment more than Sumerians. Wait, the Sumerian text is quite bleak, describing a dark house where people can't escape. The Egyptian text isn't showing punishment as much as it's talking about truth and guidance. So maybe this is the opposite of what C says. If the Sumerian afterlife is harsh, then maybe C is incorrect.

Option D says Egyptians were more spiritual. Both texts deal with the afterlife and divine matters, so I'm not sure if one is more spiritual than the other. They both have spiritual elements.

Option E suggests Sumerians had a more positive view of the afterlife. But the Gilgamesh text seems pretty negative, so E doesn't seem right.

Option F says Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife. The Egyptian text talks about truth and guidance leading to crossing the river of life, which sounds more positive than the Sumerian description of darkness and clay. So F might be correct.

Option G says Egyptians were more optimistic about the afterlife. That aligns with F. Their afterlife seems more about successfully navigating with the gods' help, which is optimistic.

Option H is about social hierarchy, which neither text really discusses, so I can probably skip that.

Option I talks about political obedience. The Egyptian text mentions following the gods' guidance and truth, which could relate to moral and political obedience. But the question is about which conclusion is best supported, so I'm not sure if this is the main point.

Option J is about gender relations, which isn't addressed in either text, so that's out.

So, focusing on the afterlife descriptions, the Sumerian text is gloomy, while the Egyptian text is more positive. Therefore, the conclusion would be that Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than Sumerians. Looking back at the options, that's option F or G. Wait, F says "less gloomy" and G says "more optimistic." Both seem similar. Let me check the wording again.

Option F: Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than Sumerians.

Option G: Egyptians were more optimistic about life after death than Sumerians.

Both options are similar, but F is more about the afterlife view, which is exactly what the texts describe. G is about optimism in general, which might be a bit broader. But the question refers specifically to the afterlife based on the texts.

Wait, the Maxims of Ptahhotep don't explicitly describe the afterlife in detail, but they do talk about crossing the river of life, which is likely a metaphor for the afterlife. The Sumerian text clearly describes a grim afterlife place. So the Egyptian view seems less gloomy.

Therefore, the correct answer should be either F or G. But looking at the options, I think F is more precise because it directly compares the afterlife views. G is more about optimism in life after death, which might not be exactly what the texts show.

Wait, the Egyptian text doesn't describe the afterlife as a positive place, but more about the path and guidance. It doesn't say it's a happy place, but rather that if you follow truth, you can cross the river, implying a successful transition. The Sumerian text is about the afterlife being a dark, unpleasant place.

So the Egyptian view is less gloomy, making option F correct.
</think>

The Sumerian text from the Epic of Gilgamesh describes the afterlife as a grim and bleak place, characterized by darkness, confinement, and suffering. In contrast, the Egyptian text from The Maxims of Ptahhotep emphasizes truth, morality, and divine guidance, suggesting a more positive and hopeful perspective on the afterlife, where those who follow the right path can successfully cross the "river of life." This contrast indicates that the ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife compared to the ancient Sumerians.

The best-supported conclusion is:

**F: Ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than ancient Sumerians.**

Answer: F
