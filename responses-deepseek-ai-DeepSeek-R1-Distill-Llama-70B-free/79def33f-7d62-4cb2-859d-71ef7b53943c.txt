Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about bubbles in water, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read the question again. 

The problem says that air is introduced through a nozzle into a tank of water, creating a stream of bubbles. The goal is to find out by how much the pressure of the air at the nozzle must exceed the surrounding water pressure. They give the diameter of the bubbles as 2 mm and the surface tension σ as 72.7 × 10^-3 N/m. The options are A to J, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that when a bubble forms, the pressure inside the bubble is related to the surface tension and the radius of the bubble. Oh right, it's something to do with Laplace's Law or the Young-Laplace equation. I think that equation relates the excess pressure inside a bubble (or a droplet) to the surface tension and the curvature, which is based on the radius.

Wait, the Young-Laplace equation for a bubble is ΔP = 4σ / r, right? Because a bubble has two surfaces (inner and outer), so you multiply by 2, making it 4σ divided by the radius. Or wait, is it 2σ/r for a single surface like a soap film? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, for a bubble, it's a double layer, so the excess pressure is 4σ divided by the radius. Because the soap film (like a bubble) has two surfaces, each contributing 2σ/r. So for a bubble, ΔP = 4σ/r.

Wait, but wait another second. The question is about the pressure of the air exceeding the surrounding water. So the surrounding water's pressure is the ambient pressure, and the air inside the bubble must have a higher pressure than that. So the pressure difference is ΔP = P_air - P_water. 

So the formula is correct: ΔP = 4σ / r. So I need to compute that.

Given that the diameter is 2 mm, so the radius is 1 mm, which is 0.001 meters. Because radius is half the diameter.

So σ is given as 72.7e-3 N/m, which is 0.0727 N/m.

Putting the numbers in: ΔP = 4 * 0.0727 / 0.001.

Wait, let me compute that. 4 times 0.0727 is 0.2908. Divided by 0.001 (which is 1e-3) is the same as multiplying by 1000. So 0.2908 * 1000 equals 290.8 N/m², which is 290.8 Pascals? Wait, no, wait. Wait, because N/m is equivalent to N·m⁻¹, but when you divide by m (radius), you get N/m², which is Pascal (Pa). So yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, wait, but looking at the options, they're in terms of N/m. Oh wait no, looking at the options, option B is 143.4 N/m, which can't be right because 290.8 is higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 72.7e-3 is 0.0727. So 4 * 0.0727 = 0.2908. Then 0.2908 divided by 0.001 meters is 290.8 N/m², which is 290.8 Pa. But none of the options are near 290. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe I should be using the formula for a single surface, like 2σ/r, but that would give half the value.

Wait, no, no. For a bubble, which is a liquid surrounding a gas, the Young-Laplace equation is ΔP = 2σ / r. Because the bubble has a single interface between the air and water, but since it's a curved surface, the pressure inside is higher. No, wait, no. Wait, now I'm getting confused. Because a bubble is like a droplet of air in water. So for a droplet, the pressure inside is higher, and the formula is ΔP = 2σ / r. Because the droplet has one surface. But wait, in the case of a bubble, isn't it the same as a droplet? Let me clarify this.

Wait, if you have a bubble of air in water, the air is inside, surrounded by water. The surface is just one layer—air and water. So the pressure difference is given by ΔP = 2σ / r. Because for a single surface (like a soap bubble in air, but that's two surfaces), but wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. 

The Young-Laplace equation for a spherical surface is ΔP = 2σ / r for a liquid droplet in gas, or a gas bubble in liquid. Because in each case, there's only one interface. For example, a water droplet in air has one surface, so ΔP = 2σ / r. Similarly, an air bubble in water has one interface (air-water), so ΔP is 2σ / r.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought it was 4σ. Where did I get that from? Oh wait, maybe I confused it with a soap film, which has two surfaces. So for a soap bubble (air inside and outside with a soap film in between), the pressure difference would be 4σ / r because there are two surfaces. But in this case, the bubble is in water, so only one surface. So the correct formula is 2σ / r.

So that would change the calculation. Let me recalculate with that.

So ΔP = 2 * σ / r.

σ is 72.7e-3 N/m, which is 0.0727 N/m.

r is 1 mm = 0.001 m.

So ΔP = 2 * 0.0727 / 0.001.

Calculates to 2 * 0.0727 = 0.1454. Divided by 0.001 is 145.4 N/m², which is 145.4 Pa.

Looking at the options, option B is 143.4 N/m. Wait, but wait, the units here are N/m? But I'm getting N/m² (Pa). That's confusing.

Wait, no, wait. The options are in N/m. So that can't be. Because the units don't match. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the pressure difference but something else. Or maybe I mixed up the units.

Wait, let me double-check the units. Surface tension σ is in N/m. So when I compute ΔP = 2σ / r, the units would be (N/m) / m = N/m², which is Pa. But the options are in N/m, which is different. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.

Wait, looking back at the question: It says "the pressure of the air at the nozzle must exceed that of the surrounding water." So the pressure difference is in Pascals, which is N/m². But the options are given as N/m, which is different. So maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the gauge pressure, which is the difference between the air pressure and the surrounding water pressure. So that's in Pascals. But the options are in N/m, which is equivalent to Pa/m. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to recheck.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the pressure gradient, not the pressure difference. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait! Wait, wait. Another approach: the excess pressure inside a bubble is given by ΔP = 4σ / d, because d is diameter, r is d/2. So substituting r = d/2, then 2σ / (d/2) = 4σ / d.

Ah, that's right. So ΔP = 4σ / d.

So using that, let's compute again.

Given d = 2 mm = 0.002 m.

So ΔP = 4 * 72.7e-3 N/m / 0.002 m.

Compute numerator: 4 * 72.7e-3 = 4 * 0.0727 = 0.2908 N/m.

Divide by 0.002 m: 0.2908 / 0.002 = 145.4 N/m² (or Pa).

Wait, but the options are in N/m. So unless the question is asking for something else, I might have a problem. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 143.4, which is close to my 145.4. But the units are N/m, but I have N/m². So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me confirm the correct formula.

After checking my notes (well, thinking), the correct formula for the pressure inside a bubble is ΔP = 4σ / d. Because for a bubble, considering both inner and outer surfaces, or perhaps more accurately, because the bubble is in a liquid, and the pressure difference is across the interface. Wait, no, I think the correct formula for a single surface is 2σ/r, which is the same as 4σ/d.

So I think my calculation is correct, leading to ΔP = 145.4 Pa. But none of the options exactly match that. Wait, let me see the options again.

Options:

A:50 N m^-1

B:143.4 N m^-1

C:125.6

D:180

E:215.1

F:72.7

G:87.3

H:100

I:190.2

J:160.8

Wait, the units in the options are N/m, not Pa. So I'm getting Pa, but the options are N/m. So that's a problem. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for pressure gradient, not pressure difference. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is being calculated in terms of the pressure gradient due to the surface tension. Or maybe the question is about the pressure inside the bubble, which would have units of Pa.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct, and I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the pressure difference comes from both surface tension and hydrostatic pressure. But the question doesn't mention depth, so perhaps it's only due to surface tension.

Wait, but the question is about the pressure of the air exceeding the surrounding water. So that's just the pressure difference at the point where the bubble is forming, which is due to surface tension. So the calculation I did should be correct, leading to about 145.4 Pa.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:143.4 N/m. But wait, that's N/m, not Pa. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question's options, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the surface tension in a different form. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 4σ/r with the correct numbers.

r = 1 mm = 0.001 m.

σ =72.7e-3 N/m.

So 4 * 72.7e-3 = 290.8e-3. 290.8e-3 / 0.001 = 290.8 N/m², which is 290.8 Pa.

Hmm, but that's not matching any options either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, thinking that it's 4σ/d, but perhaps it's 2σ/d. Let me try that.

Wait, 2σ/d would be 2 *72.7e-3 /0.002 = (0.1454) / 0.002 = 72.7 N/m², which is 72.7 Pa. But that's option F, which is 72.7 N/m. Hmm, but that's not matching the calculation. Because 2σ/d would give 72.7 Pa.

Wait, but the options are in N/m. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the pressure per meter, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula ΔP = 2σ/r, which would be 2 * 72.7e-3 / 0.001 = 145.4 N/m², which is 145.4 Pa. But again, the options are in N/m, not Pa.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the pressure gradient, like change in pressure over distance. But that's a different concept. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula.

Wait, let me think about units. The surface tension σ has units of N/m. So when I compute 2σ/r, the units would be (N/m) / m = N/m², which is Pa. So if the options are in N/m, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the surface tension force per unit length or something else, but that doesn't fit the context.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pressure difference as σ divided by radius, without the factor. But that would give 72.7e-3 / 0.001 = 72.7 N/m², which is 72.7 Pa. But that's option F, which is 72.7 N/m. So again, units don't match.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me look at the options again. Maybe I made a mistake in the way I'm handling the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔP = σ/(r), without the factor of 2 or 4. Let me try that. So 72.7e-3 / 0.001 = 72.7 N/m², which is 72.7 Pa. Again, that's option F, but the units are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔP = 2σ/d. Let me try that. So 2 *72.7e-3 / 0.002 = (0.1454) / 0.002 = 72.7 N/m², which is again 72.7 Pa. So same as before.

Wait, but none of the options in Pa match except perhaps if I'm miscalculating. Let me look back.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the radius in meters correctly. Let me recompute with d = 0.002 m, so r =0.001 m.

ΔP = 2σ / r = 2*(72.7e-3) / 0.001 = 2 * 0.0727 / 0.001 = 2 *72.7 = 145.4 N/m². So 145.4 Pa.

Looking at the options, option B is 143.4 N/m, which is close but the units are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the arithmetic.

Wait, 72.7e-3 is 0.0727. 4 * 0.0727 = 0.2908. 0.2908 / 0.001 is 290.8. So that would be 290.8 N/m², which is 290.8 Pa, but none of the options match that.

Wait, but option E is 215.1, which is lower. Option I is 190.2, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question was referring to the pressure gradient, which is the change in pressure per unit length. But that would be different. Or perhaps it's the pressure per meter, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and should have used the diameter instead of the radius. Wait, let me see.

If the formula is ΔP = 4σ / d, then using d=0.002 m:

ΔP =4 *72.7e-3 / 0.002 = (4 *0.0727) /0.002 = 0.2908 /0.002= 145.4 N/m², same as before.

Wait, but if the formula is 4σ/d, then yes, same result. So I'm getting 145.4 Pa, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B:143.4 N/m. But units are Pa vs N/m.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, another thought: the pressure inside the bubble must overcome both the surrounding water pressure and the surface tension. But the question says "by how much the pressure of the air at the nozzle must exceed that of the surrounding water." So if the water is at atmospheric pressure, the air pressure must be higher by ΔP due to surface tension.

So the calculation should be correct, but perhaps I should check the options again for a value close to 145.4. But looking at the options:

A:50

B:143.4

C:125.6

D:180

E:215.1

F:72.7

G:87.3

H:100

I:190.2

J:160.8

So option B is 143.4, which is close to my 145.4, but perhaps due to rounding. Let me recalculate precisely.

σ=72.7 ×1e-3 N/m.

So 4σ =4*72.7e-3 = 290.8e-3 N/m.

d=2 mm=0.002 m.

ΔP=4σ/d=290.8e-3 /0.002 = let's compute this.

290.8e-3 is 0.2908 N/m.

0.2908 divided by 0.002 equals:

0.2908 / 0.002 = 145.4 N/m².

Hmm, so exactly 145.4. But option B is 143.4. So perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the radius in meters correctly. Let me try 4σ/d again.

4 *72.7e-3 N/m = 0.2908 N/m.

d=0.002 m.

0.2908 / 0.002 = 145.4 N/m².

Yes, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the question intended to use the radius instead of the diameter. Let me try that.

If the diameter
