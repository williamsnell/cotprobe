Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the value of f(-1) for a polynomial f(t) = a + bt + ct². The polynomial passes through three points: (1, -1), (2, 3), and (3, 13). Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a polynomial passes through certain points, each point gives us an equation. Since it's a quadratic polynomial (because of the t² term), there are three coefficients to find: a, b, and c. And with three points, we should have three equations, which we can solve to find a, b, and c.

So, let's write down the equations based on each point.

The first point is (1, -1), which means when t=1, f(t)=-1. Plugging into f(t):
a + b*(1) + c*(1)² = -1
Simplifying, that's:
a + b + c = -1. Let's call this Equation 1.

The second point is (2, 3), so t=2, f(t)=3:
a + b*(2) + c*(2)² = 3
Which simplifies to:
a + 2b + 4c = 3. I'll call this Equation 2.

The third point is (3, 13), so t=3, f(t)=13:
a + b*(3) + c*(3)² =13
Which becomes:
a + 3b + 9c =13. Let's name this Equation 3.

Now I have three equations:

1. a + b + c = -1
2. a + 2b +4c =3
3. a +3b +9c=13

I need to solve this system of equations for a, b, c.

I think the best approach is to eliminate variables step by step. Maybe subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 and Equation 2 from Equation 3 to eliminate a.

Let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1:
(a +2b +4c) - (a +b +c) = 3 - (-1)
Simplify:
(0a) + (2b -b) + (4c -c) = 4
Which is:
b + 3c =4. Let's call this Equation 4.

Similarly, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:

Equation 3 - Equation 2:
(a +3b +9c) - (a +2b +4c) =13-3
Simplify:
(0a) + (3b-2b) + (9c-4c) =10
Which becomes:
b +5c =10. Let's call this Equation 5.

Now we have Equation 4 and 5:

4. b +3c =4
5. b +5c =10

We can subtract Equation 4 from Equation 5 to eliminate b:

Equation 5 - Equation 4:
(b +5c) - (b +3c) =10-4
Simplify:
0b +2c =6 → 2c=6 → c=3.

Now that we have c=3, plug this back into Equation 4 to find b:

Equation 4: b +3*(3)=4 → b +9=4 → b=4-9= -5.

Now we have b=-5 and c=3. Let's plug these into Equation 1 to find a:

Equation 1: a + (-5) +3 =-1 → a-2 =-1 → a=1.

So the coefficients are a=1, b=-5, c=3. So the polynomial is f(t)=1 -5t +3t².

Now the question is to find f(-1). Let's compute that:

f(-1) =1 + (-5)*(-1) +3*(-1)^2.
Calculating each term:

1 stays 1.

-5 * (-1) is +5.

3 * (-1)^2: (-1)^2 is 1, so 3*1=3.

Adding them up: 1 +5 =6, plus 3 is 9. So f(-1)=9.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 9. So the answer should be G.

To determine the value of \( f(-1) \) for the polynomial \( f(t) = a + bt + ct^2 \), we use the fact that the polynomial passes through the points \((1, -1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 13)\). This gives us a system of equations:

1. \( a + b + c = -1 \)  
2. \( a + 2b + 4c = 3 \)  
3. \( a + 3b + 9c = 13 \)  

### Step 1: Eliminate \( a \) to find \( b \) and \( c \)
Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:  
\[
(a + 2b + 4c) - (a + b + c) = 3 - (-1) \implies b + 3c = 4 \tag{4}
\]  
Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:  
\[
(a + 3b + 9c) - (a + 2b + 4c) = 13 - 3 \implies b + 5c = 10 \tag{5}
\]  

### Step 2: Solve for \( c \) and \( b \)
Subtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:  
\[
(b + 5c) - (b + 3c) = 10 - 4 \implies 2c = 6 \implies c = 3
\]  
Substitute \( c = 3 \) into Equation 4:  
\[
b + 3(3) = 4 \implies b = 4 - 9 \implies b = -5
\]  

### Step 3: Solve for \( a \)
Substitute \( b = -5 \) and \( c = 3 \) into Equation 1:  
\[
a + (-5) + 3 = -1 \implies a - 2 = -1 \implies a = 1
\]  

### Step 4: Write the polynomial and compute \( f(-1) \)
The polynomial is \( f(t) = 1 - 5t + 3t^2 \). To find \( f(-1) \):  
\[
f(-1) = 1 - 5(-1) + 3(-1)^2 = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9
\]  

Thus, the value of \( f(-1) \) is **9**, which corresponds to option **G**.
