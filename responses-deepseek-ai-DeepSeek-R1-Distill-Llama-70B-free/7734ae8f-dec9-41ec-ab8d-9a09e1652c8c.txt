Okay, so I've got this problem about distributing balls into boxes. Let me read it again. The question says: How many ways are there to distribute 13 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes, with the condition that no box can be left empty. The boxes are distinguishable, which I think means each box is unique, like different colors or labels.

Alright, so I remember that when distributing identical objects into distinct boxes, the problem usually falls under combinatorics, specifically the stars and bars method. I think stars and bars is the right approach here.

Wait, what's the stars and bars theorem again? Oh right, it's used to find the number of ways to distribute identical items into distinct groups. The formula when each box must have at least one item is (n-1 choose k-1), where n is the number of identical items and k is the number of boxes.

So in this problem, n is 13 balls and k is 4 boxes. Since no box can be empty, each box must have at least one ball. So applying the formula, it would be (13-1) choose (4-1), which is 12 choose 3.

Let me calculate 12 choose 3. The formula for combinations is n!/(k! (n-k)! ). So 12!/(3! * 9!) = (12*11*10)/(3*2*1) = 220.

Wait, but let me double-check. 12*11=132, then 132*10=1320. Divided by 6 (3*2*1) gives 220. Yeah, that's correct.

So the number of ways is 220. Looking at the options, option B is 220. So the answer should be B.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The condition that boxes are distinguishable aligns with the stars and bars approach, and each box must have at least one ball, so subtracting one from each box first makes sense. Yeah, I'm confident that's right.

To determine the number of ways to distribute 13 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes with no box left empty, we use the stars and bars method. The formula for this scenario is:

\[
\binom{n-1}{k-1}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of balls (13) and \( k \) is the number of boxes (4). Substituting the values, we calculate:

\[
\binom{13-1}{4-1} = \binom{12}{3}
\]

The combination \( \binom{12}{3} \) is computed as:

\[
\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 220
\]

Thus, the number of ways to distribute the balls is 220. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: 220**
