Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a child's temperament based on Thomas and Chess's theory. Let me think through this step by step.

The question describes a 3-year-old on her first day of preschool. She's holding onto her mother's hand tightly and watching the other kids play. But after a few minutes and some encouragement from the teacher, she starts to help another child with a puzzle.

Hmm, I remember that Thomas and Chess identified three main temperament types: easy, difficult, and slow to warm up. These are part of their goodness of fit model, which suggests that a child's behavior is influenced by their temperament and the environment around them.

So the easy child is adaptable, approaches new situations positively, and has a consistent mood. The difficult child is more intense, has trouble adapting, and might be more negative. The slow to warm up child is cautious when entering new situations but gradually becomes more comfortable after repeated exposure.

In the scenario, the child is initially hesitant—clinging to her mom and not joining in right away. That suggests she's not the easy type because easy children would probably jump right in. But she does start to participate after some time and coaxing. That makes me think she's slow to warm up because she needs a bit more time to adjust but isn't outright resistant or negative.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing the terms. Fast to adapt isn't one of the primary categories I remember. The options given are A: Easy, B: Fast to adapt, I: Slow to warm up. Oh, so the correct term here is slow to warm up, which is option I.

So the child is slow to warm up because she's initially hesitant but then begins to participate after some time and encouragement. That fits the description of this temperament style.

The child in the scenario is initially hesitant and clinging, indicating she isn't the "easy" type. However, after some time and encouragement, she begins to participate, which aligns with the "slow to warm up" temperament. This temperament describes children who are cautious in new situations but gradually become comfortable.

Answer: I
