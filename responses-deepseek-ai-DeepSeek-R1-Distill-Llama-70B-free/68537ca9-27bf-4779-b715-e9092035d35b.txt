Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the acidity of lemon juice. Let's see what it's asking. The pH of lemon juice is 2.1, and they're saying that the only acid present is citric acid, which is monoprotic. I remember that monoprotic means it can donate one proton, so it's a weak acid that doesn't completely dissociate in water.

The question is asking for the concentration of citric acid (HCit) in the juice. They've given the dissociation constant, Ka, which is 8.4 × 10^-4. I think I need to use the formula for the dissociation of a weak acid. Since HCit is a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely, so I can set up an equilibrium expression.

I recall that for a weak acid HA dissociating into H+ and A-, the Ka is [H+][A-]/[HA]. And since it's monoprotic, the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of Cit^- ions at equilibrium because each HCit molecule donates one H+.

The pH is 2.1, so the [H+] concentration should be 10^-pH. Let me calculate that: 10^-2.1. Hmm, I think that's approximately 7.94 × 10^-3 M. But maybe I should be more precise. Wait, 10^-2 is 0.01, and 10^-3 is 0.001. So 2.1 is between 2 and 3. Maybe I can approximate it as 7.94e-3 M. Alternatively, using a calculator, 10^−2.1 = 10^(−3 + 0.9) )= (10^-3)*(10^0.9). 10^0.9 is about 7.943, so yeah, 7.94e-3 M.

So, [H+] = 7.94e-3 M. Let's call this approximately 8e-3 for simplicity, though I should check if I need more precise numbers.

Since the dissociation is HCit → H+ + Cit^-, the concentration of H+ and Cit^- will be the same at equilibrium. Let’s denote the concentration of HCit as C, and the change as x. So at equilibrium:

HCit: C - x ≈ C (since x is small compared to C)
H+: x
Cit^-: x

So the Ka expression is (x)(x)/(C - x) ≈ x²/C = Ka.

We know that x is [H+] which is about 8e-3 M. So substituting into the equation:

x² / C = Ka → (8e-3)^2 / C = 8.4e-4.

Let me compute (8e-3)^2. 8e-3 squared is 64e-6, which is 6.4e-5.

So, 6.4e-5 / C = 8.4e-4.

Wait, solving for C:

C = 6.4e-5 / (8.4e-4) = (6.4 / 8.4) * 1e-5 / 1e-4 → 6.4/8.4 is about 0.7619, and 1e-5 /1e-4 is 0.1. So 0.7619 * 0.1 = 0.07619 M.

So approximately 0.076 M, which is 7.6e-2 M. Looking at the options, option A is 7.5e-2 M, which is very close. Option F is 5.0e-2, which is a bit lower. So probably the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait a second. I approximated [H+] as 8e-3, but the exact value is 7.94e-3. Let me recalculate with more precision.

x = 7.94e-3

x^2 = (7.94e-3)^2 = let's compute that. 7.94 squared is about 63.04, so x^2 is 63.04e-6, which is 6.304e-5.

So then, C = (6.304e-5) / (8.4e-4)

Calculating that:

6.304e-5 / 8.4e-4 = (6.304 / 8.4) * (1e-5 / 1e-4) → (approx 0.75) * 0.1 → 0.075.

So 0.075 M is 7.5e-2, which matches option A exactly.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the approximation is valid. The assumption that x is much smaller than C is important for the simplification. Let's check if x is small compared to C.

In this case, x is about 8e-3 M, and C is about 0.075 M. So x is 0.008 compared to 0.075. 0.008 is about 10.7% of 0.075. Hmm, that's not super small, but it's still under 10%, so the approximation should be acceptable. But in some cases, if the percent is higher, the approximation could cause errors. So maybe a more accurate approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the equation without the approximation.

So, without approximation, the Ka expression is:

x² / (C - x) = Ka.

And we have x = [H+] = 7.94e-3.

So substituting:

(7.94e-3)^2 / (C - 7.94e-3) = 8.4e-4.

Compute numerator: 63.0436e-6 = 6.30436e-5.

So 6.30436e-5 / (C - 0.00794) = 8.4e-4.

Multiply both sides by (C - 0.00794):

6.30436e-5 = 8.4e-4 * (C - 0.00794)

Compute 8.4e-4 * C - 8.4e-4 * 0.00794.

8.4e-4 * 0.00794 = approx 6.68e-6.

So 6.30436e-5 = 8.4e-4 C - 6.68e-6.

Bring 6.68e-6 to left:

6.30436e-5 + 6.68e-6 = 8.4e-4 C.

Adding them: 6.30436e-5 is 63.0436e-6, plus 6.68e-6 → 69.7236e-6 → 6.97236e-5.

So 6.97236e-5 = 8.4e-4 C → C = (6.97236e-5) / (8.4e-4) = approx 0.083 M.

Wait, that's higher than before. Wait, that can't be right because when I used the assumption, I got 0.075 M. Without the assumption, it's 0.083 M. So the approximation might have introduced some error.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct concentration is higher than 0.075 M. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is not present. The options have 7.5e-2 (0.075), 5e-2 (0.05), etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate without the approximation.

Equation: x² = Ka*(C - x)

x is 7.94e-3, Ka is 8.4e-4.

So:

(7.94e-3)^2 = 8.4e-4*(C -7.94e-3)

Compute left side: 7.94e-3 squared is 63.04e-6, which is 6.304e-5.

So:

6.304e-5 = 8.4e-4 C - 8.4e-4 *7.94e-3.

Compute 8.4e-4 *7.94e-3:

8.4e-4 is 0.00084, 7.94e-3 is 0.00794.

Multiply: 0.00084 * 0.00794 = let's calculate:

0.00084 * 0.00794 = 0.0000066756.

So 6.304e-5 = 8.4e-4 C - 6.6756e-6.

Bring 6.6756e-6 to left:

6.304e-5 + 6.6756e-6 = (63.04e-6 + 6.6756e-6) = 69.7156e-6 = 6.97156e-5.

So 6.97156e-5 = 8.4e-4 * C → C = 6.97156e-5 / 8.4e-4.

Compute that: 6.97156e-5 /8.4e-4 = (6.97156 / 8.4) * (1e-5 / 1e-4) → (approx 0.83) * 0.1 = 0.083 M.

Wait, so C is about 0.083 M, which is 8.3e-2 M. But looking at the options, option A is 7.5e-2, which is 0.075 M, and option F is 5e-2 (0.05). So none of the options is exactly 0.083, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation that x is much smaller than C, so C ≈ x² / Ka. Then as I did earlier, which gives 0.075 M, option A.

Wait, but wait. Because without the approximation, the C comes to about 0.083, but the options don't have that, so perhaps the assumption is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the H+ comes only from HCit. So in that case, using the approximation is acceptable, and the answer is 7.5e-2, option A.

Another thing to think about: the given Ka is 8.4e-4. So if I plug in C=0.075 M, what is the percent dissociation?

x = 7.94e-3, so x/C is 7.94e-3 / 0.075 = approx 0.1059, which is about 10.6%. So that's more than 5%, which is where the approximation might start to cause errors, but it's still manageable. So the calculated C using the approximation is 0.075 M, which is option A, but with the more precise calculation, it's 0.083 M, which isn't an option. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the options don't have 0.083 M. Let me look again. The options are:

A:7.5e-2 (0.075)

B:2.1e-3

C:1.2e-2

D:6.3e-5

E:9.0e-3

F:5.0e-2

G:4.2e-3

H:3.7e-4

I:8.4e-4

J:1e-2.1

So the closest is option A. Maybe the question expects us to use the approximation. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the equation correctly without the approximation. Let me try that.

The equation is x²/(C - x) = Ka → x² = Ka*(C - x)

We have x=7.94e-3, and Ka=8.4e-4.

So substituting:

(7.94e-3)^2 = 8.4e-4*(C -7.94e-3)

Left side: 63.0436e-6 = 6.30436e-5.

So 6.30436e-5 = 8.4e-4 C - 8.4e-4 *7.94e-3.

Compute 8.4e-4 *7.94e-3:

8.4e-4 is 0.00084, 7.94e-3 is 0.00794.

0.00084 * 0.00794 = let's compute this:

0.00084 * 0.007 = 0.00000588.

0.00084 * 0.00094 = 0.0000007896.

Adding: 0.00000588 + 0.0000007896 = 0.0000066696.

So 8.4e-4 *7.94e-3=6.6696e-6.

So now, 6.30436e-5 = 8.4e-4 C - 6.6696e-6.

Bring the 6.6696e-6 to the left:

6.30436e-5 + 6.6696e-6 = (63.0436 + 6.6696) e-6 → 69.7132e-6 → 6.97132e-5.

So:

6.97132e-5 = 8.4e-4 C → C = 6.97132e-5 / 8.4e-4.

Compute that:

6.97132e-5 /8.4e-4 → 6.97132 / 8.4 = approx 0.83, and 1e-5/1e-4 is 0.1. So 0.83 * 0.1 = 0.083 M.

Hmm, that's 0.083 M, which is 8.3e-2 M. But there's no option for that. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of H+ is coming only from the dissociation of HCit. So if the solution is more concentrated, maybe the approximation is not valid, but the options don't have 8.3e-2. So perhaps I should have stuck with the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:7.5e-2.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that the concentration of H+ is equal to sqrt(Ka * C), which is the formula we get when assuming that x is much smaller than C. So perhaps the intended approach is to use that formula, leading to C = x² / Ka.

In that case, using x=1e-2.1, which is approximately 7.94e-3.

So C = (7.94e-3)^2 / (8.4e-4) → 6.3e-5 / 8.4e-4 → 0.075 M, which is 7.5e-2. So option A is correct.

I think that's the approach expected here, so the answer should be A.

To determine the concentration of citric acid (HCit) in lemon juice, we start with the given information:

- **pH of lemon juice**: 2.1, so the hydrogen ion concentration is calculated as:

  \[
  [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-2.1} \approx 7.94 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
  \]

- **Dissociation constant of citric acid**: \( K_a = 8.4 \times 10^{-4} \).

Since citric acid is a monoprotic weak acid, its dissociation can be represented as:

\[
\text{HCit} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{Cit}^-.
\]

Let the initial concentration of citric acid be \( C \), and let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{H}^+\) and \(\text{Cit}^-\) at equilibrium. At equilibrium:

- \([\text{H}^+] = x = 7.94 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{Cit}^-] = x = 7.94 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{HCit}] = C - x \approx C\) (assuming \( x \ll C \)).

The expression for \( K_a \) is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{Cit}^-]}{[\text{HCit}]} = \frac{x^2}{C}.
\]

Substituting \( x = 7.94 \times 10^{-3} \) and \( K_a = 8.4 \times 10^{-4} \):

\[
C = \frac{x^2}{K_a} = \frac{(7.94 \times 10^{-3})^2}{8.4 \times 10^{-4}}.
\]

First, calculate \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (7.94 \times 10^{-3})^2 = 6.30436 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Now divide by \( K_a \):

\[
C = \frac{6.30436 \times 10^{-5}}{8.4 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 0.075 \, \text{M}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
C \approx 7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of citric acid in lemon juice is approximately \( 7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **option A**.

**Critical Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A (\( 7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \))**: Matches the calculated value and is correct.
- **Option B (\( 2.1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \))**: Too low; inconsistent with the calculations.
- **Option C (\( 1.2 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \))**: Too low; inconsistent with the calculations.
- **Option D (\( 6.3 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \))**: Far too low; inconsistent with
