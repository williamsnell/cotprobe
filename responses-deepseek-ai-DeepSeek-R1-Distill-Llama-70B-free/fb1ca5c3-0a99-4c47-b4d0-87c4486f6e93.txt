Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down the scenario. 

An investor is suing a corporation for stock fraud. During his case-in-chief, he wants to introduce a newspaper issue to show the stock price on a particular day. The corporation's attorney objects, and now we need to determine whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded, and under what grounds.

Hmm. I remember that evidence can be excluded for various reasons like hearsay, best evidence rule, or lack of an exception. So first, I should think about whether the newspaper article is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the newspaper is stating the stock price; if that's being offered to prove the stock price on that day, then it's hearsay. But wait, there are exceptions to hearsay.

What exceptions apply here? There's the business records exception under FRE 803(6). But wait, a newspaper isn't a business record of the company it's reporting on. Unless the newspaper itself is the entity keeping the records. Wait, no, the stock price would be recorded by the stock exchange, not the newspaper. So the newspaper is reporting the stock price, which they probably got from the stock exchange. So the newspaper's article would be hearsay unless another exception applies.

Another possibility is the market reports exception. I think under FRE 803(17), market reports and quotations are admissible. They're exceptions to the hearsay rule. So if the newspaper is a compilation of stock prices, maybe it's admissible under that.

Wait, but is the newspaper itself a market report? Or is it just a general publication that includes market data? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the market reports exception typically applies to things like official stock exchange reports or recognized publications that specialize in such data. Maybe a newspaper that regularly publishes stock prices would qualify. So if the newspaper is a reliable source that compiles market data, then using it under the market reports exception might be valid.

Alternatively, there's the public records exception, but that usually applies to government records. A newspaper wouldn't qualify as a public record. So option F is probably out.

Another angle is the best evidence rule. FRE 1002 says the original writing must be used if the content is crucial. But stock prices are typically facts that can be proved by any source that's reliable, so the best evidence rule might not require the original stock exchange records. Therefore, using a newspaper to show the stock price might not violate the best evidence rule because the rule doesn't apply when the evidence is about the fact itself, not the writing. So option I is probably not correct.

The business records exception (option B) requires that the record be made at or near the time of the event, by someone with knowledge, kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity. If the newspaper's stock price listing is part of their regular business activity, then maybe. But wait, the stock price itself is data from the stock exchange, not the newspaper's business. So the newspaper's report is hearsay because they're reporting what the stock exchange said. Unless the newspaper's own records of compiling the data qualify as a business record. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, the business records exception can sometimes apply to things like newspapers, but I think that's more for things like circulation records, not for reporting facts from other sources. So the stock price in the newspaper is hearsay, and unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible.

So which exception would apply? Market reports under 803(17) seem more likely. So option J says admitted under market reports exception. Alternatively, if the newspaper isn't considered a market report, then maybe it's hearsay without an exception, so it would be excluded.

I also thought about whether the newspaper could be a business record. For example, if the newspaper keeps a record of stock prices as part of their business, perhaps, but I'm not sure that's the case. Usually, the business records exception applies to the entity's own activities, not to reporting on others.

So if the newspaper's stock price is a market report, then option J is correct. Otherwise, if it's just hearsay without an applicable exception, it would be excluded. I'm leaning towards J because stock prices in newspapers are commonly admitted under the market reports exception.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Some sources say that stock tables in newspapers can be admitted under the market reports exception, but others might argue that the newspaper isn't the primary source. However, the market reports exception doesn't require the primary source, just that it's a recognized reliable compilation.

So, I think the correct answer is J: admitted under the market reports exception.

The question revolves around whether a newspaper issue can be admitted as evidence to show a corporation's stock price on a specific day. The investor seeks to introduce this evidence, but the corporation objects. The analysis focuses on whether the newspaper qualifies under an exception to the hearsay rule or other evidentiary rules.

1. **Hearsay Consideration**: The newspaper's report of the stock price is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (the stock price on that day). However, hearsay can be admissible if it falls under an exception.

2. **Market Reports Exception (FRE 803(17))**: This exception applies to market reports and quotations, which are considered reliable compilations of data. If the newspaper regularly publishes stock prices and is a recognized source for such information, it likely qualifies under this exception. Stock prices in newspapers are commonly admitted under this rule, as they are deemed reliable compilations of market data.

3. **Business Records Exception (FRE 803(6))**: While this exception applies to records made in the regular course of business, it is less likely to apply here because the newspaper is reporting data from the stock exchange, not generating it as part of its own business activities.

4. **Public Records Exception (FRE 803(8))**: This exception applies to government records, which a newspaper is not, so it does not apply here.

5. **Best Evidence Rule (FRE 1002)**: This rule requires the original document if the content is crucial. However, stock prices are facts that can be proven through reliable secondary sources, so this rule does not bar the newspaper's use.

6. **Conclusion**: The newspaper's report of the stock price is admissible under the market reports exception, as it is a reliable compilation of stock prices. This makes the correct answer **J: admitted under the market reports exception**.
