Question:

A furniture store had a truck that an employee of the store used to deliver furniture to the store's customers. One afternoon while the employee was driving the truck to deliver a chair to a customer, the employee negligently ran through a stop sign and hit a car. The driver of the car suffered a leg injury and succeeded in suing the furniture store, recovering $25,000. Assume that all of these events occur in a jurisdiction that has statutes permitting defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity. In the event that the furniture store brings suit against its employee (the truck driver) to recover for its losses, the furniture store will recover

Options:

A: $15,000, because the employee and the furniture store share 60-40 responsibility for the accident.
B: $25,000, unless the furniture store was fully insured against such losses.
C: nothing, because the furniture store should have maintained the truck in a safer condition.
D: $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident.
E: nothing, because the furniture store was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages.
F: $12,500, unless the furniture store had provided proper training to the employee.
G: nothing, because the employee was not acting negligently.
H: the full amount, only if the employee has sufficient personal insurance coverage.
I: $12,500, because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.
J: nothing, because the employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically dealing with employer and employee liability. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a furniture store's employee was driving the company truck to deliver a chair. While doing so, he negligently ran a stop sign and hit another car, injuring the driver. The driver sued the furniture store and won $25,000. Now, the store is suing the employee to get back the money they had to pay. The question is about how much the store can recover from the employee.

I remember that in tort law, when an employee commits a tort within the scope of their employment, the employer can be held vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. So the store was sued because the employee was working when the accident happened.

But now, the store is suing the employee for contribution or indemnity. I think the key here is understanding the difference between contribution and indemnity. Contribution is where each tortfeasor shares the liability, so if both are at fault, they split the damages. Indemnity is more about one party being held harmless by another, often when one is primarily responsible.

Wait, but the employee here was the one who was negligent. The employer's liability is vicarious, meaning they're liable because of the employee's actions, not because they were directly negligent themselves. So in terms of fault, the employee is the primary wrongdoer.

So when the employer (furniture store) pays the judgment to the injured driver, they might seek indemnity from the employee. Indemnity would allow the employer to recover the entire amount if the employee was solely at fault. Because the employee's negligence caused the accident, the employer didn't do anything wrong except for the employee's actions within the scope of employment.

Looking at the options:

Option B says $25k unless the store was fully insured. Hmm, I'm not sure about the insurance part. I don't think insurance affects the right to indemnity. So maybe B is incorrect because the insurance status doesn't matter here.

Option D says $25k because the employee was at fault. That sounds right because the employee's negligence makes them fully responsible, so the employer can recover the full amount.

Option J says nothing because the employee was acting within the scope. Wait, no. The fact that he was within scope means the employer is liable, but that doesn't prevent the employer from seeking indemnity from the employee. So J is incorrect.

Option E says nothing because the employer was primarily liable. But the employer's liability is vicarious, not primary. The primary liability is on the employee. So E is wrong.

Other options talk about shared responsibility or other factors, but I don't think that's the case here. The employee's negligence is the main issue, so the employer can recover the full $25k from him.
</think>

The correct answer is based on the principle that an employer held vicariously liable for an employee's negligence can seek indemnity from the employee if the employee was solely at fault. Here, the employee's negligence caused the accident, making him primarily responsible. The employer, having paid the judgment, can recover the full amount from the employee.
