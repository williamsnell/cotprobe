Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the latent heat of vaporization of liquid carbon tetrachloride at its boiling point, which is 350 K. Hmm, I remember that latent heat is related to the energy required to change a substance from liquid to gas without changing the temperature. 

The problem gives me an equation for the vapor pressure of CCl4: gP = -2400 T^-1 -5.30 log T + 23.60, where P is in mmHg. Wait, I think that's actually log base 10, right? So P equals 10 raised to that expression. Oh wait, wait, it's written as gP, which probably means log base 10 of P. So the equation is log P = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T + 23.60. 

Since the boiling point is given as 350 K, at that temperature the vapor pressure should be equal to atmospheric pressure, right? Because at the boiling point, the vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. So assuming standard atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg, which I think is correct. 

So I can plug T=350 into the equation to find P, but wait wait, I'm not even sure I need to calculate P. Because the latent heat of vaporization (ΔH_vap) can be found using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Oh right, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the change in vapor pressure with temperature to the enthalpy of vaporization.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is usually written as dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (TΔV), where ΔV is the change in volume upon vaporization. But assuming ideal gas behavior, the volume of the liquid is negligible compared to the gas, so ΔV is approximately equal to the molar volume of the gas. 

Wait, the equation can also be written in terms of the slope of log P vs 1/T. I think the integrated form might be more useful here. The integrated form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). But wait, but in this problem, we're given the vapor pressure as a function of T, so maybe I can find dP/dT at T=350 K and plug it into the equation.

So let's think. The derivative of P with respect to T at the boiling point would give dP/dT. Then, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we can solve for ΔH_vap.

Wait, first, let me get the equation for P. Since log P = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T +23.60, then P = 10^(-2400/T -5.30 log T +23.60). Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe it's easier to take the derivative of log P with respect to T, which would be d(log P)/dT = derivative of the right-hand side.

So let's compute d(log P)/dT. Let me denote log P as L, so L = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T +23.60.

Then, dL/dT = (2400)/(T^2) -5.30*(1/T) + 0 (since 23.60 is constant). So dL/dT = (2400)/(T²) - 5.30/T.

But wait, d(log P)/dT is equal to (1/P) dP/dT, right? Because d/dT (ln P) = (1/P) dP/dT. But here, log P is base 10, so d(log P)/dT = (1/(ln 10)) * (1/P) dP/dT. Because d/dT (log10 P) = (1/(P ln 10)) dP/dT.

So, putting it together:

(1/(ln 10)) * (1/P) (dP/dT) = (2400)/(T²) - 5.30/T.

So, solving for dP/dT gives:

dP/dT = P * (ln 10) * [ (2400)/(T²) - 5.30/T ].

Now, at the boiling point T=350 K, P=760 mmHg. So let's compute dP/dT at T=350.

First, let's compute each term.

Compute 2400/(350)^2.

350 squared is 122500, so 2400 /122500 = approx 0.01958.

Then, 5.30 / 350 = approximately 0.01514.

So the bracketed term is 0.01958 - 0.01514 = 0.00444.

Multiply by ln(10) which is approximately 2.3026.

So 0.00444 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.01022.

Then multiply by P=760 mmHg.

760 * 0.01022 ≈ 7.767.

So dP/dT ≈ 7.767 mmHg/K.

Now, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) * P / (T * (V_gas - V_liquid)).

But as mentioned earlier, V_liquid is negligible, so V_gas ≈ V.

For ideal gas, V = (nRT)/P. But per mole, so V_molar = RT/P.

So, V = (RT)/(P).

So substituting into the equation:

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) * (P) / (T * (RT/P)) )

Simplify denominator: T*(RT/P) = (R T²)/P.

So,

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) * P^2 / (R T²).

Wait, let me recheck that.

Wait: V = nRT/P. For one mole, n=1, so V = RT/P. So ΔV is V_gas - V_liquid ≈ V_gas = RT/P.

So, the equation dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T ΔV) = (ΔH_vap) / (T*(RT/P)) ) = (ΔH_vap P) / (R T²).

So,

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap P) / (R T²).

We can solve for ΔH_vap:

ΔH_vap = (dP/dT * R T²) / P.

We have dP/dT ≈7.767 mmHg/K.

Wait, but we need the units to be consistent. Because R is in J/(mol·K), but P is in mmHg and T is in K.

So we need to convert P to Pa or atm to make sure the units are correct. Because 1 atm is 760 mmHg, so P =760 mmHg = 1 atm.

Wait, but in the equation, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but pressure can be in atm. Let me think. Let's use units where P is in atm, T in K, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

Wait, but to compute ΔH_vap in cal/mol, perhaps it's better to use units that lead to calories. Alternatively, maybe using R as 8.314 J/mol·K and then converting to cal at the end.

So, let me proceed step by step.

Compute ΔH_vap = (dP/dT * R T²) / P.

We have:

dP/dT = 7.767 mmHg/K.

But P is 760 mmHg, which is 1 atm. So let's express dP/dT in atm/K.

Since 1 atm =760 mmHg,

dP/dT = 7.767 mmHg/K * (1 atm /760 mmHg) ) = 7.767 /760 atm/K ≈ 0.01021 atm/K.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So,

ΔH_vap = (0.01021 atm/K) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (350 K)^2 / (1 atm).

Wait, let's compute each part.

First, multiply 0.01021 atm/K by 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K:

0.01021 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.000838.

Then, multiply by T squared: 350^2 =122500.

So 0.000838 *122500 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.000838 * 122500 = 838 * 122.5 = Wait, 0.000838 is 8.38e-4.

So 8.38e-4 * 1.225e5 = 8.38 * 122.5 = Let's compute that.

122.5 *8 = 980, 122.5*0.38=46.55. So total 1026.55.

So approximately 1026.55 L·atm/(mol·K) * K² → because 350^2 gives K².

Wait, no, the units here: the calculation gives (atm/K * L·atm/mol·K) * K² → (L·atm² /mol).

Wait, but we're dividing by P, which is in atm, so the atm units would cancel.

Wait, let me think again about the units.

ΔH_vap = [ (dP/dT) * R * T² ) ] / P.

dP/dT has units atm/K.

R has units L·atm/(mol·K).

T is in K, so T² is K².

So, putting units together:

(atm/K) * (L·atm/(mol·K)) * K² → (L·atm²)/(mol).

Then, divide by P (atm): (L·atm²/mol) / atm → L·atm/mol.

So ΔH_vap has units of L·atm/mol. Then, we can convert that to joules or calories.

So, let's compute the value:

= (0.01021) * (0.0821) * (350)^2 / (1)

Calculating each part:

0.01021 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.000838.

0.000838 * (350)^2 = 0.000838 * 122500 = let's compute that.

0.000838 * 122500 = 0.838 * 122.5 = I'll compute 0.838 *122 = 102.236, 0.838 *0.5=0.419. Sum is 102.655.

So 102.655 L·atm/mol.

Now, convert L·atm to joules. 1 L·atm ≈ 101.325 J.

So 102.655 L·atm *101.325 J/(L·atm) ≈ 102.655 *101.325 ≈ let's calculate.

Approx 103 *100 is 10,300, but more precisely:

102.655 *100 =10,265.5

102.655 *1.325 = ?

Well, 100 *1.325=132.5, 2.655 *1.325 ≈ 3.52.

So 132.5 +3.52=136.02.

So total J is 10,265.5 +136.02≈10,401.5 J/mol.

Convert to cal: 1 cal =4.184 J, so 10,401.5 /4.184 ≈ let's see.

10,401.5 /4 ≈ 2600.375, but since 4.184 is higher, it'll be a bit less.

Compute 4.184 * 2500 = 10460, which is a bit higher than 10,401.5. So perhaps 2493 cal.

Wait, 4.184 *2400 = 10, 042.4. Hmm, 10,401.5 -10,042.4=359.1 left.

359.1 /4.184≈85.8.

So total is about 2400+85.8=2485.8 cal/mol. Approximately 2,486 cal/mol.

Wait, but the options are in thousands. Like 5000, 6000, etc. So 2486 is about 2.5 kcal/mol, but the options are 5k, 6k, etc. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up somewhere in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait a second, maybe I used the wrong value for R. Because sometimes R is used in different units, like 8.314 J/mol·K, but I used 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, which is correct for those units.

Wait, but when I calculated the L·atm, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me double-check the units.

Wait, ΔH_vap = (dP/dT * R T^2 ) / P.

But perhaps that equation isn't correct. Let me rederive it.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T ΔV).

ΔV is approx V_gas = (RT)/P (molar volume).

So substituting, dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / ( T*(RT/P) ) ) = (ΔH_vap P) / (R T^2).

So rearranged, ΔH_vap = (dP/dT * R T^2 ) / P.

Yes, that's correct.

So our calculation leads us to about 2486 cal/mol, which is approximately 2.5e3 cal/mol. But the options start at 5,000 (option G). So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in computing dP/dT.

Let me recalculate dP/dT.

Given log P = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T +23.60.

So, d(log P)/dT = 2400/T² -5.30*(1/T).

Because derivative of (-2400/T) is 2400/T².

Derivative of (-5.30 log T) is (-5.30)*(1/T).

So, d(log P)/dT = 2400/(T^2) - 5.30/T.

At T=350,

2400/(350^2) = 2400/122500 = 0.0195848.

5.30 /350 = 0.0151429.

So, 0.0195848 - 0.0151429 = 0.0044419.

Multiply by (1/ln10) to get d(ln P)/dT.

Because d(log10 P)/dT = (1/ln10) d(ln P)/dT.

So, d(ln P)/dT = (0.0044419)* ln10 ≈ 0.0044419 *2.3026 ≈ 0.01022.

Then, dP/dT = P * (d ln P/dT) = 760 mmHg * 0.01022 = 7.767 mmHg/K.

Wait, but when I converted that to atm/K, I got 7.767 /760 ≈ 0.01021 atm/K. That's correct.

So that part seems right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in R. Let me check the value of R in L·atm units.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So that's correct.

So, using that, we have:

ΔH_vap = (dP/dT * R * T²) / P.

Numbers:

dP/dT = 0.01021 atm/K.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T =350 K.

P =1 atm.

So, compute 0.01021 * 0.0821 * (350)^2 /1.

Compute 0.01021 * 0.0821 first.

0.01021 *0.0821 = approximately 0.000838.

Then, 350 squared is 122500.

Multiply 0.000838 *122500: 

0.000838 *122500 = 0.838 *122.5 = Let me compute 0.838 *122 = 102.236, 0.838 *0.5=0.419. Total 102.655.

So, 102.655 L·atm/mol.

Convert L·atm to J: 1 L·atm =101.325 J.

So 102.655 *101.325 = Let's compute 100 *101.325=10132.5, 2.655 *101.325≈268.63. So total ≈10332.5 J/mol.

Convert to cal: 10332.5 J * (1 cal/4.184 J) ≈ 10332.5 /4.184 ≈ around 2470 cal/mol.

Wait, that's about 2,470 cal/mol, but the options are way higher. So I must be missing a factor of 10 somewhere. Oh wait, did I forget to consider that the equation uses ln P and I used log P?

Wait, because the given equation is log10 P, so when we take the derivative, we have to account for the conversion from log10 to ln. So perhaps I missed a factor there.

Wait, in the expression d(log10 P)/dT = (1/ln10) * (dP/P)/dT.

Wait, no, earlier I correctly accounted for that. So that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the units for the latent heat are per mole, but I have per molecule? No, I used per mole in R.

Wait, perhaps I should have used Kelvin in the equation. No, I did use 350 K.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the derivative. Let me recompute d(log P)/dT.

At T=350,

d(log P)/dT = (2400)/(350)^2 -5.30/(350).

Compute 2400/122500: 2400/122500 = 0.0195848.

5.30/350=0.015142857.

So 0.0195848 - 0.015142857 = 0.0044419.

Multiply by ln(10) to get d(ln P)/dT.

0.0044419 *2.3026≈0.01022.

So dP/dT = P * 0.01022.

P is 760 mmHg, so dP/dT =760 *0.01022=7.767 mmHg/K.

But when converting to atm/K, it's 7.767/760 =0.01021 atm/K.

Hmm. So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the assumption that P is 760 mmH
