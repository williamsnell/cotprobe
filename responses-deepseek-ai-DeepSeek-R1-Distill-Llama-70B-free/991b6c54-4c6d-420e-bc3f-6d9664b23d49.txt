Okay, so I've got this problem about a flywheel, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. 

The problem says: A 3.5 ft. mean diameter cast-iron flywheel rotating at 250 rpm can furnish 750 ft.-lb. of energy. I need to calculate the thickness of the flywheel rim, given the width is at least 5 inches. Also, the speed variation can't exceed 19%. The specific weight of cast iron is 0.26 lbs per cubic inch.

Hmm, flywheels store energy, right? So the energy here is given as 750 ft-lb. I remember that the energy stored in a flywheel is related to its moment of inertia. The formula I think is E = (1/2) * I * ω², where E is energy, I is the moment of inertia, and ω is the angular velocity.

Wait, but wait. The flywheel's energy is being used, so maybe we're dealing with the change in energy when the flywheel slows down. Because the flywheel provides energy, its speed decreases, leading to a change in stored energy. Oh right, the problem mentions speed variation, which I think relates to the maximum allowable change in speed.

So, the speed variation is not to exceed 19%. I'm guessing that refers to the maximum change in speed, maybe the difference between the initial and final speed. So, if the flywheel's speed drops by 19%, that's the variation.

Let me think: If initial speed is ω1, and final speed is ω2, the variation is (ω1 - ω2)/ω1) * 100% = 19%. So ω2 = ω1 * (1 - 0.19) = 0.81 ω1.

The energy provided is the change in kinetic energy, which is E = (1/2) I (ω1² - ω2²). Because the flywheel loses energy, the difference between initial and final kinetic energy is 750 ft-lb.

So, substituting E = 750 ft-lb, and ω2 = 0.81 ω1.

Wait, but I need to relate this to the flywheel's dimensions. The moment of inertia for a flywheel depends on its mass distribution. Since it's a cast-iron flywheel, probably a solid disk or something similar, but the question mentions the rim's thickness and width. Oh right, maybe it's a rim-type flywheel where most of the mass is in the rim.

The moment of inertia for a thin ring is I = MR², where M is the mass and R is the radius. But if the rim has significant thickness, perhaps the formula is a bit different. Wait, the rim is treated as a circular ring with some thickness. So, maybe the formula can be approximated as I = (π * t * w * R³) * density, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, mass M is density * volume, and volume is area times circumference?

Wait, the flywheel is a disk with a rim. Maybe the formula for moment of inertia for a solid disk is (1/2) MR², but for a thin ring, it's MR². Maybe here, because it's a rim, the moment of inertia is approximated as I = k * MR², where k is a factor depending on the design. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the flywheel is modeled as a thin rim, so I can use I = MR². But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the moment of inertia of a solid cylinder (disk) is (1/2) MR². But if it's a thin ring, like a hoop, then I = MR². Since the problem mentions the rim's thickness and width, maybe it's a thin ring. So, I'll proceed with I ≈ MR².

Wait, but the flywheel is a disk with a certain thickness. So perhaps the mass is in the rim, and the formula I = MR² is applicable.

Anyway, proceeding. So E = (1/2) I (ω1² - ω2²). But ω2 = 0.81 ω1, so let's compute ω1² - ω2².

ω1² (1 - (0.81)^2) = ω1² (1 - 0.6561) = ω1² * 0.3439.

So E = (1/2) * I * ω1² * 0.3439.

But E is given as 750 ft-lb, so:

750 = 0.5 * I * ω1² * 0.3439.

Wait, but I need to express I in terms of the flywheel's dimensions.

The flywheel has mean diameter D = 3.5 ft. So radius R = D/2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75 ft. But I should convert that to inches because the width is given in inches and specific weight is in lbs per cubic inch. So 1.75 ft = 21 inches (since 1 ft = 12 inches, 1.75*12=21). So R=21 inches.

The rim's width is at least 5 inches. So the volume of the rim would be the area of the annulus times the width. Wait, but if the rim's width (axial width) is 5 inches, and the thickness is t, then the cross-sectional area is approximately the product of thickness t and width w=5 in. So the area A = t * w. Then the volume is A * circumference. The circumference is 2πR.

Wait, no. Wait, the rim is a circular ring with inner radius R_inner and outer radius R_outer. The cross-sectional area is (R_outer^2 - R_inner^2) * π, but if the thickness is t and the width is w=5 in, perhaps R_outer = R_inner + t? Wait, no. Wait, the width is the axial width, not the radial. Oh wait, no, the width refers to the radial dimension? Or the axial (length) dimension.

Wait, the flywheel's rim has a certain thickness (which is the question) and the width is given as minimum 5 inches. I think the width is the axial dimension, so the length of the rim in the axial direction is 5 inches. So when calculating volume, it's the area of the ring (π(R_outer^2 - R_inner^2)) multiplied by the width (axial length, 5 inches). So volume V = 5 * π (R_outer^2 - R_inner^2).

But for a thin rim, R_outer ≈ R_inner = R_mean. So perhaps R_outer = R + t/2 and R_inner = R - t/2. But if the rim is thin, maybe t is small compared to R, so (R_outer + R_inner) ≈ 2R, and (R_outer^2 - R_inner^2) = (R_outer - R_inner)(R_outer + R_inner) ≈ t*(2R). So V ≈ 5 * π * t * 2R * (1/2) ? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the area of the ring is π(R_outer² - R_inner²). If R_outer = R + t/2 and R_inner = R - t/2, then R_outer + R_inner = 2R. R_outer² - R_inner² = (R + t/2)^2 - (R - t/2)^2 = [R² + Rt + (t²)/4] - [R² - Rt + (t²)/4] = 2Rt. So A = π*(2Rt). So volume is A * width = 2πRt * width. So V = 2πR * t * w, where w is the width (axial length, 5 inches).

So mass M is density * volume. Density given as specific weight is 0.26 lbs per cubic inch. So M = 0.26 lb/in³ * V. Since V is in cubic inches, M is in lbs.

Putting it all together:

V = 2πR * t * w => V = 2 * π * 21 in * t * 5 in.

So V = 2 * π * 21 *5 * t = 210 π t in³.

So M = 0.26 * 210 π t = 54.6 π t lbs.

Then, the moment of inertia I for a thin ring is I = M R².

So I = (54.6 π t) * (21)^2.

Wait, 21 inches is the radius. So I = M R² = 54.6 π t * 441.

So I = 54.6 * 441 * π * t. Let me compute that.

54.6 * 441 = let me calculate. 54 * 441 = 54 * 400=21600, 54 *41=2214 → total 23814. Then 0.6 *441=264.6 → 23814 +264.6=24078.6. So I =24078.6 * π * t in lb·in².

Wait, but the energy equation was in ft-lb. I need to make sure the units are consistent. Hmm. Let's see.

Wait, the energy E is given in ft-lb. The moment of inertia I is in slug·ft², but maybe I should convert units to keep everything consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert everything to inches and use appropriate unit conversions.

Wait, let me think about the units.

In the energy equation, E is in ft-lb. The angular velocity ω is in radians per minute. So, I need to convert ω to radians per second, perhaps.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert everything into inch units and use lb, inches, and seconds.

But this might get complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, express all variables in consistent units.

Given:

- Diameter D = 3.5 ft = 42 inches (since 3.5 *12=42). So radius R = 21 inches.

- Speed N =250 rpm. So ω = 2π N /60 = (2π *250)/60 rad/min. But radian is dimensionless, so perhaps better to convert to radian per second? Or maybe not, because in the energy equation, the units have to match.

Wait, in the energy equation E = (1/2) I ω², the units of E are energy (ft-lb), I is in slug·ft², and ω is in rad/s.

Hmm, so perhaps I should convert ω to rad/s.

So, ω in rad/s = (2π * N) /60 = (2π *250)/60 ≈ (500π)/60 ≈ 26.18 rad/s.

Wait, but wait: 250 rpm is 250 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2π radians. So per minute, the rotation is 250 * 2π radians. Per second, that's (250 * 2π) /60 ≈ (500 * 3.1416)/60 ≈ 1570.8 /60 ≈ 26.18 rad/s. So ω1 ≈26.18 rad/s.

But wait, when the speed drops to ω2 =0.81 ω1, so ω2 ≈21.15 rad/s.

So, the energy equation is E = ½ I (ω1² - ω2²).

But I is in slug·ft². Because E is in ft-lb, and 1 slug·ft² is (1 lb·ft²/slug), but wait, no. Wait, the unit conversions can get tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express everything in inches, but let's see.

Wait, so I have I in terms of t (the thickness). I can write I in terms of t, then plug into E and solve for t.

But I need to make sure units are consistent. Let's try to express everything in inches and seconds.

So, E = 750 ft-lb =750 *12 in-lb =9000 in-lb.

The moment of inertia I is in slug·in². But I'm more familiar with I in terms of mass (lb·s²/in), but perhaps I should convert the mass to slugs.

Wait, specific weight is given as 0.26 lb/in³. So the density ρ is 0.26 lb/in³. Mass m = ρ * V, so V is in in³, so m = 0.26 lb/in³ * V (in³) = m in lb.

But in the moment of inertia, I need mass in slugs because I = MR². So 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/in.

So mass m in slugs is m = (0.26 lb/in³ * V) / 32.174 lb·s²/in.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the formula in terms of mass (lb) and then adjust units accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula with mass in lb, and use the conversion factor for the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for energy in terms of mass, radius, and speed.

Wait, E = (1/2) I ω². I (moment of inertia) for a ring is I = MR². So E = (1/2) MR² ω².

So, if I can express E in ft-lb, M in lb, R in ft, and ω in rad/s, the units should work out.

Let me try that.

So, R is 21 inches = 1.75 ft.

ω is 26.18 rad/s.

E = 750 ft-lb.

So E = (1/2) M R² ω².

But wait, the energy comes from the flywheel, so E is the change in energy. So E is (1/2) M R² (ω1² - ω2²).

We have ω2 = 0.81 ω1.

So, E = 0.5 * M R² (ω1² - (0.81 ω1)^2) = 0.5 M R² ω1² (1 - 0.6561) = 0.5 M R² ω1² (0.3439).

So E = 0.5 * 0.3439 * M R² ω1² = 0.17195 * M R² ω1².

Now, solving for M:

M = E / (0.17195 R² ω1²).

Plugging in the numbers:

E =750 ft-lb,

R=1.75 ft,

ω1=26.18 rad/s.

Compute R squared: (1.75)^2 = 3.0625 ft².

ω1 squared: (26.18)^2 ≈685.6 rad²/s².

So,

M =750 / (0.17195 *3.0625 * 685.6 )

Let me compute the denominator:

0.17195 *3.0625 ≈0.5273.

0.5273 *685.6 ≈362.3.

So denominator ≈362.3.

Thus, M ≈750 / 362.3 ≈2.072 lb.

Wait, but M is the mass of the flywheel? That seems really small. Because cast iron is heavy.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, specific weight is given as 0.26 lb/in³. So density is 0.26 lb per cubic inch. Which is a high density, as cast iron is.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, I computed M as 54.6 π t in lb, which is based on volume in in³. So if M is 54.6 π t lb, and I've just found M ≈2.07 lb, then t would be approximately 2.07/(54.6 π). Let me compute that.

t = 2.07 / (54.6 * π) ≈ 2.07 / (171.4) ≈0.012 in. That's way too small. But the options are in inches, like 0.5 in, etc. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, when I converted E to 9000 in-lb, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me redo the calculation in inch units.

E =750 ft-lb =750 *12 in-lb =9000 in-lb.

R =21 inches.

ω1 in rad/s is 26.18 rad/s.

So, E = 0.17195 * M R² ω1².

So,

M = E / (0.17195 R² ω1² )

E=9000 in-lb,

R=21 in,

ω1=26.18 rad/s.

Compute R²: 21²=441 in².

ω1 squared: ~685.6 rad²/s².

So denominator: 0.17195 *441 *685.6.

Compute 0.17195 *441: 0.17195 *400=68.78, 0.17195*41≈7.05 → total ≈75.83.

75.83 *685.6 ≈52,000.

So denominator ≈52,000.

So M =9000 /52000 ≈0.173 lb.

Wait, that's even smaller. Hmm, perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, let's think again about the moment of inertia. Maybe I should model the flywheel differently. Maybe it's not a thin ring. Earlier, I assumed I = MR², but perhaps for a solid disk, it's (1/2) MR². But if the flywheel is a solid disk, then I = 0.5 MR². So, perhaps I was using the wrong I formula.

Wait, the problem says it's a flywheel with a rim, and the width is 5 inches. So maybe the flywheel is more like a solid disk, but with significant mass in the rim. But perhaps for a disk, I = (1/2) MR².

So, perhaps I should recalculate using I = 0.5 MR².

Let me try that.

So, E = (1/2) I (ω1² - ω2² )

But I =0.5 M R².

So,

E = (1/2)(0.5 M R²)(ω1² - ω2²) = (1/4) M R² (ω1² - ω2² )

Again, ω2=0.81 ω1, so:

E = (1/4) M R² (ω1² (1 - 0.81² )) = (1/4) M R² ω1² (0.3439 )

So, E = (0.25) * (0.3439) M R² ω1² = 0.085975 M R² ω1².

So,

M
