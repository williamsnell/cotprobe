Okay, I have this question about PyTorch commands, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. So, the question is asking which commands produce two specific matrices: a 10x5 Gaussian matrix and a 10x10 uniform matrix. Each entry in the Gaussian should be i.i.d. from N(μ=5, σ²=16), and the uniform from U[-1,1).

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each part of the options does. I remember that in PyTorch, there are functions like torch.normal(), torch.randn(), and torch.rand() that generate different distributions.

Starting with the Gaussian matrix. The parameters are μ=5 and σ²=16. So σ, the standard deviation, is the square root of 16, which is 4. So for a normal distribution, each element should have mean 5 and standard deviation 4.

Wait, but how are these functions used? I think torch.normal() takes mean and standard deviation, while torch.randn() gives a standard normal (mean 0, std 1), so to get the desired parameters, you scale and shift it.

So for the Gaussian matrix, one approach is to use torch.normal(mean, std). Another is to do something like mean + torch.randn(...) * std.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B says 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4. That makes sense because the mean is 5, and the std is 4. So this would give the correct distribution.

Other options use torch.normal with specific parameters. Like option D uses torch.normal with ones multiplied by 5 and 16. Wait, wait—because the second argument to torch.normal is the standard deviation squared? Or is it the variance or the standard deviation itself?

Wait, I think in PyTorch, the second argument to torch.normal is the standard deviation, not variance. Because the documentation says that the function is torch.normal(mean, std, ...). So if someone writes torch.normal(..., torch.ones(...)*16), that would imply a standard deviation of 16, which is not what we need because σ is 4. So that would be incorrect for the Gaussian part.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The variance is σ², which is 16. So standard deviation is 4. So any command that uses a standard deviation of 4 is correct. So looking at the options:

Option B uses 5 + 4 * torch.randn(10,5), which is correct.

Option D uses torch.normal with std being 16, which would make the standard deviation 16, leading to a variance of 256. That's wrong because we need variance 16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the second argument to torch.normal is the standard deviation, then using 16 would be wrong. So option D's first part is incorrect. So D's Gaussian matrix would have std 16, which is not desired.

So the correct way for the Gaussian is either using 5 + 4*torch.randn(10,5) or using torch.normal with mean 5 and std 4.

Wait, looking at the options, option H has torch.normal with std 4, because the second argument is ones multiplied by 4. So that's correct.

But let me check the first option for each choice to see which is correct.

Wait, the question is about which pair of commands is correct for both matrices. So both parts need to be right.

So the Gaussian matrix needs to be 10x5, and the uniform 10x10.

Now, looking at the uniform part. Each entry is from U[-1,1). So how do we generate that in PyTorch.

I recall that torch.rand() generates from U[0,1). So to get from [-1, 1), you can do something like 2*torch.rand(...) -1. Because 0 to 1 scaled by 2 is 0 to 2, subtract 1 gives -1 to 1. So that's one way.

Alternatively, there's torch.uniform() which might take low and high. But I'm not sure about the exact function name. Let me think—PyTorch has torch.uniform_() which I think is for generating in-place, but perhaps in recent versions, like 1.8, maybe there's a function like torch.uniform with low and high.

Wait, checking the options:

Option C's uniform part is torch.uniform_(10,10, low=-1, high=1). Hmm, but wait, is that the correct way to call it? I thought that the function might be called with torch.uniform(low, high, size), but maybe I'm mixing up the parameters.

Alternatively, another approach is to use (torch.rand(10,10) - 0.5) / 0.5, but that might not be the most straightforward way. Wait, let's see:

Wait, if I take torch.rand(10,10), which is U[0,1). Subtract 0.5, that shifts the range to [-0.5, 0.5). Then divide by 0.5, which scales it to [-1,1). Because for example, 0 becomes -0.5, then divided by 0.5 is -1. 0.5 becomes 0, so 0. 1 becomes 0.5, divided by 0.5 is 1. So yes, that works. So that's another way.

Alternatively, 2*torch.rand(...) -1.

So for the uniform part, the correct expressions would be either:

torch.uniform_(...) with low=-1 and high=1.

Or 2*torch.rand(10,10) -1.

Or (torch.rand(...) - 0.5) / 0.5.

Wait, let's see the options.

Option A's uniform part is (torch.rand(10,10) - 0.5)/0.5. That would give the right range.

Option B's uniform part is 2*torch.rand(10,10) -1. That's correct.

Option C's uniform is torch.uniform_(...) which I'm not sure about the parameters. Wait, does the function take size as first argument? Or low and high as first parameters? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, in PyTorch, the function for generating a tensor with uniform distribution is torch.rand(), but for more control, like low and high, I think they have a function called torch.uniform(), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's part of torch.distributions, but assuming the code uses standard functions.

Wait, looking at the options, for example, option C uses torch.uniform_(...) with low and high. But I'm not sure if that's the correct function. Alternatively, maybe the function is called with torch.uniform(low, high, size), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use torch.rand() and then scale.

So for the uniform matrix:

Method 1: 2 * torch.rand(10,10) -1 → gives U[-1,1).

Method 2: (torch.rand(10,10) -0.5)/0.5 → same result.

Method 3: using a function like torch.uniform(low=-1, high=1, size=(10,10)), but I'm not sure if that's the correct function name and parameters.

Looking at the options:

Option B uses 2*torch.rand(10,10)-1 → correct.

Option D's uniform part is torch.uniform_(...) with low=-1, high=1. Assuming that function exists and works that way, that's correct.

Option C's uniform part is torch.uniform_ which might be correct, but I'm not certain about the function's parameters.

Wait, I'm trying to recall: in PyTorch, the function torch.uniform_ is an in-place function. So perhaps the correct usage is to provide a tensor and then the low and high. Like x.uniform_(low, high). But in the options, for example, option C writes torch.uniform_(10,10, low=-1, high=1). That doesn't seem right because the first two arguments would represent size, but perhaps they're using it as a function that creates a new tensor. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be torch.uniform with those parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct function is torch.rand(...) with low and high, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again. For a uniform distribution in PyTorch, the function is torch.rand which generates from 0 to 1. To get a different range, you can scale and shift, as in 2*torch.rand(...)-1.

Alternatively, there's a function called torch.uniform which might take low and high, but I'm not sure when it was introduced. Assuming that in PyTorch 1.8, the uniform function exists.

So, for the uniform part, the correct way could be either using 2*torch.rand(...)-1 or using torch.uniform with low and high.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B's uniform part is 2*torch.rand(10,10)-1 → correct.

Option D's uniform part is torch.uniform_(10,10, low=-1, high=1). Wait, I'm not sure if the syntax is correct. I think the correct function for creating a uniform tensor with specified low and high is torch.uniform, not torch.uniform_. Because the underscore usually denotes in-place operations.

So perhaps D's uniform part is incorrect because it uses _.

Looking at option E's uniform part: torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1). I don't think that's correct because torch.rand doesn't take low and high as parameters. So E's uniform is wrong.

So, considering all that, the correct uniform part is either using the scaling method or the correct function.

Now, let's look at each option.

Option B:

Gaussian: 5 + 4*torch.randn(10,5) → correct.

Uniform: 2*torch.rand(10,10)-1 → correct.

So both parts are correct. So B is a candidate.

Wait, but let me check other options.

Option H:

Gaussian: torch.normal( ones*5, ones*4 ) → correct because mean is 5, std 4.

Uniform: 2*torch.rand(10,10)-1 → correct.

So H's Gaussian is correct, and uniform is correct.

Wait, but looking back, option H's first command is torch.normal with var? Wait, no, earlier I thought the second argument is std. So in H, it's std 4, which is correct.

So H's both parts are correct. So H would be a possible answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because in the Gaussian part, the way the mean and std are provided matters.

In option H, the code is:

torch.normal(torch.ones(10,5)*5, torch.ones(5,5)*4).

Wait, but the mean and std in torch.normal can be tensors, but they have to broadcast correctly. So a 10x5 mean matrix and a 5x5 std matrix. Hmm, will that broadcast correctly? Because the std is of shape (5,5) and the mean is (10,5). So when you broadcast, each row in mean (size 5) would be paired with each row in std (size 5), but how does that affect the 10 rows in mean?

Wait, perhaps it's better to have the std as a scalar or a tensor that can broadcast. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to have the mean as a scalar 5 and std as 4, but in option H, it's using tensors.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about that. Let me think: when you do torch.normal(mean_tensor, std_tensor), the shapes of mean and std must be broadcastable to the same shape as the output. So if the output is 10x5, the mean and std must be broadcastable to that shape.

In option H, the mean is 10x5 (each element is 5), and std is 5x5 (each element is 4). So when you broadcast mean (10x5) and std (5x5) to 10x5, what happens? Because the std's first dimension is 5 and mean's is 10, so broadcasting would require that the std's first dimension be 1 or compatible with 10. But here, 5 and 10 are different, so broadcasting would fail. So that would cause an error.

Ah, that's a problem. So option H's first part would cause a broadcasting error. Because the mean is 10x5 and the std is 5x5. So when you try to broadcast together, the sizes don't match.

So that makes option H incorrect. Because the code would throw an error when trying to create the normal tensor.

So H is not a correct option.

So back to option B. The Gaussian part uses 5 + 4*torch.randn(10,5), which is correct.

The uniform part uses 2*torch.rand(10,10)-1, which is correct.

So option B seems correct.

Wait, but what about option D?

Option D's Gaussian part is torch.normal(ones*5, ones*16). Wait, no, the second argument is 16, which is the std. But earlier analysis said that the std is 4, so 16 would be wrong. So D's Gaussian is wrong.

Wait, no—wait, the parameters are μ=5 and σ²=16, so σ=4. So any command that uses std=4 is correct. So in D's first part, the std is 16, which is wrong. So D's first part is incorrect.

So the correct options are either B or H, but H's first part is incorrect due to broadcasting issues.

Wait, but let me check other options. Like option G:

G's Gaussian is torch.normal(ones*5, ones*16). So same issue as D, std is 16, which is wrong.

So only option B's Gaussian is correct.

What about the uniform part in option B? It's 2*torch.rand(10,10) -1, which is correct.

So option B is correct for both parts.

Wait, but let me check if any other option could also be correct.

Looking at option J:

Gaussian part is 5 + 16*torch.randn(10,5). That's wrong because std is 16, but we need 4. So J's Gaussian is wrong.

Option C's Gaussian is 5 + 4*torch.randn(10,5) → correct. But the uniform part is torch.uniform_(10,10, low=-1, high=1). I'm not sure if this is correct. Because the _ suggests it's an in-place function, which would require an existing tensor. So perhaps that's incorrect because it's being called without a tensor to modify.

So option C's uniform part is wrong.

Option F's Gaussian is 5 +4*torch.randn(...) → correct. Uniform part is torch.rand with low=-1 and high=1. But I don't think torch.rand accepts low and high as parameters. So F's uniform part is incorrect.

So the only option that has correct Gaussian and correct uniform is option B.
</think>

To determine the correct PyTorch commands for generating the desired matrices, we analyze each option based on the requirements:

1. **Gaussian Matrix ($10 \times 5$)**: Each entry should be i.i.d. from $\mathcal{N}(\mu=5, \sigma^2=16)$. Here, $\mu=5$ and $\sigma=4$ (since $\sigma^2=16$). The correct approach is to either:
   - Use `torch.normal` with `mean=5` and `std=4`.
   - Use `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 4`, where `torch.randn` generates a standard normal distribution (mean=0, std=1), scaled by $\sigma=4$ and shifted by $\mu=5$.

2. **Uniform Matrix ($10 \times 10$)**: Each entry should be i.i.d. from $U[-1,1)$. The correct approaches are:
   - Use `2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1`, where `torch.rand` generates from $U[0,1)$, scaled and shifted to $U[-1,1)$.
   - Use `torch.uniform` with `low=-1` and `high=1` (assuming the function is available and correctly implemented).

### Analysis of Each Option:

- **Option A**:
  - Gaussian: `torch.normal(torch.ones(10,5)*5, torch.ones(5,5)*16)` is incorrect because the standard deviation is set to 16 instead of 4.
  - Uniform: `(torch.rand(10,10) - 0.5) / 0.5` is correct for $U[-1,1)$.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the Gaussian part.

- **Option B**:
  - Gaussian: `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 4` is correct, as it generates a normal distribution with $\mu=5$ and $\sigma=4$.
  - Uniform: `2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1` is correct for $U[-1,1)$.
  - **Conclusion**: Correct for both parts.

- **Option C**:
  - Gaussian: `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 4` is correct for the Gaussian part.
  - Uniform: `torch.uniform_(10,10, low=-1, high=1)` is problematic because `torch.uniform_` is an in-place function and is not called correctly here.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the uniform part.

- **Option D**:
  - Gaussian: `torch.normal(torch.ones(10,5)*5, torch.ones(5,5)*16)` is incorrect because the standard deviation is set to 16 instead of 4.
  - Uniform: `torch.uniform_(10,10, low=-1, high=1)` is problematic for the same reason as in Option C.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect due to both parts.

- **Option E**:
  - Gaussian: `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 16` is incorrect because the standard deviation is set to 16 instead of 4.
  - Uniform: `torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1)` is incorrect because `torch.rand` does not accept `low` and `high` as parameters.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect due to both parts.

- **Option F**:
  - Gaussian: `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 4` is correct for the Gaussian part.
  - Uniform: `torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1)` is incorrect because `torch.rand` does not accept `low` and `high` as parameters.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the uniform part.

- **Option G**:
  - Gaussian: `torch.normal(torch.ones(10,5)*5, torch.ones(5,5)*16)` is incorrect because the
