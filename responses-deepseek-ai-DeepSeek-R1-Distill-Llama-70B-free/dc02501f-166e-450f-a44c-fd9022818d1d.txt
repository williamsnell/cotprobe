Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the molar constant volume heat capacity of I2 gas and determining the vibrational contribution. Hmm, right, I remember that heat capacity at constant volume, Cv, is related to the degrees of freedom of the molecule.

I think for diatomic gases, there are translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions. Oh wait, but wait. The question says that the electronic contribution is negligible, so I can ignore that. So the total heat capacity is the sum of translational, rotational, and vibrational parts.

Wait, I recall that for a diatomic molecule, each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)R. So for translation, that's 3 degrees, right? So (3/2)R. Then for rotation, if it's a diatomic, I think there are 2 rotational degrees of freedom. So another (2/2)R, which is R. So that's (3/2 + 1) R for translation and rotation combined.

But wait, wait. What's R? Oh, right, R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/mol·K. So putting that together, the translational and rotational contribution would be (5/2) R, which is (5/2)*8.314. Let me calculate that. 5/2 is 2.5, multiplied by 8.314 gives... 2.5 * 8 is 20, 2.5 * 0.314 is about 0.785, so total around 20.785 J/mol·K.

Wait, but the given heat capacity is 28.6 J/mol·K. So if I subtract the translational and rotational part from the total, what's left should be the vibrational contribution, right? Because the total is the sum of all contributions.

So vibrational contribution = total Cv - (translational + rotational Cv). So that's 28.6 - 20.785. Let me compute that: 28.6 minus 20.785, which is 7.815 J/mol·K. Hmm, but wait, I might have made a mistake because I think vibrational modes contribute differently. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait another thing.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up something. Because sometimes, in heat capacity, the vibrational contribution is considered to be (1/2) R for each vibrational mode, but only at high temperatures where vibrations are active. But wait, the problem says to find the vibrational contribution, so perhaps in this case, the molecule is treated as having certain vibrational modes contributing.

Wait, I might be complicating this. Let me think again. So the total Cv is given as 28.6. The translational and rotational contributions are (5/2) R, which would be 5/2 * 8.314. Let me compute 5/2 * 8.314 accurately. 8.314 * 5 is 41.57, divided by 2 is 20.785. So yes, 20.785 J/(mol·K).

So the vibrational part would be 28.6 - 20.785 = 7.815 J/(mol·K). But wait, looking at the options, I don't see exactly 7.815. Let me check the options again.

Options from A to J: A is ~4.44, B ~5.36, C 11.67, D 9.14, E ~4, F 8.72, G~10.45, H~7.82, I~12.56, J~6.23.

Wait, option H is 7.82, which is close to 7.815. That's probably the right answer. But wait, I thought the vibrational contribution is (1/2) R per vibrational mode. But wait, diatomic molecules have how many vibrational modes? One, because they can only stretch along the bond axis. So each vibrational mode contributes (1/2 R) for potential and (1/2 R) for kinetic, totaling R. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, for each vibrational mode, you have two quadratic terms in the energy (kinetic and potential), each contributing (1/2)kT per molecule, so per mole that would be R. So each vibrational mode contributes R to the heat capacity at constant volume.

Wait, but wait, that's only when the vibrational modes are fully excited, which is at high temperatures. So for diatomic molecules like I2, which is a heavy molecule, the vibrational modes might not contribute much at room temperature. Wait, but the problem gives the total Cv as 28.6, which is higher than (5/2) R (~20.78), so the difference is about 7.82, which would be the vibrational part. But wait, if each vibrational mode contributes R, that's 8.314. So the calculated value is 28.6 - 20.785 = 7.815, which is close to 7.82. So that's option H.

Wait, but wait, another point. Maybe the vibrational contribution isn't fully active, so it's less than R. But the way the question is phrased, I think we're supposed to subtract the translational and rotational parts and assign the rest to vibration, regardless of whether it's fully active. So the answer should be around 7.82, which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do the subtraction again. 28.6 minus 20.785. Let's compute 28.6 - 20.785:

28.6 is 28.600

Minus 20.785 is:

28.600 - 20.785 = 7.815 J/(mol·K). So approximately 7.815, which is very close to 7.82, which is option H.

So I think the correct answer is H.

To determine the vibrational contribution to the heat capacity of $\mathrm{I}_2(\mathrm{~g})$, we start by analyzing the total molar constant volume heat capacity, $C_v$, which is given as $28.6 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$. The total heat capacity is the sum of contributions from translational, rotational, and vibrational degrees of freedom. Electronic contributions are stated to be negligible and can be ignored.

For a diatomic molecule like $\mathrm{I}_2$, the translational and rotational contributions to $C_v$ are calculated as follows:

1. **Translational contribution**: A diatomic molecule has 3 translational degrees of freedom, each contributing $\frac{1}{2}R$. Thus, the translational contribution is:
   \[
   C_v^{\text{trans}} = \frac{3}{2}R
   \]
2. **Rotational contribution**: A diatomic molecule has 2 rotational degrees of freedom, each contributing $\frac{1}{2}R$. Thus, the rotational contribution is:
   \[
   C_v^{\text{rot}} = R
   \]

Adding these together, the combined translational and rotational contribution is:
\[
C_v^{\text{trans + rot}} = \frac{3}{2}R + R = \frac{5}{2}R
\]

Substituting $R = 8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$:
\[
C_v^{\text{trans + rot}} = \frac{5}{2} \times 8.314 = 20.785 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
\]

The vibrational contribution is then obtained by subtracting the translational and rotational contributions from the total heat capacity:
\[
C_v^{\text{vib}} = C_v^{\text{total}} - C_v^{\text{trans + rot}}
\]

Substituting $C_v^{\text{total}} = 28.6 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ and $C_v^{\text{trans + rot}} = 20.785 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$:
\[
C_v^{\text{vib}} = 28.6 - 20.785 = 7.815 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
\]

This value is very close to $7.82 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$, which corresponds to option H. Therefore, the vibrational contribution to the heat capacity is:

**H: 7.82 $\mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$**
