Okay, so I have this statistics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about statistical significance, power, and the different types of errors.

The question says that a researcher set the criterion for statistical significance to 0.05 and the statistical power to 0.85. Then, I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that the criterion for statistical significance is the alpha level, which is the probability of making a Type I error. A Type I error happens when we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. So if alpha is 0.05, that means there's a 5% chance of making a Type I error.

Next, statistical power is the probability that the study will detect an effect if there is one. Power is denoted as 1 - beta, where beta is the probability of making a Type II error. A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis even though the alternative hypothesis is true. So if the power is 0.85, that means beta is 0.15 because 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The statistical power is less than the criterion. Power is 0.85, which is higher than 0.05, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Probability of Type II error is 0.85. No, because power is 0.85, which means Type II error is 0.15. So B is wrong.

Option C: Probability of Type II error is 0.05. That's not right; we just said it's 0.15. So C is wrong.

Option D: Can't compute probabilities from the info. Well, we were given alpha as 0.05 and power as 0.85, so we can find Type II error as 0.15, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Type I and II errors are equal. Type I is 0.05, Type II is 0.15. Not equal, so E is wrong.

Option F: Probability of Type I error is 0.85. No, Type I is alpha, which is 0.05. So F is wrong.

Option G: Type I error is lower than Type II. Type I is 0.05, Type II is 0.15. So yes, 0.05 is lower than 0.15. So G is correct.

Option H: Probability of Type II error is higher than Type I. That's the same as G, so H is also correct. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, G says Type I is lower than Type II. H says Type II is higher than Type I, which is the same statement. So both G and H are correct? That can't be right because only one option is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Option G: Probability of making a Type I error is lower than Type II. So 0.05 < 0.15, which is correct.

Option H: Probability of making a Type II error is higher than Type I. Which is also correct because 0.15 > 0.05. So both G and H are correct statements. But that can't be, because the options are exclusive.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

Option H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.

So, G and H are expressing the same thing. So both would be correct. But that's impossible because each question has only one correct answer.

Wait, did I miss something? Let me think again about the actual terms.

Type I error is alpha, which is set by the researcher (0.05). Type II error is beta, which is 0.15 because power is 0.85.

So Type II error probability is 0.15, which is higher than Type I's 0.05. So both G and H statements are correct. But looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me double-check the question.

No, the question states that the criterion is 0.05 (alpha) and power is 0.85, which means beta is 0.15. So Type II error is 0.15, which is higher than Type I error of 0.05. So both G and H would be correct, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options.

Looking back:

Option G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

So, 0.05 < 0.15 → correct.

Option H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.

Which is also correct because 0.15 > 0.05. So both G and H are correct, but that's impossible because it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the options are structured differently. Let me check the other options to see if any of them match.

Wait, the correct answer should be either G or H, but perhaps only one is listed correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing which is which. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the options again:

Option G: Type I error is lower than Type II. True.

Option H: Type II error is higher than Type I. Also true.

Hmm, so both G and H are correct statements. But this can't be the case in a standard multiple-choice setup. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which option is correct, and which among the options correctly matches the scenario.

Looking at the options again:

The correct answer must be either G or H, but perhaps the options are designed so that only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is a bit different. Let me think about what each option is saying.

Wait, another thought: The question is about what's the probability of Type II error. Since power is 0.85, that means Type II error is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Looking at the options, which one correctly states that Type II error is 0.15.

But none of the options directly state that. Let's see:

Option B says Type II error is 0.85. No, that's wrong.

Option C: Type II error is 0.05. No.

Wait, perhaps I was too quick to dismiss the other options.

Option D says that the probabilities can't be computed. But from the given info, alpha is 0.05, power is 0.85, so beta is 0.15. So D is incorrect.

Wait, then the correct answer must relate to the relationship between Type I and Type II errors.

So, Type I is 0.05, Type II is 0.15. So Type II is higher than Type I, which is what option H says.

Wait, but option G says Type I is lower than Type II, which is also correct.

Wait, but in the options, both G and H would be correct. But that's impossible as each option is unique.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about what each option says.

Option G: Type I error is lower than Type II. So 0.05 < 0.15 → correct.

Option H: Type II error is higher than Type I → correct.

So both are correct, but perhaps the options don't have both correct, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Because power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. So power = 1 - beta. So if power is 0.85, then beta is 0.15.

So Type II error rate is 0.15, and Type I error rate is 0.05.

So, the probability of Type II is higher than Type I. So option H is correct.

Wait, but option G says Type I is lower than Type II, which is also correct. So both G and H are correct statements, but in the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which option is correct, and both G and H are correct, but perhaps the options are designed so that only one is applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H because it's about the probability being higher, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the options, let me check which ones are correct based on the given data.

Looking at each option:

A: Power (0.85) < significance (0.05)? No, 0.85 > 0.05. So A is incorrect.

B: Type II error is 0.85? No, it's 0.15. So B is wrong.

C: Type II error is 0.05? No, 0.15. So C is wrong.

D: Can't compute? No, we can compute Type II as 0.15. So D is incorrect.

E: Type I and II equal? 0.05 vs 0.15. No. So E wrong.

F: Type I error is 0.85? No, 0.05. So F wrong.

G: Type I < Type II. 0.05 < 0.15 → correct.

H: Type II > Type I → correct.

So both G and H are correct statements. But how can that be? The options are A to J, each exclusive.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question is asking which option is correct. So in the options, if both G and H are correct, but perhaps the options don't have both, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check again.

Looking back, the options are:

G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.

So both are correct, but the options can't have two correct answers. Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is either G or H, but in reality, only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are designed so that only one is correct, but in reality, both statements are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the relationship, so either G or H is correct, but in the options, only one is present.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, as it directly states that Type II is higher than Type I, which is correct.

But then, G also correctly states that Type I is lower than Type II.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both G and H, but in the options, each is a separate choice. So, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the definitions.

Wait, another approach: let's list all the options and see which are correct.

From the given data:

- Alpha (Type I error) = 0.05

- Power = 0.85 → Beta (Type II error) = 0.15

So, the probability of Type II error is 0.15, which is higher than Type I's 0.05.

So, among the options, the correct statements are:

H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.

G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

So both G and H are correct. But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps only one is intended as correct.

Wait, perhaps in the options, only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

G and H are two separate options. So the correct answer must include both, but since that's impossible, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because it's a more direct comparison of the two error probabilities.

Wait, but the question is about which option is correct. So perhaps both G and H are correct, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question. Let me re-examine the options.

Option D says the probabilities can't be computed. But we can compute them, so D is wrong.

So the correct options are G and H, but in the given options, only one can be correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H because it's comparing Type II being higher than Type I, which is a direct consequence of the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently.

The question is, which option is correct based on the given data.

We know that the Type I error rate is 0.05, and Type II is 0.15.

So any option that correctly states that Type II > Type I is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option H states that the probability of Type II error is higher than Type I. So H is correct.

Option G states that Type I is lower than Type II, which is also correct.

So both G and H are correct. But that's impossible because each option is a separate choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H because it's talking about the probability of Type II error being higher, which is more directly relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Maybe there's a mistake in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H.

But I'm getting confused because both G and H seem correct. However, looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct, so I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, no, I think I'm correct: both G and H are correct, but in the options, only one is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have an error. But I have to choose from the given options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the other options again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is a bit different. Let me think about what each option is saying.

Wait, option B says the probability of Type II error is 0.85, which is incorrect because it's 0.15.

Option C: Type II error is 0.05, which is wrong.

Option D: Can't compute, which is wrong because we can compute.

Option E: Type I and II are equal. No.

Option F: Type I error is 0.85. No.

So, the only correct options are G and H.

But since only one can be correct, perhaps the intended answer is H.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H because it's more directly about the comparison between the two error probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G. Hmm.

Wait, considering that in the given options, both G and H are correct, but the options are A-J, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is H.

The question involves a study where the criterion for statistical significance (alpha) is set to 0.05, and the statistical power is 0.85. Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true, and it is calculated as \( \text{Power} = 1 - \beta \), where \( \beta \) is the probability of making a Type II error. Given that the power is 0.85, the probability of a Type II error (\( \beta \)) is \( 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 \).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: "The statistical power of the study is less than the criterion for statistical significance."  
   - Power is 0.85, and the criterion for statistical significance (alpha) is 0.05. Since \( 0.85 > 0.05 \), this is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: "The probability of making a Type II error is 0.85."  
   - The probability of a Type II error is \( \beta = 0.15 \), not 0.85. This is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: "The probability of making a Type II error is 0.05."  
   - The probability of a Type II error is \( \beta = 0.15 \), not 0.05. This is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: "The probability of type I and type II errors cannot be computed from the information given."  
   - The probability of a Type I error (\( \alpha = 0.05 \)) and Type II error (\( \beta = 0.15 \)) can both be determined from the given information. This is incorrect.

5. **Option E**: "The probability of making a type I error and type II error is equal."  
   - The probability of a Type I error (\( \alpha = 0.05 \)) is not equal to the probability of a Type II error (\( \beta = 0.15 \)). This is incorrect.

6. **Option F**: "The probability of making a type I error is 0.85."  
   - The probability of a Type I error is \( \alpha = 0.05 \), not 0.85. This is incorrect.

7. **Option G**: "The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error."  
   - The probability of a Type I error (\( \alpha = 0.05 \)) is indeed lower than the probability of a Type II error (\( \beta = 0.15 \)). This is correct.

8. **Option H**: "The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error."  
   - The probability of a Type II error (\( \beta = 0.15 \)) is indeed higher than the probability of a Type I error (\( \alpha = 0.05 \)). This is also correct.

9. **Option I**: "The probability of making a type I error is 0.15."  
   - The probability of a Type I error is \( \alpha = 0.05 \), not 0.15. This is incorrect.

10. **Option J**: "The statistical power of the study is equal to the criterion for statistical significance."  
    - Power is 0.85, and the criterion for statistical significance is 0.05. They are not equal. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Both **Option G** and **Option H** are correct because they accurately describe the relationship between the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors. However, since only one answer can be selected in a multiple-choice format, **Option H** is the most direct and appropriate choice.
