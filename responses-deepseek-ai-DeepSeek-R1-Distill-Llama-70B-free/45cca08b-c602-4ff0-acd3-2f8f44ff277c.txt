Question:

The STANDARD SCORES express raw score distance from mean by SD and considered the most satisfactory type of NR score. Which statement out of the following ones is about T-scores?

Options:

A: M=0, SD=1, often used in research studies
B: M=100, SD=15 or 16
C: They express raw scores in terms of percentiles
D: M=500, SD=100, often used in college entrance exams
E: Shows how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean: a score of +1.0 means itâ€™s 1 SD above the mean
F: M=100, SD=10, commonly used in IQ tests
G: M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments
H: M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI
I: They express raw scores in terms of ranks
J: standard nine: M=5, SD=approx 2

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement correctly describes T-scores. I remember that standard scores are a way to express how a raw score compares to the mean, measured in standard deviations. T-scores are a type of standard score, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Let me go through the options one by one. 

Option A says Mean=0, SD=1, often used in research. Wait, that sounds familiar. I think when the mean is 0 and SD is 1, those are called z-scores. Z-scores are definitely a type of standard score, so this might not be T-scores.

Option B: Mean=100, SD=15 or 16. Hmm, I think this is related to IQ tests. Like, the standard IQ score has a mean of 100 and SD of 15, but sometimes 16. But wait, are those T-scores or just standard scores? I'm not sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option C says they express raw scores as percentiles. No, that's not standard scores. Percentiles are a different kind of norm-referenced score. So C is about percentiles, not T-scores.

Option D: Mean=500, SD=100, used in college entrance exams. That rings a bell, like the SAT maybe? But SAT scores are scaled, but I'm not sure if that's T-scores. I think SAT uses a different scaling, perhaps not T-scores.

Option E: Shows how many SDs a score is above or below the mean. A score of +1.0 is 1 SD above. That sounds exactly like z-scores again, not T-scores. So E is probably about z-scores.

Option F: Mean=100, SD=10, commonly used in IQ tests. Wait, earlier I thought IQ tests have SD=15. Maybe this is a different test? Or perhaps a different kind of score. I'm not sure.

Option G: Mean=100, SD=24, used in personality tests. I don't recall personality tests using T-scores. They might use different scaling, maybe.

Option H: Mean=50, SD=10, used on MMPI. MMPI stands for Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, right? I think their scales are often T-scores. So T-scores have a mean of 50 and SD of 10. So if H says M=50, SD=10, and used in MMPI, that might be correct.

Option I: They express raw scores in terms of ranks. No, that's percentile ranks, not standard scores.

Option J: Standard nine, mean 5, SD approx 2. Not sure what that's about, maybe another kind of score.

Wait, so the question is about T-scores. From what I remember, T-scores typically have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. They are often used in personality assessments. So looking at the options, H says exactly that: M=50, SD=10, used on many psychological tests, including MMPI. So H should be the correct answer.

Let me double-check the other options. B was about 100 and 15-16, which might be IQ but not T-scores. A and E are z-scores. So yeah, H is the right choice.

The correct answer is:

H: M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI

This option accurately describes T-scores, which have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, commonly used in psychological assessments like the MMPI.

Answer: H
