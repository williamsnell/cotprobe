Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says.

The question is about the height of a water column and converting that to the equivalent height of a mercury column. Hmm, I remember something about different liquids having different densities and how that affects the height when pressure is the same. Oh right, it's all about pressure and density.

Wait, the problem says the height of the water column is 600 mm. I think the key here is that the pressure exerted by a column of fluid depends on its height and density. Mercury is much denser than water, so a shorter column of mercury would exert the same pressure as a taller column of water.

I remember the formula for pressure due to a fluid column is P = ρ * g * h, where ρ is density, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. Since the pressure has to be the same for both columns (they're in equilibrium, I suppose), I can set the two pressures equal.

So, P_water = P_mercury. That means ρ_water * g * h_water = ρ_mercury * g * h_mercury.

Oh wait, the g cancels out because it's the same for both, so we're left with ρ_water * h_water = ρ_mercury * h_mercury.

I need to find h_mercury, so rearranging the equation gives h_mercury = (ρ_water / ρ_mercury) * h_water.

Now, what are the densities of water and mercury? I think the density of water is 1000 kg/m³, and mercury is much denser. Oh right, mercury's density is about 13,600 kg/m³. Wait, let me double-check that. Yeah, water is 1000 kg/m³, mercury is 13.6 times denser, so 1000 * 13.6 = 13,600 kg/m³.

So plugging in the numbers: h_mercury = (1000 / 13600) * 600 mm. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1000 divided by 13600. Let's see, 1000/13600 is the same as 10/136, which simplifies to 5/68. Let me calculate that: 5 divided by 68. 5 ÷ 68 is approximately 0.0735.

So then, multiply that by 600 mm. 0.0735 * 600 = let's see, 0.0735 * 600. 0.07 * 600 is 42, and 0.0035*600 is 2.1. So adding those together, 42 + 2.1 = 44.1 mm.

Wait, so the height of the mercury column would be 44.1 mm. Let me look at the options. Option D is 44.1 mm Hg. So that must be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the densities. Did I have water over mercury or the other way around? Because if I had flipped them, I'd get a much larger number. So water is less dense, so the mercury height should be less than water. Since 44 is less than 600, that makes sense.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: mercury is about 13.6 times denser than water, so the height should be about 1/13.6 of the water height. So 600 divided by 13.6. Let me compute 600 / 13.6.

13.6 times 44 is 600. Because 13 *44=572, 0.6 *44=26.4, so 572+26.4=598.4, which is close to 600. So 44.1 is correct.

Yep, so the answer should be D.

To determine the height of the mercury column when the height of a water column is 600 mm, we use the relationship between pressure, density, and height for both fluids. The pressure exerted by a fluid column is given by:

\[
P = \rho \cdot g \cdot h
\]

Since the pressure is the same for both columns, we equate the pressures:

\[
\rho_{\text{water}} \cdot g \cdot h_{\text{water}} = \rho_{\text{mercury}} \cdot g \cdot h_{\text{mercury}}
\]

The acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) cancels out, leaving:

\[
\rho_{\text{water}} \cdot h_{\text{water}} = \rho_{\text{mercury}} \cdot h_{\text{mercury}}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(h_{\text{mercury}}\):

\[
h_{\text{mercury}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{mercury}}} \cdot h_{\text{water}}
\]

The density of water is \(\rho_{\text{water}} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\), and the density of mercury is \(\rho_{\text{mercury}} = 13,600 \, \text{kg/m}^3\). Substituting these values along with \(h_{\text{water}} = 600 \, \text{mm}\):

\[
h_{\text{mercury}} = \frac{1000}{13,600} \cdot 600
\]

First, compute the ratio:

\[
\frac{1000}{13,600} = 0.0735
\]

Then multiply by 600:

\[
h_{\text{mercury}} = 0.0735 \cdot 600 = 44.1 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the height of the mercury column is 44.1 mm. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: 44.1 mm Hg**
