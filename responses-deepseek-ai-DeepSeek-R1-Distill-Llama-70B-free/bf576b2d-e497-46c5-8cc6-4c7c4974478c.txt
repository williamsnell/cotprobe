Okay, so I have this question here: "How many three-digit positive integers are there?" And there are a bunch of options from A to J. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Wait, three-digit numbers. So, numbers from 100 up to 999, right? Because a three-digit number can't start with zero. So the smallest is 100, and the largest is 999.

Let me think about how to calculate the total count. Oh right, when counting numbers in a range like this, you can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and then add one because both ends are inclusive.

So the smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest is 999. So the count should be 999 minus 100 plus 1. Let me do that math: 999 - 100 is 899, and adding 1 gives 900. So there are 900 three-digit numbers.

Looking at the options, option A is 900, so that should be the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes when you're counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to make a mistake. Let's see: from 1 to 3, there are 3 numbers, which is 3-1+1=3. Similarly, 10 to 12 is 3 numbers (10,11,12), which is 12-10+1=3. So yes, the formula works.

Applying that here, 999 - 100 = 899, plus 1 is 900. So yes, the answer should be A:900.

The three-digit positive integers range from 100 to 999. To find the total count, subtract the smallest number from the largest and add 1 (to include both endpoints). 

999 - 100 = 899  
899 + 1 = 900  

Thus, there are 900 three-digit positive integers. The correct answer is:

A: 900

Answer: A
