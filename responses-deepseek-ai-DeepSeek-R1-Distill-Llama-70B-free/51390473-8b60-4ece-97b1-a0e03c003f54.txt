Okay, so I've got this problem about vector spaces and linear independence. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the rank of a vector group for two different values of lambda. The vectors given are u1 - lambda u2, u2 - lambda u3, and u3 - lambda u1. The values of lambda are sqrt(5) and 1. 

Wait, I remember that the rank is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in the group. So I need to check if these three vectors are linearly independent for each lambda. If they are, the rank is 3. If not, it's less.

But wait, the original vectors u1, u2, u3 are linearly independent. So that forms a basis perhaps? Or at least, they're part of a basis.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can write these new vectors as linear combinations of the original ones and see if the coefficients form a matrix that's invertible. If the determinant is non-zero, then the rank is 3. If it's zero, the rank is less than 3.

So let's set up the problem. For each lambda, we're looking at the vectors:

v1 = u1 - λ u2  
v2 = u2 - λ u3  
v3 = u3 - λ u1

I can write these in terms of a matrix equation. The coefficients matrix would look like this:

[ 1  -λ   0 ]
[ 0   1  -λ ]
[-λ   0   1 ]

Wait, no, let me check. Each row represents the coefficients of u1, u2, u3 for each vector v.

Wait, v1 is 1*u1 + (-λ)*u2 + 0*u3. So the first row is [1, -λ, 0]. Similarly, v2 is 0*u1 +1*u2 + (-λ)*u3, so second row [0, 1, -λ]. v3 is (-λ)*u1 +0*u2 +1*u3, so third row [-λ, 0, 1].

So the matrix is:

|1   -λ    0|
|0    1   -λ|
|-λ   0    1|

Now, to find if the vectors are linearly independent, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. If the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are independent, so rank 3. If zero, then the rank is less than 3.

So the determinant D is calculated as follows. Let me expand it.

D = 1 * (1*1 - (-λ)*0) - (-λ) * (0*1 - (-λ)*(-λ)) + 0 * (0*0 -1*(-λ)).

Wait, maybe I should use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let's do cofactor expansion along the first row.

So,

D = 1 * det(minor of 1) - (-λ) * det(minor of -λ) + 0 * det(minor of 0).

The minor for 1 is the 2x2 matrix:
|1  -λ|
|0   1|
Determinant is (1)(1) - (-λ)(0) = 1.

The minor for -λ is the 2x2 matrix:
|0  -λ|
|-λ  1|
Determinant is (0)(1) - (-λ)(-λ) = 0 - λ² = -λ².

So putting it together:

D = 1*(1) - (-λ)*(-λ²) + 0*(something)  
= 1 - (λ * λ²)  
Wait, no: (-λ) multiplied by the determinant, which was -λ². So:

Wait, the cofactor for the -λ is (-1)^(1+2) times the minor determinant. So it's (-1)^3 * (-λ²) = (-1)*(-λ²) = λ².

Wait, no, wait. The expansion is: 

D = 1 * det(M11) - (-λ) * det(M12) + 0 * det(M13)

Where M11 is the minor for (1,1), which is:

|1  -λ|
|0   1|

det(M11) = 1*1 - (-λ)*0 = 1.

M12 is the minor for (1,2), which is:

|0  -λ|
|-λ  1|

det(M12) = (0)(1) - (-λ)(-λ) = 0 - λ² = -λ².

So the second term is (-λ) multiplied by det(M12), but with a negative sign because of the cofactor. So:

Second term: - ( -λ ) * (-λ² ) = - [ λ * (-λ²) ]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the cofactor expansion formula is:

D = sum_{j=1 to n} (-1)^(i+j) * a_ij * det(M_ij)

In this case, i=1 (first row), so:

j=1: (-1)^(1+1)=1 * a11 * det(M11) = 1*1*1=1.

j=2: (-1)^(1+2)=(-1)^3=-1 * a12 * det(M12) = (-1)*(-λ)*(-λ²).

Wait, a12 is -λ, right? Because the matrix element is -λ.

So j=2 term is (-1) * (-λ) * (-λ²) = (-1)* (λ * λ²) )= -λ^3.

Wait no:

Wait, a12 is -λ. So:

j=2 term is (-1)^(3) * (-λ) * det(M12) = (-1)*(-λ) * (-λ²) 

Wait det(M12) is -λ².

So putting it together: (-1) * (-λ) * (-λ²) = (-1) * λ * (-λ²) = (-1) * (-λ^3) )= λ^3?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant using another method. Maybe using row operations.

Alternatively, perhaps compute it directly.

Let me compute the determinant step by step.

The matrix is:

Row1: 1, -λ, 0  
Row2: 0, 1, -λ  
Row3: -λ, 0, 1  

Let me write it as:

|1   -λ    0|
|0    1   -λ|
|-λ   0    1|

Compute determinant:

Using the rule for 3x3 matrices:

= 1*(1*1 - (-λ)*0) - (-λ)*(0*1 - (-λ)*(-λ)) + 0*(0*0 - 1*(-λ))

Simplify each term:

First term: 1*(1 - 0) = 1*1=1.

Second term: - (-λ) * (0 - λ^2) = λ * (-λ^2) = -λ^3.

Wait, let me see. The second term is minus (-λ) multiplied by (0*1 - (-λ)*(-λ)).

Wait, 0*1 is 0. (-λ)*(-λ) is λ². So 0 - λ² = -λ².

So the second term in the determinant is - (-λ) * (-λ²) = λ * (-λ²) = -λ^3.

Wait, no: the cofactor expansion formula is:

det(A) = a11*A11 + a12*A12 + a13*A13,

where A1j are the cofactors.

So for a12, it's (-1)^(1+2) * det(M12) = (-1)^3 * det(M12) = -det(M12).

So the second term is a12 * (-det(M12)).

Wait, a12 is -λ. So:

Second term: (-λ) * (-det(M12)) = (-λ) * [ - (0*1 - (-λ)*(-λ)) ] = (-λ) * [ - (0 - λ^2) ] = (-λ) * [ - (-λ^2) ) ].

Wait, 0*1 is 0. (-λ)*(-λ) is λ². So 0 - λ² = -λ².

So det(M12) is -λ². So the cofactor is (-1)^3 * (-λ^2) = - (-λ^2) )= λ^2.

So the second term is a12 * cofactor = (-λ) * (λ²) = -λ^3.

Third term: a13 is 0, so it vanishes.

So overall, determinant D = 1 - λ^3.

Wait, that's a relief. So D = 1 - λ^3.

So when is D zero? When 1 - λ^3 =0 → λ^3=1 → λ=1 (since we're dealing with real numbers, the real root is λ=1).

Wait, but we're evaluating at lambda = sqrt(5) and lambda=1.

So for lambda=sqrt(5): D = 1 - (sqrt(5))^3.

Compute that: (sqrt(5))^3 is (5^(1/2))^3 =5^(3/2)=5*sqrt(5)= approx 11.18. So 1 - 5*sqrt(5) is negative, but definitely not zero. So the determinant is non-zero, which means the vectors are linearly independent. So rank is 3.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. If the determinant is non-zero, then the vectors are linearly independent, so the rank is 3. But wait, the original vectors u1, u2, u3 are given as linearly independent. So if the determinant is non-zero, the new vectors are also independent.

But wait, for lambda =1, D=1 -1^3=0. So the determinant is zero, so the vectors are linearly dependent. So the rank is less than 3. Now, what is the rank when the determinant is zero?

We need to determine the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in that case.

So for lambda=1, the vectors are:

v1= u1 - u2  
v2= u2 - u3  
v3= u3 - u1

Wait, let's see if these are dependent. Let's see if a linear combination equals zero.

Let me think: Suppose we have a1*v1 + a2*v2 +a3*v3 =0.

Substitute:

a1(u1 -u2) + a2(u2 - u3) + a3(u3 - u1) =0.

Grouping terms:

(a1 -a3)u1 + ( -a1 +a2 ) u2 + (-a2 +a3) u3 =0.

Since u1, u2, u3 are independent, each coefficient must be zero:

a1 - a3 =0  
- a1 + a2 =0  
- a2 + a3 =0.

From first equation: a1 = a3.

Second equation: a2 = a1.

Third equation: a3 = a2.

So all a's are equal: a1 =a2 =a3.

So, for example, if a1=1, then a2=1, a3=1.

So, 1*v1 +1*v2 +1*v3 =0. 

Let me check:

v1 +v2 +v3 = (u1 -u2) + (u2 -u3) + (u3 -u1) = u1 -u2 +u2 -u3 +u3 -u1 =0.

So yes, the sum of the vectors is zero. So they are linearly dependent. So the rank is less than 3.

But what exactly is the rank? It could be 2 or 1.

To determine the rank, we need to check if any two of the vectors are independent.

Let's pick v1 and v2 and see if they are independent.

So, are there scalars a and b, not all zero, such that a*v1 +b*v2=0?

Which is a(u1 -u2) +b(u2 -u3)=0.

Expanding: a u1 + (-a +b) u2 + (-b) u3 =0.

Since u's are independent, coefficients must be zero:

a=0  
- a +b =0 → b=0  
- b=0 →b=0.

So a=0, b=0. So v1 and v2 are independent.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because earlier, the three vectors are dependent. But if any two are independent, then the rank is 2.

Wait, let me confirm. Suppose I have three vectors, all dependent, but any two are independent. Then the rank is 2.

Wait, for example, in 3D space, three vectors on the same plane, any two are independent but all three together are dependent. So yes, that's possible.

So for lambda=1, the vectors are dependent, but any two are independent, so the rank is 2.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Let me take specific vectors.

v1= u1 -u2  
v2= u2 -u3  
v3= u3 -u1.

Suppose I take v1 and v2:

Is there a way to express one in terms of the other? Let me see.

v1 = u1 -u2  
v2 = u2 -u3.

If I take v1 + v2 = u1 -u3.

Which is a vector that's not in the span of v1 and v2 necessarily, unless it's a combination.

Wait, but since u3 is independent, I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's consider if v1 and v2 can be expressed as a combination of each other.

Wait, no, because if I have a*v1 +b*v2=0, we saw that a=0 and b=0. So they are independent.

Hence, for lambda=1, the rank is 2.

So putting it all together:

For lambda=sqrt(5): determinant is 1 - (sqrt(5))^3. Let's compute that. (sqrt(5))^3 is (5^(1/2))^3 =5^(3/2)=5*sqrt(5). So 1 -5*sqrt(5) is not zero. Therefore, rank is 3.

For lambda=1: determinant is zero, so rank is 2.

Wait, but wait, the options given are:

Options:

A: [1, 2]

B: [2, 1]

C: [3, 2]

D: [1, 1]

E: [2, 3]

F: [3, 1]

G: [3, 3]

H: [1, 3]

I: [2, 2]

J: [0, 2]

Wait, the problem says to return the answer as a list: first for lambda=sqrt(5), then lambda=1.

So for lambda=sqrt(5), rank is 3. For lambda=1, rank is 2.

Looking at the options, option C is [3,2], which fits.

Wait, but earlier I thought for lambda=1, the rank is 2. So the list would be [3,2], which is option C.

But wait, let me double-check. When lambda=1, the determinant is zero, so the vectors are dependent, but any two are independent, so rank is 2.

Yes, so the ranks are 3 and 2, which is option C.

To determine the rank of the vector group \( \{u_1 - \lambda u_2, u_2 - \lambda u_3, u_3 - \lambda u_1\} \) for \(\lambda = \sqrt{5}\) and \(\lambda = 1\), we analyze the linear independence of these vectors. The rank is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in the group.

### Step 1: Matrix Representation
The vectors can be expressed as linear combinations of \(u_1, u_2, u_3\), and the coefficients form the following matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\lambda & 0 \\
0 & 1 & -\lambda \\
-\lambda & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The rank of the vector group is determined by the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) of this matrix. If the determinant of \(A\) is non-zero, all three vectors are linearly independent, and the rank is 3. If the determinant is zero, the vectors are linearly dependent, and the rank is less than 3.

### Step 2: Compute the Determinant
The determinant of \(A\) is calculated as:

\[
\det(A) = 1 \cdot (1 \cdot 1 - (-\lambda) \cdot 0) - (-\lambda) \cdot (0 \cdot 1 - (-\lambda) \cdot (-\lambda)) + 0 \cdot (0 \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot (-\lambda)).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\det(A) = 1 - \lambda^3.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate for \(\lambda = \sqrt{5}\)
For \(\lambda = \sqrt{5}\):

\[
\det(A) = 1 - (\sqrt{5})^3 = 1 - 5\sqrt{5}.
\]

Since \(5\sqrt{5} > 1\), \(\det(A) \neq 0\). Therefore, the vectors are linearly independent, and the rank is 3.

### Step 4: Evaluate for \(\lambda = 1\)
For \(\lambda = 1\):

\[
\det(A) = 1 - 1^3 = 0.
\]

The determinant is zero, so the vectors are linearly dependent. To determine the rank, we check if any two vectors are independent. For example, \(v_1 = u_1 - u_2\) and \(v_2 = u_2 - u_3\) are independent because no non-trivial linear combination of them equals zero. Thus, the rank is 2.

### Final Answer
For \(\lambda = \sqrt{5}\), the rank is 3. For \(\lambda = 1\), the rank is 2. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{[3, 2]}
\]

This corresponds to option **C**.
