Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about cultural differences in how people experience shame and guilt when admitting family problems to a counselor. The options are various ethnic groups, and I need to pick the one where traditional members commonly feel intense shame or guilt in such situations.

Hmm, I remember that different cultures have different values and norms around seeking help and discussing personal or family issues. I think that in some cultures, there's a strong emphasis on family honor and keeping problems private. If someone from such a culture admits to a family problem, especially to an outsider like a counselor, they might feel a lot of shame or guilt because it reflects poorly on the family.

So, which group is known for this? I'm trying to recall. I know that in many Asian cultures, the concept of "saving face" is really important. Saving face refers to maintaining dignity and avoiding embarrassment. So if a family problem is admitted, it could bring shame not just to the individual but to the whole family. This might make it really hard for someone from an Asian background to talk about these issues, especially with someone outside the family.

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's just Asian-Americans or if other groups might have similar tendencies. For example, Hispanic cultures also have strong family ties and might value privacy. But I think the intensity of shame and guilt might be more pronounced in Asian cultures due to the collectivist nature of their societies. In collectivist cultures, the group's needs and reputation are prioritized over individual concerns, so admitting a family problem could be seen as bringing dishonor.

Let me think about the other options. Eastern European-Americans might have their own cultural norms, but I'm not as familiar with them feeling intense shame in this context. African-Americans, Native North Americans, European-Americans, Caribbean-Americansâ€”each has their own cultural practices, but I'm not sure they're as strongly associated with the specific feelings of shame when discussing family issues publicly.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is B: Asian-Americans. They're more likely to experience intense feelings of shame and guilt because of the cultural emphasis on family honor and avoiding loss of face.

The question asks which traditional group commonly experiences intense shame and guilt when admitting family problems to a counselor. Considering cultural values, Asian-Americans are known for emphasizing family honor and "saving face," making it difficult to discuss family issues publicly due to fear of bringing shame. This aligns with collectivist values prioritizing the family's reputation over individual concerns.

Answer: B
