Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about neutralizing an acid with a base, specifically using KOH to neutralize H3PO4. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form a salt and water. 

First, I think I should write the chemical equation for this reaction. H3PO4 is phosphoric acid, right? And KOH is potassium hydroxide. So the reaction would be between H3PO4 and KOH. Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. Wait, how does that affect the reaction with a strong base like KOH? Oh right, each mole of H3PO4 can react with three moles of KOH because each of the three H+ ions can be neutralized.

So the balanced equation should be H3PO4 + 3 KOH → K3PO4 + 3 H2O. Yeah, that makes sense. Each H+ from H3PO4 reacts with OH- from KOH to form water, and the K+ and PO4^3- form K3PO4.

Next step is to figure out the moles of H3PO4. The problem gives me 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H3PO4. Molarity is moles per liter, so I can calculate moles by multiplying volume (in liters) by molarity.

Volume is 50.0 mL, which is 0.05 liters. So moles of H3PO4 is 0.05 L * 0.150 mol/L = 0.0075 mol. Wait, .05 times 0.15 is 0.0075, right?

But since each H3PO4 reacts with 3 KOH, I need to find how many moles of KOH are needed. So for every mole of H3PO4, 3 moles of KOH are needed. So moles of KOH = 3 * 0.0075 mol = 0.0225 mol.

Now, I need to find the volume of KOH solution that contains 0.0225 moles. The concentration of KOH is 0.250 M, which is 0.250 mol per liter. Using the formula M1V1 = M2V2, but rearranged to find volume: V = moles / M.

So V = 0.0225 mol / 0.250 mol/L. Let me calculate that. 0.0225 divided by 0.25. Hmm, 0.25 is a quarter, so 0.0225 divided by 0.25 is 0.09 liters. Oh wait, 0.09 liters is 90 milliliters. 

Wait, let me double-check that math. 0.25 is a quarter, so 0.0225 divided by 0.25 is like 0.0225 *4, which is 0.09. Yep, that's right. So 90 mL.

Looking at the options, option B is 90.0 mL. So the answer should be B.

I think that's all. I considered the triprotic nature of H3PO4, calculated the required moles of KOH, then used the concentration to find the volume. It all adds up. No mistakes spotted this time.

To determine how many milliliters of 0.250 M KOH are needed to neutralize 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H₃PO₄, we start by considering the reaction:

\[
\text{H₃PO₄} + 3 \text{KOH} \rightarrow \text{K₃PO₄} + 3 \text{H₂O}
\]

This shows that each mole of H₃PO₄ reacts with 3 moles of KOH. 

1. **Calculate moles of H₃PO₄**:  
   The volume of H₃PO₄ is 50.0 mL (0.0500 L), and its molarity is 0.150 M.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₃PO₄} = 0.0500 \, \text{L} \times 0.150 \, \text{M} = 0.0075 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Determine moles of KOH needed**:  
   Since 1 mole of H₃PO₄ requires 3 moles of KOH, the moles of KOH required are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of KOH} = 3 \times 0.0075 \, \text{mol} = 0.0225 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate volume of KOH solution**:  
   The molarity of KOH is 0.250 M, so the volume of KOH solution containing 0.0225 moles is:  
   \[
   \text{Volume of KOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of KOH}}{\text{Molarity of KOH}} = \frac{0.0225 \, \text{mol}}{0.250 \, \text{M}} = 0.0900 \, \text{L} = 90.0 \, \text{mL}
   \]

Thus, the volume of 0.250 M KOH required to neutralize 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H₃PO₄ is **90.0 mL**.

Answer: **B**
