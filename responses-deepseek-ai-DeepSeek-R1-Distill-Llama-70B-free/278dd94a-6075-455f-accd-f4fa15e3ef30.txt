Okay, so I'm trying to solve this infinite series problem. The question is to find the sum of the series from n=1 to infinity of (cos(1/n²) - cos(1/(n+1)²)). Hmm, I remember that when I see a series like this, it might be a telescoping series. Telescoping series are those where a lot of terms cancel out when you write out the partial sums.

Let me think about what a telescoping series looks like. Usually, each term is the difference between two consecutive terms of some sequence. So, when you add them up, most terms cancel except the first and the last. For example, if you have something like (a1 - a2) + (a2 - a3) + (a3 - a4) + ..., then a2 cancels with -a2, a3 cancels with -a3, and so on, leaving only a1 minus the limit of a_n as n approaches infinity.

So in this problem, each term is cos(1/n²) minus cos(1/(n+1)²). That fits the telescoping pattern because the second part of each term is the same as the first part of the next term but negative. Let me write out the partial sums to see.

The nth partial sum S_N would be the sum from n=1 to N of [cos(1/n²) - cos(1/(n+1)²)]. Let's expand this for a few terms to see the pattern.

When N=1: cos(1/1²) - cos(1/2²) = cos(1) - cos(1/4)
When N=2: [cos(1) - cos(1/4)] + [cos(1/4) - cos(1/9)] = cos(1) - cos(1/9)
When N=3: [cos(1) - cos(1/4)] + [cos(1/4) - cos(1/9)] + [cos(1/9) - cos(1/16)] = cos(1) - cos(1/16)
So it looks like each time, the sum S_N is cos(1) minus cos(1/(N+1)²).

So as N approaches infinity, S_N becomes cos(1) minus the limit as N approaches infinity of cos(1/(N+1)²). Let's evaluate that limit.

As N becomes very large, 1/(N+1)² approaches zero. So cos(1/(N+1)²) approaches cos(0), which is 1. Therefore, the sum S is cos(1) - 1.

Now I need to compute cos(1). Wait, cos(1) is in radians, right? Because in calculus, when just given a number without degrees, it's assumed to be radians. So cos(1 radian) is approximately what? Let me think. 1 radian is about 57.3 degrees. Cos(0) is 1, and cos(π/2) is 0, which is about 1.5708 radians. So 1 radian is somewhere in between. I remember that cos(1) is approximately 0.5403, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, cos(0) is 1. Then cos(π/3) is 0.5, which is about 1.047 radians. So between 0 and π/3 (1.047), cos decreases from 1 to 0.5. So at 1 radian, which is a bit less than π/3 (since π is ~3.14, π/3 is ~1.047), so 1 radian is a bit less than that. So cos(1) should be a bit more than 0.5. Let me think, I think cos(1) is approximately 0.5403. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me try to recall more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just calculate it numerically. Let's see, using Taylor series maybe. The Taylor series for cos(x) around 0 is 1 - x²/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + ... So for x=1:

cos(1) = 1 - 1/2 + 1/24 - 1/720 + 1/40320 - ... 

Calculating up to a few terms:

1 = 1
- 1/2 = -0.5 → 0.5
+ 1/24 ≈ 0.0416667 → 0.5416667
- 1/720 ≈ -0.0013889 → ~0.5402778
+ 1/40320 ≈ 0.0000248 → ~0.5403026
And so on. So cos(1) ≈ 0.5403.

So the sum S = cos(1) - 1 ≈ 0.5403 - 1 = -0.4597.

Looking at the options, option J is -0.459. That's very close. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recheck.

So S = sum from n=1 to ∞ [cos(1/n²) - cos(1/(n+1)^2)] = cos(1) - lim_{N→∞} cos(1/(N+1)^2) = cos(1) - cos(0) = cos(1) - 1.

Yes, that's correct. And cos(1) is approximately 0.5403, so 0.5403 - 1 = -0.4597, which rounds to -0.459. So the correct answer is J: -0.459.

The given series is:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \cos\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}\right) \right).
\]

This is a telescoping series, where most terms cancel out when the partial sums are expanded. The \(N\)-th partial sum \(S_N\) is:

\[
S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( \cos\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}\right) \right).
\]

Expanding for a few terms:

- For \(N=1\): \(\cos(1) - \cos\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)\),
- For \(N=2\): \(\cos(1) - \cos\left(\frac{1}{9}\right)\),
- For \(N=3\): \(\cos(1) - \cos\left(\frac{1}{16}\right)\).

As \(N \to \infty\), the partial sum becomes:

\[
S = \cos(1) - \lim_{N \to \infty} \cos\left(\frac{1}{(N+1)^2}\right).
\]

Since \(\frac{1}{(N+1)^2} \to 0\) as \(N \to \infty\), \(\cos\left(\frac{1}{(N+1)^2}\right) \to \cos(0) = 1\). Therefore:

\[
S = \cos(1) - 1.
\]

The value of \(\cos(1)\) (where \(1\) is in radians) is approximately \(0.5403\). Thus:

\[
S = 0.5403 - 1 = -0.4597.
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is \(-0.459\), which corresponds to option J.
