The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A witness sees a murder in the park and is called to testify in the criminal case. Can the defense attorney ask her on cross examination about her habit of feeding the pigeons? The defense knows that she was cited several times for illegally feeding the pigeons. Defense counsel tries to ask, "You have a longtime habit of feeding the pigeons, don't you? You have in fact been ticketed several times for feeding pigeons, haven't you, and yet you persisted in doing it, isn't that so?" Will the trial court likely allow the witness to be questioned on these matters?

Options:

A: Yes, because the statement indicates that the witness' attention was always focused on feeding the pigeons.
B: No, because the witness's actions outside of the crime scene have no bearing on their ability to testify.
C: Yes, because the defense has the right to question a witness about any topic.
D: No, because the defense is attempting to discredit the witness in an unrelated matter.
E: No, because a witness can never be asked about personal prior bad acts.
F: Yes, because the act of feeding pigeons could potentially distract the witness from accurately observing the events.
G: No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.
H: Yes, because feeding pigeons in the park and persisting in it after being ticketed may show an antisocial trait of the witness.
I: Yes, because it demonstrates a pattern of breaking the law, which may affect the witness's credibility.

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about evidence law, specifically about cross-examination. The scenario is a witness who saw a murder and is testifying. The defense attorney wants to ask her about feeding pigeons and getting tickets for it. The question is whether the court will allow that.

Hmm, I remember that when a witness is on the stand, the opposing counsel can ask questions to challenge their credibility. But there are rules about what they can ask. I think it's something about whether the topic is relevant to the witness's credibility or the case at hand.

So the defense is trying to bring up her habit of feeding pigeons and the fact that she was cited multiple times. They're implying she kept doing it even after getting tickets. I guess the idea is to show she doesn't follow rules or maybe that she's not reliable because she disobeys laws.

Wait, but is feeding pigeons relevant here? I mean, the crime is murder, and her testimony is about what she saw. Does her feeding pigeons affect her ability to observe the crime? Or is it just about her character?

I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness's character can be attacked, but only if it's relevant to their credibility. So, for example, if she's been convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, that could be used to impeach her. But feeding pigeons is a minor offense, maybe a misdemeanor or even just a citation, not a felony.

Also, there's something about specific instances of conduct. I think you can ask about specific acts that relate to the witness's character for truthfulness. But feeding pigeons doesn't directly relate to honesty. It might show she disobeys the law, but if it's not a crime of dishonesty, maybe it's not admissible.

Wait, but the question is whether the court will allow it. So if the defense is trying to say she's the kind of person who breaks rules, maybe that's trying to attack her credibility by showing she's lawless. But I'm not sure if that's allowed unless it's directly related to her truthfulness.

Alternatively, maybe the defense is trying to suggest that she was distracted by feeding pigeons and thus didn't see the crime clearly. But the question as phrased isn't about that; it's about her habit and the tickets.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because it shows she was focused on feeding pigeons. That could relate to her attention at the time of the crime. If she's busy feeding pigeons, maybe she didn't see the murder. But the question is about allowing the cross-examination on that topic, not whether it's effective.

Option B says no because the actions are unrelated. That might be the case if the habit doesn't affect her credibility or the events.

Option C says yes because the defense can ask anything. No, that's not right. There are limits on cross-examination.

Option D says no because it's trying to discredit on unrelated matters. That sounds plausible because feeding pigeons isn't directly related to her truthfulness.

Option E says no because witnesses can't be asked about personal prior bad acts. But that's too broad. Some prior bad acts are allowed if relevant.

Option F says yes because feeding pigeons could distract. That's similar to option A. It's a possible reason, but does it make the questioning allowable?

Option G says no because the question lacks probative value on credibility or guilt. That sounds right if the act doesn't relate to credibility.

Option H says yes because it shows antisocial traits. I'm not sure if that's a valid reason. Antisocial behavior might not directly tie to credibility unless it's about dishonesty.

Option I says yes because it shows a pattern of breaking the law. Again, unless it's a crime of dishonesty, that might not be admissible for impeachment.

So, putting it together, the key issue is whether the witness's habit of feeding pigeons and getting tickets is relevant to her credibility. Feeding pigeons is likely a minor infraction, not a crime of dishonesty. So under the rules, specific instances of conduct can be used to attack credibility only if they relate to truthfulness. Since feeding pigeons doesn't speak to her honesty, it's probably not admissible.

Therefore, the court would likely not allow the questioning because it's not probative of her credibility. So the answer would be between options B, D, E, G, etc.

Wait, option E says a witness can never be asked about prior bad acts. But that's incorrect because some can be asked. So E is not correct.

Option G says no because it lacks probative value. That seems correct because the act doesn't relate to credibility.

Option D says no because trying to discredit on unrelated matters. That's also correct, but G is more precise about probative value.

Wait, what's the standard? Evidence is admissible if it's relevant, which means it has probative value on a matter at issue. Here, the matter is the witness's credibility. If feeding pigeons doesn't affect her credibility, then it's irrelevant and inadmissible.

So the trial court would likely exclude it, making the answer G or D.

Looking at the options again:

Option G: No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.

Yes, that fits. The defense's line of questioning doesn't relate to her credibility, so it's not allowed.

Another angle: could it show she's stubborn or doesn't follow rules, implying she's not reliable? But I don't think that's a recognized category for impeachment. Impeachment typically focuses on truthfulness, not general compliance with laws.

So the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around whether a defense attorney can cross-examine a witness about her habit of feeding pigeons and receiving citations for it. The key issue is whether this line of questioning is relevant to the witness's credibility or the case at hand. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness's character can be challenged if it bears on their credibility, but specific instances of conduct must have probative value. Feeding pigeons, while potentially showing disobedience, does not directly relate to the witness's truthfulness or her ability to observe the crime. Since the questioning lacks probative value regarding credibility or the defendant's guilt, the trial court would likely disallow it.
