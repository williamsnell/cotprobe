Alright, so I'm trying to solve this economics problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: John's MPC is constant at 3/4. His break-even point is at $7,000. The question is, how much will John have to borrow when his income is $3,000? The options are A to J.

Okay, let's break this down. First, I remember that MPC stands for Marginal Propensity to Consume. It's the fraction of additional income that a household consumes rather than saves. So if John's MPC is 3/4, that means for every extra dollar he earns, he spends 75 cents and saves 25 cents.

Next, the break-even point. I think that's the point where John's income equals his consumption, meaning he's not saving or borrowing. So when his income is $7,000, he doesn't need to borrow or save; his income exactly covers his consumption.

Now, the question asks how much John will have to borrow when his income drops to $3,000. So we're looking for the amount he needs to borrow because his income is less than the break-even point.

Wait, how does borrowing relate to income and consumption? I think when income is below the break-even point, consumption exceeds income, so he has to borrow the difference. Let me make sure I'm getting this right.

So the formula I remember for consumption is C = A + MPC*(Y - T), where A is autonomous consumption (the amount consumed when income is zero) and Y is disposable income. But in this case, maybe it's simpler because we know the break-even point.

At the break-even income (Y_b), consumption (C) equals Y_b. So Y_b = C. Because at that point, saving is zero. So rearranging, C = Y_b + MPC*(Y - Y_b) ?

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the saving function. Savings (S) is equal to Y - C. At the break-even point, S = 0, so Y = C. So when Y < Y_b, S would be negative, meaning he's borrowing.

So how do we calculate how much he borrows when Y is $3,000?

Let's model this. Let's find the consumption function first. The standard form is C = A + MPC*(Y). But wait, when Y is zero, A would be the intercept. But perhaps since we have the break-even point, we can express it differently.

Wait, I think the break-even occurs where Y = C. So substituting into the consumption function. Suppose the consumption function is C = A + (MPC)*Y.

At break-even, Y_b = C = A + (MPC)*Y_b.

So rearranging, A = Y_b - (MPC)*Y_b = Y_b*(1 - MPC).

Given that MPC is 3/4, so 1 - MPC is 1/4.

So A = Y_b*(1/4) = 7000*(1/4) = $1,750.

So the consumption function is C = 1750 + (3/4)*Y.

Now, when Y is $3,000, let's compute C.

C = 1750 + (3/4)*3000.

(3/4)*3000 is 2250. So 1750 + 2250 = 4000.

So John's consumption is $4,000 when his income is $3,000.

But his income is only $3,000. So the difference between consumption and income is 4,000 - 3,000 = $1,000.

But wait, that would mean he's spending $1,000 more than he earns. So he needs to borrow that amount to cover his consumption. So the borrowing is $1,000.

Looking at the options, option F is $1,000.

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of savings. Savings S = Y - C.

At Y = 3000, C is 4000, so S = 3000 - 4000 = -1000. Negative saving means he's borrowing $1,000.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be F: $1,000.

To determine how much John will have to borrow when his income is $3,000, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC):** John's MPC is 3/4, meaning he spends 75% of any additional income and saves 25%.

2. **Break-even Point:** The break-even point occurs at $7,000, where John's income equals his consumption. This implies that at $7,000, his savings are zero.

Using the break-even point, we can derive John's consumption function. The general form of the consumption function is:

\[
C = A + \text{MPC} \cdot Y
\]

At the break-even point (\(Y_b = 7,000\)), consumption (\(C\)) equals income (\(Y\)), so:

\[
Y_b = A + \text{MPC} \cdot Y_b
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(A\) (autonomous consumption):

\[
A = Y_b - \text{MPC} \cdot Y_b = Y_b \cdot (1 - \text{MPC})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
A = 7,000 \cdot (1 - 3/4) = 7,000 \cdot 1/4 = 1,750
\]

Thus, the consumption function is:

\[
C = 1,750 + (3/4) \cdot Y
\]

Now, calculate consumption when John's income (\(Y\)) is $3,000:

\[
C = 1,750 + (3/4) \cdot 3,000 = 1,750 + 2,250 = 4,000
\]

At this income level, John's consumption ($4,000) exceeds his income ($3,000) by:

\[
\text{Borrowing} = C - Y = 4,000 - 3,000 = 1,000
\]

Therefore, John will need to borrow **$1,000** when his income is $3,000.

The correct answer is:

**F: $1,000**
