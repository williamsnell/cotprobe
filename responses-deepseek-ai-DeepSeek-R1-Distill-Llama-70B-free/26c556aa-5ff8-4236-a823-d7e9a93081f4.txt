Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about a medium with a relative permittivity of 25 and a relative permeability of unity. I need to find the phase velocity of a wave in this medium and the index of refraction. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetic waves, but let me think. I remember that the phase velocity v of a wave in a medium is given by the formula v = 1/(sqrt(με)). Oh wait, but ε is the absolute permittivity and μ is the absolute permeability. Oh right, but in this case, the problem gives the relative permittivity and relative permeability. So I should express them in terms of the vacuum values.

The relative permittivity ε_r is 25, which means ε = ε_r * ε_0. Similarly, the relative permeability μ_r is 1, so μ = μ_r * μ_0. Since μ_r is 1, μ is just μ_0, the permeability of free space.

I recall that the speed of light in vacuum c is 1/sqrt(μ_0 ε_0). So substituting into the phase velocity formula, v = 1/(sqrt(μ ε)) = 1/(sqrt(μ_0 ε_r ε_0)) ). Let's see, that can be rewritten as c / sqrt(ε_r). Because sqrt(μ_0 ε_0) is 1/c, so 1/(sqrt(μ_0 ε_0 ε_r )) equals c / sqrt(ε_r).

So the phase velocity v is c divided by the square root of the relative permittivity. Since ε_r is 25, the square root of 25 is 5. So v = c /5. What's c? Oh, c is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. So 3e8 /5 equals 0.6e8 m/s, which is 6 x 10^7 m/s. Wait, wait, 0.6e8 is 6e7. Wait, 3e8 divided by 5 is 6e7, yes. So 6e7 m/s is 0.6e8 m/s. Oh I see, the options have 0.6e8 as option D or something. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 0.6 × 10^8 m/s, index 5.

Option F: 0.4e8, 4.

So phase velocity is 0.6e8, which is option D's first part. Now, what about the index of refraction?

The index of refraction n is given by sqrt(ε_r * μ_r). Oh wait, no, wait. The formula I remember is n = sqrt(μ_r ε_r). Because n is the square root of the product of the relative permeability and relative permittivity. Since μ_r is 1 and ε_r is 25, n = sqrt(25 * 1) = 5.

So the index of refraction is 5. Then in the options, what do we have? The first part must be 0.6e8 and the second 5. Looking at option D: 0.6e8, 5. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Phase velocity is c divided by n, right? Because n = c/v. So v = c/n. Which would be the same as what I did earlier. Since n is 5, v is 3e8 /5 = 6e7 = 0.6e8. Yes, that's correct.

So the phase velocity is 0.6e8 m/s and the index is 5. So the correct option is D.

To solve the problem, we start by recalling the formula for the phase velocity \( v \) of a wave in a medium:

\[
v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}
\]

Here, \( \mu = \mu_r \mu_0 \) and \( \epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0 \), where \( \mu_r \) and \( \epsilon_r \) are the relative permeability and permittivity, respectively. Substituting these into the formula, we get:

\[
v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_r \mu_0 \cdot \epsilon_r \epsilon_0}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_r \epsilon_r}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}
\]

Since \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} = c \), the speed of light in a vacuum (\( c \approx 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), the phase velocity becomes:

\[
v = \frac{c}{\sqrt{\mu_r \epsilon_r}}
\]

Given \( \mu_r = 1 \) and \( \epsilon_r = 25 \), we find:

\[
v = \frac{c}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{c}{5}
\]

Substituting \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
v = \frac{3.0 \times 10^8}{5} = 0.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the phase velocity is \( 0.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

Next, the index of refraction \( n \) is given by:

\[
n = \sqrt{\mu_r \epsilon_r}
\]

Substituting \( \mu_r = 1 \) and \( \epsilon_r = 25 \):

\[
n = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

Therefore, the index of refraction is 5.

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**D: \( 0.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}, 5 \)**.
