Okay, so I've got this problem about a solid cylindrical shaft transmitting mechanical power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the shaft is 2 inches in diameter and 18 inches long. It's transmitting 45 horsepower at 1500 rpm. The modulus of rigidity is 14e6 psi. I need to find the shear stress and the torsional deflection.

First, I remember that power transmission in shafts involves torque. Oh right, the formula for power is P = (Torque * angular velocity) / 5252, or something like that. Wait, no, the exact formula I think is P (hp) = (T * N) / 5252, where T is torque in inch-pounds and N is rpm. So I can use that to find torque.

Let me plug in the numbers. P is 45 hp, N is 1500 rpm. So 45 = (T * 1500) / 5252. Solving for T: T = (45 * 5252) / 1500. Let me calculate that.

45 * 5252 = 45 * 5000 is 225,000, and 45 * 252 is 11,340, so total is 236,340. Divide by 1500: 236340 / 1500 = 157.56 in-lbs. Wait, wait, units? Because 5252 is in lb-in, right? Hmm, maybe I should double-check the formula.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written as P (hp) = (T (ft-lb) * N (rpm)) / 5252. Oh wait no, the units might be off. Because 1 hp is 550 ft-lbf/s, but the way the formula works, it's typically P = (T * N) / 5252 where T is in inch-pounds. Because 5252 is roughly 550 * 60 / 2π or something. Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the calculation.

So T = (45 * 5252) / 1500. Let me compute that. 5252 / 1500 is roughly 3.5013. Multiply by 45: 3.5013 *45= approx 157.56 in-lbs. So Torque T is about 157.56 inch-pounds.

Wait, wait, but wait another thing. The formula might actually use horsepower and torque in different units. Let me think again. Oh, right! The correct formula is P = (T × N) / 5252, where T is in inch-pounds, N in rpm, and P in horsepower. So yes, that calculation should be correct.

Next, I need to find the shear stress. Shear stress in a shaft under torsion is given by the formula τ = (T * r) / J, where r is the radius, and J is the polar moment of inertia.

The shaft is solid and cylindrical, so J for a solid cylinder is (π/2) * d^4, where d is the diameter. Alternatively, J = π d^4 / 2.

Wait, but I should remember the exact formula. The polar moment of inertia J for a solid shaft is (π * d^4) / 32, wait no, perhaps I'm mixing it with the moment of inertia for bending. Let me clarify.

Ah, no. The polar moment of inertia J for a solid circular shaft is (π d^4)/32. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, since r is the radius, J = (π/2) r^4, or using diameter, since r = d/2. So substituting, J = (π/2) (d/2)^4 = π d^4 / (2*(16)) ) = π d^4 /32. Yes, that's correct. So J = π d^4 /32.

The radius r is d/2, so r = 1 inch (since d is 2 inches).

So putting it all together: τ = (T * r) / J. T is 157.56 in-lbs, r is 1 in, J is π*(2)^4 /32.

Calculating J: (2)^4 is 16. So J = π *16 /32 = π/2. So J = π/2 ≈1.5708 in^4.

So τ = (157.56 * 1) / (1.5708) ≈ 100.3 psi. Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds but higher than that. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait! I think I messed up the units. Because the modulus of rigidity is given in psi, which is pounds per square inch. Oh wait, but the torque is in inch-pounds, which is correct. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, no, the formula for shear stress is correct. So let me recalculate.

Wait, 157.56 in-lbs times 1 inch (r) is 157.56 in-lb. Divided by J, which is 1.5708 in^4. So 157.56 / 1.5708 ≈ 100.3 psi. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option E (800 psi), which is way higher. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Ah, wait a minute, perhaps I forgot to convert the torque from inch-pounds to foot-pounds or something. No, because the formula uses inch-pounds and units in inches. Alternatively, maybe I used the wrong formula for J.

Wait, another approach: J is (π d^4)/32, right? So for d=2 inches, J = π (2^4)/32 = π*16/32 = π/2 ≈1.5708 in^4. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the torque. Let me recalculate the torque.

Power P (hp) = (Torque (in-lbs) × N (rpm)) / 5252.

So Torque T = (P × 5252)/N = (45 × 5252)/1500.

Compute 45 × 5252: 5252 × 40 is 210,080, and 5252 ×5 is 26,260. So total 210,080 +26,260 = 236,340.

Divide by 1500: 236340 /1500 = 157.56 in-lbs. So that's correct.

Wait, so why is the shear stress so low? The options don't have anything near 100 psi. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait! I think I mixed up the radius. Because in the formula, r is the outer radius, which is where the maximum shear stress occurs. So for a shaft of diameter 2 inches, r is 1 inch. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I used the wrong formula for τ. Wait, the formula is τ = T r / J. Let me confirm. Yes, because shear stress in torsion is given by τ = (T * r) / J.

Wait, but J is in in^4, T is in in-lbs, r is in inches. So the units would be (in-lb * in) / in^4 = in-lb / in^3 = psi, which is correct. So units are correct.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the shear stress is about 100 psi. But the options have 800 psi, 950, etc. So something's wrong here.

Wait, wait! Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation for τ. Let me recalculate it.

J is π/2 ≈1.5708 in^4.

So τ = (157.56 lb-in * 1 in) / 1.5708 in^4.

Wait, lb-in is a unit of torque. So numerator is 157.56 lb-in * 1 in. Wait, that's 157.56 (lb * in^2). Because torque is force times distance, which is lb * in. So when you multiply by r (in inches), you get lb * in^2. Dividing by J (in^4), so the unit becomes (lb * in^2) / in^4 = lb / in^2 = psi. Correct.

So 157.56 / 1.5708 = 100.3 psi. So that's correct. But none of the options match this; the lowest is E's 800 psi. So perhaps I made a mistake in the torque calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is wrong. Let me double-check the formula for power. Oh wait, another formula for power is P = (Torque × 2π N) / 60, because power is torque times angular velocity in radians per second.

Wait, that's another approach: P = (T * ω) / 5252, where ω is in rpm? Or is it in radians per second?

Wait, let me think. Horsepower is equal to (torque in ft-lbs) multiplied by (angular speed in rpm), divided by 5252. So yes, the formula I used earlier should be correct. So maybe the torque is correct.

Wait, but 100 psi seems too low for a shaft transmitting 45 hp. Maybe I did something wrong. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe the modulus of rigidity is given, but I haven't used it yet. Oh wait, that's for part (b), the torsional deflection. So part (a) doesn't involve modulus of rigidity, only torque.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 157.56 / 1.5708 again. 157.56 ÷ 1.5708.

So 1.5708 times 100 is 157.08. So 157.56 is just a bit more than 100 times 1.5708, so approximately 100.3. So the shear stress is about 100 psi. But none of the options are near that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for torque. Because sometimes, the formula uses torque in foot-pounds, not inch-pounds. Let me check that.

Ah! That's probably where I messed up. Let me try again.

The formula P = (T × N) / 5252 is when T is in foot-pounds. Because 1 hp is 550 ft-lbf/s, so in one minute (which is 60 seconds), it's 550 * 60 = 33000 ft-lbf per minute. Since rpm is per minute, perhaps the formula expects T in ft-lbf.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me rederive the formula.

Power P (hp) is equal to (Torque × angular velocity) / 5252, where torque is in inch-pounds and angular velocity is in rpm. Wait, but another way: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s. So for one revolution, which is 2π radians, the work done is torque (ft-lbf) × 2π radians. So in one minute, which is 60 seconds, the number of revolutions is N (rpm). So the power in ft-lbf/s is (Torque (ft-lbf) × 2π × N ) / 60.

So P (hp) = [Torque (ft-lbf) × 2π × N ] / (60 × 550).

Wait, because 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s.

So rearranging, Torque = (P × 550 × 60) / (2π × N).

Let me compute this.

P is 45 hp, N is 1500 rpm.

So T = (45 * 550 * 60) / (2 * π * 1500).

Compute numerator: 45 * 550 = 24,750. 24,750 * 60 = 1,485,000.

Denominator: 2 * π * 1500 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 1500 ≈ 9424.8.

So T = 1,485,000 / 9424.8 ≈ 157.6 ft-lbf.

Wait, but this would be torque in ft-lbf, not inch-lbf. So to convert to inch-lbf, multiply by 12. So 157.6 *12 = 1891.2 inch-lbf.

Wait, that's a big difference. Earlier I calculated torque as 157.56 inch-lbf, but if I use the correct approach considering units, it's 1891.2 inch-lbf. That makes more sense because the shear stress would then be higher.

Ah, so I think I see the mistake. The formula I used earlier assumes T is in ft-lbf, but I treated it as inch-lbf, leading to a lower torque. So the correct torque should be 1891.2 inch-lbf.

Let me redo the shear stress calculation with this corrected torque.

So τ = (T * r) / J = (1891.2 in-lbf * 1 in) / (π/2 in^4).

So τ = (1891.2) / (1.5708) ≈ 1891.2 / 1.5708 ≈ 1204 psi.

That makes more sense. So the shear stress is approximately 1204 psi.

Now, looking at the options, option C says shear stress is approximately 1204 psi and torsional deflection approximately 0.089 degrees. That seems to match.

Now, part (b): torsional deflection. The formula for torsional deflection θ (in degrees) is θ = (T * L) / (G * J) ) * (180/π), where L is the length of the shaft.

Wait, the formula is θ = (T L)/(G J). But to get it in degrees, I need to multiply by (180/π) because the formula gives the angle in radians.

So θ (degrees) = (T * L * 180) / (π G J).

Wait, let me check the formula. The torsion formula for angle is θ = (T L) / (G J). And since θ is in radians, to convert to degrees, multiply by (180/π).

So yes, θ = (T L)/(G J) * (180/π).

So the variables are:

T = 1891.2 in-lbf.

L = 18 inches.

G = 14e6 psi.

J = π/2 in^4.

Putting it all together:

θ = (1891.2 * 18) / (14e6 * (π/2)) ) * (180/π).

Let me compute step by step.

First, numerator: T * L = 1891.2 * 18 = let's calculate that.

1891.2 * 10 = 18912, 1891.2 *8=15129.6; so 18912 +15129.6 = 34041.6 in-lbf.

Denominator: G * J = 14e6 psi * (π/2 in^4) = 14e6 * π/2 = 7e6 * π ≈7e6 *3.1416 ≈21,991,200 psi-in^4.

So θ (radians) = 34041.6 / 21,991,200 ≈ 0.001548 radians.

Now, convert to degrees: 0.001548 * (180/π) ≈0.001548 * 57.2958 ≈0.0886 degrees, approximately 0.089 degrees.

So that's about 0.089 degrees, which matches option C.

So the answer should be option C.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the shear stress and torsional deflection of the shaft using the given data:

### Given:
- Diameter of the shaft: \( d = 2 \, \text{in} \)
- Length of the shaft: \( L = 18 \, \text{in} \)
- Power transmitted: \( P = 45 \, \text{hp} \)
- Speed: \( N = 1500 \, \text{rpm} \)
- Modulus of rigidity: \( G = 14 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \)

### Part (a): Shear Stress
The shear stress \( \tau \) in a solid cylindrical shaft under torsion is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{T \cdot r}{J}
\]

Where:
- \( T \) is the torque,
- \( r \) is the outer radius of the shaft,
- \( J \) is the polar moment of inertia.

#### Step 1: Calculate Torque
The relationship between power, torque, and speed is:

\[
P = \frac{T \cdot N}{5252}
\]

Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{P \cdot 5252}{N}
\]

Substituting \( P = 45 \, \text{hp} \) and \( N = 1500 \, \text{rpm} \):

\[
T = \frac{45 \cdot 5252}{1500} = 157.56 \, \text{in-lbs}
\]

However, the correct formula for power transmission assumes torque in foot-pounds. Converting \( T \) to inch-pounds:

\[
T = 157.56 \cdot 12 = 1891.2 \, \text{in-lbs}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate Polar Moment of Inertia
For a solid cylindrical shaft, the polar moment of inertia \( J \) is:

\[
J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32}
\]

Substituting \( d = 2 \, \text{in} \):

\[
J = \frac{\pi (2)^4}{32} = \frac{\pi \cdot 16}{32} = \frac{\pi}{2} \, \text{in}^4
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate Shear Stress
The radius \( r \) is:

\[
r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \, \text{in}
\]

Substituting into the shear stress formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{T \cdot r}{J} = \frac{1891.2 \cdot 1}{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{1891.2 \cdot 2}{\pi} \approx \frac{3782.4}{3.1416} \approx 1204 \, \text{psi}
\]

### Part (b): Torsional Deflection
The torsional deflection \( \theta \) (in degrees) is given by:

\[
\theta = \frac{T \cdot L}{G \cdot J} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}
\]
