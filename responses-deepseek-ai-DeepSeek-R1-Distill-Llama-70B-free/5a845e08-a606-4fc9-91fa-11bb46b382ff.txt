Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. The question is about attitudes and what happens when they're communicated. The options are A through J, each with a different term. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. "When an attitude is communicated, what does it become?" So, an attitude is something someone holds—it's like their stance, opinion, or feeling towards something. When they express this attitude, it transforms into something else. I need to identify what that something is from the given options.

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: A behaviour. Hmm, behaviour is more about actions rather than just communication. So when someone communicates their attitude, they're expressing it, but that doesn't directly mean it's a behaviour. Unless the attitude leads to behaviour, but that's not what the question is asking. It's about what the communicated attitude becomes, not the result of it.

Option B: A stereotype. Stereotypes are oversimplified ideas about groups, not really about individual attitudes being expressed. So probably not B.

Option C: A point of view. A point of view is a way of looking at something, which is similar to an attitude. But when you communicate your attitude, is it just your point of view? I'm not sure. It might be, but let me check the other options.

Option D: An opinion. An opinion is a view or judgment formed about something. That seems close. When you express your attitude, you're giving your opinion on the matter. So this could be a strong contender.

Option E: A principle. Principles are fundamental truths or propositions that serve as the foundation for a system of belief or behaviour. That feels more like a guiding rule rather than a communicated attitude.

Option F: A value. Values are the core beliefs about what is important in life. Attitudes are related but not the same as values. Communicating an attitude doesn't necessarily make it a value; it's more of a specific stance.

Option G: A belief. Beliefs are convictions that something is true. Attitudes can be based on beliefs, but when you communicate an attitude, is it a belief? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Let me think more.

Option H: A theory. Theories are explanations for a set of phenomena. That doesn't seem right here. Communicating an attitude doesn't turn it into a theory.

Option I: A fact. Facts are verifiable truths. Attitudes are subjective, so they're not facts. So I can eliminate this option.

Option J: A perception. Perception is how you view or interpret something. Attitudes influence perception, but communicating an attitude doesn't make it a perception. It's more about the expression of that perception.

Now, going back. The key is understanding what happens when you communicate an attitude. Let's think about it differently. An attitude is a person's feeling or disposition toward something. When they communicate it, they're expressing their view or stance. 

So, an opinion is a view or judgment formed about something, which aligns with the expression of an attitude. So when you communicate your attitude, you're expressing your opinion.

Wait, but what about point of view? That's also a perspective. Let me consider definitions. A point of view is the way you look at something, which can be broader than an opinion. But when you communicate your attitude, it's more specific—it's your opinion on the matter.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a belief. Because an attitude is based on beliefs, but when you express it, it becomes a belief? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Attitudes can be influenced by beliefs and values, but expressing an attitude is more about stating an opinion.

So I'm leaning towards D: An opinion. Because when you communicate your attitude, you are giving your opinion on something.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes opinions and attitudes are similar. Let me think again. Attitudes are evaluations (positive, negative, neutral) towards objects, people, or ideas. When you express that evaluation, you're stating your opinion on the matter.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be D: An opinion.

When an attitude is communicated, it becomes an opinion. An attitude refers to a person's feelings or disposition toward something, and when expressed, it takes the form of a view or judgment, which is essentially an opinion. Among the options provided, "an opinion" most accurately captures the transformation of an attitude upon communication.
