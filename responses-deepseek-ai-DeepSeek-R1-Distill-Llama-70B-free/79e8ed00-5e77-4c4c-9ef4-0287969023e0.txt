Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the moral distinction between killing and letting die. The question is asking whether we are equally to blame for allowing people in Third World countries to starve as we would be for doing something else. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the killing/letting die distinction is a common topic in ethics, especially in discussions about moral responsibility. Killing usually refers to actively causing someone's death, while letting die is more about passively allowing someone to die, maybe by not acting to prevent it.

The question is about whether the blame is the same in both cases. So, the setup is that allowing people to starve (letting die) is being compared to another action that's more active, like killing.

Looking at the options, I need to find which action is an example of actively causing their deaths, similar to killing. Let me go through each option:

A: Killing them by blocking access to clean water. That sounds active because you're taking an action to block something they need. So this is a direct action leading to death.

B: Killing them by sending poisoned food. Also active and intentional, obviously worse because it's directly causing harm.

C: Refusing to share agricultural technology. That's more passive. It's not directly causing their death; it's just not helping them, so it's a letting die situation.

D: Withholding medicine they need. Again, that's passive. You're not giving them what they need, so they die. So this is letting die, not active killing.

E: Exploiting resources without fair compensation. That's more about unfair trade practices, maybe contributing to their poverty but not directly causing starvation in the same way.

F: Denying fair trade opportunities. Similar to E, it's about economic policies that might harm them, but again, it's a more indirect way of letting die.

G: Depriving them of knowledge to produce food. This is passive; you're not giving them the information they need, which could lead to starvation, but it's still a form of letting die.

H: Imposing economic sanctions leading to shortages. Sanctions can cause shortages, which can cause starvation. This is a more active policy that directly leads to their death, so it's similar to killing.

I: Depriving them of land for farming. Taking their land would make it harder for them to grow food, leading to starvation. This is an active action causing their death.

J: Refusing to give them money to buy food. This is again a passive action; you're not providing aid, so they starve.

The question is asking which option is something we'd be equally to blame for, comparing allowing starvation (letting die) to actively killing. So we're looking for an action that's more active, like killing.

Option A is about actively blocking access to clean water, which is a direct action leading to death, making it similar to killing. Similarly, Option B is sending poisoned food, which is also active and directly causing death. Option H involves imposing sanctions that cause shortages, which is a policy action leading to starvation. Option I is taking their land, which is also an active cause.

But the question is phrased as whether we are equally to blame for allowing them to starve as we would be for [action]. So the [action] should be an active killing. The most direct example is probably option A or B.

Wait, the question is about whether allowing them to starve is as blameworthy as another action. So if the other action is active killing, then the comparison is between letting die and killing.

So the correct answer would be an action that's an active form of killing. Looking back, the question is which option presents an action that's active killing.

Option A: blocking access to water is active. So if we allow starvation (letting die), are we as blameworthy as killing by blocking water? That's the comparison.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Option D is withholding medicine, which is letting die, not killing. So the question is looking for an action that is killing, so A, B, H, or I.

The question is about whether allowing to starve (letting die) is as bad as killing. So the answer needs to be an example of killing. The options A and B are both about killing.

But which one is more directly comparable to starvation? Maybe A is about blocking water, which leads to death by thirst, whereas starvation is death by lack of food. So maybe the better comparison is between starvation and another form of causing death through lack of a necessity.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is A. Because blocking access to clean water would lead to death, similar to starvation leading to death. So the question is whether letting them starve is as bad as actively killing them by denying water.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is A.

The question revolves around the moral distinction between killing and letting die, specifically whether allowing people in Third World countries to starve (letting die) is as blameworthy as actively killing them. To answer this, we need to identify an action that represents active killing, comparable to letting die in terms of moral responsibility.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Killing by blocking access to clean water is an active action that directly causes death, similar to starvation caused by letting die. This makes it a strong candidate for comparison.
- **B**: Killing by sending poisoned food is also active but involves directly causing harm, which is more intentional and severe than blocking water.
- **C, D, G, J**: These involve passive actions (withholding aid or resources), which align more with letting die rather than active killing.
- **E, F**: These are about unfair economic practices, which contribute to poverty but do not directly cause starvation.
- **H, I**: These involve active actions (imposing sanctions or taking land) that lead to starvation, making them examples of active killing.

Option **A** stands out as the most direct comparison because blocking access to clean water, like starvation, involves denying a basic necessity for survival. Both actions lead to death through deprivation, making them morally comparable in terms of blame.

Answer: A
