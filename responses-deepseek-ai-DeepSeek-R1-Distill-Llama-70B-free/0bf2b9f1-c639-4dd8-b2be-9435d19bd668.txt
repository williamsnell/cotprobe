Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer between a spherical automobile component and a cubical oven. Both are considered black bodies, which I remember means they absorb all incident radiation and emit radiation based on their temperature.

Let me read the question again. The component is 6 inches in diameter, so the radius would be half of that, which is 3 inches. But wait, I need to make sure all units are consistent. The oven is a cube with a side length of 5 feet. Oh, right, I should convert everything to the same unit system. Let's choose feet because the oven's side is given in feet.

Wait, no, wait. The component is in inches, so maybe I should convert its size to feet as well. Let me think: 6 inches is 0.5 feet because 12 inches = 1 foot. So the diameter is 0.5 ft, radius is 0.25 ft.

The initial temperature of the component is 80°F, and the oven is at 560°F. But wait, when dealing with thermal radiation, temperatures are usually in absolute units like Kelvin or Rankine. Oh right, because the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses absolute temperatures. So I need to convert these Fahrenheit temperatures to Rankine.

Conversion from Fahrenheit to Rankine is straightforward: °R = °F + 459.67. So the component is at 80 + 459.67 = 539.67 R, and the oven is at 560 + 459.67 = 1019.67 R.

The problem asks for the net heat transferred from the oven to the component. So that's the heat lost by the oven minus the heat gained by the component, but since the oven is hotter, the net transfer is from oven to component.

The formula for the power radiated by a black body is P = εσA T^4. Since both are black bodies, ε is 1 for both. So the power emitted by the oven is P_oven = σ * A_oven * T_oven^4. Similarly, the power emitted by the component is P_component = σ * A_component * T_component^4.

But wait, the heat transfer is the net from the oven to the component. So the oven's radiation that's absorbed by the component, and the component's radiation that's absorbed by the oven. But since the oven is much larger, I think we can model it as the component being inside the oven, so the component is surrounded by the oven walls.

Wait, wait, no. The component is placed inside the oven. So the oven's walls are at 560°F, and the component is at 80°F. So the component will absorb radiation from the oven walls and the oven walls will absorb radiation from the component.

But the oven's walls are much bigger, so perhaps the component's radiation is negligible in heating the oven. But for the net heat transfer, it's the difference between the radiation absorbed by the component and the radiation it emits.

Alternatively, since both are black bodies, the net heat transfer rate (power) from the oven to the component would be the power emitted by the oven and absorbed by the component, minus the power emitted by the component and absorbed by the oven.

Wait, but the oven's walls are probably considered as a surrounding at their temperature, so the component is in a radiation environment where the surroundings are at 560°F.

So the net power transfer to the component is P = σ * A_component * (T_oven^4 - T_component^4).

Because the component's surface area is A_component, and the oven is at T_oven. So the component emits P = σ A T_component^4, but absorbs P = σ A T_oven^4. So net is the difference.

Wait, that's the formula I remember for radiative heat transfer between two bodies when one is completely surrounding the other. So yeah, the net heat transfer rate Q is σ A (T_surroundings^4 - T_object^4).

So let's compute that.

First, calculate the surface area of the spherical component. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr². The radius is 0.25 ft.

So A_component = 4 * π * (0.25)^2 = 4π*(0.0625) = 0.25π ft².

Wait, 0.25 * 4 is 1, so 1 * π * 0.0625?

Wait, no, 4π*(0.25)^2 = 4π*(0.0625) = 0.25π. Because 4 * 0.0625 is 0.25.

So A = 0.25 * π ≈ 0.7854 ft².

Now, the temperatures in Rankine: T_oven = 1019.67 R, T_component = 539.67 R.

The Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ is 0.1714 × 10^-8 Btu/hr·ft²·°R⁴. Wait, I'm a bit unsure about the exact value. Let me recall: σ is approximately 5.67×10^-8 W/m²·K⁴, but in imperial units, I think it's 0.1714×10^-8 Btu/hr·ft²·°R⁴.

So σ = 0.1714e-8 Btu/hr·ft²·R⁻⁴.

Now plug into the formula:

Q = σ * A * (T_oven^4 - T_component^4)

Calculating each term:

Compute T_oven^4: (1019.67)^4

Hmm, that's a big number. Similarly for T_component.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the difference as (T_oven^4 - T_component^4) = (T_oven² + T_component²)(T_oven + T_component)(T_oven - T_component).

But that might not save much time. Alternatively, compute each term step by step.

Wait, maybe I can compute the two terms separately.

Compute T_oven^4:

1019.67^4.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to compute (T_oven / 100)^4 * 1e8, since 100^4 is 1e8.

Wait, let's approximate.

Wait, 1019.67 is about 1020 R.

So 1020^4 = (1000 + 20)^4. But I can compute 1020^4.

But perhaps using a calculator approach.

Wait, I'm trying to think without a calculator, but maybe I can compute each value step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the exact calculation is necessary, but I'm trying to get through it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the temperature difference is significant, so the T_component^4 is much smaller than T_oven^4, so maybe we can ignore it, but I don't think so because 500 R is half of 1000 R, so (1/2)^4 is 1/16, so 6% of the higher term. So perhaps it's not negligible, but let's include both.

So let's compute each term.

First, T_oven = 1019.67 R ≈ 1020 R.

T_oven^4 = (1020)^4.

Let me compute 1020^2 first: 1020 * 1020 = (1000 + 20)^2 = 1000^2 + 2*1000*20 + 20^2 = 1e6 + 4e4 + 4e2 = 1,040,400.

Then 1020^4 = (1,040,400)^2. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps it's 1,040,400 * 1,040,400. Let me approximate this.

But maybe I should use exponents. Let me write 1,040,400 as 1.0404e6. Then (1.0404e6)^2 = (1.0404)^2 * 1e12.

1.0404 squared is approximately 1.082. So 1.082e12.

Similarly, T_component is 539.67 R, which I'll approximate as 540 R.

Compute 540^4.

540^2 is 291,600. Then 291,600^2 is what?

2916e2 squared is (2916e2)^2 = 2916^2 * e4.

2916^2 = let's compute 2900^2 = 8,410,000, plus 2*(2900)*(16) = 2*2900*16= 92,800, plus 16^2=256. So 8,410,000 + 92,800 +256 = 8,502, 056.

So 8,502,056 * 1e4 = 8.502056e10.

Wait, wait, 540^4 = (540^2)^2 = (291600)^2 = (2.916e5)^2 = 8.503636e10.

Wait, 291600 * 291600: 2916 * 2916 gives 8,502,056, then with four zeros from 600*600, which is 360,000? No, wait, no. 291600 is 2.916e5, so squared is 8.5036e10.

So T_oven^4 ≈ 1.082e12 R^4, T_component^4 ≈ 8.5036e10 R^4.

So the difference: 1.082e12 - 8.5036e10 = let's compute that.

1.082e12 is 10,820,000,000,000.

8.5036e10 is 850,360,000,000.

Subtracting gives 10,820,000,000,000 - 850,360,000,000 = 9,969,640,000,000 R^4.

Wait, but let me double-check the exponents:

Wait, 1.082e12 is 1,082,000,000,000.

8.5036e10 is 85,036,000,000.

So the difference is 1,082,000,000,000 - 85,036,000,000 = 996,964,000,000 R^4.

Wait, 1,082,000,000,000 minus 85,036,000,000.

1,082,000,000,000 - 85,036,000,000 = 996,964,000,000.

So (T_oven^4 - T_component^4) ≈ 996,964,000,000 R^4.

Now, the surface area A is approximately 0.7854 ft².

So Q = σ * A * (T_oven^4 - T_component^4) = 0.1714e-8 Btu/hr·ft²·R⁴ * 0.7854 ft² * 996,964e6 R^4.

Wait, 996,964,000,000 is 9.96964e11 R^4.

Wait, no, 996,964,000,000 is 9.96964e11, yes.

So let me compute each part.

First, σ = 0.1714e-8 = 1.714e-9.

A = 0.7854 ft².

So:

Q = 1.714e-9 Btu/(hr·ft²·R⁴) * 0.7854 ft² * 9.96964e11 R^4.

Multiply the constants:

1.714e-9 * 0.7854 = approx 1.714 * 0.7854 = around 1.347e-9.

Then multiply by 9.96964e11:

1.347e-9 * 9.96964e11 = 1.347 * 9.96964e2.

Because 1e-9 * 1e11 = 1e2.

1.347 * 9.96964 ≈ let's compute 1.347 * 10 = 13.47, subtract 1.347 * 0.03036 (since 10 - 9.96964=0.03036) → 1.347 * 0.03036 ≈ 0.0409.

So 13.47 - 0.0409 ≈ 13.4291.

So Q ≈ 13.4291 * 1e2 = 1342.91 Btu/hr.

Looking at the options, option H is 1344 Btu/hr. That's very close to my calculation, which must be due to rounding during the approximations. So the correct answer should be H.

To calculate the net heat transferred from the oven to the component, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiative heat transfer between two black bodies. The formula for the net heat transfer rate is:

\[
Q = \sigma A \left(T_{\text{oven}}^4 - T_{\text{component}}^4\right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Rankine
The temperatures must be in absolute units (Rankine, °R) for the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
- \(T_{\text{oven}} = 560^\circ\text{F} + 459.67 = 1019.67^\circ\text{R}\)
- \(T_{\text{component}} = 80^\circ\text{F} + 459.67 = 539.67^\circ\text{R}\)

### Step 2: Calculate the surface area of the component
The component is a sphere with a diameter of 6 inches (0.5 feet), so its radius is \(r = 0.25 \, \text{ft}\). The surface area of a sphere is:

\[
A = 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi (0.25)^2 = 0.25 \pi \, \text{ft}^2 \approx 0.7854 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \(T_{\text{oven}}^4\) and \(T_{\text{component}}^4\)
Using approximations for simplicity:
- \(T_{\text{oven}}^4 \approx (1019.67)^4 \approx 1.082 \times 10^{12} \, \text{R}^4\)
- \(T_{\text{component}}^4 \approx (539.67)^4 \approx 8.5036 \times 10^{10} \, \text{R}^4\)

The difference is:

\[
T_{\text{oven}}^4 - T_{\text{component}}^4 \approx 1.082 \times 10^{12} - 8.5036 \times 10^{10} = 9.96964 \times 10^{11} \, \text{R}^4
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the net heat transfer rate
The Stefan-Boltzmann constant in imperial units is \(\sigma = 0.1714 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2\text{·R}^4\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
Q = \sigma A \left(T_{\text{oven}}^4 - T_{\text{component}}^4\right)
\]

\[
Q = (0.1714 \times 10^{-8}) (0.7854) (9.96964 \times 10^{11})
\]

First, calculate \(\sigma A\):

\[
\sigma A = 0.1714 \times 10^{-8} \times 0.7854 \approx 1.347 \times 10^{-9}
\]

Now multiply by \((T_{\text{oven}}^4 - T_{\text{component}}^4)\):

\[
Q = 1.347 \times 10^{-9} \times 9.96964 \times 10^{11} \approx 1342.91 \, \text{Btu/hr}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The calculated value of \(Q \approx 1342.91 \, \text{Btu/hr}\) is very close to option **H: 1344 Btu/hr**, which accounts for rounding differences during intermediate steps.

ANSWER: H
