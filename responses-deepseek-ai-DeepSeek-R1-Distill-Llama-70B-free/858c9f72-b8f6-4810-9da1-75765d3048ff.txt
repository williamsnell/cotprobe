Okay, so I've got this question about fluid dynamics, specifically dealing with potential functions for an irrotational flow. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that phi equals x squared minus y squared is the potential function. Wait, I remember that in fluid dynamics, the potential function phi is related to the velocity components. Oh right, for irrotational flow, the velocity is the gradient of the potential function. So the velocity components are the partial derivatives of phi with respect to each coordinate.

So, the velocity components V_x, V_y, and V_z should be the partial derivatives of phi with respect to x, y, and z respectively. Let me write that down.

Phi is given as phi = x² - y².

So, the partial derivative of phi with respect to x is 2x. That would be V_x. Then, the partial derivative with respect to y is -2y, so V_y is -2y. And for V_z, since phi doesn't depend on z, the partial derivative is zero. So V_z should be zero.

Wait, let me double-check. The velocity is the gradient of phi, which is (d(phi)/dx, d(phi)/dy, d(phi)/dz). So yes, V_x = 2x, V_y = -2y, and V_z = 0.

Looking at the options, option C says V_x=2x, V_y=-2y, V_z=0. That matches what I got. But wait, let me see the other options to be sure.

Option B has V_x=2y, V_y=-2x. That doesn't match because the derivatives are with respect to x and y, not mixed. Option D is linear in x, y, z but with coefficients 1, which doesn't fit. Option E is all zeros, which can't be right because we have non-zero derivatives. Option F has all components as 2 times their variables, which doesn't match since V_y here is negative. Option G has squared terms, but we're taking derivatives so it should be linear. Option H has negative 2x, which is the opposite of what I found. Option I has V_z=z, which isn't correct because phi doesn't depend on z. Option J has V_x=x and V_y=-y, which is half of what I calculated because the derivative of x² is 2x. Oh, wait, J's components are x and -y, but that's only if phi were (1/2)x² - (1/2)y². Since phi is x² - y², the derivatives are 2x and -2y.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the velocity components for an irrotational flow given the potential function \(\phi = x^2 - y^2\), we use the relationship that the velocity components are the partial derivatives of the potential function. Specifically:

- \(V_x = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\)
- \(V_y = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\)
- \(V_z = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}\)

1. **Calculating \(V_x\):**  
   The partial derivative of \(\phi = x^2 - y^2\) with respect to \(x\) is:  
   \[
   V_x = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} = 2x
   \]

2. **Calculating \(V_y\):**  
   The partial derivative of \(\phi = x^2 - y^2\) with respect to \(y\) is:  
   \[
   V_y = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} = -2y
   \]

3. **Calculating \(V_z\):**  
   Since \(\phi\) does not depend on \(z\), the partial derivative with respect to \(z\) is:  
   \[
   V_z = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} = 0
   \]

Thus, the velocity components are \(V_x = 2x\), \(V_y = -2y\), and \(V_z = 0\). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct match is **Option C**.
