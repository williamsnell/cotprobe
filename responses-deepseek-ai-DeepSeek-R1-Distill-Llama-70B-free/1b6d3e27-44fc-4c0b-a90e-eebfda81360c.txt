Okay, so I've got this question about child development and memory strategies. The question is asking when children start using rehearsal, elaboration, and organization as memory strategies regularly and deliberately. The options are from A to J, each giving different age ranges.

Hmm, I remember that children develop these strategies as they grow, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact ages. Let me try to piece this together. I think Piaget's theory of cognitive development is related here, but I'm not entirely sure. Piaget's stages include sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. But wait, the question is about memory strategies, not just general cognitive abilities.

Oh right, there's something about strategy development in children. I recall that young kids don't use strategies much. For example, before a certain age, they might not even realize that using a strategy can help them remember better. So, the idea is that as they enter certain stages, they begin to use these techniques.

Rehearsal is like repeating information to remember it. Elaboration involves adding more details or associations to make the information stick. Organization is structuring information in a way that makes it easier to remember, like grouping similar items together.

When do these strategies kick in? I think it's around when children are a bit older, maybe pre-teens. Wait, but I'm not certain. I remember that before adolescence, kids might not use these strategies effectively. So, perhaps it's around 10-12 years old.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that the use of mnemonics and such strategies becomes more common in late childhood. So maybe around 9 to 10 or 10 to 12. Let me think about the options. Option D is 10 to 12, H is 9 to 10. 

I'm trying to remember any specific studies or information. Maybe the book I read mentioned that by around 10 years old, children start using these strategies regularly. So that would align with option D: 10-12 years.

Alternatively, I could be mixing it up with other developmental milestones. Like, maybe it's earlier, around 7-8. Option G is 7-8. But I think that's when they start showing some understanding but not regularly using the strategies effectively.

Wait, another angle: the question says 'deliberately and regularly' use these strategies. So when do they become consistent in using them? I think that's more during the concrete operational stage, which is around 7-11 years old. But again, I'm not sure when exactly the deliberate use peaks.

I think the key here is that deliberate strategy use starts to become more common in late childhood, perhaps around 10-12 years. So I'm leaning towards option D: 10 to 12.

Another point: I remember that younger children, like those in the preoperational stage, don't use rehearsal much. They might start simple forms of rehearsal as they get older, but more complex strategies like elaboration and organization come later.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is probably D: 10 to 12 years old. So the answer is D.

The question asks when children begin to deliberately and regularly use memory strategies like rehearsal, elaboration, and organization. These strategies involve repeating information (rehearsal), adding details to enhance memory (elaboration), and structuring information for better retention (organization). 

Developmentally, younger children typically do not use these strategies effectively. As they grow older, particularly during late childhood, they start employing these techniques more consistently. The concrete operational stage (around 7-11 years) marks the beginning of more logical thinking, but deliberate and regular use of memory strategies tends to occur slightly later. By around 10-12 years old, children are more likely to use these strategies deliberately and regularly, as their cognitive abilities mature further.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: 10 to 12

Answer: D
