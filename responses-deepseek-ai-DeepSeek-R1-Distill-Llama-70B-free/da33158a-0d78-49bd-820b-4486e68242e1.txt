Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many kilos of tea James Milford bought. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. He spent $348.88, and the tea costs $0.98 per kilogram. I need to find out the number of kilos he purchased. 

Hmm, right, this is a division problem because I have the total amount spent and the price per kilo. So to find the quantity, I should divide the total cost by the price per kilo. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm setting it up correctly. The formula should be quantity = total cost / price per unit. So that's 348.88 divided by 0.98. 

Let me think about how to do this division. Maybe I can simplify it. Oh, wait, 0.98 is almost a dollar, so the number of kilos should be a bit less than 348.88. Because each kilo is 98 cents, which is slightly less than a dollar, so the quantity will be a bit more than 348. But wait, no, wait. If each kilo is less than a dollar, then for a dollar, you get a little more than a kilo. So when you have total dollars, dividing by less than a dollar should give you more than the dollar amount. So 348.88 divided by 0.98 should be a bit more than 348.88. Wait, let me think again. 

Wait, no, if the price per kilo is lower, you can buy more kilos. So yes, if each kilo is $0.98, then with $348.88, you can buy more than 348 kilos. Because each kilo is cheaper than a dollar. So 348.88 / 0.98 should be more than 348.88. So looking at the options, the options are A:370, B:380, C:345, D:375, E:400, F:340, G:325, H:356, I:365, J:350.

I need to calculate 348.88 divided by 0.98. Let me do this step by step. Maybe I can write it as 348.88 ÷ 0.98. Alternatively, to make it easier, I could multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal, so that becomes 34888 ÷ 98.

Now, I'll try to do this division. Let me see, 98 goes into 348 how many times? Well, 98 times 3 is 294. 98 times 4 is 392. That's too much because 392 is larger than 348. So 3 times. 3 times 98 is 294. Subtract that from 348, and we get 54. Bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 548.

Now, how many times does 98 go into 548? Let's see: 98 * 5 is 490, 98*6=588, which is too big. So 5 times. 5*98=490. Subtract that from 548, gives 58. Bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 588.

98 goes into 588 exactly 6 times because 98*6=588. Subtract that, and we have zero. So so far, we have 3 (from the first division), then 5, then 6. Wait, wait, let me check that again. 

Wait, actually, the initial division steps might be a bit off. Let me try another approach. Maybe using estimation. If 0.98 is close to 1, then 348.88 /0.98 is approximately 348.88 + (348.88 *0.02), since 0.98 is 1 - 0.02. So that's 348.88 * (1/0.98) ≈ 348.88 * (1 + 0.02 + 0.0004). Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 348.88 divided by 0.98. Let me write it as 348.88 / 0.98. 

Another way to approach division by 0.98 is to multiply numerator and denominator by 100, so it's 34888 / 98. Let me try that again.

So 98 into 34888. Let's see how many times 98 goes into 348. As before, 3 times. So 3*98=294. Subtract from 348, we get 54. Bring down the 8, making 548.

98 into 548. 5*98=490. Subtract, 548-490=58. Bring down the next 8, making 588.

98 into 588 is exactly 6 times because 6*98=588. So now, the quotient is 3 (hundreds place), then 5 (tens), then 6 (units). So 356. So the total is 356. 

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options include H as 356. So that would be the answer. But let me double-check my division to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 98 times 356. Let me compute 98*356. 

Let me break it down: 98 * 300 = 29,400. 98 * 50=4,900. 98 *6=588. So adding those together: 29,400 + 4,900 = 34,300. 34,300 +588= 34,888. Oh wait, but the numerator was 34,888 (from 348.88 when multiplied by 100). So 98 times 356 is 34,888, which matches. So yes, 356 is correct. 

So the correct answer is H: 356 kilos.

To determine how many kilos of tea James Milford purchased, we need to divide the total amount spent ($348.88) by the price per kilogram ($0.98). This can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Quantity} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Price per Kilo}} = \frac{348.88}{0.98}
\]

To simplify the division, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal:

\[
\frac{348.88}{0.98} = \frac{34888}{98}
\]

Performing the division step-by-step:

1. **Divide 348 by 98**:  
   \( 98 \times 3 = 294 \), which is less than 348. Subtracting, \( 348 - 294 = 54 \).  
   Bring down the next digit (8), making it 548.

2. **Divide 548 by 98**:  
   \( 98 \times 5 = 490 \), which is less than 548. Subtracting, \( 548 - 490 = 58 \).  
   Bring down the next digit (8), making it 588.

3. **Divide 588 by 98**:  
   \( 98 \times 6 = 588 \), which is exactly 588. Subtracting, \( 588 - 588 = 0 \).

Thus, the quotient is 356, meaning James Milford purchased **356 kilos** of tea. This matches option **H**.

**Answer: H**
