Question:

A 45-year-old woman has a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating; she was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 μU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder
B: Social anxiety disorder
C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder
D: Adjustment disorder
E: Post-traumatic stress disorder
F: Hypothyroidism
G: Panic disorder
H: Agoraphobia
I: Specific phobia
J: Acute stress disorder

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a 2-week history of symptoms like increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. She was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot three weeks ago. Her medications include levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and an OTC inhaler for exercise-induced asthma. Her vital signs show BP 140/80, pulse 100, which is a bit high. On exam, she has dry skin and hair. She's cooperative but seems anxious, glancing around when a noise is heard. Her leukocyte count is 12,000, which is a bit elevated, and her TSH is 5.0 μU/mL, which is within the normal range since normal is usually around 0.4 to 4.5 or so, but some labs go up to 5. Her ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

Hmm, the question is asking for the most likely diagnosis from the options given. Let's go through the possibilities.

First, let's consider her symptoms. She's anxious, has abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. These started after a traumatic event—being robbed at knifepoint. So, that makes me think of something related to trauma, maybe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or acute stress disorder.

Wait, but wait. PTSD typically has symptoms that last more than a month, right? While acute stress disorder (ASD) is for symptoms that occur within a month of the trauma. In this case, it's been three weeks since the trauma, so maybe ASD is a possibility.

But looking at the options, option J is acute stress disorder, and E is PTSD. So, perhaps J? But let me think more.

She's also exhibiting hypervigilance, as she's glancing around quickly when a noise is heard. That's a classic symptom of PTSD or ASD. She's cooperative but anxious.

Her physical symptoms: dry skin and hair. That could be related to hypothyroidism, but she's on levothyroxine, and her TSH is 5.0. Wait, levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism, so if her TSH is a bit high, maybe her dose needs adjustment. But her TSH being 5.0—normal range is like 0.4-4.5, so 5 is slightly elevated. Could she have hypothyroidism? Well, her symptoms include dry skin and hair, which align with hypothyroidism, but wait, she's on levothyroxine. Maybe her dose isn't adequate, but her TSH is only slightly elevated. So perhaps she's not optimally treated yet. But her main symptoms are anxiety and such, which could be separate.

Wait, the question is about the most likely diagnosis for her current presentation. So, considering her trauma history, her anxiety, and the timing.

She was robbed three weeks ago, and her symptoms started two weeks ago. So the trauma was three weeks ago, and the symptoms started two weeks ago, so it's been about a week or so into having symptoms.

Wait, no, she has a two-week history, so the time since the trauma is three weeks, so the symptoms have been present for two weeks. So the duration is two weeks.

So, for acute stress disorder, the symptoms last for at least 2 days and up to a month. So her symptoms are two weeks old, so that fits. So J is acute stress disorder.

But let's think about the other options. PTSD requires symptoms to last more than a month, so that's probably not it yet.

What about adjustment disorder? Adjustment disorders are in response to a stressor but don't meet the criteria for ASD or PTSD. Her stressor was the robbery, which is a traumatic event, so adjustment disorder might not be the best fit, because the event is traumatic, making ASD/PTSD more likely.

Her anxiety could also be part of another anxiety disorder like generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder. GAD is more about excessive worry for at least six months, which doesn't fit here, as her symptoms are only two weeks old. Panic disorder involves recurrent panic attacks, which she doesn't mention.

So, the key here is the trauma and the symptoms following it. She's showing signs of hypervigilance and anxiety following a traumatic event, so that points towards ASD or PTSD. Since it's only been three weeks since the trauma and her symptoms are two weeks old, it's less than a month, making ASD (J) more likely than PTSD (E).

Another thing to consider is her physical symptoms. She has sinus tachycardia, which can be due to anxiety or stress, and a slightly elevated leukocyte count—maybe stress-induced. Her TSH is slightly high, but she's on levothyroxine, so maybe her hypothyroidism isn't fully controlled. But her main issue seems to be psychological in this context.

So, the most likely diagnosis is acute stress disorder (J).

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a 2-week history of anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, which began after being robbed at knifepoint three weeks ago. She exhibits hypervigilance, as evidenced by glancing around quickly when a noise is heard, and has physical symptoms such as dry skin and hair. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, and her TSH is slightly elevated at 5.0 μU/mL, suggesting possible under-treatment of hypothyroidism. However, her primary symptoms align with a psychological response to trauma.

Given the timing of her symptoms (2 weeks after the traumatic event) and their nature (anxiety, hypervigilance), the most likely diagnosis is **acute stress disorder (ASD)**. ASD is characterized by symptoms occurring within a month of a traumatic event, which fits this patient's presentation. While post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also a consideration, it requires symptoms to persist for more than a month, making ASD the more appropriate diagnosis at this time. Other anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder, are less likely due to the specific trauma-related context and the short duration of symptoms.

Answer: J
