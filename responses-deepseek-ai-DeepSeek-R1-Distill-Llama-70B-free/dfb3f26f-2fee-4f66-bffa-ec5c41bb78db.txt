Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about how the English treatment of natives in the New World differed from the practices described in an excerpt by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the excerpt again to understand the context. It's about the treatment of Indians in the mines, particularly in Huancavelica and Potosi. The author describes harsh conditions, torture, and various exploitative practices. The mine owners, including Spaniards, mestizos, and Indians, are tyrannical and don't fear God or justice. They aren't audited, so they can get away with a lot. The Indians aren't paid for their travel or time at the mines. They're forced to do other chores under the guise of mining work, like herding cattle and transporting goods. They're sent to the plains where many die, and they aren't compensated. Additionally, the mine owners keep Indian women as concubines under the pretext of cooking. The Indians are also forced to buy goods from the owners, which leads to debt and inability to pay tribute. The colonial officials are bribed, and even the protector of the Indians doesn't help, failing to inform the higher authorities about the abuses.

So, the question is asking about the differences between these Spanish practices and the English treatment of natives. I need to think about what the English did that was different.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Widely did not condone intermingling with the natives. Hmm, I'm not sure. I know that intermarriage and mixing happened in both English and Spanish colonies, but perhaps more so in Spanish areas because of the mestizo population. But I'm not certain if this is the main difference.

Option B: Immediately granted the natives citizenship rights. That doesn't sound right. The English didn't grant citizenship to natives; in fact, they often excluded them and treated them as inferior.

Option C: Viewed the natives as true equals as they settled the Americas. No, the English didn't see them as equals. They often considered themselves superior, so this isn't correct.

Option D: Did not allow the natives to live in the territories they conquered. Well, I think both the Spanish and English took over native lands, so this might not be the difference. The Spanish often had natives living in the same areas but under their control.

Option E: Did not use the natives for any labor. No, that's not true. English colonies used native labor, especially in the early years, though perhaps not as extensively as the Spanish with their encomienda system and forced mining labor.

Option F: Forced the natives to convert to Christianity. The Spanish definitely did this, using missions and the church to convert natives. The English also had some missionary efforts, but maybe not as widespread or forced. I'm not sure if this is the key difference.

Option G: Used the natives as guides and allies in their exploration. Oh, I remember that the English, especially early on, often formed alliances with native tribes, using them as guides and allies against other European powers or other native groups. The Spanish also used natives as guides, but perhaps the English relied more on them as allies in conflicts, like during the colonization of New England.

Option H: Used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton. The Spanish used natives for mining and other labor, while the English in some areas used indentured servants and later African slaves for cash crops. So maybe the English didn't use natives as much for this, but I'm not certain it's the main difference.

Option I: Were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership. Both the English and Spanish had different land ownership concepts compared to natives. The Spanish might have been more focused on land grants and the encomienda system, while the English had their own ideas about land ownership. But I'm not sure if this is the main point.

Option J: Forced the natives to pay tribute in gold and precious stones. The Spanish definitely did this, as seen in the excerpt. The English might have imposed their own forms of tribute, but perhaps not in the same way.

So, the main differences I'm thinking about are how each treated the natives in terms of labor, alliances, and conversion.

The excerpt focuses on the Spanish using natives for forced labor in mines, not paying them, and various abuses. So, the English treatment would differ in some key way.

Option G says the English used natives as guides and allies. I think that's accurate because, for example, the Pilgrims allied with the Wampanoag, and other English colonies formed alliances with native tribes, especially when it was beneficial for trade or defense. The Spanish, while sometimes allying with certain groups, were more focused on exploiting labor and resources directly.

Another point is that the Spanish had a more extensive system of forced labor, like the mita system in mines, which the English didn't replicate. The English might have used indentured servants and later African slaves more than relying on native labor for large-scale projects.

So, the key difference is that the English used natives as guides and allies more so than the Spanish did. Therefore, the answer would be option G.

The question asks how English treatment of natives in the New World differed from the practices described in the excerpt by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, which details Spanish exploitation and abuse of Indians in mines. The Spanish forced natives into harsh labor conditions, unpaid work, and imposed tribute, while also engaging in corrupt practices and failing to protect native rights. The English, while also exploiting natives, had some key differences.

Analyzing the options, the most significant difference is that the English often used natives as guides and allies, particularly during exploration and colonization. For example, early English colonists formed alliances with native tribes for mutual benefit, such as trade or defense, as seen with the Wampanoag and the Pilgrims. This practice contrasts with the Spanish, who focused more on direct exploitation and forced labor in systems like the mita. While both groups exploited natives, the English reliance on natives as guides and allies stands out as a key distinction.
