Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the excerpts below.
This corruption is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term sin . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545
The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545

C: They believed in religious tolerance and the acceptance of different faiths.
D: Religion was used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs.
E: The corruption of the Roman Catholic Church and its leaders meant that reform was needed.

G: The notion that salvation is predetermined and not all individuals have access to it.
H: The idea that churches should be self-governed and independent.
I: The idea that religious teachings should be made available in the vernacular rather than in Latin.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Protestant reformers, specifically John Calvin. The question gives two excerpts from Calvin's Institutes and asks which justification used by Protestant reformers is alluded to in them. The options are from A to J.

First, I'll read the excerpts carefully. The first one talks about sin and corruption, listing things like adultery, theft, hatred, etc. Calvin says these are fruits of sin, and because of this corruption, we're condemned by God who only accepts righteousness. So this seems to be about the inherent sinfulness of humanity and the need for divine judgment.

The second excerpt is about the covenant of life not being preached equally to all and that this is due to God's eternal election. It mentions that salvation is offered to some but not others based on God's pleasure, leading to questions about election and predestination. This part clearly discusses predestination and the idea that God chooses who is saved, which is a key Calvinist doctrine.

Now, looking at the question, it's asking which justification the Protestant reformers used is alluded to. So I need to connect these excerpts to one of the provided options.

The options are about various Protestant justifications. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Direct access to God without priests. That's more about the priesthood of all believers, which was a Lutheran idea, but the excerpts don't mention that.

Option B: Separation of church and state. I don't think that's what's being discussed here. The excerpts are about theology, not church-state relations.

Option C: Religious tolerance. Calvin was not exactly known for tolerance; in fact, he supported strict theological adherence, so this might not fit.

Option D: Challenging earthly monarchs. The excerpts are about God's judgment and salvation, not about challenging secular authorities.

Option E: Corruption in the Catholic Church needing reform. The first excerpt does talk about sin and corruption, but it's more about human sin, not specifically the Church's corruption. Although Calvin and Protestants did criticize the Church, I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

Option F: Church not subordinate to state. Again, that's more about governance, not the content of these excerpts.

Option G: Salvation is predetermined, not all have access. The second excerpt is all about predestination and election, so this seems to fit.

Option H: Churches self-governed. Not the focus here.

Option I: Vernacular teachings. Not mentioned in the excerpts.

Option J: Salvation through faith alone. While important, the excerpts don't directly discuss faith vs. works. They're more about sin and predestination.

So putting it together, the second excerpt is all about God choosing some for salvation and not others, which is predestination. So the justification is the notion that salvation is predetermined and not all can access it. That's option G.

The excerpts from John Calvin's *Institutes of Christian Religion* focus on the inherent sinfulness of humanity and the doctrine of predestination. The first excerpt emphasizes human corruption and divine judgment, while the second explicitly discusses God's eternal election, where salvation is predetermined and not universally accessible. This aligns with the Protestant Reformation's emphasis on predestination, a central tenet of Calvinism. Among the options provided, the justification alluded to is the belief that salvation is predetermined and not all individuals have access to it.

Answer: G
