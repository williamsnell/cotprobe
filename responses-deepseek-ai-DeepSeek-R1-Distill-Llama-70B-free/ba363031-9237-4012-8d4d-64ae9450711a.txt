Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out if the argument is valid using indirect truth tables. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The argument given is:
H ≡ (I · ~J)
K ≡ ~H
~(K ⊃ J) 
∴ I ≡ J

So the premises are H is equivalent to (I and not J), K is equivalent to not H, and the third premise is the negation of (K implies J). The conclusion is that I is equivalent to J.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. The premises are:
1. H ≡ (I · ~J)
2. K ≡ ~H
3. ~(K ⊃ J)
And the conclusion is I ≡ J.

I think I need to determine if this argument is valid. If it's invalid, I have to find a counterexample from the options given.

Alright, the method here is to use indirect truth tables. So, I remember that in an indirect truth table, we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Then, we check if this situation leads to a contradiction. If it does, the argument is valid. If not, it's invalid, and the scenario where the premises hold and the conclusion is false gives a counterexample.

So, the conclusion is I ≡ J. The negation of this is that I and J are not equivalent, meaning I ⊕ J (exclusive or). So for the indirect method, we'll assume that the premises are all true and that I and J are not equivalent.

Let me outline this:

Assumptions:
1. H ≡ (I · ~J) is true.
2. K ≡ ~H is true.
3. ~(K ⊃ J) is true.
4. I ≡ J is false. So I ⊕ J.

I need to see if these can all be true at the same time. If yes, then the argument is invalid, and that's a counterexample. If no, then the argument is valid.

Let's break down each premise.

First, H ≡ (I · ~J). So H is true exactly when I is true and J is false.

Second, K ≡ ~H. So K is true when H is false, and vice versa.

Third, ~(K ⊃ J) is equivalent to ~ ( ~K ∨ J ) which simplifies to K ∧ ~J. So the third premise simplifies to K being true and J being false.

So from the third premise, K is true and J is false.

Now, from the third premise, since K is true and J is false.

From the second premise, K ≡ ~H. So if K is true, then ~H is true, which means H is false.

Now, from the first premise, H ≡ (I · ~J). Since H is false, (I · ~J) must be false.

So (I · ~J) is false. Which means it's not the case that I is true and J is false. So either I is false, or J is true, or both.

But wait, from the third premise, J is false. Because K is true and J is false. So J is definitely false here.

So, since J is false, ~J is true. Therefore, (I · ~J) is equivalent to I. Because if ~J is true, then (I · ~J) is just I.

So (I · ~J) is false only if I is false, because ~J is true.

So from H being false, (I · ~J) is false, which implies I is false.

So putting this together: from the premises, we have K is true, J is false, H is false, and I is false.

Wait, but our assumption for the indirect method is that I and J are not equivalent. Let's see: J is false, and I is false. So I is false and J is false. So I and J are both false, which makes them equivalent (I≡J is true). But wait, we're assuming that I≡J is false, so I and J should be different.

Wait, that's a problem. Because from the premises, we have I is false and J is false. So I and J are both false, which makes I≡J true. But in our indirect method, we're assuming I≡J is false. So this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that the premises are true and I≡J is false cannot hold. So the argument must be valid.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.

So, if we assume the premises are true and I≡J is false, can that happen?

From premises:

3. ~(K⊃J) is true → K is true and J is false.

2. K is true → ~H is true → H is false.

1. H is equivalent to (I · ~J). H is false, so (I · ~J) is false.

But J is false (from 3), so ~J is true. So (I · ~J) is I. So I must be false.

So I is false, J is false.

Thus, I and J are both false, so I≡J is true. But in our assumption, I≡J is false. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the situation where the premises are true and I≡J is false cannot exist. Hence, the argument is valid.

But wait, the options given don't have option A as correct? Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: Valid
B: Invalid. ... etc.

So according to my reasoning, the answer should be A: Valid.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should construct the truth table for all the variables and see.

But since the method of indirect truth tables led to a contradiction, the argument is valid. So the answer is A.

But looking at the options, option A is valid, and others are invalid with counterexamples. So if the argument is valid, the correct choice is A.

Wait, but the options don't have any other possibilities. So I think the answer is A.

To determine the validity of the argument using indirect truth tables, we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. The argument is:

1. \( H \equiv (I \cdot \lnot J) \)
2. \( K \equiv \lnot H \)
3. \( \lnot (K \supset J) \)
4. \( \therefore I \equiv J \)

### Assumptions for Indirect Method:
- Premises 1, 2, and 3 are true.
- The conclusion \( I \equiv J \) is false, meaning \( I \oplus J \) (exclusive or).

### Analysis:
1. From \( \lnot (K \supset J) \), we simplify to \( K \land \lnot J \). Thus, \( K \) is true and \( J \) is false.
2. From \( K \equiv \lnot H \), since \( K \) is true, \( \lnot H \) is true, so \( H \) is false.
3. From \( H \equiv (I \cdot \lnot J) \), since \( H \) is false, \( (I \cdot \lnot J) \) is false. Given \( J \) is false (from step 1), \( \lnot J \) is true. Therefore, \( I \) must be false for \( (I \cdot \lnot J) \) to be false.
4. Now, \( I \) is false and \( J \) is false. This makes \( I \equiv J \) true because both are false.

### Contradiction:
We assumed \( I \equiv J \) is false (i.e., \( I \oplus J \)) but derived that \( I \equiv J \) is true. This contradiction shows that the premises being true and the conclusion being false cannot coexist. Therefore, the argument is valid.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Valid. This is correct because the argument is valid.
- **Options B-J:** All describe counterexamples for an invalid argument. Since the argument is valid, these are incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The argument is valid.
