Question:

A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?

Options:

A: It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother
B: It is a polymorphism
C: It is a sequence variant of unknown significance
D: It will change the folding of the protein

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a 10-year-old girl who's being evaluated for Marfan syndrome. The school nurse thinks she might have it. Let me see what the key points are here.

So, her height is at the 95th percentile, which is quite tall, and her weight is at the 25th, so she's slender. On physical exam, she has a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Those are classic signs of Marfan, right? Marfan often presents with tall stature, long limbs, joint issues, and sometimes dental problems.

They did molecular testing for FBN1, which is the gene commonly mutated in Marfan syndrome. The test found a single nucleotide difference that doesn't change the amino acid. Oh, wait, that's a synonymous variant, right? So same amino acid, just a different codon. Those are usually considered less likely to cause disease because they don't alter the protein structure.

Now, the mother is 163 cm, which is about 5'4", so not super tall. She doesn't have clinical evidence of Marfan, but she has the same nucleotide change as her daughter. Also, this change is found in 15 out of 200 people without Marfan. So, 15/200 is 7.5%, which is a pretty high frequency for something that's a pathogenic mutation. Usually, disease-causing mutations are rare in the population.

So the question is asking what this nucleotide change is. The options are about whether it's a mutation, a polymorphism, a variant of unknown significance, or affects protein folding.

Option A says it's a disease-causing mutation in both. But wait, the mother doesn't have Marfan, and the variant is common in healthy people. So if it were a disease-causing mutation, you'd expect more people with it to have the disease, but here it's found in 15/200 without Marfan. So A might not be correct.

Option B is polymorphism. A polymorphism is a common genetic variant, usually with a frequency over 1% in the population. 7.5% definitely qualifies. Also, since it's synonymous, it's likely a benign polymorphism.

Option C is a variant of unknown significance. But since it's found in a significant number of healthy individuals, it's less likely to be of unknown significance. We can probably classify it as benign.

Option D says it changes the folding of the protein. But since it's a synonymous change, the amino acid doesn't change, so the protein sequence is the same. Folding is determined by the amino acid sequence, so D doesn't make sense.

Wait, but could it be that it's in a regulatory region or something? Well, the question states it's a single nucleotide difference that doesn't change the amino acid. So it's a synonymous variant in the coding region. But even if it were in a non-coding region, the fact that it's common in the population without the disease leans towards it being a polymorphism.

So putting it all together. The change is a polymorphism because it's common and doesn't cause a change in the amino acid. Plus, the mother doesn't have the disease, and the daughter's symptoms might be due to another reason, or perhaps the variant isn't the cause. Wait, but the daughter does have symptoms that point towards Marfan. Hmm. But the FBN1 test was negative for a causative mutationâ€”they only found this synonymous change. So maybe she has another mutation elsewhere, or perhaps it's a different condition. Or maybe the family has a benign variant that doesn't cause disease.

So the question is about the variant they found. The fact that it's a synonymous change and present in healthy individuals suggests it's not pathogenic. So the best answer is B: it's a polymorphism.

The question involves a 10-year-old girl with symptoms suggestive of Marfan syndrome, including tall stature, slender extremities, joint laxity, and a narrow palate with dental crowding. Molecular testing for the FBN1 gene revealed a single nucleotide change that does not alter the amino acid sequence, indicating a synonymous variant. This same variant was found in her mother, who does not have Marfan syndrome, and in 15 out of 200 healthy individuals, suggesting a population frequency of 7.5%. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The variant is unlikely to be a disease-causing mutation because it does not change the amino acid and is common in healthy individuals. This makes it improbable that it is pathogenic in the patient or her mother.
- **Option B**: A polymorphism is a common genetic variant, typically with a frequency over 1% in the population. Since this variant is found in 7.5% of healthy individuals and is synonymous, it fits the definition of a polymorphism.
- **Option C**: A variant of unknown significance (VUS) is typically used when the clinical significance of a genetic change is unclear. However, the high frequency of this variant in healthy individuals and its lack of amino acid alteration make it unlikely to be a VUS.
- **Option D**: The variant does not alter the amino acid sequence, so it is unlikely to affect protein folding, which is determined by the amino acid sequence.

Given the evidence, the variant is best described as a polymorphism.
