Question:

When a swimmer leaves cold water on a warm, breezy day, he experiences a cooling effect. Why?

Options:

A: The cold water causes a decrease in the swimmer's metabolic rate.
B: The swimmer feels cold due to the temperature difference.
C: Evaporation of water from the swimmer's skin cools the body down.
D: The swimmer feels cold due to the wind chill factor.
E: The swimmer's body is adapting to the water temperature after exiting.
F: The water removes heat from the swimmer's body.
G: The sun's rays are less effective on the swimmer's wet skin.
H: The water on the swimmer's body freezes.
I: The breeze makes the swimmer feel cold.
J: The swimmer's body temperature drops below normal.

Okay, so I've got this question here about why a swimmer feels cold when they leave cold water on a warm, breezy day. Hmm, let's think this through. I remember from my science classes that when you get out of the water, especially cold water, you often feel colder than the surrounding air temperature. But why is that?

The question gives me options from A to J. Let me go through each one. 

Option A says the cold water causes a decrease in metabolic rate. I'm not sure about that. I think the body's metabolism might increase when it's cold to generate heat, but I'm not certain. I'll keep that in mind but maybe come back to it.

Option B is about the swimmer feeling cold because of the temperature difference. That makes some sense, but it's a bit vague. The water is cold, so getting out into warmer air should make a difference. But why would they feel colder than the air temp? Maybe it's not just the difference but something else happening.

Option C suggests evaporation of water cools the body. Oh wait, evaporation has a cooling effect because it takes heat away from the body. So when the swimmer comes out wet, the water evaporates, which cools them down. That sounds familiar. I think this is related to the concept of latent heat loss. So this might be the right answer.

Option D mentions wind chill factor. Wind chill is about how wind makes the air feel colder than it actually is. So on a breezy day, the moving air would increase the rate of cooling. But is that the main reason here, or is it more about the evaporation? I'm a bit confused between C and D.

Option E says the body adapts to the water temp after exiting. Not sure about that. When you get out, your body starts to warm up, but that doesn't explain the cooling effect immediately upon leaving.

Option F says water removes heat from the body. That's true when you're in the water because water conducts heat away faster than air. But once you're out, the water on your skin is what's left. So F is more about being in the water, not after exiting.

Option G claims sun's rays are less effective on wet skin. I don't think that's right. The sun should still warm you, but if you're wet, maybe evaporation is countering that. But the question is about why you feel cold, so G might not be the main reason.

Option H says water freezes on the body. That's only if the temperature is below freezing, which isn't the case here. It's a warm, breezy day, so H is out.

Option I states the breeze makes the swimmer feel cold. That's related to wind chill (option D). But is it the wind itself, or the increased evaporation because of the wind? I think it's the latter. The breeze would make the evaporation happen faster, thus cooling more.

Option J says the swimmer's body temp drops below normal. That's hypothermia, which might not be the case unless the water was extremely cold. The question doesn't say that, just that it's cold water.

So putting it together: When the swimmer exits the cold water, they're wet. The water on their skin evaporates. Evaporation requires energy (heat) from the body, cooling it down. The breeze would enhance this effect by moving the moist air away, allowing more evaporation. So the main reason is the evaporation (C), and the wind contributes by increasing the rate (which ties into D). Wait, but the question is asking why they experience a cooling effect. So is it evaporation or wind chill?

Alternatively, wind chill is more about the perception of cold due to wind, but the actual cooling is from the evaporation. So in this scenario, the primary cooling effect is because of the evaporation of water from the skin, which is option C. The breeze (option I or D) might make it feel worse, but the underlying reason is evaporation.

So the correct answer should be C. Evaporation of water from the swimmer's skin cools the body down.

When a swimmer leaves cold water on a warm, breezy day, the cooling effect they experience is primarily due to the evaporation of water from their skin. Evaporation is a process that requires energy, which is drawn from the body in the form of heat, thereby cooling it down. While the breeze can enhance this effect by increasing the rate of evaporation, the fundamental reason for the cooling is the evaporation itself, not just the wind or temperature difference.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Cold water does not decrease metabolic rate; instead, the body may increase metabolism to generate heat.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While temperature difference plays a role, it does not explain the cooling effect experienced after exiting the water.
- **Option C**: Correct. Evaporation of water from the skin is the primary mechanism for cooling.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Wind chill contributes to the perception of cold but is not the main cause of cooling.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The body does not adapt to water temperature after exiting in a way that explains the cooling effect.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. This applies to heat loss while in the water, not after exiting.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The sun's rays are not less effective on wet skin; evaporation counteracts warming.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Freezing does not occur on a warm day.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The breeze enhances cooling but is not the primary cause.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Body temperature does not necessarily drop below normal in this scenario.

The correct answer is **C**. Evaporation of water from the swimmer's skin cools the body down.
