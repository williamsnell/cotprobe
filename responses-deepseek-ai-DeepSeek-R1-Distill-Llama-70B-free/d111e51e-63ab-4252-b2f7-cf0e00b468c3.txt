Okay, so I've got this question here about an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. Hmm, I need to figure out which term fits best. Let me think through this step by step.

The question mentions that this ratio has become a hot topic lately because of work intensification and technological changes. I remember that work-life balance is a common term people use when talking about how much time they spend at work versus their personal life. Yeah, that makes sense because with technology, like emails and remote work, the lines between work and personal time can blur a lot.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A is work-leisure ratio. Leisure is more about free time for fun, but the question is broader, including all non-work activities, not just leisure. So maybe not A.

Option B is employee engagement. That's more about how involved and committed employees are to their work, not about the balance between work and personal life. So B doesn't fit.

Option C is work-health balance. That sounds like it's specifically about health, maybe balancing work demands with health needs. But the question is more general, about all non-work activities, not just health. So C might not be the best fit.

Option D is work-stress balance. That's about managing stress from work, but again, it's a bit narrow. The question is about the overall ratio, not just stress.

Option E is workload management. That's about handling the amount of work you have, maybe time management, but not the balance between work and non-work time.

Option F is work-life balance. Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. It's the balance between work and personal life, which includes family, hobbies, rest, etc. This term is widely used and fits the context of the question.

Option G is presenteeism. That refers to being present at work but not being productive, maybe because of illness. Not related to the balance between work and personal activities.

Option H is job satisfaction. That's about how happy someone is with their job, not about the time distribution between work and other areas.

Option I is work-play balance. Play is a subset of non-work activities, but the term isn't as commonly used as work-life balance, and it doesn't cover all aspects like family time or self-care.

Option J is absenteeism, which is about not showing up to work, so it's the opposite of what the question is asking.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F: Work-life balance.

The correct answer is F: Work-life balance. This term refers to the balance between work-related activities and personal life, encompassing all non-work aspects such as family, leisure, and self-care. It has become increasingly relevant due to factors like work intensification and technological advancements that blur the lines between work and personal time.

Answer: F
