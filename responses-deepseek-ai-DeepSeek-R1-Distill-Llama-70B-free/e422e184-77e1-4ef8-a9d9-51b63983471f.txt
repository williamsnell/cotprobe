Question:

Forced convective heat transfer occurs when water is flowing at a rate of 1.27 ft^3/hr through a pipe, 0.0492 ft dia and 3.28 ft long, at 140°F. The temperature of water at the inlet and outlet are 68°F and 86°F, respectively. Assuming laminar flow, calculate the heat transfer coefficient by a) Sieder and Tate's formula, and b) Hausen's formula.

Options:

A: Sieder and Tate's formula: 70.50 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F, Hausen's formula: 45.66 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
B: Sieder and Tate's formula: 65.73 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F, Hausen's formula: 40.66 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
C: Sieder and Tate's formula: 64.73 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F, Hausen's formula: 49.66 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
D: Sieder and Tate's formula: 60.73 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F, Hausen's formula: 52.66 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F

Okay, so I have this problem about forced convective heat transfer, and I need to calculate the heat transfer coefficient using two different formulas: Sieder and Tate's and Hausen's. Hmm, I remember that these are both correlations used for laminar flow in pipes. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas and the conditions under which they're applied.

First, let me jot down the given data to keep things clear:

- Volumetric flow rate (Q) = 1.27 ft³/hr
- Pipe diameter (d) = 0.0492 ft
- Pipe length (L) = 3.28 ft
- Temperature of water at inlet (T_in) = 68°F
- Temperature at outlet (T_out) = 86°F
- The water is flowing through the pipe, and it's laminar flow, so Reynolds number is less than 2300. I think both formulas apply to laminar flow, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, I need to calculate the heat transfer coefficient (h) using both formulas. So I'll probably need to find the Reynolds number, Prandtl number, and maybe the Graetz number or something like that.

Let me recall the Sieder and Tate formula. I think it's something like Nu = 0.027 Re Pr^(1/3) (μ/μ_wall)^(0.14), but wait, is that right? Or maybe it's Nu = 0.027 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33 (μ/μ_wall)^0.14. No, wait, I think for laminar flow in pipes with uniform heat flux, Sieder and Tate's correlation is Nu = 0.027 Re Pr^(1/3) (μ/μ_wall)^0.14, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, I think the exponent for Re is 0.8, but that's more for turbulent flow, isn't it? No, wait, in laminar flow, maybe it's different.

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, in the problem statement, I can't access any references, so I'll have to rely on my memory. Okay, Sieder and Tate's formula for laminar flow in a pipe with constant wall temperature is Nu = 0.027 Re Pr^(1/3) (μ/μ_wall)^(0.14). Or was it 0.116 Re^(0.5) Pr^(1/3) (μ/μ_wall)^(0.14)? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the Hausen formula too.

Hausen's formula, if I remember correctly, is for laminar flow in pipes and is given by Nu = 0.116 (Re Pr (d/L) )^(1/3) (1 + (d/L)^(2/3)) ). Or wait, maybe it's something like Nu = (3.657 + (0.0668 Re Pr d/L)) / (1 + (0.0468 Re Pr d/L)^0.5)) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up different forms.

Wait, I think Hausen's formula for laminar flow with uniform wall temperature is Nu = 0.116 (Re Pr d/L)^(1/3) [1 + (d/L)^(2/3)]). Or maybe it's 0.116 (Re Pr (d/L))^(1/3) times (1 + (d/L)^(2/3)). I'm a bit unsure, but perhaps I can work it out.

Wait, another thought: Both formulas require the Reynolds number and Prandtl number. So I need to compute Re and Pr.

Let me compute the necessary properties of water. But wait, the temperature of the water is changing from 68°F to 86°F. So the properties are going to be somewhere between those temperatures. Maybe I should calculate the bulk temperature. Since the heat transfer is happening, the fluid is heated, so the average bulk temperature would be (T_in + T_out)/2. So average T is (68 + 86)/2 = 77°F.

Wait, 77°F, which is about 298.7 K. But I need properties of water at this temperature. Let me list them:

At 77°F (approximately 25°C), the properties of water are approximately:

- Density (rho) ≈ 62.2 lbm/ft³ (since at 70°F, it's around 62.3 lbm/ft³)
- Specific heat (c_p) ≈ 1.0 Btu/lbm-°F (approximate for water around this temp)
- Viscosity (mu) ≈ 2.14 x 10^-5 lbm-ft/hr (since at 70°F, it's about 2.14e-5)
- Thermal conductivity (k) ≈ 0.359 W/m-K, but wait, better to convert units. Alternatively, in English units, it's about 0.359 Btu-in/hr-ft²-°F. Wait, I think 1 W/m·K is approximately 0.5778 Btu-in/hr-ft²-°F. So 0.359 * 0.5778 ≈ 0.2075 Btu-in/hr-ft²-°F. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the thermal conductivity in Btu/hr-ft-°F. Oh wait, I'm getting confused with the units. Let me think again.

Wait, I might have the thermal conductivity wrong. Maybe I should think in terms of Btu/hr-ft-°F. Let me see: At 77°F, the thermal conductivity of water is approximately 0.359 W/m·K. To convert W/m·K to Btu·in/hr·ft²·°F, since 1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr, 1 m = 39.37 in, 1 K = 1 °F in terms of intervals.

So, 0.359 W/m·K = 0.359 * (3.41214 Btu/hr) / ( (1 m) / (1 K) ) → but wait, the unit conversion is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, 1 W/m·K = (1 W/(m·K)) * (1 m = 3.2808 ft) → so 1 W/(m·K) = 0.0929 ft·W/(m²·K). Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to use the conversion factor. I think that 1 W/m·K is equal to approximately 0.5778 Btu·in/hr·ft²·°F. So 0.359 W/m·K would be 0.359 * 0.5778 ≈ 0.2075 Btu·in/hr·ft²·°F. Wait, but wait, units don't quite match. Because, in English units, thermal conductivity is often expressed as Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, I'll try again. The thermal conductivity k is given in W/m·K. To convert to Btu·in/hr·ft²·°F:

We can use the conversion factor: 1 W/m·K = 0.001935 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, maybe that's the correct factor.

Wait, let me check the conversion factors:

1 W/(m·K) = (1 J/s)/(m·K) = (1 Btu/778.169 ft·lb_f/s²) * etc. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to just look up the value of k for water in English units at 77°F.

Alternatively, maybe I can find that at 77°F, the thermal conductivity (k) of water is approximately 0.368 Btu/(hr·ft·°F). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should proceed with the values I have and check the calculations.

Wait, maybe I can find the Prandtl number, which is Pr = (mu * c_p)/k. So I'll need mu, c_p, and k.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's compute the volumetric flow rate Q = 1.27 ft³/hr.

The pipe diameter d = 0.0492 ft, so the cross-sectional area A = π*(d/2)^2 = π*(0.0492/2)^2.

Let me calculate A:

d = 0.0492 ft → radius r = d/2 = 0.0246 ft.

A = π * r² ≈ 3.1416 * (0.0246)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.000605 ≈ 0.001902 ft².

So the flow velocity u can be found by Q = u * A → u = Q/A.

u = 1.27 ft³/hr / 0.001902 ft² ≈ 667.39 ft/hr.

Wait, 1.27 divided by 0.001902 is approximately 667.39 ft/hr.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check the calculation again.

1.27 / 0.001902 = let's see, 0.001902 is about 1.902e-3. So 1.27 / 1.902e-3 = approx 1.27 / 0.001902.

Let me compute:

0.001902 * 667 = 0.001902 * 600 = 1.1412; 0.001902 * 67 = approx 0.1274 → total about 1.1412 + 0.1274 = 1.2686, which is close to 1.27. So yes, u ≈ 667 ft/hr.

Wait, but that's 667 ft/hr, which is like 114 ft per minute, which might be 1.9 ft per second? Because 667 ft/hr ÷ 3600 s/hr ≈ 0.185 ft/s, which is about 0.0566 m/s. That seems reasonable for a pipe of that diameter, but I'm not sure. Anyway, moving on.

Now, to compute the Reynolds number, Re = (rho * u * d)/mu.

I need the density of water at 77°F. Let me recall that at 70°F, it's about 62.3 lbm/ft³, and at 77°F, it's a bit less, maybe 62.2 lbm/ft³. Let's take rho = 62.2 lbm/ft³.

Viscosity mu at 77°F is approximately 2.14e-5 lbm-ft/hr. Wait, that's in lbm-ft units. Let me double-check: Yes, dynamic viscosity mu for water at 70°F is about 2.14 x 10^-5 lbm-ft/hr.

So, Re = (rho * u * d) / mu.

Plugging in the numbers:

rho = 62.2 lbm/ft³
u = 667.39 ft/hr
d = 0.0492 ft
mu = 2.14e-5 lbm-ft/hr

So Re = (62.2 * 667.39 * 0.0492) / (2.14e-5)

Let me compute numerator first:

62.2 * 667.39 = approx 62.2 * 667 ≈ 62.2 * 600 = 37,320; 62.2 * 67 ≈ 4,170 → total around 41,490.

Then, 41,490 * 0.0492 ≈ let's compute 41,490 * 0.05 = 2,074.5, minus 41,490 * 0.0008 = approx 33.192 → about 2,074.5 - 33.192 = 2,041.308.

So numerator ≈ 2,041.308 lbm·ft²/hr³ (?). Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the units.

Wait, no, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 62.2 * 667.39 = let's compute that:

62.2 * 600 = 37,320.

62.2 * 67.39 = let's compute 62.2 * 60 = 3,732; 62.2 * 7.39 ≈ 62.2 *7 = 435.4; 62.2 * 0.39 ≈ 24.258 → 435.4 +24.258 ≈ 459.658 → so 3,732 + 459.658 = 4,191.658.

So 62.2 * 667.39 ≈ 37,320 + 4,191.658 = 41,511.658 lbm·ft/hr².

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, Re is (rho * u * d)/mu, so the units for Re would be (lbm/ft³) * (ft/hr) * ft → (lbm/ft³ * ft²/hr) → (lbm/(ft·hr)) → divided by mu in lbm-ft/hr → so (lbm/(ft·hr)) / (lbm-ft/hr) ) → 1/ft²? Hmm, no, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps better to proceed numerically.

Wait, maybe I should calculate 62.2 * 667.39 = 62.2 * 667.39.

Let me compute 62 * 667.39 = approx 62 * 600 = 37,200; 62 * 67.39 ≈ 62*60=3,720; 62*7.39≈457.58 → total 3,720 + 457.58 = 4,177.58 → so 37,200 + 4,177.58 ≈ 41,377.58.

Then, 0.2 * 667.39 = 133.478 → 62.2 * 667.39 ≈ 41,377.58 + 133.478 ≈ 41,511.058 lbm/ft²·hr.

Then multiply by d = 0.0492 ft: 41,511.058 * 0.0492 ≈ Let's compute 41,511 * 0.05 = 2,075.55, minus 41,511 * 0.0008 = approx 33.2088 → so 2,075.55 - 33.2088 ≈ 2,042.34 lbm·ft/hr.

Now, divide by mu = 2.14e-5 lbm-ft/hr:

Re = 2,042.34 / (2.14e-5) ≈ 2,042.34 / 0.0000214 ≈ Let's compute 2,042.34 / 0.0000214.

Divide 2,042.34 by 2.14e-5:

2,042.34 ÷ 0.0000214 = 2,042.34 * (1 / 0.0000214) ≈ 2,042.34 * 46,729.47 ≈ Let me compute that.

2,042.34 * 46,729.47 → Let's approximate.

2,000 * 46,729.47 ≈ 93,458,940.

42.34 * 46,729.47 ≈ Let's compute 40 * 46,729.47 ≈ 1,869,179.

2.34 * 46,729.47 ≈ approx 109,400.

So total approx 93,458,940 + 1,869,179 = 95,328,119 + 109,400 ≈ 95,437,519.

So Re ≈ 95,437,519. That's way higher than 2,300, which is the limit for laminar flow. But wait, the problem states that it's laminar flow, so this can't be right. There must be a mistake in my calculations.

Ah, wait, no! Because the units are in feet and hours, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. The viscosity mu is given in lbm-ft/hr units. Let me double-check the formula for Reynolds number in English units.

Reynolds number in English units is calculated as Re = (rho * u * d) / mu, where rho is in lbm/ft³, u in ft/s, d in ft, and mu in lbm-ft/hr.

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the problem is that the units for velocity are in ft/hr, which is a very small unit. So perhaps I should convert velocity to ft/s to make the units work out.

Wait, velocity u was calculated as 667.39 ft/hr. Let me convert that to ft/s: 667.39 / 3600 ≈ 0.185 ft/s.

That makes more sense. So u = 0.185 ft/s.

Now, let's recalculate Re with u in ft/s.

Re = (rho * u * d) / mu.

But wait, mu is in lbm-ft/hr, so let's make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, let's check the units:

rho: lbm/ft³
u: ft/s
d: ft
mu: lbm-ft/hr

So Re's units would be (lbm/ft³) * (ft/s) * ft / (lbm-ft/hr) ) → (lbm * ft/s * ft²) ) / (lbm-ft³ * lbm-ft/hr) ) → Hmm, perhaps it's easier to just recalculate Re with correct unit conversions.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should use the formula with all units converted to lbm, ft, hr, and °F.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using u in ft/hr earlier. Let me recalculate u in ft/s.

u = 667.39 ft/hr → 667.39 / 3600 ≈ 0.185 ft/s.

Now, Re = (rho * u * d) / mu.

rho = 62.2 lbm/ft³

u = 0.185 ft/s

d = 0.0492 ft

mu = 2.14e-5 lbm-ft/hr.

Wait, but the units for mu are lbm-ft/hr. Let me see:

The units for Re should be dimensionless. Let's see:

rho (lbm/ft³) * u (ft/s) * d (ft) → (lbm/ft³) * (ft/s) * ft → (lbm/ft³) * ft²/s → lbm/(ft·s).

Divide by mu (lbm-ft/hr) → (lbm/(ft·s)) / (lbm-ft/hr) ) → (1/(ft·s)) / (ft/hr) ) → (hr/(ft²·s)). Hmm, that doesn't seem right. I must be making a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, maybe I should convert mu to lbm-ft/s units. Since 1 hour = 3600
