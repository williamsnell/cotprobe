Question:

Calculate the Gross Domestic Product using the total expenditure approach:
Consumption Expenditures | $500 billion
Wages and salaries | $400 billion
(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures | $80 billion
Government Expenditures | $100 billion
Taxes | $70 billion
Imports | $50 billion
Exports | $30 billion
What is the GDP (in billions)?

Options:

A: 700
B: 730
C: 710
D: 760
E: 640
F: 680
G: 650
H: 720
I: 750
J: 660

Okay, so I need to compute the GDP using the total expenditure approach. Hmm, I remember that the formula for GDP using expenditures is GDP = C + I + G + (X - M). Wait, let me make sure I get that right. Oh right, it's Consumption (C) plus Investment (I) plus Government Spending (G) plus Exports (X) minus Imports (M).

Looking at the data provided:

Consumption Expenditures are $500 billion. So that's C = 500.

Investments Expenditures are $80 billion. So I = 80.

Government Expenditures are $100 billion. G = 100.

Exports are $30 billion, so X = 30. Imports are $50 billion, so M = 50.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused about whether to subtract imports or add net exports. Oh right, because when calculating GDP using expenditure approach, imports are subtracted because they're part of the expenditures but not part of domestic production.

So putting it all together, the formula is: GDP = C + I + G + X - M.

Let me plug in the numbers:

500 (C) + 80 (I) + 100 (G) + 30 (X) - 50 (M).

Calculating that step by step:

500 + 80 = 580.

580 + 100 = 680.

680 + 30 = 710.

710 - 50 = 660.

Wait, that gives me 660. Let me check the options. Option J is 660. But wait, I think I might have missed something. Oh wait, the data given also includes Wages and salaries as $400 billion and taxes as $70 billion. Hmm, do those numbers factor into this calculation?

Wait a second, the total expenditure approach doesn't directly use Wages and Salaries or Taxes. Because the expenditure approach adds up the spending by households, businesses, government, and foreigners. So the initial calculation I did seems correct.

Wait but sometimes when people calculate GDP using the income approach, they use Wages and Salaries plus other incomes, but that's a different approach. Since the question specifically says to use the expenditure approach, I don't think I need to consider those numbers.

So my calculation was 660, which is option J.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Yes, C + I + G + X - M. So 500 +80+100+30=710, minus 50 is 660. So answer should be option J.

To calculate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using the total expenditure approach, the formula is:

\[
GDP = C + I + G + X - M
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = Consumption Expenditures = $500 billion  
- \( I \) = Gross Private Investment Expenditures = $80 billion  
- \( G \) = Government Expenditures = $100 billion  
- \( X \) = Exports = $30 billion  
- \( M \) = Imports = $50 billion  

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
GDP = 500 + 80 + 100 + 30 - 50
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
\[
500 + 80 = 580
\]
\[
580 + 100 = 680
\]
\[
680 + 30 = 710
\]
\[
710 - 50 = 660
\]

Thus, the GDP is $660 billion. The values for Wages and Salaries ($400 billion) and Taxes ($70 billion) are not directly relevant to the expenditure approach and are therefore not included in this calculation.

The correct answer is **J: 660**.
