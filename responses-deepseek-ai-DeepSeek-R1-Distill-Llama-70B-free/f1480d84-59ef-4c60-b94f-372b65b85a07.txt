Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about rate laws and stoichiometric coefficients. Hmm, I remember that the rate law is an expression that relates the rate of a reaction to the concentrations of the reactants. But wait, when exactly can we use the stoichiometric coefficients directly in the rate law?

I think it's something about elementary reactions. Oh right, for elementary processes, the rate law can be written using the stoichiometric coefficients as the orders. Like, if the reaction is A + B â†’ products, and it's an elementary process, then the rate would be first order in A and first order in B, so rate = k[A][B].

But what about non-elementary reactions? I remember that for those, the rate law doesn't directly use the stoichiometric coefficients. Those reactions might have mechanisms with multiple steps, and the overall rate law is determined experimentally. So the coefficients in the rate law wouldn't necessarily match the stoichiometric ones.

Looking at the options: the question asks which reactions can have their rate laws written using the stoichiometric coefficients. Option B is Elementary processes, which I think is correct. The other options are various types of reactions like redox, dissolution, polymerization, etc. I don't think those can use stoichiometric coefficients in their rate laws unless they're elementary, which they probably aren't.

Wait, wait. Are there any exceptions? Like, maybe some specific reactions where even if they aren't elementary, the rate law coincidentally uses the coefficients? I don't think so. The rule is pretty clear that only elementary steps can directly use the coefficients for the rate law.

So the correct answer should be option B: Elementary processes.

The rate law can be written using stoichiometric coefficients only for elementary processes. This is because, in elementary reactions, the rate law directly corresponds to the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants, as the reaction occurs in a single step. For non-elementary reactions, such as those in options A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J, the rate law is determined experimentally and does not necessarily align with the stoichiometric coefficients. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B
