Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, so I need to figure out what the Winter King did based on this song. Let me read through the song again and see what clues I can pick up.

The song starts by shaming the Winter King, saying "Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King! What's this that you have done? Is 't not a very naughty thing To snatch the kaiser's crown?" Snatching the kaiser's crown sounds like stealing or taking the crown, which would be a significant action. So that might point towards option C, which says he stole the crown from the kaiser.

Then the song says he'll have to stay away from Rhine and Prague. Those places are associated with Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire, I think. So maybe he was ruler of Bohemia but had to leave. It also mentions that Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king. So the Winter King was probably challenging Ferdinand's rule.

The next part of the song tells Fritz (I assume that's the Winter King) to go to Ferdinand and beg for pardon. So this implies that the Winter King did something wrong against Ferdinand, like rebelling or taking the crown. It doesn't say he was granted pardon yet, so option D might not be correct. Option H says he rebelled against Ferdinand, which fits because he's being told to go ask for pardon, meaning he opposed Ferdinand.

Looking at the options, option C says he stole the crown from the kaiser. The song does mention snatching the crown, so that's a possibility. But the kaiser (emperor) would be Ferdinand, right? So stealing his crown would mean taking his position, which is rebellion.

So putting it together, the Winter King took the crown (stole it) from Ferdinand, which is an act of rebellion. So looking at the options, both C and H could be correct, but I think the main action is the rebellion. Or maybe the stealing of the crown is the specific act.

Wait, the question is asking which of the following did he do. The options are:

A: Claimed lands for the Church
B: Allied with Ferdinand
C: Stole crown from kaiser
D: Was granted pardon
E: Symbolic figure
F: Folk hero
G: Defended land successfully
H: Rebelled against Ferdinand
I: Gave crown to Ferdinand

The song says he snatched the kaiser's crown, so that's option C. But also, by doing so, he rebelled against Ferdinand, which is option H. So which is it?

Wait, the first verse clearly says he snatched the crown, so C seems correct. But H is about rebelling, which is a broader action. Maybe both are correct, but the question is asking based on the song, which action is described.

The song's first lines are about taking the crown, so the immediate action is stealing the crown. But the context is that he's being scolded and told to go to Ferdinand for pardon, implying that his action was against Ferdinand's rule, hence rebellion.

Hmm, but the question is about what he did. So the specific act was taking the crown, which is option C, but also, that act was rebellion, option H. So which is the better answer?

Looking back at the options, the question is which of the following did the Winter King do. The song explicitly mentions snatching the crown, so that points to C. Rebellion is a consequence of that action, but the action itself is taking the crown.

Wait, but in the song, the Winter King is being told to go to Ferdinand and beg for pardon. So if Ferdinand is the rightful king, then the Winter King must have taken the crown without right, which is both stealing and rebelling.

But the options are separate. So which one is correct based on the song's wording.

The first verse says "snatch the kaiser's crown," so C is directly supported. Rebellion is also supported because he's opposing Ferdinand, but the question is about the specific action.

Alternatively, the question could be interpreted as the main actionâ€”since the song is about him losing and being shamed, maybe the main point is that he rebelled. So perhaps H is the correct answer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The song says that Ferdinand is the lawful king. The Winter King took the crown, which means he took it from Ferdinand. So he must have rebelled against Ferdinand. So that would be option H.

But the first line specifically says he snatched the crown, so that's more specific to option C. So which is it?

Alternatively, maybe the Winter King is Frederick V, who was elected King of Bohemia and took the crown, which was against Ferdinand II, the Holy Roman Emperor. So that was an act of rebellion, so H would be correct.

I think I need to decide between C and H. The song's first stanza clearly says he snatched the crown, so C is about that action. But the broader context is that he rebelled against Ferdinand, which is H.

Looking at the answer options, the question is asking which did he do. So both C and H could be correct, but which is more directly supported by the song.

The first line is about snatching the crown, so C is directly mentioned. Rebellion is implied because he's opposing Ferdinand. But the question is about the action, not the broader context.

Wait, the options are about what he did. So the specific action is stealing the crown, which is C. Rebellion is the result of that action.

But the options are A through J, and I need to pick the best answer.

Alternatively, looking at the song again, it says "snatch the kaiser's crown." The kaiser would be Ferdinand, so taking his crown would mean rebelling against him. So that's the same as H.

Hmm, perhaps H is the better answer because the act of taking the crown was an act of rebellion against Ferdinand.

Wait, but the song's first lines are more about the act of taking the crown. So I'm a bit torn. Maybe I should look for what each option says.

Option C says he stole the crown from the kaiser (Ferdinand). Option H says he rebelled against Ferdinand. Both seem correct, but the song's first lines specifically mention taking the crown, so C is directly supported.

Wait, but the song also says "Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king," implying that the Winter King took the crown, which he wasn't supposed to have. So that's rebellion.

I think the answer is either C or H, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think about the historical context. The Winter King, Frederick V, was the King of Bohemia who was elected after the defenestration of Prague, which was against Ferdinand II. So he took the crown, which was an act of rebellion. So the answer would be H.

But the song explicitly says he snatched the crown, so maybe C is correct. Alternatively, rebelling is the action, and taking the crown is the method.

I think the correct answer is H: Rebelled against King Ferdinand. Because the song is about his actions leading to his downfall, which was rebellion.
</think>

The song explicitly details the Winter King's actions, describing how he "snatch[ed] the kaiser's crown," which directly supports option C. However, the broader context of the song implies that this act of taking the crown was part of a larger rebellion against King Ferdinand, who is described as Bohemia's lawful king. While the specific action of stealing the crown (C) is mentioned, the rebellion (H) is the overarching action that led to the Winter King's shame and downfall. Given the historical context of the Winter King (Frederick V) and his rebellion against Ferdinand II, the most accurate answer is that the Winter King rebelled against King Ferdinand.

Answer: H
