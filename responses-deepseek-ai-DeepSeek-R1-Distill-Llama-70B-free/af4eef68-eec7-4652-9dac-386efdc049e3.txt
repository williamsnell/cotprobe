Okay, so I've got this question about a capitalist market economy. Hmm, let me think. I remember that capitalism is an economic system where private individuals and businesses own the means of production. The key points are private property, free markets, and the profit motive. 

The question asks which statement is most consistent with a capitalist economy. The options are A through D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says that economic resources are allocated according to the decisions of the central bank. Wait, the central bank is more involved in monetary policy, like setting interest rates and managing the money supply. But in capitalism, resource allocation is typically through the market mechanism—supply and demand, not a central authority. So A doesn't sound right for capitalism. Maybe that's more like a centrally planned economy.

Option B: Private property is fundamental to innovation, growth, and trade. Oh yeah, that rings a bell. Capitalism relies heavily on private property rights. People and businesses own resources and can use them to innovate, produce goods, and trade. Without private property, the incentives for investment and innovation might be weaker. So B looks like a strong candidate.

Option C: A central government plans production and distribution. That's more like socialism or communism, where the government controls the economy. Capitalism is the opposite, with minimal government intervention in production and distribution. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Most wages and prices are legally controlled. That sounds like a regulated economy, maybe with lots of government intervention. In capitalism, prices and wages are generally determined by the market forces, not by the government. So D doesn't fit.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be B. It directly ties into the core principles of capitalism—private property driving innovation and economic growth.
