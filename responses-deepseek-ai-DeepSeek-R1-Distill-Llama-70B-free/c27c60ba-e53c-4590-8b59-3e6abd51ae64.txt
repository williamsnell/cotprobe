Question:

What is the 'equitable result' in the law and practice of maritime delimitation?

Options:

A: It is the only method of delimitation that international courts and tribunals follow
B: An equitable result is what a judge or the arbitrator would decide ex aequo et bono, i.e. upon their discretion and in light of what they consider as fair and equitable in a delimitation case
C: It is the end result that all delimitations of areas of continental shelf and EEZ should achieve, after, however, drawing a provisional 'equidistance line' and adjusting the zone in the light of the relevant circumstances and the proportionality test.
D: Achieving an equitable result is an old method of delimitation which is currently not applicable

Alright, so I've got this question about maritime delimitation and the concept of an 'equitable result.' I'm a bit rusty on my international law, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

Okay, first, I remember that maritime delimitation deals with how countries determine their maritime boundaries, especially regarding the continental shelf and exclusive economic zones (EEZ). The law in this area is mainly governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), right?

The question is asking about the 'equitable result' in this context. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A says it's the only method used by international courts. That doesn't sound right. I think there are multiple methods, like the equidistance method, and the equitable result is more of a principle rather than the sole method. So probably A is incorrect.

Option B states that an equitable result is what a judge decides based on fairness, ex aequo et bono. Ex aequo et bono means deciding based on what is fair and just, but I think this is a more general principle. In maritime delimitation, the process usually involves more structured steps, like drawing a provisional equidistance line and then adjusting it based on relevant circumstances. So maybe B is mixing concepts.

Option C says the equitable result is the end goal after drawing a provisional equidistance line and adjusting based on circumstances and proportionality. That rings a bell. I recall that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and tribunals often use the equidistance method as a starting point, but then consider other factors like the presence of islands, geological features, or the proportion of the coastlines to adjust the line to achieve an equitable result. So C seems accurate.

Option D claims it's an old method no longer applicable. That doesn't make sense because the concept of achieving an equitable result is still central in current delimitation cases. It's not outdated.

Putting it all together: The process involves first drawing a provisional line (like equidistance) and then adjusting it for equity. So the correct answer should be C.

The 'equitable result' in maritime delimitation refers to the end goal of achieving a fair and balanced outcome when determining maritime boundaries, particularly for the continental shelf and exclusive economic zones (EEZ). The process typically involves drawing a provisional equidistance line and then adjusting it based on relevant circumstances and the proportionality test to ensure fairness. This approach is widely used by international courts and tribunals, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and remains a cornerstone of current delimitation practice.

- **Option A** is incorrect because the equitable result is not the only method used; it is a principle applied alongside other methods like the equidistance line.
- **Option B** is misleading, as while fairness is central, the process involves more structured steps than mere judicial discretion.
- **Option C** is correct because it accurately describes the process of starting with a provisional line and adjusting it to achieve an equitable result.
- **Option D** is incorrect because the equitable result is not outdated; it remains a key principle in contemporary maritime delimitation.

The correct answer is **C**.
