Okay, so I have this question about who said that "Natural law is based on the nature of man and on his inward need of living in society." The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out who it is. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that natural law is a big concept in philosophy, especially among certain thinkers. Natural law theories often relate to morality and how humans should behave based on their nature. So, who are the key philosophers associated with this?

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Spinoza. I know Spinoza was more into rationalism and pantheism, talking about God or Nature as the same thing. I'm not sure if he's the one who specifically said that about natural law.

Option B: Rousseau. He talked a lot about society and the social contract. His focus was more on how society shapes humans and the general will. Not sure if he's the one for natural law.

Option C: Aristotle. He definitely discussed natural aspects, like the concept of telos, the purpose of things. He believed humans have a natural inclination towards certain behaviors, and that the state is a natural institution. So maybe he's a candidate.

Option D: Kant. Kant's more about moral imperatives and duties, the categorical imperative. His approach is more deontological, not sure if he's the one for this quote.

Option E: Socrates. He was more into ethics and asking questions, but I don't recall him specifically talking about natural law in that way.

Option F: Hobbes. Hobbes talked about the state of nature and the social contract. He believed humans need society because life would be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short without it. But his view was more about self-interest and fear leading to society, not exactly about natural law based on inward need.

Option G: Hugo Grotius. Oh wait, Grotius is a big name in natural law theory. He wrote about the law of war and peace and is considered the father of international law. His ideas were that natural law comes from human nature and the need for society. That sounds very close to the quote.

Option H: Plato. He had ideas about the ideal society and the forms, but I don't think this specific quote is his. More about justice and the republic.

Option I: Descartes. He's known for his rationalism and "I think, therefore I am." Not sure about natural law in this context.

Option J: Locke. Locke discussed natural rights—life, liberty, property. His focus was on individuals and their rights, and how governments derive their power from the consent of the governed. But the quote is about natural law based on the need to live in society, which seems more aligned with someone like Grotius.

So putting it all together, the quote seems to match Hugo Grotius. He emphasized that natural law arises from human nature and the necessity of social life. So the answer should be G.

The quote in question aligns with the philosophical ideas of Hugo Grotius, who is known as the father of international law and a key figure in natural law theory. Grotius emphasized that natural law is derived from human nature and the inherent need for social interaction and societal structure. This matches the quote provided.

Answer: G
