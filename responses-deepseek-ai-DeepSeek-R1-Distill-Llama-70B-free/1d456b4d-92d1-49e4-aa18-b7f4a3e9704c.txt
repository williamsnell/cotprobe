Okay, so I've got this question here about identical twins raised apart and what their differences say about the influence on their behavior. Hmm, I remember from psychology class that twins studies are often used to look at nature versus nurture. Identical twins have the same DNA, right? So if they're raised apart, any differences between them probably come from their environment rather than their genetics.

Wait, the question is asking about the more difference shown by their behavior. So if they behave very differently, what does that imply? It must mean that their environment had a big impact because their genes are the same. So the differences are due to their environments, not their genetics.

Looking at the options, the question is about what the differences are attributed to. So the answer would be their environments. Let me check the options again. Option D is environments, so that's probably the right choice.

Wait, but just to make sure. The question is in the context of behavioral differences. So if twins are raised apart, their different environments would influence their behavior. If they were raised together, shared environment would play a role. But since they're apart, it's the different environments affecting them. So yeah, D makes sense.

I think I've got it. The key here is that identical twins share their genetics, so any differences are environmental. So the answer is D.

The question focuses on the differences in behavior between identical twins raised apart, which helps determine the influence of environmental versus genetic factors. Since identical twins share the same genetic makeup, significant differences in their behavior can primarily be attributed to their environments rather than their genetics. Among the options provided, "environments" (Option D) is the correct choice, as it directly addresses the influence of external factors on their behavior when raised separately.

Answer: D
