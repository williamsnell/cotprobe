Question:

What does it mean if the heritability index for a particular trait ishigh?

Options:

A: The trait will be the same across all individuals regardless of their environment
B: 90% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to environmental factors
C: The trait is entirely determined by environmental factors and has no genetic basis
D: Heritability index indicates that the trait cannot be passed down from generation to generation
E: Heritability index has no connection with genetic factors
F: 70% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to genetic factors
G: The trait is not influenced by any external factors and is solely determined by genetics
H: Heritability index indicates the degree of modifiability of the trait
I: 50% of the variance found in the scores in the population is due to genetic factors and the other 50% to environmental factors
J: The heritability index for the trait is a fixed value and does not vary across populations

Okay, so I've got this question about heritability index and what a high value means. I'm a bit rusty on genetics, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that heritability index is a measure used in genetics to determine how much of the variation in a trait within a population is due to genetic factors. It's often expressed as a percentage, right? So a high heritability index would mean that a large proportion of the trait's variation is genetic.

Wait, but I might be mixing it up. The heritability index is calculated as the ratio of the variance attributable to genetic factors over the total variance. So if the index is high, say 80%, that's 80% genetic influence on the variation observed. But that doesn't mean 80% of the trait is genetic, just 80% of the differences between individuals are due to genetics. So it's about the variation, not the entire trait.

Looking at the options now. Option A says the trait is the same across everyone regardless of environment. That doesn't sound right because even with high heritability, environment can still affect how the genes express. Like, identical twins might have the same genes but different environments could lead to some differences.

Option B says 90% is environmental. Wait, no, high heritability would mean more variance is genetic, so B would be the opposite. So if heritability is high, B is incorrect.

Option C claims the trait is entirely environmental, which contradicts high heritability. So C is wrong.

Option D says the trait can't be passed down. But heritability is about genetics, so if it's high, the trait does have genetic factors and can be inherited. So D is incorrect.

Option E suggests heritability has no connection to genetics. No, that's not right. Heritability is all about the genetic contribution. So E is wrong.

Option F is 70% genetic. So if the heritability is high, say 70%, then yes, 70% of the variance is due to genetics. This sounds correct, but I need to check the other options.

Option G says the trait isn't influenced by external factors. But even with high heritability, environment can still influence it. Like, height is highly heritable, but nutrition (environment) still affects it. So G is incorrect.

Option H says heritability indicates modifiability. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think high heritability might mean it's harder to change the trait through environment because genetics play a bigger role. So H might be the opposite. Or maybe it's about how much the trait can be modified, but I'm not sure. I'll have to think about this more.

Option I is 50-50. That's moderate heritability, not high. So I isn't the right answer here.

Option J says heritability is fixed across populations. I remember that heritability can vary in different environments. For example, in a population with more environmental variation, the heritability might be lower. So J is incorrect.

So going back, the question is about a high heritability index. So the correct answer should link high heritability to a high percentage of variance due to genetics. Looking back, option F says 70% of the variance is genetic. But wait, heritability can be up to 100%, so a high index could be 70% or higher. So F is a possible correct answer.

But I should also consider the other options again. Option H: does heritability indicate modifiability? If a trait has high heritability, it's more influenced by genetics, so perhaps it's less modifiable by environment. I'm not sure what H exactly means. Modifiable might refer to how much the environment can change it. If the trait's variation is mostly genetic, maybe it's harder to change through environment. So H might be incorrect because high heritability would imply less modifiability, not more.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is F: 70% of variance is genetic. But wait, the heritability index can be any high value, not necessarily 70%. So is there an option that says something like a high percentage is genetic? Let me check.

Option F is 70%, which is a high value. So if the heritability index is high, say 70% or 80%, then F would be correct. But the question says "if the heritability index is high," so it doesn't specify a particular number. None of the options state that a high index means a high percentage, except for F, which gives a specific number.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about what a high heritability index means. So the correct answer is that a high proportion of variance is due to genetics. Option F gives a specific number (70%), but the question doesn't give a specific number, so maybe it's looking for the general idea.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's the only option that correctly associates a high heritability with a significant genetic variance proportion. So I'll go with F as the answer.

A high heritability index indicates that a large proportion of the variance in a trait within a population is attributable to genetic factors. This does not mean the trait is entirely genetic or unaffected by the environment, but rather that genetic differences account for most of the observed differences between individuals. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J**: These options either contradict the concept of heritability or misinterpret its meaning. For example, A and G incorrectly suggest that high heritability means the trait is unaffected by the environment, while B and C incorrectly attribute variance to environmental or non-genetic factors. D and E misstate the relationship between heritability and genetics, and J incorrectly claims heritability is fixed across populations. H and I do not align with the concept of high heritability.

- **F**: This option correctly states that 70% of the variance is attributable to genetic factors, which aligns with the interpretation of a high heritability index. While heritability can vary, F appropriately captures the idea that a high heritability index reflects a significant genetic contribution to trait variation.

Thus, the best answer is **F**.
