Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the interest rate on an installment plan for an electric guitar. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on finance calculations, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem says the guitar has a cash value of $90.50. But it's purchased on an installment plan. The down payment is $14.95, and then there are 8 monthly payments of $10 each. I need to find the interest rate.

Hmm, so the total amount paid under the installment plan would be the down payment plus all the monthly payments. Let me calculate that. The down payment is $14.95. Each month, it's $10 for 8 months, so 8 times 10 is 80. Adding the down, 14.95 + 80 gives me $94.95 total paid.

Wait, but the cash value is $90.50. So the difference between what's paid and the cash price must be the interest. So 94.95 minus 90.50 is $4.45. That $4.45 is the total interest paid over the period.

Now, to find the interest rate, I think I need to figure out the rate that corresponds to this interest. Since it's an installment plan, this might be a simple interest calculation, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an amortized loan, but for such a small amount, perhaps the simple interest approach would suffice.

Another thing I remember is that the interest rate is usually calculated on the unpaid balance. So maybe I should consider the initial principal after the down payment. The cash price is $90.50, and the down payment is $14.95, so the principal after the down is 90.50 minus 14.95, which is $75.55. 

Then, the total interest is $4.45, as calculated earlier. So the interest rate can be found using the simple interest formula: I = P * r * t, where I is interest, P is principal, r is rate, and t is time in years.

Wait, but the payments are monthly. So the time period is 8 months. I need to convert that into years for the annual interest rate. So 8 months is 8/12 years, which is approximately 0.6667 years.

Plugging into the formula: 4.45 = 75.55 * r * (8/12). Let me compute the denominator first. 8/12 is 2/3, approximately 0.6667.

So rearranging the formula to solve for r: r = I / (P * t).

So r = 4.45 / (75.55 * 0.6667). Let me compute the denominator first. 75.55 multiplied by 0.6667. Let me do that multiplication.

75.55 * 0.6667 ≈ 75.55 * (2/3) = approximately 50.3667. Because 75.55 divided by 3 is about 25.1833, multiplied by 2 is 50.3666.

So now, r ≈ 4.45 / 50.3667 ≈ 0.0883. To convert that to a percentage, multiply by 100: 8.83%. Hmm, but looking at the answer options, I don't see 8.83%. The closest is option D:9.8% or option J:13.3%.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps the interest isn't simple interest but something else. Maybe it's the effective interest rate considering each payment reduces the principal. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the concept of the time value of money, specifically the present value of an annuity. The present value (PV) would be the cash price, and the payments are an annuity. So the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where PMT is the monthly payment, n is the number of periods, and r is the monthly interest rate.

In this case, the PV is the amount after down payment, which is $75.55. The PMT is $10 per month for 8 months. So let's plug in: 75.55 = 10 * [(1 - (1 + r)^-8)/r].

Now I need to solve for r. This equation can't be solved algebraically easily, so I might need to use trial and error or a financial calculator approach.

Let me try to approximate it. The options given are in the range of about 9.8% to 22.5% annual rates. Since the time here is 8 months, which is less than a year, the monthly rate would be a fraction of the annual rate.

Let me try to find the monthly rate first. Let's denote i as the monthly interest rate. Then the equation is:

75.55 = 10 * [(1 - (1 + i)^-8)/i]

Dividing both sides by 10:

7.555 = (1 - (1 + i)^-8)/i

So (1 - (1 + i)^-8)/i = 7.555

I need to find i such that this equation holds. Let's try plugging in some values.

Option A: 20.3% annual rate. Monthly rate would be 20.3/12 ≈ 1.6917% per month.

Let me compute (1 - (1.016917)^-8)/0.016917.

First, compute (1.016917)^8. Let me calculate step by step:

1.016917^1 = 1.016917

^2 ≈ 1.03406

^3 ≈ 1.05135

^4 ≈ 1.0689

^5 ≈ 1.0867

^6 ≈ 1.1048

^7 ≈ 1.1231

^8 ≈ 1.1417

So (1.016917)^8 ≈ 1.1417. Then (1/(1.1417)) ≈ 0.876.

So 1 - 0.876 = 0.124.

Then 0.124 / 0.016917 ≈ 7.33.

But our target is 7.555. So 7.33 is less than 7.555, which suggests that the monthly rate is a bit lower than 1.6917%. Because a lower rate would give a higher present value factor.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think: a higher discount rate (i) means a lower present value. So if at i=1.6917% per month, the factor is 7.33, which is below 7.555. So to get a higher factor (7.555), the interest rate must be lower.

So let's try a lower i. Let's pick option C: 17.9% annual. So monthly i is 17.9/12 ≈ 1.4917%.

Compute (1.014917)^8.

Compute step by step:

1.014917^1 = 1.014917

^2 ≈ 1.03007

^3 ≈ 1.04547

^4 ≈ 1.06116

^5 ≈ 1.07710

^6 ≈ 1.09338

^7 ≈ 1.10998

^8 ≈ 1.12696

So (1.014917)^8 ≈ 1.12696. 1/1.12696 ≈ 0.887.

1 - 0.887 = 0.113.

0.113 / 0.014917 ≈ 7.57.

Hmm, that's very close to 7.555. So i ≈ 1.4917% per month, which is 17.9% annual. So that would suggest option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier when I tried simple interest, I got around 8.83% annual. But using the present value approach, it's about 17.9%, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The present value of the 8 payments of $10 each at i=1.4917% per month should be $75.55.

Using the present value formula: PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + i)^-n)/i]

So PV =10 * [ (1 - (1.014917)^-8 ) / 0.014917 ]

Compute (1.014917)^-8: 1/(1.014917^8) ≈ 1/1.12696 ≈0.887.

So 1 - 0.887 = 0.113.

0.113 / 0.014917 ≈ 7.57.

So 10 * 7.57 ≈75.70. But our principal after down payment is $75.55. So that's very close, considering rounding. So it's about 17.9% annual rate.

Looking back at the options, yes, option C is 17.9%.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes the interest rate is calculated as (total interest)/cash price * 100, but that doesn't account for time value. So if I do that, 4.45 /90.50 *100 ≈4.92%, which is much lower and not among the choices. So that's probably not the right way.

So the correct approach is to use the present value method, which gives us around 17.9%, so option C.
</think>

To calculate the interest rate for the installment plan, we start by determining the total amount paid under the plan. The down payment is $14.95, and there are 8 monthly payments of $10 each, so the total payment is:

\[
\text{Total Payment} = 14.95 + (8 \times 10) = 94.95 \, \text{\$}.
\]

The cash value of the guitar is $90.50, so the total interest paid is:

\[
\text{Total Interest} = 94.95 - 90.50 = 4.45 \, \text{\$}.
\]

The principal after the down payment is:

\[
\text{Principal} = 90.50 - 14.95 = 75.55 \, \text{\$}.
\]

To find the interest rate, we use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r},
\]

where:
- \( PV = 75.55 \) (the present value, or principal after the down payment),
- \( PMT = 10 \) (the monthly payment),
- \( n = 8 \) (the number of payments),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( r \):

\[
\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-8}}{r} = \frac{75.55}{10} = 7.555.
\]

This equation cannot be solved algebraically and requires trial and error or approximation. Testing the given options:

1. **Option A: 20.3% annual rate**  
   Monthly rate: \( \frac{20.3}{12} \approx 1.6917\% \).  
   Substituting into the formula gives a present value factor less than 7.555, so this rate is too high.

2. **Option C: 17.9% annual rate**  
   Monthly rate: \( \frac{17.9}{12} \approx 1.4917\% \).  
   Substituting into the formula gives a present value factor close to 7.555, making this rate accurate.

Thus, the correct interest rate is approximately **17.9% annual**, corresponding to **Option C**.
