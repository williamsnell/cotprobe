Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the solubility of iodine and finding the equilibrium constant K for the formation of I3-. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the solubility of iodine in pure water is 0.0279 g per 100 g of water. But in a solution that's originally 0.10 M KI, the maximum iodine that can dissolve is 1.14 g per 100 g of solution. And I need to find K for the reaction I2 + I- ⇌ I3^-.

Wait, K here is the equilibrium constant for the formation of triiodide ion (I3^-) from iodine and iodide ions. So the reaction is I2 reacting with I^- to form I3^-.

I remember that when iodine dissolves in water, especially in the presence of iodide ions (like from KI), it forms the triiodide ion. The solubility increases because the I2 can react with I^- to form I3^-, shifting the solubility equilibrium.

Let me start by considering the solubility in pure water. The solubility is 0.0279 g per 100 g of water. I think I need to convert that into molarity. Molar mass of I2 is about 253.8 g/mol. So, moles of I2 in 100g water is 0.0279g / 253.8 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 0.0279 divided by 253.8 equals approximately 0.00011 moles. Since it's per 100g water, which is 0.1 kg. So molarity would be moles per liter. But 100g water is about 0.1 liters. So 0.00011 moles in 0.1 liters is 1.1e-3 M. Hmm, or wait, 0.0279g/(253.8 g/mol) = approx 0.00011 mol in 0.1 kg. So in 1 liter (assuming density of water is 1 kg/L), that's 0.00011 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0011 M. So, I think the solubility of I2 in water is 0.0011 M.

But wait, when I2 dissolves in water, it doesn't just stay as I2. It reacts with water to form some I^- and HOI, but I think in the presence of excess I^-, like from KI, this reaction is more significant: I2 + I^- ⇌ I3^-.

So in pure water, the solubility is low because it's just I2 dissolving, but in KI solution, KI provides a high concentration of I^-, so more I2 can dissolve by forming I3^-.

In this problem, when KI is 0.10 M, the maximum iodine that can dissolve is 1.14 g per 100g solution. Let's convert that into molarity.

1.14 g I2 per 100g solution. Molar mass of I2 is 253.8 g/mol. So moles = 1.14 / 253.8 ≈ 0.004495 mol. Since it's per 100g solution, and solution is mostly water, volume is about 100 mL, so 0.1 L. So molarity is 0.004495 / 0.1 = ~0.04495 M. Let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, 1.14 divided by 253.8 equals approximately 0.004495 moles. And if the solution is 100g, which is about 0.1 kg, but the volume is roughly 0.1 liters. So 0.004495 mol in 0.1 L is 0.04495 M, which is about 0.045 M. So in 0.10 M KI solution, the solubility of I2 is 0.045 M.

But wait, the solution is originally 0.10 M KI, which dissociates completely, so [I^-] initially is 0.10 M. Then I2 is added, and it reacts with I^- to form I3^-.

So, let's think about the equilibrium. The reaction is I2 + I^- ⇌ I3^-.

At equilibrium, let the concentration of I2 be 's', and the concentration of I3^- be 'x'. But wait, actually, the solubility of I2 in this case is s, which is 0.045 M. But wait no, when I2 dissolves in the presence of I^-, it actually forms I3^-.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is to let s be the solubility of I2, which is the maximum amount that can dissolve. So when I2 dissolves, it reacts with I^- from KI to form I3^-.

So, let's denote:

Initial concentrations:
KI is 0.10 M, so [I^-] = 0.10 M.
I2 is s (the solubility), but as it dissolves, it reacts.

The reaction is: I2 + I^- → I3^-.

At equilibrium:

Change:
I2: -s (because it dissolves and reacts)
I^-: -s (because it reacts with I2)
I3^-: +s (formed from the reaction)

Wait, but wait, the initial [I^-] is 0.10 M. So:

At equilibrium:
[I2] = s (because some of it remains, but since it's the maximum solubility, perhaps s is the concentration that remains unreacted? Or maybe I'm mixing concepts here.)

Wait no, when I2 is in solution, it can either stay as I2 or react with I^- to form I3^-.

But in pure water, without I^-, the solubility is s0 = 0.0011 M. But in the presence of I^-, the solubility s is higher.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to consider the solubility in KI solution. Let me define:

Let s be the solubility of I2 in the KI solution, so the concentration of I2 in solution would be s. Then, I2 reacts with I^- to form I3^-.

So the reaction is: I2 + I^- ⇌ I3^-.

The equilibrium concentrations would be:

I2: s (since it's the solubility)
I^-: 0.10 - s (because some reacted to form I3^-)
I3^-: s (because each mole of I2 and I^- forms one mole of I3^-)

Wait, but wait. The initial KI provides 0.10 M I^-. When I2 dissolves, s moles per liter of I2 dissolve, and react with I^- to form s moles per liter of I3^-.

But wait, no: when I2 dissolves, each I2 molecule can react with an I^- to form I3^-. So for each mole of I2 that dissolves, it consumes a mole of I^- and produces a mole of I3^-.

So initial [I^-] = 0.10 M.

After dissolution:

[I2] = s (since it's the solubility)
[I^-] = 0.10 - s (because s moles reacted)
[I3^-] = s (produced)

Wait, but this seems a bit oversimplified. Maybe the K expression can be written as K = [I3^-]/([I2][I^-]).

So using that, K = (s) / (s * (0.10 - s)) )

Wait, but the solubility s in the solution with 0.10 M KI is given as 1.14 g per 100g solution, which we calculated as 0.045 M (0.04495 M). So s is 0.045 M.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = [I3^-]/([I2][I^-]) = (s) / (s * (0.10 - s)) ) = 1/(0.10 - s).

But wait, let me calculate this correctly. Because s is the concentration of I2, and [I^-] is 0.10 - s, and [I3^-] is s.

But wait, that can't be right because if I2 is s, then [I^-] is 0.10 - s, but if s is 0.045, then [I^-] would be 0.10 - 0.045 = 0.055 M.

So K = (0.045) / (0.045 * 0.055) = 0.045 / (0.002475) ≈ 18.18.

Wait, that gives K around 18. But wait, the options are all in the hundreds, like 330, 1200 etc. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait a second. Maybe I misunderstood the setup. Because in pure water, the solubility is 0.0279g/100g H2O, which is 0.0011 M. So in pure water, [I2] is 0.0011 M, and that's when [I^-] is determined by the solubility of I2.

Wait, perhaps in pure water, I2 dissociates a little into I^-.

Wait, but another approach: the solubility equilibrium for I2 in water is I2(s) ⇌ I2(aq). But in the presence of I^-, it can further react: I2(aq) + I^- ⇌ I3^-.

So the total solubility is the sum of I2(aq) and I3^-.

Wait, perhaps the solubility in pure water is the solubility of I2 as I2(aq), which is 0.0011 M. So in pure water, [I2] = 0.0011 M, and [I^-] would be very low due to hydrolysis, but maybe we can neglect it since it's pure water.

But when KI is present, we have a common ion effect, but also the formation of I3^-.

Hmm, perhaps I need to model this using the K expression.

Wait, let me think again. The problem gives the solubility of I2 in 0.10 M KI solution as 1.14g per 100g solution, which is 0.045 M I2. But that's the total I2 that can dissolve, which is the sum of free I2 and I3^-.

Wait, no. Because when I2 dissolves in KI solution, it's consumed to form I3^-.

Wait, the total iodine species in solution would be I2 and I3^-, but perhaps the solubility s is the total amount that can dissolve, which would be the initial I2 plus the formed I3^-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to set up the ICE table correctly.

Let me define:

In the KI solution (0.10 M I^-), we add I2 until it's saturated.

Let s be the solubility of I2 in this solution, which is 0.045 M.

The reaction is I2 + I^- ⇌ I3^-.

At equilibrium:

I2: s - x (but maybe I should model it differently)
Wait, perhaps the initial concentrations are:

[I2] = s (the solubility)
[I^-] = 0.10 M
[I3^-] = 0

Wait, no. Wait, when I2 dissolves, it reacts with I^- to form I3^-.

So, let's let the change be:

I2: starts at 0, then dissolves s amount, but then reacts with I^-.

Wait, perhaps I should let the amount of I2 that reacts be x. So:

I2: starts at 0, dissolves s, so initial I2 is s, but then reacts with x amount, so equilibrium [I2] = s - x.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me think.

When I2 dissolves, it can either stay as I2 or react with I^- to form I3^-.

So, for every mole of I2 that reacts, one mole of I^- is consumed, and one mole of I3^- is formed.

Let's let the amount of I2 that reacts be x. Then:

At equilibrium,

[I2] = s - x (if s is the total dissolved, but this might not be the right way to model it.)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the solubility is s, which is the amount of I2 that can dissolve, but some of that reacts to form I3^-.

So, the total I2 in solution is s, which is present as both I2 and I3^-.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try to represent this with variables.

Let me define:

Initially, before any reaction, [I^-] = 0.10 M (from KI), [I2] = s (the solubility), and [I3^-] = 0.

But as I2 reacts with I^-, some of the I2 and I^- convert into I3^-.

So, let x be the amount of I2 that reacts. Then:

I2: decreases by x → [I2] = s - x
I^-: decreases by x → [I^-] = 0.10 - x
I3^-: increases by x → [I3^-] = x

So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[I2] = s - x
[I^-] = 0.10 - x
[I3^-] = x

But wait, s is the solubility of I2, so the total I2 that can dissolve is s, but part of it has reacted. So the maximum s is when all possible I2 has dissolved, and the reaction has proceeded as far as it can.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct way to model it. Alternatively, maybe s is the concentration of I2 that remains in solution, and the rest has formed I3^-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the total I2 that dissolves is s, which is the sum of unreacted I2 and the I3^- formed.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Let me think about the K expression.

The reaction is I2 + I^- ⇌ I3^-.

So K = [I3^-]/([I2][I^-])

At equilibrium, [I3^-] = x, [I2] = s - x, and [I^-] = 0.10 - x.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach. Let me consider that the solubility s is the total amount of I2 that can dissolve, which includes both the unreacted I2 and the I3^- formed.

Wait, but that's not accurate because I3^- is a separate species.

Alternatively, perhaps the solubility s is the concentration of I2 that remains in solution, and the I3^- concentration is determined by the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the maximum solubility of I2 in the KI solution is s, which is 0.045 M. So the [I2] in solution is s, and the [I3^-] is also formed.

Wait, no, that can't be right because in solution, I2 would react with I^- to form I3^-.

So let me think, when I2 is added to the KI solution, it starts to dissolve, but as it does, it reacts with I^- to form I3^-.

So, the solubility s is the maximum amount that can dissolve, which is determined by the equilibrium.

So, let's let the solubility s be the concentration of I2 that remains in solution. Then, the amount that has reacted is x, forming x concentration of I3^-.

So:

[I2] = s
[I^-] = 0.10 - x
[I3^-] = x

But since each mole of I2 that reacts consumes a mole of I^- and produces a mole of I3^-, the amount x is the moles of I2 that have reacted, so x = [I3^-].

But wait, the total I2 that has dissolved is s (the unreacted) plus the reacted part, which is x. So the total I2 that has dissolved is s (unreacted) plus x (reacted to I3^-).

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum iodine that can dissolve is 1.14g per 100g solution, which is 0.045 M. So that's the total I2 that has dissolved, which includes both the unreacted I2 (s) and the I3^- (x). So s + x = 0.045 M.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should approach this using the solubility data and set up the K expression correctly.

Wait, let me try this approach. The solubility of I2 in 0.10 M KI is 0.045 M. So, in that solution, the concentration of I2 is s = 0.045 M. But wait, that's the total I2 dissolved, which includes both the free I2 and the I3^- formed.

Wait, no. Because when I2 dissolves, it can form I3^- by reacting with I^-.

So, let me define:

Let s be the solubility of I2 in the solution, which is 0.045 M. So, the total I2 that has been dissolved is s, but some of it is in the form of I3^-.

Let x be the concentration of I3^- formed. So, from the reaction, each mole of I2 that forms I3^- consumes a mole of I^-, so:

At equilibrium:

[I2] = s - x (because x moles have reacted)
[I^-] = 0.10 - x (because x moles of I^- have been consumed)
[I3^-] = x

But wait, the solubility s is the total I2 that can dissolve, so s = [I2] + [I3^-] ?

Wait, no. Because I2 can exist as I2 molecules or as part of I3^- ions. So the total iodine from I2 dissolution is s, which is equal to [I2] + [I3^-].

Wait, that's correct because each I3^- ion contains one I2 molecule (well, actually, it's I-I3, but in terms of I2 units, each I3^- comes from one I2 and one I^-).

So, s = [I2] + [I3^-] = (s - x) + x = s. Hmm, that just gives an identity, so that approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating
