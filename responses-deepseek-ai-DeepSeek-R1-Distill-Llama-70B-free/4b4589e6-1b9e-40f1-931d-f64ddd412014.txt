Question:

A defendant was arrested and prosecuted for the crime of false pretenses. At trial, the defendant testified that she prophesied the victim's imminent death. The defendant admitted that she told the victim she could save him if he brought a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief to a ritual. After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?

Options:

A: A juror was overheard discussing the details of the case outside the courtroom during the trial.
B: A juror admitted to having a personal financial interest in the outcome of the case.
C: A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.
D: A juror admitted to having made a decision about the verdict before the trial began.
E: Ajuror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.
F: A juror stated that she didn't believe in the concept of false pretenses, and therefore thought the defendant was not guilty from the start.
G: A juror confessed to having previously known the defendant but did not disclose this during jury selection.
H: A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.
I: A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically regarding the grounds for a new trial based on juror affidavits. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a defendant convicted of false pretenses. She's trying to get a new trial and is using juror affidavits to support her motion. I need to figure out which affidavit would give her the best chance of securing a new trial.

First, I remember that in U.S. law, there's something called the "no-impeachment rule." I think it's from the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 606(b). This rule generally prohibits jurors from testifying about their deliberations or mental processes to impeach the verdict. So, most things that happen during deliberations can't be used to overturn the verdict. But there are exceptions, right?

The exceptions usually include external influences or misconduct by the jurors themselves. So, if a juror was influenced by something outside the trial, like reading about the case in the media, that might be an exception. Or maybe if a juror had a personal bias that affected their decision.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A juror was overheard discussing the case outside the courtroom. I think this could be an issue if it's about discussing with outsiders, but if it's just between jurors, maybe not. But wait, discussing during trial might not be misconduct unless it's with non-jurors.

Option B: A juror had a personal financial interest in the outcome. That sounds like a clear bias. If the juror stood to gain or lose money based on the verdict, that's a conflict of interest. This could definitely be grounds because it's a clear bias affecting impartiality.

Option C: A juror had personal animosity towards the defendant. That's also a bias. If a juror admitted hating the defendant, that could prevent them from being impartial. This might be a good option.

Option D: A juror decided the verdict before trial began. This is about being prejudged. If they made up their mind before hearing the evidence, that's a problem. But I'm not sure if this is an exception to the no-impeachment rule.

Option E: A juror fell asleep during closing argument. That's inattention, which might affect their understanding of the case. But I'm not sure if that's enough for a new trial. It might not meet the threshold of juror misconduct.

Option F: A juror didn't believe in false pretenses concept. So they thought the defendant wasn't guilty from the start. This is more about their opinion on the law, not an external influence or misconduct. I don't think this would be grounds for a new trial.

Option G: A juror knew the defendant but didn't disclose it. This is about concealment during voir dire. If a juror failed to disclose a prior relationship, that could indicate bias. But I'm not sure if the defendant can use an affidavit for this after the trial. Maybe the court could have addressed it during jury selection.

Option H: A juror misunderstood the burden of proof. That's about the juror's understanding of the law. I don't think that's grounds for a new trial because jurors are expected to follow the judge's instructions, but misunderstandings don't necessarily warrant a new trial unless it's part of broader misconduct.

Option I: A juror read a newspaper article about the defendant. That's an external influence. The court specifically instructs jurors not to read about the case. This would be misconduct and an exception to the no-impeachment rule because it's an outside influence that tainted the verdict.

So, considering these, the strongest options are B, C, D, G, I.

Now, let me think about which of these are exceptions to the no-impeachment rule. The rule typically allows testimony about external influences, like a juror being bribed, or doing external research. It also allows for juror misconduct that violates court instructions, like talking to outsiders or reading media about the case.

So, option I is about a juror reading a newspaper article, which is a direct violation of the court's instructions. That would likely be an exception because it's an external influence that could have affected the verdict.

Option B is a personal financial interest, which is a conflict of interest but might be something the juror should have disclosed during voir dire. If they didn't, that's a problem, but using an affidavit to prove it after trialâ€”does that qualify? I think it might, as it's a clear bias.

Option C is about personal animosity. That's also a bias, but I'm not sure if affidavits about a juror's feelings are allowed. Because under the no-impeachment rule, you can't impeach based on a juror's mental state, but if they admitted to having animosity, maybe that's an exception.

Wait, but the no-impeachment rule generally doesn't allow jurors to testify about their thought processes or deliberations. However, if a juror had a personal relationship or a clear bias that they failed to disclose, that might be a different issue.

But in terms of what's presented in the options, the question is which affidavit would most likely grant a new trial. The strongest case would be where the juror was influenced by an external factor, like reading a newspaper article (option I), or had a personal stake in the outcome (option B).

Between B and I, which is more likely to be an exception. The case law I remember, like in Remmer v. United States, where a juror was approached with a bribe, the court allowed the affidavit because it was an external influence. Similarly, if a juror reads about the case, that's an external influence.

So, option I is a clear external influence, making it a strong basis for a new trial.

Another option is B, which is a personal financial interest. That's a conflict of interest, which could be a basis for a new trial because the juror wasn't impartial. But I'm not as certain whether this would fall under an exception to the no-impeachment rule.

Wait, but under Rule 606(b), the exceptions include whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror, or whether the juror became biased. So, a personal financial interest could be seen as a bias.

But I'm trying to think about which of these is more likely to be accepted as a valid ground. I think that external influences (like media) are a clear exception, so option I would be the best basis.

Alternatively, option B could be a valid ground because the juror had a financial interest, which is a clear conflict. But I'm not sure if that's considered an "external influence" or more of a personal bias.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, another angle: The defendant is moving for a new trial based on juror affidavits. The question is which affidavit would most likely provide the basis.

In terms of what the court can consider, external factors like a juror reading about the case (option I) are definitely something the court can act upon because it's a violation of the court's order.

On the other hand, a juror having a personal financial interest (option B) might be a ground for a new trial, but it's possible that the court would have addressed this during voir dire, and the defendant might have had the opportunity to challenge the juror then. However, if the juror didn't disclose it, then it's a different issue. But the affidavit is coming after the trial, so I'm not sure if that's admissible.

Wait, but Rule 606(b) allows testimony about whether a juror was biased, but only if it's based on extrinsic evidence. So, a juror having a financial interest could be extrinsic evidence of bias.

I think both B and I are strong options, but I'm leaning towards I because it's a clear external influence that violates court instructions. Whereas B is more about the juror's internal bias, which might be harder to prove with an affidavit without violating the no-impeachment rule.

Wait, but another thought: The no-impeachment rule allows for affidavits in cases of juror misconduct that could not have been known during voir dire. For example, if a juror had a financial interest that they didn't disclose, that's a failure to answer truthfully during voir dire, which could be grounds for a new trial.

So, both B and I are viable options. But which is more likely to be considered.

In some cases, courts have held that a juror's failure to disclose a personal relationship or interest can be grounds for a new trial. Similarly, a juror being influenced by external information is a clear ground.

But the question is about the best basis. I think the strongest is option I because it's a clear external influence that the court can act upon. Option B is also strong, but perhaps option I is more certain.

Alternatively, another angle: The defendant would have to show that the juror's action affected the verdict. With option I, the juror read about the defendant being involved in similar schemes, which likely prejudiced the defendant. With option B, the financial interest would depend on how it affected the juror's decision.

I think both are good, but I'm more confident about option I.

To determine which affidavit would most likely provide the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial, it is essential to analyze the options in light of the "no-impeachment rule" under Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b). This rule generally prohibits jurors from testifying about their deliberations or mental processes to impeach a verdict, but it allows exceptions for external influences or juror misconduct that could have affected the verdict.

### Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: A juror discussing the case outside the courtroom might constitute misconduct, but if the discussion was only with other jurors, it may not qualify as an exception to the no-impeachment rule. This is less likely to be a strong basis for a new trial.

- **Option B**: A juror with a personal financial interest in the outcome of the case has a clear conflict of interest. This could be grounds for a new trial, as it indicates bias. However, the court might have addressed this during voir dire, and the defendant would need to show that the juror improperly withheld this information.

- **Option C**: A juror admitting personal animosity toward the defendant also indicates bias. While this could be a valid ground, the no-impeachment rule generally restricts testimony about a juror's mental state or feelings unless it involves extrinsic evidence of misconduct.

- **Option D**: A juror deciding the verdict before the trial began suggests prejudice. However, this is more about the juror's mental state, which is typically protected under the no-impeachment rule unless tied to external misconduct.

- **Option E**: A juror falling asleep during closing arguments indicates inattention but does not necessarily rise to the level of misconduct or external influence required for a new trial.

- **Option F**: A juror disagreeing with the concept of false pretenses is a matter of opinion about the law, which does not qualify as grounds for a new trial.

- **Option G**: A juror failing to disclose prior knowledge of the defendant could indicate bias, but this might have been addressable during voir dire. Using an affidavit to prove it after the trial may not be as strong a basis.

- **Option H**: A juror misunderstanding the burden of proof is a common occurrence and does not typically warrant a new trial unless tied to broader misconduct.

- **Option I**: A juror reading a newspaper article about the defendant in violation of court instructions is a clear case of external influence and misconduct. This directly violates the court's orders and could have prejudiced the verdict, making it a strong basis for a new trial.

### Conclusion:

The strongest options are **B** (personal financial interest) and **I** (reading a newspaper article). However, **Option I** is the most likely to succeed because it involves an external influence that violates court instructions, which is a well-established exception to the no-impeachment rule. While **Option B** is also a valid ground, it may be less certain due to the potential for the issue to have been addressed during voir dire. Therefore, **Option I** provides the best basis for securing a new trial.
