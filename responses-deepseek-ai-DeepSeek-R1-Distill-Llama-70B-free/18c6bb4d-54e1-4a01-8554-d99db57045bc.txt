Question:

A teenager shot and killed a man she said tried to attack her as she was walking home from an all night market. The teenager, 18 years old and 6 feet 3 inches tall, said a very short man placed a knife against her throat and unzipped her dress as she was walking down the street. She pulled a gun from her purse and shot him. The man died of a chest wound. Police said the man, who was 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 130 pounds, was an ex-felon, twice convicted of attempted rape. The teenager is charged with the murder of the man, as a result of the above described incident. At trial, the teenager wishes to offer evidence of the fact that the man was previously convicted of attempted rape. The evidence would be

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it could bias the jury against the victim.
B: inadmissible, because the evidence is being used to prove propensity.
C: admissible, as it could be used to establish the teenager's fear of the man.
D: inadmissible, because it violates the Dead Man's Statute.
E: admissible, because it proves the man's disposition to commit rape.
F: admissible, because it supports the teenager's claim of self-defense.
G: admissible, because the victim's prior convictions would be relevant on the issue of the defendant's self-defense.
H: inadmissible, as it breaches the victim's right to a fair trial.
I: inadmissible, as it is irrelevant to the current case.
J: admissible, because it provides a motive for the teenager's actions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully. 

So, there's a teenager who shot and killed a man she claims tried to attack her. She's 18, quite tall—6 feet 3 inches. The man was shorter, 5'5" and 130 pounds, an ex-felon with two convictions for attempted rape. She's charged with murder, and at her trial, she wants to present evidence of the man's prior convictions. The question is whether that evidence is admissible.

Hmm. I remember that in criminal trials, especially in self-defense cases, the defendant might want to introduce the victim's prior bad acts to show that the victim was the aggressor or to support the defendant's reasonable fear. But wait, isn't there a rule against using prior convictions to show propensity? Like, you can't just say someone is guilty because they've done it before. That's what I think FRE 404(b) is about.

FRE 404(b) says that evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts isn't admissible to prove a person's character to show they were disposed to commit the crime. But there are exceptions. One big exception is when the evidence is used for some purpose other than showing propensity, like intent, opportunity, motive, or to establish the absence of mistake or accident. Also, in some cases, the defendant's state of mind might come into play.

In this case, the teenager is claiming self-defense. So, she's arguing that she had a reasonable belief of imminent danger. To establish that, she might need to show that the victim had a history of violent behavior, which would make her fear more reasonable. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the victim's prior crimes can be used for this purpose.

I think the key here is that the prior convictions can be used to show the victim's character, but only if that character trait is relevant to the defendant's state of mind. Oh, but wait—there's another angle. FRE 405 allows for the introduction of specific instances of conduct to prove character if character is an essential element of the charge or claim. In this case, self-defense might involve showing that the victim was aggressive or had a tendency towards violence.

Wait, but another thought: when the defendant is the one claiming self-defense, they can introduce evidence of the victim's violent past to support the reasonableness of their fear. So, maybe that's allowed under an exception to 404(b). But I'm not entirely sure. 

Looking at the options, option G says it's admissible because the victim's prior convictions are relevant to the defendant's self-defense. Option F says it's admissible because it supports the claim of self-defense. Option B says it's inadmissible because it's used for propensity, which I think is the general rule unless an exception applies.

Wait, so if the evidence is being offered to show that the victim was prone to violence, making the defendant's fear reasonable, then it's not being offered to show that the victim was disposed to commit the crime (propensity), but rather to show that the defendant had a reasonable belief. So maybe it's admissible under 404(b)'s exception.

But I'm a bit confused because I remember that some courts have held that prior convictions of the victim can be used in self-defense cases to show the defendant's reasonable apprehension. So in that case, the evidence would be admissible for that purpose.

Looking at the answer options, option G says it's admissible because it's relevant to self-defense. Option F says it supports self-defense. Option B says it's used for propensity, which would make it inadmissible.

Wait, the teenager is the defendant, so she's trying to prove that she acted in self-defense. To do that, she needs to show that she had a reasonable belief that she was in imminent danger. If the victim had a history of attempted rape, that could make her fear more reasonable. So the evidence isn't being used to show that the victim was likely to commit rape again (propensity), but to show that the defendant's belief was reasonable.

So under FRE 404(b), the evidence would be admissible if it's for a purpose other than propensity. So it's not being offered to prove he was disposed to commit rape, but to show that the defendant had a reasonable fear.

Thus, the correct answer would be that it's admissible because it relates to the defendant's state of mind and supports her self-defense claim. So the options would be F, G, or J. 

Looking again, option G says it's admissible because the victim's prior convictions are relevant on the issue of self-defense. Option F says it's admissible because it supports the claim of self-defense. Option J talks about motive, which doesn't seem as relevant here.

So between F and G. I think G is more precise because it's about the relevance to self-defense. But let me think again. The evidence of the victim's prior convictions is being offered to show that the defendant's fear was reasonable. So it's about the defendant's state of mind, not directly about the victim's propensity.

Wait, but wait—under the common law, the admissibility of the victim's prior crimes for the defendant's self-defense is a bit tricky. Some jurisdictions allow it, others don't, depending on whether they follow the majority approach or not. But under FRE, I think it's allowed if it's relevant to the defendant's state of mind.

So the evidence would be admissible, making the correct answer either F or G. Option G says it's relevant on the issue of self-defense, which is spot on. So I think the answer is G.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence regarding the victim's prior convictions for attempted rape in a murder trial where the defendant claims self-defense. The defendant, an 18-year-old woman, shot and killed a man she alleges attacked her. The man, an ex-felon with two prior convictions for attempted rape, was described as short and lightweight. The defendant seeks to introduce evidence of the victim's prior convictions to support her claim of self-defense.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 404(b), evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts is generally inadmissible to prove a person's character or propensity to commit a crime. However, exceptions exist when the evidence serves a purpose other than showing propensity, such as establishing intent, motive, or the defendant's reasonable belief in imminent danger. In this case, the defendant aims to use the victim's prior convictions to demonstrate that her fear was reasonable, thereby supporting her self-defense claim.

Key considerations include:

1. **Propensity vs. Reasonable Fear**: The evidence is not being offered to prove that the victim was disposed to commit rape (propensity) but to show that the defendant had a reasonable belief of imminent danger, which is a valid purpose under FRE 404(b).

2. **Relevance to Self-Defense**: The victim's history of violent behavior is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and the reasonableness of her actions. This aligns with the exception under FRE 404(b) for evidence used to establish the defendant's reasonable apprehension.

3. **Admissibility**: Courts generally allow such evidence in self-defense cases to support the defendant's claim of reasonable fear. Therefore, the evidence is admissible because it is relevant to the issue of self-defense.

Among the options provided, the most accurate answer is that the evidence is admissible because the victim's prior convictions are relevant to the issue of the defendant's self-defense.
