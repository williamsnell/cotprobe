Okay, so I have this problem about finding the thermal conductivity of a plastic. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let me try to work through this.

Alright, the problem says that the plastic is a flat piece with area A = 1 ft² and thickness b = 0.252 inches. It conducts heat at a rate of 3.0 watts under steady state conditions. The temperatures on the two sides are T0 = 24°C and T1 = 26°C. I need to find the thermal conductivity in cal sec⁻¹ cm⁻¹ (°K)⁻¹ at 25°C.

Wait, I remember that thermal conductivity (usually denoted by k or λ) is a measure of a material's ability to conduct heat. The formula I think is Fourier's law, which is Q = (k * A * ΔT) / d, where Q is the heat flux, A is the area, ΔT is the temperature difference, and d is the thickness of the material.

But wait, I have to make sure about the units because the question gives me mixed units. Let me note down all the given data:

- Area A = 1 ft². Oh wait, I'll probably need to convert that to cm² because the final answer is in cm-based units.
- Thickness b = 0.252 inches. I should convert this to centimeters.
- Heat rate Q is 3.0 watts. Watt is a unit of power, which is energy per second. So 1 W = 1 J/s. But since the answer needs to be in calories, I'll have to convert J to calories.
- Temperature difference ΔT is T1 - T0 = 26°C -24°C = 2°C. Since Celsius and Kelvin have the same interval (a change of 1°C is a change of 1 K), ΔT in Kelvin is also 2 K.

Wait, no wait, the formula uses the temperature difference, which is the same in °C and K, because it's a delta. So that's okay.

So, Fourier's Law in steady state is:

Q = (k * A * ΔT) / d

I need to solve for k. Let me rearrange the formula:

k = (Q * d) / (A * ΔT)

But I have to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's think about the units each term is in.

Given:

- Q is in watts (W), which is J/s. Since 1 J = 0.239006 cal (because 1 cal = 4.184 J approximately), I'll need to convert Q from W to cal/s.
- Area A is in ft². I need to convert that to cm².
- d is in inches, so convert to cm.
- ΔT is in °C, but since each degree C is equal to Kelvin in terms of interval, the 2°C is 2 K, so no problem there.

Let's start converting each quantity.

First, Q = 3.0 W. Since 1 W = 1 J/s, Q = 3 J/s.

Convert J to calories: 3 J/s * (1 cal / 4.184 J) ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute that. 3 / 4.184 ≈ 0.717 cal/s. So Q ≈ 0.717 cal/s.

Wait, but wait, 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. So 1 J is approximately 0.239 cal. So 3 J is 3 * 0.239 ≈ 0.717 cal, yes.

So Q ≈ 0.717 cal/s.

Next, area A is 1 ft². I need to convert that to cm². I remember that 1 ft = 30.48 cm, so 1 ft² = (30.48 cm)^2 = 30.48 * 30.48 cm². Let me calculate that.

30.48 * 30.48 = let's approximate. 30^2 is 900, 0.48^2 is about 0.2304, and cross terms 2*30*0.48=28.8. So 900 + 28.8 + 0.2304 = 928.03 cm². So approximately 928.03 cm².

Alternatively, 1 ft² = 929.0304 cm², but I'll use 928.03 for calculation.

So A ≈ 928.03 cm².

Thickness d is 0.252 inches. Convert inches to cm: 1 inch = 2.54 cm, so d = 0.252 * 2.54 cm.

Let me compute that. 0.25 * 2.54 = 0.635 cm, and 0.002 * 2.54 = 0.00508 cm. So total d ≈ 0.635 + 0.00508 = 0.64008 cm. So approximately 0.6401 cm.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately: 0.252 * 2.54.

0.252 * 2.54:

2.54 * 0.2 = 0.508

2.54 * 0.05 = 0.127

2.54 * 0.002 = 0.00508

Adding them: 0.508 + 0.127 = 0.635, plus 0.00508 is 0.64008 cm. So d ≈ 0.6401 cm.

ΔT is 2 °C or 2 K. Since the units in k will be per Kelvin, that's fine.

So now plug all into the formula:

k = (Q * d) / (A * ΔT)

Plugging the numbers:

k = (0.717 cal/s * 0.6401 cm) / (928.03 cm² * 2 K)

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.717 * 0.6401 ≈ ?

0.7 * 0.64 = 0.448. 0.017 * 0.64 ≈ 0.01088. So total approximately 0.448 + 0.01088 = 0.45888.

Wait, more accurately: 0.717 * 0.6401.

Let me compute 0.7 * 0.6401 = 0.44807.

0.017 * 0.6401 = 0.0108817.

Adding them: 0.44807 + 0.0108817 ≈ 0.45895.

So numerator ≈ 0.45895 cal·cm/s.

Denominator: 928.03 cm² * 2 K = 1856.06 cm²·K.

So k = 0.45895 / 1856.06 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 0.45895 / 1856.06.

Hmm, let's see. 1856 is about 1.856e3.

So 0.45895 / 1856.06 ≈ (4.5895e-1) / (1.85606e3) ) ≈ (4.5895 / 1.85606) ) * 1e-4.

Compute 4.5895 / 1.85606.

Well, 1.85606 * 2.47 ≈ 4.589. Let me check:

1.85606 * 2 = 3.71212.

1.85606 * 0.47 = let's compute 1.85606 * 0.4 = 0.742424, and 1.85606 * 0.07 = 0.1299242. So 0.742424 + 0.1299242 ≈ 0.872348.

So 3.71212 + 0.872348 ≈ 4.584468, which is close to 4.5895.

So approximately 2.47. So 4.5895 / 1.85606 ≈ 2.47, so 2.47e-4.

Wait, so k ≈ 2.47e-4 cal sec⁻¹ cm⁻¹ (°K)⁻¹.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: 2.47 × 10⁻⁴ cal sec⁻¹ cm⁻¹ (°K)⁻¹.

But let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

Let me go through each step again.

1. Convert Q from W to cal/s.
3 W = 3 J/s. 1 J = 0.239006 cal. So 3 * 0.239006 ≈ 0.717018 cal/s. That's correct.

2. Convert area from ft² to cm².
1 ft = 30.48 cm. So 1 ft² = (30.48)^2 cm² = 928.9144 cm². I used 928.03 earlier, which is close enough; the exact value is around 928.9144.

3. Convert thickness to cm.
0.252 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 0.64008 cm. Correct.

4. Compute k = (Q * d) / (A * ΔT).
So (0.717018 cal/s * 0.64008 cm) / (928.9144 cm² * 2 K).

Calculate numerator: 0.717018 * 0.64008 ≈ ?

0.7 * 0.64 = 0.448. 0.017018 * 0.64 = 0.0108915. So total ≈ 0.45889.

Denominator: 928.9144 * 2 = 1857.8288.

So 0.45889 / 1857.8288 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division.

1857.8288 = 1.8578288e3.

0.45889 / 1.8578288e3 = (0.45889 / 1.8578288) ) * 1e-3.

Compute 0.45889 / 1.8578288.

Let me calculate:

1.8578288 × 0.247 = ?

0.2 *1.8578288= 0.37156576

0.04 *1.8578288= 0.074313952

0.007 *1.8578288≈ 0.0130548

Adding: 0.37156576 + 0.074313952 = 0.44587971 + 0.0130548 ≈ 0.4589345.

Which is very close to 0.45889. So yes, 0.247.

So 0.247e-3 = 2.47e-4.

So k ≈ 2.47e-4 cal sec⁻¹ cm⁻¹ K⁻¹. So option B is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is same value but with °C instead of K. But since K and °C have same size degrees, the numerical value is same, but the unit in the answer should be per Kelvin. So option B is correct.

To determine the thermal conductivity \( k \) of the plastic, we use Fourier's law of heat conduction:

\[
Q = \frac{k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T}{d}
\]

Rearranging for \( k \):

\[
k = \frac{Q \cdot d}{A \cdot \Delta T}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( Q = 3.0 \, \text{W} = 3.0 \, \text{J/s} \)
- Convert \( Q \) to calories: \( 1 \, \text{J} = 0.239006 \, \text{cal} \), so \( Q = 3.0 \cdot 0.239006 \approx 0.717 \, \text{cal/s} \).
- \( A = 1 \, \text{ft}^2 = 928.9144 \, \text{cm}^2 \) (conversion: \( 1 \, \text{ft} = 30.48 \, \text{cm} \)).
- \( d = 0.252 \, \text{inches} = 0.64008 \, \text{cm} \) (conversion: \( 1 \, \text{inch} = 2.54 \, \text{cm} \)).
- \( \Delta T = T_1 - T_0 = 26^\circ \text{C} - 24^\circ \text{C} = 2 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta T \) in \(^\circ \text{C}\) and \( \text{K}\) are equivalent).

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
k = \frac{(0.717 \, \text{cal/s}) \cdot (0.64008 \, \text{cm})}{(928.9144 \, \text{cm}^2) \cdot (2 \, \text{K})}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \( 0.717 \cdot 0.64008 \approx 0.45895 \, \text{cal·cm/s} \).
2. **Denominator**: \( 928.9144 \cdot 2 = 1857.8288 \, \text{cm}^2·\text{K} \).
3. **Division**: \( \frac{0.45895}{1857.8288} \approx 2.47 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cal·s}^{-1}·\text{cm}^{-1}·\text{K}^{-1} \).

### Final Answer:
The thermal conductivity of the plastic is approximately \( 2.47 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cal·s}^{-1}·\text{cm}^{-1}·\text{K}^{-1} \). Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is:

**B: \( 2.47 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cal·s}^{-1}·\text{cm}^{-1}·\text{K}^{-1} \)**.
