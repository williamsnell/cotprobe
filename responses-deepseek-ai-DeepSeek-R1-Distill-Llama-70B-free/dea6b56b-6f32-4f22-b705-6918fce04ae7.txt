Okay, so I've got this problem about a multiple disc clutch. Hmm, I remember that clutches use friction to transmit torque, right? The question gives me the torque delivered by the clutch as 400 lbs.-in., and I need to find the number of discs and the force acting on them. Also, there's a factor of safety of 2, and the disc friction surfaces are between 5 inches and 3 inches. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what exactly the sizes mean here. Oh, right, probably the diameter of the discs, which would relate to the radius since torque depends on the radius.

Wait, I think the torque equation for a clutch is something like T = n * μ * F * r, where n is the number of friction surfaces. Or wait, maybe it's the number of discs. Since each disc contributes two friction surfaces (one on each side), maybe the number of friction surfaces is twice the number of discs. Or wait, no, maybe each disc has one friction surface, and if it's a multi-disc clutch, each additional disc adds another pair of surfaces. Hmm, I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Let me think. The torque transmitted by a clutch can be calculated with T = (F * μ * n * r) / 2, but wait, maybe I should clarify. I recall that for a single plate clutch, the torque is T = μ * F * r, where r is the mean radius. For a multi-disc clutch, since each disc adds two friction surfaces, the torque would be T = n * μ * F * r, where n is the number of discs. Or wait, another formula I remember is T = (number of friction pairs) * μ * F * r. So if there are N discs, each disc contributes two friction surfaces (because each disc has two sides), so the number of friction pairs would be N. So the formula would be T = N * μ * F * r.

But wait, sometimes the formula is written as T = (number of discs) * 2 * μ * F * r, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps it's T = (number of friction surfaces) * μ * F * (mean radius). So each disc adds two friction surfaces, so the number of friction surfaces is 2*(number of discs). So the formula would be T = 2*N * μ * F * r, where N is the number of discs.

But wait, another point of confusion: the radius r. If the discs have different sizes, but the problem says the sizes are limited between 5 in and 3 in. Oh, wait, perhaps that's the inner and outer diameters, so the mean radius would be the average of the inner and outer radii. So for each disc, the effective radius is (R + r)/2 where R is the outer radius and r is the inner radius. But since the sizes are between 5 in and 3 in, that probably refers to the diameters, so the radii would be 2.5 and 1.5 inches. So the mean radius would be (2.5 + 1.5)/2 = 2 inches. Wait, that's 2 inches. So r would be 2 inches. 

Wait, but I think some sources say that for a multi-disc clutch, the torque formula is T = (n * (R^2 - r^2) * μ * F) / 2, where R is the outer radius and r is the inner radius. Or wait, maybe that's for the axial force required. Hmm, maybe I should recall the basic principles. The torque transmitted by each friction surface is μ * F * r, where r is the radius at which the force is applied. But for a disc with inner radius r and outer radius R, the effective radius for torque calculation is (R + r)/2, but wait, sometimes it's approximated as the mean radius. Alternatively, some sources use the formula T = (number of friction surfaces) * μ * F * r_mean.

Wait, maybe another approach. The torque capacity of a multi-disc clutch is given by T = n * μ * F * r, where n is the number of discs, μ is the coefficient of friction, F is the axial force, and r is the radius. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the formula might involve the number of friction surfaces, which is twice the number of discs because each disc has two surfaces (one on each side). So in that case, T = (2n) * μ * F * r. 

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't do that right now. Alternatively, I can think of it as each disc contributes two frictional surfaces, so the torque from each disc is 2 * μ * F * r, and with n discs, the total torque would be T = n * 2 * μ * F * r.

Wait no, that doesn't make sense because each disc is pressed against two plates, so each disc contributes two frictional interfaces. So maybe the formula is T = μ * F * (sum of the radii for each surface). So for each disc, the inner and outer radii contribute. Wait, perhaps it's better to model each disc as contributing two friction surfaces, each at a radius r. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, the mean effective radius is used.

Wait, perhaps the formula used in the problem is T = n * μ * F * r, where n is the number of discs, and r is the mean radius. So let's go with that for now.

Given that, the torque T is 400 lbs.-in. But wait, the factor of safety is 2. So the torque that the clutch can transmit without slipping should be twice the operating torque. So the required torque capacity would be 400 * 2 = 800 lbs.-in. So T_design = 800 lbs.-in.

Now, I need to find the number of discs (n) and the force F on them. The options give different n and F values.

I also know that the friction surfaces are between 5 in. and 3 in. Wait, that's diameters, so radii would be 2.5 and 1.5 inches. The mean radius would be (2.5 + 1.5)/2 = 2 inches. So r = 2 inches.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, the effective radius is the radius at which the force is applied, which for a disc clutch with multiple friction surfaces on each side, perhaps the radius is the same for each surface, but I'm not entirely certain.

Assuming that the mean radius is 2 inches, and using the formula T = n * μ * F * r.

Wait, but I don't know the coefficient of friction μ. Hmm, the problem doesn't provide it. Wait, perhaps it's a standard value. Wait, maybe I can infer it from the answer options, but that seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes a certain μ, like 0.25 or something. Wait, but without that information, I can't proceed. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T = (number of friction surfaces) * μ * F * r. So if each disc contributes two friction surfaces, then number of friction surfaces is 2n. So T = 2n * μ * F * r.

But without μ, I can't compute F and n. That's a problem. Unless μ is taken as 1, but that would be unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses μ = 0.25, which is a common value for dry friction in clutches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula T = F * (π * (D^2 - d^2)/4) * μ, where D is the outer diameter and d is the inner diameter. Wait, that formula would be for the torque per side, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Let's assume that each disc contributes two friction surfaces, so the total torque is T = 2 * n * μ * F * r, where r is the mean radius.

But without knowing μ, I can't proceed. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-read the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "evaluate the number of discs necessary and the force acting on them while the clutch is in operation." The factor of safety is 2, so the maximum allowable torque without slipping is 2 * 400 = 800 lbs.-in.

But I still don't know μ. Hmm. Maybe I can find μ from the possible answer options by working backward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a standard μ value. Wait, perhaps for a multiple disc clutch, μ is taken as 0.25. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, μ = 0.25, r = 2 inches, T_design = 800 lbs.-in.

Using the formula T = 2 * n * μ * F * r.

So, 800 = 2 * n * 0.25 * F * 2.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers: 800 = 2n * 0.25 * F * 2.

Wait, 2n comes from the number of friction surfaces, which is 2 per disc. So 800 = (2n) * μ * F * r.

Wait, substituting the values: 800 = 2n * 0.25 * F * 2.

Wait, that would be 800 = 2n * 0.25 * F * 2.

Let me compute that step by step.

2n is the number of friction surfaces. Multiply by μ (0.25), multiply by F (force per disc?), and multiply by r (2 inches). So:

800 = (2n) * 0.25 * F * 2.

Calculating the right side: 2n * 0.25 = 0.5n. Then 0.5n * F = 0.5nF. Then 0.5nF * 2 = nF.

So 800 = nF.

So nF = 800.

Hmm, so n times F equals 800. So F = 800 / n.

Now, looking at the options, each option gives n and F. So let's compute n*F for each option and see which one gives 800.

Option A: 3 discs, F=1028 → 3*1028=3084 ≠800.

Option B: 4, 1200 → 4800≠800.

Option C: 2,1600 → 3200≠800.

Option D:4,800 → 3200≠800.

Option E:6,666.7→ 4000.2≈4000≠800.

Option F:2,1256.6→ ~2513≠800.

Option G:1,2000→2000≠800.

Option H:7,571.4→ 4000≠800.

Option I:5,1600→ 8000≠800.

Option J:8,500→4000≠800.

Wait, none of the options give n*F=800. That can't be right. So perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me reconsider. Maybe the correct formula is T = n * μ * F * (pi*(D^2 - d^2))/2, but that's the axial force required. Wait, no, that formula is for calculating the force F required, where F is the axial force. Torque T would be μ * F * r, where r is the mean radius.

Wait, perhaps the formula for torque is T = μ * F * r * number_of_friction_surfaces. So if each disc contributes two friction surfaces, then the number of friction surfaces is 2n. So T = μ * F * r * 2n.

So with T=800 lbs-in, μ=0.25, r=2 inches.

So 800 = 0.25 * F * 2 * 2n.

Wait, let me clarify. The formula would be T = μ * F * r * (number of friction surfaces).

Number of friction surfaces is 2n, so T = μ * F * r * 2n.

So 800 = 0.25 * F * 2 * 2n.

Wait, that would be 800 = 0.25 * F * 2 * 2n = 0.25 * F * 4n = F * n.

So F * n = 800.

Again, same as before. So F = 800 /n.

Looking back at the options:

Which option has F = 800/n?

Option A: F=1028, n=3 → 1028≈800/3? 800/3≈266.67. No.

Option B: F=1200, n=4 → 800/4=200. No.

Option C: F=1600, n=2 → 800/2=400. No.

Option D: F=800, n=4 → 800/4=200. So F=800, n=4 → 800*4=3200, but according to F*n=800, 800*4=3200≠800. Wait no, because F*n should equal 800. So 800*4=3200, which is not 800. So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Maybe the torque per disc is μ * F * r, and for n discs, it's n times that. So T = n * μ * F * r.

So 800 = n * 0.25 * F * 2.

Because r is 2 inches.

So 800 = n * 0.25 * F * 2.

Simplify the right side: 0.25 * 2 = 0.5. So 800 = 0.5 * n * F.

Which gives n * F = 800 / 0.5 = 1600.

So n * F must equal 1600.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3*1028=3084 → No.

Option B:4*1200=4800→No.

Option C:2*1600=3200→No.

Option D:4*800=3200→No.

Option E:6*666.7≈4000.2→No.

Option F:2*1256.6≈2513.2→No.

Option G:1*2000=2000→No.

Option H:7*571.4≈4000→No.

Option I:5*1600=8000→No.

Option J:8*500=4000→No.

Hmm, none of the options give nF=1600. That's confusing. Did I make a mistake in the formula again?

Wait, perhaps the factor of safety affects the torque. The torque delivered is 400 lbs-in, but with a factor of safety of 2, the maximum allowable torque the clutch can handle is 400*2=800 lbs-in. So the clutch must be designed to handle 800 lbs-in.

So perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm missing something else. Maybe the radius isn't 2 inches. Let me think again about the radius.

The problem says the disc friction surfaces are between 5 in. and 3 in. So those are diameters, so radii are 2.5 and 1.5 inches. So the mean radius would be (2.5 + 1.5)/2 = 2 inches. So r=2 inches is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the radius used is the outer radius, 2.5 inches. Let's try that.

Using r=2.5 inches.

So using the formula T = n * μ * F * r.

Torque required is 800 = n * 0.25 * F * 2.5.

So 800 = n * F * 0.25 * 2.5 → 800 = n F * 0.625.

So n F = 800 / 0.625 = 1280.

Looking at the options, which have n*F=1280.

Option A: 3*1028=3084→No.

Option B:4*1200=4800→No.

Option C:2*1600=3200→No.

Option D:4*800=3200→No.

Option E:6*666.7≈4000.2→No.

Option F:2*1256.6≈2513.2→No.

Option G:1*2000=2000→No.

Option H:7*571.4≈4000→No.

Option I:5*1600=8000→No.

Option J:8*500=4000→No.

Still no match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the inner radius, 1.5 inches.

So r=1.5 inches.

Then, T = n * 0.25 * F * 1.5.

So 800 = n F * 0.25 * 1.5 → 800 = n F * 0.375.

So n F = 800 / 0.375 ≈ 2133.33.

Looking at options, none have n*F≈2133.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum of all the radii across all friction surfaces. Wait, maybe each disc has two friction surfaces, each at radius r, so the total torque per disc is 2 * μ * F * r. So for n discs, total torque is 2n μ F r.

So 800 = 2n * 0.25 * F * 2 → 800 = 2n * 0.25 * F * 2.

Wait, let's compute that: 2n * 0.25 is 0.5n, multiplied by F is 0.5nF, multiplied by 2 is nF.

So 800 = nF → nF=800.

Looking back at the options, which option has n*F=800.

Looking:

Option D: n=4, F=800 → 4*800=3200→No.

Option J:8,500→4000→No.

Wait, none of the options have n*F=800. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor of safety is applied to the force, not the torque. So the actual force required would be F_actual = F_design / factor_of_safety.

Wait, but the torque is given as 400 lbs-in, and with a factor of safety of 2, the maximum torque the clutch can handle is 800 lbs-in.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the problem differently, using the maximum frictional torque equation and considering the axial force.

Wait, another approach: the torque capacity of a disc clutch is given by T = (π * μ * F * (D^2 - d^2
