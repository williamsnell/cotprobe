Question:

For a class project, Charlotte recorded the heights of all 28 students in her class and calculated several statistics. She then realized she made an error recording the height of the tallest person in the class. She correctly had him listed as the tallest, but needed to add two inches to his recorded height to correct it. Which of these measures of spread must remain unchanged?

Options:

A: Mean absolute deviation
B: Mean
C: Coefficient of variation
D: Variance
E: Range
F: Interquartile range
G: Standard deviation

Okay, so I'm looking at this statistics question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about Charlotte who recorded the heights of 28 students. She made a mistake with the tallest person's heightâ€”she needs to add two inches to correct it. But she did have him listed as the tallest already, so his height was the maximum.

The question is asking which measure of spread remains unchanged after she fixes this error. The options are A through G, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should remember what each of these terms mean. Measures of spread include things like range, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range, etc. Let me think about each one and how they might be affected by changing the tallest value.

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Since she's increasing the maximum by two inches, the range will also increase by two inches. So the range changes. So option E is out.

Variance and standard deviation are measures that are affected by all the data points. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. If the tallest person's height increases, the mean might change a little, and the differences from the mean for all points would change, which affects variance and standard deviation. So D and G are probably changing, not the answer.

Mean absolute deviation is the average of the absolute differences from the mean. Again, if the mean changes, this would affect the calculation. So option A is probably out.

The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, usually expressed as a percentage. Since both standard deviation and mean might change, the CV would change too. So option C is out.

Interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). It represents the middle 50% of the data. Changing the maximum value, especially if it's an outlier, might not affect the IQR because the quartiles are based on the middle values. Let me think about this: the tallest person is just one data point. If the rest of the data remains the same, the quartiles might not change. So IQR might remain the same.

Wait, but does adding two inches to the tallest person affect the quartiles? Well, the quartiles are determined by the positions in the ordered dataset. Adding a bit more to the maximum might not change the position where Q3 and Q1 are. Unless the new value crosses some boundary that changes how the quartiles are calculated. But if the maximum was already higher than Q3, then increasing it a bit more wouldn't change where Q3 is. So I think IQR would stay the same.

What about the mean? The mean is the average of all the heights. Since Charlotte is adding two inches to the tallest person's height, the total sum increases by two, so the mean increases by 2/28, which is 1/14 inch. So the mean does change. So option B is out.

So putting it all together, the only measure of spread that doesn't change is the interquartile range. So the answer should be F.

When Charlotte corrects the tallest student's height by adding two inches, several measures of spread are affected. The range increases because the maximum value is now higher. Variance and standard deviation change due to the altered maximum value and its impact on the mean and deviations from the mean. Mean absolute deviation and coefficient of variation also change because they depend on the mean, which shifts slightly. However, the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1), remains unchanged. This is because the IQR is based on the middle 50% of the data, and changing the maximum value does not affect the positions of Q1 and Q3. Therefore, the measure of spread that remains unchanged is the interquartile range.

Answer: F
