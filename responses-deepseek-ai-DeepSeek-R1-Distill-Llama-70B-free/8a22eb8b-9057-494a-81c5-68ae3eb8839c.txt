Okay, so I've got this problem here about jointly Gaussian variables and mutual information. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says that (X, Y, Z) are jointly Gaussian, and they form a Markov chain X → Y → Z. So that means X and Z are conditionally independent given Y, right? I remember that in a Markov chain, any two variables are conditionally independent given the variable in the middle.

We're given the correlation coefficients: ρ(X,Y) is 0.1 and ρ(Y,Z) is 0.9. And we need to find the mutual information I(X;Z) in bits.

Wait, mutual information measures how much information X and Z share. But since they're in a Markov chain, maybe the information flows through Y. Oh right, mutual information can be expressed in terms of variances and correlations when dealing with Gaussians.

I remember that for jointly Gaussian variables, the mutual information I(X;Z) can be found using the formula:

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln( (σ_X² σ_Z²) / (σ_X² σ_Z² - [Cov(X,Z)]²) )

But wait, I need to find Cov(X,Z) first. Because X and Z are conditionally independent given Y, the covariance between X and Z should come only through Y.

So, Cov(X,Z) = Cov(X,Y) * Cov(Y,Z) / Var(Y). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Because in a Markov chain, the covariance can be decomposed. Oh right, using the chain rule for covariance.

In a Gaussian Markov chain X → Y → Z, the covariance between X and Z is the product of the covariances between X and Y, and Y and Z, divided by the variance of Y. Or wait, maybe it's Cov(X,Y) * Cov(Y,Z) / Var(Y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's the case.

Wait, another approach. The correlation coefficient is ρ(X,Y)=0.1, so Cov(X,Y) = ρ(X,Y) * σ_X σ_Y. Similarly, Cov(Y,Z)=ρ(Y,Z) * σ_Y σ_Z.

Since X, Y, Z are jointly Gaussian, the covariance matrix would be such that the conditional independence holds. So, the covariance between X and Z is E[XY]E[YZ]/E[YY], or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's the product of the covariances divided by Var(Y).

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a linear system. Let's assume zero means without loss of generality. So, Y is a Gaussian variable, and Z is a Gaussian variable dependent on Y, and X is a Gaussian variable dependent on Y.

Since X and Z are conditionally independent given Y, their joint distribution factors through Y. So, X and Y might have a certain covariance, and Y and Z another. So, the overall covariance between X and Z would be Cov(X,Z) = Cov(X,Y) * Cov(Y,Z) / Var(Y).

Wait, let me make this precise. Let me denote the covariance matrix as:

[ σ_X²        Cov(X,Y)        Cov(X,Z) ]
[ Cov(Y,X)    σ_Y²           Cov(Y,Z) ]
[ Cov(Z,X)    Cov(Z,Y)       σ_Z²     ]

But because X and Z are conditionally independent given Y, Cov(X,Z | Y) = 0. For jointly Gaussian variables, if X and Z are conditionally independent given Y, then Cov(X,Z) = (Cov(X,Y) * Cov(Y,Z)) / σ_Y². So that's the formula I was thinking of earlier.

So, Cov(X,Z) = [ρ(X,Y) σ_X σ_Y ] * [ρ(Y,Z) σ_Y σ_Z ] / σ_Y².

Simplifying this, the σ_Y² in the denominator cancels with one σ_Y from each numerator. So Cov(X,Z) = ρ(X,Y) * ρ(Y,Z) * σ_X σ_Z.

Wait, but what's the correlation coefficient ρ(X,Z)? It's Cov(X,Z)/(σ_X σ_Z), which would be ρ(X,Y)*ρ(Y,Z). So ρ(X,Z) = 0.1 * 0.9 = 0.09.

Wait, that's interesting. So the Pearson correlation coefficient between X and Z is 0.09. Now, to find I(X;Z), we can use the mutual information formula for two Gaussian variables.

The mutual information I(X;Z) is given by:

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln( (2π e)^{2} / (|det(K)|^{1/2}) )) ?

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The mutual information between X and Z when they're jointly Gaussian is:

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln( (σ_X² σ_Z²) / (σ_X² σ_Z² - [Cov(X,Z)]²) )

Alternatively, it can be expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient. Since for Gaussian variables, H(X) = (1/2) ln(2π e σ_X²), and similarly for H(Z). The mutual information is H(X) + H(Z) - H(X,Z).

But when X and Z are jointly Gaussian, H(X,Z) = (1/2) ln( (2π)^2 |K| ), where K is the covariance matrix.

So, putting it all together:

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln( (σ_X^2 * σ_Z^2) / (σ_X^2 σ_Z^2 - Cov(X,Z)^2) )

Which can be rewritten as:

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln( 1 / (1 - (Cov(X,Z)/(σ_X σ_Z))^2) )

But Cov(X,Z)/(σ_X σ_Z) is ρ(X,Z), which we found to be 0.09. So,

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln( 1 / (1 - (0.09)^2) )

Simplify that:

1 - (0.09)^2 = 1 - 0.0081 = 0.9919

So,

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln(1 / 0.9919) = (1/2) ln(1.00815...)

Wait, let's compute that. Let me calculate 1/0.9919 ≈ 1.00815.

The natural logarithm of 1.00815 is approximately 0.0081 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x). So,

I ≈ (1/2)(0.0081) = 0.00405 bits.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option E:0.00587, but wait, did I make a mistake here?

Oh wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute ln(1.00815):

Using calculator, ln(1.00815) is approximately 0.0081 (since ln(1+x) ≈x - x²/2 + x^3/3 - ... ). So x=0.00815, so ln(1.00815) ≈0.00815 - (0.00815)^2/2.

0.00815^2 is about 0.0000664, so divided by 2 is 0.0000332. So ln(1.00815) ≈0.00815 -0.0000332 = 0.0081168.

Then, I= (1/2)*0.0081168 ≈0.0040584 bits, about 0.00406.

But none of the options match this. Wait, let me check the options again:

The options are:

A: 0.45

B: 1.2

C: 0.1

D: 0.9

E: 0.00587

F: 0.15

G: 0.6

H: 0.7

I: 0.025

J: 0.3

Hmm, the closest is E: 0.00587, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute ln(1/0.9919) more accurately.

Wait, 1/0.9919 is approximately 1.00815.

Compute ln(1.00815):

Let me use a calculator: ln(1.00815) ≈ 0.0081165.

So I = 0.5 * 0.0081165 ≈0.004058.

Wait, but option E is 0.00587, which is about 0.00587. Hmm, that's about 0.00587. That's higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Cov(X,Z). Let me think again.

Wait, in the Markov chain X→Y→Z, is Cov(X,Z) equal to Cov(X,Y) * Cov(Y,Z)/Var(Y)?

Alternatively, perhaps it's the product of the individual correlations times their variances.

Wait, another approach: Let's model the variables as a linear Gaussian system.

Assume that Y is a Gaussian variable. Then, X can be expressed as X = a Y + N1, where N1 is Gaussian noise independent of Y. Similarly, Z = b Y + N2, where N2 is Gaussian noise independent of Y.

Then, the correlation between X and Y is ρ(X,Y) = 0.1. Similarly, ρ(Y,Z)=0.9.

Let me compute a and b in terms of the variances.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to normalize the variables. Let me assume that Y has unit variance, so σ_Y^2=1.

Then, Var(Y)=1.

Now, X is a Y + N1, so Var(X) = a^2 Var(Y) + Var(N1) = a^2 + Var(N1).

Similarly, Cov(X,Y) = Cov(a Y + N1, Y) = a Var(Y) + 0 = a.

Since ρ(X,Y)=0.1, which is Cov(X,Y)/(σ_X σ_Y) ) = a/(σ_X * 1) = 0.1.

Thus, a =0.1 σ_X.

Similarly, Var(X) = (0.1 σ_X)^2 + Var(N1) => σ_X^2 = 0.01 σ_X^2 + Var(N1).

So Var(N1) = σ_X^2 (1 - 0.01) = 0.99 σ_X^2.

Similarly, for Z:

Z = b Y + N2, with Var(N2) = σ_Z^2 (1 - ρ(Y,Z)^2 ) = σ_Z^2 (1 - 0.81) = 0.19 σ_Z^2.

And Cov(Y,Z) = b Var(Y) = b = ρ(Y,Z) σ_Y σ_Z = 0.9 * 1 * σ_Z.

So b =0.9 σ_Z.

Now, the covariance between X and Z is:

Cov(X,Z) = Cov(a Y + N1, b Y + N2) = a b Var(Y) + Cov(N1, N2).

But since X and Z are conditionally independent given Y, N1 and N2 are independent, so their covariance is zero. Thus:

Cov(X,Z) = a b Var(Y) = (0.1 σ_X)(0.9 σ_Z) * 1 = 0.09 σ_X σ_Z.

So, the correlation coefficient between X and Z is:

ρ(X,Z) = Cov(X,Z)/(σ_X σ_Z) ) = 0.09 σ_X σ_Z / (σ_X σ_Z) ) = 0.09.

So, same as before, ρ(X,Z)=0.09.

Now, mutual information I(X,Z) = (1/2) ln(1/(1 - ρ^2)).

Wait, because H(X) = (1/2) ln(2π e σ_X^2), H(Z) similarly.

H(X,Z) = (1/2) ln( (2π)^2 |K| ), where K is the covariance matrix [[σ_X^2, Cov(X,Z)], [Cov(X,Z), σ_Z^2]].

So, determinant K is σ_X^2 σ_Z^2 - (Cov(X,Z))^2 = σ_X^2 σ_Z^2 (1 - ρ^2).

So, H(X,Z) = (1/2) ln( 2π e σ_X σ_Z sqrt(1 - ρ^2) )).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute mutual information using:

I(X;Z) = H(X) + H(Z) - H(X,Z).

So,

I = [ (1/2) ln(2π e σ_X^2) ) + (1/2) ln(2π e σ_Z^2) ) ] - (1/2) ln( (2π e)^2 (σ_X^2 σ_Z^2 (1 - ρ^2))^{1/2} ) )

Simplify this:

= (1/2)[ ln(2π e σ_X^2) + ln(2π e σ_Z^2) ] - (1/2) [ ln( (2π e)^2 ) + ln( (σ_X^2 σ_Z^2 (1 - ρ^2))^{1/2} ) ) ]

Expand each term:

First term: (1/2)( ln(2π e) + ln(σ_X^2) + ln(2π e) + ln(σ_Z^2) )

= (1/2)( 2 ln(2π e) + ln(σ_X^2) + ln(σ_Z^2) )

Second term: (1/2)( 2 ln(2π e) + (1/2)( ln(σ_X^2 σ_Z^2 (1 - ρ^2)) ) )

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for mutual information between two jointly Gaussian variables:

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln( 1 / (1 - ρ(X,Z)^2) )

Because when you have two variables with correlation ρ, their mutual information is (1/2) ln(1/(1-ρ^2)).

So, with ρ=0.09,

I = (1/2) ln(1/(1 - 0.09^2)) = (1/2) ln(1/0.9919) ≈ (1/2) * 0.00815 ≈0.00407.

Wait, but that's about 0.00407, which is approximately 0.0041 bits. But none of the options match this. The closest option is E:0.00587, which is about 0.00587. Hmm, but my calculation isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the mutual information formula is (1/2) ln(1/(1-ρ^2)).

Wait, let me re-derive that. For two jointly Gaussian variables with zero mean, their mutual information is given by:

I(X;Z) = (1/2) ln( (σ_X^2 σ_Z^2) / (σ_X^2 σ_Z^2 - Cov(X,Z)^2) )

But since Cov(X,Z) = ρ σ_X σ_Z,

Then,

I = (1/2) ln( (σ_X^2 σ_Z^2) / (σ_X^2 σ_Z^2 (1 - ρ^2)) ) )

= (1/2) ln(1/(1 - ρ^2)).

So yes, that's correct. So with ρ=0.09, I should get around 0.00407 bits.

But looking at the options, the closest one isn't present. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ρ(X,Z).

Wait, earlier I assumed that Cov(X,Z) = (Cov(X,Y) * Cov(Y,Z)) / Var(Y), which would be (0.1 σ_X σ_Y) * (0.9 σ_Y σ_Z) ) / σ_Y^2.

Wait, this would give (0.1 * 0.9) * (σ_X σ_Y * σ_Y σ_Z) / σ_Y^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

Cov(X,Y) = ρ(X,Y) σ_X σ_Y = 0.1 σ_X σ_Y.

Cov(Y,Z) = ρ(Y,Z) σ_Y σ_Z = 0.9 σ_Y σ_Z.

Then, Cov(X,Z) = [Cov(X,Y) * Cov(Y,Z)] / Var(Y) = [0.1 σ_X σ_Y * 0.9 σ_Y σ_Z ] / σ_Y^2.

Wait, so:

(0.1 * 0.9) * (σ_X σ_Y * σ_Y σ_Z) ) / σ_Y^2 =

0.09 * σ_X σ_Y^2 σ_Z / σ_Y^2 = 0.09 σ_X σ_Z.

So Cov(X,Z) = 0.09 σ_X σ_Z, hence ρ(X,Z)=0.09.

So that part is correct.

So, the mutual information is I = (1/2) ln(1/(1 - 0.09^2)) ≈ (1/2) * 0.00815 ≈ 0.00407.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the variables are standardized, so σ_X = σ_Y = σ_Z=1. Let's see.

Assuming σ_X=σ_Y=σ_Z=1, then Cov(X,Z)=0.09.

Then, the mutual information is:

I = (1/2) ln( 1 / (1 - (0.09)^2) ) = (1/2) ln(1/0.9919) ≈ 0.00407 bits.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe I should compute it in nats and then convert to bits. Wait, no, because the formula already gives it in nats, and mutual information in bits is just (1/ln 2) times that.

Wait, no, the formula I used gives the mutual information directly in bits because it's using the base 2 logarithm? Wait, no, in information theory, mutual information is often expressed using natural logarithm (nats) when using continuous variables, but here the problem asks for bits, so perhaps I should use base 2.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the logarithm base. Let me clarify.

The mutual information formula I used earlier, (1/2) ln(1/(1-ρ^2)), is in nats, because it
