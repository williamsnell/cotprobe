(3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the borrower delivered to his daughter, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the borrower delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the borrower thereafter defaulted on the mortgage and the mortgage company brought an in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt, the mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: not succeed, because the daughter was not a party to the original mortgage contract.
B: succeed, because the mortgage company has the right to seek payment from any party associated with the property.
C: succeed, because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.
D: succeed, because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter.
E: not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
F: succeed, because the daughter took ownership of the property with the quitclaim deed.
G: not succeed, because the mortgage company did not record the mortgage until 1996.
H: not succeed, because the daughter was only promised the property, not the debt.
I: succeed, because the borrower defaulted on the mortgage.
J: not succeed, because the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of a property transfer.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about mortgages and property transfers. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. The scenario involves a jurisdiction using grantor-grantee indices, which I think are systems for recording property interests. The events happened in order from 1993 to 2008.

The events are:

1. In 1993, a borrower mortgages a ranch to a mortgage company for $25,000. The note is due on December 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest. So, the borrower gave a mortgage as security for the loan.

2. In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage. Hmm, so there was a delay in recording it. I remember that recording provides notice to others, affects priority, but the mortgage is valid between the parties once executed.

3. In 2007, the borrower signed a writing delivered to his daughter, promising to convey the ranch via quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when due. So, the borrower is making a promise to his daughter to transfer the property and pay off the mortgage.

4. In 2008, the borrower delivered a quitclaim deed to the daughter, which didn't mention the mortgage. A quitclaim deed only transfers whatever interest the grantor has, without warranties.

Now, the borrower defaulted on the mortgage, and the mortgage company is suing the daughter in personam to recover the mortgage debt. The question is whether the mortgage company will succeed.

The options are A through J. Let's think about each part.

I remember that a mortgage creates a lien on the property. The borrower (mortgagor) is personally liable on the debt. If the mortgagor transfers the property, the mortgage lien typically stays with the property, so the new owner (daughter) might take it subject to the mortgage. But the question is about the mortgage company suing the daughter personally for the debt, not foreclosure.

So, the issue is whether the daughter has become personally liable for the mortgage debt. Generally, when you buy property subject to a mortgage, you don't assume the personal liability unless you explicitly agree to it. In a quitclaim deed, the grantor doesn't make any promises about the property's condition, including any mortgages.

In this case, the borrower promised the daughter to pay the mortgage debt. But in the deed, there's no mention. So, the daughter didn't explicitly assume the debt. The borrower's promise was to pay, but that doesn't make the daughter liable unless she agreed to it.

Wait, but the borrower and daughter had an agreement in 2007 where the borrower promised to convey the ranch and pay the mortgage. Does that make the daughter liable? Or is it just a promise from the borrower to pay, which the daughter isn't a party to.

I think that without the daughter assuming the debt, she isn't personally liable. The mortgage company's right is against the borrower, unless there's a novation or assumption of the debt by the daughter.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Daughter wasn't a party to the original mortgage. So, the mortgage company can't go after her. That makes sense because she didn't sign the mortgage.

Option E: Daughter didn't promise to pay. She was just given the property. So the mortgage company can't collect from her.

Option D: Mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary. Hmm, the agreement between borrower and daughter was that the borrower would pay. If the daughter is a third-party beneficiary, then maybe the mortgage company could enforce, but I'm not sure. The agreement was between borrower and daughter, and the mortgage company wasn't a party to that.

Option B: Mortgage company can seek payment from any party associated. I don't think that's right because the mortgagee's right is against the mortgagor unless the debt is assumed.

Option C: Implied delegation of duties. I don't think so. The borrower can't delegate their duties to someone else without the creditor's consent.

Option F: Daughter took ownership with quitclaim. But that doesn't make her liable for the debt unless she assumed it.

Option G: Mortgage recorded in 1996. I don't think recording affects the daughter's liability here. The recording affects priority of liens, not personal liability.

Option H: Daughter was only promised property, not debt. That's correct. The borrower's promise was to pay, but the daughter didn't take on that obligation.

Option I: Borrower defaulted, so mortgage company can sue. But the suit is against the daughter, not the borrower.

Option J: Law doesn't permit delegation. That's about whether the borrower can transfer the duty. But the issue is whether the daughter is liable, not if the borrower can shift the duty.

So, putting it together, the mortgage company is trying to hold the daughter personally liable. She didn't assume the debt, so she isn't liable. The correct answer should be either A, E, or H.

Option A says she wasn't a party to the mortgage, so she's not liable. Option E says she didn't promise to pay. Option H says she was only promised the property, not the debt.

Wait, the mortgage company could be trying to hold her liable as the current owner of the property, but in an in personam action, they're suing her personally, not for foreclosure. So, they need her to have assumed the debt.

In the 2007 agreement, the borrower promised to convey and pay the debt. But the daughter isn't a party to that promise. The daughter didn't promise anything. So, the mortgage company can't go after her because she didn't assume the debt.

So, the correct answer would be E: not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.

Alternatively, option A could be correct. But A says she wasn't a party to the original mortgage. That's true, but the mortgagee could potentially go after her if she assumed the debt. Since she didn't, A is also correct, but E is more specific about why.

Wait, the question is about an in personam action against the daughter. The mortgagee could have a claim against her if she's personally liable. But she didn't assume the debt, so she isn't liable. Therefore, E is the reason.

Alternatively, if the daughter took the property subject to the mortgage, the mortgagee could foreclose, but that's an in rem action. The question is about in personam, so personal liability.

So, the answer is E.

The question revolves around whether the mortgage company can hold the daughter personally liable for the mortgage debt after the borrower defaulted. The key issue is whether the daughter assumed the mortgage debt, either explicitly or implicitly, when she received the quitclaim deed.

1. **Event Analysis**:
   - In 1993, the borrower mortgaged the ranch to the mortgage company, creating a lien on the property. The borrower remained personally liable on the debt unless the debt was assumed by someone else.
   - In 2007, the borrower promised the daughter in writing to convey the ranch and pay the mortgage debt when due. However, the quitclaim deed delivered in 2008 did not reference the mortgage, and the daughter did not explicitly agree to assume the debt.
   - A quitclaim deed transfers only the grantor's interest in the property at the time of transfer, without warranties, and does not necessarily make the grantee personally liable for any existing debts unless assumption of the debt is explicitly agreed upon.

2. **Key Legal Principles**:
   - Personal liability on a mortgage arises only if the debtor explicitly assumes the debt. Without such an assumption, the mortgage lien remains on the property, but the new owner is not personally liable for the debt.
   - The mortgage company’s in personam action against the daughter requires her to have assumed the debt, which did not occur here.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Correct in stating the daughter was not a party to the original mortgage, but this does not directly address the lack of assumption of the debt.
   - **Option E**: Correct and more specific, as it highlights that the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, making her not personally liable.
   - Other options either misapply legal principles or fail to address the critical issue of debt assumption.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The mortgage company cannot succeed in its in personam action against the daughter because she did not promise to pay the mortgage debt and did not assume it. The correct answer is:

**E: not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.**

Answer: E
