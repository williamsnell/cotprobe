Okay, so I have this question here about evangelists and their relation to Jerry Lee Lewis. Let me think through this step by step. The question is asking which of the listed evangelists is a cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis, the famous rocker.

First, I need to recall who Jerry Lee Lewis is. He's a well-known musician, often associated with rock and roll, and I think he's from the southern United States. His music career started in the 1950s, I believe. He's known for hits like "Great Balls of Fire" and "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On."

Now, the question is about which evangelist is his cousin. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is connected to him. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Jimmy Swaggart. I remember that Jimmy Swaggart is a televangelist, and I think he's from Louisiana. He's had some scandals in the past, but does he have a connection to Jerry Lee Lewis? I'm not sure, but I think there might be a family relation because both are from the same region.

Option B: Pat Robertson. He's the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and ran for president once. I don't recall him being related to Jerry Lee Lewis.

Option C: Kenneth Copeland. He's a prosperity gospel preacher. I don't know about any relation to Lewis.

Option D: Oral Roberts. He was a well-known faith healer and founder of Oral Roberts University. I don't think he's related to Lewis.

Option E: Billy Graham. A famous evangelist, but I don't think he's related to Lewis. They're both from different parts of the country, I believe.

Option F: Joel Osteen. He's the pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston. No known relation to Lewis that I'm aware of.

Option G: Benny Hinn. Another televangelist, but I don't think he's connected to Lewis.

Option H: Jerry Falwell. Founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. I don't recall a connection to Lewis.

Option I: Joyce Meyer. She's a televangelist and author. Don't think she's related.

Option J: Franklin Graham. Son of Billy Graham, but again, no relation that I know of.

Wait, going back to Jimmy Swaggart. I think I remember hearing that he and Jerry Lee Lewis are cousins. They both come from a musical family in Louisiana. Jerry Lee's family was quite involved in music, and perhaps Swaggart's family as well, though he went into ministry.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is A: Jimmy Swaggart.
