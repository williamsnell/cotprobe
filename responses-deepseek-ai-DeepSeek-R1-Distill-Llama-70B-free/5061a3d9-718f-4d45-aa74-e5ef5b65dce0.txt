The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The police were called to a domestic dispute. The wife told police that her husband was abusive and that he was a heavy cocaine user. The husband was present and denied the allegation. Police asked for permission to search the premises for drugs, which was consented to by the wife. The husband, however, refused to consent to the search. The police went ahead anyway and found drugs in the husband's belongings. After being arrested on drug charges, the husband filed a motion for suppression of the evidence based on lack of consent. What should be the likely decision of the trial court?

Options:

A: The search was valid because the husband's denial of the allegations was not credible.
B: The search was invalid because the wife was not authorized to give consent to search her husband's personal belongings.
C: The search was invalid because the police did not have a search warrant, which is required regardless of consent.
D: The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.
E: The search was valid because the cases say that one occupant's consent to the search overrules the other occupant's refusal to consent.
F: The search was valid because the wife's statement established probable cause that a crime was being committed  this created exigent circumstances for the search.
G: The search was valid because the wife's consent was sufficient to search the common areas of the home.
H: The search was invalid because the consent to search was not voluntary, as it was given out of fear of domestic violence.
I: The search was valid because the drugs were in plain view when the police entered the premises.
J: The search was invalid because, even though consent was given, the police must first attempt to get a search warrant to enter a home.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a domestic dispute and a search by the police. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that the police were called to a domestic dispute. The wife told them her husband was abusive and a heavy cocaine user. The husband denied it. The police asked to search the premises for drugs, and the wife consented, but the husband refused. They went ahead and found drugs in the husband's belongings. Now the husband is trying to get the evidence suppressed because he says they didn't have consent.

I remember that in the US, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Consent is one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. But there's also the idea of who can give consent. I think that if two people are living together, one can consent to a search of the premises, but maybe not the other's personal belongings.

Wait, there's a Supreme Court case about this. I think it's the case where one occupant consents and the other refuses. Oh right, it's Georgia v. Randolph. In that case, the police went to a home where the suspect's wife invited them in and gave consent to search, but the husband was present and refused. The Supreme Court held that the search was invalid because the husband's refusal took precedence when he was present.

So in this question, the husband was present and refused consent. The wife gave consent, but since the husband was there and objected, the police couldn't search based solely on the wife's consent. That makes the search invalid, and the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the search was invalid because the co-occupant was present and refused. That aligns with Georgia v. Randolph. 

Option E says one occupant's consent overrides the other's refusal, which would be the opposite of what the Supreme Court decided. So E is incorrect.

Other options: A talks about credibility of denial, but that's not the issue here. B is about the wife not being authorized to consent to her husband's belongings, which might be part of it, but the main issue is the presence and refusal. C says a warrant is always needed regardless of consent, which isn't true because consent is an exception. F mentions exigent circumstances, but the question doesn't state any such circumstances. G says wife's consent is enough for common areas, but the drugs were in husband's belongings, which are personal. H is about voluntariness of consent, not the main point here. I is plain view, but the drugs weren't mentioned as being in plain view. J is about getting a warrant first, which isn't required if consent is valid.

So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is based on the principle established in *Georgia v. Randolph*, which holds that when two co-occupants of a premises are present and one consents to a search while the other refuses, the refusal takes precedence. Here, the wife consented to the search, but the husband, who was present, refused. Under this precedent, the police could not legally proceed with the search without a warrant. Therefore, the search was invalid, and the evidence should be suppressed.

The answer is D.
