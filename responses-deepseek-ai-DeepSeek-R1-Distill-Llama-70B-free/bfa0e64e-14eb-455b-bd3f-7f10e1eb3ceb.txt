Okay, so I have this problem about waveguides and propagation constants. Hmm, I remember that waveguides support different modes, like TE and TM modes, and each mode has specific cutoff frequencies. The question gives a rectangular waveguide with dimensions 5 cm by 2.5 cm. The excitation frequency is 4000 megacycles, which I think is 4 GHz. I need to find the propagation constants for several modes: 10, 01, 20, 11, 02, and 55.

Wait, wait. The formula for the cutoff frequency for a rectangular waveguide is f_c = c/2 * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 ), where a and b are the dimensions, and m and n are the mode numbers. Since the waveguide is air-filled, the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

First, I should convert the frequency to Hz. 4000 megacycles is 4e9 Hz. Oh wait, wait. 1 megacycle is 1e6 Hz, so 4000 megacycles is 4e9 Hz. Right.

The cutoff frequency determines whether a mode can propagate. If the operating frequency is above the cutoff, the mode propagates; otherwise, it's evanescent. The propagation constant gamma is given by gamma = alpha + j beta. But when the frequency is above cutoff, alpha is zero, and gamma is j beta. Beta is the phase constant.

Wait, the propagation constant for a waveguide is given by beta = sqrt( (omega^2 mu epsilon) - (omega_c)^2 ), where omega is the operating angular frequency, omega_c is the cutoff angular frequency. Since it's a non-magnetic dielectric (air), mu is mu_0, and epsilon is epsilon_0.

Alternatively, since c = 1/sqrt(mu_0 epsilon_0), and omega = 2 pi f, so beta can be written as (2 pi f) * sqrt(1 - (f_c / f)^2 ). But wait, that's only when f > f_c. If f < f_c, then beta becomes imaginary, meaning attenuation.

So for each mode, I need to calculate the cutoff frequency. Then, if the operating frequency (4 GHz) is higher than the cutoff, the mode propagates, and the propagation constant is j beta. Otherwise, it doesn't propagate, and the constant is alpha (real number), but in this question, all the options have j values, so maybe all given modes are above cutoff?

Wait, the options have some modes as j something and others as just numbers. Wait, looking at the options, the 10 mode is j something, and the others are real. Wait, no, let me look:

Looking at option A: j78.5 for 10, 120.6 for 01 and 20. So perhaps 10 is propagating (so j beta), and others are cut-off. Wait, no, because 01 and 20 have higher cutoff frequencies? Maybe not.

Wait, wait, the 10 mode's cutoff is f10 = c/(2a) = (3e8 m/s)/(2 * 0.05 m) = 3e8/(0.1) = 3e7 Hz, which is 30 MHz. The operating frequency is 4 GHz, which is way higher, so 10 mode propagates. Similarly, 01 mode's cutoff is c/(2b) = 3e8/(2 * 0.025) = 3e8 / 0.05 = 6e8 Hz, 600 MHz. So 4 GHz is higher than 600 MHz, so 01 mode also propagates. Wait, but in option A, 01 is a real number, implying perhaps it's below cutoff. Wait, that can't be. Because 4 GHz > 600 MHz, so it should propagate, meaning beta is j something.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read the options again. The options list the propagation constants for each mode. For example, option A says j78.5 for 10, 120.6 for 01 and 20, etc. So 01 and 20 have real numbers, implying they're below cutoff, but that can't be right. Or perhaps the values are S.I. units of beta in radians per meter? Wait, the propagation constant is gamma = alpha + j beta. If the frequency is above cutoff, gamma is j beta (i.e., purely imaginary), so the real part is zero, and the value is j multiplied by beta. So in the options, when a mode is propagating, it's j times a number. When it's not, it's just a real number (alpha).

Wait, but in option A, 10 is j78.5 (so it's propagating), 01 and 20 are real (so they're cut off). But that can't be, because 01 has a higher cutoff than 10. Wait, let me calculate the cutoff frequencies for each mode.

Given a=5 cm=0.05 m, b=2.5 cm=0.025 m.

The cutoff frequency for mode mn is f_c(mn) = c/2 * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 )

Let me compute f_c for each mode:

10 mode: m=1, n=0.

f_c10 = (3e8 m/s) / 2 * sqrt( (1/0.05)^2 + (0/0.025)^2 ) = (1.5e8) * sqrt( (20)^2 ) = 1.5e8 * 20 = 3e9 Hz, which is 3 GHz.

Wait that can't be right. Wait, 1/(0.05) is 20, so (20)^2 is 400. So sqrt(400) is 20. So 1.5e8 * 20 = 3e9 Hz = 3 GHz. So cutoff for 10 is 3 GHz.

But the operating frequency is 4 GHz, which is higher than 3 GHz, so 10 mode propagates. So gamma is j beta.

Now 01 mode: m=0, n=1.

f_c01 = (3e8)/2 * sqrt( (0/0.05)^2 + (1/0.025)^2 ) = 1.5e8 * sqrt( (40)^2 ) = 1.5e8 *40 = 6e9 Hz=6 GHz.

Operating frequency is 4 GHz, which is less than 6 GHz. So 01 mode is below cutoff. So gamma is real (alpha), which is the attenuation constant.

Wait, but for 20 mode: m=2, n=0.

f_c20 = (3e8)/2 * sqrt( (2/0.05)^2 + 0 ) = 1.5e8 * sqrt( (40)^2 ) = 1.5e8 *40=6e9 Hz=6 GHz. So same as 01. So both 01 and 20 modes have cutoff at 6 GHz. Since 4 GHz <6 GHz, they are below cutoff, so their gamma is real (attenuation).

What about 11 mode: m=1, n=1.

f_c11= (3e8)/2 * sqrt( (1/0.05)^2 + (1/0.025)^2 ) = 1.5e8 * sqrt( (20)^2 + (40)^2 ) = 1.5e8 * sqrt( 400 + 1600 )= sqrt(2000)=~44.72. So 1.5e8 * 44.72 ≈ 6.7e9 Hz=6.7 GHz.

So 4 GHz <6.7 GHz. So 11 mode is also below cutoff. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, 4 GHz is 4e9, which is less than 6.7e9, so yes, 11 mode is cut off.

Wait no, wait. Wait, 4 GHz is 4e9 Hz. 6.7e9 is higher, so 4 GHz is below cutoff. So 11 mode is cutoff, so gamma is real.

02 mode: m=0, n=2.

f_c02= (3e8)/2 * sqrt( 0 + (2/0.025)^2 )= 1.5e8 * sqrt( (80)^2 )=1.5e8 *80=1.2e10 Hz=12 GHz. 4 GHz <12 GHz, so it's cutoff.

55 mode: m=5, n=5.

f_c55=(3e8)/2 * sqrt( (5/0.05)^2 + (5/0.025)^2 )= 1.5e8 * sqrt( (100)^2 + (200)^2 )= sqrt(10000 +40000) = sqrt(50000)=~223.6. So 1.5e8 *223.6≈ 3.354e10 Hz=33.54 GHz. 4 GHz is way below, so cutoff.

Wait, but wait, the options list some modes with j values and others as real. So in the given problem, for each mode, if the operating frequency is above cutoff, the propagation constant is j beta. If below, it's alpha.

So which modes are above cutoff? Let's list each mode:

10: cutoff 3 GHz. Operating at 4 GHz: above. So gamma is j beta.

01: cutoff 6 GHz. 4 GHz <6 GHz: gamma is alpha.

20: same as 01, cutoff 6 GHz: gamma is alpha.

11: cutoff 6.7 GHz. 4 <6.7: gamma is alpha.

02: cutoff 12 GHz: gamma is alpha.

55: cutoff 33.5 GHz: gamma is alpha.

So in the options, only the 10 mode should have a j value. The rest are real. Let me check the options.

Looking at option A: 10 is j78.5, others are real. That seems possible.

Option B: 10 is j55.4, others real. So possible.

Option C: 10 is j62.7, others real.

Option D: 10 is j70.2.

E: j59.6. F: j66.1. G: j50.4. H: j45.3. I:j48.8. J:j60.3.

So the other modes are all real, except 10. So now, I need to calculate beta for the 10 mode, and alphas for the others.

Beta for 10: beta = (2 pi f) * sqrt(1 - (f_c/f)^2 )

Given f=4e9 Hz, f_c=3e9 Hz.

So (f_c/f)= 3/4=0.75. So sqrt(1 - (0.75)^2 )= sqrt(1 - 0.5625)=sqrt(0.4375)= approx 0.6614.

So beta = 2*pi*4e9 * 0.6614. Let me compute that.

2*pi ≈6.2832. 6.2832 *4e9 ≈2.513e10.

Multiply by 0.6614: 2.513e10 *0.6614 ≈1.662e10 radians per second? Wait, no, beta is in radians per meter.

Wait, wait. Wait, beta is (omega) * sqrt(mu epsilon) * sqrt(1 - (fc/f)^2 )

Alternatively, using the formula beta = (2 pi f) * sqrt( (1 - (f_c/f)^2 )) / c.

Wait, because c = 1/sqrt(mu epsilon), so sqrt(mu epsilon) = 1/c.

Wait, perhaps another formula: beta = (2 pi sqrt( (f)^2 - (f_c)^2 )) ) / c.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for beta is beta = (omega) * sqrt( mu epsilon (1 - (f_c/f)^2 )) )

But mu epsilon = (1/c^2), so sqrt(mu epsilon) = 1/c. So beta = omega / c * sqrt(1 - (f_c/f)^2 )

omega is 2 pi f, so beta = (2 pi f)/c * sqrt(1 - (f_c/f)^2 )

Alternatively, beta = (2 pi /c) * sqrt( f^2 - f_c^2 )

Yes, that's correct. Because sqrt(f^2 - f_c^2) would be f sqrt(1 - (f_c/f)^2 ), so yes.

So beta = (2 pi / c) * sqrt(f^2 - f_c^2 )

So for 10 mode:

f=4e9 Hz, f_c=3e9 Hz.

sqrt(f^2 - f_c^2 )= sqrt( (4e9)^2 - (3e9)^2 )= sqrt( 16e18 -9e18 )= sqrt(7e18 )= ~8.366e9 Hz.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, sqrt( (4e9)^2 - (3e9)^2 )= sqrt( 16e18 -9e18)=sqrt(7e18)=sqrt(7)*1e9 *sqrt(1e0)= approx 2.6458e9 *1e9? Wait, no. Wait, 1e18 is (1e9)^2. So sqrt(7e18 )= sqrt(7) *1e9 = approx 2.6458e9. So yes, 2.6458e9 Hz.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly:

(4e9)^2 = 16e18.

(3e9)^2=9e18.

16e18-9e18=7e18.

sqrt(7e18 )= sqrt(7)*1e9 = approx 2.6458e9.

So beta = (2 pi / c) * 2.6458e9.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So 2 pi /3e8 ≈ 2.0944e-8 s/m.

Multiply by 2.6458e9: 2.0944e-8 * 2.6458e9 ≈ 2.0944 * 2.6458 * 1e1.

2.0944 *2.6458 ≈ let me compute:

2 * 2.6458 =5.2916.

0.0944 *2.6458≈ 0.0944*2.6=0.24544, 0.0944*0.0458≈ approx 0.00433. So total ≈0.24977.

Total ≈5.2916 +0.24977≈5.5414.

Multiply by 10: 55.414 rad/m.

So beta is approximately 55.414 rad/m. So the propagation constant gamma for 10 mode is j*55.414.

Looking at the options, which option has j55.4 for 10 mode? Let's check.

Option B: j55.4 for 10 mode.

Option G has j50.4.

Option E: j59.6.

Option A: j78.5.

So option B has j55.4.

Now, for the other modes, which are below cutoff. Their propagation constants are alpha = (2 pi f_c )/c * sqrt( (f_c/f)^2 -1 )

Wait, the formula for alpha is alpha = (2 pi /c) * sqrt( f_c^2 - f^2 )

Because when f < f_c, then beta becomes imaginary, and the attenuation constant alpha is the absolute value.

So for each mode below cutoff, alpha is (2 pi /c) * sqrt( (f_c)^2 - f^2 )

Wait, let's compute for each mode:

01 mode: f_c=6 GHz. f=4 GHz.

alpha = (2 pi /3e8 ) * sqrt( (6e9)^2 - (4e9)^2 )

Compute inside sqrt: (36e18 -16e18)=20e18.

sqrt(20e18 )= sqrt(20)*1e9 = approx 4.4721e9.

So alpha= (2 pi /3e8 ) *4.4721e9.

(2 pi /3e8 )= approx 2.0944e-8.

Multiply by 4.4721e9: 2.0944e-8 *4.4721e9 = 2.0944 *4.4721 *1e1.

2.0944 *4.4721≈ let's compute:

2 *4.4721=8.9442.

0.0944 *4.4721≈ 0.4217.

Total ≈9.3659.

Multiply by 10: 93.659 rad/m.

So alpha is approximately 93.659 rad/m.

So in the options, for 01 and 20 modes, which have the same cutoff, the alpha should be about 93.66.

Looking at the options:

Option B lists 93.8 for 01 and 20. Close to our calculation.

What about 20 mode? Same as 01, so same alpha.

Next, 11 mode: f_c=6.7 GHz.

alpha = (2 pi /3e8 ) * sqrt( (6.7e9)^2 - (4e9)^2 )

Compute inside sqrt: (6.7e9)^2 = approx 44.89e18.

(4e9)^2=16e18.

44.89e18 -16e18=28.89e18.

sqrt(28.89e18)=sqrt(28.89)*1e9= approx 5.376e9.

So alpha= (2 pi /3e8 ) *5.376e9.

(2 pi /3e8 )=2.0944e-8.

Multiply: 2.0944e-8 *5.376e9 ≈2.0944 *5.376 *1e1.

2.0944 *5=10.472, 2.0944 *0.376≈0.787.

Total≈11.259.

Multiply by 10: 112.59 rad/m.

Looking at the options, which have 11 mode's alpha as around 113.

Option B has 113 for 11 mode. So that matches.

Next, 02 mode: f_c=12 GHz.

alpha= (2 pi /3e8 ) * sqrt( (12e9)^2 - (4e9)^2 )

Inside sqrt: 144e18 -16e18=128e18.

sqrt(128e18)=sqrt(128)*1e9≈11.3137e9.

alpha=2.0944e-8 *11.313
