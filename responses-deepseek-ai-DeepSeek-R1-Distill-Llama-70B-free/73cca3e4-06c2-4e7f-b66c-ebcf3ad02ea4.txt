Okay, so I've got this question here about earnings per share, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... The question says the company has a profit to common shareholders of $4,750 and there are 1,000 shares outstanding. I need to find the earnings per share (EPS) from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that earnings per share is calculated by taking the net income that's available to common shareholders and dividing it by the number of common shares outstanding. That makes sense because you're distributing the profits among all the shareholders equally per share.

So the formula should be something like EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Shares Outstanding. But wait, in this problem, they only mention common shareholders, so maybe there are no preferred dividends involved here. Or perhaps the $4,750 already accounts for any preferred dividends that have been paid. Because I think usually, preferred shareholders get their dividends first before common shareholders. So if the profit to common shareholders is $4,750, that must be after any preferred dividends have been deducted.

So I don't need to worry about subtracting anything else because the $4,750 is what's left for common shareholders. And there are 1,000 shares outstanding. So I just divide 4,750 by 1,000.

Let me do the math. 4,750 divided by 1,000. Well, 4,750 divided by 100 is 47.5, so divided by 1,000 would be 4.75. So that's $4.75 per share.

Looking at the options, option D is $4.75. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, in some cases, the number of shares can be different if there are stock options or other factors, but the question says 1,000 shares are outstanding, so I think that's straightforward. No need for weighted averages or anything complicated because it's a simple division here.

Yep, I'm pretty confident. So the EPS is $4.75.

The earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit available to common shareholders by the number of common shares outstanding. Given that the profit to common shareholders is $4,750 and there are 1,000 shares outstanding, the calculation is:

\[
\text{EPS} = \frac{\$4,750}{1,000} = \$4.75
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: $4.75

Answer: D
