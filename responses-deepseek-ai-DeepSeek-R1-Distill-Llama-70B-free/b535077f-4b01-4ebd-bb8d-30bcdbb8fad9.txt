Okay, so I have this problem about combining two prisms to make an achromatic combination. Hmm, I remember that achromatic prisms or lenses are designed to minimize chromatic aberration, meaning they focus different wavelengths (colors) of light at the same point.

The question says we have a crown prism with an apex angle of 15 degrees. We need to combine it with a flint prism so that the combination is achromatic for rays of 400 nm and 700 nm. So, I guess this means that the dispersion (the spreading of light into colors) caused by the crown prism should be canceled out by the flint prism.

I remember that for a prism, the angular dispersion is given by the formula:

Δθ = (t * (n2 - n1)) / d

Wait, no, wait. Oh right! For a prism with apex angle θ, the angular dispersion (the angle between the two extreme wavelengths) is given by:

δ = (n_700 - n_400) * θ

Wait, no, wait another moment. I think the formula is actually δ = (n_high - n_low) * θ, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, I think the formula is that the angular dispersion (the angle between the two wavelengths) is δ = (n_700 - n_400) * θ, where θ is the apex angle. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, perhaps I should think about the dispersion more carefully.

Let me think. The refractive index for crown glass at 400 nm is higher than at 700 nm. So n_400 > n_700. For flint, it's the same—n_400 is higher than n_700 as well.

So for a prism, the angular dispersion (the angle between the two exit rays) is given by:

δ = (n_400 - n_700) * (θ), where θ is the apex angle. Wait, that seems right because if the refractive index is higher at 400, then the deviation angle for 400 would be more than for 700, so the difference would be (n_400 - n_700) multiplied by the apex angle.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on the exact formula. Another thought: the deviation δ for a prism is given by δ = (n - 1) * α, where α is the apex angle, for a specific wavelength. So for each wavelength, the deviation would be (n_λ - 1) * θ. So the angular dispersion between two wavelengths would be (n_400 - n_700) * θ.

So for the crown prism, the dispersion is (1.522 - 1.504) * 15 degrees. Let me calculate that: 0.018 * 15 = 0.27 degrees.

Wait, but we need the combination of the crown and flint prisms to be achromatic, so the total dispersion should be zero. That is, the dispersion from the crown and the dispersion from the flint should cancel each other out.

But wait, because when you put two prisms together, their dispersions add up. So if the crown prism has a positive dispersion, the flint prism should have a negative dispersion of the same amount. Alternatively, maybe the other way around.

Wait, in terms of the formula, the dispersion for the crown would be (n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown. Similarly, the flint would have (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint. But wait, the flint prism's dispersion would be in the opposite direction because maybe it's placed in the opposite orientation. So the total dispersion is the sum of the two prisms' dispersions. To be achromatic, the sum must be zero.

Wait, no. Maybe it's better to think that the angular dispersion (the spread) for each prism adds up. So the crown produces a certain dispersion, and the flint produces an opposite dispersion. So the total dispersion is the sum, which should be zero.

So setting the sum to zero:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown + (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint = 0

Wait, but wait. Because the crown and flint prisms will be arranged such that their dispersions are in opposite directions, so perhaps the signs are opposite. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

Total dispersion = (n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown - (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint = 0

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The crown prism has a dispersion of (n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown. The flint prism, when placed in the opposite direction, would have a dispersion of (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint, but perhaps in the opposite direction. So the total dispersion is the sum of the two, but one is positive and the other negative.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the dispersion is calculated as:

δ_total = δ_crown + δ_flint = 0

Where δ_crown = (n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown

δ_flint = (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint

But wait, if the prisms are placed such that their dispersions oppose each other, then δ_total = δ_crown - δ_flint = 0.

So:

δ_crown = δ_flint

But wait, let me clarify. The crown prism has a certain dispersion, which is (n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown. The flint prism has a dispersion of (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint, but since it's a different glass, it's likely that the product will have a different sign. Wait, no, because both crown and flint have n_400 > n_700, so (n_400 - n_700) is positive for both. So the dispersions would be in the same direction unless the prism is arranged oppositely.

Wait, maybe the key is that the two prisms are made of different materials and arranged so that their dispersions subtract. So the total dispersion is the difference between the two.

Hmm, perhaps I should refer back to the concept of an achromatic prism. I think that an achromatic prism combination uses two prisms made of different glasses (crown and flint) with apex angles chosen so that their dispersions cancel each other out for the two chosen wavelengths. So in this case, the crown and flint prisms are arranged in such a way that their angular dispersions for the two wavelengths are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, leading to a total dispersion of zero.

So the condition is:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown = (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint

But wait, no, because the crown prism's dispersion is positive, and the flint's would also be positive unless it's arranged in the opposite direction. Alternatively, perhaps the equation should be:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown + (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint = 0

Wait, that doesn't make sense because both terms would be positive. Then the sum would be positive, not zero. So perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the prisms are arranged so that their dispersions are in opposite directions. So the total dispersion is the difference between the two. So:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown = (n_flint_700 - n_flint_400) * θ_flint

Wait, that would make the equation:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown = (n_flint_700 - n_flint_400) * θ_flint

But that's the same as:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown = -(n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint

So then:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown + (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint = 0

So that's the condition for achromatic combination.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

Crown:
n_400 = 1.522
n_700 = 1.504
θ_crown = 15 degrees

Flint:
n_400 = 1.662
n_700 = 1.613
θ_flint = ?

We want to find θ_flint.

So,

(1.522 - 1.504) * 15 + (1.662 - 1.613) * θ_flint = 0

Compute each term:

1.522 - 1.504 = 0.018
0.018 * 15 = 0.27 degrees

1.662 - 1.613 = 0.049
So:

0.27 + 0.049 * θ_flint = 0

Wait, that can't be right because 0.27 plus something equals zero, which would require θ_flint to be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is that the sum is zero, meaning that the dispersion of the crown and flint must cancel each other. So:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown + (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint = 0

But with the numbers given:

0.018 * 15 + 0.049 * θ_flint = 0

Which gives:

0.27 + 0.049 * θ_flint = 0

0.049 * θ_flint = -0.27

θ_flint = -0.27 / 0.049 ≈ -5.51 degrees

Negative angle? That doesn't make sense because prism angles are positive. So perhaps I got the equation wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the correct condition is:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown = (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint

But then:

0.018 * 15 = 0.049 * θ_flint

0.27 = 0.049 * θ_flint

θ_flint = 0.27 / 0.049 ≈ 5.51 degrees

Which is approximately 5.5 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 5.5 degrees. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "to be combined with a prism of silicate flint", so the flint prism's apex angle would be positive. So maybe the correct equation is that the total dispersion is zero, which is the sum of the two prisms' dispersions. But in the first approach, I ended up with a negative angle, which doesn't make sense, so perhaps the correct approach is to set the crown dispersion equal to the flint dispersion, but with opposite signs, leading to their sum being zero.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the angular dispersion of the crown is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the flint. So:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown = - (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint

Which would give:

θ_flint = -( (n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown ) / (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700 )

Plugging in the numbers:

θ_flint = -(0.018 * 15) / (0.049)

= -(0.27) / 0.049 ≈ -5.51 degrees

But again, negative angle doesn't make sense, so perhaps I'm considering the wrong arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the dispersion caused by the crown is equal to the dispersion caused by the flint, but in the same direction. So that the total is zero? Maybe I'm getting confused about how the prisms are arranged.

Wait, another approach: For an achromatic prism combination, the condition is that the angular dispersion for the two wavelengths (400 and 700 nm) must be equal and opposite.

So the formula is:

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown = (n_flint_700 - n_flint_400) * θ_flint

Because the flint prism's effect is subtracted. So,

(n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown = (n_flint_700 - n_flint_400) * θ_flint

Which is:

0.018 * 15 = (1.613 - 1.662) * θ_flint

Because n_flint_700 is 1.613, n_flint_400 is 1.662, so n_flint_700 - n_flint_400 is -0.049.

So,

0.27 = (-0.049) * θ_flint

Which would give:

θ_flint = 0.27 / (-0.049) ≈ -5.51 degrees

Again, negative. Hmm, this isn't making sense. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flint prism is used in the reverse direction, so its dispersion is subtracted. So the total dispersion is:

δ_total = (n_crown_400 - n_crown_700) * θ_crown - (n_flint_400 - n_flint_700) * θ_flint = 0

So,

0.018 * 15 - 0.049 * θ_flint = 0

0.27 - 0.049 θ_flint = 0

0.049 θ_flint = 0.27

θ_flint = 0.27 / 0.049 ≈ 5.51 degrees

Which is about 5.5 degrees, so option C.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C, 5.5 degrees.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to combine a crown prism with an apex angle of 15° and a flint prism such that the combination is achromatic for wavelengths of 400 nm and 700 nm. Achromaticity requires that the total angular dispersion of the combination is zero. The angular dispersion of a prism is given by:

\[
\delta = (n_{400} - n_{700}) \cdot \theta
\]

where \( n_{400} \) and \( n_{700} \) are the refractive indices of the glass at 400 nm and 700 nm, respectively, and \( \theta \) is the apex angle of the prism.

### Step 1: Calculate the angular dispersion of the crown prism
For the crown prism:
\[
n_{400} = 1.522, \, n_{700} = 1.504, \, \theta_{\text{crown}} = 15^\circ
\]
\[
\delta_{\text{crown}} = (n_{400} - n_{700}) \cdot \theta_{\text{crown}} = (1.522 - 1.504) \cdot 15 = 0.018 \cdot 15 = 0.27^\circ
\]

### Step 2: Set up the condition for achromaticity
The total angular dispersion of the combination must be zero:
\[
\delta_{\text{crown}} + \delta_{\text{flint}} = 0
\]
Substituting the expression for angular dispersion:
\[
(n_{400} - n_{700}) \cdot \theta_{\text{crown}} + (n_{400} - n_{700}) \cdot \theta_{\text{flint}} = 0
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the apex angle of the flint prism
For the flint prism:
\[
n_{400} = 1.662, \, n_{700} = 1.613
\]
\[
\delta_{\text{flint}} = (n_{400} - n_{700}) \cdot \theta_{\text{flint}} = (1.662 - 1.613) \cdot \theta_{\text{flint}} = 0.049 \cdot \theta_{\text{flint}}
\]

Using the condition for achromaticity:
\[
0.27 + 0.049 \cdot \theta_{\text{flint}} = 0
\]
\[
0.049 \cdot \theta_{\text{flint}} = -0.27
\]
\[
\theta_{\text{flint}} = \frac{-0.27}{0.049} \approx -5.51^\circ
\]

The negative sign indicates that the flint prism must be oriented in the opposite direction to cancel the dispersion of the crown prism. The magnitude of the apex angle is approximately \( 5.5^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
The apex angle of the flint prism is **5.5 degrees**.
