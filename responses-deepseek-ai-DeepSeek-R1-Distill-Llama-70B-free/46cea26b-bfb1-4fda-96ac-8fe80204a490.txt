Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about Rolando's cans of soup. It says that half of them are tomato, and two fifths are chicken noodle. I need to find out what fraction of the cans are either tomato or chicken noodle. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay, so first, let's break this down. The total cans are split into two categories: tomato and chicken noodle. But wait, are these the only two types? The question doesn't specify, so I guess I have to assume that these are the only two or that all others are negligible. Or maybe the question is just asking for the sum of these two, regardless of other types. Wait, the question says "either tomato or chicken noodle," so I think we're just adding those two fractions together.

So, the fractions are 1/2 for tomato and 2/5 for chicken noodle. To find the total fraction that's either one or the other, I need to add these two fractions. But wait, before I jump into adding, I should make sure they don't overlap. Like, is there any can that's both tomato and chicken noodle? That doesn't make much sense, so I think they're mutually exclusive. So addition is the right approach here.

Adding fractions requires a common denominator. Let's find the least common denominator (LCD) for 2 and 5. Well, 2 and 5 are both prime, so their LCD is 10. So I'll convert each fraction to have 10 as the denominator.

1/2 is equivalent to 5/10 because 1 times 5 is 5 and 2 times 5 is 10. Similarly, 2/5 becomes 4/10 because 2 times 2 is 4 and 5 times 2 is 10. Now, adding them together: 5/10 + 4/10 equals 9/10. Wait, but that's 9/10. Oh wait, 9/10 is 0.9, which is a high fraction, but let me check the options provided.

Looking at the options: A is 2/3 (~0.666), B is 10-Sep which doesn't make sense, C is 5-Mar, also not a valid fraction, D is 6/11 (~0.545), E is 5/8 (0.625), F is 7-Mar, G is 10-Jul, H is 4/7 (~0.571), I is 7/12 (~0.583), J is 3/5 (0.6). Wait, none of these options is 9/10, which is 0.9. So that's confusing. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. Oh! Wait, the question says "either tomato or chicken noodle," but perhaps there's more types of soup. So the total might not be just tomato and chicken noodle; there could be others, so the sum of these two could be more than the total. No, that doesn't make sense. Because if you have more than 100%, that can't be right. Wait, because 1/2 is 0.5 and 2/5 is 0.4. Adding them gives 0.9, which is 90%. But that's only possible if the total is 1 (or 100%), but if there are other soups, then the total would be 1, so 0.9 would be the fraction. But the options don't have 9/10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding them. Let me try again. 1/2 is 5/10, 2/5 is 4/10. 5+4 is 9, so 9/10. That's correct. So why isn't 9/10 one of the options? Let me look again. Oh, maybe I misread the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking back: The options are A to J, each with a label. Let me list them clearly:

A: 2/3
B: 10-Sep (Hmm, that doesn't look like a fraction. Maybe it's a typo for 10/9? Or perhaps it's supposed to be a date, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's 10/ something. Not sure, but probably not relevant.)

C:5-Mar (Same issue, maybe a typo for 5/3?)

D:6/11

E:5/8

F:7-Mar (Same problem)

G:10-Jul (Again, perhaps 10/7?)

H:4/7

I:7/12

J:3/5

Wait, none of these is 9/10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the question is asking for something else. Wait, the question is about the fraction that is either tomato or chicken noodle. So perhaps I should have considered whether the two categories are separate or overlapping. But as I thought earlier, they don't overlap, so adding is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the total is not 1, but perhaps the sum exceeds 1, but that doesn't make sense because the total can't be more than 1. So maybe the problem is that the initial assumption is wrong, and the fractions are parts of the same total.

Wait, perhaps the fractions are not of the same whole. No, that can't be right because they are both fractions of the same cupboard's cans.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me assume that the total number of cans is T. Then, tomato is (1/2)T, and chicken noodle is (2/5)T. So total tomato and chicken noodle would be (1/2 + 2/5)T.

Calculating that: 1/2 is 0.5, 2/5 is 0.4, sum is 0.9, so 0.9T. So the fraction would be 0.9, which is 9/10. But since 9/10 isn't an option, perhaps the question has a typo or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, let me check the question again. Oh! Wait, perhaps the fractions are not to be added because they are of different denominators. Or maybe I should subtract something. No, that doesn't make sense because they're separate categories.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sum exceeds 1, which would mean that the fractions can't both be correct. Wait, 1/2 plus 2/5 is 9/10, which is less than 1, so that's fine. So the total would be 9/10, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's try adding 1/2 and 2/5 again. The denominators are 2 and 5. The least common denominator is 10. So 1/2 is 5/10, 2/5 is 4/10. Adding gives 9/10. So that's correct. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I'm misreading one of them. Let me check:

Option J is 3/5, which is 0.6. That's less than 0.9. Option A is 2/3 (~0.666). Option E is 5/8 (0.625). None of these are 0.9.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is that the fractions are not of the same whole. Like, maybe 1/2 are tomato of the total, and 2/5 are chicken noodle of the remaining. So for example, after taking out the tomato, the chicken noodle is 2/5 of what's left. That would change things.

Oh! Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. Let me think about that. So if 1/2 of all the cans are tomato, then the remaining half are non-tomato. Of that remaining half, 2/5 are chicken noodle. So the chicken noodle would be (2/5)*(1/2) = 2/10 = 1/5 of the total.

Then, the total tomato or chicken noodle would be 1/2 (tomato) plus 1/5 (chicken noodle) = 5/10 + 2/10 = 7/10. But 7/10 isn't among the options either. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says "2/5 are chicken noodle," not "2/5 of the remaining after tomato." So I think the initial approach was correct. So perhaps the problem is that the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the fraction in a different way. Let me calculate using another method. Let's assume there are 10 cans in total because 10 is a common multiple of 2 and 5.

If there are 10 cans:

Tomato: 1/2 of 10 is 5 cans.

Chicken noodle: 2/5 of 10 is 4 cans.

So total tomato and chicken noodle: 5 + 4 = 9 cans.

So the fraction is 9/10. But that's still not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps one of them is 9/10 but written differently. Let me check:

Option A: 2/3 (~0.666)
Option B: 10-Sep (Not a fraction)
Option C:5-Mar (Not a fraction)
Option D:6/11 (~0.545)
Option E:5/8 (0.625)
Option F:7-Mar (Not a fraction)
Option G:10-Jul (Not a fraction)
Option H:4/7 (~0.571)
Option I:7/12 (~0.583)
Option J:3/5 (0.6)

Still nothing. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again.

The question says, "What fraction of the cans of soup in Rolando’s cupboard are either tomato or chicken noodle?" So it's the sum of the two fractions, which is 9/10, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question has a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the fraction that's either tomato or chicken noodle, but not both. But since they are separate, that's the same as adding them. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe the fractions are parts of different groups. Wait, perhaps the 2/5 is of the non-tomato cans. Let me try that approach again.

So, total cans: T.

Tomato: (1/2)T.

Non-tomato: (1 - 1/2)T = (1/2)T.

Chicken noodle is 2/5 of non-tomato: (2/5)(1/2 T) = (2/10)T = 1/5 T.

So total tomato or chicken noodle: (1/2)T + (1/5)T = (5/10 + 2/10)T = 7/10 T.

But 7/10 is 0.7, which is 7/10. Looking at the options, none of them is 7/10. Wait, option I is 7/12, which is approximately 0.583. So that's not it.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is asking for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are in addition to each other, but that would mean that tomato is 1/2 and chicken noodle is 2/5, so the total is 9/10, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is not in the options, but that's unlikely. Maybe I should check if there's a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let's find the sum of 1/2 and 2/5.

1/2 + 2/5 = (5/10 + 4/10) = 9/10.

But the options don't have 9/10. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the question is missing some information.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the fractions are 1/2 and 2/5, but the total is 1. So 1/2 + 2/5 = 9/10, and the rest are other soups. So the fraction is 9/10, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe I should subtract the fractions. Wait, that doesn't make sense because they're separate categories.

Wait, perhaps the question was meant to say that 1/2 are tomato or chicken noodle, and 2/5 are chicken noodle. But that would be different. Let me see: if 1/2 are tomato or chicken noodle, and 2/5 are chicken noodle, then tomato would be 1/2 - 2/5 = (5/10 - 4/10) = 1/10. So total would be 1/2, but that doesn't fit the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the fraction that is either tomato or chicken noodle, but not both. But since they're different, it's the same as adding.

I'm stuck here because according to my calculations, the answer should be 9/10, which isn't an option. But perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me try adding the fractions again. 1/2 is 0.5, 2/5 is 0.4. Adding gives 0.9, which is 9/10. So yes, that's correct.

Looking back at the options, perhaps one of them is 9/10 but written differently. Let me check each option:

A: 2/3 → 0.666...

B: 10-Sep → Not a fraction.

C:5-Mar → Not a fraction.

D:6/11 → ~0.545.

E:5/8 → 0.625.

F:7-Mar → Not a fraction.

G:10-Jul → Not a fraction.

H:4/7 → ~0.571.

I:7/12 → ~0.583.

J:3/5 → 0.6.

None of these are 0.9 or 9/10. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the fractions are not of the total but of each other. For example, 1/2 are tomato, and then 2/5 of those are chicken noodle. That would be a different scenario. Let me try that.

If 1/2 are tomato, and 2/5 of those tomato cans are also chicken noodle, that would imply overlap. But that doesn't make sense because tomato and chicken noodle are different flavors. So that approach is probably wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2/5 is of the entire collection, not considering the tomato. So total is 1/2 + 2/5 = 9/10, as before.

I'm really stuck here because according to my calculations, the answer isn't among the options. Perhaps the intended answer is J:3/5, which is 0.6, but that's less than 0.9. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to subtract the fractions, but that would give 1/2 - 2/5 = (5/10 -4/10)=1/10, which is even smaller.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the probability of picking either, but that doesn't change the fraction.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the fractions are of different total numbers. For example, if Rolando has T cans, then tomato is (1/2)T and chicken noodle is (2/5)T. But if the total T is such that (1/2 + 2/5)T equals the number of cans that are either, but the fraction would still be 9/10.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the fractions are not to be added because they are mutually exclusive, but that still leads to the same sum.

I'm really not sure why the options don't include 9/10. Maybe the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the fractions. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says 1/2 are tomato and 2/5 are chicken noodle. So that's 0.5 + 0.4 = 0.9. So 9/10.

Wait, perhaps the options list 9/10 as option B, but it's written as 10-Sept. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo. Like, perhaps it's 9/10, and the option is written as 9/10 but mislabeled as 10-Sep. But that's just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is not present, but the closest is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the total is more than 1. For example, if the fractions are parts of different groups. No, that doesn't make sense because they're both parts of the same total.

Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are of different subsets. Like, 1/2 are tomato-based soups, and 2/5 are chicken noodle soups, which may include some tomato-based. But that's complicating it too much, and the question doesn't suggest any overlap.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the only logical conclusion is that the correct answer is 9/10, which isn't among the provided options. But since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the fraction in another way, like the least common multiple or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the sum as a percentage, but that still wouldn't match the options.

Wait, let me try calculating using a different denominator. Let's say the total number of cans is 10, as before.

Tomato: 5 cans.

Chicken noodle: 4 cans.

Total tomato or chicken noodle:9 cans.

Fraction:9/10.

Still the same result.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct answer is 7/10, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 3/5, which is option J, but that's 0.6, which is less than 0.9. I don't see how that would be the case.

Alternatively, maybe I should subtract the fractions. 1/2 - 2/5 = (5/10 -4/10)=1/10, but that's 0.1, which is even smaller.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the fraction that's either tomato or chicken noodle, but in the context that these
