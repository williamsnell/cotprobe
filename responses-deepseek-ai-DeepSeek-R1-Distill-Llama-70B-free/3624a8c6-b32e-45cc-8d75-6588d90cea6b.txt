Okay, so I've got this problem here about Martha Michael spending $360 on her monthly telephone bills, and that's supposed to be 6 and 1/4 percent of her yearly earnings. I need to find her yearly earnings. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably figure out what 6 and 1/4 percent means in decimal form because percentages are easier to work with when they're in decimal. So 6 and 1/4 percent... Well, 1/4 is 0.25, right? So 6.25%. To convert that to a decimal, I divide by 100. So 6.25 divided by 100 is 0.0625. Got that down.

Now, the problem says that $360 is equal to 6.25% of her yearly earnings. Let me represent her yearly earnings with a variable, say, Y. So, in equation form, that would be 0.0625 multiplied by Y equals 360. So, 0.0625 * Y = $360.

Wait, actually, the wording says $360 amounts to that percentage of her earnings. So maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, yes, 360 is 6.25% of her earnings. So 360 = (6.25/100) * Y. Yeah, that's correct.

So I need to solve for Y. To do that, I can rearrange the equation. Y equals 360 divided by 0.0625. Let me do that calculation. Hmm, 360 divided by 0.0625. Let me think, 0.0625 is the same as 1/16 because 1/16 is 0.0625. So dividing by 1/16 is the same as multiplying by 16. So 360 * 16. Let me compute that.

Wait, 360 times 16. Let me break it down. 360 * 10 is 3600, and 360 * 6 is 2160. Wait, no, that's 10 and 6. Or wait, 16 is 10+6, so 360*(10+6) = 3600 + 2160, which is 5760. So 360 *16 is 5760. Therefore, Y is $5,760.

Looking back at the options, option E is $5,760. So the answer should be E.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake when converting the percentage. 6 and 1/4 percent is 6.25%, which is 0.0625 as a decimal. So 0.0625 * Y = 360. So Y = 360 / 0.0625. Yes, that's correct. And 360 divided by 0.0625 is indeed 5760. That makes sense.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: If 6.25% is $360, then 1% would be 360 divided by 6.25. Let me compute that. 360 / 6.25. Well, 6.25 times 57.6 is 360 because 6.25 * 57.6 = 360. So 1% is $57.6. Therefore, 100% would be 57.6 * 100 = $5760. Yep, that's the same result.

So I'm confident the correct answer is E, $5,760.

To determine Martha Michael's yearly earnings, we know that $360 represents 6.25% of her earnings. Converting 6.25% to a decimal gives 0.0625. Let her yearly earnings be \( Y \). The equation is:

\[
0.0625 \times Y = 360
\]

Solving for \( Y \):

\[
Y = \frac{360}{0.0625} = 5760
\]

Thus, Martha Michael's yearly earnings are $5,760, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
