Question:

A 50-year-old woman comes to the office for the first time because of recurrent abdominal pain. Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Conversion disorder
B: Histrionic personality disorder
C: Occult medical disorder
D: Somatic symptom disorder

Okay, so I have this question about a 50-year-old woman with recurrent abdominal pain. She's come to the office for the first time, and her medical history is pretty extensive. The question is asking for the most likely diagnosis from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I get all the details. She's had a long history of varying physical symptoms, but no definitive causes have been found despite a lot of tests, consultations, and even surgeries. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms and makes conflicting statements about her history. She's been hospitalized at least 23 times since she was 18. Wow, that's a lot.

So, looking at the options: A is Conversion disorder, which I think is now called Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder. It's where someone has neurological symptoms that can't be explained medically, like paralysis or seizures, but it's linked to psychological factors. But this patient has a lot of different physical symptoms, not just neurological ones. So maybe not A.

Option B is Histrionic Personality Disorder. From what I remember, this is a personality disorder where people are overly emotional, attention-seeking, and have dramatic behavior. They might have exaggerated symptoms, but the key here is that it's a personality disorder, which is more about long-term behavior patterns, not necessarily explaining the physical symptoms. But her symptoms have been varied and extensive, so I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option C is Occult medical disorder. That would mean there's a hidden medical condition that hasn't been diagnosed yet. But the question says despite extensive tests and many doctors, no cause was found. So if they've done a lot of diagnostic work and can't find anything, maybe it's not an occult disorder. They probably considered that, but after all, there's no evidence, so perhaps C is less likely.

Option D is Somatic Symptom Disorder. This is when someone experiences physical symptoms that cause significant distress, and they have excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the symptoms. They might worry excessively about their symptoms, even when medical tests don't show anything. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I also remember Factitious Disorder and Somatization Disorder, which are similar but different.

Wait, Somatization Disorder is when someone has multiple, recurrent physical complaints that can't be explained by a medical condition. It's part of the somatoform disorders. But now I think the DSM-5 has changed some of these categories. Oh right, in DSM-5, Somatization Disorder and several others were combined into Somatic Symptom Disorder, which is option D. So, Somatic Symptom Disorder involves one or more chronic physical symptoms (like pain, fatigue) that are distressing and result in significant disruption of daily life. The key is that the person has excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the symptoms, like excessive worry about the implications or devoting too much time to the symptoms.

But wait, the woman in the question has a long history of varying symptoms, no medical cause found, and she's been hospitalized many times. Also, she gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions. So that makes me think again about the other possibilities.

Wait, is this Factitious Disorder? Factitious Disorder is when the person intentionally creates or fakes symptoms to gain attention and sympathy. But the question doesn't mention anything about faking symptoms, just that she describes them dramatically. Also, she's had multiple surgeries and many hospitalizations, which suggests that she might believe her symptoms are real, but perhaps the medical community hasn't found a cause.

Alternatively, could it be Histrionic Personality Disorder? People with HPD are dramatic, seek attention, and have excessive emotionality. But that's more about their personality and interactions, not necessarily about having multiple unexplained physical symptoms. So I don't think that's the primary diagnosis here.

So back to the options. The extensive medical workup without findings, the multiple symptoms over time, and the high number of hospitalizations point towards a somatic symptom disorder. But wait, another possibility is Conversion Disorder, but that's more for specific neurological symptoms.

Wait, another thought: the question says she's had several surgical explorations. So they've done laparoscopies or other surgeries looking for causes but found nothing. That's a lot of procedures without findings, suggesting that the symptoms might be more psychological.

So putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is Somatic Symptom Disorder (option D). Because she has multiple, chronic physical symptoms that can't be explained, and she's exhibiting excessive concern about them, even though extensive tests are negative.

Alternatively, could it be Factitious Disorder? That would involve fabricating symptoms, but the question doesn't indicate that she's faking them. It just says she gives dramatic descriptions and conflicting statements. Maybe that's more in line with Histrionic PD, but again, that's a personality disorder, and the main issue here seems to be the physical symptoms without a cause.

Wait, what about Munchausen's Syndrome, which is a Factitious Disorder where the person repeatedly acts as if they have illnesses. But again, the question doesn't say she's fabricating the symptoms, so I don't think that's it.

Another possibility: could there be a Somatization Disorder (now part of Somatic Symptom Disorder) where someone has multiple, unexplained symptoms across different organ systems. That fits here because she's had a lot of varying symptoms over the years.

So, given all this, I think the correct answer is D: Somatic Symptom Disorder.
</think>

The patient is a 50-year-old woman with a long history of varying physical symptoms, no definitive medical cause identified despite extensive diagnostic workups, and multiple hospitalizations. She provides dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms and makes conflicting statements. The key is to determine the most likely diagnosis from the options provided.

- **Option A: Conversion Disorder** (now called Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) involves unexplained neurological symptoms linked to psychological factors. However, this patient has multiple physical symptoms across different systems, not just neurological ones, making this less likely.

- **Option B: Histrionic Personality Disorder** is characterized by dramatic, attention-seeking behavior and excessive emotionality. While the patient’s dramatic descriptions and conflicting statements might suggest this, the primary issue here is her unexplained physical symptoms, which are better explained by another diagnosis.

- **Option C: Occult Medical Disorder** refers to a hidden medical condition that has not yet been diagnosed. However, the question specifies that extensive tests and consultations have found no definitive cause, making this unlikely.

- **Option D: Somatic Symptom Disorder** involves chronic physical symptoms that cause significant distress and excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the symptoms. This diagnosis aligns well with the patient’s history of multiple, unexplained physical symptoms, high hospitalization rate, and excessive concern about her symptoms despite negative medical findings.

Given the patient’s presentation and history, the most likely diagnosis is **Somatic Symptom Disorder**.
