Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a couple and the work it does when rotating a shaft. Hmm, I remember that a couple is a pair of forces that cause rotation, and the moment of a couple is the measure of its turning effect. The moment is given as M = θ² + 2θ ft-lb, and θ is in radians. The question is asking how much work the couple does when it rotates the shaft by 60 degrees. 

Wait, work done by a couple... Oh right, work done by a torque (which is the moment here) is calculated by the integral of torque with respect to the angular displacement. The formula I think is W = ∫ M dθ from the initial angle to the final angle. Since the torque here varies with θ, I can't just multiply torque by angle; I have to integrate.

So the moment M is given as θ² + 2θ. The shaft rotates 60 degrees, but wait, θ needs to be in radians. Oh right, because the formula for M uses θ in radians. I should convert 60 degrees to radians. 60 degrees is π/3 radians, which is approximately 1.0472 radians.

The initial angle is 0 (I assume, since it's not stated otherwise) and the final angle is π/3 radians. So the work done is the integral from 0 to π/3 of (θ² + 2θ) dθ.

Let me set that up. The integral of θ² is (1/3)θ³ and the integral of 2θ is (2*(1/2))θ² = θ². So putting it all together, the integral from 0 to θ is (1/3 θ³ + θ²) evaluated from 0 to π/3.

Wait, wait. No, wait a second. Wait, when integrating from 0 to θ, the general case. So for the definite integral from 0 to θ, the work W would be [ (1/3)θ³ + θ² ] evaluated at θ = π/3 minus evaluated at 0. At 0, both terms are zero, so W is just (1/3)(π/3)^3 + (π/3)^2.

Let me compute that step by step. Let me calculate each term.

First term: (1/3)*(π/3)^3.

(π/3)^3 is (π³)/(3³) = π³/27. Multiply by 1/3 gives π³/(81).

Second term: (π/3)^2 is π²/9.

So W = π³/(81) + π²/9. Let me compute these numerically.

Let me get the value of π, approximately 3.1416.

Compute first term: (3.1416)^3 = approx 31.006. Divided by 81: 31.006 /81 ≈ 0.3827.

Second term: (3.1416)^2 ≈ 9.8696. Divided by 9: approx 1.0966.

Adding them together: 0.3827 + 1.0966 ≈ 1.4793 ft-lb.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option D is 1.48 ft-lb. That's very close to my calculation. But wait, let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, wait a second. Oh wait, no, the moment M is given as θ² + 2θ ft-lb. So the torque varies with θ. The work done is the integral from initial θ (which I assumed as 0) to final θ (π/3). So yes, the integral of M dθ is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: did I compute the integral correctly? Let me double-check the integral.

The integral of θ² dθ is (θ^3)/3, correct. Integral of 2θ dθ is θ^2. So yes, the antiderivative is (θ³/3 + θ²). Evaluated at θ = π/3.

So ( ( (π/3)^3 ) /3 ) + (π/3)^2.

Wait wait, no—wait, (θ³/3 + θ²) is the antiderivative. So when I plug in θ=π/3, it's ( (π/3)^3 ) /3 + (π/3)^2.

Wait no, no. Because θ³/3 is (θ^3)/3, so when θ is π/3, that term is ( (π/3)^3 ) /3 = π³/(3^4) )= π³/(81), correct. And the θ² term is (π/3)^2 = π²/9.

So adding them: π³/81 + π²/9.

Which is approximately 0.3827 + 1.0966 ≈ 1.4793. So about 1.48 ft-lb.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1.48 ft-lb. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any terms. Did I compute the integral correctly? Let me recalculate the numerical values.

Compute π³: 3.1416^3 is 3.1416 * 3.1416 = ~9.8696, then 9.8696 * 3.1416 ≈ 31.006.

π³/81: 31.006 /81 = approximately 0.3827.

π²: (3.1416)^2 = ~9.8696. Divide by 9: 1.0966.

Adding 0.3827 + 1.0966: 1.4793, which rounds to 1.48. So D is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute each term more precisely.

Compute π³:

3.14159265^3 = ?

3.14159265 * 3.14159265 = 9.8696044.

Then multiply by 3.14159265:

9.8696044 * 3.14159265 ≈ let's compute this.

9 * 3.14159265 = 28.2743338.

0.8696044 * 3.14159265 ≈ 0.8696 *3.1416 ≈ 2.73.

So total approximately 28.2743 + 2.73 = 31.0043.

So π³ ≈31.006.

π³/81: 31.006 /81 = 0.382716.

π²=9.8696.

π²/9=1.096644.

Adding them: 0.382716 + 1.096644 = 1.47936, which is approximately 1.48.

So the answer is D: 1.48 ft-lb.

To determine the work done by the couple, we use the formula for work as the integral of the moment \( M \) with respect to angular displacement \( \theta \):  

\[
W = \int M \, d\theta
\]

The moment of the couple is given as \( M = \theta^2 + 2\theta \) (in ft-lb), and the shaft rotates through an angular displacement of \( 60^\circ \), which is equivalent to \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \) radians. Assuming the initial angle is \( 0 \), the work done is:

\[
W = \int_0^{\pi/3} (\theta^2 + 2\theta) \, d\theta
\]

The integral of \( \theta^2 \) is \( \frac{\theta^3}{3} \), and the integral of \( 2\theta \) is \( \theta^2 \). Thus, the antiderivative is:

\[
W = \left[ \frac{\theta^3}{3} + \theta^2 \right]_0^{\pi/3}
\]

Evaluating this at \( \theta = \pi/3 \):

1. First term:  
   \[
   \frac{(\pi/3)^3}{3} = \frac{\pi^3}{81}
   \]

2. Second term:  
   \[
   (\pi/3)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{9}
   \]

Adding these together:

\[
W = \frac{\pi^3}{81} + \frac{\pi^2}{9}
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

1. Compute \( \pi^3 \):  
   \[
   \pi^3 \approx 31.006
   \]

2. Compute \( \frac{\pi^3}{81} \):  
   \[
   \frac{\pi^3}{81} \approx 0.3827
   \]

3. Compute \( \pi^2 \):  
   \[
   \pi^2 \approx 9.8696
   \]

4. Compute \( \frac{\pi^2}{9} \):  
   \[
   \frac{\pi^2}{9} \approx 1.0966
   \]

Adding these results:

\[
W \approx 0.3827 + 1.0966 = 1.4793 \, \text{ft-lb}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( W \approx 1.48 \, \text{ft-lb} \).

From the given options, the closest match is **D: 1.48 ft-lb**.
