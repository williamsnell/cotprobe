Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Arnold Gesell and his significance to the history of school psychology. I'm a bit rusty on my educational psychology history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Gesell was an early figure in developmental psychology. I think he worked a lot with children, maybe focusing on their development stages. Oh wait, Gesell is known for his theories on child development, particularly the maturationist view. Maturationist theory suggests that children develop through a series of stages that are predetermined and influenced by genetics, and that these stages happen naturally as the child matures.

The question is about his contribution specifically to school psychology. So I need to connect his work to school psychology practices. School psychology often involves assessment, interventions, and understanding how children learn and develop in educational settings.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Developed the first standardized test for elementary school children. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I know Binet and Simon did early IQ tests, and maybe Gesell's work influenced later assessments, but I don't recall him creating the first standardized test specifically for schools.

Option B: Introduced emotional intelligence in education. That sounds more like Daniel Goleman's work, not Gesell. So probably not B.

Option C: Created a classification system for learning disabilities. I don't think Gesell did that. The DSM has classifications, but I don't remember Gesell being involved in that area.

Option D: Developed a TAT for children. The Thematic Apperception Test was created by Murray, I believe. Gesell might have used projective tests, but I don't think he created a version of TAT specifically.

Option E: Identified four major cognitive periods. That sounds like Piaget with his stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete, formal. So E is probably Piaget, not Gesell.

Option F: Advocated inclusion of special needs. I'm not sure. Gesell's work was more about normal development, but I don't remember him specifically pushing for inclusion. Maybe later psychologists did that.

Option G: Established ethical standards for NASP. I don't think so. The ethical standards are more about the organization's own history, not tied directly to Gesell.

Option H: Pioneered psychoanalysis in schools. Freud is the big name in psychoanalysis. I don't think Gesell was a psychoanalyst; his work was more about normal development and maturation.

Option I: Devised a normative assessment for infants and young children. Oh, this rings a bell. Gesell did create some assessment tools. I think he developed schedules or tests to measure developmental milestones in young children. His work was about understanding typical development, so maybe he created some kind of assessment for infants.

Option J: Established the first school psychology graduate program. I'm not certain about this. I know Lightner Witmer is often credited with starting the first psychology clinic and possibly the first program, but maybe Gesell started a school psychology program.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. Gesell's work was more about child development, and he did create some assessment tools. So looking back, option I says he devised a prototypical normative assessment for infants and young children. That sounds right. I think Gesell developed the Gesell Developmental Schedules, which assess various developmental milestones in children. These were used to evaluate whether a child's development was on track.

So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the options. Let me double-check the other options to make sure. Option A is about standardized tests for elementary kids. That might be someone like Lewis Terman, who developed the Stanford-Binet. Gesell's assessments were more for younger children, so A doesn't fit.

Option J is about the first graduate program. I think the first school psychology program was established by Witmer, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe Gesell started one, but I'm not recalling that specifically.

So, I think the correct answer is I: devised a prototypical normative assessment for infants and young children.

Arnold Gesell is best known for his work in developmental psychology, particularly his maturationist theory, which emphasizes that children develop through predetermined stages influenced by genetics. His contributions to school psychology are closely tied to assessment tools. Among the options provided, Gesell is recognized for devising a prototypical normative assessment for infants and young children, known as the Gesell Developmental Schedules. This tool evaluates developmental milestones and aligns with his focus on typical child development. Other options, such as standardized tests for elementary school children or establishing graduate programs, are more associated with other figures like Lewis Terman or Lightner Witmer. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I

Answer: I
