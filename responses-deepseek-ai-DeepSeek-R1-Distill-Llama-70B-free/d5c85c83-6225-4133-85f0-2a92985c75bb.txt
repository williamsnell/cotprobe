Question:

What is meant by a hydrostatic skeleton? In which organisms is such a structure found?

Options:

A: A hydrostatic skeleton is the rigid internal structure found in birds and mammals.
B: A hydrostatic skeleton refers to the muscular system in humans and other primates.
C: A hydrostatic skeleton is composed of gas-filled chambers that provide buoyancy in fish.
D: A hydrostatic skeleton is a hard shell covering the body
E: A hydrostatic skeleton is the body cavity filled with air that is found in spiders and insects.
F: A hydrostatic skeleton is a network of bones that provide support in amphibians and reptiles.
G: A hydrostatic skeleton is the noncompressible fluid contents of the body cavity in organisms like Cnidarians, flatworms, and annelids.
H: A hydrostatic skeleton is the flexible cartilage found in sharks and rays.
I: A hydrostatic skeleton is only found in vertebrates
J: A hydrostatic skeleton is the external structure of insects

Okay, so I have this question about a hydrostatic skeleton. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let's think this through. I remember that skeletons come in different types, like endoskeletons and exoskeletons. Hydrostatic skeleton sounds familiar, but I'm not exactly sure what it refers to.

Wait, hydrostatic... that probably has something to do with fluid. So maybe it's a structure that uses fluid pressure to maintain shape. I think some invertebrates use this. Like earthworms maybe? Or jellyfish? Oh right, Cnidarians have something like that. They have a body structure supported by fluid pressure.

So, the question is asking what a hydrostatic skeleton is and in which organisms it's found. The options are from A to J. Let's go through them.

Option A: Rigid internal structure in birds and mammals. Hmm, no, birds and mammals have endoskeletons made of bones, which are rigid but not hydrostatic.

Option B: Muscular system in humans and primates. That doesn't sound right. Muscles are different from skeleton structures.

Option C: Gas-filled chambers in fish for buoyancy. I know some fish have swim bladders, but that's not a skeleton. So C is probably not it.

Option D: Hard shell covering the body. That sounds like an exoskeleton, like in insects or crustaceans. So D is exoskeleton, not hydrostatic.

Option E: Body cavity filled with air in spiders and insects. Air-filled doesn't seem right. Hydrostatic is about fluid, not air. Spiders and insects have exoskeletons, so E might not be correct.

Option F: Network of bones in amphibians and reptiles. That's an endoskeleton, not hydrostatic.

Option G: Noncompressible fluid in the body cavity of Cnidarians, flatworms, and annelids. Oh yeah, that rings a bell. The body cavity filled with fluid that acts as a skeleton. So this sounds like the hydrostatic skeleton. For example, earthworms (annelids) use muscles to move by contracting against the fluid-filled coelom.

Option H: Flexible cartilage in sharks and rays. Sharks have cartilaginous endoskeletons, not hydrostatic.

Option I: Only in vertebrates. No, hydrostatic is in invertebrates.

Option J: External structure in insects. That's the exoskeleton again.

So the correct answer should be G. Hydrostatic skeleton is the fluid-filled body cavity providing support in Cnidarians, flatworms, and annelids.

A hydrostatic skeleton is a structure that relies on the pressure of noncompressible fluid within the body cavity to maintain shape and support movement. This type of skeleton is found in certain invertebrates, such as Cnidarians (e.g., jellyfish), flatworms, and annelids (e.g., earthworms). It allows these organisms to move and maintain their form without rigid structures like bones or exoskeletons.

The correct answer is G.
