Okay, so I've got this problem about information channels and error probability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says it's a three-input channel, and each input symbol is equally probable. Oh right, that means each symbol has a probability of 1/3. The channel matrix is given as:

| 0.5 0.3 0.2 |
| 0.2 0.3 0.5 |
| 0.3 0.3 0.4 |

Wait, I think the rows represent the input symbols, and the columns the output symbols. So for each input i, the output j probabilities are given in row i, column j.

The task is to find the error probability P_E using maximum-likelihood decision rule. So I remember that maximum likelihood means choosing the output symbol j for which the probability P(j|i) is the highest for a given input i. But wait, no, no. Wait, the decision rule for maximum likelihood is to choose the input that has the highest P(j|i) * P(i), but since P(i) is the same for all inputs (they're equally likely), it's equivalent to choosing the i that has the highest P(j|i). So for each output j, we pick the i that maximizes P(j|i). Or wait, no. Wait, the channel is from input to output, so when we receive a j, we want to find the most likely i that sent it. So the decision is based on the received j to pick the i that's most probable given j. Oh wait, but when using maximum likelihood, the decision is to choose the i that maximizes P(j|i) * P(i). Since P(i) is same for all, it's the same as choosing the i with maximum P(j|i).

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you receive j, you calculate for each possible i, the probability that i was sent given j. So P(i|j) is proportional to P(j|i) * P(i). Since P(i) is same for all, the maximum P(i|j) occurs for the i with the maximum P(j|i). So yes, for each j, the receiver picks the i which has the highest P(j|i) in that column.

So the error occurs when the output j is not the same as the input i. So to calculate P_E, I need to find for each input i, the probability that the maximum P(j|i) is not equal to P(i=i|j), or wait, more accurately, the probability that when input i is sent, the output is some j that's not equal to i, and j is such that for that j, the maximum P(j'|i') across i' is for some i' not equal to i.

Wait no, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each possible input i, the probability that the output j is not the one that would lead to a correct decision. So, for each i, determine which output j would be incorrectly chosen, and sum over all i the probabilities of i being sent and j being received, but j leading to an incorrect decision.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the probability of correct decision for each i, then subtract from 1 to get P_E.

So P_E = 1 - sum over i [ P(i) * P(correct| i sent) ]

Since all P(i) are 1/3, P_E is 1 - (1/3) * sum over i [ max_j (P(j|i)) ]

Wait, no. Because the correct decision is when the received j is such that when you look at column j, the maximum P(j|i) is for i. So for each column j, we see which row i has the highest P(j|i). Then, for each j, the probability that j is received when i is sent, and i is the correct one (because it's the maximum in that column). So the total correct probability is sum over j [ max_i (P(j|i)) * P(sent i) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about building a matrix where for each column j, we find the row i that has the maximum P(j|i). That i is the one that would be chosen when j is received. So for column j, the maximum P(j|i) is the maximum in that column. So for each j, the probability that j is received when that i is sent, multiplied by the probability that i is sent (1/3).

So let's look at each column:

Column 1: [0.5, 0.2, 0.3]. The maximum is 0.5 in row 1.

Column 2: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3]. Oh wait, all are equal. Hmm, so for column 2, any choice would be possible. But since all are equal, the decision could be any of the three. But in practice, how is this handled? Well, in maximum likelihood, when there's a tie, the receiver might choose arbitrarily, but for the purposes of calculating error probability, perhaps we have to account for the fact that some decisions could be wrong.

Wait, perhaps in such a case, each i tied for the maximum in column j would have an equal chance to be chosen. So when two or more i's have the same P(j|i) as the maximum in column j, the receiver picks one at random among them. So for column 2, since all three inputs have P(j=2|i)=0.3, the receiver would choose any of the three with equal probability, say 1/3 each.

But how does that affect the error probability? Because when j=2 is received, the receiver picks i randomly among 1,2,3. So the probability that the correct i is chosen is 1/3 (since the correct i would have P(j=2|i)=0.3, same as the others). So for j=2, the correct decision is made with probability 1/3.

Wait, but let's step back. Let me re-examine each column.

Column 1: j=1. The probabilities are 0.5 (i=1), 0.2 (i=2), 0.3 (i=3). So the maximum is 0.5 at i=1. So when j=1 is received, the receiver correctly chooses i=1. The probability of correct decision here is when i=1 sent, j=1 is received, which is 0.5. So P(correct | i=1) when j=1 is 0.5.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the receiver's decision is based on j. So for j=1, the receiver decides i=1. So the correct cases are when i=1 was sent and j=1 was received. The probability of this is P(i=1) * P(j=1|i=1) = (1/3)*0.5.

Similarly, for column 2, j=2, let's see. The P(j=2|i) for i=1 is 0.3, i=2 is 0.3, i=3 is 0.3. So all are equal. So when j=2 is received, the receiver picks i=1, 2, or 3 with equal probability. So the correct decision occurs only when i equals the chosen i. So for each i, when j=2 is received, the probability that the receiver correctly infers i is 1/3. So for example, if i=1 was sent, and j=2 is received, the probability that the receiver picks i=1 is 1/3. So the correct probability for i=1 is (1/3) * 0.3 (since P(j=2|i=1)=0.3), multiplied by 1/3 (probability of correct choice). Similarly for i=2 and i=3.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the total correct probability as:

sum over j [ max_i (P(j|i)) * P(i) ].

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because for each j, the maximum P(j|i) across i is the maximum in column j. Then, the probability that j is received when the correct i is sent is P(j|correct_i) * P(correct_i). But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps to compute the error probability, we need to find for each i, the probability that when i is sent, the output j is such that j is not the one that would be correctly decoded. So for each i, let's find the output j that would lead to an incorrect decision, and sum P(i) * P(j|i) for those j's.

So let's break it down for each i.

i=1: The correct decision is j=1, because in column 1, the maximum P(j=1|i=1)=0.5, which is higher than 0.2 and 0.3 for i=2 and i=3. So when i=1 is sent, the correct j is 1. So the probability of correct decision is P(j=1|i=1)=0.5. So the error occurs when j=2 or j=3, so P(error|i=1) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5.

i=2: Now, looking at column 2, j=2. All P(j=2|i) are 0.3. So when j=2 is received, the receiver chooses i randomly among 1,2,3. So the correct decision is when i=2 is chosen. So the probability of correct decision when i=2 is sent and j=2 is received is 1/3. So for i=2, the correct j would be j=2, but the probability that the receiver correctly picks i=2 is 1/3.

Wait, but perhaps I should think differently. For i=2, the correct j would be j=2, but since the receiver may not always pick i=2 when j=2 is received, perhaps it's better to compute for each i and j whether j would lead to a correct or incorrect decision.

Alternatively, perhaps for each i, find the j that would cause an error, i.e., when the receiver, upon receiving j, decides on an i' != i.

So for each i, let's find the j where the maximum P(j|i') occurs for some i' != i.

Wait, that's another approach. So for each i, when j is sent, the receiver will decide on i' where P(j|i') is maximum. So for each j, determine which i' gives the maximum P(j|i').

Wait, but in columns, for each j, find the i that gives the maximum in that column. Those are the cases where the receiver would decide on i when j is received.

So let's list for each j, which i's have the maximum P(j|i).

Looking back at the channel matrix:

Columns are j=1, j=2, j=3.

Column 1 (j=1):

P(j=1 | i=1) = 0.5

P(j=1 | i=2) = 0.2

P(j=1 | i=3) = 0.3

So maximum is 0.5 at i=1. So when j=1 is received, the receiver decides i=1.

Column 2 (j=2):

P(j=2 |i=1) = 0.3

P(j=2 |i=2) = 0.3

P(j=2 |i=3) = 0.3

All equal. So when j=2 is received, the receiver can't decide based on maximum, so perhaps any choice is made. But for error probability calculation, perhaps we can assume that the receiver picks uniformly among the tied i's. So for j=2, the receiver picks i=1, 2, or 3 with probability 1/3 each.

Column 3 (j=3):

P(j=3 |i=1) = 0.2

P(j=3 |i=2) = 0.5

P(j=3 |i=3) = 0.4

Maximum is 0.5 at i=2. So when j=3 is received, the receiver decides i=2.

Wait, but wait, no: 0.5 is the maximum in column 3. So yes, i=2 is chosen.

Wait, wait: 0.5 is the maximum, so for j=3, the receiver picks i=2.

Now, for each i, let's see when the receiver's decision is correct or incorrect.

i=1:

When j=1 is received, the receiver correctly chooses i=1.

When j=2 is received, the receiver picks i=1,2, or 3 with 1/3 chance. So the correct decision is when the receiver picks i=1. So the probability of correct decision when j=2 is received is 1/3.

When j=3 is received, the receiver picks i=2, which is incorrect. So for i=1, the receiver only correctly decides when j=1 is received, and in the case of j=2, sometimes correct.

Wait, no. Let me make a table for each i and each j to see whether the decision would be correct or not.

Let me make a table where rows are i, columns are j, and the cell indicates whether the decision would be correct when j is received after i was sent.

i=1:

j=1: decision i=1 → correct.

j=2: decision could be i=1, 2, or 3. So when j=2, the receiver picks i=1 with 1/3 probability → correct in that case.

j=3: decision is i=2 → incorrect.

i=2:

j=1: decision i=1 → incorrect.

j=2: decision could be i=1,2,3; if the receiver picks i=2, correct, else wrong.

So when j=2 is received, the probability of correct decision is 1/3.

j=3: decision i=2 → correct.

i=3:

j=1: decision i=1 → incorrect.

j=2: decision could be i=1,2,3. So correct only if i=3 is chosen, which is 1/3 probability.

j=3: decision i=2 → incorrect.

So for each i and j, compute the probability that the decision is correct.

Now, the overall correct probability P_C is sum over i, sum over j [ P(i) * P(j|i) * I(decision correct) ].

So let's compute each term.

For i=1:

j=1: P(i=1)=1/3, P(j=1|i=1)=0.5. Decision correct. So term is (1/3)*0.5*1 = 0.5/3.

j=2: P(i=1)=1/3, P(j=2|i=1)=0.3. Decision correct with probability 1/3. So term is (1/3)*0.3*(1/3) = 0.3/(9) = 0.033333...

j=3: P(i=1)=1/3, P(j=3|i=1)=0.2. Decision is i=2, so incorrect. So no contribution to correct.

Sum for i=1: 0.5/3 + 0.033333... = (0.5 + 0.033333...) / 3 → Wait, no, each term is (1/3)*something.

Wait, more accurately:

i=1:

- j=1: contributes (1/3) * 0.5 * 1 = (1/3)*0.5 = 1/6 ≈ 0.166666...

- j=2: contributes (1/3) * 0.3 * (1/3) = (1/3)*(0.1) = 0.033333...

- j=3: contributes 0.

So sum for i=1: 1/6 + 0.033333... = (0.166666... + 0.033333...) = 0.2.

For i=2:

j=1: P(j=1|i=2) =0.2. Decision is i=1, so incorrect. So no contribution.

j=2: P(j=2|i=2)=0.3. Decision correct with probability 1/3. So term is (1/3)*0.3*(1/3) = 0.03.

j=3: P(j=3|i=2)=0.5. Decision is i=2, correct. So term is (1/3)*0.5*1 = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.166666...

Sum for i=2: 0.03 + 0.166666... ≈ 0.196666...

For i=3:

j=1: P(j=1|i=3)=0.3. Decision is i=1, incorrect. So no contribution.

j=2: P(j=2|i=3)=0.3. Decision correct with probability 1/3. So term is (1/3)*0.3*(1/3) = 0.03.

j=3: P(j=3|i=3)=0.4. Decision is i=2, incorrect. So no contribution.

Sum for i=3: 0.03.

Wait, let me recalculate each correctly:

i=3:

j=1: 0.3, decision i=1 → wrong. So 0.

j=2: 0.3, correct with 1/3 → (1/3)*0.3*(1/3) = 0.03.

j=3: 0.4, decision i=2 → wrong. So 0.

So sum for i=3: 0.03.

Now, total P_C is sum of all contributions:

i=1: 0.2

i=2: 0.196666...

i=3: 0.03

Adding them up:

0.2 + 0.196666... = 0.396666...

0.396666... + 0.03 = 0.426666...

So P_C ≈ 0.426666..., which is 17/40? Wait, 0.426666... is 17/40 exactly? Wait, 17 divided by 40 is 0.425, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps it's 13/30, which is approximately 0.4333, but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me compute each part more accurately.

Compute each term:

For i=1:

j=1: 1/3 * 0.5 = 0.5/3 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1666667.

j=2: 1/3 * 0
