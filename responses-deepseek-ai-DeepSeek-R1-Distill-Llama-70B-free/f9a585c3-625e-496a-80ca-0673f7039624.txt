" Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?

Okay, so I've got this question about contracts and the statute of limitations. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a debtor owed a creditor $750, but on July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. Then, on August 1, the debtor and creditor met at a party. The creditor was telling mutual friends that the debtor is a deadbeat who welches on debts. Feeling guilty, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay the $750 by September 1. But when September 1st came, the debtor refused to pay. Now, the creditor is suing to get that $750 back. The question is about what makes the debtor's oral promise unenforceable.

The options given are A through D. I need to figure out which one is the strongest ground for the debtor's promise being unenforceable.

First, I remember that when a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, it means the creditor can't sue to recover it. But if the debtor makes a new promise to pay, that can revive the debt, right? But there are some requirements for that new promise to be enforceable.

I think one of the key points here is consideration. For a contract to be valid, there needs to be consideration, which is something of value exchanged between the parties. Now, when the original debt was barred, the creditor can't enforce it. If the debtor then promises to pay, is there consideration for that promise?

Wait, the pre-existing duty rule comes into play. Normally, a promise to do something you're already legally bound to do isn't sufficient consideration. But in this case, the original debt was already barred, so the debtor wasn't legally obligated anymore. So the debtor's promise to pay might be seen as a new promise. But wait, is there any new consideration here?

I think in cases where a debt is past the statute of limitations, a new promise to pay it needs to be supported by new consideration to be enforceable. If there's no new consideration, the promise might not be binding because it's not supported by anything.

Looking at the options, option A says it was not supported by new consideration. That seems relevant because without new consideration, the promise might not be enforceable. But I should consider the other options too.

Option B is about the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing. However, this is an oral promise to pay a debt, which usually doesn't fall under the statute of frauds. So I don't think B is the right answer.

Option C says the debt was already barred by the statute of limitations. But if the debtor makes a new promise, that can take the debt out of the statute. So even if it was barred before, the new promise might make it enforceable again. So C might not be the strongest ground.

Option D is about mutuality of obligation. I'm not too sure about this one. Mutuality means both parties are bound. Here, the debtor is making a promise, but is there any obligation from the creditor? Maybe not, but I don't think that's the main issue here.

Wait, but I thought that a promise to pay a debt that's been discharged doesn't require consideration if it's made in a way that the creditor relies on it. Or maybe under the theory of promissory estoppel? But in this case, the creditor didn't do anything in reliance since the promise was just made and then broken.

So going back, the main issue is whether the new promise is supported by consideration. If the debtor's promise was made without any new consideration, the creditor can't enforce it because there's nothing of value exchanged.

So the correct answer should be A: It was not supported by new consideration.

The question revolves around whether the debtor's oral promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations is enforceable. When a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, the creditor can no longer enforce it. However, a new promise to pay can revive the debt, but it must meet certain legal requirements.

Key to this scenario is the concept of consideration. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be something of value exchanged between the parties. In this case, the original debt was no longer legally enforceable, so the debtor was not under a legal obligation to pay it. A promise to pay a barred debt can only be enforceable if supported by new consideration. Here, there is no indication of any new considerationâ€”the debtor's guilt and the oral promise alone do not constitute new consideration.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The absence of new consideration means the promise lacks the necessary legal foundation to be enforceable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The statute of frauds does not apply here, as this is not one of the specific types of contracts required to be in writing.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While the debt was barred, a valid new promise could revive it, so this is not the strongest ground.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Mutuality of obligation is not the central issue in this case.

The strongest ground for the debtor's promise being unenforceable is the lack of new consideration.

Answer: A
