Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bookstore trying to maximize its profit per book. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The bookstore can buy 200 anthropology textbooks for $3 each from the publisher. They plan to sell each book for $15, but they know that for every 50-cent reduction in the price, they can sell 10 more books. The question is, what's the optimal price point that maximizes their profit per book?

Hmm, so first, I need to understand the variables involved. The cost per book is fixed at $3. The selling price is variable, starting at $15 and decreasing by $0.50 increments. For each of these increments, the number of books they can sell increases by 10.

Wait, but the initial number of books they have is 200. So if they reduce the price, they can sell more than 200, but wait—do they have more than 200 books? Oh, wait, the problem says the store can obtain 200 books from the publisher. So are they limited to selling 200, or can they get more? Hmm, the way the question is phrased, it says "can obtain 200...". But then it says "can sell these books"—so perhaps they have 200 copies, and the question is about how many of those 200 they can sell based on the price. So the number sold depends on the price.

Wait, but the way it's worded might suggest that if they lower the price by 50 cents, they can sell 10 more books. So starting from 200, if they drop the price by 0.50, they can sell 210. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the initial plan is to sell 200 at $15 each. But if they lower the price, they sell more. So the number of books sold (let's call it Q) is 200 plus 10 times the number of 50-cent reductions. 

So let me model this. Let me define x as the number of 50-cent reductions. So each x is a reduction of $0.50. Then the selling price per book would be 15 - 0.50x.

The quantity sold, Q, would be 200 + 10x because for each x (each 50-cent drop), they sell 10 more books. 

Now, profit per book would be selling price minus cost per book. But wait, total profit is (price - cost) * quantity. But the question asks for profit per book, which I think is the same as contribution margin, i.e., price minus cost. Wait, no, because if that's the case, then higher price would always mean higher profit per book, which doesn't make sense because selling more at a lower price could lead to higher total profit. But the question is about maximizing profit per book, not total profit.

Wait, wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, "What is the price that maximizes its profit per book?" So profit per book would be (selling price - cost per book). But that seems too straightforward, because the selling price is what's being varied. So if you lower the price, the profit per book goes down, but you sell more books. But the question is about profit per book, not total profit. So in that case, to maximize profit per book, you would set the highest possible price, which is $15. But that can't be right because option E is $15, but let's make sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is about maximizing total profit, but phrased differently. Alternatively, maybe it's about maximizing profit per unit, which would still be (price - cost), so higher price is better.

But that can't be, because the options don't have E as the answer. Let me look at the options: option E is $15, which is the highest price. If the goal is to maximize per-book profit, then $15 would be correct. But I'm not sure because the question mentions varying the price and the quantity sold. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the cost is not just $3 per book, but maybe there's a fixed cost involved. But the problem doesn't mention any fixed costs beyond the cost per book. It says the store can obtain the books for $3 each, so variable cost is $3 per book. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is about maximizing total profit, not per-book. But the question says "profit per book". Hmm. Let me think again. Profit per book is (price - cost). So each book sold contributes (price - cost) to total profit. So if the price is higher, each book's contribution is higher, but fewer books are sold. So if the goal is to maximize per-book profit, the highest possible price is best. But that would mean $15, which is option E.

But why would the question give all these other options? Maybe the question is actually about total profit, but the wording is confusing. Let me re-read the question.

"A bookstore can obtain from a publisher 200 anthropology textbooks for $3 each. The store believes it can sell these books at $15 each, but will be able to sell 10 more for every 50 cent reduction in the price. What is the price that maximizes its profit per book?"

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting "profit per book". Maybe it's total profit divided by the number of books sold. So per-book profit would be total profit divided by quantity sold. In that case, we need to calculate (total revenue - total cost) / quantity.

So total revenue is price * quantity. Total cost is 3 * quantity, since each book costs $3. So profit is (price - 3) * quantity. Then, per-book profit would be (price -3). Wait, no: profit per book would be (price - 3), because each book's cost is $3. So that's the same as before. So the per-book profit is (price -3), which is maximized when price is highest, so $15.

But that can't be right, because then the answer would be E, $15. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually about maximizing total profit, not per-book. Let me try calculating that.

If the question is about maximizing total profit, then we can model it as follows.

Let x be the number of 50-cent reductions. So price per book is 15 - 0.5x.

The quantity sold is 200 +10x.

Total revenue is (15 -0.5x) * (200 +10x).

Total cost is 3*(200 +10x).

Total profit is revenue minus cost: (15 -0.5x)(200+10x) - 3(200+10x).

We can expand this:

= [15*(200) +15*(10x) -0.5x*(200) -0.5x*(10x)] - [600 +30x]

= [3000 +150x -100x -5x²] -600 -30x

= (3000 +50x -5x²) -600 -30x

= 2400 +20x -5x²

So the total profit is -5x² +20x +2400.

This is a quadratic equation, opening downward. The maximum is at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/(2a), where a=-5, b=20.

x = -20/(2*(-5)) = -20/-10 = 2.

So x=2. So the price reduction is 2 * 0.5 = $1. So the selling price is 15 -1 = $14.

So the price that maximizes total profit is $14, which is option G.

Wait, but the question is about maximizing profit per book, not total profit. So I'm a bit confused. Because if the question is about per-book profit, then it's (price -3), which is maximized at the highest price, $15. But the way I read the question, perhaps it's about maximizing per-book profit, but maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about maximizing per-book profit, which would be (price -3). That would be highest at $15, but maybe the way the problem is structured, the per-book profit is also a function of quantity sold, but I'm not sure that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is trying to trick me. Maybe it's saying that the cost per book is 3, so the per-book profit would be (price -3). So that's simple. But then why the question about varying the price and the number sold? Because that affects total profit, not per-book profit.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to maximize total profit, but the question says per book. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the question is about maximizing total profit, which would lead to option G, $14.

But let me think again: if the question is about per-book profit, then the answer is $15, option E. But that seems too straightforward, and the fact that the problem gives data about how many more books are sold suggests that it's about total profit.

Alternatively, perhaps the per-book profit is meant to be calculated as (total profit)/(number of books sold). So let's model that.

Total profit is (price -3) * quantity.

Per-book profit would be (price -3) * quantity / quantity = (price -3). So again, it's the same as before. So per-book profit is (price -3), which is maximized at the highest price, $15.

But in that case, why is the answer not E?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.

The store can obtain 200 textbooks. So they have 200 books. They can sell all 200 at $15, but if they lower the price by 50 cents, they can sell 10 more than 200. So the number sold is 200 +10x, where x is the number of 50-cent reductions.

So the maximum they can sell is 200 +10x, but only if they have enough books. But since they have 200, if x is 0, they sell 200. If x is 1, they can sell 210, but they only have 200. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the number sold is min(200 +10x, 200). No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the store can only sell up to 200 books because that's all they have. So when the price drops, they can sell more, but if the number exceeds 200, then they can't sell more than 200.

Wait, that changes things. Because if x is the number of 50-cent reductions, then the quantity they can sell is 200 +10x. But since they only have 200 books, the actual quantity sold is the minimum of (200 +10x) and 200. So if x is 0, they sell 200. If x is 1, they can sell 210, but they only have 200, so they can only sell 200. So in reality, reducing the price beyond a certain point doesn't increase the quantity sold beyond 200.

Wait, that makes more sense. So for any x >=0, the quantity sold is 200, because they can't sell more than they have. But that contradicts the problem statement, which says "will be able to sell 10 more for every 50 cent reduction in price."

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let me model the problem as if the bookstore can obtain as many books as needed from the publisher at $3 each, and they can sell as many as they want based on the price. So the quantity sold depends on the price.

In that case, the problem becomes a typical demand and cost scenario where the bookstore adjusts the price to maximize profit.

So let me proceed with that assumption.

Let me define x as the number of 50-cent reductions. So price p = 15 -0.5x.

The quantity sold Q is 200 +10x.

Total revenue TR = p * Q = (15 -0.5x)(200 +10x).

Total cost TC = 3 * Q = 3*(200 +10x).

Total profit π = TR - TC = (15 -0.5x)(200 +10x) - 3*(200 +10x).

Expanding TR:

15*200 = 3000

15*10x = 150x

-0.5x *200 = -100x

-0.5x *10x = -5x²

So TR = 3000 +150x -100x -5x² = 3000 +50x -5x².

TC = 3*(200 +10x) = 600 +30x.

So π = (3000 +50x -5x²) - (600 +30x) = 2400 +20x -5x².

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x, π = -5x² +20x +2400.

The maximum profit occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/(2a) = -20/(2*(-5)) = 2.

So x=2. Thus, the price p =15 -0.5*2=14.

So the optimal price is $14, which is option G.

But wait, the question is about profit per book, not total profit. So perhaps I need to calculate per-book profit, which is π/Q.

π = -5x² +20x +2400.

Q=200 +10x.

So per-book profit = (π)/Q = (-5x² +20x +2400)/(200 +10x).

But when x=2, Q=200 +20=220.

π at x=2 is -5*(4) +20*(2) +2400 = -20 +40 +2400= 2420.

So per-book profit is 2420/220 ≈ 11.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A-J, with H being $13, G $14, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the question is about the price that maximizes profit per book, and I thought earlier that it's simply (price -3), which is maximized at $15, but that doesn't fit with the data given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the per-book profit is (price -3), which is (15 -0.5x -3)=12 -0.5x. So to maximize this, x=0, so $15.

But that would suggest option E is correct, but then why include all the other data?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about maximizing total profit, and the correct answer is $14, option G.

But the question explicitly says "profit per book". So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the cost is $3 per book, but the store has a fixed number of books, 200. So if they lower the price, they can sell more than 200, but they can't because they only have 200. So the maximum they can sell is 200. So the only way to increase sales beyond that is to get more books, but the problem says they can obtain 200 from the publisher. So perhaps they can't get more, so the maximum they can sell is 200, meaning that reducing the price doesn't increase sales beyond 200. So in that case, the optimal price would be $15, because any price reduction would lower per-book profit without increasing sales.

But that can't be right because the problem says they can sell 10 more for each 50-cent reduction. So perhaps the initial stock is 200, but they can get more from the publisher if needed. So the number sold is 200 +10x, and they can obtain that many from the publisher. So the cost is 3 per book, regardless of how many they obtain.

So in that case, the earlier calculation holds, and the optimal price is $14, option G.

But the question is about profit per book, which would be (price -3). So at x=2, price is 14, so per-book profit is 11. But the options don't have 11 as a price; option A is $11. Wait, but $11 is a price, not a profit per book.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: 

Profit per book is (price - cost per book) = (p -3). So when p=14, profit per book is 11. So the profit per book is $11. But the question is asking for the price that maximizes this. So the price is 14, which leads to a per-book profit of 11. So the answer would be G, $14, because that's the price that leads to the maximum per-book profit.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because per-book profit is (price -3), which is highest when price is highest. So if the price can be increased beyond 15, the per-book profit would be higher, but the problem states that the initial price is 15, and they can lower it to sell more.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's model it correctly.

If the price is reduced by 50 cents x times, then the price is 15 -0.5x.

The number sold is 200 +10x.

But the cost per book is 3, so per-book profit is (15 -0.5x -3)=12 -0.5x.

Wait, so per-book profit decreases as x increases. So to maximize per-book profit, x should be as small as possible, which is x=0, leading to price 15, per-book profit 12.

But that contradicts the earlier calculation where total profit is maximized at x=2, price 14, per-book profit 11.

So the question is, what is the price that maximizes profit per book. If profit per book is (price -3), then the maximum is at x=0, price 15, per-book profit 12.

But that would mean the answer is E, $15. However, I thought the earlier approach where total profit is maximized at x=2, leading to price 14, is the intended approach, but the question is about per-book profit.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the definition of profit per book. If it's (price - cost), then it's maximized at the highest price. But if it's considering the total profit divided by the number of books sold, then it's a different calculation.

Let me compute that. Total profit is (price -3)*quantity. So per-book profit would be (total profit)/quantity = (price -3).

Wait, that's the same as before. So regardless of how you calculate it, per-book profit is (price -3), which is highest at the highest price.

But that can't be right because when
