Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about cultures in the Southwest, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see... The question is asking which culture lived a primarily sedentary lifestyle in the Southwest. The options are A through J, each representing a different culture.

First, I need to remember what each of these cultures is known for. I think the key here is understanding which ones were sedentary versus nomadic. Sedentary means they stayed in one place, probably farming, while nomadic groups moved around a lot, maybe following game.

Option A is Mogollon. I remember that the Mogollon culture was one of the early groups in the Southwest, along with the Anasazi and Hohokam. They were known for their pottery and settled agriculture, so they were likely sedentary.

Option B is Navajo. I know the Navajo are a Native American tribe, but I think they were more nomadic, especially since they were herders and moved around with their livestock. But wait, maybe not... I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think the Navajo might have been semi-nomadic, but perhaps not as settled as others.

Option C is Clovis. Clovis culture is one of the earliest in the Americas, known for their big game hunting. They were definitely nomadic, following large animals like mammoths, so they wouldn't be the answer here.

Option D is Paleo-Indians. Paleo-Indians are the earliest inhabitants, and they were hunter-gatherers, so they moved around a lot. Not sedentary.

Option E is Hopewell. Hopewell culture was in the Eastern part of North America, known for their earthworks and trade. They might have been more settled, but the question is about the Southwest, so probably not the right choice.

Option F is Inca. Incas were in South America, so that's out of the question since the question is about the Southwest, which is in North America.

Option G is Adena. Adena was another Eastern culture, known for their mounds. Again, not the Southwest.

Option H is Kwakiutl. They were from the Pacific Northwest, so definitely not the Southwest.

Option I is Mississippian. Mississippi culture was in the Eastern and Midwestern areas, like Cahokia. They were sedentary, building mounds, but not in the Southwest.

Option J is Apache. Apache tribes were known for being nomadic, moving around the Plains and Southwest. So they were likely not sedentary.

So, going back to the options, the ones that are from the Southwest are A, B, and J. Between these, Mogollon (A) were sedentary, Navajo (B) might have been semi-nomadic or not as settled, and Apache (J) were definitely nomadic. So the answer should be A: Mogollon.

The Mogollon culture was known for its settled agriculture and pottery, indicating a sedentary lifestyle in the Southwest. Other options like Navajo and Apache were more nomadic, while the others were from different regions or time periods.

Answer: A
