Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the frustration-displaced aggression theory of prejudice. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that this theory has something to do with frustration leading to aggression. I think it's related to how people sometimes take out their frustrations on others when they can't address the real source. Like, if someone is stressed at work but can't yell at their boss, they might come home and snap at a family member instead.

So, applying that to prejudice, maybe the theory suggests that when people are frustrated because they can't achieve something they want, they might displace that aggression onto a different group. This group becomes a scapegoat because the original source of frustration is either too powerful or not easily accessible.

Looking at the options:

A says it's about a lack of understanding. I don't think that's right. This theory is more about redirecting frustration.

B talks about learned behavior from parents or society. That sounds more like the social learning theory, where people learn through observing and imitating others.

C says it's about personality type, unaffected by circumstances. That doesn't fit because the theory is about external circumstances causing frustration.

D claims it's innate and unchangeable. I don't think so. The theory is about situations causing the behavior, not being inborn.

E describes frustration leading to aggression, and if the source is unavailable, the aggression is displaced onto a scapegoat. This matches what I was thinking earlier.

F links prejudice to stress levels. While related, the specific idea of displacement isn't captured here.

G mentions competition for resources. That's more like realistic conflict theory, where groups compete, leading to prejudice.

H talks about self-esteem as a defense mechanism. That's another theory, perhaps related to psychodynamic theories.

I is about feeling powerless, which might tie into some theories, but not exactly the frustration-displacement.

J mentions justifying attitudes with logic or morality. That sounds like cognitive dissonance or rationalization, not the frustration theory.

So the correct answer should be E. It directly states that frustration leads to displaced aggression when the source is unavailable, acting as a scapegoat.

The frustration-displaced aggression theory of prejudice explains that when individuals experience frustration due to an obstacle preventing them from achieving a goal, they may redirect their aggression toward a more accessible target, often a scapegoat, especially when the original source of frustration is unavailable or threatening. This aligns with option E, which accurately describes the theory.

E: The frustration-displaced aggression theory of prejudice states that frustration toward the accomplishment of some goal produces aggression; if the source of the frustration is too threatening or unavailable, the aggression will be displaced onto a scapegoat.

Answer: E
