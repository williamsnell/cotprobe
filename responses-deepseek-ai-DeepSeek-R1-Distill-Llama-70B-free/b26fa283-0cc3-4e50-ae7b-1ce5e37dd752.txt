Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I have this problem about finding 9's and 10's complements of several decimal numbers. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me remember what 9's complement is. The 9's complement of a number is found by subtracting each digit from 9. So for example, the 9's complement of 1234 would be 8765 because 1→8, 2→7, 3→6, 4→5. 

The 10's complement, on the other hand, is the 9's complement plus 1. So taking the same example, 1234's 10's complement would be 8765 + 1 = 8766. Alternatively, I could think of it as subtracting the number from the next power of 10. For numbers with n digits, it's 10^n - number.

Wait, but wait—what happens if the number has leading zeros? Like in option (c) 09900, which is a 5-digit number. When computing complements, each digit is treated individually, so leading zeros would be treated as 9's in their complement. Hmm, I need to be careful with that.

Let me go through each part step by step.

Part (a): 13579.

It's a 5-digit number. So for 9's complement:

1 → 8
3 → 6
5 → 4
7 → 2
9 → 0

So the 9's complement would be 86420. Then the 10's complement is 86420 + 1 = 86421.

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, 10^5 is 100000. So 100000 - 13579 = 86421. So the 9's complement is 86420, 10's is 86421. So for part (a), the 9's is 86420, 10's is 86421.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says (a) 9's is 86419, 10's 86420. That doesn't match.

Option F: (a) 86421 and 86422. Wait, no, because 9's is 86420, and 10's is 86421. So F is not correct for (a). Let me check others.

Looking at option J: (a) 86420 and 86421. So that's correct for (a). Wait, but looking further.

Part (b): 90090.

It's a 5-digit number. Let's compute 9's complement:

9→0, 0→9, 0→9, 9→0, 0→9. So 09909? Wait, no, wait: 9 0 0 9 0.

Wait each digit:

9 → 0

0 →9

0→9

9→0

0→9

So the 9's complement is 09909. But wait, wait, 90090 has digits 9,0,0,9,0. So 9's complement: 0,9,9,0,9. So 09909.

Then 10's complement is 09909 + 1 = 09910.

Alternatively, 10^5 = 100000. 100000 -90090 = 9910. Wait wait, that's only 4 digits. Oh no, wait—because 90090 is a 5-digit number, the 10's complement should be a 5-digit number. So 100000 -90090 = 9910, but that's only 4 digits. Oh, because 90090 is 5 digits, the result would be 09910 as a 5-digit number. So 10's complement is 09910.

So for part (b), 9's is 09909, 10's is 09910.

Looking at the options:

Option F says for (b) 09910 and 09911. No, because for (b)'s 9's is 09909, 10's is 09910. So maybe looking elsewhere.

Option J: (b) 09909 and 09910. So that's correct for (b). So far, J is looking good for (a) and (b).

Wait, no. Let me check the options again. Looking through each option:

Option J: (a) 86420 and 86421. (b) 09909 and 09910. (c) 90099 and 90100. (d) 90000 and 89999. (e) 9999 and 10000.

Wait, part (c) is 09900.

So 09900 is a 5-digit number. 9's complement:

0→9, 9→0, 9→0, 0→9, 0→9.

Wait, wait, 09900 is 0 9 9 0 0.

So each digit's 9's complement:

0→9

9→0

9→0

0→9

0→9

So 9's complement is 90099.

Then 10's complement is 90099 + 1 = 90100.

So for (c), 9's is 90099, 10's is 90100.

Looking at the options, let's see which options match. Option J says (c) 90099 and 90100. So that's correct.

So (a), (b), (c) in option J are correct.

What about part (d): 10000.

It's a 5-digit number. 1 followed by four zeros.

9's complement: 1→8, 0→9, 0→9, 0→9, 0→9. So 89999.

10's complement: 10^5 -10000 = 90000.

So 9's is 89999, 10's is 90000.

Looking at option J, (d) 90000 and 89999. Wait, no, that's reversed. Wait, option J says (d) 90000 and 89999. But according to our calculation, 9's is 89999, 10's is 90000. So in option J, (d) has 9's as 90000, which would be incorrect. So J's (d) is wrong.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if (d) in J is 90000 and 89999, that's the opposite of what it should be. So J can't be correct.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, 10000: 9's complement is 89999, 10's is 90000.

So the correct 9's is 89999, 10's 90000.

Looking at the options:

Option B: (d) 89998 and 89999. No.

Option D: (d) 90001 and 90002. No.

Option H: (d) 89999 and 90000. So that would be correct. So looking for an option where (d) is 89999 and 90000.

Looking back, which options have (d) correct?

Option H: (d) 89999 and 90000. So that would be correct.

But let me check the other parts.

Option H: (a) 86411 and 86412. Wait, earlier I thought (a) should be 86420 and 86421. So option H's (a) is incorrect. So H is not the right choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me go through each option.

Option A: (a) 86410 and 86411. So 9's is 86410, 10's 86411. But earlier calculation said (a) 9's is 86420, 10's 86421. So A is wrong.

Option B: (a) 86419 and 86420. Doesn't match. (b) 09908 and 09909. Which doesn't match our (b) which is 09909 and 09910. So B is wrong.

Option C: (a) 86423 and 86424. No.

Option D: (a) 86422 and 86423. No.

Option E: (a) 86430 and 86431. No.

Option F: (a) 86421 and 86422. Close but no, because (a) should be 86420 and 86421.

Option G: (a) 86321 and 86322. No.

Option H: (a) 86411 and 86412. No.

Option I: (a) 99999 and 100000. No, because (a) is a 5-digit number, so 9's and 10's should also be 5 digits.

Option J: (a) 86420 and 86421. Which is correct. (b) 09909 and 09910, correct. (c) 90099 and 90100, correct. (d) 90000 and 89999. Wait, that's the reverse of what it should be. Because for (d), 9's is 89999, 10's is 90000. So J has (d) 9's as 90000, which is wrong. So J is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (d). Let me recheck part (d): 10000.

Number is 10000.

Compute 9's complement: each digit subtracted from 9.

1→8, 0→9, 0→9, 0→9, 0→9 → 89999.

10's complement is 100000 -10000 = 90000.

So 9's is 89999, 10's 90000.

So in the options, looking for (d) 9's 89999 and 10's 90000.

Which option has that?

Looking again:

Option B: (d) 89998 and 89999. No.

Option H: (d) 89999 and 90000. Yes.

So H has correct (d). But what about the other parts?

Option H: (a) 86411 and 86412. Wait, earlier I thought (a) should be 86420 and 86421. So that doesn't match. So H has wrong (a).

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in (a). Let me recompute (a): 13579.

9's complement: 1→8, 3→6,5→4,7→2,9→0 →86420.

10's is 86420 +1 =86421.

So (a) 9's 86420, 10's 86421.

Looking through the options for (a) correct:

Option J: (a) correct. So for (a) correct, the option must have 86420 and 86421.

Which of the options have that?

Looking:

Option J: (a) 86420 and 86421. Correct.

But in option J, (d) is 90000 and 89999. Which is incorrect because (d)'s 9's is 89999, 10's is 90000. So in J, (d) is swapped.

So perhaps I should check other options again.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Let me read the question again.

The question asks for the 9's and 10's complements of the given numbers. So for each number, compute both complements.

Looking at all the options, the correct ones must have:

(a) 9's 86420, 10's 86421.

(b) 9's 09909, 10's 09910.

(c) 9's 90099, 10's 90100.

(d) 9's 89999, 10's 90000.

(e) 0000. Let's compute (e) now.

Part (e): 0000.

Assuming it's a 4-digit number.

But wait, looking at the options, some treat 0000 as 4 digits, others as 5. Hmm, perhaps it's a 4-digit number.

Wait, but in the options, for (e), some have 9990 and 9991 (like option A), others 9999 and 10000 (option I). So perhaps the number 0000 is considered as a 4-digit number.

So 9's complement of 0000 (4 digits) is 9999.

10's complement is 10000 -0 =10000.

So (e) 9's is 9999, 10's is10000.

Now, looking at the options:

Which option has (e) 9's 9999 and 10's 10000.

Looking:

Option I: (e) 9999 and 10000. So that's correct.

But let's check other parts.

Option I for (a): 99999 and 100000. Which is not correct because (a) is a 5-digit number, so 9's would be 86420, not 99999.

So option I is incorrect except for (e).

So, now, let me compile all correct complement pairs:

(a) 86420, 86421

(b) 09909, 09910

(c) 90099, 90100

(d) 89999, 90000

(e) 9999, 10000

Now, looking at the options, which one matches all these.

Looking through each option:

Option J: (a) correct, (b) correct, (c) correct, (d) 90000 and 89999 (wrong), (e) 9999 and 10000 correct.

So J is incorrect for (d), but correct for (a), (b), (c), (e).

Option F: (a) 86421 and 86422 (wrong), (b) 09910 and 09911 (wrong), (c) 90100 and 90101 (wrong).

Nope.

Option H: (a) 86411 and 86412 (wrong), (b) 09900 and 09901 (wrong), (c) 90089 and 90090 (wrong), (d) correct, (e) 9998 and 9999 (wrong).

No.

Option B: (a) 86419 and 86420 (wrong), (b) 09908 and 09909 (wrong), (c) 90098 and 90099 (wrong), (d) 89998 and 89999 (wrong), (e) 9998 and 9999 (wrong).

No.

Option D: (a) 86422 and 86423 (wrong), (b) 09911 and 09912 (wrong), (c) 90101 and 90102 (wrong), (d) 90001 and 90002 (wrong), (e) 10001 and 10002 (wrong).

No.

Option E: (a) 86430 and 86431 (wrong), (b) 09919 and 09920 (wrong), (c) 90109 and 90110 (wrong), (d) 90010 and 90011 (wrong), (e) 9990 and 10001 (wrong).

No.

Option C: (a) 86423 and 86424 (wrong), (b) 09912 and 09913 (wrong), (c) 90102 and 90103 (wrong), (d) 90002 and 90003 (wrong), (e) 10002 and 10003 (wrong).

No.

Option G: (a) 86321 and 86322 (wrong), (b) 09810 and 09811 (wrong), (c) 90010 and 90011 (wrong), (d) 89990 and 89991 (wrong), (e) 9989 and 9990 (wrong).

No.

Option A: (a) 86410 and 86411 (close but wrong), (b) 09890 and 09891 (wrong), (c) 90080 and 90081 (wrong), (d) 89990 and 89991 (wrong), (e) 9990 and 9991 (wrong).

No.

Wait, none of the options match all the correct pairs. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check part (b): 90090.

Wait, 90090 is a 5-digit number: 9,0,0,9,0.

9's complement: 0,9,9,0,9 → 09909.

10's complement: 09909 +1 =09910.

But in the options, which option has (b) 09909 and 09910.

Looking back, Option J has (b) 09909 and 09910.

So far, A through J don't seem to have all correct parts except maybe J is close except for (d).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (d). Let me recheck.

Part (d): 10000.

5-digit number.

9's complement: 1→8, 0→9, 0→9, 0→9, 0→9 →89999.

10's complement: 100000 -10000 =90000.

So 9's is 89999, 10's is 90000.

Looking at option F: (d) 90000 and 90001. No.

Option H: (d) 89999 and 90000. Correct.

So the only correct (d) is in option H.

But option H's (a) is 86411 and 86412, which is wrong. So perhaps there's no correct option.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in (a). Let me recompute (a).

(a) 13579.

Each digit:

1 →8

3 →6

5 →4

7 →2

9 →0

So 9's complement: 86420.

10's complement: 86420 +1 =86421.

So (a) 86420 and 86421.

Looking at the options, only option J has (a) correct.

But option J's (d) is 90000 and 89999, which is swapped. So that's wrong.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct option isn't present. But I must choose from A-J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in (d). Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps 10000 is a 5-digit number, but the 9's complement is 89999, and 10's is 90000.

Looking at option J's (d): 90000 and 89999. So 9's is 90000, 10's is 89999. That's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where (d)'s 10
