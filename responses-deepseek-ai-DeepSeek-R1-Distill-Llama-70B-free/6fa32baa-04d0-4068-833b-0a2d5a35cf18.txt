Question:

A defendant is on trial for attempting to cash a forged check at a bank. A teller at the bank is called to testify. The teller testified that she was on duty when the defendant came to her station and handed her a check drawn on the account of another customer. She recognized the forgery because she knew the other customer's signature since he was one of her regulars. The teller further testified that after becoming suspicious, she placed the check down on the counter and turned to talk to her supervisor. As she did so, the defendant picked up the check and left the bank before she could say anything. The check that the defendant presented at the bank was not recovered by law enforcement authorities and was not offered as evidence. The teller's testimony regarding the forged signature on the check is

Options:

A: admissible, because the witness has the ability to recognize forged signatures.
B: inadmissible, because the witness is at fault in allowing the loss of the original by failing to secure the check.
C: admissible, because it is rationally related to the witness's perception.
D: inadmissible, because it is not possible for the jury to compare the signature on the check since it was not presented as evidence.
E: admissible, because the witness knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery.
F: admissible, because the witness was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting.
G: inadmissible, because the witness didn't directly see the defendant forging the signature.
H: inadmissible, because the witness did not see the defendant forge the signature.
I: inadmissible, because the defendant left the bank with the check before the witness could confront him.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question about a trial where a defendant is accused of trying to cash a forged check. The teller is testifying, and the question is about whether her testimony regarding the forged signature is admissible.

Let me break this down. The teller saw the defendant present a check. She recognized the signature as a forgery because she knew the regular customer's signature. She became suspicious, put the check down, turned to talk to her supervisor, and then the defendant picked up the check and left before she could do anything. The check wasn't recovered and isn't part of the evidence.

So the issue here is the admissibility of the teller's testimony about the forged signature. The options suggest various reasons why it might be admissible or not.

I remember that for a witness to testify about a document, the original is usually preferred under the best evidence rule (FRE 1002). But there are exceptions. If the original is lost or destroyed, and certain conditions are met, a copy or testimony about the contents can be used. But wait, in this case, the teller didn't keep the check; the defendant took it. Does that mean the check is lost? Or is it just that the prosecution didn't recover it?

Wait, the best evidence rule applies when the content of a writing is in issue. Here, the content of the check—specifically the signature—is crucial because it's about whether it's forged. So the teller is testifying about the contents of the check, which is the signature.

But under FRE 1002, to prove the content of a writing, you need the original unless reasons are shown why it's unavailable. But there's an exception in FRE 1004 and 1005. FRE 1005 says that for handwriting, a non-expert can testify if they're familiar with the handwriting. Also, in some cases, if the original is lost or destroyed, testimony can substitute.

Wait, the teller didn't create the check, but she recognized the signature as a forgery. She knew the customer's signature because he was a regular. So she can testify about whether the signature was genuine or not based on her familiarity.

Wait, but the check itself isn't in evidence. So the issue is whether the teller's testimony about the signature is admissible without the check being present.

I think the best evidence rule might not apply here because the signature's authenticity is a fact that the witness can testify to based on her personal knowledge. So the witness's testimony about the signature being forged is based on her perception and knowledge, not just the content of the document. Therefore, the best evidence rule may not bar her testimony.

Another angle: under FRE 901, authentication is required. But the teller can authenticate the signature because she's familiar with the customer's handwriting. So she can testify that the signature on the check was not that of the customer, thus indicating it was forged.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: Admissible because the witness can recognize forged signatures. That seems relevant because she knows the customer's signature.

Option B: Inadmissible because she lost the check. I don't think the best evidence rule makes the testimony inadmissible; it's more about whether a copy is needed. She's testifying from memory, not presenting a copy. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: Admissible because it's rationally related to her perception. That sounds like it's about the foundation of her testimony, which it is. She saw the check, recognized the signature, so her testimony is based on perception.

Option D: Inadmissible because the jury can't compare. But juries can rely on the witness's testimony without seeing the document. They can assess her credibility.

Option E: Admissible because she knew the customer and could identify the forgery. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

Option F: Admissible because she knew the victim's handwriting. The customer is the alleged victim, so this is similar to E.

Option G and H: Inadmissible because she didn't see the defendant forge it. Well, the crime is attempting to cash a forged check. She doesn't need to have seen the forgery being made; she just needs to testify that the signature was forged. So G and H are incorrect.

Option I: Inadmissible because the defendant left with the check. But the testimony is about what she saw, not about the check being lost. So I is not the right reason.

So now, which is better? A, E, F, or C?

Wait, the question is about the admissibility of her testimony regarding the forged signature. She's testifying based on her knowledge of the customer's signature. So under FRE 701, lay opinion testimony is allowed if it's rationally based on perception and not based on specialized knowledge.

Yes, so her testimony is admissible because she's familiar with the customer's handwriting. So looking at the options:

E says admissible because she knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery. That fits.

F says admissible because she was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting. Also correct.

Wait, both E and F seem correct. Hmm.

Wait, the customer whose signature was on the check is the alleged victim. So the teller knew that customer's signature. So E and F are similar, but the options are worded differently.

Wait, the options are E and F. Let me read them again.

E: admissible because the witness knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery.

F: admissible because the witness was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting.

So both E and F seem correct because they both state that she knew the victim's (customer's) handwriting.

But in the options, each is a separate choice. So which one is the better answer?

Looking back, the issue is whether the teller's testimony about the signature is admissible. The foundation is that she knew the customer's signature, making her testimony competent.

So both E and F are correct statements, but looking at the options, I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, the answer options are from A to J, and each is a possible correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the best evidence rule again. Since the check wasn't produced, but the teller is testifying about its contents. But under FRE 1005, which says that the absence of the original does not bar secondary evidence unless it's shown that the proponent lost or destroyed it in bad faith. But I'm not sure if that applies here. The defendant took the check, so it's not the prosecution's fault. So under 1004, if the original was lost or destroyed without fault, secondary evidence is admissible.

But wait, the teller is testifying from memory, not presenting a copy. So maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply because the content is being testified to, not through a document. So her testimony about the signature is acceptable.

So her testimony is admissible because she can testify based on her familiarity with the customer's handwriting. So E and F are both correct in their reasoning.

Wait, but looking through the options, E says she could identify the forgery, and F says she was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting. Both are correct, but E is more about her ability to identify the forgery, which is the key point.

Wait, but in the options, E is the same as F? Or is F more specific?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it directly addresses her knowledge of the regular customer, which is the basis for her testimony.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. Let me think about what the correct rule is.

Under the Federal Rules, a witness can testify to their opinion about handwriting based on familiarity. So, for example, a witness who is familiar with someone's handwriting can testify that a signature is or isn't genuine.

In this case, the teller was familiar with the customer's signature, so her testimony that it was a forgery is admissible as a lay opinion under FRE 701. Therefore, the answer should be E or F.

Wait, but looking at the options, E says because she knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery. F says because she was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting. So both are correct, but E seems to focus more on her ability to identify the forgery, which is the key issue.

Wait, but maybe the answer is E. Alternatively, the answer could be F, but perhaps the better answer is F because it directly relates to the basis of her knowledge of the victim's handwriting.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A, which says admissible because she can recognize forged signatures. But that might be a bit broad. A is about her ability in general, while E and F are about her specific knowledge of the customer's signature.

Wait, the teller's testimony is about a specific instance, so the basis is her familiarity with that specific customer's signature. So E and F are better than A.

I think E is a correct answer because it's based on knowing the regular customer. So the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the teller's testimony regarding the forged signature on a check. The teller recognized the forgery because she was familiar with the customer's signature, as he was a regular at the bank. The check was not recovered and is not part of the evidence, raising potential issues under the best evidence rule (FRE 1002). However, the best evidence rule applies when the content of a writing is at issue, and secondary evidence (such as testimony) can be admitted if the original is lost or unavailable through no fault of the proponent (FRE 1004, 1005). Here, the teller testified based on her personal knowledge and familiarity with the customer's handwriting, which provides a sufficient foundation for her testimony.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While the teller's ability to recognize forged signatures is relevant, this option is too broad and does not specifically address the basis of her testimony, which is her familiarity with the customer's handwriting.
- **B**: The loss of the check does not render her testimony inadmissible. The best evidence rule does not bar testimony about the contents of a document when the original is unavailable through no fault of the proponent.
- **C**: While the testimony is rationally related to the witness's perception, this option does not specifically address the key issue of her familiarity with the customer's handwriting.
- **D**: The jury's inability to compare the signature on the check is not a bar to the testimony. Juries can assess the credibility of a witness's testimony without seeing the document.
- **E**: This option correctly states that the teller's testimony is admissible because she knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery. This directly addresses the basis of her testimony.
- **F**: This option is also correct, as it highlights the teller's familiarity with the alleged victim's (customer's) handwriting. However, it is essentially equivalent to E.
- **G** and **H**: These options incorrectly suggest that the testimony is inadmissible because the teller did not see the defendant forge the signature. The crime is attempting to cash a forged check, and the teller's testimony about the forgery is sufficient.
- **I**: The defendant leaving with the check does not affect the admissibility of the testimony, as the testimony is based on the teller's observations and knowledge.

Between **E** and **F**, both are correct, but **E** is more precise in focusing on the teller's ability to identify the forgery based on her knowledge of the regular customer. Therefore, the best answer is:

**E: admissible, because the witness knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery.**

Answer: E
