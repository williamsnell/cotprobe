Okay, so I've got this problem about the Cauchy density function. I'm a bit rusty on my probability distributions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts: (a) finding the value of K so that f(x) is a probability density function, (b) finding the expected value of X, and (c) finding the variance of X.

Let's start with part (a). A probability density function (pdf) must satisfy the condition that the integral of f(x) from negative infinity to positive infinity equals 1. So I need to set up the integral of [K / (1 + x²)] dx from -∞ to ∞ and set it equal to 1.

I remember that the integral of 1/(1 + x²) dx from -∞ to ∞ is a standard result. Isn't that equal to π? Because the antiderivative of 1/(1+x²) is arctan(x), and evaluating from -∞ to ∞ gives π - (-π/2) which is π. So the integral becomes K * π = 1. Solving for K gives K = 1/π. So for part (a), K is 1/π.

Now part (b), the expected value E[X]. The expected value is the integral of x * f(x) dx from -∞ to ∞. So that's ∫ x * [K / (1 + x²)] dx from -∞ to ∞. Wait, but K is 1/π now.

Hmm, let me think about this integral. The integrand is x / (1 + x²) multiplied by 1/π. The function x/(1+x²) is an odd function because if you replace x with -x, it becomes -x/(1+x²), which is the negative of the original function. The limits are symmetric around zero, from -∞ to ∞.

I remember that the integral of an odd function over symmetric limits is zero. So the expected value E[X] should be zero. That makes sense because the Cauchy distribution is symmetric around zero. So part (b) answer is 0.

Moving on to part (c), the variance of X. Variance is E[X²] - (E[X])². Since E[X] is zero, variance is just E[X²].

E[X²] is the integral of x² * f(x) dx from -∞ to ∞. So that's ∫ x² * [1/(π(1 + x²))] dx from -∞ to ∞.

Let me simplify the integrand: x²/(1 + x²) = (1 + x² - 1)/(1 + x²) = 1 - 1/(1 + x²). So the integral becomes ∫ [1 - 1/(1 + x²)] / π dx.

Split the integral into two parts: ∫ 1/π dx - ∫ 1/(π(1+x²)) dx.

The first integral is (1/π) * ∫ dx from -∞ to ∞. Wait, that's problematic because ∫ dx from -∞ to ∞ is infinite. So the first term becomes infinite. The second integral is (1/π) * [arctan(x)] from -∞ to ∞, which is (1/π)(π/2 - (-π/2)) = (1/π)(π) = 1.

So putting it together, E[X²] = [∞] - 1, which is ∞. So the variance is infinite.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because variance is E[X²], which is the integral of x² f(x) dx. And we just saw that this integral diverges—it's infinite. So yes, the variance is infinite.

So putting it all together:

a) K = 1/π.

b) E[X] = 0.

c) Variance is infinite (∞).

Now looking at the options:

Option E says K=1/π, E(X)=0, Variance=∞. That matches our answers. So the correct option is E.

The Cauchy density function is given by:

\[
f(x) = \frac{K}{1 + x^2}, \quad -\infty \leq x \leq \infty.
\]

### Part (a): Determine the value of \( K \) such that \( f(x) \) is a probability density function.

For \( f(x) \) to be a valid probability density function (pdf), the integral of \( f(x) \) over the entire real line must equal 1:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{K}{1 + x^2} \, dx = 1.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \) from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \) is a standard result and equals \( \pi \). Thus:

\[
K \cdot \pi = 1 \implies K = \frac{1}{\pi}.
\]

### Part (b): Determine the expected value of \( X \).

The expected value \( E[X] \) is given by:

\[
E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \cdot f(x) \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x}{\pi (1 + x^2)} \, dx.
\]

The integrand \( \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \) is an odd function, and the integral of an odd function over symmetric limits (from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \)) is zero. Therefore:

\[
E[X] = 0.
\]

### Part (c): Determine the variance of \( X \).

The variance of \( X \) is given by:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2.
\]

Since \( E[X] = 0 \), the variance simplifies to \( E[X^2] \), where:

\[
E[X^2] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot f(x) \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x^2}{\pi (1 + x^2)} \, dx.
\]

Simplifying the integrand:

\[
\frac{x^2}{1 + x^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + x^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
E[X^2] = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \right) \, dx.
\]

The first term, \( \int_{-\infty}^\infty 1 \, dx \), diverges to infinity, while the second term, \( \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \, dx \), equals \( \pi \). Therefore:

\[
E[X^2] = \infty - \frac{\pi}{\pi} = \infty.
\]

Hence, the variance of \( X \) is infinite:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = \infty.
\]

### Final Answer:

(a) \( K = \frac{1}{\pi} \), (b) \( E[X] = 0 \), (c) \( \text{Var}(X) = \infty \).

The correct option is:

**E: \( K = \frac{1}{\pi}, E(X) = 0, \text{Variance of } X = \infty \).**
