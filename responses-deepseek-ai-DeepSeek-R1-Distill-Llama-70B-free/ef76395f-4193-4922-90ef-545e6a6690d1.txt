Okay, so I have this fire insurance policy question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the policy has an annual premium of $40 and was canceled 90 days after it took effect. I need to determine the refund to the insured in two scenarios: (a) when the policyholder cancels, and (b) when the carrier cancels.

Hmm, I remember that insurance policies have different rules for refunds depending on who cancels. I think when the policyholder cancels, they might get a proportionate refund based on the time left, but when the carrier cancels, there's a short rate cancellation which might involve a different calculation.

Wait, right. Let me think about the short rate vs. pro rata. Pro rata is when the refund is based on the time remaining. So if it's 90 days into a 365-day policy, the policyholder would get a refund for the remaining 275 days. But if it's a short rate, the carrier might deduct a higher fee because the policy didn't run the full term.

Wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. When the insured cancels, it's a short rate, and when the carrier cancels, they might do pro rata. Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Oh right, I think pro rata is when the policy is canceled by mutual agreement, and the insured gets a proportionate refund. Short rate is when the insured cancels, and they get less than the pro rata because the carrier might have some fixed expenses. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, I should probably look up the formulas. Let me recall. The pro rata refund is calculated as (unexpired term / total term) multiplied by the premium. The short rate is calculated as the same but minus a fee, like a cancellation fee, but maybe it's a different formula.

Wait, I think the short rate formula is: premium * (time in force / total term) minus some fee, or maybe it's a flat fee. Alternatively, I remember that the short rate might be calculated as the pro rata refund minus a certain percentage, like 10% or some fixed amount. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.

Let me think again. If the policy is canceled after 90 days, that's 90/365 of the year. So the used portion is 90 days, and the unexpired is 275 days.

If the policyholder cancels, I believe they get the pro rata refund minus a short rate penalty. Wait, no, I think when the policy is canceled by the insured, the carrier returns the pro rata amount minus a fee. Or is it that when the carrier cancels, it's pro rata, and when the insured cancels, it's on a short rate basis?

Wait, I think I had this wrong. Let me try to get it right. The standard practice is:

- If the policy is canceled by the insured, the refund is based on the short rate, which is less than pro rata.

- If the policy is canceled by the carrier, the refund is pro rata.

Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Because when the carrier cancels, they can't charge a short rate; they have to give a pro rata refund. But when the insured cancels, the carrier can deduct a short rate fee because they didn't get the full term's premium.

So for part (a), when the policyholder cancels, it's a short rate. For (b), carrier cancels, it's pro rata.

So let's calculate both.

First, the total premium is $40 for a year. 90 days have passed, so 90/365 of the year is used.

For pro rata refund (if carrier cancels):

The unexpired time is 275 days. So the refund is (275/365)*40.

Let me calculate that. 275 divided by 365 is approximately 0.7534. Multiply by 40: 0.7534 *40 = approx 30.14. So the refund would be around $30.14.

Wait, but when the carrier cancels, they give a pro rata refund. So (b) would be $30.14.

Now, for part (a), when the policyholder cancels, it's a short rate. The short rate is calculated as the pro rata earned premium plus a penalty. Wait, no. Short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a fee, but perhaps it's the premium multiplied by (time in force + some fraction)/total term.

Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium for the time the policy was in force, which would be (90/365)*40, and then the refund is the total premium minus that earned amount.

Wait, that sounds more like pro rata. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Pro rata cancellation means the insured gets a refund of the unearned premium, which is (unexpired time / total time) * premium.

Short rate cancellation is when the insured cancels, and the refund is less than the pro rata. It's calculated as (time in force / total time) * premium, but then a fee is deducted.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think of an example.

Suppose the annual premium is $40, and after 90 days, the policy is canceled.

Pro rata refund would be the unused portion. So (275/365)*40 ≈ 30.14.

Short rate is calculated as the earned premium (for the 90 days) plus a fee. So earned premium would be (90/365)*40 ≈ 9.86. Wait, that's the amount the carrier has earned. So the refund would be the total premium minus the earned premium minus a fee.

Wait, no. Wait, the short rate is when the policy is canceled before the end of the term, and the carrier charges a higher premium for the time it was in force, thus giving a smaller refund.

Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as (time in force / (time in force + 1)) * total premium. Or maybe (time in force / (time in force + something)).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of the short rate as the earned premium plus a fee, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate formula is (time in force / total time) * total premium, and then the refund is the total premium minus that, minus a fee.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

When the policy is canceled by the insured, the refund is calculated on a short rate basis. The formula for short rate return premium is:

Return Premium = (Unexpired Term / Total Term) × Premium – (Short Rate Table Factor × Premium)

But I'm not exactly sure about this. Alternatively, I've heard that the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a fee, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's easier to remember that when the insured cancels, the refund is computed using the short rate, which is the pro rata refund minus a small flat fee. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium, without any penalty. But that would be the same as pro rata.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to think of it another way.

The key difference is that when the carrier cancels, they must refund the pro rata amount, which is the unused portion. But when the insured cancels, the carrier may keep a larger portion, hence a smaller refund. So for (a), the refund is less than (b).

So for (a), the policyholder cancels, so the refund is less than the pro rata. For (b), the carrier cancels, so the refund is pro rata.

In the options, I see that in option B, (a) is $30 and (b) is $26.14, which doesn't fit because (b) should be higher. Wait, no, in option B, (a) is $30, (b) is $26.14. But according to my previous calculation, (b) should be around $30.14, and (a) would be less, maybe around $26.

Wait, perhaps I had it backwards. Let me recalculate.

Wait, let's think again. If the policy is canceled after 90 days, the carrier has been paid $40 for the entire year, but only 90 days have passed. So the amount earned by the carrier is 90/365 * 40 ≈ 9.86 dollars.

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's the earned premium. So the unearned premium is 40 - 9.86 = 30.14. So if the carrier cancels, they have to refund the unearned, which is 30.14.

If the policyholder cancels, the carrier can't just give the full unearned; they might apply a short rate. So the short rate is calculated as (90/365 + something) × premium. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a fee, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that the short rate is calculated as the pro rata earned premium, but with an additional charge. So perhaps the formula is:

Short Rate Refund = (Time in Force / Total Time) × Premium – (flat fee).

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium (the amount the carrier has already earned), which would be 9.86, so the refund would be 40 - 9.86 = 30.14, same as pro rata, but that can't be right because then (a) and (b) would have the same refund.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the definitions again.

Pro rata cancellation: the policy is canceled, and the refund is based on the unexpired term. So the refund is (unexpired days / total days) × premium.

Short rate cancellation: when the policy is canceled by the insured, the refund is less than pro rata. The formula is (time in force / (time in force + 1)) × premium, or something like that. Alternatively, the short rate is the earned premium, which is (time in force / total time) × premium, and the refund is total premium minus earned premium.

Wait, that would be the same as pro rata. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a certain percentage, say 10%, which is subtracted from the total premium.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find a formula.

Upon checking, the short rate return premium is calculated as:

Short Rate Return = (Earned Premium) + (pro rata commission) + (taxes).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as:

Refund = Premium × (Time in Force / Total Time) – (Some fee).

Wait, perhaps I should think of an example. Suppose the premium is $40, and after 90 days, the policy is canceled.

If it's pro rata (carrier cancels), the refund is (275/365)*40 ≈ 30.14.

If it's short rate (policyholder cancels), the refund is (90/365)*40 ≈ 9.86, but that seems too low. So maybe that's not right.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the policyholder has paid $40 for the year, and if they cancel after 90 days, they would get a refund of the unearned part. So if it's pro rata, they get 275/365 *40 ≈30.14.

If it's short rate, maybe the refund is less. So perhaps they only get 90 days' worth of coverage, so the earned premium is 9.86, so the refund is 40 -9.86=30.14, same as pro rata. But that can't be right because then both (a) and (b) would have same refund.

Wait, I'm getting really confused here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the short rate is calculated by a different method. I remember that the short rate is calculated as the pro rata earned premium plus a fee, but perhaps the formula is:

Short Rate Refund = (Time in Force / Total Time) × Premium × (1 - (Time in Force / Total Time)).

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a flat fee, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Upon checking, the short rate formula is:

Short Rate Return Premium = (Earned Premium) × (1 - (Earned Premium / Total Premium)).

Wait, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me try with the numbers.

Earned Premium = (90/365)*40 ≈9.86.

So Short Rate Return = 9.86 × (1 - 9.86/40) = 9.86 × (1 - 0.2465) = 9.86 × 0.7535 ≈7.45. Then the refund would be 40 -7.45 ≈32.55. That doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right formula. Alternatively, I've read that the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a proportion based on the time. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a flat fee, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the options given. The options are:

A: $26, $30.14

B: $30, $26.14

C: $24, $32.14

D: $28, $28.14

Wait, earlier I calculated that when the carrier cancels, the refund is $30.14. So for part (b), the refund is around $30.14, which is one of the options. Looking at the options, option A has $30.14 as the second value, which would correspond to (b). So for (a), the refund would be less than that, perhaps $26.

Wait, let me check option A: (a) $26, (b) $30.14.

That makes sense because when the policyholder cancels (a), the refund is less, and when the carrier cancels (b), it's pro rata, which is higher.

But wait, earlier I thought that when the carrier cancels, the refund is pro rata, which is higher, so (b) would be $30.14, and (a) would be lower, perhaps $26. So option A has (a) as $26 and (b) as $30.14.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me recalculate (a) as short rate.

Wait, perhaps the short rate formula is:

Refund = (Time in Force / Total Time) × Premium – (some fee).

Alternatively, perhaps it's (Time in Force / (Time in Force + 90)) × Premium.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a fee, but that's not clear.

Wait, another approach: the policy was in force for 90 days, so the carrier has earned 90 days' worth of premium, which is 90/365 *40 ≈9.86. So the unearned premium is 40-9.86=30.14, which is the pro rata refund.

If the policyholder cancels, the carrier might deduct a fee, say 10% of the unearned, so 0.1*30.14=3.01. So the refund would be 30.14 -3.01=27.13, which is approximately $27.13, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the fee is a flat $4, so 30.14 -4=26.14. That would make (a) $26.14 and (b) $30.14.

Looking at the options, option B has (a) as $30 and (b) as $26.14, which doesn't fit. Option A has (a) $26, (b) $30.14. So if (a) is $26, that would mean the refund is 26, which is 40 - (earned + fee). So earned is 9.86, so fee would be 40 -26 -9.86=4.14. So perhaps a fee of $4.14 is deducted.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a percentage, say 10%, of the earned premium. So 9.86 + 0.1*9.86=10.85. So the refund would be 40 -10.85=29.15, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the short rate is calculated as the earned premium plus a flat fee of $5, so refund is 40 - (9.86+5)=25.14, approximately $25, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the short rate as the earned premium plus a penalty, but I'm not getting the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Refund = (Unexpired Term / Total Term) × Premium × (1 - (Time in Force / Total Time)).

Wait, that would be (275/365)*40*(1 - 90/365) ≈30.14 *0.752≈22.66, which is not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of the options again. Option A is (a) $26, (b) $30.14. Option B is (a) $30, (b) $26.14. Option D is both $28.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the policy was canceled after 90 days, so 90/365 of the premium is considered earned. So earned is 9.86. If the carrier cancels, the refund is pro rata, so unearned is 30.14, so refund is 30.14. If the policyholder cancels, the refund is the earned amount, which is 9.86, but that would be a very small refund, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the options suggest higher refunds. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps when the policyholder cancels, the refund is calculated as the pro rata earned, but minus a fee. So 30.14 (pro rata) minus a fee of $4 would be $26.14, which is option B's (b) value. But that doesn't make sense because (b) is when the carrier cancels, which should be pro rata.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to find a different way.
