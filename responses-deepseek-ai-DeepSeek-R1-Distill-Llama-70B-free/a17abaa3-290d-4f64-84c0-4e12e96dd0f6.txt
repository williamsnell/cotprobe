    <think>


To solve the expression \( 10 - (n + 6) \) when \( n = 11 \):

1. Substitute \( n = 11 \) into the expression:
   \[
   10 - (11 + 6)
   \]

2. Perform the addition inside the parentheses:
   \[
   10 - 17
   \]

3. Subtract to find the final value:
   \[
   10 - 17 = -7
   \]

From the given options, the correct answer is **D: -7**.
