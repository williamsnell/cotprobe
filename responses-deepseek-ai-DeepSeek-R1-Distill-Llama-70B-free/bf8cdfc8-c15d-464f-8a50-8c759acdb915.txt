Okay, so I need to figure out Tim's gross earnings for last month. He's a salesman with a guaranteed salary, and then he gets a commission based on his sales. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the problem states that Tim has a guaranteed salary of $4800 per year. But wait, the question is about his earnings for last month, which I assume is one month. So I think I need to figure out what portion of that $4800 is for the month. Since there are 12 months in a year, I'll divide 4800 by 12. Let me calculate that: 4800 divided by 12 is 400. So Tim's monthly guaranteed salary is $400.

Now, the commission part is a bit more complex. His commission depends on the amount of sales he makes, with different percentages for different brackets. The breakdown is as follows:

- 4% on all sales up to $12,000.
- 5% on sales from $12,000 to $20,000.
- 6% on sales over $20,000.

Last month, Tim's sales were $21,750. So I need to calculate his commission based on these tiers.

Let me structure this. I'll split his sales into the three applicable ranges and compute the commission for each range separately.

1. The first $12,000: He gets 4% on this. So 4% of 12,000 is 0.04 * 12,000 = $480.

2. The next bracket is from $12,000 to $20,000. That's a range of $8,000. So 5% of 8,000 is 0.05 * 8,000 = $400.

3. The amount over $20,000 is $21,750 - $20,000 = $1,750. He gets 6% on this. So 0.06 * 1,750 = let's see, 1,750 * 0.06 is 105. So that's $105.

Now, adding up all these commissions: $480 (first part) + $400 (second) + $105 (third) = total commission of 480 + 400 is 880, plus 105 gives 985. So $985 in commission.

But wait, I should double-check that math because it's easy to make a mistake. So 4% of 12,000 is 480, correct. 5% of 8,000 is 400, correct. 6% of 1,750: 1,750 times 0.06. Let me calculate that again. 1,750 * 0.06 is indeed 105. So the commission total is 480+400=880 +105=985.

Now, adding the guaranteed salary and the commission. The guaranteed salary for the month is $400, and the commission is $985. So 400 + 985 equals 1,385. So his gross earnings would be $1,385?

Wait, but looking at the options provided, none of them match this number. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait a second, maybe I misunderstood the guaranteed salary. The problem says Tim earns a guaranteed salary of $4800/year. So that's $400 per month. Plus the commissions, which I calculated as $985, so total earnings would be $400 + $985 = $1,385. But looking at the options, the highest is $6,125, which is way higher. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, maybe I misread the commission structure. Let me read the problem again. Oh wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake. The problem says he earns 4% on all sales up to $12,000. Then 5% on sales from $12k to $20k, and 6% over $20k. So for each tier, it's the amount within that tier multiplied by the respective percentage.

Wait, but perhaps the way I calculated is correct. Hmm, but let's recalculate everything step by step.

Alternatively, maybe the $4800 is a monthly salary, not yearly? Because that would change everything. Let me check the problem again. The question says he earns a guaranteed salary of $4800/year plus the commission. So yes, it's yearly, so per month it's 4800/12=400.

Wait, but if the commission is $985 and the salary is $400, that's 1385 total. But none of the answer options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the commission calculation.

Wait, let's recompute the commission. Sales are $21,750.

First tier: 4% on the first $12,000. So 0.04 * 12,000 = 480.

Second tier: from 12,001 to 20,000. So that's 8,000. 5% of 8,000 is 400.

Third tier: 21,750 - 20,000 = 1,750. 6% of that is 105.

So 480 + 400 = 880 + 105 = 985.

Hmm, that's correct. So total earnings are 400 + 985 = 1,385. So none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the guaranteed salary as $4800 per month? That would make more sense with the answer options. Let me reevaluate that.

If the guaranteed salary is $4800 per month, then the commission would be 985, making total earnings 4800 + 985 = 5,785. That's $5,785. So looking at the options, option B is $5,785. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the problem says $4800 per year, right? Because it says "a guaranteed salary of $4800/year". So that would be 400 per month. Unless the problem is in error, perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the $4800 as annual, but perhaps the commission is calculated on a monthly basis, but the salary is annual, so perhaps I should add the full $4800 as a one-time payment, but that doesn't make sense because the question is about last month's earnings. So it's more likely that the $4800 is per year, so per month it's 400.

Wait, but if the options don't have 1,385, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something else. Maybe the commission structure is applied differently. Let me re-examine the commission tiers.

The problem states: 4% of all sales up to $12,000; 5% from $12k to $20k; and 6% over $20k in any month. So the way I did it is correct: each tier is calculated on the portion within that range.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the commission is based on the total sales, not per month. Wait no, the problem says "in any month," so the commission rates apply per month.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the $4800 is a monthly salary, not annual. Because that would make the total earnings 4800 + 985 = 5785, which is option B. That would fit one of the answer choices.

So perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read again: "a guaranteed salary of $4800/year". So it's per year, not per month. So it's 400 per month. But then the commission is 985, so 1385, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the problem intended the $4800 to be monthly? But that's not what it says.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the commission calculation. Let me try to compute each step again.

First tier: up to 12,000: 4% of 12,000 is 480.

Second tier: from 12,001 to 20,000: that's 8,000. 5% of 8,000 is 400.

Third tier: over 20,000: 21,750 - 20,000 = 1,750. 6% of 1,750 is 105.

So 480 + 400 is 880, plus 105 is 985. So that's correct.

Adding 400 (salary) gives 1,385. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the commission is calculated on a different basis. Maybe the percentages are applied cumulatively. Wait, no, the way I did it is correct. For example, the first 12k is at 4%, next 8k at 5%, and beyond that at 6%.

Wait, perhaps the total sales are 21,750, but the commission is calculated as follows:

- 4% on the first 12k: 480.

- Then, for the entire amount between 12k and 20k, which is 8k, 5% applies, which is 400.

- Then, anything over 20k is 6%. So 1,750 at 6% is 105.

So 480 + 400 + 105 = 985.

So total earnings would be 400 + 985 = 1,385.

But again, the options don't have this. So I'm confused.

Wait, looking back at the answer options, option B is $5,785. That's about 5.8k. Which would be 4800 (annual salary? No, that can't be, because it's per year) or perhaps, wait, perhaps the $4800 is per month. Then, 4800 + 985 would be 5785, which is option B.

But the problem says $4800 per year. Unless I'm making a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps the problem says $4800 per month. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: "a guaranteed salary of $4800/year plus 4%..." So no, it's per year.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the commission structure. Maybe the commission is calculated on all sales, but each tier is applied to the entire sale beyond the previous tier. For example, 4% on the first 12k, then 5% on the amount exceeding 12k up to 20k, and 6% beyond 20k. That's how I did it, so I think that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the commission is calculated on the total sales, but each tier applies to the entire amount. Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would mean higher percentages on lower amounts, which isn't the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that Tim's total sales were 21,750, and the commission is calculated as 4% on the first 12k, 5% on the next 8k, and 6% on the remaining 1.75k. So that's correct. So the commission is 480 + 400 + 105 = 985.

Adding to the monthly salary of 400 gives 1,385. But no option matches. So perhaps the problem intended the guaranteed salary to be $4800 per month, which would make total earnings 4800 + 985 = 5785, which is option B. So perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the salary is per month instead of per year.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try again.

Wait, maybe the commission is computed differently. Let's think: total sales are 21,750.

First 12k: 4% → 480.

Next 8k (from 12k to 20k): 5% → 400.

Above 20k: 1,750 → 6% → 105.

Total commission: 480 + 400 + 105 = 985.

So that's correct. So 400 (salary) + 985 (commission) = 1,385.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I need to re-express the problem differently.

Wait, perhaps the $4800 is a base salary, and the commission is added on top. So it's 4800 per year, which is 400 per month, plus the commission of 985, totaling 1,385. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is about the total for the year, but that can't be because the sales are for last month.

Alternatively, perhaps the commission is calculated on the total annual sales, but that also doesn't make sense because the question is about last month's sales.

Wait, perhaps I misread the commission structure. Let me read it again: 4% of all sales up to $12k; 5% from 12k to 20k; 6% over 20k in any month. So the commission is per month, so it's correct as I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that Tim's total sales for the year are 21,750, but that's unlikely because it's stated as "last month's sales". So no, I think my initial approach is correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is B, $5,785, which would be if the guaranteed salary was $4,800 per month. So maybe the problem meant $4800 per month, not per year. That would make sense, as it's a more reasonable salary for a salesman.

So if the salary is $4,800 per month, then adding the commission of 985 gives 5,785, which is option B.

So perhaps the correct answer is B, $5,785.
</think>

To calculate Tim's gross earnings for last month, we need to consider both his guaranteed salary and his commission. The guaranteed salary is $4,800 per year, which translates to $400 per month ($4,800 ÷ 12). The commission is calculated based on his sales, which were $21,750 last month, and is structured as follows:

1. **First $12,000 in sales**: 4% commission.  
   \[
   0.04 \times 12,000 = 480
   \]

2. **Sales from $12,000 to $20,000**: 5% commission.  
   This range is $8,000 ($20,000 - $12,000).  
   \[
   0.05 \times 8,000 = 400
   \]

3. **Sales over $20,000**: 6% commission.  
   The amount over $20,000 is $1,750 ($21,750 - $20,000).  
   \[
   0.06 \times 1,750 = 105
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total commission:  
\[
480 + 400 + 105 = 985
\]

Now, add the monthly guaranteed salary of $400:  
\[
400 + 985 = 1,385
\]

However, none of the provided answer options match this result. Upon reevaluating the problem, it is likely that the guaranteed salary is intended to be $4,800 per month rather than per year, as this would align with the answer options. If the guaranteed salary is $4,800 per month, the total earnings become:  
\[
4,800 + 985 = 5,785
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **B: $5,785**.
