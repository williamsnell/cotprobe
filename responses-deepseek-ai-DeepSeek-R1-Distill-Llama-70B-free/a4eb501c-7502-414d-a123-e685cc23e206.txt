Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the vapor pressure of a sucrose solution. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that vapor pressure has something to do with solutions and maybe something called Raoult's Law. Let's see if I can figure this out.

Alright, the problem states that we have 20.0 grams of sucrose dissolved in 40.0 grams of water. The temperature is 34°C, and the vapor pressure of pure water at that temperature is 40.00 mmHg. They're asking for the vapor pressure of the solution.

Wait, right! Raoult's Law is used here. Raoult's Law says that the vapor pressure of a solution is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent multiplied by the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. So the formula is P = X_solvent * P_pure.

But wait, I need to calculate the mole fraction of water in the solution. Mole fraction is moles of solvent over total moles (solvent + solute). Since sucrose is the solute, water is the solvent.

First, I should find the moles of sucrose and water. Let's start with sucrose. The formula is C12H22O11. What's the molar mass? Carbon is 12 g/mol, so 12*12=144. Hydrogen is 1, so 22*1=22. Oxygen is 16, so 11*16=176. Adding those up: 144 +22 +176 = 342 g/mol. So 20 grams of sucrose would be 20 / 342 moles. Let's calculate that: 20 divided by 342 is approximately 0.0585 moles.

Next, water. The molar mass is 18 g/mol. 40 grams divided by 18 is 40/18 = 2.222 moles.

Now, the mole fraction of water (X_water) is moles of water divided by (moles of water + moles of sucrose). So that's 2.222 / (2.222 + 0.0585). Let's compute the denominator: 2.222 + 0.0585 ≈ 2.2805. So X_water ≈ 2.222 / 2.2805 ≈ 0.9745.

Now, Raoult's Law: P_solution = X_water * P_water. P_water is 40.00 mmHg. So 0.9745 * 40 = about 38.98 mmHg. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest one is E: 38.0 or H:39.0. Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Let me recalculate the moles precisely. Sucrose: 20 / 342. Let me compute that exactly. 342 goes into 20 zero times. 342 into 200 is 0.58 times (342 * 0.05 is 17.1, which leaves 182.9; 342 goes into 182.9 about 0.535 times. Wait maybe I should just use a calculator approach.

Wait, 342 * 0.0585 is approximately 20. Let me double-check: 342 * 0.05 = 17.1, 342 * 0.0085 = approx 2.907. So 17.1 +2.907 = 19. That's close to 20. So 0.0585 is correct.

Moles of water: 40.0 g / 18.015 g/mol = let's use 18 for simplicity. 40/18=2.2222...

So X_water = 2.2222 / (2.2222 + 0.0585) = 2.2222 / 2.2807. Let me compute this division accurately. 2.2222 ÷ 2.2807.

Let me approximate it. 2.28 is about 2.2222 * 1.026. Because 2.2222 * 1.026 = approx 2.28. So 1 / 1.026 is approximately 0.9746. So 0.9746.

So P_solution = 0.9746 * 40 = 38.984 mmHg. So around 38.98, which is approximately 39.0 mmHg. Looking at the options, H is 39.0. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:38.5, B:35, C:37, D:40, E:38, F:41, G:37.5, H:39, I:36.5, J:42. So H is 39, which matches.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make any miscalculations? Let me double-check the moles of sucrose. 20 grams divided by 342 g/mol. Let me compute 342 into 20. 342 * 0.05 is 17.1, as before. So 20-17.1=2.9 left. 2.9 / 342 is approximately 0.00847. So total moles of sucrose is 0.05 + 0.00847 = 0.05847, which is about 0.0585, correct.

Moles of water: 40/18. Let me be precise. 18 g/mol. 40 ÷ 18 = 2.222222... So that's correct.

Mole fraction: 2.2222 / (2.2222 + 0.05847) = 2.2222 / 2.28067. Let me calculate this division more accurately. Let me write it as (2.2222)/(2.28067) ≈ 0.9745.

So 0.9745 *40 = 38.98, which is 39.0. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but another thought—sometimes, in these problems, when the solute is non-volatile, which sucrose is, the vapor pressure lowering is calculated as X_solute, and the solution's vapor pressure is P0*(1 - X_solute). Alternatively, since X_solvent = 1 - X_solute. Both approaches should give the same result.

Let me try that method. X_solute = moles_solute / (moles_solute + moles_solvent). So X_solute = 0.05847 / (0.05847 +2.2222) = 0.05847 / 2.28067 ≈ 0.0256. So 1 - X_solute = 0.9744, same as before. So same calculation.

So P = 40 * 0.9744 = 38.976, which is 39.0.

So the answer should be H:39.0 mm.

To calculate the vapor pressure of the solution, we use Raoult's Law:

\[
P_{\text{solution}} = X_{\text{solvent}} \cdot P_{\text{pure solvent}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of solute (sucrose) and solvent (water)
- **Molar mass of sucrose (C\(_{12}\)H\(_{22}\)O\(_{11}\))**:  
  \[
  12 \cdot 12 + 22 \cdot 1 + 11 \cdot 16 = 342 \, \text{g/mol}
  \]  
  Moles of sucrose:  
  \[
  \frac{20.0 \, \text{g}}{342 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0585 \, \text{mol}
  \]

- **Molar mass of water (H\(_2\)O)**:  
  \[
  2 \cdot 1 + 16 = 18 \, \text{g/mol}
  \]  
  Moles of water:  
  \[
  \frac{40.0 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 2.222 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate mole fraction of water (\(X_{\text{water}}\))
The mole fraction of water is given by:  
\[
X_{\text{water}} = \frac{\text{moles of water}}{\text{total moles (water + sucrose)}}
\]  
\[
X_{\text{water}} = \frac{2.222}{2.222 + 0.0585} \approx 0.9745
\]

### Step 3: Apply Raoult's Law
The vapor pressure of pure water at 34°C is 40.00 mmHg. Using Raoult's Law:  
\[
P_{\text{solution}} = X_{\text{water}} \cdot P_{\text{water}}
\]  
\[
P_{\text{solution}} = 0.9745 \cdot 40.00 \approx 38.98 \, \text{mmHg}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated vapor pressure (38.98 mmHg) is closest to **39.0 mmHg**, which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
