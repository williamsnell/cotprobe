Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the Debye-Hückel screening length, 1/κ, for a K3PO4 solution. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, I remember that the Debye length is a measure of how far the electric field of a charge extends into a solution before being screened by ions in the solution. The formula for κ is related to the ionic strength of the solution. Oh right, the formula is κ = sqrt( (2 * e² * NA * I) / (ε_r * ε_0 * k_B * T) )) ), but wait, maybe there's a simplified version when using certain units.

Wait, I think there's a standard approach using the ionic strength and a specific equation. Let me think. I recall that the Debye length (λ_D) is 1/κ, and there's an equation that relates κ to the ionic strength of the solution.

The formula for κ is given by κ² = (2 * NA * e² * I) / (ε_r ε_0 k_B T), but maybe I should use a version that's more straightforward with units in mol/kg (m), because the given concentration is in molal (m = 0.0075 m).

Wait, another approach: I think the Debye-Hückel screening length can be calculated using the formula:

κ⁻¹ = sqrt( (ε_r ε_0 k_B T) / (2 NA e² I) ) )

But sometimes, when using certain units, it's simplified. Oh, right, I remember a formula where you can calculate κ⁻¹ in nanometers using the ionic strength I (in mol/kg) with the formula:

κ⁻¹ (nm) ≈ 0.304 / sqrt(I)

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. I think the formula is κ⁻¹ (nm) = 0.304 / sqrt(I), where I is the ionic strength in molarity (mol/dm³) or mol/kg (since m is mol/kg, which is same as mol/dm³ for dilute solutions).

So, first I need to calculate the ionic strength of the solution.

Ionic strength I is calculated as I = ½ Σ ci zi², where ci is the concentration of each ion, and zi is the charge.

The solution is K3PO4. Let's dissociate that. K3PO4 dissociates into 3 K+ ions and 1 PO4^3- ion.

So, for each formula unit of K3PO4, it gives 3 K+ and 1 PO4^3-.

The concentration of K3PO4 is given as 0.0075 m. So, the concentration of K+ is 3 * 0.0075 m = 0.0225 m, and the concentration of PO4^3- is 0.0075 m.

Now, calculate I.

I = ½ * [ (0.0225 m) * (1)^2 + (0.0075 m) * (3)^2 ]

Because K+ has a charge of +1, and PO4^3- has charge -3, but since we square it, the sign doesn't matter.

So,

I = ½ [ 0.0225 * 1 + 0.0075 * 9 ]

Compute each part:

0.0225 * 1 = 0.0225

0.0075 *9 = 0.0675

Sum is 0.0225 + 0.0675 = 0.09

Multiply by ½: 0.045.

So I = 0.045 m.

Wait, that seems correct. Let me double-check.

Yes, K3PO4 gives 3 K+ (each +1) and 1 PO4^3- (charge -3). So the contribution from K+ is 3 * 0.0075 * 1^2 = 0.0225. And from PO4^3-: 0.0075 * 3^2 = 0.0075*9 = 0.0675. Sum is 0.09, multiplied by ½ gives 0.045 m.

So I = 0.045 m.

Now, using the formula κ⁻¹ ≈ 0.304 / sqrt(I).

So I = 0.045. Let's compute sqrt(0.045).

sqrt(0.045) ≈ sqrt(0.04) is 0.2, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3. 0.045 is between them. Let me calculate it more accurately.

0.045 = 4.5e-2. So sqrt(4.5e-2) = sqrt(4.5)*1e-1.

sqrt(4.5) is about 2.1213. So 2.1213e-1 = 0.21213.

So sqrt(0.045) ≈ 0.2121.

Then, 0.304 divided by 0.2121 equals approximately:

0.304 / 0.2121 ≈ let me compute this.

0.304 ÷ 0.2121 ≈ let's see, 0.2121 * 1.43 is roughly 0.303. Because 0.2121 *1.4=0.29694, 0.2121 *1.43=0.2121*(1.4 +0.03)=0.29694 + 0.006363=0.3033. So 1.43.

So κ⁻¹ ≈ 1.43 nm.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

A:1.8 nm
B:1.0 nm
C:2.8 nm
D:0.5 nm
E:2.5 nm
F:2.2 nm
G:0.8 nm
H:3.0 nm
I:1.4 nm

Hmm, I got approximately 1.43 nm. So option I is 1.4 nm, which is very close. But let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ionic strength calculation. Let me double-check that.

I = ½ * [ (3 * 0.0075) * (1)^2 + (0.0075) * (3)^2 ]

= ½ [ 0.0225 * 1 + 0.0075 *9 ]

= ½ [0.0225 + 0.0675] = ½ (0.09) = 0.045. Yes, correct.

So sqrt(0.045) is indeed approximately 0.2121.

So 0.304 / 0.2121 = 1.432 nm.

So the closest option is I:1.4 nm. But wait, let me think: sometimes in the Debye length formula, the 0.304 value is an approximation that uses I in molarity (mol/dm³) assuming that activity coefficients are considered, but in this problem, the solution is given in molality (m = mol/kg). Wait, but for dilute solutions, molality and molarity are almost the same, so perhaps it's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is for I in mol/L, which is same as m for dilute solutions. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute κ from the formula using more precise terms.

The general formula is:

κ² = (2 * NA * e² * I) / (ε_r ε_0 k_B T)

But using SI units.

Wait, but perhaps that's complicating things. Because I remember that the approximation 1/κ (nm)=0.304 / sqrt(I) is a shortcut derived from using the formula with I in mol/dm³.

So, perhaps I should stick with that, and my calculation gives around 1.4 nm, which is option I.

But wait, looking at the options again, option F is 2.2 nm. I'm a bit confused because I thought my approach is correct, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me think again about the ionic strength calculation. Wait, K3PO4 dissociates into 3 K+ and 1 PO4^3-. So, each unit contributes 3 K+ and 1 PO4^3-.

So, the concentrations are:

[K+] = 3 * 0.0075 m = 0.0225 m.

[PO4^3-] = 0.0075 m.

Ionic strength I is ½ Σ ci zi².

So,

I = ½ [ (0.0225)(1)^2 + (0.0075)(3)^2 ]

= ½ [0.0225 + (0.0075 *9)]

= ½ [0.0225 + 0.0675]

= ½ (0.09) = 0.045 m.

Yes, that's correct.

So, I = 0.045 m.

Then, κ⁻¹ = 0.304 / sqrt(0.045) ≈ 0.304 / 0.2121 ≈ 1.432 nm.

So the closest option is I:1.4 nm.

Wait, but wait another thing: the original formula for κ⁻¹ is actually 0.304 / sqrt(I) in nm when I is in mol/L. So in this case, the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, I've heard that sometimes the formula uses I in terms of molarity, and for molality, the term is similar for dilute solutions.

So, I think I'm confident that 1.4 nm is correct, which is option I.

To calculate the Debye-Hückel screening length, \( \frac{1}{\kappa} \), for a \( 0.0075 \, \mathrm{m} \) solution of \( \mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{PO}_4 \) at \( 298 \, \mathrm{K} \), we use the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\kappa} \, (\mathrm{nm}) \approx \frac{0.304}{\sqrt{I}}
\]

where \( I \) is the ionic strength of the solution in mol/kg (molal). The ionic strength is calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \sum c_i z_i^2
\]

For \( \mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{PO}_4 \), which dissociates into \( 3 \, \mathrm{K}^+ \) and \( 1 \, \mathrm{PO}_4^{3-} \), the concentrations of the ions are:

\[
[\mathrm{K}^+] = 3 \times 0.0075 \, \mathrm{m} = 0.0225 \, \mathrm{m}, \quad [\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}] = 0.0075 \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

Substituting into the ionic strength formula:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \left[ (0.0225)(1^2) + (0.0075)(3^2) \right]
\]

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.0225 + 0.0675 \right] = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.09 = 0.045 \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

Now, calculate \( \frac{1}{\kappa} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\kappa} = \frac{0.304}{\sqrt{0.045}}.
\]

First, compute \( \sqrt{0.045} \):

\[
\sqrt{0.045} \approx 0.2121.
\]

Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\kappa} = \frac{0.304}{0.2121} \approx 1.432 \, \mathrm{nm}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 1.4 \, \mathrm{nm} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
