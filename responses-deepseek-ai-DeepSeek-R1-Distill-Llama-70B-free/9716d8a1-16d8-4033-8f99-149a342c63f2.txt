Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about designing an electrochemical cell using lithium and chlorine gas. The cell notation given is Li | LiCl(fused salt) | Cl₂. The goal is to find the optimum ratio of lithium weight to chlorine weight. The atomic weights provided are Li as 6.94 and Cl as 35.5. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in electrochemical cells, the anode is where oxidation happens, and the cathode is where reduction occurs. So I should figure out which is which here. Lithium is a metal, so it's likely to be the anode because metals tend to lose electrons (oxidize) in such cells. Chlorine gas is probably the cathode, where reduction happens.

Wait, the cell notation is Li | LiCl | Cl₂. So, the setup is Li metal as the anode, LiCl as the electrolyte, and Cl₂ gas as the cathode. So the reactions should be:

At the anode (oxidation): Li → Li⁺ + e⁻
Each Li atom loses one electron. Since Li has a +1 charge when ionized, that makes sense.

At the cathode (reduction): Cl₂ + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻
Each Cl₂ molecule gains two electrons to form two Cl⁻ ions.

To balance the electrons, I need to find the stoichiometry between Li and Cl₂. Let me think about the electrons each half-reaction produces or consumes.

For each Li atom, one electron is released. So for n moles of Li, n moles of electrons are produced. At the cathode, each Cl₂ molecule requires 2 electrons to be reduced. So for each mole of Cl₂, 2 moles of electrons are consumed.

To balance the electrons, the number of electrons from Li must equal those consumed by Cl₂. So:

Moles of electrons from Li = moles of Li × 1 (since each Li gives one e⁻)
Moles of electrons used by Cl₂ = moles of Cl₂ × 2

So setting them equal: moles_Li × 1 = moles_Cl₂ × 2 → moles_Li = 2 × moles_Cl₂

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, because for each Cl₂ molecule, two electrons are needed. So if you have x moles of Cl₂, that's 2x moles of electrons. Each mole of Li gives 1 mole of e⁻, so the moles of Li must be 2x to provide 2x electrons.

So the ratio of moles Li to Cl₂ is 2:1. But wait, the question is about the weight ratio of Li to Cl₂. So I need to convert moles to grams.

Molar mass of Li is given as 6.94 g/mol. Cl₂ has a molar mass of 2 × 35.5 = 71 g/mol.

So, for 2 moles of Li and 1 mole of Cl₂:

Weight of Li = 2 × 6.94 = 13.88 g
Weight of Cl₂ = 1 × 71 = 71 g

So the ratio is 13.88 : 71. Let me compute that. 13.88 divided by 71.

13.88 /71 ≈ 0.195. Hmm, that's approximately 0.196. Looking at the options, option B is 0.196. So the ratio is Li weight to Cl₂ weight as 0.196:1. So the answer should be B.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The cell reaction would be:

2 Li → 2 Li⁺ + 2e⁻
Cl₂ + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻

Combined, 2Li + Cl₂ → 2LiCl

So yes, the molar ratio is 2 Li : 1 Cl₂. So the weight ratio is (2 × 6.94) / (71) = 13.88 /71 ≈ 0.195. So the Li/Cl₂ weight ratio is about 0.196, which is option B.

To determine the optimum ratio of lithium (Li) weight to chlorine gas (Cl₂) weight in the given electrochemical cell, we analyze the half-reactions and their stoichiometry:

1. **Anode (oxidation):**  
   \[
   \text{Li} \rightarrow \text{Li}^+ + e^-
   \]  
   Each lithium atom loses one electron.

2. **Cathode (reduction):**  
   \[
   \text{Cl}_2 + 2e^- \rightarrow 2\text{Cl}^-
   \]  
   Each chlorine molecule gains two electrons.

To balance the electrons, the number of electrons released by lithium must equal the number of electrons consumed by chlorine. For every mole of Cl₂, 2 moles of electrons are required. Therefore, 2 moles of Li are needed to provide these 2 moles of electrons. This gives a molar ratio of Li to Cl₂ as **2:1**.

Next, we calculate the weight ratio using the given atomic weights:  
- Molar mass of Li = 6.94 g/mol  
- Molar mass of Cl₂ = 2 × 35.5 = 71 g/mol  

For 2 moles of Li and 1 mole of Cl₂:  
\[
\text{Weight of Li} = 2 \times 6.94 = 13.88 \, \text{g}  
\]  
\[
\text{Weight of Cl}_2 = 1 \times 71 = 71 \, \text{g}  
\]  

The weight ratio of Li to Cl₂ is:  
\[
\frac{\text{Weight of Li}}{\text{Weight of Cl}_2} = \frac{13.88}{71} \approx 0.196  
\]

Thus, the optimum ratio of lithium weight to chlorine weight is approximately **0.196**, corresponding to option **B**.
