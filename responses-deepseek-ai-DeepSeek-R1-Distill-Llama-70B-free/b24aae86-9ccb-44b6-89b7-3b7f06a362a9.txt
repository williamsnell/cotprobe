Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with polytropic processes. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have two pounds of oxygen undergoing a polytropic compression. The initial state is 14 psia and 70°F, and the final pressure is 98 psia. The process follows PV^1.3 = C. We need to find the heat transferred (a) and the change in entropy (b). The options are given from A to J, so I'll need to calculate these values and match them.

First, I remember that for a polytropic process, the equation is PV^n = C, where n is 1.3 in this case. So, I can use the polytropic relations to find the work done and the heat transfer.

Wait, but since it's a compression, I think the work done on the system will be positive, and heat might be released, so Q would be negative. But I'm not entirely sure about the sign conventions here. I think the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if work is done on the system, W is negative, making Q = ΔU + W. Hmm, maybe I should get back to that later.

Let me jot down the given data:

Mass (m) = 2 lbm
Initial pressure (P1) = 14 psia
Initial temperature (T1) = 70°F
Final pressure (P2) = 98 psia
n = 1.3
R (gas constant for O2) = 0.062 Btu/lbm-°R
c_p = 0.217 Btu/lbm-°R

Okay, so the first thing I think I need to do is find the initial and final temperatures. Because with those, I can find the change in internal energy and then use the polytropic relations to find the heat transfer.

Wait, but I can also find the work done using the polytropic work formula. The formula for work in a polytropic process is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1), but I don't have V1 or V2. Alternatively, I remember that for a polytropic process, the work can be expressed in terms of temperatures. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can use the relation between T and P in a polytropic process. The equation is T1 / T2 = (P1 / P2)^((n-1)/n). Because for polytropic processes, TV^(n-1) = constant, so combining with the ideal gas law... Maybe I should derive this.

From the ideal gas law, PV = mRT. So V = mRT/P. Substituting into PV^n = C: P (mRT/P)^n = C => P*(m^n R^n T^n)/P^n = C => P^{1 - n} T^n = C. So, P1^{1-n} T1^n = P2^{1-n} T2^n. Taking the ratio, (T1/T2)^n = (P1/P2)^{1-n}. So, T1/T2 = (P1/P2)^{(1-n)/n}.

Wait, that's the same as (P1/P2)^{(1-n)/n} = (P1/P2)^{-(n-1)/n} = (P2/P1)^{(n-1)/n}. So, T1 / T2 = (P2/P1)^{(n-1)/n}.

Wait, no, let me re-calculate.

We have P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n.

And from ideal gas, V1 = m R T1 / P1, similarly V2 = m R T2 / P2.

So substituting into P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n:

P1 (m R T1 / P1)^n = P2 (m R T2 / P2)^n.

Simplify: P1 * (m R)^n T1^n / P1^n = P2 (m R)^n T2^n / P2^n.

Cancel out (m R)^n on both sides:

P1 T1^n / P1^n = P2 T2^n / P2^n.

So (T1^n)/(P1^n) = (T2^n)/(P2^n) * (P2/P1) [Wait, maybe I should rearrange differently.]

Wait, let me write it as (T1 / T2)^n = (P1 / P2) * (P2^n / P1^n) ??? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me take the equation:

P1^(1 - n) T1^n = P2^(1 - n) T2^n.

Divide both sides by P2^(1 -n) T2^n:

(T1/T2)^n = (P1/P2)^(1 - n) * (P2/P2) ??? No, wait, taking the ratio:

(T1/T2)^n = (P1/P2)^(1 -n) * (P1^(n-1) / P2^(n-1)) )? Maybe not the best approach. Alternatively, let me take both sides to the power 1/n:

(T1/T2) = (P1/P2)^{(1 -n)/n}.

Wait, so (1 - n)/n with n=1.3 would be (1 - 1.3)/1.3 = (-0.3)/1.3 ≈ -0.2308. So T1/T2 = (P1/P2)^(-0.2308) = (P2/P1)^0.2308.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. P1 is 14 psia, P2 is 98 psia. So P2/P1 = 98/14 = 7.

So T1/T2 = 7^0.2308. Let me compute that. Hmm. 7^0.23 is approximately e^(0.23 * ln7). Ln7 is about 1.9459, so 0.23 * 1.9459 ≈ 0.447. e^0.447 ≈ 1.563.

So T1 = 70°F. Wait, wait, I need to convert that to absolute temperature. Because all these equations require temperatures in absolute terms, like Rankine.

So T1 = 70°F + 459.67 = 529.67 °R.

So T2 = T1 / (7^0.2308) ≈ 529.67 / 1.563 ≈ Let's compute that.

529.67 divided by 1.563. Let me approximate: 1.563 * 340 = approx 1.563*300=468.9, 1.563*40=62.52 → total 531.42. Oh wait, that's just about 529.67. So 340 would give 531.42, which is a bit higher than 529.67. So maybe around 339. Let me compute 1.563 * 339 = ?

1.563 * 300 = 468.9
1.563 * 39 = approx 61. (1.563 *40=62.52, so 39 is 62.52 -1.563=60.957)
Total 468.9 +60.957= 529.857. That's very close to 529.67, so T2 ≈ 339 °R.

Wait, that's a bit confusing because 339 R is about 339 - 459.67 = negative in Fahrenheit, but wait, no, 339 R is (339 - 459.67) = -120.67 F, which is really cold. That can't be right because we're compressing a gas, so the temperature should rise, right?

Wait, wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in calculation. Because when you compress a gas, the temperature should increase, but according to this, T2 is lower than T1. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I messed up the exponent.

Wait, let's re-express the formula correctly. So from the equation, T1 / T2 = (P1 / P2)^((n-1)/n). Wait, since n is 1.3, which is greater than 1, and P2 > P1, so (P1/P2) is less than 1. Let's compute (n-1)/n = 0.3/1.3 ≈ 0.2308.

So (P1/P2) = 14/98 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1429. So (P1/P2)^0.2308 = (0.1429)^0.2308.

Wait, 0.1429 is 1/7. So 1/7^0.2308. Let me compute that. Hmm, 7^0.2308 is about 1.563 as before, so 1/7^0.2308 ≈ 0.64.

So T1/T2 = 0.64 → T2 = T1 / 0.64 ≈ 529.67 / 0.64 ≈ 827.27 °R.

Ah, that makes more sense. So T2 is higher than T1, as expected during compression.

Wait, so I messed up earlier when I thought T1/T2 = (P2/P1)^0.2308. No, it's (P1/P2)^0.2308, which is 1/7^0.2308 ≈ 0.64, so T1 is lower than T2.

So T2 ≈ 529.67 / 0.64 ≈ Let me compute that more accurately.

529.67 divided by 0.64.

Well, 0.64 * 800 = 512. So 512 is 0.64 *800.

529.67-512 =17.67 left.

17.67 / 0.64 ≈ 27.6 (since 0.64*27=17.28, 0.64*27.6 ≈ 17.664).

So total T2 ≈ 800 +27.6 ≈ 827.6 °R.

That's approximately 827.6 - 459.67 = 367.9 °F. That seems really high, but considering it's a compression, maybe possible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, let's double-check the formula. The relation is T1 / T2 = (P1 / P2) ^ [(n-1)/n]. Since n=1.3, (n-1)/n is 0.3/1.3 ≈ 0.2308.

So yes, T1/T2 = (14/98)^(0.2308) = (1/7)^0.2308 ≈ 0.64 as before.

So T2 is higher. So T2 ≈ 529.67 / 0.64 ≈ 827.6 °R.

Wait, 827.6 R is very high for such a compression, but perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute using logarithms.

Compute (1/7)^0.2308.

Take natural logs: ln(1/7) = -ln(7) ≈ -1.9459.

Multiply by 0.2308: -1.9459 * 0.2308 ≈ -0.449.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.449) ≈ 0.637 as before.

So T2 = T1 / 0.637 ≈ 529.67 / 0.637 ≈ let me compute that accurately.

529.67 divided by 0.637.

Well, 0.637 * 800 = 509.6.

529.67 - 509.6 = 20.07.

20.07 / 0.637 ≈ 31.52.

So T2 ≈ 800 +31.52 = 831.52 °R.

So about 831.5 °R.

Wait, let me check 0.637 * 831.5 = ?

0.637 *800=509.6, 0.637*31.5=20.1905, total 529.79, which is close to 529.67, so T2≈831.5 °R.

So now, I can compute the change in internal energy ΔU. For an ideal gas, ΔU = m c_v (T2 - T1). But wait, I have c_p given, not c_v. I need to relate c_p and c_v.

I remember that for ideal gases, c_p - c_v = R.

So c_v = c_p - R = 0.217 - 0.062 = 0.155 Btu/lbm-°R.

So ΔU = m * c_v * (T2 - T1).

m=2 lbm, T2=831.5, T1=529.67.

ΔT = 831.5 -529.67 = 301.83 °R.

So ΔU = 2 * 0.155 * 301.83.

Compute that:

2 * 0.155 = 0.31.

0.31 * 301.83 ≈ 93.567 Btu.

Wait, so ΔU ≈93.567 Btu.

Now, the work done during a polytropic process is given by W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1).

Alternatively, since it's a compression, work is done on the system, so W would be negative if we consider W as work done by the system. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the sign conventions here.

Alternatively, the formula for work in a polytropic process can be expressed in terms of temperatures. There's a formula that W = m R (T1 - T2) / (1 - n).

Wait, no, let me think again. From the ideal gas law, PV = mRT. So V = mRT/P.

So substituting into W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1):

W = [P1*(m R T1/P1) - P2*(m R T2/P2)] / (n-1)

Simplify:

= [m R T1 - m R T2] / (n-1)

= m R (T1 - T2) / (n - 1)

Since n=1.3, n-1=0.3.

So W = 2 lbm * 0.062 Btu/lbm-°R * (529.67 - 831.5) / 0.3.

Compute numerator first: 529.67 -831.5 = -301.83 °R.

So W = 2 * 0.062 * (-301.83) / 0.3.

Calculate step by step:

2 * 0.062 = 0.124.

0.124 * (-301.83) ≈ -37.427.

Divide by 0.3: -37.427 / 0.3 ≈ -124.757 Btu.

Wait, that seems like a lot. But let me think: work done on the system during compression is positive? Or is this W the work done by the system?

Wait, in the formula W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1), if it's compression, P2 V2 > P1 V1, so (P1 V1 - P2 V2) is negative, so W is negative if n >1. So if W is negative, that implies work is done on the system, which makes sense.

So the work done BY the system is negative, meaning work is done ON the system.

But in the first law, ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify.

First law: ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done BY the system.

But in this case, W is negative because the system is doing negative work (work is done on it). So W = -124.757 Btu.

Wait, no, let's make it clear. The formula we used gives W as the work done by the system. So if W is negative, it means the system is doing negative work, i.e., work is done on it. So in the first law, ΔU = Q - W. So if W is negative, it's like adding a positive value.

So, using the numbers:

ΔU ≈93.567 Btu.

W = -124.757 Btu (since work done by system is negative).

So, ΔU = Q - W → Q = ΔU - W.

Wait no: ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. Since W is negative here, Q = ΔU - (-124.757) = ΔU + 124.757.

Wait, but wait, wait: 

Wait, the formula I derived earlier was W = m R (T1 - T2)/(n-1). Let's compute that again.

T1 is 529.67, T2 is 831.5, so T1 - T2 = -301.83.

So W = 2 * 0.062 * (-301.83) / 0.3 → 

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.062 = 0.124.

0.124 * (-301.83) ≈ -37.427.

Divide by 0.3: -37.427 / 0.3 ≈ -124.757 Btu.

So W is approximately -124.757 Btu. Since W is work done by the system, and it's negative, that means 124.757 Btu of work is done on the system.

So first law: ΔU = Q + W_on, where W_on is the work done on the system.

But ΔU is 93.567 Btu, W_on is 124.757 Btu.

So, 93.567 = Q + 124.757 → Q = 93.567 - 124.757 = -31.19 Btu.

Wait, so Q is approximately -31.19 Btu. Negative means heat is released from the system.

Looking at the options, let's see the (a) values:

Options are:

A: -34.2

B: -36.2

C: -28.2

D: -32.2

E: -30.2

F: -29.2

G: -35.2

H: -27.2

I: -31.2

J: -33.2

So -31.19 is closest to option I, which is (a) -31.2 Btu.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Compute ΔU:

c_v = c_p
