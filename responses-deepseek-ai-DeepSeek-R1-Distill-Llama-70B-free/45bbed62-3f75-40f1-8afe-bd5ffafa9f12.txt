Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

After having several drinks in a bar, a man and his friend drove by a large home with its lights out. With the man sitting in the passenger seat, the friend pulled the car over. They were feeling drunk and aggressive from the drinks. After discussing it, they decided it was a safe bet to enter the home and see what they could take. They broke in and took several bags of jewelry. While driving away, they were stopped and arrested for burglary. The passenger used the defense that he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to enter the home for the purpose of committing a felony therein. Do the facts described here indicate that the defense will likely prevail at a trial on the merits?

Options:

A: Yes, because the alcohol impaired his judgment, making it impossible for him to make a rational decision.
B: No, because intoxication is never a defense to the commission of a felony.
C: Yes, because the feeling of being drunk and aggressive were not his natural mental state and therefore mens rea was defeated.
D: No, because they had the intent to commit the crime before they even entered the home.
E: Yes, because he was in fact too intoxicated to form the intent needed to prove burglary.
F: Yes, because he was the passenger and not the driver, thus was not directly involved in the act.
G: No, because the act of discussing and deciding to commit the act shows intent, regardless of intoxication.
H: No, because being intoxicated does not diminish the fact that a felony was committed.
I: No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.
J: Yes, because he was under the influence of alcohol and therefore cannot be held responsible for his actions.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with intoxication as a defense. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A man and his friend were out drinking, then drove by a house with the lights off. The friend was driving, the man was the passenger. They were both feeling drunk and aggressive. They discussed it and decided it was a safe bet to enter the home to take stuff. They broke in, took jewelry, and then got caught and arrested for burglary.

The question is about the passenger's defense. He's claiming he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to enter the home for the purpose of committing a felony inside. So, the issue here is whether his intoxication negates the specific intent required for burglary.

I remember that burglary is a specific intent crime. Specific intent means that the defendant must have the intention not just to commit the act, but also the additional intent required for the crime. For burglary, that's usually entering a structure with the intent to commit a felony inside.

Now, intoxication can sometimes be a defense. I think it's different in different jurisdictions, but generally, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense to general intent crimes, but it might be a defense to specific intent crimes. Because if you're so drunk that you couldn't form the specific intent, then you can't be guilty of that crime.

So, if the passenger was so intoxicated that he couldn't form the intent to commit a felony once inside, then the defense might work. But the question is whether the facts support that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because alcohol impaired his judgment, making rational decision impossible. I think this is more about whether he made a mistake, not necessarily intent. Intoxication affects intent, not just judgment.

Option B says no because intoxication is never a defense to a felony. I don't think that's correct. Some specific intent felonies can have intoxication as a defense.

Option C says yes because the feelings were not his natural state, so mens rea was defeated. I'm not sure about this. Intoxication doesn't erase mens rea; it's about whether the person could form the required intent.

Option D says no because intent was formed before entering. But the point is whether he could form the intent at the time of the act.

Option E says yes because he was too intoxicated to form intent. This seems correct if that's the case, but we need more facts.

Option F says yes because he was the passenger. But being a passenger doesn't necessarily mean he didn't have intent. He still agreed to the plan.

Option G says no because discussing shows intent. That's a good point. If they discussed and decided to commit the act, that indicates they had the intent, even if intoxicated.

Option H says no because intoxication doesn't excuse felony. As I thought earlier, it's not a blanket excuse, but specific to specific intent.

Option I says no because the facts don't show he was too intoxicated. The facts say they were feeling drunk and aggressive, but does that mean they couldn't form intent? Maybe not enough.

Option J says yes because he was under influence. But voluntary intoxication isn't a complete defense; it can negate specific intent, but the question is whether it's sufficient here.

So, the key is whether the intoxication prevented him from forming the specific intent. The fact that they discussed and decided to commit the burglary suggests that they had the intent, even if they were drunk. Intoxication might reduce their inhibitions but not necessarily erase their ability to form intent.

Also, I remember that courts often look at whether the defendant could form the intent despite intoxication. If they were capable of discussing and planning the act, that indicates they had the necessary intent.

So, the defense would likely not prevail because their actions showed they had the intent. Therefore, the answer would be G or I.

Wait, option G says no because discussing shows intent, regardless of intoxication. Option I says no because the facts don't show he was too intoxicated to form intent.

In this case, the men were drunk and aggressive, but they still had a discussion and made a decision. That indicates they had the intent. So, the defense of intoxication probably wouldn't work because their actions demonstrate intent.

So, the correct answer is G or I. Let me think again.

Option G is about the discussion showing intent despite intoxication. Option I is about the facts not indicating enough intoxication to negate intent.

I think G is the better answer because it points out that their discussion and decision show they had the intent, so intoxication doesn't negate that.

The question revolves around whether the passenger's intoxication can serve as a defense to burglary, which is a specific intent crime requiring the intent to enter a structure with the purpose of committing a felony inside. Voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent, but the facts here indicate that the passenger and his friend discussed and decided to commit the burglary, demonstrating intent. This suggests that despite their intoxication, they were capable of forming the necessary intent. Therefore, the defense is unlikely to prevail.

The correct answer is:

G: No, because the act of discussing and deciding to commit the act shows intent, regardless of intoxication.

Answer: G
