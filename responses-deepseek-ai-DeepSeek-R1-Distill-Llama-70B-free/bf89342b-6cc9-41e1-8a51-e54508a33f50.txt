Okay, so I have this question about utilitarianism. Hmm, I remember that utilitarianism is a theory in ethics, right? I think it's about doing what's best for the most people. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The question is asking by which principle utilitarianism is defined. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Maximising personal pleasure. Wait, no, I think that's more like hedonism. Utilitarianism isn't just about personal pleasure; it's about overall happiness or utility.

Option B: Maximisation of outcomes for individuals. Not sure. It sounds a bit vague. Maybe it's about the greatest good for the greatest number, which would be more about groups than individuals.

Option C: The least worst outcome for everybody. That sounds more like a compromise, maybe like the worst option but acceptable. I don't think that's utilitarianism. Maybe that's more of a minimax approach or something else.

Option D: Equality of opportunity for everyone. That's more related to fairness and justice, not directly about outcomes. Utilitarianism isn't primarily about equality of opportunity, though some versions might consider it.

Option E: Equality for everyone. Yeah, equality is a different concept. Utilitarianism focuses on outcomes rather than equality. So E might not be it.

Option F: The best outcome for the minority. No, that's the opposite of what I remember. Utilitarianism is about the majority, not the minority. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Ensuring no harm is done. That's more like the non-maleficence principle in medical ethics. Utilitarianism allows for harm if it leads to a greater good, so G doesn't fit.

Option H: The best outcome for the majority. Oh, wait, that rings a bell. I think this is the one. Utilitarianism is the greatest happiness for the greatest number, so the best outcome for the majority. So H sounds right.

Option I: The least worst outcome for the majority. That's a bit confusing. I think it's not about the least worst but the best possible. So I doesn't seem right.

Option J: Maximising wealth and resources for everyone. That's more about economic distribution. Utilitarianism can consider wealth, but it's broader, including happiness and utility, not just material wealth.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: The best outcome for the majority of people.

The principle that defines utilitarianism is the idea of achieving the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. This aligns with the concept of maximizing the best outcome for the majority. Among the options provided, H correctly captures this principle.

Answer: H
