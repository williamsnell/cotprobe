Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about average fixed costs for a shoe manufacturer. I remember from my studies that average fixed cost (AFC) is the fixed cost per unit of production.

The question says that at an output of 10,000 shoes, the average fixed cost is $0.50 per shoe. Now, they're asking what the average fixed cost would be if the manufacturer expands production to 12,500 shoes.

Wait, fixed costs are costs that don't change with the level of production, right? Like rent, salaries, machinery costsâ€”those don't vary whether you produce more or less. So the total fixed cost (TFC) remains the same, but when you calculate average fixed cost, you divide that TFC by the number of units produced.

So, let me break it down. At 10,000 shoes, AFC is $0.50. That means the total fixed cost is AFC multiplied by the quantity. So TFC = 0.50 * 10,000 = $5,000. Oh, wait, because 10,000 times 0.50 is indeed 5,000. So the TFC is $5,000.

Now, if production increases to 12,500 shoes, the TFC remains $5,000 because it's fixed. So the new AFC would be TFC divided by the new quantity. So AFC = 5000 / 12,500.

Let me calculate that. 5000 divided by 12,500. Hmm, 12,500 is 10,000 plus 2,500. So 5000 divided by 12,500. Maybe I can simplify this fraction. 5000/12500. Divide numerator and denominator by 2500, that gives 2/5. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So $0.40 per shoe.

Looking at the options, option D is $0.40. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up any concepts. Sometimes people confuse fixed costs with variable costs, but the question clearly states average fixed cost. And since fixed costs don't change, spreading them over more units reduces the average. So yes, when output increases from 10k to 12.5k, AFC decreases.

The average fixed cost (AFC) is calculated by dividing the total fixed cost (TFC) by the number of units produced. Initially, at an output of 10,000 shoes, the AFC is $0.50 per shoe. This means the TFC is:

\[
\text{TFC} = \text{AFC} \times \text{Quantity} = 0.50 \times 10,000 = \$5,000.
\]

When production expands to 12,500 shoes, the TFC remains unchanged at \$5,000. The new AFC is then:

\[
\text{AFC} = \frac{\text{TFC}}{\text{New Quantity}} = \frac{5,000}{12,500} = 0.40.
\]

Thus, the average fixed cost decreases to \$0.40 per shoe when production increases to 12,500 shoes. The correct answer is:

D: $0.40
