Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the median of Brian's team quiz scores. The scores are given as 8, 6, 9, 7, 10, 9, 5, 4, 9. Hmm, I remember that the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. But wait, let me make sure I get this right.

First, I think I need to sort the scores in ascending order. So let's list them out and rearrange from smallest to largest. The scores are: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10. Wait, let me check that again. Original list is 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9. So when sorted, it should be 4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10. Yeah, that looks correct.

Now, how many numbers are there? Let me count: 4 is one, 5 two, 6 three, 7 four, 8 five, 9 six, another 9 seven, another 9 eight, and 10 nine. So there are 9 scores in total. Since the median is the middle value, and there are 9 numbers, which is odd, the median will be the 5th number in the sorted list.

Let me count to the fifth number. The sorted list is [4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10]. So the first is 4, second 5, third 6, fourth 7, fifth 8. So the fifth number is 8. Wait, but wait a second. Is that right? Or did I miscount?

Wait, no, the fifth position. Let me index them. Position 1:4, 2:5, 3:6, 4:7, 5:8, 6:9, 7:9, 8:9, 9:10. So yes, the fifth is 8. So the median should be 8. But looking at the options, choice D is 8, so that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, am I remembering correctly how median works? For an odd number of observations, it's the middle one. So yes, with 9 numbers, the 5th is correct. So I think that's right. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

The scores of Brian's team are sorted in ascending order as follows: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10. Since there are 9 scores, the median is the middle value, which is the 5th number in the sorted list. The 5th number is 8. Therefore, the median is 8.

Answer: D
