Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating property tax. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question says the assessed value of a house is $3,250, and the tax rate is 2.351%. I need to find out what the property tax is from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that to calculate tax, you usually multiply the value by the tax rate. But wait, percentages can be tricky sometimes. Oh right, the tax rate is a percentage, so I should convert that percentage into a decimal first before multiplying.

So the tax rate is 2.351%. To convert that to a decimal, I think you divide by 100. Let me do that: 2.351 divided by 100 equals 0.02351. Got it. So the tax rate in decimal form is 0.02351.

Now, the assessed value is $3,250. So I need to multiply 3,250 by 0.02351. Let me write that down: 3,250 * 0.02351.

Wait, maybe I should break it down to make the multiplication easier. Let's see, 3,250 can be considered as 3,000 + 250. Alternatively, maybe just do straight multiplication.

Calculating 3,250 times 0.02351. Let me do this step by step. 

First, 3,250 multiplied by 0.02 is 65. Because 3,250 * 0.02 is the same as 3,250 * 2/100, which is 65. Then, 3,250 multiplied by 0.003 is 9.75, since 3,250 * 0.001 is 3.25, so three times that is 9.75. Then, 3,250 multiplied by 0.00051. Hmm, that's a bit trickier.

Wait, 0.0005 is 5e-4, so 3,250 * 0.0005 is 1.625. And 0.00001 is 3.25 * 1e-5, which is 0.0325. Wait, maybe I should calculate 0.00051 as 0.0005 + 0.00001. So 3,250 *0.0005 is 1.625, and 3,250 *0.00001 is 0.0325. Adding those together, 1.625 + 0.0325 equals 1.6575.

Wait, but no, the original number after 0.02 and 0.003 is 0.00051. So maybe I should calculate 0.02351 as 0.02 + 0.003 + 0.00051. So then, the total tax would be (3,250 * 0.02) + (3,250 * 0.003) + (3,250 * 0.00051).

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate all of it at once. Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to just do 3,250 multiplied by 2.351 and then divide by 100, because 2.351% is 2.351 per 100.

So 3,250 multiplied by 2.351. Let me compute that. Let's break 2.351 into 2 + 0.3 + 0.05 + 0.001.

So first, 3,250 * 2 = 6,500.

Then 3,250 * 0.3 = 975.

3,250 * 0.05 = 162.5.

3,250 * 0.001 = 3.25.

Adding all those together: 6,500 + 975 is 7,475. Then plus 162.5 is 7,637.5, and then plus 3.25 gives 7,640.75.

Wait, wait. No, that can't be right. Because 3,250 * 2.351 is 3,250 multiplied by each part, but that seems like a lot. Wait, 3,250 * 2 is 6,500, correct. 3,250 * 0.3 is 975, correct. 0.05 is 162.5, correct. 0.001 is 3.25, correct. So total is 6,500 + 975 = 7,475, plus 162.5 is 7,637.5, plus 3.25 is 7,640.75.

But wait, that's 3,250 * 2.351, but the tax rate is 2.351%, which is 2.351 per 100, so the tax is (3,250 * 2.351)/100. So I need to divide 7,640.75 by 100, which gives 76.4075.

Hmm, so the tax would be $76.4075. Now looking at the options, let me check. The options are:

A: $64.12  
B: $83.69  
C: $76.41  
D: $68.24  
E: $74.58  
F: $80.35  
G: $81.23  
H: $78.94  
I: $72.51  
J: $69.75  

So 76.4075 is approximately $76.41, which is option C. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation to be sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 3,250 * 2.351.

Alternatively, using another method: 3,250 * 2.351.

I can compute this as 3,250 * 2 = 6,500.

3,250 * 0.3 = 975.

3,250 * 0.05 = 162.5.

3,250 * 0.001 = 3.25.

Adding all these: 6,500 + 975 = 7,475; +162.5 is 7,637.5; +3.25 is 7,640.75.

Then, 7,640.75 divided by 100 is 76.4075, which rounds to 76.41. So yes, option C is correct.

Alternatively, I could use a calculator approach. Let me try another way. 3,250 * 2.351. Let's compute 3,250 * 2 = 6,500. Then 3,250 * 0.351.

Wait, maybe that's a better way. 3,250 * 0.3 is 975, 3,250 * 0.05 is 162.5, 3,250 * 0.001 is 3.25. So 975 + 162.5 = 1,137.5 + 3.25 is 1,140.75.

So 3,250 * 0.351 is 1,140.75. Then adding to 6,500 gives 7,640.75, same as before. Divide by 100 gives 76.4075.

Yes, so the tax is $76.41. So the correct answer is option C.

To calculate the property tax on a house with an assessed value of $3,250 and a tax rate of 2.351%, follow these steps:

1. **Convert the tax rate to a decimal**:  
   Divide 2.351 by 100 to get 0.02351.

2. **Multiply the assessed value by the tax rate in decimal form**:  
   \( 3,250 \times 0.02351 = 76.4075 \).

3. **Round the result to two decimal places**:  
   \( 76.4075 \approx 76.41 \).

Thus, the property tax is **$76.41**, which corresponds to **option C**.
