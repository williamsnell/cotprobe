Question:

Which of the following statements about the protein requirement is correct


Options:

A: The protein requirement can be less than the demand.
B: The protein requirement is equal to the demand minus the efficiency of utilization.
C: The protein requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization.
D: The protein requirement is always higher than the demand.
E: The protein requirement is the same for all individuals regardless of age or health status.
F: The protein requirement is equal to the demand multiplied by the efficiency of utilization.
G: The protein requirement is always the same as the demand.

Okay, so I've got this question about protein requirements and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, I remember that protein needs can vary based on factors like age, health, and activity level, but I'm not entirely sure how the terms 'requirement' and 'demand' are used here.

The question is asking which statement is correct about the protein requirement. The options are A through G. Let me think about each one.

Option A says the protein requirement can be less than the demand. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think the requirement is what the body needs, and demand is maybe how much is needed under certain conditions. So if the body's demand increases, like during growth or illness, the requirement would go up, not be less. So A might not be correct.

Option B states that the requirement is equal to demand minus efficiency of utilization. Hmm, that sounds a bit mathematical, but I'm not sure. Efficiency is like how well the body uses the protein. Subtracting it from demand doesn't quite make sense because if efficiency is high, you'd need less, right? Or maybe the formula is demand divided by efficiency.

Option C says requirement equals demand divided by efficiency. Oh, right! Because if the efficiency is lower, you'd need more protein to meet the demand. For example, if your body uses 80% of the protein you consume, you'd need more than the demand to account for the 20% loss. So this seems plausible.

Option D claims the requirement is always higher than the demand. But wait, if efficiency is 100%, then requirement would equal demand. So it's not always higher, only when efficiency is less than 100%. So D isn't correct.

Option E suggests that protein requirement is the same for everyone. No, that's definitely wrong. It varies by age, like more for children, pregnant women, athletes, etc. So E is incorrect.

Option F says requirement equals demand multiplied by efficiency. Wait, that would increase the requirement when efficiency is higher, which doesn't make sense. Because higher efficiency should mean you need less protein intake. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says the requirement is always the same as demand. That can't be right because it doesn't account for utilization efficiency. If your body doesn't absorb all the protein, you need more than the demand. So G is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct formula should be: requirement = demand / efficiency. So the correct answer must be option C.

The correct answer is:

C: The protein requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization.

This is because the protein requirement accounts for how efficiently the body utilizes the protein consumed. If efficiency is lower, more protein is needed to meet the demand, making the formula "requirement = demand / efficiency" accurate.

Answer: C
