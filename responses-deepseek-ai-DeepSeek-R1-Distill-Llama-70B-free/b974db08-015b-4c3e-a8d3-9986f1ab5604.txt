Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about barometers. Hmm, I remember that barometers measure atmospheric pressure using a column of liquid. Mercury is commonly used, but this question is about gallium. Interesting.

The question gives the density of liquid gallium as 6.09 g/cm³ at 35°C. I need to find the height of the gallium column when it's under 1 atm pressure. The options are A through J, with various mmGa values.

Wait, I think the formula for the height of a fluid column in a barometer is h = pressure / (density * gravity). Oh right, because P = ρgh, so h = P/(ρg). 

But wait, pressure here is 1 atm. I should convert that into the right units. Let me recall, 1 atm is 101325 Pascals. Oh wait, no, wait: in terms of units that work with density in g/cm³, maybe I should use different units. Because 1 atm is also 760 mmHg, but that's mercury. Oh wait, right, mercury's density is higher, so the height for gallium should be higher than mercury's 760 mm.

Wait, wait. Mercury has a density of about 13.6 g/cm³. So if Mercury's column is 760 mm at 1 atm, then gallium, which is less dense, should have a higher column. So the options are all above 1400 mm, which makes sense.

So the formula again: h = P / (ρ * g). Let's plug in the numbers.

But first, I need to make sure the units are compatible. Density is in g/cm³, which is the same as kg/m³ multiplied by 1000, wait no, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. Wait, no, wait, 1 g is 0.001 kg, 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 1 g/cm³ is (0.001 kg) / (0.01 m)^3 = 0.001 / 0.000001 = 1000 kg/m³. So 6.09 g/cm³ is 6090 kg/m³? Wait no, no, wait, 6.09 g/cm³ would be 6.09 * 1000 kg/m³ = 6090 kg/m³. Right.

But maybe using CGS units would be easier here since the density is given in g/cm³. Let me think: Pressure in dynes/cm², density in g/cm³, and g in cm/s².

So 1 atm in dynes/cm² is known. I remember that 1 atm is 1.01325e6 dynes/cm². Or wait, wait, 1 atm is about 1.013e6 Pascals, and 1 Pascal is 10 dynes/cm². Oh right, because 1 Pa = 1 N/m² = 10^5 dynes/(10^4 cm²) ) = 10 dynes/cm². So 1 atm is 1.01325e6 Pascals * 10 dynes/cm² per Pa. So that's 1.01325e7 dynes/cm².

Wait, let me calculate that correctly. 1 Pa = 1 N/m². Since 1 N = 10^5 dynes, and 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm². So 1 N/m² = 10^5 dynes / 1e4 cm² = 10 dynes/cm². So yeah, 1 Pa = 10 dynes/cm². So 1 atm is 101325 Pa. Multiply by 10 to get dynes/cm²: 101325 *10 = 1,013,250 dynes/cm².

So P = 1.01325e6 dynes/cm².

Density ρ is 6.09 g/cm³.

Gravity g is 980 cm/s².

So h = P/(ρg) = (1.01325e6) / (6.09 * 980) cm.

Let me compute the denominator first. 6.09 multiplied by 980. Let's see, 6 *980 is 5880, and 0.09 *980 is 88.2, so total 5880 +88.2 = 5968.2.

So h = 1,013,250 / 5968.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Well, 5968.2 is about 6,000. 1,013,250 /6,000 = approx 168.875 cm, which is 1688 mm. Hmm.

But wait, more accurately, let's compute 1,013,250 ÷ 5968.2.

5968.2 * 169 = let's see, 5968 * 170 = 5968*100=596800, 5968*70=417,760 → total 1,014,560. But wait, 5968.2 * 169 is 5968.2*(170-1) = 1,014,560 - 5968.2 ≈ 1,014,560 - 5,968.2 = 1,008,591.8. Which is less than 1,013,250.

So 169 gives us approx 1,008,591.8, which is 4,658.2 less than 1,013,250.

So 4,658.2 /5968.2 ≈ 0.78, so the total is approximately 169.78 cm, which is 1697.8 mm.

Looking at the options, option G is 1697 mmGa. That seems to be the right answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Alternative approach: using SI units.

P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

ρ =6.09 g/cm³ = 6090 kg/m³.

g = 9.8 m/s².

h = P/(ρg) → 101325 / (6090 *9.8).

Compute denominator: 6090 *9.8 = let's see. 6000 *9.8=58,800. 90 *9.8=882. So total is 58,800 + 882 = 59,682.

So h =101325 / 59,682 ≈ 1.697 m → 169.7 cm → 1697 mm. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer should be option G: 1697 mmGa. Looking back at the options, option G is 1697 mmGa. So the answer is G.

To determine the height of a gallium column in a barometer at 1 atm pressure, we use the formula for the height of a fluid column:

\[
h = \frac{P}{\rho g}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure (1 atm),
- \( \rho \) is the density of gallium (\( 6.09 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \)),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( 980 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \)).

### Step 1: Convert pressure to dynes/cm²
1 atm is equivalent to \( 1.01325 \times 10^6 \, \text{dynes/cm}^2 \).

### Step 2: Plug in the values
\[
h = \frac{1.01325 \times 10^6}{6.09 \times 980}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:
\[
6.09 \times 980 = 5968.2
\]

Now, divide:
\[
h = \frac{1.01325 \times 10^6}{5968.2} \approx 1697.8 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 1697.8 \, \text{mmGa} \) is **G: 1697 mmGa**.

Thus, the height of the gallium column is **1697 mmGa**.
