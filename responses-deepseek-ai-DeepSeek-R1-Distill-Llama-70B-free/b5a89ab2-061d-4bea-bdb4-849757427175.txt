Okay, I'm trying to solve this Dumas bulb problem. Hmm, let's see. So the Dumas bulb is filled with chlorine gas. Initially, it's at ambient pressure, and it contains 7.1 grams of chlorine at temperature T Kelvin. Then, the bulb is placed in a bath that's 30 degrees Celsius hotter. After opening the stopcock, the pressure returns to the original value, but now the bulb contains 6.4 grams of chlorine. I need to find the original temperature and the ambient pressure. The options are given, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

Wait, first, I remember that the Dumas bulb is a type of gas burette used to measure gas volumes. But in this case, the volume of the bulb is given as 2.24 liters. So the volume remains constant because it's the same bulb, right?

Okay, so initially, the bulb is at temperature T and pressure P, and after heating, it's at T + 30°C. Oh wait, 30°C is 303.15 K, but since it's a change, maybe I should convert the temperature difference correctly. Wait, no, the bulb is placed in a bath that's 30°C hotter than the first. So the second temperature is T + 30°C. But wait, the initial temperature is T Kelvin. So I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, no. Wait, 30°C hotter than the first one. So if the first is T Kelvin, the second is (T + 30) Celsius? Or do I need to convert T to Celsius and then add 30? No, wait, when the problem says the second bath is 30°C hotter, it's in Celsius. So the second temperature is (T_Celsius +30)°C, but I need to convert that to Kelvin for gas laws.

Wait, let's clarify. Let's say the initial temperature is T K. Then, the second temperature is (T - 273 +30) + 273 = T +30 K. Oh, right, because adding 30°C is the same as adding 30 K. So the second temperature is T +30 K. Okay, that makes it easier.

So the two states are:

State 1: Volume V = 2.24 L, Temp T1 = T K, Pressure P1 = P (ambient), mass of Cl2 = 7.1 g.

State 2: Volume V = 2.24 L (same bulb), Temp T2 = T +30 K, Pressure P2 = P (same as original, because after opening the stopcock, the pressure returns to original). Mass of Cl2 is 6.4 g.

Wait, but how does that work? Because when you heat the bulb, the pressure would increase, but opening the stopcock allows gas to escape, bringing the pressure back to ambient. So the amount of gas decreases, which matches the decrease in mass from 7.1g to 6.4g.

So the process is, the bulb is sealed, heated, then opened to let gas escape until pressure is back to P. So the moles of gas after heating and expansion are such that when the pressure is released to P, only 6.4g remains.

Wait, but how to model this. Since the bulb's volume doesn't change, but the amount of gas does. So let me think about the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

In the first case, n1 = moles of Cl2 initially. In the second case, n2 = moles after expansion and opening.

Wait, but when the bulb is heated, the temperature increases, which would increase the pressure if the volume and moles are the same. But then the stopcock is opened, allowing gas to escape until the pressure returns to P. So the final state is n2, T2, V, P.

So the initial state (state 1): P, V, T K, n1.

After heating to T+30 K, but before opening, the pressure would be higher, but then upon opening, some gas is released, so that at T+30 K, the pressure returns to P, but with a lower n2.

So the process is:

1. Initial: n1 at P, T, V.

2. Heat to T+30, volume same, so pressure would rise. Then, open stopcock to let gas escape until pressure is P again. So the final state is n2 at P, T+30, V.

Wait, but n2 is less than n1 because gas has escaped.

So using the ideal gas law for both states.

For state 1: PV = n1 R T.

For state 2: PV = n2 R (T+30).

But since the pressure is the same P in both, we can set them equal:

n1 R T = n2 R (T +30) => n1 T = n2 (T +30).

So, n2 = n1 * T / (T +30).

But n1 and n2 can be calculated from the masses of Cl2.

Cl2 has a molar mass of 35.5 * 2 =71 g/mol.

So n1 = 7.1 g / 71 g/mol = 0.1 mol.

n2 = 6.4 g /71 g/mol ≈ 0.09014 mol.

So substituting into n2 = n1 * T/(T+30):

0.09014 ≈ 0.1 * T/(T+30)

Let me calculate that.

0.09014 = 0.1 * T/(T+30)

Multiply both sides by (T+30):

0.09014*(T +30) = 0.1 T

0.09014 T + 0.09014*30 = 0.1 T

0.09014 T + 2.7042 = 0.1 T

Bring terms together:

2.7042 = 0.1 T - 0.09014 T

0.1 -0.09014 = 0.00986

So 2.7042 = 0.00986 T

T = 2.7042 / 0.00986 ≈ Let me compute that.

Dividing 2.7042 by 0.00986.

Hmm, 0.00986 is approximately 0.01, so 2.7042 / 0.00986 ≈ about 274 K.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

2.7042 / 0.00986 = Let's see.

0.00986 times 274 is approximately 0.00986 * 270 = approx 2.6622, and 0.00986*4=0.03944 → total 2.70164. Which is close to 2.7042. So T is approximately 274 K.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it precisely.

Let me write 2.7042 / 0.00986.

Let me compute 2.7042 / 0.00986.

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.0001 to make it easier:

2.7042 / 0.00986 = (27042) / (98.6) → wait, no, that's not correct. Because 2.7042 is 2.7042, 0.00986 is 0.00986.

Alternatively, compute 2.7042 ÷ 0.00986.

Let me use a calculator approach:

Compute 2.7042 ÷ 0.00986.

Well, 0.00986 is approximately 9.86e-3.

So 2.7042 / 0.00986 = (2.7042) / (9.86e-3) ) = (2.7042) / (9.86) ) * 1e3.

2.7042 /9.86 ≈ 0.2743, then multiply by 1e3 → 274.3 K.

So T ≈ 274.3 K.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are A-J. Let's check for T around 274 K.

Looking at the options:

Option G is 275K, 1.04atm.

Option E is 270K, 0.99atm.

Option F is 290K, 0.97atm.

Option J is 280K, 1.00atm.

Wait, my calculation is about 274 K, but that's not an option. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute.

n2 = (6.4 g) /71 g/mol = 6.4/71 = approximately 0.09014 mol.

n1 =7.1/71=0.1 mol.

So n2 =n1*T/(T+30)

0.09014 = 0.1*T/(T+30)

Multiply both sides by (T+30):

0.09014*(T+30) =0.1 T

0.09014 T + 0.09014*30 = 0.1 T

0.09014 T + 2.7042 =0.1 T

2.7042 =0.1 T -0.09014 T → 2.7042 =0.00986 T.

So T=2.7042/0.00986.

Hmm, 0.00986 is 9.86e-3.

So 2.7042 / 0.00986 = let me compute as 2.7042 / 0.00986.

Let me compute 2.7042 ÷ 0.00986.

Well, 0.00986 × 274 = 0.00986 * 274.

Compute 0.00986 * 200 =1.972.

0.00986 *74= approx 0.00986*70=0.6902; 0.00986*4=0.03944 → total 0.72964.

So 1.972 +0.72964=2.70164.

Which is very close to 2.7042.

So 274 K gives 2.70164, which is just a bit less than 2.7042. So maybe 274.3 K.

So T≈274.3 K.

Looking at the options, the closest is 275K, which is option G. But let's look at what each option says.

Option G is 275K, ambient pressure 1.04 atm.

Option I is 265K, 1.00 atm.

Hmm, but 274 is close to 275, but not exactly. So perhaps I should check whether the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial pressure is P, and after heating and releasing, the pressure returns to P. So in the first case, n1 is at T, P, V. After heating, when the pressure returns to P, the moles are n2 at T+30, P, V.

So the ideal gas law gives PV =nRT.

So for the first case: n1 = PV/(RT).

Second case: n2 = PV/(R(T+30)).

Thus, n2 =n1 * T/(T+30).

Which is what I did.

So the setup seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the moles again.

n1 =7.1g /71g/mol=0.1 mol.

n2=6.4/71= approximately 0.09014 mol.

So plugging into n2 =n1*T/(T+30).

0.09014=0.1*T/(T+30).

Multiply both sides by (T+30):

0.09014 (T +30) =0.1 T.

0.09014 T + 2.7042 =0.1 T.

So 2.7042 = 0.00986 T.

T=2.7042/0.00986=approx 274.3 K.

So about 274.3 K. Now, looking at the options, the closest is option G:275K, 1.04 atm. But let's see what the ambient pressure would be.

Wait, the question also asks for the ambient pressure, so perhaps we can compute that to see which option fits.

So, let's compute the ambient pressure P.

From the ideal gas law, PV =nRT.

In state 1: P * V =n1 * R * T.

We have V=2.24 L.

n1=0.1 mol.

T=274.3 K.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So P = (n R T)/V.

Plugging in the numbers:

P = (0.1 * 0.0821 * 274.3) / 2.24.

Compute numerator: 0.1 *0.0821=0.00821. 0.00821 *274.3 ≈ Let's compute 0.00821 *274.3.

0.00821 *200=1.642.

0.00821 *74.3= approx 0.00821 *70=0.5747; 0.00821*4.3= approx 0.0353.

So 0.5747 + 0.0353=0.610 → total 1.642 +0.610=2.252.

So numerator ≈2.252.

Denominator:2.24 L.

So P≈2.252 /2.24 ≈1.004 atm.

So P≈1.004 atm.

Looking back at the options, which have P around 1 atm.

Option I is 265K, 1.00 atm.

Option J is 280K, 1.00 atm.

But our calculated T is about 274.3 K, which is not exactly any of the options. Hmm. The closest is option G with T=275K, P=1.04 atm. But my calculation for P was 1.004 atm. Hmm, that's a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of P. Let me recompute.

P = (0.1 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (274.3 K) / (2.24 L).

Compute numerator: 0.1 *0.0821=0.00821.

0.00821 *274.3 → Let's calculate more accurately.

274.3 *0.00821.

Break it down:

274 * 0.00821 = ?

Well, 200 *0.00821=1.642.

70 *0.00821=0.5747.

4 *0.00821=0.03284.

So 1.642 +0.5747=2.2167 → +0.03284=2.24954.

Then, 0.3 *0.00821=0.002463.

So total is 2.24954 + 0.002463=2.252003.

So numerator is approx 2.252.

Divide by 2.24 L: 2.252 /2.24 ≈approx 1.0045 atm.

So about 1.0045 atm.

Looking at the options, option I is 265K, 1.00 atm.

Option J:280K,1.00 atm.

Option D:300 K,1.01 atm.

Option G:275K,1.04 atm.

Hmm, our calculated P is about 1.004 atm, which is very close to 1.00 atm. So perhaps the correct option is one where P is near 1.00 atm, and T is near 274 K.

Looking at the options, the closest T to 274 is 275 (option G) and 270 (option E), but 274 would be between 270 and 275.

But let me look at the options again.

Option E:270K, 0.99 atm.

Option G:275K,1.04 atm.

But our P is about 1.00, so maybe the correct option is not G.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the pressure after heating and expansion is adjusted by releasing gas, but perhaps I should think of the initial and final pressures as the same. But that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the initial and final pressures as P, and the change in moles due to temperature change.

Wait, another approach: The initial moles are n1, and after expansion, the moles are n2. Since the pressure returns to P, the ratio n1/n2 = (T+30)/T.

Because from PV=nRT, at constant P and V, n1/n2 = T/(T+30).

Wait, no, because n1 is at T, n2 is at T+30. So n1 = (P V)/(R T), n2= (P V)/(R(T+30)).

So n1/n2 = (T+30)/T → n2 =n1 * T/(T+30), which is what I did earlier.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, but when I calculated T, I got approximately 274 K, but none of the options exactly match. The closest is option G (275K, 1.04 atm), but the P I calculated was about 1.00 atm, not 1.04.

Hmm, perhaps I should try plugging in some of the options to see which fits.

Let's take option G: T=275K, P=1.04 atm.

Compute n1 = (P V) / (R T) → (1.04 atm * 2.24 L) / (0.0821 *275).

Calculate denominator: 0.0821 *275 ≈22.5775.

Numerator:1.04 *2.24≈2.3296.

So n1=2.3296 /22.5775≈0.1032 mol.

But n1 should be 7.1g /71g/mol=0.1 mol.

Hmm, 0.1032 is higher than 0.1. So option G would give n1=0.1032, which is more than the given 0.1. So that's not matching.

What about option I: T=265K, P=1.00 atm.

n1=(1.00 *2.24)/(0.0821 *265) → numerator=2.24, denominator≈21.74.

So n1≈2.24 /21.74≈0.1031 mol again, which is higher than 0.1. Hmm, same as option G.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating n1. Because in the first case, n1 is 0.1 mol. So let's see.

If option I is T=265K, P=1.00 atm.

n1=PV/(RT)=(1.00)(2.24)/(0.
