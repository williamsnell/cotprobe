Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this kind of thing, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A vessel with a volume of 22.4 dm³ contains 2.0 moles of H₂ and 1.0 mole of N₂ at a temperature of 273.15 K. I need to calculate their total pressure and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when dealing with gases, the ideal gas law is probably going to be useful here. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. The vessel contains two different gases, H₂ and N₂. But I think that because they're both ideal gases and they don't react with each other, their partial pressures just add up. Oh right, that's Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. So the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas.

So I should calculate the pressure from H₂ and the pressure from N₂ separately and then add them together.

Let's start by figuring out the partial pressure of H₂. The number of moles for H₂ is 2.0 mol. The volume is 22.4 dm³, which I think is the same as 22.4 liters because 1 dm³ equals 1 liter. Oh wait, wait, no, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, but 1 dm is 0.1 meters, so 1 dm³ is (0.1 m)^3 = 0.001 m³, which is 1 liter. So yeah, 22.4 dm³ is 22.4 liters.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the units for the gas constant R. Because R can be expressed in different units depending on pressure. Common values are 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) and 8.314 J/(mol·K), where 1 J is 1 Pa·m³, but maybe using L and atm would be easier here since the options are in atm.

So R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right?

The temperature given is 273.15 K. That's 0 degrees Celsius, so it's a standard temperature, which might relate to standard pressure, but we're not at standard pressure here since the moles and volume are different.

So for H₂, using PV = nRT:

P_H2 = (n_H2 * R * T) / V

Plugging in the numbers: n_H2 is 2.0 mol, R is 0.0821, T is 273.15 K, and V is 22.4 L.

So P_H2 = (2.0 * 0.0821 * 273.15) / 22.4

Let me compute that. Let me compute numerator first: 2 * 0.0821 is 0.1642. Multiply by 273.15. Let me calculate 0.1642 * 273.15.

Wait, 0.1642 * 273 is approximately 44.8 (since 0.1642 * 200 = 32.84, 0.1642 *73 = approx 12, total around 44.84). Then 0.1642 * 0.15 is about 0.0246, so total numerator is approx 44.8 + 0.0246 = 44.8246.

Then divide by 22.4 L: 44.8246 / 22.4 ≈ 2.0 atm? Because 22.4 times 2 is 44.8, so yeah, that's about 2.0 atm for H₂.

Wait wait, let me double-check that calculation.

2.0 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) = 0.1642 L·atm/K
Multiply by T (273.15 K) → 0.1642 * 273.15 ≈ let me compute it more accurately.

0.1642 * 273 = let's see:

0.1642 * 200 = 32.84
0.1642 * 73 = let's compute 0.1642 *70=11.494, 0.1642*3=0.4926 → total 11.9866
So 32.84 + 11.9866 = 44.8266
Then 0.1642 * 0.15 = 0.02463
So total numerator is 44.8266 + 0.02463 = 44.8512

Divide by 22.4 L: 44.8512 / 22.4 → let's do this division.

22.4 * 2 = 44.8, which is just a bit less than 44.8512. So 2.0 approximately, but a tiny bit more. Maybe around 2.002 atm.

So P_H2 ≈ 2.0 atm.

Now for N₂, n is 1.0 mol. So P_N2 = (1.0 * 0.0821 * 273.15) / 22.4.

Compute numerator: 1 * 0.0821 = 0.0821. Multiply by 273.15: 0.0821 * 273.15.

Let me compute that: 0.0821 * 273 = 22.4113, and 0.0821 *0.15=0.012315. So total is 22.4113 + 0.012315 ≈ 22.4236.

Divide by 22.4 L → 22.4236 /22.4 ≈ 1.0 atm.

Wait exactly, because 22.4 *1 =22.4, and the numerator is 22.4236, which is just a bit less than 22.4. So maybe approximately 0.999 atm, which is about 1.0 atm.

So P_N2 is approximately 1.0 atm.

So the total pressure P_total = P_H2 + P_N2 = 2.0 + 1.0 = 3.0 atm.

Looking at the options, option G is 3.0 atm. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me recheck the calculation. Because I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, the volume is 22.4 dm³. Oh wait! 1 dm³ is 1 liter, so 22.4 dm³ is 22.4 liters. So that's correct.

Another way to think about it: At standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 273.15 K and 1 atm, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So in this problem, the vessel is 22.4 dm³, which is 22.4 L.

So, for each gas, the moles times the volume over 22.4 L gives the pressure contribution.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since at STP, n=1 gives P=1 atm in V=22.4 L.

So for H₂, n=2.0, so P would be 2 * (1 atm) = 2 atm.

Similarly, N₂, n=1, so P=1 atm.

So total P=3 atm.

Yep, that's a quicker way. So the answer is G: 3.0 atm.

To calculate the total pressure exerted by the gases in the vessel, we use the ideal gas law and Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. The ideal gas law is given by:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

where \(P\) is pressure, \(V\) is volume, \(n\) is the number of moles, \(R\) is the gas constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since the vessel contains two gases, \(H_2\) and \(N_2\), their partial pressures will add up to give the total pressure:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{H_2} + P_{N_2}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the partial pressure of \(H_2\)
For \(H_2\), the number of moles is \(n_{H_2} = 2.0 \, \text{mol}\), the temperature is \(T = 273.15 \, \text{K}\), and the volume is \(V = 22.4 \, \text{dm}^3 = 22.4 \, \text{L}\). Using \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\):

\[
P_{H_2} = \frac{n_{H_2} R T}{V}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_{H_2} = \frac{(2.0)(0.0821)(273.15)}{22.4}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(2.0)(0.0821)(273.15) = 44.8512
\]

Now divide by the volume:

\[
P_{H_2} = \frac{44.8512}{22.4} \approx 2.0 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the partial pressure of \(N_2\)
For \(N_2\), the number of moles is \(n_{N_2} = 1.0 \, \text{mol}\). Using the same values for \(R\), \(T\), and \(V\):

\[
P_{N_2} = \frac{n_{N_2} R T}{V}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_{N_2} = \frac{(1.0)(0.0821)(273.15)}{22.4}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.0)(0.0821)(273.15) = 22.4236
\]

Now divide by the volume:

\[
P_{N_2} = \frac{22.4236}{22.4} \approx 1.0 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total pressure
The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{H_2} + P_{N_2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = 2.0 \, \text{atm} + 1.0 \, \text{atm} = 3.0 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total pressure exerted by the gases in the vessel is **3.0 atm**.
