Okay, so I've got this question about cystic fibrosis and the most common mutation that causes it. Hmm, I remember that cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder, and it's caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. But wait, what's the specific mutation?

I think the most common mutation is something called F508del. Oh right, F508 stands for phenylalanine at position 508, and del means deletion. So that's a deletion of three nucleotides which removes that amino acid. 

Wait, so what type of mutation is that? Deletion of three nucleotides would mean that the reading frame isn't shifted because three is a multiple of three, so it's an in-frame deletion. So that leads to a protein that's missing an amino acid but doesn't change the rest of the reading frame. That's different from a frameshift mutation, which happens when the number isn't a multiple of three. 

So in this case, the mutation is a deletion. Looking at the options, option C is a deletion. But wait, let me make sure. Another possibility is that it's a missense mutation because you're replacing one amino acid with another, but wait, in this case, it's a deletion of an amino acid, so not a substitution. 

Wait, wait. F508del removes the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508. So that's a deletion of one amino acid. So the DNA mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides (since each amino acid is coded by three nucleotides). So the type of mutation is a deletion. 

Looking at the options, the question is asking for the most common mutation. So option C is a deletion, which matches F508del.

But wait, another thought. I remember that sometimes the term 'nonsense mutation' comes in. Nonsense is when a premature stop codon is introduced, leading to a truncated protein. That's not the case here. 

Similarly, a substitution would be a point mutation where a single nucleotide is changed, leading to an amino acid change, as in a missense or nonsense mutation. But F508del is a deletion, not a substitution. 

So the correct answer should be C: a deletion.

The most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis is F508del, which involves the deletion of three nucleotides in the CFTR gene. This results in the removal of the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508. Since the deletion is in multiples of three, it does not cause a frameshift but rather an in-frame deletion, leading to a protein missing one amino acid. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

C: a deletion.

Answer: C
