Question:

A property owner owned a large building in the city. The owner leased the building to a shopkeeper for a period of 20 years at a rental of $10,000 per month. The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted "to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. " One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide "by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. "One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The non-profit organization has a B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. Which of the following is not correct regarding the legal relationship(s) of the various parties?

Options:

A: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper.
B: Privily of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation.
C: Privily of estate, but not privily of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation.
D: Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this property law question about lease agreements and privity. Hmm, I remember that privity of estate refers to the legal relationship between parties regarding the land, while privity of contract is about their contractual obligations. Let me break this down step by step.

The scenario involves a property owner who leased a building to a shopkeeper for 20 years. The lease says the shopkeeper can't assign it except to a corporation with an 'A' credit rating. Then, the shopkeeper subleases to a corporation without the required rating for five years. That corporation then subleases to a non-profit with a 'B' rating.

So, the question is about which statement is incorrect regarding the legal relationships.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Privity of estate and contract exist between owner and shopkeeper. That makes sense because the owner directly leased to the shopkeeper, so both privity types should be present.

Option B: Shopkeeper and corporation have both privity. Well, the shopkeeper subleased to the corporation, so they should have privity of estate as they have a landlord-tenant relationship. But what about privity of contract? The original lease between owner and shopkeeper restricts assignments. The shopkeeper assigned to a corporation that doesn't meet the credit requirement. Wait, does that mean the assignment is prohibited? If the lease prohibits assignment except to 'A' rated corps, then the shopkeeper's lease to a non-'A' corp might be a breach. But does that affect the privity between shopkeeper and corporation? I think privity of contract exists because they have a lease agreement, regardless of whether it's prohibited. So B says both exist, which might be correct.

Option C: Property owner and corporation have privity of estate but not contract. Wait, privity of estate usually requires a direct lease. The owner didn't lease to the corporation; the shopkeeper did. So the owner and corporation don't have a direct lease, meaning no privity of estate. So C is incorrect because it says privity of estate exists. That would make C a wrong statement, so it's the incorrect option. But wait, I need to think again. The corporation agreed to abide by all terms of the original lease. Does that create privity of contract with the owner? Probably not, because the corporation isn't a party to the original lease. So between owner and corporation, there's no privity of contract, and no privity of estate because the lease is from the shopkeeper. So C says privity of estate exists, which is wrong. So C is an incorrect statement.

Option D: No privity between owner and non-profit. That makes sense because the non-profit is a subtenant of the corporation, which is a subtenant of the shopkeeper. So the owner doesn't have direct contractual or estate relationship with the non-profit. So D is correct.

So the question is which option is NOT correct. So looking back, the incorrect statement is either B or C.

Wait, the shopkeeper assigned the lease to the corporation without permission, violating the lease terms. So the assignment might be invalid, but does that affect the privity between shopkeeper and corporation? Or does it just make the assignment a breach, but the sublease is still valid between them. So between shopkeeper and corporation, they have a lease agreement, so privity of contract exists. As for privity of estate, since the corporation is in possession, they have that as well. So B is correct.

So the incorrect option is C because it claims there's privity of estate between owner and corporation, which there isn't. So the answer should be C.

The question revolves around the legal relationships between various parties in a series of lease agreements, focusing on the concepts of privity of estate (a legal relationship regarding the land) and privity of contract (a contractual relationship). Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper. This is correct because the property owner directly leased the building to the shopkeeper, creating both types of privity.

- **Option B**: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation. This is also correct. The shopkeeper subleased the premises to the corporation, creating privity of estate (as the corporation is in possession) and privity of contract (as they have a lease agreement).

- **Option C**: Privity of estate, but not privity of contract, exists between the property owner and the corporation. This is incorrect. The property owner did not directly lease the premises to the corporation, so there is no privity of estate. Additionally, the corporation is not a party to the original lease, so there is no privity of contract either.

- **Option D**: Neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization. This is correct. The nonprofit organization is a subtenant of the corporation, and there is no direct legal relationship with the property owner.

The incorrect statement is **Option C**, as it erroneously claims that privity of estate exists between the property owner and the corporation, which is not the case.

**Answer: C**
