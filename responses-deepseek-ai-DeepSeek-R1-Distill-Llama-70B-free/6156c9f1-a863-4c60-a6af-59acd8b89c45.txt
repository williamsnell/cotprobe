Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Protocol 14 and its effects on the European Court of Human Rights. I'm a bit rusty on my international law, but I'll try to think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which statement is false. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council. Wait, I remember that the Human Rights Council is part of the United Nations, right? Like, it's in Geneva and replaced the Commission on Human Rights in 2006. But Protocol 14 is about the European Court of Human Rights, which is under the Council of Europe, not the UN. So maybe A is false because Protocol 14 didn't create the UN's HRC. That's a possibility.

Option B: Protocol 14 mandated a two-judge formation for hearing admissibility cases. From what I recall, Protocol 14 introduced changes to streamline the process. I think it allowed for a single judge to handle some admissibility decisions, especially in straightforward cases. So maybe this is incorrect because it says two judges, but I thought it was one. Or perhaps it was a chamber? Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: Protocol 14 reduced the jurisdiction of the ECtHR. I think Protocol 14 was more about efficiency and reducing backlog. It didn't reduce jurisdiction but rather made the Court's procedures more effective. So C might be false, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Shortened the judicial term of office. I believe the term was actually extended. Judges used to have terms of 6 or 9 years, and I think Protocol 14 made it a single non-renewable term of 9 years or something like that. So D says it shortened, so that would be false if I'm right. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Did it extend the term or not? I'll need to think more.

Option E: Introduced a requirement for unanimous decisions in admissibility cases. No, I don't think so. In fact, I think admissibility decisions can be made by a single judge now, so E is probably false because it's not about unanimous decisions.

Option F: Added a new admissibility criterion. I think Protocol 14 did introduce a new admissibility criterion related to the 'significant disadvantage' for the applicant, making it harder for some cases to be admissible. So F is true.

Option G: Eliminated the right to individual petition. No, the right to individual petition is a cornerstone. Protocol 14 didn't remove that. So G is false. Wait, but I thought G is false, but I also thought A was false. So I might be getting confused here.

Option H: Changed the committee from three judges to one. Yes, I think that's correct. Before, maybe a committee of three judges handled some cases, but now a single judge can. So H is true.

Option I: Extended the judicial term. If D says it shortened and I is the opposite, then one must be false. I think I is correct because the term was extended to 9 years, so D would be false.

Option J: Abolished the Commission of Human Rights. Wait, the European Commission of Human Rights was abolished by Protocol 11, which established the current Court as a permanent body. Protocol 14 came later, so J is false because the Commission was already abolished earlier.

Wait, now I'm getting more confused. Let me try to piece this together.

Protocol 14 was adopted in 2010 and came into force in 2012. Its main aim was to reform the Court to handle the increasing workload. Key changes included:

- Allowing a single judge to reject applications where the case is inadmissible or where the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage.
- Requiring that the Court's decisions be taken by a committee of three judges in some cases, but previously it was maybe more judges.
- Protocol 14 also introduced the possibility of the Court hearing cases without a hearing, which could speed things up.

Regarding the Commission, yes, Protocol 11 in 1998 abolished the Commission and the old Court, creating a new permanent Court. So J says Protocol 14 abolished the Commission, which would be incorrect because that was done by Protocol 11. So J is false.

Now, looking back at the options:

A: Established the Human Rights Council. That's the UN body, so A is false because Protocol 14 relates to the European system.

G: Eliminated individual petition. No, individual petitions are still allowed, so G is false.

Wait, so which options are correct or incorrect? The question is which statement is false.

Let me go through each option again.

A: False, because the HRC is a UN body, not Council of Europe. So Protocol 14 didn't establish it.

B: Mandated two-judge formation. I think it's single-judge, so B is false.

C: Reduced jurisdiction. I don't think so; it's more about procedure, so C might be false.

D: Shortened term. I think it extended terms to 9 years, so D is false.

E: Unanimous decisions. No, so E is false.

F: Added new admissibility criterion. True.

G: Eliminated individual petition. False.

H: Changed to one-judge. True.

I: Extended term. True.

J: Abolished Commission. False.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is false, and the options are A-J.

So looking for the false statement.

Option G: "Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition." That's definitely false because individual petition (the right for individuals to bring cases) is still a key part of the system. So G is false.

Option J: "Abolished the Commission of Human Rights." The Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, so J is false.

So now I have multiple options that are false (A, B, C, D, E, G, J). But the question says which one is false, so perhaps only one is correct as the false statement, and the others are true.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are from A to J, and only one is false.

Wait, the question is which statement is false. So I need to find the incorrect statement about Protocol 14.

Let me list each option and assess:

A: Established the Human Rights Council. No, that's UN's HRC, so A is false.

B: Two-judge for admissibility. I think it's single-judge now, so B is false.

C: Reduced jurisdiction. No, it didn't reduce, so C is false.

D: Shortened judicial term. No, extended to 9 years, so D is false.

E: Unanimous decision in admissibility. No, so E is false.

F: Added new criterion. Yes, so F is true.

G: Eliminated individual petition. No, so G is false.

H: Changed to one-judge. Yes, so H is true.

I: Extended term. Yes, so I is true.

J: Abolished Commission. No, that was Protocol 11, so J is false.

So multiple options are false. But the question is which is false, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each point again.

Protocol 14's main changes:

- Abolished the right to individual petition? No, that's still there. So G is false.

- It allowed a single judge to decide on admissibility in certain cases, so H is correct (changed from 3 to 1). So B, which says two-judge, is incorrect. So B is false.

- The Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, so J is false.

- It didn't establish the UN HRC, so A is false.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false, so perhaps one of these is the correct answer, but I need to find which is the false one.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is G, because it's a significant point.

Alternatively, perhaps option J is false because it says the Commission was abolished by Protocol 14, which is incorrect. So J is false.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option's veracity.

Option A: False, since HRC is UN, not CoE.

Option B: False, because it's single-judge now, not two.

Option C: False, because jurisdiction wasn't reduced.

Option D: False, because term was extended.

Option E: False, no requirement for unanimous decisions.

Option G: False, individual petition still exists.

Option J: False, Commission was abolished earlier.

But the question is which one is false, so perhaps the answer is G or J.

Wait, perhaps the question is which is false, and among the options, G says the right to individual petition was eliminated. That's a big deal, and I'm pretty sure it's still in place. So G is false.

Alternatively, J is false because the Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, not 14.

So which one is the false statement? The question is about Protocol 14.

Looking back, the correct answer is G: Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition. That's false. Because the right remains.

Wait, but wait: did Protocol 14 affect individual petition? I think the right is maintained. So G is false.

But I've also thought that J is false because Protocol 14 didn't abolish the Commission. So which one is the correct answer to the question.

Wait the options are:

Which statement is false.

Looking at each option again:

Option G: Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition.

That's definitely false because the right to individual petition is still there. So G is false.

But wait, I thought that the right to individual petition was kept, so G is false.

Alternatively, perhaps option J is the false statement because it says Protocol 14 abolished the Commission, which it didn't; that was done by Protocol 11.

So now I'm confused between G and J.

Another approach: think about each option.

The question is which one is false.

Looking at each option:

A: Established HRC (UN body) → False.

B: Two-judge → False (it's single).

C: Reduced jurisdiction → False.

D: Shortened term → False (extended).

E: Unanimous → False.

F: Added criterion → True.

G: Eliminated petition → False.

H: Changed to one-judge → True.

I: Extended term → True.

J: Abolished Commission → False.

So multiple false statements, but the question is to pick one.

Wait, the question is about which statement is false, so perhaps the correct answer is G.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the exact content of Protocol 14.

Protocol 14 made several changes to the European Convention on Human Rights:

1. It allowed the Court to declare an application inadmissible in a single-judge formation (so Option H is correct, which says it changed from 3-judge to 1-judge).

2. It introduced a new admissibility criterion where the applicant must have suffered a significant disadvantage (so F is correct).

3. Judges' terms were extended from 6 to 9 years, and made non-renewable (so I is correct; D is false).

4. The Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, so J is false.

5. The right to individual petition remains, so G is false.

So which options are false? Let's see the question again.

The options are A to J.

The question is which is false.

The correct answer would be G: Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition → That's false.

But also, J is false because it says Protocol 14 abolished the Commission, which it didn't.

Wait, but looking at the provided options, the possible correct answer is G.

Alternatively, option J is false because the Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, not 14.

So the question is which statement is false. So both G and J are false statements. But the options only allow one answer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the exact content of Protocol 14.

Upon checking, Protocol 14 did not eliminate the right to individual petition. So G is false.

Protocol 14 also did not abolish the Commission; that was done by Protocol 11. So J is false.

So both G and J are false statements. But the question asks which is false, implying only one is.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Another possibility is that option D is false. Because judges' terms were extended, not shortened. So D says shortened, which is false.

I think I might have to choose between these options, but the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct answer is probably G, because eliminating individual petition is a big change, and I know that didn't happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J, because the Commission was abolished before Protocol 14.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is false. So each option is a statement, and only one is false.

Another approach is to look for which options are correct.

Option F: Added new admissibility criterion → True.

Option H: Changed to one-judge → True.

Option I: Extended term → True.

So the false options are A, B, C, D, E, G, J.

But the question asks which is false, so perhaps the answer is G.

Wait, but I also thought J is false. So perhaps I need to pick the most obviously false statement.

The right to individual petition is a key aspect, so if someone says Protocol 14 eliminated it, that's a big lie, making G false.

Similarly, saying Protocol 14 abolished the Commission is false, as that was done earlier.

So which is the correct answer to the question?

The question is which statement is false.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is G: Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J, but I'm more certain that G is false.

Wait, another angle: the question gives options A to J, and only one is false.

Looking back at the options:

The question asks which statement is false.

So I'll have to pick the statement that is incorrect about Protocol 14.

Another key point of Protocol 14 is that it introduced the possibility for the Court to strike applications without further examination if certain conditions are met, but it didn't eliminate individual petition.

So G is definitely false.

Similarly, J is false because the Commission was abolished earlier.

So perhaps the answer is G.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of other points.

Option C: Reduced jurisdiction. No, I think the jurisdiction remained the same; it's about procedural changes. So C is false.

Option B: Two-judge for admissibility. I think it's single-judge, so B is false.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct answer is G or J.

But I'm more confident that G is false because the right to individual petition still exists.

So I'll go with G as the false statement.
</think>

To determine which statement is false, each option is analyzed in relation to Protocol 14's actual provisions:

- **Option A**: False. Protocol 14 did not establish the Human Rights Council, as the HRC is a UN body, not related to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

- **Option B**: False. Protocol 14 introduced single-judge formations for certain admissibility cases, not a two-judge formation.

- **Option C**: False. Protocol 14 did not reduce the jurisdiction of the ECtHR; it focused on procedural efficiency.

- **Option D**: False. Protocol 14 extended judicial terms to 9 years, rather than shortening them.

- **Option E**: False. Protocol 14 did not introduce a requirement for unanimous decision-making in admissibility cases.

- **Option F**: True. Protocol 14 introduced a new admissibility criterion related to "significant disadvantage."

- **Option G**: False. Protocol 14 did not eliminate the right to individual petition; this right remains intact.

- **Option H**: True. Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge to a one-judge formation.

- **Option I**: True. Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the ECtHR to 9 years.

- **Option J**: False. The European Commission of Human Rights was abolished by Protocol 11, not Protocol 14.

Among these, **Option G** is particularly notable as it falsely claims that Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition, which is a cornerstone of the European human rights system and remains unchanged. While other options are also false, the elimination of individual petition is a significant and fundamental right, making **Option G** the most clearly false statement.

**Answer: G**
