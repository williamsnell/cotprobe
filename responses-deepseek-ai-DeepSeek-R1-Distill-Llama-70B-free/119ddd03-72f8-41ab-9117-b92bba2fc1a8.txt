Okay, so I've got this problem here about Harrison's Bookstore wanting to insure their inventory. Let me read it again carefully.

The inventory is estimated to be worth $500,000. They want a policy that covers 70% of its value. The insurance company charges $0.50 per $100. The question is asking for the annual premium they'll pay.

Hmm, I think I need to break this down step by step. First, I should determine the amount that the insurance will cover. Since they want 70% coverage, I can calculate 70% of $500,000.

So 70% of 500,000 is... let me calculate that. 500,000 multiplied by 0.70. 500,000 * 0.7 is 350,000. So the insured amount is $350,000.

Next, I need to find out the premium for this coverage. The rate is $0.50 per $100 of insured value. So for each $100, they pay 50 cents.

To find the total premium, I guess I need to divide the insured amount by 100 and then multiply by the rate. So that's 350,000 divided by 100, which is 3,500. Then multiply by 0.50 dollars.

Wait, let me write that out. 350,000 / 100 = 3,500. Then 3,500 * 0.50 = 1,750. So the annual premium would be $1,750.

Looking at the options, option C is $1,750. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

Inventory value: $500k. 70% of that is 350k. Insurance rate is $0.50 per $100. So for 350k, how many $100 units are there? 350k /100 is 3,500. Multiply by 0.50 gives 1,750. Yep, that's correct.

The inventory value is $500,000, and 70% of that is $350,000. The insurance rate is $0.50 per $100. Dividing $350,000 by 100 gives 3,500 units. Multiplying 3,500 by $0.50 results in an annual premium of $1,750.

The correct answer is C: $1,750.
