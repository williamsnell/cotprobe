Alright, so I've got this tax problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the question is about Angela Rodriguez. She's single, not a head of household, and claims one exemption. She earned $9,357 during the year, and $1,397 was withheld as federal tax. She's taking a standard deduction. I need to calculate how much additional tax she must pay using the standard deduction table. The options are from A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that in the US tax system, the standard deduction varies based on filing status. Since Angela is single, her standard deduction should be a certain amount. Wait, I think for 2023, the standard deduction for single filers is $13,850, but I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Or maybe it's lower because she's not the head of household. Wait, the standard deduction for single is indeed lower than head of household. Oh wait, no, the standard deduction is the same whether you're head of household or single in some cases, but wait, no. Let me think again. For 2023, the standard deduction is:

- Single: $13,850
- Married filing jointly: $27,700
- Head of household: $20,800

Wait, but wait, the question says she's single and not head of any household, so she uses the single standard deduction. So her standard deduction is $13,850? But wait, that seems high because her income is only $9,357. If her income is less than the standard deduction, does that mean she doesn't owe any taxes, or does she get a refund?

Wait, but she's claiming one exemption. Wait, the exemption is for herself, right? Because she's single. But wait, in recent tax law, personal exemptions were eliminated, right? Like, from 2018 to 2025, personal exemptions are zero. So maybe she can't claim any exemptions beyond the standard deduction. Hmm, but the question says she claims one exemption, so perhaps this is under the old system? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because in the current system, the standard deduction has been increased, and personal exemptions are not allowed. So if she's claiming one exemption, maybe the problem is using older tax tables, perhaps from before 2018.

Wait, but the problem is about calculating her tax using a standard deduction. So perhaps she's using the standard deduction, and her personal exemption is a separate thing. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, I think the steps to calculate her tax liability would be:

1. Determine her filing status. She's single, so she uses the single tables.

2. Calculate her adjusted gross income (AGI). Since she's taking the standard deduction, her AGI would be her total income minus the standard deduction and minus any exemptions she's eligible for.

Wait no, wait. The standard deduction is a subtraction from AGI to get taxable income. Or is the standard deduction part of the itemized deductions? Wait, no, the standard deduction is used instead of itemizing. So the process is:

Taxable Income = Total Income - Standard Deduction - Exemptions

Wait, but in the current tax system (post-2017), personal exemptions are zero, so maybe that doesn't apply. But the question mentions she claims one exemption, so perhaps the problem is set in a year where exemptions are allowed, like before 2018.

So let's assume that. So her total income is $9,357.

She takes the standard deduction for a single filer. Let's say, for example, in 2017, the standard deduction was $6,350 for single filers. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact figure for the year in question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides a table for standard deductions that I should refer to. But the question says to use the table for standard deductions, but I don't have that table in front of me. So maybe I need to proceed with typical numbers.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction is $6,300 for single filers, as an example. Alternatively, maybe $6,000. Hmm, but without the exact table, it's a bit hard. Alternatively, perhaps I can work with the numbers given.

Wait, she earned $9,357, and $1,397 was withheld as federal tax. She's taking the standard deduction, and she's single, claiming one exemption.

So first, her total income is $9,357.

Subtract standard deduction: Let's say standard deduction for single is $6,350 (as in 2017).

So taxable income would be $9,357 - $6,350 = $3,007.

Then subtract her exemption. One exemption in 2017 was $4,050. Wait, but if her taxable income after standard deduction is $3,007, and she subtracts an exemption of $4,050, that would bring her taxable income to negative $1,043. That can't be right because you can't have negative taxable income in that way. So perhaps she can only subtract the exemption if her income is above a certain level, or maybe I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

Taxable Income = Total Income - Standard Deduction - Exemptions

But if her income after standard deduction is less than the exemption, she can't claim the full exemption. Alternatively, maybe the exemption is a separate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the exemption is considered as part of the standard deduction. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the tax tables. The standard deduction is subtracted from her income to find taxable income. Then, her tax is calculated based on that taxable income, using the tax brackets for her filing status.

Wait, let's try that approach.

Her income: $9,357.

Standard deduction: Let's say for single filers it's $6,300 (I'm just making this up because I don't have the exact number, but perhaps the problem expects me to use a certain figure). So:

Taxable Income = $9,357 - $6,300 = $3,057.

Now, she claims one exemption. Wait, but in the current system, personal exemptions are zero, so maybe this is an older problem. Alternatively, perhaps the exemption is considered after the standard deduction. So:

Her taxable income is $3,057.

Then, she subtracts one exemption. Let's say the exemption is $4,050 (as in 2017). But $3,057 minus $4,050 would be negative, so she can't owe negative taxes. So perhaps her taxable income becomes zero, and she doesn't owe any taxes beyond that.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because she had $1,397 withheld. So perhaps the approach is that she can only subtract the exemption if her income is above the exemption amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the exemption is a separate calculation, like the standard deduction. So, perhaps her taxable income is $9,357 minus standard deduction minus exemption.

So using 2017 numbers:

Standard deduction: $6,350 (single)
Exemption: $4,050 (for herself)

So taxable income: $9,357 - $6,350 - $4,050 = negative $1,043. So her taxable income is zero.

If her taxable income is zero, she doesn't owe any taxes. But she had $1,397 withheld, so she would get a refund of $1,397. But the question is asking how much additional tax she must pay, so if she doesn't owe any, it's zero, which would correspond to option B.

But wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong standard deduction amount. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is lower. Let me try with a standard deduction of $5,700 (I think that was the 2015 amount). So:

$9,357 - $5,700 (standard) = $3,657.

Then subtract one exemption of $3,950 (the 2014 exemption). So $3,657 - $3,950 = negative $293. So taxable income is zero.

Again, she doesn't owe any tax, so she would have overpaid, and no additional tax is due.

But wait, that would mean the answer is B: $0.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is higher, but she still ends up with a taxable income that's zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the 2018 standard deduction, which is higher, but the personal exemption is zero. So in that case:

Standard deduction for single in 2018 was $12,000.

So taxable income: $9,357 - $12,000 = negative $2,643. So taxable income is zero.

She doesn't owe any tax, so again, she had $1,397 withheld, so she gets a refund, but no additional tax due.

Wait, but the problem says she claims one exemption. But in 2018, personal exemptions were eliminated, so she can't claim any. So perhaps the problem is set in a different year where both standard deduction and exemptions apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a standard deduction amount that, when subtracted from her income, leaves some taxable income, and then the exemption reduces that further.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me approach this differently.

Perhaps I should calculate her total tax liability based on her taxable income after standard deduction and exemptions, and then compare it with the amount withheld to find if she owes more or gets a refund.

But without knowing the exact standard deduction and exemption amounts, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the 2023 standard deduction, which is $13,850 for single filers. So:

$9,357 (income) - $13,850 (standard deduction) = negative $4,493. So taxable income is zero.

Thus, her tax liability is zero. Since $1,397 was withheld, she would get a refund, and no additional tax is due. So the answer would be B: $0.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the standard deduction plus exemptions can't exceed a certain amount. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering her filing status and the number of exemptions. If she's single and claims one exemption, perhaps that's her personal exemption, but in recent years, that's zero. So maybe she's not eligible for any exemptions beyond the standard deduction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the 2023 tax tables. Let's see.

In 2023, the standard deduction for single filers is $13,850. Her income is $9,357, which is less than the standard deduction, so her taxable income is zero. Therefore, she doesn't owe any taxes. The amount withheld ($1,397) would be refunded to her, so she doesn't have to pay any additional tax. Thus, the answer is B: $0.

But wait, the question says she claims one exemption. If that's the case, and the personal exemption is zero, then her taxable income remains zero, so she doesn't owe any tax.

Alternatively, if the problem is using an older tax system where personal exemptions are allowed, let's recalculate.

Assume standard deduction is $6,300 (single) and exemption is $4,050.

Her income: $9,357.

Taxable income = 9,357 - 6,300 = 3,057.

Then subtract exemption: 3,057 - 4,050 = negative, so taxable income is zero.

Again, she owes nothing, so no additional tax.

Wait, but then why was $1,397 withheld? Maybe because her employer used a different calculation, but according to her tax return, she doesn't owe anything, so she gets a refund.

Thus, the answer would be B: $0.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is lower than her income but higher when considering the exemption.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the tax brackets.

In 2023, the tax brackets for single filers are:

10% on the first $11,000.

So if her taxable income is, say, $3,000, her tax would be 10% of that, which is $300.

But if her standard deduction is $13,850, her taxable income is zero, so tax is zero.

Wait, but her income is $9,357, which is below the standard deduction, so her taxable income is zero. Therefore, her tax liability is zero. So she doesn't owe any additional tax beyond what's already withheld. Thus, the answer is B: $0.

Wait, but she had $1,397 withheld. If her tax liability is zero, then she would get a refund of $1,397. But the question is asking how much additional tax she must pay, so that would be zero. So the answer is B.

I think that's the correct approach. So the answer is B: $0 (No additional tax due).

To determine how much additional tax Angela must pay, we need to calculate her tax liability based on the given information:

1. **Filing Status and Income**: Angela is single, not the head of a household, and her total income for the year is $9,357. She claims one exemption and takes the standard deduction.

2. **Standard Deduction**: For single filers, the standard deduction varies by tax year. In 2023, the standard deduction for single filers is $13,850. Since Angela's income ($9,357) is less than the standard deduction, her taxable income is reduced to $0 after applying the standard deduction.

3. **Exemptions**: The question mentions that Angela claims one exemption. However, under current tax law (2018–2025), personal exemptions are set to $0 and are not deductible. Therefore, the exemption does not reduce her taxable income further.

4. **Tax Liability**: With a taxable income of $0, Angela's federal tax liability is $0. She does not owe any additional taxes.

5. **Withholding**: $1,397 was withheld as federal tax during the year. Since her tax liability is $0, she would receive a refund of $1,397. However, the question specifically asks how much additional tax she must pay, which is $0.

Thus, Angela does not owe any additional tax. The correct answer is:

**B: $0 (No additional tax due)**

Answer: B
