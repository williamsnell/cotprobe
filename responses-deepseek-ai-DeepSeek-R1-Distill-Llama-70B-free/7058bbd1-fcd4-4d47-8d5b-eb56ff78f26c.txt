Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these ionization and pH problems. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about finding the degree of ionization of 0.05 M NH3 in a solution with a pH of 11.0. They've given me the Kb value as 1.76 × 10^-5. And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Alright, let's think.

I remember that NH3 is a weak base, and when it dissolves in water, it reacts with water to form NH4+ and OH-. The formula is NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH-. The Kb for this reaction is given, which is 1.76e-5.

The problem gives me the concentration of NH3 (0.05 M) and the pH of the solution (11.0). Wait, pH is 11, which is basic because it's greater than 7. So the solution is already basic, but I'm adding a weak base. Hmm, how does that tie in?

I think I need to relate pH to pOH first because NH3 is a base. Oh right, pH + pOH = 14. So pOH is 14 - 11 = 3. Then, the OH- concentration would be 10^-pOH, which is 10^-3 M. So [OH-] is 0.001 M, or 1e-3.

Wait, but when NH3 ionizes, it produces OH- ions. But the solution already has some OH- from somewhere else, maybe from the water or another source. So the total OH- is a combination of that and the NH3 ionization. But I'm not sure if I can just use the given pH to find the OH- concentration and then work with that.

Wait, right! In such cases, when the solution's pH is already known, the contribution of the weak base's ionization to the pH might be negligible or considered. Or maybe I should use the OH- concentration from the pH and plug it into the Kb expression.

Let me think. The degree of ionization (α) is the concentration of the ionized base divided by the initial concentration. So α = [NH4+]/[NH3]_initial.

But to find α, I probably need to set up the Kb expression. The expression is Kb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH3]. But wait, the [OH-] here includes both what's from the solution and what's from NH3. But if the solution's pH is given, then [OH-] is fixed at 1e-3 M. So maybe I can use that.

So, substituting the known values into the Kb expression:

Kb = (x)(1e-3) / (0.05 - x) 

Wait, because the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.05 M, and x is the amount that ionizes. So [NH4+] is x, [OH-] is 1e-3, and [NH3] is 0.05 - x. But wait, isn't the OH- from NH3 included in the 1e-3? Because the pH of the solution is already 11, which gives [OH-] as 1e-3. So the total OH- is 1e-3. But does that include the OH- from NH3's ionization?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I can assume that the OH- from the solution is much larger than what NH3 contributes. So the change due to NH3 is negligible, and I can approximate [OH-] as 1e-3.

In that case, the equation simplifies. Let me write that:

Kb = (x)(1e-3) / (0.05)

Because if x is much smaller than 0.05, then 0.05 - x ≈ 0.05.

So solving for x: Kb = (x * 1e-3) / 0.05

Rearranging, x = (Kb * 0.05) / 1e-3

 Kb is 1.76e-5. So:

x = (1.76e-5 * 0.05) / 1e-3

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1.76e-5 * 0.05 = 8.8e-7.

Then, divide by 1e-3: 8.8e-7 / 1e-3 = 8.8e-4.

So x is 8.8e-4 M. That's the concentration of NH4+.

The initial concentration of NH3 is 0.05 M, so the degree of ionization α is x / 0.05.

So α = (8.8e-4) / 0.05 = 0.0176.

Wait, wait. But that can't be right. Because 0.0176 is 1.76e-2. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. 1.76e-5 multiplied by 0.05.

1.76e-5 * 0.05 = 1.76 * 5e-7 = 8.8e-7. Yes.

Divide that by 1e-3: 8.8e-7 / 1e-3 = 8.8e-4.

So x is 8.8e-4. So [NH4+] is 8.8e-4 M.

Then the degree of ionization is (8.8e-4) / 0.05 = 0.0176 or 1.76e-2. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 1.76e-2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the OH- comes only from the NH3? No, because the solution's pH is given, which dictates the [OH-]. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the given [OH-] in the Kb expression.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the solution's OH- is from both the NH3 and the external source. But if the solution's pH is fixed, then the OH- is fixed, so the ionization of NH3 will adjust accordingly.

So the setup is correct. So x is 8.8e-4. Then α is 8.8e-4 / 0.05 = 1.76e-2.

Wait, looking at the options, E is 1.76e-5, H is 1.73e-3, and I don't see 1.76e-2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait, wait. Maybe the solution is not that straightforward. Because if the solution is already at pH 11, which is higher than the pKa of the conjugate acid of NH3.

Wait, wait a second. NH3 is a base, and its conjugate acid is NH4+. The pKb of NH3 is log(1/(1.76e-5)).

Wait, pKb = log(1/(1.76e-5)) → but wait, that's not right. pKb is -log(Kb). So pKb = -log(1.76e-5) ≈ 4.75.

The pKa of the conjugate acid (NH4+) would be 14 - pKb ≈ 9.25.

So the pH of the solution is 11, which is higher than 9.25. So in such a case, the solution is in a region where the base is deprotonated, right? Or wait, no, because NH3 is a base, not its conjugate.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But since NH3 is a base, maybe that's not the direct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization is affected by the solution's pH.

Wait, but earlier I thought that [OH-] is 1e-3, which is fixed. So if I use that, Kb is (x)(1e-3)/(0.05 - x). But maybe I can't neglect x compared to 0.05, so I have to solve the quadratic equation.

Let me try that approach.

So the equation is Kb = (x)(1e-3) / (0.05 - x )

Substituting Kb:

1.76e-5 = (x * 1e-3) / (0.05 - x )

Multiply both sides by (0.05 - x):

1.76e-5 (0.05 - x) = x * 1e-3

Expand the left side:

1.76e-5 * 0.05 - 1.76e-5 x = 1e-3 x

Calculate 1.76e-5 * 0.05 = 8.8e-7.

So:

8.8e-7 - 1.76e-5 x = 1e-3 x

Bring like terms together:

8.8e-7 = (1e-3 + 1.76e-5 ) x

Calculate 1e-3 = 0.001, and 1.76e-5 is 0.0000176. So sum is 0.0010176.

So:

x = 8.8e-7 / 0.0010176 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

8.8e-7 is 8.8 × 1e-7, and denominator is approx 1.0176e-3.

So 8.8e-7 / 1.0176e-3 = (8.8 / 1.0176) × 1e-4.

Compute 8.8 / 1.0176 ≈ 8.65 (since 1.0176 * 8.65 ≈ 8.8).

So x ≈ 8.65e-4.

So the same as before, x is about 8.65e-4. Then, the degree of ionization α is x / 0.05 = 8.65e-4 / 0.05.

Calculating that: 8.65e-4 /5e-2 = (8.65 /5 )e-2 = 1.73e-2.

Wait, but that's 0.0173, which is 1.73e-2. But looking at the options, I don't see that. The closest options are H (1.73e-3) and I (4.88e-4), but they're much smaller.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, 8.8e-7 divided by 0.0010176. Let me compute it more accurately.

8.8e-7 is 0.00000088.

0.0010176 is 0.001 + 0.0000176 = 0.0010176.

So 0.00000088 / 0.0010176 = let's compute this as (8.8e-7) / (1.0176e-3) ) = (8.8 / 1017.6 ) ≈ 0.000865.

Wait, 8.8 divided by 1017.6 is approximately 0.00865.

Wait, no, wait. 8.8 / 1017.6 is 0.00865? Wait, 1017.6 is about 1000, so 8.8 / 1000 is 0.0088. So 0.0088 is 8.8e-3.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I have a mistake in exponents.

Wait, 8.8e-7 / 1.0176e-3 = (8.8 / 1.0176) * (1e-7 / 1e-3) ) = (8.8 / 1.0176 ) * 1e-4.

So 8.8 / 1.0176 ≈ 8.65, so 8.65 * 1e-4 = 8.65e-4.

Ah, okay, so x is 8.65e-4, as before.

Then, α = 8.65e-4 / 0.05 = 0.0173, which is 1.73e-2.

But looking at the options, I don't see 1.73e-2. The options are:

A: 2e-4

B:6.2e-3

C:9e-4

D:3.5e-3

E:1.76e-5

F:1e-3

G:8.65e-4

H:1.73e-3

I:4.88e-4

J:5.5e-5.

Hmm, none of these match 1.73e-2. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the pH is due to NH3 ionization, and I shouldn't use the given pH's OH- concentration. But that doesn't make sense because the question says it's in a solution of pH 11. So the pH is fixed, perhaps by a strong base.

Wait another thought: Maybe the solution is being buffered at pH 11, so the [OH-] is fixed, so I can use that in the Kb expression.

Wait, but I did that. So why am I not getting an option that matches? Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the OH- concentration.

Wait, let me double-check the pH and pOH. pH is 11, so pOH is 3. [OH-] is 1e-3. That's correct.

So the setup was correct, leading to α = 1.73e-2. But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is asking for the degree of ionization as [NH4+]/[NH3]_initial, which is x/0.05. But maybe I should use a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is in equilibrium, and the [NH3] is approximately 0.05 because x is small. So let's try that approximation.

So Kb = (x)(1e-3) / (0.05) → x = (Kb * 0.05) / 1e-3.

Kb is 1.76e-5. So:

x = (1.76e-5 * 0.05) / 0.001 = (8.8e-7) / 0.001 = 8.8e-4.

So α = 8.8e-4 / 0.05 = 1.76e-2.

Same result as before. Still not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options again, G is 8.65e-4, which is close to the x value I found. So perhaps the question is asking for x, the concentration, not the degree of ionization. But the question says "degree of ionization", which is α, the ratio.

Hmm, but in that case, the options don't include 1.7e-2. So perhaps I have a mistake.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the pH is not due to NH3, but is from an external source. So the presence of NH3 doesn't affect the pH, which is fixed. So the [OH-] is fixed at 1e-3 M.

In that case, the ionization of NH3 would be minimal. Wait, but I've tried that approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the base dissociation equation. So, the base NH3 reacts with water to form NH4+ and OH-.

The solution's pH is 11, which gives [OH-] = 1e-3 M. So, using the Kb expression:

Kb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH3]

We can rearrange for [NH4+]:

[NH4+] = (Kb * [NH3]) / [OH-]

Plugging the numbers:

[NH4+] = (1.76e-5 * 0.05) / (1e-3) = (8.8e-7) / (1e-3) = 8.8e-4 M.

So the concentration of NH4+ is 8.8e-4 M.

The degree of ionization (α) is [NH4+]/[NH3 initial] = 8.8e-4 / 0.05 = 0.0176, or 1.76e-2, which is about 1.7%.

But again, none of the options match this. Wait, but looking at option G, it's 8.65e-4. That's close to 8.8e-4, which is x. So maybe the question is asking for [NH4+], but the question clearly asks for the degree of ionization.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the Kb setup.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for weak base ionization with a common ion. Because in this case, the solution already has OH- ions, which are a product of the base's ionization. So this is similar to the common ion effect.

Wait, that's exactly the case here. So, the presence of OH- from the solution (pH 11) would suppress the ionization of NH3.

So the setup is correct as before. So x is 8.65e-4 (from solving the quadratic), leading to α = 1.73e-2. But I don't see that option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute x.

Wait, when I set up 1.76e-5 = (x)(1e-3)/(0.05 - x), and multiplied both sides by (0.05 - x), I get:

1.76e-5 (0.05 - x) = x * 1e-3.

Expanding that:

8.8e-7 - 1.76e-5 x = 1e-3 x.

Bring all x terms to one side:

8.8e-7 = (1e-3 + 1.76e-5) x.

Compute 1e-3 + 1.76e-5: 1.000 + 0.0176 = 1.0176e-3.

So x = 8.8e-7 / 1.0176e-3 = (8
