Question:

Congress enacts a $100 tax on the sale of any handgun to a private individual not for use in law enforcement or military duties. Will this new handgun tax survive a constitutional challenge?

Options:

A: Yes, if the tax is applied uniformly across all states.
B: Yes, if Congress could have banned possession of handguns outright.
C: No, if the tax is seen as a way to indirectly ban handguns.
D: Yes, if the tax is used to fund law enforcement or military activities.
E: No, if the tax disproportionately affects individuals of lower income.
F: No, because the tax infringes on an individual's right to bear arms.
G: No, if the tax does not result in a significant collection of revenue.
H: No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership.
I: Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.
J: Yes, if the tax is proportional to the cost of the handgun.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this new handgun tax will survive a constitutional challenge. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question states that Congress enacted a $100 tax on the sale of any handgun to a private individual, but it's not for law enforcement or military use. So, the tax is specifically targeting private sales of handguns.

I remember that the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax, but there are limits. One of the key cases here is probably the Supreme Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act, where they upheld the individual mandate as a tax. But that's different because that was a tax on not having insurance, not on a specific item like handguns.

Wait, but then there's the issue of the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, so any law that infringes on that could be problematic. So, the question is whether this tax is an infringement.

I think about whether Congress can tax something in a way that effectively bans it. If the tax is so high that it makes handguns unaffordable, that might be seen as an indirect ban. But if the tax is just a normal revenue measure, it's probably okay.

Option A says yes if applied uniformly. Uniform application usually matters for things like the Commerce Clause, but the tax here is on a specific item, so maybe uniformity isn't the main issue.

Option B says yes if Congress could have banned handguns outright. Wait, I thought that the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller said that bans on handguns are unconstitutional. So Congress can't outright ban them, so if they couldn't ban, can they tax? If the tax is so high that it effectively bans, then maybe it's a problem. So if B says Congress could have banned, but I think they can't, so B might not be correct.

Option C says no if the tax is seen as an indirect ban. That makes sense because if the tax is too burdensome, it could be seen as infringing on the Second Amendment. So C is a possible answer.

Option D says yes if used to fund law enforcement or military. That might make it more reasonable, but I'm not sure if the purpose affects constitutionality. Taxes are usually for revenue, so if the intent is to raise money, that's fine. But the use of funds might not change the constitutional analysis.

Option E says no if it disproportionately affects lower income. That's an equal protection issue, but I'm not sure if that applies here. The tax is on the sale, so everyone pays the same $100. It might affect lower-income people more, but the question is about the constitutional challenge, likely under the Second Amendment, not equal protection.

Option F says no because it infringes on the right to bear arms. That's possible, but if the tax is a legitimate exercise of the taxing power without infringing, it's allowed. So whether it's an infringement depends on the court's view.

Option G says no if the tax doesn't collect much revenue. But the purpose of the tax is to raise revenue; if it doesn't, maybe that's a problem. But I think the intent is what matters, not the actual revenue generated.

Option H says no because it's intended as a penalty. If the tax is so high that its primary purpose is to punish rather than raise revenue, then it might not be a valid tax. The Supreme Court has distinguished between taxes and penalties in some cases, like the ACA case.

Option I says yes if the dominant intent was to produce revenue. That sounds right because as long as Congress's main goal is to raise money, the tax is constitutional, even if it has an effect on behavior. So if the tax is a genuine revenue measure, it should be upheld.

Option J says yes if the tax is proportional to the cost. Proportionality might matter in terms of not being excessive, but I'm not sure if that's a specific legal test here.

Putting it all together: The key issue is whether the tax is a legitimate exercise of Congress's taxing power or if it's an infringement on the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that the government can't impose a tax that effectively prohibits the exercise of a constitutional right. So if the tax is so high that it makes it impossible for people to afford handguns, it could be an infringement. But if the tax is a reasonable revenue measure, it's okay.

In this case, the tax is $100 per handgun. That's not insignificant, but whether it's prohibitive depends on context. However, the question is about the constitutionality, not the policy. So the court would look at whether the tax is a valid exercise of the taxing power, with the intent to raise revenue, and not an infringement.

So looking back at the options, option I says yes if the dominant intent was revenue. That aligns with the idea that if Congress's main purpose is to raise money, the tax is valid. The court would likely defer to Congress's stated intent as long as it's not a clear infringement.

Alternatively, option C says no if the tax is seen as an indirect ban. But if Congress intended it as a tax for revenue, then even if it has a chilling effect, it's permissible. So the intent is key.

In the case of United States v. Kahriger, the Supreme Court upheld a tax on engaging in the business of selling firearms, stating that as long as the tax is not so high as to prohibit the activity, it's constitutional. So a $100 tax on each sale would likely be seen as a permissible tax unless it's shown to be prohibitive.

Therefore, the correct answer is I: Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.

The question asks whether a $100 tax on the sale of handguns to private individuals survives a constitutional challenge. The analysis focuses on Congress's taxing power and potential infringement on the Second Amendment. The tax must be a legitimate exercise of the taxing power, with the primary intent to raise revenue, rather than an indirect ban on handguns. 

Key considerations include:

- **Second Amendment Protections**: The tax could be challenged if it unduly burdens the right to bear arms. However, a reasonable tax for revenue purposes is generally permissible.
- **Intent of Congress**: If the dominant intent is to raise revenue, the tax is more likely to be upheld. The Supreme Court has upheld similar taxes in cases like *United States v. Kahriger*, where the tax was deemed constitutional as long as it did not prohibit the activity.
- **Proportionality and Revenue Generation**: The tax amount ($100) is not inherently prohibitive, and the focus is on whether it serves as a legitimate revenue measure.

Among the options, **Option I** aligns with the principle that a tax is constitutional if its dominant intent is to produce revenue. This reflects the court's deference to Congress's taxing power when the primary purpose is revenue generation, rather than an indirect ban on handguns.
