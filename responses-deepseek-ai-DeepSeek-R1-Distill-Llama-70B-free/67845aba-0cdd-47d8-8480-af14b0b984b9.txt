Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a narrow band of light with a mean wavelength of 520 nm. It says the light is chopped by a shutter at a frequency of 40 MHz, and I need to find the bandwidth in angstroms. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that when light is chopped, it's usually modulated, which might relate to the frequency of the modulation. But how does that affect the bandwidth? I think the bandwidth of the light itself is related to the coherence length or something like that. Oh right, maybe it's about the relation between the modulation frequency and the spectral bandwidth.

I recall something about the Fourier transform and the time-bandwidth product. Like, if you have a pulse in the time domain, its Fourier transform gives the spectrum, and the product of the temporal width and spectral width is a constant. But wait, in this case, the chopping is periodic, so maybe it's not a single pulse but a continuous modulation.

Hmm, another approach comes to mind. The problem might involve the relation between frequency modulation and the resulting bandwidth. But I'm not sure. I think I remember that the bandwidth can be estimated using the formula delta_lambda = (c / lambda^2) * delta_t, where delta_t is the time related to the modulation.

Wait, delta_t would be the period of the shutter's chopping. So the period T is 1/frequency. The frequency here is 40 MHz, which is 40e6 Hz. So T is 1/(40e6) seconds, which is 2.5e-8 seconds.

Putting that into the formula, delta_lambda equals (c) times (delta_t) divided by (lambda squared). Let's plug in the numbers.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 520 nm, which is 520e-9 meters.

So delta_lambda = (3e8 m/s) * (2.5e-8 s) / (520e-9 m)^2.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 3e8 * 2.5e-8 = 3e8 * 2.5e-8 = (3 * 2.5) * 1e0 = 7.5 * 1 = 7.5 m.

Wait, wait, 3e8 * 2.5e-8 = (3 * 2.5) * (1e8 * 1e-8) )= 7.5 * 1e0 =7.5.

Now the denominator is (520e-9)^2. Let's compute that.

520e-9 is 5.2e-7 m. Squared is (5.2e-7)^2 = (5.2)^2 * (1e-14) = 27.04e-14 m².

Wait, 520e-9 is 520 * 1e-9, which is 5.2 * 1e-7 m. So squared is (5.2e-7)^2.

So 5.2 squared is 27.04, and (1e-7)^2 is 1e-14. So denominator is 27.04e-14 m².

So delta_lambda is 7.5 / 27.04e-14 m.

Wait, let me compute that: 7.5 divided by 27.04e-14.

7.5 / 27.04 is approximately 0.2776. So 0.2776 / 1e-14 m.

Wait, no, because denominator is 27.04e-14, which is 2.704e-13 m².

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 7.5 divided by (520e-9)^2. Let's compute (520e-9)^2:

520^2 is 270400. So 270400e-18 m².

So 520e-9 squared is (520)^2 * (1e-9)^2 = 270400e-18 m² = 2.704e-14 m².

So delta_lambda = (3e8 * 2.5e-8) / (2.704e-14) ) 

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate the numbers.

3e8 * 2.5e-8 = 3 * 2.5 =7.5 and 1e8 * 1e-8 is 1e0, so 7.5.

Denominator: (520e-9 m)^2 = (520)^2 * (1e-9)^2 = 270400 * 1e-18 = 2.704e-14 m².

So delta_lambda = 7.5 / 2.704e-14 m.

Wait, 7.5 divided by 2.704e-14 is approximately:

7.5 / 2.704 = approx 2.777, so 2.777e14 m.

Wait, wait, that can't be. Because 7.5 / 2.7e-14 is 7.5/(2.7e-14) )= approx (7.5/2.7) ) * 1e14 = approx 2.777e14 meters.

Wait, that's way too big. Because 1e14 meters is way larger than the wavelength of 520 nm. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Maybe the formula isn't delta_lambda = c * delta_t / lambda^2. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The bandwidth in wavelength is approximately (c * delta_t) / (lambda^2), but perhaps I confused delta_t. Alternatively, perhaps it's (delta_lambda / lambda^2) = (delta_t * c)/ (lambda)^2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the relation between the coherence time and the bandwidth.

Coherence time tau is related to the bandwidth delta_f by tau = 1/(2 pi delta_f). Or something like that.

But wait, the frequency here is the modulation frequency, f_mod =40 MHz. So the period is T=1/f_mod=2.5e-8 s.

Wait, but the relation between the bandwidth in frequency and the modulation frequency isn't direct. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Fourier transform of a shutter opening for a time T, which would give a certain bandwidth.

In that case, the Fourier transform of a rectangular function (the shutter being open for a time T) would have a sinc function shape, and the bandwidth would be inversely proportional to the width of the shutter.

The 3 dB bandwidth would be approximately 0.886/(pi*T). Wait, but this is in frequency domain.

Wait, the bandwidth in terms of frequency would be delta_f ≈ 1/(2 pi T). So delta_f ≈ 1/(2 pi * 2.5e-8 s) = 1/(5e-8 * pi) ) ≈ 6.366e6 Hz.

But wait, the question is about the bandwidth in wavelength, not frequency. So I need to convert this delta_f into delta_lambda.

The relation between delta_f and delta_lambda is given by delta_lambda = (c / f^2) * delta_f.

Wait, because lambda = c/f, so d lambda = -c/(f^2) df.

So delta_lambda = (c / f^2) * delta_f.

But f is the center frequency, which is c/lambda. So substituting, f = c/lambda. So f^2 = c^2/lambda^2.

So delta_lambda = (c / (c^2/lambda^2) ) * delta_f ) = (lambda^2 / c ) * delta_f.

Wait, let me compute that.

delta_lambda = (lambda^2 / c) * delta_f.

So lambda is 520 nm = 520e-9 m.

delta_f I had as approximately 6.366e6 Hz.

So delta_lambda = ( (520e-9)^2 ) / (3e8 m/s) ) * 6.366e6 Hz.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, (520e-9)^2 = (520)^2 * (1e-9)^2 = 270400 * 1e-18 = 2.704e-14 m².

Divide that by 3e8 m/s: 2.704e-14 / 3e8 = 9.013e-23 m²s.

Multiply by delta_f=6.366e6 Hz: 9.013e-23 *6.366e6 = let's compute that.

9.013e-23 *6.366e6 = (9.013 *6.366) * 1e(-23+6) = approx 57.35 * 1e-17 = 5.735e-16 m.

Convert that to meters: 5.735e-16 m.

But wait, the question asks for the bandwidth in angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters.

So 5.735e-16 m divided by 1e-10 m/A = 5.735e-6 A.

Wait, that's 5.735e-6 angstroms, which is 5.735e-6 A.

Looking at the options, option I is 4e-5, but wait, none of the options match this exactly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers more accurately.

First, compute delta_f. The approach was that the bandwidth (in frequency) is approximately 1/(2 pi T), where T is the period of the shutter.

So T=1/(40e6) Hz= 2.5e-8 s.

So delta_f=1/(2 pi T )=1/(2 pi * 2.5e-8) )= 1/(5e-8 pi )= approx 6.366e6 Hz.

Yes, that's correct.

Then delta_lambda = (lambda^2 / c) * delta_f.

lambda=520e-9 m.

lambda squared is (520e-9)^2 = 520^2 *1e-18 = 270400e-18 = 2.704e-14 m².

c=3e8 m/s.

So lambda²/c = 2.704e-14 / 3e8 = approx 9.013e-23 m²s.

Multiply by delta_f=6.366e6: 9.013e-23 *6.366e6.

Compute 9.013 *6.366: let's see, 9*6=54, 9*0.366=3.294, 0.013*6=0.078, 0.013*0.366≈0.004758. So total is approximately 54 +3.294 +0.078 +0.004758≈57.376.

So 57.376e-17 m, which is 5.7376e-16 m.

Convert to angstroms: 5.7376e-16 m / 1e-10 m/A =5.7376e-6 A.

So approximately 5.74e-6 A.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 2e-5, but that's 2e-5 which is 2e-5 A. Wait, 5.7e-6 is 0.57e-5, which is 5.7e-6 A.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 6 ×10^-5nm =6e-5 nm=6e-5*0.1 A=6e-6 A.

Wait no, wait, 1 nm is 0.1 A. So 1 A is 10 nm.

Wait, no, 1 nm is 10 angstroms. So 1e-9 m is 1 nm, which is 0.1 A (since 1 A is 1e-10 m).

Wait, no, 1 angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1 nm =10 angstroms. So if I have 5.74e-6 A, that's 5.74e-6 * 0.1 nm =5.74e-7 nm.

But the question asks for the bandwidth in angstroms, so it's 5.74e-6 A.

Looking at the options, none of the options seem to match exactly. Let me look again.

Option B is 5e-5 nm, which is 5e-5 *0.1 A=5e-6 A. Wait, no, wait, the options are given in angstroms, I think. Wait, looking back at the question.

Wait the question says "determine the bandwidth (in Å)".

Wait, the options are:

Option A:6e-5 nm

Wait wait, no, I think I misread. Let me look again.

Wait the options are in nm? No, the question says the answer is in Å. Wait, the options are written as, for example, A:6 ×10^-5 nm. Oh wait, that's 6e-5 nm, which is 0.6 nm, which is 6e-5 nm. But wait, 1 nm is 10 angstroms, so 6e-5 nm is 6e-6 angstroms. Because 1 nm =10 A. So 6e-5 nm =6e-5 *10 A =6e-4 A.

Wait, I'm getting really confused. Let me clarify.

The question asks for the bandwidth in angstroms (Å). The options list various values in nm (nanometers). Wait, that's strange. Because 1 Å is 0.1 nm. So if the answer is in Å, but the options are in nm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are in Å, but the labels are wrong. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the options are:

A: 6 ×10^-5nm → 6e-5 nm.

B:5 ×10^-5 nm.

C:1 ×10^-5 nm.

D:1 ×10^-4 nm.

E:2 ×10^-5 nm.

F:8 ×10^-5 nm.

G:9 ×10^-6 nm.

H:3 ×10^-5 nm.

I:4 ×10^-5 nm.

J:7 ×10^-6 nm.

Wait, if the question asks for the answer in Å, but the options are in nm, then there's a confusion. Because 1 nm is 10 Å. So 1e-5 nm is 1e-6 Å.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say the calculation gives delta_lambda as 5.7e-6 Å, which is 5.7e-6 angstroms.

But the options are in nm. So 5.7e-6 Å is 5.7e-7 nm. Because 1 Å = 0.1 nm.

So 5.7e-6 Å =5.7e-6 *0.1 nm=5.7e-7 nm.

But looking at the options, I don't see 5.7e-7 nm. The closest is option G:9e-6 nm and option J:7e-6 nm, but those are larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the correct formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The relation between the modulation frequency and the bandwidth in terms of wavelength.

I recall that the bandwidth can be calculated using the formula delta_lambda = (c / f_chop) * (1/ (4 pi)) ) or something like that. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's using the relation between the coherent length and the bandwidth.

Coherent length L is approximately lambda^2 / (delta_lambda). And the coherent time tau is L/c.

But I'm not sure how this connects to the chopping frequency.

Wait, the chopping frequency is 40 MHz. So the shutter is open for a certain time, which relates to the coherent time.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fourier transform approach is better. The chopping can be considered as a rectangular pulse in the time domain, and its Fourier transform gives the spectrum.

The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width T is a sinc function, and the width of the main lobe is inversely proportional to T. So the bandwidth delta_f is about 1/(2T).

Wait, but then delta_f is in frequency (Hz). Then convert that to delta_lambda.

So let me try this approach.

Given the chopping frequency f=40 MHz, the period T=1/f=2.5e-8 s.

The bandwidth in frequency is approximately 1/(2T) = 1/(5e-8) = 2e7 Hz.

Wait, that's 20 MHz.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1/(2 pi T) which was about 6e6 Hz. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of duration T is (sin(pi f T)) / (pi f T), and the first zero occurs at f=1/T. So the bandwidth between the first zeros is approximately 1/T. But often, the 3 dB bandwidth is considered, which is about 0.89/(T). Or sometimes the full width at half maximum is used.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the shutter frequency to the spectral bandwidth.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the fact that the modulation at a certain frequency imposes a certain bandwidth on the light.

Wait, another formula comes to mind: The spectral bandwidth delta_nu (in frequency) is related to the modulation frequency f_mod by delta_nu ≈ f_mod / (2 pi).

Wait, but if the modulation is at 40 MHz, then delta_nu would be 40e6 / (2 pi) ≈6.366e6 Hz, which matches what I calculated earlier.

So delta_nu ≈6.366e6 Hz.

Now, converting this to delta_lambda.

We have delta_lambda = (c / (lambda^2)) * delta_nu * lambda.

Wait, wait, because delta_lambda = (c / (f^2)) * delta_f.

And since f=c/lambda, so f^2 = c^2 / lambda^2.

So delta_lambda = (c / (c^2/lambda^2 )) * delta_f = (lambda^2 / c) * delta_f.

Plugging in the numbers again.

lambda =520
