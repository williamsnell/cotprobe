Okay, so I have this question about the chemical shift in NMR and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question says that the chemical shift of the CH3 protons in acetaldehyde is δ=2.20 ppm and the CHO proton is δ=9.80 ppm. I need to find the difference in the local magnetic field between these two regions when the applied field is 1.5 T. The options are from A to J, each a certain microtesla value.

Hmm. I remember that chemical shift (δ) is related to the difference in the magnetic environments of the protons. The formula I think is something like δ = (ΔB / B0) * 10^6, where ΔB is the difference in the magnetic field and B0 is the applied magnetic field.

Wait, so the chemical shift is in parts per million (ppm). So yes, the formula is δ = (ΔB / B0) * 1e6. So rearranging that, ΔB = (δ * B0) / 1e6.

But wait, here we have two different δ values. So maybe I should subtract one from the other? Like, the difference in chemical shifts is 9.80 - 2.20 = 7.60 ppm.

Oh right! Because each proton experiences a different local magnetic field. So the difference in their chemical shifts would give the difference in their local fields.

So, the difference in δ is 7.60 ppm. Then, using the formula, the difference in B (ΔB) would be:

ΔB = (7.60 ppm * B0) / 1e6.

Wait, B0 is given as 1.5 T. So plugging in:

ΔB = (7.60 * 1.5) / 1e6 T.

Calculating that, 7.60 * 1.5 is 11.4. So 11.4 / 1e6 is 0.0000114 T. Wait, but 1 T is 1e6 microtesla, right? Because 1 T = 1e6 μT. Oh wait, no, 1 T = 1e6 μT? Wait, no, wait—wait. Let me think. 1 Tesla is 1e6 microtesla? No, wait, 1 microtesla is 1e-6 Tesla. So 1 Tesla is 1e6 microtesla. So 0.0000114 T is 0.0000114 * 1e6 μT. Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.0000114 T equals 11.4 μT. Because 0.0000114 T * 1e6 μT/T = 11.4 μT. So that's 11.4 microtesla.

Looking at the options, option E is 11 μT, which is close. Hmm, but wait, maybe I did some rounding. Let me check the calculation again.

The difference in chemical shifts is 9.80 - 2.20 = 7.60 ppm. B0 is 1.5 T. So ΔB = (7.60 * 1.5) / 1e6 = (11.4) / 1e6 T = 11.4e-6 T. To convert to microtesla, since 1e-6 T is 1 μT, so 11.4e-6 T is 11.4 μT. So the answer should be approximately 11.4 μT.

Looking at the options, option E is 11 μT, which is the closest. But wait, let me check the available options again.

Options: A is 8, B:25, C:14, D:18, E:11, F:20, G:22, H:30, I:5, J:15.

So E is 11 and J is 15. Hmm. But I thought it was exactly 11.4. So why isn't there an option for 11.4? Let me see if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (δ1 - δ2) * B0 * (1e-6). So yes, that's correct.

Wait another thing: the formula is ΔB = (δ1 - δ2) * B0 * (1e-6).

So 7.6 ppm * 1.5 T gives 11.4, which would be 11.4 μT. Since the options don't have 11.4, but E is 11 μT, perhaps the intended answer is E. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the difference in their local magnetic environments, which could involve something else. But I don't think so. The chemical shift difference directly relates to the difference in their local B fields. So the calculation seems correct.

So the correct answer should be 11.4 μT, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E) 11 μT.

To determine the difference in local magnetic field between the $\mathrm{CH}_3$ and $\mathrm{CHO}$ protons in acetaldehyde, we use the relationship between chemical shift ($\delta$) and the difference in magnetic field ($\Delta B$):

\[
\Delta B = \frac{\delta}{10^6} \cdot B_0
\]

Here, the difference in chemical shifts is:

\[
\Delta \delta = \delta_{\mathrm{CHO}} - \delta_{\mathrm{CH}_3} = 9.80 - 2.20 = 7.60 \, \text{ppm}.
\]

The applied magnetic field ($B_0$) is given as $1.5 \, \mathrm{T}$. Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\Delta B = \frac{7.60}{10^6} \cdot 1.5 = 0.0000114 \, \mathrm{T}.
\]

Converting this to microtesla ($\mu \mathrm{T}$), where $1 \, \mathrm{T} = 10^6 \, \mu \mathrm{T}$:

\[
\Delta B = 0.0000114 \cdot 10^6 = 11.4 \, \mu \mathrm{T}.
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value to $11.4 \, \mu \mathrm{T}$ is $11 \, \mu \mathrm{T}$, which corresponds to option E.
