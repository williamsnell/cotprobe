Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. It's about finding the pH and the percent hydrolysis of a sodium acetate solution. Hmm, I remember that sodium acetate is a salt that comes from a weak acid, right? Acetic acid. So when sodium acetate dissolves in water, it dissociates into Na+ and C2H3O2^- ions. 

Wait, sodium is a spectator ion, so it doesn't undergo hydrolysis. Only the acetate ions (C2H3O2^-) will react with water. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it should hydrolyze in water to form some acetic acid and hydroxide ions. That should make the solution basic, so the pH should be higher than 7.

The problem gives me the initial concentration of NaC2H3O2 as 0.1 M. I think the first step is to write the hydrolysis reaction. So, C2H3O2^- + H2O ↔ HC2H3O2 + OH^-.

The K for this reaction is the dissociation constant, Kdiss. Oh wait, wait, wait. Kdiss is actually the hydrolysis constant, right? And they've given Kdiss as 1.8e-5. Oh, wait, wait, but I think Kdiss might be the same as Kb for the acetate ion. Because Kb is the base dissociation constant. So how are Kb and Kdiss related? Hmm, I think Kdiss is Kb in this context.

Alternatively, I remember that Kdiss (or Kb) can be calculated using Kw and Ka. But since they gave Kdiss as 1.8e-5, maybe I should just use that directly. So the Kb is 1.8e-5. 

Wait, but wait, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Oh, right. Acetic acid's Ka is around 1.8e-5, which would make Kb for acetate 1.0e-14 / 1.8e-5 = approximately 5.56e-10. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem states Kdiss is 1.8e-5. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait no, maybe the question is giving Kdiss as the hydrolysis constant. So perhaps Kdiss is equal to the Kb for the acetate ion. Let me clarify: the hydrolysis reaction is C2H3O2^- + H2O ↔ HC2H3O2 + OH^-, and the equilibrium expression is Kb = [HC2H3O2][OH^-]/[C2H3O2^-]. So in this case, Kb is given as 1.8e-5, which is different from my earlier thought. Because if the Ka of acetic acid is 1.8e-5, then Kb of acetate would be 5.56e-10, which is much smaller. So why does the problem say Kdiss is 1.8e-5? That's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the Kdiss given is the Ka for acetic acid. No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using Kdiss as the ionization constant for the hydrolysis reaction, so Kdiss equals Kb, which is 1.8e-5. So I'll proceed with that, using Kb = 1.8e-5.

The initial concentration is 0.1 M for the acetate ion. Let's set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis.

Initial:
[C2H3O2^-] = 0.1 M
[HC2H3O2] = 0
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
[C2H3O2^-] decreases by x
[HC2H3O2] increases by x
[OH^-] increases by x

So equilibrium concentrations are:
[C2H3O2^-] = 0.1 - x
[HC2H3O2] = x
[OH^-] = x

The Kb expression is (x)(x) / (0.1 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Assuming that x is small compared to 0.1, because Kb is small, we can approximate 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1. So the equation becomes x^2 / 0.1 ≈ 1.8e-5. 

Then x^2 ≈ 0.1 * 1.8e-5 = 1.8e-6. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.8e-6) ≈ 1.34e-3 M. So [OH^-] is approximately 0.00134 M.

Wait, but let's check if the assumption holds. x is 0.00134, which is 1.34% of 0.1, which is less than 5%, so the assumption is okay.

Then pOH = -log [OH^-] = -log(0.00134). Let me calculate that. 0.00134 is 1.34e-3. Log(1.34) is about 0.127, so log(1.34e-3) is 0.127 -3 = -2.873. So pOH is 2.873, so pH = 14 - pOH = 11.127, approximately 11.13.

Wait, but wait, looking at the answer choices, I don't see 11.13 as an option. Let me look at the options again. The options are A: pH 10.88, B: same pH, C:9.88, D:10.38, E:11.38, F:9.88, G:11.88, H:11.88, I:8.88, J:9.38.

Hmm, so 11.13 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should not have approximated. Let me do the exact calculation without approximation to see if it makes a difference.

So the equation is x² / (0.1 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Multiply both sides by (0.1 - x):

x² = 1.8e-5 * (0.1 - x)

x² = 1.8e-6 - 1.8e-5 x

Bring all terms to one side:

x² + 1.8e-5 x - 1.8e-6 = 0

This is a quadratic equation: x² + 1.8e-5 x - 1.8e-6 = 0.

Using quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)] / 2a. Here, a=1, b=1.8e-5, c= -1.8e-6.

Discriminant D = (1.8e-5)^2 + 4*1*1.8e-6.

Calculate each term:

(1.8e-5)^2 = 3.24e-10.

4 * 1 * 1.8e-6 = 7.2e-6.

So D = 3.24e-10 + 7.2e-6 ≈ 7.200324e-6, because 7.2e-6 is much larger than 3.24e-10.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(7.200324e-6) ≈ 0.0026838.

So x = [-1.8e-5 + 0.0026838 ] / 2.

Because the negative root would give a negative x, which is not possible.

So x ≈ ( -0.000018 + 0.0026838 ) / 2 ≈ (0.0026658) / 2 ≈ 0.0013329 M. So [OH^-] ≈ 0.0013329 M.

So pOH = -log(0.0013329) = ?

Log(1.3329e-3) = log(1.3329) + log(1e-3) = 0.1248 -3 → -2.8752.

So pOH ≈ 2.8752 → pH = 14 - 2.8752 ≈ 11.1248, so around 11.12. Still, not matching the options given.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Kb value. Oh wait, earlier I thought that Kdiss is the Kb, but perhaps Kdiss is the Ka of the acid. Wait, let's think again. The problem says Kdiss = 1.8e-5. So perhaps Kdiss is the Ka of the conjugate acid, but that's not right. Because the hydrolysis of the acetate ion is a base, so Kb should be 1.8e-5.

Wait, but let me think again: for a salt of a weak acid, the hydrolysis of the anion is governed by Kb. So Kb = [HC2H3O2][OH^-]/[C2H3O2^-].

But what's the relation between Kdiss and Kb? If Kdiss is the same as Kb, then yes. So I think I correctly used Kb = 1.8e-5.

Hmm, but the pH I calculated isn't among any of the options. The closest is E: pH 11.38, H:11.88, G:11.88. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of x. So with x ≈ 0.0013329, that's 1.3329e-3 M. So pOH is 2.875, so pH is 11.125. So approximately 11.13.

Looking at the options, E is 11.38, which is 0.25 higher. Hmm, maybe I should check the [OH^-] calculation again.

Wait, let me calculate pOH more accurately. [OH^-] is 0.0013329 M.

pOH = -log(0.0013329) = ?

Let me compute this precisely. Let me use the log table method.

Log(1.3329) is approximately:

We know that log(1.3) is 0.1139, log(1.33) is around 0.1222, log(1.332) ≈ 0.1229, and log(1.3329) ≈ 0.1235.

So log(1.3329e-3) = 0.1235 -3 = -2.8765. So pOH is 2.8765, making pH 14 - 2.8765 = 11.1235, so pH ≈ 11.12. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Maybe the Kdiss given is the Ka for the hydrolysis of water, which would be Kw. No, that's 1e-14. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for percent hydrolysis. The percent hydrolysis is (x / initial concentration) * 100.

So x is 0.0013329 M, initial concentration is 0.1 M, so percent hydrolysis is (0.0013329 / 0.1) *100 = 1.3329%. Hmm, so about 1.33%.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C: 1.75%, but its pH is 9.88, which is way lower than what I calculated. Alternatively, option G: pH 11.88, hydrolysis 1.75%. Hmm, but my pH is 11.12, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb value. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The problem gives Kdiss = 1.8e-5. Wait, perhaps Kdiss is the Ka of acetic acid, not the Kb of acetate. Because if that's the case, then Kb would be Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 ≈ 5.5556e-10.

Wait, that would make Kb much smaller, so the solution would be much less basic. Let me try that approach.

If Kb = 5.5556e-10, then the same setup applies. The ICE table is same.

So Kb = x² / (0.1 - x) ≈ x² / 0.1 = 5.5556e-10.

So x² ≈ 5.5556e-10 * 0.1 = 5.5556e-11 → x ≈ 7.45e-6 M.

Then [OH^-] is 7.45e-6 M. pOH would be -log(7.45e-6) ≈ 5.128. So pH ≈ 14 -5.128 = 8.872, about 8.87.

Looking at options, option J has pH 9.38, which is higher. Option I has pH 8.88, which is close. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, [OH^-] =7.45e-6 → pOH is log(7.45e-6) → log(7.45)=0.871, so pOH=5 -0.871=4.129? Wait, no. Wait, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, wait, 7.45e-6 is 7.45 x 10^-6. So the log is log(7.45) + log(1e-6) → 0.871 + (-6) → -5.129. So pOH is 5.129, so pH is 14-5.129=8.871. So pH≈8.87.

Looking at the options, option I is pH 8.88, which is very close. So that would make sense.

Then the percent hydrolysis would be (x/0.1)*100 = (7.45e-6 / 0.1)*100 = 0.745%. So around 0.75%.

Looking at the options, option A and B have 0.75% and 0.85% hydrolysis, but their pH is 10.88, which is higher than 8.87. So perhaps I mixed up Kdiss and Kb.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The problem states Kdiss =1.8e-5. I'm assuming that Kdiss is the Kb of the acetate ion. But if that's correct, I get pH=11.12, which isn't an option. But if Kdiss is actually the Ka of acetic acid, then Kb is 5.5556e-10, which gives pH≈8.87, which is option I, with 1.75% hydrolysis. But wait, in that case, the percent hydrolysis would be 0.745%, which is 0.75%, but option I's hydrolysis is 1.75%. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify what Kdiss refers to. The term Kdiss might refer to the dissociation constant of the weak acid, which would be the Ka. So if Kdiss is the Ka of acetic acid, then Kb of acetate would be Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 ≈ 5.5556e-10. 

So, using Kb = 5.5556e-10, [C2H3O2^-] is 0.1 M. So the hydrolysis reaction is C2H3O2^- + H2O ↔ HC2H3O2 + OH^-. 

The ICE table gives x^2/(0.1 -x) = 5.5556e-10. Since Kb is very small, x will be very small, so 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1. So x^2 = 5.5556e-10 * 0.1 → x^2 =5.5556e-11 → x≈7.45e-6 M.

So [OH-] =7.45e-6 M → pOH ≈5.128 → pH=14-5.128=8.872, which is about 8.87. Looking at the options, option I is pH 8.88, percent hydrolysis 1.75%. But wait, the percent hydrolysis here is (7.45e-6 / 0.1)*100=0.745%, so 0.75%. Option A has 0.75% hydrolysis, but pH 10.88, which doesn't match. Option F has 0.75% hydrolysis, pH 9.88, which also doesn't match.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses Kdiss as the hydrolysis constant, which is same as Kb. So let me go back to that approach, but why isn't the pH matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pH. Let me recalculate the pH when Kb is 1.8e-5.

So with Kb=1.8e-5, initial concentration 0.1 M.

The expression: x²/(0.1 -x)=1.8e-5.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.1, x²=1.8e-5 *0.1 =1.8e-6 → x= sqrt(1.8e-6)=~0.00134 M.

So [OH-]=0.00134 M → pOH= log(1/0.00134)= log(746. ≈ 746? Wait, no, wait, pOH is -log[OH-], which is -log(0.00134)=2.873. So pH=14-2.873=11.127, so 11.13.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: pH 11.38, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps the assumption that x is negligible isn't valid. Let me do the exact calculation.

The equation is x² + 1.8e-5 x - 1.8e-6=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=1.8e-5, c= -1.8e-6.

Discriminant D= (1.8e-5)^2 +4*1*1.8e-6 =3.24e-10 +7.2e-6=
