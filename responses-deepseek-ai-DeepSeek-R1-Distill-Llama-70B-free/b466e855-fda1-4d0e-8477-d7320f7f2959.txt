Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about wave functions and the intensity of light flashes. Hmm, I remember that the intensity is related to the square of the wave function's amplitude. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that at x0 = 1 unit, the wave function is +1. In some interval around x0=1, there are 100 light flashes per minute. I think the intensity here is proportional to the square of the wave function's value. So, since the wave function is 1, the intensity would be 1 squared, which is 1. But wait, how does that relate to the 100 flashes? Oh right, that must mean that the intensity I is proportional to |ψ(x)|², and the flashes per minute are proportional to I.

So I think the idea is that the number of flashes is proportional to the square of the wave function. So if at x=1, ψ=1 and flashes are 100 per minute, that means that the intensity I is |ψ|² multiplied by some constant. Let's say I = k * |ψ|², where k is a proportionality constant.

So when x=1, I = k*(1)^2 = k. And this gives 100 flashes. So k must be 100. So the general formula for intensity at any x would be I = 100 * |ψ(x)|².

Now, the question asks for the intensity at x=2, 3, 4 units where ψ has values +4, +2, and -2, respectively.

Let's calculate each:

At x=2: ψ=4. So I = 100*(4)^2 = 100*16 = 1600 flashes per minute.

At x=3: ψ=2. So I = 100*(2)^2 = 100*4 = 400.

At x=4: ψ=-2. The square is positive, so I=100*( (-2)^2 )= 100*4=400.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which one matches 1600, 400, 400.

Looking at the options:

Option F is 1600,400,400.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: 1600,800,200. No.

Option F: 1600,400,400. Yes, that's the one.

So the answer should be option F.

The intensity of light flashes is proportional to the square of the wave function's amplitude, \( I = k \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \). At \( x_0 = 1 \), where \( \psi(x_0) = 1 \), the number of flashes is 100 per minute. This implies \( k = 100 \), so the intensity formula becomes \( I = 100 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \).

Using this formula:

- At \( x = 2 \), \( \psi = 4 \):  
  \( I = 100 \cdot (4)^2 = 1600 \, \text{flashes/min} \).

- At \( x = 3 \), \( \psi = 2 \):  
  \( I = 100 \cdot (2)^2 = 400 \, \text{flashes/min} \).

- At \( x = 4 \), \( \psi = -2 \):  
  \( I = 100 \cdot (-2)^2 = 400 \, \text{flashes/min} \).

The intensities at \( x = 2, 3, 4 \) are \( 1600, 400, 400 \, \text{flashes/min} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**F: 1600 flashes/min, 400 flashes/min, 400 flashes/min.**

Answer: F
