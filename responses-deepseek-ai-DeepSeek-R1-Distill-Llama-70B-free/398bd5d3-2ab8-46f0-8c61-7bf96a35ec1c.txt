Okay, so I've got this question here about converting body temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin. Hmm, I think I remember that body temperature is usually around 98.6°F on average. The question is asking me to find what that is in Celsius and Kelvin scales. 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the conversion formulas. Let me think. Oh right, to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, there's a specific formula. I think it's something like subtracting 32 and then multiplying by 5/9. Right, the formula is C = (F - 32) * (5/9). So I need to apply that to 98.6°F.

Let me do the math step by step. First, subtract 32 from 98.6. So 98.6 minus 32 is... 66.6. Okay, that's the first part. Now I need to multiply that by 5/9. So 66.6 times 5 is 333, and then divided by 9. Let me see, 333 divided by 9. Well, 9 times 37 is 333 because 9*30 is 270, 9*7 is 63, so 270+63=333. So that gives me 37°C. Oh, so the Celsius part is 37.00°C. 

But wait, I remember sometimes the exact conversion can have more decimal places, but I think 37 is the standard conversion for 98.6°F. So part (a) is 37.00°C.

Now for part (b), converting Celsius to Kelvin. I think the formula is Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15. So if I have 37°C, adding 273.15 to that should give me the Kelvin temperature. 

So 37 plus 273.15 is 310.15 K. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes there because it's a straightforward addition.

Now I should check the answer options to see which one matches both 37.00°C and 310.15 K. Looking at the options:

Option A: 37.00°C, 310.15K. That matches exactly what I calculated. 

Wait, let me make sure none of the other options have similar numbers. Option B is 37.5°C, which is higher than what I got. Option G is 38°C, which is even higher. So yeah, option A is the correct one.

To convert the average body temperature of 98.6°F to the Celsius and Kelvin scales:

1. **Fahrenheit to Celsius**:  
   The formula is:  
   \[
   C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
   \]  
   Substituting \( F = 98.6 \):  
   \[
   C = (98.6 - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} = 66.6 \times \frac{5}{9} = 37.00^\circ \text{C}
   \]

2. **Celsius to Kelvin**:  
   The formula is:  
   \[
   K = C + 273.15
   \]  
   Substituting \( C = 37.00 \):  
   \[
   K = 37.00 + 273.15 = 310.15 \, \text{K}
   \]

Thus, the temperature is \( 37.00^\circ \text{C} \) on the Celsius scale and \( 310.15 \, \text{K} \) on the Kelvin scale. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: 37.00°C, 310.15K**
