Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that x-3 and y+3 are multiples of 7. I need to find the smallest positive integer n such that x² + xy + y² + n is a multiple of 7. The options are from A to J, with numbers 1 to 10, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. Since x-3 is a multiple of 7, that means x ≡ 3 mod 7. Similarly, y+3 being a multiple of 7 implies y ≡ -3 mod 7. Wait, but -3 mod 7 is the same as 4 mod 7, because 7-3 is 4. So y ≡ 4 mod 7.

So, x is congruent to 3 mod 7, and y is congruent to 4 mod 7. Now I need to compute x² + xy + y² and then find what n makes this sum plus n divisible by 7, i.e., ≡0 mod7.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute x² mod7. Since x ≡3 mod7, x² is 3²=9. 9 mod7 is 2. So x² ≡2.

Next, compute y² mod7. y is 4 mod7, so y² is 16. 16 mod7 is 2, since 7*2=14, 16-14=2. So y² ≡2.

Now, compute xy mod7. x is 3, y is4. 3 *4=12. 12 mod7 is 5, because 7*1=7, 12-7=5. So xy ≡5 mod7.

Now, add them all up: x² + xy + y² ≡2 +5 +2 =9. 9 mod7 is 2, because 7*1=7, 9-7=2. So the sum is 2 mod7.

We need x² +xy +y² +n ≡0 mod7. So 2 +n ≡0 mod7. That means n ≡-2 mod7. But since we're looking for the smallest positive integer, -2 mod7 is the same as 5 (because 7-2=5). So n must be 5.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

x ≡3 mod7: correct.
y ≡4 mod7: correct.

x²: 3²=9 → 2 mod7. Correct.
y²:4²=16 →2 mod7. Correct.
xy:3*4=12 →5 mod7. Correct.

Sum: 2+5+2=9 →2 mod7. So 2 +n ≡0 →n=5.

Looking at the options, option C is 5. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given conditions. Since \( x - 3 \) and \( y + 3 \) are multiples of 7, we have:

\[
x \equiv 3 \pmod{7}, \quad y \equiv -3 \pmod{7}.
\]

Rewriting \( y \equiv -3 \pmod{7} \) as a positive residue, we get \( y \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \).

Next, we compute \( x^2 + xy + y^2 \pmod{7} \):

1. \( x^2 \pmod{7} \):  
   Since \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \),  
   \( x^2 \equiv 3^2 = 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \).

2. \( y^2 \pmod{7} \):  
   Since \( y \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \),  
   \( y^2 \equiv 4^2 = 16 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \).

3. \( xy \pmod{7} \):  
   Since \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \) and \( y \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \),  
   \( xy \equiv 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \).

Adding these results, we find:  
\[
x^2 + xy + y^2 \equiv 2 + 5 + 2 = 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}.
\]

We need \( x^2 + xy + y^2 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \). Thus:  
\[
2 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies n \equiv -2 \pmod{7}.
\]

The smallest positive integer \( n \) satisfying this is \( n = 5 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: 5**
