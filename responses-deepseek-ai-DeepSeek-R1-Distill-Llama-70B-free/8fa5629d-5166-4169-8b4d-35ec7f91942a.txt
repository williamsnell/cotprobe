Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a furniture manufacturer who wants to find out how many end tables he produced in a week. Let's see, the question gives me different groups of employees and how many end tables each group produced. I think I need to calculate each group's total and then add them all together to get the overall production.

Alright, let's break it down. The first group has 8 employees, and each made 16 end tables. So I guess I multiply 8 by 16. Let me do that: 8 times 16 is 128. So that group made 128 end tables total.

Next, there are 21 employees who each produced 23 end tables. Hmm, 21 times 23. Let me calculate that. 20 times 23 is 460, and then plus one more 23, so 460 +23 is 483. So that's 483 from the second group.

Then, the third group is 7 employees making 27 each. So 7 multiplied by 27. Let's see, 7 times 20 is 140, and 7 times 7 is 49. Adding those together, 140 +49 equals 189. So that's 189 end tables from the third group.

Finally, the fourth group has 4 employees who each made 29 end tables. So 4 times 29. Well, 4 times 30 is 120, minus 4 gives 116. So that's 116 from the last group.

Now, I need to add all these totals together. Let's list them again: 128, 483, 189, and 116. Let me add them step by step.

First, 128 plus 483. 128 + 400 is 528, and then plus 83 is 611. So that's 611 after adding the first two groups.

Next, add 189 to 611. 611 plus 189. Let me think: 600 + 189 is 789, but wait, 611 is 600 +11. So 11 + 189 is 200. So 600 + 200 is 800. Oh wait, no, that can't be right. Let me recalculate. 611 + 189. 600+100=700, 11 +89=100. So 700+100=800. Yes, that's correct. So after adding the third group, we're at 800.

Now add the last group's 116. So 800 + 116 is 916. So the total number of end tables produced in the week is 916.

Looking at the options, option A is 916. So the answer must be A.

The total number of end tables produced is calculated by summing the production from each group of employees:

- 8 employees × 16 end tables = 128  
- 21 employees × 23 end tables = 483  
- 7 employees × 27 end tables = 189  
- 4 employees × 29 end tables = 116  

Adding these together:  
128 + 483 = 611  
611 + 189 = 800  
800 + 116 = 916  

Thus, the total production is **916 end tables**.
