Okay, so I've got this problem about Harbor Lights Boat Company loaning an employee $3,000 for a down payment on a house. They agreed to 9 and a half percent interest for the days the money was owed. The loan was made on September 16 and repaid on October 31. I need to find three things: the number of days charged, the amount of interest, and the total amount the company received.

Alright, let's tackle part a first: the number of days. September 16 to October 31. Hmm, let's count the days. September has 30 days, right? So from September 16 to September 30, that's 30 - 16 = 14 days left in September. Then, October has 31 days. But since the loan was repaid on October 31, does that day count? Wait, when you take a loan, interest is usually calculated up to but not including the payment date. Or is it including? That's a bit confusing. Let me think. If you repay on October 31, do you count that day? I think typically, the day of repayment is not counted because the loan is being paid back on that day, so the interest is up to the day before. So from September 16 to October 30.

Wait, maybe I should just count the days. September 16 to September 30 is 15 days because 16th is day 1. Wait no, wait. September 16th is the first day, right. So from the 16th to the 30th, how many days are there? Let's see: 30 minus 16 is 14, but since the 16th counts as day one, it's 15 days in September. Then, October has 31 days, but since the repayment is on October 31, we go up to October 30. So that's 30 days in October. Wait, no. From October 1 to October 30 is 30 days. So total is 15 + 30 = 45 days.

Wait, let me think again. If I have a loan from day 1 to day n, how do I count the days. For example, from Sept 16 (day 1) to Sept 30 would be 15 days because 30-16=14, plus 1. Then October 1 to October 31, but wait, the payment is on Oct 31, so does that day count? Hmm, perhaps not. So from Sept 16 to Oct 30 is 45 days? Let me calculate it another way.

September: starts on 16th. How many days after that? Let's count each day. September has 30 days. So 30 - 16 = 14, but since the 16th is included, it's 15 days in September. Then, all of October up to the 31st? Or including the 31st. Wait, but the repayment is on the 31st, so the interest would be up to the 30th. So October has 31 days, but if the loan is being paid on the 31st, the days counted would be 31 days in October? Or 30? Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, use a date calculator. From September 16 to October 31. Let me count the days. September has 30 days, so from the 16th to the end is 15 days. Then, October has 31 days, but since the payment is on the 31st, does that day count? If the loan is given on the 16th, then on the 17th, it's one day, and so on. So when it's paid on the 31st, the last day would be the 31st, so that's 31 - 16 = 15 days in September, and 31 days in October? Wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I should use the formula: number of days = (end date - start date) + 1. Or is it end date minus start date?

Wait, another approach: September has 30 days. So from September 16 to September 30 is 15 days (including the 16th and 30th). Then, from October 1 to October 31 is 31 days. But wait, the loan is repaid on October 31. So the period is from September16 to October31, inclusive. So that's 15 (Sept) + 31 (Oct) = 46 days? But wait, that can't be right because September only has 15 days after the 16th, but October has 31 days. So 15 + 31 = 46. But wait, let me count it another way. Let's use the formula: the number of days between two dates is calculated by the difference in days.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just write down the dates:

Start: September 16, 20XX.

End: October 31, 20XX.

The total days would be the number of days from Sept 16 to Oct 31, including both days. So, September: 30 days. So from 16th to 30th is 15 days. October: 31 days. So total is 15 + 31 = 46 days. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because from September 16 to October 31 is not 46 days. Let me think: from September 16 to September 30 is 15 days. Then from October 1 to October 31 is 31 days. So 15 +31=46 days. Hmm, that's 46 days. But looking at the options, option D is 46 days, option F is 45 days, etc.

Wait, but the question is about the interest 'for the number of days he owed the money.' So does that include the start date and the end date? Let me think again. For example, if you borrow on day 1 and repay on day 2, that's 1 day's interest, right? So from day 1 to day 2 is 1 day. So in this case, from September 16 to October 31 is how many days? Let me calculate:

September 16 to September 30: 15 days (including the 16th).

October 1 to October 31: 31 days.

But wait, wait, if the payment is made on October 31, then the last day of interest would be October 30. Because when you pay on the 31st, the interest is up to the 30th. So in that case, October would have 30 days of interest. So 15 (Sept) + 30 (Oct) =45 days. That makes more sense. Because if you repay on the 31st, you don't get charged for that day.

So the correct number of days is 45 days. So looking at the options for part a, the options with 45 days are options F, H, I, J. Option F says 45 days. So part a would be 45 days.

Now, part b: the amount of interest. The interest rate is 9.5% per annum, but it's calculated based on the number of days. So it's a simple interest calculation, I think, because it's for days. The formula is I = P * R * T, where T is the time in years.

So P is $3,000. R is 9.5% per year, which is 0.095. T is 45 days. But how do we convert 45 days into years? Since there are 365 days in a year, T=45/365.

So I = 3000 * 0.095 * (45/365).

Let me calculate this step by step.

First, 0.095 is 9.5%.

So 3000 * 0.095 = 285.

Then, 285 multiplied by (45/365). Let me compute 45/365 first. 45 divided by 365 is approximately 0.12328767.

So 285 * 0.12328767 ≈ Let's see, 285 * 0.12 is 34.2, and 285 * 0.00328767 is approximately 285 * 0.0033 ≈ 0.9405.

So total is approximately 34.2 + 0.9405 = 35.1405.

Wait, but wait, let me do it more accurately.

45/365 = 0.12328767.

So 285 * 0.12328767 = ?

Calculating 285 * 0.12328767.

Let me compute 285 * 0.1 = 28.5

285 * 0.02 = 5.7

285 * 0.00328767 ≈ 285 * 0.003 = 0.855, and 0.00028767*285≈0.082. So total is 0.855 +0.082≈0.937.

So adding up: 28.5 +5.7 = 34.2, plus 0.937 is 35.137.

So approximately $35.14.

Looking at the options, option F says $35.63, option I says $40.63, etc. Wait, but my calculation is about $35.14. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Compute 45 days * (9.5% / 365).

So 9.5% is 0.095. So 0.095 /365 = approximately 0.000260274.

Then, 3000 * 0.000260274 *45.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the correct formula is (P * R * T), where T is in years, which is 45/365.

So I = 3000 * 0.095 * (45/365).

Let me compute 3000 * 0.095 first: that's 285.

Then, 45/365 is approximately 0.12329.

So 285 * 0.12329 = ?

Let me compute 285 * 0.1 = 28.5

285 * 0.02 =5.7

285 * 0.00329 = approx 285 * 0.003 = 0.855; 285 * 0.00029=0.08265. So 0.855 + 0.08265=0.93765.

Adding together: 28.5 +5.7=34.2; 34.2 +0.93765=35.13765.

So approximately $35.14 in interest.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: $35.63, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the interest calculation is using 360 days a year instead of 365? Let's check.

If we use 360 days, then T is 45/360.

So 45/360 = 0.125.

So I=3000 * 0.095 * 0.125.

3000 * 0.095 = 285.

285 * 0.125= 35.625.

So that would be $35.63, which matches option F.

So perhaps in this case, they used a 360-day year for calculation. So the interest would be $35.63.

So part b is $35.63, which is option F.

Then, part c is the total amount, which is the principal plus interest: $3,000 + $35.63 = $3,035.63.

Looking at the options, option F provides 45 days, $35.63, $3,035.63. So that's option F.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

Option A: 60 days, $45.63, $3,045.63

Option B:44 days, $33.12, $3,033.12

Option C:50 days, $47.50, $3,047.50

Option D:46 days, $34.59, $3,034.59

Option E:35 days, $26.56, $3,026.56

Option F:45 days, $35.63, $3,035.63

Option G:30 days, $28.75, $3,028.75

Option H:45 days, $42.19, $3,042.19

Option I:45 days, $40.63, $3,040.63

Option J:30 days, $25.63, $3,025.63

So, F is correct for part a and b, and part c.

But wait, what about part a? Earlier I thought 45 days because from Sept 16 to October 30 is 45 days. But wait, let me recount to make sure. Let me count the days from September 16 to October 31, but I'm including only up to October 30.

September 16 to September 30: 15 days (including 16th and 30th).

October 1 to October 30: 30 days.

So 15 +30=45 days. So part a is 45 days, which matches option F.

So the correct answer is option F.
</think>

The Harbor Lights Boat Company loaned $3,000 to an employee at an annual interest rate of 9.5%, calculated based on the number of days the money was owed. The loan was made on September 16 and repaid on October 31. To determine the number of days' interest charged, the interest amount, and the total repayment amount, the following analysis applies:

### Part (a): Number of Days
The loan period is from September 16 to October 31. Since the repayment is made on October 31, interest is typically not charged for that day. Therefore, the calculation includes:
- September 16 to September 30: 15 days (including both the 16th and 30th).
- October 1 to October 30: 30 days.

Total days = 15 (September) + 30 (October) = **45 days**.

### Part (b): Interest Calculation
The interest is calculated using the simple interest formula:
\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]
Where:
- \( P = \$3,000 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 9.5\% = 0.095 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = \frac{45}{360} \) (time in years, assuming a 360-day year for calculation purposes).

Substituting the values:
\[
I = 3000 \cdot 0.095 \cdot \frac{45}{360}
\]
First, calculate \( 3000 \cdot 0.095 = 285 \). Then, \( \frac{45}{360} = 0.125 \). Finally:
\[
I = 285 \cdot 0.125 = 35.625 \, \text{(rounded to \$35.63)}.
\]

### Part (c): Total Repayment Amount
The total amount repaid on October 31 is the sum of the principal and the interest:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = \$3,000 + \$35.63 = \$3,035.63.
\]

### Final Answer
The correct option is:
**F: 45 days, \$35.63, \$3,035.63.**

F
