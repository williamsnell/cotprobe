Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this property law question, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup: A shopkeeper owns a vacant lot with fee simple absolute. In 1960, he conveys it via a general warranty deed to "my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25." 

At the time, the sister was single. Then she marries and has two sons. One son dies in a car accident. Three years later, she has a daughter. Now, they're trying to determine ownership rights, with all minors represented.

Hmm. So I need to figure out who owns the lot now.

First, I think about the type of deed and the conveyance. The shopkeeper used a general warranty deed, which usually warranties against all defects, but that might not be directly relevant to the ownership structure here. The key is in the conveyance language.

The conveyance: to the friend, but with a condition. So it's like "to A, but if X, then to B." Wait, that sounds like a conditional conveyance. So is this a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent? Or is it a remainder setup?

Wait, the language is "if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children..." That sounds like a condition subsequent. Because it's a "on condition that..." scenario. So the initial conveyance is to the friend, but if the condition occurs (used for church purposes), then it goes to the sister's children who reach 25.

So, the friend has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the sister's children have an executory interest. Because an executory interest is a future interest that cuts short another estate upon a condition.

But wait, let me make sure. The conveyance is to the friend, with a condition that if the property is ever used for church purposes, then it goes to the sister's children who reach 25. So, the friend has a fee simple, but it's subject to being divested if the condition happens.

Now, the condition is about the use of the property for church purposes. But has that happened? The question doesn't say. So, the property hasn't been used for church purposes, so the condition hasn't been triggered. So the executory interest hasn't taken effect yet.

Wait, but the question is about the current ownership. So the friend currently holds the fee simple, unless the condition has occurred. Since there's no mention of the property being used for church purposes, I think the condition hasn't been triggered, so the friend still owns it.

But wait, I'm probably missing something. The conveyance is to the friend, but upon a certain condition, it goes to the sister's children. But in the scenario, the sister's children were born after the conveyance. So, the question is about whether those children have any interest now.

Wait, the sister was single in 1960 when the conveyance happened. She later married and had two sons. Then one son died, and three years later, she had a daughter.

So, the sister's children are the two sons (one deceased) and a daughter. But when the conveyance was made, the sister didn't have any children yet. So, the class of beneficiaries (sister's children) is subject to open.

In property law, when a class is identified, like "children of A," and the class can increase (like more children can be born), the class remains open until A's death, unless there's a closing at an earlier time.

So in this case, the sister's children who reach 25. So, any child of the sister who reaches 25 would take. But right now, the sister is still alive, so she can have more children, right? Unless there's a time limit.

Wait, the condition is that the property is used for church purposes, which triggers the shift to the children who reach 25. But since that condition hasn't occurred, the executory interest hasn't vested yet.

Wait, but the executory interest is in the sister's children upon reaching 25. So, are their interests vested or contingent?

Because the condition (use for church) hasn't happened, the executory interest is still contingent. So, the sister's children's interests are contingent because the condition (use for church) hasn't occurred.

But wait, no, the executory interest is in the children upon the condition's occurrence. So, the executory interest is contingent on two things: (1) the property being used for church purposes, and (2) the sister's children reaching 25.

Wait, no, the condition is the use for church purposes. Once that happens, the property goes to the sister's children who have reached 25. So, the executory interest is in a classâ€”children of the sister who reach 25. So, each child that reaches 25 gets an interest if and when the condition occurs.

But since the condition hasn't occurred, the executory interest hasn't vested. So, the friend still holds the fee simple, subject to that condition.

Therefore, the current ownership is with the friend. Because the executory interest hasn't been triggered, and the condition hasn't occurred.

Wait, but the question is in an action to determine ownership rights. So, if the condition hasn't been triggered, the friend holds the lot, and the sister's children have a potential future interest if the condition occurs.

So, the possible ownership now is only the friend.

Looking at the options:

Option C: the friend only.

Other options involve the sister or the children, but since the condition hasn't been met, the friend holds the fee simple, and the others have only a contingent future interest, which isn't ownership yet.

So the answer should be C.

The shopkeeper conveyed the vacant lot to the friend with a condition subsequent: if the property is ever used for church purposes, it would pass to the children of the sister who reach the age of 25. This created a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent in favor of the friend and an executory interest in favor of the sister's children. 

At the time of the conveyance in 1960, the sister was single and had no children. Subsequently, she married and had two sons, one of whom died, and later had a daughter. However, the condition (use of the property for church purposes) has not been triggered, as there is no indication that the property has been used for church purposes. Therefore, the executory interest in favor of the sister's children remains contingent and has not vested.

Since the condition has not occurred, the friend retains the fee simple interest in the property, and the sister's children do not yet have a vested ownership interest. The sister herself is not granted any ownership rights in the conveyance. Thus, the current ownership of the vacant lot is held solely by the friend.

The correct answer is **C: the friend only.**

C
