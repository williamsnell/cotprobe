Okay, so I've got this problem here about krypton gas. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned about gas laws. The question says the gas is maintained at constant pressure, so that probably means I should use Charles's Law. Right, Charles's Law deals with volume and temperature when pressure is constant.

Wait, Charles's Law says that volume and temperature are directly proportional when pressure is held constant. Oh right, the formula is V1/T1 = V2/T2. But wait, I remember that temperature has to be in Kelvin for this to work. Oh yeah, because if you use Celsius, you might get negative values which don't make sense here.

So the initial volume V1 is 10.5 liters. The initial temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. I need to convert that to Kelvin. To do that, I add 273.15. So 25 + 273.15 is 298.15 K. Let me write that down as T1 = 298.15 K.

The system is heated to 250 degrees Celsius. Again, I need to convert that to Kelvin. 250 + 273.15 equals 523.15 K. So T2 is 523.15 K.

Now, the formula V1/T1 = V2/T2. I can rearrange this to solve for V2. So V2 = V1 * (T2 / T1).

Plugging in the numbers: V2 = 10.5 L * (523.15 / 298.15). Let me calculate that division. 523.15 divided by 298.15 is approximately... let's see, 523 / 298. Let me do that division. 298 times 1.75 is (298 * 1 = 298, 298 * 0.75 is 223.5, so 298 + 223.5 = 521.5). Oh wait, that's pretty close to 523. So 1.75 times 298 is about 521.5, which is just a bit less than 523. So maybe the division is about 1.754 or something.

Wait, instead of approximating, maybe I should do the exact division. Let me compute 523.15 divided by 298.15. 

Well, 298.15 * 1.75 is 298.15 * 7/4. 298.15 * 7 is 2087.05, divided by 4 is 521.7625. Hmm, but 523.15 is a bit higher. So the actual value is 1.75 plus a little more. The difference between 521.7625 and 523.15 is 1.3875. So 1.3875 / 298.15 is approximately 0.00465. So the total is about 1.75465.

Wait, maybe I can just use a calculator approach here. Alternatively, maybe the exact value isn't critical because the options are given as choices. Let me just compute 523.15 / 298.15.

Let me do this step by step. 523.15 divided by 298.15. 

Let me compute 523.15 / 298.15.

Well, 298.15 * 1.75 = 298.15 * 1 = 298.15, 298.15 * 0.75 = 223.6125. Adding them gives 298.15 + 223.6125 = 521.7625. The numerator is 523.15. So 523.15 - 521.7625 = 1.3875. So 1.3875 / 298.15 = approx 0.00465. So total is 1.75465.

So approximately 1.75465. So V2 is 10.5 L * 1.75465. Let me compute that. 10 * 1.75465 is 17.5465, 0.5 * 1.75465 is 0.8773. So total is 17.5465 + 0.8773 = 18.4238 liters. Hmm, looking at the options, D is 18.41 l, which is very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me double-check. So V1 is 10.5 L, T1 is 298.15 K, T2 is 523.15 K.

V2 = 10.5 * (523.15 / 298.15).

Let me compute 523.15 / 298.15. Another approach: perhaps 298.15 is 523.15's what fraction? 523.15 ÷ 298.15.

Let me compute 298.15 * 1.75 = 521.76. So as before. So 523.15 is a bit more. So 1.75 + (1.39 / 298.15). 1.39 / 298.15 is approximately 0.00466. So 1.75466.

So 10.5 * 1.75466. Let me compute 10 * 1.75466 = 17.5466, 0.5 * 1.75466 = 0.87733. Sum is 17.5466 + 0.87733 = 18.4239 liters, approximately 18.42 liters, which matches option D.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any alternative approach? Could the problem be using Celsius instead of Kelvin? That would be wrong, but just to check. Suppose someone forgets to convert to Kelvin.

If T1 was 25 and T2 250, then the ratio would be 250/25 = 10. So V2 would be 10.5 *10 = 105 liters. But that's not an option, so it's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe someone miscalculates the ratio. But no, the correct approach is to use Kelvin.

So yes, the correct answer is D: 18.41 l.

To solve the problem, we use Charles's Law, which states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when pressure is constant. The formula is:

\[
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
\]

Here:
- \( V_1 = 10.5 \, \text{L} \) (initial volume),
- \( T_1 = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298.15 \, \text{K} \) (initial temperature in Kelvin),
- \( T_2 = 250^\circ \text{C} = 523.15 \, \text{K} \) (final temperature in Kelvin),
- \( V_2 \) is the unknown final volume.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_2 = 10.5 \cdot \frac{523.15}{298.15}
\]

First, calculate the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{523.15}{298.15} \approx 1.75465
\]

Then, calculate \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = 10.5 \cdot 1.75465 \approx 18.4238 \, \text{L}
\]

This rounds to approximately \( 18.41 \, \text{L} \), which matches option D. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: 18.41 l**
