Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the straight-line method. I'm a bit rusty on my accounting, but let's see if I can work through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says Amazing Realty bought an office building for $13,000,000. They expect it to last 20 years and have a salvage value of $1,000,000. I need to find the annual depreciation allowance using the straight-line method.

Wait, straight-line depreciation is the simplest method, right? From what I remember, you subtract the salvage value from the cost and then divide by the useful life. That gives the annual depreciation.

So first, the formula should be:

Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life

Let me plug in the numbers. The cost is $13,000,000, and the salvage value is $1,000,000. So subtracting those gives me 12,000,000. Then divide that by the useful life of 20 years.

12,000,000 divided by 20 is ... let me do the math. 12 million divided by 20. Hmm, 12 divided by 20 is 0.6, so 0.6 million dollars. Oh wait, that's $600,000 a year.

Looking at the options, I see option I is $600,000. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Did I subtract the salvage value correctly? Yes, 13 million minus 1 million is 12 million. Divided by 20 years, yeah that's 600k per year. So I think I'm confident that I is the right choice.

The annual depreciation allowance using the straight-line method is calculated by subtracting the salvage value from the cost of the asset and then dividing by the useful life. 

Given:
- Cost = $13,000,000
- Salvage Value = $1,000,000
- Useful Life = 20 years

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}
\]

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{13,000,000 - 1,000,000}{20} = \frac{12,000,000}{20} = 600,000
\]

Thus, the annual depreciation allowance is **$600,000**, which corresponds to option **I**.

Answer: I
