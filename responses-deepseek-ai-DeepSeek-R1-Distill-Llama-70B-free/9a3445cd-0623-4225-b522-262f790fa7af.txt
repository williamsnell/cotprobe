Okay, so I've got this problem about a furnace and I need to find the maximum flame temperature and the heat supplied per cubic foot of exhaust gas. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the furnace operates with a gas inlet temp of 650°C and outlet of 1100°C. The inlet gas is 10% CO, 20% CO2, and 70% N2 by volume. It uses stoichiometric air. The data provided includes heats of formation and heat capacities for CO, O2, CO2, and N2. The combustion reaction given is 2CO(g) + O2 → 2CO2(g).

Wait, so the key here is to determine two things: the maximum flame temperature and the heat supplied. I remember that maximum flame temperature occurs when all the fuel is burned and all the energy is released. But I'm not exactly sure how to calculate that, so maybe I should start by writing out the combustion reactions.

First, I think I need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of CO with air. Oh wait, the reaction is already provided: 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. But I might need to consider the complete combustion of all the CO in the inlet gas. Since the inlet has 10% CO, I guess that's the fuel, and the rest are either products or inert (like N2).

Wait, the inlet gas is 10% CO, 20% CO2, 70% N2. So maybe the CO is the fuel, and the rest are either products (CO2) or inert (N2). But in combustion, O2 comes from air. So I need to figure out how much air is supplied and what the products are.

Since it's stoichiometric, the amount of air is exactly what's needed for complete combustion. So perhaps I should calculate the moles of each component first.

Let me think about the approach. For the maximum flame temperature, it's when the fuel is completely burned, and all the heat is released. So the process would involve calculating the heat released from the combustion reaction and then using that to find the temperature change.

But wait, the heat of reaction is involved. The standard heat of formation (ΔHf) for CO is -26,400 cal/mol, for CO2 it's -94,050 cal/mol, and I don't think O2 has a ΔHf since it's an element in its standard state. So the heat of reaction (ΔH) for the combustion of CO would be:

ΔH = [2*(-94,050)] - [2*(-26,400) + (-26,400?) Wait, no. Wait, the reaction is 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. So the products are 2 moles of CO2, and the reactants are 2 moles CO and 1 mole O2.

So, the heat of reaction is sum(products' ΔHf) - sum(reactants' ΔHf). So:

ΔH = [2*(-94,050)] - [2*(-26,400) + 0] → because O2's ΔHf is zero.

So ΔH = 2*(-94,050) - 2*(-26,400) → (-188,100) + 52,800 → -135,300 cal per 2 moles of CO burned. So per mole of CO, it's -67,650 cal/mol.

Wait, but I should confirm that. Because 2 moles of CO produce 2 moles of CO2, so the ΔH is (2*(-94,050)) - (2*(-26,400)) → yes, that's right.

So ΔH is negative, which makes sense because it's exothermic.

Now, for the maximum temperature, I think we can model this as a constant volume process where the heat released is used to raise the temperature of the products. But wait, in a bomb calorimeter, it's at constant volume, but in a furnace, it's more like constant pressure. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of enthalpy change.

Alternatively, I remember that the maximum flame temperature is calculated by considering the heat released from the combustion reaction and using the heat capacities of the products to find the temperature increase.

Wait, but the initial and final states would involve the reactants and products. So perhaps I should consider the stoichiometric combustion of the fuel (CO) with air, calculate the heat released, and then model the temperature rise of the products.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the moles of each component in the inlet gas. Let's assume a basis, perhaps 1 mole of the gas mixture. So if I take 1 mole of gas, it's 0.1 moles CO, 0.2 moles CO2, and 0.7 moles N2.

But wait, the N2 comes from both the fuel gas and the air. Wait, no, the inlet gas is the fuel gas, which is 10% CO, 20% CO2, 70% N2. So when this burns with stoichiometric air, we need to find how much O2 is required, and include the N2 from the air as well.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the combustion of the CO in the fuel gas. So for each mole of CO, I need 0.5 moles O2 (from the reaction 2CO + O2 → 2CO2). But wait, the O2 comes from the air, which is 21% O2, 79% N2.

So to find the required amount of air, I need to calculate how much O2 is needed for the CO to burn completely, then find how much N2 comes in with that air.

But the inlet gas already has some N2 (70% of 1 mole is 0.7 moles). So the total N2 in the products will be the N2 from the fuel plus the N2 from the air.

Let me structure this:

Let's take 1 mole of fuel gas as the basis.

Fuel gas composition:
CO: 0.1 mol
CO2: 0.2 mol
N2: 0.7 mol

The combustion reaction for CO is 2CO + O2 → 2CO2.

So for 0.1 mol CO, the required O2 is (0.1/2) = 0.05 mol O2.

Air is 21% O2, so the amount of air needed is (0.05 / 0.21) = approx 0.2381 mol air.

But wait, that's per mole of CO. So for 0.1 moles CO, the air required is (0.05 / 0.21) ≈ 0.2381 mol.

Wait, but air is a mixture, so 0.2381 mol of air would contain:

O2: 0.21 * 0.2381 ≈ 0.05 mol (which is exactly what's needed).

N2: 0.79 * 0.2381 ≈ 0.1881 mol.

So the total N2 in the system after combustion would be the N2 from the fuel (0.7 mol) plus the N2 from the air (0.1881 mol) → 0.8881 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. When we burn the CO, the products are CO2 and H2O, but in this case, the fuel is CO, so the products would be CO2 plus any excess O2 if the combustion isn't perfect. But since it's stoichiometric, there's no excess O2.

So, the products after combustion would be:

CO: 0 (all burned)
CO2: original 0.2 mol + 0.1*2 = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4 mol
O2: 0 (since stoichiometric)
N2: 0.7 (from fuel) + 0.1881 (from air) ≈ 0.8881 mol

Wait, but wait, the combustion of CO only produces CO2, right? So initial CO2 in fuel was 0.2 mol, and after combustion, the CO (0.1 mol) becomes 0.2 mol CO2, so total CO2 is 0.4 mol.

So the products are 0.4 mol CO2 and 0.8881 mol N2.

Now, the next step is to calculate the heat released from the combustion of CO. Then, use that heat to calculate the temperature rise of the products (CO2 and N2) from the initial temperature to the flame temperature.

Wait, but the initial temperature of the reactants is 650°C. The products will be heated to the maximum flame temperature, which I need to find.

Wait, no. Wait, the fuel and air are at their initial temperatures, but when they burn, the temperature rises. So perhaps the heat from combustion is absorbed by the products, raising their temperature.

Alternatively, the approach is to calculate the heat released by combustion (q) and set it equal to the heat absorbed by the products as their temperature increases from the initial temp (650°C) to the flame temp (T).

So, q = moles * ΔH (but ΔH is at standard conditions, 25°C or 298 K). But since the process here involves a temperature change, we might need to adjust using heat capacities.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the heat of combustion at standard conditions and then use the heat capacities to find the temperature change.

Alternatively, since the process is at constant pressure, the heat released is the enthalpy change.

Wait, let me think again. The heat released from combustion (ΔH) is the negative of the heat absorbed by the surroundings. So for the maximum temperature, the heat from combustion is used to heat up the products.

So, the heat released (q) is the enthalpy change for the combustion of CO. But wait, ΔH is per mole of reaction. So for 0.1 moles of CO burned, the heat released would be 0.1/2 * (-135300 cal) → Wait, no. Wait, the ΔH for the reaction is -135300 cal per 2 moles of CO burned. So for 0.1 moles CO, the heat released is (0.1/2)*(-135300) → No, wait, because ΔH is negative, so the heat released is positive.

Wait, let me clarify. The ΔH for the combustion of 2 moles CO is -135300 cal. So per mole, it's -67650 cal. So for 0.1 moles CO, it's 0.1 * (-67650) → -6765 cal, but since it's exothermic, it's -ve, meaning heat is released. So q = +6765 cal.

Then, this heat is absorbed by the products, which are CO2 and N2, and raises their temperature from the initial temperature (650°C) to the flame temperature T.

Wait, but the initial temp of the products is the same as the reactants, which is 650°C. So the temperature change is T - 650.

So, the heat absorbed by the products is q = sum (n * Cp * (T - T_initial)) for each product.

Wait, but I have to be careful with the signs. The heat released by combustion is positive when absorbed by the surroundings (the products). So:

q_combustion = q_products

So,

6765 cal = (n_CO2 * Cp_CO2 + n_N2 * Cp_N2) * (T - 650)

Wait, but the Cp values given are in cal/(mol·K). So I can use them directly.

Wait, but the Cp's are given as functions of T, which complicates things. Because Cp varies with temperature, so I can't just use a constant value. Hmm, that's more complex.

So the Cp's are:

CO: 6.79 + 0.98e-3 T - 0.11e5 T^-2
O2:7.16 + 1.00e-3 T - 0.40e5 T^-2
CO2:10.55 + 2.16e-3 T - 2.04e5 T^-2
N2:6.66 + 1.02e-3 T

But since we're dealing with the products, which are CO2 and N2, I'll use their Cp expressions.

But integrating Cp over the temperature change is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume an average Cp over the temperature range. But given that the maximum temperature is what we're solving for, maybe an iterative approach is needed, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the Cp values at the average temperature or to ignore the temperature dependence, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, the maximum temperatures are around 1600-1800°C, which is way higher than the initial 650°C. So the Cp's will vary significantly.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the standard approach is to use the heat of reaction at standard conditions and then calculate the adiabatic flame temperature, assuming no heat loss.

Wait, the adiabatic flame temperature is the maximum possible temperature, assuming all heat is used to heat the products. So maybe that's what is being asked here.

So, the approach would be:

1. Calculate the heat released from the combustion of CO.
2. Calculate the total moles of products (CO2 and N2).
3. Use the heat capacities of the products to find the temperature increase.

But since the Cp's are temperature-dependent, perhaps we can make an assumption or use an iterative method.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by using the heat of reaction at standard conditions and the Cp's averaged over the temperature range.

Wait, but perhaps the question expects us to use the heat of formation to find the heat released, and then use the heat capacities of the products to find the temperature rise.

Let me try to outline the steps again.

First, find the heat released from combusting the CO:

ΔH_combustion = [2*(-94,050) - (2*(-26,400))] cal → as before, ΔH = -135,300 cal per 2 moles CO → per mole CO, it's -67,650 cal.

So for 0.1 moles CO, Q = 0.1 * 67,650 = 6,765 cal.

Wait, but wait, ΔH is negative because it's exothermic, so the heat released is positive 6,765 cal.

Next, the products are 0.4 moles CO2 and 0.8881 moles N2.

Wait, but wait, the products after combustion are 0.4 CO2 and 0.8881 N2, but the initial state before combustion includes the fuel and air. Wait, but the initial state is the reactants: CO, O2 (from air), and N2 from both fuel and air.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model it as the reactants being CO, O2 (from air), and N2 (from air and fuel), and the products being CO2 and N2.

But perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think: when the fuel (CO, CO2, N2) reacts with air (O2 and N2), the CO burns, using up O2 and producing CO2, while the N2 from both fuel and air remains inert.

So the products are CO2 (from fuel's CO2 plus the CO burned) and N2 (from fuel's N2 and air's N2).

So, the moles after combustion are:

CO2: 0.2 (from fuel) + 0.1*2 (from CO burned) → 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4 mol.

N2: 0.7 (from fuel) + 0.1881 (from air) → 0.8881 mol.

O2: 0 (because stoichiometric).

So total moles of products: 0.4 + 0.8881 ≈ 1.2881 mol.

Now, the heat released (6,765 cal) is absorbed by these 1.2881 moles of gas, heating them from 650°C to T_max.

So, the equation would be:

Q = sum (n_i * ∫(T_initial to T_max) Cp_i dT )

Which is:

6,765 cal = (n_CO2 * ∫Cp_CO2 dT) + (n_N2 * ∫Cp_N2 dT )

But since Cp is a function of T, this integral would require knowing how Cp varies with T. Alternatively, perhaps we can evaluate Cp at the average temperature or assume a constant Cp over the range, but given that the temperature change is large, this might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the Cp values at the initial temperature, 650°C, which is 923 K.

Wait, but the Cp expressions are given as functions of T, so perhaps they should be evaluated at the average temperature, but since we don't know T_max yet, this complicates things.

Hmm, maybe the problem wants us to use the Cp values at the initial temperature. Let's try that.

So, for CO2 at 650°C (923 K):

Cp_CO2 = 10.55 + 2.16e-3 * T - 2.04e5 / T²

Plugging in T=923:

Cp_CO2 = 10.55 + (2.16e-3 * 923) - (2.04e5 / (923)^2 )

Calculate each term:

2.16e-3 * 923 ≈ 2.16 * 0.923 ≈ 2.00 cal/(mol·K)

2.04e5 / (923)^2 → 204000 / (853,  because 923^2 ≈ 853,000 → 204000 / 853000 ≈ 0.239 cal/(mol·K)

So Cp_CO2 ≈ 10.55 + 2.00 - 0.239 ≈ 12.31 cal/(mol·K)

Similarly, for N2 at 923 K:

Cp_N2 = 6.66 + 1.02e-3 * T → 6.66 + (1.02e-3 * 923) ≈ 6.66 + 0.941 ≈ 7.601 cal/(mol·K)

So now, the heat absorbed by the products is:

Q = n_CO2 * Cp_CO2 * (T - 650) + n_N2 * Cp_N2 * (T - 650)

Which is:

6,765 = (0.4 * 12.31 + 0.8881 * 7.601) * (T - 650)

Calculate each term:

0.4 * 12.31 ≈ 4.924

0.8881 * 7.601 ≈ 6.747

So sum ≈ 4.
