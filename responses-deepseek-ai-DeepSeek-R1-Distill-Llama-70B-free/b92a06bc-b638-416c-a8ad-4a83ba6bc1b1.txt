Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the H+ concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution. Phenol is C6H5OH, and they gave the Ka as 1 × 10^-10. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.

I remember that phenol is a weak acid, which means it doesn't completely dissociate in water. So the H+ concentration won't be as high as a strong acid. The Ka is given, which is the acid dissociation constant. I think the formula for Ka is [H+][A-]/[HA], right?

So phenol dissociates as C6H5OH ⇌ H+ + C6H5O^- . Let's call the concentration of H+ as x. Since the initial concentration of phenol is 1.0 M, at equilibrium, the concentration of phenol will decrease by x, and both H+ and C6H5O^- will increase by x. 

Wait, but since phenol is a weak acid, x should be very small compared to 1.0 M. So maybe I can approximate that 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0. That should simplify the calculations.

So plugging into the Ka expression: Ka = (x)(x)/(1.0 - x) ≈ x² / 1.0. Since Ka is 1e-10, that becomes x² = 1e-10. Taking the square root, x should be about 1e-5. So [H+] is approximately 1e-5 M.

Looking at the options, option E is 1e-5. So that's probably the right answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the approximation? Because sometimes when the Ka is very small, the approximation holds. Let's see: If x is 1e-5, then 1.0 - x is 0.99999, which is approximately 1.0. So the approximation is valid here. Yeah, I think that's correct.

Another way to think about it: If I don't approximate, the equation is x²/(1.0 - x) = 1e-10. But x is so small that 1.0 - x is practically 1.0, so solving x² = 1e-10 gives the same result.

So yeah, the H+ concentration should be 1e-5 M, which is option E.

To determine the H⁺ concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution, we start by recognizing that phenol (C₆H₅OH) is a weak acid with a given Ka of 1 × 10⁻¹⁰. The dissociation of phenol can be represented as:

\[
\text{C₆H₅OH} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{C₆H₅O⁻}.
\]

Let the concentration of H⁺ at equilibrium be \( x \). At equilibrium, the concentrations of H⁺ and C₆H₅O⁻ will both be \( x \), while the concentration of undissociated phenol will be \( 1.0 - x \). Substituting these into the Ka expression gives:

\[
K_a = \frac{[H⁺][C₆H₅O⁻]}{[C₆H₅OH]} = \frac{x^2}{1.0 - x}.
\]

Since phenol is a weak acid, \( x \) is expected to be very small compared to 1.0 M, so \( 1.0 - x \approx 1.0 \). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
K_a \approx \frac{x^2}{1.0}.
\]

Substituting \( K_a = 1 \times 10^{-10} \), we find:

\[
x^2 = 1 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{-10}} = 1 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the H⁺ concentration is \( 1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: 1 × 10⁻⁵ M.**
