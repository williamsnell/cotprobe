Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about an object being thrown horizontally from a building window. The initial speed is 20 m/s, and it hits the ground 2 seconds later. I need to find the height from which it was thrown. Oh, right, and we're supposed to neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that when objects are thrown horizontally, their horizontal and vertical motions are independent. Like, the horizontal motion doesn't affect the vertical, which is why when you drop something, it just falls straight down. So in this case, the object is thrown with a horizontal speed, but the vertical motion is determined by gravity.

So, the key thing is to find the vertical displacement here. Because the time it takes to hit the ground is given, I can use the vertical motion equations. Oh right, because the horizontal speed doesn't influence the time it takes to fall. That's why when you drop something and throw something horizontally at the same height, they hit the ground at the same time.

Alright, so the vertical motion is under constant acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration is g, which is approximately 9.8 m/s² downward. The initial vertical velocity is zero because the throw is horizontal.

I think the equation I should use here is the one for displacement under constant acceleration. The equation is: 

s = ut + (1/2) a t²

Where s is the displacement, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time. 

In this case, the initial vertical velocity u is 0. So the equation simplifies to s = (1/2) * g * t².

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The displacement s here is the height from which the object was thrown. Because it starts from that height and moves downward to the ground. So s is the height we're looking for.

So plugging the numbers in: g is 9.8 m/s², t is 2 seconds.

So s = 0.5 * 9.8 * (2)^2.

Calculating that: 2 squared is 4. 0.5 times 9.8 is 4.9. 4.9 multiplied by 4 is 19.6.

So the height should be 19.6 meters. Let me check the options. Option E is 19.6 m. So the answer is E.

Wait, but wait another second. Oh, right, the horizontal speed was given as 20 m/s. Does that affect anything? No, because the horizontal and vertical motions are independent. The time to fall depends only on the vertical motion, which is governed by gravity. So the horizontal speed is a red herring here. It doesn't change the time of fall or the height calculation.

Yep, so I'm confident the answer is E.
</think>

To determine the height from which the object was thrown, we analyze the vertical motion. Since the object is thrown horizontally, its initial vertical velocity is zero, and the vertical motion is governed solely by gravity. The horizontal velocity of 20 m/s does not affect the vertical motion due to the independence of horizontal and vertical motions.

The vertical displacement \( s \) can be calculated using the kinematic equation for constant acceleration:

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0 \) (initial vertical velocity),
- \( a = g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( t = 2.0 \, \text{s} \) (time to hit the ground).

Substituting the values:

\[
s = 0 + \frac{1}{2} (9.8) (2.0)^2
\]

\[
s = 0.5 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 4 = 19.6 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the height from which the object was thrown is 19.6 meters. The horizontal velocity does not influence this result, as it does not affect the time it takes for the object to fall vertically.

The correct answer is:

**E: 19.6 m**
