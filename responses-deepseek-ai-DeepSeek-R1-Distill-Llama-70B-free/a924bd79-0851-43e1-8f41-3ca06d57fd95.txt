Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about blood types and genetics. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a child has type AB blood and inherited an IA allele from one parent and an IB allele from the other. Then it says the child has both A and B glycoproteins on all red blood cells. And the question is asking what this pattern of expression is called.

I remember that blood types are determined by the ABO system. The A and B antigens on the red blood cells determine if someone is type A, B, AB, or O. So type A has A antigens, type B has B, AB has both, and O has neither. 

Wait, so the alleles involved here are IA, IB, and i. IA and IB are dominant over i, which is recessive. So someone with IA IA or IA i would be type A, IB IB or IB i would be type B, and IA IB would be AB.

The question is about the expression pattern where both alleles are showing. So both IA and IB are being expressed. I think that's an example of codominance. Let me recall what codominance means. Oh right, codominance is when two different alleles have an equal effect on the phenotype, so both are expressed. Like in blood type AB, both A and B are present.

Alternatively, I remember something about incomplete dominance, which is different. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotype is a blend of the two alleles. Like in snapdragons, where a red and white parent produces pink flowers. But in blood type AB, both antigens are present, not a blend. So that's more codominance than incomplete dominance.

So looking at the options, the correct term should be codominance. Let's see the options:

Option C is incomplete dominance, and E is codominance. So the answer should be E.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Another example of codominance is the AB blood type, where both A and B are expressed. Yeah, that's right. So the correct answer is E: codominance.

The question involves a child with type AB blood who inherits an IA allele from one parent and an IB allele from the other. This results in the expression of both A and B glycoproteins on the surface of all red blood cells. The term that describes this pattern of expression, where both alleles are equally expressed in the phenotype, is **codominance**.

In the ABO blood group system, IA and IB are codominant alleles, meaning neither is recessive to the other. Instead, both alleles are fully expressed, leading to the production of both A and B antigens on red blood cells. This is distinct from incomplete dominance, where a blending of traits occurs, as seen in other genetic systems like snapdragon flower color.

Analyzing the options:
- **Codominance (E)** correctly describes the equal expression of both IA and IB alleles in type AB blood.
- Other options, such as incomplete dominance (C), do not apply here because the phenotype is not a blend but rather the full expression of both alleles.

Thus, the correct answer is **E: codominance**.

Answer: E
