Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the polynomial 8x^3 +6x^2 -9x +24 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q. The options are from A to J, and I'm supposed to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the Eisenstein criterion is a way to test if a polynomial is irreducible over the rationals. The basic idea is to find a prime number p that divides all the coefficients except the leading one, and p squared doesn't divide the constant term. Then, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.

Wait, the polynomial is in Z[x], which is a polynomial with integer coefficients. So first, I should check each coefficient and see if there's a prime that divides them all except the leading term.

Let's write down the coefficients. The polynomial is 8x^3 +6x^2 -9x +24.

So the coefficients are 8, 6, -9, and 24. Oh wait, the constant term is 24.

I need a prime p that divides 6, 9, and 24, but p squared doesn't divide 24. Also, p shouldn't divide the leading coefficient, which is 8.

Wait, let's think about the primes that could divide into these numbers. Let's see:

Looking at 6, 9, 24. So the primes that divide at least one of them are 2, 3, maybe others.

Let me list the divisors:

6: 2,3

9:3

24:2,3

So possible primes are 2 and 3.

Check for p=2:

Does 2 divide 6? Yes. 9? No, because 9 is 3^2. Oh wait, 9 isn't divisible by 2. So p=2 can't work because it doesn't divide all the coefficients except the leading term.

Wait, Eisenstein requires that p divides all coefficients except the leading one. So for p=2, the coefficients are 6, -9, 24. Does 2 divide 6? Yes. 2 divide -9? No, because 9 is 3^2. So p=2 is out.

Now check p=3.

3 divides 6? Yes. 3 divides -9? Yes. 3 divides 24? Yes. So all non-leading coefficients are divisible by 3. Now, does 3 squared (9) divide the constant term, which is 24?

24 divided by 9 is 2.666..., which isn't an integer. So 9 doesn't divide 24. So that's good.

But wait, the leading coefficient is 8. Does 3 divide 8? No, because 8 is 2^3. So that's good too.

So p=3 seems to satisfy the Eisenstein criteria. Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes. Let me double-check.

Polynomial: 8x^3 +6x^2 -9x +24.

Check each coefficient except leading:

6: divisible by 3.

-9: divisible by 3.

24: divisible by 3.

Yes. And 3^2 is 9, which doesn't divide 24. So p=3 works.

So among the options, option C says Yes, with p=3.

Looking at the options, option C is correct.

But wait, let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: Yes, p=7.

B: No, but irreducible over Z.

C: Yes, p=3.

D: Yes, p=5.

E: No, reducible over Z.

F: Yes, p=6.

G: Yes, p=8.

H: Yes, p=2.

I: No.

J: Yes, p=4.

So option C is the correct answer. So the answer is C.

To determine whether the polynomial \(8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24\) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \(\mathbb{Q}\), we need to find a prime \(p\) that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and \(p^2\) does not divide the constant term. Additionally, \(p\) must not divide the leading coefficient.

The coefficients of the polynomial are \(8\), \(6\), \(-9\), and \(24\). We analyze the possible primes \(p\) that divide the non-leading coefficients (\(6\), \(-9\), and \(24\)):

1. **Prime \(p = 2\):**  
   - \(2\) divides \(6\) and \(24\), but it does not divide \(-9\) (since \(-9 = 3^2\)).  
   - Therefore, \(p = 2\) does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion.

2. **Prime \(p = 3\):**  
   - \(3\) divides \(6\), \(-9\), and \(24\).  
   - \(3^2 = 9\) does not divide the constant term \(24\) (since \(24 / 9 = 2.666\ldots\)).  
   - \(3\) does not divide the leading coefficient \(8\).  
   - Therefore, \(p = 3\) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion.

3. **Other primes (\(p = 5, 7, 8, 4, 6\)):**  
   These primes do not divide all the non-leading coefficients (\(6\), \(-9\), and \(24\)), so they cannot satisfy the Eisenstein criterion.

Since \(p = 3\) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion, the polynomial is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: Yes, with \(p = 3\).**
