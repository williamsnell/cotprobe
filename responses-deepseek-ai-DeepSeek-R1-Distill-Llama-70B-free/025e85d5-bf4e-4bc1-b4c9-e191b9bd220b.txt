Question:

During a paternity trial, the mother's attorney asks to have the baby girl, now 36 months old, exhibited for the purpose of calling attention to certain facial resemblances between the child and the reputed father. The defendant's attorney objects to the offering of the baby into evidence for comparison. The trial judge should

Options:

A: permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.
B: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would violate the child's rights.
C: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be self-serving to the complainant.
D: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.
E: permit the child to be exhibited as within the hearsay exception of pedigree.
F: not permit the child to be exhibited, as it could emotionally distress the child.
G: permit the child to be exhibited, but only under specific conditions set by the court.
H: permit the child to be exhibited, as it may provide relevant evidence to the jury.
I: not permit the child to be exhibited, as the physical resemblance is not a scientifically reliable form of evidence.
J: permit the child to be exhibited, but only if both parties agree to it.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about a paternity trial. Let me read it carefully. 

The situation is that during a paternity trial, the mother's attorney wants to have the baby girl, who's 36 months old, exhibited to show facial resemblances between the child and the reputed father. The defendant's attorney objects to this. The question is what the trial judge should do.

Hmm. I remember that in evidence law, there are rules about what can be admitted. The key here is whether the child can be presented as evidence for comparison purposes. 

So, the options are from A to J. Let me think about each possibility.

Option A says permit as non-objectionable demonstrative evidence. Demonstrative evidence is used to help the jury understand other evidence, like diagrams or models. But the child's appearance is more about physical resemblance. I'm not sure if that's considered demonstrative evidence.

Option B is about the child's rights being violated. I don't recall specific rights that would prevent a child from being shown in court for this purpose. Maybe child welfare, but I'm not sure if that's a legal bar here.

Option C says it's self-serving to the complainant. Well, all evidence presented by a party is self-serving, so that's probably not a valid objection.

Option D argues it's prejudicial to the defendant. Prejudicial evidence can sometimes be excluded, but only if it's more prejudicial than probative. Here, the resemblance might be relevant, so maybe the judge wouldn't exclude it on those grounds.

Option E mentions hearsay exception of pedigree. Pedigree usually refers to evidence about a person's ancestry, like birth or marriage records. I don't think facial resemblance falls under that.

Option F is about emotional distress to the child. Courts do consider the welfare of children, but in this case, if the child is just being shown, maybe it's not too distressing. Unless the child is being questioned or something. But the question doesn't say that; it's just being exhibited.

Option G says permit but under specific conditions. That could be possible, but I'm not sure if courts usually impose conditions for this kind of evidence.

Option H says permit because it's relevant. Physical resemblance can be relevant evidence in paternity cases, so the judge might allow it as it's probative.

Option I argues it's not scientifically reliable. Well, physical resemblance is more of a lay observation. It's not DNA evidence, but it's still something juries might consider. So maybe it's admissible even if not scientifically proven.

Option J says permit only if both parties agree. I don't think the rules require consent from both parties for evidence presentation. The judge decides admissibility based on rules, not party agreement.

Wait, I'm trying to remember any specific cases or rules. I think that physical appearance and resemblance have been allowed as evidence in some cases. Like, in some trials, the court allows the jury to compare features. So the judge would likely permit it because it's relevant and not necessarily inadmissible.

So looking back, option H says permit as it may provide relevant evidence. That sounds right. The trial judge should allow it because the resemblance is relevant to the issue of paternity.

The question revolves around whether a trial judge should permit a 36-month-old child to be exhibited in court to highlight facial resemblances with the reputed father during a paternity trial. The defendant's attorney objects, and the judge must decide based on the admissibility of such evidence.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Demonstrative evidence is typically used to clarify other evidence, but the child's appearance is more about physical resemblance, making this less applicable.
- **Option B**: There is no clear legal basis for arguing that exhibiting the child violates its rights in this context.
- **Option C**: All evidence presented by a party is inherently self-serving, so this is not a valid objection.
- **Option D**: While prejudicial evidence can be excluded, the probative value of physical resemblance in a paternity case likely outweighs its prejudicial impact.
- **Option E**: Facial resemblance does not fall under the hearsay exception for pedigree, which pertains to ancestry or lineage.
- **Option F**: The question does not suggest the child would be emotionally distressed, and courts often prioritize the probative value of evidence.
- **Option G**: Imposing specific conditions is possible but not typically required for this type of evidence.
- **Option H**: Physical resemblance is relevant in paternity cases and can be admitted as evidence, even if not scientifically proven.
- **Option I**: While not scientifically reliable, lay observations of resemblance are still admissible as relevant evidence.
- **Option J**: Evidence admissibility is determined by legal standards, not by whether both parties agree.

The most appropriate decision is that the judge should permit the child to be exhibited because the facial resemblance is relevant to the paternity issue. Therefore, the correct answer is:
