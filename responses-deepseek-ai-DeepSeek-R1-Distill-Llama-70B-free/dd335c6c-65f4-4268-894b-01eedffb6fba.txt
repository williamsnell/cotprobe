Okay, so I need to figure out which situation would make family therapy contraindicated. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that family therapy is usually helpful when the family can work together and when the issues are related to their interactions. But there are some cases where it might not be the best approach.

Looking at the options:

A: Severe depression in a family member. I think family therapy can still be useful here because it can support the depressed individual and help the family understand and cope better. Unless the depression is so severe that the person needs individual therapy first, but the question is about contraindication, not just when it might not be the first choice.

B: Family dealing with loss. Family therapy can help them grieve together and support each other, so this seems appropriate, not contraindicated.

C: Family attributes problems to one member. Hmm, this might be tricky. If the family is blaming one person, like maybe a child who's acting out, family therapy could address this by exploring how the family dynamics contribute to the issue. But wait, if they're too focused on blaming one person, maybe they're not ready to take responsibility collectively. Could this resistance make family therapy less effective or even harmful? Maybe in some cases, but I'm not sure if it's a contraindication.

D: Sibling rivalry. That seems like a classic issue for family therapy since it's about the interactions between siblings. So this isn't contraindicated.

E: Recently moved to a new city. Maybe the family is under stress from the move, and family therapy can help them adjust. I don't see this as a reason to avoid it.

F: Financial stress. Financial issues can affect family dynamics, and therapy might help them cope together. So not a contraindication.

G: Long-term marital conflict. Family therapy can address this, especially if it's affecting the whole family. But wait, if the marital conflict is severe and perhaps the couple is on the verge of divorce, maybe individual or couples therapy would be better. But the question is about family therapy in general. I'm not sure if this is contraindicated.

Wait, going back. The question is which situation is probably contraindicated. So when would family therapy not be appropriate?

I recall that family therapy might not be suitable if the family is in a situation where they can't function as a unit. For example, if there's a lot of blaming, or if one member is being scapegoated. Option C says family members attribute their problems to one member. That sounds like they're scapegoating. In such cases, the family might not be willing to look at their own roles in the problems, making therapy ineffective or even causing more harm by reinforcing the blame.

Alternatively, if one member has severe mental health issues, like severe depression (option A), family therapy might not be the best first step. For severe depression, individual therapy might be more appropriate initially. But the question is about contraindication, not just when another approach is better.

So, between A and C. Which is more likely to be contraindicated.

I think family therapy can be done alongside individual therapy for depression. But if the family is stuck in a blaming pattern (option C), family therapy could be counterproductive because they might not engage properly and might even escalate the situation by blaming the identified member more.

Another thought: if the family attributes their problems to one member, they might not be open to exploring their own contributions. This could lead to resistance and make therapy less effective, possibly even harmful if the scapegoated member feels attacked.

So, the contraindicated situation is likely option C.

Family therapy is generally effective when the family can work together and the issues are related to their interactions. However, certain situations may make family therapy contraindicated. 

- **Option A**: Severe depression in a family member does not necessarily contraindicate family therapy, as it can still support the individual and help the family cope. Individual therapy might be needed first, but this is not a strict contraindication.  
- **Option B**: Family therapy can help members dealing with loss by providing a space to grieve and support each other, so this is not contraindicated.  
- **Option C**: When family members attribute their problems to one member, it indicates scapegoating. This can make family therapy ineffective or even harmful, as the family may resist exploring their collective roles in the issues, potentially escalating blame on the scapegoated member. This is a strong candidate for contraindication.  
- **Option D**: Sibling rivalry is a common issue addressed in family therapy, so this is not contraindicated.  
- **Option E**: A recent move to a new city may cause stress, but family therapy can help the family adjust, so this is not contraindicated.  
- **Option F**: Financial stress can affect family dynamics, and therapy can help them cope, so this is not contraindicated.  
- **Option G**: Long-term marital conflict can be addressed in family therapy, though individual or couples therapy might sometimes be more appropriate. This is not strictly contraindicated.  

The most likely contraindication is **Option C**, as scapegoating can hinder the effectiveness of family therapy and potentially harm the scapegoated member.
