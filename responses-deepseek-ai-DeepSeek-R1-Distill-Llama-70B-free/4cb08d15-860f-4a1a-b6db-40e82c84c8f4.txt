Question:

A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician after her mother learned that she began having sexual intercourse with various partners 1 month ago. She does not use condoms or other contraception.

She had been an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership positions at school before the separation. Since the separation, however, she has become sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She has begun smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and being truant from school. This patient is most likely using which of the following defense mechanisms?

Options:

A: Acting out
B: Intellectualization
C: Projection
D: Regression
E: Displacement
F: Rationalization
G: Denial
H: Repression
I: Sublimation
J: Reaction formation

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 14-year-old girl and her behavior changes. I'm a bit new to psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, defense mechanisms are ways people cope with stress, anxiety, or other uncomfortable emotions. They're usually unconscious processes. The question gives a scenario where the girl started having sex with multiple partners, not using condoms, and her behavior changed after her parents separated.

Before the separation, she was an honor student, into sports, leadership—so she was doing well. But after her parents split, she became sullen, defiant, rebellious. She started smoking, disobeying curfew, truancy. So she's acting out in these negative ways.

The question is asking which defense mechanism she's using. The options are from A to J, each a different defense mechanism.

I think I need to match her behavior to the correct defense. Let me recall each one:

Acting out: This is when someone acts on their unconscious thoughts or feelings instead of talking about them. Instead of dealing with emotions, they express them through actions, often harmful.

Intellectualization: This is when someone uses reason and logic to avoid dealing with the stress of emotions. Like, over-analyzing to detach from feelings.

Projection: Attributing one's own unacceptable desires or feelings to someone else. For example, accusing someone else of being angry when you're the one who's angry.

Regression: Going back to an earlier stage of development when under stress. Like an adult acting childishly.

Displacement: Redirecting emotions from the original source to a safer target. Like yelling at a friend when you're really mad at your boss.

Rationalization: Creating logical explanations to justify unacceptable behavior. Making excuses.

Denial: Refusing to accept reality to avoid dealing with it. Like someone denying they have an illness when they know they do.

Repression: Pushing uncomfortable thoughts or memories into the unconscious mind.

Sublimation: Channeling unacceptable impulses into more socially acceptable behaviors. Like an aggressive person taking up boxing.

Reaction formation: Acting in a way that's opposite to one's true feelings. Like someone who's angry being overly nice.

So the girl's behavior includes having unsafe sex, smoking, being defiant, truant. These are all actions rather than internal thoughts. She's not talking about her feelings but instead engaging in risky or rebellious behavior.

Acting out seems to fit because she's expressing her emotional distress through actions. She's not dealing with the stress of her parents' separation in a healthy way—she's instead acting on her feelings, maybe as a way to cope with the emotional pain.

Wait, could it be displacement? No, because displacement is redirecting emotions to another target. But here, she's acting directly, not redirecting.

Regression? Maybe, but regression is about reverting to an earlier developmental stage. She's behaving in ways that are more rebellious, not childlike, like throwing tantrums or something.

So, yeah, acting out makes the most sense. She's using acting out as a defense mechanism by engaging in these risky behaviors instead of dealing with her emotions about her parents' separation.
</think>

The 14-year-old girl in the scenario exhibits behavior changes after her parents' separation, including risky sexual activity, smoking, defiance, and truancy. These actions suggest she is coping with emotional distress through harmful behaviors rather than addressing her feelings directly. This aligns with the defense mechanism of "acting out," where unconscious emotions are expressed through actions rather than being processed or discussed.

The other options, such as displacement, regression, or reaction formation, do not fit as well. Displacement involves redirecting emotions to a different target, which is not evident here. Regression involves reverting to an earlier developmental stage, which her behavior does not indicate. Reaction formation would involve acting in opposition to her true feelings, which also does not match her actions.

Thus, the most appropriate defense mechanism is **acting out**.
