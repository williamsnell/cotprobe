Okay, so I've got this problem here about Douglas, Inc. receiving a note and then discounting it. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the note is received on April 1st. It's a 6% note with a 90-day term for $800. Then, on May 1st, they discounted it at 6%. I need to find out how much Douglas actually received after discounting. 

Wait, so what's a note in this context? I think a note is like a loan where the borrower promises to pay the lender the face value plus interest. So here, the face value is $800, and the interest rate is 6% per annum, right?

Now, the term is 90 days. But wait, the note was held for how many days before being discounted? Because the note was received on April 1, and then on May 1, which is 30 days later, right? April has 30 days, so from April 1 to May 1 is exactly one month, so 30 days.

Wait, but the note's term is 90 days. So the note is due 90 days from April 1, which would be June 30th, I think. But the discounting happens on May 1, so they're selling it before it's due. So they hold it for 30 days and then discount it.

So the question is about discounting a note. I remember that discounting a note means the holder sells the note to someone else (like a bank) before its maturity date. The amount they get is the present value, calculated by subtracting the discount from the face value.

The formula for the discount is: Discount = Face Value × Rate × Time. But wait, time here has to be in years, right? So the time here is from May 1 to the due date, which is June 30. Let's see, May has 31 days, so from May 1 to June 30 is 60 days, right? Wait, no, May 1 to May 31 is 31 days, but the note is due on June 30. So from May 1 to June 30 is 60 days (31 in May and 30 in June—wait no, May 1 to June 1 is 31 days, and then another 30 days to June 30? No, wait, May has 31 days, so from May 1 to June 1 is 31 days, and then from June 1 to 30 is 29 more days. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term was 90 days from April 1, the due date is July 1? Wait no, April has 30 days, so 90 days from April 1 would be July 1? Let me count: April 1 +30 days is May 1, + another 30 is June 1, + another 30 is July 1. Oh right, so the note is due on July 1. So when they discount it on May 1, the remaining time is 61 days? Because May 1 to July 1 is 61 days (May has 31, June has 30, so 31-1=30 in May, then 30 in June, then 1 in July? Wait, no. From May 1 to July 1 is 61 days: May has 31 days (including the 1st?), so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days, then June 1 to June 30 is 30 days, totaling 61 days until July 1.

So the time remaining is 61 days. To convert that into years, I divide by 365. So 61/365 ≈ 0.167123 years.

The discount rate is 6%, so the discount amount is 800 * 0.06 * (61/365). Let me calculate that: 800 * 0.06 = 48. 48 * (61/365). Let's see, 61 divided by 365 is approximately 0.16712. So 48 * 0.16712 ≈ 8.012. So the discount is about $8.01.

So the present value that Douglas gets is the face value minus the discount: 800 - 8.01 = $791.99. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest one is option A: $790, but that's not exact. Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me recalculate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating. Let's compute 61/365 exactly. 61 ÷ 365 is 0.167123... So 0.06 * 800 is 48. Multiply 48 by 0.167123: 48 * 0.167123 ≈ 8.012. So 800 - 8.012 is 791.988, which is approximately $792. But none of the options is exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are: A: $790, B: $808.12, C: $784.16, D: $803.88, E: $815.22, F: $795.67, G: $812, H: $785.50, I: $820.30, J: $800.

So none of the options is $792, but perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Wait, another approach: when discounting, sometimes the interest is calculated as (rate × time in years). But wait, the discounting rate is given as 6%. Is that the same as the note's interest rate? Or is it a different rate?

Wait, the note has a 6% rate. So when they discount it, the discount rate is also 6%? Or is that a different rate? Hmm, the problem says the note was discounted at 6%. So the discount rate is 6% per annum.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the time should be from May 1 to the maturity date, which is 61 days, as I thought. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but maybe the time is 90 days minus the 30 days that have passed. So 60 days remaining. Let's see: from April 1 to May 1 is 30 days, so time remaining is 60 days. So 60/365 is approximately 0.16438 years.

So discount would be 800 * 0.06 * (60/365) = 800 * 0.06 * 0.16438 ≈ 800 * 0.0098628 ≈ 7.89024. So discount is about $7.89. So present value is 800 -7.89=792.11.

Still, none of the options are that. So perhaps I'm missing something else. 

Wait, maybe the discount is calculated using the simple interest formula, and the present value is face value minus discount.

Alternatively, perhaps the note is being discounted for the period from May 1 to July 1, which is 61 days. So the formula is:

Discount = 800 * 6% * (61/365)

Let me compute this more accurately.

61/365 = 0.16712328767

So 800 * 0.06 = 48. Then, 48 * 0.16712328767 ≈ 8.012.

So present value is 800 -8.012 = $791.988, approximately $792. But the options don't have $792.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the interest is calculated using bank discount method, which is (face value × rate × time). So the discount is 800 * 0.06 * (61/365) = 8.012. So the proceeds are 800 - 8.012 = 791.988, which is approximately $792. But the options don't have that. Maybe I need to check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is $795.67, which is higher than my calculation. Option H is $785.50, which is lower. Hmm, maybe I did the days wrong.

Wait, maybe the term is 90 days, so the due date is July 1. So from May 1 to July 1 is 61 days, correct. So time is 61/365. So maybe the calculation is correct, but perhaps the problem considers the interest as 6% per annum, but the discounting is done at a different rate. Wait, no, the problem says the note was discounted at 6%.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interest is calculated as 6% for 90 days, and since they held it for 30 days, the discount is for the remaining 60 days.

Wait, the note's total interest is 6% for 90 days. So the annual rate is 6%, but for 90 days, which is a quarter of a year, the interest would be 6% * (90/365) ≈ 1.479% of the face value. So total interest is 800 * 0.01479 ≈ $11.84.

So the note would have a maturity value of 800 + 11.84 = $811.84. But if they discount it on May 1, which is 30 days after issuance, the time remaining is 60 days. So the discount would be based on the remaining 60 days.

So the discount rate is 6% per annum. So the discount is 800 * 0.06 * (60/365) = 800 * 0.06 * 0.16438 ≈ 7.89. So the proceeds would be 800 -7.89 = $792.11.

But again, the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is considering that the note is a 90-day note, so the interest is calculated as 6% of the face value, and that the discounting is done at the same rate.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the note's interest is calculated as simple interest, and when discounted, the present value is calculated using the same rate.

Let me think differently. The note's maturity value is $800 plus interest. The interest is 6% for 90 days, which is 800 * 0.06 * (90/365) = 800 * 0.06 * 0.24658 ≈ 800 * 0.01475 ≈ $11.80. So maturity value is $811.80.

But when they discount it on May 1, the remaining time is 60 days (from May 1 to July 1 is 61 days, but perhaps it's 60). So the discount is calculated on the present value.

Wait, no, discounting is about calculating the present value of the maturity amount. So the maturity amount is $811.80, and it's being discounted back to May 1 at 6% annual rate.

So the present value would be 811.80 / (1 + 0.06*(60/365)).

Wait, but that's if it's using compound interest, but usually, discounting is done with simple interest. So perhaps the discount is calculated as maturity value minus (maturity value × rate × time).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try the present value approach. The present value (PV) is equal to the maturity value (FV) divided by (1 + rt), where r is the discount rate and t is time in years.

But if it's simple interest, the discount is FV × r × t, so PV = FV - (FV × r × t) = FV × (1 - r × t).

So FV is $811.80. The remaining time is 60 days, so t = 60/365 ≈ 0.16438.

So the discount is 811.80 × 0.06 × 0.16438 ≈ 811.80 × 0.0098628 ≈ 8.01. So PV = 811.80 -8.01 ≈ 803.79.

Wait, but that's about $803.79, which is close to option D: $803.88.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

FV is 800 * (1 + 0.06*(90/365)).

Wait, 90/365 is 0.246575. So 0.06 * 0.246575 = 0.0147945. So FV = 800 * 1.0147945 = 800 * 1.0147945 = 811.8356.

Then, discounting this amount from July 1 back to May 1, which is 60 days (since from May 1 to July 1 is 61 days? Wait, May 1 to June 1 is 31 days, June has 30, so May 1 to July 1 is 61 days. So time is 61/365.

So discount is 811.8356 * 0.06 * (61/365).

Compute 61/365 = 0.167123.

So 0.06 * 0.167123 = 0.010002.

So discount is 811.8356 * 0.010002 ≈ 8.12 (exactly, 811.8356 * 0.010002 = approx 8.12).

So PV = 811.8356 - 8.12 ≈ 803.7156, which is about $803.72. Looking at the options, D is $803.88, which is very close. So I think that's the correct approach.

So the correct answer would be D: $803.88.

Wait, but why did I get a slightly different number? Maybe because of more precise calculation.

Let me compute it more accurately.

FV = 800 * (1 + 0.06*(90/365)).

90/365 = 0.246575.

0.06 * 0.246575 = 0.0147945.

So FV = 800 * 1.0147945 = 800 * 1.0147945 = let's compute 800 * 1.0147945.

1.0147945 * 800: 800 *1 =800, 800*0.0147945=11.8156. So FV=811.8156.

Now, discount this FV back 61 days at 6%. So discount is FV * rate * time.

Time is 61/365 = 0.167123.

Discount = 811.8156 * 0.06 * 0.167123.

Calculate 0.06 * 0.167123 = 0.01000238.

Then, 811.8156 * 0.01000238 ≈ Let's compute:

811.8156 * 0.01 = 8.118156.

811.8156 * 0.00000238 ≈ approximately 0.001935.

So total discount ≈ 8.118156 + 0.001935 ≈ 8.120091.

So PV = FV - discount = 811.8156 -8.120091 ≈ 803.6955.

So approximately $803.70. The closest option is D: $803.88, but it's a bit off. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe the initial approach was incorrect. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is simpler.

The note is dated April 1, face value $800, 90 days, 6% interest. On May 1, it's discounted at 6%. So the time from April 1 to May 1 is 30 days. So the remaining time is 60 days.

So the interest that would be earned from May 1 to July 1 is 6% * (60/365) * 800.

Compute that: 0.06 * (60/365) * 800.

60/365 = 0.164383.

0.06 * 0.164383 = 0.00986298.

Multiply by 800: 0.00986298 *800 = 7.89037.

So the interest from May 1 to July 1 is $7.89.

Therefore, the present value on May 1 is the face value minus the interest: 800 -7.89037 ≈ 792.1096.

But that's about $792.11, which doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated on the face value, not considering the interest that has already accrued.

Wait, but the note was received on April 1, and on May 1, it's being discounted. So from April 1 to May 1, 30 days have passed. So the interest accrued during those 30 days would be 800 * 0.06 * (30/365) = 800 * 0.06 * 0.0821918 ≈ 800 * 0.0049231 ≈ $3.9385.

So the maturity value as of May 1 would be 800 + 3.9385 = $803.9385.

Now, from May 1 to the due date, there's 60 days left. So the discount is calculated on the $803.9385 at 6% for 60 days.

So discount = 803.9385 * 0.06 * (60/365).

Compute 60/365 = 0.164383.

0.06 * 0.164383 = 0.00986298.

So discount = 803.9385 * 0.00986298 ≈ Let's compute:

800 * 0.00986298 = 7.89038.

3.9385 * 0.00986298 ≈ 0.03883.

So total discount ≈7.89038 + 0.03883 ≈7.9292.

So present value = 803.9385 -7.9292≈ 795.0093.

Hmm, that's about $795.01, which is close to option F: $795.67, but not exact. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The note is a 90-day, 6% note for $800. On May 1, which is 30 days later, it's discounted at 6%. So the unexpired term is 60 days. So the discount is calculated as 800 * 6% * (60/365).

So discount = 800 * 0.06 * (60/365) = 800 *0.06 *0.164383 = 800 *0.00986298 = 7.890.

So the proceeds are 800 -7.890 = 792.11, which is approximately $792.11, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated on the maturity value including interest. So first, compute the interest accrued from April 1 to May 1, which is 30 days. That's 800 * 0.06 * (30/365) = 800 * 0.06 * 0.0821918 ≈3
