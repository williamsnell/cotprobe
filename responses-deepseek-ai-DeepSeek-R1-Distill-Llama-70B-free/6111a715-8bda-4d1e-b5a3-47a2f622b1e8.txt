Question:

Two weeks before an election, a local newspaper published an article implying that one of the mayoral candidates was a thief. The candidate subsequently lost the election and sued the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper defended on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate took the stand and testified that he was not a thief. Thereafter, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. Upon objection by the candidate's attorney, the witness's testimony should be

Options:

A: excluded, as it can potentially bias the jury.
B: excluded, because it is hearsay evidence.
C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.
D: excluded, because it is improper character evidence.
E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.
F: excluded, because the act was committed too long ago to be relevant.
G: admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.
H: admitted, as it is relevant to the candidate's credibility.
I: admitted, but only if the witness can provide conclusive proof of the larceny.
J: excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with defamation and character evidence. Hmm, let's break it down.

The situation is a defamation case. A newspaper published an article implying a mayoral candidate was a thief, and he lost the election because of it. The candidate sued for defamation, and the newspaper is defending by claiming the statement was true. 

At trial, the candidate testified that he wasn't a thief. Then the newspaper called a witness to say that three years ago, the candidate committed larceny at his former job. The candidate's attorney objected, and now we need to decide if that testimony should be admitted or not.

The options are A through J. Let me think through the rules of evidence here.

First, defamation cases: The plaintiff's reputation is at issue, so the defendant can introduce evidence to prove the truth of the allegedly defamatory statement. So if the newspaper is claiming the statement was true (that he's a thief), they can present evidence that he actually is a thief.

But wait, how does that evidence come in? The issue is about the admissibility of the witness's testimony about a past larceny. 

I remember that when a person's character is at issue, specific instances of conduct can be used. But in this case, the candidate's character is definitely in question because the defamation is about him being a thief. So, under FRE 405, which deals with methods of proving character, when character is an essential element of a claim or defense, specific instances can be proved by testimony about the person's reputation or specific instances of conduct.

In this case, since truth is the defense, and the candidate's character (as a thief) is central, the newspaper should be allowed to introduce specific acts. So the witness's testimony about the larceny three years ago would be relevant.

Wait, but there's another angle. FRE 608 deals with specific instances of conduct to attack a witness's character for truthfulness. But that's about credibility, not about the underlying issue of whether the person is a thief. 

In this scenario, the candidate took the stand and testified he wasn't a thief. So the newspaper is trying to contradict that. But if the newspaper's witness is talking about a past bad act, it might be used to show that the candidate is a thief, which goes to the heart of the defamation defense.

Wait, but another point: the prior bad act might be too remote in time. Three years agoâ€”could that be too long? I'm not sure. The general rule is that there's no specific time limit, but the court might exclude it if it's too remote. But unless there's evidence that the act was too old, I don't think that's the main issue here.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: Excluded because it can potentially bias the jury. Well, all such evidence might bias the jury, but that's not a reason to exclude it. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Excluded as hearsay. The witness is testifying about what they saw or knew, so it's not hearsay if it's first-hand knowledge. Unless the witness is recounting what someone else said, which isn't indicated here. So B is probably not the right reason.

Option C: Admitted as it supports the truth defense. That sounds plausible because the newspaper is defending on truth, so showing he committed larceny would support that.

Option D: Excluded as improper character evidence. But in defamation cases where character is at issue, it's proper. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief. That seems correct because the newspaper is allowed to prove truth by specific instances when character is in issue.

Option F: Excluded because the act was too long ago. I'm not sure about this. Three years doesn't seem that old, especially if it's relevant to his character. Unless the court finds it too remote, but I don't think that's the main issue here.

Option G: Admitted as probative of his veracity. Wait, but the testimony is about larceny, not about lying. So it's about his being a thief, not about his truthfulness as a witness. So G might not be correct.

Option H: Admitted as relevant to credibility. Again, credibility is about truthfulness, not about being a thief. So H might not apply here.

Option I: Admitted only if the witness can provide conclusive proof. I don't think the evidence needs to be conclusive. It just needs to be relevant and admissible. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Excluded because bad acts can't be proved by extrinsic evidence. Wait, extrinsic evidence refers to evidence outside the record, like bringing in documents or other witnesses beyond what's testified. But in this case, the witness is testifying directly about the candidate's past act. So J is probably incorrect.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up something. When a witness is on the stand, if you want to impeach their credibility with specific acts, you can only do it on cross-examination, not by extrinsic evidence. But in this case, the newspaper is not impeaching the candidate's credibility as a witness; they're trying to prove that he's a thief, which is part of their defense. So the testimony is about a specific act to prove he's a thief, which is a substantive part of their case, not just impeachment.

So the key here is that in a defamation case where truth is a defense, the defendant can introduce specific instances of the plaintiff's conduct to prove they are what the statement said (here, a thief). So the witness's testimony about the larceny should be admissible.

Looking again at the options, option C says admitted as supports truth defense. Option E says admitted as relevant evidence of his character. Both seem plausible.

Wait, but under FRE 405(a), when character is an essential element of a claim or defense, proof may be by specific instances. So in this case, the defendant's defense is that the statement was true, which requires proving the plaintiff is a thief. So the specific instance is admissible.

But wait, the candidate testified that he wasn't a thief. So the newspaper is offering extrinsic evidence (another witness's testimony) to contradict him. But in general, extrinsic evidence to prove specific acts is allowed when character is in issue. Because in cases where character is an essential element, you can prove it by specific instances, not just reputation or opinion.

So the newspaper's witness's testimony should be admitted as substantive evidence to prove the candidate is a thief, supporting their truth defense.

Looking at the options, option C says admitted as it supports the defense of truth. Option E says admitted as relevant evidence of his character as a thief. So both C and E seem correct, but I think the correct answer is E.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The primary purpose here is to prove the truth of the statement, which is that he's a thief. The newspaper is offering this evidence to show that the statement was true, so it's substantive evidence, not just character evidence. So option C is about supporting the truth defense, which is exactly what's happening.

Alternatively, option E says it's admitted as evidence of his character as a thief, which is also correct because his character is at issue. But I think the more precise reason is that it's being used to prove the truth, which is the defense. So option C would be correct.

Wait, but in a defamation case, when the plaintiff's character is at issue, the defendant can use specific acts to prove truth. So the evidence is admissible both as substantive evidence to prove truth and as character evidence.

Looking back at the options, option C is about supporting the truth defense, which is correct. Option E is about character evidence. Both could be correct, but which one is the better answer.

The question is about whether the testimony should be admitted. So the reason is that it's relevant to prove the truth, which is the defense. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but another thought: the candidate's character is in issue because the case is about whether he's a thief. So under FRE 405(a), when character is an essential element (as in a defamation case where the defense is truth), specific instances are admissible. So the testimony is about a specific instance to prove his character as a thief, which is an essential element. So option E would be correct as it's about character evidence.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: in a defamation case where the defendant's defense is truth, the plaintiff's character (as a thief) is an essential element of the defense. Therefore, specific acts can be used to prove it. So the witness's testimony is about a specific act (larceny) to prove that the plaintiff is a thief, which supports the truth defense. So both C and E could apply, but the precise rule is under FRE 405(a), which allows specific instances when character is an essential element.

So the testimony is admissible as evidence of the candidate's character (thief), making option E correct.

Wait, but the options are a bit nuanced. Option C says it supports the defense of truth. Option E says it's relevant evidence of his character as a thief. So both are correct, but which one is the legally accurate reason?

I think the correct answer is E because the evidence is being admitted as character evidence, which is allowed under FRE 405 when character is an essential element. So the reason it's admitted is because it's relevant to his character, which is in issue.

Alternatively, some might think that because it's being used to prove truth, it's not about character evidence but about the fact that he committed the act. But in legal terms, when you're allowed to prove character with specific acts, it's because character is in issue.

Wait, but another angle: the candidate's testimony that he's not a thief opens the door to rebuttal. The newspaper can bring in evidence to show that he is a thief, which would be extrinsic evidence. Normally, extrinsic evidence is not allowed to impeach a witness's character for truthfulness, except in specific cases. But here, it's not about impeachment of credibility, it's about proving the substantive issue of whether he's a thief. So that's a different context.

So under FRE 405(a), when character is an essential element, specific acts are allowed. So the testimony should be admitted as evidence of his character, making option E correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the rules again mentally. In a case where a person's character is at issue (like in defamation), the opposing party can offer evidence of specific acts to prove their character. So the newspaper can bring in this witness to testify about the larceny to show that the candidate is a thief, which supports their defense that the statement was true.

So the reason the testimony is admissible is because it's relevant to the candidate's character, which is at issue in the case. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

But wait, another thought: option J says excluded because bad acts can't be proved by extrinsic evidence. But extrinsic evidence here refers to evidence outside of the witness's own testimony. Wait, no, in the context of impeachment, extrinsic evidence isn't allowed. But in this case, the newspaper is using extrinsic evidence (another witness) to prove a specific act, which is substantive evidence, not impeachment.

So J is incorrect because it's about impeachment, not about using extrinsic evidence for substantive purposes. So J isn't the right reason.

Putting it all together, the witness's testimony is admissible as evidence of the candidate's character because his character is at issue in the defamation case. Therefore, the answer should be E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence in a defamation case where the defendant (a newspaper) claims the allegedly defamatory statement was true. The plaintiff (a mayoral candidate) testified that he was not a thief, and the newspaper sought to introduce testimony from a witness about a larceny the candidate allegedly committed three years earlier. The issue is whether this testimony should be admitted.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Suggests the testimony should be excluded because it could bias the jury. However, the potential to bias the jury is not a valid reason for exclusion. All relevant evidence has the potential to influence the jury, and this does not make it inadmissible. **Incorrect**.

2. **Option B**: Claims the testimony is hearsay. This is incorrect because the witness is testifying about their personal knowledge of the candidate's alleged larceny, not repeating someone else's statement. **Incorrect**.

3. **Option C**: States the testimony should be admitted because it supports the newspaper's defense of truth. This is plausible because the newspaper's defense hinges on proving the statement was true, and the testimony directly supports that claim. **Plausible but not the best answer**.

4. **Option D**: Argues the testimony should be excluded as improper character evidence. This is incorrect because, in defamation cases, the plaintiff's character is inherently at issue, and specific acts of conduct are admissible to prove character under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 405(a). **Incorrect**.

5. **Option E**: Suggests the testimony should be admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief. This aligns with FRE 405(a), which allows specific instances of conduct to prove character when character is an essential element of a claim or defense. Since the newspaper's defense of truth requires proving the candidate is a thief, this testimony is admissible as character evidence. **Correct**.

6. **Option F**: Claims the testimony should be excluded because the act occurred too long ago. While temporal remoteness can sometimes make evidence irrelevant, three years is not an unreasonable timeframe, and the testimony remains relevant to the candidate's character. **Incorrect**.

7. **Option G**: Argues the testimony should be admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity. This is incorrect because the testimony pertains to the candidate's character as a thief, not his truthfulness as a witness. **Incorrect**.

8. **Option H**: Suggests the testimony should be admitted as relevant to the candidate's credibility. This is also incorrect because the testimony is about the candidate's character as a thief, not his credibility as a witness. **Incorrect**.

9. **Option I**: States the testimony should be admitted only if the witness can provide conclusive proof of the larceny. This is incorrect because the standard for admissibility is relevance, not conclusiveness. **Incorrect**.

10. **Option J**: Claims the testimony should be excluded because bad acts cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence. This is incorrect because extrinsic evidence is admissible in this context to prove character when character is an essential element of a claim or defense. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The testimony is admissible because the candidate's character is at issue in the defamation case, and the newspaper can introduce specific instances of conduct to prove that the statement was true. This aligns with FRE 405(a), making **Option E** the correct answer.
