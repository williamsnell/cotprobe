Question:

A student lent his classmate his car to attend a concert at a theater. Before going to the theater, the classmate drove to a dealer's home to buy some marijuana. The dealer lived approximately two miles from the theater. After picking up the marijuana, the classmate then drove to the concert. As he was driving to the concert, the classmate smoked two marijuana cigarettes so that he could be "high" for the show. While the car was parked outside the theater, through no fault of the classmate, it was struck by another car and damaged. Repairs will cost $750. The driver of the vehicle that struck the student's car fled the scene and cannot be identified. If the student asserts a claim against the classmate for the damage to the student's car, the plaintiff will recover

Options:

A: the cost of repairing the car because the classmate used the car for an illegal purpose.
B: nothing, because the damage was caused by a third party not in control of the car.
C: the cost of repairing the car because the classmate was driving under the influence of marijuana.
D: nothing, because the car was damaged due to an incident that the classmate could not control.
E: the value of the car before it was damaged because the classmate used the car for a purpose other than that for which it was lent.
F: the value of the car before it was damaged because the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control.
G: nothing, because the classmate was not negligent in causing the car's damage.
H: the cost of repairing the car because the classmate used the car for a purpose other than attending the concert.
I: the cost of repairing the car because the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control.
J: the value of the car before it was damaged because the classmate was using illegal substances while driving the car.

Okay, so I have this problem here about a student lending his car to a classmate. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

So the student let his classmate borrow the car to go to a concert at a theater. But before going to the theater, the classmate drove to a dealer's home to buy marijuana. The dealer's place is about two miles from the theater. After getting the marijuana, the classmate then went to the concert. While driving there, he smoked two marijuana cigarettes to get high for the show. 

Then, while the car was parked outside the theater, another car hit it, causing $750 in damage. The person who hit it fled, so they can't be identified. Now, the student is suing the classmate for the damage. The question is whether the student will recover the cost of repairs and which option is correct.

I remember that when someone lends their car to another person, there are rules about the borrower's responsibility. I think it's under something called "bailment." The borrower is supposed to use the car for the purpose it was lent and take reasonable care of it. If they misuse it or are negligent, the lender can hold them responsible for any damages.

In this case, the car was lent for attending a concert. But the classmate used it to first go buy marijuana. That's a different purpose than what it was lent for. So that might be a misuse. Also, the classmate smoked marijuana while driving, which could be considered negligent because driving under the influence increases the risk of accidents. However, in this scenario, the damage happened while the car was parked, not while being driven. So the negligence while driving might not directly cause the damage here.

Wait, but the car was parked when it was hit. So the damage wasn't due to the classmate's driving; it was an accident by a third party. So the question is, is the classmate liable for the damage caused by someone else while the car was in his possession?

I think about the concept of " dominion and control." When you borrow something, you're under a duty to return it in the same condition. If the item is damaged while in your care, even if it's not your fault, you might still be liable. This is sometimes called strict liability in bailment cases. So even if the damage isn't due to your negligence, you're responsible because you had control of the item.

So in this case, the classmate was supposed to return the car in good condition. If it's damaged while parked, even if a third party did it, the classmate might still be liable. Because he had dominion and control, the responsibility lies with him.

Looking at the options, option I says the cost of repairing because the car was under the classmate's dominion and control. Option E talks about using it for another purpose, which would also make the classmate liable for any damage, regardless of fault.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The initial use was for an illegal purposeâ€”buying marijuana. So that's a misuse. But the damage didn't occur during that misuse, it happened while parked after he bought it and was going to the concert. So would the misuse affect liability for the damage in this case?

In some jurisdictions, if the borrower uses the car for a purpose beyond what was intended, even if it's a legal purpose, the lender can recover for any damages. But if the misuse was for an illegal activity, maybe that changes things. But I'm not sure if the misuse here directly relates to the damage.

Alternatively, the strict liability under bailment might apply regardless of misuse. Because the car was in the classmate's care when it was damaged. So even if the third party was at fault, the classmate is responsible to the lender for returning the car in good condition.

So looking at the options, option I says the cost of repair because the car was under the classmate's control. That fits. Option E is about using it for another purpose, which could also apply, but I'm not sure if that's the primary reason here.

Wait, another thought. If the classmate's use was a substantial deviation from the intended purpose, then maybe the student can recover under that theory. But if the car was just parked and damaged by a third party, perhaps the key factor is the dominion and control, not the misuse.

So perhaps the correct answer is I: the cost of repairing the car because the car was under the classmate's dominion and control.

Alternatively, option E says the value before damage because used for another purpose. But the other purpose (buying marijuana) didn't directly cause the damage. The damage was while parked, so maybe the misuse isn't the direct cause, but the bailment's strict liability is.

So I think I is the right answer.

The student lent his car to his classmate for the purpose of attending a concert. However, the classmate used the car to first buy marijuana, which constitutes a misuse of the vehicle. Despite this, the damage occurred while the car was parked outside the theater and was caused by a third party who fled the scene. 

Under the principles of bailment, the borrower (classmate) has a duty to return the car in the same condition it was lent. This is often referred to as "strict liability" in bailment cases, meaning the borrower is responsible for any damage that occurs while the item is in their care, regardless of fault. The key factor here is that the car was under the classmate's dominion and control when it was damaged, even though the damage was caused by a third party.

While the misuse of the car for an illegal purpose (buying marijuana) could also be a relevant factor, the damage did not directly result from this misuse. Therefore, the primary reason for the classmate's liability is the strict liability principle under bailment, as the car was in his care when it was damaged.

Option I correctly reflects this reasoning: "the cost of repairing the car because the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control."
