Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to estimate the value of (3.99)^3 multiplied by (1.01)^4 and then divided by (1.98). The question suggests using linear approximation, so I remember that's a method where we approximate functions near a certain point using their tangent lines. 

Hmm, I think I should break this down into each part. Let me list each term and see how I can approximate them. 

Starting with (3.99)^3. 3.99 is close to 4, right? So maybe I can expand around x=4. Let me recall the formula for linear approximation. It's f(x + Δx) ≈ f(x) + f’(x) * Δx. 

Wait, for (3.99)^3, I can write it as (4 - 0.01)^3. So x is 4, and Δx is -0.01. The function here is f(x) = x^3. So f'(x) is 3x². 

Calculating f(4) is 4^3 which is 64. Then f'(4) is 3*(4)^2 = 3*16 =48. Multiply that by Δx which is -0.01: 48*(-0.01) = -0.48. So the approximation for (3.99)^3 is 64 - 0.48 = 63.52. 

Next, (1.01)^4. This is close to 1, so x=1. Δx is 0.01. Function is f(x)=x^4. So f(1) is 1. f'(x) is 4x^3, so f'(1) is 4. Multiply by Δx=0.01 gives 4*0.01=0.04. So linear approximation is 1 + 0.04 =1.04. 

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe using a different point? Because 1.01 is close to 1, that's fine. So yes, the approximation should be 1.04. 

Now, the third term is (1.98)^-1. That's the same as 1/(1.98). Hmm, 1.98 is close to 2. So let's set x=2, Δx is -0.02. The function here is f(x) = 1/x. So f(x)=x^-1. The derivative f’(x) is -x^-2, which is -1/x². 

Calculating f(2) is 1/2 = 0.5. Then f’(2) is -1/(2²) = -1/4 = -0.25. Multiply by Δx, which is -0.02: (-0.25)*(-0.02) = 0.005. So the approximation is 0.5 + 0.005 = 0.505. 

So now I have all three approximations: 

(3.99)^3 ≈63.52 

(1.01)^4 ≈1.04 

(1.98)^-1 ≈0.505 

Now, I need to multiply them together. So the expression is (63.52) * (1.04) * (0.505). Let me calculate this step by step. 

First, multiply 63.52 by 1.04. Let's see, 63.52 * 1 = 63.52. 63.52 *0.04 is 2.5408. Adding them together: 63.52 + 2.5408 = 66.0608. 

Now, multiply 66.0608 by 0.505. Hmm, let's break this down. 66.0608 *0.5 is 33.0304, and 66.0608*0.005 is 0.330304. Adding those gives 33.0304 + 0.330304 =33.360704. 

So the estimated value is approximately 33.36. Looking at the options, option A is 33.36. So I think the answer is A. 

Wait, but let me double-check my approximations. Did I make any calculation errors? 

For (3.99)^3: (4 - 0.01)^3. f(x)=x^3, f(4)=64, f’(4)=48. So 48*(-0.01)=-0.48; 64-0.48=63.52. That seems right. 

For (1.01)^4: f(x)=x^4, f(1)=1, f’(1)=4. 4*(0.01)=0.04. So 1.04 is correct. 

For (1.98)^-1: f(x)=1/x. f(2)=0.5, f’(2)=-0.25. Δx is -0.02, so -0.25*(-0.02)=0.005. 0.5+0.005=0.505. That looks good. 

Multiplying 63.52 *1.04: 63.52 *1=63.52. 63.52 *0.04: 63.52 *0.04 is 2.5408. Sum to 66.0608. Then multiply by 0.505: 66.0608 *0.5 is 33.0304, and 0.005 is 0.330304. Total is 33.360704, which is 33.36 as before. 

So yeah, the answer should be A:33.36. I think that's correct.

To estimate the value of \( (3.99)^3 \cdot (1.01)^4 \cdot (1.98)^{-1} \) using linear approximation, we break the problem into three parts and approximate each term individually.

---

### 1. Approximation of \( (3.99)^3 \):
- Let \( x = 4 \) and \( \Delta x = -0.01 \). The function is \( f(x) = x^3 \).
- \( f(4) = 4^3 = 64 \).
- \( f'(x) = 3x^2 \), so \( f'(4) = 3 \cdot 4^2 = 48 \).
- Linear approximation:  
  \[
  f(4 - 0.01) \approx f(4) + f'(4) \cdot (-0.01) = 64 + 48 \cdot (-0.01) = 64 - 0.48 = 63.52.
  \]

---

### 2. Approximation of \( (1.01)^4 \):
- Let \( x = 1 \) and \( \Delta x = 0.01 \). The function is \( f(x) = x^4 \).
- \( f(1) = 1^4 = 1 \).
- \( f'(x) = 4x^3 \), so \( f'(1) = 4 \cdot 1^3 = 4 \).
- Linear approximation:  
  \[
  f(1 + 0.01) \approx f(1) + f'(1) \cdot 0.01 = 1 + 4 \cdot 0.01 = 1 + 0.04 = 1.04.
  \]

---

### 3. Approximation of \( (1.98)^{-1} \):
- Let \( x = 2 \) and \( \Delta x = -0.02 \). The function is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \).
- \( f(2) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
- \( f'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2} \), so \( f'(2) = -\frac{1}{2^2} = -0.25 \).
- Linear approximation:  
  \[
  f(2 - 0.02) \approx f(2) + f'(2) \cdot (-0.02) = 0.5 + (-0.25) \cdot (-0.02) = 0.5 + 0.005 = 0.505.
  \]

---

### Combining the Approximations:
Now, multiply the approximated values:
\[
(3.99)^3 \cdot (1.01)^4 \cdot (1.98)^{-1} \approx 63.52 \cdot 1.04 \cdot 0.505.
\]

1. First, calculate \( 63.52 \cdot 1.04 \):  
   \[
   63.52 \cdot 1 = 63.52, \quad 63.52 \cdot 0.04 = 2.5408, \quad \text{so } 63.52 + 2.5408 = 66.0608.
   \]

2. Then, calculate \( 66.0608 \cdot 0.505 \):  
   \[
   66.0608 \cdot 0.5 = 33.0304, \quad 66.0608 \cdot 0.005 = 0.330304, \quad \text{so } 33.0304 + 0.330304 = 33.360704.
   \]

The final estimated value is approximately \( 33.36 \).
