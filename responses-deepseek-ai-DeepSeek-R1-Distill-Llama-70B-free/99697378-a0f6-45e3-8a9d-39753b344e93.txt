Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a CO₂ gas system. We have 2.0 moles of CO₂ gas initially at 25°C and 10 atm pressure. It's confined in a cylinder with a cross-sectional area of 10.0 cm². The gas expands adiabatically against an external pressure of 1.0 atm, and the piston moves outward by 20 cm. We're told that CO₂ is a perfect gas with Cv,m (molar heat capacity at constant volume) being 28.8 J/K/mol. We need to calculate the change in internal energy, ΔU.

Hmm, right. Internal energy is a state function, and for an ideal gas, ΔU depends only on temperature change. Since the process is adiabatic, Q=0, but wait, is it a reversible or irreversible process? Because in reversible adiabatic (isentropic) processes, Q=0 and ΔU = -W. But wait, no—wait, in any adiabatic process, Q=0. For an ideal gas, ΔU is n Cv,m ΔT.

Wait, but in an adiabatic process (whether reversible or not), the first law says ΔU = Q + W, but Q=0, so ΔU = W. But wait, wait—no, the sign conventions. In physics, work done by the system is positive, but in thermodynamics, often work done by the system is negative. Or wait, wait: in the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if the system does work, W is positive, and ΔU decreases.

Wait, maybe I should get this straight. The first law is often written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So if the system does work on the surroundings, W is negative. So in our case, the gas is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings. Therefore, W will be negative, which would make ΔU negative, assuming Q is zero.

Wait, but the process is adiabatic, so Q=0. So ΔU = W (but if W is work done on the system). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

In physics, the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if the system does work (expands), W is positive, and ΔU decreases. So ΔU = Q - W. But in chemistry, sometimes it's written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So in that case, when the system does work, W is negative.

Wait, but in this problem, the work is done by the system (expansion), so in chemistry's version, W would be negative. Therefore, ΔU = Q + W, and since Q=0 (adiabatic), ΔU = W. So W is the work done on the system. But wait, no—the work done by the system is positive, but in the chemistry convention, W is work done on the system, so when the system expands, the surroundings do work on it, which would be negative in that case. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of expansion.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the work done by the system, and since ΔU = -W (in physics convention), but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, for an ideal gas undergoing any process, ΔU = n Cv,m ΔT. So if I can find the temperature change, I can find ΔU.

But wait, in an adiabatic process for an ideal gas, ΔU is equal to the work done. Wait, not exactly. Because in an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU = W (if W is work done on the system). Or perhaps ΔU = -W if W is work done by the system. I'm getting stuck on the sign.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the work done during the expansion and use that to find ΔU, since for an adiabatic process, ΔU equals the negative of the work done (if work is done by the system).

Wait, let's think again. For any process:

ΔU = Q + W,

where W is work done on the system. So if the system does work (expands), W is negative. Since the process is adiabatic, Q=0. So ΔU = W (but W is negative, so ΔU is negative).

So in this case, the gas is expanding against an external pressure, doing work on the surroundings. So W (work done on the system) is negative. Therefore, ΔU (change in internal energy) is negative.

But wait, how to compute W. For expansion against a constant external pressure, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV. So in this case, the work done by the system is positive. So in the formula, W (work done on the system) is negative.

Wait, but the formula for work done by the system when expanding against a constant external pressure is W = -P_ext * ΔV. So, in the context where W is work done on the system, it's negative when the system does work.

So, for our purposes, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV, and the work done on the system is - P_ext * ΔV.

Therefore, in the first law, ΔU = Q + W. Since Q=0, ΔU = W, which is - P_ext * ΔV. So ΔU will be negative.

So the plan is: calculate the volume change ΔV, multiply by the external pressure, and that will give the work done by the system, which in the formula is W = -P_ext * ΔV. So ΔU equals that.

Wait, no. Wait, in the formula, W is work done on the system. So when the system expands, the work done by the system is positive, so W (on system) is negative. So ΔU = Q + W = 0 + (- W_by), where W_by is the work done by the system.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just compute W as the work done by the system, and then set ΔU = - W.

Alternatively, maybe I should just compute the work done, and since the process is adiabatic, ΔU = -W (if W is work done by the system). Let's confirm.

In the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if the process is adiabatic, Q=0, so ΔU = -W. So yes, that makes sense.

So the strategy is to compute the work done by the system (W) and then set ΔU = -W.

Now, compute W. Since the expansion is against a constant external pressure, W is calculated as P_ext * ΔV. But wait, the system's pressure may not be equal to the external pressure. Wait, but because the expansion is against a constant external pressure, the work is P_ext multiplied by the change in volume.

Wait, the formula for work done during expansion against a constant external pressure is W = P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). So yes.

So first, I need to find the change in volume, ΔV = V_final - V_initial.

The piston moves outward by 20 cm. The cross-sectional area is 10.0 cm². So the volume change is area multiplied by the distance moved.

Wait, but converting units correctly.

Area A = 10.0 cm² = 10.0 x (10^-2 m)^2 = 10.0 x 10^-4 m² = 1.0e-3 m².

The piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters.

So ΔV = A * distance = 1.0e-3 m² * 0.2 m = 0.2e-3 m³ = 2.0e-4 m³.

Wait, wait, 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, or 1e3 liters? No, 1 m³ = 1000 liters (since 1 m = 100 cm, so (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³ = 1e3 liters; wait 1 liter is 1 dm³ = 1e-3 m³. So 1 m³ = 1e3 liters? No, 1 m³ = 1000 liters, yes.

Wait, perhaps better to compute in terms of liters for convenience. Let me re-calculate the ΔV.

Wait, the cross-sectional area is 10.0 cm². So 10 cm² is 10 * (1 cm)^2. Since 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² is 10 * 1e-4 m² = 1e-3 m².

The piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So ΔV = Area * distance = 1e-3 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-4 m³.

Wait, 1 m³ is 10^3 liters. So 2e-4 m³ is 2e-4 * 1e3 liters = 2e-1 liters, which is 0.2 liters. Wait, no—because 1 m³ = 1000 liters. So 1e-3 m³ is 1 liter. So 2e-4 m³ is 0.2 liters.

Alternatively, I can compute in SI units. Let's see, 2e-4 m³ is 0.0002 m³.

The external pressure is 1.0 atm. I need to convert that into Pascals because the standard unit for pressure in SI is Pa, and for work, the unit would be in Joules (since 1 Pa * 1 m³ = 1 J).

So 1 atm is 101325 Pa. So P_ext = 1.0 atm = 101325 Pa.

So the work done by the system is W = P_ext * ΔV = 101325 Pa * 2e-4 m³.

Calculating that: 101325 * 2e-4 = (101325 * 2) * 1e-4.

101325 * 2 = 202650.

202650 * 1e-4 = 20.265 J.

So W = 20.265 J.

Since the process is adiabatic, Q=0, so ΔU = -W = -20.265 J.

Wait, but wait a minute. Alternatively, maybe I should have considered whether the expansion is reversible or not. Because in a reversible adiabatic expansion, the process follows PV^γ = constant. But in this case, the process is against a constant external pressure, which is less than the initial pressure. So it's an irreversible expansion.

Wait, but the formula for work done against a constant external pressure is P_ext * ΔV, which applies regardless of whether the process is reversible or not. So that part is correct.

But wait, another thought: the calculation of ΔV. The initial volume is determined by the ideal gas law. The initial conditions are 2.0 mol CO₂ at 25°C (298 K) and 10 atm.

So initial state: n=2.0 mol, T=298 K, P=10 atm.

So initial volume V_initial can be calculated using PV = nRT.

Similarly, the final volume V_final is V_initial + ΔV, where ΔV is the volume change due to the piston moving.

Wait, but wait, the system is expanding, so the final volume is V_initial + ΔV. But the work done is P_ext (ΔV). So perhaps I can compute ΔV this way.

Wait, but let me think again. The piston moves 20 cm, which gives a ΔV of A * distance. So I think that's correct, because the volume change is simply the area times the displacement, regardless of the initial and final states. So ΔV is 0.2 liters, or 2e-4 m³.

Wait, but another approach: compute the initial volume, compute the final volume from the ideal gas law, and then find ΔV as V_final - V_initial. But wait, no, because during the expansion, the pressure drops to the external pressure, which is lower. So the final pressure is 1 atm, but wait, no—the external pressure is 1 atm. The system's pressure may not be 1 atm at the end because the expansion is against a constant external pressure, but the system may not be in equilibrium with the external pressure. Hmm, but for the purpose of calculating the work done, we only need the external pressure and the change in volume. So regardless of the system's final pressure, the work done is P_ext * ΔV.

So I think the initial calculation is correct. So W = P_ext * ΔV = 1 atm * 0.2 L. Wait, no, because 1 atm * 1 L is approximately 101.325 J. But wait, wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J. So 0.2 L·atm would be 0.2 * 101.325 J ≈ 20.265 J, which matches the earlier calculation. So W is 20.265 J. Therefore, ΔU = -20.265 J, which is approximately -20 J.

Looking at the options, F is -20 J. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem states that it's a perfect gas, so all the formulas should apply. The initial calculation for ΔV is correct based on the piston movement. The expansion is against a constant external pressure, so the work is straightforward. And since it's adiabatic, ΔU is -W.

So yes, I think F is the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the adiabatic expansion of 2.0 mol of CO₂ gas against a constant external pressure of 1.0 atm. The piston moves outward by 20 cm, and the cross-sectional area of the cylinder is 10.0 cm². The goal is to calculate the change in internal energy, ΔU.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Adiabatic Process**: For an adiabatic process, \( Q = 0 \), and the first law of thermodynamics simplifies to:
   \[
   \Delta U = W
   \]
   where \( W \) is the work done on the system. Since the gas expands (work is done by the system), \( W \) will be negative, making \( \Delta U \) negative.

2. **Work Done**: The work done by the system during expansion against a constant external pressure is given by:
   \[
   W = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
   \]
   where \( P_{\text{ext}} \) is the external pressure and \( \Delta V \) is the change in volume.

3. **Volume Change**: The change in volume, \( \Delta V \), is calculated using the cross-sectional area of the cylinder and the distance the piston moves:
   \[
   \Delta V = A \cdot d
   \]
   where \( A = 10.0 \, \text{cm}^2 = 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2 \) and \( d = 20 \, \text{cm} = 0.2 \, \text{m} \). Thus:
   \[
   \Delta V = (1.0 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot 0.2 = 2.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3
   \]

4. **Work Calculation**: The external pressure is \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \). Substituting into the work formula:
   \[
   W = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V = -(101325) \cdot (2.0 \times 10^{-4}) = -20.265 \, \text{J}
   \]

5. **Internal Energy Change**: Since \( \Delta U = W \), we find:
   \[
   \Delta U = -20.265 \, \text{J}
   \]
   Rounding to two significant figures, \( \Delta U \approx -20 \, \text{J} \).

### Final Answer:
The change in internal energy is approximately \( -20 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
