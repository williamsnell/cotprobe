The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

On Andros Islands in the Bahamas, populations of mosquito fish, Gambusia hubbsi, colonized a series of ponds. These ponds are no longer connected. However, the environments are very similar except that some ponds contain predatory fish, while others do not. In high predation ponds, selection has favored the evolution of a body shape that enables rapid bursts of speed. In low predation ponds, another body type is favored—one that is well-suited to swim for long periods of time.

Options:

A: Reproductive isolation was a result of behavioral changes.
B: Geographic isolation resulted in sympatric speciation.
C: Allopatric isolation brought about reproductive isolation.
D: Allopatric isolation did not affect reproductive isolation.
E: Reproductive isolation caused geographic isolation.
F: Sympatric isolation resulted in geographic isolation.
G: The body shapes of the fish are the result of genetic drift.
H: Sympatric isolation brought about reproductive isolation.
I: Reproductive isolation was not complete.
J: The evolution of different body shapes is an example of coevolution.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about mosquito fish in the Bahamas. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about populations of Gambusia hubbsi that colonized ponds on Andros Island. These ponds aren't connected anymore, but their environments are similar except some have predatory fish and others don't. In high predation ponds, the fish evolved body shapes for rapid bursts of speed. In low predation, they evolved for long-distance swimming. The question is about what kind of isolation or speciation is happening here.

The options are from A to J, each suggesting different mechanisms. I remember that speciation can occur through different types of isolation, like geographic (allopatric) or sympatric, which is same geographic area but different ecological niches.

So, the ponds are no longer connected. That means they're geographically isolated from each other. So, the fish can't move between ponds, which is allopatric isolation. Allopatric speciation happens when populations are geographically isolated, leading to different traits due to different selection pressures.

In this case, the presence or absence of predators is the main selection pressure. High predation ponds selected for speed, others for endurance. So, the traits are different because of differing environments, but the initial isolation was geographic.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Allopatric isolation brought about reproductive isolation. That makes sense because the ponds being separate (geographic isolation) would prevent interbreeding, leading to reproductive isolation.

Option D says allopatric isolation didn't affect reproductive isolation. That doesn't seem right because the isolation would naturally lead to reproductive isolation over time.

Option B: Geographic isolation leading to sympatric speciation. Wait, sympatric is same area, so that's not the case here. They were in separate ponds, so it's allopatric.

Option A: Reproductive isolation due to behavioral changes. Maybe, but the question doesn't mention behaviors causing isolation, just different body types due to selection. So probably not A.

Option H: Sympatric isolation leading to reproductive. Again, sympatric is same place, so no.

Option G: Body shapes due to genetic drift. Unlikely, because the question says selection favored certain traits, so it's natural selection, not drift.

Option J: Coevolution. Coevolution is when two species evolve together, like predator and prey. But here, it's about different traits in the same species in different environments, so not coevolution.

So the correct answer is probably C. Because the ponds are geographically isolated, leading to reproductive isolation as the populations can't interbreed and adapt differently.

Wait, but what about reproductive isolation? Are they reproductively isolated? The question doesn't say whether they can interbreed if placed together. But the question is about what happened because the ponds are isolated. So the initial isolation is geographic, leading to selection-driven differences. Those differences could eventually lead to reproductive isolation.

So the process is that allopatric isolation (geographic) leads to reproductive isolation because they can't mate and their traits diverge.

So the answer should be C: Allopatric isolation brought about reproductive isolation.

The mosquito fish populations in the Bahamas are geographically isolated in separate ponds, which is an example of allopatric isolation. This geographic separation prevents interbreeding between the populations, leading to reproductive isolation. Over time, differing selection pressures—such as the presence or absence of predators—have driven the evolution of distinct body shapes in the isolated populations. This process aligns with allopatric speciation, where geographic isolation results in reproductive isolation due to the divergence of traits.

Answer: C
