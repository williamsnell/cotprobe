Question:

In the gambling game "craps," a pair of dice is rolled and the outcome of the experiment is the sum of the points on the up sides of the six-sided dice. The bettor wins on the first roll if the sum is 7 or 11. The bettor loses on the first roll if the sum is 2,3 , or 12 . If the sum is $4,5,6$, 8,9 , or 10 , that number is called the bettor's "point." Once the point is established, the rule is as follows: If the bettor rolls a 7 before the point, the bettor loses; but if the point is rolled before a 7 , the bettor wins. Find the probability that the bettor wins on the first roll. That is, find the probability of rolling a 7 or 11 , $P(7$ or 11$)$.

Options:

A: $\frac{5}{36}$
B: $\frac{10}{36}$
C: $\frac{7}{36}$
D:  $\frac{8}{36}$
E: $\frac{11}{36}$
F: $\frac{6}{36}$
G: $\frac{13}{36}$
H: $\frac{12}{36}$
I: $\frac{14}{36}$
J: $\frac{9}{36}$

Okay, so I've got this question about the game of craps, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking for the probability that the bettor wins on the first roll, which happens when the sum rolled is either a 7 or an 11. I need to find P(7 or 11).

Hmm, right. So I remember that when you roll two dice, each die has 6 sides, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36. That makes sense because each die is independent, so for each of the 6 outcomes on the first die, the second die can have 6 outcomes.

Now, I need to figure out how many possible outcomes result in a sum of 7 or 11. Let me start with the sum of 7 because that's more common, I think.

For a sum of 7, the possible pairs (first die, second die) are as follows:
1. (1,6) → 1+6=7
2. (2,5) → 2+5=7
3. (3,4) → 3+4=7
4. (4,3) → 4+3=7
5. (5,2) → 5+2=7
6. (6,1) → 6+1=7
So that's 6 different combinations that result in a sum of 7. Got that.

Next, for a sum of 11. Hmm, how do you get 11 when rolling two dice? Let's see, each die can only go up to 6, so the possible pairs are:
1. (5,6) → 5+6=11
2. (6,5) → 6+5=11
Wait, that's just two combinations. Because 5 and 6 are the only numbers that add up to 11. So that's 2 possible outcomes.

So now, I add the number of favorable outcomes for 7 and 11. That's 6 (for 7) + 2 (for 11) = 8 total favorable outcomes.

Since the total number of possible outcomes is 36, the probability is the number of favorable divided by total, which is 8/36. Oh wait, but I should probably check if I counted correctly. Let me recount for 7: yes, 1-6, 2-5, etc., that's 6. And for 11, it's only two: 5-6 and 6-5. So that's correct.

Wait a second, another way to think about the sum of 7: it's the most probable sum when rolling two dice, so it's higher than others. But 11 is less common because there are only two ways. So adding 6 and 2 gives 8, which makes sense.

So the probability is 8/36. Let me look at the options. The options are from A to J. Let me see:

Option D is 8/36. So that's the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other combinations for 11. No, 5 and 6 are the only ones because 6+5 is 11, and 5+6 is 11. Yeah, that's correct.

So the answer should be D.

The probability of the bettor winning on the first roll in craps is determined by the likelihood of rolling a sum of 7 or 11. 

When rolling two six-sided dice, there are a total of 36 possible outcomes. For a sum of 7, the favorable outcomes are:  
- (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1),  
which gives 6 favorable outcomes.  

For a sum of 11, the favorable outcomes are:  
- (5,6), (6,5),  
which gives 2 favorable outcomes.  

Adding these, there are 6 + 2 = 8 favorable outcomes for rolling a 7 or 11. Therefore, the probability is:  
\[
P(7 \text{ or } 11) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{8}{36}.
\]  

From the given options, the correct answer is **D: $\frac{8}{36}$**.
