Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because electrochemistry isn't my strongest subject. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that for 1000 seconds, a current of 0.0965 amps is passed through 50 ml of 0.1 M NaCl. The reactions happening are the reduction of water to hydrogen at the cathode and oxidation of chloride to chlorine at the anode. I need to find the average concentration of OH- in the final solution.

Hmm, right. So first, I remember that when current passes through an electrolytic solution, it causes ions to be oxidized or reduced. In this case, since it's NaCl, the cations are Na+ and the anions are Cl- and OH-. But the problem specifies that only Cl- is oxidized and water is reduced. So, the anode is where oxidation happens, and the cathode is where reduction happens.

Wait, let me get the reactions right. At the cathode (reduction), water is being reduced. The reaction for that is 2 H2O + 2e- → H2 + 2 OH-. And at the anode, Cl- is oxidized to Cl2. The reaction is 2 Cl- → Cl2 + 2e-.

So for each mole of electrons (which is the current), these reactions occur. Since electrons are involved, I should think in terms of Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Faraday's laws relate the amount of substance reacted to the current and time.

Faraday's first law says that the amount of substance liberated is proportional to the quantity of electricity. The formula is m = (I * t * M) / (n * F), where I is current, t is time, M is molar mass, n is the number of electrons, and F is Faraday's constant.

Wait, let me clarify: actually, it's about moles. Moles (n) = (I * t) / (n * F). Because moles are in terms of equivalents. Oh right, because the total charge is I*t (current times time), which is in coulombs. Each mole of electrons is Faraday's constant, about 96485 C/mol.

So first, I'll calculate the total charge passed. I is 0.0965 A, t is 1000 s. So Q = I * t = 0.0965 * 1000 = 96.5 C.

Now, for each reaction, how many electrons are involved. At the cathode, each H2O molecule gains 2 electrons to produce H2 and OH-. So the reduction reaction involves 2 electrons per H2O molecule, but since each H2 molecule is made from 2 H2O, each H2 molecule requires 2 electrons. So per mole of H2, 2 moles of electrons are consumed.

At the anode, each Cl- loses one electron to become Cl. But since Cl2 is diatomic, two Cl- lose two electrons in total. So for each mole of Cl2, 2 moles of electrons are released (or lost, since it's oxidation).

So both reactions involve 2 electrons per mole of product (H2 and Cl2). That's important because it means that the number of moles of each product will be the same as the number of electrons divided by 2.

Wait, no, more accurately, the number of moles of electrons (which is Q/F) will be split between the two electrodes. But since both reactions use the same number of electrons per mole of product, the moles of H2 produced will equal the moles of Cl2 produced. Because for each mole of H2, 2 electrons are used, and for each mole of Cl2, 2 electrons are released. So same number of moles for each.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the electrons are supplied by the anode and used at the cathode. So the total electrons from the anode must equal those used at the cathode. So for each mole of Cl2, 2 electrons are lost (from 2 Cl-). For each mole of H2, 2 electrons are gained. So the moles of H2 and Cl2 produced are equal. So n(H2) = n(Cl2) = (Q)/(2F).

So let me compute that. Q is 96.5 C. F is 96485 C/mol e-. So n = 96.5 / (2 * 96485) = 96.5 / 192970 ≈ 0.0005 moles.

Wait, 96.5 divided by 192970. Let me compute that. 96.5 / 192970 = approximately 5e-4, 0.0005 moles.

So n(H2) = 0.0005 mol, n(Cl2) = 0.0005 mol.

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of OH- in the solution. So I need to see how much OH- is produced. At the cathode, each mole of H2 produced comes from 2 moles of H2O, and produces 2 moles of OH-.

Wait, the cathode reaction is: 2 H2O + 2e- → H2 + 2 OH-

So for each mole of H2 produced, 2 moles of OH- are produced. So n(OH-) = 2 * n(H2) = 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 mol.

But wait, the solution volume is 50 ml, which is 0.05 liters. So the concentration of OH- is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M?

Wait, but wait. Because in the same solution, the NaCl is getting consumed as Cl- is being oxidized. Let's think about the initial NaCl solution.

The initial concentration is 0.1 M NaCl. So in 50 ml, that's 0.05 liters * 0.1 M = 0.005 moles of NaCl. NaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl-.

So the initial moles of Cl- is 0.005 mol.

But at the anode, Cl- is being oxidized to Cl2. The moles of Cl2 produced are 0.0005 mol. Each mole of Cl2 comes from 2 moles of Cl- (because 2 Cl- → Cl2 + 2 e-). So moles of Cl- consumed: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 mol.

So initial Cl- is 0.005. After reaction: 0.005 - 0.001 = 0.004 mol Cl- left.

Wait, but also, in the solution, Na+ is a spectator ion; it doesn't react. So the Na+ remains, but we also have OH- being produced and Cl- being consumed.

But wait, the Na+ and OH- will form NaOH, so the solution becomes basic.

Wait, but what about the total charge? Because in the solution, the sum of cations must equal the sum of anions.

At the end, after electrolysis:

Moles of Na+ = 0.005 mol (since NaCl is 0.005 mol and only Cl- is consumed, Na+ stays).

Moles of Cl- = 0.004 mol.

Moles of OH- = 0.001 mol.

Wait, because at the cathode, OH- is produced. So the anions in solution are Cl- and OH-.

So total anions: 0.004 + 0.001 = 0.005. Which equals the moles of Na+ (0.005). So charge is balanced.

So the OH- concentration is 0.001 mol in 0.05 L, which is 0.02 M. So the answer would be B: 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Total charge Q = I * t = 0.0965 A * 1000 s = 96.5 C.

Moles of electrons = Q / F = 96.5 / 96485 ≈ 0.001 (exactly, 96.5 / 96485 = 0.0010005 approximately). So about 0.001 moles of e-.

Each reaction uses 2 e- per mole. So for the two reactions:

At cathode: e- are consumed. At anode, e- are released. So the total e- lost = e- gained.

Each H2 molecule uses 2 e-, each Cl2 produces 2 e-. So the moles will be equal.

Moles of H2 = 0.001 / 2 = 0.0005 mol.

Moles of Cl2 = 0.001 / 2 = 0.0005 mol.

At the cathode, each mole of H2 produces 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of OH- = 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 mol.

Volume is 0.05 L, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Yes, that seems right.

So the correct answer is B: 0.02 M.

To determine the average concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) in the final solution, we analyze the electrolysis of 50 mL of 0.1 M NaCl with a current of 0.0965 A for 1000 seconds. The reactions are:

- **Cathode (reduction):** \( 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2 + 2 \text{OH}^- \)
- **Anode (oxidation):** \( 2 \text{Cl}^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2 + 2e^- \)

### Step 1: Calculate the total charge passed
The total charge \( Q \) is given by:
\[
Q = I \cdot t = 0.0965 \, \text{A} \cdot 1000 \, \text{s} = 96.5 \, \text{C}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the moles of electrons
Using Faraday's constant \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \), the moles of electrons \( n_e \) are:
\[
n_e = \frac{Q}{F} = \frac{96.5}{96485} \approx 0.001 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Relate electrons to products
At the cathode, 2 electrons produce 1 mole of \( \text{H}_2 \) and 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \). Similarly, at the anode, 2 electrons produce 1 mole of \( \text{Cl}_2 \). Thus, the moles of \( \text{H}_2 \) and \( \text{Cl}_2 \) produced are equal:
\[
n(\text{H}_2) = n(\text{Cl}_2) = \frac{n_e}{2} = \frac{0.001}{2} = 0.0005 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate moles of \( \text{OH}^- \)
From the cathode reaction, 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) are produced per mole of \( \text{H}_2 \). Therefore:
\[
n(\text{OH}^-) = 2 \cdot n(\text{H}_2) = 2 \cdot 0.0005 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \)
The solution volume is \( 50 \, \text{mL} = 0.05 \, \text{L} \). The concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) is:
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{n(\text{OH}^-)}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer:
The average concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) in the final solution is **0.02 M**.
