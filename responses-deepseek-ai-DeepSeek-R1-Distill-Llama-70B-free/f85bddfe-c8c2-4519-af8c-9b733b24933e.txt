Okay, so I have this question about the order of orbitals in hydrogen-like atoms. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

Hydrogen-like atoms are those with only one electron, right? So their electronic structure is a bit simpler than multi-electron atoms. The energy levels in such atoms depend only on the principal quantum number, n, because the electrons don't experience much repulsion from other electrons. Wait, isn't that true for hydrogen? Oh yeah, in hydrogen-like atoms, the energy levels are degenerate, meaning orbitals with the same n have the same energy.

So the order of increasing energy for orbitals would be based on the principal quantum number. Lower n means lower energy. So 1s comes first because n=1. Then comes n=2, which includes 2s, 2p, and 2px, py, pz, but since they're degenerate, they all have the same energy. Similarly, n=3 includes 3s, 3p, 3d, and so on.

Wait, but wait a second. The order isn't just about n. I remember something about the filling order following the Aufbau principle. Oh, but that's for atoms with multiple electrons where the (n + l) rule applies. Oh right, in hydrogen-like atoms, the energy depends solely on n, so all orbitals in the same n are at the same energy level.

So for the order of increasing energy, it's just the order of n from low to high. So 1s (n=1), then 2s and 2p (n=2), then 3s, 3p, 3d (n=3), then 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f (n=4), and so on.

Looking at the options, option C says: 1s < 2s = 2p < 3s=3p=3d <4s=4p=4d=4f <5s=5p=5d=5f=5g. That seems to fit because each group within the same n is equal. The next group has a higher n, so higher energy.

Wait, but what about the order within the same n? Like, why isn't 2p higher than 2s in some cases? Oh, but in hydrogen-like atoms, for the same n, all l values have the same energy, so 2s and 2p are the same. So option C groups them correctly.

Looking at the other options. Option A has 1s <2p <2s, which would imply 2p is higher than 2s, but that's not right for hydrogen-like atoms. Option B starts with 2s less than 1s, which is wrong because n=1 is lower than n=2. Option D has some equalities but seems mixed up. Option E seems to have incorrect order of n. Option F only includes s orbitals, which isn't the full picture. Option G doesn't group same n orbitals together. Option H has a strange order, mixing higher n in between lower ones. Option I and J also have mixed up orders.

So the correct option is C, where each n level is grouped together with all their subshells equal in energy, and the order is increasing n.

In hydrogen-like atoms, which have only one electron, the energy of the orbitals depends solely on the principal quantum number \( n \). For a given \( n \), all orbitals (e.g., \( s, p, d, f \)) are degenerate, meaning they have the same energy. The energy increases as \( n \) increases. Therefore, the correct order of orbitals in terms of increasing energy is:

1. \( 1s \) (lowest energy, \( n=1 \))
2. \( 2s = 2p \) (same energy, \( n=2 \))
3. \( 3s = 3p = 3d \) (same energy, \( n=3 \))
4. \( 4s = 4p = 4d = 4f \) (same energy, \( n=4 \))
5. \( 5s = 5p = 5d = 5f = 5g \) (same energy, \( n=5 \))

Among the given options, only **Option C** correctly groups orbitals by their principal quantum number \( n \) and reflects the degeneracy of orbitals within the same \( n \). All other options either misorder the energy levels or fail to account for the degeneracy of orbitals in hydrogen-like atoms.

Answer: C
