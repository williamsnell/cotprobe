Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses and focal lengths. Hmm, I remember that the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index of the material it's made of. The problem gives me a plano-convex lens made of flint glass, and I need to find the focal lengths for blue and red light. 

Wait, I think the formula for the focal length of a lens is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). Oh right, but wait, for a plano-convex lens, one side is flat (plano) and the other is convex. So I should remember the signs of the radii of curvature. 

Plano-convex lenses have one surface flat (which I think is R2 = infinity, so 1/R2 is zero) and the other convex, so R1 is positive. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think about the sign conventions. The radius of curvature is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light. So for a plano-convex lens made in a way that the convex side is first, R1 is positive, and R2 is infinity, so 1/R2 is zero. 

So the formula simplifies to 1/f = (n-1) * (1/R1). Because 1/R2 is zero. That makes sense. 

The radius of curvature given is +20 cm. So R1 is 20 cm. Oh wait, is that the radius for the convex surface? Yeah, because the other surface is flat. So R1 is 20 cm. 

The lens is made of flint glass, so I need to use the flint glass refractive indices for blue and red light. Looking at the table, for blue (486.1 nm), the flint index is 1.71748. For red (656.3 nm), it's 1.69427. 

So for each color, I'll plug into the focal length equation. Let me write down the steps:

For blue light:
n_blue = 1.71748
R1 = 20 cm
f_blue = 1 / [(n_blue - 1) * (1/R1)]

Similarly, for red light:
n_red = 1.69427
f_red = 1 / [(n_red - 1) * (1/R1)]

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

Starting with blue:
n_blue - 1 = 1.71748 - 1 = 0.71748
1/R1 is 1/20 cm⁻¹. So 0.71748 * (1/20) = 0.035874 cm⁻¹.
So f_blue is 1 / 0.035874 cm⁻¹. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.035874 is approximately 27.89 cm. So about 27.9 cm.

Now for red:
n_red -1 = 1.69427 -1 =0.69427
Multiply by 1/20: 0.69427 *0.05 = 0.0347135 cm⁻¹.
So f_red is 1 /0.0347135. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.0347 is approximately 28.8 cm. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because blue has a higher refractive index than red, so the focal length should be shorter for blue, longer for red. But wait, according to this, blue is 27.9 and red 28.8. So the order is correct.

Looking at the options, option A is 27.9 and 28.8 cm. So that's the one. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the division.

Wait, for blue: 0.71748 * (1/20) = 0.035874. 1/0.035874 is approximately 27.89 cm. Right.

For red: 0.69427 * (1/20) = 0.0347135. 1 / 0.0347135 is about 28.8 cm. Wait, that's 28.8 cm. So the focal length is longer for red than blue, which makes sense because n is lower for red, so (n-1) is smaller, so 1/((n-1)(1/R)) is larger. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option A is 27.9 and 28.8. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the options.

Looking at the options:
A: 27.9 cm and 28.8 cm
H: 28.5 and 29.4
So A is the correct one.

To determine the focal lengths of a plano-convex lens made of flint glass for blue and red light, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \cdot \frac{1}{R_1}
\]

Here:
- \( R_1 = +20 \, \text{cm} \) (radius of curvature of the convex surface),
- \( R_2 = \infty \) (flat surface, so \( \frac{1}{R_2} = 0 \)),
- \( n \) is the refractive index of flint glass for the respective wavelengths.

### For Blue Light:
- Wavelength: \( 486.1 \, \text{nm} \),
- Refractive index: \( n_{\text{blue}} = 1.71748 \).

\[
n_{\text{blue}} - 1 = 1.71748 - 1 = 0.71748
\]
\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{blue}}} = 0.71748 \cdot \frac{1}{20} = 0.035874 \, \text{cm}^{-1}
\]
\[
f_{\text{blue}} = \frac{1}{0.035874} \approx 27.9 \, \text{cm}.
\]

### For Red Light:
- Wavelength: \( 656.3 \, \text{nm} \),
- Refractive index: \( n_{\text{red}} = 1.69427 \).

\[
n_{\text{red}} - 1 = 1.69427 - 1 = 0.69427
\]
\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{red}}} = 0.69427 \cdot \frac{1}{20} = 0.0347135 \, \text{cm}^{-1}
\]
\[
f_{\text{red}} = \frac{1}{0.0347135} \approx 28.8 \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Conclusion:
The focal lengths for blue and red light are approximately \( 27.9 \, \text{cm} \) and \( 28.8 \, \text{cm} \), respectively. Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: 27.9 cm and 28.8 cm**
