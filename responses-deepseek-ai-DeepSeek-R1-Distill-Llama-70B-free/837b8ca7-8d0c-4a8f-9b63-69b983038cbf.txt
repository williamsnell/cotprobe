Alright, so I've got this question about analog-to-digital converters and sampling rates. Hmm, okay, I remember from my classes that when you convert an analog signal to digital, you have to sample it at a certain rate to avoid issues like aliasing. But wait, what's aliasing again? Oh right, it's when different frequencies in the signal get mixed up because you're not sampling fast enough. So you end up with these artifacts that shouldn't be there.

The question says the bandwidth of the analog signal is 4kHz. Oh wait, bandwidth usually refers to the range of frequencies the signal covers. So if it's 4kHz, that probably means the highest frequency in the signal is 4kHz. Like, maybe from 0 to 4kHz?

I remember something called the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Oh yeah, that's the one. It says that to accurately capture an analog signal, you need to sample it at least twice the highest frequency present. So the minimum sampling rate is twice the bandwidth.

Wait, but wait, the bandwidth is given as 4kHz. So the highest frequency is 4kHz. So the minimum sampling rate would be 2 times 4kHz, which is 8kHz, right? Because if you sample lower than that, you get aliasing.

Looking at the options, option E is 8. So that should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't get this wrong. Oh, right, the theorem says the sampling rate must be greater than twice the maximum frequency. So 8kHz is the minimum. So if the options include 8, that's the one. I think that's correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes people get confused between bit rate and sampling rate, but that's not the case here. The question is purely about the sampling rate needed to prevent aliasing. So yeah, 8kHz makes sense.

To determine the minimum sampling rate required to eliminate the aliasing problem when converting an analog signal with a bandwidth of 4kHz, we apply the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. This theorem states that the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal. Since the bandwidth of 4kHz corresponds to the highest frequency in the signal, the minimum sampling rate is:

\[
\text{Minimum Sampling Rate} = 2 \times 4\,\text{kHz} = 8\,\text{kHz}.
\]

Among the given options, the correct answer is **E: 8**.
