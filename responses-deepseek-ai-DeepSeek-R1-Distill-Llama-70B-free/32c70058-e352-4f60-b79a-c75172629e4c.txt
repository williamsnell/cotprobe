Okay, so I've got this question here about a man's diet and the energy from protein. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question says that a 70 kg man is on a diet that gives him 3000 Kcal per day. He excretes 27 grams of urea daily. I need to find out what percentage of his daily energy comes from protein. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

Wait, the question gives me some conversion factors. Each gram of protein yields 4 Kcal and 0.16 grams of nitrogen as urea. Oh right, urea is a byproduct of protein metabolism, so the amount of urea can help determine how much protein he's using.

So first, I think I need to find out how much protein he's consuming based on the urea excreted. But wait, wait. Urea contains nitrogen, and protein metabolism produces urea. So each gram of protein has a certain amount of nitrogen, which ends up as urea.

The question says each gram of protein yields 0.16g of nitrogen as urea. So if he excretes 27g of urea, not all of that is necessarily from protein. Wait, but I think in this context, it's assuming that all the urea is from protein metabolism. Or maybe that's the only source considered here. I'll go with that for now.

So, the total nitrogen excreted as urea is 27 grams. Since each gram of protein gives 0.16g of nitrogen, I can find out how much protein he's metabolizing.

Let me calculate that. If I let P be the protein in grams, then 0.16 * P = 27g (of nitrogen). So P = 27 / 0.16. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 0.16 is the same as 27 * (100/16) = 2700 /16. Let's see, 16*168 is 2688. So 2700-2688 is 12, so it's 168.75 grams of protein.

Wait, wait, that seems like a lot. 168 grams of protein a day? I thought the average is like 50-100 grams. But 168 is quite high. Hmm, but let's proceed because maybe that's correct.

Each gram of protein gives 4 Kcal. So the energy from protein is 168.75g *4 Kcal/g = 675 Kcal.

But wait, the total daily energy intake is 3000 Kcal. So the percentage would be (675 / 3000) *100.

675 divided by 3000 is 0.225, which is 22.5%. So looking at the options, option I is 22.5%.

Wait a second, but I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes the body uses some of the protein for other things, like building tissues, not just for energy. But the question says the protein yields 4 Kcal, so maybe it's assuming all the protein is being oxidized for energy. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Oh wait, maybe that's a complication, but the question's given the data, so perhaps we're to go with that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that not all of the nitrogen comes from dietary protein. Like, maybe some is from other sources. But the question doesn't mention that, so I think it's safe to proceed under the given data.

So, putting it all together, the energy from protein is 675 Kcal, which is 22.5% of 3000 Kcal. So the answer should be option I.

To determine the percentage of the man's daily energy requirement met by protein, we start by calculating the total protein intake based on the urea excreted. Each gram of protein yields 0.16 g of nitrogen as urea, and the man excretes 27.0 g of urea daily. Let \( P \) represent the protein intake in grams:

\[
0.16 \cdot P = 27.0 \implies P = \frac{27.0}{0.16} = 168.75 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we calculate the energy provided by this protein. Since each gram of protein yields 4 Kcal:

\[
\text{Energy from protein} = 168.75 \cdot 4 = 675 \, \text{Kcal}.
\]

The total daily energy intake is 3000 Kcal. The percentage of energy met by protein is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{675}{3000} \right) \cdot 100 = 22.5\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the man's daily energy requirement met by protein is **22.5%**, corresponding to option **I**.
