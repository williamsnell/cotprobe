Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Dickenson Company and whether they should keep a hand-operated machine or switch to an automatic one after a year. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, let's understand the situation. They bought a hand-operated machine for $4,400. It has a 5-year useful life and no salvage value. The annual operating costs are $2,600. Now, after one year, they have the option to buy an automatic machine for $6,200. The automatic machine has a 4-year life and also no salvage value. Its annual operating cost is $800. They can sell the hand-operated machine for $1,600 after one year. The interest rate is 8%, so I guess I need to consider the time value of money here.

The question is whether they should stick with the hand-operated machine for the full 5 years (Option A) or switch after one year (Option B). I think I need to calculate the total cost for each option and see which is cheaper.

Let's outline both options:

Option A: Keep the hand-operated machine for 5 years. So, the initial cost is $4,400. Each year, operating costs are $2,600. Since there's no salvage value, after 5 years, they get nothing back.

Option B: Keep the hand machine for 1 year, sell it for $1,600, then buy the automatic machine. So, the initial cost is $4,400, but after one year, they get $1,600 back. Then they spend $6,200 on the automatic machine, which they'll use for 4 years. Each year, the automatic costs $800 to operate.

Wait, but the timelines might not perfectly align. Let me think: If they switch after one year, the automatic machine will be used for four years, but the hand machine was used for one. So the total period is five years as well, right? Because the hand machine's life is five, but they're only using it for one before switching.

So for Option B, the cash flows are:

- Year 0: -$4,400 (buy hand machine)
- Year 1: +$1,600 (sell hand machine) and -$6,200 (buy automatic)
- Years 1-4: Each year, -$800 operating cost for automatic.

Wait, actually, when they sell the hand machine in year 1, they also buy the automatic in year 1, so the net cash flow at year 1 is +1,600 -6,200 = -4,600. But also, year 1's operating cost would be for the hand machine, right? Because the switch happens after year 1, so in year 1, they operate the hand machine for the whole year, then sell it and buy the automatic for the next four years.

So breaking it down:

Option A:
- Initial cost: $4,400
- Operating costs: $2,600 each year for 5 years.

Option B:
- Year 0: -$4,400
- Year 1: +$1,600 (sale), -$6,200 (purchase)
- Years 1-4: Each year, -$800 operating cost. Wait, no, year 1's operating cost is for the hand machine because they use it all year, then sell it. So from year 2 to year 5, they have the automatic machine, which is 4 years. So in year 1, operating cost is $2,600 (hand), and years 2-5, it's $800 each (automatic).

Wait, let me clarify the timeline:

Option B:
- Year 0: Buy hand machine for $4,400.
- Year 1: Operate hand machine, cost $2,600. At end of year 1, sell for $1,600, buy automatic for $6,200.
- Years 2-5: Operate automatic, each year $800.

So the cash flows would be:

Year 0: -4,400

Year 1: -2,600 (operating) +1,600 (sale) -6,200 (purchase) = (-2,600 -4,600) = -7,200? Wait, that's not right. Wait, the cash flows are:

At year 0: outflow of 4,400.

At year 1: outflow of 2,600 (operating cost), then they sell the machine for 1,600 (inflow), and buy the automatic for 6,200 (outflow). So net cash flow for year 1 is -2,600 +1,600 -6,200 = -7,200. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct.

Then, for years 2-5, each year has an operating cost of 800, so each year is -800.

Wait, but we need to calculate the total cost considering the time value of money, using the interest rate of 8%. So I think we should compute the present value of all these cash flows and compare the two options.

So for each option, compute the present value (PV) of all cash outflows.

Let's start with Option A.

Option A:

Initial cost: $4,400 at time 0.

Operating costs: $2,600 per year for 5 years. So those are annual payments starting at the end of year 1.

So the PV for Option A is:

PV_A = 4,400 + (2,600 * PVIFA(8%,5)).

Wait, no. The initial cost is a cash outflow at time 0, so it's just 4,400. The operating costs are each year, so they are future cash outflows, so we need to discount them.

Wait, the formula for the present value of an annuity is PVIFA = [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So PVIFA(8%,5) = [1 - (1.08)^-5]/0.08. Let me compute that:

1.08^5 is approximately 1.4693. So 1 - 1/1.4693 ≈ 0.6810. Then 0.6810 / 0.08 ≈ 8.5125.

So the present value of the operating costs is 2,600 * 8.5125 ≈ let's calculate:

2,600 * 8 = 20,800; 2,600 * 0.5125 ≈ 1,332.5. So total ≈ 22,132.5.

So PV_A = 4,400 + 22,132.5 = 26,532.5.

Wait, but wait, the initial cost is a cash outflow, so it's a negative. So perhaps I should model everything as cash outflows.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the total cost as initial cost plus the present value of the operating costs.

So yes, PV_A = 4,400 + 2,600 * PVIFA(8%,5) = 4,400 + 2,600 * 8.5125 ≈ 4,400 + 22,132.5 ≈ 26,532.5.

Now, Option B: let's compute each cash flow's present value.

Cash flows:

Year 0: -4,400.

Year 1: -2,600 (operating) +1,600 (sale) -6,200 (purchase) = (-2,600 -6,200 +1,600) = (-7,200).

Wait, that's a net cash outflow of 7,200 in year 1.

Then, Years 2-5: each year, operating cost of -800.

So, the cash flows are:

Year 0: -4,400

Year 1: -7,200

Years 2-5: -800 each year.

So to compute the present value, we'll discount each of these.

So PV_B is:

PV_B = (-4,400) + (-7,200)/(1.08)^1 + (-800)/(1.08)^2 + (-800)/(1.08)^3 + (-800)/(1.08)^4 + (-800)/(1.08)^5.

Alternatively, we can compute the present value of the operating costs from years 2-5 as an annuity, and add the other terms.

So let's compute each part.

First, the present value of the year 1 cash flow: -7,200 / 1.08 ≈ -6,666.67.

Then, the operating costs from years 2-5: this is an annuity of 4 years, starting at year 2. The present value at time 0 would be 800 * PVIFA(8%,4) / (1.08)^1, because the first payment is at year 2, so it's like a deferred annuity.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the PV of the four payments of 800 starting at year 2.

The present value of an ordinary annuity ( payments at end of year ) for 4 years is 800 * PVIFA(8%,4). Let's compute PVIFA(8%,4):

[1 - (1.08)^-4 ] / 0.08.

(1.08)^4 ≈ 1.3605, so 1 - 1/1.3605 ≈ 0.7359. Then 0.7359 / 0.08 ≈ 9.1988.

So 800 * 9.1988 ≈ 7,359.

But since the first payment is at year 2, we need to discount this present value back to year 0. So multiply by 1/(1.08)^1: 7,359 / 1.08 ≈ 6,811.17.

So the present value of the operating costs from years 2-5 is approximately -6,811.17.

Wait, but that's if we're considering them as a negative cash flow. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

Each year's operating cost is 800, so:

Year 2: 800/(1.08)^2 ≈ 800/1.1664 ≈ 685.88

Year 3: 800/(1.08)^3 ≈ 800/1.2597 ≈ 634.82

Year 4: 800/(1.08)^4 ≈ 800/1.3605 ≈ 587.72

Year 5: 800/(1.08)^5 ≈ 800/1.4693 ≈ 544.22

Adding these up: 685.88 + 634.82 = 1,320.7; +587.72 = 1,908.42; +544.22 = 2,452.64.

But this seems lower than the 6,811 I calculated earlier. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the approach. Because 800 for four years starting at year 2, so the present value is:

PV = 800/(1.08)^2 + 800/(1.08)^3 + 800/(1.08)^4 + 800/(1.08)^5.

Which can be written as 800 * [1/(1.08)^2 + 1/(1.08)^3 + 1/(1.08)^4 + 1/(1.08)^5 ].

Factor out 1/(1.08)^2:

800/(1.08)^2 * [1 + 1/1.08 + 1/(1.08)^2 + 1/(1.08)^3 ]

The series in the brackets is a 4-year annuity at 8%, so PVIFA(8%,4) = 9.1988.

Wait no, because the series is 1 + 1/1.08 + 1/(1.08)^2 + 1/(1.08)^3. That's 4 terms, so it's like PVIFA(8%,4) but the first term is at time 0. So it's the same as PVIFA(8%,4).

Wait, no, because the first term is 1, which is present value at time 0, then 1/1.08 is time 1, etc. So yes, it's PVIFA(8%,4) = 9.1988.

So the present value is 800 * (1/(1.08)^2) * 9.1988.

Compute 1/(1.08)^2 = 1/1.1664 ≈ 0.8573.

So 800 * 0.8573 * 9.1988 ≈ 800 * 7.886 ≈ 6,308.8.

Wait, that's different from the previous approach. Hmm, perhaps I should just compute each year and sum them up.

Let me compute each term:

Year 2: 800 / (1.08)^2 = 800 / 1.1664 ≈ 685.88

Year 3: 800 / (1.08)^3 ≈ 634.82

Year 4: 800 / (1.08)^4 ≈ 587.72

Year 5: 800 / (1.08)^5 ≈ 544.22

Adding these: 685.88 + 634.82 = 1,320.70; +587.72 = 1,908.42; +544.22 = 2,452.64.

So the present value of the operating costs from years 2-5 is approximately $2,452.64. Wait, that's different from the previous method. Hmm, I think I'm confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the present value of the four payments correctly.

Wait, another approach: The operating costs from year 2 to year 5 are an ordinary annuity of 4 years, but starting one year from now. So the present value at time 1 would be 800 * PVIFA(8%,4) ≈ 800 * 9.1988 ≈ 7,359. Then, discount that back to time 0: 7,359 / 1.08 ≈ 6,811. So the present value is approximately 6,811.

Wait, but when I calculated each year's present value and summed, I got 2,452.64. That can't be right because 6,811 is much larger. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results. I must be making a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, 1.08 to the power of 2 is 1.1664, so 800/1.1664 is about 685.88. That's correct for year 2. Similarly, year 3 is 800/(1.08)^3 ≈ 634.82. But when I sum all four, it's about 2,452.64. But according to the annuity approach, it's 6,811. That's a big discrepancy. I must have messed up.

Wait a minute, no. Wait, the 7,359 is the present value at time 1. So when you bring that back to time 0, it's 7,359 / 1.08 ≈ 6,811. Which is correct. So the correct present value for the four operating costs is 6,811.

Wait, but when I summed the individual years, I got 2,452.64. That's not possible. Oh wait, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the signs. Because the operating costs are outflows, so they should be negative. So perhaps I'm confusing positive and negative signs.

Wait, no, the present value calculation is just the magnitude. Let me clarify.

Each operating cost is a cash outflow, so each is negative. So when I compute their present values, they are negative amounts.

So, let me correct that:

Year 2: -800 / 1.08^2 ≈ -685.88

Year 3: -800 / 1.08^3 ≈ -634.82

Year 4: -800 / 1.08^4 ≈ -587.72

Year 5: -800 / 1.08^5 ≈ -544.22

Adding these: (-685.88) + (-634.82) = -1,320.70; + (-587.72) = -1,908.42; + (-544.22) = -2,452.64.

So the present value of the four operating costs is -2,452.64.

Wait, but earlier using the annuity approach, I had 6,811. That's conflicting. I must have made a mistake in the annuity approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the number of periods. Because the annuity in the second case is 4 years, but perhaps it's being treated as a different period.

Wait, let me recalculate the annuity way.

If I have an ordinary annuity ( payments at end of each year ) of 800 for 4 years, starting at the end of year 2. So at time 1, the present value of those 4 payments is 800 * PVIFA(8%,4) ≈ 800 * 9.1988 ≈ 7,359. Then, to get the present value at time 0, I discount this by 8% for one year: 7,359 / 1.08 ≈ 6,811. So that's correct.

But when I calculated each year individually, I got a present value of -2,452.64. That's a problem because these two methods should give the same result. Wait, no. Wait, 6,811 is the present value at time 0 of the 800s received at the end of years 2-5. But each of those is a cash outflow, so it's -6,811.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the 800s are cash outflows, so the present value is negative.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between inflows and outflows. Let me clarify.

The operating costs are outflows, so each 800 is a negative cash flow. So the present value of these outflows is negative.

So using the annuity approach, the present value of the outflows is:

- [800 * PVIFA(8%,4)] / 1.08 = - [7,359] / 1.08 ≈ -6,811.

Wait, no, that can't be because when I compute each year's value, it sums to -2,452.64.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the annuity approach. Because the annuity starts at year 2, which is one period after time 0. So the correct present value should be:

PV = 800 * [1/(1.08)^2 + 1/(1.08)^3 + 1/(1.08)^4 + 1/(1.08)^5 ]

Which is 800 * [ (1/1.08^2) * (1 + 1/1.08 + 1/1.08^2 + 1/1.08^3) ) ]

The series in
