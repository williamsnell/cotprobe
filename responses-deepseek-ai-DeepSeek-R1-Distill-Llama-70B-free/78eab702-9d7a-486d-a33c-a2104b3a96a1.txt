Question:

A dentist has noticed that about two children in every seven whom he sees professionally develop cavities before they turn 10 years old. Last week he examined the teeth of five unrelated children younger than 10. Let X be the number of children who develop cavities before turning 10. Which of the following gives the probability that at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10?

Options:

A: P(X = 3 out of 5)
B: P(X = 0)
C: P(X = 7 out of 10)
D: P(X = 1)
E: 1 – P(X = 1)
F: P(X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
G: P(X = 2 out of 7)
H: P(X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
I: 1 – P(X = 0)
J: P(X = 2 out of 5)

Okay, so I've got this problem here about probability, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what's going on.

The dentist notices that two out of every seven children he sees develop cavities before they're 10. So the probability for a single child is 2/7. Wait, no, wait—wait, two in seven, so the probability p is 2/7. But wait, actually, probability is calculated as the number of successes over total. So if two out of seven develop cavities, then p is 2/7, right? Or wait, maybe it's 2/7. Because seven children, two get cavities. So p = 2/7 per child.

Now, the dentist examined five unrelated children, all under 10. X is the number of those five who develop cavities before turning 10.

The question is asking for the probability that at least one will develop a cavity. So P(at least one success), which is the same as 1 minus P(none), which is 1 – P(X=0).

Wait, because calculating P(X ≥1) is the same as 1 – P(X=0), since the only other possibility is that none develop cavities. So that's the approach.

So looking at the options, I need to find which option represents 1 – P(X=0), because that's the probability of at least one child getting a cavity.

Let me look at the options.

Option A: P(X=3 out of 5) — that's the probability exactly three develop cavities. Not what we're looking for.

Option B: P(X=0) — that's the probability none develop cavities. But we want the opposite, so maybe this is part of the correct answer but not on its own.

Option C: P(X=7 out of 10) — wait, X is the number out of five children, so this doesn't make sense. Probably not relevant.

Option D: P(X=1) — exactly one child, but we want any number from 1 to 5.

Option E: 1 – P(X=1) — that would be the probability of not exactly one, but that's not the same as at least one. Because P(at least one) is 1 – P(X=0), so this isn't correct.

Option F: P(X=1,2,3,4,5) — this seems like it's asking for X being any of those values. But I think the notation is a bit unclear. In probability terms, P(X=1 or X=2 or X=3 or X=4 or X=5) which is indeed the same as P(X ≥1). So that's one way to express it, but let's see if another option is better.

Option G: P(X=2 out of 7) — again, X is out of 5, so this doesn't fit.

Option H: P(X=2,3,4,5,6,7) — same issue as G; X is only for 5 children, so 6 and 7 aren't possible.

Option I: 1 – P(X=0) — this is exactly what I thought earlier. Because 1 minus the probability that none have cavities gives the probability that at least one does. So this option is correct.

Option J: P(X=2 out of 5) — that's exactly two, but again, we need any number from 1 to 5.

So the correct answer should be option I: 1 – P(X=0).

The problem involves calculating the probability that at least one out of five children develops a cavity before turning 10, given that the probability of a single child developing a cavity is \( \frac{2}{7} \). The key insight is that the probability of at least one child developing a cavity is complementary to the probability that none of the children develop cavities. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[
P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)
\]

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( P(X = 3 \text{ out of 5}) \) refers to the probability that exactly three children develop cavities, which is not the desired probability.
- **Option B**: \( P(X = 0) \) is the probability that none of the children develop cavities, but this is the complement of what is needed.
- **Option C**: \( P(X = 7 \text{ out of 10}) \) is irrelevant because \( X \) is defined for 5 children, not 10.
- **Option D**: \( P(X = 1) \) refers to exactly one child developing a cavity, which is too narrow.
- **Option E**: \( 1 - P(X = 1) \) represents the probability of not having exactly one child with a cavity, which is not the same as \( P(X \geq 1) \).
- **Option F**: \( P(X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) \) represents the probability of at least one child developing a cavity, but it is less concise than Option I.
- **Option G**: \( P(X = 2 \text{ out of 7}) \) is irrelevant because \( X \) is defined for 5 children, not 7.
- **Option H**: \( P(X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \) is also irrelevant for the same reason as Option G.
- **Option I**: \( 1 - P(X = 0) \) is the correct expression for the probability of at least one child developing a cavity.
- **Option J**: \( P(X = 2 \text{ out of 5}) \) refers to exactly two children developing cavities, which is too narrow.

The correct answer is **Option I**, as it directly represents the desired probability.

**Answer: I**
