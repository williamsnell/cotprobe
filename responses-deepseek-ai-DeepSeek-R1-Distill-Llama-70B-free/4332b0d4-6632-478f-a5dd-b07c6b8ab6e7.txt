Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because equilibrium problems can be tricky. Let's see what I can do. I'll take it step by step.

The problem says: We're looking for the equilibrium composition of a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and molecular oxygen (O2) at 3000 K and 30 psia. The mixture has 5 atoms of oxygen per atom of carbon. The options are from A to J, each giving different mole fractions for CO, O2, and CO2.

Hmm, I think I need to set up an equilibrium expression here. Let me recall that at high temperatures like 3000 K, reactions tend to favor endothermic directions because of the increased entropy. But wait, I'm not sure about the specific reactions here.

Wait, maybe I should write the possible reactions. Carbon monoxide and oxygen can react to form carbon dioxide. The reaction is: CO + O2 ↔ CO2. Or wait, maybe it's more accurate to write it as 2 CO + O2 ↔ 2 CO2. Or perhaps each CO can react with half O2. Let me think. The basic reaction between CO and O2 is CO + 1/2 O2 ↔ CO2. Yeah, that sounds right because CO2 has one more O than CO, so it takes half an O2 molecule.

So the reaction is: CO + 1/2 O2 ↔ CO2. The equilibrium constant K for this reaction would depend on the temperature. At 3000 K, I'm not sure what K is off the top of my head, but I think at high temperatures, K decreases for exothermic reactions because Le Chatelier's principle says the system will adjust to counteract the high temperature. Wait, is this reaction exothermic or endothermic?

Let me think. Formation of CO2 from CO and O2 is exothermic. Because CO2 is more stable than CO and O2. So when K is higher, the reaction is product-favored. But at higher temps, K decreases, so the reverse reaction is favored more. So at 3000 K, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as much, so more reactants remain. So maybe the conversion to CO2 is lower at high temps.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact K value. Maybe I can find it using standard Gibbs free energy or something. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the equilibrium expressions.

Given the problem, the mixture has 5 oxygen atoms per carbon atom. Let's denote the number of moles. Suppose we have 1 mole of carbon. Then oxygen would be 5 moles. So the initial moles are all in CO and O2, perhaps? Or maybe some CO2 as well. Wait, the problem says it's a mixture initially of CO, CO2, and O2. Or is it that the initial mixture is of these three? Hmm, no, the problem might be that we start with some initial amounts, but it's at equilibrium, so perhaps we need to express changes in terms of variables.

Wait, maybe I should let the initial moles be based on the assumption. Wait, the problem says the mixture contains 5 atoms of oxygen per atom of carbon. So for each carbon atom, 5 O atoms. Let's think in terms of moles.

Let me denote the moles of CO as x, CO2 as y, and O2 as z. We need to find x, y, z at equilibrium.

But wait, considering the atoms: Each CO has 1 C and 1 O. Each CO2 has 1 C and 2 O. O2 has 2 O atoms.

The total carbon atoms are x + y (since each CO and CO2 has one C each). The total oxygen atoms are x*(1) + y*(2) + z*(2). Because each CO contributes 1 O, CO2 contributes 2 O, and each O2 molecule contributes 2 O atoms.

The ratio of O atoms to C atoms is (x + 2y + 2z) / (x + y) = 5. So:

(x + 2y + 2z) = 5(x + y)

Simplify that:

x + 2y + 2z = 5x +5y

Bring everything to left:

x + 2y + 2z -5x -5y =0 → -4x -3y +2z=0 → 2z =4x +3y → z= (4x +3y)/2.

That's one equation.

Now, considering the chemical reaction: CO + 1/2 O2 ↔ CO2.

Let me define the change using extent of reaction, ξ. So for each mole of reaction, we consume 1 mole of CO, 0.5 moles of O2, and produce 1 mole of CO2.

So the mole changes are:

CO: initial is x → x - ξ

O2: initial is z → z - 0.5 ξ

CO2: initial is y → y + ξ

Wait, but maybe I should consider initial moles as being in terms of variables. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to let the initial state be all CO and O2, but that may not be the case here. Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of the extent of reaction, ξ, and the initial conditions.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me assume that the initial amounts are such that we have a certain amount of CO, CO2, and O2, but perhaps that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I should let the initial state be in terms of some variables and then express changes via ξ.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that at equilibrium, the mole fractions are x_CO, x_O2, x_CO2, and these sum to 1. But perhaps that's not directly helpful yet.

Alternatively, perhaps using partial pressures. Let me think about the equilibrium expression for the reaction.

The reaction is CO + 1/2 O2 ↔ CO2.

The equilibrium constant Kp is (P_CO2) / (P_CO * (P_O2)^(1/2)) )

But to find Kp at 3000 K, I think I need the standard Gibbs free energy change ΔG°, which is related to K by ΔG°= -RT ln K.

But I don't have the exact value of ΔG° for this reaction at 3000 K. Alternatively, I can look up the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for each substance at 3000 K.

Wait, I recall that at high temperatures, the Gibbs free energy of formation for CO is lower than that of CO2, which might mean that CO is more stable, so the reverse reaction is favored. So K would be lower, meaning less CO2 at equilibrium.

But without exact numbers, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that at high temperatures, the reaction tends to go backward, so more CO and O2, less CO2.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to proceed.

Let me define the extent of reaction as ξ. Let me assume that initially, we have some amounts. Wait, but the problem doesn't give initial amounts. Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the mixture is at equilibrium, so we have to express the mole fractions in terms of each other.

Wait, but the problem gives the ratio of oxygen to carbon atoms as 5:1. So maybe we can express that in terms of the mole fractions.

Let me think in terms of moles. Let’s assume a basis of 1 mole of carbon. So total moles of C is 1.

So, the moles of CO would be a, CO2 would be b, and O2 would be c. Then, the total moles would be a + b + c.

But wait, each CO and CO2 has 1 C each, so a + b = 1 mole of C. So a + b =1.

The oxygen atoms: Each CO has 1 O, CO2 has 2 O, and O2 has 2 O per molecule. So total O atoms: a*(1) + b*(2) + c*(2) = 5 * (a + b) because the ratio is 5 O per C. Since a + b =1, total O is 5 *1 =5.

So:

a + 2b + 2c =5.

But since a + b=1 → a=1 -b.

Substituting into the O equation:

(1 - b) + 2b + 2c =5 → 1 + b + 2c =5 → b +2c=4 → 2c=4 -b → c=(4 -b)/2.

So, now, we have a=1 -b, c=(4 -b)/2.

But the reaction is CO + ½ O2 ↔ CO2. Let's consider the extent of reaction ξ. So, for each mole of reaction, CO decreases by ξ, O2 decreases by ξ/2, and CO2 increases by ξ.

Wait, but since we're at equilibrium, we can express the moles as:

Initially, before reaction, we have a= initial CO, c= initial O2, and b= initial CO2. But perhaps it's easier to express in terms of the extent ξ.

Alternatively, let me express the changes as:

CO: a = initial CO - ξ

O2: c = initial O2 - (ξ/2)

CO2: b = initial CO2 + ξ.

Wait, but I don't know the initial amounts. Hmm, maybe another approach: Let's express the equilibrium mole fractions in terms of ξ.

Let me consider that the total moles at equilibrium are a + b + c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of mole fractions. Let me denote x as the mole fraction of CO, y as O2, and z as CO2. But this might complicate things because the total pressure affects partial pressures.

Wait, the total pressure is 30 psia. But I think that the reaction's equilibrium constant is based on partial pressures, so perhaps I should express each partial pressure in terms of mole fraction and total pressure.

So, P_CO = x * P_total = 30 psia * x

Similarly, P_O2 = y *30, P_CO2 = z*30.

The reaction is CO + ½ O2 ↔ CO2, so Kp = (P_CO2) / ( P_CO * (P_O2)^0.5 )

So, Kp = (z*30) / [ (x*30) * (y*30)^0.5 ) ]

Simplify:

Kp = (z)/(x * (y)^0.5 * 30^{0.5} )

But without knowing Kp, I can't proceed numerically. Hmm, maybe I need to find Kp at 3000 K.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the equilibrium constant using the van 't Hoff equation, but that would require knowing the ΔH of reaction, which I might not have.

Wait, but maybe I can use standard Gibbs free energies of formation at 3000 K for CO, CO2, and O2. The ΔG° for the reaction would be ΔG°_rxn = ΔG°f(CO2) - [ΔG°f(CO) + ½ ΔG°f(O2)]

But ΔG°f for O2 is zero because it's the standard state. So, ΔG°_rxn = ΔG°f(CO2) - ΔG°f(CO).

I think at high temperatures, the ΔG°f for CO is lower than that of CO2, making ΔG°_rxn positive, so the reaction is non-spontaneous, meaning K is less than 1.

Wait, but without exact values, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe I can look up approximate values or use some estimation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that at 3000 K, the reaction doesn't proceed much, so the mole fractions are determined mostly by the stoichiometry and the initial conditions.

Wait, maybe I can make an assumption that CO is the dominant species, and O2 is present in significant amounts, while CO2 is less.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think again about the constraints.

We have a + b =1 (because 1 mole of C), and a +2b +2c=5 (from O atoms).

And c = (4 -b)/2.

Also, from the reaction, we can write the mole fractions in terms of extent ξ, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe I can express everything in terms of b, the moles of CO2.

From a + b =1 → a=1 - b.

From c = (4 -b)/2.

Total moles, n_total = a + b + c = (1 -b) + b + (4 -b)/2 = 1 + (4 -b)/2 = (2 +4 -b)/2 = (6 -b)/2.

Now, the mole fractions are:

x_CO = a / n_total = (1 - b) / [(6 -b)/2] = 2(1 - b)/(6 - b).

x_O2 = c / n_total = [(4 - b)/2 ] / [ (6 -b)/2 ] = (4 -b)/(6 -b).

x_CO2 = b / n_total = b / [(6 -b)/2] = 2b/(6 -b).

Now, plug these into the equilibrium expression Kp.

Kp = (z*30) / [ (x*30) * (y*30)^0.5 ) ]

Wait, no, earlier I had Kp in terms of mole fractions and total pressure. Let me correct that.

Wait, the partial pressures are x_CO * P_total, etc. So,

P_CO = x_CO * 30

P_O2 = x_O2 *30

P_CO2 = x_CO2 *30

So, Kp = (P_CO2) / (P_CO * (P_O2)^0.5 )

Substituting:

Kp = (x_CO2 *30) / [ (x_CO *30) * (x_O2 *30)^0.5 ) ]

Simplify the denominator:

(x_CO *30) * (x_O2 *30)^0.5 = x_CO * x_O2^0.5 * 30 * (30)^0.5 = x_CO * x_O2^0.5 * 30^(3/2)

So,

Kp = (x_CO2 *30) / (x_CO * x_O2^0.5 * 30^(3/2)) )

Simplify 30 / 30^(3/2) = 1/30^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(30).

So,

Kp = (x_CO2) / (x_CO * x_O2^0.5 ) * (1/sqrt(30)) ).

Hmm, but without knowing Kp, this doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I can use the relation between Kp and Kc, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that at high temperature, the reaction doesn't proceed much, so the amount of CO2 formed is limited, which would mean that the mole fraction of CO2 isn't too high.

Looking at the options, the mole fractions for CO2 vary from 0.25 to 0.335. Since the temperature is very high, I might expect lower CO2 because the reverse reaction is favored.

So perhaps the CO2 mole fraction is lower, which would point to options with lower CO2. Let's look:

Option A: CO2 0.30

B: 0.26

E: 0.25

I: 0.287

J: 0.335

Hmm, but 3000 K is quite high, so maybe CO2 is lower. So perhaps option E, which has 0.25 CO2, might be a candidate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the stoichiometry. The ratio of O to C is 5:1. Let's calculate the O/C ratio for each option to see which fits.

Wait, but each option gives mole fractions, so I can calculate the O/C ratio from that.

Wait, each mole of CO contributes 1 O, CO2 contributes 2 O, and O2 contributes 2 O per molecule. So, the total O atoms would be:

O_total = (x_CO *1) + (x_CO2 *2) + (x_O2 *2)

And the C is x_CO + x_CO2.

So, O/C ratio is [x_CO + 2x_CO2 + 2x_O2] / (x_CO + x_CO2) = 5.

Let me plug in the values from each option and see which one gives a ratio of 5.

Let's check option D:

x_CO=0.0891, x_O2=0.615, x_CO2=0.296.

O_total = 0.0891*1 + 0.296*2 + 0.615*2 = 0.0891 + 0.592 + 1.23 = 0.0891 + 0.592 is 0.6811 +1.23 = 1.9111.

C_total = 0.0891 + 0.296 = 0.3851.

O/C ratio =1.9111 / 0.3851 ≈ 4.964, which is approximately 5. Close enough, considering rounding.

Now, let's check option D's O/C ratio is nearly 5. So maybe that's the correct option.

Let's check another option for sanity. Option H: x_CO=0.091, x_O2=0.61, x_CO2=0.29.

O_total= 0.091 + (0.29*2) + (0.61*2) = 0.091 + 0.58 + 1.22= 1.891.

C_total=0.091 +0.29=0.381.

O/C ratio=1.891/0.381≈4.96, which is also close to 5. So both D and H are close. Hmm.

Wait, why are multiple options close? Perhaps because the O/C ratio is a necessary condition but not sufficient. We also need to consider the equilibrium condition.

Wait, but if both D and H satisfy the O/C ratio, then the correct answer must be determined by other means, perhaps the equilibrium constant.

Wait, but without knowing K, how can I decide between D and H?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me recheck option A:

Option A: x_CO=0.099, x_O2=0.60, x_CO2=0.30.

O_total=0.099 + (0.3*2) + (0.6*2)=0.099+0.6 +1.2=1.899.

C_total=0.099 +0.3=0
