Okay, so I've got this economics question here about cross-price elasticity of demand. Hmm, cross-price elasticity, right. I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in some other variable, like price in this case.

Wait, cross-price elasticity specifically looks at how the quantity demanded of one good reacts when the price of another good changes. The formula is E = (percentage change in Qd of good A) / (percentage change in price of good B). 

Now, the question says when this elasticity is negative, what does that mean about the goods. So, I need to think about what a negative value implies. Oh right, elasticity can be positive or negative. If it's negative, that means when the price of good B goes up, the quantity demanded of A goes down, or vice versa. Wait, how does that work?

Oh, right! If two goods are substitutes, like coffee and tea, when the price of coffee goes up, people might buy more tea. So the quantity demanded of tea increases when coffee prices rise. That would make the cross-price elasticity positive because both percentage changes are in the same direction. Wait, no, hold on. If the price of good B increases and quantity demanded of A increases, then both numerator and denominator are positive, so E is positive. So substitutes have positive cross-price elasticity.

What about complements? Like cars and gasoline. If the price of cars goes up, people might buy fewer cars, which would mean they buy less gasoline as well. So if the price of cars (good B) increases, the quantity demanded of gasoline (good A) decreases. So the percentage change in Qd of A is negative, and the percentage change in price of B is positive. So E would be negative. Oh, right! So complements have negative cross-price elasticity.

So the question says when cross-price elasticity is negative, the goods are necessarily what? So the answer would be complements. Looking at the options, J is complements. So the answer is J.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me think of an example. Suppose the cross-price elasticity of apples and oranges is positive. That would mean that when orange prices go up, apple demand increases, implying they're substitutes. But if the elasticity is negative, like with bread and butter, when bread prices rise, demand for butter might fall because people buy less bread, so they need less butter. So yes, complements would have negative elasticity.

So the correct answer is J: complements.

When analyzing cross-price elasticity of demand, a negative value indicates that the quantity demanded of one good decreases in response to an increase in the price of another good. This relationship is characteristic of complementary goods, which are typically consumed together. For example, if the price of cars (good B) increases, the demand for gasoline (good A) also decreases because fewer cars are purchased, reducing the need for gasoline. 

In contrast, substitute goods exhibit positive cross-price elasticity because an increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in the demand for its substitute. Therefore, when cross-price elasticity is negative, the goods in question are necessarily complements.

The correct answer is **J: complements**.
