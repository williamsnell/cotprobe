Okay, so I've got this problem about the evaporation of n-butanol from a cylindrical vessel. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

Alright, the setup: the vessel has a diameter of 7.0 feet. It's filled with pure n-butanol up to a level that's 2.5 feet below the open top. So the air space above the liquid is 2.5 feet deep. The temperature is 77.0°C, and the pressure is 1 atm. The diffusivity of n-butanol in air under these conditions is 0.438 ft²/hr. We need to find the rate of evaporation at steady state.

Wait, I remember that evaporation rates can often be calculated using diffusion equations. Maybe Fick's Law of diffusion applies here. Fick's Law in one dimension is usually J = -D * (dc/dx), where J is the flux, D is the diffusivity, and dc/dx is the concentration gradient.

But wait, since it's a steady-state condition, the flux should be constant across the boundary layer. So maybe we can model this as diffusion through a stagnant air layer above the liquid. Oh right, the problem says the air inside the tank is stationary, but there are currents above that keep the concentration of n-butanol negligible. So essentially, the concentration at the top of the vessel (boundary) is zero, and at the surface of the liquid, it's the saturation concentration.

So the concentration gradient would be from the liquid surface (where concentration is the saturation value) to the top of the vessel (where concentration is zero). The distance over which this gradient occurs is the 2.5 feet of air above the liquid.

I think the formula we'll use is something like the mass transfer rate = (diffusivity * area * (concentration difference)) / (distance). So in equation form, that would be N = (D * A * (C_s - C_0)) / (L), where C_s is the concentration at the surface and C_0 is the concentration far away (which is zero here).

Wait, but wait. I think the correct formula is N = (D * A * (C_s)) / L, since C_0 is zero. So yes, that makes sense.

Now, I need to find the concentration of n-butanol at the surface, C_s. C_s would be the saturation concentration of n-butanol in air at 77°C. Hmm, I'm not given the vapor pressure of n-butanol at this temperature. Wait, maybe I can calculate it using the Antoine equation. Or perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas law to find C_s.

Wait, wait. The problem says the system is at 1 atm. The pure n-butanol is in the tank, so its vapor pressure at 77°C is probably given elsewhere, but I don't have it here. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to look it up, but since this is a thought process, I'll proceed with what I have.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to calculate the molar concentration using the ideal gas law. Oh right, the concentration C_s is the molar density of the n-butanol vapor at the surface. So, using PV = nRT, the concentration would be n/V = P/(RT).

Wait, but what's the partial pressure of n-butanol at the surface? Since it's pure n-butanol, the vapor at the surface is at the vapor pressure P_sat at 77°C. So the concentration C_s would be P_sat / (RT).

But without the value of P_sat for n-butanol at 77°C, I might be stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides it elsewhere, but in the given question, I don't see it. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps the problem expects me to know or find the vapor pressure.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think. Maybe the problem expects me to use the fact that the concentration is the saturation concentration, which for an ideal gas is P_sat/(RT). But without P_sat, I can't compute it. Oh wait, perhaps the question expects me to use the diffusivity and other given data without needing P_sat? Wait, no, because without concentration, I can't compute the flux.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants me to assume the concentration is zero at the top and C_s at the surface, but without knowing C_s, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem statement again. It says that the air is stationary inside the tank, but currents above it maintain a small enough concentration of n-butanol there to allow it to be neglected. So that sets C_0 (the concentration at the top) to zero.

So, I need to find C_s, the concentration at the surface, which is the saturation concentration of n-butanol at 77°C.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 77°C. Let me think. Alternatively, I can look up the Antoine equation parameters for n-butanol.

The Antoine equation is: log10(P) = A - (B/(T + C)), where P is in mmHg, and T is in °C.

Looking up the Antoine constants for n-butanol, I find that A = 4.4425, B = 1641.1, C = 45.95. So, for T = 77°C,

log10(P_mmHg) = 4.4425 - (1641.1)/(77 + 45.95)
= 4.4425 - (1641.1)/122.95
Let me compute 1641.1 / 122.95. Let's see: 122.95 * 13 = 1597.35. 1641.1 - 1597.35 = 43.75. So 13 + 43.75/122.95 ≈ 13.356. So log10(P) ≈ 4.4425 - 13.356 ≈ -8.9135. So P_mmHg = 10^(-8.9135) ≈ 1.23e-9 mmHg? That can't be right. Wait, that doesn't make sense because n-butanol's vapor pressure is higher than that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it more carefully:

Compute denominator: T + C = 77 +45.95 = 122.95.

So B/(T + C) = 1641.1 / 122.95 ≈ let's compute 1641.1 ÷ 122.95.

122.95 * 13 = 1597.35, as before.

1641.1 - 1597.35 = 43.75.

So 43.75 / 122.95 ≈ 0.356.

So total is 13.356.

So log10(P) = 4.4425 -13.356 = -8.9135.

So P = 10^(-8.9135) mmHg. 10^(-8) is 1e-8, 10^(-9) is 1e-9. -8.9135 is between 8 and 9, so 10^(-8.9135) is about 1.23e-9 mmHg. That seems way too low. Wait, that can't be right because n-butanol's vapor pressure is much higher. Wait, perhaps the Antoine constants I'm using are incorrect. Let me check another source.

Wait, I think I might have the wrong Antoine constants. Let me look them up again. Oh wait, perhaps the units are in different terms. Another source says for n-butanol, the Antoine constants are A=4.42447, B=1351.0, C=49.29, where P is in kPa and T is in °C.

Wait, that might be better. Let me try that.

So log10(P_kPa) = 4.42447 - (1351.0)/(77 +49.29)

T + C =77 +49.29 = 126.29

So 1351.0 /126.29 ≈ 10.7 (because 126.29 * 10 = 1262.9, 126.29 *10.7 = 1262.9 + (0.7 *126.29)= 1262.9 + 88.3 = 1351.2, which is very close to 1351. So 1351/126.29 ≈10.7.

So log10(P_kPa) = 4.42447 -10.7 = -6.27553

So P_kPa = 10^(-6.27553) ≈ 5.34e-7 kPa. Wait, but that's even worse, because 5e-7 kPa is 5e-7 * 10^3 Pa = 5e-4 Pa, which is way too low. That's impossible because n-butanol's vapor pressure at, say, 20°C is about 0.8 mmHg, which is 0.001 kPa. So at 77°C, it's definitely higher.

Wait, perhaps the Antoine equation I have is for a different unit. Let me make sure. Another source says:

Antoine equation parameters for n-butanol (CAS 71-36-3):

A = 4.4425

B = 1641.1

C = 45.95

and the equation is for log10(P) where P is in mmHg, and T is in °C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recalculate.

Compute log10(P_mmHg) = 4.4425 - (1641.1)/(77 +45.95) =4.4425 - (1641.1/122.95)

Compute 1641.1 ÷ 122.95:

122.95 * 13 = 1597.35

1641.1 -1597.35 = 43.75

So 43.75 ÷ 122.95 = 0.356 approx.

So total is 13.356.

So log10(P_mmHg) = 4.4425 -13.356 = -8.9135

So P_mmHg = 10^(-8.9135) ≈ 1.23e-9 mmHg? That can't be right because, as I said earlier, n-butanol's vapor pressure is much higher than that. Wait a second, perhaps the Antoine equation I have is for the wrong substance. Wait, maybe I should double-check the Antoine constants.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 77°C from a table. Let me think: n-butanol has a boiling point of about 117.7°C at 760 mmHg. So at 77°C, which is below its boiling point, the vapor pressure should be lower than 760 mmHg but certainly higher than zero.

Wait, maybe using the Antoine equation isn't the right approach, or perhaps I'm using the wrong parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know the vapor pressure at 77°C. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the vapor pressure in another way, but I don't see it in the question.

Wait, perhaps I can find the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 77°C using another method. Alternatively, maybe I can proceed without it, but that seems difficult.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the concentration at the surface is the saturation concentration, which is proportional to the vapor pressure. So, perhaps C_s = P_sat / (R T), where R is the gas constant in appropriate units.

But without knowing P_sat, I can't compute C_s. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, perhaps considering the vessel as a cylinder and calculating the surface area. Oh wait, the diameter is 7.0 ft, so radius is 3.5 ft. The surface area would be the area of the liquid surface, which is a circle with area π r².

So, area A = π (3.5 ft)² = π * 12.25 ft² ≈ 38.4845 ft².

Now, the depth of the air above the liquid is 2.5 ft. So the thickness of the stagnant layer is 2.5 ft.

So, the flux J would be (D * (C_s - C_0)) / L. But C_0 is zero, so J = D * C_s / L.

Then the total molar flux N would be J * A = (D * C_s / L) * A.

But without C_s, I can't compute this. So I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas law. So, the concentration C_s at the surface is the molar density, which is n/V = P/(RT).

But P is the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 77°C. Since I can't find that, perhaps I should proceed with the given data and see if there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that I don't need to compute C_s, but perhaps the options are given in a way that using the given data can lead to the answer. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the formula again. The rate of evaporation (molar flux) is given by N = (D * A * C_s) / L.

But without C_s, perhaps the problem expects me to use the fact that the vessel is open to the atmosphere, so the vapor pressure is negligible, which would make C_s the vapor pressure at the temperature, but again, I don't have that value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the saturation concentration in terms of the density of n-butanol. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that C_s is the molar concentration of n-butanol vapor at 77°C and 1 atm, which is P_sat / (RT).

But then, I need to find P_sat for n-butanol at 77°C. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides it, but I don't see it.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by making an assumption. Let me think: n-butanol's vapor pressure at 77°C is perhaps around 40 mmHg. I remember that at lower temperatures, the vapor pressure is lower, but at higher temps, it's higher. At 77°C, maybe around 40 mmHg. Let's say P_sat = 40 mmHg. Then, converting that to atm: 1 atm = 760 mmHg, so 40 mmHg = 40/760 atm ≈ 0.05263 atm.

So, C_s = P_sat / (R T).

Wait, R is the gas constant. In units of ft·lb/(mol·R), R is approximately 10.7316 ft·lb/(mol·R).

Wait, no, I think the value is 10.7316 (ft·lbf)/(lbmol·R). Wait, let me double-check. The gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Hmm, but I'm working in atm, so perhaps it's better to use R in units of (ft²·lbf)/(lbmol·R) or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use SI units for this calculation, but the problem is given in English units, so I'll have to be careful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use R = 0.7302 ft·atm/(lbmol·R). Wait, let me check: 1 atm is 14.696 psi, and 1 psi is 14.696. So perhaps R is 0.7302 (ft·atm)/(lbmol·R). Because in some references, R is 0.7302 in those units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute C_s in lbmoles per cubic foot.

So, C_s = P_sat / (R T).

P_sat = 40 mmHg = 40/760 atm ≈ 0.05263 atm.

R = 0.7302 ft·atm/(lbmol·R).

Temperature T is 77°C, which is 77 + 459.67 = 536.67 R.

Wait, so C_s = (0.05263 atm) / (0.7302 ft·atm/(lbmol·R) * 536.67 R) )

Let me compute that:

Denominator: 0.7302 * 536.67 ≈ 0.7302 * 536.67 ≈ let's compute 0.7 *536.67 ≈ 375.67, 0.0302 *536.67 ≈ 16.21. So total ≈ 375.67 +16.21 = 391.88.

So C_s = 0.05263 / 391.88 ≈ 0.0001343 lbmol/ft³.

Wait, that's a very small concentration. Hmm, but maybe that's correct.

Now, the area A is π*(3.5)^2 = π*12.25 ≈ 38.4845 ft².

The distance L is 2.5 ft.

Diffusivity D is 0.438 ft²/hr.

Putting it all together, the molar flux N is (D * A * C_s)/L.

So:

N = (0.438 ft²/hr * 38.4845 ft² * 0.0001343 lbmol/ft³) / 2.5 ft.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute numerator: 0.438 * 38.4845 * 0.0001343.

0.438 * 38.4845 ≈ 16.83.

16.83 * 0.0001343 ≈ 0.00226.

Then, divide by 2.5 ft: 0.00226 / 2.5 ≈ 0.000904 lbmol/hr.

Wait, that's 9.04e-4 lbmol/hr. Now, the options are all on the order of 1e-3, so 9e-4 is close to 1e-3.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.508e-3, option B is 2.08e-3, etc.

Hmm, 0.0009 is 9e-4, which is 0.9e-3. So none of the options exactly match, but perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about the vapor pressure of 40 mmHg is incorrect. If I choose a higher vapor pressure, the concentration would be higher, leading to a higher N.

Wait, perhaps I should find the correct vapor pressure for n-butanol at 77°C.

Looking online, n-butanol's vapor pressure at 77°C is approximately 29.
