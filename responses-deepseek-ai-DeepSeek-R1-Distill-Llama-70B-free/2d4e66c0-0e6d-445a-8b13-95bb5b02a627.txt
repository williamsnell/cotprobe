Okay, so I need to figure out what the relation ~ is, given the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and the relation defined as ~ = {(1,2), (1,3), (4,2)}. Let me think through each of the properties step by step.

First, I remember that a relation can have several properties: reflexive, symmetric, transitive, antisymmetric, etc. Let me go through each one.

Reflexive: A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. So for each a in A, (a,a) should be in ~. Looking at ~, I don't see any pairs like (1,1), (2,2), etc. So it's not reflexive. So option F is out.

Symmetric: A relation is symmetric if whenever (a,b) is in ~, then (b,a) is also present. Let's check each pair. We have (1,2), but no (2,1). Similarly, (1,3) has no (3,1), and (4,2) has no (2,4). So it's not symmetric. So option D is incorrect.

Transitive: A relation is transitive if whenever (a,b) and (b,c) are in ~, then (a,c) must be present. Let's see if this applies. Looking at the pairs, do any of them form such a chain? We have (1,2) and (4,2), but there's no (1,4) or (4,1). Wait, another way: (1,2) and (2, something? Well, in ~ there's no (2, anything) except as the second element. So I don't think there's a case where two pairs form a transitive chain. Therefore, transitivity isn't violated, but is it satisfied? Well, since there's no such cases, the relation is vacuously transitive. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because for transitivity, if there are no such pairs where a→b and b→c, then it's automatically transitive. So in this case, since there's no such a, b, c where both (a,b) and (b,c) are in ~, then transitivity holds. So option B might be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's list all the pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (4,2). Is there any (a,b) and (b,c) in the set? For example, if (1,2) and (2, x) existed, but there's no (2, x) here except (4,2) which is (4,2), but 2 is the second element there. So no, there's no such case where a→b and b→c. So yes, the relation is transitive because there's nothing to violate it. So B could be correct.

Next, antisymmetric. A relation is antisymmetric if whenever (a,b) and (b,a) are present, then a = b. Since our relation isn't symmetric, as we saw earlier, this condition doesn't really apply because we don't have any such pairs. So antisymmetric would hold because there are no cases where a≠b and both (a,b) and (b,a) are present. Wait, but the question isn't directly asking about antisymmetric. Option E is about not being antisymmetric, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again. Since there are no such pairs, the relation is antisymmetric by default. So E says it's not antisymmetric, which would be incorrect because it is antisymmetric. So E is incorrect.

Equivalence relation: For a relation to be an equivalence relation, it must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. We've already established it's not reflexive and not symmetric, so it can't be an equivalence relation. So option C is out.

Partial order relation: A partial order must be reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. But since our relation isn't reflexive, it can't be a partial order. So option A is incorrect.

So the options left are B and maybe others. Wait, let me go through each option again.

Option B is "transitive", which I think is correct because there are no cases that break transitivity.

So the correct answer should be option B: transitive.

To determine the nature of the relation ~ on the set \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \), where \( \sim = \{(1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 2)\} \), we analyze the properties of the relation:

1. **Reflexive**: A relation is reflexive if \((a, a) \in \sim\) for all \( a \in A \). Since none of the pairs \((1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)\) are in \(\sim\), the relation is **not reflexive**. Thus, option F is incorrect.

2. **Symmetric**: A relation is symmetric if \((a, b) \in \sim\) implies \((b, a) \in \sim\). For example, \((1, 2) \in \sim\) but \((2, 1) \notin \sim\). Therefore, the relation is **not symmetric**, and option D is incorrect.

3. **Transitive**: A relation is transitive if \((a, b) \in \sim\) and \((b, c) \in \sim\) imply \((a, c) \in \sim\). In this case, there are no pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, c)\) in \(\sim\) such that \(a \neq c\). Thus, the relation is **vacuously transitive**, and option B is correct.

4. **Antisymmetric**: A relation is antisymmetric if \((a, b) \in \sim\) and \((b, a) \in \sim\) imply \(a = b\). Since \(\sim\) is not symmetric, there are no pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) where \(a \neq b\). Therefore, the relation is **antisymmetric by default**, and option E (which states it is not antisymmetric) is incorrect.

5. **Equivalence Relation**: A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Since \(\sim\) is not reflexive or symmetric, it cannot be an equivalence relation. Thus, option C is incorrect.

6. **Partial Order Relation**: A partial order relation must be reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Since \(\sim\) is not reflexive, it cannot be a partial order relation. Thus, option A is incorrect.

The only correct property of the relation \(\sim\) is that it is **transitive**.
