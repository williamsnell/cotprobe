Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about determining the diameter of a shaft that needs to transmit 30 horsepower at 400 rpm. The shaft can be either solid or hollow, and we have some material properties to consider. 

First, I need to remember the formula for power transmission in shafts. I recall that power (P) is related to torque (T) and angular velocity (ω) by the equation P = T * ω. But wait, I think there's another formula that's more directly applicable here, which is the torque equation in terms of shear stress.

The formula for torque is T = (π * d³ * τ) / 16, where d is the diameter, and τ is the shear stress. But wait, since the shaft is made of steel and we're given the ultimate shear stress and a factor of safety, I should consider the allowable shear stress. Oh right, the allowable stress is the ultimate stress divided by the factor of safety. So τ_allowable = τ_ultimate / factor of safety.

Given that τ_ultimate is 60,000 psi and the factor of safety is 5, the allowable shear stress τ would be 60,000 / 5 = 12,000 psi.

Next, I need to calculate the torque. Since power P is given as 30 hp, and it's transmitted at 400 rpm, I can use the formula P = T * ω, but I need to convert the units properly because the standard unit for power in the imperial system is horsepower, and torque is in inch-pounds.

I remember that 1 horsepower is approximately 5250 ft-lbf per minute. Wait, no, wait. Actually, 1 hp is 550 ft-lbf per second, but since rpm is per minute, I might have to adjust. Alternatively, I can use the formula T (in-lb) = (P * 63,025) / rpm. Let me check that. Yes, because 1 hp at 1 rpm is about 63,025 in-lbf. So T = (30 hp * 63,025 in-lb/hp-rpm) / 400 rpm.

Calculating that: 30 * 63,025 = 1,890,750. Divided by 400 gives 4,726.875 in-lb. So T ≈ 4,726.875 in-lb.

Wait, but let me double-check that formula. Another approach is to remember that power P (in hp) can be converted using P = (T * N) / 5250, where T is in ft-lbf and N is rpm. So rearranging, T = (P * 5250) / N. But wait, units might be tricky here. Because 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s, but when using rpm, which is per minute, I need to adjust.

Alternatively, using consistent units: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s = 550 * 60 = 33,000 ft-lbf per minute. So, T (ft-lbf) = (P * 33,000) / N. Then, convert that to inch-pounds because the shear stress is in psi (lb per square inch) and the formula uses inches.

So, for P=30 hp and N=400 rpm:

T = (30 * 33,000) / 400 ft-lbf. Let's compute that. 30*33,000 = 990,000. Divide by 400 gives 2,475 ft-lbf. Now, convert to inch-pounds: 1 ft = 12 inches, so 2,475 ft-lbf = 2,475 * 12 = 29,700 in-lb. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, I must have mixed up the formula earlier.

Wait, which approach is correct? Let me think again. The standard formula is P (hp) = (T (in-lb) * N (rpm)) / 63,025. So solving for T: T = (P * 63,025) / N. So with P=30 and N=400: 30 * 63,025 = 1,890,750; divided by 400, that's 4,726.875 in-lb. So why did the other approach give 29,700 in-lb? Ah, I see, because in the second approach I used ft-lbf and then converted. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula T (in-lb) = (P * 63,025) / N is correct. So the torque is about 4,726.875 in-lb. So that seems right.

Now, with torque known, I can use the torque formula for a solid shaft. The formula is T = (π * d^3 * τ) / 16. I need to solve for d.

So rearranging, d^3 = (16 * T) / (π * τ). Plugging in T = 4,726.875 in-lb and τ = 12,000 psi.

d^3 = (16 * 4726.875) / (π * 12000). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

16 * 4726.875 = let's see: 4726.875 * 16. 4726 *16 = 75,616, and 0.875*16=14, so total 75,630 in-lb.

Denominator: π * 12000 ≈ 3.1416 * 12,000 = 37,699.2 psi.

So d^3 = 75,630 / 37,699.2 ≈ approximately 2.008 cubic inches.

So d ≈ cube root of 2.008 ≈ 1.26 inches. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match that. Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: 1.2 in for solid. Option E: 1.25 in. Option H: 1.125 in. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the torque correctly. Let me recompute using the correct formula.

Alternative approach: Shear stress τ = 16 T / (π d^3). Rearranged to d^3 = 16 T / (π τ).

Given T=4726.875 in-lb, τ=12,000 psi.

So d^3 = (16 * 4726.875) / (π * 12000).

16 * 4726.875 = let's compute: 4726.875 * 16.

Well, 4726 * 16: 4000*16=64,000; 726*16=11,616 → total 75,616. Then 0.875 *16=14 → total 75,616 +14=75,630.

Denominator: π * 12,000 ≈ 37,699.11.

So 75,630 / 37,699.11 ≈ 2.008.

d^3 ≈ 2.008 → d ≈ cube root of 2.008.

Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, so cube root of 2.008 would be a bit more. Let's calculate it precisely.

1.26^3 = 1.26 *1.26=1.5876; 1.5876 *1.26 ≈ 2.000. So 1.26^3 ≈ 2.000, so 1.26 inches is the approximate diameter for the solid shaft.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option E: 1.25 inches. But wait, let me check the options again.

Option E is solid shaft diameter 1.25 in. Option B is 1.2 in.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me check the torque again.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula for torque. Let me re-calculate the torque.

Power P = 30 hp, N = 400 rpm.

The correct formula is T (in-lb) = (P * 63,025) / N.

So 30 * 63,025 = 1,890,750. Divide by 400 gives 4,726.875 in-lb. So that's correct.

So d^3 = (16 * 4,726.875) / (π * 12,000).

Wait, 16 * 4,726.875 = 75,630.

75,630 / (π * 12,000) → 75,630 / 37,699.11 ≈ 2.008.

So cube root is approx 1.26 in.

Looking at the provided answer options:

Option E: solid shaft 1.25 in.

Option B: 1.2 in.

But wait, 1.25 is closer to 1.26 than 1.2 is.

But let's compute more accurately.

Compute 1.25^3: 1.25 *1.25=1.5625, *1.25=1.953125. So 1.25^3=1.9531, which is less than 2.008.

1.26^3= (1.26)^3=?

1.26 *1.26=1.5876. 1.5876 *1.26 ≈ 1.5876*1=1.5876; 1.5876 *0.2=0.31752; 1.5876 *0.06≈0.095256. Total ≈ 1.5876 + 0.31752=1.90512 +0.095256≈2.00037.

So 1.26^3≈2.00037, which is slightly above 2.008? Wait no, 2.00037 is less than 2.008.

Wait, wait, no. I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, our d^3 is 2.008. So 1.26^3=2.00037. So 1.26 gives d^3=2.00037, which is less than 2.008. So we need a slightly larger diameter.

What about 1.27?

1.27^3: 1.27 *1.27 = 1.6129. 1.6129 *1.27 → let's compute.

1.6129 *1 =1.6129, 1.6129 *0.2=0.32258, 1.6129 *0.07≈0.1129. So adding up: 1.6129 +0.32258=1.93548 +0.1129≈2.04838. So 1.27^3≈2.048.

But our required d^3 is 2.008, so 1.27^3 is 2.048, which is larger than 2.008. So the actual diameter is between 1.26 and 1.27 inches.

But looking at the provided answer options, the closest solid diameter is 1.25 in (option E) and 1.2 in (option B). Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should check if the torque was correctly calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is for a hollow shaft. Wait, no, the formula T= (π d³ τ)/16 is for a solid shaft. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the allowable shear stress is different. Wait, the ultimate shear stress is 60,000 psi, factor of safety 5, so allowable is 12,000 psi. That's correct.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the torque calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, another way to compute torque is P = (T × 2πN)/60 → T = (P × 60)/(2πN). But P is in watts, so maybe that's not the right approach. Wait, perhaps I should convert the power to watts first.

Wait, 1 hp = 745.7 W. So 30 hp = 30 * 745.7 ≈ 22,371 W.

Then, torque T = P / ω, where ω is in radians per second. N is 400 rpm = 400 * 2π radians per minute = (400 * 2π) /60 ≈ 41.8879 rad/s.

So T = 22,371 W / 41.8879 rad/s ≈ 534.07 Nm. Then convert Nm to inch-pounds. 1 Nm = 8.8507 in-lb. So 534.07 *8.8507 ≈ 4726 in-lb. So same as earlier. So torque is correct.

So back to d^3 ≈ 2.008 → d≈1.26 in. But the options don't have 1.26. The closest is option E (1.25) and option B (1.2). Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to round up to the nearest standard size, which might be 1.25 inches.

Wait, looking at the options, option E has solid shaft 1.25 in, hollow outer 1.25 in, inner 0.625 in. But let's check the hollow part later.

For the solid shaft, the calculation suggests around 1.26 inches, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I should recheck my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The formula for torque in a solid shaft is T = (π d^3 τ) / 16. Solving for d^3:

d^3 = (16 T) / (π τ).

Plugging in T=4,726.875 in-lb and τ=12,000 psi.

So, 16*4726.875=75,630.

75,630 / (π * 12,000) = 75,630 / (37,699.11) ≈2.008.

So d ≈ cube root(2.008) ≈1.26 inches.

Since none of the options exactly match, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the torque equation differently. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says the shaft has to transmit 30 hp at 400 rpm. So the torque is correctly calculated as 4,726.875 in-lb.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to the hollow shaft part, maybe that will shed some light.

For a hollow shaft, the torque equation becomes T = (π (d_o^4 - d_i^4) * τ) / (16 d_o), where d_o is the outer diameter and d_i is the inner diameter. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the formula for torque in a hollow shaft is T = (π (d_o^4 - d_i^4) * τ) / (16 d_o). Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the shear stress in a hollow shaft is given by τ = 16 T (d_o) / (π (d_o^4 - d_i^4)) ). So rearranging to solve for T, but perhaps it's easier to relate the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, the polar moment of inertia J for a hollow shaft is (π/2)(d_o^4 - d_i^4). The torque is T = J * τ / c, where c is the outer radius (d_o / 2). So J = (π/2)(d_o^4 - d_i^4).

Thus, T = ( (π/2)(d_o^4 - d_i^4) ) * τ / (d_o/2) ) → T = (π (d_o^4 - d_i^4) τ ) / (2 d_o).

So T = (π (d_o^4 - d_i^4) τ ) / (2 d_o) → rearranged to solve for d_o.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that for a hollow shaft with ratio k = d_i / d_o = 0.5, we can express d_i = 0.5 d_o.

So substituting d_i = 0.5 d_o into the equation:

T = (π (d_o^4 - (0.5 d_o)^4 ) * τ ) / (2 d_o )

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

d_o^4 - (0.5 d_o)^4 = d_o^4 - (0.0625 d_o^4) )= 0.9375 d_o^4.

So,

T = (π * 0.9375 d_o^4 * τ ) / (2 d_o )

Simplify:

T = (π * 0.9375 d_o^3 * τ ) / 2.

So,

T = (0.9375 * π * d_o^3 * τ ) / 2.

We can solve for d_o^3:

d_o^3 = (2 T) / (0.9375 π τ )

Plugging in T=4,726.875 in-lb and τ=12,000 psi:

d_o^3 = (2 * 4726.875) / (0.9375 * π * 12,000 )

Compute numerator: 2 * 4726.875 = 9,453.75.

Denominator: 0.9375 * π ≈ 2.9452; 2.9452 * 12,000 = 35,342.4.

So,

d_o^3 = 9,453.75 / 35,342.4 ≈ 0.2676.

So d_o ≈ cube root of 0.2676 ≈ 0.645 in? Wait, that can't be right because for a solid shaft, the diameter was around 1.26 in, and a hollow shaft should have a smaller diameter for the same torque, but 0.645 in seems too small. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the substitution. The formula for the hollow shaft after substitution was:

T = (0.9375 * π * d_o^3 * τ ) / 2.

So rearranged:

d_o^3 = (2 T) / (0.9375 π τ )

So plugging in the values:

2 T = 2 *4726.875 = 9,453.75 in-lb.

Denominator: 0.9375 * π * 12,000 ≈ 0.9375 * 3.1416 *12,000.

0.9375 *3.1416 ≈ 2.9452; 2.9452 *12,000 =35,342.4.

So d_o^3 =9,453.75 /35,342.4 ≈0.2676 → d_o ≈ cube root of 0.2676 ≈0.645 in.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because for the same torque, a hollow shaft should have a larger diameter than a solid shaft if it's less strong? Or maybe I messed up the formula.
