Okay, so I have this logic question here about fallacies. Let's see, I need to figure out which fallacy is being described. The question is: Arguing that someone couldn't have done something good because she holds a particular position. Hmm, what's that called?

Wait, I remember that there are several common fallacies. One of them is ad hominem, where you attack the person instead of the argument. But the question is about someone's position, not attacking their character directly.

Oh right, there's also guilt by association. That's when you link someone to a group or position and then assume they have the same flaws. So if someone is in a certain position, you argue that they can't do good because of that position. That sounds like guilt by association because you're associating their ability to do good with their position, not looking at their actual actions.

Let me think about the options given. The options are A through J, but the ones listed are A: Guilt by association, B: False dilemma, C: Reprehensible personality, D: False dichotomy.

Guilt by association is when you discredit someone based on their associations, like being part of a group. So if someone is in a particular job or position, and you argue they can't do something good because of that, it fits. 

False dilemma is when you present only two options as if they're the only possibilities, which doesn't fit here. False dichotomy is similar, I think, but maybe a bit different. Reprehensible personality sounds like it's attacking the person's character, which is more ad hominem.

So the correct answer should be A, guilt by association.

The question asks about a fallacy where someone is argued to be incapable of doing something good solely because of their position. This fits the description of "guilt by association," where a person is discredited based on their association with a particular group or position, rather than evaluating their actions or arguments. 

Among the options provided, A: Guilt by association is the correct answer because it directly relates to discrediting someone based on their position rather than their deeds. The other options, such as false dilemma or false dichotomy, involve presenting limited choices and do not fit the scenario. Reprehensible personality refers to attacking someone's character, which is more aligned with ad hominem, not the case here.
