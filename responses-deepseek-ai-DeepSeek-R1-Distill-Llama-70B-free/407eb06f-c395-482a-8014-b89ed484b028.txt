Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the angle of twist in a shaft. Hmm, I remember that this involves torsion in a shaft, and I think the formula has something to do with shear modulus, power, and some other factors. Let me try to piece this together.

The problem says the power is 30 hp at 150 rpm. Oh wait, power is related to torque and angular velocity. Right, power P is equal to torque T multiplied by angular velocity ω. So P = T * ω. But I need to find the torque first.

Wait, the units are in horsepower and rpm. I might need to convert these into consistent units. I remember that 1 horsepower is about 550 foot-pounds per second, but since we're dealing with torque and angular velocity, maybe I should express everything in terms that work with the modulus given in psi.

So let's see, the power P is 30 hp. Let me convert that to foot-pounds per second. 30 hp * 550 ft-lb/s per hp = 16,500 ft-lb/s.

Angular velocity ω is 150 rpm. I need to convert rpm to radians per second because the formula for torque uses radians. There are 2π radians in one revolution, and one minute is 60 seconds. So ω = 150 rev/min * 2π rad/rev / 60 s/min. Calculating that, 150 * 2π is 300π, divided by 60 gives 5π rad/s. Approximately, 5 * 3.1416 is about 15.708 rad/s.

Now, using P = T * ω, so T = P / ω. So T = 16,500 / 15.708. Let's compute that. 16,500 divided by 15.708... Let's see, 15.708 times 1000 is 15,708. So 16,500 is a bit more than that. 16,500 - 15,708 = 792. So 1000 + (792 / 15.708). 792 /15 is about 52.8, so approximately 1052.8 ft-lb.

Wait, but wait a second. Torque is in foot-pounds, but the shear modulus is given in psi, which is pounds per square inch. Oh right, because the formula for torsion involves the modulus, the length, and the polar moment of inertia.

The formula for angle of twist θ is (T * L) / (G * J), where T is torque, L is the length of the shaft between the pulleys, G is shear modulus, and J is the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, the shaft is 2.5 inches in diameter. So diameter d is 2.5 in. So the radius is 1.25 in. The polar moment of inertia J for a solid shaft is (π/2) * d^4. Wait no, J is (π d^4)/32 * (factor?), wait let me think. For a solid shaft, J is (π d^4)/32. Because I remember for a solid cylinder, J is (π d^4)/32.

So J = (π (2.5)^4 ) / 32. Let me compute that. 2.5^4 is ... 2.5 squared is 6.25, so squared again is 39.0625. So 39.0625 * π is about 122.894. Divided by 32 gives approximately 3.8406 in^4.

Wait, but wait: are the units correct? Because J is in in^4, the torque is in ft-lb, L is in inches? Oh wait, L is the distance between the pulleys, which is 18 inches. So I need to make sure all units are consistent.

Wait, let me make sure about the units. Shear modulus G is given as 11e6 psi, which is pounds per square inch. So all units should be in inches and pounds.

But torque is in ft-lb. So I need to convert that to inch-pounds. Because 1 ft is 12 inches, so 1 ft-lb is 12 in-lb. So the torque I calculated earlier was 1052.8 ft-lb. Multiply by 12 to get in-lb: 1052.8 * 12 = 12,633.6 in-lb.

So now, T is 12,633.6 in-lb, L is 18 inches, G is 11e6 psi, J is 3.8406 in^4.

Putting it all into the formula:

θ = (T * L) / (G * J)

θ = (12,633.6 * 18) / (11e6 * 3.8406)

Compute numerator first: 12,633.6 * 18. Let's see, 12,633.6 * 10 is 126,336, 12,633.6 *8 is 100,908.8. So total is 126,336 + 100,908.8 = 227,244.8.

Denominator: 11e6 * 3.8406 = 11 * 3.8406e6. 11 * 3.8406 is about 42.2466, so 42.2466e6 = 4.22466e7.

So θ = 227,244.8 / 42.2466e6. Let me compute that. 227,244.8 divided by 42,246,600.

Let me write that as 2.272448e5 / 4.22466e7 = approximately 0.0538 radians.

Wait, but the question asks for degrees. So I need to convert radians to degrees. Since 1 radian is about 57.2958 degrees. So 0.0538 * 57.2958 ≈ 3.08 degrees. Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, did I make a mistake in any of the calculations? Let me check.

Wait, the formula for angle of twist is θ = (T * L) / (G * J). Right. Let's recheck the steps.

Power P = 30 hp. 30 * 550 = 16,500 ft-lb/s. Correct.

Angular velocity ω = 150 rpm. 150 * 2π /60 = 5π rad/s. Correct. 5 * 3.1416 is about 15.708 rad/s.

Torque T = P / ω = 16,500 /15.708. Let's compute that more accurately.

16,500 ÷ 15.708 ≈ 1050 ft-lb. Then converting to in-lb: 1050 * 12 = 12,600 in-lb. So that part seems okay.

J for a solid shaft: J = π d^4 /32. So 2.5^4 is 39.0625. Multiply by π gives ~122.894, divided by 32 gives ~3.840 in^4. Correct.

So θ = (12,600 * 18) / (11e6 * 3.840). Let's compute numerator: 12,600 * 18 = 226,800.

Denominator: 11e6 * 3.84 ≈ 42,240,000.

So 226,800 / 42,240,000 = approx 0.005375 radians.

Wait, 0.005375 * (180/π) ≈ 0.005375 * 57.2958 ≈ 0.308 degrees. That's about 0.31 degrees. So answer B.

Wait, why did I get a different number earlier? Oh, because I think I miscalculated the numerator and denominator earlier. Let me compute that again.

Wait, 12,633.6 *18 = ?

Let me compute 12,633.6 * 10 = 126,336.

12,633.6 *8 = let's compute 12,633.6 *8:

12,633 *8 = 101,064, 0.6*8=4.8 → 101,068.8.

So 126,336 + 101,068.8 = 227,404.8 in-lb-inch.

Denominator: 11e6 *3.8406 = 42,246,600.

So 227,404.8 / 42,246,600 = approximately 0.00538 radians.

Multiply by 57.3 to get degrees: 0.00538 * 57.3 ≈ 0.308 degrees. So about 0.31 degrees, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought I got 3 degrees, but that was a miscalculation. So the correct approach gives about 0.31 degrees, which is answer B.

To calculate the angle of twist in the shaft, we use the torsion formula:

\[
\theta = \frac{T \cdot L}{G \cdot J}
\]

### Step 1: Convert power to torque
The power \( P \) is given as 30 hp, which is converted to foot-pounds per second:

\[
P = 30 \, \text{hp} \cdot 550 \, \frac{\text{ft-lb}}{\text{s} \cdot \text{hp}} = 16,500 \, \frac{\text{ft-lb}}{\text{s}}
\]

The angular velocity \( \omega \) is given as 150 rpm, which is converted to radians per second:

\[
\omega = 150 \, \frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}} \cdot \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{\text{rev}} \cdot \frac{1 \, \text{min}}{60 \, \text{s}} = 5\pi \, \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}} \approx 15.708 \, \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}}
\]

Using \( P = T \cdot \omega \), the torque \( T \) is:

\[
T = \frac{P}{\omega} = \frac{16,500}{15.708} \approx 1,050 \, \text{ft-lb}
\]

Convert torque to inch-pounds:

\[
T = 1,050 \, \text{ft-lb} \cdot 12 \, \frac{\text{in-lb}}{\text{ft-lb}} = 12,600 \, \text{in-lb}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate polar moment of inertia
The shaft diameter is \( d = 2.5 \, \text{in} \). For a solid shaft, the polar moment of inertia \( J \) is:

\[
J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32} = \frac{\pi (2.5)^4}{32}
\]

First, calculate \( (2.5)^4 \):

\[
(2.5)^4 = 2.5 \cdot 2.5 \cdot 2.5 \cdot 2.5 = 39.0625
\]

Then:

\[
J = \frac{\pi \cdot 39.0625}{32} \approx 3.8406 \, \text{in}^4
\]

### Step 3: Calculate angle of twist
The length \( L \) between the pulleys is \( 18 \, \text{in} \), and the shear modulus \( G \) is \( 11 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\theta = \frac{T \cdot L}{G \cdot J} = \frac{12,600 \cdot 18}{11 \times 10^6 \cdot 3.8406}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
T \cdot L = 12,600 \cdot 18 = 226,800 \, \text{in-lb-in}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
G \cdot J = 11 \times 10^6 \cdot 3.8406 = 42,246,600
\]

Now divide:

\[
\theta = \frac{226,800}{42,246,600} \approx 0.00538 \, \text{radians}
\]

Convert radians to degrees:

\[
\theta = 0.00538 \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \approx 0.31^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle of twist in the shaft is approximately **0.31 degrees**.

**Answer: B**
