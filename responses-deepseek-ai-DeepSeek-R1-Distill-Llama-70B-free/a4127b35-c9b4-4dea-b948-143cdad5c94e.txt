Question:

A 17-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being stung by a bee. She has mild lightheadedness but no difficulty swallowing. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no urticaria. Bilateral wheezing is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following types of drugs is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

Options:

A: α1-Adrenergic antagonist
B: α1-Adrenergic agonist
C: Non-selective β-Adrenergic antagonist
D: β1-Adrenergic agonist
E: β2-Adrenergic antagonist
F: α2-Adrenergic antagonist
G: β2-Adrenergic agonist
H: Non-selective β-Adrenergic agonist
I: α2-Adrenergic agonist
J: β1-Adrenergic antagonist

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient who was stung by a bee, and I need to figure out the best treatment. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.

The patient is a 17-year-old girl, brought in 15 minutes after the sting. She's experiencing mild lightheadedness but no difficulty swallowing. Her vital signs are a bit elevated: pulse is 100, which is a bit high but not super concerning. Respirations are 30, which is higher than the usual 12-20. Blood pressure is 115/70, which seems normal. 

Looking at her physical exam, there's no urticaria, which is hives. But when they listen to her chest, there's bilateral wheezing. That makes me think of asthma or some kind of airway obstruction. Wheezing is a high-pitched sound during breathing out, typically indicating narrowed airways.

Since she was stung by a bee, this could be an allergic reaction. But the lack of urticaria is interesting. Allergic reactions can vary from mild to severe (anaphylaxis). In this case, she has some symptoms—wheezing and mild lightheadedness—but not all the typical signs of anaphylaxis. Maybe it's a mild allergic reaction or something else.

Wait, anaphylaxis usually presents with more severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, a drop in blood pressure, and possibly hives or swelling. Here, she doesn't have hives, so maybe it's not a full-blown anaphylaxis. But the wheezing suggests some airway involvement. 

So what's the appropriate treatment? Let's think about the options given. The question asks which type of drug is most appropriate.

The options are various adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is commonly used in anaphylaxis. Epinephrine works on both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. It helps relieve bronchospasm (wheezing), reduces swelling, and improves cardiac function.

Looking at the options:

Option G is β2-Adrenergic agonist. Beta-2 agonists, like albuterol, are used for asthma because they relax the muscles around the airways, improving breathing. They specifically target the beta-2 receptors, which are mainly in the lungs.

But in this case, the patient might be having an allergic reaction leading to bronchospasm. So using a beta-2 agonist could help with the wheezing. Alternatively, epinephrine would address more systemic issues, but if the reaction isn't severe, maybe just the bronchospasm needs treatment.

Wait, but the patient's only symptoms are mild lightheadedness and wheezing. No mention of hives, no swelling, no severe respiratory distress beyond wheezing. So perhaps she's not in anaphylaxis but having a localized allergic reaction or asthma attack triggered by the sting.

In that case, using a bronchodilator (beta-2 agonist) would make sense. Beta-2 agonists like albuterol are first-line for acute asthma or wheezing. They cause bronchodilation, relieving the wheezing and shortness of breath.

So looking back at the options, option G is β2-Adrenergic agonist. That seems appropriate here.

But wait, another thought—could epinephrine (which is an alpha and beta agonist) be better? Because in anaphylaxis, epinephrine is first-line. But the question is, is this anaphylaxis? The patient doesn't have all the symptoms. Anaphylaxis typically includes two or more systems: cutaneous (hives, swelling), respiratory (wheezing), cardiovascular (hypotension, tachycardia), or gastrointestinal. Here, she has respiratory (wheezing) and possible mild cardiovascular (pulse 100, which is on the higher side but not super high). Blood pressure is normal, and no hives—so maybe it's a mild reaction without full anaphylaxis.

So if it's not full anaphylaxis, but just bronchospasm, then a beta-2 agonist would be sufficient. Epinephrine would be used if the reaction is more severe or if there's no improvement.

Alternatively, if the wheezing is part of an allergic reaction, some might argue for using epinephrine, but the question is about the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy.

So the options are:

G: β2-Adrenergic agonist. This would be something like albuterol, used for asthma.

H: Non-selective β-Adrenergic agonist. That would be drugs like isoproterenol, which acts on both beta-1 and beta-2. But those are less commonly used now because they can cause more cardiac effects (like increased heart rate and palpitations) since beta-1 is more in the heart.

In this case, since the patient has wheezing and maybe mild tachycardia (pulse 100), a beta-2 selective agonist would be better because it targets the lungs more and has fewer cardiac side effects.

So the best choice is G.

The patient is a 17-year-old girl who was stung by a bee and presents with mild lightheadedness, bilateral wheezing, and slightly elevated vital signs (pulse 100/min, respirations 30/min, blood pressure 115/70 mm Hg). There is no urticaria or difficulty swallowing, and the symptoms do not meet the full criteria for anaphylaxis, which typically involves multiple systems and more severe manifestations. The primary concern here is the wheezing, which suggests bronchospasm or airway constriction.

Given the options, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is a **β2-Adrenergic agonist** (Option G). β2-Adrenergic agonists, such as albuterol, are first-line treatments for acute bronchospasm and asthma because they selectively target β2 receptors in the lungs, causing bronchodilation and relieving wheezing without significant systemic side effects. While epinephrine (a non-selective adrenergic agonist) is used in anaphylaxis, this patient’s symptoms do not indicate a severe allergic reaction requiring epinephrine. Instead, the localized wheezing can be effectively managed with a β2-Adrenergic agonist.

Answer: G
