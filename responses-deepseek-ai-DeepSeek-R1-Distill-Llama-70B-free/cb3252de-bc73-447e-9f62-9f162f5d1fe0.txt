Okay, so I've got this problem here about the volume of alcohol changing with temperature. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that a certain weight of alcohol has a volume of 100 cm³ at 0°C. I need to find out what its volume is at 50°C. Hmm, I remember that most substances expand when heated, so I expect the volume to increase.

Wait, but how do I calculate the change in volume? Oh right, I think it's related to the coefficient of volume expansion. Or wait, maybe it's the coefficient of linear expansion? I'm a bit confused. I think for volume expansion, it's three times the linear expansion coefficient because volume has three dimensions—length, width, and height. So if a material expands in each dimension, the volume expansion would be three times the linear expansion per degree.

So the formula I remember is ΔV = β * V0 * ΔT, where β is the volume expansion coefficient, V0 is the initial volume, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as V = V0 * (1 + β * ΔT). 

But wait, do I know the coefficient for alcohol? I think alcohol, like ethanol, has a specific coefficient. Let me try to recall. I remember that for ethanol, the coefficient of volume expansion is around 0.00075 per degree Celsius. Wait, is that per degree? Or is it per Kelvin? Oh, since Celsius and Kelvin have the same size degrees, it doesn't matter here. 

So the initial temperature is 0°C, and the final is 50°C. So ΔT is 50 - 0 = 50°C. 

Plugging into the formula: V = 100 cm³ * (1 + β * 50). β is 0.00075, so 0.00075 * 50 = 0.0375. Then 1 + 0.0375 = 1.0375. So 100 * 1.0375 is 103.75 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 103.75. The options are A: 100.60, E:102.40, H:103.20, I:105.60, etc. So 103.75 is closest to H:103.20 or maybe something else.

Wait, maybe I got the coefficient wrong. Let me double-check. Oh wait, I think I might have confused the linear and volume coefficients. Oh no, wait, for volume expansion, the coefficient is three times the linear expansion. So, if the linear expansion coefficient (α) is 0.00025, then β would be 3*0.00025 = 0.00075. So that part was correct.

But maybe the coefficient for alcohol is different. Wait, I think for ethanol, the coefficient of volume expansion is about 0.00075 per °C, which is what I used. So the calculation should be correct. So 100 * 1.0375 = 103.75, but none of the options match exactly. Hmm.

Looking at the options again, the closest one is H:103.20. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate. 0.00075 * 50 = 0.0375. So 100 * 1.0375 is 103.75 cm³. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the linear expansion coefficient instead, but that wouldn't make sense because the question is about volume. Oh wait, maybe the question is using the linear expansion coefficient for the volume calculation, which would be incorrect. Or perhaps the coefficient I'm using is not accurate. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes an average expansion coefficient. Wait, maybe the coefficient is 0.00072 per degree, which I've heard somewhere else. Let me try that. 0.00072 * 50 = 0.036. Then 1.036 times 100 is 103.6. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for linear expansion and then cube it, but that's more complicated. Wait, no, the formula for volume expansion is correct. So perhaps the coefficient I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is referring to the expansion from 0 to 50°C, but perhaps alcohol expands more than that. Let me think of another approach. Oh wait, maybe the coefficient is 0.00095 per degree. Let me try that. 0.00095 * 50 = 0.0475. 100 * 1.0475 is 104.75, which is still not matching the options.

Alternatively, could the coefficient be smaller? Let me try 0.0005. 0.0005 *50 = 0.025, so 100 *1.025=102.5. Hmm, that's close to option E:102.40. Wait, maybe 0.00052? 0.00052 *50=0.026. So 100*1.026=102.6, which is closer to 102.6, but the option is 102.40, which is 102.4.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck because I'm not sure of the exact coefficient. Let me try to recall. From what I remember, the coefficient of volume expansion for ethanol is around 0.00075 per °C. So that would give 103.75, but that's not an option. Maybe the problem expects me to use 0.00075 and round to two decimal places, which would be 103.75, but none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is about the mass remaining the same, but volume changing. Oh wait, in the problem statement, it's a certain weight of alcohol. So mass is constant, and we're looking at how volume changes with temperature. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for apparent expansion, but I think that's more for situations when you're measuring the expansion of a liquid in a container. But in this case, it's just the alcohol's expansion.

Wait, maybe I should consider the average coefficient. Suppose the expansion is calculated as 0.75% over 50 degrees, but that would be 75 cm³, which would be 175, which is way higher than any option. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the linear expansion coefficient and then using that to compute volume expansion. Let me see. Suppose the linear expansion coefficient α is 0.00025 per °C. Then β = 3α = 0.00075 per °C, which is what I used. So that leads me back to 103.75.

Wait, perhaps the options are rounded differently. 103.75 is approximately 103.8, but the closest option is H: 103.20. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to use a different coefficient. Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula with an average expansion and uses a different β. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options, option E is 102.40, which is 100*(1 + 0.024) = 102.4. So 0.024 over 50 degrees would imply β = 0.024/50 = 0.00048 per °C. Does that make sense? Is the β for ethanol around 0.00048? I'm not sure, but I think it's higher than that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a β of 0.0004, which would give 100*(1 + 0.0004*50) = 100*(1.02)=102, which is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I've got the formula wrong. Another approach: the change in volume ΔV = V0 * β * ΔT. So if V0 is 100, and ΔV is 100*β*50. So the new volume is 100 + 100*β*50. Let's see what β would make this match one of the options.

Looking at option E:102.40. So ΔV is 2.40. So 100 * β *50 = 2.4 → β = 2.4/(100*50) = 2.4/5000 = 0.00048 per °C. So β is 0.00048. But I thought ethanol's β is around 0.00075. Hmm. So that would suggest that the correct answer is E:102.40 if β is 0.00048. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the expansion of the container as well, but the problem states it's the alcohol's volume, so the container's expansion shouldn't matter.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem uses the linear expansion coefficient of something else, like glass. No, that doesn't make sense because the question is about alcohol.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem uses the formula in a different way. Oh wait, maybe the formula is V = V0 (1 + α ΔT)^3, assuming isotropic expansion. But that's more complicated and would require knowing the linear expansion coefficient. Let me try that approach.

Suppose α is the linear expansion coefficient. Then the volume expansion coefficient β is approximately 3α. So if I know β, I can find it. But without knowing α, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know that for each degree Celsius, the volume increases by a certain percentage.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is using Celsius to Kelvin conversion, but no, the expansion is per degree, so that doesn't matter.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct β for ethanol. Let me try to recall. I think the coefficient of volume expansion for ethanol is higher than water. Water's β is about 0.000207 per °C. Ethanol's is higher, maybe around 0.00075 as I thought earlier. Let me double-check. Oh wait, I think I might be confusing linear and volume coefficients. Let me think: the linear expansion coefficient for ethanol is about 0.00055 per °C, so the volume would be three times that, so 0.00165 per °C. Wait, that can't be right because that would make a much larger expansion. Wait, wait, no, perhaps that's incorrect. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, the linear expansion coefficient (α) is about how much length increases. So for each degree, a 1m bar would increase by α meters per degree. So for ethanol, I think α is approximately 0.00055 per °C, which would make β = 3 * 0.00055 = 0.00165 per °C. But that seems high. So let's plug that in.

So β = 0.00165 per °C. Then ΔT is 50°C. So ΔV = 100 * 0.00165 *50 = 100 * 0.0825 = 8.25 cm³. So new volume is 100 +8.25=108.25 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 108.50, which is close. But wait, 108.25 is not exactly an option, but perhaps due to rounding. So that would suggest option G:108.50. But earlier I thought β was 0.00075.

Wait, now I'm getting confused because different approaches are giving me different results. Let me clarify: what is the correct coefficient of volume expansion for ethanol? I think I might have made a mistake earlier.

After a quick search in my memory, I think ethanol's coefficient of volume expansion is about 0.00075 per °C, which would make the calculation 100 * (1 + 0.00075*50) = 100 * 1.0375 = 103.75 cm³. But this isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the expansion formula for alcohol as 0.00054 per degree. Let's try that. β=0.00054. Then ΔV = 100 * 0.00054 *50 = 100 * 0.027 =2.7 cm³. So new volume is 102.7 cm³, which is around 102.7. The closest option is E:102.40. Hmm, that's a bit off.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using β=0.0004 per °C. Then ΔV=100 *0.0004*50=2 cm³, so 102 cm³, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the average of the expansion. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the concept than exact numbers, and I should pick the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me do the math again. 0.00075 *50 =0.0375, so 100 *1.0375=103.75. So the correct answer should be around 103.75, but none of the options match that. So perhaps the intended answer is E:102.40, but that would require a β of 0.00048, which I'm not sure is correct.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible options. Let me list the options again:

A:100.60 → 0.6% increase → β=0.6/(50*100)=0.00012 per °C → seems too low.

B:125.75 → way too high.

C:120 → 20% increase → β=0.2/50=0.004 → too high.

D:115 → 15% → β=0.003 → too high.

E:102.40 → 2.4% → β=0.00048.

F:110 → 10% → β=0.002 → too high.

G:108.50 → 8.5% → β=0.0017 → close to what I thought earlier if β was 0.00165.

H:103.20 → 3.2% → β=0.000064 per °C → Wait, wait, 3.2% over 50 degrees would be β=0.064/50=0.00128 per °C. Wait, no. Wait, 3.2% is 0.032, so 0.032/50=0.00064 per °C. That would make β=0.00064.

Wait, but I thought ethanol's β was 0.00075. So perhaps the intended answer is E:102.40, which uses β=0.00048, but I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the linear expansion coefficient for ethanol, which is around 0.00055 per °C, but for volume, it's 3 times that, so 0.00165 per °C, leading to a volume increase of 8.25%, which would be 108.25 cm³, closest to option G:108.50. But earlier I thought that made the volume too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again. If the correct β is 0.00075, then the volume would be 103.75, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option E:102.40, using a β of 0.00048. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use β=0.0004, leading to 102 cm³, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the expansion is calculated differently, like using the average temperature or something else. Wait, no, the formula is straightforward.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is asking for the change in volume due to the expansion of the container as well. But the question specifies the volume of the alcohol, so the container's material shouldn't matter. Unless it's a case of apparent expansion. Hmm, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using Celsius to Kelvin, but since the change is 50 degrees, it doesn't affect the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the linear expansion applied three times. Let's try that. Suppose the linear expansion is α, then volume expansion is approximately 3α. So if the problem gives the linear expansion, but I'm supposed to calculate the volume. But the problem doesn't give any coefficients, so I must rely on known values.

Given all this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is E:102.40, which is a 2.4% increase. So 0.024/50=0.00048 β. But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I:105.60, which is a 5.6% increase, implying β=0.0056/50=0.000112 per °C, which seems too low.

Wait, I think I'm stuck because I can't recall the exact β for ethanol. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem expects me to know that the expansion is about 103.2, which is option H. Alternatively, perhaps the β is 0.00064, leading to 103.2.

Wait, another approach: let's see what each option implies for β.

Option E:102.40 → ΔV=2.40 → β=2.40/(100*50)=0.00048.

Option H:103.20 → β=3.20/(100*50)=0.00064.

Option G:108.50 → β=8.50/(100*50)=0.0017.

Which of these is closer to ethanol's β? I think ethanol's β is around 0.00075, so 0.00064 is closer to that than 0.00048. So option H would be 103.20, which is 3.2% increase. Let's calculate that.

β=0.00064 → ΔV=100 *0.00064 *50=3.2 → V=103.2. So that matches option H. So perhaps the intended answer is H.

But wait, I thought ethanol's β was 0.00075, but maybe in the problem, it's considered as 0.00064. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses an approximate value.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the correct answer is E:102.40, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible coefficients again. For water, β is about 0.000207. For ethanol, it's higher. Let me see, if ethanol's β is 0.00075, then the volume would be 103.75, which isn't an option. But option H is 103.20, which is
