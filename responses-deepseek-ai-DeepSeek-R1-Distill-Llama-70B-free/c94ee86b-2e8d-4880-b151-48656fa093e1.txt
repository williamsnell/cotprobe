Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing and sampling methods. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is asking which sampling method an auditor would use to estimate a numerical measurement of a population, specifically the dollar value of inventory. The options are A through J, each a different sampling method.

First, I need to understand what each sampling method entails. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A is Variable sampling. I remember that variable sampling involves measuring a numerical characteristic of a population. Like, if you want to know the total dollar amount or the average value. So this seems relevant because the question is about the dollar value of inventory, which is a numerical measurement.

Option B is Discovery sampling. I think this is used to find at least one instance of something, like detecting fraud. If the auditor is looking for any case of something, like a material error, they'd use discovery sampling. But the question isn't about finding a specific instance; it's about estimating a value. So probably not B.

Option C is Snowball sampling. I recall this is a non-probability method where existing subjects recruit others. It's more common in social sciences or when the population is hard to reach. Doesn't seem relevant here since we're dealing with inventory dollars. So C is likely out.

Option D is Stratified sampling. This involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) and then sampling from each. It's useful when the population has distinct groups that might vary a lot. For example, stratifying inventory by high-value and low-value items. This could help in getting a more accurate estimate because each subgroup is more homogeneous. So D is a possibility.

Option E is Systematic sampling. This method involves selecting every nth individual from a population list. Like picking every 10th item. It's simple but might not be the best for numerical estimation unless the list is ordered in a way that doesn't introduce bias. Not sure if it's the best fit here, but possible.

Option F is Attribute sampling. Attribute sampling is about testing for a specific attribute or characteristic, like whether an item is defective or not. It's more about yes/no or binary attributes. Since the question is about a dollar value, which is numerical, F doesn't seem right.

Option G is Random-number sampling. I think this is a type of simple random sampling where each member has an equal chance of being selected. It's good for generalizability but might not be the most efficient for estimating a total value, especially if there's variability in the population. Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the best option here.

Option H is Quota sampling. This is a non-probability method where you select samples based on certain criteria to match the population's characteristics. It's often used in market research but not really for precise numerical estimates in auditing. So probably not H.

Option I is Cluster sampling. This involves dividing the population into clusters and randomly selecting some clusters to sample. It's useful when the population is spread out, but for inventory, which is probably in one place, cluster sampling might not be the best approach. Unless the inventory is in different locations, but the question doesn't specify that. So I might rule this out unless I'm missing something.

Option J is Convenience sampling. This is when you pick samples based on ease of access. It's not random and can introduce a lot of bias. Auditors need reliable data, so they probably wouldn't use this method for estimating something as important as inventory value. So J is likely incorrect.

Now, going back to the main question: estimating a numerical measurement like dollar value of inventory. I think variable sampling (A) and stratified sampling (D) are the top contenders.

Variable sampling is specifically about estimating numerical values. It allows the auditor to estimate the total or average value of a population. For example, if they want to know the total inventory value, variable sampling would give them that estimate based on a sample.

Stratified sampling could also help in this scenario. By dividing the inventory into high-value and low-value items, the auditor can ensure that each stratum is adequately represented. This might lead to a more precise estimate because the variability within each stratum is lower. But stratified sampling is more about improving the accuracy of the sample by breaking the population into homogeneous subgroups.

So the question is whether the primary purpose is to estimate a numerical value or to improve the sample's precision by stratification.

Variable sampling is directly aimed at measuring a numerical characteristic, so it's likely the correct answer. Stratified sampling is a method that can be used in conjunction with variable sampling, perhaps, but the question is asking which method is used for the purpose of estimating the numerical measurement.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is A: Variable sampling.

To determine which sampling method an auditor would use to estimate a numerical measurement of a population, such as the dollar value of inventory, it is important to evaluate the purpose and characteristics of each method:

- **A: Variable sampling** is specifically designed to estimate numerical measurements, such as totals or averages, making it highly relevant for estimating the dollar value of inventory.  
- **B: Discovery sampling** is used to detect at least one instance of a specific characteristic, not to estimate numerical values.  
- **C: Snowball sampling** is a non-probability method used to recruit subjects from hard-to-reach populations, which is unrelated to estimating inventory values.  
- **D: Stratified sampling** involves dividing the population into subgroups to improve accuracy. While useful, it is not specifically aimed at numerical estimation.  
- **E: Systematic sampling** involves selecting every nth individual, which is less precise for numerical estimation unless the population list is ordered appropriately.  
- **F: Attribute sampling** tests for binary characteristics, not numerical values.  
- **G: Random-number sampling** provides generalizability but is not the most efficient for numerical estimation.  
- **H: Quota sampling** is a non-probability method used in market research, not for precise numerical estimates.  
- **I: Cluster sampling** involves sampling clusters, which is less relevant for inventory estimation unless the inventory is spread across multiple locations.  
- **J: Convenience sampling** is based on ease of access and introduces bias, making it unsuitable for auditing purposes.  

Given the focus on estimating a numerical measurement, **variable sampling (A)** is the most appropriate method as it directly measures numerical characteristics like the dollar value of inventory.
