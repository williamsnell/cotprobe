Question:

A buyer signed a contract to purchase a tract of land from a seller. The contract was signed on May 1, 2006, and the closing is set for June 15, 2006. The land was located in a jurisdiction that has in force the following statute:Statute of Limitations "an action to recover the possession of land shall be brought within twenty- one (21) years after the cause thereof accrued, but if a person who is entitled to bring such action at the time the cause accrued is within the age of minority (under 21) or of unsound mind, such action may be brought within ten (10) years after such disability is removed. "This statute was enacted in the jurisdiction in 1930. The land in question had been owned by a rancher in 1960. On September 1, 1960, the rancher died intestate, leaving his nephew as his only heir. The nephew had been born on October 1, 1954. In addition, there is a deed from the rancher's administrator to the seller dated November 1, 1960, which the latter recorded on the same date. During his title search, the buyer learned that the administrator had never obtained any license to sell the land in question; and also he (the administrator) never formally received the approval of any court with respect to the administration of the rancher's estate. Moreover, the buyer ascertained that the seller entered into possession of the land in question on November 1, 1960. On the assumption that there are no additional facts, the buyer should be advised that the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question

Options:

Okay, so I've got this question about property law and the statute of limitations. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the scenario is about a buyer who signed a contract to purchase land from a seller. The contract is dated May 1, 2006, and the closing is set for June 15, 2006. The land is in a jurisdiction with a specific statute of limitations regarding actions to recover land. The statute says that such an action must be brought within 21 years after the cause arises. But if the person entitled to bring the action is a minor (under 21) or of unsound mind, they can bring it within 10 years after the disability is removed. This statute was enacted in 1930.

Now, the land was owned by a rancher who died intestate on September 1, 1960. His only heir is his nephew, born on October 1, 1954. So the nephew was just about 6 years old when the rancher died. The rancher's administrator sold the land to the seller via a deed dated November 1, 1960, and the seller recorded it the same day. The buyer did a title search and found that the administrator never got a license to sell the land and didn't get court approval for the estate administration. Also, the seller took possession on November 1, 1960.

The question is asking when the seller became or will become the owner of the land. The options are from A to J.

Wait, so the key issues here are about the validity of the sale by the administrator and the potential claims by the nephew, considering the statute of limitations.

First, I need to figure out if the administrator had the authority to sell the land. Normally, an administrator of an estate has to follow certain procedures, like getting court approval for selling estate assets. If they didn't get that approval, the sale might be invalid or voidable. But in some cases, even if the sale was improper, if the buyer (here, the seller in the current transaction) held the property in good faith and without knowledge of any defects, they might gain title through adverse possession or under the statute of limitations.

So, the rancher died in 1960, and the administrator sold the land without proper authority. The nephew was a minor at that time, so his ability to challenge the sale would be affected by the statute of limitations.

The statute of limitations here is 21 years from when the cause of action arose. But if the person entitled to bring the action is a minor or has a disability, they have 10 years after the disability is removed.

The cause of action for the nephew would likely be when the rancher died, and the administrator sold the land without authority. So the cause arose in 1960 when the sale happened. But since the nephew was a minor (born 1954, so 6 in 1960), his deadline would be when he turns 21 plus 10 years.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The statute says that if the person is a minor when the cause arises, they can bring the action within 10 years after the disability is removed. So the cause of action accrued in 1960 when the administrator sold the land without authority. But the nephew was a minor, so his time to sue would be 10 years after he turns 21.

He was born in 1954, so he turns 21 on October 1, 1975. Then, 10 years after that would be October 1, 1985. But wait, the statute of limitations is 21 years from when the cause arose, regardless of minority, but if minority, the 10 years after coming of age applies.

Wait, no, the statute says that the action must be brought within 21 years after the cause accrued. But if the person is under 21 or of unsound mind at the time the cause accrued, they can bring it within 10 years after the disability is removed.

So, for the nephew, the cause accrued in 1960. But he was a minor then. So he has 10 years after he turns 21 to bring the action. So 1975 (when he's 21) plus 10 years is 1985. So the latest he could bring an action is 1985.

If he doesn't bring an action by then, the seller's title becomes secure. So the seller would become the owner when the statute of limitations runs out, which would be 1985.

Wait, but when does the statute of limitations actually expire? Let's calculate the exact dates. The cause accrued on November 1, 1960. Normally, the statute would run 21 years from that date, so November 1, 1981. But because the nephew was a minor, he gets 10 years after turning 21. He turned 21 on October 1, 1975, so 10 years later is October 1, 1985.

So the nephew had until October 1, 1985, to bring an action. If he didn't do so by then, the seller's title is valid, and the nephew can no longer challenge it.

Wait, but the sale by the administrator was without authority. So the nephew, as the heir, had a claim to the land. If he didn't bring an action within the allowed time, the seller's title becomes valid. So the seller would become the owner when the statute of limitations expires, which would be October 1, 1985.

Looking at the options, option F is October 1, 1985. Option H is November 12, 1981. Hmm, where does that come from? Let's see: 21 years from November 1, 1960, would be November 1, 1981. But because the nephew was a minor, the period is extended to 1985.

So the correct date when the seller becomes owner is when the statute expires, which is October 1, 1985. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. The cause of action arose in 1960. The nephew was a minor, so his time to sue is 10 years after he turns 21. He turned 21 in 1975, so 10 years later is 1985. So the statute would expire on October 1, 1985. So any action after that date, the seller's title is secure.

So the seller becomes the owner when the statute of limitations runs out, which is option F.

Alternatively, if the nephew doesn't sue by then, the seller's ownership is confirmed. So the correct answer is F.

The question revolves around determining when the seller became or will become the owner of the land, given the circumstances of the sale and the applicable statute of limitations. The key facts are as follows:

1. **Statute of Limitations**: The jurisdiction's statute of limitations allows an action to recover land to be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrued. However, if the person entitled to bring the action is a minor (under 21) or of unsound mind at the time the cause accrued, they have 10 years after the disability is removed to file the action.

2. **Facts of the Case**:
   - The rancher died intestate on September 1, 1960, leaving the nephew (born October 1, 1954) as the only heir. At the time of the rancher's death, the nephew was 6 years old and thus a minor.
   - The administrator of the rancher's estate sold the land to the seller on November 1, 1960, without obtaining the required license or court approval.
   - The seller recorded the deed on November 1, 1960, and took possession of the land on the same date.

3. **Cause of Action**: The cause of action for the nephew to challenge the validity of the sale arose on November 1, 1960, when the administrator sold the land without proper authority.

4. **Statute of Limitations Analysis**:
   - The nephew, being a minor at the time the cause of action accrued, is entitled to bring the action within 10 years after reaching the age of majority (21). He turned 21 on October 1, 1975, and thus had until October 1, 1985, to bring the action.
   - If the nephew did not bring the action by October 1, 1985, the seller's title to the land would become secure, as the statute of limitations would have expired.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A (June 15, 2006)**: Incorrect. This is the closing date of the current sale and has no bearing on when the seller became the owner.
   - **Option B (When the nephew reached the age of 21)**: Incorrect. The nephew's reaching the age of majority only starts the 10-year period for him to bring an action, but it does not determine when the seller became the owner.
   - **Option C (When the administrator received court approval for the sale)**: Incorrect. The administrator never received court approval, and this is irrelevant to the seller's ownership.
   - **Option D (May 1, 2006)**: Incorrect. This is the date the buyer signed the contract and has no bearing on the seller's ownership.
   - **Option E (September 1, 1960)**: Incorrect. This is the date of the rancher's death, but the seller did not acquire ownership on this date.
   - **Option F (October 1, 1985)**: Correct. This is the date when the statute of limitations expired, after which the seller's title became secure.
   - **Option G (When the statute of limitations expired)**: Incorrect. While this is a correct statement, the specific date is October 1, 1985, making Option F the better answer.
   - **Option H (November 12, 1981)**: Incorrect. This date is 21 years after the cause of action accrued, but the nephew's minority extends the period until October 1, 1985.
   - **Option I (When the nephew dies)**: Incorrect. The nephew's death is irrelevant to the determination of the seller's ownership.
   - **Option J (November 1, 1960)**: Incorrect. This is the date of the sale, but the seller did not acquire secure ownership until the statute of limitations expired.

**Conclusion**: The seller became the owner of the land on October 1, 1985, when the statute of limitations expired and the nephew's ability to challenge the sale was barred.
