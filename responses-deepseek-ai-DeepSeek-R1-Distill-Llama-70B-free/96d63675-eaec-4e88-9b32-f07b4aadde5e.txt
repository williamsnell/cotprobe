Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking about a measure that would help determine how likely employees are to stay on the job long-term. Hmm, that's about employee retention, I think.

The options are A through J, each representing different factors. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A is job productivity. That's about how much work someone does. I guess if someone is really productive, maybe they're happy, but does that directly relate to them staying? I'm not sure. High productivity might mean they're good at their job, but maybe they get promoted or leave for better opportunities. So maybe not the best measure.

Option B is salary. Well, salary is important. People might stay if they're paid well. But wait, the question is about a measure, like a survey or an assessment. Salary is more of a factor than a measure. So maybe not B.

Option C is motivation. Motivation can definitely affect how long someone stays. If an employee is motivated, they might be more engaged and less likely to leave. But is motivation the best measure here? I'm not certain. It's a bit broad, maybe.

Option D is previous employment history. That makes sense. If someone has a history of staying at jobs for a long time, they might be more likely to stay again. But the question is about measuring something in the current job. Maybe previous history is useful, but it's more about the past than the present situation.

Option E is age. I don't think age is a direct measure. Older employees might stay longer, but it's not a reliable indicator. Plus, it's not something you can really measure in terms of job aspects.

Option F is ambition. Ambitious people might want to move up, so maybe they don't stay in the same job for too long. That could be the opposite of what we're looking for.

Option G is job satisfaction. Oh, this sounds relevant. If employees are satisfied with their jobs, they're more likely to stay. Job satisfaction is often measured through surveys, so it fits as a measure to determine retention.

Option H is educational background. Not sure how that ties directly to staying on the job. Maybe higher education could mean more opportunities, but it's not a direct measure of intent to stay.

Option I is physical health. Health is important, but maybe more related to absenteeism than retention. Unless we're talking about workplace safety, but that's a stretch.

Option J is intelligence. I don't see a clear link between intelligence and job retention. It's more about ability than intent to stay.

So, putting it all together. The question is about the likelihood of employees staying long-term. Job satisfaction (G) seems like the best fit because satisfied employees are more likely to remain. Previous employment history (D) is about past behavior, which can predict future behavior, but the question is phrased as a measure for determining likelihood, which sounds more like assessing the current situation. So G is probably the right answer.

The correct answer is G: job satisfaction. Job satisfaction directly relates to how content employees are with their current roles, which is a strong indicator of their likelihood to remain on the job long-term. 

Answer: G
