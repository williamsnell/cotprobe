Okay, so I've got this probability problem about poker hands, specifically four of a kind. I'm a bit rusty on my poker probabilities, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that a poker hand consists of 5 cards drawn from a standard 52-card deck without replacement. Four of a kind means having four cards of the same rank and one card of a different rank. 

Let me think about how to calculate this. Probability is usually the number of favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes. 

The total number of possible 5-card hands is the combination of 52 cards taken 5 at a time. I think the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 52 choose 5. Let me calculate that value real quick. But wait, maybe I don't need to compute the exact number because it might cancel out later. 

Now for the favorable outcomes: the number of four-of-a-kind hands. So, how do I compute that? 

Four of a kind requires four cards of the same rank. There are 13 possible ranks in a deck (2 through Ace), so I need to choose one rank out of these 13. Then, for that rank, I need to take all four suits. So that would be 13 choices for the rank. 

Once I have the four cards of the chosen rank, I need the fifth card to be of a different rank. So I can't have another card of the same rank because that would make five of a kind, which isn't possible in a standard deck. Therefore, the fifth card has to be from the remaining ranks. 

How many choices for the fifth card? Well, after choosing the four cards of one rank, there are 48 cards left (since 52 - 4 = 48). Wait, no. Because the fifth card must be a different rank. So the fifth card can't be of the same rank as the four. So for each four-of-a-kind, how many options for the kicker (the fifth card)? 

Alternatively, think of it this way: after selecting the four of a kind, any card that doesn't form another four or a pair would work. So the fifth card's rank must be different. So once you've selected the rank for four of a kind, there are 12 other ranks to choose from. For each of those ranks, there are 4 suits. So the number of possible fifth cards is 12 * 4 = 48. 

So putting it all together, the number of four-of-a-kind hands is: 

Number of ranks for four of a kind: 13 
For each, number of ways to choose the four cards: since there are exactly four suits, it's 1 way (you have to take all four). Or wait, no, for a specific rank, there's only one way to choose all four cards because all four are needed. So 13 * 1 =13. 

Then, for each of these 13, the number of possible fifth cards is 48. So total four-of-a-kind hands: 13 * 48. 

So the probability is (13 *48) divided by (52 choose 5). 

Let me compute this. 

First, compute 52 choose 5. 52C5 is (52*51*50*49*48)/(5*4*3*2*1) = let's calculate that. 

52*51=2652, times 50 is 132600, times 49 is 132600*49. Hmm, 132600 * 50 is 6,630,000, minus 132600 gives 6,497,400. Then, times 48, wait no, wait: wait, 52C5 is 2,598,960. I remember that number; it's a common one in poker probabilities. So denominator is 2,598,960.

The numerator is 13 *48=624. 

So probability is 624 / 2,598,960. Let's compute that. 

I can simplify this fraction. Let's see, 624 divided by 2,598,960. 

Well, 624 ÷ 624 =1, and 2,598,960 ÷624= let's see. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 624 / 2,598,960 = (624 / 624) / (2,598,960 /624)

Wait, 2,598,960 ÷624. Let me do that division. 

624 x 4000 is 2,496,000. Subtracting that from 2,598,960 leaves 102,960. 

624 x 165 = 624*160=99,840 plus 624*5=3,120 → total 102,960. So 4000 + 165=4165. So 624 *4165=2,598,960. So 624/2,598,960 =1/4165≈0.00024. 

Wait, 1/4165 is approximately 0.00024. Wait, let me compute 1 divided by 4165. 

4165 is about 4000, so 1/4000 is 0.00025. So 1/4165 is a bit less, say around 0.00024. 

Wait, but what's 4165 × 0.00024? 4165 * 24e-5 → 4165 * 24 = 100, (wait 4000*24=96,000; 165*24=3,960 → total 99,960) → 99,960e-5 → 0.9996. So 0.00024 would give 0.9996, which is almost 1, so 1/4165 is approximately 0.00024. 

Wait, but let me do precise calculation. 

Compute 624 / 2,598,960. Let me see if I can simplify the fraction. 

Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 48? Let's see: 624 ÷48=13. 2,598,960 ÷48= 2,598,960 /48. 48*54,145= 2,598, 48*54,000=2,592,000. 48*145=6,960. So 54,145 *48=2,592,000+6,960=2,598,960. So denominator is 54,145*48. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of numerator and denominator. 

Numerator: 624. Prime factors: 624 ÷2=312, ÷2=156, ÷2=78, ÷2=39, which is 3*13. So 624=2^4 *3 *13.

Denominator:2,598,960. Let's factor that. 2,598,960 ÷10=259,896. 259,896 ÷2=129,948. ÷2=64,974. ÷2=32,487. Now, 32,487 ÷3=10,829 (since 3*10,829=32,487). 10,829: let's check divisibility. 10,829 ÷7= about 1547, but 7*1547=10,829? 7*1500=10,500; 7*47=329 → 10,500+329=10,829. So 10,829=7*1547. Hmm, but I'm not sure about 1547. Maybe it's prime. 

Wait, but perhaps I should look for common factors between numerator and denominator.

Numerator's prime factors: 2^4 *3 *13.

Denominator: 2^3 * ... ? Let me break it down.

Wait, 2,598,960 = 52!/(47! *5!) ), but perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, 52C5 = 2,598,960.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 624/2598960 step by step.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 624/48=13, 2598960/48=54,145.

So 13/54,145. Now, can I simplify this fraction? Let's see. 13 is a prime number. Does 13 divide 54,145?

Let me check: 54,145 ÷13. 13*4000=52,000 → 54,145-52,000=2,145. 13*165=2,145 (since 13*160=2080, 13*5=65 → 2080+65=2145). So 4000+165=4165. So 54,145=13*4165. Thus, 13/54,145 = 1/4165.

So the probability is 1/4165 ≈ 0.00024. 

Wait, but what's 1/4165? Let me compute it numerically. 

Let me compute 1 ÷4165.

Well, 4165 × 0.00024 = 1 (as I did earlier). So 0.00024.

Looking at the options: 

Options are A:0.00012, B:0.00009, C:0.00015, D:0.00006, E:0.00018, F:0.00024, G:0.00048, H:0.00003, I:0.00036, J:0.00030.

So F is 0.00024. So the correct answer should be F.

To calculate the probability of being dealt a four-of-a-kind in a 5-card poker hand, we start by determining the total number of possible 5-card hands from a standard 52-card deck. This is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{52}{5} = \frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = 2,598,960
\]

Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes for four-of-a-kind hands. Four-of-a-kind requires four cards of the same rank and one card of a different rank. 

1. **Choosing the rank for four-of-a-kind**: There are 13 possible ranks (2 through Ace), so there are 13 ways to choose the rank.

2. **Choosing the fifth card**: After selecting the rank for four-of-a-kind, the fifth card must be of a different rank. There are 12 remaining ranks, and for each rank, there are 4 suits. Thus, there are:

\[
12 \times 4 = 48
\]

3. **Total four-of-a-kind hands**: For each of the 13 ranks, there are 48 possible fifth cards. Therefore, the total number of four-of-a-kind hands is:

\[
13 \times 48 = 624
\]

The probability of being dealt a four-of-a-kind is then the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible 5-card hands:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{624}{2,598,960}
\]

Simplifying this fraction, we find:

\[
\frac{624}{2,598,960} = \frac{1}{4165} \approx 0.00024
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.00024**
