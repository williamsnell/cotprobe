Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a legal issue involving a fortune teller and an elderly woman. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that an elderly woman, worried about her health, visits a fortune teller who claims to be clairvoyant. The fortune teller tells her that if she gives $25,000, she'll live to be 100. The woman pays, but then her doctor says she has a serious heart condition and won't live much longer. Now, she's suing the fortune teller based on deceit.

The question is about whether the woman (plaintiff) should prevail in her claim. The options are A to D, each giving a different condition under which she might win.

First, I need to recall the elements of deceit, which is a type of fraud. Generally, for fraud, the plaintiff must show that the defendant made a false representation of a material fact, which the defendant knew was false or made with reckless disregard for the truth. The plaintiff must have justifiably relied on that representation and suffered damages as a result.

In this case, the fortune teller made a statement: "If you give me $25,000, you will live to be 100." The woman relied on this and paid the money. The key issue is whether this statement constitutes a false representation that the fortune teller knew was false or made recklessly.

Option A says the woman should prevail because she relied to her detriment. But just reliance isn't enough if the fortune teller actually believed what she was saying. Fortune tellers typically claim to have insights, but if they genuinely believe their predictions, even if they're wrong, it's not fraud. So if the fortune teller sincerely thought the woman would live to 100, it's not deceit, even if the prediction was wrong.

Option B states the woman would prevail if the fortune teller didn't honestly believe the woman would live to 100. That makes sense because if the fortune teller knowingly lied, that's fraud. So if the fortune teller had no honest belief, then the statement was a knowing false representation, fulfilling the deceit requirement.

Option C suggests the woman won't prevail unless there was a fiduciary relationship. I don't think that's right because fraud doesn't require a fiduciary relationship. Fiduciary relationships are more relevant in cases involving breaches of duty, like in trusts or partnerships. Here, the issue is about a false statement made to induce payment, which is a fraud issue, not necessarily a fiduciary one.

Option D says the woman won't prevail unless the fortune teller warranted the truth as believed. I'm a bit confused about what this means. A warranty usually implies a guarantee, but in fraud, it's about the knowing falsity. If the fortune teller believed her own prediction, even if it's wrong, there's no fraud. So if the fortune teller didn't make a warranty that it was true, maybe that affects it, but I think the key is whether she lied knowingly.

So putting it together, the woman's case hinges on whether the fortune teller made the statement with knowledge that it was false. If the fortune teller didn't honestly believe the prediction, then she committed fraud. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The case revolves around whether the fortune teller's statement constitutes deceit. For deceit (fraud), the plaintiff must show a false representation of a material fact, knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard, justifiable reliance, and resulting damages. The fortune teller's prediction that the woman would live to 100 in exchange for $25,000 is at issue. If the fortune teller honestly believed the prediction, it isn't fraud. However, if she knowingly lied or acted recklessly, it constitutes deceit.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Reliance alone isn't sufficient; the statement must be a knowing falsehood.
- **Option B**: Correct. If the fortune teller didn't believe her prediction, it fulfills the deceit requirement.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Fraud doesn't require a fiduciary relationship.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The issue is knowing falsity, not whether a warranty was made.

The woman prevails if the fortune teller lacked honest belief in her prediction.

Answer: B
