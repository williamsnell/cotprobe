Okay, so I've got this problem here about the cost of golf balls at a practice range. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that a bucket of 40 golf balls costs $4.00. They want to know how much a bucket of 100 golf balls would cost at the same rate.

Hmm, right, so first I think I need to find the cost per golf ball. That makes sense because if I know how much each ball costs, I can multiply that by 100 to get the total for the larger bucket.

So, the cost per ball would be the total cost divided by the number of balls. The total is $4.00 for 40 balls. Let me write that down: $4.00 divided by 40. Let's do the math. 4 divided by 40 is... 0.10. So that's 10 cents per ball. Oh wait, because 40 times 0.10 is 4. Yeah, that checks out.

Now, if each ball is $0.10, then 100 balls would cost 100 times 0.10. Let me calculate that. 100 times 0.10 is $10.00. So a bucket of 100 should cost $10.00.

Wait, but let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Another way to think about it is using ratios or proportions. If 40 balls cost $4, how much do 100 cost? Let's set it up as a proportion.

So, 40 balls / $4 = 100 balls / X dollars. Wait, no, actually, it's 40 balls correspond to $4, so 100 balls correspond to X. So cross-multiplying, 40 * X = 4 * 100. So 40X = 400. Dividing both sides by 40 gives X = 10. So that's $10.00 again. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A through J. Option E is $10.00. So that's the answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculations seem straightforward. Dividing $4 by 40 gives per ball cost, then multiplying by 100 gives total. Both methods give me $10, so I'm confident that's correct.

To determine the cost of a bucket of 100 golf balls, first calculate the cost per ball. A bucket of 40 balls costs $4.00, so the cost per ball is:

\[
\frac{\$4.00}{40} = \$0.10 \text{ per ball}
\]

Next, multiply the cost per ball by 100 to find the total cost for 100 balls:

\[
100 \times \$0.10 = \$10.00
\]

This confirms that a bucket of 100 golf balls costs \$10.00. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

E: \$10.00
