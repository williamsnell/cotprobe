Okay, so I've got this problem here about BaskowToys Wholesalers offering Captain Kirk dolls to Albee Stores with a certain discount, and I need to find the retail price based on what Albee is paying. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the offer is "25-20% off the retail price." Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what that means. Sometimes, in business terms, numbers like that can represent a series of discounts. Like, maybe 25% off and then an additional 20% off? Or wait, could it be trade terms where 25 is the list and 20 is the discount? I'm a bit confused about that part.

Wait, I remember that sometimes in pricing, especially in wholesale, the terms are written as something like "25-20% off." So the first number, 25, might be the list price, and the next number, 20, is the discount percentage off that list price. So maybe the cost for Albee is calculated by taking 20% off the $25? Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's a chain discount. So first, you take 25% off the retail price, and then you take an additional 20% off the already discounted price. But that seems a bit complicated. Let me try to figure that out.

Wait, the question says that the wholesaler is offering the dolls at 25-20% off the retail price. So when a wholesaler offers this, they're giving a series of discounts. So I think the way it works is that the wholesaler gives a certain percentage off the list price (retail price), and then another percentage off. So if the retail price is, say, R dollars, then the first discount is 25% off, and the second discount is 20% off the new price after the first discount.

Wait, but let me think about this correctly. So, if the retail price is R, then the first discount is 25%, so the price becomes R*(1 - 0.25) = 0.75R. Then, the second discount is 20% off that already discounted price. So the next step is to take 20% off 0.75R. So 20% off would be multiplying by 0.80. So the final price Albee pays would be 0.75R * 0.80.

Let me calculate that: 0.75 * 0.80 = 0.60. So the cost price for Albee is 0.60R. But wait, the problem states that Albee is buying each doll for $2.10. So 0.60R = $2.10. To find R, I can rearrange this equation: R = $2.10 / 0.60.

Calculating that, 2.10 divided by 0.60. Let me do the math: 2.10 รท 0.60 equals 3.5. So R is $3.50. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is $3.50, so that's probably the answer.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So the discounts are applied one after another. First 25%, then 20% off the new price. So the total discount is 25% + 20% - (25% * 20%) = 45% - 5% = 40%? Wait, no, that's for combining two discounts when they're applied in a way that each is a percentage off the original. But in this case, each discount is applied sequentially, so the overall effect is 0.75 * 0.80 = 0.60, which is a 40% discount off the original price. So yes, the cost price is 60% of the retail price.

Another way to check: If the retail price is $3.50, then applying a 25% discount would take off $0.875, bringing it down to $2.625. Then, applying a 20% discount on that would be 20% of $2.625, which is $0.525. Subtracting that gives $2.625 - $0.525 = $2.10, which matches the given cost price. So that checks out.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the trade terms are written differently. Could it be that 25-20% refers to 25% off for 20 units or something like that? No, I think in this context, it's two successive discounts. So yes, the calculation seems correct.

The problem involves determining the retail price of a Captain Kirk doll sold to Albee Stores by BaskowToys Wholesalers, with the dolls being offered at "25-20% off the retail price." This means two successive discounts are applied to the retail price (R): first, 25%, and then 20% off the discounted price.

1. **First Discount (25%):**  
   After the first discount, the price becomes:  
   \[
   R \times (1 - 0.25) = 0.75R
   \]

2. **Second Discount (20%):**  
   The second discount is applied to the already discounted price:  
   \[
   0.75R \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.75R \times 0.80 = 0.60R
   \]

3. **Cost Price:**  
   Albee Stores buys each doll for $2.10, which is the final price after both discounts. Therefore:  
   \[
   0.60R = 2.10
   \]

4. **Retail Price (R):**  
   Solving for \( R \):  
   \[
   R = \frac{2.10}{0.60} = 3.50
   \]

Thus, the retail price of the doll is **$3.50**. This matches option **A**.
