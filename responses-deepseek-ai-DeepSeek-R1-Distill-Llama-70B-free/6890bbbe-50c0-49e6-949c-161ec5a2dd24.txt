Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question presents two statements about group theory and asks whether each is true or false. I need to evaluate each statement and then choose the correct option from A to J based on their truth values.

Starting with Statement 1: "Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10." Hmm, I remember that in group theory, Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. So, the group here has order 45. Let me factor that: 45 is 9 times 5, so the divisors would be 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45. Oh wait, but 10 isn't a divisor of 45. Because 45 divided by 10 is 4.5, which isn't an integer. So according to Lagrange's theorem, a group of order 45 can't have a subgroup of order 10. So Statement 1 is false. That would mean any option where Statement 1 is true can be eliminated. So options A, E, F, G are out because they say Statement 1 is true.

Now onto Statement 2: "A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H." Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that in any finite group, the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets because the index [G:H] is the same whether you take left or right cosets. So if G is finite, then the number of left cosets is |G|/|H| and same for right, so they must be equal regardless of H being normal or not. So the statement seems to suggest that H is normal iff the number of left and right cosets are equal. But since in finite groups, they are always equal, this condition is always true, so it doesn't tell us anything about H being normal. Therefore, the statement is false because the condition doesn't depend on H being normal. Wait, but wait a second, maybe I should think again. Because in infinite groups, the number of cosets could differ, but the question doesn't specify. But the statement is general, so for any group G. So for finite groups, the counts are equal always, but for infinite groups, maybe not. But if G is finite, then the condition holds regardless of normality. So the 'if and only if' statement would be incorrect because the normality isn't the cause here; it's Lagrange's theorem making the counts equal. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The statement says "if and only if the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets." But for any finite group, the number of left and right cosets is equal because the index [G:H] is the same. So for finite G, the condition is always true, whether H is normal or not. But the statement is making a general claim, so it includes both finite and infinite cases. Wait, but in finite groups, the number of cosets is always equal on both sides, so the statement's condition is always met, which would mean that the statement is true only if H is normal in those cases where the counts differ, but in finite groups, they don't. So the statement's claim is that the equality holds if and only if H is normal. But in reality, the equality holds in more cases than just when H is normal. So the statement is false because it's not an if and only if condition. H being normal doesn't affect the count in finite groups. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false. Looking back at the options, option C says Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is false. So the correct answer should be option C.

Statement 1: "Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10."  
By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. The order of the group is 45, and its divisors are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. Since 10 is not a divisor of 45, no subgroup of order 10 can exist. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2: "A subgroup \( H \) of a group \( G \) is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of \( H \) is equal to the number of right cosets of \( H \)."  
In finite groups, the number of left cosets and right cosets of a subgroup \( H \) is always equal because the index \([G:H]\) is the same regardless of whether left or right cosets are considered. This equality does not depend on \( H \) being normal. In infinite groups, the number of cosets could differ, but the statement is general and does not specify the group type. Thus, the claim that normality is equivalent to the equality of left and right cosets is false. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Since both statements are false, the correct answer is:

**C: Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is False.**

Answer: C
