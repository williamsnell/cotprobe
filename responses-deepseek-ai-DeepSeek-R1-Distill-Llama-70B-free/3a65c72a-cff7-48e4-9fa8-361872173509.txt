Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about why a sinusoidal signal is an analog signal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my signals, but let's think this through.

First, let's remember what analog and digital signals are. Analog signals are continuous, meaning they can have any value within a range, right? Like, they don't just jump from one level to another suddenly. Digital signals, on the other hand, have discrete values, like 0s and 1s, so they can only take specific values at any given time.

The question is about a sinusoidal signal. I know that a sine wave is a smooth, continuous curve. It goes up and down in a regular pattern. So what makes it analog? Let's look at the options.

Option A says it's a square wave. Wait, no, a square wave is a different shape altogether. It's not sinusoidal, so A is wrong.

Option B: it has a constant frequency. Well, a sine wave does have a constant frequency, but that doesn't directly explain why it's analog. I mean, digital signals can also have frequencies, but I don't think that's the reason here. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C says it's positive for one half cycle. That's true for a sine wave, but again, that's a characteristic of the waveform's shape, not why it's analog. Plus, other waveforms might do that too.

Option D: can only have a single value at a time. Wait, no. An analog signal can have many values, so D sounds more like a digital thing. Digital signals can only have a certain number of values, like two. So D is probably not right.

Option E: has a sinusoidal waveform. That's true, but why does that make it analog? I mean, the waveform's shape doesn't determine if it's analog or digital. The key is whether the signal is continuous or discrete. So E is just describing what it is, not why it's analog.

Option F: can only have two values, positive and negative. No, that's not right. If it could only have two, it'd be digital. So F is wrong.

Option G: can have a number of values between the negative and positive peaks. Oh, this sounds right. Because in an analog signal, the value can vary smoothly between the maximum and minimum. So a sine wave, which moves smoothly from positive to negative, fits this. It's not just two values, but infinitely many in between.

Option H: has positive and negative values. Well, yes, but that alone doesn't make it analog. A digital signal could have positive and negative too, but only at discrete points. So H isn't the reason.

Option I: it's a digital signal. No, the question states it's analog, so I is wrong.

Option J: negative for one half cycle. Similar to C, just the opposite. Doesn't explain why it's analog.

So putting it all together, the correct reason a sinusoidal signal is analog is because it can take on a range of values between its peaks, not just discrete ones. So option G is the correct answer.

A sinusoidal signal is analog because it can take on a range of values between its negative and positive peaks, which is a key characteristic of analog signals. This continuous nature allows for smooth transitions, unlike digital signals, which have discrete values.

Answer: G
