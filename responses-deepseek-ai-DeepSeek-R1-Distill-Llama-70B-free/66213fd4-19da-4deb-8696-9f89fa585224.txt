Okay, so I've got this problem here about capacitors and charges. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electronics, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a 2 μF capacitor connected directly to a battery. When it's fully charged, it stores 600 μC of charge. Wait, wait. Oh right, the formula for the charge on a capacitor is Q = C * V. So when the capacitor is fully charged, Q is 600 μC, and C is 2 μF. So I can find the voltage of the battery using that.

Let me plug in the numbers. V = Q / C = 600 μC / 2 μF. Oh wait, μC is microcoulombs, and μF is microfarads. So 600 divided by 2 is 300. So V is 300 volts? That seems a bit high, but okay, maybe it's a high voltage battery.

Now, the experimenter replaces the 2 μF capacitor with three 18 μF capacitors in series. Wait, capacitors in series? Right, when capacitors are in series, their capacitances add in a reciprocal manner. So for capacitors in series, the equivalent capacitance is 1/Ceq = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3... and so on.

So each capacitor is 18 μF, and there are three of them in series. So let's calculate the equivalent capacitance. 1/Ceq = 3*(1/18 μF). Let's see, 1/18 is about 0.055555... Farads per microfarad? Wait, no, because 18 μF is 18e-6 F. So 1/18e-6 is approximately 55,555.555 per microfarad? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of microfarads.

Wait, 18 μF is 18 microfarads. So 1/Ceq = (1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18) μF^-1. So that's 3/18 which is 1/6. So 1/Ceq is 1/(6 μF⁻¹) ? Wait, no. Let me correct that. Oh, wait, no. Let me do it more carefully.

Each capacitor is 18 μF. So for three in series, the equivalent capacitance Ceq is (1/(1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18)) μF. Because each term is 1/C for each capacitor.

So 1/Ceq = 3*(1/18) = 1/6. So Ceq = 6 μF. Oh, that's higher than the original 2 μF? Wait, no, wait. Because in series, higher capacitance values would actually result in lower equivalent capacitance. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let's correct that. When capacitors are connected in series, the equivalent capacitance is less than each individual capacitor. So if each is 18 μF and three are in series, their equivalent should be lower than 18 μF. Wait, but according to the calculation, Ceq is 6 μF. Oh, right, that's correct because 1/Ceq is 1/18 +1/18 +1/18 = 3/18 =1/6, so Ceq is 6 μF. So that's correct.

Now, the same battery is connected. So the battery's voltage is still 300 V as before. So the charge stored on the equivalent capacitor would be Qeq = Ceq * V. So that's 6 μF * 300 V = 1800 μC. But wait, this is the total charge stored by all three capacitors together.

Wait, but the question is asking about the charge stored on each capacitor. Oh, right, because when capacitors are in series, the charge on each is the same. So each capacitor will have the same Q.

Wait, why is that? Because in a series connection, the same current flows through each capacitor when charging. So the same amount of charge builds up on each. So each of the three 18 μF capacitors will have the same charge, Q.

So the total charge stored is 1800 μC, and each capacitor has the same Q. So each has 1800 μC divided by 3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, because in series, the charge on each is the same. So each capacitor has Q = 600 μC? Wait, no, because the equivalent capacitance is 6 μF. So Q = 6 μF * 300 V = 1800 μC. But each individual capacitor in series has the same charge. So the charge on each is 1800 μC? That can't be right because then each would have a higher charge than the original.

Wait, no, that's not possible because the original capacitor had 600 μC. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The battery's voltage is 300 V. When the capacitors are in series, each capacitor doesn't have the full 300 V across it. Instead, the voltage is split among them. Oh right, because in series, the voltages add up. So the sum of the voltages across each capacitor is 300 V.

Each capacitor has the same charge Q. Because in series, the charge is the same through each. So Q = C * V for each, where V is the voltage across that capacitor.

But the equivalent capacitance is Ceq = 6 μF. So the total charge is Qeq = Ceq * V = 6 * 300 = 1800 μC. But that's the sum of the charges? No, wait, no. Because each capacitor has charge Q, and there are three capacitors, so the total charge is 3Q?

Wait, no, no. Wait, no. The total charge stored is just Q, because each capacitor in series stores Q, but the way they're connected, the charge is the same on each. So the entire system's charge is Q, not 3Q.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me approach this differently. The battery's voltage is V = 300 V. The equivalent capacitance is Ceq = 6 μF. So the charge stored on the equivalent capacitor is Qeq = Ceq * V = 6e-6 F * 300 V = 1800 μC.

But since the capacitors are in series, each capacitor has the same charge, so each has Q = Qeq = 1800 μC? That can't be right because the original 2 μF had only 600 μC. How can each of the 18 μF capacitors have more charge?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when capacitors are connected in series, the same charge Q builds on each. So the total charge stored in the system would be Q, same as before. But wait, in the original setup, the charge was 600 μC. Now, in the new setup, the equivalent capacitance is 6 μF, so Qeq = 6 *300 = 1800 μC. But that's the total charge on the entire system. But wait, each capacitor in series has the same charge, so each would have 1800 μC? That's impossible because then each 18 μF capacitor would have Q=1800 μC, which is a lot. Wait, but when you have capacitors in series, each has the same charge, but the voltage across each would differ based on their capacitance.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let's think again.

In a series connection of capacitors:

- The same charge Q is on each capacitor.
- The voltage across each capacitor is V1 = Q/C1, V2=Q/C2, etc.
- The total voltage is V = V1 + V2 + V3.

So in this case, each capacitor is 18 μF, so C1 = C2 = C3 = 18 μF.

So Q is the same for each.

The equivalent capacitance Ceq is 6 μF, so total charge Qeq = Ceq * Vbattery = 6e-6 F * 300 V = 1800 μC.

But since Qeq is the charge on the equivalent capacitor, which is the same as the charge on each individual capacitor in the series, Q = 1800 μC for each.

Wait, but each capacitor is 18 μF. So the voltage across each would be V = Q/C = 1800 μC / 18 μF.

Wait, let's compute that. 1800e-6 C / 18e-6 F = 100 V.

So each capacitor has 100 V across it, and with three capacitors in series, the total voltage is 3*100 = 300 V, which matches the battery's voltage.

So each capacitor has a charge of 1800 μC. But wait, that's way higher than the original 600 μC. How is that possible? Because the equivalent capacitance is higher, so more charge is stored for the same voltage.

Wait, the original capacitor was 2 μF, so 600 μC at 300 V. Now, the new setup is 6 μF, so 6 times the capacitance, so 6 times the charge, which is 3600 μC? Wait, no, because 6 μF * 300 V is 1800 μC. Oh wait, yes, 600 * 3 is 1800.

But each capacitor has 1800 μC? That seems like a lot, but it's consistent with the calculations.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see 1800 as an option except for J. The options are:

A: 300 μC

B:400

C:200

D:100

E:700

F:900

G:1200

H:500

I:600

J:1800.

So J is 1800. But wait, the question says, when the three capacitors are connected in series, what is the charge on each.

But wait, in series, each capacitor has the same charge, which would be the same as the charge on the equivalent capacitor, which is 1800 μC. So each capacitor has 1800 μC.

But wait, 18 μF capacitors charged to 1800 μC would have a voltage of 100 V across each. So three of them would sum to 300 V, which matches the battery. That makes sense.

So the correct answer would be J: 1800 μC.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the individual capacitors are each 18 μF. So let's see: Each capacitor's charge is 1800 μC, so Q=1800 μC = 1.8 mC.

Wait, but 18 μF is 0.018 Farads. So voltage across each is V=Q/C = 1.8e-3 C / 18e-6 F = 100 V. So each has 100 V, three in series make 300 V, which matches the battery.

But wait, the original capacitor had 600 μC at 300 V, which is 2 μF. Now, each capacitor has 1800 μC, which is 6 μF. Wait, no, each capacitor is 18 μF. So 18 μF has 1800 μC. So 18 μF * 100 V = 1800 μC. So yes.

So the charge on each of the three capacitors is 1800 μC, which is option J.

Wait, but let me think again. The battery's voltage is 300 V. So when the capacitors are connected in series, each has 100 V across them. So each has Q = C * V = 18 μF * 100 V = 1800 μC. So yes.

So the correct answer is J: 1800 μC.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by determining the voltage of the battery. The charge stored on the original 2 μF capacitor is given as 600 μC. Using the formula \( Q = C \cdot V \), the voltage \( V \) can be calculated as:

\[
V = \frac{Q}{C} = \frac{600 \, \mu C}{2 \, \mu F} = 300 \, V.
\]

Next, the experiment involves replacing the 2 μF capacitor with three 18 μF capacitors connected in series. For capacitors in series, the equivalent capacitance \( C_{\text{eq}} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3}.
\]

Since all three capacitors are identical (\( C_1 = C_2 = C_3 = 18 \, \mu F \)):

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{18} = \frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the equivalent capacitance is:

\[
C_{\text{eq}} = 6 \, \mu F.
\]

The total charge stored by the equivalent capacitor when connected to the 300 V battery is:

\[
Q_{\text{eq}} = C_{\text{eq}} \cdot V = 6 \, \mu F \cdot 300 \, V = 1800 \, \mu C.
\]

In a series connection, the charge on each capacitor is the same. Therefore, the charge stored on each of the three 18 μF capacitors is:

\[
Q = 1800 \, \mu C.
\]

This matches option J. The calculations confirm that each capacitor in the series connection stores 1800 μC of charge.
