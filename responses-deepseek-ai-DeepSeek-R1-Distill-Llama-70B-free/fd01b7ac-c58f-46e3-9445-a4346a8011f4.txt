Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, let's read it again. It says that a 50.0 mL sample of 0.0025 M HBr is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.0023 M KOH. I need to find the pH of the resulting mixture. The options are from A to J, with various numbers, so I have to compute and see which one matches.

Alright, I remember that HBr is a strong acid, and KOH is a strong base. So when they mix, they should neutralize each other. But wait, I need to figure out which one is in excess and by how much because that will determine the pH.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each. Moles are calculated by multiplying concentration (M) by volume (L). Since the volumes are in mL, I'll convert them to liters.

For HBr:
Molarity (M) = 0.0025 M, volume = 50.0 mL = 0.050 L.
Moles of HBr = 0.0025 * 0.050 = let's see, 0.0025 is the same as 2.5e-3. So 2.5e-3 * 5e-2 = 1.25e-4 moles. So 0.000125 moles of HBr.

For KOH:
Molarity is 0.0023 M, volume is 50 mL = 0.050 L.
Moles of KOH = 0.0023 * 0.050 = 1.15e-4 moles. So 0.000115 moles of KOH.

Wait, so HBr is an acid, it donates H+ ions, and KOH is a base that donates OH- ions. They will react in a 1:1 ratio because HBr + KOH → KBr + H2O. So the reaction equation is HBr + KOH → KBr + H₂O.

So, the moles of H+ from HBr and OH- from KOH will react. Let's subtract the moles to see which is in excess.

Moles of HBr (H+): 0.000125
Moles of KOH (OH-): 0.000115

Subtracting: 0.000125 - 0.000115 = 0.00001 moles of H+ remaining. So HBr is in excess, and there's 0.00001 moles of H+ left.

But wait, the total volume is now 50 + 50 = 100 mL = 0.100 L. So the concentration of H+ will be moles divided by volume.

Concentration of H+ = 0.00001 / 0.100 = 1e-4 M.

So the [H+] is 1e-4 M. To find pH, I take the -log of that. Log(1e-4) is 4, so pH is 4.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations. Let me recount the moles.

HBr: 0.0025 M * 0.05 L = 0.000125 mol
KOH: 0.0023 M * 0.05 L = 0.000115 mol

Difference is 0.00001 mol of HBr, which is H+ because HBr is a strong acid. So yeah, the remaining H+ is 0.00001 in 0.1 L, so 0.0001 M. Wait, wait a minute, 0.00001 mol over 0.1 L is 0.0001 M, which is 1e-4 M. So pH is 4. Right, that's option E.

Alternatively, because both are strong acid and base, they would completely neutralize each other to the point of the limiting reagent, and any excess determines the pH. So yes, in this case, HBr is in excess by 0.00001 mol, leading to an acidic solution with pH 4.

To determine the pH of the resulting mixture, we first calculate the moles of HBr and KOH:

- **Moles of HBr**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of HBr} = 0.0025 \, \text{M} \times 0.050 \, \text{L} = 0.000125 \, \text{mol}
  \]

- **Moles of KOH**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of KOH} = 0.0023 \, \text{M} \times 0.050 \, \text{L} = 0.000115 \, \text{mol}
  \]

Since HBr and KOH react in a 1:1 molar ratio, the limiting reagent is KOH. After the reaction, the excess moles of HBr are:  
\[
\text{Excess moles of HBr} = 0.000125 - 0.000115 = 0.00001 \, \text{mol}
\]

The total volume of the mixture is:  
\[
\text{Total volume} = 50.0 \, \text{mL} + 50.0 \, \text{mL} = 100.0 \, \text{mL} = 0.100 \, \text{L}
\]

The concentration of the excess \(\text{H}^+\) ions is:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = \frac{\text{Excess moles of HBr}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.00001}{0.100} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
\]

The pH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H}^+]} = -\log{(1 \times 10^{-4})} = 4
\]

Thus, the pH of the resulting mixture is **4**.
