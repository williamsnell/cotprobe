Question:

Describe a procedure that can be used to determine inventory turnover rate.

Options:

A: Divide the total inventory by the cost of goods sold at the end of the period
B: Add the beginning inventory to the cost of goods sold, then divide by the ending inventory
C: Add the cost of goods sold to the ending inventory, then divide by the beginning inventory
D: Divide the average inventory by the cost of goods sold
E: Subtract the cost of goods sold from the average inventory
F: Multiply the cost of goods sold by the average inventory
G: Divide the cost of goods sold by the average inventory
H: Subtract the average inventory from the cost of goods sold
I: Multiply the ending inventory by the cost of goods sold, then divide by the beginning inventory
J: Add the cost of goods sold to the average inventory

Okay, so I have this question about inventory turnover rate, and I need to figure out the correct procedure. Hmm, inventory turnover rate, I think, is a measure of how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory in a given period. It helps assess the efficiency of inventory management. 

Wait, the formula for inventory turnover rate... I'm trying to remember. I think it's something like cost of goods sold divided by average inventory. Because cost of goods sold (COGS) represents the amount of inventory that's been sold, and average inventory gives the average level of inventory held during the period. So dividing COGS by average inventory would give how many times the inventory has turned over.

Let me think about the options. Let's go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Divide total inventory by COGS. No, that doesn't sound right. It should be COGS divided by inventory, not the other way around. 

Option B: Add beginning inventory to COGS, then divide by ending inventory. That doesn't make sense. Adding COGS (which is an expense) to inventory (an asset) doesn't fit. The units wouldn't match either. 

Option C: Add COGS to ending inventory, then divide by beginning inventory. Again, adding COGS to inventory is mixing different types of numbers. Probably not correct.

Option D: Divide average inventory by COGS. Oh wait, no, that's the inverse of what I thought earlier. Inventory turnover is COGS divided by average inventory, so this would be the reciprocal. So D is average inventory divided by COGS, which would give a different ratio. 

Option E: Subtract COGS from average inventory. That doesn't make sense for turnover, which is a ratio, not a subtraction.

Option F: Multiply COGS by average inventory. That would give a very large number and probably isn't the turnover rate. 

Option G: Divide COGS by average inventory. Yes, that sounds right. COGS over average inventory. So G is the correct one. 

Option H: Subtract average inventory from COGS. Again, subtraction doesn't fit here. 

Option I: Multiply ending inventory by COGS, then divide by beginning inventory. That's a bit confusing. Maybe calculating something else, but not turnover. 

Option J: Add COGS to average inventory. Nope, that's adding two different metrics, doesn't relate to turnover.

So the correct answer should be G. Let me double-check. The formula for inventory turnover is indeed COGS divided by average inventory. So G is the right procedure.

The inventory turnover rate measures how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory in a given period. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory. This formula assesses the efficiency of inventory management by comparing the amount of inventory sold to the average inventory held during the period.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J**: These options involve incorrect operations, such as dividing or multiplying the wrong variables, or combining incompatible metrics.
- **G**: Correctly describes the formula, where COGS is divided by the average inventory.

Thus, the correct procedure is described in option **G**.

Answer: G
