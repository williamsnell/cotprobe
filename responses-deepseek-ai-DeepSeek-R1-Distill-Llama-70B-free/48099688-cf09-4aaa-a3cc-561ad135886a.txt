Okay, so I've got this question about property law, specifically dealing with future interests. Hmm, I remember that when a grantor conveys property, they can create various types of interests, like remainders and executory interests. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that a grantor conveyed his apartment building with a consideration of a dollar, which is acknowledged. The conveyance is structured as follows: "to my son for life, then to my uncle for life, but if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle, then to the heirs of my uncle if my uncle does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my brother if my uncle does move to another state." 

I need to figure out what the brother's interest is during the son's lifetime. The options are various types of remainders and executory interests.

First, breaking down the conveyance:

1. The son gets a life estate. So, the son's interest is a present possessory estate for his life.

2. After the son's life, it goes to the uncle for life. So the uncle has a vested remainder, specifically a life estate. Wait, but the conveyance includes a condition: if the uncle moves to another state, it goes to the brother for the uncle's life. So, the uncle's interest isn't a simple vested remainder because it's subject to a condition subsequent (moving away). So the uncle's life estate is subject to deferral.

Wait, no, actually, upon the son's death, the uncle is to get a life estate, but if the uncle moves, it goes to the brother instead. So the uncle's interest is a life estate determinable or subject to condition subsequent? Or perhaps the uncle's interest is a contingent remainder? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think again.

The initial conveyance after the son is to the uncle for life, but there's a condition: if the uncle moves, then during the uncle's life, it goes to the brother. So wait, the uncle has a life estate, but upon moving, it's divested and the brother gets a life estate for the uncle's life. So the uncle's estate is a life estate subject to an executory limitation. Because moving would cause it to shift to the brother for the same duration (the uncle's life). So the uncle's interest is a life estate, but if he moves, it's cut short and goes to the brother for the rest of the uncle's life.

So, the brother's interest is an executory interest. Because it's an interest that will take effect only upon a certain condition (the uncle moving), and it's an interest that follows another estate (the uncle's life estate). 

Wait, what's the difference between a remainder and an executory interest? A remainder is an interest that is given to someone after a prior estate, and it takes effect immediately upon the termination of the prior estate. An executory interest, however, is an interest that's held in abeyance and cuts short another interest upon a contingency. So in this case, the brother's interest is an executory interest because it's not simply following the uncle's life estate; it's taking effect only if the uncle moves, thus cutting short the uncle's interest.

So the brother's interest is contingent because it only happens if the uncle moves. Therefore, it's a contingent executory interest.

But wait, what's the duration of the brother's interest? It's for the life of the uncle. So the brother gets a life estate measured on the uncle's life. So it's a life estate pur autre vie. 

Now, the options are about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime. So the son is still alive, so the life estate of the son is still in effect. The next in line is the uncle's life estate, subject to the condition. So the brother's interest is an executory interest that's contingent on the uncle moving.

So, the brother's interest is a shifting executory interest pur autre vie, because it's an executory interest that shifts to the brother upon the condition, and the interest the brother holds is a life estate measured on someone else's life (the uncle's).

Looking at the options:

Option D: shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

Option G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

Hmm, what's the difference between D and G? Shifting executory interests are those that shift from one person to another upon a contingency. Contingent executory interests are those that are subject to a condition precedent.

Wait, but in this case, the brother's interest is contingent because it only takes effect if the uncle moves. So it's a contingent executory interest, not a shifting one. Because the executory interest is created in the brother, and it's contingent on the uncle moving.

Wait, let me think again. The initial conveyance is to the son for life, then to the uncle for life. So the uncle has a vested remainder subject to an executory limitation. Because upon the condition (moving), the uncle's interest is divested, and the brother's interest takes effect. So the brother holds an executory interest that will divest the uncle's remainder upon the condition.

Alternatively, the brother's interest is an executory interest, which is contingent because it depends on the uncle moving. So it's a contingent executory interest. But is it pur autre vie?

Yes, because the brother's estate, when it takes effect, is a life estate for the uncle's life (the conveyance says "to my brother for the life of my uncle"). So the brother's estate is a life estate pur autre vie, but it's subject to a contingency (the uncle moving).

So the brother's interest is a contingent executory interest pur autre vie. That would be option G.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is shifting executory interest pur autre vie, and option G is contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

Shifting executory interests are those that can shift to another person upon a contingency, but here, the brother's interest is only possible if the contingency occurs. So it's contingent because the condition (moving) hasn't happened yet, and may never happen. So the brother's interest is contingent upon the uncle moving, making it a contingent executory interest. Therefore, option G.

Wait, wait. Another angle: the brother's interest is a type of springing executory interest. Because it's cutting short the uncle's interest upon a condition. So the brother's interest is an executory interest that is contingent on the uncle moving. So it's a contingent executory interest, and since it's a life estate for the uncle's life, it's pur autre vie.

So the correct option would be G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

But let me make sure. The son is alive, so the current estate is the son's life estate. After that, the uncle has a vested remainder, but it's subject to an executory interest in the brother. So the uncle's remainder is vested, but subject to being divested by the brother's executory interest.

Therefore, the brother's interest is an executory interest that's contingent on the uncle moving. So it's a contingent executory interest pur autre vie. So option G.

Alternatively, could it be a shifting executory interest? Shifting executory interests are when the interest is given to one person, but upon a condition, shifts to another. Here, the executory interest is in the brother, but it's contingent on the uncle moving. So it's a contingent executory interest, not shifting. Because the brother is the only one with the executory interest; it's not shifting from someone else to the brother, but rather, it's an interest that may or may not take effect based on a contingency.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The grantor conveyed his apartment building with a life estate to his son, followed by a vested remainder to his uncle for life. However, the uncle's interest is subject to a condition: if the uncle moves to another state, the property will instead go to the brother for the life of the uncle. After the uncle's life, the property will pass to the heirs of the uncle if he does not move, or to the heirs of the brother if he does move.

The brother's interest is contingent because it only takes effect if the uncle moves to another state. This contingency makes the brother's interest a **contingent executory interest**. Furthermore, since the brother's interest is a life estate measured by the uncle's life, it is a **life estate pur autre vie**. Therefore, the brother's interest during the son's lifetime is best described as a **contingent executory interest pur autre vie**.

Option G correctly captures this characterization.
