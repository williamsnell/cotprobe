Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about resistance in a conductor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states: The resistance of a conductor with diameter d and length l is R ohms. If the diameter is halved and the length is doubled, what's the new resistance? The options are from A to J.

I remember that resistance in a conductor is given by the formula R = resistivity * (length / area). Oh wait, right, the formula is R = ρ * (L / A), where ρ is the resistivity, L is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area.

So the original resistance is R = ρ * (l / A). The area A for a wire is πr², but since diameter is given, the radius is diameter divided by two. So original diameter is d, so radius is d/2. Hence, original area A = π*(d/2)² = πd²/4.

Now, when the diameter is halved, the new diameter is d/2. So the new radius is (d/2)/2 = d/4. The new area A' would be π*(d/4)^2 = πd²/16. So the area becomes a quarter of the original because (d/4)^2 is (d²/16) compared to (d²/4) originally. So A' = A/4.

And the length is doubled, so new length is 2l.

Putting this into the resistance formula, the new resistance R' is ρ * (2l) / (A/4). Let's see, substituting A as πd²/4, but wait, I can express this in terms of the original R.

Original R was ρ*l/(A). So R' = ρ*(2l) / (A/4) = ρ*(2l *4)/A = 8 * (ρ l / A) ) = 8R. Oh, wait, that can't be right because in my initial substitution, I might have messed up.

Wait, let me recalculate. The formula is R = ρ L / A. So when L becomes 2l and A becomes A/4, R' = ρ*(2l) / (A/4) = ρ*(2l)*(4/A) )= 8 * (ρ l / A ). And since ρ l / A is the original R, R' = 8R. So the resistance becomes 8 times larger.

Looking at the options, option G is 8R Ω. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait, I thought when you increase the length, resistance increases, and when you decrease the cross-sectional area, resistance increases. So both changes here are increasing the resistance. Since length is doubled, that would double the resistance. But since the area is a quarter (because diameter is halved, so radius is halved, area is radius squared, so (1/2)^2 = 1/4), the resistance increases by a factor of 4.

So 2 (from length) times 4 (from area) is 8. So yeah, 8R.

The resistance of a conductor is given by the formula:

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

where \( \rho \) is the resistivity, \( L \) is the length, and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area. The problem states that the original resistance is \( R \), with the conductor having a diameter \( d \) and length \( l \). The cross-sectional area of a conductor is proportional to the square of its radius, and since the radius is half the diameter, the original area is:

\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}.
\]

When the diameter is halved, the new diameter is \( \frac{d}{2} \), so the new radius is \( \frac{d}{4} \). The new cross-sectional area becomes:

\[
A' = \pi \left(\frac{d}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{16}.
\]

This shows that the new area is one-fourth of the original area (\( A' = \frac{A}{4} \)).

Additionally, the length of the conductor is doubled, so the new length is \( 2l \).

Substituting these changes into the resistance formula, the new resistance \( R' \) is:

\[
R' = \rho \frac{2l}{\frac{A}{4}} = \rho \frac{2l \cdot 4}{A} = 8 \cdot \rho \frac{l}{A}.
\]

Since \( \rho \frac{l}{A} = R \), the new resistance becomes:

\[
R' = 8R.
\]

Thus, the resistance increases by a factor of 8. The correct answer is:

G: \( 8R \, \Omega \).
