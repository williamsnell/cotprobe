Alright, I'm looking at this question about variation. Hmm, okay, let me break it down. So, the question is asking which statement about variation is true, and the options are A through D.

Let me remember what I learned in biology. Variation can be genetic or environmental. Genetic variation comes from differences in genes, which are sections of DNA. Phenotypic variation is the physical expression of those genes, like traits we can see.

Option A says all phenotypic variation is due to genotypic variation. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because I remember that environment also plays a role. Like, identical twins have the same genotype, but their phenotypes can differ because of environment or epigenetics. So A is probably false.

Option B claims all genetic variation produces phenotypic variation. I don't think that's correct either. There's something called neutral variation, where changes in the DNA don't affect the phenotype. For example, synonymous mutations in DNA don't change the amino acid, so the protein stays the same. So B is not true.

Option C states all nucleotide variability results in neutral variation. That can't be right. Some nucleotide changes do affect the phenotype. Like if a change leads to a different amino acid (missense mutation), that's not neutral. So C is false.

Option D says all new alleles are the result of nucleotide variability. Well, alleles are alternative forms of a gene, and they arise from mutations, which are changes in the nucleotide sequence. So any new allele must come from some change in the DNA sequence. So D sounds correct.

Wait, could there be any other way alleles form besides nucleotide changes? I'm trying to think. Oh, there's chromosomal changes too, like duplications or inversions. Wait, but those are still changes in the DNA structure, so they're a type of nucleotide variability, right? Or maybe not exactly, because larger scale changes might not be single nucleotide changes. Hmm. But the options don't mention that. If the question is about nucleotide variability, which is changes in individual nucleotides, then perhaps not all new alleles come from that. But wait, the options are about 'nucleotide variability'â€”which I think refers to any change in the nucleotide sequence, whether single or in larger structures. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'nucleotide variability' is used here to mean any change in the DNA sequence, including insertions, deletions, etc. So, any new allele comes from some change in the DNA sequence. So D would be correct.

Wait, but if an allele arises from something like a gene duplication, is that considered nucleotide variability? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the main source of new alleles is mutation, which is a change in nucleotide sequence. So D would be correct.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine which statement about variation is true, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A** states that all phenotypic variation is the result of genotypic variation. This is incorrect because phenotypic variation can also arise from environmental factors or epigenetic changes, not just genetic differences.

- **Option B** claims that all genetic variation produces phenotypic variation. This is false because some genetic variations, such as synonymous mutations, do not affect the phenotype and are considered neutral.

- **Option C** suggests that all nucleotide variability results in neutral variation. This is also incorrect, as some nucleotide changes (e.g., missense mutations) can alter the phenotype.

- **Option D** states that all new alleles are the result of nucleotide variability. This is correct because new alleles arise from mutations, which involve changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. While larger-scale chromosomal changes can also produce new alleles, these ultimately stem from variations in the DNA sequence.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.
