Okay, so I've got this question about Cobalt-60 and how it's produced. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let me try to work through this.

The question says that Cobalt-60 is used in radiation therapy for cancer, and it's produced by bombarding Cobalt-59 with something. I need to figure out what that something is.

I remember that different particles are used in nuclear reactions. Cobalt-59 is the target here. I think the process involves changing the nucleus to create a new isotope. So, what's the reaction equation look like?

Alright, Cobalt-59's atomic number is 27. If we're making Cobalt-60, the mass number increases by 1. So, the projectile must add one to the mass.

Let me list the options again: the projectiles are gamma rays, neutrons, ultraviolet light, beta particles, infrared, protons, electrons, X-rays, positrons, alpha particles.

Wait, gamma rays are high-energy photons, but they don't have mass or charge. So they probably don't add mass. Same with X-rays, ultraviolet, infrared—they're all electromagnetic radiation. Beta particles are electrons, so they have a negative charge. Positrons are positive electrons, but same mass issue as electrons. Protons have a +1 charge and mass 1. Neutrons are neutral with mass 1. Alpha particles are helium nuclei, mass 4 and charge +2.

So the reaction is Co-59 + X → Co-60 + something. The mass of Co-59 is 59, so adding 1 would make it 60. So the projectile's mass should be 1.

Which particles have mass 1? Protons have mass approximately 1 (since it's about the same as a hydrogen nucleus). Neutrons have mass 1 as well. So possible options are B (neutron) or F (proton).

Wait, but when you bombard with a neutron, what happens? It's called neutron capture. So Co-59 plus a neutron would make Co-60, and since a neutron has no charge, the atomic number stays the same. That makes sense because Co-60 is just an isotope with one more neutron.

If it were a proton, the atomic number would increase by 1, turning it into something else. For example, Co-59 + proton (H+) would become Ni-60, because Nickel is next after Cobalt (27 to 28). But the product is Co-60, so that's not possible. So using a proton wouldn't work because it changes the element.

So the correct projectile must be a neutron. Therefore, the answer should be option B: Neutrons.

I think I'm confident with that. So the answer is B.
</think>

Cobalt-60 is produced by bombarding Cobalt-59 with a particle that increases its mass number by 1 without changing its atomic number. Among the options, neutrons are the only particles that meet this criterion, as they have a mass of 1 and no charge, allowing Cobalt-59 to capture a neutron and become Cobalt-60. Other particles like protons would alter the atomic number, changing the element, while electromagnetic radiation and other particles lack the necessary mass or properties to achieve this transformation.

Answer: B
