Question:

Distinguish between the white and gray matter of the central nervous system.

Options:

A: "White matter" and "gray matter" are terms used to describe the coloration of neurons during staining procedures.
B: "White matter" is the nerve fiber pathways and "gray matter" is the collections of cell bodies.
C: "White matter" refers to unmyelinated axons, while "gray matter" refers to myelinated axons.
D: "White matter" consists of dendrites and "gray matter" consists of neuron cell bodies and axons.
E: "White matter" and "gray matter" are both types of neurons.
F: "White matter" is found only in the spinal cord, while "gray matter" is found only in the brain.
G: "White matter" is composed of glial cells only, while "gray matter" consists of both neurons and glial cells.
H: "White matter" contains the synapses and "gray matter" contains the neurotransmitters.
I: "White matter" is the myelin sheath and "gray matter" is the axons.
J: "White matter" is the collections of cell bodies and "gray matter" is the nerve fiber pathways.

Okay, so I have this question about distinguishing between white matter and gray matter in the central nervous system. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that the brain has these two types of matter, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

So, white matter and gray matter are terms used in the CNS, which includes the brain and spinal cord. I think the colors come from how they appear. Gray matter is darker, and white matter is lighter. But why?

I remember that neurons have cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. Gray matter is probably where the cell bodies are because that's where the nuclei are, which are darker. So maybe gray matter is where the neurons' cell bodies are clustered. That makes sense because if you have a bunch of cell bodies together, they would look gray.

White matter, on the other hand, I think is composed of the axons. But wait, aren't axons usually surrounded by myelin sheaths? Oh right, myelin is a fatty substance that insulates the axons and helps with nerve impulses. Myelin is white, so if the axons are covered in myelin, that would make the area appear white. So white matter is all the myelinated axons, which form the nerve fibers or pathways.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says they're terms from staining. I don't think so; I think it's about the actual appearance due to myelin.

Option B: White matter is nerve fiber pathways, which are axons, and gray matter is collections of cell bodies. That sounds right. Because the cell bodies are in gray areas, like the cortex or the gray matter of the spinal cord.

Option C says white is unmyelinated and gray is myelinated. No, that's the opposite. Myelin makes it white, so white matter should be myelinated. So C is wrong.

Option D: White matter is dendrites? No, I thought white matter is axons. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Both are types of neurons. No, they're not types; they're parts. So E is wrong.

Option F: White only in spinal cord, gray only in brain. No, both have both types. The spinal cord has white matter around the gray matter butterfly. So F is incorrect.

Option G: White is only glial cells? No, white matter is mostly axons, but surrounded by glial cells like oligodendrocytes that provide the myelin. Gray matter has neurons and glial cells too. So G is wrong.

Option H: White has synapses, gray has neurotransmitters. Wait, synapses are between axons and dendrites, which are in gray matter. Because the cell bodies are there, so the synapses would be in gray matter. So H is incorrect.

Option I: White is myelin sheath and gray is axons. No, white matter is the axons with myelin. So I is wrong.

Option J: White is cell bodies, gray is pathways. That's the opposite. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B: White matter is nerve fiber pathways (axons) and gray matter is collections of cell bodies.

The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of two distinct types of tissue: white matter and gray matter. These terms are based on their visible differences in coloration. Gray matter appears darker because it is composed of dense collections of neuron cell bodies, which contain nuclei and other organelles. In contrast, white matter appears lighter due to the presence of myelinated axons, which are nerve fiber pathways. The myelin sheaths, made of fatty substances, insulate the axons and facilitate faster transmission of nerve impulses. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because the coloration is not due to staining but the natural appearance of the tissues.
- **B** is correct as it accurately describes white matter as nerve fiber pathways (myelinated axons) and gray matter as collections of cell bodies.
- **C** is incorrect because it reverses the myelination: white matter is myelinated, not unmyelinated.
- **D** is incorrect because white matter consists of axons, not dendrites.
- **E** is incorrect because white and gray matter are not types of neurons but rather tissue types.
- **F** is incorrect because both white and gray matter are found in both the brain and spinal cord.
- **G** is incorrect because white matter is not composed solely of glial cells; it primarily consists of myelinated axons.
- **H** is incorrect because synapses are typically found in gray matter, where dendrites and cell bodies are located.
- **I** is incorrect because white matter includes both the myelin sheath and the axons it surrounds.
- **J** is incorrect because it reverses the definitions of white and gray matter.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: "White matter" is the nerve fiber pathways and "gray matter" is the collections of cell bodies.**
