Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "All children go to some school." 

The predicates given are:
- Cx: x is a child
- Sx: x is a school
- Gxy: x goes to y

I remember that in predicate logic, when we say "all A are B," it translates to a universal quantifier followed by an implication. But this sentence is a bit trickier because it's saying that every child goes to some school. So it's not just a simple "all children are something," but rather each child goes to at least one school.

Let me break it down. The original statement is in the form "All C are such that they go to some S." So, for every child (since Cx is x is a child), there exists a school (Sy, where y is a school) such that the child goes to that school (Gxy).

So, the structure should be: For all x, if x is a child, then there exists a y such that y is a school and x goes to y. In symbols, that would be ∀x (Cx → ∃y (Sy ∧ Gxy)).

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this structure. Let's go through each option:

Option A: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx • Sy) • Gxy). Hmm, this says for all x and some y, x is a child and y is a school and x goes to y. But wait, the problem is that the scope of the quantifiers here might be off. Because the existential y is inside the universal x, which is correct, but the way it's written, it's just a conjunction. So it would mean that there's a single y that works for all x, which isn't correct. Each child can go to different schools, so we need the existential y to be inside the scope of x. Actually, no, the way A is written, it's ∀x ∃y (Cx ∧ Sy ∧ Gxy). That would mean for every child x, there exists a school y that x goes to. So that seems correct. Wait, but the original statement is "All children go to some school," which implies that each child goes to at least one school. So A seems correct, but let me check the other options.

Option B: (∀x)[Cx • (∃y)(Sy ⊃ Gxy)]. This is for all x, if x is a child, then there's a y such that if y is a school, then x goes to y. Wait, that's not right. Because the implication Sy → Gxy would mean that if y is a school, then x goes to y. But we want x to go to some school, not that for any school, x goes to it. So B is incorrect.

Option C: (∀x)[Sx ⊃ (∃y)(Cy • Gxy)]. This says for all x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that y is a child and x goes to y. Wait, that's the opposite. The original statement is about children going to schools, not schools being attended by children. So C is talking about schools, which is not the subject here. So C is wrong.

Option D: (∀x)(∃y)[(Sx • Cy) • Gxy]. This seems off because it's saying for every x, there's a y where x is a school, y is a child, and x goes to y. That doesn't make sense because schools can't go to children. Also, the variables are mixed up. So D is incorrect.

Option E: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx ⊃ Sy) • Gxy)]. This would mean for every x, there's a y such that if x is a child, then y is a school, and x goes to y. Wait, the structure here is a bit confusing. The way it's written, it's (Cx → Sy) ∧ Gxy. But that doesn't capture the correct meaning because it's saying that for each x, there exists a y where if x is a child, then y is a school and x goes to y. But this could potentially allow y to not be a school if x isn't a child, which doesn't align with the original statement. So E might not be correct.

Option F: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx • Sy) ⊃ Gxy]. This translates to for all x, there exists a y such that if x is a child and y is a school, then x goes to y. But this is a conditional statement. It doesn't assert that x is a child or y is a school, just that if both are true, then x goes to y. This isn't strong enough because it doesn't ensure that every child goes to some school. It just says that if they're a child and y is a school, then they go there. But we need to say that for each child, there exists a school they go to. So F isn't correct.

Option G: (∀x)[Sx ⊃ (∃y)(Cy ⊃ Gxy)]. Again, this is about schools. For any x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that if y is a child, then x goes to y. But again, this is about schools and children attending them, which is the opposite of what we need. So G is incorrect.

Option H: (∀x)[Sx • (∃y)(Cy • Gxy)]. This says for all x, x is a school and there exists a y such that y is a child and x goes to y. This is saying every school has some child attending it, which is not the same as all children attending some school. So H is incorrect.

Option I: (∃x)(∀y)[(Cx • Sy) • Gxy]. This says there exists an x and for all y, x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y. That would mean there's one child who goes to every school, which is not what the original statement says. So I is incorrect.

Option J: (∀x)[Cx ⊃ (∃y)(Sy • Gxy)]. This translates to for all x, if x is a child, then there exists a y such that y is a school and x goes to y. That's exactly what we're looking for. Each child goes to some school. So J seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option A was correct. Let me compare A and J.

Option A: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx • Sy) • Gxy). So for every x, there exists a y where x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y. But wait, this would mean that for every x (whether it's a child or not), there exists a y such that x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y. But if x isn't a child, then the antecedent Cx is false, making the whole conjunction false. So in that case, the statement would be vacuously true for non-children. But the original statement is only about children. So J is better because it's structured as an implication: if x is a child, then there exists a school y that x attends.

So option J correctly captures that only children are considered, and for each child, there exists a school they attend. Option A might be incorrect because it includes all x, not just children, and the conjunction would require x to be a child, y a school, and Gxy. But if x isn't a child, then (Cx • Sy) is false, so the whole thing would be false for those x, which would make the whole statement false because it's a universal quantifier. Wait, no. Let me think again. The statement in A is a universal x, and for each x, there exists a y such that (Cx and Sy and Gxy). So for x that are not children, does this hold? Suppose x is not a child. Then Cx is false, so (Cx ∧ Sy ∧ Gxy) is false for any y. So the statement (∃y)(false) is false, making the whole thing false for such x. But the original statement is "All children go to some school," which is only making a claim about children, not about non-children. So if the translation in A makes a claim about all x, including non-children, then it's incorrect because it would require that even non-children go to some school, which isn't what the original statement says. 

Therefore, option J is better because it only makes a claim about x when x is a child. So J is the correct answer.

The question asks for the best translation of the sentence "All children go to some school" into predicate logic, using the given predicates: 

- **Cx**: x is a child  
- **Sx**: x is a school  
- **Gxy**: x goes to y  

The correct translation should capture the idea that for every child, there exists at least one school that the child attends. This can be expressed in predicate logic as:

**∀x (Cx → ∃y (Sy ∧ Gxy))**

Now, let's analyze the options:

- **Option A**: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx • Sy) • Gxy).  
  This states that for every x, there exists a y such that x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y. However, this makes a claim about all x, including non-children. If x is not a child, the conjunction (Cx ∧ Sy ∧ Gxy) becomes false, which would make the statement false for non-children. The original sentence only makes a claim about children, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: (∀x)[Cx • (∃y)(Sy ⊃ Gxy)].  
  This states that for every x, if x is a child, then there exists a y such that if y is a school, then x goes to y. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the child goes to some school; it only states that if y is a school, then x goes to y, which is not the intended meaning.

- **Option C**: (∀x)[Sx ⊃ (∃y)(Cy • Gxy)].  
  This states that for every x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that y is a child and x goes to y. This is about schools being attended by children, which is the opposite of the original statement. Hence, this is incorrect.

- **Option D**: (∀x)(∃y)[(Sx • Cy) • Gxy].  
  This states that for every x, there exists a y such that x is a school, y is a child, and x goes to y. This is nonsensical because schools cannot "go to" children. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option E**: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx ⊃ Sy) • Gxy)].  
  This states that for every x, there exists a y such that if x is a child, then y is a school, and x goes to y. This does not correctly capture the original statement because it does not ensure that the child goes to some school; it only states that if x is a child, then y is a school and x goes to y. This is not the intended meaning.

- **Option F**: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx • Sy) ⊃ Gxy].  
  This states that for every x, there exists a y such that if x is a child and y is a school, then x goes to y. This is a conditional statement and does not ensure that every child goes to some school. It only specifies a condition, so this is incorrect.

- **Option G**: (∀x)[Sx ⊃ (∃y)(Cy ⊃ Gxy)].  
  This states that for every x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that if y is a child, then x goes to y. This is about schools being attended by children, which is the opposite of the original statement. Hence, this is incorrect.

- **Option H**: (∀x)[Sx • (∃y)(Cy • Gxy)].  
  This states that for every x, x is a school and there exists a y such that y is a child and x goes to y. This is about schools being attended by children, which is not the intended meaning. Thus, this is incorrect.

- **Option I**: (∃x)(∀y)[(Cx • Sy) • Gxy].  
  This states that there exists an x and for all y, x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y. This would mean there is one child who goes to every school, which is not the intended meaning. Hence, this is incorrect.

- **Option J**: (∀x)[Cx ⊃ (∃y)(Sy • Gxy)].  
  This states that for every x, if x is a child, then there exists a y such that y is a school and x goes to y. This correctly captures the original statement, as it ensures that every child goes to some school. Therefore, this is the correct answer.

**Answer: J**
