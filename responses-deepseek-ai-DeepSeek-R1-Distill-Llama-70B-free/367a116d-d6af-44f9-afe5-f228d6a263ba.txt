Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The problem says that Y is the number of defective articles in a box of 50. Each article has a 0.01 probability of being defective. I need to find the probability that Y is 0, 1, 2, or 3. And the hint says to use the binomial distribution. Alright, I remember that the binomial distribution gives the probability of having exactly k successes in n independent trials, with each trial having the same probability of success.

So in this case, each article is a trial, right? And a "success" here would be the article being defective. Even though usually success is a positive thing, in this context, a defective is our "success" for the sake of the calculation. So n is 50, and the probability p is 0.01. We need to find P(Y=0) + P(Y=1) + P(Y=2) + P(Y=3).

I remember the formula for the binomial probability is:

P(Y = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So I'll need to calculate this for k=0,1,2,3 and sum them up.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, for k=0:
P(Y=0) = C(50, 0) * (0.01)^0 * (0.99)^50
C(50,0) is 1 because there's only one way to choose none. (0.01)^0 is 1 as well. So it's (0.99)^50. I'll need to calculate that.

Next, k=1:
P(Y=1) = C(50,1) * (0.01)^1 * (0.99)^49
C(50,1) is 50, since there are 50 ways to choose one defective. So it's 50 * 0.01 * (0.99)^49.

k=2:
P(Y=2) = C(50,2) * (0.01)^2 * (0.99)^48
C(50,2) is 50*49/2 = 1225. So 1225 * (0.01)^2 * (0.99)^48.

k=3:
P(Y=3) = C(50,3) * (0.01)^3 * (0.99)^47
C(50,3) is (50*49*48)/(3*2*1) = 19600. So 19600 * (0.01)^3 * (0.99)^47.

Now, I need to compute each of these terms and add them together.

Wait, but calculating each of these terms might be a bit tedious by hand. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution. I remember that when n is large and p is small, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with λ = n*p. So in this case, λ = 50 * 0.01 = 0.5. 

So maybe using Poisson could be easier. The Poisson probability formula is:

P(Y = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!

So let me try calculating each P(Y=k) for k=0 to 3 using Poisson.

For k=0:
P(Y=0) = e^(-0.5) * (0.5)^0 / 0! = e^(-0.5) * 1 / 1 = e^(-0.5). e^(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065.

k=1:
P(Y=1) = e^(-0.5) * (0.5)^1 / 1! = 0.6065 * 0.5 / 1 = 0.30325.

k=2:
P(Y=2) = e^(-0.5) * (0.5)^2 / 2! = 0.6065 * 0.25 / 2 = 0.6065 * 0.125 = 0.0758125.

k=3:
P(Y=3) = e^(-0.5) * (0.5)^3 / 3! = 0.6065 * 0.125 / 6 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.0208333 ≈ 0.012641.

Adding these up: 0.6065 + 0.30325 = 0.90975. Then +0.0758125 = 0.9855625. Then +0.012641 gives about 0.9982.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 0.9984, which is very close to my approximate value. So perhaps the answer is B.

But wait, the question says to use the binomial distribution. Maybe the exact calculation is slightly different. Because Poisson is an approximation, and when n is 50, which isn't super large, maybe the approximation isn't perfect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact binomial probabilities.

Let me try that. Let's compute each term step by step.

First, for k=0:

P(Y=0) = (0.99)^50.

Hmm, calculating (0.99)^50. I can use logarithms or perhaps remember that ln(0.99) is approximately -0.01005. So 50 * ln(0.99) ≈ 50*(-0.01005) = -0.5025. Then exponentiate: e^(-0.5025) ≈ 0.605.

Wait, but I think a calculator would give a more precise value. Alternatively, I can use the exact computation.

Wait, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps I can proceed with exact computation using the binomial formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term and sum them.

But perhaps I can compute each term one by one.

Alternatively, I can use the recursive formula or a calculator approach.

Wait, maybe I can compute each term:

Compute P(Y=0) = (0.99)^50.

I think (0.99)^50 is approximately 0.605, as I calculated earlier.

Then P(Y=1) = 50 * 0.01 * (0.99)^49.

Wait, (0.99)^49 is (0.99)^50 / 0.99 = 0.605 / 0.99 ≈ 0.6101.

So P(Y=1) = 50 * 0.01 * 0.6101 ≈ 50 * 0.006101 ≈ 0.30505.

Then P(Y=2) = C(50,2) * (0.01)^2 * (0.99)^48.

C(50,2) is 50*49/2 = 1225.

(0.99)^48 = (0.99)^50 / (0.99)^2 ≈ 0.605 / 0.9801 ≈ 0.6173.

So P(Y=2) = 1225 * 0.0001 * 0.6173 ≈ 1225 * 0.00006173 ≈ compute 1225 * 0.00006173.

Let me compute 1225 * 0.00006173.

1225 * 0.00006 = 0.0735.

1225 * 0.00000173 = 0.00211425.

So total approximately 0.0735 + 0.002114 ≈ 0.075614.

Then P(Y=3) = C(50,3) * (0.01)^3 * (0.99)^47.

C(50,3) is 19600.

(0.99)^47 = (0.99)^50 / (0.99)^3 ≈ 0.605 / 0.970299 ≈ 0.6237.

So P(Y=3) = 19600 * (0.01)^3 * 0.6237.

(0.01)^3 is 1e-6. So 19600 * 1e-6 = 0.0196.

Multiply by 0.6237: 0.0196 * 0.6237 ≈ 0.01223.

Now sum all four probabilities.

P(Y=0) ≈ 0.605.

P(Y=1) ≈ 0.30505.

P(Y=2) ≈ 0.075614.

P(Y=3) ≈ 0.01223.

Adding them up:

0.605 + 0.30505 = 0.91005.

0.91005 + 0.075614 = 0.985664.

0.985664 + 0.01223 ≈ 0.997894.

So approximately 0.9979.

Hmm, but earlier with the Poisson approximation, I got about 0.9982. So this exact calculation gives about 0.9979, which is close.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.9984, which is very close to both calculations. But wait, perhaps my exact calculation was a bit rough. Maybe using more precise values would get closer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made some rounding errors in my calculations. Let me try to compute each term more precisely.

Let me compute each term more accurately.

First, let's compute (0.99)^50 accurately. Let me use logarithms for better precision.

ln(0.99) ≈ -0.01005034.

So 50 * ln(0.99) ≈ 50 * (-0.01005034) = -0.502517.

e^(-0.502517) = e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, but more precisely, let me compute it:

We can compute e^(-0.502517) using a calculator. Alternatively, using a Taylor series, but perhaps that's time-consuming. Alternatively, I can accept that (0.99)^50 ≈ 0.605 as an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, (0.99)^50 is approximately 0.605.

So P(Y=0) = 0.605.

Then P(Y=1) = 50 * 0.01 * (0.99)^49.

Compute (0.99)^49 = (0.99)^50 / 0.99 = 0.605 / 0.99 ≈ 0.61006061.

So 50 * 0.01 = 0.5. 0.5 * 0.61006061 ≈ 0.30503.

So P(Y=1) ≈ 0.30503.

P(Y=2) = C(50,2) * (0.01)^2 * (0.99)^48.

C(50,2)=1225.

(0.99)^48 = (0.99)^50 / (0.99)^2 = 0.605 / 0.9801 ≈ 0.617346.

So 1225 * 0.0001 = 0.1225. 0.1225 * 0.617346 ≈ 0.07563.

P(Y=2) ≈ 0.07563.

P(Y=3) = C(50,3) * (0.01)^3 * (0.99)^47.

C(50,3)=19600.

(0.99)^47 = (0.99)^50 / (0.99)^3 = 0.605 / (0.970299) ≈ 0.623418.

So (0.01)^3=1e-6. 19600 * 1e-6 = 0.0196.

0.0196 * 0.623418 ≈ 0.012219.

So summing all four:

0.605 + 0.30503 = 0.91003.

+ 0.07563 = 0.98566.

+ 0.012219 = 0.99788.

So approximately 0.99788, which is about 0.9979.

Looking at the options, the closest is B: 0.9984, but wait, my calculation gives 0.9979, which is about 0.998. Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe using the binomial CDF.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using binomial gives a slightly higher value.

Wait, perhaps using the exact formula with more precise (0.99)^n terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms to compute (0.99)^50 more accurately.

But perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is approximately 0.998, which is close to option B: 0.9984. But why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps the Poisson approximation gives 0.9982, and the exact binomial gives 0.9979. But the options don't have 0.9979. The closest option is B: 0.9984.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact binomial, the sum is approximately 0.9984, so option B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach: using the binomial formula and calculating each term exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the exact answer is 0.9984, which is option B.

Wait, another approach: using the complement. Instead of calculating P(Y=0)+P(1)+P(2)+P(3), perhaps calculate 1 - P(Y>=4). So 1 - [P(4)+P(5)+...+P(50)]. But that might not be easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the normal approximation, but that's probably not necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I can compute each term more accurately.

Let me compute each term again with more precision.

Compute (0.99)^50:

Using a calculator, (0.99)^50 ≈ e^(50 * ln(0.99)) = e^(50*(-0.01005034)) = e^(-0.502517) ≈ approximately 0.605.

But more accurately, using a calculator, (0.99)^50 ≈ 0.604964.

So P(Y=0) = 0.604964.

P(Y=1) = 50 * 0.01 * (0.99)^49.

Compute (0.99)^49 = (0.99)^50 / 0.99 ≈ 0.604964 / 0.99 ≈ 0.610050.

So P(Y=1) = 50 * 0.01 * 0.610050 = 0.5 * 0.610050 = 0.305025.

P(Y=2) = 1225 * (0.01)^2 * (0.99)^48.

(0.99)^48 = (0.99)^50 / (0.99)^2 ≈ 0.604964 / 0.9801 ≈ 0.617346.

So 1225 * 0.0001 = 0.1225. 0.1225 * 0.617346 ≈ 0.075632.

P(Y=2) ≈ 0.075632.

P(Y=3) = 19600 * (0.01)^3 * (0.99)^47.

(0.99)^47 = (0.99)^50 / (0.99)^3 ≈ 0.604964 / 0.970299 ≈ 0.623418.

So 19600 * 0.000001 = 0.0196. 0.0196 * 0.623418 ≈ 0.012219.

Now summing all four:

0.604964 + 0.305025 = 0.909989.

+ 0.075632 = 0.985621.

+ 0.012219 = 0.99784.

So approximately 0.99784, which is about 0.9978.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match 0.9978. The closest option is B: 0.9984, which is 0.9984.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me check each term again.

Wait, let's recompute P(Y=3):

C(50,3) = 50*49*48/(6) = (50*49)=2450, 2450*48=117600, divided by 6: 117600/6=19600. Correct.

(0.01)^3 = 0.000001.

(0.99)^47: Let me compute it more accurately.

(0.99)^50 = 0.604964.

(0.99)^3 = 0.970299.

So (0.99)^47 = (0.604964) / (0.970299) ≈ 0.604964 / 0.970299 ≈ 0.623418.

So 19600 * 0.000001 = 0.0196. 0.0196 * 0.623418 ≈ 0.012219. Correct.

So the sum is 0.604964 + 0.305025 = 0.909989; + 0.075632 gives 0.985621; + 0.012219 gives 0.99784.

So about 0.99784. So 0.99784 is approximately 0.9978.

Looking at the options, the closest provided is option B: 0.9984.

But 0.9978 is about 0.9978, which is 0.9978, which is 0.9978. The options given are A:0.8756, B:0.9984, C:0.9753, D:0.8834, E:0.9925, F:0.9500, G:0.9156, H:0.8600, I:0.9050, J:0.9400.

So the only option close to 0.9978 is B:0.9984.

Wait, but in my exact calculation, I get approximately 0.99784, which is very close to 0.9978, but the option B is 0.9984, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (0.99)^50. Let me check that value more accurately.

Using a calculator, (0.99)^50.

Let me compute it step by step.

We can compute it as (0.99)^10 is approximately 0.904382.

Then (0.904382)^5 = ?

Compute (0.904382)^2 ≈ 0.817073.

Then, (0.817073)^2 ≈ 0.6676.

Multiply by 0.904382:
