Question:

To improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?

Options:

A: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.
B: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance does not serve a significant public interest, because it adversely affects low-income individuals.
C: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not proportionate to the intended public benefit, because it imposes a financial burden on property owners.
D: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.
E: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance does not violate the rights of the property owners, because it regulates the use of their property.
F: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to improve the standard of living within its jurisdiction, because it regulates housing conditions.
G: The city must prove that the ordinance has a rational basis, because it impacts economic activity within its jurisdiction.
H: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no substantial relationship between the ordinance and the city's goal of improving housing quality, because it may result in fewer low-income housing options.
I: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.
J: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.

Okay, so I have this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with burdens of persuasion in a challenge to a city ordinance. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that a city passed an ordinance requiring all rental housing units, both new and existing, to provide at least one full bathroom per bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. The majority of existing rental housing owners opposed this because they claimed it would decrease the number of low-income units since they can't raise rents enough to cover the costs. The city enacted it anyway, and now a plaintiff who owns low-income housing is suing, claiming the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.

The question is about the burden of persuasion in this action. So I need to figure out which option correctly states this burden.

I remember that in constitutional law, when a law is challenged, the court applies different levels of scrutiny. The levels are usually rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny. Rational basis is the lowest level, where the government just needs to show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Intermediate scrutiny requires the law to be substantially related to an important government interest, and strict scrutiny requires it to be necessary for a compelling interest.

In this case, the ordinance is related to housing and economic regulation. I think that typically, economic regulations are subject to rational basis review. Unless a fundamental right is involved or a suspect class is implicated, in which case higher scrutiny might apply.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the plaintiff must show no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest because it's economic activity. That sounds like rational basis. But wait, who has the burden? In rational basis, the plaintiff usually challenges, and the government (city) has the burden to show there's a rational basis. But I'm a bit confused here.

Option D suggests strict scrutiny because it affects a fundamental right of property owners. But the right to use property isn't a fundamental right per se; it's more of a protected interest under the Due Process clause, but for economic regulations, the court usually applies rational basis, not strict scrutiny.

Option B talks about significant public interest because it affects low-income individuals. That makes me think of cases where a law disproportionately affects a particular group, possibly a suspect class. But low-income isn't typically a suspect class; it's more of a quasi-suspect category, maybe, but I'm not sure if that applies here. If it's a suspect class, then strict scrutiny, but I don't think low-income is classified as such.

Option C says the plaintiff must show the ordinance isn't proportionate to public benefit, which sounds more like a due process challenge under the Takings Clause, where proportionality might come into play, but I'm not certain.

Option H says the plaintiff must show no substantial relationship to improving housing quality. That sounds like intermediate scrutiny, but why would intermediate apply here? Intermediate is usually when fundamental rights or quasi-suspect classes are involved.

Option G says the city must prove rational basis because it's economic activity. That makes sense because typically, the city would have the burden under rational basis to show the law is rationally related to a legitimate interest.

Wait, but in a facial challenge, what's the standard? If the plaintiff is challenging on its face, the court would consider whether the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to anyone. The burden usually is on the plaintiff to show that the law cannot be constitutional under any circumstances. But the level of scrutiny affects how that's applied.

So if the law is an economic regulation, the burden is on the plaintiff to show that there's no rational basis. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, in the case of United States v. Carolene Products Co., footnote 4 suggests that when legislation affects the operation of the political process or the rights of discrete and insular minorities, the court will apply stricter scrutiny. But in general economic regulations, rational basis applies, and the burden is on the plaintiff to show that there's no plausible rational basis for the law.

Wait, no. Actually, when a law is challenged under the Due Process clause (as an economic regulation), the court uses rational basis review, and the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that the law is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

Wait, no. I think in cases where the government action is challenged under the Due Process clause as being arbitrary or capricious, the court applies rational basis, and the plaintiff bears the burden to show the lack of a rational basis. So the city doesn't have to prove anything unless the plaintiff meets that initial burden.

But looking back at the options, option A says the plaintiff must demonstrate no rational relationship. That would align with rational basis where the plaintiff has the burden.

Option G says the city must prove rational basis, which would be incorrect because in rational basis, the plaintiff has the burden to show the lack of rationality.

So looking at the options, option A seems to fit. The plaintiff must show no rational relationship, which is the standard for facial challenges under rational basis.

Alternatively, option H says the plaintiff must show no substantial relationship, which sounds like intermediate scrutiny. But that's not applicable here because the regulation is economic, so rational basis applies.

So the correct answer is A.

To determine the burden of persuasion in this case, it is important to analyze the constitutional standard applicable to the city's ordinance. The ordinance regulates economic activity (rental housing) and does not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect class. Under such circumstances, the appropriate standard of review is rational basis scrutiny. 

Under rational basis review, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to demonstrate that the ordinance lacks a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. The city is not required to affirmatively prove the ordinance's rationality unless the plaintiff first meets this burden. This aligns with the principle that economic regulations are presumptively valid and that the government's interest in improving housing quality is legitimate.

Among the options provided, Option A correctly states that the plaintiff must demonstrate there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, as the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority. Other options either misstate the burden, apply the wrong level of scrutiny, or mischaracterize the interests at play.
