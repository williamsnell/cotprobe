Question:

In which of the following situations would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?

Options:

A: A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.
B: After consuming a large amount of alcohol at a party, a defendant decided to set a neighbor's car on fire out of spite. He was seen by witnesses and later arrested and charged with arson.
C: A defendant had been drinking at a local pub and got into a heated argument with another patron. The argument escalated, and the defendant pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed the other patron. The defendant is arrested and charged with attempted murder.
D: A defendant had consumed a fifth of bourbon. Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.
E: A defendant spent the evening drinking at a bar. On his way home, he broke into a house, intending to steal valuables. However, he fell asleep on the couch before he could steal anything. He was discovered by the homeowners and arrested and charged with attempted robbery.
F: At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.
G: A defendant was drinking at a bar when he noticed a woman leave her purse unattended. He stole the purse and was later arrested and charged with theft.
H: A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.
I: A defendant had been drinking heavily at a friend's house. Later that evening, he decided to drive home despite being significantly over the legal blood alcohol limit. On the way, he ran a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. The defendant is arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter.
J: After a night of heavy drinking, a defendant broke into a jewelry store and stole several expensive items. He was caught on the store's surveillance cameras and later arrested and charged with burglary.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with when intoxication doesn't negate criminal culpability. Hmm, I need to think this through. Let me start by recalling what I know about criminal intent and intoxication.

From what I remember, intoxication can sometimes be a defense to certain crimes, but it depends on the type of crime and the level of intent required. There's a difference between specific intent crimes and general intent crimes.

Specific intent crimes require the defendant to have a particular intent beyond just committing the act. For example, burglary requires the intent to commit a felony inside the structure. If someone is so intoxicated that they can't form that specific intent, they might be able to use intoxication as a defense.

General intent crimes, on the other hand, don't require that specific intent. They just require the intent to perform the act itself. So for those, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense because the person intended the general act, even if they couldn't form a more specific intent due to being drunk.

Wait, but wait. What about crimes that are strict liability? Those don't require intent at all, right? So intoxication wouldn't matter there either. But in this question, the options seem to involve crimes that have some level of intent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Conspiracy to commit robbery. Conspiracy requires an agreement with the intent to commit the crime. Since it's a specific intent crime, intoxication might negate the ability to form that intent. But I'm not sure. Wait, the defendant was plotting with buddies and tried to draw a gun. Maybe the act shows intent regardless of intoxication.

Option B: Arson. Arson is typically a specific intent crime, requiring intent to set fire to property. So if the defendant was too drunk to form that intent, maybe he has a defense.

Option C: Attempted murder. Attempt requires specific intent to commit the crime. If the defendant was so intoxicated he couldn't form the intent to kill, maybe that's a defense. But sometimes, for attempt, even if you can't form the full intent due to intoxication, you can still be guilty. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option D: Assault with intent to commit rape. That requires specific intent. If intoxication prevented forming that intent, maybe it's a defense.

Option E: Attempted robbery. Robbery requires specific intent. If he fell asleep, maybe he didn't have the intent to take property, but the attempt would require the intent to commit robbery. If he was too drunk to form that intent, maybe he can claim it. But the option says he intended to steal but fell asleep. So maybe the intent was there, but he didn't complete it. So perhaps intoxication doesn't negate the intent to commit robbery.

Option F: Statutory rape. Statutory rape is a strict liability crime because it's based on the age of the victim, regardless of the defendant's knowledge. So even if the defendant was drunk and mistakenly thought the victim was of age, it's still a crime. So intoxication isn't a defense here. This seems like a likely candidate for the correct answer.

Option G: Theft. Theft is a specific intent crime, requiring intent to permanently deprive. If drunk, maybe couldn't form intent, but I think for theft, voluntary intoxication is generally not a defense because it's a general intent crime? Wait, no, theft is specific because you need to intend to steal. So if too drunk, maybe can't form that intent. But I'm not sure.

Option H: Assault with intent to commit battery. Assault is a general intent crime, I believe. So voluntary intoxication wouldn't negate the intent. But wait, the specific intent here is to commit battery. Hmm, maybe it's a specific intent. So if he was too drunk to form that intent, maybe he can claim it. But I'm not certain.

Option I: Vehicular manslaughter. This is typically a general intent crime. So intoxication might not be a defense. But wait, manslaughter can sometimes be based on recklessness. Intoxication can increase recklessness, so maybe it's not a defense. Alternatively, if it's a specific intent crime, but I think vehicular manslaughter is more about recklessness, which is a lower mens rea.

Option J: Burglary. Burglary requires breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. So specific intent. If drunk, maybe couldn't form that intent, so intoxication could be a defense.

So the question is asking in which situation intoxication would NOT negate culpability. So we're looking for a crime where voluntary intoxication isn't a valid defense.

From what I recall, specific intent crimes can sometimes allow an intoxication defense if it prevented the formation of that intent. General intent crimes don't allow it. And strict liability crimes don't require intent, so intoxication isn't a defense.

Looking back at the options:

Option F is statutory rape, which is strict liability. So the defendant's intoxication doesn't matter. The girl's age is the determining factor, regardless of the defendant's belief or knowledge.

Similarly, in option I, vehicular manslaughter is likely a general intent or recklessness crime. So intoxication wouldn't negate it. But I'm not sure if it's a specific intent.

Wait, statutory rape is definitely a strict liability offense. So in that case, the defendant's intoxication is irrelevant. So option F would be the correct answer, as he can't use intoxication to negate his culpability.

Other options: for example, in option E, attempted robbery. If he intended to steal but was too drunk, perhaps he couldn't form the intent, but the option says he intended to steal valuables, so maybe the intent was there. But I'm not sure about the law on that.

But the question is which situation does intoxication NOT negate culpability. So the answer is F.
</think>

In criminal law, the ability of intoxication to negate culpability depends on the type of crime and the level of intent required. Specific intent crimes require a particular intent beyond merely committing the act, and voluntary intoxication may sometimes be a defense if it prevents the formation of that intent. General intent crimes, on the other hand, only require the intent to perform the act itself, and voluntary intoxication is generally not a defense. Strict liability crimes do not require intent at all, so intoxication is irrelevant.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Conspiracy to commit robbery requires specific intent. Intoxication might negate culpability if it prevented forming the intent to conspire.  
- **Option B**: Arson is a specific intent crime requiring intent to set fire to property. Intoxication could potentially negate culpability.  
- **Option C**: Attempted murder requires specific intent to kill. Intoxication might negate culpability if it prevented forming that intent.  
- **Option D**: Assault with intent to commit rape requires specific intent. Intoxication could potentially negate culpability.  
- **Option E**: Attempted robbery requires specific intent to commit robbery. Intoxication might negate culpability if it prevented forming that intent.  
- **Option F**: Statutory rape is a strict liability crime based on the victim's age, regardless of the defendant's knowledge or belief. Intoxication is irrelevant and cannot negate culpability.  
- **Option G**: Theft is a specific intent crime requiring intent to permanently deprive. Intoxication might negate culpability if it prevented forming that intent.  
- **Option H**: Assault with intent to commit battery requires specific intent. Intoxication might negate culpability if it prevented forming that intent.  
- **Option I**: Vehicular manslaughter is typically a general intent or recklessness crime. Intoxication generally does not negate culpability, but this is less clear than strict liability.  
- **Option J**: Burglary requires specific intent to commit a felony inside the structure. Intoxication might negate culpability if it prevented forming that intent.  

The correct answer is **Option F**, as statutory rape is a strict liability crime where intoxication does not negate culpability.
