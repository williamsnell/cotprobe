Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. Concerns over the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons on stratospheric ozone have motivated a search for new refrigerants. One such alternative is 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (refrigerant 123). Younglove and McLinden published a compendium of thermophysical properties of this substance (J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 23, 7 (1994)), from which properties such as the Joule-Thomson coefficient $\mu$ can be computed.

Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about calculating the temperature change during an adiabatic expansion of a refrigerant. The substance is 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane, also known as refrigerant 123. We're told to compute the temperature change when 2.0 moles of this refrigerant expand adiabatically from 1.5 bar to 0.5 bar at an initial temperature of 50°C.

Hmm, I remember that adiabatic processes are ones where there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, so Q=0. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether this is a reversible or irreversible process. Oh wait, the Joule-Thomson expansion is typically an irreversible process where an ideal gas doesn't change temperature, but for real gases, there can be a temperature change. Oh wait, but in this case, since it's an adiabatic expansion, maybe it's more about using the Joule-Thomson coefficient.

Wait, the question says to compute the temperature change using the Joule-Thomson coefficient μ. I think the Joule-Thomson effect is when a gas expands without doing work and without exchanging heat, so it's an adiabatic process at constant enthalpy. Oh right, for an ideal gas, enthalpy only depends on temperature, so if it's ideal, there's no temperature change. But real gases have μ not equal to zero, so the temperature changes.

So the formula I think is ΔT = μ * ΔP, where ΔP is the pressure change. But wait, I should get the exact relation. I remember that the Joule-Thomson coefficient μ is defined as (dT/dP)_H, the change in temperature with pressure at constant enthalpy. So for a small pressure drop, the temperature change would be approximately μ times the pressure change.

But wait, the problem is from 1.5 bar to 0.5 bar. So ΔP would be 0.5 - 1.5 = -1.0 bar. But I need to check whether the formula uses ΔP as P2 - P1 or the other way around. Since the expansion is into a lower pressure, the pressure is dropping, so ΔP is negative.

Wait, the Joule-Thomson coefficient is (dT/dP)_H, so if the pressure decreases, and μ is positive, the temperature would increase. But I'm not sure about the exact sign conventions here; perhaps I should just proceed carefully.

Wait, the formula for the temperature change is ΔT = μ * (P1 - P2), where P1 is the initial pressure and P2 is the final pressure. Because when the pressure decreases (P2 < P1), so (P1 - P2) is positive, and if μ is positive, then ΔT is positive (temperature increases). But wait, in this case, the refrigerant is expanding, so the gas is doing work on the surroundings, so maybe it's cooling. Hmm, but that depends on the Joule-Thomson coefficient's sign.

Wait, I think for cooling during expansion, the coefficient would be negative, because when you expand (P decreases), the temperature would drop. So if μ is negative, then ΔT would be negative, meaning a temperature drop.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: the Joule-Thomson coefficient is defined as μ = (∂T/∂P)_H. So if μ is positive, then when pressure decreases (dP is negative), dT would be negative because μ is positive and dP is negative. So if the pressure decreases, for a positive μ, the temperature would decrease. Wait, no, wait: if μ is (∂T/∂P)_H, then dT = μ * dP. So if dP is negative (expansion), then dT would be μ times dP. So if μ is positive, then dT is negative, leading to a temperature drop. If μ is negative, then dT would be positive, temperature increases.

Wait, but I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think of it this way: when a gas expands (so pressure drops, dP negative), if μ is positive, then dT = μ * dP is negative. So temperature decreases. So the gas cools upon expansion. On the other hand, if μ is negative, then dT would be positive, meaning the gas warms upon expansion.

But wait, I might have this backwards. Let me look up the formula to make sure. Oh wait, I can't look things up right now. I'll proceed carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula to use here is:

ΔT = μ * (P1 - P2)

Wait, because the pressure change is from P1 to P2. So the change in pressure is P2 - P1, which is negative for expansion. So using (P1 - P2) would make it positive.

So if μ is positive, then ΔT would be positive, implying an increase in temperature. But that contradicts my earlier thought that expansion with positive μ leads to cooling. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔT = μ * (P1 - P2), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's ΔT = μ * ΔP, and ΔP is P2 - P1. So let's clarify.

Let me think of an example. Suppose I have a gas that cools upon expansion. So when P decreases (expansion), T decreases. So ΔP is negative, and ΔT is negative. So if ΔT = μ * ΔP, then μ would be positive because (negative)/(negative)=positive.

Wait, let's say μ is positive. If ΔP is negative (expansion), then ΔT is μ * ΔP, which would be negative, so temperature drops. So that would make sense.

So the formula is ΔT = μ * (P2 - P1). Or is it (P1 - P2)? Wait, no. Because ΔP is P2 - P1, so for expansion, P2 < P1, so ΔP is negative. If μ is positive, then ΔT is negative.

So in the problem, the expansion is from 1.5 bar to 0.5 bar, so ΔP = 0.5 - 1.5 = -1.0 bar.

So ΔT = μ * ΔP = μ * (-1.0 bar). But wait, I don't have the value of μ. The problem says that Younglove and McLinden's data can be used to compute μ, but I don't have that data here. So perhaps we're supposed to use an approximate value or perhaps the problem expects us to use an alternative approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ideal gas case, but the problem says to assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Oh wait, no, it says "assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise." Wait, but the problem is about a real gas because it's about the Joule-Thomson effect, which is a real gas phenomenon. Hmm, but the problem states that unless stated otherwise, gases are perfect. But since the question is about the Joule-Thomson coefficient, which is a real gas property, perhaps we can assume it's a real gas here.

Wait, but without the value of μ, how can I compute ΔT? Maybe I missed something. Oh wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula involving the number of moles and other properties, not just μ. But the question says to compute the temperature change using the Joule-Thomson coefficient, so perhaps I just need μ and the pressure change.

Wait, but I don't have the value of μ for refrigerant 123. The problem doesn't provide it. So maybe I'm supposed to compute it from other data. But without additional data, I can't. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe I can use an alternative approach, like the equation for an adiabatic process.

Wait, but for an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic process, the temperature change is given by PV^γ = constant, but since this is a real gas, that approach might not work. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the approximation that the temperature change is given by ΔT = n*Cv*(T2 - T1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that in an adiabatic process for a real gas, the work done is related to the enthalpy change. Or maybe using the equation dT = μ dP + (∂T/∂P)_H something. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of enthalpy. Because the Joule-Thomson expansion is at constant enthalpy, but this process isn't exactly that because it's adiabatic, so perhaps I'm mixing two different concepts.

Wait, the Joule-Thomson effect occurs when a gas expands without doing work and without heat exchange, so it's an adiabatic process but not necessarily an isenthalpic one. Wait no, the Joule-Thomson process is typically isenthalpic because it's a throttling process, where the enthalpy remains the same. But in our case, the problem says it's an adiabatic expansion, so perhaps it's not the same as the Joule-Thomson process.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think again. The problem gives that it's an adiabatic expansion, and we need to compute the temperature change. So perhaps I can use the first law of thermodynamics for an adiabatic process. The first law is ΔU = Q + W. Since Q=0 (adiabatic), ΔU = W, where W is the work done by the system.

But wait, in expansion, the system does work on the surroundings, so W is negative. So ΔU would be negative, implying that the internal energy decreases. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature, so a decrease in U would mean a decrease in T, but for real gases, it's more complicated.

But without knowing Cv or other properties, I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relation involving the Joule-Thomson coefficient, but I'm stuck because I don't have μ.

Wait, the question says that the Joule-Thomson coefficient can be computed from the data in the reference, but since I don't have that data, perhaps I'm supposed to use a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the approximation that for small pressure changes, the temperature change is given by ΔT ≈ μ * (P1 - P2), where μ is the Joule-Thomson coefficient at the initial conditions.

Wait, but without knowing μ, I can't compute ΔT. So maybe the question expects me to use some standard value or perhaps it's a typo, and the data is provided elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use the molar gas constant R and some other properties, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read it again.

The question gives that it's an adiabatic expansion of 2.0 moles from 1.5 bar to 0.5 bar at 50°C. The initial temperature is 50°C, which is 323.15 K.

Wait, maybe I can relate the work done during expansion to the temperature change using the first law. For an ideal gas, the work done during an isothermal expansion is nRT ln(V2/V1), but this isn't isothermal. For an adiabatic process, the work is related to the temperature change via ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

But since it's a real gas, I can't assume Cv is constant or ideal gas behavior. So I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula involving the Joule-Thomson coefficient, but I'm not given μ. Wait, perhaps I can compute μ using other thermodynamic properties. The Joule-Thomson coefficient can be expressed in terms of other properties like Cp, the isothermal compressibility, and the thermal expansion coefficient.

The formula is μ = (∂T/∂P)_H = (1/Cp) [ T (∂V/∂T)_P - V ]

But without knowing V, (∂V/∂T)_P, or Cp for refrigerant 123 at these conditions, I can't compute μ.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the value of μ from the reference, but since I don't have access to it, maybe I should proceed with an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the approximation that the process is isenthalpic, but that's not necessarily the case here because it's an adiabatic expansion, not a throttling process. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for an adiabatic process in a real gas, the change in temperature can be approximated using the Joule-Thomson coefficient times the pressure change, but I'm not sure if that's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relation between temperatures and pressures via the ideal gas law, but that wouldn't account for real gas behavior.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of enthalpy. For a real gas, the enthalpy change during expansion is given by dH = Cp dT + [V - T (∂V/∂T)_P ] dP.

But since the process is adiabatic and Q=0, but not necessarily isenthalpic, I'm not sure how to relate this. Maybe I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the process is isenthalpic, which would make it a Joule-Thomson expansion, and then use the formula ΔT = μ ΔP. But without μ, I can't compute it.

I'm stuck because I don't have the value of μ, and without it, I can't proceed. But the problem must have enough information to solve it. Maybe I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, the problem mentions that the refrigerant is expanding adiabatically from 1.5 bar to 0.5 bar. So perhaps the process is a Joule-Thomson expansion, which is adiabatic and isenthalpic. But then, I'd need μ to find ΔT. Since I don't have μ, I can't compute it, which suggests that maybe the problem is using an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula for the temperature change in an adiabatic process for a real gas, which is ΔT = (μ) * (P1 - P2). So if I can find μ from the reference data, which I don't have, but maybe the problem expects me to know a typical value for μ for refrigerant 123 at these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an approximation. For many gases, μ is positive at room temperature, meaning that they cool upon expansion. But I'm not sure about refrigerant 123.

Wait, let me try to think of the possible answers. The options are all negative, which suggests that the temperature is dropping. So the refrigerant is cooling upon expansion, implying that μ is positive.

If I had to guess, perhaps the μ for this refrigerant is around 5 K/bar or something like that. Let me see: the pressure change is 1.0 bar (from 1.5 to 0.5), so if μ is about 5 K/bar, then ΔT would be 5 * (-1) = -5 K, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe μ is lower.

Wait, looking at the options: option C is -5.50 K, option E is -3.75, option A is -4.25, and option J is -4.50.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the relation between the temperature change and the pressure change without considering the number of moles because the Joule-Thomson coefficient is a molar property. So maybe the number of moles doesn't affect the temperature change in this context.

Wait, the formula ΔT = μ * (P1 - P2) doesn't involve the number of moles, because μ is per mole. So for 2.0 moles, the temperature change would still be the same per mole, so the total temperature change is the same as for one mole. So the number of moles might not affect the result in this case.

Hmm, so if I had μ, I could compute ΔT as μ times (P1 - P2). But without μ, I can't do that. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas law to compute the work done and then relate that to the temperature change via the heat capacity. Let me try that approach.

For an ideal gas, the work done during an adiabatic expansion is given, and the first law says ΔU = -W (since the system does work on the surroundings). For an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

So, if I can compute the work done, I can find ΔT.

But wait, how do I compute the work done in an adiabatic process for a real gas? That's tricky because for real gases, the equations are more complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a reversible adiabatic expansion, but that's not necessarily accurate.

Wait, but the problem says to assume perfect gases unless stated otherwise. Wait, but the question is about computing the Joule-Thomson coefficient, which is a real gas property. So perhaps the problem is a bit conflicting in its assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to treat the refrigerant as an ideal gas, in which case the temperature doesn't change during a Joule-Thomson expansion, so ΔT would be zero. But none of the options is zero, so that can't be right.

Wait, but the process is an adiabatic expansion, not necessarily a Joule-Thomson process. So maybe I should treat it as an adiabatic process for an ideal gas.

For an ideal gas, an adiabatic process follows PV^γ = constant, where γ = Cp/Cv.

The relation between temperatures and pressures in an adiabatic process is T1^(γ-1) * P1^(-γ+1) = T2^(γ-1) * P2^(-γ+1).

Wait, the formula I remember is T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^((γ-1)/γ).

So if I can find γ for refrigerant 123, I can compute T2.

But without knowing γ, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that γ is 1.4 (like diatomic gases), but that's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute γ if I know Cp
