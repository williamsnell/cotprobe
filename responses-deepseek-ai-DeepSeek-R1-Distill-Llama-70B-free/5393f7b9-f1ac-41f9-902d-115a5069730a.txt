Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about businesses and their role in society. The sentence has three blanks, and I need to fill them in correctly using the options provided.

The first part is "Businesses have _____ within society...". I think about what businesses do. They're pretty influential, right? They create jobs, drive the economy, and often have a lot of resources. So the first blank probably relates to their level of influence or power. Options like 'huge power' or 'significant power' come to mind.

The second blank is about the potential to provide something to society. Businesses can contribute in various waysâ€”like innovation, job creation, and sometimes through corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. So maybe the second part is about a 'major contribution'.

The third part says "...while ____ has the potential to inflict enormous harm." This sounds like the negative aspect. What causes harm? Maybe unethical practices, like pollution, exploitation, or other malpractices. Terms like 'business malpractice' or 'corporate irresponsibility' could fit here.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Little power, Small contribution, Business malpractice. Hmm, I don't think businesses have little power; they have a lot. So A might not be right.

Option B: Minimal power, No contribution, Business malpractice. Again, minimal power doesn't seem right. Also, businesses do contribute, so 'no contribution' is off.

Option C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility. Wait, the third part is about causing harm. But CSR is about doing good. So this doesn't fit because the third blank should be a negative term.

Option D: Huge power, No contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No contribution doesn't make sense. Businesses do contribute, so D is out.

Option E: Little power, Major contribution, Business ethics. Little power is wrong. Plus, business ethics is more about doing right, not causing harm.

Option F: Significant power, Major contribution, Business malpractice. That fits. Businesses have significant power, can make major contributions, and business malpractice (like unethical actions) can cause harm.

Option G: Little power, Major contribution, Business ethics. Again, little power is incorrect, and business ethics is positive.

Option H: Minimal power, Significant contribution, Corporate social responsibility. Minimal power is wrong, and CSR is positive.

Option I: Significant power, Minor contribution, Corporate social responsibility. Minor contribution doesn't sound right. Businesses contribute a lot.

Option J: Huge power, Major contribution, Business malpractice. This also fits. Businesses have huge power, contribute majorly, and business malpractice causes harm.

Wait, so both F and J look correct. Let me read the blanks again. The question uses "provide a ____ to society while ____ has the potential to inflict harm." So the first two blanks are about positive aspects, and the third is the negative. So the third term should be a negative action.

In the options, F and J both have 'business malpractice' as the third term, which is correct. Now, the first part: significant vs. huge power. I think 'huge' is more accurate because businesses, especially large corporations, have enormous influence. So J says 'huge power' and 'major contribution', which fits better.

So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J. Businesses have huge power within society, can provide a major contribution, and business malpractice can cause significant harm.
