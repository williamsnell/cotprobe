Okay, so I've got this problem here about fencing a yard. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question says that a total of x feet of fencing is to form three sides of a level rectangular yard. I need to find the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x. Hmm, alright.

Wait, three sides? So it's a rectangle, which means opposite sides are equal. But if it's three sides, maybe it's like one length and two widths, or maybe two lengths and one width. I'm not sure yet. Let me think about how the fencing is arranged.

So, the yard is rectangular, so it has two lengths and two widths. But the fencing is only for three sides. That probably means that one side is missing, so maybe one of the longer sides isn't fenced. Or wait, maybe it's a different configuration. Let me draw a mental picture.

Let's say the yard has a length and a width. If we're fencing three sides, it could be that one length and two widths are fenced. Or two lengths and one width. Which one would give the maximum area? Hmmm. Actually, the problem doesn't specify which sides are fenced, so I might have to consider the general case and see which setup would allow me to maximize the area.

Wait, but maybe the problem implies that one side isn't fenced, like maybe it's along a wall or something. So, for example, if the yard is against a building, then only three sides need fencing: two widths and one length. So in that case, the fencing would consist of 2 widths plus 1 length equals x feet.

So, let me set up some variables. Let me call the length L and the width W. Then, the total fencing is L + 2W = x.

But wait, another possibility is that the fencing is 2L + W = x. Which one makes more sense? Hmm, I think it's more common to have the longer side opposite the building, so perhaps the fencing would be one length and two widths. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the problem is just general, and I have to consider the setup that would maximize the area.

Wait, but the problem specifically says three sides, so the fencing could be arranged in either way. To get the maximum area, perhaps the optimal is when the arrangement is such that the sides are in a certain proportion.

Wait, I think the standard approach for maximizing area with a given perimeter is to have a square. But since this is three sides, it's a bit different. Let me think again.

So, let's model it as two widths and one length. So the fencing is L + 2W = x. The area A is L * W. I need to express A in terms of x and find its maximum.

So, from the fencing equation, we can solve for L in terms of W: L = x - 2W.

Then, substitute that into the area equation: A = (x - 2W) * W = xW - 2W².

Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of W. It's a downward-opening parabola, so the maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola given by A = -2W² + xW is at W = -b/(2a), where a is -2 and b is x. So W = -x/(2*(-2)) = x/(4).

So W is x/4. Now, substitute back into L = x - 2W: L = x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2.

So the dimensions that maximize the area are L = x/2 and W = x/4. The area A would then be (x/2) * (x/4) = x²/8. Wait, but let me check that again. x/2 multiplied by x/4 is indeed x squared over 8.

Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap. We set up L + 2W = x. Expressed L as x - 2W. Then A = W*(x - 2W) = xW - 2W². The derivative of A with respect to W is x - 4W. Setting derivative to zero: x-4W=0 → W = x/4. Then L = x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2. So A is (x/2)(x/4) = x²/8.

So that would be option D: x²/8. Alternatively, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2x^2

B: x^2/6

C: x^3/8

D: x^2/8

E: x^2/4

F: x^2/9

G: x^2/16

H: x^2/12

I: x^2

J: x^2/2

So D is x²/8, which is what I calculated.

But wait, another approach: what if we consider that the fencing is 2L + W = x? Let me see if that gives a different result.

So in that case, if fencing is 2L + W = x, then W = x - 2L.

Area A = L * (x - 2L) = xL - 2L². Take derivative: dA/dL = x -4L. Set to zero: x=4L → L= x/4. Then W = x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2. So then A = (x/4)*(x/2) = x²/8. Same result.

Oh, so regardless of whether the fencing is arranged as L + 2W or 2L + W, the maximum area is the same. Interesting. So both cases lead to the same maximum area.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. In the first case, when I set L +2W=x, I got L=x/2 and W=x/4. In the second case, 2L + W =x, I got L=x/4 and W=x/2. So the roles of L and W are swapped, but since in a rectangle, length and width are interchangeable, the maximum area remains the same.

So in both cases, the maximum area is x²/8, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we need to maximize the area of a rectangular yard that is fenced on three sides with a total of \( x \) feet of fencing. The yard can be arranged such that either one length and two widths are fenced (\( L + 2W = x \)) or two lengths and one width are fenced (\( 2L + W = x \)). Both configurations lead to the same maximum area.

### Case 1: Fencing arrangement \( L + 2W = x \)
1. Express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):  
   \[
   L = x - 2W
   \]
2. The area \( A \) is given by \( A = L \cdot W \). Substituting \( L = x - 2W \):  
   \[
   A = (x - 2W) \cdot W = xW - 2W^2
   \]
3. This is a quadratic equation in \( W \), and its maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of \( A = -2W^2 + xW \) is at:  
   \[
   W = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-x}{2(-2)} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]
4. Substitute \( W = \frac{x}{4} \) back into \( L = x - 2W \):  
   \[
   L = x - 2 \cdot \frac{x}{4} = x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]
5. The maximum area is:  
   \[
   A = L \cdot W = \frac{x}{2} \cdot \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x^2}{8}
   \]

### Case 2: Fencing arrangement \( 2L + W = x \)
1. Express \( W \) in terms of \( L \):  
   \[
   W = x - 2L
   \]
2. The area \( A \) is given by \( A = L \cdot W \). Substituting \( W = x - 2L \):  
   \[
   A = L \cdot (x - 2L) = xL - 2L^2
   \]
3. This is a quadratic equation in \( L \), and its maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of \( A = -2L^2 + xL \) is at:  
   \[
   L = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-x}{2(-2)} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]
4. Substitute \( L = \frac{x}{4} \) back into \( W = x - 2L \):  
   \[
   W = x - 2 \cdot \frac{x}{4} = x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]
5. The maximum area is:  
   \[
   A = L \cdot W = \frac{x}{4} \cdot \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x^2}{8}
   \]

### Conclusion
In both cases, the maximum area of the yard is \( \frac{x^2}{8} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: \( \frac{x^2}{8} \)**
