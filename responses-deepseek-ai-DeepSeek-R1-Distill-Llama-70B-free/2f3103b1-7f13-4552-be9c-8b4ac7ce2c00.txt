Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that Mill Co. reported a pretax income of $152,500 for the year ended December 31. But during the audit, the auditors found two errors. The first is that the ending inventory was overstated by $30,000, and the second is that depreciation expense was understated by $64,000. I need to find out what the correct pretax income should be after adjusting for these errors.

Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling some basics. Pretax income is calculated as revenues minus expenses. So any errors that affect the revenues or expenses will impact the pretax income.

First error: Ending inventory was overstated by $30,000. Wait, how does that affect the financial statements? I remember that ending inventory is an asset on the balance sheet, but in terms of the income statement, it affects the cost of goods sold (COGS). 

When inventory is overstated at the end of the period, that means the company thinks it has more inventory left than it actually does. So COGS would be understated because COGS is calculated as beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. If ending inventory is too high, COGS is too low. 

Wait, so if COGS is understated, that means expenses are lower than they should be. Because COGS is an expense on the income statement. So lower COGS means higher net income. But in this case, the error is that the company overstated ending inventory, leading to understated COGS. So the reported pretax income would have been higher than it should be. 

But wait, the company initially reported pretax income as $152,500. Since ending inventory was overstated, that means their COGS was understated, leading to higher pretax income. So to correct this, we need to decrease the pretax income by the amount that COGS was understated. 

Wait, but wait. If ending inventory is overstated by $30,000, then COGS is understated by $30,000. Because COGS should have been higher by $30k. So the correction would be to increase COGS by $30k, which would decrease pretax income by $30k. 

So that's the first adjustment: subtract $30,000 from the reported pretax income.

Now the second error: Depreciation expense was understated by $64,000. Depreciation is an expense, so if it's understated, that means the company didn't record enough expense. So the reported pretax income would be higher than it should be because expenses are lower. 

So to correct this, we need to increase the depreciation expense by $64,000. Which would decrease the pretax income by $64,000.

So now, putting it all together. The original pretax income is $152,500. The two errors both require us to decrease this amount.

First error: subtract $30k. Second error: subtract $64k. So total adjustment is $94,000 subtracted from $152,500.

Let me do the math: 152,500 minus 30,000 is 122,500. Then subtract another 64,000: 122,500 - 64,000 = 58,500.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I got the direction wrong. Let me think again.

Ending inventory overstatement affects COGS. If ending inventory is higher than it should be, COGS is lower because COGS = beginning inventory + purchases - ending inventory. So if ending inventory is higher, COGS is lower, which makes gross profit higher, leading to higher pretax income. So the error caused the company to report a higher pretax income than they should have. So to correct, we subtract the $30k overstatement from the reported pretax income.

Similarly, if depreciation was understated, that means the company's expenses were too low, so their pretax income was too high. Correcting that would require adding the $64k to the expense, thus reducing pretax income by $64k.

So yes, both adjustments are reductions. So the correct pretax income is 152,500 - 30,000 - 64,000 = 58,500.

Looking at the options, option H is $58,500. So the correct answer must be H.

To determine the correct pretax income for Mill Co., we need to adjust the reported pretax income of $152,500 for the two errors discovered during the audit:

1. **Overstated Ending Inventory**: Ending inventory was overstated by $30,000. This means cost of goods sold (COGS) was understated by $30,000, leading to an overstatement of pretax income. To correct this, pretax income must be reduced by $30,000.

2. **Understated Depreciation Expense**: Depreciation expense was understated by $64,000. This means expenses were too low, resulting in an overstatement of pretax income. To correct this, pretax income must be reduced by $64,000.

The total adjustment is $30,000 + $64,000 = $94,000. Subtracting this from the reported pretax income:

\[
\text{Correct Pretax Income} = \$152,500 - \$30,000 - \$64,000 = \$58,500
\]

Thus, the correct pretax income for Mill Co. is **$58,500**, which corresponds to option **H**.
