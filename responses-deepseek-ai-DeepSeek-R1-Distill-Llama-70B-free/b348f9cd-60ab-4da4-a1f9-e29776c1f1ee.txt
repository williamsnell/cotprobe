Question:

Explain why the average fixed cost curve (AFC) slopes down-ward throughout, while the average variable cost curve (AVC) slopes down at first, but then turns upward.

Options:

A: The AFC slopes downward due to a decrease in demand for the product, while the AVC slopes upward from the start due to increasing variable costs.
B: The AFC slopes upward as quantity increases
C: The AFC slopes downward because it represents the spread of fixed costs over an increasing number of units, while the AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise.
D: The AVC turns upward due to an increase in fixed inputs
E: The AFC slopes downward as quantity increases because of increased efficiency in production, while the AVC initially decreases due to underutilization of variable inputs and then increases because of market forces.
F: The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the average fixed cost per unit decreases. The AVC slopes down at first due to fuller utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization but then turns upward due to the law of diminishing returns.
G: The AFC remains constant throughout because it is independent of output, and the AVC slopes downward indefinitely as economies of scale are realized.
H: The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the total fixed cost is spread over more units. The AVC initially falls due to technological advances, but then rises because of increased labor costs.
I: The AVC always slopes downwards
J: Both the AFC and AVC slope downward as quantity increases due to continuous improvements in production technology and efficiency.

Okay, so I have this economics question about the average fixed cost (AFC) and average variable cost (AVC) curves. I remember that these are concepts from cost curves in microeconomics. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking why the AFC slopes downward all the time, while the AVC first slopes down and then turns upward. I think I remember that AFC is calculated by dividing total fixed costs (TFC) by the quantity produced (Q). Since TFC is constant, as Q increases, the denominator gets bigger, so AFC decreases. That makes the AFC curve slope downward continuously. So AFC = TFC/Q, which means as Q goes up, AFC goes down.

Now for the AVC. AVC is average variable cost, which is total variable cost (TVC) divided by Q. TVC includes things like labor and materials that vary with output. Initially, when a firm increases production, it might experience decreasing AVC because of increasing marginal returns or better utilization of variable inputs. Wait, no, wait. AVC's behavior is related to the underlying production function and the law of diminishing returns.

I think as output increases, AVC first decreases because of increasing returns—maybe due to specialization or more efficient use of variable inputs. But after a certain point, diminishing returns set in. Oh right, the law of diminishing marginal returns. So variable costs start increasing because each additional unit adds more to the cost than the previous one. So AVC decreases at first, then increases, making the curve U-shaped.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly describes both AFC and AVC behavior.

Option A: AFC slopes down due to decreasing demand. No, that's not right. AFC is about fixed costs spread over more units, not demand. So A is wrong.

Option B: AFC slopes upward. No, I thought AFC slopes downward as Q increases. So B is incorrect.

Option C: AFC slopes down because fixed costs spread over more units. AVC initially decreases due to fixed inputs proportion, then increases as variable input prices rise. Hmm. Wait, when variable inputs are increased, their prices might rise if the firm is a big buyer, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason. Usually, the AVC rising is due to diminishing returns, not necessarily input price increases unless it's a monopsony situation. But the option says variable input prices rise. I'm not certain, but maybe it's close.

Option D: AVC turns up due to increase in fixed inputs. No, fixed inputs are part of fixed costs, not variable. AVC is about variable costs, so D is wrong.

Option E: AFC down due to increased efficiency. I thought AFC is down because fixed costs spread, not efficiency. Efficiency gains would affect variable costs, maybe. AVC decreases because underutilized variable inputs, then increases due to market forces. Not sure about that reasoning. Maybe not the best option.

Option F: AFC slopes down because fixed cost per unit decreases as Q increases. That's correct. AVC slopes down first due to fuller utilization of fixed inputs and specialization, then turns up due to the law of diminishing returns. That sounds right. Fuller utilization of fixed inputs would mean better use of, say, machinery, leading to lower AVC. Then diminishing returns (as more variable inputs are added, each adds less output) cause AVC to rise. So F seems correct.

Option G: AFC remains constant. No, AFC decreases as Q increases, so G is wrong.

Option H: AFC down because fixed costs spread. AVC initially falls due to tech advances, then rises due to labor costs. Tech advances might cause AVC to fall, but I think the initial decrease is more about increasing returns, not tech. So H's reasoning might not be the standard explanation.

Option I: AVC always slopes down. No, AVC is U-shaped, so I is wrong.

Option J: Both slope down due to tech and efficiency. No, AFC slopes down, but AVC doesn't keep sloping down. J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be either C or F.

Let me re-read the options.

Option C says AVC initially decreases due to fixed proportion of inputs. Wait, fixed proportion doesn't sound right. AVC decreases when variable inputs are used more efficiently, like when more labor is added and marginal product increases. So maybe that's the increasing returns phase. Then AVC increases as variable input prices rise. But I'm not sure if variable input prices are the main cause. Usually, it's because of diminishing returns, not higher input prices.

Option F says AVC slopes down because of fuller utilization of fixed inputs and specialization, then up due to diminishing returns. That aligns with what I remember. AVC decreases because, with more production, fixed inputs like machinery are used more efficiently. Each additional unit adds more output, so average variable cost per unit decreases. Then, as production increases beyond a point, adding more variable inputs (like labor) leads to diminishing returns—each additional unit adds less output, so the marginal cost increases, making AVC rise.

So F seems more accurate in its reasoning than C. Therefore, the correct answer should be F.
</think>

The average fixed cost (AFC) slopes downward throughout because it represents the spread of fixed costs over an increasing number of units. As the quantity produced (Q) increases, the denominator in the AFC formula (AFC = TFC/Q) grows, causing AFC to decline continuously.

The average variable cost (AVC) curve, on the other hand, is U-shaped. Initially, AVC decreases as output increases due to fuller utilization of fixed inputs, specialization, and increasing returns. This phase occurs because additional variable inputs, such as labor, are added in a way that enhances productivity, reducing the average variable cost per unit. However, as production continues to expand, the law of diminishing returns sets in. Beyond a certain point, adding more variable inputs leads to decreasing marginal returns, causing the average variable cost to rise.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. AFC slopes downward due to the spread of fixed costs, not demand, and AVC does not slope upward from the start.
- **B**: Incorrect. AFC slopes downward, not upward.
- **C**: Partially correct but misleading. While AFC slopes downward due to the spread of fixed costs, the reasoning for AVC is inaccurate. AVC increases due to diminishing returns, not necessarily rising variable input prices.
- **D**: Incorrect. AVC turns upward due to diminishing returns, not increases in fixed inputs.
- **E**: Incorrect. AFC slopes downward due to the spread of fixed costs, not efficiency, and the reasoning for AVC is unclear.
- **F**: Correct. AFC slopes downward as fixed costs are spread over more units, and AVC decreases initially due to fuller utilization of fixed inputs and specialization, then increases due to diminishing returns.
- **G**: Incorrect. AFC does not remain constant; it decreases as Q increases.
- **H**: Incorrect. While AFC slopes downward, the reasoning for AVC is flawed, as the initial decrease is due to increasing returns, not technological advances.
- **I**: Incorrect. AVC is U-shaped, not always decreasing.
- **J**: Incorrect. Both AFC and AVC do not slope downward continuously; AVC eventually turns upward.

The correct answer is **F**, as it accurately explains the behavior of both AFC and AVC.
