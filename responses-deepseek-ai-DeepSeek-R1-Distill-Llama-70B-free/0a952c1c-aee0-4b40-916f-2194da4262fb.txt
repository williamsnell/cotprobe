Okay, so I've got this question about dividends for a company, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the company is Novelco Corporation. They have two types of stocks: cumulative preferred stock and common stock. The preferred stock has 1,000 shares outstanding, each with a par value of $100 and a dividend rate of 6%. The common stock has 20,000 shares. 

In the first two years, the company had certain amounts available for dividends. First year, none, and the second year, $14,000. I need to find out how much each class of stock gets each year.

Hmm, I remember that preferred stock typically has priority over common stock when it comes to dividends. Also, since it's cumulative, that probably means that any unpaid dividends from previous years must be paid before common stockholders get anything.

Let me break it down. First, calculate the annual dividend for the preferred stock. Each share has a par value of $100 and a 6% dividend rate. So per share, that's 100 * 0.06 = $6 per year. Since there are 1,000 shares, the total annual preferred dividend is 1,000 * 6 = $6,000 per year.

Now, the first year, the company had no money for dividends. That means preferred stockholders didn't get their $6,000 that year. Because it's cumulative, that amount would accumulate and need to be paid in the following years before any common dividends.

In the second year, the company has $14,000 available. So first, they have to pay the preferred stockholders. But wait, the preferred is cumulative, so the second year's preferred dividend is $6,000 plus the $6,000 from the first year that wasn't paid. So total preferred dividends owed are $12,000.

But wait, the company only has $14,000 available in the second year. So they pay the $12,000 to preferred stock first. That leaves $14,000 - $12,000 = $2,000 left for common stock.

So for each year:

- First year: No dividends for anyone.
- Second year: Preferred gets $12,000 (which includes the $6k from first year and $6k for second), and common gets $2k.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one. The options are about per year, but the question is asking for the dividends per year for each class. Wait, no, the question says "find the dividends per year for each class of stock." Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for each year's dividend, but the way it's phrased is a bit unclear.

Wait, the question says: "Find the dividends per year for each class of stock." So for each year, how much each class gets. But the first year, nothing was available, so both get zero. The second year, $14k is available. So in the second year, preferred gets their two years' worth, and common gets what's left.

Wait, but the options don't list per-year amounts for each year. Instead, the options are giving totals, perhaps for both years. Or maybe not. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: $9,000 for preferred and $5k for common

Wait, but each option seems to present a pair of numbers, perhaps the total for each class over the two years. Alternatively, maybe each option is the per-year distribution for each class in each of the two years. Hmm, the question isn't entirely clear, but the way the options are structured, I think each option is showing the total for each class across the two years.

Wait, no, the question says, "dividents per year for each class of stock." So perhaps it's asking, for each year, how much each class gets. But the options don't have two sets of numbers, so I think maybe the question is referring to the total dividends each class received in each of the two years.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

First Year:

- Available for dividends: $0.

Since preferred is cumulative, in year one, no dividends paid to anyone. So both classes get $0.

Second Year:

- Available: $14,000.

Preferred stock is entitled to two years' worth because it's cumulative. So for the first year, $6k, and second year another $6k, totaling $12k. So the company pays $12k to preferred, leaving $2k for common.

So in the second year, preferred gets $12k, common gets $2k.

So the question is, what are the dividends per year for each class. So for each year, how much did each class get.

Wait, but the options don't present it that way. Let me look at the options again.

Option E is $12k for preferred and $2k for common. That would align with the second year's distribution. But the first year, both are zero. However, the options don't seem to present per-year data. Maybe the question is asking for the total over the two years. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "Find the dividends per year for each class of stock." So perhaps it's asking, for each year, what each class receives. But the options don't present two sets of figures, so perhaps the question is about the second year's distribution.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the dividends each class receives in the second year, considering the accumulated dividends. So in the second year, the preferred would get $12k (two years' worth) and the common would get $2k.

Looking at the options, option E is $12k for preferred and $2k for common. So that would be the correct choice.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check.

Each year, preferred is supposed to get $6k. Since in the first year, nothing was paid, the second year must pay both years' preferred dividends first. So $6k * 2 = $12k to preferred, leaving $14k - $12k = $2k for common.

So yes, option E matches this.
</think>

The Novelco Corporation has 1,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock and 20,000 shares of common stock. The preferred stock has a par value of $100 per share and pays a 6% dividend rate, resulting in an annual dividend of $6 per share, or $6,000 in total for all preferred shares. The common stock does not have a fixed dividend rate.

In the first year, no dividends were paid to either class of stock. In the second year, $14,000 was available for dividends. Since the preferred stock is cumulative, the company must first pay the unpaid $6,000 from the first year, plus the $6,000 for the second year, totaling $12,000 for preferred stock. This leaves $14,000 - $12,000 = $2,000 for common stock in the second year.

Thus, in the second year, the preferred stock receives $12,000, and the common stock receives $2,000. This matches option E.

**Answer: E**
