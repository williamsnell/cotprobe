Question:

Which of the following statements most detracts from the claim that the human appendix is a completely vestigial organ?

Options:

A: The size of the appendix varies greatly among individuals.
B: Individuals with a larger-than-average appendix leave fewer offspring than those with a below-average-sized appendix.
C: The appendix is located near the large intestine.
D: The appendix is not present in all mammal species.
E: The appendix can be surgically removed with no immediate ill effects.
F: The appendix might have been larger in fossil hominids.
G: The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue.
H: The appendix is often inflamed in cases of appendicitis.
I: Many people live healthy lives without an appendix after it's been removed.
J: The appendix has no known function in digestion.

Okay, so I have this question about the human appendix and whether it's a completely vestigial organ. Hmm, I remember that vestigial organs are those that have lost their original function through evolution. The question is asking which statement would most detract from the claim that the appendix is vestigial. So, I need to find the option that suggests the appendix has some function, which would mean it's not completely vestigial.

Looking at the options:

A: The size varies among individuals. I'm not sure how that affects vestigial status. Maybe if it's variable, but function isn't clear.

B: People with larger appendixes have fewer offspring. That might suggest a negative effect, but I don't see how that directly shows the appendix has a function now.

C: It's near the large intestine. That's more about location, not function. Maybe proximity to other organs, but not sure.

D: Not present in all mammals. Well, if it's not present in some, that might support it being vestigial, but some species might have lost it.

E: Can be removed without ill effects. That supports it being vestigial because it's not needed.

F: Was larger in fossils. That might suggest it had a function before, but not that it does now.

G: Has a lot of defensive lymphatic tissue. Oh, wait, that sounds like it has a function, maybe in the immune system. So if it's contributing to immune defense, that would mean it's not completely vestigial.

H: Often inflamed in appendicitis. Inflammation doesn't imply function, just that it's prone to issues.

I: People live healthy lives without it. Again, supports vestigial.

J: No known function in digestion. That supports vestigial because no clear role.

So the question is which one most detracts, meaning which one shows the appendix still has a function. Option G says it has substantial defensive lymphatic tissue, implying it plays a role in immunity. So that would argue against it being vestigial because it has a function now.

The question asks which statement most detracts from the claim that the human appendix is a completely vestigial organ. A vestigial organ is one that has lost its original function through evolution. To answer this, we need to identify the option that suggests the appendix has some current functional role, which would undermine the claim of it being vestigial.

- **A**: The size of the appendix varies among individuals. This does not directly indicate a functional role, so it does not strongly detract from the claim.  
- **B**: Individuals with a larger-than-average appendix leave fewer offspring. This suggests a possible negative effect but does not demonstrate a current function.  
- **C**: The appendix is located near the large intestine. This is about location, not function, and does not detract from the claim.  
- **D**: The appendix is not present in all mammal species. This supports the idea of vestigiality rather than detracting from it.  
- **E**: The appendix can be surgically removed with no immediate ill effects. This supports the claim of vestigiality.  
- **F**: The appendix might have been larger in fossil hominids. This suggests a historical function but not a current one.  
- **G**: The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue. This indicates a potential role in the immune system, suggesting the appendix has a current function and is not entirely vestigial.  
- **H**: The appendix is often inflamed in cases of appendicitis. Inflammation does not imply function.  
- **I**: Many people live healthy lives without an appendix after it's been removed. This supports the claim of vestigiality.  
- **J**: The appendix has no known function in digestion. This also supports the claim of vestigiality.  

The correct answer is **G**, as it directly suggests that the appendix has a functional role in the immune system, which detracts from the claim that it is completely vestigial.

Answer: G
