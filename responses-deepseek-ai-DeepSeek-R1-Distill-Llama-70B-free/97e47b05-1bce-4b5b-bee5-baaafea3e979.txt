Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it carefully. The question is about a very slow-moving positron interacting with a stationary electron. I need to determine which statement correctly describes a possible outcome and why.

Hmm, positrons are the antimatter counterpart of electrons, right? So when they meet, I remember that annihilation usually happens. But wait, what exactly happens in annihilation?

I think when an electron and positron annihilate each other, they convert their mass into energy, typically producing gamma rays. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me think about the conservation laws here.

First, let's consider conservation of charge. The positron has a +1 charge, and the electron has -1. When they annihilate, the total charge is zero. So any particles produced must have a net charge of zero. That means options suggesting a positively charged particle are probably wrong. Looking at the options, option F says a new particle with positive charge, which can't be right because charge must be conserved. So F is out.

Next, conservation of momentum. Since the positron is moving very slowly and the electron is stationary, the total momentum before the reaction is almost zero. So after the reaction, the total momentum must still be zero. How can that happen? Well, if two photons are produced, they can go in opposite directions with equal energy and momentum. That way, their momenta cancel each other out. So option C says this, which sounds correct. Let me check the other options.

Option A suggests three identical gamma rays moving in different directions. But three photons would have to balance each other's momenta. That's possible, but I think the simplest case is two photons. Also, the question is about a possible outcome, so both C and A could be possible, but which is more correct?

Wait, the initial momentum is almost zero because the positron is very slow. So the total system's momentum is near zero. If two photons are produced, their momenta would be equal and opposite, totaling zero. That makes sense. So option C is a possible outcome. Option A is less likely because three photons would require a more complex arrangement, but it's not impossible. But the question is about which statement is correct, not which is the only possibility.

What about the other options? Option B says that a new particle's mass equals the combined masses. Wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass. So if they create a new particle, its mass would be at least as much as their combined rest mass. But wait, when they annihilate, they don't create a massive particle but rather energy. Unless in some cases... Oh wait, sometimes matter and antimatter can form a particle-antiparticle pair, but in this case, they annihilate into photons. Alternatively, if they form something like a meson, but I think that's more when they're moving at high speeds. Since the positron is slow, maybe it's more about annihilation into photons.

So looking back, option B says that if a single new particle is created, its mass must equal the combined masses. Wait, because the electron and positron each have mass m, so combined 2m. But energy is also a factor. Because the positron is moving, it has some kinetic energy. So the total energy is more than just 2m cÂ². So any new particle would have mass less than the total energy, but in this case, the kinetic energy is very low because the positron is slow. So the main energy is the rest mass. So if a new particle is formed, its mass would be equal to or less than the sum? Hmm, not sure, but this is getting complicated. Maybe B is correct, but I need to think more.

Option D says the reaction can't occur because the masses are too different. But electrons and positrons have the same mass, so D is wrong.

Option E says the positron gains momentum. But since the positron is very slow and the electron is stationary, I don't think that's possible because the electron can't just stay stationary if they interact. E sounds wrong.

Option G says a new particle with mass larger than the combined. But energy from the collision is barely enough to cover their rest masses. So creating a larger mass would require more energy, which isn't present here. So G is incorrect.

Option H says all new particles have no charge. Well, photons are uncharged, so if they produce photons, that's correct. But wait, is that always the case? Suppose they produce a Z boson or something, but no, that's high energy. At low energy, annihilation into photons is more likely. So H could be correct if the outcome is photons. But looking at the options, C and H might both be correct in some sense. But the question is about which statement is correct.

Option I says the antimatter positron annihilates into energy, leaving the electron. But that doesn't make sense because annihilation requires both particles. They can't leave one behind. So I is wrong.

Option J suggests a single gamma ray. But a single photon would mean momentum isn't conserved. Because the initial momentum is almost zero, a single photon moving in any direction would give the system net momentum, violating conservation. So J is incorrect.

So now, looking back, the correct outcome should involve photons. Option C and A are about gamma rays. I think the most straightforward outcome is two photons moving in opposite directions, which would conserve both momentum and energy. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me think about option B again. If a single new particle is created, then its mass would have to be at least 2m (since each has mass m). But wait, positron and electron each have rest mass energy of about 0.511 MeV. Their combined rest mass is about 1.022 MeV. If they form a new particle, its mass must be at least equal to that. But in reality, when they annihilate, they produce photons, which have zero mass. So the option B is saying that if a single new particle is created, it must have mass equal to the combined. But in reality, that's not what happens because in annihilation, they produce photons, not a massive particle. So B is suggesting a scenario that isn't possible. Because they can't form a more massive particle without additional energy. So B is incorrect.

So the correct statement is option C: Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created. Because that's how momentum is conserved when the initial momentum is near zero.

Wait, but another thought: can the annihilation produce two photons? Because each photon has spin 1, and the system must conserve angular momentum. The initial state has the positron and electron with opposite spins (assuming they're annihilating). So the total spin could be zero or two, etc. But when they annihilate into two photons, each with spin 1, their spins can add up to zero in opposite directions. So that works. So yes, option C is correct.

When a very slow-moving positron interacts with a stationary electron, the most likely outcome is annihilation, where the electron and positron convert their mass into energy, typically producing gamma rays. This process must obey several conservation laws: charge, momentum, and energy.

1. **Conservation of Charge**: The positron has a charge of $+1$, and the electron has a charge of $-1$. When they annihilate, the total charge is zero, so any particles produced must also have a net charge of zero. This rules out options involving charged particles, such as option F.

2. **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the positron is moving very slowly and the electron is stationary, the total initial momentum is nearly zero. For momentum to be conserved, the products of the reaction must also have a total momentum of zero. The simplest way this can happen is through the production of two identical gamma rays moving in opposite directions, as described in option C. While option A suggests three gamma rays, this is less likely because it would require a more complex arrangement to balance momentum.

3. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the reaction includes the rest mass energy of the electron and positron, as well as the positron's small kinetic energy. When they annihilate, this energy is converted into the energy of the gamma rays. Option C aligns with this, as two gamma rays can carry the required energy and momentum.

4. **Analysis of Other Options**:
   - Option B is incorrect because the annihilation does not result in a single new particle with mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron. Instead, the mass is converted into energy in the form of gamma rays.
   - Option D is incorrect because the masses of the electron and positron are the same, not "too different."
   - Option E is incorrect because the electron cannot remain stationary during the interaction.
   - Option G is incorrect because the energy available is insufficient to create a particle with mass larger than the combined masses of the electron and positron.
   - Option H is incorrect because while photons are uncharged, this option does not address the momentum conservation that makes two gamma rays the most likely outcome.
   - Option I is incorrect because both the electron and positron annihilate; the electron cannot remain behind.
   - Option J is incorrect because a single gamma ray would violate momentum conservation.

The correct outcome is described by option C: two identical gamma rays moving in opposite directions, ensuring conservation of both momentum and energy.
