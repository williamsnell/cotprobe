Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the US presidential election process. The question is asking what happens if no candidate gets a majority in the Electoral College. Hmm, I remember that the Electoral College is the system where each state gets a certain number of electors based on their population, and the candidates need to get a majority of these electoral votes to win the presidency.

Wait, so if no one has a majority, what happens then? I think the process doesn't just end there. I remember something about the House of Representatives getting involved. Oh right, there's a provision in the Constitution for this scenario. Let me recall... I think it's in Article II, Section 1, something about the House choosing the president if there's no majority.

So, how does that work exactly? I believe each state delegation in the House gets one vote. So, it's not a simple majority of all representatives, but each state's representatives decide together, and each state has one vote. That means a candidate needs to win the majority of the states' votes in the House. I think that's correct.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A says the candidate who wins the majority in the state with the most electoral votes. That doesn't sound right. I don't think it's based on individual state's votes but rather the House as a whole.

Option B is the candidate with the second highest electoral votes. No, that's not it. Because if there's a tie or no majority, the process doesn't just go to the runner-up; it goes to Congress.

Option C says the candidate who wins the most votes in the electoral college. But if no one has a majority, then the highest might not get it. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D is the candidate who wins the majority of votes in the House. Hmm, wait. But isn't it that the House chooses, with each state delegation having one vote? So it's not a majority of the House members, but a majority of the states. So the wording of D is a bit ambiguous. It says "majority of votes in the House," which could imply a simple majority vote among all representatives, but I think it's more about each state having a vote.

Option E is Congress selecting. That's a bit vague because Congress includes both the House and Senate. But I think the actual process is that the House chooses the president, and the Senate chooses the vice president, perhaps. Or maybe the House picks the president and the Senate the VP if the electoral college can't decide for either.

Option F suggests a national popular vote after deadlock, but I don't recall that happening. The Constitution doesn't provide for a popular vote runoff in such cases. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G is the candidate who wins the popular vote. But the US doesn't directly elect the president by popular vote; it's through the Electoral College. So even if someone wins the popular vote, without the electoral majority, the House decides, not automatically the popular vote winner.

Option H is the incumbent vice president. Wait, no, the vice president isn't automatically next in line in this situation unless it's through the 25th Amendment or something. But if the Electoral College can't decide, I don't think the VP becomes president. The VP is elected along with the president, so if the EC can't decide, the House picks the president, and I think the Senate would pick the VP if necessary.

Option I is the majority in the Senate. I don't think the Senate selects the president in this scenario. The Senate might select the vice president, though. So I is probably incorrect.

Option J says the Supreme Court selects. No, the Supreme Court doesn't get involved in choosing the president in this case. They might resolve disputes, but the actual selection would be by Congress.

So putting it all together: When there's no majority in the Electoral College, the House of Representatives chooses the president. Each state delegation gets one vote, and they need a majority of the states to elect the president. 

Looking back at the options, the closest one is E: "Whomever is selected by the United States Congress." But wait, is it Congress as a whole or specifically the House? Because the House and Senate have different roles. The House picks the president, and the Senate picks the VP. So option E is a bit broad, but the correct process is that Congress (specifically the House) selects the president. So E would be the correct answer in this case.

Alternatively, option D says the candidate who wins the majority in the House. But I think the House's method is by state delegation votes, not individual representatives. So the wording of D is misleading because it implies a majority vote among all representatives, which isn't the case.

Therefore, the correct answer should be E, because Congress (specifically the House) selects the president in such a scenario.

When no presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the Constitution provides that the House of Representatives selects the president. Each state delegation in the House gets one vote, and a candidate needs a majority of these state votes to win the presidency. The Senate, on the other hand, would choose the vice president in a similar process if necessary.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J**: These options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the process or suggest entities (e.g., the Supreme Court, popular vote) that do not select the president in this scenario.
- **D**: While the House of Representatives does choose the president, the wording "majority of votes in the House" is misleading, as it implies a simple majority of representatives rather than a majority of state delegations.
- **E**: This is correct because "Congress" broadly encompasses the House of Representatives, which is responsible for selecting the president in the absence of an electoral majority.

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: Whomever is selected by the United States Congress.

Answer: E
