Question:

Tara can develop 2 rolls of film in about 18 minutes. At this rate, how long will it take her to develop 8 rolls of film?

Options:

B: 1 hour 20 minutes
C: 1 hour
D: 1 hour 12 minutes
E: 1 hour 30 minutes
F: 2 hours 24 minutes

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how long it will take Tara to develop 8 rolls of film. The question says she can develop 2 rolls in about 18 minutes. Hmm, I think I need to find out her rate per roll and then multiply that by 8.

Wait, no, maybe it's easier to find the time per roll first. If 2 rolls take 18 minutes, then one roll would take 18 divided by 2, right? So 18/2 is 9. So each roll takes 9 minutes. Then for 8 rolls, I just multiply 9 by 8. 

Let me calculate 9 times 8. 9*8 is 72 minutes. Now, I need to convert 72 minutes into hours and minutes because the answer options are in hours and minutes. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 goes into 72 once, leaving 12 minutes remaining. So that's 1 hour and 12 minutes. Let me check the options again. Option D is 1 hour 12 minutes. That should be the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. I broke it down step by step, found the time per roll, multiplied by 8, and converted the total minutes into hours and minutes. Yeah, that makes sense.

To determine how long it will take Tara to develop 8 rolls of film, we start by finding her development rate. Tara can develop 2 rolls in 18 minutes, so the time per roll is:

\[
\frac{18 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ rolls}} = 9 \text{ minutes per roll}
\]

For 8 rolls, the total time required is:

\[
8 \text{ rolls} \times 9 \text{ minutes per roll} = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

Converting 72 minutes into hours and minutes:

\[
72 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: 1 hour 12 minutes

Answer: D
