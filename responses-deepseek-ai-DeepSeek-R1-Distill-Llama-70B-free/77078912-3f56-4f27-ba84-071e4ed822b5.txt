Okay, so I've got this tax question here about partnerships, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, Aston and Becker are equal partners in AB Partnership. That probably means they each own 50% of the partnership. The question is about Aston's share of the ordinary income. 

The partnership has an ordinary income of $20,000 and a long-term capital gain of $12,000. Wait, but the question is specifically about the ordinary income, so maybe the capital gains part isn't directly relevant here, unless it affects basis or distributions somehow. Hmm.

Aston's basis in AB was $40,000, and he received distributions of $5,000 during the year. I remember that a partner's basis is important for determining the tax treatment of distributions. If the distribution is more than the basis, it could lead to gain. But wait, the question is about his share of income, not the distribution tax effects. So maybe the distribution part is a red herring here, but I'm not sure yet.

Partnerships allocate their income based on the partnership agreement. Since they're equal partners, I think it's safe to assume that each gets 50% of each item of income. So the ordinary income is $20,000, so each partner's share would be $10,000. That seems straightforward. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, sometimes in partnerships, the allocation might not be entirely equal for different types of income. Like, maybe salaries or interest are allocated differently. But the question says it's their equal partnership, so I think they split everything equally, including ordinary income and capital gains.

So, the ordinary income is $20,000. Each partner's share would be half of that, so $10,000 each. So Aston's share is $10,000. Looking at the options, D is $10,000. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, could the distribution affect this? I don't think so. The distribution is a separate issue. The partner's share of income is based on their ownership percentage, regardless of how much they take out as distributions. So even if he took $5,000, his share of the $20,000 is still $10,000.

So yeah, the answer should be D.

Aston and Becker are equal partners in AB Partnership, meaning they each own 50% of the partnership. The partnership's ordinary income for the tax year is $20,000, and since the partners are equal, each partner's share of the ordinary income is 50% of $20,000, which equals $10,000. The long-term capital gain of $12,000 and Aston's distribution of $5,000 are not relevant to calculating his share of the ordinary income, as distributions and capital gains are treated separately from the allocation of ordinary income. Therefore, Aston's share of AB's ordinary income is $10,000.

D: $10,000

Answer: D
