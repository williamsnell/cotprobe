Okay, so I've got this question about the heat of vaporization for H2O at 373 K. Hmm, I remember that heat of vaporization is the energy required to turn liquid water into vapor. But wait, how does that tie into the given reactions?

Alright, looking at the problem, there are two reactions provided. The first one is H2(g) plus half O2(g) forming H2O(g), and the delta H is -57.98 kcal per mole. The second reaction is the same reactants forming liquid H2O, with a delta H of -67.68 kcal per mole.

Wait, so the first reaction is formation of water vapor, and the second is formation of liquid water. I think the heat of formation for liquid water is more negative than that of vapor because liquids have lower energy than gases. So that makes sense.

Now, the question is about the heat of vaporization. Oh right, the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) is the energy change when liquid turns into gas. So that's going from H2O(l) to H2O(g). 

How do I relate the given data to find this? Let me think about the formation reactions. The formation of vapor is endothermic? No wait, because the given delta H is negative. Wait, when a substance is formed from its elements, a negative delta H means it's exothermic.

So the formation of H2O(g) releases 57.98 kcal per mole, and formation of H2O(l) releases 67.68 kcal per mole. So which one is more stable? The liquid must be more stable because more energy is released when it forms.

So to find the heat of vaporization, which is the energy required to go from liquid to gas, I can think of it as the reverse of the condensation process. Or maybe subtracting the formation enthalpies.

Wait, let's consider the formation reactions again. The first reaction is H2 + ½ O2 → H2O(g), ΔH = -57.98 kcal/mol. The second is the same, but forms H2O(l), ΔH = -67.68 kcal/mol.

If I subtract the second reaction from the first, what happens? Let me write it out.

Reaction 1: H2O(g) is formed, ΔH1 = -57.98 kcal/mol.

Reaction 2: H2O(l) is formed, ΔH2 = -67.68 kcal/mol.

If I subtract reaction 2 from reaction 1, I get:

H2O(g) - H2O(l) → 0, with ΔH = ΔH1 - ΔH2.

Wait, that would be (-57.98) - (-67.68) = 9.7 kcal. So that's +9.7 kcal.

Wait, but what's the equation here? Let's see: If I reverse reaction 2, I get H2O(l) → H2(g) + ½ O2(g), with ΔH = +67.68 kcal/mol. Then, adding reaction 1, which is H2 + ½ O2 → H2O(g), ΔH = -57.98. So when I add them, the H2 and O2 cancel out.

So reaction 2 reversed: H2O(l) → H2 + ½ O2, ΔH = +67.68.

Reaction 1: H2 + ½ O2 → H2O(g), ΔH = -57.98.

Adding them: H2O(l) → H2O(g), ΔH = 67.68 -57.98 = 9.7 kcal. So that's the heat of vaporization. Or wait, no. Because heat of vaporization is the energy required to vaporize, which is endothermic, so positive.

Wait, 9.7 kcal is positive, so that's the enthalpy change when liquid turns to gas. But wait, the question asks for the heat of vaporization, which is this value.

But wait, the options are given in kJ. Oh right, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

So 9.7 kcal * 4.184 ≈ let's see: 10 kcal is 41.84 kJ. 0.3 kcal is about 1.255 kJ. So 9.7 is 40.52 kJ approximately.

Wait, let me do exact calculation. 9.7 kcal * 4.184 kJ/kcal = 9.7 *4.184.

9 *4.184 is 37.656. 0.7 *4.184 is 2.9288. Sum is approx 40.5848 kJ. So approximately 40.58 kJ.

Now looking at the options:

Option F is 40.59 kJ, which is very close. So that's the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check my approach. Another way: The heat of vaporization is the enthalpy of H2O(g) minus that of H2O(l). Since the formation of H2O(g) is -57.98 and H2O(l) is -67.68, then the vaporization is H2O(l) → H2O(g), which is ΔH = [ΔHf of gas] - [ΔHf of liquid].

So that's (-57.98) - (-67.68) = 9.7 kcal. So same result.

So converting 9.7 kcal to kJ, gives about 40.59 kJ. So the correct option is F.

To predict the heat of vaporization for H₂O at 373 K, we analyze the given reactions:

1. **Formation of H₂O(g):**  
   \[ \text{H}_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}(g), \Delta H^\circ = -57.98 \, \text{kcal/mol} \]

2. **Formation of H₂O(l):**  
   \[ \text{H}_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}(l), \Delta H^\circ = -67.68 \, \text{kcal/mol} \]

The heat of vaporization (\(\Delta H_{\text{vap}}\)) is the energy required to convert liquid water (\(\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\)) into water vapor (\(\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)\)). This can be calculated as the difference between the enthalpy of formation of water vapor and the enthalpy of formation of liquid water:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \Delta H_f(\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)) - \Delta H_f(\text{H}_2\text{O}(l))
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = -57.98 \, \text{kcal/mol} - (-67.68 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = 9.7 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

To convert this value to kilojoules, we use the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ}\):

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 9.7 \, \text{kcal/mol} \times 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx 40.59 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **40.59 kJ**, which corresponds to **Option F**.
