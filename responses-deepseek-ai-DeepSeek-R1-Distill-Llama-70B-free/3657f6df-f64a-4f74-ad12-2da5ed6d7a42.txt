Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The far-reaching, the boundless future will be the era of American greatness. In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High—the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere—its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood—of 'peace and good will amongst men.'"
John L. O'Sullivan, "The Great Nation of Futurity," 1839

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about westward migration in the United States during the 1840s. The question is based on a passage from John L. O'Sullivan's "The Great Nation of Futurity," which talks about the idea of Manifest Destiny. I remember that Manifest Destiny was the belief that the U.S. was destined to expand across the continent.

The question is asking which change in westward migration is most likely to have occurred in the 1840s. The options are A through J. I need to think about what happened during that decade regarding migration patterns.

First, I'll try to recall the major events in the 1840s related to westward expansion. I know that the Oregon Trail was popular in the 1840s, with many settlers heading to the Oregon Territory. This was partly because of the idea of Manifest Destiny and the desire for fertile land. The Oregon Territory was a contested area between the U.S. and Britain, but I think the U.S. gained more control through the Oregon Treaty in 1846, which might have encouraged more settlers to go there.

Then there's the California part. I remember that the Mexican-American War ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which gave a lot of land, including present-day California, to the U.S. But before that, in 1848, there was the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in California, which led to the California Gold Rush starting in 1849. Wait, but the Gold Rush started in 1849, so the big increase in migration to California would have been in the late 1840s and especially the early 1850s.

So in the 1840s, before the Gold Rush, how were the migration patterns? I think people were moving to Oregon in larger numbers, maybe. Also, the Mormons were moving to Utah around this time, but that's a bit later perhaps.

Looking at the options:

Option A says more to Oregon, less to California. That makes sense because the Gold Rush hadn't started yet, so California might not have been a big draw. But wait, was there any significant migration to California before the Gold Rush? I think some people went for the land, but not in huge numbers. So maybe the number going to California was lower than Oregon.

Option C says the number to Oregon decreased while California increased. That doesn't fit because the Gold Rush was after the 1840s. Unless there was a significant increase in 1849, but the question is about the 1840s, so maybe 1849 is the start, but the main surge was in the 1850s.

Option B says the first great wave ended, but I don't think that's right because the 1840s were actually a time when migration was increasing, especially with the Oregon Trail.

Option D talks about Native Americans moving eastward. I don't think that's accurate; Native Americans were often forced westward, not east, during this period.

Option E says both remained the same, which doesn't seem right because I think Oregon was getting more settlers.

Option F says migration remained steady, but I think there was an increase, especially to Oregon.

Option G says pioneers began settling west of the Mississippi for the first time. That can't be right because the Louisiana Purchase was in 1803, and there were settlers moving west before the 1840s, like into Missouri, Arkansas, etc.

Option H says the Gold Rush caused a decrease, but the Gold Rush started in 1849, so maybe it's a bit late, but the option says "caused a decrease," which doesn't make sense because it caused an increase.

Option I says pioneers settled in the East due to hardships. No, the trend was moving west, so this is unlikely.

Option J talks about free blacks moving west. I don't recall that being a major trend in the 1840s. Maybe some, but not large numbers.

So putting it together, in the 1840s, before the Gold Rush, more people were going to Oregon than California. So the number to Oregon increased, and California's numbers were lower. So option A says the number to Oregon increased while California decreased. That makes sense because before 1848-49, California wasn't the main draw yet.

Wait, but was there an increase in both or just one? I think the Oregon Trail saw a peak in the mid-1840s, with thousands going each year. So perhaps the number to Oregon was increasing, while California's was not yet booming. So the correct change would be that more went to Oregon, and fewer to California, making option A correct.

But wait, option C is the opposite. Let me think again. Before the Gold Rush, California's settlers were fewer. So if in the 1840s, more people went to Oregon, and the number going to California stayed low, then option A is correct. But if the number going to California was increasing, but less than Oregon, then maybe that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the number going to California was increasing, but not as much as Oregon. But the options are about whether each increased or decreased.

Wait, the question is about what change occurred in the 1840s. So in the early 1840s, maybe fewer people went to California, but by the end of the decade, after 1848, more started going. So during the 1840s as a whole, the number to California may have increased, but not as much as Oregon. Or perhaps the number to Oregon increased, and California's remained steady or lower.

Alternatively, maybe the number to California was negligible until 1849, so during the 1840s, more went to Oregon, while California's numbers were low.

So option C says Oregon decreased, California increased. That doesn't fit unless there was a shift in the later part of the decade. But if the Gold Rush started in 1849, then in the 1840s, the number to California was still low.

Wait, but the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, which made a lot of land, including California, part of the U.S. Maybe that led to an increase in migration to California in the late 1840s, even before the Gold Rush.

So perhaps in the 1840s, the number going to Oregon was high, and towards the end, California started to get more settlers. So if the question is about the 1840s as a whole, maybe the number to California increased, but Oregon's was higher.

Wait, but the options are about the change in that decade. So if in the 1840s, more people started going to California, but even more to Oregon, then perhaps option A isn't correct. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the number to Oregon increased, and the number to California also increased, but not as much. So the correct option would be A: Oregon increased, California decreased. No, that can't be because California's numbers probably started to rise towards the end of the 1840s, even before the Gold Rush.

Wait, maybe I should think about the context of the question. The passage is from 1839, talking about the future greatness. So in the 1840s, the Oregon Trail was in full swing, with a significant increase in settlers. Meanwhile, California was part of Mexico until 1848, so perhaps fewer settlers went there before the U.S. took it over. After 1848, more Americans might have started moving there, but the big influx was in 1849 with the Gold Rush.

So during the 1840s, the number going to Oregon increased, while the number to California was lower but perhaps started to rise towards the end of the decade. So if the question is about the 1840s, the number to Oregon was increasing, while California's was still low but maybe starting to increase. So which option fits that?

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Oregon increased, California decreased. That would mean that in the 1840s, fewer people went to California than before, which may not be accurate because after 1848, more might have gone.

Option C: Oregon decreased, California increased. That doesn't fit because Oregon's numbers were increasing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is likely option C, but I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no. Let's think about the start and end of the 1840s. At the beginning, say 1840-1843, the Oregon Trail was just becoming popular, and perhaps not many went to California. By 1846-1848, after the Oregon Treaty and the Mexican-American War, maybe more started going to both. But the big California increase was post-1848, especially 1849.

So in the 1840s, the number to Oregon was increasing, while the number to California was also increasing but from a lower base. So the change would be that both increased, but perhaps Oregon more so. But none of the options directly say that.

Wait, the question is about which change is most likely. So in the 1840s, the Oregon migration was on the rise, and California's was just starting to pick up, but not yet the mass migration of the Gold Rush. So perhaps the number going to Oregon increased, while the number going to California also increased but not as much. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Oregon decreased, California increased. That doesn't fit because Oregon's numbers were increasing.

Option A says Oregon increased, California decreased. That doesn't fit because California's might have started to increase towards the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about when the California migration started. Maybe before the Gold Rush, there was a steady but smaller number going to California. So in the 1840s, the number to Oregon was increasing, and the number to California was also increasing, but perhaps at a slower rate. So neither A nor C would fit exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the number to California was negligible until 1849, so in the 1840s, more went to Oregon, and California's numbers were low. So the correct option would be A: Oregon increased, California decreased. But that doesn't make sense because California's numbers were probably increasing, just not as much.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because in the early 1840s, more went to Oregon, and by the late 1840s, more started going to California. So during the 1840s, the number to Oregon may have started high and then decreased as California became more attractive, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the number to Oregon peaked in the mid-1840s and then decreased as people went to California after 1848. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I think the correct answer is C: the number to Oregon decreased while California greatly increased. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think about the historical data.

I remember that the Oregon Trail saw a significant increase in the 1840s, with the peak years being around 1843-1860, but especially the 1850s. Wait, no, the peak was in the 1850s for Oregon. So in the 1840s, the numbers were increasing, but perhaps not as much as in the 1850s.

Wait, perhaps the number to Oregon increased throughout the 1840s, reaching a peak in the late 1840s. Meanwhile, the number to California started to increase after 1848, but the big boom was in 1849.

So in the 1840s as a whole, the number to Oregon was increasing, and the number to California was starting to increase but not yet booming. So the correct change would be that Oregon's numbers increased, while California's started to rise but perhaps weren't as high yet.

Looking back at the options, none of them perfectly capture that. Option A says Oregon increased, California decreased, which might not be accurate if California's numbers were starting to rise.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that during the 1840s, especially after 1846, the Oregon migration was high, and California's migration started to pick up, particularly after the Mexican-American War. So the number going to Oregon was increasing, and the number going to California was also increasing, but the question is asking which change occurred.

Wait, the question is which change is most likely to have occurred in the 1840s. So perhaps the correct answer is C: Oregon decreased, California increased. But I don't think that's accurate because Oregon's numbers were increasing.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A: Oregon increased, California decreased. But that doesn't make sense because after 1848, more people went to California.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C because towards the end of the 1840s, more people started going to California, so the number to Oregon decreased compared to earlier in the decade. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it another way. The passage talks about the "floor shall be a hemisphere," implying expansion across the continent. So in the 1840s, more people were moving west, but where?

I think the correct answer is C: the number to Oregon decreased while California greatly increased. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the number to both increased, but the options don't have that.

Wait, another approach: the California Gold Rush started in 1849, so in the 1840s, before that, the number going to California wasn't that high. So during the 1840s, more people went to Oregon, and fewer to California. So the number to Oregon increased, and California's remained low. So option A would be correct.

But wait, the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, making California part of the U.S., which might have caused an increase in migration there even before the Gold Rush. So perhaps in the late 1840s, more people started going to California, leading to an increase there, while Oregon's numbers were also increasing. But the question is about the 1840s as a whole.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the decades. The Oregon Trail's peak was in the 1850s, but the 1840s saw a significant increase as well. So in the 1840s, the number to Oregon was growing, while California's was not yet booming. So the correct answer would be A: Oregon increased, California decreased.

But wait, no, because in the 1840s, especially after 1848, more people started moving to California, so their numbers would have increased, not decreased. So that would make option A incorrect.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to remember specific events. The Oregon Treaty was in 1846, which resolved the border dispute with Britain, making the Oregon Territory officially part of the U.S. This likely encouraged more settlers to go there in the late 1840s. So during the 1840s, the number to Oregon increased.

Meanwhile, California was part of Mexico until 1848. After the Mexican-American War, it became U.S. territory, which might have made it more attractive. But the Gold Rush was in 1849, so in the 1840s, the number going to California started to rise, but not as much as after 1849.

So during the 1840s, both Oregon and California saw increases in migration, but Oregon's was more significant until the Gold Rush. So the options don't perfectly fit, but the closest would be option C, where Oregon decreased and California increased. But that doesn't fit because Oregon's numbers were increasing.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The correct answer is C: the number to Oregon decreased while California increased. Because as the 1840s progressed, more people started going to California, especially after 1848, while the number to Oregon might have started to slow down as people opted for California. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the number to Oregon continued to increase, and the number to California started to increase as well. So the correct option might be that both increased, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option E says both remained the same. That can't be right because migration was increasing.

Hmm. I think I've overcomplicated this. The most likely answer is C: the number to Oregon decreased while California greatly increased. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number to Oregon increased, and the number to California also increased, but the question is about the change in direction.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C because the focus shifted to California after the Mexican-American War, so more people went there, leading to a decrease in Oregon migration. But that doesn't fit with what I know about the numbers.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on the fact that the Gold Rush started in 1849, the big increase in California migration happened after the 1840s. So during the 1840s, the number to Oregon was increasing, while California's was still low. So the correct answer is A: Oregon increased, California decreased.

Wait, but that would mean that in the 1840s, fewer people went to California than before, which doesn't make sense because after 1848, more would have gone. So perhaps the number to California started to increase, making option C incorrect.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should go with option C, as the number to Oregon decreased and California increased in the 1840s, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I think I'm more confident that option C is correct because after 1848, California started to attract more settlers, while Oregon's numbers might have stabilized or decreased as people chose California instead.

Wait, no, I think the number to Oregon continued to increase throughout the 1840s. So perhaps the correct answer is A: Oregon increased, California decreased. But I don't think that's accurate because California's numbers were starting to rise.

I think I'm going to have to go with option C: the number to Oregon decreased while California greatly increased. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the Mexican-American War led to an increase in California migration, making option C correct.

The question asks about changes in westward migration during the 1840s. The key events and trends of the decade include the Oregon Trail becoming increasingly popular, with significant numbers of settlers heading to the Oregon Territory, especially after the Oregon Treaty of 1846. On the other hand, California was part of Mexico until the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, after which it became U.S. territory. While the California Gold Rush began in 1849, the 1840s saw some migration to California, particularly after 1848, though the large-scale influx occurred in the 1850s.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Suggests the number of pioneers to Oregon increased while California decreased. This is inconsistent because California's migration likely started to rise after 1848, even if not yet reaching Gold Rush levels.
- **Option B**: Claims the first great wave
