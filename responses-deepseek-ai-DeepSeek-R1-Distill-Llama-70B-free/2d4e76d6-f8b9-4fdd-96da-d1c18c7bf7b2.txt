Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about glycine solutions and pH after adding HCl or NaOH. Hmm, I remember glycine is an amino acid, right? And it has an isoelectric point, pI. At the pI, the molecule is neutral, meaning it has no net charge. 

The problem says we start with 1.0 liter of a 1.0 M glycine solution at its isoelectric pH. Then, 0.3 moles of HCl are added, and we need to find the new pH. Then, the same but with 0.3 moles of NaOH. 

Wait, glycine has two pKa values, right? Because it's an amino acid with a carboxyl group and an amino group. So, the pKa's are around 2.3 for the carboxyl and 9.6 for the amino group. Oh wait, I might have the exact numbers a bit off. So the pI is the average of those two, so (2.3 + 9.6)/2 = about 5.95. So the solution is initially at pH 5.95.

But wait, the question says the initial solution is at the isoelectric pH. So the solution is pH 5.95, and initially, glycine is in its zwitterionic form, with no net charge.

So when we add HCl, which is a strong acid, it will donate H+ ions. Adding HCl to a solution of glycine at pI will protonate the amino group, right? Because in solution, glycine exists as +H3N-CH2-COO- at the pI. Adding H+ will cause the carboxyl group to pick up more protons.

Wait, no. Let me think again. At the pI, both groups are ionized. The carboxyl group is deprotonated (COO-) and the amino group is protonated (NH3+). So glycine is +NH3CH2COO^-.

When you add a strong acid like HCl, the H+ will react with the conjugate base forms in the solution. The H+ will protonate the carboxyl group. Because the carboxyl group is a weak acid, so in solution, some is COO^- and some is COOH. But wait, at the pI, the predominant form is the zwitterion, so the carboxyl is deprotonated and the amino is protonated.

So when you add H+, the COO^- will pick up H+ to become COOH. So the glycine will shift to a more protonated form. Since we started at the pI, adding H+ will take us below the pI. So the solution becomes more acidic.

Wait, the initial solution is 1.0 M glycine, 1.0 liter. So that's 1.0 mole of glycine. Adding 0.3 moles of HCl adds 0.3 moles of H+. So the total moles of H+ added is 0.3.

But wait, glycine is a diprotic acid. So each glycine can react with H+ in two places. But wait, initially at pI, the NH3+ can't accept more H+ because it's already protonated. The COO^- can accept H+.

So when we add H+, the COO^- will react: COO^- + H+ → COOH.

Each mole of HCl will convert a mole of COO^- glycine to COOH glycine. So how much glycine is there? 1.0 mole. So adding 0.3 moles HCl will convert 0.3 moles of glycine from the zwitterion form (COO^-) to the fully protonated form (COOH). 

Wait, but the problem is that after adding HCl, what is the pH? So initially, all glycine is in the zwitterionic form. Adding HCl adds H+, so the solution becomes more acidic. Glycine will act as a buffer here because it has buffering capacity around its pKa's.

Wait, but let me think about the species present. When you add HCl, which is a strong acid, it will protonate the glycine. Glycine has two dissociable protons: the carboxyl group (pKa ~2.3) and the amino group (pKa ~9.6). 

At the pI, the solution is at pH ~5.95. When you add a strong acid, the pH will drop. The H+ ions will first react with the basic groups. Since the amino group is already protonated (NH3+), adding H+ can't really react with that. The H+ will instead react with the carboxyl group. The COO^- will pick up H+ to form COOH.

So initially, there are 1.0 moles of glycine in the zwitterionic form (so 1.0 mole of COO^- and 1.0 mole of NH3+ groups). Adding 0.3 moles of HCl adds 0.3 moles of H+. The H+ will react with the COO^-:

COO^- + H+ → COOH.

After reaction, the moles of COO^- will decrease by 0.3, and COOH will increase by 0.3. So the glycine will have:

COO^-: 1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7 moles.

COOH: 0.3 moles.

Wait, but wait. Glycine has two protons. So when you add H+ to the solution, the H+ will react with the most available basic group. Since the solution is at pH pI, the dominant species is the zwitterion. So the amino group is already protonated, so the H+ must go to the carboxyl group.

So the glycine molecules will convert from the zwitterion (NH3+CH2COO^-) to the fully protonated form (NH3+CH2COOH). 

But wait, in this case, does the amino group remain protonated? Because the solution is becoming more acidic, so the amino group (which has a pKa around 9.6) is definitely protonated.

So after adding HCl, the solution will have a mixture of glycine in the form where the carboxyl group is either COO^- or COOH. But since we added H+, we have more COOH.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be useful here. For the carboxyl group, pKa is around 2.3. 

The H-H equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is COO^- and HA is COOH.

After adding HCl:

moles of A- (COO^-) = 1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7 moles.

moles of HA (COOH) = 0.3 moles.

The total volume is 1.0 L, so concentrations are same as moles.

So, pH = 2.3 + log(0.7 / 0.3) = 2.3 + log(7/3) ≈ 2.3 + 0.778 = 3.078.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because the initial pH was pI, which is around 5.95. Adding a strong acid would bring the pH down, but the buffer action of the carboxyl group would determine where.

Hmm, but wait another thing. Since the solution is at the pI, does that mean that the buffering is from both groups? Or only the carboxyl group is relevant here because the amino group is already protonated? 

Also, the amount of HCl added is 0.3 moles. The solution has 1.0 mole of glycine. So 0.3 moles is less than 1.0, so not all the glycine will be converted. So the H-H approach should apply.

So the pH would be around 3.08, but let's check the options. Looking at the options, option D is 3.2 as the first answer, option E is 3.5, option F is 2.71, etc.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

log(0.7/0.3) = log(7/3) ≈ 0.7782.

So pH is 2.3 + 0.7782 ≈ 3.078. So about 3.08. Looking at the options, option D starts with 3.2, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but wait maybe I missed something.

Wait, what if the initial solution's buffering considers both pKa's? Wait, the amino group has a pKa around 9.6, so in solution at pH around 5.95, the amino group is mostly protonated. When you add HCl, the pH drops, but the amino group stays protonated because the solution is now even more acidic. So the buffer is only the carboxyl group.

So yes, using the H-H equation with the carboxyl's pKa should be correct. So pH is about 3.08.

Looking at the options, the closest is D: 3.2 and 8.9. Hmm, but 3.08 is closer to 3.1. Option E starts with 3.5. So none of the options exactly match, but perhaps D is the intended choice.

Wait, perhaps the pKa values are slightly different than what I remember. Let me think. Glycine's pKa1 is around 2.3 (carboxyl) and pKa2 around 9.6 (amino). So the pI is (2.3 + 9.6)/2 = 5.95, correct.

So the H-H equation should be correct. So pH ~3.08 when adding HCl.

Now, the second part: adding 0.3 moles of NaOH instead. NaOH is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the solution. 

At pI, glycine is in the zwitterion form. Adding OH- will take protons from the solution. Where can it take them from?

The OH- will deprotonate the amino group first, perhaps? Because the amino group is protonated (NH3+), and has a higher pKa (9.6). But wait, in solution, the OH- will abstract H+ from the most acidic proton available.

Wait, the solution is at pH 5.95. The protons available are from the carboxyl group (pKa 2.3) and the amino group (pKa 9.6). Since the solution is at pH 5.95, which is higher than the carboxyl pKa, the carboxyl group is mostly deprotonated (COO^-). The amino group is mostly protonated (NH3+).

When you add OH-, it will take H+ from wherever it can. So the OH- will deprotonate the NH3+ group, because that's the only available H+ (since the carboxyl is already deprotonated). 

Wait, wait. Alternatively, the OH- can abstract H+ from water, but in the presence of a buffer, it would react with the buffer components.

So, when NaOH is added, it will deprotonate the amino group. So each mole of OH- will convert NH3+ glycine to NH2 glycine.

Wait, let me think about this. Glycine at pI is present as +NH3CH2COO^-. When you add OH-, the OH- will abstract a proton from the NH3+ group, turning it into NH2, and forming water.

So the reaction would be: +NH3CH2COO^- + OH- → NH2CH2COO^- + H2O.

But wait, that's a base, so the glycine loses a proton from the amino group. So the species becomes NH2CH2COO^-.

So the amount of OH- added is 0.3 moles. So 0.3 moles of NaOH will deprotonate 0.3 moles of the amino groups.

The initial glycine is 1.0 mole. So after adding NaOH, 0.3 moles will have their amino groups deprotonated.

So the species present are:

NH3+CH2COO^- : 1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7 moles.

NH2CH2COO^- : 0.3 moles.

Wait, but the pKa for the amino group is around 9.6. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be applied here.

The pH will be determined by the amino group's pKa. So using H-H equation for the amino group:

pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

Here, the acid is the protonated amino group (NH3+), and the base is the deprotonated form (NH2).

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The amino group's pKa is for the reaction: NH3+ → NH2 + H+. So the acid form is NH3+, and the base is NH2.

So after adding NaOH:

moles of NH3+ (acid) = 0.7.

moles of NH2 (base) = 0.3.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.3/0.7.

So pH = 9.6 + log(0.3/0.7) = 9.6 + log(3/7) ≈ 9.6 + (-0.778) ≈ 8.822.

So pH is about 8.82. Looking at the options, option D has 8.9 as the second pH, which is close. Option E has 9.2, which is higher.

Hmm, but wait: when adding NaOH, are we considering the correct pKa? Because the solution after adding NaOH may have a different buffering system. Also, perhaps I should think about the solution's pH relative to the pKa2.

Wait, let me recalculate the exact value:

log(0.3/0.7) = log(3/7) ≈ log(0.4286) ≈ -0.368, because 10^(-0.368)= ~0.428.

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. Because 3/7 is approximately 0.4286. The log of 0.4286 is log(4.286 x10^-1) = -0.368. So pH=9.6 + (-0.368) = 9.232.

Wait, so earlier calculation was wrong. Because I thought log(3/7) is -0.778, which is incorrect. Oh wait wait no: wait, 3/7 is 0.4286.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute log(3/7) accurately.

Log(3)=0.4771, log(7)=0.8451. So log(3/7)= 0.4771 - 0.8451 = -0.368. So yes, pH=9.6 -0.368=9.232.

Wait, that's a big difference. So the pH after adding NaOH is approximately 9.23.

But wait, my initial calculation was wrong because I thought 0.7/0.3 was 7/3, but in the case of adding NaOH, the ratio is 0.3/0.7. So that's 3/7, which is about 0.4286, log is -0.368.

So pH=9.6 + log(3/7)=9.6 -0.368=9.232.

Hmm, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option F is 2.71 and 9.23. So first pH is 2.71, second is 9.23.

But when adding HCl, our calculation was pH ~3.08.

Hmm, so the options don't have 3.08 and 9.23. The only option with 9.23 is option F, but the first part is 2.71, which is lower than our HCl case.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the HCl calculation. Let me recheck.

When adding HCl, which is a strong acid. The H+ will react with COO^- to form COOH.

The initial glycine is 1.0 mole as zwitterion.

Add 0.3 moles of HCl → 0.3 H+.

These H+ will react with COO^- → COOH.

So moles after reaction:

COO^-: 1.0 -0.3 =0.7.

COOH: 0.3.

So the ratio is [COO^-]/[COOH] = 0.7/0.3=7/3≈2.333.

pH=pKa1 + log(7/3)=2.3 + 0.778=3.078.

So pH≈3.08.

But in the options, the closest first pH is 3.08, which is not present. Let's check the options again.

Option F: first pH 2.71, which is lower than our calculation.

Option D: first pH 3.2, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the pKa values. Some sources might have glycine's pKa1 as 2.34, pKa2 as 9.60.

So pKa1=2.34.

Then, pH=2.34 + log(7/3)= 2.34 +0.778≈3.118.

Still, around 3.12.

So the options don't have exactly 3.12. So perhaps the intended answer is D: 3.2 and 8.9, but our calculation for NaOH addition gives pH≈9.23, which is in option F as the second part.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps when adding NaOH, the solution's pH is governed by the amino group's pKa, but the actual pH after adding 0.3 moles would be higher than 9?

Wait, another approach: The amino group has a pKa of 9.6. When you add 0.3 moles of NaOH to 1.0 mole of glycine at pI, you're neutralizing some of the NH3+ groups.

So the moles of NH3+ after addition:1.0 -0.3=0.7.

Moles of NH2:0.3.

So the ratio is [NH2]/[NH3+] = 0.3/0.7=3/7.

So pH = pKa2 + log(3/7)=9.6 + log(0.4286)=9.6 -0.368=9.232.

So the pH is approximately 9.
