Okay, so I've got this question about permutations and group theory. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1: S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3. Hmm, S_n refers to the symmetric group on n elements, right? I remember that a group is Abelian if every pair of elements commutes, meaning ab = ba for all a and b in the group. 

So, for S_n, which consists of all permutations of n symbols, do the permutations commute? I think for n=1 and n=2, S_n is Abelian. Because S_1 is trivial (only the identity), and S_2 has just two elements: the identity and a single transposition. Those two elements should commute because swapping twice is the same as doing nothing. 

But starting from n=3, things change. For example, take two permutations in S_3, say a 3-cycle and a transposition. Wait, actually, let me think of specific permutations. Let's take a = (1 2 3) and b = (1 2). Now, compute ab and ba. 

ab would be (1 2 3) followed by (1 2). Let's see: Applying b first, which swaps 1 and 2. Then a, which cycles 1→2, 2→3, 3→1. So ab would be (1 3) because when you compose these, you get a permutation where 1 goes to 2 (from b), then 2 goes to 3 (from a), so overall 1→3. Similarly, 3 goes to 1 (from a), and then 1 goes to 2 (from b), so 3→2. And 2 goes to 1 (from b), then a doesn't affect it since a only cycles 1,2,3. So 2→1. So ab is (1 3 2) maybe? Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to take two transpositions. Let’s pick a = (1 2) and b = (2 3). Then ab is (1 2)(2 3) which is (1 2 3), a 3-cycle. And ba is (2 3)(1 2) which is (1 3 2), another 3-cycle. So ab and ba are different, meaning that ab ≠ ba. So S_3 is non-Abelian. 

Similarly, for higher n, S_n remains non-Abelian because you can always find such permutations that don't commute. So Statement 1 is true for n >=3. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then the order of ab is the least common multiple of m and n, |ab| = lcm(m, n). Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. I remember that when two cycles are disjoint, the order of their product is the lcm of their lengths. But if they're not disjoint, it's not necessarily the case.

So the statement doesn't specify whether the cycles are disjoint. So if a and b are disjoint m and n cycles, then yes, |ab|=lcm(m,n). But if they share some elements, then the order could be different. For example, let’s take a = (1 2 3) which is a 3-cycle, and b = (3 4 5), a 3-cycle as well, but they are disjoint. Then ab would be a permutation that's a product of two disjoint 3-cycles, so the order is lcm(3,3)=3. But if a and b are not disjoint, say a=(1 2 3) and b=(2 3 4), then ab might have a different order. Let me compute ab. 

Wait, maybe a better example: Let a=(1 2 3) and b=(1 3 2), which is the inverse of a. Then ab would be (1 2 3)(1 3 2) which is (1)(2), because applying b first sends 1→3, then a sends 3→1, so overall 1→1. Similarly, 2→1 via a, but wait no, let me actually compute the composition correctly. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take specific small cycles. Let’s take a = (1 2) (a 2-cycle) and b = (2 3) (another 2-cycle). Then ab is (1 2)(2 3) = (1 2 3), which is a 3-cycle, so |ab|=3. The lcm(2,2) is 2, but the order is 3, which is not equal to 2. So in this case, the order isn't the lcm. Therefore, Statement 2 is False because it depends on whether the cycles are disjoint. 

So Statement 2 is False. 

Now, looking back at the options, let's see which one matches. 

Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. So the correct option should have the first part True and the second False. 

Looking at the options:

Option I: True, False. 

Wait, let me check all options again. 

Option A: Depends on n, True. No, because Statement 1 is definitely True for all n >=3.

Option B: Both False. No.

Option C: Both True. No.

Option D: Depends on m and n, False. No, because Statement 1 is not about m and n.

Option E: False, True. No.

Option F: False, Depends. No.

Option G: Depends n, False. No, because Statement 1 is True.

Option H: Depends m and n, True. No.

Option I: True, False. Yes, this matches.

Option J: True, Depends. No, because Statement 2 is False, not depends.

So the correct answer should be I.

Statement 1: \( S_n \) is non-Abelian for all \( n \geq 3 \).  
This is true because \( S_n \), the symmetric group on \( n \) elements, is Abelian only for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \). For \( n \geq 3 \), there exist permutations that do not commute. For example, in \( S_3 \), the permutations \( (1 2 3) \) and \( (1 2) \) do not commute, as shown by explicit computation. Thus, \( S_n \) is non-Abelian for \( n \geq 3 \).

Statement 2: If \( a \) is an \( m \)-cycle and \( b \) is an \( n \)-cycle, then \( |ab| = \text{lcm}(m, n) \).  
This is false because the order of the product \( ab \) depends on whether the cycles \( a \) and \( b \) are disjoint. If \( a \) and \( b \) are disjoint, then \( |ab| = \text{lcm}(m, n) \). However, if they are not disjoint, the order of \( ab \) can differ. For example, if \( a = (1 2) \) and \( b = (2 3) \), then \( ab = (1 2 3) \), which has order 3, not \( \text{lcm}(2, 2) = 2 \). Thus, the statement is false.

Given this analysis, the correct option is **I: True, False**.
