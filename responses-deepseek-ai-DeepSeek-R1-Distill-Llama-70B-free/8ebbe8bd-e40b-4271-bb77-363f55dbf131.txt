Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about bond order in He2 and He2+. Hmm, bond order... I remember that's related to molecular orbital theory. Let me think about how that works.

Bond order is calculated as (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2. Right, so I need to figure out the molecular orbitals for He2 and He2+.

Helium has an atomic number of 2, so each He atom has two electrons. So for He2, the total electrons would be 4. Now, when they form a diatomic molecule, the molecular orbitals fill up in a specific order.

The molecular orbital filling order goes like this: σ2s, σ*2s, σ2pz, π2px and π2py, and their antibonding counterparts. Wait, or is it that the σ2p comes after the π2p? No, wait, I think the order is that the σ2p is higher in energy than the π2p orbitals. Or wait, no, I might be mixing that up. Oh right, for diatomic molecules, the order is σ2s, σ*2s, then π2p (both x and y), then σ2p, and then their antibonding counterparts.

Wait, no, the correct filling order is: the σ2s and σ*2s come first, followed by the π2p orbitals (each holding 2 electrons each, so 4 in total for both π2px and π2py), and then the σ2p. Or wait, maybe the σ2p is actually lower in energy than the π2p? No, I think for O2 and N2, the order is σ2s, σ*2s, then π2p, then σ2p. So let's go with that.

So for He2:

Each He has 2 electrons, so total 4 electrons in He2.

The filling would be:
- σ2s: 2 electrons (bonding)
- σ*2s: 2 electrons (antibonding)

So bonding electrons = 2 (from σ2s), antibonding = 2 (from σ*2s). So bond order is (2-2)/2 = 0. So He2 has a bond order of 0, which makes sense because helium is a noble gas and doesn't form bonds easily. So He2 doesn't exist as a molecule; it's just two separate He atoms.

Now for He2+. So He has 2 electrons each, so He2+ would have 4 -1 = 3 electrons? Wait, no. Wait, when two He atoms combine, each contributes 2 electrons, so He2 has 4 electrons. If it loses a positive charge, that means it's lost one electron. So He2+ has 3 electrons.

So filling the molecular orbitals for He2+:
- σ2s: 2 electrons
- σ*2s: 1 electron (since only 3 total, after σ2s is filled with 2, the remaining 1 goes into σ*2s)

So bonding electrons = 2, antibonding = 1. Bond order is (2-1)/2 = 0.5.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake. Because sometimes, for molecules like He2+, the order might change, but I don't think so. Let's think again.

The molecular orbitals for diatomic molecules are filled in the order: σ2s, σ*2s, π2px, π2py, σ2pz. Wait, no, σ2pz is higher in energy than the π2p orbitals for diatomics with Z<8. So for He, which is Z=2, the order is σ2s → σ*2s → π2p (x and y) → σ2pz.

Wait, but for He, the 2p orbitals are actually higher in energy than 2s, but in molecular orbital theory, the σ2p is lower than the π2p? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, I think for elements with atomic number less than 8 (like O), the order is that the π orbitals are filled before the σ. So for He, which is Z=2, the π2p orbitals would come after σ*2s.

So in He2+, with 3 electrons:

σ2s holds 2, σ*2s holds 1. So bonding is 2, antibonding is 1. So bond order is (2-1)/2 = 0.5.

So He2 has bond order 0, He2+ has bond order 0.5.

Looking back at the options, option A says He2 has 0 and He2+ has 0.5. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I thought He2+ might have a bond order of 0.5, which is option A. So yes, the bond order for He2 is 0, and for He2+ it's 0.5. So the correct answer is A.

To determine the bond order of He₂ and He₂⁺, we use molecular orbital theory. Bond order is calculated as:

\[
\text{Bond Order} = \frac{\text{Bonding Electrons} - \text{Antibonding Electrons}}{2}
\]

### For He₂:
- Each helium atom has 2 electrons, so He₂ has a total of 4 electrons.
- The molecular orbitals fill in the order: σ₂s, σ*₂s, π₂px, π₂py, σ₂pz.
- The first two electrons fill the bonding σ₂s orbital, and the next two fill the antibonding σ*₂s orbital.
- Bonding electrons = 2, Antibonding electrons = 2.
- Bond order = (2 - 2) / 2 = 0.

Thus, He₂ has a bond order of 0, meaning it does not form a stable molecule.

### For He₂⁺:
- He₂⁺ has one fewer electron than He₂, so it has 3 electrons.
- The molecular orbitals fill in the same order: σ₂s, σ*₂s, π₂px, π₂py, σ₂pz.
- The first two electrons fill the bonding σ₂s orbital, and the remaining electron fills the antibonding σ*₂s orbital.
- Bonding electrons = 2, Antibonding electrons = 1.
- Bond order = (2 - 1) / 2 = 0.5.

Thus, He₂⁺ has a bond order of 0.5.

### Conclusion:
- The bond order of He₂ is 0, and the bond order of He₂⁺ is 0.5.
- The correct option is **A**.
