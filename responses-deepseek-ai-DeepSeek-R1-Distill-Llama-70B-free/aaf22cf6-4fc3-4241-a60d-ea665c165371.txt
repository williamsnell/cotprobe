Okay, so I have this differential equation dy/dx = y² e^x, and I need to find y(6) using Euler's method. The initial condition is y(0) = 0.01, and the step size h is 0.5. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

Euler's method is a numerical way to approximate the solution to a DE. The formula is y_{n+1} = y_n + h * f(x_n, y_n). Here, f(x, y) is dy/dx, which in this case is y² e^x. So I'll need to compute each step from x=0 to x=6, stepping by 0.5 each time.

Wait, how many steps is that? Let's see, from 0 to 6 with step 0.5. So 6 / 0.5 = 12 steps. So I'll have to iterate 12 times, each time calculating the next y value.

Starting with x0 = 0, y0 = 0.01.

Let me make a table to track each step.

Step 0:
x0 = 0
y0 = 0.01

Step 1:
x1 = 0.5
To find y1: y1 = y0 + h * (y0² e^{x0})
y0 squared is (0.01)^2 = 0.0001, multiplied by e^0 =1. So 0.0001 * 1 = 0.0001.
Multiply by h=0.5: 0.0001 * 0.5 = 0.00005.
Add to y0: 0.01 + 0.00005 = 0.01005.

So y1=0.01005.

Step 2:
x1=0.5, y1=0.01005.
Compute f(x1,y1)= (0.01005)^2 * e^0.5.
First, (0.01005)^2 = approx 0.0001010025.
e^0.5 is about 1.64872.
Multiply: 0.0001010025 * 1.64872 ≈ 0.00016636.

So the next change is h * that: 0.5 * 0.00016636 ≈ 0.00008318.

y2 = y1 + 0.00008318 = 0.01005 + 0.00008318 ≈ 0.01013318.

Wait, let me check that calculation. No, wait, 0.01005 plus 0.00008318 is 0.01013318. Hmm, but wait, 0.01 is 0.01, adding 0.00005 makes 0.01005, then adding 0.00008318 gives 0.01013318. Yeah.

Step 3:
x2=1.0, y2≈0.01013318.
Compute f(x2, y2)= (0.01013318)^2 * e^1.
(0.01013318)^2 is approx (0.01)^2 is 0.0001, but more accurately, 0.01013318^2 ≈ 0.00010268.

e^1 is about 2.71828.

Multiply: 0.00010268 * 2.71828 ≈ 0.0002795.

h=0.5, so 0.5 * 0.0002795 ≈ 0.00013975.

y3 = 0.01013318 + 0.00013975 ≈ 0.01027293.

Step 4:
x3=1.5, y3≈0.01027293.
f(x3,y3)= (0.01027293)^2 * e^1.5.
(0.01027293)^2 ≈ 0.0001055.

e^1.5 is approx 4.48169.

Multiply: 0.0001055 *4.48169 ≈ 0.0004733.

h=0.5, so 0.5 * 0.0004733 = 0.00023665.

y4 = 0.01027293 + 0.00023665 ≈ 0.01050958.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate that. 0.01027293 squared is (approx) 0.00010553. Multiply by e^1.5 which is about 4.4817.

So 0.00010553 *4.4817 = let's compute this: 0.0001 *4.4817 is 0.00044817, and 0.00000553*4.4817 is about 0.0000248. So total is approx 0.00044817 + 0.0000248 ≈ 0.00047297. Then multiply by h=0.5: 0.00047297 *0.5=0.00023648. So y4 is 0.01027293 + 0.00023648 = 0.01050941.

So y4 ≈0.01050941.

Step 5:
x4=2.0, y4≈0.01050941.
f(x4,y4)= (0.01050941)^2 * e^2.
(0.01050941)^2 = approx 0.0001105.

e^2 is about 7.38906.

Multiply: 0.0001105 *7.38906 ≈ 0.0008166.

h=0.5: 0.5 * 0.0008166 ≈ 0.0004083.

y5=0.01050941 +0.0004083 ≈ 0.01091771.

Wait, wait. Let me compute (0.01050941)^2 more accurately. 0.0105^2 is 0.00011025, but precise calculation: 0.01050941 * 0.01050941.

0.01 *0.01=0.0001. 0.01 *0.00050941=0.0000050941, and same for the other, so 2*(0.01)(0.00050941)=0.0000101882, then (0.00050941)^2≈0.0000002594. So total is 0.0001 +0.0000101882 +0.0000002594≈0.0001104476.

So 0.0001104476 *7.38906 ≈ Let me compute that:

0.0001 *7.38906 = 0.000738906

0.0000104476 *7.38906 ≈ approximately 0.0000772.

Adding up: 0.000738906 + 0.0000772 ≈ 0.000816106.

Multiply by 0.5: 0.000408053.

So y5 = 0.01050941 + 0.000408053 ≈ 0.010917463.

So y5≈0.010917463.

Step6:
x5=2.5, y5≈0.010917463.
f(x5,y5)= (0.010917463)^2 *e^2.5.

Compute (0.010917463)^2: approx 0.00011908.

e^2.5 is about 12.18249.

Multiply: 0.00011908 *12.18249 ≈ 0.0014518.

h=0.5: 0.5 *0.0014518 ≈ 0.0007259.

y6 =0.010917463 +0.0007259 ≈ 0.01164336.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

(0.010917463)^2 = 0.010917463 *0.010917463.

Well, 0.01^2=0.0001. Then, 2*(0.01)*(0.000917463)=0.00001834926. (0.000917463)^2≈0.0000008414.

So total: 0.0001 +0.00001834926 +0.0000008414≈0.00011919066.

Multiply by e^2.5=12.18249: 0.00011919066 *12.18249 ≈

Let me compute 0.00011919066 *12 = 0.0014302869, and 0.00011919066 *0.18249≈approx 0.00002177.

Adding together: 0.0014302869 +0.00002177≈0.001452056.

Multiply by h=0.5: 0.000726028.

So y6=0.010917463 +0.000726028≈0.011643491.

Step7:
x6=3.0, y6≈0.011643491.
f(x6,y6)= (0.011643491)^2 * e^3.

(0.011643491)^2 is approx 0.00013553.

e^3≈20.0855.

Multiply: 0.00013553 *20.0855 ≈ 0.002724.

h=0.5: 0.5 *0.002724 =0.001362.

y7=0.011643491 +0.001362 ≈0.013005491.

Wait, more accurately:

(0.011643491)^2 = (approx) 0.0116^2=0.00013456, but precise calculation would be better.

0.011643491 * 0.011643491: Let me compute it.

0.01 *0.01 =0.0001.

0.01 *0.001643491=0.00001643491, times 2 (since both terms have it): 0.00003286982.

(0.001643491)^2≈0.000002699.

So total: 0.0001 + 0.00003286982 +0.000002699≈0.0001355688.

Multiply by 20.0855: 0.0001355688 *20.0855 ≈ 0.0027255 (0.0001355688 *20=0.002711378; 0.0001355688 *0.0855≈0.0000116. So total ~0.00272298).

Multiply by h=0.5: 0.00136149.

y7=0.011643491 +0.00136149≈0.01300498.

So y7≈0.013005.

Step8:
x7=3.5, y7≈0.013005.
f(x7,y7)= (0.013005)^2 *e^3.5.

(0.013005)^2=0.00016913.

e^3.5 is approx 33.115.

Multiply: 0.00016913 *33.115 ≈ 0.005598.

h=0.5: 0.5 *0.005598≈0.002799.

y8=0.013005 +0.002799≈0.015804.

Wait, let's be precise. (0.013005)^2 is 0.013005 *0.013005.

0.01 *0.01 =0.0001.

0.01 *0.003005=0.00003005, so times 2: 0.0000601.

(0.003005)^2 ≈0.00000903.

Total: 0.0001 +0.0000601 +0.00000903≈0.00016913.

Multiply by e^3.5=33.115: 0.00016913 *33.115.

Compute 0.0001*33.115=0.0033115.

0.00006913 *33.115≈approx 0.002290.

Total≈0.0033115 +0.002290=0.0056015.

Multiply by h=0.5: 0.00280075.

y8=0.013005 +0.00280075=0.01580575.

So y8≈0.0158058.

Step9:
x8=4.0, y8≈0.0158058.
f(x8,y8)= (0.0158058)^2 *e^4.

(0.0158058)^2= approx 0.0002497.

e^4≈54.59815.

Multiply: 0.0002497 *54.59815 ≈0.01363.

h=0.5: 0.5 *0.01363≈0.006815.

y9=0.0158058 +0.006815≈0.0226208.

Wait, precise calculation:

(0.0158058)^2 = 0.00024970.

Multiply by 54.59815: 0.00024970 *54.59815.

Let me compute 0.0002 *54.59815=0.01091963.

0.00004970 *54.59815≈0.002713.

So total≈0.01091963 +0.002713=0.01363263.

Multiply by h=0.5: 0.006816315.

So y9=0.0158058 +0.006816315≈0.02262212.

Step10:
x9=4.5, y9≈0.02262212.
f(x9,y9)= (0.02262212)^2 *e^4.5.

(0.02262212)^2= approx 0.0005118.

e^4.5 is about 90.0171.

Multiply: 0.0005118 *90.0171≈0.04609.

h=0.5: 0.5 *0.04609≈0.023045.

y10=0.02262212 +0.023045≈0.04566712.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

(0.02262212)^2 = ?

0.02262212 *0.02262212 = (approx 0.0226)^2 = 0.00051176.

e^4.5=90.0171.

Multiply: 0.00051176 *90.0171 ≈ 0.04609.

h=0.5: 0.023045.

y10=0.02262212 +0.023045 =0.04566712.

Step11:
x10=5.0, y10≈0.04566712.
f(x10,y10)= (0.04566712)^2 * e^5.

(0.04566712)^2 = approx 0.002086.

e^5≈148.4132.

Multiply: 0.002086 *148.4132 ≈ 0.3094.

h=0.5: 0.5 *0.3094≈0.1547.

y11=0.04566712 +0.1547 ≈0.20036712.

Wait, precise calculation.

(0.04566712)^2 = 0.04566712 *0.04566712.

0.04^2=0.0016.

0.04 *0.00566712 = 0.00022685, times 2: 0.0004537.

(0.00566712)^2≈0.0000321.

So total: 0.0016 +0.0004537 +0.0000321≈0.0020858.

Multiply by e^5=148.4132: 0.0020858 *148.4132.

0.002 *148.4132=0.2968264.

0.0000858 *148.4132≈approx 0.01274.

So total≈0.3095664.

Multiply by h=0.5: 0.1547832.

y11=0.04566712 +0.1547832≈0.20045032.

Step12:
x11=5.5, y11≈0.20045032.
f(x11,y11)= (0.20045032)^2 *e^5.5.

(0.20045)^2=approx 0.0401805.

e^5.5 is about 244.692.

Multiply: 0.0401805 *244.692 ≈0.0401805 *200=8.0361, 0.0401805 *44.692≈approx 1.798. So total≈9.834.

h=0.5: 0.5 *9.834≈4.917.

y12=0.20045032 +4.917≈5.11745.

Wait, that's a big jump. Let me compute more accurately.

(0.20045032)^2 =0.20045032 *0.20045032≈0.0401805.

e^5.5= e^(5 + 0.5)=e^5 *e^0.5=148.4132 *1.64872≈244.692.

Multiply 0.0401805 *244.692.

Let me compute this accurately:

0.04 *244.692=9.78768.

0.0001805 *244.692≈0.04416.

So total of 9.78768 +0.04416≈9.83184.

Multiply by h=0.5: 4.91592.

So y12= 0.20045032 +4.91592≈5.11637.

So after 12 steps (h=0.5 each), y(6)= approx 5.11637.

Looking at the options, option J is 5.113, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made some rounding errors in each step. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the last step.

Wait, in step 12, perhaps I should compute y12 more accurately.

Wait, let me recompute step 12.

y11=0.20045032.

f(x11,y11)=(0.20045032)^2 * e^5.5.

Compute (0.20045032)^2: 0.2^2=0.04, 0.00045032^2 is negligible, but precise calculation:

0.20045032 *0.20045032: Let's compute 0.2*0.2=0.04.

0.2*0.00045032=0.000090064, so two times that (since both factors have the term) is 0
