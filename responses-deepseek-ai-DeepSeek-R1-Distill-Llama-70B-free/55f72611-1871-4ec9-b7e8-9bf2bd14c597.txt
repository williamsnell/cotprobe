Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about activation energy and how a temperature change affects the reaction rate. Hmm, I remember something about the Arrhenius equation from my notes. Let me try to recall.

The problem says that raising the temperature by 10°C at 0°C would triple the reaction rate. So, the initial temperature is 0°C, and the new temperature is 10°C. Wait, 0°C is 273.15 K, right? So adding 10°C would make it 283.15 K.

The reaction rate triples when we go from 273.15 K to 283.15 K. I think the Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant k with temperature and activation energy (Ea). The equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(R*T)), where A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Since we have two temperatures and two rates, maybe I can use the two-point form of the Arrhenius equation. Oh right, the equation that comes from taking the ratio of the two rate constants. Because when you take k2/k1, the A terms cancel out.

So the formula I think is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1). Because when you take the natural log of both sides, the ln(A) cancels, and you're left with Ea terms.

In this problem, k2 is triple k1, so k2/k1 is 3. T1 is 273.15 K, and T2 is 283.15 K. R is the gas constant, which I think is 8.314 J/mol·K.

Putting in the numbers, I can rearrange the equation to solve for Ea.

Let me write this out:

ln(3) = (Ea / R) * (1/273.15 - 1/283.15)

Wait, wait, no, wait. Because the formula is (1/T1 - 1/T2) multiplied by Ea/R. So the denominator is R, and multiplied by that difference.

So let me calculate 1/T1 and 1/T2 first.

T1 = 273.15 K → 1/T1 ≈ 0.003663 K^-1
T2 = 283.15 K → 1/T2 ≈ 0.003534 K^-1

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = 0.003663 - 0.003534 = 0.000129 K^-1

So the equation becomes:

ln(3) = (Ea / R) * (0.000129)

I can solve for Ea by rearranging this.

Ea = ln(3) * R / (0.000129)

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the equation is ln(3) = (Ea/R) * (delta(1/T)), so Ea = [ ln(3) * R ] / (delta(1/T)) )

Wait that's right. Because Ea = [ ln(k2/k1) * R ] / [ (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

Wait, yes, because if you have ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2), then Ea = [ln(k2/k1) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So, let's compute each part.

First, ln(3) is approximately 1.0986.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So numerator is 1.0986 * 8.314 ≈ let's calculate this.

1.0986 * 8 = 8.7888, 1.0986 * 0.314 = approx 0.345. So total is about 9.1338.

Wait, exact calculation: 8.314 * 1.0986.

Let me compute 8 * 1.0986 = 8.7888, 0.314 *1.0986 = 0.3451. So 8.7888 + 0.3451 = 9.1339 J/mol·K.

Denominator is 0.000129 K^-1.

So Ea = 9.1339 / 0.000129 = ?

Let me compute this. 9.1339 divided by 0.000129.

Hmm, 0.000129 is 1.29e-4. So 9.1339 / 1.29e-4 = 9.1339 / 0.000129.

Let me compute 9.1339 / 0.000129.

Well, 0.000129 is 1.29e-4. So 9.1339 / 1.29e-4 = (9.1339 / 1.29) * 1e4.

9.1339 / 1.29 ≈ let's see. 1.29 *7=9.03, which is close to 9.1339. So approximately 7.06.

So 7.06 * 1e4 = 7.06e4 J/mol.

Wait, 7.06e4 is 70,600 J/mol, which is 7.06 ×10^4 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option G is 7.06 ×10^4 J/mol. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Alternative calculation approach:

Compute 9.1339 / 0.000129.

0.000129 is 129e-6. So 9.1339 / 129e-6 = (9.1339 / 129) ) * 1e6.

Wait, 9.1339 / 129 = approx 0.0708. So 0.0708 * 1e6 = 7.08e4 J/mol. Which is close to 7.06e4, so same as before.

So yeah, option G seems right.

To determine the activation energy (Ea) for a reaction where raising the temperature by 10°C at 0°C triples the reaction rate, we use the Arrhenius equation in its two-point form:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right) = \frac{E_a}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( k_2/k_1 = 3 \) (since the rate triples),
- \( T_1 = 273.15 \, \text{K} \) (0°C),
- \( T_2 = 283.15 \, \text{K} \) (10°C),
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \) (gas constant).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \ln(3) \)
\[
\ln(3) \approx 1.0986
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( 1/T_1 \) and \( 1/T_2 \)
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{273.15} \approx 0.003663 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{283.15} \approx 0.003534 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta(1/T) = 1/T_1 - 1/T_2 \)
\[
\Delta(1/T) = 0.003663 - 0.003534 = 0.000129 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( E_a \)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
E_a = \frac{\ln(3) \cdot R}{\Delta(1/T)}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
E_a = \frac{1.0986 \cdot 8.314}{0.000129}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
1.0986 \cdot 8.314 \approx 9.1339 \, \text{J/mol·K}
\]

Then divide by \( 0.000129 \, \text{K}^{-1} \):
\[
E_a = \frac{9.1339}{0.000129} \approx 7.06 \times 10^4 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The activation energy is approximately \( 7.06 \times 10^4 \, \text{J/mol} \), which corresponds to **option G**.
