Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about rockets and fuels. It's a bit tricky, but let's see if I can work through it step by step. 

Part (a) asks about the weight of oxygen required for every liter of kerosine. Kerosine is given as n-C14H30, so that's the structure. The density is 0.764 g/ml. Hmm, I remember that combustion reactions involve the fuel reacting with oxygen to produce CO2 and H2O. So the first thing I need to do is write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of C14H30.

The general form for the combustion of a hydrocarbon CxHy is: CxHy + (a) O2 → x CO2 + (y/2) H2O. So for C14H30, it would be C14H30 + (something) O2 → 14 CO2 + 15 H2O. Let me balance that.

Balancing the carbons is easy: 14 CO2. For hydrogen, 30 H in the fuel becomes 15 H2O, which has 30 H (since each H2O has 2 H, 15*2=30). So that's balanced. Now for oxygen: on the product side, each CO2 has 2 O, so 14*2=28 O from CO2. Each H2O has one O, so 15*1=15 O. Total O in products is 28 +15 =43 O atoms. Each O2 molecule provides 2 O atoms, so the number of O2 molecules needed is 43/2, which is 21.5. So the balanced equation is:

C14H30 + 21.5 O2 → 14 CO2 + 15 H2O.

Wait, but in reality, we don't write fractions. So multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction.

2 C14H30 + 43 O2 → 28 CO2 + 30 H2O.

But for stoichiometry, we can work with the coefficients as they are. So for each mole of C14H30, we need 21.5 moles of O2.

Now, I need to find the mass of O2 per liter of kerosine. First, find the molar mass of kerosine (C14H30). Carbon is about 12 g/mol, so 14*12=168. Hydrogen is 1 g/mol, so 30*1=30. Total molar mass is 168+30=198 g/mol.

Density is 0.764 g/ml, which is the same as 764 g/L (since 1 L = 1000 ml, so 0.764 *1000=764 g/L). So the number of moles in one liter is density divided by molar mass. That's 764 g/L / 198 g/mol ≈ let's calculate that.

764 / 198. Let me compute: 198 *3=594, 198*3.8= 198*(3+0.8)=594 +158.4=752.4. 752.4 is less than 764. The difference is 764-752.4=11.6. So 11.6 /198 ≈ 0.0586. So total moles ≈3.8 +0.0586 ≈3.8586 moles per liter. Let me double-check that calculation. 198 *3.8586 equals approximately 764?

Wait, 198 *3=594, 198*0.8=158.4, 198*0.05=9.9, 198*0.0086≈1.7. Adding those: 594+158.4=752.4, +9.9=762.3, +1.7=764. So yes, about 3.8586 moles per liter.

Now, per mole of C14H30, we need 21.5 moles of O2. So for 3.8586 moles of kerosine, we need 3.8586 *21.5 moles of O2. Let me compute that.

3.8586 *20 =77.172, 3.8586 *1.5=5.7879. So total is 77.172 +5.7879=82.9599 moles O2.

Now, the molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol (since O is 16, 16*2=32). So mass of O2 needed is 82.9599 moles *32 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 82 *32=2624, 0.9599 *32≈30.678. So total ≈2624 +30.678=2654.678 grams. So approximately 2655 grams. Looking at the options, let's see:

Options for part (a):

A: 2660 g

B: 2500

C:2550

D:2400

E:2800

F:3000

G:2600

H:2700

I:2750

J:2800

So the closest is A:2660, G:2600, or maybe E:2800. But wait, my calculation is approximately 2655, so A is 2660, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a rounding error. Let me check the exact numbers.

Wait, when I calculated the moles of kerosine: 764 /198. Let me compute it more precisely.

198 *3=594, 198*3.8= 3*198=594, 0.8*198=158.4 → total 752.4. 764-752.4=11.6. 11.6 /198 = 0.058585... So moles =3.858585... 

Then moles O2 needed: 3.858585 *21.5 = ?

Let me compute 3.858585 *21.5.

3.858585 *20=77.1717, 3.858585 *1.5=5.7878775. Sum is 77.1717 +5.7878775=82.9595775 moles O2.

Each mole O2 is 32g, so 82.9595775 *32= ?

Let me compute 82.9595775 *32:

82 *32=2624, 0.9595775 *32=30.6866. So 2624 +30.6866=2654.6866 grams. So approximately 2654.69 g. So 2655g. The options don't have 2655, but option A is 2660, which is very close. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait another thing: the problem says "weight of oxygen", so that's grams. So 2655g is part (a). Looking at the options, the first part of each option is the a) answer.

So options with around 2655g are A:2660, G:2600, E:2800... So A is 2660, which is 5 grams higher than our computed 2655. Maybe my approximation was a bit off.

Wait perhaps I should compute the moles more accurately. Let's recalculate 764 /198.

198 *3 =594, 198 *3.8= 3.8 *200=760, but wait, 198 is 2 less than 200. So 3.8 *198=3.8*(200-2)=3.8*200=760 -3.8*2=7.6 →760-7.6=752.4. So 752.4 g, as before. So 764-752.4=11.6g left. 11.6 /198 per mole. 11.6 /198 =0.0585858... So 3.8585858 moles.

So 3.8585858 *21.5= ?

Let me compute 3.8585858 *21.5.

3 *21.5=64.5, 0.8585858 *21.5. Let's compute 0.8 *21.5=17.2, 0.05*21.5=1.075, 0.0085858 *21.5≈0.1846. So 17.2+1.075=18.275 +0.1846=18.4596. 

So total is 64.5 +18.4596=82.9596 moles O2. So 82.9596 *32=2654.3872 grams. So approximately 2654g, so 2654g. So the closest is option A:2660g.

But wait, perhaps I should check the initial assumption. Did I balance the equation correctly? Let me double-check.

The combustion equation: C14H30 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

Balancing C: 14 CO2.

H: 30 H →15 H2O.

O: 14*2 (from CO2) +15*1 (from H2O) =28 +15=43 O. So 43/2 O2 molecules, which is 21.5 O2. So the stoichiometric ratio is correct.

So part (a) is about 2654g, which is very close to option A's 2660g. But looking at the options, option G is 2600g. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps during the moles calculation, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, let me compute 764 /198 precisely. 

198 is 198.0.

So 198 × 3 =594.0 → subtract from 764 →764−594=170.

Bring down a zero (as if decimal division): 170.0 →198 goes into 1700 how many times?

198 ×8=1584 → 1700−1584=116 → bring down zero: 1160.

198 ×5=990 → 1160−990=170 → it's repeating. So 3.85... So 3.8585... So 3.85858... So 3.85858 *21.5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 3.858585 *21.5.

21.5 is 21 and 0.5. So 3.858585 *21 = 3 *21=63, 0.858585 *21≈18.04. So 63+18.04=81.04. Then 3.858585 *0.5=1.9292925. So total is 81.04 +1.9293 ≈83. (Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3.858585 *21.5 is (3.858585 *20) + (3.858585 *1.5) =77.1717 +5.7878775=82.95958. So 82.95958 moles O2.)

82.95958 *32=2654.386. So 2654.39 grams. So about 2654g. So the closest option is A:2660. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me recheck.

Molar mass of C14H30: C is 12.01, H is 1.008.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says to assume average composition of n-C14H30. So perhaps using exact atomic weights?

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem assumes approximate atomic weights, like C=12, H=1. So 14*12=168, 30*1=30 →198 g/mol. So that part is correct.

Wait another thought: is the equation balanced for O correctly?

Wait, for each CO2, 2 O. 14 CO2 →28 O. Each H2O has 1 O. 15 H2O →15 O. Total O in products:43. So O2 needed is 43/2 =21.5 moles per mole of C14H30. So that's correct.

So part (a) is approximately 2654g, which is closest to option A:2660g. But looking at the options, option G is 2600g, which is a bit lower. Hmm. Maybe I did a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps the kerosine's density is 0.764 g/ml. So that's 764 grams per liter. So 764g/L. Molar mass is 198 g/mol. So 764 /198 = approx 3.8586 mol/L. Correct.

So O2 needed is 3.8586 *21.5=82.9596 mol. 82.9596 *32=2654.387 g. So 2654g. So the options don't have 2654, but option A is 2660, which is about 6 grams higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use more precise values, like more decimal places in molar masses.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute more accurately the moles of kerosine. Let's compute 764 divided by 198.

Let me compute 198 ×3 =594. 764−594=170. Bring down a zero: 1700. 198 ×8=1584. 1700−1584=116. Bring down a zero:1160. 198 ×5=990. 1160−990=170. So it's 3.85858... So 3.85858... So 3.85858 moles.

Then, 3.85858 *21.5 = ?

3.85858 *20=77.1716, 3.85858 *1.5=5.78787. So sum is 77.1716 +5.78787=82.95947.

82.95947 *32=2654.323. So 2654.32 grams. So again, about 2654g.

Looking at the options, the closest would be option A:2660g. But wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: 2,660 g, 8,710 kcal

B: 2,500 g, 8,500 kcal

C: 2,550 g, 9,100 kcal

D: 2,400 g, 8,200 kcal

E: 2,800 g, 8,800 kcal

F: 3,000 g, 10,000 kcal

G: 2,600 g, 8,650 kcal

H: 2,700 g, 8,900 kcal

I: 2,750 g, 9,250 kcal

J: 2,800 g, 9,000 kcal

So my calculation for part (a) is 2654, which is approximately 2650. Option G is 2600g, which is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the stoichiometry or perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the combustion is written as C14H30 + O2 → CO2 + H2O, but the actual balanced equation may have different coefficients. Let me balance it again.

The formula is C14H30 + O2 →14 CO2 +15 H2O.

So, on the product side:

C:14 → okay.

H:30 →15*2=30 → okay.

O: 14*2 (from CO2) +15*1 (from H2O) =28 +15=43 → so O2 is 43/2=21.5 moles.

So that's correct. So stoichiometry is right.

Wait, could it be that the question uses O instead of O2? No, because the question is about weight of O2. So no, I think that's correct.

So part (a) is around 2654g, so option A (2660) and G (2600) are the closest. Hmm. But I'm not sure why the exact value isn't in the options. Maybe I did a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me compute the molar ratio as O2 per volume of kerosine, but perhaps in terms of mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass of O2 per liter of kerosine using the molar masses and densities.

Wait, let's think in terms of moles per liter of kerosine. So 1L kerosine is 764g, molar mass 198 g/mol →764/198 ≈3.8586 mol.

Each mole of kerosine requires 21.5 mol O2, so 3.8586 *21.5 ≈82.96 mol O2. O2's molar mass is 32g/mol →82.96 *32≈2654g.

Hmm, same as before.

So part (a) answer is approximately 2654g. So the closest option is A:2660g, which is 6g higher.

Now, part (b): How much energy is required to fragment the molecules in one liter of kerosine? The problem states to assume 157 kcal per mole for each -CH2- group and 186 kcal per mole for each -CH3 group.

Wait, so kerosine is n-C14H30. So it's a straight chain with 14 carbons. So each molecule has how many CH2 and CH3 groups?

n-C14H30 structure is CH3-CH2-CH2-...-CH2-CH3. So the two ends are CH3 groups, and the rest are CH2. So for a 14-carbon chain, there are 2 CH3 groups and 12 CH2 groups. So in one mole of C14H30, how many CH2 and CH3 groups are present?

Each molecule has 2 CH3 and 12 CH2. So per mole, there are 2 moles of CH3 groups and 12 moles of CH2 groups.

So the energy required is (12 *157) + (2 *186) =?

Let me compute:

12 *157 = 1884 kcal.

2 *186 =372 kcal.

Total: 1884 +372 =2256 kcal per mole of C14H30.

Wait, but the question is about one liter of kerosine. So we need to find the number of moles in one liter, then multiply by the energy per mole.

Earlier, we found that one liter is 3.8586 moles.

So energy required is 3.8586 moles *2256 kcal/mol.

Wait, let me compute that.

3.8586 *2000=7,717.2

3.8586 *256= ?

Wait, 2256 is 2000 +256.

3.8586 *2000=7717.2

3.8586 *256: let
