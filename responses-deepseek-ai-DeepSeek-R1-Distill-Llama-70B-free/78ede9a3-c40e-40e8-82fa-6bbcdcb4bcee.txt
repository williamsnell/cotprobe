Question:

A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm where he scraped it on a tree branch 2 days ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (101°F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?

Options:

A: Disruption of vascular basement membranes
B: Decreased plasma protein concentration
C: Reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure
D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation
E: Reduced lymphatic drainage
F: Release of thromboxane
G: High blood pressure
H: Release of histamine
I: Separation of endothelial junctions
J: Increased hydrostatic pressure

Okay, so I have this question about a patient with an injury and some swelling. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The patient is a 35-year-old man who scraped his right arm on a tree branch two days ago. Now he's experiencing pain and swelling. His temperature is 38.3°C, which is higher than normal, so he has a fever. On examination, there's edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the trauma site. It's also extremely tender.

The question is about the primary mechanism causing the edema. The options are A through J.

I remember that edema is the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space. So, what causes that? I think it's related to the balance between forces that push fluid out of blood vessels and those that keep it in. The main factors are hydrostatic pressure (pushing fluid out) and oncotic pressure (pulling fluid back in), along with the integrity of the capillary walls and lymphatic drainage.

In this case, the patient has a traumatic injury with signs of inflammation—redness, swelling, warmth, tenderness. Inflammation often leads to increased permeability of capillaries. So, when there's inflammation, the capillaries let more fluid and proteins leak into the interstitial space, leading to edema.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation. That sounds relevant because inflammation causes the capillaries to become more permeable, allowing more fluid to leak out.

Option H: Release of histamine. Histamine is a mediator released during allergic reactions and inflammation. It can cause blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. So histamine release could be a part of the process, but it's more of a mediator leading to increased permeability rather than the primary mechanism itself.

Option I: Separation of endothelial junctions. This would directly lead to increased permeability. Inflammation causes the endothelial cells to contract and the junctions between them to open, so plasma can leak out.

Wait, so options D and I are similar. D says increased capillary permeability due to inflammation, and I says separation of endothelial junctions. Which one is more accurate as the primary mechanism?

I think the primary mechanism is the increased permeability, which results from the separation of the endothelial junctions. So the question is about the mechanism, not the mediator. Or is the mechanism the increased permeability, which is the result of the separation.

Wait, the question asks for the primary mechanism. So the process is that during inflammation, the capillary permeability increases because the junctions between endothelial cells open up. So the primary mechanism in the pathophysiology is the increased permeability, which is due to the separation of the junctions.

Alternatively, thinking about Starling forces: the balance between hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. If the permeability increases, the reflection coefficient for proteins decreases, so more protein can leave the capillaries. This would increase the interstitial oncotic pressure, but in this case, the primary issue is the fluid leaking out due to inflammation.

So in this patient, the edema is most likely due to inflammation leading to increased capillary permeability. So the primary mechanism is increased capillary permeability. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the mechanism. So, the mechanism could be D or I. Because increased permeability is the overall effect, but the mechanism causing it is the separation of the junctions.

Hmm, the options are:

D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation.

I: Separation of endothelial junctions.

So which is the primary mechanism? I think D is the correct answer because the question is about the mechanism of edema development in this context. The underlying cause is the inflammation leading to increased permeability, which is the mechanism. The separation of junctions is part of the process but might be a step further in the mechanism.

So in the options, D says increased permeability due to inflammation. Which is exactly what's happening here. Because the patient has an infection or inflammation after the trauma, leading to the capillaries becoming more permeable, causing edema.

Alternatively, H is the release of histamine. Histamine does cause increased permeability, but it's more of a mediator. The question is about the primary mechanism, not the mediator.

So the answer is D.
</think>

The patient is a 35-year-old man with pain, swelling, and fever after a traumatic injury to his right arm. Examination reveals edema, a fluctuant erythematous lesion, and tenderness, indicating inflammation. The question asks for the primary mechanism of edema development in this context.

Edema results from an imbalance in forces that regulate fluid movement across capillary walls. Inflammation increases capillary permeability, allowing fluid and proteins to leak into the interstitial space. This is the primary mechanism in this case. While histamine (H) and separation of endothelial junctions (I) contribute to increased permeability, they are either mediators or steps in the process. The key mechanism is the overall increase in capillary permeability due to inflammation.

Option D, "Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation," best describes the primary mechanism of edema in this patient.

Answer: D
