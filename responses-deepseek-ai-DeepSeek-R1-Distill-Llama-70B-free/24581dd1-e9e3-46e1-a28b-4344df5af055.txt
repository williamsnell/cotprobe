Okay, so I have this question about DNA methylation enzymes and their roles during replication. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which enzyme copies the methylation marks from the parent strand to the daughter strand after DNA replication. I remember that DNA methylation is important for gene regulation and that it's maintained during cell division.

Wait, DNA replication is semi-conservative, right? So each new DNA molecule has one original strand and one new strand. Methylation is a way to mark the DNA, and these marks need to be copied so that the daughter cells have the same patterns as the parent.

I think DNMT stands for DNA methyltransferase. There are different types like DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, and DNMT3L. So what do these do?

DNMT1... Oh, right! DNMT1 is known as the maintenance methyltransferase. Its role is to add methyl groups to the new strand after replication. Because after replication, the original strand is methylated, and the new one isn't. So DNMT1 uses the parent strand as a template to methylate the daughter strand, ensuring that the methylation pattern is copied.

DNMT3a and DNMT3b are involved in de novo methylation. They set up the methylation patterns during development, not maintaining them after replication. DNMT3L, I think, doesn't have enzymatic activity itself but helps the other DNMT3s.

So putting it together, the enzyme responsible for copying methylation during replication is DNMT1. So the answer should be option A.

The enzyme responsible for copying methylation marks from the parental strand to the daughter strand during DNA replication is DNMT1. DNMT1 acts as a maintenance methyltransferase, ensuring that methylation patterns are preserved after replication by using the parent strand as a template to methylate the new strand.
