Question:

A student was a practical joker who liked to perform zany antics. Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, "Study this, baby!" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

Options:

A: Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.
B: Attempted violation of the statute.
C: Both indecent exposure and attempted violation of the statute.
D: Both trespassing and attempted violation of the statute.
E: Both burglary and indecent exposure.
F: Trespassing only.
G: Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.
H: Indecent exposure only.
I: Both burglary and trespassing.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with burglary and indecent exposure. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: There's a student who's a prankster. He likes to do zany stuff, like walking around campus in just a raincoat and boxers. At night, he would approach young women and flash them by opening his raincoat, showing himself in his shorts. He thinks he's committing a crime by doing this, but in this jurisdiction, it's a felony to expose oneself in the nude. So apparently, what he's doing isn't a crime because maybe he's not fully nudeâ€”just in shorts. 

One night, he breaks into a sorority house intending to flash the sisters. He's wearing just the raincoat and shorts. He enters one sister's bedroom, and she's in bed studying. She knows him and asks him what he's doing. He takes off his raincoat and says, "Study this, baby!" Then he starts running through the house in his shorts. The police arrive and arrest him.

The question is asking what crime(s) he should be found guilty of. The options are combinations of burglary, attempted violation of the statute, indecent exposure, trespassing, etc.

So, I need to figure out which crimes apply here. Let me recall the elements of the relevant crimes.

First, burglary. At common law, burglary is the unlawful entry into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony inside. So, the key elements are: breaking and entering, into a dwelling, with felonious intent.

In this case, the student broke into the sorority house, which is a dwelling. So that's the breaking and entering part. Now, did he have the intent to commit a felony when he entered? His intent was to flash the sisters. But in this jurisdiction, flashing isn't a crime because he's not nude. So, if the intended act isn't a crime, can he still be guilty of burglary?

Wait, the student thought he was committing a crime by flashing, but actually, it's not illegal. So his intent was to do something he thought was a felony but isn't. Hmm. Or perhaps the intended act, even if not illegal, could still count for burglary if he believed it was a felony. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think for burglary, the intent must be to commit a crime that actually exists. So if the act he intended (flashing) isn't a crime, then he didn't have the intent to commit a felony. Therefore, no burglary.

Alternatively, maybe the student had the intent when he entered. He intended to expose himself, which he thought was a crime. But since it's not, maybe the intent isn't sufficient. So, no burglary.

Next, let's think about attempted violation of the statute. The statute makes it a felony to expose oneself in the nude. The student didn't actually expose himself in the nude; he was in shorts. So, did he attempt to violate the statute?

Attempt requires specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step toward its commission. Here, he intended to expose himself, but not in the nude. So, maybe he didn't have the intent to violate the statute because the statute requires being nude. So, his act didn't meet the elements, so no attempt either.

Wait, but when he took off his raincoat, he was in shorts. So he exposed himself but not in the nude. Therefore, he didn't actually commit indecent exposure as per the statute. But did he attempt it? Because the statute requires being nude, and he wasn't. So his action doesn't meet the elements of the crime. Therefore, no attempt.

Alternatively, maybe he thought he was committing a crime, so he had the intent, but the actus reus wasn't there. I'm a bit shaky here. But I think attempt requires that the intended acts, if completed, would constitute the crime. Since he thought that by flashing in shorts he was violating the law, but it's not, maybe he didn't have the intent to commit the actual crime. Or perhaps he did have the intent but the act doesn't meet the law's requirements.

So maybe no attempt either.

What about indecent exposure? The statute says it's a felony to expose oneself in the nude. He was in shorts, so not nude. Therefore, he didn't commit indecent exposure. So, no indecent exposure.

What about trespassing? Trespassing is entering someone's property without permission. He broke into the sorority house, so that's trespassing. But is it criminal trespass? Yes, because he unlawfully entered the dwelling.

So, at least he's guilty of trespassing.

Wait, the options include trespassing as a possibility. Let's look at the options. Option D is trespassing and attempted violation. Option F is trespassing only. Option I is burglary and trespassing.

But I thought burglary requires intent to commit a felony inside, which he didn't have, because his intended act wasn't a felony. So burglary is out. So he can't be guilty of burglary. So option I is out.

So, the student is guilty of trespassing. But is that all? What else?

Wait, when he entered the sister's room, he took off his raincoat and exposed himself in shorts. The sister was in her bed. Could that be considered indecent exposure? Wait, the statute requires being in the nude, so since he was in shorts, no. So no indecent exposure.

But perhaps there's another crime. Let's think about disorderly conduct or something else, but the options don't include that.

So, the only crime he's guilty of is trespassing. So option F is trespassing only.

Wait, but let me think again. When he entered the sorority house, he intended to flash the sisters. He broke in for that purpose. But since that act isn't a crime, he didn't have the intent to commit a felony, so no burglary. So, only trespassing.

But wait, what about when he took off his raincoat in the sister's room? Did he commit indecent exposure? No, because he was in shorts, so not nude. So, no indecent exposure.

Therefore, the only crime is trespassing. So the correct answer would be F: Trespassing only.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is trespassing and attempted violation. So, if he attempted to violate the statute, which requires exposure in the nude, but he didn't expose himself nude, so no attempt. So, D is out.

So, only trespassing. So F is correct. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: When he entered the house, he intended to expose himself, but that's not a crime, so no burglary. When he actually exposed himself, it's not indecent exposure because not nude. So, only trespassing.

Yes, so the answer should be F.

The student's actions must be analyzed in relation to the crimes of burglary, attempted violation of the statute, indecent exposure, and trespassing. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Burglary**: Burglary requires unlawful entry into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony inside. The student broke into the sorority house, which qualifies as a dwelling, but his intent was to flash the sisters. However, flashing in shorts is not a crime in this jurisdiction, so he lacked the intent to commit a felony. Therefore, he is not guilty of burglary.

2. **Attempted Violation of the Statute**: Attempt requires specific intent to commit a crime and a substantial step toward its commission. The statute criminalizes exposing oneself in the nude, but the student was wearing shorts, so his actions did not meet the legal definition of the crime. Thus, he did not attempt to violate the statute.

3. **Indecent Exposure**: Indecent exposure requires exposure in the nude. Since the student was wearing shorts, he was not nude, and therefore, he did not commit indecent exposure.

4. **Trespassing**: Trespassing involves unlawfully entering someone's property without permission. The student broke into the sorority house, which constitutes trespassing. This is the only crime he clearly committed.

Given the analysis, the student is guilty of trespassing only. 

ANSWER: F
