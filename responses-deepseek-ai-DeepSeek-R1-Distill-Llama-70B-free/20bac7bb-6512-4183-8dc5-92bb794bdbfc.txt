Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the pH of a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The solution contains 0.10 M sodium acetate and 0.03 M acetic acid. The apparent pKa for acetic acid at this ionic strength is 4.57. I need to find the pH at 25°C.

Alright, I remember that sodium acetate is the sodium salt of acetic acid. So in solution, sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and acetate ions (CH3COO^-). Acetic acid, on the other hand, is a weak acid and will dissociate partially. So together, they form a buffer solution.

Buffer solutions... Right, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).

Wait, but wait. The problem says the apparent pKa is 4.57, so I don't need to calculate it from scratch. I can use this value directly.

So the concentrations given: sodium acetate is 0.10 M, so [A-] is 0.10 M. Acetic acid is 0.03 M, so [HA] is 0.03 M.

Plugging into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = 4.57 + log(0.10 / 0.03)

Let me compute the ratio 0.10 / 0.03. That's approximately 3.333. The log of 3.333. Hmm, log(3) is about 0.477, log(3.333) is a bit higher. Let me think, 10^0.5 is about 3.16, and 10^0.52 is around 3.31? Or maybe just remember that log(3.333)=0.5228 approximately.

So pH = 4.57 + 0.5228. Let's add those up. 4.57 + 0.52 is 5.09, and then the 0.0028 adds up to 5.0928. So approximately 5.09.

Looking at the options, option J is 5.09. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait another thing. Does the ionic strength affect anything else? Oh, the question mentions that the apparent pKa is given, so we don't need to adjust the pKa ourselves. So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation directly with the given pKa is correct.

Yes, I think that's right. So the pH is 5.09.

To calculate the pH of the solution, we recognize that it is a buffer solution containing 0.10 M sodium acetate (CH3COONa) and 0.03 M acetic acid (CH3COOH). The apparent pKa for acetic acid at this ionic strength is given as 4.57. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer solutions:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)
\]

Here:
- \([\text{A}^-]\) is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate ion) = 0.10 M,
- \([\text{HA}]\) is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid) = 0.03 M.

Substituting the values into the equation:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.57 + \log\left(\frac{0.10}{0.03}\right)
\]

First, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{0.10}{0.03} \approx 3.333
\]

Next, find the logarithm:

\[
\log(3.333) \approx 0.5228
\]

Now, add this to the pKa:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.57 + 0.5228 \approx 5.09
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately 5.09. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 5.09**
