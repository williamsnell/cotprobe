Question:

The van der Waal equation is a modification of the ideal gas equation. It reads [P + (an^2 / V^2)] (V - nb) = nRT where P = pressure, V = volume, n = number of moles, R = gas constant, T = absolute temperature, and (a) and (b) are constants for a particular gas. The term an^2 /V^2 corrects the pressure for intermolecular attraction and the term - nb corrects the volume for molecular volume. Using this equation, determine whether a gas becomes more or less ideal when: (a.) the gas is compressed at constant temperature; (b.) more gas is added at constant volume and temperature; and (c.) The temperature of the gas is raised at constant volume.

Options:

A: more ideal, less ideal, more ideal
B: less ideal, more ideal, less ideal
C: more ideal, less ideal, less ideal
D: closer to being ideal, more ideal, less ideal
E: less ideal, more ideal, more ideal
F: less ideal, less ideal, less ideal
G: more ideal, more ideal, less ideal
H: less ideal, less ideal, closer to being ideal
I: more ideal, less ideal, closer to being ideal
J: closer to being ideal, less ideal, more ideal

Okay, so I've got this van der Waals equation question here. I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but let's try to think this through. The question is about how a gas's ideality changes under different conditions using the van der Waals equation. 

The equation given is [P + (a n²/V²)] (V - nb) = nRT. I remember that the a term accounts for intermolecular attractions, and the b term accounts for the volume of the gas particles themselves. So, when a gas behaves ideally, these correction terms become negligible.

The question has three parts: a, b, and c. Let's take them one by one.

Part (a): The gas is compressed at constant temperature. So, what happens when we compress the gas? The volume decreases. Let's see how that affects the van der Waals terms. 

In the pressure term, (a n²/V²), as V decreases, V² becomes smaller, so this term increases. So the pressure correction becomes more significant. But wait, in reality, when a gas is compressed, the molecules are closer together, so intermolecular forces become more important. That would make the gas less ideal. Alternatively, for the volume correction (V - nb), when V is small (compressed), the nb term is a larger fraction of V. So the volume correction also becomes more significant. Both terms are becoming more important, which would mean the gas behaves less ideally. So for part (a), the gas becomes less ideal when compressed at constant T.

Part (b): More gas is added at constant volume and temperature. Adding more gas means increasing n. Let's see how each term changes. The pressure term is (a n²/V²). If n increases and V is constant, this term increases because n is squared. So the pressure correction becomes larger, implying the gas is less ideal. Wait, but let me think again. When you add more gas molecules, the number of interactions increases, which would make the intermolecular attractions more significant. So the a term would have a bigger effect, making the gas less ideal. Alternatively, for the volume term, (V - nb), as n increases, more molecules are present, so the volume taken by the gas particles (nb) is a larger fraction of V. So that term also becomes more significant. So both a and b terms are getting larger, which means the gas is deviating more from ideal behavior, so it becomes less ideal. Hmm, wait, but the options might have more nuanced answers. Or maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me think again. If more gas is added but V is constant, the density (n/V) increases. High density usually means more pronounced intermolecular forces and volume effects, leading to non-ideal behavior. So part (b) would make the gas less ideal. Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, the van der Waals equation adjusts for these factors, so when these terms are significant, the gas is less ideal. So more n makes these terms more significant, so gas becomes less ideal. So for part (b), the answer is the gas becomes less ideal.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again. If you add more gas at the same V and T, the number of moles n increases. So in the a term, it's proportional to n², so the correction is higher. So the pressure would be higher than ideal because of the a term (since P is increased by that term). Alternatively, for the volume correction, the term (V - nb) would subtract more as n increases. So both factors imply that the gas is less ideal. So part (b) makes the gas less ideal. Wait, but wait another point: when n increases, the gas's behavior may change. But if the volume is fixed, the density (n/V) increases. At high densities, gases tend to deviate more from ideal behavior because the molecules are close together, so intermolecular forces are more significant. So yes, the gas becomes less ideal when more is added at constant V and T. So part (b) answer is less ideal.

Part (c): The temperature is raised at constant volume. So T increases, V is constant. Let's look at the van der Waals terms. The a term is a function of n² and V². Temperature affects the kinetic energy of the molecules. At higher temperatures, the kinetic energy is higher, making the molecules move faster. This can overcome the intermolecular attractions (the a term). So the effect of the a term might become less significant if T increases. Also, the volume term (b) is about the volume occupied by the gas particles. If T increases, the gas would expand if V wasn't constant. But since V is constant here, higher T might mean that the gas's kinetic energy reduces the impact of b. Alternatively, let's consider the ideal gas law. When T increases, P increases for an ideal gas. But with van der Waals, the a term adds to P, and if T is high enough, the effect of a becomes less dominant. So perhaps at higher T, the gas behaves more ideally. Because higher thermal motion would make the gas less likely to be affected by the intermolecular attractions. So part (c) would make the gas more ideal.

Wait, I should think about the van der Waals equation in terms of when the corrections are significant. High T would mean that the RT term dominates, making the other terms less significant. So yes, at higher T, the gas becomes more ideal.

Putting it all together:

(a) Compressed at constant T: less ideal.

(b) More gas added at constant V and T: less ideal.

(c) Temperature raised at constant V: more ideal.

Wait, that would give for the three parts: less, less, more. Looking at the options, which option matches that?

Looking back at the options:

Option E: less ideal, more ideal, more ideal. No.

Option C: more, less, less. No.

Option B: less, more, less. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a) or (b). Let's re-examine.

Part (a): When the gas is compressed (V decreases), the a term (n² a / V²) becomes larger because V is smaller. So the pressure correction is bigger. So the gas's actual pressure is higher than ideal, meaning more real. But for ideality, the gas is less ideal. So (a) is less ideal.

Part (b): Adding more n, so a term increases (n squared), so pressure correction is more significant. So gas is less ideal.

Part (c): Higher T, which would make the molecules move faster, making the intermolecular attractions less effective. So the a term has less impact. So the gas behaves more ideally.

So the three parts are:

(a) less ideal,

(b) less ideal,

(c) more ideal.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Let me check the options again.

Option E: less, more, more. No.

Option C: more, less, less. No.

Option B: less, more, less. No.

Option H: less, less, closer. Hmm, closer to ideal is more ideal, but H says the third part is closer, implying maybe more ideal.

Wait the options for the parts are (a), (b), (c). So in the options, each option has three parts, like option E is (a) less, (b) more, (c) more.

Wait, looking back:

The options are labeled A through J. Let me read them again.

Option A: more, less, more.

Option B: less, more, less.

Option C: more, less, less.

Option D: closer, more, less.

Option E: less, more, more.

Option F: less, less, less.

Option G: more, more, less.

Option H: less, less, closer.

Option I: more, less, closer.

Option J: closer, less, more.

Wait, so none of the options directly match less, less, more. Because in the three parts, the correct assessment would be (a) less, (b) less, (c) more. Let me see if any option matches that.

Looking at the options, option F is less, less, less. So that's not matching. Option H is less, less, closer. Closer would mean more ideal, but the option says 'closer to being ideal', which is same as more ideal. So option H is (a) less, (b) less, (c) closer (more ideal). That would fit.

Wait, but in the given options, part (c) of option H is "closer to being ideal", which is more ideal. So option H is less, less, more ideal.

But I thought part (c) is more ideal, so the three parts are less, less, more. So option H matches.

But let me double-check part (b). When more gas is added at constant V and T, so n increases. So in the van der Waals equation, the a term (n²) and the b term (n) become more significant. So both corrections are larger, making the gas less ideal. So part (b) is less ideal.

So the three parts are:

a) less ideal

b) less ideal

c) more ideal.

Looking at the options, option H is (a) less, (b) less, (c) closer (i.e., more ideal).

Wait, but the options for H are:

H: less ideal, less ideal, closer to being ideal.

Yes. So option H would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thought. I'm a bit confused because in part (c), the temperature is raised. So, for the van der Waals equation, when temperature increases, the term RT increases. So the other terms (a and b) become less significant in comparison. So the gas behaves more like an ideal gas. So part (c) is more ideal.

Therefore, the three parts are (a) less, (b) less, (c) more. So the correct option should have these three in order.

Looking again:

Option E: (a) less, (b) more, (c) more. No.

Option H: (a) less, (b) less, (c) closer (more). So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option H.

The van der Waals equation modifies the ideal gas law to account for intermolecular attractions and molecular volume. The equation is:

\[
\left(P + \frac{a n^2}{V^2}\right)(V - nb) = nRT
\]

Here, the term \(\frac{a n^2}{V^2}\) corrects the pressure for intermolecular attractions, and the term \(V - nb\) corrects the volume for molecular volume. A gas behaves more ideally when these correction terms become negligible.

### Analysis of Each Part:

1. **(a) The gas is compressed at constant temperature:**  
   When the gas is compressed, the volume \(V\) decreases. This makes the correction terms \(\frac{a n^2}{V^2}\) and \(nb\) more significant. The intermolecular attractions and molecular volume become more pronounced, causing the gas to deviate from ideal behavior. Thus, the gas becomes **less ideal**.

2. **(b) More gas is added at constant volume and temperature:**  
   Adding more gas increases the number of moles \(n\). The correction term \(\frac{a n^2}{V^2}\) grows with \(n^2\), and the term \(nb\) also increases linearly with \(n\). Both corrections become more significant, leading to greater deviation from ideal behavior. Thus, the gas becomes **less ideal**.

3. **(c) The temperature of the gas is raised at constant volume:**  
   Raising the temperature increases the kinetic energy of the gas molecules, reducing the impact of intermolecular attractions. The term \(\frac{a n^2}{V^2}\) becomes less significant as the gas's behavior is dominated by the \(nRT\) term. This makes the gas behave more like an ideal gas. Thus, the gas becomes **more ideal**.

### Evaluation of Options:
The correct sequence of changes in ideality is:  
**(a) less ideal, (b) less ideal, (c) more ideal.**

From the given options, **Option H** matches this sequence:  
- (a) less ideal  
- (b) less ideal  
- (c) closer to being ideal (i.e., more ideal).

### Final Answer:
H
