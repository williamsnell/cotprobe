Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the basilar membrane and how the position where waves peak relates to the frequency of a tone. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which theory states that the position on the basilar membrane where the wave peaks depends on the frequency. So I remember that the basilar membrane is part of the cochlea in the ear, right? And when sound waves enter, they cause the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate, which makes the basilar membrane vibrate too.

I think there are a couple of theories related to how we perceive sound. One is the place theory, and another is the frequency theory, or maybe volley theory. Let me try to recall what each of these entails.

Place theory, if I remember correctly, suggests that different frequencies cause the basilar membrane to vibrate at different locations. So higher frequencies would cause maximum vibration at a different place along the membrane compared to lower frequencies. This makes sense because the structure of the basilar membrane isn't uniform—it's stiffer and thinner at one end and thicker at the other. So each section responds best to a specific frequency. This theory would explain how we can distinguish between different pitches because each pitch corresponds to a specific location on the membrane.

Then there's the frequency theory, sometimes called the resonance theory. I think this posits that the entire basilar membrane vibrates as a whole, and the frequency of these vibrations corresponds to the frequency of the sound. So if you have a high-pitched sound, the membrane vibrates more times per second. But wait, doesn't that have a problem with higher frequencies? Because the membrane might not be able to vibrate fast enough for very high sounds. So maybe this theory works better for lower frequencies but doesn't account well for higher ones.

Oh, and there's the volley theory, which suggests that groups of nerve fibers work together to represent higher frequencies beyond what individual fibers can handle. Like, when a sound is too high for one fiber to keep up, multiple fibers take turns firing to represent the frequency. So this theory complements the place theory for higher frequencies.

Looking back at the question, it's specifically about the position on the basilar membrane depending on frequency. That sounds exactly like what the place theory explains. So the correct answer should be the theory that links the location of maximum vibration to the frequency.

Looking at the options:

A: frequency theory — that's the one where the entire membrane vibrates at the same frequency. Doesn't explain different positions.

I: place — this should be the one where different places correspond to different frequencies.

So the answer must be option I.

The question asks which theory explains that the position on the basilar membrane where waves peak depends on the frequency of a tone. The basilar membrane's structure varies in thickness and stiffness, causing different sections to vibrate maximally at different frequencies. This is best explained by **place theory**, which states that the location of maximum vibration along the membrane corresponds to the specific frequency of the sound. Other theories, like frequency theory, focus on the entire membrane vibrating at the sound's frequency, which does not explain the positional aspect. Volley theory deals with how groups of nerve fibers handle high frequencies but does not address the positional dependence. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: place

Answer: I
