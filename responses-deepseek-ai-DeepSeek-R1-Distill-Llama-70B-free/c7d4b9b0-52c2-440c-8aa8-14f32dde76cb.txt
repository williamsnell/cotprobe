Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out how much I can pay for a machine. The machine gives an annual return of $1,000 each year for 20 years, but the return is received uniformly and continuously. I need to find the maximum amount I can pay for it while still getting at least a 10% effective annual return on my investment.

Hmm, I remember that when cash flows are continuous, we use the concept of the present value of a continuous income stream. Oh right, that's the present value of a perpetuity or an annuity due, but here it's over a finite period. So I think the formula for the present value when the return is continuous is different from the regular present value of an annuity.

Wait, the standard present value of an annuity formula is PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]. But that's for discrete payments, like once a year. Since this is continuous, maybe I need to use integration or a different formula. Oh, right, the present value for a continuous income stream is calculated using the formula for the present value of an annuity due in continuous time, which I think is PV = A * (1 - e^(-rt)) / r, where A is the annual payment rate, r is the discount rate, and t is the time in years.

In this case, the annual return is $1,000, received continuously over 20 years. So A is $1,000 per year, r is 10% or 0.10, and t is 20. So plugging into the formula, PV = 1000 * (1 - e^(-0.10 * 20)) / 0.10.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. First, calculate the exponent: 0.10 * 20 = 2. So e^-2 is approximately... I remember e^2 is about 7.389, so e^-2 is 1/7.389 ≈ 0.1353. So 1 - 0.1353 is 0.8647. Then, 0.8647 divided by 0.10 is 8.647. Multiply by 1000 gives 8647. So around $8,647.

Looking at the options, option C is $8,514 and option D is $10,000. Hmm, my calculation gives about $8,647, which is close to option C, but not exactly the same. Maybe I was a bit off in the approximation of e^-2. Let me check that more accurately.

Wait, e^-2 is about 0.135335. So 1 - 0.135335 is 0.864665. Dividing by 0.10 gives 8.64665. Multiply by 1000 is $8,646.65. So approximately $8,647. The closest option is C: $8,514. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the present value formula for an ordinary annuity with discrete payments and I should adjust. Wait no, the question says the return is received uniformly and continuously, so the continuous formula is correct.

But in my calculation, I get around $8,647, which isn't exactly one of the options. Let me see the options again. Option C is $8,514, which is a bit lower. Maybe I should recalculate with more precise exponent value.

Wait, e^-2 is about 0.135335, so 1 - e^-2 = 0.864665. So 0.864665 * 1000 / 0.10 = 8646.65. So that's approximately $8,646.65. So the closest option would be C: $8,514, but wait, that's not so close. Alternatively, maybe I should consider using the present value of a continuous annuity formula correctly.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the correct formula is A * (1 - e^(-rt)) / (r). So yes, that's what I did. So perhaps the options have a rounded value. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the present value of a continuous annuity:

PV = (A / r) * (1 - e^(-rt)).

Yes, that's the same as I did. So with A=1000, r=0.10, t=20.

So (1000 / 0.1) = 10,000. (1 - e^-2) is about 0.864665. So 10,000 * 0.864665 = 8,646.65. So around 8,646.65.

Looking at the options, option C is 8,514, which is less. None of the options exactly match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the use of the present value of an annuity formula with discrete payments. Let me try that. The formula is PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r].

So PMT is $1,000 per year, r=0.10, n=20.

So (1 - (1.10)^-20 ) / 0.10.

Compute (1.10)^-20: 1/(1.10)^20. Let me calculate 1.1^20. 1.1^20 is approximately 6.7275. So (1.1)^-20 is about 0.14864. So 1 - 0.14864 = 0.85136. Divided by 0.10 is 8.5136. Multiply by 1000 gives 8,513.60. So that's around $8,513.60. Which matches option C: $8,514.

Wait, so the correct approach is to use discrete payments, because the question says the return is received uniformly and continuously, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. No, wait, wait, if it's received continuously, then the correct approach is to use the continuous formula, which gives around $8,646. But the options don't have that. So why is the discrete approach giving an option that's present?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. It says the return is received uniformly and continuously over the years. So that implies that it's a continuous cash flow, so the correct formula is the continuous one, which gives me ~$8,646, but that's not an option. So perhaps the options are rounded, but the closest is C: $8,514.

Wait another thought: maybe the question is using the discrete formula. Because sometimes, even when it's continuous, the multiple-choice options might be based on the discrete formula. Alternatively, perhaps the effective annual rate (EAR) is being considered. Wait, no, the interest rate given is 10% effective annual, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the continuous calculation. Let me recalculate.

In the continuous case:

PV = A * (1 - e^(-rt)) / r.

A is $1000/year, r=0.10, t=20.

So PV = 1000*(1 - e^(-2)) / 0.10.

1 - e^-2 ≈ 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647.

So 0.8647 / 0.10 = 8.647.

Multiply by 1000 gives 8647.

But the options don't have 8647. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for a 10% return, implying that the interest rate is 10%, so the present value factor is calculated correctly. So with the continuous approach, I get ~$8,647. But the closest option is C: $8,514.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the use of the discrete formula but with more precise calculations. Let me compute the discrete formula again.

PMT = 1000, r=0.10, n=20.

PV = 1000 * [1 - (1.10)^-20 ] / 0.10.

(1.10)^-20 = 1 / (1.10)^20.

1.1^20: Let me compute it accurately.

1.1^1 = 1.1

^2 = 1.21

^3 = 1.331

^4 ≈ 1.4641

^5 ≈ 1.6105

^6 ≈ 1.7716

^7 ≈ 1.9487

^8 ≈ 2.1436

^9 ≈ 2.3579

^10 ≈ 2.5937

^11 ≈ 2.8531

^12 ≈ 3.1383

^13 ≈ 3.4523

^14 ≈ 3.7975

^15 ≈ 4.1772

^16 ≈ 4.5940

^17 ≈ 5.0504

^18 ≈ 5.5591

^19 ≈ 6.1162

^20 ≈ 6.7275.

So (1.1)^20 ≈ 6.7275.

Thus, (1.1)^-20 ≈ 0.14864.

So 1 - 0.14864 = 0.85136.

Divide by 0.10: 8.5136.

Multiply by 1000: 8513.6, which is $8,513.60, so option C is $8,514.

Wait, so using the discrete formula gives approximately $8,514, which is option C. But the question states that the return is continuous. So why am I getting this discrepancy?

Maybe the question is using a different approach, or perhaps the options are based on the discrete formula. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the continuous formula but with the understanding that the options are rounded. Wait, in that case, my continuous calculation gave ~8,646, but that's not an option. The closest is option C, but it's significantly lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me double-check the continuous formula.

Yes, the formula for the present value of a continuous annuity is indeed PV = (A/r) * (1 - e^(-rt)). So plugging the values again: A=1000, r=0.10, t=20.

So (1000/0.10) = 10,000. (1 - e^-2) ≈ 0.8646647. So 10,000 * 0.8646647 ≈ 8,646.65, which is approximately $8,647.

Hmm, but none of the options is that. So perhaps the intended approach was the discrete formula, which gives option C. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo or expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a continuous return, but that the payments are at the end of each period, making it a discrete annuity. But the question clearly states the return is received uniformly and continuously. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective annual rate is 10%, but the continuous formula uses the nominal rate. Wait, no, EAR and continuous compounding are related. If the effective annual rate is 10%, the nominal rate for continuous compounding would be lower, but I think the question is just using the EAR as the rate in the formula. So perhaps the 10% is the EAR, so using it directly in the continuous formula is correct.

Wait, maybe I should use a different formula, like the present value of a perpetuity with continuous cash flows. But no, it's for 20 years.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to use the discrete formula, and the continuous part is a red herring. Because otherwise, the correct answer isn't among the options.

But in the options given, option C is $8,514, which matches the discrete calculation. So perhaps the intended answer is C, assuming the discrete annuity formula.

Wait, but the question specifically says the return is continuous. So why would the answer be based on the discrete formula?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the return being received uniformly at the end of each year, which would make it discrete. But the question says "continuously over the years," which suggests continuous.

This is confusing. But considering the options, option C is the result of the discrete calculation, which is one of the options. Since the continuous approach doesn't yield an option, perhaps the intended approach was the discrete method.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding of continuous cash flows, so the correct answer should be around $8,647, but since it's not an option, I'm stuck.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is $8,514, which is very close to the discrete calculation. So perhaps the intended answer is C, and the question assumes discrete payments despite the wording.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the continuous formula again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me compute e^-2 more accurately. Using a calculator, e^2 is approximately 7.38905609893. So e^-2 is 1/7.38905609893 ≈ 0.1353352832.

So 1 - 0.1353352832 = 0.8646647168.

Divide by 0.10 gives 8.646647168.

Multiply by 1000 gives 8,646.65. So that's approximately $8,646.65.

Looking at the options, none of them match this. So perhaps the intended answer is C, $8,514, using the discrete formula, despite the continuous description.

Alternatively, maybe the question intended to say that the payments are received at the end of each year, making it discrete. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the continuous formula, and $8,514 is the correct answer when using a slightly different approximation. Let me see: perhaps using a different value for e^-2.

Wait, maybe the value used in the calculation was e^-2 ≈ 0.1353, leading to 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647. Then 0.8647 / 0.10 is 8.647, which multiplied by 1000 is 8,647. But perhaps the options rounded it to $8,514, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question uses a different compounding method. For example, if the interest is compounded annually but the cash flows are continuous, perhaps the formula is adjusted. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the future value and then discounting. No, that wouldn't make sense here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the intended approach is indeed the discrete formula, leading to option C. Since that's an option, perhaps that's the intended answer.

So, given that the discrete formula gives $8,514, which is option C, I think that's the intended correct answer, despite the question stating continuous returns. Maybe the question had a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the application.

In conclusion, I'll go with option C: $8,514.

To determine how much can be paid for the machine while obtaining at least a 10% effective annual return, the problem involves calculating the present value of a continuous income stream. The machine provides a uniform and continuous annual return of $1,000 for 20 years, and the effective annual interest rate is 10%. 

The formula for the present value of a continuous income stream is:

\[
PV = \frac{A}{r} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-rt}\right)
\]

Where:
- \(A = 1000\) (annual return rate, in dollars per year),
- \(r = 0.10\) (effective annual interest rate),
- \(t = 20\) (time in years).

### Step 1: Calculate \(e^{-rt}\)
\[
rt = 0.10 \cdot 20 = 2
\]
\[
e^{-2} \approx 0.1353
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(1 - e^{-rt}\)
\[
1 - e^{-2} = 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the present value
\[
PV = \frac{1000}{0.10} \cdot 0.8647 = 10,000 \cdot 0.8647 = 8,647
\]

This calculation gives a present value of approximately $8,647. However, none of the provided options match this value exactly.

### Discrete Payment Formula
The problem specifies continuous cash flows, but the closest option ($8,514) aligns with the present value of a discrete annuity. Using the discrete annuity formula:

\[
PV = PMT \cdot \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Where:
- \(PMT = 1000\) (annual payment),
- \(r = 0.10\) (interest rate),
- \(n = 20\) (number of years).

### Step 1: Calculate \((1 + r)^{-n}\)
\[
(1 + 0.10)^{-20} = \frac{1}{(1.10)^{20}} \approx 0.1486
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(1 - (1 + r)^{-n}\)
\[
1 - 0.1486 = 0.8514
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the present value
\[
PV = 1000 \cdot \frac{0.8514}{0.10} = 1000 \cdot 8.514 = 8,514
\]

This matches option **C: $8,514**. Despite the continuous cash flow description, the closest answer based on the options appears to assume discrete payments.

### Conclusion
While the continuous formula gives $8,647, the discrete formula yields $8,514, which is one of the provided options. Therefore, the intended answer is likely **C: $8,514**.
