Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a salesman's commission. Let's see what it's asking. The salesman works for Fabulous Footwear Co. and gets a 1.5% commission on all his sales. The question is, how much would he make in a month where he sold $54,600 worth of shoes? The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, commission calculations. I remember that commission is a percentage of the sales made. So if someone sells a certain amount, their commission is that percentage of the total sales. In this case, 1.5% of $54,600.

Wait, I should break it down. To find 1.5% of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. So 1.5% is 0.015. Then multiply that by the total sales.

So the calculation would be 0.015 * 54,600. Let me do that step by step. Maybe I can simplify it. 1% of 54,600 is 546. So 0.5% would be half of that, which is 273. So 1% is 546, 0.5% is 273. Adding them together for 1.5%, that would be 546 + 273 = 819. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, I can calculate 54,600 times 0.015. Let's see, 54,600 divided by 100 is 546, then multiply by 15. Wait, 546 * 15. Oh wait, that's not right. Wait, 1.5% is 15/1000, so 54,600 * (15/1000). Hmm, maybe that's a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 54,600 * 0.01 is 546, and 0.005 * 54,600 is 273. So adding those gives 819. So the commission is $819.

Looking at the options, option I is $819. Oh wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 54,600 * 1.5% another way. 

Wait, 1% is 546, so 1.5% is 1% plus half a percent. Half a percent would be 273, so adding 546 + 273 gives 819. That seems right. 

So the correct answer should be option I, which is $819. Let me just check the options again. Option I is $819, yes. So that's the one.
