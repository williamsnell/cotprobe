Question:

On December 30, a restaurant entered into a written contract with a bakery to supply the restaurant with all of its bread needs for the next calendar year. The contract contained a provision wherein the restaurant promised to purchase "a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 per loaf. " On a separate sheet, there was a note stating that any modifications must be in writing. The parties signed each sheet. Both sides performed fully under the contract for the first four months. On May 1, the president of the bakery telephoned the manager of the restaurant and told him that, because of an increase in the cost of wheat, the bakery would be forced to raise its prices to $1. 20 per loaf. The manager said he understood and agreed to the price increase. The bakery then shipped 100 loaves (the amount ordered by the restaurant) to the restaurant, along with a bill for $120. The restaurant sent the bakery a check for$100 and refused to pay any more. Is the restaurant obligated to pay the additional $20?

Options:

A: Yes, because the May 1 modification was enforceable even though it was not supported by new consideration.
B: No, because the bakery failed to provide written notice of the price increase as stipulated in the original contract.
C: No, because the price increase was due to external factors and not a decision by the bakery.
D: Yes, because the bakery detrimentally relied on the modification by making the May shipment to the restaurant.
E: No, because the original contract did not specify a price adjustment clause.
F: No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.
G: Yes, because the restaurant was aware of the price increase before the delivery was made.
H: No, because there was no consideration to support the modification.
I: Yes, because the restaurant manager verbally agreed to the price increase.
J: Yes, because the price increase is minimal and doesn't significantly affect the restaurant's expenses.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

Alright, the situation is about a restaurant and a bakery that have a written contract. The contract says the restaurant will buy a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 each. There's also a note that any modifications must be in writing, and both parties signed each sheet. So, the contract has a written modification clause.

For the first four months, both parties performed as agreed. Then on May 1, the bakery's president called the restaurant manager. The bakery says they're increasing the price to $1.20 because of higher wheat costs. The manager agreed over the phone. Then the bakery shipped 100 loaves and billed $120. The restaurant only paid $100 and refused to pay the extra $20. The question is whether the restaurant is obligated to pay the additional $20.

Hmm, so the main issue here is about contract modification. Under the UCC, which governs sales contracts like this, modifications can sometimes be enforceable even without consideration, especially under UCC § 2-209. Wait, but the original contract here requires any modifications to be in writing, so that's a written modification clause.

So, under UCC § 2-209(2), a signed agreement that a contract cannot be modified except by a signed writing can't be otherwise modified, but except as between merchants, such a clause is not necessarily effective. But wait, the restaurant and bakery are both businesses, so they're merchants. So, the clause requiring written modifications is enforceable. That means any changes must be in writing.

In this case, the modification was oral. The manager agreed over the phone. So, the price increase wasn't in writing as required by the contract. Therefore, under the contract's terms, the modification isn't valid unless it's in writing.

But wait, I remember that UCC § 2-209(4) says that although an attempt at modification which does not satisfy the writing requirement doesn't invalidate the existing contract, it can still operate as a waiver. But here, the question is about a modification, not a waiver. So, if the modification isn't in writing, it's not enforceable. Therefore, the bakery can't enforce the higher price.

Looking at the options:

Option B says no because the bakery didn't provide written notice as stipulated. That seems correct because the contract required modifications in writing.

Option F says no because the modifying contract wasn't in writing under UCC, which is also correct. But wait, I think the issue here is more about the contract's own requirement than the UCC's writing requirements. The contract itself said modifications must be in writing, so that's a clause that binds them. So, even if under UCC a modification without consideration might sometimes be allowed, the contract's terms require writing. So, the oral modification is unenforceable.

Option H says no because there was no consideration. But under UCC §2-209(1), a modification can be made without additional consideration. So, H isn't the right reason here.

So, the main reason is that the modification wasn't in writing as per the contract. So, the answer should be either B or F.

Wait, option B says because the bakery failed to provide written notice. But the contract requires that modifications be in writing, not just notice. So, the modification itself needs to be in writing. So, the price increase wasn't in writing, so it's unenforceable.

Option F says the modifying contract wasn't in writing, making it unenforceable under UCC. But UCC doesn't generally require modifications to be in writing unless the contract itself does, which it does here. So, F is correct in the sense that the modification wasn't in writing, but it's because of the contract's clause, not a general UCC rule.

Hmm, so the correct reasoning is that the contract's own terms require modifications in writing, and the oral agreement doesn't suffice. So, looking at the options, B and F are both about writing. Let me check the options again.

Option F says modifying contract wasn't in writing, so unenforceable under UCC. But the UCC doesn't require modifications to be in writing unless the contract specifies it. So, the reason is the contract's own clause, making F correct because the contract required it, which is part of the UCC's rules. Alternatively, option B is about failing to provide written notice as stipulated. But the contract didn't require notice, it required that modifications be in writing.

So, the correct reason is that the modification wasn't in writing as per the contract's terms. So, F is the correct answer because the modifying agreement wasn't in writing, making it unenforceable under UCC, considering the contract's clause.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The contract's clause is part of the UCC because the contract is under UCC as a sale of goods. So, the clause requiring written modifications is valid between merchants, and thus the oral modification is unenforceable. So, F is correct.

The question revolves around whether the restaurant is obligated to pay the additional $20 for the price increase, given that the original contract required any modifications to be in writing. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), contracts for the sale of goods can include clauses requiring modifications to be in writing. In this case, the contract explicitly stated that any modifications must be in writing, and both parties signed this provision. 

When the bakery attempted to modify the contract orally by increasing the price, this did not satisfy the written modification requirement. Under UCC § 2-209, such a clause between merchants is enforceable, meaning the oral agreement to the price increase is unenforceable. While UCC § 2-209(1) allows modifications without additional consideration, the contract's specific requirement for written modifications takes precedence here. Therefore, the oral modification is invalid, and the restaurant is not obligated to pay the additional $20.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B**: Incorrect. The issue is not about providing written notice but ensuring the modification itself is in writing.
- **Option F**: Correct. The modification was not in writing as required by the contract, making it unenforceable under the UCC.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.**

Answer: F
