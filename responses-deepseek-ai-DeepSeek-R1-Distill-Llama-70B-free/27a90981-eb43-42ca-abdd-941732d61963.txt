Alright, so I've got this question about oral bacteria and what they use to make extracellular glucans. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question is asking which dietary component from the host is used by oral bacteria to synthesize glucans like dextran and mutan. I remember that glucans are polysaccharides, right? And they're part of the extracellular matrix in dental plaque.

Wait, I think bacteria in the mouth, like Streptococcus mutans, produce these glucans. They use enzymes called glucosyltransferases to make them. But what's the substrate they use? I recall that sucrose is a key player here. Because sucrose is a disaccharide made of glucose and fructose.

Oh right! Sucrose is the main dietary source for this. When the bacteria break down sucrose, they use the glucose part to build these glucans. Dextran is typically from sucrose, and mutan is another type, but I think both are synthesized using sucrose as the starting point. 

So looking at the options, option C is sucrose. Let me just make sure I'm not mixing things up. Starch is a polysaccharide, but that's more from plants and needs amylase to break down. Maltose is a breakdown product of starch, but I don't think bacteria use that as the primary source. Glycogen is an animal starch, but I don't think that's the main one here either. Fructose is a monosaccharide, but on its own, I don't think it's used for glucans. Glucose is another monosaccharide, but I believe it's the other part of sucrose that's used, not the primary source.

So yes, the correct answer should be C: Sucrose.

The oral bacteria synthesize extracellular glucans, such as dextran and mutan, using sucrose as the primary dietary component. Sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose, is broken down by bacterial enzymes like glucosyltransferases to produce these glucans. While other options like starch, maltose, and glucose are related to carbohydrate metabolism, sucrose is specifically utilized for this process. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: Sucrose

Answer: C
