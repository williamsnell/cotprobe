Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about naming an organic compound based on its structure. The compound given is CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I think I should figure out the parent chain. The formula looks like it's a five-carbon chain because I count five carbons in a row. Let me write that out: CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So that's five carbons, which makes it a pentane derivative.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the longest chain can be tricky. Let me make sure there's no longer chain possible. If I look at the structure, I don't think there's a longer chain—like if I rotate or something. No, I think five is the max here, so pentane is the parent.

Now, the substituents. I see a Br and a Cl attached. Let's find their positions. Starting from the left end (CH3), the first carbon is CH3, the second is CHBr, so that's carbon 2. The third is CHCl, so that's carbon 3. So the Br is on carbon 2 and Cl on carbon 3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait! I've got to number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So if I number from the left, the positions are 2 and 3. But if I number from the right, maybe the positions would be different. Let me check that possibility.

The right end is CH2CH3. So the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CHBr-

Carbon 3: CHCl-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, no. Wait, when you have substituents, you number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So what's lower, 2 and 3, or if we number from the other end, 3 and 4?

Wait, if I reverse the chain, the Br would be on carbon 4, and the Cl on carbon 3. Because let's see:

Starting from the right (CH2CH3), that would be carbon 5. Wait, no, wait. Let me number correctly.

Wait, if I reverse the chain, the substituents would be on carbons 3 and 4. For example, the original chain is 1-2-3-4-5:

1: CH3-

2: CHBr-

3: CHCl-

4: CH2-

5: CH3

If I reverse it, the substituents would be on 3 and 4.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are on 2 and 3 when numbered from the left. When reversed, the positions become 3 and 4. Do I have a choice between which direction gives lower numbers?

The goal is to have the substituents' numbers as low as possible. So between 2 and 3 vs 3 and 4, 2 and 3 are lower. So the correct numbering is 2 and 3.

So the substituents are on carbons 2 and 3. So that would make the compound 2-bromo and 3-chloro.

Wait, but wait—wait, when we have multiple substituents, the numbering should be such that the sum of the numbers is minimized. So 2 and 3 sum to 5. If I number from the other end, 3 and 4 sum to 7, which is higher, so definitely 2 and 3 is better.

Now, the substituents are Br and Cl. So the name would be something like 2-bromo-3-chloropentane. Wait, but what's the order of substituents in the name? I think you list them alphabetically, regardless of their position numbers. So Br comes after Cl alphabetically, so the Cl would come first in the name.

Wait, wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So for example, bromo comes after chloro. So the correct order would be chloro first, then bromo. So the name would be 2-chloro-3-bromopentane, or wait, no, because the positions are 2 and 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents are Br on 2 and Cl on 3. So when you write the name, you list them alphabetically. So which comes first, bromo or chloro?

Chloro starts with 'c', bromo with 'b'. Oh wait no, wait. Wait, 'bromo' starts with 'b', 'chloro' with 'c'. So 'bromo' comes before 'chloro' alphabetically. So when writing the name, you'd say 3-chloro-2-bromopentane? No, wait, because the substituents are on 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The substituents are on carbons 2 and 3. So the numbering is correct as 2 and 3.

So the full name would be 2-bromo-3-chloropentane. Alternatively, 3-chloro-2-bromopentane. But according to IUPAC rules, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so 'bromo' comes before 'chloro', so the correct order is bromo first.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Let me double-check. Alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name as a prefix. Bromo (Br) comes before chloro (Cl) because 'b' comes before 'c' in the alphabet. So in the name, bromo comes first.

So the substituents would be listed as bromo first, then chloro. So the name would be 2-bromo-3-chloropentane.

Now, looking at the options given:

Option B: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane.

Option E: 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane.

Option H: 3-bromo, 2-chloropentane.

Hmm, so option B is 2-bromo-3-chloropentane. Option E is the reverse. Option H is 3-bromo-2-chloro.

Wait, but wait, in the IUPAC name, when you have two substituents, you number the chain so that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers, which we've done (2 and 3). Then, you list the substituents in alphabetical order, which is bromo before chloro. So the correct name is 2-bromo-3-chloropentane.

Looking back at the options, option B is exactly that: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the parent chain is pentane, so the substituents are on carbons 2 and 3. So the correct IUPAC name is 2-bromo-3-chloropentane.

So the correct answer should be option B or E? Wait, no, option B is 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane. Option E is 2-chloro, 3-bromo. So the correct one is B.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 2-bromo,3-chloropropane. No, because it's a five-carbon chain, so propane is wrong.

Option C: 2,3-dibromochloropentane. No, because there's only one Br and one Cl.

Option D: trichlorodibromopentane. That would imply three Cl and two Br, but we only have one each.

Option E: 2-chloro,3-bromopentane. That's the reverse substituent order.

Option F: 2,3-chlorobromopentane. That would imply both on same carbon, which is not the case.

Option G: 2,3-bromochloropentane. Same as F, wrong.

Option H:3-bromo,2-chloropentane. That would imply Br on 3, Cl on 2, but we have Br on 2, Cl on 3.

So H is 3-bromo-2-chloro, which is different from our compound.

So the correct option is B: 2-bromo,3-chloropentane.

The compound given is **CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3**, and the goal is to determine its correct IUPAC name. Here's the analysis:

1. **Identify the parent chain**: The longest continuous carbon chain is five carbons long, making the parent chain **pentane**.

2. **Locate the substituents**: The molecule has two substituents:
   - A **bromo (Br)** group on carbon 2.
   - A **chloro (Cl)** group on carbon 3.

3. **Number the chain**: To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, the chain is numbered from the left. This places the bromo group on carbon 2 and the chloro group on carbon 3.

4. **Order of substituents in the name**: Substituents are listed alphabetically, regardless of their position. Since "bromo" (B) comes before "chloro" (C) alphabetically, bromo is listed first.

5. **Combine the name**: The correct IUPAC name is **2-bromo-3-chloropentane**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The parent chain is pentane, not propane.
- **B**: Correct. Matches the derived name **2-bromo-3-chloropentane**.
- **C**: Incorrect. The compound does not have two bromo groups.
- **D**: Incorrect. The compound does not have three chloro and two bromo groups.
- **E**: Incorrect. The substituents are listed in the wrong order (chloro before bromo).
- **F**: Incorrect. The substituents are on different carbons, not the same carbon.
- **G**: Incorrect. The substituents are on different carbons, not the same carbon.
- **H**: Incorrect. The positions of the substituents are reversed.
- **I**: Incorrect. The compound does not have three chloro and two bromo groups.
- **J**: Incorrect. The parent chain is pentane, not propane.

The correct answer is **B: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane**.
