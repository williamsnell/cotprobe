Okay, let's try to figure out the center of mass of a uniformly solid cone. So, the question gives me a cone with a base diameter of 2a and height h. I remember that for uniform objects, the center of mass is usually along the central axis, so I only need to find the height from the base where it's located.

Wait, what do I know about the center of mass of a cone? I think it's not at the midpoint. I recall that for a solid cone, the center of mass isn't halfway up the height. Maybe it's a third of something? Let me think.

Oh right, I remember that for a solid cone, the center of mass is located at a distance of one-fourth the height from the base. Or wait, no—is it one-fourth or one-third? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to visualize it.

If I consider the cone as a stack of infinitesimally thin circular disks, each disk having a certain radius and thickness. The center of mass would be the weighted average of the positions of all these disks.

Each disk at a height y from the base has a radius r. Since the cone tapers, the radius changes with height. The radius at height y would be proportional to the distance from the tip. Wait, actually, when y is measured from the base, the radius r decreases as we go up. So at the base (y=0), the radius is a, because the diameter is 2a. At the tip (y=h), the radius is 0.

So the radius as a function of y would be r(y) = a * (1 - y/h). Wait, no, because when y=0, r is a, and when y=h, r is 0. So yes, r(y) = a (1 - y/h).

The volume of a thin disk at height y would be the area times thickness. The area is πr², so the volume dV is π [a (1 - y/h)]² dy. The mass is proportional to the volume since it's uniform, so m = density * dV. But since we're finding the center of mass, the density cancels out, so I can just integrate y times dV.

The center of mass y_cm is (1/V) ∫ y dV from y=0 to y=h.

First, compute V, the total volume. The volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h. Here, r is a, so V = (1/3)πa²h.

Now, the integral ∫ y dV becomes ∫ (from 0 to h) y * π [a² (1 - y/h)²] dy.

Wait, let me write that correctly. Since r(y) = a (1 - y/h), then r² = a² (1 - y/h)^2. So dV = π a² (1 - y/h)^2 dy.

So the integral becomes π a² ∫ (from 0 to h) y (1 - 2y/h + y²/h²) dy.

Expanding that, the integral becomes:

∫ y [1 - 2y/h + y²/h²] dy = ∫ [y - 2y²/h + y³/h²] dy.

Integrate term by term:

∫ y dy = (1/2) y²,

∫ (2y²/h) dy = 2/h * (y³/3) = (2 y³)/(3h),

∫ (y³/h²) dy = (y^4)/(4 h²).

Putting it all together, evaluating from 0 to h:

At y=h:

(1/2) h² - (2/3 h^3)/h + (h^4)/(4 h²) = (1/2 h²) - (2/3 h²) + (h²/4).

Wait, let's compute each term:

Term 1 at h: (1/2) h².

Term 2: 2/h * (h^3 /3) )= 2/3 h². But since it's subtracting, it's -2/3 h².

Term 3: (h^4)/(4 h²) = h²/4.

So adding all terms: (1/2 h²) - (2/3 h²) + (1/4 h²).

Let's get a common denominator, which is 12.

Convert each term:

1/2 = 6/12,

2/3 = 8/12,

1/4 = 3/12.

So:

6/12 h² - 8/12 h² + 3/12 h² = (6 -8 +3)/12 h² = 1/12 h².

So the integral ∫ y dV becomes π a² * (1/12 h²) ) = π a² h² / 12.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me double-check the integral.

Wait, no, the integral ∫ y dV is:

π a² ∫ (from 0 to h) y (1 - y/h)^2 dy.

I expanded (1 - y/h)^2 correctly as 1 - 2y/h + y²/h².

So the integral becomes π a² [ ∫ y dy - (2/h) ∫ y² dy + (1/h²) ∫ y^3 dy ] from 0 to h.

Compute each integral:

∫ y dy from 0 to h is (1/2 h²).

∫ y² dy is (1/3 h^3).

∫ y^3 dy is (1/4 h^4).

Thus,

= π a² [ (1/2 h²) - (2/h)(1/3 h^3) + (1/h²)(1/4 h^4) ) ]

Simplify each term:

= π a² [ (1/2 h²) - (2/3 h²) + (1/4 h²) ) ]

So factor out h²:

= π a² h² [ (1/2) - (2/3) + (1/4) ]

Compute the coefficients:

1/2 = 6/12,

2/3 = 8/12,

1/4 = 3/12.

So,

6/12 - 8/12 + 3/12 = (6 -8 +3)/12 = 1/12.

Thus, the integral is π a² h² * (1/12) ) = (π a² h² ) / 12.

Now, the center of mass y_cm is (1/V) * this integral.

V is (1/3) π a² h.

So,

y_cm = [ (π a² h² / 12) ] / [ (1/3) π a² h ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Cancel π a² from numerator and denominator.

Thus,

= (h² /12 ) / ( (1/3) h )

= ( h² /12 ) * (3 / h )

= (3 h²) / (12 h )

Simplify:

= (h) /4.

So y_cm is h/4 from the base. Wait, but wait, I thought it was h/4, but I've heard somewhere that it's h/3... Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered measuring y from the tip instead of the base. Oh wait, no, in the calculation, y is measured from the base. So the center of mass is at h/4 above the base.

Wait, but wait, another approach: using the formula for center of mass of a solid cone. I'm a bit shaky on this. Let me think.

I remember that the center of mass of a solid cone is at 1/4 of its height from the base. So that would make the answer (1/4)h, which is option A.

Wait, but wait again. Another thought: maybe I confused it with the center of mass of a hemispherical shell. No, that's different. For a solid cone, it's definitely h/4 from the base.

Wait, let me verify with another approach. The formula for the center of mass of a solid cone is (3h/4) from the tip, which would be h/4 from the base. Yes, that makes sense.

So the answer should be A: 1/4 h.

To determine the center of mass of a uniformly solid cone with base diameter \(2a\) and height \(h\), we start by noting that the center of mass lies along the central axis of the cone. For a uniform solid cone, the center of mass is located at a distance of \(\frac{1}{4}h\) from the base.

This result can be derived by considering the cone as a stack of infinitesimally thin circular disks, each with a radius that decreases linearly from \(a\) at the base to \(0\) at the tip. The radius at a height \(y\) from the base is given by \(r(y) = a \left(1 - \frac{y}{h}\right)\). The volume of each disk is proportional to its area, \(\pi r^2\), and its thickness, \(dy\). The center of mass is then calculated as the weighted average of the positions of these disks.

The total volume of the cone is:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi a^2 h.
\]

The integral for the center of mass is:

\[
y_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{V} \int_0^h y \cdot \pi \left[a \left(1 - \frac{y}{h}\right)\right]^2 dy.
\]

Expanding and simplifying the integral, the center of mass is found to be:

\[
y_{\text{cm}} = \frac{h}{4}.
\]

Thus, the center of mass of the cone is located at \(\frac{1}{4}h\) from the base. This matches option A.
