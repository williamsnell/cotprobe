Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about research findings on women who have had abortions. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what research indicates about the effects of abortion on women. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll go through each option one by one to evaluate them.

Option A: "most women regret their decision immediately after the procedure." I remember reading that most women actually feel relief after an abortion, not regret. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: "the experience frequently has serious psychological consequences, usually in the form of guilt and depression." I've heard conflicting things on this. Some studies say there's no long-term psychological harm, while others suggest some women do experience guilt or depression. But the word "frequently" here might not be accurate. I'll keep this in mind but not settle on it yet.

Option C: "women who have abortions are more likely to have difficulty conceiving in the future." I think this is more related to medical procedures and complications. If the abortion is done safely, it shouldn't affect future fertility. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: "the experience often leads to long-term physical health issues." Similar to C, if the procedure is safe, physical issues are rare. D doesn't seem right.

Option E: "the psychological consequences are no worse than they are for women who have chosen to continue their pregnancies and give birth." This sounds plausible. I recall that some studies suggest the mental health outcomes are comparable, and giving birth can also have its own stressors. So E might be correct.

Option F: "most women who have abortions think no more about the event than they would about having a wisdom tooth removed." That seems a bit dismissive. While some women might feel that way, I don't think it's the majority. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: "subsequent problems in sexual adjustment and in relationships with men are common." I haven't heard that as a common outcome. It might happen for some, but not commonly enough to be a general statement. So G is likely not the answer.

Option H: "women who have abortions are less likely to want children in the future." I don't think that's true. Many women who have abortions do go on to have children later. So H is incorrect.

Option I: "the majority of women experience severe post-traumatic stress disorder." That seems too extreme. While some may experience stress, it's not the majority. So I is wrong.

Option J: "most women who have abortions suffer from severe depression and anxiety for years afterward." Again, this seems overstated. Most studies don't support such long-term severe mental health issues for the majority. So J is incorrect.

Now, focusing back on options B and E. I think B says "frequently" have serious psychological consequences, but I remember reading that major psychological issues are not common. More common is a range of emotions, but not frequently serious. So B might not be accurate. On the other hand, E says the consequences are no worse than for those who give birth. That sounds right because both experiences can have their own stressors, and studies often show that the mental health impacts are comparable.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is E.

The correct answer is E. Research indicates that the psychological consequences of abortion are no worse than those experienced by women who continue their pregnancies and give birth. Both groups may face emotional challenges, but there is no evidence that abortion leads to more severe or frequent psychological issues compared to carrying a pregnancy to term.

Answer: E
