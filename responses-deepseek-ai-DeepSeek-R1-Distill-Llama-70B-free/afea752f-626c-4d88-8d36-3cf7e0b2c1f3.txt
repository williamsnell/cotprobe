Okay, so I've got this problem about electrochemistry, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm, a current of 5.36 A is passed for 30 minutes through an electrolytic cell containing a zinc salt solution. They found that 3.27 grams of zinc metal was deposited at the cathode. The question is asking for the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt. 

Wait, right, equivalent weight... I remember that equivalent weight is the molar mass divided by the valency, or the number of electrons transferred per atom. So for metals, it's like each equivalent is one mole of electrons. 

First, I think I should calculate the amount of charge that passed through the solution. Charge Q is equal to current I multiplied by time t. Oh wait, but time is in minutes, so I need to convert that to seconds because the unit of current is in amperes, which is coulombs per second. 

So, 30 minutes is 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds. Then Q = I * t = 5.36 A * 1800 s = let me calculate that. 5 times 1800 is 9000, 0.36 * 1800 is 648, so total is 9648 coulombs. 

Now, Faraday's laws of electrolysis come into play here. Faraday's first law states that the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the charge passed. The formula is m = (Q * M) / (n * F), where m is mass, Q is charge, M is molar mass, n is the number of electrons transferred per ion, and F is Faraday's constant, which is about 96485 C/mol e⁻.

Wait, but actually the formula is m = (Q * M) / (n * F). So I can rearrange this to solve for M/(n), which is the equivalent weight. Because the equivalent weight is M/n. So if I plug in the values, I can find that.

I know that m is 3.27 grams, Q is 9648 C. So, M/n = (m * n * F) / Q. Wait no, rearranging m = (Q*M)/(nF) gives M/n = (m * F) / Q.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me write it down:

m = (Q * M) / (n * F)

I want to find M/n, which is the equivalent weight (since for each equivalent, n electrons are involved). So:

M/n = (m * F) / Q

Plugging in the numbers: m is 3.27 g, F is 96485 C/mol e⁻, Q is 9648 C.

So let's compute (3.27 g * 96485 C/mol e⁻) / 9648 C.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, 3.27 * 96485 = let's see. 3 * 96485 is 289,455. 0.27 * 96485 is approximately 26,040.95. So total is 289,455 +26,040.95 = 315,495.95. Now, divide by 9648.

So 315,495.95 / 9648 ≈ let's see. Let me do the division. 9648 * 32 is 308,736 (since 9648 * 30 is 289,440, plus 9648*2=19,296; 289,440+19,296=308,736). Subtract that from 315,495.95: 315,495.95 -308,736 = 6,759.95. Now, how much is 6,759.95 / 9648 ≈ approximately 0.7. So total is about 32.7.

Wait, so the equivalent weight is approximately 32.7 g. Looking at the options, F is 32.7g. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculation because the options don't seem to include 32.7 as the correct option. Oh wait, the options do have F as 32.7. But wait, I thought I might have messed up a step.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Compute numerator: 3.27 * 96485 = ?

Let me compute 3 * 96485 = 289,455. 0.27 * 96485: let's compute 0.2 *96485 = 19,297. 0.07 *96485 = 6,753.95. So 19,297 +6,753.95 = 26,050.95. So total is 289,455 +26,050.95 = 315,505.95.

Divide that by 9648:

315505.95 /9648 ≈ ?

How many times does 9648 go into 315,505. Let's see: 9648 *32 = 308,736. So 32 times. Subtract 308,736 from 315,505.95: 6,769.95 left. Now, 6,769.95 /9648 = approximately 0.7017. So total is 32.7017, which is about 32.7 g.

So yeah, the equivalent weight is 32.7g, which is option F.

Wait, but wait another thing. Zinc's usual valency is +2. So for each zinc ion, two electrons are needed. So n is 2. So the equivalent weight is M/n = M/2, since each equivalent is 2 electrons. So if I get M/n as 32.7, that would mean M is 65.4 g/mol. But wait, the atomic weight of zinc is about 65.38 g/mol, which is close. So that makes sense. So the equivalent weight is 32.7g, which is option F.

To determine the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt, we start by calculating the total charge passed through the electrolytic cell. The charge \( Q \) is given by:

\[
Q = I \cdot t
\]

where \( I = 5.36 \, \text{A} \) and \( t = 30 \, \text{min} = 1800 \, \text{s} \). Thus:

\[
Q = 5.36 \cdot 1800 = 9648 \, \text{C}
\]

Using Faraday's laws of electrolysis, the mass \( m \) of zinc deposited is related to the charge \( Q \), the molar mass \( M \), the number of electrons transferred per ion \( n \), and Faraday's constant \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \). The formula is:

\[
m = \frac{Q \cdot M}{n \cdot F}
\]

Rearranging to solve for the equivalent weight \( \frac{M}{n} \):

\[
\frac{M}{n} = \frac{m \cdot F}{Q}
\]

Substituting the given values \( m = 3.27 \, \text{g} \), \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \), and \( Q = 9648 \, \text{C} \):

\[
\frac{M}{n} = \frac{3.27 \cdot 96485}{9648}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
3.27 \cdot 96485 = 315505.95
\]

Now divide by \( 9648 \):

\[
\frac{315505.95}{9648} \approx 32.7 \, \text{g}
\]

Thus, the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt is approximately \( 32.7 \, \text{g} \). This matches option F. Additionally, zinc typically has a valency of \( +2 \), so the molar mass \( M \) of zinc is approximately \( 65.4 \, \text{g/mol} \), consistent with the calculation.

The final answer is:

**F: 32.7g**
