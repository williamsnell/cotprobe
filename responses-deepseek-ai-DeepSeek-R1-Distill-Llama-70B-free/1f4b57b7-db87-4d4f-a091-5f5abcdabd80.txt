Okay, so I've got this question about soft determinism, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that determinism is the idea that every event, including human decisions and actions, has a cause. So, hard determinism would say that everything is predetermined, and we don't really have free will because our choices are the result of prior causes.

But wait, what's soft determinism then? I think soft determinism is a bit different. It's also known as compatibilism, right? So, it tries to reconcile free will with determinism. In other words, soft determinists believe that even though our actions have prior causes, we can still have free will. They argue that free will is compatible with determinism.

So the question is asking what soft determinism entails. The options are A to H. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Our actions are completely predetermined. That sounds more like hard determinism. Soft determinism doesn't say everything is completely predetermined because it allows for free will within the framework of determinism. So A is probably not the right choice.

Option B: We have no control over our actions. Again, that's more like hard determinism or maybe fatalism. Soft determinism says we do have control, just that it's within the bounds of determinism. So B is likely incorrect.

Option C: The thesis of determinism is false. No, because soft determinism accepts that determinism is true. They just believe that free will can coexist with it. So C is wrong.

Option D: The thesis of free will is false. Hmm, no, because soft determinism upholds free will. They don't think free will is an illusion. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The thesis of determinism is true. Yes, that makes sense. Soft determinists agree that determinism is true but argue that it doesn't negate free will. So E seems correct.

Option F: There are no restraints on human behavior. That doesn't sound right. Determinism would imply that behavior is influenced by prior causes, so there are restraints. Soft determinism doesn't say there are no restraints. So F is wrong.

Option G: Human behavior is entirely random. No, determinism is about cause and effect, not randomness. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Our desires are predetermined, but our actions are not. Wait, no. Soft determinism would say that our desires and actions have causes, but we can still act freely. So H doesn't fit because it suggests actions aren't predetermined, which might align more with libertarian free will, not soft determinism.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E: the thesis of determinism is true.

Soft determinism, also known as compatibilism, holds that determinism and free will are compatible. It asserts that while human actions and decisions are influenced by prior causes, individuals can still exercise free will within this framework. Among the options provided:

- **A, B, D, F, G, and H** are incorrect because they either align with hard determinism, contradict the compatibility of free will and determinism, or misrepresent the nature of soft determinism.
- **C** is incorrect because soft determinism does not reject determinism.
- **E** is correct because soft determinism accepts the truth of determinism while maintaining the possibility of free will.

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: the thesis of determinism is true.

Answer: E
