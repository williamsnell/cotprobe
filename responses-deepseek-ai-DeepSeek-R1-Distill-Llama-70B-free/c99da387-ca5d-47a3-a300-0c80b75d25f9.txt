Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The police were called to a domestic dispute. The wife told police that her husband was abusive and that he was a heavy cocaine user. The husband was present and denied the allegation. Police asked for permission to search the premises for drugs, which was consented to by the wife. The husband, however, refused to consent to the search. The police went ahead anyway and found drugs in the husband's belongings. After being arrested on drug charges, the husband filed a motion for suppression of the evidence based on lack of consent. What should be the likely decision of the trial court?

Options:

A: The search was valid because the husband's denial of the allegations was not credible.
B: The search was invalid because the wife was not authorized to give consent to search her husband's personal belongings.
C: The search was invalid because the police did not have a search warrant, which is required regardless of consent.
D: The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.
E: The search was valid because the cases say that one occupant's consent to the search overrules the other occupant's refusal to consent.
F: The search was valid because the wife's statement established probable cause that a crime was being committed  this created exigent circumstances for the search.
G: The search was valid because the wife's consent was sufficient to search the common areas of the home.
H: The search was invalid because the consent to search was not voluntary, as it was given out of fear of domestic violence.
I: The search was valid because the drugs were in plain view when the police entered the premises.
J: The search was invalid because, even though consent was given, the police must first attempt to get a search warrant to enter a home.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with consent to search. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down.

The scenario is a domestic dispute where the police were called. The wife told them her husband is abusive and uses cocaine heavily. The husband denied it. The police asked to search the premises, and the wife agreed, but the husband refused. The police searched anyway and found drugs in the husband's stuff. Now, the husband is trying to get the evidence suppressed because he says they didn't have consent.

I remember that when it comes to consent to search, the general rule is that a co-occupant can consent to a search of the premises. But wait, there's a case where if one person consents and another refuses, the police can't proceed. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Oh right, I think the Supreme Court case of Georgia v. Randolph comes into play here. In that case, the police went to a home where the wife invited them in and gave consent to search for drugs, but the husband, who was present, refused. The Court held that the police could not conduct the search because one occupant's consent doesn't override another's refusal when the refuser is present. So the search was invalid without a warrant.

So applying that here, the wife consented, but the husband was present and refused. Under Randolph, the police shouldn't have searched without a warrant. So the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options, option D says the search was invalid because the co-occupant (husband) was present and refused. That aligns with what I just thought. Option E suggests that one consent overrides the other, but that's not correct after Randolph.

Wait, but option E says one occupant's consent overrules the other's refusal. That's actually the opposite of what Randolph decided. So E is wrong.

Other options: A talks about credibility of the husband's denial, but that's not relevant. The issue is consent, not whether the allegations were true. B says the wife couldn't consent to search her husband's personal belongings. But in this case, the police were searching the premises, not specifically his belongings, but regardless, I think if the wife consents to a search of the premises, it includes areas under joint control, but not necessarily the husband's personal effects unless she has authority. But the question says the drugs were found in the husband's belongings. So maybe that's a different issue.

But wait, the initial consent was to search the premises. If the premises include areas where the husband's belongings are, but he has a privacy interest, then perhaps the wife's consent might not be sufficient. But under Randolph, the main issue is the presence of the refusing co-tenant.

So even if the wife could consent to common areas, the search of the husband's personal belongings might require his consent. But in the question, the police searched the premises, and the drugs were in his belongings, so perhaps the wife's consent wasn't enough for that. But I'm a bit confused about that part.

Wait, but the main issue is whether the police can proceed with the search when one occupant consents and another refuses. Randolph says they can't. So even if the wife consented, because the husband refused and was present, the search was invalid. So the evidence should be suppressed, making D the correct answer.

Looking again, option D states exactly that: the search was invalid because the co-occupant was present and refused consent. So that's the right choice.

Another option I should consider is F, which mentions probable cause and exigent circumstances. The wife's statement might give probable cause, but without exigent circumstances, the police would need a warrant. Exigent circumstances are things like evidence being destroyed, which isn't mentioned here. So F is unlikely.

So the correct answer should be D.

The question revolves around whether the police's search of the premises was valid after the wife consented but the husband refused. Under the Supreme Court case *Georgia v. Randolph*, when one co-occupant consents to a search and another co-occupant explicitly refuses consent and is present, the police cannot proceed with the search without a warrant. In this scenario, the husband was present and refused consent, making the search invalid under Randolph. 

Option D correctly captures this principle, stating that the search was invalid because the co-occupant (husband) was present and specifically refused consent. Other options, such as E, are incorrect because they suggest that one occupant's consent can override another's refusal, which contradicts *Randolph*. Similarly, other options like B and F address tangential issues but do not align with the central legal principle at play.
