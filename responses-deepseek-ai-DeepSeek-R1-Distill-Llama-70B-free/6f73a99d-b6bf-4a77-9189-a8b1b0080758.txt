Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the worldwide prevalence of obesity. The question is asking me to pick the correct percentage from the options provided, which range from 10% up to 40%. 

First, I need to remember what I know about obesity rates globally. I've heard that obesity is a growing public health issue around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) probably has some data on this. I think they publish reports on obesity and overweight statistics.

Wait, I remember that the WHO defines obesity as having a BMI of 30 or higher. They also categorize overweight as BMI 25 or higher. So they track both, but the question specifically asks about obesity, not overweight.

I think the prevalence has been increasing over the past few decades. From what I recall, in 2016, the WHO reported that about 13% of adults worldwide were obese. That was a few years ago, so maybe the number has increased a bit since then. But I'm not sure if it's reached as high as 20% yet globally.

Let me think about other sources. There's also the Global Burden of Disease study, which might have more recent estimates. I believe in recent years, the global obesity prevalence in adults is around 13-15%. So the options given are A:30%, B:20%, C:13%, D:15%, E:40%, F:35%, G:10%, H:11%, I:25%, J:39%.

So if I'm remembering that around 13% is the figure, then option C would be 13%. But wait, I think that might have been for a specific year. Maybe the number has gone up a bit. Alternatively, sometimes they report the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity, which is higher. But the question is only about obesity.

Another angle: I remember that in the United States, obesity rates are much higher, like over 40% of adults. But that's just the US, not the whole world. Global rates are lower because many countries, especially low-income ones, have lower obesity rates, though they are rising.

Looking at the options, 13% is an option, but I'm thinking maybe it's a bit higher now. Or perhaps the figure I'm recalling is from a different source. Wait, the WHO's 2018 data might say something different. Let me try to recall. Oh, I think in 2016, it was about 11% for men and 15% for women, so the average would be around 13%. So that would make C (13%) correct.

Alternatively, if the data is more recent, like 2020 or 2021, the number might be a bit higher. But I'm not sure. Also, there's a difference between adult obesity and including children. The question doesn't specify, but I think it's referring to adults.

So, putting it together, the worldwide prevalence of obesity in adults is around 13%, which corresponds to option C.

The worldwide prevalence of obesity is approximately 13%, according to data from the World Health Organization and other global health reports. This figure refers specifically to adults and is based on the definition of obesity as a BMI of 30 or higher. While obesity rates have been increasing globally, the current estimate aligns most closely with option C.
