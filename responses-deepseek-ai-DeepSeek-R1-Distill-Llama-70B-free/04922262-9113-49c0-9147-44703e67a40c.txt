Question:

A grocery store is sued by a customer for damages for injuries allegedly suffered to the face and forearms, which resulted from his collision with the store's automatic doors. The customer contended that at the time of the mishap, the doors were programmed to swing outward, taking would-be customers entering the store, by surprise. At trial, the customer testified to both the nature of his injuries and the events leading up to their occurrence. The grocery store denied that the doors to its store were in any way unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by his encounter with the doors. The customer's sister testified at trial that she accompanied her brother to the store the day of the accident and witnessed the outward swinging doors, which struck him. She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, due to the possibility of bias.
B: admissible, as a first-hand witness account of the event.
C: inadmissible, as it lacks direct connection to the case.
D: admissible, as evidence of the store's negligence.
E: inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.
F: inadmissible, as it is hearsay evidence.
G: admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.
H: inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.
I: admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of a witness's testimony in a civil trial. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that a grocery store is being sued by a customer. The customer claims he was injured when the automatic doors swung outward and caused a collision. He's suing for damages. At the trial, the customer testified about his injuries and what happened. The store denies any wrongdoing, saying the doors weren't unsafe and that his injuries weren't caused by the doors.

Now, the customer's sister also testified. She was with him that day and saw the doors swing outward and hit him. She also said that when she went back the next week, the doors were reprogrammed to swing inward.

The question is about whether the sister's testimony is admissible, and the options are from A to I.

I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's start by recalling some evidence rules. The main issue here seems to be about the admissibility of the sister's statements, particularly the part about the doors being reprogrammed the next week.

First, the sister was present at the time of the accident, so her testimony about seeing the doors swing outward and strike her brother is a firsthand account. That part is likely admissible because she's a witness to the event. So her testimony about the accident itself should be okay.

But the second part is about her returning a week later and seeing the doors swing inward. Why is that relevant? It seems like she's testifying about a subsequent change made by the store. In evidence law, subsequent remedial measures are generally not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), Rule 407 states that evidence of subsequent measures taken to address a problem isn't admissible to prove negligence. However, it can be used for other purposes, like showing ownership or control.

Wait, but FRE 407 also says that this rule doesn't apply if the measure was taken after the event but before the lawsuit started. Or wait, no, the general rule is that evidence of fixing something after an event isn't admissible to show negligence. So the sister's testimony about the doors being changed might be inadmissible if offered to show negligence.

But wait, in some cases, such as when the defendant's own statement or action is used, it might be admissible under a different rule. Like, if the store changed the doors, that could be an admission. But the sister's testimony about the change is being offered by the plaintiff, so it's not an admission by a party opponent. Unless it's an admission by the store through their action, which might be a bit different.

Alternatively, the fact that the doors were changed could be used to show that the store knew the doors were dangerous, hence the change. But under Rule 407, that's not allowed unless it's for purposes other than proving negligence. So if the sister's testimony is about the change, the store might object, saying it's inadmissible under Rule 407.

But wait, the sister's testimony about the change is not being offered for the truth of the matter (that the store was negligent), but maybe to show that the store had notice or took action, which could be relevant. Or perhaps it's being offered as substantive evidence that the store's doors were indeed dangerous, hence they changed them.

Hmm, but Rule 407 specifically bars such evidence when it's offered to prove negligence or defect. However, there's an exception: if the evidence is being offered for another purpose, like to show the feasibility of precautionary measures or ownership. But in this case, the sister's testimony might be trying to show that the store recognized the problem and fixed it, implying negligence.

So, the sister's testimony about the doors being reprogrammed the next week would likely be inadmissible under FRE 407 if it's being used to prove negligence. But wait, the sister is a witness for the plaintiff. So the store's action is being used against them. Is there another rule that allows this?

Wait, another thought: If the store changed the doors, that could be considered an admission. But the sister's testimony about the change is not an admission by the store; it's just an observation. Admissions are usually statements or actions by the party themselves. So the sister's testimony about the change wouldn't qualify as an admission.

So, the sister's testimony about the change is hearsay? No, because she's testifying about what she observed—the doors swinging inward. That's not hearsay; it's a statement about a fact she observed. So hearsay isn't the issue here.

Another angle: the testimony might be admissible as evidence of the store's subsequent action, but under Rule 407, it's inadmissible to prove negligence. But wait, the initial part of her testimony is about the accident, which is admissible. The second part about the change might be inadmissible if it's being used to show negligence.

Wait, in some cases, the subsequent change can be admissible if the plaintiff can show that the defendant was aware of the danger before the change. But I think that's not the case. The general rule is that such evidence is inadmissible to prove negligence.

So, looking at the options:

Option D says "admissible as evidence of the store's negligence." If that's the case, under Rule 407, it would be inadmissible for that purpose. So option D would be incorrect.

Option B says "admissible as a first-hand witness account." That applies to her testimony about the accident, which is admissible. But what about the part about the doors being changed? The question is about the entire testimony—does the sister's testimony as a whole get admitted?

Wait, the question is about the sister's testimony in general. She testifies about two things: the accident and the subsequent change. The accident part is admissible, the change part may not be if it's being used to show negligence.

But the question is phrased as "the sister's testimony"—does that mean the entire testimony, or specific parts? The options don't specify, so I think the question is about the admissibility of the sister's testimony as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the sister's testimony about the subsequent change is inadmissible, but the rest is admissible. But the question is whether the judge should rule her testimony (as a whole) admissible or not.

Alternatively, perhaps her testimony about the change is admissible for a different purpose, like to show that the doors were a hazard, but under Rule 407, it's not admissible for that.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The sister's testimony about the change could be used to show that the store was aware of a dangerous condition and took steps to fix it, which would imply negligence. But under Rule 407, that's exactly the kind of use that's prohibited. So the testimony about the change would be inadmissible for that purpose.

But wait, the sister's testimony isn't hearsay, so that's not the issue. The issue is whether it's barred under Rule 407.

So, if the plaintiff offers her testimony about the doors being changed to prove that the store was negligent, it's inadmissible. So, the sister's testimony about the change would be inadmissible for that purpose.

But wait, the question is about whether the sister's testimony is admissible. So, part of her testimony (about the accident) is admissible, and part (about the change) is inadmissible. So the entire testimony wouldn't be excluded, but part of it would be. However, the options don't present that; they're about the entire testimony.

Wait, looking back, the options are: A says inadmissible due to bias. But the sister being a relative doesn't automatically make her testimony inadmissible; it's a factor in assessing credibility, not admissibility. So A is incorrect.

Option B: admissible as a first-hand account. That applies to her witnessing the accident, so that part is admissible. But the change part might not be. However, the question is about the entire testimony, so perhaps B is correct because she's a firsthand witness to the accident.

Wait, but the store's defense is that the doors weren't unsafe. So the sister's testimony about the doors swinging outward and striking her brother is relevant and admissible as a firsthand account.

The part about the doors being changed is a separate issue. So maybe the sister's entire testimony is admissible because she's testifying about what she saw, and the change part is being used for a purpose other than proving negligence. Or perhaps the change is admissible as evidence that the store had notice or that the doors were dangerous.

Wait, but under Rule 407, evidence of subsequent measures is inadmissible to prove negligence. But it can be used for other purposes, such as to show that the condition existed at the time of the event, or to rebut a claim that the condition wasn't dangerous.

Alternatively, perhaps the sister's testimony about the change is being offered to show that the store had knowledge of the problem, which could be relevant to establish that the store acted negligently in not fixing it earlier. But again, Rule 407 would bar that unless it's for another purpose.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what each option says.

Option D: admissible as evidence of the store's negligence. If that's the purpose, then it's inadmissible under Rule 407.

Option B: admissible as a firsthand account. That part is correct; she witnessed the accident.

Option I: admissible as a commonsense impression. Hmm, that's about lay opinion under Rule 701. But her testimony is about facts, not opinion, so I doesn't apply.

Option G: admissible as a tacit admission. That would require that the store's action (changing the doors) is considered an admission. But the sister's testimony about the change is just a fact, not an admission by the store. So G might not apply.

Option F: inadmissible as hearsay. But her testimony about the doors is not hearsay because she's testifying about what she saw. So F is incorrect.

Option H: inadmissible as irrelevant. No, because it's relevant to the case—whether the doors were dangerous.

Option E: inadmissible on public policy. I don't think so; public policy isn't the issue here.

So, the sister's testimony about the accident is admissible as a firsthand account. The part about the change is inadmissible under Rule 407 if it's being used to prove negligence. So, in that case, the entire testimony wouldn't be inadmissible, but part of it would be.

Wait, but the question is phrased as whether the judge should rule her testimony inadmissible or admissible. So if part is admissible and part isn't, the judge would allow the admissible parts and exclude the others. But the options don't offer that; they're all about the entire testimony.

So perhaps the sister's entire testimony is admissible because she's a firsthand witness, and the part about the change is being used for a permissible purpose, like to show that the store had knowledge of the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is admissible as evidence that the doors were indeed dangerous, which would make the store's change relevant beyond just showing negligence.

Wait, another angle: the fact that the store changed the doors could be used to show that the doors were dangerous, which is a fact at issue. So under Rule 407, evidence of subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence, but it is admissible for other purposes, such as to prove the existence of a dangerous condition.

So, the sister's testimony about the change could be admissible for that purpose. Therefore, the entire testimony would be admissible.

If that's the case, then option D would be correct because it's evidence of the store's negligence. Wait, but under Rule 407, it's inadmissible for that purpose. So perhaps the testimony about the change is admissible not to show negligence, but to show the condition of the doors, which is relevant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible purposes. The sister's testimony about the change is relevant to show that the doors were indeed dangerous, and that the store recognized the danger by changing them. So, the purpose is to show the dangerous condition, which is a fact at issue.

In that case, under Rule 407, the evidence is admissible for that purpose, not for proving negligence. So the testimony about the change would be admissible for that limited purpose.

Therefore, the sister's entire testimony would be admissible because she's a firsthand witness to the accident, and the change is admissible to show the dangerous condition, not to prove negligence.

So looking at the options, option B says "admissible as a firsthand witness account." That's correct for the accident part. But the change part is admissible for another purpose.

Option D says "admissible as evidence of the store's negligence." But that's not allowed under Rule 407. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but if the change is being used to show the dangerous condition, then it's admissible. So the sister's testimony as a whole is admissible, making option B correct.

Alternatively, maybe the change is inadmissible, but the rest is admissible, so the judge would admit part and exclude part. But since the question is about the entire testimony, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the sister's testimony includes both the accident and the change. The accident part is admissible, and the change part is admissible for a purpose other than negligence, so the entire testimony is admissible.

Therefore, the answer would be B: admissible as a first-hand witness account of the event.

Wait, but the change part is also part of the event, but it's a subsequent event. So perhaps the sister's testimony about the change isn't part of the event in question. So the admissibility of her testimony about the change depends on the purpose.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to recall: when a witness testifies about an event they observed, that's admissible. Testimony about subsequent events (like the doors being changed) is admissible only if it's for a purpose other than proving negligence.

So, in this case, the sister's testimony about the change is being used to show that the doors were dangerous, which is a fact at issue. Therefore, it's admissible under Rule 407's exception.

Thus, her entire testimony is admissible. So the correct answer would be B or D. But wait, option D says it's admissible as evidence of negligence, which is barred. So D is incorrect.

Option B says it's admissible as a firsthand account, which applies to the accident. The change is admissible for another purpose, so the entire testimony is admissible.

So the judge should rule her testimony admissible, making option B correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the sister's testimony in a trial where a customer sued a grocery store for injuries allegedly caused by automatic doors swinging outward. The sister testified about two things: (1) witnessing the accident and the doors striking her brother, and (2) returning the following week and observing that the doors had been reprogrammed to swing inward. The analysis focuses on whether the sister's testimony, in its entirety, is admissible.

### Key Analysis of the Sister's Testimony:
1. **Testimony About the Accident**: The sister was present at the time of the accident and testified about what she observed—the doors swinging outward and striking her brother. This is a firsthand account of the event and is admissible under the rules of evidence.

2. **Testimony About the Subsequent Change to the Doors**: The sister also testified that the doors were reprogrammed to swing inward the following week. Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 407, evidence of subsequent remedial measures (like changing the doors) is generally inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. However, such evidence can be admissible for other purposes, such as showing the existence of a dangerous condition or that the defendant had knowledge of the issue.

   - If the sister's testimony about the change is offered to prove negligence, it would be inadmissible under FRE 407.
   - If it is offered to show that the doors were dangerous or that the store had knowledge of the problem, it could be admissible for that limited purpose.

### Evaluation of the Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The sister's testimony is not inadmissible solely due to the possibility of bias. Bias affects credibility, not admissibility.
- **Option B**: Correct. The sister's testimony about the accident is admissible as a firsthand witness account. The testimony about the subsequent change, if used to show the existence of a dangerous condition, is also admissible for that purpose.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The testimony has a direct connection to the case, as it pertains to the accident and the condition of the doors.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the testimony about the change might be admissible for purposes other than proving negligence, it is not admissible as evidence of the store's negligence under FRE 407.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. There are no public policy considerations that would render the testimony inadmissible.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The sister's testimony is not hearsay, as she is testifying about events she personally observed.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The testimony about the change is not an admission by the store, as it is the sister's observation, not a statement or action by the store itself.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The testimony is relevant to the case, as it pertains to the condition of the doors and the accident.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The testimony is about observed facts, not a lay opinion.

### Conclusion:
The sister's testimony is admissible as a firsthand account of the accident, and the part about the subsequent change to the doors is admissible for purposes other than proving negligence, such as showing the existence of a dangerous condition. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: admissible, as a first-hand witness account of the event.**
