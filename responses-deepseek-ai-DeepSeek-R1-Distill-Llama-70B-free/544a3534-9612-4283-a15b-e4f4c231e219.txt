Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the food resource base of post-Pleistocene Europe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my history, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking about the most prominent feature of the food resources after the Pleistocene era. The Pleistocene epoch ended about 11,700 years ago, right? So we're talking about the time just after that, which would be the early Holocene.

I remember that during the Pleistocene, large Ice Age animals, like mammoths and giant deer, were common. These are often referred to as megafauna. Humans at that time were hunter-gatherers, relying heavily on these large animals for food, clothing, and tools. But then, many of these megafauna went extinct at the end of the last Ice Age. So after the Pleistocene, the environment changed, and the available resources must have shifted.

So the options are A to D. Let's look at each one.

Option A: dependence on megafauna. Well, if the megafauna were mostly extinct by then, this might not be the case anymore. Post-Pleistocene, maybe people had to rely on smaller animals and other resources.

Option B: hunting and gathering. That sounds like a method of obtaining food rather than a feature of the resource base itself. The resource base would be what's available, not how it's obtained.

Option C: dependence on fur-bearing animals. I'm not too sure about this one. Fur-bearing animals like beavers or foxes were around, but were they the main food source? I don't think so. They might have been more important for clothing and trade, but not the primary food resource.

Option D: diversity. After the Pleistocene, the climate warmed up, and ecosystems probably became more varied. Forests expanded, and different species flourished. So the food resources would have included a wider variety of plants, smaller animals, fish, and maybe early signs of domestication. This diversity would support a more varied diet.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought that in the Mesolithic period, which is post-Pleistocene, people were still hunter-gatherers but adapted to new environments. They might have had a diverse diet including fruits, nuts, fish, and smaller game. So the resource base would have been more diverse compared to the Pleistocene's reliance on large animals.

So putting it together, the prominent feature would be diversity. So the answer should be D.

The most prominent feature of the food resource base of post-Pleistocene Europe was its diversity. After the Pleistocene era, many megafauna species went extinct, and the climate warmed, leading to the expansion of forests and the emergence of varied ecosystems. This shift allowed for a wider variety of food sources, including plants, smaller animals, fish, and early signs of domestication, supporting a more diverse diet compared to the previous reliance on large game.

Answer: D
