Okay, so I have this question here asking which of the listed people was not alive in the 20th century. The options are A through D: Sigmund Freud, Ulysses S Grant, Mark Twain, and Thomas Edison. I need to figure out which one wasn't alive during the 1900s.

First, I'll go through each person one by one to determine when they lived. 

Starting with option A, Sigmund Freud. I remember he was a psychologist, the founder of psychoanalysis. I think he lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Maybe he was born in the 1850s and died in the 1930s. So he definitely was alive in the 20th century, at least until 1939.

Option B is Ulysses S Grant. He was a significant figure in American history, a general in the Civil War and later became president. I recall that he was president in the late 1800s, so his term was in the 1860s or 1870s. Wait, Grant was president from 1869 to 1877. So he was definitely alive in the 19th century. Did he live into the 20th? Let me think. He died in 1885, I believe. So 1885 is in the 19th century, right? Because the 20th century starts in 1901. So Grant died before the 20th century began. That means he wasn't alive in the 20th century.

Option C is Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens. I know he was a famous author, wrote "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn." He was born in 1835, I think, and died in 1910. So he lived well into the 20th century, as 1910 is part of it. So he was alive in the 20th century.

Option D is Thomas Edison. He was an inventor, known for the light bulb and other inventions. He was born in 1847 and died in 1931. So he was alive until 1931, which is definitely in the 20th century. So he was alive during that time.

Wait, let me double-check the years. The 20th century runs from 1901 to 2000. So any death year after 1900 would mean the person was alive in the 20th century. 

So Ulysses S Grant died in 1885, which is before 1901. So he didn't live in the 20th century. The others all died in the 1900s or later. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: Ulysses S Grant.

The question asks which of the listed individuals was not alive during the 20th century (1901â€“2000). 

- **Sigmund Freud (A):** Born in 1856 and died in 1939, he was alive during the 20th century.  
- **Ulysses S Grant (B):** Born in 1822 and died in 1885, he passed away before the 20th century began, so he was not alive during that time.  
- **Mark Twain (C):** Born in 1835 and died in 1910, he lived into the 20th century.  
- **Thomas Edison (D):** Born in 1847 and died in 1931, he was alive during the 20th century.  

Thus, the person not alive in the 20th century is **Ulysses S Grant**.  

Answer: B
