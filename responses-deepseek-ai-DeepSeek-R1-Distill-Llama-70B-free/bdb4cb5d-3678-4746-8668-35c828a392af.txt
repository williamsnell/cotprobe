Alright, let's tackle this question. So, the question is asking which of the listed options is not a TV cartoon duo. The options are from A to H.

First, I'll go through each option one by one and see if I recognize them as TV cartoon duos.

Option A: SpongeBob and Patrick. Oh yeah, they're from SpongeBob SquarePants. They're best friends, so definitely a duo.

Option B: Phineas and Ferb. That's the title of the show itself. They're stepbrothers who have all sorts of adventures, so that's a duo.

Option C: Tom and Jerry. Classic cartoon where a cat and mouse are always at odds. Definitely a duo.

Option D: Chip and Dale. They're those two chipmunks from Disney, always causing trouble. Yep, they're a duo.

Option E: Beavis and Butt-head. They're the main characters of the show Beavis and Butt-head. Their antics are legendary, so that's a duo.

Option F: Pinky and the Brain. They're from Animaniacs, I think. They're lab mice trying to take over the world. Definitely a duo.

Option G: Scooby and Shaggy. From Scooby-Doo, they're always the ones looking for food and solving mysteries together. So that's a duo.

Option H: Simon and Garfunkel. Hmm, that's the tricky one. Simon & Garfunkel were a famous music duo, right? They sang songs like "The Sound of Silence" and "Bridge Over Troubled Water." They weren't a TV cartoon. They were real people, musicians. So this is the one that's not a TV cartoon duo.

Wait, let me double-check. Are there any TV cartoons featuring Simon and Garfunkel as characters? I don't think so. They were real, so the answer should be H.

The question asks which of the listed options is not a TV cartoon duo. After reviewing each option:

- **A: SpongeBob and Patrick** - From SpongeBob SquarePants, a cartoon duo.
- **B: Phineas and Ferb** - Title characters of a cartoon show.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: Simon and Garfunkel**, as they are not a TV cartoon duo.
