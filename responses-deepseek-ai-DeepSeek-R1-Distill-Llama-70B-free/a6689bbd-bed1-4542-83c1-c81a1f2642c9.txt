Question:

A defendant and his friend were down on their luck. They decided they would make some extra cash by robbing the local liquor store. The friend didn't like guns and decided to use a toy gun, which looked like a real gun, but only shot water. The defendant was aware that the gun was not real. Their plan fixed, they walked into the liquor store late one afternoon when few customers were in the store. The friend produced the toy pistol and pointed it at the customers and the clerk. The defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the clerk began to rummage behind the counter for the key to the register. While his head was ducked, the clerk pulled a shotgun from behind the counter and fired it at the defendant and his friend. The defendant dived to the side, but his friend was shot and killed. If the defendant is subsequently charged with his friend's death he should be found

Options:

A: guilty of felony murder.
B: not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend.
C: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill his friend.
D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.
E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
F: guilty of second degree murder.
G: guilty of voluntary manslaughter.
H: guilty of first degree murder.
I: guilty, because the defendant was involved in the commission of a felony when his friend was killed.
J: not guilty, because the defendant did not pull the trigger.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about felony murder. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the situation is that a defendant and his friend are robbing a liquor store. The friend uses a toy gun that looks real but shoots water. The defendant knows it's not real. They go into the store, the friend points the toy gun at people, and the defendant tells everyone to get on the floor. The clerk goes behind the counter, gets a shotgun, and shoots the friend, killing him. The defendant is charged with his friend's death.

Hmm. The question is about criminal liability, specifically felony murder. Felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, and the perpetrator can be held liable even if the killing wasn't intentional.

Wait, but in this case, it's the clerk who shot the friend, not the defendant. So does the defendant get charged with the friend's death under felony murder?

I remember that felony murder can apply even if the killing was by a third party, like a victim or a bystander, as long as it's in the course of the felony. So if during the robbery, the clerk shoots and kills the friend, the defendant might be liable for felony murder.

But wait, there might be exceptions. Like, if the third party's actions were unforeseeable or if the killing was in self-defense. But here, the clerk was responding to what appeared to be an armed robbery. The friend was using a realistic toy gun, so the clerk might have had a reasonable belief that there was a threat.

Wait, no, the friend's gun was a toy, but it looked real. The defendant knew it was fake, but the clerk didn't. So from the clerk's perspective, it was a real robbery with a real gun. So the clerk's response might be considered justified self-defense or defense of others. But does that affect the felony murder charge?

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, if the killing was done by a third party in response to the felony, the felony murder doctrine still applies. Because the act of the third party is a foreseeable consequence of the felony. So the defendant could still be held liable.

Wait, but if the clerk was justified in using deadly force, does that mean the defendant can't be held liable? Or does the justification only apply to the clerk's own criminal liability, not the defendant's?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Felony murder applies when a death occurs during a felony, regardless of intent. It's a strict liability approach, I think. So even if the clerk was justified, the fact remains that the death occurred during the felony, which the defendant was committing.

But wait, there's something called the "merger rule." If the underlying felony is an assault, and the killing is done in self-defense, maybe the felony murder doesn't apply. But in this case, the underlying felony is robbery, which doesn't necessarily merge.

Wait, another angle: the felony murder rule applies when the death is a natural and probable consequence of the felony. So if the clerk's action was a foreseeable response to the robbery, then the defendant is liable.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions have rules where if a third party's actions are the sole cause of death, and those actions are not part of the felony, the felony murder might not apply. But I'm not sure about that.

Let me look at the options.

Option A says guilty of felony murder. That's the one I'm leaning towards because the friend's death happened during the robbery.

Option B says not guilty because the clerk was justified. But I think the clerk's justification affects their own liability, not the defendant's. So B might not be correct.

Option C: not guilty because defendant didn't intend to kill. But felony murder doesn't require intent, so C is wrong.

Option D: guilty because a felon can be convicted of a co-felon's murder. That sounds like felony murder, where the death of a co-felon is attributed to the defendant.

Option E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter. That's a lesser charge. But if felony murder applies, that's a higher charge, so E might not be the right answer.

Option I: guilty because he was involved in the felony when the friend was killed. That sounds like felony murder as well.

So the options are A, D, I.

Wait, the distinction between A and D and I. Let's read the options again.

Option A: guilty of felony murder.

Option D: guilty because a felon may be convicted of murder of a co-felon.

Option I: guilty because involved in the commission of a felony when friend was killed.

In some jurisdictions, the felony murder rule applies when a co-felon is killed by a third party, as long as it's during the felony. So the defendant could be guilty under felony murder.

But wait, the friend was a co-felon. So the death of a co-felon, even by a third party, can make the defendant guilty of felony murder. So D might be the correct answer.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: sometimes, the felony murder rule doesn't apply if the killing was done by the police or someone acting in self-defense. But I think that's more about whether the killing was a foreseeable consequence.

In this case, the clerk's action was a direct response to the robbery. So it's foreseeable that during an armed robbery, the store clerk might try to defend himself, possibly with lethal force. So the defendant could have foreseen that, making the friend's death a natural and probable consequence.

So under the felony murder doctrine, the defendant is guilty. So looking at the options, A says guilty of felony murder, D says guilty because a felon can be convicted of co-felon's murder, and I says guilty because involved in felony when killed.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D because it's the death of a co-felon during the commission of the felony. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, the answer could be A, which is a broader statement about felony murder.

Wait, the felony murder doctrine is when a death occurs during a felony, regardless of who causes it. So even if the clerk caused it, the defendant is guilty.

So the correct answer would be A: guilty of felony murder.

But wait, looking back, the friend was a co-felon, and the clerk shot him. So the defendant is another co-felon. So under the felony murder rule, the defendant can be held liable for the death of his co-felon if it occurs during the commission of the felony.

So the reasoning is that the felony (robbery) was in progress, and the death happened as a result of the felony, even if caused by a third party.

In that case, the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say that the felony murder rule applies when the death is caused by the defendant or a co-felon. But here, the death was caused by the clerk, a third party. However, the doctrine can still apply because the clerk's action was a direct response to the felony.

So yes, the answer is A.
</think>

The question revolves around the criminal liability of the defendant for the death of his friend during the commission of a robbery. The defendant and his friend used a toy gun that looked real, and the clerk, believing it was a real gun, shot and killed the friend. The issue is whether the defendant can be held liable for the friend's death under the felony murder doctrine.

Felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of intent or who caused the death. In this case, the death occurred during the robbery, which is a felony. The clerk's action, though in response to the perceived threat, was a foreseeable consequence of the robbery. Therefore, the defendant can be held liable for the friend's death under the felony murder doctrine.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Guilty of felony murder. This is correct because the death occurred during the commission of the felony (robbery), and the felony murder doctrine applies regardless of who caused the death.
- **B**: Not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend. This is incorrect because the clerk's justification affects their own liability, not the defendant's liability under the felony murder doctrine.
- **C**: Not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill his friend. This is incorrect because intent is not required for felony murder.
- **D**: Guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon. While this is true, it is a more specific statement that aligns with the broader principle of felony murder.
- **E**: Guilty of involuntary manslaughter. This is incorrect because felony murder, a more severe charge, applies here.
- **F**: Guilty of second-degree murder. This is incorrect because the felony murder doctrine, not degrees of murder, applies.
- **G**: Guilty of voluntary manslaughter. This is incorrect because manslaughter does not apply to this scenario.
- **H**: Guilty of first-degree murder. This is incorrect because first-degree murder requires premeditation, which is not present here.
- **I**: Guilty, because the defendant was involved in the commission of a felony when his friend was killed. This is correct but is encompassed under the broader felony murder doctrine.
- **J**: Not guilty, because the defendant did not pull the trigger. This is incorrect because felony murder does not require the defendant to be the one who caused the death.

The most accurate and comprehensive answer is **A**, as it directly addresses the application of the felony murder doctrine to the facts of the case.

Answer: A
