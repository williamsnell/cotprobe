Okay, so I've got this problem about a bird in a 3x3x3 cubical maze, and I need to find the entropy rate of its random walk. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the entropy rate for a Markov chain is related to the uncertainty of the next state given the current state. Since the bird moves to adjoining rooms with equal probability, each room's entropy contribution depends on the number of exits it has.

The cube has 27 rooms in total. Each room is a cube itself, and depending on its position, the number of exits (or neighbors) varies. I think the corner rooms have 3 exits, edge rooms (but not corners) have 4, face centers have 5, and the very center of the cube has 6 exits? Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure.

In a 3x3x3 cube, each room can be a corner, edge, face, or the center. Corners are at the eight vertices, each with 3 exits. Edge rooms would be along the edges but not corners. Each edge of a cube has 3 rooms, but the two at the ends are corners, so the middle one is an edge room. Each edge has 3 rooms, so 12 edge rooms in total (since a cube has 12 edges). Each edge room is connected to 4 other rooms. Then, the face centers are the centers of each face of the cube. There are 6 faces, so 6 face center rooms. Each face center has 5 exits. Finally, the very center of the cube has 6 exits, I think.

Wait, no. Wait, the 3x3x3 cube: each room is connected to its neighbors. So, for each room, the number of exits depends on its position. Let me try to categorize them.

- Corner rooms: 8 in total (like the 8 corners of a cube). Each has 3 exits.
- Edge rooms: These are the rooms along the edges, not including the corners. Each edge has 1 such room (since 3 rooms per edge, 2 are corners, 1 is middle). There are 12 edges, so 12 edge rooms. Each has 4 exits.
- Face centers: Each face of the cube has a center room. There are 6 faces, so 6 face center rooms. Each has 5 exits.
- The very center of the cube: Only 1 room. It has 6 exits.

So in total, rooms are 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27, which checks out.

Now, the next step is to model this as a Markov chain and find the entropy rate. The entropy rate H is given by the average entropy per step, which is the sum over all states (rooms) of the stationary probability of being in that state multiplied by the entropy of the transitions from that state.

So H = sum over s [ π_s * H_s ], where π_s is the stationary distribution, and H_s is the entropy of the transitions from state s.

In a symmetric random walk on a graph, the stationary distribution π_s is proportional to the degree of the node. Because in an undirected graph, the stationary distribution for a simple random walk is π_s = degree(s) / (2 * |edges|). Wait, but in this case, each room's transitions are determined by the number of exits, which is the degree. So the stationary probability π_s for each room s is (degree(s)) / (sum of all degrees).

Wait, let me clarify. The sum of all degrees in the graph is equal to twice the number of edges, but in this random walk, each room's probability is proportional to its number of exits, which is its degree. So for each room, π_s = (number of exits of s) / (sum over all rooms of their exits).

So I'll need to compute the sum of degrees. Let's compute that.

Compute sum of degrees:

- 8 corner rooms, each with 3 exits: 8 * 3 =24
- 12 edge rooms, each with 4 exits: 12 *4=48
- 6 face centers, each with 5 exits:6 *5=30
- 1 center room, 6 exits:6
Total sum = 24 +48 +30 +6 = 108.

So the sum is 108. So each π_s = (degree(s)) / 108.

Now, for each room, the entropy H_s is the entropy of the outgoing transitions. Since the bird chooses each exit with equal probability, the probability for each next room is 1/k, where k is the number of exits.

The entropy H_s for a room with degree k is H_s = - sum_{i=1 to k} (1/k) log2(1/k) ) = log2(k) because each term is (1/k) * log2(k), summed k times, so k*(1/k) log2(k) = log2(k).

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The entropy is - sum p_i log p_i. When all p_i are equal, each is 1/k, so it's -k*(1/k) log2(1/k) ) = - log2(1/k) ) = log2(k). Right.

So H_s = log2(k), where k is the number of exits from room s.

Now, the overall entropy rate H is sum over s [ π_s * H_s ].

So I need to compute this sum, grouped by room types.

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute each category:

1. Corner rooms: 8 rooms, each with k=3.

Each contributes H_s = log2(3) ≈ 1.58496 bits.

Each π_s = 3/108 = 1/36 ≈ 0.027778.

So for each corner room, the term is (1/36) * log2(3).

Since there are 8 such rooms, their total contribution is 8*(1/36)*log2(3) = (8/36) * log2(3) = (2/9) * 1.58496 ≈ 0.3529 * 1.58496 ≈ Let me compute that: 0.3529 * 1.58496.

Wait, 0.3529 *1.58496:

0.3 * 1.58496 = 0.475488

0.05 *1.58496=0.079248

0.0029 *1.58496≈0.00459.

Adding them: 0.475488 +0.079248=0.554736 +0.00459≈0.559326.

So corner rooms contribute approximately 0.5593 bits.

2. Edge rooms: 12 rooms, each with k=4.

H_s = log2(4) = 2 bits.

Each π_s =4/108 =1/27 ≈0.037037.

Each term: (1/27)*2.

Total for 12 rooms: 12*(1/27)*2 = (24/27) = 8/9 ≈0.8889.

Wait, (12 * 2 ) /27 =24/27 =8/9≈0.8889.

So edge rooms contribute 0.8889 bits.

3. Face center rooms:6 rooms, each with k=5.

H_s=log2(5)≈2.32193 bits.

Each π_s=5/108≈0.046296.

Each term: (5/108)*2.32193.

6 rooms: 6*(5/108)*2.32193 = (30/108)*2.32193 = (5/18) *2.32193 ≈0.277778 *2.32193.

Compute 0.277778 *2.32193:

0.2 *2.32193=0.464386

0.077778 *2.32193≈0.077778*2=0.155556; 0.077778*0.32193≈0.02503. So total ≈0.155556 +0.02503=0.180586.

Adding to 0.464386: 0.464386 +0.180586≈0.64497.

So face centers contribute ≈0.64497 bits.

4. Center room:1 room, k=6.

H_s=log2(6)≈2.58496 bits.

π_s=6/108=1/18≈0.055556.

Contribution: (1/18)*2.58496≈0.055556 *2.58496≈0.1436.

So adding all contributions together:

Corners:≈0.5593

Edges:≈0.8889

Faces:≈0.64497

Center:≈0.1436

Total H≈0.5593 +0.8889 +0.64497 +0.1436.

Let me add them step by step.

0.5593 +0.8889 =1.4482

1.4482 +0.64497=2.09317

2.09317 +0.1436=2.23677.

Hmm, so approximately 2.237 bits per step.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each contribution more precisely.

Let me recompute.

Corners:

8 rooms, each with k=3.

Each π_s =3/108=1/36.

Each H_s= log2(3)=1.58496.

Contribution per room: (3/108)*log2(3) = (1/36)*1.58496 ≈0.0441.

8 rooms: 8 *0.0441≈0.3528.

Edges:

12 rooms, k=4.

Each π_s=4/108=1/27.

H_s=2.

Contribution per room: (4/108)*2 = (1/27)*2≈0.07407.

12 rooms:12*(0.07407)=0.8889.

Face centers:

6 rooms, k=5.

Each π_s=5/108.

H_s=log2(5)=2.321928095.

Contribution per room: (5/108)*2.321928095.

6 rooms:6*(5/108)*2.321928095 = (30/108)*2.321928095≈0.2777778 *2.321928095.

Compute 0.2777778 *2.321928095:

2.321928095 * (5/18) = ?

5/18 ≈0.2777778.

2.321928095 *0.2777778 ≈(2 +0.321928095)*0.2777778.

2 *0.2777778=0.5555556.

0.321928095 *0.2777778≈0.0892857.

Total ≈0.5555556 +0.0892857≈0.6448413.

So face centers contribute≈0.64484.

Center room:

k=6.

H_s=log2(6)=2.58496.

π_s=6/108=1/18≈0.0555556.

Contribution: (6/108)*2.58496= (1/18)*2.58496≈0.1436.

Now, sum all contributions.

Corners:0.3528.

Edges:0.8889.

Faces:0.64484.

Center:0.1436.

Total=0.3528 +0.8889=1.2417.

1.2417 +0.64484=1.88654.

1.88654 +0.1436=2.03014.

So approximately 2.03 bits per step.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.03, which matches this result.

To determine the entropy rate of the bird's random walk in the 3x3x3 cubical maze, we model the problem as a Markov chain and calculate the entropy rate using the formula:

\[
H = \sum_s \pi_s H_s
\]

where \( \pi_s \) is the stationary distribution of being in state \( s \), and \( H_s \) is the entropy of the transitions from state \( s \). The bird moves to adjoining rooms with equal probability, so the entropy \( H_s \) for a room with \( k \) exits is \( \log_2(k) \). The stationary distribution \( \pi_s \) is proportional to the number of exits (degree) of the room, normalized by the total sum of degrees across all rooms.

### Step 1: Categorize the rooms and their degrees
The 27 rooms in the 3x3x3 cube can be categorized as follows:
- **Corner rooms**: 8 rooms, each with 3 exits.
- **Edge rooms**: 12 rooms, each with 4 exits.
- **Face center rooms**: 6 rooms, each with 5 exits.
- **Center room**: 1 room, with 6 exits.

### Step 2: Compute the total sum of degrees
The total sum of degrees is:
\[
8 \cdot 3 + 12 \cdot 4 + 6 \cdot 5 + 1 \cdot 6 = 24 + 48 + 30 + 6 = 108
\]

Thus, the stationary probability for a room with degree \( k \) is:
\[
\pi_s = \frac{k}{108}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the entropy contributions
The entropy \( H_s \) for a room with \( k \) exits is \( \log_2(k) \). We calculate the contribution to the entropy rate from each category of rooms:

1. **Corner rooms**:
   - \( k = 3 \), \( H_s = \log_2(3) \approx 1.585 \)
   - \( \pi_s = \frac{3}{108} = \frac{1}{36} \)
   - Contribution: \( 8 \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot 1.585 \approx 0.3528 \)

2. **Edge rooms**:
   - \( k = 4 \), \( H_s = \log_2(4) = 2 \)
   - \( \pi_s = \frac{4}{108} = \frac{1}{27} \)
   - Contribution: \( 12 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot 2 = 0.8889 \)

3. **Face center rooms**:
   - \( k = 5 \), \( H_s = \log_2(5) \approx 2.322 \)
   - \( \pi_s = \frac{5}{108} \)
   - Contribution: \( 6 \cdot \frac{5}{108} \cdot 2.322 \approx 0.6448 \)

4. **Center room**:
   - \( k = 6 \), \( H_s = \log_2(6) \approx 2.585 \)
   - \( \pi_s = \frac{6}{108} = \frac{1}{18} \)
   - Contribution: \( 1 \cdot \frac{1}{18} \cdot 2.585 \approx 0.1436 \)

### Step 4: Sum the contributions
Adding the contributions from all categories:
\[
H = 0.3528 + 0.8889 + 0.6448 + 0.1436 \approx 2.03 \, \text{bits}
\]

### Final Answer:
The entropy rate of the random walk is approximately **2.03 bits**, which corresponds to option **B**.
