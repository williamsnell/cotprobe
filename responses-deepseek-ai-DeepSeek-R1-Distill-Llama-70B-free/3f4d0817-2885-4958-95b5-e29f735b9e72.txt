Okay, so I have this statistics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that X follows a normal distribution with a mean of 9 and a standard deviation of 3. I need to find the probability that X is between 5 and 11, so P(5 < X < 11). Hmm, right.

First, I remember that for normal distributions, probabilities are found using the Z-score formula. The Z-score tells us how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean. The formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

So, I need to calculate the Z-scores for both 5 and 11. Let's start with X=5. Plugging into the formula: Z = (5 - 9)/3. That gives ( -4 ) / 3 = approximately -1.333. Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 5 minus 9 is indeed -4, divided by 3 is -1.333... So Z1 is about -1.33.

Next, for X=11: Z = (11 - 9)/3. That's (2)/3 = 0.666... So Z2 is approximately 0.6667.

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is between -1.33 and 0.6667. To do this, I can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator. But since I don't have a table in front of me, I'll try to remember how to approach this.

The probability P(a < Z < b) is equal to the cumulative probability up to b minus the cumulative probability up to a. So, P(-1.33 < Z < 0.6667) = Φ(0.6667) - Φ(-1.33), where Φ is the cumulative distribution function.

I think Φ(0.6667) is about 0.7475, but wait, let me think. The standard normal table gives the area to the left of Z. For Z=0.67 (approximately 0.6667), the value is around 0.7486. But wait, sometimes tables are precise to two decimal places. Let me try to recall better. For Z=0.66, Φ is 0.7454, and for Z=0.67, it's about 0.7486. So since 0.6667 is about two-thirds between 0.66 and 0.67, maybe I can interpolate. Let's say approximately 0.7454 + (2/3)*(0.7486 - 0.7454). The difference is about 0.0032. Two-thirds of that is roughly 0.0021. So Φ(0.6667) ≈ 0.7454 + 0.0021 = 0.7475.

Then for Φ(-1.33), since the standard normal is symmetric, Φ(-z) = 1 - Φ(z). So Φ(-1.33) would be 1 - Φ(1.33). Looking up Φ(1.33), which I think is about 0.9082. So 1 - 0.9082 is 0.0918. Wait, wait. Alternatively, I remember that for Z=-1.33, the area to the left is about 0.0918 (since 1.33 corresponds to 0.9082, so the left tail is 0.0918).

Putting it together: 0.7475 (for 0.6667) minus 0.0918 (for -1.33) equals approximately 0.7475 - 0.0918 = 0.6557.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again. Maybe I should be more precise. Another approach is to use a calculator for the Z-scores. Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact values from the standard normal table.

Wait, let me think about the exact calculation. Let me get the exact Φ values.

For Z = 0.67, Φ is approximately 0.7486. For Z = -1.33, Φ is the area to the left of -1.33. The area to the left of Z=-1.33 is the same as 1 minus the area to the left of Z=1.33. Looking up Z=1.33, which is 1.33 in the standard table. I think that's around 0.9082, so 1 - 0.9082 = 0.0918.

So Φ(0.67) = 0.7486, Φ(-1.33) = 0.0918. So the difference is 0.7486 - 0.0918 = 0.6568. Hmm, wait, that's close to 0.6568. Looking at the options, let me check what's available.

The options are:

A: -.09176 → Negative probability? That doesn't make sense. So probably not.

B: .21185 → Maybe, but I got around 0.6568, so not this.

C: .37748 → Hmm, no.

D: .55962 → No, higher than that.

E: .65361 → Oh, that's very close to my 0.6568. The slight difference could be due to rounding errors.

F: .09176 → Too small.

G: .92715 → That's higher than my result.

H: .47568 → No.

I: .81743 → No.

J: .74537 → Hmm, that's higher than my 0.6568.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my Z-scores or in the subtraction. Let me double-check.

Wait, X is between 5 and 11. The mean is 9, so 5 is 4 below the mean, 11 is 2 above. So in terms of Z-scores: (5-9)/3 = (-4)/3 ≈ -1.333, which is correct. (11-9)/3=2/3≈0.6667, correct.

So the area is between Z=-1.333 and Z=0.6667. So Φ(0.6667) - Φ(-1.333) = ?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question expects me to use more precise Z-values. Let me use exact calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the 68-95-99.7 rule, but that's more for approximations. Wait, 1 sigma is about 68%, 2 sigma 95%, 3 sigma 99.7%. But since 5 is 1.333 sigma below, and 11 is 0.6667 sigma above. So the area between them would include the mean, so perhaps using symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute each tail and subtract from 1. Wait, but the way I did it before seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact Z-scores more precisely. Let me think: For Z=0.67, Φ is 0.7486. But for Z=0.6667, which is 2/3, perhaps the exact value is closer to 0.7475 or so.

Wait, maybe using the standard normal distribution function in a calculator would give a more precise value. Let me imagine I'm using a calculator.

So, Φ(0.6667) is P(Z < 0.6667). Let's compute that. I think it's about 0.7475. Similarly, Φ(-1.333) is P(Z < -1.333), which is about 0.0918.

So 0.7475 - 0.0918 = 0.6557. So approximately 0.6557, which is 0.656. Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 0.65361, which is about 0.6536. That's very close. So perhaps the exact calculation using precise Z-scores would give 0.6536, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard normal table gives more precise values. For example, Z=0.67 is 0.7486, Z=0.66 is 0.7454. So 0.6667 is two-thirds between 0.66 and 0.67. The difference between 0.7454 and 0.7486 is 0.0032. Two-thirds of that is 0.0021. So 0.7454 + 0.0021 = 0.7475.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps using more precise Z-scores.

Wait, let me think about using the empirical rule. No, that's more for checking, but for exact values, I need the standard normal table.

Alternatively, maybe the exact value is computed using a calculator function. Let me imagine that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the error function, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to realize that the problem is symmetric, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the area between Z=-1.33 and Z=0.67.

So the total area under the standard normal curve is 1. The area to the left of -1.33 is 0.0918. The area to the left of 0.67 is 0.7486. So the area between them is 0.7486 - 0.0918 = 0.6568.

So 0.6568 is approximately 0.6568, which is about 0.657. Looking at the options, option E is 0.65361, which is close. Option G is 0.92715, which is higher. Option D is 0.55962, lower. So the closest is E.

Wait, but perhaps the Z-scores were meant to be calculated more precisely. For example, (5-9)/3 is exactly -1.3333..., and (11-9)/3 is 0.666666...

Looking up Z=-1.3333 in the standard table. Let me see, standard tables usually go to two decimal places, but sometimes have more precise values. So for Z=-1.33, the area is 0.0918, and for Z=-1.34, perhaps it's 0.0901. So maybe for Z=-1.3333, the area is approximately 0.0918 - (0.0918 - 0.0901)*(0.0033/0.01). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the area is approximately 0.0918.

Similarly, for Z=0.6667, the exact value would be between 0.7454 (Z=0.66) and 0.7486 (Z=0.67). So 0.6667 is 2/3 of the way from 0.66 to 0.67. So the corresponding Φ value would be 0.7454 + (0.7486 - 0.7454)*(2/3) = 0.7454 + (0.0032)*(0.6667) ≈ 0.7454 + 0.0021 = 0.7475.

So Φ(0.6667) ≈ 0.7475, Φ(-1.3333) ≈ 0.0918.

So the difference is 0.7475 - 0.0918 = 0.6557, which is approximately 0.6557.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E (0.65361) and option J (0.74537). Wait, no, option J is higher. So 0.6557 is approximately 0.656, which is closest to option E: 0.65361.

But wait, perhaps I should consider more precise Z-table values. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator function like NORMSDIST in Excel.

Wait, in Excel, NORMSDIST(0.6667) would give the exact value. Let me imagine using that. Let me think, NORMSDIST(0.67) is about 0.7486, NORMSDIST(0.6667) would be very slightly less. Let's say approximately 0.7475.

Similarly, NORMSDIST(-1.3333) would be 1 - NORMSDIST(1.3333). NORMSDIST(1.33) is about 0.9082, so NORMSDIST(-1.33) is 0.0918.

So subtracting, 0.7475 - 0.0918 = 0.6557.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator online, the exact value would be about 0.6554. So perhaps the exact answer is 0.6554, which is option E: 0.65361. Wait, that's a bit lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is phrased differently, but no—it's definitely asking for P(5 < X < 11).

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but I can't know that. So looking at the options again:

Option E is 0.65361, which is 0.6536. My calculation is 0.6557, which is 0.656. The difference is about 0.0021. Maybe the question expects rounding to four decimal places, but the options have five.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives 0.6536, which would match option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact Z-scores using more precise methods.

Wait, another way: Let's compute the Z-scores as exactly as possible.

Z1 = (5 - 9)/3 = (-4)/3 = -1.3333333...

Z2 = (11 - 9)/3 = 2/3 = 0.6666666...

Now, looking into standard normal distribution tables for more precise values. Let's say for Z= -1.33, the cumulative probability is 0.0918, as before. For Z=0.67, it's 0.7486.

Wait, but in reality, the exact value for Z=0.6667 would be a little less than 0.7486. So perhaps the precise value is around 0.7475, leading to 0.7475 - 0.0918 = 0.6557.

Wait, but the options don't include 0.6557. The closest is option E: 0.65361 and option G: 0.92715, which is much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the formula without approximations. But that's complicated without a calculator.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 0.65361, which is about 0.6536, and option G is 0.92715, which is much higher. Another thought: Did I make a mistake in considering the area between the Z-scores? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the area to the right of 5 and left of 11, which is the same as P(5 < X < 11). So the Z-scores are correct. The approach is correct.

Another possibility: Maybe I confused standard deviation with variance, but no, the problem states standard deviation is 3.

Wait, could I have swapped the Z-scores? Like, using 11 first and 5 after? No, because 11 is higher than the mean, so Z is positive, and 5 is lower, so Z is negative. So the calculation was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the calculator function more precisely. Let's imagine using a calculator:

For Z = 0.6667, the cumulative probability is approx 0.7475.

For Z = -1.3333, the cumulative probability is approx 0.0918.

Subtracting gives 0.7475 - 0.0918 = 0.6557.

Looking for the closest option, which is E: 0.65361. So maybe the exact calculation with more precise Z-scores gives 0.6536.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the standard deviation is 3, which I correctly used. So I think option E is the correct answer.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \( X \) follows a normal distribution with mean \( \mu = 9 \) and standard deviation \( \sigma = 3 \). We need to find \( P(5 < X < 11) \), which corresponds to the probability that \( X \) lies between 5 and 11.

### Step 1: Calculate the Z-scores
The Z-score formula is:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

For \( X = 5 \):
\[
Z_1 = \frac{5 - 9}{3} = \frac{-4}{3} \approx -1.333
\]

For \( X = 11 \):
\[
Z_2 = \frac{11 - 9}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667
\]

### Step 2: Use the standard normal distribution
The probability \( P(5 < X < 11) \) is equivalent to \( P(-1.333 < Z < 0.667) \), where \( Z \) is the standard normal variable. Using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator:

- \( P(Z < 0.667) \approx 0.7475 \)
- \( P(Z < -1.333) \approx 0.0918 \)

The probability between the two Z-scores is:

\[
P(-1.333 < Z < 0.667) = P(Z < 0.667) - P(Z < -1.333)
\]

\[
P(-1.333 < Z < 0.667) \approx 0.7475 - 0.0918 = 0.6557
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated probability \( 0.6557 \) is closest to option \( E: 0.65361 \). The slight difference is likely due to rounding or slight variations in the standard normal table.

### Final Answer:
**E**

The answer is **E**.
