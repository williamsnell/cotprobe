Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance."
Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about Mao Zedong's view on agricultural cooperation and which ideological influence it reflects. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

So, the passage is from Mao's "On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation" in 1955. He's talking about the countryside where capitalism is growing, with some peasants becoming rich while others remain poor. He's worried that if this continues, there will be more polarization, and poor peasants might blame the party for not helping them. He also mentions that the alliance between workers and peasants might not hold if things go on like this. His solution is to bring about socialist transformation in agriculture, along with industrialization and transforming handicrafts and capitalist industries. He suggests cooperation to eliminate the rich peasant economy and individual farming so that everyone can prosper together.

Now, the question is asking which of the given options most directly reflects the influence on Mao's view here. The options are from A to J, each representing different ideologies or figures.

Let me think about Mao's context. He was a Marxist, specifically a Marxist-Leninist, but with his own adaptations, known as Maoism. In this passage, he's discussing the need to prevent capitalist tendencies and instead push for socialist cooperation and collectivization in agriculture. This aligns with the Marxist idea of class struggle and the transition from capitalism to socialism.

Looking at the options:

A: Joseph Stalin's communism. Stalin's policies in the USSR involved forced collectivization of agriculture. Mao's approach here seems similar, pushing for cooperative farms to eliminate individual land ownership and prevent a capitalist class from forming. So this could be a match.

B: Salvador Allende's democratic socialism. Allende was a Chilean socialist who believed in a more democratic approach, not as radical as Mao's collectivization. Probably not.

C: Bernie Sanders' social democracy. Sanders advocates for a mixed economy with social welfare, not the elimination of individual farming. So no.

D: Globalization via NAFTA or EU. These are about free trade and economic blocs, not related to agricultural collectivization. Not relevant.

E: Religious fundamentalism, like Khomeini. Not related at all.

F: Milton Friedman's capitalist theory. Friedman is a free-market economist, opposite of Mao's ideas here.

G: Adam Smith's classical liberalism. Smith's ideas are about free markets and individual enterprise, which Mao is opposing.

H: Nationalist populism. Populism is more about national identity and sometimes economic protectionism, but not directly about collectivizing agriculture.

I: Enlightenment ideals via Robespierre. Robespierre was part of the French Revolution, more about political revolution, not specifically about agricultural collectivization.

J: Fascism as per Mussolini. Fascist economic policies might involve some state control, but not the same as socialist collectivization aimed at class equality.

So the most relevant influence here is Stalin's approach to collectivization. Mao's proposal to eliminate individual economies and rich peasants through cooperation mirrors the Soviet model under Stalin, where collectivization was enforced to rapidly transform agriculture towards socialism.

Therefore, the answer should be A.

The passage by Mao Zedong discusses the need to prevent capitalist tendencies in the countryside and promote socialist transformation through agricultural cooperation and collectivization. This approach aligns with Marxist-Leninist principles, particularly the Soviet model under Joseph Stalin, who enforced collectivization to eliminate individual farming and prevent the rise of a capitalist class. Among the options provided, Stalin's ideals of communism most directly reflect Mao's perspective.

Answer: A
