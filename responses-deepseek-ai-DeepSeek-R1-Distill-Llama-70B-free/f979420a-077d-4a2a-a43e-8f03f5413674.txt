Okay, so I'm trying to solve this heat transfer problem. Let me read the question carefully.

We have a copper sphere and a copper cube. Both have a radius/side length of 2 inches. They're heated to 1250°F and then exposed to air at 210°F. The surface film coefficient is 12 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. I need to find their temperatures after 10 minutes. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when objects are exposed to a surrounding temperature, they cool down over time. This is a transient heat transfer problem, probably involving Newton's Law of Cooling. But wait, Newton's Law is for lumped capacitance, right? So I think the lumped capacitance method applies here because the objects are small and made of a material with high thermal conductivity, like copper.

The formula for lumped capacitance is:

(T(t) - T_surrounding) / (T_initial - T_surrounding) = exp(-t / τ)

Where τ is the time constant, which is (ρ * V / A) / h. Wait, no, the time constant is the product of the material's thermal capacity (rho * volume * specific heat) divided by the surface area multiplied by the convection coefficient. Or wait, τ = (rho * V * c_p) / (h * A). Yeah, that's right.

So for each shape, sphere and cube, I need to calculate their respective time constants and then apply the formula to find the temperature after 10 minutes.

Let's start with the properties. Copper has a density, right? I think it's around 560 lbm/ft³. Wait, no, wait, maybe it's 532 lbm/ft³? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, I remember that the density of copper is about 8.96 g/cm³, which converts to 560 lbm/ft³. Yeah, because 1 lbm is about 0.453 kg, and 1 ft³ is 0.028 m³. Let me double-check that but I'll go with 560 lbm/ft³ for now.

The specific heat of copper is about 0.092 Btu/lbm·°F. Okay, I remember that from previous problems.

The surface area and volume will differ between the sphere and the cube. The sphere has radius 2 inches, which is 2/12 = 1/6 ft or 0.1667 ft. The cube has a side length of 2 inches, which is 2/12 = 1/6 ft as well. Wait, no, the cube's side is 2 inches, same as the sphere's radius.

Wait, no, the sphere has radius 2 inches, so diameter is 4 inches. The cube has side 2 inches, so each edge is 2 inches. So their volumes and surface areas will be different.

Let me calculate the volume and surface area for each shape.

First, sphere. Volume of a sphere is (4/3)π r³. The radius is 2 inches, which is 0.1667 ft. So r = 0.1667 ft.

Volume_sphere = (4/3) * π * (0.1667)^3.

Let me calculate that. 0.1667 cubed is about 0.00463. Multiply by 4/3 * π. 4/3 is about 1.333, so 1.333 * 3.1416 is about 4.1888. Then 4.1888 * 0.00463 = approximately 0.01936 ft³.

Surface area of a sphere is 4π r². So 4 * π * (0.1667)^2. (0.1667)^2 is about 0.02778. Multiply by 4π gives around 0.3491 ft².

Now the cube. Volume_cube is side^3. Side is 2 inches = 0.1667 ft. So 0.1667^3 is about 0.00463 ft³, same as the sphere's volume. Wait, no, the sphere's volume was 0.01936? Wait no, wait: the sphere's radius is 2 inches, so diameter 4 inches. The cube's side is 2 inches. So the sphere is larger in size than the cube? Wait, wait, no: the radius is 2 inches, so diameter is 4 inches, so the sphere is bigger than the cube which is 2 inches on each side. So the sphere's volume should be larger than the cube's. But wait, in my calculations, both volumes are about 0.0046 ft³, which can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, sphere's radius is 2 inches, which is 0.1667 ft. So volume is (4/3)π (0.1667)^3. Let me compute that again. 0.1667^3 is (approx) 0.00463 ft³. Multiply by 4/3 * π. 4/3 is about 1.3333, so 1.3333 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.1888. 4.1888 * 0.00463 ≈ 0.01936 ft³.

Cube's volume is (0.1667)^3 = 0.00463 ft³. So the sphere has a larger volume than the cube. So their volumes are different. That's correct.

Now, surface areas. Sphere's surface area is 4π r². r=0.1667 ft, so r squared is 0.02778 ft². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 * 0.02778 ≈ 0.3491 ft². Cube's surface area is 6 * side². Side is 0.1667 ft, so side squared is 0.02778 ft², multiplied by 6 gives 0.1667 ft².

So for the sphere: V = 0.01936 ft³, A = 0.3491 ft².

For the cube: V = 0.00463 ft³, A = 0.1667 ft².

Now, time constant τ is (rho * V * c_p) / (h * A).

Wait, rho is density, V is volume, c_p specific heat, h is the convection coefficient.

Given: h = 12 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

So for each shape:

τ_sphere = (rho * V_sphere * c_p) / (h * A_sphere)

Similarly for the cube.

Let me compute τ for both.

First, rho is 560 lbm/ft³, c_p is 0.092 Btu/lbm·°F.

So, for sphere:

τ_sphere = (560 * 0.01936 * 0.092) / (12 * 0.3491)

Compute numerator: 560 * 0.01936 = let's calculate 560 * 0.02 is 11.2, but a bit less. 0.01936 is 0.02 - 0.00064.

560 * 0.01936 = 560*(0.02 - 0.00064) = 11.2 - (560 * 0.00064) = 11.2 - 0.3584 = 10.8416. Then multiply by 0.092: 10.8416 * 0.092 ≈ 1.0 (10 *0.092=0.92, 0.8416*0.092≈0.0774, so total ~0.9974 ≈1.0 approximately.

Denominator: 12 * 0.3491 = 4.1892.

So τ_sphere ≈ 1.0 /4.1892 ≈ 0.2388 hours.

Wait, because the time is in hours, right? Because the units of h are Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

So τ_sphere is approximately 0.2388 hours.

Wait, but 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, which is approximately 0.1667 hours.

So the exponent in the lumped capacitance formula is (-t/τ). So for the sphere, t is 10 minutes = 1/6 hour. So t/τ is (1/6) / 0.2388 ≈ (0.1667)/(0.2388) ≈ 0.697.

So the exponent is -0.697.

So the temperature difference ratio is exp(-0.697). Let me compute that. e^-0.7 is about 0.4966.

Now, the initial temperature is 1250°F, surrounding is 210°F.

So (T_sphere - 210) = (1250 -210) * exp(-0.697) → 1040 * 0.4966 ≈ 516. So T_sphere ≈ 210 + 516 ≈ 726°F.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. 0.697 is closer to 0.7, so exp(-0.697) is approximately 0.496, yes. So 1040 * 0.496 = let's see: 1000 *0.496=496, 40*0.496=19.84, so total 515.84. So T_sph ≈ 210 + 515.84 = 725.84°F, approximately 726°F. Looking at the options, option H is 725°F for the sphere.

Now for the cube.

Compute τ_cube = (rho * V_cube * c_p) / (h * A_cube)

So rho is 560 lbm/ft³, V_cube is 0.00463 ft³, c_p 0.092, h 12, A_cube 0.1667 ft².

Numerator: 560 * 0.00463 = let's calculate 560 * 0.004 = 2.24, 560 * 0.00063 = 0.3528 → total 2.24 + 0.3528 = 2.5928. Multiply by 0.092 → 2.5928 *0.092 = let's compute 2 *0.092=0.184, 0.5928 *0.092 ≈ 0.0545. So total ≈0.2385.

Denominator: 12 * 0.1667 = 2.0004.

So τ_cube ≈ 0.2385 / 2.0004 ≈ 0.1192 hours.

Time t is 10 minutes = 1/6 hour ≈ 0.1667 hours.

So t/τ_cube = 0.1667 / 0.1192 ≈ 1.398.

Exponent is -1.398.

Compute exp(-1.398). Let me think. e^-1 is 0.3679, e^-1.4 is approximately 0.2466. So exp(-1.398) ≈ 0.247.

So the temperature difference ratio is 0.247.

(T_cube - 210) = (1250 - 210)*0.247 → 1040 *0.247 ≈ 257. So T_cube ≈ 210 + 257 = 467°F.

Wait, 1040 * 0.247 = let's compute 1000 *0.247=247, 40 *0.247=9.88 → total 256.88. So T_cube is 210 + 256.88 = 466.88, about 467°F.

Looking at the options, option H is Sphere:725°F, Cube:467°F. So that's option H.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, when I calculated the sphere's time constant, I had:

Numerator: 560 * 0.01936 = let me compute accurately.

0.01936 ft³ is volume for sphere. 560 lbm/ft³ * 0.01936 ft³ = 560 * 0.01936.

0.01936 * 560 = 10.8416 lbm.

Multiply by c_p 0.092: 10.8416 * 0.092 = let me compute 10 * 0.092 = 0.92, 0.8416 * 0.092 ≈ 0.0774. So total 0.9974 ≈1.0.

Denominator: 12 * 0.3491 = 4.1892.

So τ_sphere = 1.0 /4.1892 ≈0.2388 hr.

Similarly for cube:

V_cube = 0.00463 ft³.

560 * 0.00463 = 2.5928 lbm.

*0.092 → 2.5928 * 0.092 = let's compute 2 * 0.092=0.184, 0.5928 *0.092 = 0.0546. So 0.2386.

Denominator: 12 *0.1667 = 2.0004.

So τ_cube = 0.2386 / 2.0004 ≈0.1192 hr.

Yes, that seems correct.

So for sphere, t/τ = (1/6)/0.2388 ≈0.1667/0.2388≈0.697.

Exp(-0.697) → approximately 0.496.

So T_sph = 210 + (1040 * 0.496) → 210 + 516 →726°F.

For cube, t/τ =0.1667/0.1192≈1.398.

Exp(-1.398)=0.247.

So T_cube = 210 + (1040 *0.247) → 210 + 257 →467°F.

Looking at the options, option H is Sphere:725°F, Cube:467°F.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we use the lumped capacitance method, which applies to small objects with high thermal conductivity, such as copper. The temperature evolution is governed by:

\[
\frac{T(t) - T_{\text{surrounding}}}{T_{\text{initial}} - T_{\text{surrounding}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right)
\]

where \(\tau = \frac{\rho V c_p}{h A}\) is the time constant, and \(t\) is the time in hours. The given parameters are:

- Initial temperature: \(T_{\text{initial}} = 1250^\circ\text{F}\)
- Surrounding temperature: \(T_{\text{surrounding}} = 210^\circ\text{F}\)
- Surface film coefficient: \(h = 12 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2·^\circ\text{F}\)
- Copper properties: \(\rho = 560 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3\), \(c_p = 0.092 \, \text{Btu/lbm·}^\circ\text{F}\)
- Dimensions: Sphere radius = 2 inches = \(0.1667 \, \text{ft}\), Cube side = 2 inches = \(0.1667 \, \text{ft}\)

### Step 1: Calculate volume and surface area for sphere and cube
- **Sphere**:
  - Volume: \(V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.1667)^3 \approx 0.01936 \, \text{ft}^3\)
  - Surface area: \(A_{\text{sphere}} = 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi (0.1667)^2 \approx 0.3491 \, \text{ft}^2\)
- **Cube**:
  - Volume: \(V_{\text{cube}} = \text{side}^3 = (0.1667)^3 \approx 0.00463 \, \text{ft}^3\)
  - Surface area: \(A_{\text{cube}} = 6 \times \text{side}^2 = 6 \times (0.1667)^2 \approx 0.1667 \, \text{ft}^2\)

### Step 2: Calculate time constants (\(\tau\)) for sphere and cube
- **Sphere**:
  \[
  \tau_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{\rho V_{\text{sphere}} c_p}{h A_{\text{sphere}}} = \frac{560 \cdot 0.01936 \cdot 0.092}{12 \cdot 0.3491} \approx 0.2388 \, \text{hours}
  \]
- **Cube**:
  \[
  \tau_{\text{cube}} = \frac{\rho V_{\text{cube}} c_p}{h A_{\text{cube}}} = \frac{560 \cdot 0.00463 \cdot 0.092}{12 \cdot 0.1667} \approx 0.1192 \, \text{hours}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate temperatures after 10 minutes (\(t = \frac{1}{6} \, \text{hours}\))
- **Sphere**:
  \[
  \frac{T_{\text{sphere}} - 210}{1250 - 210} = \exp\left(-\frac{1/6}{0.2388}\right) \approx \exp(-0.697) \approx 0.496
  \]
  \[
  T_{\text{sphere}} \approx 210 + (1040 \cdot 0.496) \approx 210 + 516 \approx 726^\circ\text{F}
  \]
- **Cube**:
  \[
  \frac{T_{\text{cube}} - 210}{1250 - 210} = \exp\left(-\frac{1/6}{0.1192}\right) \approx \exp(-1.398) \approx 0.247
  \]
  \[
  T_{\text{cube}} \approx 210 + (1040 \cdot 0.247) \approx 210 + 257 \approx 467^\circ\text{F}
  \]

### Final Answer
The temperature of the sphere is approximately \(725^\circ\text{F}\), and the temperature of the cube is approximately \(467^\circ\text{F}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**H: Sphere: 725°F, Cube: 467°F**
