Okay, so I've got this question about Homo floresiensis and which species it's related to. Hmm, I remember that Homo floresiensis is also called the "Hobbit" because it's a small-brained species, right? They were found on the island of Flores in Indonesia.

The question gives a time frame of around 35,000 to 14,000 years ago. That's during the late Pleistocene era, if I'm not mistaken. Now, thinking about human evolution, I recall that different Homo species have different time ranges.

The options are A through J, each a different species. Let's go through them:

A: Homo neanderthalensis. Oh, Neanderthals. They lived around the same time as H. floresiensis, I think. But are they related? I remember Neanderthals are more closely related to modern humans and are part of the same genus but a different species.

B: Australopithecus afarensis. That's like Lucy, right? Much older, around 3-4 million years ago. So probably not related to H. floresiensis which is more recent.

C: Australopithecus africanus. Also an earlier species, around 2-3 million years ago. Not related to the more recent Homo species.

D: Homo naledi. Naledi is interesting because it was discovered more recently, but I think they might have lived around the same time as early Homo species, maybe up to 300,000 years ago. Not sure how they relate to H. floresiensis.

E: Homo habilis. One of the earliest Homo species, around 2.8-1.4 million years ago. Probably too early to be directly related to H. floresiensis.

F: Homo ergaster. Another early Homo, around 1.9-1.4 million years ago. Again, too early.

G: Neanderthals. Same as option A, so same reasoning applies.

H: Homo sapiens. That's us, modern humans. Could H. floresiensis be related? I think they are a distinct species but within the Homo genus, so maybe a distant relative.

I: Homo erectus. H. erectus lived from about 1.8 million to 70,000 years ago. So their time overlaps with the earlier part of H. floresiensis's existence. I think H. erectus is thought to have given rise to some other species, maybe including H. floresiensis. Oh wait, I remember that H. erectus is considered a direct ancestor of H. sapiens, but perhaps on Flores, they evolved into H. floresiensis due to island isolation.

J: Homo heidelbergensis. This species lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. They're thought to be the common ancestor of both Neanderthals and modern humans. But H. floresiensis is much younger, so maybe not directly related.

So putting it together, H. floresiensis is likely related to H. erectus. Because H. erectus was around earlier, and on Flores, they might have evolved into H. floresiensis due to the island environment. So the correct answer would be I: Homo erectus.

Wait, but I also remember some theories suggesting that H. floresiensis might have descended from H. habilis or even earlier species, but I think the more accepted view is that they came from H. erectus. So I'll go with I.

Homo floresiensis, discovered on the island of Flores, is a small-brained species that lived from approximately 35,000 to 14,000 years ago. Among the given options, the most plausible relative is Homo erectus. Homo erectus lived from about 1.8 million to 70,000 years ago and is considered a key ancestor in the Homo genus. The isolation of Flores likely led to the evolution of H. floresiensis from a population of H. erectus that became stranded on the island. Other options, such as Neanderthals or Homo sapiens, are less likely due to differences in time frames or evolutionary relationships. Thus, the correct answer is:

I: Homo erectus.

Answer: I
