Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: A glass contains 0.25 kg of Omni-Cola, which is mostly water, initially at 25°C. I need to find out how much ice, initially at -20°C, must be added to get a final temperature of 0°C with all the ice melted. The unit is grams, and I have to choose from options A to J. Also, I can neglect the heat capacity of the glass, so I don't have to worry about that part.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with heat transfer between substances, the heat lost by the warmer substance equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But wait, in this case, the ice is the cooler substance, and the Omni-Cola is the warmer. So the heat lost by the Omni-Cola will be used to warm the ice and then melt it.

Hmm, but wait, the final temperature is 0°C, which means that the Omni-Cola will cool down from 25°C to 0°C, and the ice will warm from -20°C to 0°C, and then melt into water at 0°C.

So I need to calculate the heat lost by the Omni-Cola as it cools down, and the heat gained by the ice as it warms up and melts. The sum of the heat gained by the ice (warming and melting) should equal the heat lost by the Omni-Cola.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the final temperature is 0°C, and the ice has to melt, the heat from the Omni-Cola will go into two parts: warming the ice to 0°C and then melting it. So I need to account for both the specific heat of ice as it warms and the latent heat of fusion when it melts.

Let me recall the specific heat capacities. For water, the specific heat is about 4186 J/kg·°C, and for ice, I think it's about 2100 J/kg·°C. The latent heat of fusion for ice is around 334,000 J/kg. Let me make sure I remember that right—wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think the latent heat of fusion is about 334 J/g, or 334,000 J/kg. Yes, that's correct.

So the plan is:

1. Calculate the heat released by the Omni-Cola (which is water) as it cools from 25°C to 0°C.
2. Calculate the heat required to warm the ice from -20°C to 0°C.
3. Calculate the heat required to melt the ice into water at 0°C.
4. Sum steps 2 and 3 to get the total heat gained by the ice.
5. Set the heat lost by the Omni-Cola equal to the heat gained by the ice, and solve for the mass of the ice.

Let me write the equations for each part.

Heat lost by Omni-Cola (Q1) is mass (m) times specific heat (c_water) times the temperature change (ΔT). So:

Q1 = m_omni * c_water * (T_initial - T_final)
Q1 = 0.25 kg * 4186 J/kg·°C * (25°C - 0°C)
Q1 = 0.25 * 4186 * 25
Let me compute that. 0.25 * 25 is 6.25, so 6.25 * 4186. Hmm, 4186 * 6 = 25116, and 4186 * 0.25 is 1046.5. So total is 25116 + 1046.5 = 26162.5 J.

Wait, maybe better to compute it step by step. 0.25 * 4186 is 1046.5, then multiply by 25: 1046.5 *25 = 26162.5 J. That's 26,162.5 Joules.

Now, for the ice. Let's let m be the mass of the ice in kg.

Heat required to warm the ice from -20°C to 0°C (Q2) is:

Q2 = m * c_ice * (0 - (-20)) = m * 2100 * 20.

So Q2 = m * 2100 * 20 = m * 42000 J/kg.

Then, the heat required to melt the ice (Q3) is:

Q3 = m * L_fusion = m * 334,000 J/kg.

So the total heat gained by the ice is Q2 + Q3 = m * (42000 + 334000) = m * 376000 J/kg.

Wait, but wait, because the ice comes into the system, the heat it absorbs is positive, and the heat the Omni-Cola loses is negative. So the equation should be:

Q1 = Q2 + Q3.

So 26162.5 J = m * 376000 J/kg.

Solving for m:

m = 26162.5 / 376000 ≈ Let me compute this.

Let me compute 26162.5 ÷ 376000.

Hmm, 376000 is 376,000.

26162.5 ÷ 376000 = approximately?

Well, let's do the division. 376000 goes into 26162.5 how many times?

Let me compute 26162.5 /376000.

Let me compute 26162.5 / 376000 = approx 0.0695 kg.

Because 376000 * 0.07 = 26320, which is a bit higher than 26162.5. So 0.07 kg is 70 grams, but since 0.07 * 376000 is 26320, which is a bit more than 26162.5, so 0.0695 kg is approximately 69.5 grams, so about 70 grams.

Looking at the options, option C is 70, option H is 60, which is lower, so 70 would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Let me recompute Q1:

Q1 = 0.25 kg * 4186 J/kg°C * 25°C.

0.25 *4186 = 1046.5 J/°C.

Multiply by 25°C: 1046.5 *25 = Let me compute 1000*25=25,000, 46.5*25=1,162.5. So 25,000 +1,162.5=26,162.5 J. That's correct.

Q2: m *2100 *20 = m *42,000 J.

Q3: m *334,000 J.

Total Q = m*(42,000 +334,000) = m*376,000 J.

So 26,162.5 = m *376,000 → m=26,162.5 /376,000.

Let me compute 26,162.5 ÷376,000.

Well, 376,000 is 376 *1e3.

Let me compute 26162.5 ÷376000 = (26162.5 /1000) / (376) → 26.1625 / 376.

26.1625 divided by 376.

Hmm, 376 *0.07 is 26.32. Because 376 *0.07 = (300 *0.07) + (76 *0.07) → 21 +5.32=26.32.

Ah, so 26.1625 is less than 26.32, so m is approximately 0.0695 kg, which is 69.5 grams. So approximately 70 grams.

Looking at the options, 70 is option C.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see.

Wait, 376 *0.0695 = ?

Wait, 0.0695 *376 = ?

Compute 0.06 *376 =22.56, 0.0095 *376=3.572. So 22.56 +3.572=26.132. Which is very close to 26.1625. So m=0.0695 kg is correct. So 69.5 grams, which would round to approximately 70 grams. So the correct option is C:70.

Wait, but let me think again: does the ice melt completely? Yes, the question says all the ice must melt, so the final state is all water at 0°C.

Wait, but wait another thing: I might have made a miscalculation in the specific heat of ice. I think the specific heat of ice is 2100 J/kg·K, which is correct, yes. And the latent heat of fusion is 334,000 J/kg. Yes.

So the setup is correct. So the answer should be approximately 70 grams, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the heat lost by the Omni-Cola as it cools from 25°C to 0°C and equate it to the heat gained by the ice as it warms from -20°C to 0°C and then melts. The heat transfer equation is:

\[
Q_{\text{lost by Omni-Cola}} = Q_{\text{gained by ice}}
\]

### Step 1: Heat lost by Omni-Cola
The heat released by the Omni-Cola is given by:

\[
Q_1 = m_{\text{Omni-Cola}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
Q_1 = 0.25 \, \text{kg} \cdot 4186 \, \text{J/kg°C} \cdot (25°C - 0°C)
\]
\[
Q_1 = 0.25 \cdot 4186 \cdot 25 = 26,162.5 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Heat gained by ice
The ice first warms from -20°C to 0°C, and then melts. The total heat required is:

\[
Q_2 + Q_3 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot c_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta T + m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L_{\text{fusion}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
Q_2 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 2100 \, \text{J/kg°C} \cdot (0°C - (-20°C)) = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 2100 \cdot 20 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 42,000 \, \text{J}
\]
\[
Q_3 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 334,000 \, \text{J/kg}
\]
\[
Q_2 + Q_3 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot (42,000 + 334,000) = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 376,000 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the mass of ice
Equating the heat lost by the Omni-Cola to the heat gained by the ice:

\[
Q_1 = Q_2 + Q_3
\]
\[
26,162.5 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 376,000
\]

Solving for \(m_{\text{ice}}\):

\[
m_{\text{ice}} = \frac{26,162.5}{376,000} \approx 0.0695 \, \text{kg} = 69.5 \, \text{g}
\]

### Final Answer
The mass of ice required is approximately **70 g**, which corresponds to option **C**.
