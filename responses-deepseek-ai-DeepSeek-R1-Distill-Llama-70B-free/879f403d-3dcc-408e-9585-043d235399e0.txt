Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about a bicycle's gears and sprockets. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when two gears are connected, their angular velocities are related by the ratio of their radii or the number of teeth. But wait, in this case, the front sprocket is connected to the rear sprocket via a chain, right? So, they must have the same tangential speed where the chain touches them. Oh, right, because the chain moves at the same speed for both sprockets.

Wait, the problem gives me the angular speed of the front sprocket, which is 0.6 rev/s. I think I should convert that into radians per second because when dealing with tangential velocity, the formula uses radians. Oh wait, no, the formula v = rω can use either as long as units are consistent. Hmm, but maybe I'll stick with SI units to be safe.

The front sprocket's radius is 12.0 cm, which is 0.12 meters. So the tangential speed at the edge of the front sprocket would be v = r * ω. Let's calculate that. But wait, the units for ω are rev per second. I know that 1 rev is 2π radians. So I should convert ω to rad/s first.

So ω = 0.6 rev/s * 2π rad/rev = 1.2π rad/s. Approximately 3.7699 rad/s. But maybe I can keep it as 1.2π for exactness.

Then, the tangential speed v_front = r_front * ω = 0.12 m * 1.2π rad/s. Let me compute that. 0.12 *1.2 is 0.144, so 0.144π m/s. That's about 0.144 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.4524 m/s.

Wait, but the chain's speed must be the same, right? So the tangential speed at the rear sprocket where the chain touches should be the same as v_front. Because the chain can't stretch, so each point on it moves at the same speed. So the rear sprocket's tangential speed is 0.4524 m/s.

But wait, the problem states that the tangential speed of a point on the rim of the rear wheel is 5 m/s. That's different because the rear wheel's radius is given as 0.330 m. So the rear wheel's tangential speed is v_rear_wheel = r_rear_wheel * ω_rear_wheel.

Wait, but the rear sprocket is attached to the rear axle, so the rear sprocket and the rear wheel must have the same angular velocity. Because they're connected; the sprocket is fixed to the axle, so when the sprocket turns, the wheel turns with it. So the angular velocity of the rear sprocket equals that of the rear wheel.

So, the tangential speed of the rear wheel's rim is v_rear_wheel = r_rear_wheel * ω_rear.

We know v_rear_wheel is 5 m/s, and r_rear_wheel is 0.330 m. So we can find ω_rear.

ω_rear = v_rear_wheel / r_rear_wheel = 5 / 0.330 ≈ 15.1515 rad/s.

But wait, earlier we found that the tangential speed of the rear sprocket (where the chain meets it) is 0.4524 m/s. That's because v_rear_sprocket = r_rear_sprocket * ω_rear_sprocket.

Wait, no, the rear sprocket's angular velocity is the same as the rear wheel's, because they're connected. So the tangential speed at the edge of the rear sprocket is v_rear_sprocket = r_rear_sprocket * ω_rear.

But we know that the chain's speed is the same as v_front and as v_rear_sprocket. So:

v_front = v_rear_sprocket.

So, 0.4524 m/s = r_rear_sprocket * ω_rear.

We just found ω_rear as 5 / 0.330 ≈ 15.1515 rad/s.

So, r_rear_sprocket = v_rear_sprocket / ω_rear = 0.4524 / 15.1515 ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute that.

0.4524 divided by 15.1515.

Let me compute 0.4524 / 15.1515.

15.1515 * 0.03 is 0.4545. Oh wait, so 0.03 m is 3 cm. Wait, but 0.03 is 3 cm, which is 3.00 cm. But that would make the radius 3.00 cm. Let me check the options, option A is 3.50, option D is 2.99, which is almost 3, and option B is 2.00. So maybe 3 cm is the answer, but it's not an option. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the relation wrong. Let me think again.

The front sprocket and the rear sprocket are connected by a chain. So the linear speed at their edges (tangential speed) must be the same. So v_front_edge = v_rear_edge.

v_front_edge is r_front * ω_front.

v_rear_edge is r_rear * ω_rear.

So, r_front * ω_front = r_rear * ω_rear.

But the rear sprocket is connected to the rear wheel, so ω_rear is the same as the wheel's angular velocity.

But the wheel's tangential speed is v_wheel = r_wheel * ω_rear = 5 m/s.

So from this, ω_rear = 5 / r_wheel.

r_wheel is 0.330 m, so ω_rear = 5 / 0.330 ≈ 15.1515 rad/s.

So substituting back into the chain speed equation: r_front * ω_front = r_rear * ω_rear.

We need to find r_rear.

So r_rear = (r_front * ω_front) / ω_rear.

We have r_front = 12 cm = 0.12 m.

ω_front is given as 0.6 rev/s. But we need to convert that to rad/s.

ω_front = 0.6 rev/s * 2π rad/rev = 1.2π rad/s ≈ 3.7699 rad/s.

So putting it all together:

r_rear = (0.12 m * 1.2π rad/s) / (5 / 0.330 m) )

Wait, no, wait, 5 m/s is v_wheel, which is r_wheel * ω_rear. So ω_rear = 5 / 0.330.

So substituting, r_rear = (0.12 * 1.2π) / (5 / 0.330 )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.12 * 1.2 = 0.144, so 0.144π ≈ 0.144 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.4524 m²/s.

Denominator: 5 / 0.330 ≈ 15.1515 s^-1.

So r_rear = 0.4524 / 15.1515 ≈ 0.02985 m, which is 2.985 cm. So approximately 3 cm, which would be about 3.00 cm. Looking at the options, option D is 2.99 cm, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Alternative approach:

The chain's speed is the same for both sprockets. So v_chain = v_front = v_rear.

v_front is r_front * ω_front.

v_rear is r_rear * ω_rear.

So setting them equal: r_front * ω_front = r_rear * ω_rear.

We can solve for r_rear:

r_rear = (r_front * ω_front) / ω_rear.

We know ω_rear from the rear wheel: v_wheel = r_wheel * ω_rear => ω_rear = v_wheel / r_wheel.

So substituting:

r_rear = (r_front * ω_front) / (v_wheel / r_wheel) )

= (r_front * ω_front * r_wheel) / v_wheel.

Now plugging in the numbers:

r_front = 0.12 m

ω_front = 0.6 rev/s * 2π rad/rev = 1.2π rad/s.

r_wheel = 0.330 m.

v_wheel =5 m/s.

So:

r_rear = (0.12 m * 1.2π rad/s * 0.330 m) / 5 m/s.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.12 * 1.2 = 0.144, then 0.144 * 0.330 = 0.04752, then multiplied by π gives approximately 0.04752 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.1492 m²/s.

Denominator: 5 m/s.

So r_rear = 0.1492 /5 ≈ 0.02984 m → 2.984 cm, which is 2.98 cm, approximately 3 cm. So the closest option is D: 2.99 cm.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the front and rear sprockets, which are connected by a chain. The chain ensures that the tangential speed at the edge of the front sprocket is equal to the tangential speed at the edge of the rear sprocket. Additionally, the rear sprocket is fixed to the rear wheel, so they share the same angular velocity.

### Key Equations:
1. **Tangential speed relation for the chain**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{front}} = v_{\text{rear}}
   \]
   where \(v_{\text{front}} = r_{\text{front}} \cdot \omega_{\text{front}}\) and \(v_{\text{rear}} = r_{\text{rear}} \cdot \omega_{\text{rear}}\).

2. **Angular velocity of the rear wheel**:  
   The tangential speed of the rear wheel is given as \(v_{\text{wheel}} = 5 \, \text{m/s}\), and its radius is \(r_{\text{wheel}} = 0.330 \, \text{m}\). Thus,  
   \[
   \omega_{\text{rear}} = \frac{v_{\text{wheel}}}{r_{\text{wheel}}}
   \]

3. **Rearranging for \(r_{\text{rear}}\)**:  
   Using the chain speed equality,  
   \[
   r_{\text{rear}} = \frac{r_{\text{front}} \cdot \omega_{\text{front}}}{\omega_{\text{rear}}}
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Convert \(\omega_{\text{front}}\) to radians per second**:  
   \[
   \omega_{\text{front}} = 0.6 \, \text{rev/s} \cdot 2\pi \, \text{rad/rev} = 1.2\pi \, \text{rad/s}
   \]

2. **Calculate \(\omega_{\text{rear}}\)**:  
   \[
   \omega_{\text{rear}} = \frac{v_{\text{wheel}}}{r_{\text{wheel}}} = \frac{5}{0.330} \approx 15.15 \, \text{rad/s}
   \]

3. **Substitute into the formula for \(r_{\text{rear}}\)**:  
   \[
   r_{\text{rear}} = \frac{r_{\text{front}} \cdot \omega_{\text{front}}}{\omega_{\text{rear}}}
   \]
   where \(r_{\text{front}} = 0.12 \, \text{m}\), \(\omega_{\text{front}} = 1.2\pi \, \text{rad/s}\), and \(\omega_{\text{rear}} = 15.15 \, \text{rad/s}\).  
   \[
   r_{\text{rear}} = \frac{0.12 \cdot 1.2\pi}{15.15}
   \]

4. **Simplify**:  
   The numerator is \(0.12 \cdot 1.2\pi = 0.144\pi \approx 0.4524 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}\), and dividing by \(15.15 \, \text{rad/s}\):  
   \[
   r_{\text{rear}} \approx \frac{0.4524}{15.15} \approx 0.02985 \, \text{m} = 2.985 \, \text{cm}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \(2.985 \, \text{cm}\) is **2.99 cm**, which corresponds to **option D**.
