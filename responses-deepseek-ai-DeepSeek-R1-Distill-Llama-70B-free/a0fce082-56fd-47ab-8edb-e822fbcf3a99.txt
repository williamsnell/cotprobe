Okay, so I've got this physics problem about capacitors and dielectrics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to think it through. The question has three parts, a), b), and c). I'll tackle them one by one.

The problem states that there are two capacitor plates with an area of 240π cm², separated by 10 mm. The space between them is filled with different dielectric materials arranged in sheets, each of the same thickness, and the interfaces are parallel to the plates. So for each part, I need to calculate the capacitance under different dielectric configurations.

Starting with part a): There are two dielectrics with ε_r1 = 3.5 and ε_r2 = 8.5. Since there are two dielectrics, I'm guessing each occupies half the separation distance. So each dielectric has a thickness of 5 mm because 10 mm divided by 2 is 5 mm.

I remember that when a capacitor has multiple dielectrics arranged in layers parallel to the plates, the capacitance is calculated as if each layer is a capacitor in series. Each of these would have their own capacitance, and the total capacitance would be the reciprocal sum of each individual capacitance.

The formula for a single capacitor is C = ε₀ε_r * A / d. But when capacitors are in series, 1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ... So for two dielectrics, I'll compute each capacitance and then add their reciprocals.

Let's compute each C. The area A is 240π cm². Wait, but units! Oh right, in SI units, area should be in m², and distance in meters. Let me convert everything to meters.

Area A = 240π cm² = 240π * (1e-2 m)^2 = 240π * 1e-4 m². So A = 240π * 1e-4 = 2.4π * 1e-2 m²? Wait wait, 1 cm is 0.01 m, so cm² is (0.01)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 240π cm² = 240π * 1e-4 m² = 0.024π m².

The separation d is 10 mm = 0.01 m. Each dielectric layer is 5 mm = 0.005 m thick.

So for each dielectric, the capacitance is C1 = ε₀ * ε_r1 * A / d1, and C2 = ε₀ * ε_r2 * A / d2.

Wait, but since both d1 and d2 are 0.005 m, and A is same. So C1 and C2 can be written as:

C1 = (ε₀ ε_r1 A) / d1
C2 = (ε₀ ε_r2 A) / d2

But d1 = d2 = 0.005 m, so the denominators are the same. So when taking 1/C1 + 1/C2, the denominators would factor out.

Wait, more accurately, because 1/C_total = (1/C1) + (1/C2). Let me compute each C first.

Let's compute C1:

C1 = ε₀ * 3.5 * (0.024π) / 0.005

Wait, wait, 240π cm² is 0.024π m². Right.

So C1 = (8.85e-12 F/m) * 3.5 * 0.024π / 0.005.

Let me compute that:

First, 0.024π is approx 0.024 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.0754 m².

Then, 3.5 * 0.0754 ≈ 0.264 m².

Divide by 0.005 m: 0.264 / 0.005 = 52.8.

Multiply by ε₀: 8.85e-12 * 52.8 ≈ 8.85e-12 * 5e1 = approx 4.425e-10 F.

Wait, let me do it more precisely.

Wait, 0.024π is exact as 0.024 * π. Let me keep it symbolic for now.

C1 = (ε₀ * ε_r1 * A) / d1 = (8.85e-12 * 3.5 * 0.024π) / 0.005.

Wait, 0.024 divided by 0.005 is 4.8. So 3.5 * 4.8 = 16.8. So 8.85e-12 * 16.8 * π.

Compute 8.85e-12 * 16.8 = approx 8.85 *16.8 = approx 148.68 → 1.4868e-10. Multiply by π: ~1.4868e-10 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.67e-10 F.

Similarly, C2 = (8.85e-12 * 8.5 * 0.024π) / 0.005.

Same way:

0.024 /0.005 =4.8. 8.5 *4.8 =40.8. 8.85e-12 *40.8 = approx 361.08e-12 = 3.6108e-10 F. Multiply by π: 3.6108e-10 *3.1416≈ 1.1348e-9 F.

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's better to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of the reciprocal sum.

Alternatively, when capacitors are in series, the effective capacitance is given by:

1/C = (d1)/(ε₀ ε_r1 A) + (d2)/(ε₀ ε_r2 A)

Because each capacitor contributes d/(ε ε₀ A) to the reciprocal sum.

So since d1 = d2 = 0.005 m, we can factor that out.

So 1/C = [0.005/(ε₀ A)] * (1/ε_r1 + 1/ε_r2 )

So,

1/C = (0.005) / (ε₀ * 0.024π ) * (1/3.5 + 1/8.5 )

Compute the terms:

First, (1/3.5 + 1/8.5) = (8.5 +3.5)/(3.5*8.5) )= 12/(29.75) ) ≈ 0.4031.

So 0.005/(ε₀ * 0.024π ) → 0.005 is 5e-3.

Compute denominator: ε₀ * 0.024π = 8.85e-12 * 0.024 * π.

0.024 * π ≈ 0.0754. 8.85e-12 * 0.0754 ≈ 6.678e-13.

So denominator is ~6.678e-13.

So 5e-3 / 6.678e-13 ≈ (5e-3) / (6.678e-13) ≈ 7.49e9.

Multiply by 0.4031: 7.49e9 * 0.4031 ≈ 3.02e9.

So 1/C ≈ 3.02e9 → C ≈ 1/(3.02e9) ≈ 3.31e-10 F.

Wait, 1e-9 is nano, 1e-12 is pico. 3.31e-10 F is 331e-12 F, which is 331 pF.

Looking at the options, for part a), option G has 330e-12 F, which is 330 pF. Others have 200, 100, etc. So that lines up.

Now, moving to part b): There are 10 dielectrics, with εr ranging from 1.5 to 10.5 in steps. So the εr values are 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, ..., up to 10.5.

Each dielectric has the same thickness, so each is 1 mm thick because total separation is 10 mm, and 10 layers.

So each layer is 1 mm = 0.001 m thick.

The approach is again to model each as a capacitor in series and sum the reciprocals.

So 1/C_total = sum_{i=1 to 10} (d_i) / (ε₀ ε_r_i A )

Since each d_i is 0.001 m, same A, so:

1/C = (0.001)/(ε₀ A) * sum(1/ε_r_i )

Compute sum(1/ε_r_i) for εr from 1.5 to 10.5, step 1.0. So it's 1/1.5 + 1/2.5 + ... + 1/10.5.

Let me compute each term:

1/1.5 = 0.6667

1/2.5 = 0.4

1/3.5 ≈ 0.2857

1/4.5 ≈ 0.2222

1/5.5 ≈ 0.1818

1/6.5 ≈ 0.1538

1/7.5 ≈ 0.1333

1/8.5 ≈ 0.1176

1/9.5 ≈ 0.1053

1/10.5 ≈ 0.0952

Adding these up:

Let me list them:

0.6667  
+0.4 → 1.0667  
+0.2857 → ~1.3524  
+0.2222 → ~1.5746  
+0.1818 → ~1.7564  
+0.1538 → ~1.9102  
+0.1333 → ~2.0435  
+0.1176 → ~2.1611  
+0.1053 → ~2.2664  
+0.0952 → ~2.3616.

So the sum is approximately 2.3616.

Now compute 1/C:

1/C = (0.001) / (ε₀ A ) * 2.3616.

Compute denominator: ε₀ A = 8.85e-12 F/m * 0.024π m².

0.024π is about 0.0754 m².

8.85e-12 * 0.0754 ≈ 6.678e-13 F·m.

So (0.001) / (6.678e-13) = 1e-3 / 6.678e-13 ≈ 1.498e9.

Multiply by 2.3616: 1.498e9 * 2.3616 ≈ 3.535e9.

So 1/C ≈ 3.535e9 → C ≈ 2.826e-10 F → 282.6e-12 F, which is 282.6 pF.

Looking at the options, for part b), the option G is 282 ×10^-12 F, which is 282 pF. So that fits.

Now part c): There's one nonhomogeneous dielectric, with ε_r varying linearly from 1 to 11.

Hmm, so the dielectric isn't uniform. The permittivity changes linearly across the separation. So the equation becomes more complex because ε_r isn't constant.

But I remember that for a linear variation of ε_r, the capacitance can be found by integrating the reciprocal over the thickness. Or wait, perhaps it's similar to the case with multiple dielectrics, but in the limit as the number of layers approaches infinity.

Wait, another approach: the overall dielectric can be represented as an effective permittivity. For a linear variation, I think the effective ε_r is the average of the minimum and maximum. So (1 + 11)/2 =6.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not correct. Because when ε varies along the thickness, the reciprocal in the capacitance formula would require a different approach.

The capacitance in such a case is given by C = (ε₀ A) / ( integral from 0 to d of dx / ε_r(x) )

Wait, no. Wait, the general formula for capacitance when the dielectric is a function of x is:

C = ε₀ A / ∫ (1/ε_r(x)) dx from 0 to d.

Wait, I think that's correct. Because each infinitesimal layer dx is a capacitor with that ε_r, and when capacitors are in series, the reciprocals add, so integrating 1/(ε_r(x)) dx.

So for a linear variation from ε_r=1 at x=0 to ε_r=11 at x=d=10 mm=0.01 m.

Expressed as ε_r(x) = 1 + (11-1)(x/d) ) = 1 + 10*(x/0.01) )? Wait, no, wait. Wait, x goes from 0 to 0.01 m.

So ε_r(x) = 1 + (10/0.01) x → 1 + 1000 x.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me think. At x=0, ε_r=1. At x=0.01 m, ε_r=11.

So the slope is (11-1)/(0.01 - 0) )= 10 /0.01 = 1000 per meter.

Thus, ε_r(x) = 1 + 1000 x.

So the expression becomes:

C = ε₀ A / ∫ (from x=0 to x=0.01) [1/(1 +1000 x)] dx.

Compute the integral:

∫ 1/(1 + 1000 x) dx from 0 to 0.01.

Let me make substitution: u=1 +1000 x → du=1000 dx → dx = du/1000.

When x=0, u=1. x=0.01, u=1 +1000*0.01= 11.

So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) * (du/1000) from u=1 to u=11.

Which is (1/1000) ∫ (1/u) du from 1 to11 = (1/1000) [ ln u ] from 1 to11 = (1/1000)(ln11 - ln1) = (ln11)/1000.

Since ln1=0. So the integral is (ln11)/1000.

So now, C= ε₀ A / ( (ln11)/1000 ) ) = (ε₀ A * 1000 ) / ln11.

Compute this value.

ε₀ is 8.85e-12 F/m.

A is 0.024π m².

So:

C = (8.85e-12 * 0.024π * 1000 ) / ln11.

Compute numerator:

8.85e-12 * 0.024 = 8.85e-12 * 2.4e-2 = 2.124e-13.

Multiply by π: 2.124e-13 *3.1416 ≈ 6.67e-13.

Multiply by 1000: 6.67e-13 *1e3 = 6.67e-10.

Denominator is ln11 ≈ 2.3979.

So C ≈ (6.67e-10) / 2.3979 ≈ 2.78e-10 F → 278e-12 F, which is 278 pF.

Looking at the options, for part c), option J has 278 PF, but looking at the options:

Looking at the options:

Option G: a) 330e-12, b)282e-12, c)278 PF → yes, 278 pF.

Wait, but looking at option G, it's a)330, b)282, c)278.

So for each part, a) is 330 pF, b) 282 pF, c) 278 pF. So the correct answer would be option G.

To solve the problem, we calculate the capacitance for each configuration of dielectrics using the given parameters:

### Given Data:
- Plate area: \( A = 240\pi \, \text{cm}^2 = 0.024\pi \, \text{m}^2 \)
- Plate separation: \( d = 10 \, \text{mm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \)
- Permittivity of free space: \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \)

### Part (a): Two Dielectrics (\( \epsilon_{R1} = 3.5 \), \( \epsilon_{R2} = 8.5 \))
Each dielectric occupies half the separation, so the thickness of each layer is \( d_1 = d_2 = 0.005 \, \text{m} \). The capacitance for a series combination is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{C} = \frac{d_1}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_{R1} A} + \frac{d_2}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_{R2} A}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
\frac{1}{C} = \frac{0.005}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 3.5 \cdot 0.024\pi} + \frac{0.005}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 8.5 \cdot 0.024\pi}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{C} = \frac{0.005}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.024\pi} \left( \frac{1}{3.5} + \frac{1}{8.5} \right)
\]

\[
\frac{1}{C} = \frac{0.005}{6.678 \times 10^{-13}} \cdot 0.4031 = 3.02 \times 10^9
\]

\[
C = \frac{1}{3.02 \times 10^9} \approx 3.31 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{F} = 331 \, \text{pF}
\]

### Part (b): Ten Dielectrics (\( \epsilon_R \): 1.5, 2.5, ..., 10.5)
Each dielectric occupies \( d_i = 0.001 \, \text{m} \). The capacitance is:

\[
