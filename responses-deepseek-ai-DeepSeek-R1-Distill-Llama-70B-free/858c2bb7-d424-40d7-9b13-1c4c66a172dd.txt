Okay, so I have this economics question here about price elasticity of demand and what a business should do to increase revenue. Hmm. I remember that elasticity has something to do with how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. 

The question says the demand price elasticity is 0.78. Wait, elasticity is usually a number, right? And if it's less than 1, that's inelastic demand. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Oh right, price elasticity of demand is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. So if the number is less than 1 in absolute value, demand is inelastic. Because a small response in quantity when price changes.

So in this case, the elasticity is 0.78. Which is less than 1. So demand is inelastic. So when demand is inelastic, increasing the price would lead to an increase in revenue because the percentage decrease in quantity sold isn't enough to offset the higher price per unit.

Wait, but how does elasticity affect revenue? Oh right, revenue is price multiplied by quantity. So if demand is inelastic, a price increase will cause a smaller percentage decrease in quantity, so total revenue goes up. Conversely, if demand is elastic (greater than 1), a price increase would lead to a bigger drop in quantity, so revenue would fall.

So the business wants to increase revenue. Their elasticity is 0.78, which is inelastic. So what should they do? They should increase the price. Because with inelastic demand, a price hike will boost revenue.

Looking at the options. Let me read them again.

Option A: Maintain current price because demand is unit elastic. Wait, unit elastic is when elasticity is exactly 1. So that's not the case here, elasticity is 0.78. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Increase price because demand is inelastic. Oh, that's what I was thinking. So B looks right.

Option C: Decrease price because unit elastic. No, elasticity is 0.78, not unit. And decreasing price when inelastic would lower revenue. So C is wrong.

Option D: Decrease price because inelastic. Wait, no. If demand is inelastic, decreasing price would lower revenue. Because you're selling more, but each unit is cheaper. But since the quantity doesn't increase much, the drop in price leads to lower total revenue. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Increase price because unit elastic. No, because it's not unit elastic. So E is wrong.

Option F: Maintain price because inelastic. Hmm, why would you maintain? If you increase price, you get more revenue, so F's reasoning is wrong.

Option G: Decrease price because unit inelastic. Wait, unit inelastic doesn't make sense. I think it's just inelastic. Also, decreasing isn't the right strategy here. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Decrease price because elastic. No, because elasticity is 0.78, which is inelastic. So H is wrong.

Option I: Maintain price because elastic. Again, elasticity is inelastic, so I is wrong.

Option J: Increase price because elastic. No, because it's not elastic. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be B: increase price because demand is inelastic.

The business is considering how to increase its revenue, and it knows that the price elasticity of demand for its product is 0.78. Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price. An elasticity value less than 1 indicates inelastic demand, meaning that the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price. 

When demand is inelastic, increasing the price leads to a smaller percentage decrease in quantity sold, which results in higher total revenue. Conversely, decreasing the price would reduce revenue because the increase in quantity sold would not offset the lower price per unit. 

Given that the elasticity is 0.78 (inelastic demand), the business should increase its price to boost revenue. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, E, I, J**: Incorrect because the demand is not unit elastic or elastic; it is inelastic.
- **C, D, G, H**: Incorrect because decreasing the price would reduce revenue when demand is inelastic.
- **F**: Incorrect because maintaining the price would not maximize revenue when demand is inelastic.
- **B**: Correct because increasing the price aligns with the strategy to maximize revenue under inelastic demand.

Thus, the correct answer is to increase the price because demand is inelastic.

Answer: B
