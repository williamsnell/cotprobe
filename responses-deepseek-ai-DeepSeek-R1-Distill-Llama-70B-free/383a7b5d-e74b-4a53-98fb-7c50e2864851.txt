Okay, so I have this physics problem here about heat conduction through a window pane. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that on either side of a window glass pane, the temperatures are 70°F and 0°F. I need to find out how fast heat is conducted through it. The area is 2500 cm² and the thickness is 2 mm. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that the formula for heat conduction is Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d. Or wait, no, maybe it's the rate, so power. Oh right, the formula should be Q/t equals (k A ΔT) / d. So the formula for the rate of heat transfer (Q/t) is (k * A * (T_hot - T_cold)) / d.

But wait, the units here are a mix. Let me think. The temperatures are in Fahrenheit, and the other units are in cm and mm. I need to make sure all the units are compatible. Oh right, because the formula requires the temperature difference in Kelvin or Celsius for the calculation, since they're absolute scales. Wait, no, the size of a degree is the same in Celsius and Kelvin, so the difference in temp in °F will need to be converted to °C.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's break this down step by step.

First, calculate the temperature difference. T_hot is 70°F and T_cold is 0°F. So ΔT in Fahrenheit is 70°F - 0°F = 70°F. But I need to convert that to Celsius because the thermal conductivity (k) is probably given in SI units, or at least in terms that require Celsius for the calculation.

How do I convert Fahrenheit to Celsius? The formula is °C = (°F - 32) * 5/9. So 70°F is (70-32)*5/9. Let me compute that. 70-32 is 38, 38 *5=190, 190/9 ≈21.111°C. So the temp difference is 21.111°C.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the temp difference in Fahrenheit is 70°F. But to get the equivalent in Celsius, I think the actual ΔT in °C is (70-0) converted. Wait no, because the size of a degree in F and C is different, so the difference in F isn't the same as the difference in C. So yes, I have to compute the temp difference correctly.

Wait, the temperature difference in Celsius would be (70°F - 0°F) converted. But wait, 70°F is 21.111°C, and 0°F is -17.777°C (since 0°F is -17.777°C). So the actual ΔT is 21.111 - (-17.777) = 38.888°C. Oh, that's a big difference. Wait, that makes sense because the temperature scales have different zero points. So the temp difference is about 38.888°C.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think again. The formula for heat transfer depends on the temperature gradient. So if the two sides are at 70°F and 0°F, their difference in Fahrenheit is 70°F, but in Celsius, that difference is (70-0) * (5/9) = 38.888...°C. Because each degree F is 5/9 of a degree C. So the temperature difference in Celsius is 38.888°C.

Alternatively, I can compute each temperature in Celsius and subtract. So 70°F is (70-32)*5/9 = 38*5/9 = 21.111°C. 0°F is (0-32)*5/9 = (-32)*5/9 ≈ -17.777°C. So the difference is 21.111 - (-17.777) = 38.888°C. Oh right, same result. So ΔT is 38.888°C.

Ok, so the temp difference is about 38.888 degrees Celsius.

Next, the area is 2500 cm². Oh, wait, I need to convert that to m² because the standard unit for thermal conductivity is in W/(m·K), which uses meters. So 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 2500 cm² is 2500 * 1e-4 m² = 0.25 m².

The thickness is 2 mm. Convert that to meters: 2 mm = 0.002 m.

Now, I need the thermal conductivity (k) of glass. I'm not exactly sure of the exact value, but I remember that for glass, it's around 0.8 to 0.9 W/(m·K). Let me think. I think soda-lime glass has a thermal conductivity around 0.8 W/(m·K). So I'll take k=0.8 W/(m·K) as an approximate value.

Putting it all into the formula: Q/t = (k * A * ΔT) / d.

So let me compute each part.

k = 0.8 W/(m·K)
A = 0.25 m²
ΔT = 38.888 K (since it's a difference, same in Kelvin)
d = 0.002 m

So plug in:

Q/t = (0.8 * 0.25 * 38.888) / 0.002

Let me compute step by step.

First, 0.8 * 0.25 = 0.2.

0.2 * 38.888 ≈ 7.7776.

Then divide by 0.002: 7.7776 / 0.002 = 3888. So Q/t is 3888 W? Because 1 W is 1 J/s, so that's J/s.

Wait, that's 3888 J/s. Which is 3888 watts. But that seems way higher than the options given. Because the options are in the hundreds of cal/s.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the rate in cal/s. Oh, right, because the options are in calories per second. I need to convert the watts to calories per second.

I remember that 1 Watt equals 1 Joule per second, and 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 Joules. So 1 W = 1 J/s = 1/4.184 cal/s ≈ 0.2389 cal/s.

So 3888 W * (1 cal/s / 3.419 W) → Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 calorie is 4.184 J. So to convert J/s to cal/s, we divide by 4.184.

So 3888 J/s = 3888 / 4.184 cal/s.

Let me compute that. 3888 / 4.184 ≈ let's see.

First, 4.184 * 900 = 3765.6. Because 4.184 * 900 = 4.184 *9 *100= 37.656 *100=3765.6.

So 3888 - 3765.6 = 122.4.

Now, 4.184 * 29 = approx 121.336 (since 4.184*30=125.52; subtract 4.184 to get 121.336).

So 900 +29 = 929, and we have about 929 cal/s.

Wait, 4.184 *929 = ?

Let me check:

900 *4.184 = 3765.6

29 *4.184 = let's compute each digit:

20 *4.184=83.68

9 *4.184=37.656

So 83.68 +37.656=121.336.

So total 3765.6 +121.336=3886.936, which is approximately 3886.94 J/s.

But the value we're getting is 3888 J/s, which is 3886.94 +1.06 ≈, so 930 cal/s would be 930 *4.184= approx 3886.94 +4.184= 3891.128 J/s, which is higher than 3888. So perhaps it's about 929.8 cal/s.

So approximately 930 cal/s.

Looking at the options, option H is 900, option F is 1000, option I is 600, option E 650, option C 850, etc. Hmm, no option exactly at 930, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, first, the thermal conductivity. Maybe I used the wrong value. I assumed 0.8 W/(m·K) for glass. But perhaps it's different. Let me think—other sources say glass has a thermal conductivity around 0.96 W/(m·K) for soda-lime glass. Or maybe 0.8 is for other types. I'm not sure, but that could change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature difference. Let me recheck that.

Wait, the temp difference when converted correctly is 38.888°C. That's correct. Because 70°F is 21.11°C, 0°F is -17.777°C. So difference is 38.888°C.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, area: 2500 cm² is 2500*(1e-2 m)^2 = 2500 *1e-4 m² = 0.25 m². Correct.

Thickness: 2 mm is 0.002 m. Correct.

So let me try with k=0.8 again.

Compute (0.8 * 0.25 * 38.888) / 0.002.

0.8 *0.25 = 0.2.

0.2 *38.888 = 7.7776.

7.7776 /0.002 = 3888 W.

Yes, same result.

Now, converting 3888 W to cal/s.

As 1 W = 1 J/s = 0.2389 cal/s approximately.

So 3888 * 0.2389 ≈ let's compute.

3888 * 0.2 is 777.6

3888 *0.0389 ≈ let's compute:

0.03 *3888=116.64

0.0089 *3888≈ 34.6 (approx).

So 116.64 +34.6≈151.24.

So total is 777.6 +151.24≈928.84 cal/s.

Approx 929 cal/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:900, option I:600, option C:850, option E:650, and option J:475. Hmm, none of them is exactly 929. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the thermal conductivity. Maybe I should use a different k value.

Wait, another possibility is that the thermal conductivity is given in cal units. Oh wait, perhaps the question expects the use of calories in the formula, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should check my unit conversion again.

Wait, no, the formula uses SI units, so k is in W/(m·K), which is J/(s·m·K). So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area. 2500 cm² is 0.25 m²? Let me compute that again. 1 m² is 1e4 dm², 1e4 *1e4 cm²/m²? Wait, 1 m =100 cm, so 1 m² = (100 cm)^2=10,000 cm². So 2500 cm² is 2500 /10,000 = 0.25 m². So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question gave the thickness in millimeters but I thought it was meters. Oh no, 2 mm is 0.002 m, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the thermal conductivity value I used is wrong. Let me look up (in my mind) the thermal conductivity of glass. Oh, wait, I think window glass (soda-lime) has a thermal conductivity of about 0.96 W/(m·K). Let me try that.

So if k is 0.96 instead of 0.8, then:

Q/t = (0.96 * 0.25 *38.888) /0.002

Compute step by step.

0.96 *0.25 = 0.24.

0.24 *38.888 ≈9.333.

9.333 /0.002 =4666.5 W.

Converting to cal/s: 4666.5 *0.2389 ≈4666.5 *0.24≈1120 cal/s. Hmm, that's even higher. So none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me try to look for the formula again.

The formula is Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d. So the rate is Q/t = (k A ΔT)/d.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the units for k are in cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C). Because sometimes thermal conductivity is expressed that way in cgs units. That would change everything.

Wait, that's possible. Let me think. If I use cgs units (centimeter-gram-second), the formula would be:

Q (in cal) = (k (cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C)) ) * A (cm²) * ΔT (°C) * t (s) / d (cm).

So the rate Q/t would be (k * A * ΔT) / d.

But in this case, the units would be in cal/s.

So perhaps the problem expects me to use k in cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C), which would make the calculation in cgs units.

Let me try that approach.

So let's collect the values in cgs units.

Area A is 2500 cm². Correct.

Thickness d is 2 mm = 0.2 cm.

ΔT is 70°F to 0°F, which in Celsius is 38.888°C.

Now, the thermal conductivity (k) of glass in cgs units. I think it's approximately 0.0025 cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Glass has a lower thermal conductivity than, say, copper, which is about 0.99 in some units. But in cgs units, I think for glass it's around 0.002 to 0.005.

Wait, perhaps I better look up the typical value. But since I can't do that, I'll proceed with an assumption. Let's say k is 0.0025 cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C).

So plugging into the formula:

Q/t = (k * A * ΔT) / d

k =0.0025 cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C)

A=2500 cm²

ΔT=38.888°C

d=0.2 cm

So compute:

(0.0025 *2500 *38.888) / 0.2.

Let me compute step by step.

0.0025 *2500 =6.25.

6.25 *38.888 ≈243. So 243.

Then divide by 0.2: 243 /0.2 =1215 cal/s.

Hmm, that's higher than the previous approach. But wait, the options don't have 1215. So perhaps I used the wrong value for k.

Alternatively, maybe the correct value for k is 0.004 cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C).

Let me try with k=0.004.

So 0.004 *2500=10.

10 *38.888≈388.88.

Divide by 0.2: 388.88 /0.2≈1944.4 cal/s. That's even higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for k. Maybe it's 0.0008 or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the value of thermal conductivity in the correct units.

Wait, another approach: I'll look for the thermal conductivity of glass in W/(m·K) and then convert it to cgs units.

If k is 0.8 W/(m·K), let's convert that to cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C).

Wait, 1 W is 1 J/s, which is 1 cal/(4.184 s) because 1 cal=4.184 J.

So 1 W = 0.239 cal/s.

Now, 1 m is 100 cm, so 1 m² is 10^4 cm², and 1 m·K is 100 cm·K.

So 1 W/(m·K) = 0.239 cal/(s * 100 cm * K).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the conversion factor.

So 1 W/(m·K) = (1 J/s) / (m·K) ).

But 1 J = 0.239 cal, and 1 m =100 cm. So,

1 W/(m·K) = (0.239 cal/s) / (100 cm * K) )

Which is 0.239 / (100) cal/(s·cm·K) ) = 0.00239 cal/(s·cm·K).

But wait, looking back at the cgs unit for k: it's cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C). So to get that, let's see.

The unit W/(m·K) is J/(s·m·K).

To convert J to cal: 1 J = 0.239 cal.

m to cm: 1 m =100 cm.

So,

1 J/(s·m·K) = 0.239 cal / (s * 100 cm * K) ) = 0.00239 cal/(s·cm·K).

But the cgs unit is cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C). So we need to have cm in the numerator.

So, 1 W/(m·K) = 0.00239 cal/(s·cm·K) = 0.00239 cal·cm/(s·cm²·K) ) because (cal/(s·cm·K)) * cm²/(cm) = cal·cm/(s·cm²·K).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think in terms of unit conversion factors.

We have k in W/(m·K) and want it in cal·cm/(s·cm²·°C).

So, 1 W = 1 J/s = 0.239 cal
