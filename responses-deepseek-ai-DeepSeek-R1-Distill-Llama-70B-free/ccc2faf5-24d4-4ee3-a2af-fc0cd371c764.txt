Okay, so I've got this question here about the serial position curve and free-recall tasks. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned about this. I think the serial position effect has to do with how well people remember items based on their position in a list.

Wait, right! The serial position curve shows that the first few items and the last few items in a list are remembered better than the ones in the middle. The first item has the primacy effect because people pay more attention when the list starts, so they remember it better. The last items have the recency effect because they're the most recent, so they're still fresh in memory.

So the question is about a single-trial free-recall task. The participant is shown a list of words one by one. The order is: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad. There are eight words in total.

The question asks which word is the participant most likely to forget. According to the serial position curve, the middle items are harder to remember because they're neither first nor last. So in an eight-word list, the middle would be the fourth and fifth positions, maybe the third and fourth?

Wait, let's count the positions. Position 1: house, 2: flower, 3: dog, 4: table, 5: license, 6: water, 7: computer, 8: salad. Oh, so the middle would be around positions 4 and 5. Because for even numbers, the middle is between 4 and 5. So the words in positions 4 and 5 are table and license.

Looking at the options, the question is about which word is most likely to be forgotten. So the options are A to J, each corresponding to a word or a position.

Option E says "The word presented in the middle of the list." Since the list has 8 words, the middle is around the 4th and 5th. So the middle word would be the 4th or 5th. Let me check the options. Option D is dog, which is position 3. Option I is license, position 5. Option J is table, position 4. Option E is about the middle word.

Wait, but the options don't specify whether it's the exact middle or the middle section. So in this case, the middle words are table (4) and license (5). So the participant is most likely to forget one of these.

Looking at the options, which one refers to the middle? Option E says "the word presented in the middle of the list." But in the given list, the middle is two words. However, in some cases, the middle position is considered the fourth in an 8-word list, making table the exact middle. Alternatively, maybe the middle is considered as the 4th and 5th positions.

But the options don't provide both. Let me look back at the choices. The options are A to J, each corresponding to a word or a position-based option. So the question is which is more likely to be forgotten. The middle positions are the weak points.

So the options that are in the middle are table (position 4) and license (position 5). Looking at the options, option E is "The word presented in the middle of the list." But the question is which word is the participant most likely to forget. So if the options include the middle word, then E would be the correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Options:

A: Salad (position 8, last word, so likely to be remembered due to recency)

B: Computer (position 7, also near the end)

C: The last word presented (salad, which is position 8, so A is same as C)

D: Dog (position 3, which is early but not first)

E: The word presented in the middle of the list (so position 4 or 5)

F: House (position 1, primacy effect, so likely remembered)

G: Water (position 6, near the end but not the last)

H: Flower (position 2)

I: License (position5)

J: Table (position4)

So the options include E, which is about the middle. The question is which is the most likely to be forgotten. The middle positions are the weakest. So the correct answer would be E, unless the question is considering the exact middle.

Wait, but if the list has an even number of items, the middle isn't a single position. So the middle would be positions 4 and 5. But the options don't have a choice that says "the words in the middle," but option E says "the word presented in the middle." That might be a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the middle as position 4 or 5. So the words are table (J) and license (I). So which of these is more likely to be forgotten? Both are in the middle, but perhaps the exact middle is position 4 in an 8-item list.

Wait, let me think. The serial position effect typically shows that the middle items are the least likely to be recalled. So in this case, the 4th and 5th items are in the middle. So the participant is most likely to forget either table or license.

Looking at the options, E is about the middle word. So if the question is asking which word is in the middle, the answer would be E. But the options also have I (license) and J (table) as individual words.

Wait, the question is phrased as, which word is the participant most likely to forget? So according to the curve, the middle words are the ones. So the options are E, I, J.

But the options don't have all three; E is about the word in the middle. Wait, no, the options are separate. So the correct answer would be E if the question is considering the middle position, or it could be I or J if they are the middle words.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the middle as the 4th word, which is table (option J) or the 5th, which is license (option I). But the options list E as "the word presented in the middle," which would correspond to either 4 or 5.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The standard serial position curve shows that the middle items are the least recalled. So the options don't specify which exact middle word, but option E is about the middle word. So if the list has an even number of items, the middle isn't a single word, but the question might be simplifying it, considering the 4th word as the middle. Alternatively, the question might be referring to the middle section, not a single word.

But looking back, the options are:

E: The word presented in the middle of the list.

So the middle word in an 8-word list would be the 4th word, table (option J). So if E is correct, the answer would be E. Alternatively, if the options consider the middle as the 4th and 5th, the most likely to forget would be either J or I.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the correct answer according to the serial position curve would be the middle of the list. So the word in the middle is the most likely to be forgotten.

So in the options, E says "the word presented in the middle of the list." So the correct answer is E.

The serial position curve describes how items in a list are remembered based on their position, with the first items (primacy effect) and the last items (recency effect) being better remembered than the middle items. In this question, the list has eight words, and the middle positions are the 4th and 5th words: "table" (position 4) and "license" (position 5). These middle positions are the most likely to be forgotten.

Among the options provided:

- **A: Salad** (position 8, last word) is likely to be remembered due to the recency effect.
- **B: Computer** (position 7) is near the end and also likely to be remembered.
- **C: The last word presented** refers to "salad" (position 8), which is the same as option A.
- **D: Dog** (position 3) is not in the middle and is relatively easier to remember.
- **E: The word presented in the middle of the list** refers to the middle positions (4th and 5th words), which align with the serial position curve as the most likely to be forgotten.
- **F: House** (position 1) is the first word and likely to be remembered due to the primacy effect.
- **G: Water** (position 6) is near the end and relatively easier to remember.
- **H: Flower** (position 2) is also relatively easier to remember.
- **I: License** (position 5) is one of the middle words and likely to be forgotten.
- **J: Table** (position 4) is the other middle word and also likely to be forgotten.

While both "table" (J) and "license" (I) are in the middle, the question asks for the word most likely to be forgotten, and option E explicitly refers to "the word presented in the middle of the list," which best captures the idea of the middle positions being the weakest in recall.

Answer: E
