Question:

A species of small rodent eats seeds from only one species of pine. In normal years, a pair of these rodents will have a litter of two or three. It is unusual for small rodents to have such small litter sizes. The rodents are most likely to exhibit which other characteristic?

D: High birth rate
E: Solitary behavior
F: High parental investment
G: Large body size
H: Frequent extrapair matings

J: Low survival rate

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question here. Let me read it again. It's about a species of small rodent that only eats seeds from one type of pine. Normally, a pair has a litter of two or three. It says that's unusual for small rodents, which typically have larger litters. The question is asking which other characteristic these rodents are most likely to exhibit. The options are A through J.

Hmm, so I remember that in biology, litter size often relates to the reproductive strategy of the species. Small mammals, like rodents usually, have large litters. But this one has a small litter, only two or three. So why would that be the case?

I think species with smaller litters often invest more in each offspring. That would be like the K-selection strategy, where fewer offspring are produced, but each gets a lot of care, leading to higher survival rates. So maybe they have high parental investment, which would mean option F. But wait, let me think through the other options too.

Option A: Precocial young. Precocial means that the young are relatively mature when born, like walking soon after birth. Altricial is the opposite, needing a lot of care. So if the rodents have small litters, perhaps they take more care, meaning altricial young. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B: Nocturnal behavior. Being active at night is common in many rodents, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to litter size. Maybe not directly connected here.

Option C: Herbivorous diet. They eat only pine seeds, so they are herbivores. So C is true, but the question is about another characteristic besides diet. The question says they already eat seeds, so the answer is something else.

Option D: High birth rate. Well, their litters are small, so high birth rate might not fit. High birth rate usually implies more offspring, but they're having only a couple each time. Unless they have many litters a year, but the question doesn't say that. So D might not be the right choice.

Option E: Solitary behavior. Some rodents are solitary, but others are social. I'm not sure how this ties in directly. Maybe if they have small litters, they might be more solitary? Not sure.

Option F: High parental investment. That makes sense because with fewer young, they can invest more time and resources into each, like feeding and protecting them, which increases their chances of survival. So F seems like a good candidate.

Option G: Large body size. The question says they're a small species of rodent. So G is probably not correct.

Option H: Frequent extrapair matings. That refers to mating outside the pair, which relates more to mating systems and not directly to litter size. Maybe not relevant here.

Option I: Moderate sexual size dimorphism. That refers to differences in size between males and females. I'm not sure how that connects, but perhaps in species where males and females are similar in size, certain behaviors follow. Not directly related to litter size though.

Option J: Low survival rate. If they have small litters but high investment, survival rate might actually be high. So J seems unlikely.

Putting it all together, the rodents have small litters, which suggests they're investing more in each offspring. So F, high parental investment, is the most likely answer.

The question involves a species of small rodent with unusually small litter sizes, typically two or three per pair. This suggests a reproductive strategy focused on fewer offspring but with greater care, aligning with the K-selection model. High parental investment (option F) is the most likely characteristic, as it implies significant resources are dedicated to each offspring, increasing their survival chances. Other options, such as precocial young (A), nocturnal behavior (B), herbivorous diet (C), high birth rate (D), solitary behavior (E), large body size (G), frequent extrapair matings (H), moderate sexual size dimorphism (I), and low survival rate (J), are either inconsistent with the scenario or less directly related to the small litter size.

Answer: F
