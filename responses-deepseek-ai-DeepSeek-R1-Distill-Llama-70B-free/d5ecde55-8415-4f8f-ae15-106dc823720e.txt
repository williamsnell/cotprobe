Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, there's a block of wood with a mass of 1 kg. When it's held in a vise, a bullet of mass 10 grams penetrates to a depth of 10 cm. Now, if the block is suspended so it can move freely, and another bullet is fired into it, what's the penetration depth this time? They say the retarding force is constant in both cases.

Hmm, I remember that when a bullet embeds itself in a block, it's a problem involving the conservation of momentum and possibly energy. But wait, in the first case, the block is in a vise, so it can't move. In the second case, it's suspended, so it can move freely, meaning it can recoil.

So maybe I should approach this by considering the two scenarios separately. Let's start with the first scenario because that's where the bullet penetrates 10 cm into the stationary block.

In the first case, the block is held in a vise, so it's stationary and doesn't move. The bullet is fired into it, and the only thing that happens is the bullet stops inside the block. The retarding force is constant, so I can probably calculate the work done by this force and relate it to the kinetic energy of the bullet.

Wait, but the bullet's kinetic energy is what's doing the work to penetrate the wood. Since the block doesn't move, all the bullet's energy goes into overcoming the retarding force. So the work done by the retarding force should equal the bullet's kinetic energy.

But wait, the problem says the retarding force is constant in both cases. So in the first case, the work done is F * d, where F is the retarding force and d is the penetration depth (10 cm, or 0.1 meters). And this work equals the kinetic energy of the bullet.

In the second scenario, the block is suspended, so it's free to move. So when the bullet hits it, both the bullet and the block move together after impact. So this is a conservation of momentum problem because the external forces (like the retarding force) can be considered during the impact, but wait, no, the retarding force is part of the problem. Hmm, maybe I need to think about this differently.

Wait, in the first case, the block is fixed. So the bullet's momentum is entirely transferred, but the block doesn't move because it's held in place. So the bullet's energy is entirely absorbed by the work done against the retarding force.

In the second case, the block can move, so the bullet's momentum is shared with the block. So kinetic energy is conserved in the sense that the bullet's initial kinetic energy goes into both the kinetic energy of the bullet-block system and the work done by the retarding force as they move together.

Wait, maybe I should model both cases using work and energy principles.

Let me define some variables:

Mass of bullet, m = 10 grams = 0.01 kg.

Mass of block, M = 1 kg.

In the first case, the bullet embeds into the block which is stationary. So initial momentum is just the bullet's. But since the block doesn't move, the bullet's entire kinetic energy is used to do work against the retarding force.

Let me denote the retarding force as F. So the work done by F over a distance d is F*d. This work equals the kinetic energy of the bullet.

So in the first case:

(1) Work done = F * d1 = (1/2) m v1²

Where v1 is the bullet's velocity in the first case, and d1 is 0.1 m.

In the second case, the block is free to move. So when the bullet (mass m) hits it, the bullet and block move together. Let me denote the velocity of the block and bullet after impact as v2.

So by conservation of momentum:

m * v1 = (m + M) * v2

That's because the initial momentum is m*v1, and the final is (m+M)*v2.

Wait, but in the first case, the bullet's initial velocity is v1. But wait, in the first case, the block is fixed, so the bullet comes to rest after penetrating d1. So maybe in the first case, the bullet's velocity is v1, and in the second case, the bullet's velocity is the same, but after impact, the block and bullet move together.

Wait, but the problem says the same bullet is fired, so I think in the second case, the bullet's initial velocity is the same as in the first case. So the v1 is the same in both cases.

Wait, but in the first case, the bullet's velocity is v1, which causes it to penetrate 10 cm into the stationary block. Now, in the second case, the bullet hits the block which can move. So the bullet's velocity is the same as before, but the block can move, so the bullet doesn't have to stop; it just slows down along with the block moving.

But wait, the problem says that in both cases the retarding force is the same. So maybe the same retarding force F is acting in both cases, but in the second case, the block can move, so the work done is F * d2, where d2 is the new penetration depth.

Wait, but perhaps the approach is to find F in the first case, then use that to find d2 in the second.

In the first case, the work done by the retarding force is F * d1, which equals the bullet's kinetic energy:

F * d1 = (1/2) m v1²

In the second case, when the block is free to move, the bullet and block move together, so their combined kinetic energy is (1/2)(m + M)v2², but the work done by the retarding force is F * d2.

So the bullet's initial kinetic energy is split into the kinetic energy of the bullet-block system and the work done by the retarding force:

(1/2) m v1² = (1/2)(m + M) v2² + F * d2

But I think we can express F from the first case and use it here.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the time the bullet is decelerating in each case. In the first case, the block is fixed, so the bullet is decelerated by F over the distance d1. In the second case, the bullet and block move together, so F acts over a distance d2, but the system (bullet and block) is moving during this time.

Wait, perhaps using the same retarding force F, we can relate the two cases.

In the first case, the bullet comes to rest after d1, so the work done is F*d1 = (1/2)m v1².

In the second case, the bullet and block move together, so the bullet's velocity decreases from v1 to zero over d2, but the block is moving along with it. So the work done is F*d2, but the kinetic energy is the initial kinetic energy of the bullet minus the kinetic energy of the combined system when the bullet stops.

Wait, no, because the bullet is stopping, so the work done would be F*d2 = (1/2) m v1² - (1/2)(m+M) v2².

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of reduced mass or something.

Wait, another approach: The retarding force F is the same in both cases. Let's consider the case when the block is fixed. The bullet's average velocity during penetration is (v1 + 0)/2 = v1/2. The time taken to stop is t = (2 d1)/(v1). Wait, but since F = m a, and the deceleration is F/m, so a = F/m.

Wait, maybe using kinematics equations could help. In the first case, the bullet is decelerating with acceleration a = F/m. The initial velocity is v1, final velocity is zero, so using v² = u² + 2 a s.

So 0 = v1² - 2 (F/m) d1.

So F = (m v1²) / (2 d1).

That matches what we had with the work done, since F d1 = (m v1²) / 2.

In the second case, the block is moving, so the bullet and block move together. So their combined mass is m + M. The initial velocity of the system is v2, same as the bullet's velocity after impact. But wait, momentum is conserved here, so the initial momentum is m v1 = (m + M) v2. So v2 = (m / (m + M)) v1.

Wait, but during the penetration, the system (bullet + block) moves a distance d2 while being decelerated by F. So the deceleration is a = F/(m + M).

Again, using kinematics: final velocity is zero, so v2² = u² + 2 a s.

Wait, no, because the initial velocity is v2, and final is zero, so:

0 = v2² - 2 a d2.

So a = F/(m + M) = (v2²) / (2 d2).

But from the first case, F = (m v1²) / (2 d1).

So substituting F into the second equation:

(F)/(m+M) = (v2²) / (2 d2).

But F is (m v1²)/(2 d1), so:

(m v1²)/(2 d1 (m + M)) ) = v2² / (2 d2 )

Simplify:

(m v1²) / (d1 (m + M)) ) = v2² / d2

Multiply both sides by d2:

(m v1² d2) / (d1 (m + M)) ) = v2²

But from conservation of momentum, v2 = (m v1) / (m + M).

So v2² = (m² v1²) / (m + M)^2.

Substituting this into the equation:

(m v1² d2) / (d1 (m + M)) ) = (m² v1²) / (m + M)^2 )

We can cancel v1² from both sides.

So:

d2 / (d1 (m + M)) ) = m / (m + M)^2 )

Multiply both sides by (m + M)^2 * d1:

d2 (m + M) = m d1

So d2 = (m d1 ) / (m + M )

Wait, that can't be right because when the block is free to move, the penetration depth should be less than in the first case where the block is fixed. Because in the second case, the block can move, so the bullet doesn't have to do as much work to stop—since some of the kinetic energy goes into moving the block.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. m is 0.01 kg, M is 1 kg.

So d2 = (0.01 kg * 0.1 m) / (0.01 + 1) kg.

So denominator is 1.01 kg.

So d2 = (0.001) / 1.01 ≈ 0.0009901 meters, which is about 0.99 cm. That can't be right because the options are all around 8-12 cm, so maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, perhaps I forgot to consider that in the second case, the bullet and block move together, so the work done by F is over a longer time, but perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, maybe I should consider the time over which the force F acts in each case.

In the first case, the bullet is stopped over a distance d1. The average velocity during deceleration is v1/2. So the time t1 = d1 / (v1/2) ) = 2 d1 / v1.

The impulse J is F * t1 = m (v1 - 0) ) = m v1.

So F = m v1 / t1.

But t1 is 2 d1 / v1, so F = m v1 / (2 d1 / v1 ) ) = m v1² / (2 d1 ), which matches what we had earlier.

In the second case, the bullet and block move together, so their combined mass is m + M. The initial velocity after impact is v2 = (m v1) / (m + M).

They move together until the bullet stops. So the time taken to stop, t2, can be found from v2 = a t2, where a is F/(m + M).

Wait, but the acceleration is a = F/(m + M) = (m v1² / (2 d1 )) / (m + M).

So a = (m v1²) / (2 d1 (m + M)).

The time to stop is t2 = v2 / a.

Wait, but perhaps using the equation s = v2 t2 - (1/2) a t2².

Wait, but when the bullet stops, final velocity is zero, so:

0 = v2 - a t2.

So t2 = v2 / a.

Then, the distance d2 is the distance moved during this time: d2 = v2 t2 - (1/2) a t2².

Wait, but since a is negative (deceleration), the term would be positive. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use v² = u² + 2 a s.

So, 0 = v2² + 2 (-a) d2.

So, 0 = v2² - 2 a d2.

So, a = v2² / (2 d2).

But since a = F/(m + M), and F is known from the first case:

F = m v1²/(2 d1).

So,

(m v1²)/(2 d1 (m + M)) ) = v2² / (2 d2 )

Simplify by multiplying both sides by 2:

(m v1²)/(d1 (m + M)) ) = v2² / d2.

But v2 is (m v1)/(m + M).

So,

(m v1²)/(d1 (m + M)) ) = (m² v1²)/( (m + M)^2 ) ) / d2.

Multiply both sides by d2:

(m v1² d2 )/(d1 (m + M)) ) = (m² v1² )/( (m + M)^2 )

Cancel v1² from both sides:

(m d2 )/(d1 (m + M)) ) = m² / (m + M)^2 )

Simplify:

d2/(d1 (m + M)) ) = m/(m + M)^2 )

Multiply both sides by d1 (m + M)^2:

d2 (m + M) = d1 m (m + M )

Wait, no, wait, perhaps another approach. Let me go back.

From:

(m v1²)/(d1 (m + M)) ) = (m² v1²)/( (m + M)^2 d2 )

We can rearrange this as:

d2 = (m² v1² d1 (m + M)) ) / ( (m + M)^2 (m v1²) )

Wait, perhaps better to do it step by step.

Starting from:

(m v1² )/(d1 (m + M)) ) = (m² v1² )/( (m + M)^2 d2 )

We can cross-multiply:

(m v1² ) * (m + M)^2 d2 = (m² v1² ) * d1 (m + M )

Simplify both sides by dividing by (m v1² (m + M)) ):

(m + M) d2 = m d1

So,

d2 = (m d1 ) / (m + M )

Wait, this is the same result as before. So with m=0.01 kg, M=1 kg, d1 = 0.1 m.

So,

d2 = (0.01 kg * 0.1 m) / (1.01 kg ) ≈ 0.001 / 1.01 ≈ 0.0009901 m, which is about 0.99 cm.

But that's way less than the first case's 10 cm. But none of the options are even close to 1 cm. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm not accounting for something correctly. Maybe I should think about the work done in the second scenario differently.

In the second case, the bullet hits the block and they move together, so the work done by the retarding force is F * d2, which should equal the initial kinetic energy of the bullet minus the kinetic energy of the combined system when the bullet stops.

Wait, when the bullet stops, the combined system (bullet and block) has kinetic energy of (1/2)(m + M) v_end². But in reality, the bullet stops, so the system comes to rest, so v_end is zero. Wait, no, because in reality, the bullet and block would have moved some distance d2 and then stop. So perhaps the work done by the retarding force is F * d2 = initial KE of bullet - KE of system at end.

Wait, but if the bullet stops, then the system's velocity is zero, so the KE at the end is zero. So all the initial KE of the bullet goes into the work done by F. But that's the same as the first case, which can't be right because in the first case, the block was fixed, so that work was F * d1. But that would imply d2 = d1, which isn't the case.

Wait, that can't be. Because in the second case, the block is moving, so some of the bullet's KE goes into the KE of the block. So my earlier approach must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the second case, the bullet doesn't stop. Instead, it penetrates until the block and bullet system comes to a stop due to the retarding force. So the work done by F is F * d2, which equals the initial KE of the bullet minus the final KE of the system.

But wait, the system's final KE is zero only if it comes to rest, which would mean the bullet is stopped, but that would be the same as the first case. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in the first case, the work done is F * d1 = (1/2) m v1².

In the second case, the bullet's initial KE is (1/2) m v1². After impact, the block and bullet move with some velocity v, and then the retarding force F acts
