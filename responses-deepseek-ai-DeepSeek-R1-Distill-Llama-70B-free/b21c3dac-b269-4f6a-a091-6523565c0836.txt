Okay, so I've got this question here about image restoration strategies, and I need to figure out which one Louis is using. Let me try to break it down.

So, Louis owns a chemical company that's been dumping waste irresponsibly, which has contaminated the water supply. That's pretty bad. Now, even though Louis knew the company was cutting costs in waste disposal, he's publicly saying he had no knowledge of these irresponsible practices. Instead, he's blaming the general manager and firing him. 

Hmm, so I remember that image restoration strategies are techniques used by individuals or organizations to repair their reputation when they've done something wrong. There are several strategies like denial, mortification, corrective action, etc.

In this case, Louis is denying any knowledge of the wrong practices. He's claiming he didn't know, which is a form of denial. But wait, he also fires the manager and shifts the blame. I think that might tie into another strategy.

Wait, the question is about the strategy he's using. So, when someone denies any wrongdoing or knowledge, that's the denial strategy. But in this scenario, he's not just denying; he's also shifting the blame to someone else. So is that another strategy?

I recall that "denial" is when the person refuses to accept responsibility, saying it wasn't their fault. But there's also something called "evasion of responsibility," where the person tries to avoid taking responsibility by blaming others or making excuses.

So Louis is saying he didn't know, which is a denial, but he's also blaming the general manager. That sounds like he's trying to shift the blame, which would be evasion of responsibility. So would that be option I or J?

Looking back at the options, option I is denial and option J is evasion of responsibility. The distinction seems important here. Denial would be if he just said, "It didn't happen" or "I didn't do it." But in this case, he's saying he's not responsible because someone else is at fault. So that's more about evading responsibility rather than outright denying the facts.

Wait, but he's also lying about not knowing. So he's denying his knowledge, which is part of the denial strategy. But the main strategy here seems to be shifting the blame, which is evasion. So the primary strategy might be evasion of responsibility.

Alternatively, the question states that he knew the company was cutting costs but claims no knowledge of the practices. So he's not denying the contamination happened, but rather that he wasn't aware. So that's more of a denial of knowledge, which is a subset of denial. But then he fires the manager, which is an attempt to shift blame, so that's evasion.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the definitions more clearly.

Denial: The speaker refuses to accept responsibility by denying any involvement or knowledge of the wrongdoing.

Evasion of Responsibility: The speaker accepts that something wrong happened but tries to avoid blame by offering excuses or justifications, like blaming someone else.

So in this case, Louis is denying knowledge, which is a form of denial. But he's also shifting the blame to the manager, which is evasion. So which one is the primary strategy here?

Wait, the question is asking what image restoration strategy is Louis using. He's using multiple strategies maybe, but the question is about which one.

Looking at the options, the choices are individual strategies. So the main strategy here seems to be that he's denying any knowledge, which is option I. But then, by blaming the manager, that's another strategy.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that he's publicly claiming no knowledge and blaming the manager. So he's trying to avoid responsibility by denying his involvement and shifting the blame. So that would be evasion of responsibility, which is option J.

Alternatively, if the main strategy was just denying the knowledge, then it's option I. But since he's also blaming someone else, it's more about evading responsibility.

So I think the correct answer is J: evasion of responsibility.

The question involves identifying the image restoration strategy Louis is using. Louis claims no knowledge of the irresponsible practices and shifts the blame to the general manager, firing him. This behavior aligns with evasion of responsibility, where the individual avoids accountability by blaming others or making excuses. While Louis's denial of knowledge could be seen as a form of denial (option I), the primary strategy here is evading responsibility by deflecting blame, making the correct answer:

Answer: J
