Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about hypothesis testing, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a one-sided test of a hypothesis regarding a population mean. The sample size is 14, and the P-value obtained is 0.075. I'm supposed to determine which range of t-values would result in this P-value.

Hmm, right. I remember that in hypothesis testing, the P-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. For a one-tailed test, this P-value corresponds to the area under the t-distribution curve beyond a certain critical value.

Since the sample size is 14, the degrees of freedom would be 14 - 1 = 13. So, I'm dealing with a t-distribution with 13 degrees of freedom.

I think the key here is to find the t-value that corresponds to a P-value of 0.075. But wait, for a one-tailed test, the P-value is the area in one tail. So, I'm looking for the t-value where the area to the right (assuming it's an upper-tailed test) is 0.075.

Alternatively, if it's a lower-tailed test, the area to the left would be 0.075. But the question doesn't specify the direction, so I might need to assume it's a two-tailed scenario? No, wait, the question says it's a one-sided test, so it's either upper or lower, not both.

Wait, the question is about the range of t-values that would give this P-value. So, I'm thinking about the t-value that cuts off an area of 0.075 in one tail. That would be the critical t-value for a significance level alpha of 0.075. But wait, the P-value is 0.075, which would be the observed significance level, not necessarily the alpha we're testing at.

But in this case, we're not comparing to a specific alpha; we're just finding the t-value that corresponds to a P-value of 0.075. So, for a one-tailed test with df=13, I need to find the t-value where the area to one side is 0.075.

I remember that t-distribution tables provide critical values based on common alpha levels, like 0.10, 0.05, 0.025, etc. But 0.075 isn't a standard alpha level, so I might need to interpolate or use a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for a one-tailed test with df=13:

- The critical t-value for alpha=0.10 is around 1.345.
Wait, no, wait. Let me think. I remember that for df=13, the critical t-values for some alphas are as follows:

- For alpha=0.10 (right-tail), the t-value is approximately 1.345. But wait, is that for a two-tailed test? Or one-tailed?

Wait, no. The one-tailed (right-tail) alpha=0.10 corresponds to t=1.345. For alpha=0.05, it's about 1.771. And for alpha=0.025, it's around 2.160.

Since the P-value is 0.075, that's between 0.05 and 0.10. So the t-value must be between the critical values for 0.05 and 0.10.

Wait, wait. No, because the P-value is the area beyond the t-value. So if the P-value is 0.075, the t-value must be such that the area to one side is 0.075. So, between the t-values that correspond to 0.05 and 0.10.

Wait, but wait: when the t-value increases, the P-value (area) decreases. So, a t-value of 1.345 gives a P-value of 0.10. A t-value of 1.771 gives a P-value of approximately 0.05 (since that's the 5% critical value). Wait, no, the P-value is the area beyond the t-value, so for t=1.771, the area is 0.05 (for one tail). So, if the P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10, then the t-value must be between 1.345 and 1.771.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Suppose I have a one-tailed test. The t-value increases as the area beyond it (the P-value) decreases. So:

- t=1.345 → P=0.10
- t=1.771 → P=0.05

So if the P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10, the t-value should be between 1.345 and 1.771.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Let's say I'm doing an upper-tailed test. The t-value tells me how far my sample mean is from the population mean, in terms of standard error.

So for example:

- At t=1.345, the area to the right is 0.10.
- At t=1.771, the area to the right is 0.05.

So if my observed t-value is such that the area to the right is 0.075, it must be between 1.345 and 1.771. Because 0.075 is between 0.05 and 0.10, so the t must be between the two values.

Wait, that's correct. So the t-value would be between 1.345 and 1.771. But looking at the options, let's see.

Looking at the options given:

Option C: 1.771 < t < 2.160 → No, because 1.771 corresponds to 0.05, and 2.160 is for 0.025. For 0.075, it's higher than 0.05, so t would be less than 1.771.

Option F: 1.350 < t < 1.771 → Hmm, 1.350 is close to 1.345 (maybe rounded), and 1.771 is the 0.05 value. So this option suggests t is between approx 1.35 and 1.77, which would correspond to P-values between 0.05 and 0.10. So if P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10, the t must be between 1.345 and 1.771.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way: the P-value is 0.075, which is less than 0.10 but more than 0.05. So the t-value must be greater than the 0.10 critical value (1.345) but less than the 0.05 critical value (1.771). So, the t is between 1.345 and 1.771.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 to 1.771, which fits.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option E: 1.782 < t < 2.150 → That's higher than 1.771, which would correspond to P-values lower than 0.05. So that's not it.

Option C: 1.771 < t < 2.160 → Same as above, higher t, lower P.

Option B: 1.5 < t < 2.0 → Maybe, but 1.5 is in the range of option F's lower bound.

Wait, what about the other options?

Option J: 1.2 to 1.4 → That's lower t, so higher P-value (like 0.15 maybe?), so not 0.075.

Option A: 1.0 to 1.5 → Also too low.

Option G: 1.345 to 1.761 → Wait, 1.345 is the 0.10 critical value, and 1.761 is close to 1.771. So this is similar to F, but F starts at 1.350. So G is 1.345 to 1.761.

Hmm, but the options have to match exactly.

Wait, the options are:

A: 1.000 < t< 1.500

B: 1.500 < t< 2.000

C: 1.771 < t< 2.160

D: 1.771 < t< 2.500

E: 1.782 < t< 2.150

F: 1.350 < t< 1.771

G: 1.345 < t< 1.761

H: 1.761 < t< 2.160

I: 1.356 < t< 1.782

J: 1.200 < t< 1.400

Wait, so option F is 1.350 to 1.771, which is exactly the range I thought. Option G is 1.345 to 1.761, which is close. But perhaps the exact critical values are needed.

Wait, in reality, the t-value for alpha=0.075 would be found using a t-table or a calculator. Let me think about more precise values.

Wait, I remember that in the t-table, for df=13:

- The 0.10 (one-tail) critical value is 1.345.

- The 0.05 (one-tail) is 1.771.

But if the P-value is 0.075, then the critical t-value is somewhere between these two. So, the t-value would be between 1.345 and 1.771.

So, the correct range is between 1.345 and 1.771.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 < t <1.771. Option G is 1.345 < t <1.761.

Now, perhaps 1.771 is the exact value for 0.05, so the t-value for P=0.075 would be just below 1.771. So, the upper limit is approaching 1.771, but the option F includes up to 1.771.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is F, as 1.350 is just a rounded version of 1.345.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the range of t-values that would give a P-value of 0.075. So for a one-tailed test, the t-value could be either positive or negative, but since it's one-sided, we're considering either the right or left tail.

Wait, no. For a one-sided test, the t-value must be in one direction. So perhaps the t is positive if it's an upper-tailed test, or negative if it's a lower-tailed test. But the P-value is just 0.075, so the absolute value of t would correspond to the area in one tail.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the range of t-values that would result in this P-value. So, for an upper-tailed test, the t would have to be positive and greater than the critical value for 0.075. For a lower-tailed test, the t would be negative and less than the negative critical value.

But in the options, all the t-values are positive. So the options are considering the magnitude, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the magnitude of t. But I'm not entirely sure. But since the options only give positive ranges, maybe it's considering the upper tail.

So, the t-value would be greater than the critical value for 0.10 (1.345) but less than that for 0.05 (1.771). So, the t is between 1.345 and 1.771.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 to 1.771, which fits.

Option G is 1.345 to 1.761. So, perhaps the exact t-value is 1.761, but I'm not sure. Wait, 1.771 is the critical value for 0.05, so the t-value for P=0.075 must be less than 1.771. So, the upper limit is approaching 1.771, but the option F includes up to 1.771.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is G, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I can recall the exact t-critical values for df=13.

Looking up a t-table, for df=13:

One-tailed:

- 0.10 → 1.345

- 0.075 → approximately 1.402 (I think, but I'm not sure without a table)

Wait, no, I'm probably making this up because I don't have a table in front of me. Alternatively, perhaps in reality, the t-value for 0.075 is about 1.402, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think of it another way. The P-value is 0.075. So, for a one-tailed test with df=13, the t-value must be such that the area to the right (if upper-tailed) is 0.075.

I can use the t-distribution's properties to estimate. The critical value for alpha=0.075 would be the t where P(T > t) = 0.075.

Since 0.075 is between 0.05 and 0.10, the t-value is between 1.345 and 1.771.

So, the t must be in that range. Therefore, the correct option is F: 1.350 < t < 1.771.

Wait, but option F's lower limit is 1.350, which is very close to 1.345, which is the 0.10 critical value. So, perhaps the correct option is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact t-value for 0.075 is around 1.40, so the range would include t-values from 1.345 up to that point, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the t-distribution is symmetric, but since we're dealing with one tail, we only look at one side.

Alternatively, another approach: the P-value is 0.075, which is the probability that the test statistic is as extreme as observed, in the direction of the alternative hypothesis.

So, for a one-tailed test, the t-value must be such that only 7.5% of the distribution lies beyond it.

Given that, and knowing the critical values for 0.05 and 0.10, the t must be between 1.345 (for 0.10) and 1.771 (for 0.05).

Thus, the correct range is 1.345 < t <1.771.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 < t <1.771, and option G is 1.345 < t <1.761.

Hmm, so which is it?

Wait, perhaps the options are using rounded values. So option F starts at 1.350, which is a rounded version of 1.345, and ends at 1.771, which is the exact 0.05 value. So, the correct range is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps option G is considering more precise values, but without the exact table, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I can think of using a t-calculator. Suppose I calculate the t-value for a one-tailed test with alpha=0.075, df=13.

Using an online calculator or a precise method would give the exact value. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with what I know.

The critical t-value for alpha=0.075 would be approximately 1.402, so the range would be from 1.345 to 1.402?

Wait, no. Because the t-value that gives P=0.075 in one tail is the value where the area to the right is 0.075. So, for df=13, the t-value T satisfies P(T > t) = 0.075.

Using a calculator, the exact t-value for alpha=0.075 (one-tailed) with df=13 is approximately 1.402. So, any t-value greater than 1.402 would have a P-value less than 0.075. But wait, the question states that the P-value is exactly 0.075. So, the t-value must be exactly 1.402, but the question is about the range of t-values that would give a P-value of 0.075.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because for any specific t-value, the P-value is a specific number. So, perhaps the question is actually referring to the critical value that corresponds to P=0.075, which would be a single value, not a range. But the options provide ranges, so I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking about the range of possible t-values that would result in a P-value less than or equal to 0.075, but that doesn't seem to fit the wording. The question says "yields a P-value of 0.075", which suggests it's the exact value.

But in that case, the t-value would be a single point, not a range. So perhaps the question is referring to the range of t-values that would result in a P-value between certain alphas, like between 0.05 and 0.10, hence the t between 1.345 and 1.771.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10, so the t must be between the critical values of those alphas.

So, the correct range is 1.345 to 1.771. Among the options, option F is 1.350 to 1.771, which is the closest match.

Alternatively, option G is 1.345 to 1.761, which is also close. But without knowing the exact critical value, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but that's for higher t-values. No, option C starts at 1.771, which is the 0.05 value, so that's not it.

So, to sum up, the correct range should be between the 0.10 and 0.05 critical values, which are 1.345 and 1.771. So the option that covers this range is option F: 1.350 < t < 1.771.

I think that's the right choice.
