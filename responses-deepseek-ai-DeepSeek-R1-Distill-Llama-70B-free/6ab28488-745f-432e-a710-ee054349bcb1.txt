Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about what happens to the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output when a major earthquake destroys a lot of plant and equipment on the West Coast. They also mention to assume an upward sloping aggregate supply curve.

Hmm, I remember from my notes that the aggregate demand and supply model is used to understand how the price level and output are determined in an economy. The aggregate demand curve is usually downward sloping, while the aggregate supply curve can have different slopes depending on the situation. In this case, it's upward sloping, which I think is the normal case, especially in the short run.

So, when a major earthquake hits, it's a negative supply shock. Because plant and equipment are destroyed, the economy's ability to produce goods and services decreases. In the aggregate supply and demand framework, a decrease in supply would shift the aggregate supply curve to the left. Wait, but I should think about how exactly this affects the curves.

Let me visualize the graph. The aggregate demand (AD) curve is sloping downward, and the aggregate supply (AS) is sloping upward. They intersect at an equilibrium point which gives us the equilibrium price level and output.

If the supply curve shifts left, that means for every price level, the quantity supplied is less. So, what happens when AS shifts left? The equilibrium point moves to a higher price level and a lower quantity of output. Because with a left shift in AS, the price level must rise to reach the new equilibrium where AD meets the new AS. And since the economy can't produce as much, the quantity of output decreases.

So, putting it together, the equilibrium price level increases, and the equilibrium quantity of output decreases. Looking at the options, option D says exactly that. Let me double-check the options:

Option A: Price increases, output same. No, output should decrease.

Option B: Both increase. No, because a supply shock reduces output.

Option C: Both decrease. No, price goes up, so that's wrong.

Option D: Price up, output down. Yes, that's what I thought.

Option E: Price same, output up. No, opposite.

Option F: Both same. No, something changed.

Option G: Price same, output down. No, price should go up.

Option H: Price down, output same. No.

Option I: Price down, output fluctuates. Not sure, but I don't think so.

Option J: Price down, output up. Opposite.

So the correct answer should be option D.

The question involves analyzing the impact of a major earthquake that destroys plant and equipment on the West Coast, assuming an upward sloping aggregate supply curve. This event represents a negative supply shock, which reduces the economy's productive capacity. In the aggregate demand and supply framework, this would cause the aggregate supply curve to shift to the left. 

At the new equilibrium, where the downward sloping aggregate demand curve intersects the left-shifted aggregate supply curve, the equilibrium price level increases, and the equilibrium quantity of output decreases. This is because the reduced supply leads to higher prices, while the economy's ability to produce is diminished.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The equilibrium quantity of output does not remain the same; it decreases.
- **B**: Incorrect. Both price level and output do not increase; output decreases.
- **C**: Incorrect. Both price level and output do not decrease; the price level increases.
- **D**: Correct. The equilibrium price level increases, and the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.
- **E**: Incorrect. The price level does not remain the same; it increases.
- **F**: Incorrect. Both price level and output do not remain the same; they change.
- **G**: Incorrect. The price level does not remain the same; it increases.
- **H**: Incorrect. The price level does not decrease; it increases.
- **I**: Incorrect. The price level does not decrease, and output does not fluctuate; it decreases.
- **J**: Incorrect. The price level does not decrease, and output does not increase; it decreases.

The correct answer is **D**: The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.
