Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An art collector attended a party on March 15. At the party, the art collector was describing his collection to a woman in attendance. When the art collector described a painting by a well-known artist, the woman indicated she might like to buy that painting. The art collector said, "I'll sell you the painting for $10,000. I'll give you 30 days to decide whether you want the painting. " On March 25, the art collector wrote to the woman and stated that the offer of March 15 was withdrawn. The woman received the March 25 letter on March 26. On March 27, the woman wrote the art collector the following letter:"Please be advised that I hereby accept your offer of March 15. " The art collector received this letter on March28. Thereafter, the art collector and the woman engaged in several telephone discussions. On April 10, the woman, in a telephone conversation, told the art collector that she would pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered on or before April 15. The art collector agreed to deliver the painting for $15,000. On April 15, the art collector tendered the painting, but the woman refused to pay more than $10,000. If the art collector asserts a claim against the woman for breach of contract, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: An enforceable contract does not exist between the parties, because of mutual mistake of fact.
B: There is no enforceable contract, because the woman did not accept the initial offer in writing.
C: The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000, because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period.
D: The art collector is obligated to sell the painting for $10,000 as the woman accepted the original offer before it was revoked.
E: The woman is obligated to pay the art collector $10,000, because the art collector did not properly revoke the initial offer.
F: Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.
G: The woman is not obligated to pay any amount, because the initial offer was not legally binding.
H: The woman is obligated to pay $15,000, because she agreed to this price during their telephone conversation on April 10.
I: The woman is obligated to pay $15,000 as the new agreement made on April 10 supersedes the initial offer.
J: Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

So, the situation is about an art collector and a woman at a party. They discuss a painting, and the collector offers to sell it for $10k, giving her 30 days to decide. Then, on March 25, he writes to withdraw the offer, which she gets on the 26th. But she writes back on the 27th accepting the original offer, which he gets on the 28th. Then they have some phone talks, and on April 10, she offers $15k if delivered by the 15th, and he agrees. But when he delivers on the 15th, she refuses to pay more than $10k.

The question is about whether the art collector can claim breach of contract. The options are from A to J.

Alright, first, I need to remember the rules about offers and acceptances. So, an offer is a promise to do something in exchange for performance. The offeror can revoke the offer any time before acceptance, unless it's an option contract or under the statute of frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in writing.

Wait, in this case, the offer was made on March 15 with a 30-day period. So the offer should have been open until April 14 (since March has 31 days, so 15 + 30 days would be April 14). But the collector tried to revoke it on March 25, which is within the 30-day period. So the question is whether that revocation was effective.

But wait, when can an offer be revoked? Generally, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance, except if it's an option contract (where the offeror is bound for a certain time, usually in exchange for consideration) or if the offeree has started performance under the offer, which might make it irrevocable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

In this case, the offer was open for 30 days without any mention of consideration for the option, so it's likely not an option contract. So the collector could revoke it before acceptance. But when did the revocation happen?

He sent the revocation on March 25, which the woman received on March 26. She then accepted on March 27, which he received on March 28. So the revocation was received by her before she accepted. So the question is, does her acceptance after the revocation count?

Wait, no. Because the revocation was sent on March 25, and she received it on the 26th. She then tried to accept on the 27th. So the problem is whether the offer was revoked before she accepted. Because once the offer is revoked, it's no longer open for acceptance.

So in contract law, the revocation becomes effective when the offeree receives it. So in this case, she received the revocation on the 26th, and then she sent her acceptance on the 27th. So her attempted acceptance was after the revocation. Therefore, there's no contract based on the original $10k offer because the offer was already revoked when she tried to accept.

So that would mean that there was no enforceable contract from the original offer. But wait, what about the subsequent agreement on April 10? They discussed and agreed on $15k. So perhaps that's a new contract.

In their phone call on April 10, she offered $15k, and he agreed. So that's a new offer from her, which he accepted. So that would be a valid contract for $15k. But when he delivered on the 15th, she refused to pay more than $10k, so she's in breach.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial offer was revoked, so when she tried to accept, it was too late. So the original offer was no longer on the table. Therefore, the only contract they have is the one from April 10 for $15k. So she's obligated to pay that amount.

Looking at the options:

Option F says that because they entered into a subsequent modification, she must pay $15k. Option I says the new agreement supersedes the initial offer. Option J says she's obligated under the April 10 terms because the offeror can revoke before acceptance.

Wait, but in the April 10 conversation, she made a new offer, which he accepted. So that's a new contract. So the issue is whether this new contract is enforceable.

But wait, contracts to sell goods (like a painting) for $500 or more must be in writing under the statute of frauds. But this is an oral agreement. Hmm, but I don't know if the painting is over $500. It's $15k, so definitely over. So under the statute of frauds, the contract needs to be in writing to be enforceable.

Wait, but they didn't have a written agreement for the $15k. So does that mean the contract isn't enforceable? Or is there an exception?

Alternatively, maybe the original offer was revoked, so the only contract is the new one, which is oral and unenforceable under the statute of frauds. So maybe there's no contract at all.

Wait, but the question is about whether the art collector can assert a breach of contract claim. So if the new agreement isn't enforceable because it's oral, then there's no contract, so no breach.

But I'm not sure if the statute of frauds applies here. The question doesn't mention that, but in real exams, they might include such details. Alternatively, maybe the parties don't need a writing because it's not for the sale of goods but a service? No, the painting is a good.

Wait, but the initial offer was for $10k, which is above $500, so it would require a writing. But the initial offer was revoked, so the only possible contract is the new one for $15k, which is also above $500. So without a writing, that contract isn't enforceable.

But wait, in the problem, they did have a subsequent agreement on April 10, but it's oral. So maybe that's not enforceable. So the art collector can't enforce the $15k agreement because it's not in writing.

Wait, but the initial offer was revoked, so the only possible agreement is the new one. If that's unenforceable, then no contract exists. So the art collector can't claim breach.

But looking back, the options don't mention the statute of frauds. So maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question focuses more on offer and acceptance, revocation, and modification.

So, the initial offer was revoked on March 25, received March 26. She tried to accept on March 27, but after revocation, so no contract from the initial offer.

Then, on April 10, she offers $15k for delivery by April 15, he agrees. That's a new contract. So she's bound by that, unless it's unenforceable for some reason.

But if the new contract is oral, and it's for the sale of goods over $500, it's not enforceable under the statute of frauds. So the art collector can't enforce it.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether the subsequent agreement was in writing. So perhaps we can assume that it's not, but the question is about the initial offer's revocation and the subsequent agreement.

Alternatively, maybe the subsequent agreement is a valid modification. But a modification of a contract typically requires consideration unless under the UCC's provisions for good faith.

Wait, but if there was no initial contract because the offer was revoked, then the modification idea doesn't apply. The April 10 agreement would be a new contract.

So, the art collector can't enforce the $10k contract because the offer was revoked before acceptance. The $15k agreement is a new contract, but perhaps it's unenforceable due to the statute of frauds.

Wait, but maybe the original offer's revocation is the key point here.

Let me go through the options again.

Option C says the collector must sell for $10k because the woman had the right to accept within 30 days. But that's not correct because the offer was revoked before she accepted.

Option D says the collector must sell for $10k because she accepted before revocation. But that's not true because the revocation was received before her acceptance.

Option F says because they modified, she must pay $15k. But if the new contract isn't in writing, it's unenforceable.

Option J says she's obligated under the April 10 agreement because the offeror can revoke before acceptance. Wait, but that's mixing two things. The April 10 agreement is a new contract.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial revocation was effective, so no contract from the first offer, but the new agreement is a separate contract. So she's obligated under the new terms, which she breached by not paying $15k.

So looking at the options, option J says she's obligated under the April 10 agreement because the offeror could revoke the original offer before acceptance. That seems correct because the original offer was revoked, so no contract there, but the new agreement is valid.

But wait, the new agreement is oral. So unless the statute of frauds applies, the new contract isn't enforceable. But the question doesn't mention that, so I'm probably overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the original offer wasn't revoked properly. Wait, how was the revocation done? He wrote a letter on March 25, which she received on March 26. So the revocation was effective upon her receipt. So her attempted acceptance on March 27 was after revocation, so no contract.

So the only possible contract is the new one on April 10, which is oral. If the painting is a good, the contract needs to be in writing. So the art collector can't enforce the $15k agreement because it's oral.

Wait, but the question is about whether the art collector can assert a breach claim. So if the only possible contract is the $15k oral one, which is unenforceable, then there's no contract, so no breach.

Alternatively, maybe the initial offer wasn't revoked because the revocation wasn't received before she accepted. Wait no, she received the revocation on the 26th, and sent her acceptance on the 27th. So the revocation was effective before she accepted, so no contract from the initial offer.

Wait, but what about the mailbox rule? When is an acceptance effective? The mailbox rule says that acceptance is effective when sent if it's by mail. But revocation is effective upon receipt. So the revocation was received on the 26th, making the offer no longer open. She sent her acceptance on the 27th, which would be after revocation. So no contract.

So the art collector can't enforce the $10k contract. The $15k contract is a new one, but it's oral. So if the statute of frauds applies, that's not enforceable either.

So looking at the options, option G says the woman isn't obligated to pay because the initial offer wasn't legally binding. But that's not right because the initial offer was revoked, making it impossible to accept.

Option F says that because of the subsequent modification, she must pay $15k. But without a writing, that's not enforceable.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the statute of frauds. Maybe the question expects us to disregard that or assume that the subsequent agreement is enforceable.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial offer was revoked, so the only contract is the new one, which is a valid, enforceable contract despite being oral. But that's not correct under the UCC.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is F, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial offer was revoked, so no contract from that. The new agreement is a separate contract. So the art collector can enforce the $15k agreement. But without a writing, it's not enforceable. So the collector can't recover.

Wait, but the options don't mention the statute of frauds. So perhaps the question is testing the revocation and new offer, not the writing requirement.

So, in that case, the initial offer was revoked, so no contract there. The new offer on April 10 is a valid contract, so the woman is obligated to pay $15k. So option H says she must pay $15k because she agreed during the phone call.

But option I says the new agreement supersedes the initial offer. Option J says she's obligated under the April 10 terms because the offeror could revoke the original.

Wait, but the April 10 agreement is a new offer and acceptance. So the woman is bound by that.

Looking back, the options:

Option F: subsequent modification, so $15k.

Option I: new agreement supersedes.

Option J: because the offeror could revoke, she's obligated under April 10.

I think the correct answer is that the woman is obligated under the April 10 agreement because that's a new contract.

So among the options, option J says that because the offeror revoked before acceptance, she's obligated under the April 10 agreement. So J seems correct.

Wait, but option H says she must pay $15k because she agreed during the phone call. That's also correct, but perhaps the reasoning is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial revocation was ineffective. Wait, no, because she received it before accepting.

Wait, perhaps the revocation was not effective because the offer was for 30 days, and the revocation came within that period. Wait, no, an offer can be revoked anytime before acceptance unless it's an option.

So, the initial offer was revoked before she accepted, so no contract. Then the new agreement on April 10 is a new contract.

Therefore, she's obligated to pay $15k under the new contract.

Looking at the options, option J says that because the offeror could revoke before acceptance, she's obligated under the April 10 agreement.

So the answer would be J.

The question revolves around contract law principles, specifically the rules of offer, acceptance, revocation, and subsequent agreements. Here's the analysis:

1. **Initial Offer and Revocation**:  
   The art collector made an offer on March 15 to sell the painting for $10,000, giving the woman 30 days to accept. However, the collector revoked the offer in a letter sent on March 25, which the woman received on March 26. Under contract law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, and revocation is effective upon receipt by the offeree. Since the woman received the revocation on March 26 and attempted to accept the offer on March 27, her acceptance came after the offer had already been revoked. Therefore, no enforceable contract was formed based on the original $10,000 offer.

2. **Subsequent Agreement on April 10**:  
   On April 10, the woman offered to pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered by April 15, and the art collector agreed. This constitutes a new contract, as it was a separate offer and acceptance. The key issue here is whether this new agreement is enforceable. While the statute of frauds generally requires contracts for the sale of goods over $500 to be in writing, the question does not explicitly raise this issue. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the new agreement is enforceable.

3. **Breach of Contract**:  
   When the art collector delivered the painting on April 15, the woman refused to pay $15,000, breaching the terms of the April 10 agreement. Thus, the woman is obligated to pay $15,000 under the new contract.

**Analysis of Options**:  
- **Option A**: Incorrect. There is no mutual mistake of fact; the revocation and subsequent agreement are clear.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The lack of a written acceptance for the initial offer is irrelevant because the offer was revoked before acceptance.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The woman no longer had the right to accept the $10,000 offer after it was revoked.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The woman accepted after the offer was revoked, so no contract was formed for $10,000.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The revocation was properly effected when the woman received it on March 26.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The subsequent agreement is not a modification but a new contract.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The initial offer was revoked, but the subsequent agreement is enforceable.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While the woman agreed to $15,000, this option does not address the revocation of the initial offer.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The subsequent agreement does not "supersede" the initial offer; it replaces it entirely.  
- **Option J**: Correct. The art collector revoked the initial offer before acceptance, and the woman is obligated under the terms of the April 10 agreement.

**Conclusion**: The woman is obligated to pay $15,000 under the new agreement formed on April 10.
