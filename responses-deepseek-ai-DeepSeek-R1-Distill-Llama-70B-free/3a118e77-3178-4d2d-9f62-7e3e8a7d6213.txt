Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the mechanical equivalent of heat. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me some data about air at STP (standard temperature and pressure). The density is 0.00129 g/cm³, the specific heat at constant pressure is 0.238 cal/(g·K), and the ratio of the principal specific heats is 1.40. I'm supposed to find the mechanical equivalent of heat, which I remember is the amount of work equivalent to one calorie of heat. The options are all in ergs per calorie.

Wait, I think the mechanical equivalent of heat is usually denoted by J (but sometimes as J or other symbols, depending on context). Oh right, J is the symbol for the mechanical equivalent, measured in units like ergs per calorie or joules per calorie. Since the answer options are in ergs, I'll need to calculate J in ergs/cal.

I remember that the mechanical equivalent of heat relates to the specific heat capacities. Oh wait, specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) and constant volume (Cv) are involved here. The ratio of Cp to Cv is given as 1.40, which is the gamma (γ) value for air. So γ = Cp/Cv = 1.40.

Wait, if γ is 1.40, then Cp = γ * Cv. But I have Cp given as 0.238 cal/(g·K). So I can find Cv using γ. Let me write that down.

Cv = Cp / γ = 0.238 / 1.40. Let me calculate that. 0.238 divided by 1.4. Hmm, 1.4 times 0.17 is 0.238. So Cv is 0.17 cal/(g·K).

Now, I need to find the mechanical equivalent of heat. I think this involves the specific heats and the density. Oh right, I recall that the mechanical equivalent J is given by the formula J = (Cp - Cv) * M / (density * specific heat capacity in cal units?), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, I think the formula J is related to the gas constant R.

Wait, the gas constant R is equal to Cp - Cv. Because for ideal gases, R = Cp - Cv. So R = 0.238 - 0.17 = 0.068 cal/(g·K). Hmm, but wait, I thought R is usually expressed in different units. Maybe I need to convert calories to another unit or use the molar mass.

Wait, another approach. The mechanical equivalent of heat J can be calculated using the formula J = (Cp - Cv) * (M) / (density * 1000). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, I recall that J= (γ-1)/γ * (R) ... Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the Mayer's relation.

Mayer's relation states that the mechanical equivalent of heat, J, is equal to R (the gas constant) divided by the specific heat capacity at constant volume. Wait no, Mayer's formula says that J = R / (Cv). Or wait, no, I think J is equal to R multiplied by (Cp - Cv) divided by Cv. Because R = Cp - Cv, so J would be R / Cv. Let me check that.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) in SI units, but here we're dealing with calories. So perhaps I need to express R in cal units.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is J = (Cp - Cv) * (M) / (density * 1000). Wait, no, maybe it's more about the relation between the specific heats and the gas constant.

Wait, let me think. The gas constant R is given by R = Cp - Cv. So R = 0.238 - 0.17 = 0.068 cal/(g·K). Hmm, wait, no, that's not right because R is per mole, not per gram. Oh, right! Because Cp and Cv are given per gram, not per mole.

So I think I need to find R in terms of cal/(mol·K). To do that, I need the molar mass of air. Wait, what's the molar mass of air? Air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. Nitrogen is about 28 g/mol, oxygen 32 g/mol. Since air is about 78% N2 and 21% O2, the average molar mass would be roughly 28.97 g/mol. Let me confirm: nitrogen is 28.01 g/mol, oxygen 32.00, so (0.78*28.01 + 0.21*32.00) = (21.8378 + 6.72) = 28.5578 ≈ 28.96 g/mol. So M ≈ 28.96 g/mol.

So R is given by (Cp - Cv) * M. Wait, because Cp and Cv are in cal/(g·K), so when multiplied by M (g/mol), R would be in cal·g/(mol·g·K) → cal/(mol·K).

So R = (Cp - Cv) * M = (0.238 - 0.17) cal/(g·K) * 28.96 g/mol. Let's compute that. 0.068 * 28.96 ≈ 1.97 cal/(mol·K). Wait, but I think the actual R value is around 1.987 cal/(mol·K), so that's close enough, considering rounding.

So R ≈ 1.97 cal/(mol·K).

Now, J is the mechanical equivalent of heat, which is the amount of work equivalent to one calorie of heat. I remember that J = R * (γ - 1) / γ. Or wait, another approach: J is also equal to (γ - 1) * (R) ? Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing with other relations.

Wait, maybe using the formula J = (γ - 1) * (R) divided by something. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is J = R * (γ - 1) / (1 + γ (γ - 1))). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps J is given by (γ - 1) * R / (1 + γ (γ - 1))), but I'm not confident.

Wait, I think I should approach this differently. The mechanical equivalent of heat can be found using J = (5/2) R for monatomic gases and (7/2) R for diatomic, but that's when considering degrees of freedom. But air is mostly diatomic, so Cp would be (5/2) R, but that's in molar terms. Wait, but I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is J = (R) * (γ - 1) * (M) / (density * specific heat). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach. I remember that J is equal to (Cp - Cv) * M / (density * 1000). Wait, because J is in ergs per calorie. Let me see.

Wait, let's think about the units. J should have units of ergs per calorie.

Density is given in g/cm³, which is the same as kg/m³ when converted (1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³). But perhaps that's a side point.

So, the steps I think I should take are:

1. Calculate R = (Cp - Cv) * M. As I did earlier, which gives R ≈ 1.97 cal/(mol·K).

2. Then, J (mechanical equivalent) is equal to R multiplied by Avogadro's number? No, wait, that's for gas constant in terms of per molecule.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the formula for the mechanical equivalent of heat. I think it's given by J = (Cp - Cv) * (M) / (density * 1000) * 4.184 × 10^7 erg/cal. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, no, here's another approach. The mechanical equivalent J is the amount of work done (in ergs) equivalent to one calorie of heat. It can be calculated using the relation J = (γ - 1) * (R) * (M) / (density * 1000). Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the formula is J = (γ - 1) * (R) * (M) / (density * 1000). Let me check the units:

R is in cal/(mol·K), M is g/mol, density is g/cm³.

Wait, but (γ -1) is unitless. So (R * M) would have units of cal/(mol·K) * g/mol → cal·g/(mol²·K). Hmm, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of another approach. The mechanical equivalent of heat, J, is defined as the amount of work done in ergs when one calorie of heat is added. So J has units of ergs/cal.

I think the formula involves the specific heats and density. Let me recall that J = (Cp - Cv) * (M) / (density * 1000). Because:

- (Cp - Cv) is R in cal/(g·K)
- M is molar mass in g/mol
- density is g/cm³, which is g per cm³, so 1/cm³ is 1e6 m³? Wait, no, 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, but not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps it's:

J = (Cp - Cv) * M * 1000 / density

But wait, let me check the units.

(Cp - Cv) is cal/(g·K)

M is g/mol

density is g/cm³

So (Cp - Cv)*M would have units (cal/(g·K)) * (g/mol) ) → cal/(mol·K). Which is R, which we've already calculated as ≈1.97 cal/(mol·K).

So, R = 1.97 cal/(mol·K). Now, J is given by (R) * (something) to get ergs per calorie.

Wait, perhaps J is R multiplied by Avogadro's number, but that's for per molecule stuff. Alternatively, perhaps J = R * (M / density) * 1e7 ergs/g, because I need to convert units.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is J = (R) * (M) / (density) * 1e7 ergs/g. Because 1 cal = 4.184e7 ergs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think in terms of dimensional analysis. I need to get from cal to ergs.

1 cal = 4.184 × 10^7 ergs. So if I can find J in terms of cal, then multiply by 4.184e7 to get ergs. But wait, perhaps J is given as how much work (in ergs) equals 1 cal of heat. So J would be 4.184e7 ergs/cal times some factor.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the formula for the mechanical equivalent of heat for air.

I found a formula that says J = (γ - 1) * (R) * (M) / (density * 1000). Let me plug in the numbers.

Given that γ = 1.40, R is 1.97 cal/(mol·K), M is 28.96 g/mol, and density is 0.00129 g/cm³.

So, J = (1.40 - 1) * (1.97 cal/(mol·K)) * (28.96 g/mol) / (0.00129 g/cm³ * 1000).

Wait, let's compute this.

First, (γ-1) = 0.40.

Then, R * M = 1.97 * 28.96 ≈ let's calculate that.

1.97 * 28.96: 2 * 28.96 = 57.92, but subtract 0.03 *28.96=0.8688, so 57.92 - 0.8688 = 57.0512.

So 0.4 * 57.0512 ≈ 22.8205.

Now the denominator is 0.00129 g/cm³ * 1000 → 1.29 g/cm³? Wait, no:

Wait, 0.00129 g/cm³ multiplied by 1000 is 1.29 g/cm³. Hmm, that seems off because 0.00129 is already a very low density, but when multiplied by 1000, it becomes 1.29 g/cm³, which is more reasonable.

Wait, but wait: 0.00129 g/cm³ is the same as 1.29 kg/m³ because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 0.00129 g/cm³ = 1.29 kg/m³. But in the formula, it's multiplied by 1000, so perhaps the formula expects the density in kg/m³, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as J = (γ-1) * R * M / (density * 1000). Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, so J = 0.4 * 1.97 * 28.96 / (0.00129 * 1000).

Wait, 0.00129 * 1000 is 1.29.

So denominator is 1.29.

So numerator is 0.4 * 1.97 * 28.96.

Calculating numerator step by step:

1.97 * 28.96 ≈ let's compute 2*28.96 = 57.92, subtract 0.03*28.96=0.8688 → 57.92 - 0.8688 ≈ 57.0512.

Then multiply by 0.4: 57.0512 * 0.4 = 22.82048.

So numerator is approx 22.82048.

Denominator is 1.29.

So J = 22.82048 / 1.29 ≈ let's compute that.

1.29 * 17 = 21.93 → 22.82 - 21.93 = 0.89 left. So 17 + (0.89/1.29) ≈ 17 + 0.69 ≈ 17.69.

So J ≈ 17.69 cal/(something). Wait, no, that can't be because J is in ergs per calorie.

Wait, perhaps I missed some unit conversions. Let me think again.

Wait, R is in cal/(mol·K), M is g/mol, density is g/cm³.

So (γ-1) is unitless.

(R * M) has units cal/(mol·K) * g/mol = cal·g/(mol²·K). Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R in erg units instead. Because the final J is in ergs/cal, so I need to convert R from cal to ergs.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

J = (Cp - Cv) * M / (density) * (4.184e7 ergs/cal).

Because (Cp - Cv) is R in cal/(g·K), multiplied by M (g/mol) gives R in cal/(mol·K). Then, to get ergs, we can multiply by 4.184e7 ergs/cal.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, (Cp - Cv) is R in cal/(g·K). Multiply by M (g/mol) → R in cal/(mol·K). Then, 1 cal is 4.184e7 ergs, so R in ergs would be 1.97 cal/(mol·K) * 4.184e7 ergs/cal → 1.97 * 4.184e7 ≈ 8.24e7 ergs/(mol·K).

But how does that tie into J?

Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think of another approach.

The mechanical equivalent J is the amount of work (ergs) equivalent to 1 calorie of heat. For an ideal gas, J can be calculated using J = (γ - 1) * (R) * (M) / (density) * 1e7 ergs/g. Wait, let me see:

Wait, J has units of ergs/cal. So, (γ-1) is unitless, R is in cal/(g·K), M is g/mol, density is g/cm³.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is J = (γ -1) * (R) * (M) / (density) * 1e7 ergs/g.

Wait, let me try that.

R is 0.068 cal/(g·K), as Cp - Cv is 0.238 - 0.17 = 0.068.

So J = (0.40) * (0.068 cal/(g·K)) * (28.96 g/mol) / (0.00129 g/cm³) * 1e7 ergs/g.

Wait, let's compute each part.

First, 0.40 * 0.068 = 0.0272.

Then, 0.0272 * 28.96 = let's calculate that. 0.0272 * 30 ≈ 0.816, but since it's 28.96, it would be a bit less. 0.0272 * 28.96 = let me compute 0.0272 * 28 = 0.7616, and 0.0272 * 0.96 = 0.026112. So total ≈ 0.7616 + 0.026112 = 0.787712.

Now, divide by density: 0.787712 / 0.00129. Let's compute that. 0.00129 is 1.29e-3. So 0.787712 / 0.00129 ≈ 787.712 / 1.29 ≈ Let me compute 787.712 ÷ 1.29.

1.29 * 610 = 786.9 → so approximately 610. So 610 times 1.29 is 786.9, which is close to 787.712. So it's approximately 610.7.

Now, multiply by 1e7 ergs/g: 610.7 * 1e7 = 6.107e9 ergs/cal.

Wait, that's 6.107e9, but the answer options are up to 10^8, so that's way too high. That can't be right. So I must have messed up the units somewhere
