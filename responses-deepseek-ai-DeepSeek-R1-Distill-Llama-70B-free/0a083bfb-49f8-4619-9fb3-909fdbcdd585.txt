Okay, so I've got this problem about a nozzle with airflow, and I'm supposed to find the outlet cross-sectional area. Hmm, I remember from my thermodynamics class that nozzles involve some kind of steady flow process. Let me try to break this down.

The given data is:
- Mass flow rate (m_dot) is 0.25 lb/sec.
- Inlet conditions: P_i = 35 psia, T_i = 650°R, specific volume v_i = 6.0 ft³/lb. Velocity at inlet is 550 fps.
- Outlet pressure is 18 psia.
- The process is frictionless and follows pv^1.4 = constant. Oh right, that's the isentropic relation for an ideal gas with specific heat ratio gamma=1.4 for air.

They want the outlet area. I think the steps involve finding the outlet specific volume, then the outlet velocity, and since mass flow rate (m_dot) is constant, use the formula m_dot = A*v*rho, but since specific volume is 1/rho, maybe I can relate that.

Wait, specific volume v is the volume per unit mass. So v = V/m. Here, mass flow rate is m_dot = dm/dt, so m_dot = A * V * rho, but rho is 1/v. So m_dot = A * (1/v) * V. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of velocity.

Alternatively, for steady flow, the mass flow rate is continuous, so m_dot is same at inlet and outlet.

I think I can use the equation of state and the given process equation to find v (specific volume) at the outlet.

First, at the inlet, the specific volume v_i is given as 6.0 ft³/lb. Since the process is pv^1.4=constant, I can relate inlet and outlet states.

So, p_i * (v_i)^(1.4) = p_o * (v_o)^(1.4)

Plugging in the numbers:
35 psia * (6.0)^1.4 = 18 psia * (v_o)^1.4

Let me compute that. Let's calculate 35/18 first. 35 divided by 18 is approximately 1.9444.

So, (6.0)^1.4 = 6^1.4. Let me compute that. 6^1=6, 6^0.4 is about, since 2^3=8 and 2^0.4 is around 1.3195. Wait, maybe using natural logs is better.

Wait, ln(6) is about 1.7918, 1.4 times that is 2.5065. Exponentiate: e^2.5065 ≈ 12.2. So 6^1.4 ≈12.2.

So the left side is 35 * 12.2 ≈ 427.

So 427 = 18 * (v_o)^1.4 → v_o^1.4 = 427 /18 ≈23.722 → v_o = (23.722)^(1/1.4)

Hmm, what's 23.722^(1/1.4)? Let me think. 1/1.4 is approximately 0.7143.

Let me compute ln(23.722) = around 3.17. Multiply by 0.7143 → ~2.263. e^2.263 ≈9.6.

Wait, or maybe another approach: 23.722^(0.7143). Let me try some numbers. 8^0.7143 is 8^(5/7) = (8^(1/7))^5. 8^(1/7) is 2^(3/7) ≈1.3. So 1.3^5≈ 3.7. Hmm, maybe not exact. Alternatively, 9.6^1.4=?

Wait, 9.6 is about 10, 10^1.4 is 10^(14/10)= (10^0.1)^14 → 10^0.1 is about 1.2589 → (1.2589)^14. Let me approximate:

Wait, 1.2589^2 ≈1.584, ^3 ≈2.0, ^4≈2.51, ^7≈ ~3.8, ^14 is (3.8)^2 ≈14.44. So 10^1.4 ≈25.1, which is higher than 23.722. So maybe 9.6 would give about 23.7, which is close to our value.

So v_o is approximately 9.6 ft³/lb.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 35*(6^1.4) =35*12.2 ≈ 427.

18*(v_o)^1.4=427 → v_o^1.4=427/18 ≈23.722.

Then v_o = 23.722^(1/1.4) ≈ e^( (ln(23.722)) / 1.4 )

ln(23.722)=3.170.

3.170/1.4≈2.2643. e^2.2643 ≈9.6.

So v_o≈9.6 ft³/lb.

Now, the next step is to find the outlet velocity. Since the process is isentropic and reversible, we can use the steady flow energy equation. But wait, since the change in elevation is negligible, and assuming it's a nozzle (so no work or heat transfer), the specific kinetic energy plus specific enthalpy remains constant.

So, h_i + (V_i)^2/(2g_c J) = h_o + (V_o)^2/(2g_c J)

But wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, for an ideal gas, the enthalpy change can be found using the temperature change. But maybe it's easier to compute the velocity using the area relation.

Wait, another approach is to compute the mass flow rate at the inlet and outlet. Since it's steady, m_dot is the same. So m_dot = A_i * rho_i * V_i = A_o * rho_o * V_o.

But wait, rho is 1/v, so rho_i =1/6.0 lb/ft³, rho_o =1/9.6 lb/ft³.

So, 0.25 lb/s = A_i * (1/6) * 550 = A_i * (550/6) ≈A_i *91.6667.

So A_i = 0.25/(91.6667) ≈0.002727 ft².

Wait, but I don't know if that's needed. Alternatively, perhaps using the continuity equation and the energy equation.

Wait, maybe I can find V_o using the Stagnation temperature or some relation.

Wait, another approach is to use the relation for the speed of sound and the Mach number. But I'm not sure if that's the quickest way.

Alternatively, perhaps using the area-velocity relation. For a nozzle, since the flow is expanding, the velocity increases.

Wait, the energy equation for a nozzle (steady flow, negligible potential energy, adiabatic, frictionless) is:

h_i + (V_i)^2/(2) = h_o + (V_o)^2/(2)

But since it's an ideal gas, h depends only on temperature. So, the change in enthalpy is c_p (T_o - T_i).

But I'm not sure about the values of cp. Oh, for air, cp is about 0.24 BTU/lbm.R, but I might need to convert units.

Wait, maybe it's better to relate the velocities using the specific volume and the mass flow.

Wait, the mass flow rate is m_dot = A * (1/v) * V.

So m_dot = A_i * (1/v_i) * V_i = A_o * (1/v_o) * V_o.

So 0.25 = A_i * (1/6) *550 = A_o * (1/9.6) * V_o.

So, A_i * (550/6) = A_o * (V_o)/(9.6)

If I can find V_o, I can relate A_o.

Alternatively, I can express V_o in terms of V_i and the specific volumes.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the velocity at the outlet can be found using the relation from the equation of state and the energy equation.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that for an isentropic process, the relation between temperature and specific volume is T v^{gamma-1} = constant.

Given that, T_i * v_i^{0.4} = T_o * v_o^{0.4}

Because gamma is 1.4, so gamma-1 = 0.4.

We can find T_o in terms of T_i.

Given T_i =650 R, v_i=6, v_o=9.6.

So, T_o = T_i * (v_i / v_o)^(0.4) = 650 * (6/9.6)^0.4.

6/9.6 = 0.625.

0.625^0.4. Let's compute that. 0.625 is 5/8.

Take natural log: ln(0.625)= -0.4700. Multiply by 0.4 → -0.188. Exponentiate: e^-0.188 ≈0.828.

So T_o ≈650 *0.828 ≈538.2 R.

Now, using the energy equation for the nozzle:

h_i + (V_i^2)/2 = h_o + (V_o^2)/2.

But for ideal gases, h = c_p T, so:

c_p (T_i - T_o) = (V_o² - V_i²)/2.

We can solve for V_o.

But I need the value of c_p in consistent units.

Wait, in English units, c_p for air is about 0.24 BTU/lbm-°R.

But I need to convert BTU to ft-lbf, since velocity is in ft/s.

1 BTU ≈778 ft-lbf.

So, c_p = 0.24 * 778 ≈186.9 ft-lbf/lbm-°R.

Wait, but wait, units: Let me make sure. c_p in BTU/(lb·°R) → 0.24 BTU/(lb·°R) → 0.24 * 778.169 ft·lb/(lb·°R) → approx 186.8 ft·lb/(lb·R).

Now, temperature difference is T_i - T_o =650 -538.2=111.8 °R.

So, c_p (T_i - T_o) = 186.8 * 111.8 ≈20,900 ft·lb/lb.

Wait, units: 186.8 ft·lb/(lb·R) * 111.8 R → 186.8 *111.8 ≈20,900 ft·lb/lb.

Now, the kinetic energy difference is (V_o² - V_i²)/2 (in ft²/s²), so:

20,900 ft·lb/lb = (V_o² - (550)^2)/2 * 1 lb·ft/lb (since 1 lb = 32.174 lbm·ft/s²? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with units here.)

Wait, for the units to work out, let me think: The left side is in ft·lb/lb, and the right side is (ft²/s²) divided by 2. But 1 lb is 32.174 lbm·ft/s², but perhaps I should use the conversion factor g_c.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that 1 lb = 32.174 lbm·ft/s². So, when dealing with energy per unit mass (ft·lb/lbm), we need to include the gravitational conversion factor g_c.

So, the equation should be:

c_p (T_i - T_o) * g_c = (V_o² - V_i²)/(2 * g_c)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the energy equation with proper unit conversion.

Wait, the specific kinetic energy is (V^2)/(2 g_c), where g_c is 32.174 lbm-ft/(lbf-s²).

So the energy equation:

h_i + (V_i^2)/(2 g_c) = h_o + (V_o^2)/(2 g_c)

So, h_i - h_o = (V_o^2 - V_i^2)/(2 g_c)

h_i - h_o = c_p (T_i - T_o) → 186.8 *111.8 = 20,900 ft·lb/lbm.

Wait, units: 186.8 is ft·lb/lbm/°R * 111.8 °R → ft·lb/lbm.

So, 20,900 ft·lb/lbm = (V_o^2 -550^2) / (2 *32.174) lbm·ft/lbf * lbf → Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, 2 g_c is 2 *32.174 ≈64.348 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²).

So,

20,900 ft·lb/lbm = (V_o^2 - 302500) /64.348 → (V_o^2 - 302500) = 20,900 *64.348 ≈1,343,000.

So V_o^2 = 1,343,000 + 302,500 ≈1,645,500 → V_o ≈sqrt(1,645,500) ≈1283 ft/s.

Wait, that's a huge velocity. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the unit conversions. Let me think again.

c_p is in BTU/lbm.R, which is 0.24. To convert to ft·lb/lbm.R: 0.24 BTU/(lb·R) *778.169 ft·lb/BTU = 0.24 *778.169 ≈186.96 ft·lb/(lb·R).

Then, delta T is 111.8 R, so c_p delta T is 186.96 *111.8 ≈20,900 ft·lb/lbm.

So that part seems right.

Then, the energy equation is c_p (T_i - T_o) = (V_o^2 - V_i^2)/(2 * g_c), because the kinetic energy per unit mass is (V^2)/(2 g_c), since in English units, 1 Btu is 778 ft·lb, and 1 lb force is 32.174 lbm·ft/s².

So, 20,900 ft·lb/lbm = (V_o² -550²)/(2 *32.174)

Calculate denominator: 2 *32.174 ≈64.348.

So, V_o² = (20,900 *64.348 ) +550².

20,900 *64.348 → Let's compute that: 20,000 *64.348=1,286,960; 900*64.348=57,913.2 → total≈1,344,873.2.

Add 550²=302,500 → total ≈1,647,373.2.

V_o= sqrt(1,647,373) ≈1284.5 ft/s.

That's about 1285 ft/s.

Now, knowing V_o, we can find A_o using the mass flow rate.

m_dot = A_o * rho_o * V_o → 0.25 lb/s = A_o * (1/9.6 lb/ft³) *1284.5 ft/s.

Wait, rho_o =1/v_o →1/9.6 lb/ft³.

So, 0.25 = A_o * (1/9.6) *1284.5 → A_o = 0.25 *9.6 /1284.5.

Compute that: 0.25 *9.6 =2.4.

2.4 /1284.5 ≈0.001869 ft². Approximately 0.00187 ft².

Looking at the options, option A is 0.0019, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is A.

But let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate 20,900 *64.348.

Wait, 20,900 *60=1,254,000; 20,900 *4.348= approx 20,900 *4=83,600 and 20,900 *0.348≈7,270 → total ≈83,600+7,270=90,870 → total 1,254,000 +90,870=1,344,870.

So, V_o²=1,344,870 +302,500=1,647,370.

V_o=√1,647,370 → 1284.5 ft/s.

Then A_o= (0.25 lb/s) * (9.6 ft³/lb) ) / (1284.5 ft/s) → 0.25 *9.6=2.4; 2.4/1284.5≈0.001869 ft².

So option A is 0.0019 ft². That's the closest match.

To solve the problem, we analyze the nozzle flow under the given conditions. The key steps involve determining the outlet specific volume, outlet velocity, and finally the outlet cross-sectional area.

### Given Data:
- Mass flow rate: \( \dot{m} = 0.25 \, \text{lb/s} \)
- Inlet conditions: \( P_i = 35 \, \text{psia}, T_i = 650 \, \text{°R}, v_i = 6.0 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{lb}, V_i = 550 \, \text{fps} \)
- Outlet pressure: \( P_o = 18 \, \text{psia} \)
- Process relation: \( P v^{1.4} = \text{constant} \)

### Step 1: Outlet Specific Volume
Using the relation \( P v^{1.4} = \text{constant} \), we equate inlet and outlet states:
\[
P_i v_i^{1.4} = P_o v_o^{1.4}
\]
Substituting values:
\[
35 \cdot 6.0^{1.4} = 18 \cdot v_o^{1.4}
\]
First, calculate \( 6.0^{1.4} \). Using approximations:
\[
6.0^{1.4} \approx 12.2
\]
Thus:
\[
35 \cdot 12.2 = 18 \cdot v_o^{1.4} \implies v_o^{1.4} = \frac{427}{18} \approx 23.722
