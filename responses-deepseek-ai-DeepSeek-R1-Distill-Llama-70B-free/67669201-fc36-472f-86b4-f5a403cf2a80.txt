Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability of drawing a white chip, P(W). Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, let me understand the setup. There are four bowls: B1, B2, B3, and B4. Each bowl has different compositions of chips. The probabilities of selecting each bowl are given, and then from the selected bowl, a chip is drawn at random. I need to compute the total probability of getting a white chip.

So, the bowls and their contents:

- Bowl B1: 2 white chips. So total chips here are 2. So the probability of drawing white from B1 is 2/2 = 1, because all are white.
- Bowl B2: 2 red chips. So total is 2. P(white|B2) is 0/2 = 0. All red.
- Bowl B3: 2 white and 2 red. Total 4 chips. So P(white|B3) is 2/4 = 0.5.
- Bowl B4: 3 white and 1 red. Total 4 chips. So P(white|B4) is 3/4.

The probabilities of selecting each bowl are given as:

- P(B1) = 1/2
- P(B2) = 1/4
- P(B3) = 1/8
- P(B4) = 1/8

So I think I need to use the law of total probability here. That is, the overall P(W) is the sum over each bowl of P(W | bowl) * P(bowl).

Let me write that out:

P(W) = P(B1)*P(W|B1) + P(B2)*P(W|B2) + P(B3)*P(W|B3) + P(B4)*P(W|B4)

Plugging in the numbers:

P(W) = (1/2)*1 + (1/4)*0 + (1/8)*(1/2) + (1/8)*(3/4)

Wait, let me make sure I got the probabilities right. For B1, P(W|B1) is 1 (since both chips are white). For B2, it's 0. For B3, 1/2, and B4, 3/4.

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)*1 = 1/2.

Second term: (1/4)*0 = 0.

Third term: (1/8) * (1/2) = (1/8)*(0.5) = 1/16.

Fourth term: (1/8)*(3/4) = 3/32.

Now, adding all these together.

Let me convert them to 32 denominators to make it easier.

1/2 = 16/32.

0 is 0.

1/16 is 2/32.

3/32 is 3/32.

So adding: 16 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 21. So 21/32.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 21/32. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 1/8 is 4/32. So 1/8 * 1/2 is (4/32)*(1/2) = 4/64 = 1/16, which is 2/32. Correct.

Similarly, 1/8 is 4/32. 4/32 multiplied by 3/4 is (4*3)/(32*4) )= 12/128. Wait, wait. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, 1/8 is 4/32, and 3/4 is 24/32. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term step by step.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute each term as fractions and then add.

First term: 1/2 * 1 = 1/2.

Second term: 1/4 * 0 = 0.

Third term: 1/8 * 1/2 = 1/16.

Fourth term: 1/8 * 3/4 = 3/32.

So add them all:

1/2 + 0 + 1/16 + 3/32.

Let me convert everything to 32 denominators.

1/2 = 16/32.

1/16 is 2/32.

3/32 is 3/32.

So 16 + 2 + 3 = 21. So 21/32. So that's option J.

Wait, but looking back, I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I compute each term:

- (1/2)*1 = 1/2 = 0.5.

- (1/4)*0 = 0.

- (1/8)*(1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625.

- (1/8)*(3/4) = 3/32 ≈ 0.09375.

Adding them: 0.5 + 0 = 0.5; + 0.0625 → 0.5625; + 0.09375 → 0.65625.

0.65625 is 21/32 because 21 divided by 32 is 0.65625. So that's correct.

Looking at the options provided, option J is 21/32. So the answer should be J.

To find the probability of drawing a white chip, \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability. The bowls and their respective probabilities of being selected are:

- \( P(B_1) = \frac{1}{2} \), with \( P(W|B_1) = 1 \) (since all chips are white).
- \( P(B_2) = \frac{1}{4} \), with \( P(W|B_2) = 0 \) (since all chips are red).
- \( P(B_3) = \frac{1}{8} \), with \( P(W|B_3) = \frac{1}{2} \) (two white and two red chips).
- \( P(B_4) = \frac{1}{8} \), with \( P(W|B_4) = \frac{3}{4} \) (three white and one red chip).

The total probability is calculated as:

\[
P(W) = P(B_1) \cdot P(W|B_1) + P(B_2) \cdot P(W|B_2) + P(B_3) \cdot P(W|B_3) + P(B_4) \cdot P(W|B_4)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(W) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{4}
\]

Breaking it down:

- \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( \frac{1}{4} \cdot 0 = 0 \)
- \( \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \)
- \( \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)

Converting all terms to a common denominator of 32:

\[
P(W) = \frac{16}{32} + 0 + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{3}{32}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
P(W) = \frac{16 + 2 + 3}{32} = \frac{21}{32}
\]

Thus, the probability of drawing a white chip is \( \frac{21}{32} \), which corresponds to option J.
