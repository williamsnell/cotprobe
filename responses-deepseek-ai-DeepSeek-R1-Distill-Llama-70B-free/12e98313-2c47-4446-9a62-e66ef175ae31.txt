Okay, so I've got this problem about vapor pressures and activity coefficients. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a table with weight percentages of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) and water (H₂O) in a solution, along with their respective vapor pressures at 20°C. I'm supposed to find the activity and activity coefficients for each component in a solution that's 40% ethanol by weight.

Wait, what's activity? Oh right, the activity of a component in a solution is its effective concentration, which can be found by the ratio of its partial vapor pressure to the vapor pressure of the pure substance. So activity a = P / P°, where P° is the pure vapor pressure.

And the activity coefficient γ is the ratio of the activity to the mole fraction X. So γ = a / X.

But wait, in this case, the solutions are given in weight percent, not mole fractions. So I'll need to convert the weight percent into mole fractions first.

Let me jot down the given data for 40% ethanol. Looking at the table:

When weight % C₂H₅OH is 40, the P_C2H5OH is 14.7 torr, and P_H2O is 14.1 torr. 

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. Oh wait, the table actually lists the vapor pressures for each component for each solution composition. So for 40% ethanol, the ethanol's vapor pressure is 14.7 torr, and water's is 14.1 torr.

Wait no, no, the columns are a bit confusing. Let me look again. The first column is the weight percent of ethanol, from 0 to 100. Then the next two columns are P for ethanol and P for water, respectively.

So for 40% ethanol, P ethanol is 14.7, P water is 14.1.

Wait hold on, no, looking at the numbers. Wait, the first row after the headers is 0% ethanol, so P ethanol is 0, and P water is 17.5? No, wait, the columns are in the order: Weight percent C₂H₅OH, P_C₂H₅OH, P_H₂O. So for 40% ethanol, looking at the row where the first number is 40.0:

So P_C2H5OH is 14.7 torr, and P_H2O is 14.1 torr.

But wait, wait wait, looking more carefully. Let me read the table correctly. The first row is 0% ethanol, so all solution is water. Then P ethanol is 0 (makes sense), P water is 17.5? No, wait the numbers are 0, 20.0, 40.0, etc. Wait, maybe the first row is 0% ethanol, next is 20% ethanol, and so on. So the second row is 20% ethanol, P ethanol 12.6, P water 15.9. Third row is 40% ethanol: P ethanol 14.7, P water 14.1.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 40% ethanol's P ethanol is 14.7, but 20% ethanol has P ethanol 12.6. So maybe as ethanol increases, its vapor pressure increases, which makes sense.

Wait, but wait, pure ethanol (100% ethanol) has a P of 43.6 torr. So maybe yes, as ethanol concentration increases, its vapor pressure increases, but water's vapor pressure decreases as ethanol increases because the solution is getting more ethanol.

Wait, looking at the last row, 100% ethanol, P ethanol is 43.6, P water is 0. Makes sense.

So for 40% ethanol, P ethanol =14.7 torr, P water=14.1 torr.

Now, the activity for each component is P_i divided by their pure vapor pressure P_i°.

So for ethanol, a_ethanol = P_ethanol / P°_ethanol.

P° ethanol is the pure vapor pressure. Looking at the 100% ethanol row, P is 43.6 torr. So P° ethanol is 43.6 torr.

So a_ethanol = 14.7 / 43.6.

Let me calculate that: 14.7 /43.6 ≈ 0.337, approximately 0.337.

Similarly, for water, a_water = P_water / P°_water.

What's P°_water? At 0% ethanol (pure water), P_water is 17.5 torr. Wait, no, wait. When ethanol is 0%, the solution is pure water, so P_water would be the pure vapor pressure. So P°_water is 17.5 torr.

Wait, but wait. At 100% ethanol, P_water is 0. So the pure vapor pressure of ethanol is 43.6 torr, and pure vapor pressure of water is 17.5 torr.

So, for water in the 40% ethanol solution, P_water is 14.1 torr.

Thus, a_water = 14.1 /17.5 ≈ 0.8057.

Wait, but wait: isn't the solution 40% ethanol by weight, so for each component, their activities are based on their partial pressures relative to pure.

So a_ethanol ≈ 0.337, a_water ≈ 0.8057.

Wait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Next, I need to find the mole fractions of each component from the weight percentage.

Wait, the solution is 40% ethanol by weight. So let's say the solution has 40g ethanol and 60g water.

Molar mass of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is 2*12 + 6*1 + 16 + 1 = 24 +6 +17 = 46? Wait, 2 carbons (12*2=24), 6 hydrogens (6*1=6), one oxygen (16), and then another H? Wait, no, ethanol is C₂H₅OH: that's C₂H₅O H? So formula is C₂H₅OH, which is C₂H₆O. So molar mass is 2*12 + 6*1 + 16 = 24 +6 +16 = 46 g/mol.

Water is H₂O: molar mass is 2*1 + 16 = 18 g/mol.

So from 40g ethanol and 60g water, we can compute moles.

Moles ethanol = 40 g / 46 g/mol ≈ 0.8696 mol.

Moles water =60 g /18 g/mol = 3.3333 mol.

Total moles = 0.8696 + 3.3333 ≈ 4.2029 mol.

Mole fraction X_ethanol = 0.8696 /4.2029 ≈ 0.207.

Mole fraction X_water = 3.3333 /4.2029 ≈ 0.793.

So now, the activity coefficients γ are a_i / X_i for each component.

For ethanol: a_ethanol ≈ 0.337.

X_ethanol ≈ 0.207.

So γ_ethanol = 0.337 / 0.207 ≈ 1.628.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see any with γ_ethanol around 1.6. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the mole fractions. Let me recalculate.

Weight percent ethanol is 40%, so 40g ethanol and 60g water.

Ethanol moles: 40 /46 = 0.869565217 mol.

Water moles: 60 /18 = 3.33333333 mol.

Total moles: 0.869565217 + 3.33333333 ≈ 4.20289855 mol.

X_ethanol = 0.869565217 /4.20289855 ≈ 0.207.

X_water = 3.33333333 /4.20289855 ≈ 0.793.

So that's correct.

Now, from the activities:

a_ethanol = 14.7 /43.6 ≈ 0.337.

a_water =14.1 /17.5 ≈ 0.8057.

So activity coefficients:

γ_ethanol = a_ethanol / X_ethanol = 0.337 /0.207 ≈ 1.628.

γ_water = a_water / X_water = 0.8057 /0.793 ≈ 1.016.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: a_ethanol=0.207, a_water=0.793, γ_ethanol=1.06, γ_water=2.30.

Wait, that can't be right, because our a_ethanol is ~0.337, and option D is 0.207.

Option E: a_ethanol=0.34, a_water=0.66. Hmm, wait, our a_water is 0.8057. So that's not matching.

Wait, option I: a_ethanol=0.840, a_water=0.475. No, that's higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying P ethanol and P water. Let me re-examine the data.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the columns. Let me look at the table again.

The columns are: weight percent C2H5OH, P_C2H5OH, P_H2O.

So for 40% C2H5OH:

P_C2H5OH is 14.7 torr, P_H2O is 14.1 torr.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but pure ethanol's P is 43.6, so a_ethanol=14.7/43.6≈0.337.

Pure water's P is 17.5, from the 0% ethanol row, so a_water=14.1/17.5≈0.8057.

So activities are 0.337 and 0.806.

Then, mole fractions are 0.207 and 0.793.

So activity coefficients are 0.337/0.207 ≈1.628 and 0.806/0.793≈1.016.

But none of the options match this. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps the way the problem is set up, the activities are calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't using the pure substances as standard states, but another convention, but the question says to take pure substances as the standard state.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mole fractions differently. Let me think: wait, is the solution 40% ethanol by weight, which I calculated correctly, but perhaps the mole fractions are based on the entire solution. Wait, no, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the mole fractions using the formula:

X1 = (n1) / (n1 + n2)

Which is what I did.

Hmm. Let me check the options again. Let's see option D: a_ethanol=0.207, a_water=0.793. Wait, that's the same as their mole fractions. So that would imply γ=1 for each, but that's not the case. Because a_ethanol is 14.7/43.6=0.337, which is higher than X_ethanol=0.207.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: maybe the activity is calculated as (P_soln / P_pure), which I did correctly. So that should be right.

Wait, what if the solution is ideal? Then a_i = X_i, so γ=1. But the options don't have that, except option B, which is a=0.5 each, but that would be for 50-50 mole fractions, perhaps.

Wait, but our solution is 40% ethanol by weight, but mole-wise, it's about 20.7% ethanol. So the activity for ethanol is higher than its mole fraction, implying γ_ethanol is greater than 1, and activity for water is also higher than its mole fraction (0.8057 vs 0.793), so γ_water is just over 1. But none of the options seem to match this.

Wait, looking at option D: a_ethanol = 0.207, which is same as X_ethanol. So that would mean γ_ethanol=1. But according to our calculation, a_ethanol is 0.337, which is higher than X. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the solution as an ideal solution, so γ=1. Then a_i = X_i. So for 40% ethanol by weight, X_ethanol≈0.207, X_water≈0.793. So a_ethanol=0.207, a_water=0.793. Then γ=1 for both. But that would correspond to option D, but option D has γ_ethanol=1.06 and γ_water=2.30, which doesn't fit. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the data provided is not needed, and the problem uses Raoult's law with mole fractions. But Raoult's law says P_i = X_i * P_i°.

Wait, but in our case, the solution's P_i is given, so a_i = P_i / P_i°, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mole fractions. Let me re-calculate.

Ethanol: 40g /46 g/mol = 40/46 = 0.869565 mol.

Water: 60g /18 g/mol = 60/18=3.33333 mol.

Total moles: 0.869565 +3.33333 ≈4.2029 mol.

X_ethanol= 0.869565 /4.2029 ≈0.207.

X_water=3.33333 /4.2029≈0.793.

So that's correct.

Hmm, looking at option E: a_ethanol=0.34, a_water=0.66. That's in the ballpark of our a_ethanol=0.337, but a_water=0.66 is lower than our 0.8057.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the pure vapor pressures.

Wait, in the table, for 0% ethanol, P_H2O is 17.5. For 100% ethanol, P_C2H5OH is 43.6. So those are the pure component vapor pressures.

So P_pure ethanol is 43.6, P_pure water is 17.5.

Wait, but wait, when the solution is 40% ethanol, the P_ethanol is 14.7, and P_water is 14.1.

So a_ethanol=14.7/43.6≈0.337, a_water=14.1/17.5≈0.8057.

Mole fractions are 0.207 and 0.793.

So activity coefficients are 0.337/0.207≈1.628, and 0.8057/0.793≈1.016.

Looking back at the options, none of them match this exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the question is considering Henry's law instead of Raoult's? No, Henry's law applies to solutes at low concentrations, and Raoult's to solvents. But both ethanol and water are major components here, so Raoult's should apply to both.

Wait, but let me think about the possibility that the solution is using the weight percent directly as the activity, but that wouldn't make sense because activity is based on mole fractions or partial pressures.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using volume percent instead of weight percent? No, the question says weight percent.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the activities are calculated using the ratio of the partial pressures, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, looking at the options again, maybe I should check if any option has a_ethanol around 0.34 and a_water around 0.80. Let's see:

Option E: a_ethanol=0.34, a_water=0.66. No, a_water is lower.

Option D: a_ethanol=0.207, a_water=0.793. That's the same as the mole fractions, implying γ=1 for ethanol and 0.793/0.793=1 for water, but according to our calculation, γ_water is about 1.016.

Wait, but none of the options match. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the mole fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mole fractions correctly. Let me try again.

Molar masses:

Ethanol: C₂H₅OH → C:12*2=24, H:6*1=6, O:16, total 24+6+16=46 g/mol.

Water: H₂O → 2*1 +16=18 g/mol.

40g ethanol → moles=40/46 ≈ 0.8696 mol.

60g water → moles=60/18=3.3333 mol.

Total moles=0.8696+3.3333≈4.2029.

Mole fraction ethanol: 0.8696 /4.2029 ≈0.207.

Mole fraction water: 3.3333 /4.2029≈0.793.

So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula a = (P_i) / (P_pure_i), but without considering the mole fractions, which is what I did. But maybe the activity coefficient is calculated as a_i / (weight percent /100). No, that doesn't make sense because activity is based on mole fractions, not weight.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the activity coefficients as a_i / (weight percent in decimal).

No, that's incorrect because activity is based on mole fractions, not weight. So that approach wouldn't be right.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps option D is the closest. Let me see: option D says a_ethanol=0.207, a_water=0.793, which are the mole fractions, implying γ=1 for both. But according to our calculation, a_ethanol is higher than X_ethanol, so γ_ethanol>1.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the activity calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given P values are total pressures, but no, the columns are P for each component. So I think I'm correct in using P_i for each component.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where a_ethanol is approximately 0.337 and a_water is 0.805. Let me check all options.

Looking through the options:

Option E: a_ethanol=0.34, a_water=0.66.

Not matching water's activity
