Question:

One of the reasons Adam Smith supported the Free Market was because he believed that what is good for the individual is good for the country. So, since everyone would like to choose what they want to buy, it must be good for the country to give everyone free choice. Identify the error in Smith's logic and give a counter example.

Options:

A: Circular reasoning fallacy
B: Ad hominem fallacy
C: Slippery slope fallacy
D: Red herring fallacy
E: Hasty generalization
F: Straw man fallacy
G: Post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy
H: Fallacy of composition
I: False dilemma fallacy
J: Appeal to ignorance fallacy

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Adam Smith's support for the free market and the error in his logic. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question states that Adam Smith supported the free market because he believed that what's good for the individual is good for the country. The reasoning given is that since everyone wants to choose what they buy, giving them free choice must be good for the country. I need to find the logical fallacy in this reasoning and pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that Adam Smith's ideas are often related to the "invisible hand," where individual self-interest leads to societal benefits. But the question is about the error in his logic as presented here.

So, the argument is: if individuals choose what they want, the country benefits. The assumption is that individual good equals national good. But I think this might be an example of a specific fallacy.

Let me think about the different fallacies. There's the fallacy of composition, which is when someone assumes that what's true for a part is true for the whole. Like, if every person is good, the whole society is good. Wait, that sounds similar here. Smith's argument might be assuming that individual choices benefit the country without considering possible negative collective outcomes.

For example, if everyone acts in their own interest without regulation, it could lead to environmental degradation or monopolies. So, just because each person benefits individually doesn't automatically mean the country as a whole benefits. That seems like the fallacy of composition.

Looking at the options, option H is the fallacy of composition. So the error is assuming the whole (country) benefits just because the parts (individuals) do.

A counterexample could be something like everyone choosing to drive gas-guzzling cars. Individually, it's convenient and good for each person, but collectively, it leads to pollution and resource depletion, which is bad for the country.

So, the correct answer should be H.

The error in Adam Smith's logic is the **fallacy of composition**, which occurs when it's assumed that what benefits individuals will necessarily benefit the collective. A counterexample is everyone driving gas-guzzling cars for personal convenience, which harms the environment collectively.

Answer: H
