Okay, so I have this question about Piaget's theory of cognitive development, and I need to match the correct concept with the appropriate stage. Hmm, I remember that Piaget proposed four main stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each stage has certain characteristics and concepts associated with them. Let me try to think through each option.

The question lists options A through J, each pairing a concept with a stage. I need to go through each one and see which pair makes sense according to what I know about Piaget.

Starting with option A: Centration—sensorimotor stage. Centration is when a child focuses on one aspect of a situation and neglects others. I think centration is more associated with the preoperational stage, because that's when children are egocentric and have things like centration in their thinking, like in the conservation tasks. The sensorimotor stage is more about sensory experiences and motor activities, like object permanence. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Conservation—sensorimotor stage. Conservation is the understanding that certain properties remain constant despite changes in appearance. I remember that conservation is a concept tested in the concrete operational stage. Sensorimotor is before that, so B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Object permanence—concrete operational stage. Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when out of sight. I'm pretty sure this is a milestone of the sensorimotor stage, specifically around 9-12 months. So C is pairing it with the wrong stage.

Option D: Egocentrism—formal operational stage. Egocentrism is when a child has difficulty taking another's perspective. Egocentrism is a feature of the preoperational stage, I believe. Formal operational is more about abstract thinking and reasoning, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Egocentrism—sensorimotor stage. Egocentrism isn't part of sensorimotor. Sensorimotor is about motor skills and sensory development. Egocentrism comes later, so E is wrong.

Option F: Object permanence—preoperational stage. As I thought earlier, object permanence is achieved during sensorimotor, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Conservation—formal operational stage. Conservation is actually a part of the concrete operational stage. Formal is the next stage, so G is wrong.

Option H: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning—formal operational stage. This sounds right. Formal operational stage is where adolescents develop the ability to think abstractly and reason hypothetically. They can consider possibilities and deduce outcomes logically. So H seems correct.

Option I: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning—preoperational stage. No, preoperational is before that. They can't handle hypothetical reasoning yet. So I is wrong.

Option J: Centration—concrete operational stage. Centration is in preoperational. Concrete operational is about logical operations, but centration is more about focusing on one aspect, which is preoperational. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. Centration occurs during the preoperational stage because children at that age are egocentric and can't decenter. So that's why A was wrong because it paired centration with sensorimotor. So the correct pair is H: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning with formal operational stage.

According to Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, the correct matching of concept and stage is:

**H: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning—formal operational stage.**

This is because the formal operational stage is characterized by the development of abstract thinking and the ability to engage in hypothetical-deductive reasoning, where individuals can consider possibilities and logically deduce outcomes.

Answer: H
