Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Cicero's philosophy, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman, and he wrote a lot about ethics and moral philosophy. His works include "On Duties" (De Officiis), which is a key text in Stoic thought, though Cicero was an eclectic, drawing on various schools.

The question is about what Cicero claims is sometimes permissible. The options are A through J, each presenting a different action.

Let me go through each option and see what I recall about Cicero's views.

Option A: Commit acts of injustice. That doesn't sound right. Cicero was big on justice being one of the cardinal virtues. He probably wouldn't say it's permissible to act unjustly.

Option B: None of the above. Hmm, this could be a possibility if all others are incorrect.

Option C: Harm others for personal gain. That seems unethical, and Cicero would likely oppose this since it goes against justice and moral integrity.

Option D: Act against societal norms. Cicero might have discussed situations where societal norms conflict with higher moral laws, but I'm not sure if he'd say it's permissible. Maybe in cases where the norms are unjust, but I'm not certain.

Option E: Disobey laws. I think in some cases, if a law is unjust, Cicero might agree that it's permissible to disobey. But I'm not 100% sure.

Option F: Steal. Stealing is a form of injustice, so probably not permissible according to Cicero.

Option G: Break one’s promises. Keeping promises is part of fidelity, another virtue. Breaking them would generally be wrong, unless under extreme circumstances. But I'm not sure if Cicero would allow that.

Option H: Betray one's friends. Betrayal goes against loyalty, which is important. I don't think Cicero would condone this.

Option I: Lie. This is interesting. In "On Duties," I recall a discussion about truthfulness. Cicero says that lying is generally wrong but might be permissible in certain situations, like to protect someone or for the greater good. So perhaps lying is sometimes permissible according to him.

Option J: Act out of selfishness. Cicero emphasizes virtue and the common good. Selfishness would be against that, so I don't think he'd say it's permissible.

Wait, so looking back, the question is about what Cicero claims is sometimes permissible. So the correct answer would be the action he allows under certain circumstances.

I remember that Cicero discussed the idea that there might be situations where telling a lie could be justifiable. For example, if it's a small lie that doesn't harm others but prevents a greater harm. Or maybe in cases where it's a white lie. Alternatively, he might have said that it's permissible to lie when it serves a higher moral purpose.

So Option I: Lie, would be the correct answer because Cicero does think that lying is sometimes permissible, even though it's generally wrong.

Cicero, in his work "On Duties," discusses the nuances of moral behavior and acknowledges that certain actions, while generally wrong, may be permissible under specific circumstances. Among the options provided, lying (Option I) stands out as an action Cicero might deem permissible in situations where it serves a higher moral purpose or prevents greater harm. This aligns with his reasoning that while lying is typically unethical, there are exceptions where it can be justified.

Answer: I
