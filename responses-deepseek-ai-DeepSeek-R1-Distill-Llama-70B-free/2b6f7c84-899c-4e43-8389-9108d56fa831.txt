Okay, so I've got this problem about a six-pole dynamo with interpoles. The question is in two parts, a and b. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, part (a) asks me to determine the number of coils, slots, and commutator bars. The given data includes 360 inductors on the armature, three turns per coil, and two coil sides per slot.

Wait, wait. Wait, inductors? Hmm, I think that's a typo. Probably they mean inductors as the conductors. So, the armature has 360 conductors.

Each conductor is part of a coil. So, each coil has a certain number of turns. Oh, right, the problem says three turns per coil. So each coil has 3 turns.

Wait, but what's the relation between conductors and coils? Each coil has two sides, right? Because in a DC machine, each coil has two sides (the two ends) which are placed in the slots. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says two coil sides per slot. That's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, each slot contains a certain number of coil sides. So if each slot has two sides, then each slot has two conductors. Hmm, but wait, in a typical DC machine, each slot has multiple conductors. But perhaps in this case, each slot has two sides, meaning each slot has two conductors.

So, each slot has two conductors, which are the two sides of a coil. So each coil would have two sides in a slot. So, for each coil, each of its two sides is in separate slots, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe each slot contains two coil sides. So, for example, each slot has two conductors from different coils.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to break it down.

The total number of conductors (let's say Z) is 360. Each coil has 3 turns. Each turn has two conductors (since each turn is a loop). Wait, no, each turn is a single conductor loop. Wait, no. Wait, each turn is a loop, but each loop has two conductors (the two sides). So each turn has two conductors.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this with the formula for the number of conductors.

Wait, the number of conductors Z is related to the number of coils (C), the number of turns per coil (T), and the number of parallel paths (A). But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, for a simplex lap winding, each parallel path has Z/A conductors. Hmm, maybe that's getting too ahead.

Wait, another approach. Each coil has T turns, so each coil has T x 2 conductors because each turn is a loop with two sides. So for 3 turns per coil, each coil uses 6 conductors. But wait, that's not efficient because in a coil, the turns are connected in series, so each turn adds two conductors. So for 3 turns, the coil has 3x2=6 conductors.

Wait, but I might be wrong here. Because for a single coil, each turn contributes two conductors (top and bottom), but when you connect the turns in series, the total number is the number of turns multiplied by 2. So yeah, for 3 turns, that's 6 conductors per coil.

But then, the total number of conductors is 360. So the number of coils would be 360 divided by (3*2), which is 360/6=60 coils. Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options have 60 except option I. Wait, but wait, the problem says each slot has two coil sides. So I might be missing something here.

Wait, maybe each slot has two sides of coils. So each slot contains two conductors, each from different coils. So if each slot has two sides, then the number of slots S is Z / (conductors per slot). Since each slot has two conductors, S = 360 / 2 = 180 slots. But that doesn't match any option either. Wait, looking at the options, option A has 180 for all three, but that's just a thought.

Wait, no, perhaps each slot has more than two. Let me think again. The problem states two coil sides per slot. So each slot contains two coil sides. Wait, each coil side is a conductor, so each slot has two conductors. So total slots S = Z / 2 = 360/2=180.

So number of slots is 180. Then, number of coils. Each coil has 3 turns, each turn has two conductors, so each coil has 3×2=6 conductors. So number of coils C= Z/(T×2) = 360/(3×2)=60.

Wait, but the options don't have 60 except option I, which has 60 for all three? Let me check:

Option I: Coils=Bars=Slots=60. No, wait, in option I, it's 60 for all three. But according to my calculation, the number of slots is 180. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The problem says: 360 inductors (I think that's conductors), three turns per coil, two coil sides per slot.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of armature winding. The number of conductors Z is 360. Each coil has 3 turns, so each coil uses 3×2=6 conductors. So number of coils C is Z/(turns × 2) = 360/(3×2) = 60.

But wait, each slot has two coil sides, so each slot has two conductors. So number of slots S is Z/2 = 180.

Wait, but then for the commutator bars, in a DC machine, the number of commutator bars equals the number of slots, unless there's something else. But wait, no, no, the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of coils, because each coil has two commutator bars (one at each end). Or wait, no. Wait, in a lap winding, the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of coils, but in a wave winding, it's equal to the number of poles.

Wait, no, in a simplex lap winding, the number of parallel paths equals the number of poles. The number of commutator bars equals the number of coils for lap windings, because each coil is connected to two bars. Wait, no, the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of coils multiplied by 2, divided by something. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of armature slots. Or is it equal to the number of coils?

Wait, in a simplex lap winding, the number of commutator bars equals the number of coils. Because each coil is connected between two commutator bars. So for each coil, you have two bars connected by the coil. So total commutator bars would be C × 2 / A, where A is the number of parallel paths. But in a simplex lap winding for a six-pole machine, A=6, the number of parallel paths equals the number of poles. So number of commutator bars is (C × 2)/6 = C/3.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused again. Let me try a different approach.

In this problem, we have a six-pole dynamo with interpoles, using a simplex lap winding.

Number of conductors Z = 360.

Each coil has T = 3 turns. So each coil has 3×2 = 6 conductors.

Number of coils C = Z / (T×2) = 360 / 6 = 60.

Number of slots S: each slot has two coil sides, so each slot has two conductors. So S = Z / 2 = 360/2=180.

Number of commutator bars: Since it's a lap winding, the number of commutator bars equals the number of coils. So commutator bars B = C =60. But wait, that doesn't seem to fit with any options.

Wait, looking at the options, none have 60 except option I, which has Coils=Bars=Slots=60. But according to my calculation, slots should be 180, which is much higher than any option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term "two coil sides per slot." Maybe it's two conductors per slot. Because a slot can have multiple conductors. So each slot holds two conductors, so the number of slots would be 360 / 2 = 180. But in the options, the only option with 180 is option A, which says Coils=Bars=Slots=180, but according to my calculation, coils are 60.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try another approach. Let me think about the relationship between the number of conductors, coils, and slots.

Each coil has two sides (entires), so each coil contributes two conductors. If each slot contains two coil sides, then each slot has two conductors, each from a different coil. So:

Number of slots S = (number of conductors Z) / (number of conductors per slot).

If two conductors per slot, S=360/2=180.

Number of coils C: each coil has T turns, each turn consists of two conductors. So each coil has T×2 conductors. So C= Z/(T×2) = 360/(3×2)=60.

So C=60, S=180.

Number of commutator bars: in a lap winding, the number of commutator bars equals the number of coils. So B=60.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 60 for B. The closest is option I, but in that option, all three are 60, which doesn't fit because S is 180.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of slots. So B=180. But in that case, the options don't match either.

Wait, perhaps the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of coils. So B=60. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says Coils=Bars=Slots=180. So if all three are 180, that would mean each slot has one coil, which doesn't make sense because each coil has multiple conductors. So I think I'm not interpreting the problem correctly.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of conductors per coil. Let me see, each turn contributes two conductors. So for T turns, that's 2T conductors per coil. So with T=3, 6 conductors per coil. So C=360/6=60.

So yes, 60 coils. Each slot has two conductors, so 180 slots.

Number of commutator bars: in lap winding, the number is equal to the number of coils times the number of parallel paths. Wait, no, perhaps for a simplex lap winding, the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of coils. Because each coil is connected between two commutator bars, but in a simplex lap, each parallel path has its own set of bars.

Wait, perhaps the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of coils because each coil is connected across two bars. So for 60 coils, we have 60 bars. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where Coils=60, Slots=180, and Bars=60. But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the number of slots is not 180. Let me think again. The problem says two coil sides per slot. Maybe each slot contains two coils, each with one side. So each slot has two conductors. So same as before, S=360/2=180.

Wait, perhaps the number of commutator bars is equal to the number of slots. So B=180. Then, looking at the options, option A says Coils=Bars=Slots=180, but according to my calculation, Coils=60, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach the problem from a different angle. Let's consider part (b) to see if that helps.

Part (b) asks to select suitable pitches for a simplex lap winding. The options give front pitch and commutator pitch.

In a simplex lap winding, the number of parallel paths A equals the number of poles P. So here, P=6, so A=6.

The front pitch (also known as the armature pitch) is the number of slots between the two sides of a coil. For a lap winding, the front pitch is usually around (number of slots per pole ± 1). Let me see.

The number of slots per pole is S/P. So S=180, P=6. So slots per pole = 30.

In a simplex lap winding, the front pitch is typically (slots per pole ± 1), but both progressive and retrogressive windings are considered. So front pitch Y would be either (S/P + 1) or (S/P -1). Wait, I think for a lap winding, the front pitch is given by Y = (S/P) + 1 for progressive, and Y = (S/P) -1 for retrogressive. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think. For a lap winding, the front pitch Y is the number of slots between the starting and ending points of a coil. For a simplex lap winding with A=6, each parallel path has S/A = 30 slots.

The front pitch Y is the number of slots a coil spans. So for a lap winding, Y is (S/P) - 1, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, Y could be (S/P ± 1), depending on the direction.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the front pitch Y is S/P ± some integer to ensure that the winding progresses correctly. For a six-pole machine, S=180, so S/P=30. So the front pitch would be 29 or 31? Or perhaps 30 plus or minus something else.

Wait, perhaps Y is calculated as (S/P) +1 for progressive and (S/P) -1 for retrogressive. So with S/P=30, Y_progressive=31 and Y_retrogressive=29. But looking at the options, none have 29 and 31. Let's check the options.

Option A: front pitch=8 and 10.

Option B: 9 and 10.

Option C: 11 and 13.

Option D: 12 and 14.

Option E:7 and 9.

Option F:8 and10.

Option G:10 and12.

Option H:10 and12.

Option I:9 and11.

Option J:11 and13.

Hmm, none of these options have 29 or 31. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the front pitch is calculated differently. Let me think again. The front pitch is the number of armature slots between the two sides of a coil. In a lap winding, the number of slots between them is (number of slots per pole) minus 1. So S/P =30, so Y=30-1=29 for progressive, and 30+1=31 for retrogressive. But again, options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the front pitch is the number of commutator segments between the two ends of the coil. No, that's the commutator pitch.

Wait, the front pitch is measured in armature slots, while the commutator pitch is measured in commutator bars.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of commutator bars. Since each coil connects two bars, the commutator pitch would be the number of bars between the two ends of a coil, which is Y_commutator = (number of bars per parallel path) × something.

Wait, in a simplex lap winding with A=6, the number of commutator bars B is equal to the number of coils. So if I have C=60 coils, then B=60. Then, each parallel path has B/A = 60/6=10 bars. So the commutator pitch would be 10 bars? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the commutator pitch is the number of bars between the two ends of a coil.

Wait, the commutator pitch is the number of bars that a coil spans. It's calculated as (B × A)/P, perhaps? Or maybe it's the number of parallel paths.

Wait, the commutator pitch for a simplex lap winding is given by B/A, where B is the number of commutator bars. So if B=60 and A=6, then commutator pitch is 60/6=10 bars. Hmm, but looking at the options, none have 10 as the commutator pitch, except perhaps option A, which says commutator pitch=3 bars.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

In a simplex lap winding, the number of commutator bars B equals the number of coils C because each coil connects two bars. So C=60, so B=60.

The commutator pitch Yc is the number of bars between the two ends of a coil. This is equal to the number of parallel paths A. Because each parallel path has B/A bars. So Yc = A. So for A=6, Yc=6. But looking at the options, none have Yc=6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the commutator pitch is the number of bars a coil spans, which would be B/(P) because in a lap winding, each parallel path adds a bar. So for 6 poles, Yc= B/6. If B=60, Yc=10. So that would be 10 bars. But none of the options have that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for an option where the number of slots is 180, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial parameters.

Wait, let me go back to part (a). Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of slots. Let's see.

The problem says two coil sides per slot. So each slot contains two sides of different coils. So each slot has two conductors. So S=360/2=180 slots.

Number of coils: each coil has 3 turns, each turn has two conductors. So each coil has 6 conductors. So C=360/(3×2)=60.

Number of commutator bars: in a lap winding, B=C=60
