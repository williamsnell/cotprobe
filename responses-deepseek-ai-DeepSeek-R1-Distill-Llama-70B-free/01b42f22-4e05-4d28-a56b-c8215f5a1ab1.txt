Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to use Stokes' Theorem to evaluate a surface integral of the curl of a vector field F over a surface S. Hmm, I remember that Stokes' Theorem relates a surface integral to a line integral around its boundary. So the theorem says that the integral of the curl of F over S is equal to the integral of F around the boundary curve of S, right?

First, let me write down what's given. The vector field F is z² i-hat minus 3xy j-hat plus x³y³ k-hat. So F = z² i - 3xy j + x³y³ k. The surface S is the part of z = 5 - x² - y² above the plane z=1. So S is a paraboloid opening downward, cut off at z=1.

Since we're using Stokes' Theorem, I need to find the boundary curve of S. The boundary occurs where z=1, so substituting z=1 into the equation of S, we get 1 = 5 - x² - y², which rearranges to x² + y² = 4. So the boundary is a circle of radius 2 in the plane z=1, centered on the z-axis.

Stokes' Theorem tells me that the integral over S of (curl F) dot dS is equal to the line integral around the boundary C of F dot dr. So I can compute either the surface integral or the line integral. Since the problem gives me F, maybe computing the line integral is easier.

But wait, before I jump into that, I should check if there's any symmetry or simplification possible. Let's think about the boundary curve C. It's a circle in the plane z=1, radius 2. So parametrizing this curve should be straightforward. Let me think about parametrizing it using polar coordinates.

Let me parameterize C with θ going from 0 to 2π. So the parametrization would be:

x = 2 cos θ,
y = 2 sin θ,
z = 1.

Then, the differential dr would be the derivatives of each component with respect to θ, multiplied by dθ. So:

dx/dθ = -2 sin θ dθ,
dy/dθ = 2 cos θ dθ,
dz/dθ = 0 dθ.

So the differential vector dr is (-2 sin θ i + 2 cos θ j + 0 k) dθ.

Now, I need to evaluate F along the curve C. So substitute x=2 cos θ, y=2 sin θ, z=1 into F.

F = (z²) i - (3xy) j + (x³ y³) k.

Plugging in:

z² = (1)^2 = 1,
so F_x = 1.

For F_y, 3xy = 3*(2 cosθ)(2 sinθ) = 3*4 cosθ sinθ = 12 cosθ sinθ.

Wait, actually, the j component is -3xy, so F_y = -3*(2 cosθ)(2 sinθ) = -12 cosθ sinθ?

Wait, no, wait: 3xy would be 3*(2 cosθ)(2 sinθ) = 12 cosθ sinθ, so F's j component is -12 cosθ sinθ.

As for F_z, x³ y³ = (2 cosθ)^3 * (2 sinθ)^3 = (8 cos³θ)(8 sin³θ) = 64 cos³θ sin³θ.

So putting it all together, F along C is:

F = (1) i + (-12 cosθ sinθ) j + (64 cos³θ sin³θ) k.

But wait, when taking the line integral, we're integrating F · dr. So F · dr is the dot product of F and the vector dr/dθ.

So F · dr = [F_x * dx/dθ] + [F_y * dy/dθ] + [F_z * dz/dθ].

Wait, but dz/dθ is zero, so that term drops out. So:

F · dr = (1)(-2 sinθ dθ) + (-12 cosθ sinθ)(2 cosθ dθ) + (64 cos³θ sin³θ)(0 dθ).

Simplify each term:

First term: 1*(-2 sinθ) = -2 sinθ.

Second term: (-12 cosθ sinθ)(2 cosθ) = (-24 cos²θ sinθ).

Third term is zero.

So F · dr = (-2 sinθ -24 cos²θ sinθ) dθ.

Factor out -2 sinθ:

= -2 sinθ (1 + 12 cos²θ) dθ.

So the line integral becomes the integral over θ from 0 to 2π of this expression.

So the integral is ∫ [from 0 to 2π] (-2 sinθ (1 + 12 cos²θ)) dθ.

Wait, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can split it up. Let me write it as:

-2 ∫ [0 to 2π] sinθ (1 + 12 cos²θ) dθ.

Expanding the terms inside:

= -2 ∫ [ sinθ + 12 sinθ cos²θ ] dθ.

So it's two integrals: -2 [ ∫ sinθ dθ + 12 ∫ sinθ cos²θ dθ ] evaluated from 0 to 2π.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ sinθ dθ from 0 to 2π.

Integral of sin is -cosθ. Evaluated from 0 to 2π:

At 2π: -cos(2π) = -1.

At 0: -cos(0) = -1.

So (-1) - (-1) = 0. So first integral is zero.

Second integral: ∫ sinθ cos²θ dθ from 0 to 2π.

Hmm, let me make a substitution. Let u = cosθ, then du = -sinθ dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ u² (-du). Because sinθ dθ = -du.

So the integral becomes - ∫ u² du.

The bounds: when θ=0, u=cos0=1; θ=2π, u=cos2π=1. Wait, but we're integrating over a full period. Wait, but when θ goes from 0 to π, u goes from 1 to -1, and then back to 1 as θ goes to 2π. So perhaps it's easier to compute the integral from 0 to π and double it? Or maybe not, perhaps just proceed.

Wait, but substitution: u=cosθ, du=-sinθ dθ.

So the integral is ∫ (u^2) * (-du) from u=1 to u=1.

Wait, that's because when θ=0, u=1. When θ=2π, u=1 again. So the limits are the same, which would make the integral zero. Because integrating from a to a gives zero.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me see.

Wait, the integral is ∫ (from θ=0 to θ=2π) sinθ cos²θ dθ.

u = cosθ → du = -sinθ dθ.

So, sinθ dθ = -du.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u²) (-du) from u=cos0=1 to u=cos2π=1. So the integral is from 1 to 1, which is zero.

So the second integral is 12 * 0 = 0.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because 12 times the integral of sinθ cos²θ, which is zero, so the entire line integral becomes:

-2 [0 + 0] = 0.

Wait, but that would mean the surface integral is zero, which is option E. But let me think again—did I make a mistake in the parametrization or in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the F · dr calculation. Let me double-check.

F on C is (1, -12 cosθ sinθ, 64 cos³θ sin³θ), and dr is (-2 sinθ, 2 cosθ, 0) dθ.

So F · dr = (1)(-2 sinθ) + (-12 cosθ sinθ)(2 cosθ) + (64 cos³θ sin³θ)(0).

Yes, that's correct. So -2 sinθ -24 cos²θ sinθ.

So that's correct. Then when we integrate, we have ∫ (-2 sinθ -24 cos²θ sinθ) dθ from 0 to 2π.

Which is -2 ∫ sinθ dθ -24 ∫ sinθ cos²θ dθ.

Wait, the first integral is zero because over a full period, the integral of sinθ is zero. The second integral: let me think again. The integral of sinθ cos²θ over 0 to 2π. But wait, perhaps I should compute it without substitution.

Alternatively, think about odd functions. The function sinθ cos²θ is an odd function around θ=π, perhaps. Let me check: sin(2π - θ) = -sinθ, cos²(2π -θ)=cos²θ. So the function is -sinθ cos²θ. So the function is odd with respect to θ=π. So integrating from 0 to 2π would give zero. Because for every point θ, the value at 2π-θ is the negative. So the integral over the full period is zero.

So yes, both integrals are zero, so the line integral is zero. Therefore, the surface integral is zero.

But wait, let's make sure that I didn't make any mistake in the parametrization. Because sometimes when you parametrize a curve, you have to ensure the orientation is correct. Stokes' theorem requires that the curve C is oriented positively, meaning that when you walk along C with the surface on your left, your head points in the direction of the orientation of S, which here is upwards. So for a paraboloid opening downward, the boundary is a circle at z=1, and the positive orientation would be counterclockwise when viewed from above.

Wait, in our parametrization, when θ increases, the point moves counterclockwise as viewed from above. So the parametrization is correct in terms of orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the curl first and then the surface integral, just to check if that also gives zero.

Let me try that. Compute curl F.

Curl F is the determinant of the following matrix:

|i     j     k|
|d/dx d/dy d/dz|
|F_x  F_y  F_z|

So F_x = z², F_y = -3xy, F_z = x³ y³.

So the partial derivatives:

dF_z/dy = 3x³ y²,
dF_y/dz = 0,
dF_z/dx = 3x² y³,
dF_x/dz = 2z,
dF_x/dy = 0,
dF_y/dx = -3y.

Putting it all together:

curl F = (dF_z/dy - dF_y/dz) i - (dF_z/dx - dF_x/dz) j + (dF_x/dy - dF_y/dx) k.

So:

= (3x³ y² - 0) i - (3x² y³ - 2z) j + (0 - (-3y)) k.

Simplify:

= 3x³ y² i - (3x² y³ - 2z) j + 3y k.

So curl F = (3x³ y²) i - (3x² y³ - 2z) j + 3y k.

Now, the surface integral is ∬_S curl F · dS.

But using Stokes' theorem, this is equal to the line integral, which we found to be zero. But perhaps if I compute the surface integral directly, I can confirm.

But computing the surface integral might be more involved. Let me see if I can parametrize the surface S and compute it.

The surface S is given by z = 5 - x² - y², for z ≥1, so 5 -x² -y² ≥1 → x² + y² ≤4, which is a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane.

So parametrize S using polar coordinates. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, with r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π. Then z = 5 - r².

So the parametrization is:

r(r,θ) = r cosθ i + r sinθ j + (5 - r²) k.

Then, to compute the surface integral, we need the normal vector, which is given by the cross product of the partial derivatives of r with respect to r and θ.

Compute partial derivatives:

dr/dr = cosθ i + sinθ j + (-2r) k.

dr/dθ = -r sinθ i + r cosθ j + 0 k.

Compute cross product: dr/dr × dr/dθ.

Using determinant:

i (sinθ * 0 - (-2r) * r cosθ) - j (cosθ * 0 - (-2r)*(-r sinθ)) + k (cosθ*(r cosθ) - (-r sinθ)*sinθ).

Wait, let me compute each component:

i component: (sinθ * 0) - (-2r)(r cosθ) = 0 + 2r² cosθ.

j component: - [ (cosθ * 0) - (-2r)(-r sinθ) ) ].

Wait, the j component comes with a negative sign. Let's compute inside:

cosθ * 0 = 0,

(-2r) * (-r sinθ) = 2r² sinθ.

Wait, wait, no, wait, the cross product dr/dr × dr/dθ is computed as:

i ( (sinθ)(0) - (-2r)(r cosθ) ) 
- j ( (cosθ)(0) - (-2r)(-r sinθ) )
+ k ( (cosθ)(r cosθ) - (-r sinθ)(sinθ) )

So,

i (0 + 2r² cosθ) 
- j (0 - (2r^2 sinθ)) 
+ k (r cos²θ + r sin²θ )

Simplify each component:

i: 2r² cosθ.

j: - [ 0 - 2r² sinθ ] → j: 2r² sinθ (because of the negative outside).

k: r (cos²θ + sin²θ) = r (1) = r.

So the cross product is (2r² cosθ) i + (2r² sinθ) j + r k.

This is the normal vector. Now, we need to ensure the orientation is correct. The problem says the surface is oriented upwards. So the normal vector should point upwards, which it does because the k component is positive (r is positive).

Now, the surface integral is the double integral over r and θ of (curl F) · (normal vector) dr dθ.

Wait, but wait, the surface integral is ∬ (curl F) · dS, where dS is the cross product dr/dr × dr/dθ dr dθ. So the integral becomes ∫∫ (curl F)(r,θ) · (dr/dr × dr/dθ) dr dθ.

So we need to express curl F in terms of r and θ as well.

Earlier, we found curl F = (3x³ y²) i - (3x² y³ - 2z) j + 3y k.

Expressed in terms of r and θ:

x = r cosθ,

y = r sinθ,

z =5 - r².

So:

x³ = (r cosθ)^3 = r³ cos³θ,

y² = (r sinθ)^2 = r² sin²θ,

x² y³ = (r cosθ)^2 (r sinθ)^3 = r^5 cos²θ sin³θ,

z =5 - r².

So substituting into curl F:

curl F = [3 (r^3 cos³θ) (r² sin²θ)] i 
         - [3 (r^5 cos²θ sin³θ) - 2(5 - r²) ] j 
         + [3 (r sinθ)] k.

Simplify each component:

i component: 3 r^5 cos³θ sin²θ.

j component: - [3 r^5 cos²θ sin³θ - 10 + 2r² ]

k component: 3 r sinθ.

Wait, let me recheck that:

j component: - [ 3 x² y³ - 2z ].

x² y³ = (r cosθ)^2 (r sinθ)^3 = r^5 cos²θ sin^3θ.

So 3 x² y³ = 3 r^5 cos²θ sin^3θ.

2z = 2(5 - r²) =10 - 2r².

Wait no, wait: the j component of curl F is -(3x² y³ - 2z), so:

= -3x² y³ + 2z.

So substituting:

= -3 r^5 cos²θ sin^3θ + 2(5 - r²).

So the j component is (-3 r^5 cos²θ sin^3θ + 10 - 2r²).

Thus, putting it all together, curl F is:

(3 r^5 cos³θ sin²θ) i 
+ (-3 r^5 cos²θ sin^3θ +10 -2r²) j 
+ (3 r sinθ) k.

Now, the normal vector is (2r² cosθ) i + (2r² sinθ) j + r k.

So the dot product of curl F and the normal vector is:

(3 r^5 cos³θ sin²θ)(2r² cosθ)
+ [ (-3 r^5 cos²θ sin^3θ +10 -2r²) ](2r² sinθ)
+ (3 r sinθ)(r).

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: (3 r^5 cos³θ sin²θ)(2r² cosθ) = 6 r^7 cos^4θ sin²θ.

Second term: [ (-3 r^5 cos²θ sin^3θ +10 -2r²) ] * (2r² sinθ) 

Let's expand this:

= (-3 r^5 cos²θ sin^3θ)(2r² sinθ
