Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = sqrt(36x² +7) divided by (9x +4). And then, from the options given, select possible values of g(2023), where g(x) is that asymptote. Hmm, I remember that horizontal asymptotes are about the behavior of the function as x approaches positive or negative infinity.

Right, to find the horizontal asymptote, I should look at what happens to f(x) as x gets really big, both positively and negatively. So I guess I'll need to evaluate the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity and negative infinity.

Let me write out the function again: f(x) = sqrt(36x² + 7) / (9x +4). So let's see, as x becomes very large in magnitude, the terms with the highest power of x will dominate. So inside the square root, 36x² is way bigger than 7, so sqrt(36x² +7) is approximately sqrt(36x²) which is 6|x|. Oh wait, because square root of x squared is the absolute value of x, so sqrt(36x²) is 6|x|.

Similarly, in the denominator, 9x is much larger than 4, so denominator approximates to 9x for large |x|.

So putting those approximations together, f(x) ≈ (6|x|) / (9x). Let me simplify that. 6 divided by 9 is 2/3, so it's (2/3)*|x|/x.

Now, |x| divided by x is interesting. Because if x is positive, |x| is x, so |x|/x is 1. If x is negative, |x| is -x, so |x|/x is -1. So the sign depends on the direction of x approaching infinity.

So for x approaching positive infinity, |x|/x is 1, so f(x) approaches (2/3)*1 = 2/3. But wait, wait a second. Wait, no, because 6|x|/(9x) would be (6/9) * (|x|/x) = (2/3) * (|x|/x). So when x approaches positive infinity, |x| is x, so it's (2/3)*(x/x) = 2/3. When x approaches negative infinity, |x| is -x, so it's (2/3)*(-x/x) = (2/3)*(-1) = -2/3.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, the function f(x) is sqrt(36x² +7) over 9x +4. So when x is positive and large, the numerator is approx 6x, denominator approx 9x, so 6x/9x = 2/3. But when x is negative, say x is a large negative number, then sqrt(36x²) is 6|x|, which would be 6*(-x), because x is negative. So numerator is approx 6*(-x) because x is negative. Denominator is 9x, which is negative because x is negative. So f(x) ≈ [6*(-x)] / [9x] = (6*(-x))/(9x) = 6*(-x)/(9x) = -6/9 = -2/3.

Wait, but wait, no. Because x is negative, so let me think: suppose x approaches negative infinity. So x is a large negative number. sqrt(36x² +7) is sqrt(36x²(1 + 7/(36x²))) which approximates to 6|x|. Since x is negative, |x| is -x, so sqrt(36x² +7) ≈6*(-x) because x is negative. So numerator is approx 6*(-x). Denominator is 9x +4, but 4 is negligible, so denominator is approx 9x, which is negative because x is negative.

So putting them together: (6*(-x)) / (9x) = (6*(-x))/(9x) = (6/9)*(-x/x) = (2/3)*(-1) = -2/3. Wait, that's the same as before. So as x approaches positive infinity, f(x) approaches 2/3. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches -2/3.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, when x is negative, the denominator is 9x, which is negative. So let me plug in x as a very large negative number, say x = -N where N is a large positive number.

So f(-N) = sqrt(36*(-N)^2 +7) / (9*(-N)+4) = sqrt(36N² +7)/(-9N +4). The numerator is sqrt(36N²(1 + 7/(36N²))) ) ≈ 6N. The denominator is -9N +4, which for large N is approximately -9N.

So f(-N) ≈ (6N)/(-9N) )= 6/( -9 ) = -2/3. So yes, that's correct.

So the horizontal asymptotes are y = 2/3 and y = -2/3. Wait, but wait, is that right? Because for x approaching positive infinity, the function approaches 2/3, and for x approaching negative infinity, it approaches -2/3. So the horizontal asymptotes are both y=2/3 and y=-2/3? Or is it that the function approaches 2/3 from one side and -2/3 from the other.

Wait, no, typically a function can have different horizontal asymptotes from each direction. So yes, in this case, there are two horizontal asymptotes: y=2/3 as x approaches positive infinity, and y=-2/3 as x approaches negative infinity.

So the function g(x) is the horizontal asymptote, so g(x) would represent these two values. Wait, but the question is phrased as "g(x) is the horizontal asymptote of function f(x)", so perhaps g(x) is actually two constants, 2/3 and -2/3, but that seems a bit confusing because g(x) is usually a function, but in this context, perhaps it's referring to the horizontal asymptote values, so g(x) would represent the horizontal asymptote(s).

But the question is asking for possible values of g(2023). So 2023 is a large positive number, so as x approaches 2023, which is a large positive number, the function approaches 2/3. So g(2023) would be 2/3.

Now looking at the options, I need to find which option includes 2/3 and -2/3, but wait, the options are given as ranges between two numbers, like [a, -a]. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: [0.9999, -0.9999]
B: [1.4142, -1.4142]
C: [4.0000, -4.0000]
D: [1.2345, -1.2345]
E: [3.1415, -3.1415]
F: [0.6667, -0.6667]
G: [2.5678, -2.5678]
H: [0.1234, -0.1234]
I: [0.3333, -0.3333]
J: [2.7183, -2.7183]

Wait, in our case, the asymptotes are 2/3 and -2/3. 2/3 is approximately 0.6667, so looking at option F, which is [0.6667, -0.6667]. So the possible values would be 0.6667 and -0.6667, which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer should be option F.

To determine the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{36x^2 + 7}}{9x + 4} \), we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \) and \( x \to -\infty \). 

1. **As \( x \to \infty \):**  
   - The dominant term in the numerator is \( \sqrt{36x^2} = 6x \).  
   - The dominant term in the denominator is \( 9x \).  
   - Thus, \( f(x) \approx \frac{6x}{9x} = \frac{2}{3} \).  

2. **As \( x \to -\infty \):**  
   - The dominant term in the numerator is \( \sqrt{36x^2} = 6|x| = 6(-x) \) (since \( x \) is negative).  
   - The dominant term in the denominator is \( 9x \), which is also negative.  
   - Thus, \( f(x) \approx \frac{6(-x)}{9x} = -\frac{2}{3} \).  

Therefore, the horizontal asymptotes of \( f(x) \) are \( y = \frac{2}{3} \) as \( x \to \infty \) and \( y = -\frac{2}{3} \) as \( x \to -\infty \).  

The question asks for possible values of \( g(2023) \), where \( g(x) \) represents the horizontal asymptote. Since \( 2023 \) is a large positive number, \( g(2023) \) corresponds to the horizontal asymptote as \( x \to \infty \), which is \( \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \).  

From the given options, the range \([0.6667, -0.6667]\) in option F matches the calculated horizontal asymptotes.
