Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for a gas when its state changes. Hmm, let's try to remember what I learned in class. 

The problem says we have 3.00 moles of a perfect gas. The gas atoms have a molar heat capacity at constant pressure, Cp,m, of (5/2)R. R is the gas constant, right? So I think R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but sometimes it's approximated as 8.31 or 8.314. So (5/2)R would be about 20.785 J/mol·K.

The initial state is 25°C and 1.00 atm. The final state is 125°C and 5.00 atm. I need to find ΔS for the system. Oh wait, entropy change of the system, so that's the gas itself.

I remember that when both temperature and pressure change, the entropy change can be calculated by breaking it into two steps: one where the temperature changes at constant pressure, and another where the pressure changes at constant temperature. Or wait, maybe it's better to use the general formula for entropy change when both variables change.

Wait, the formula for entropy change when both T and P change is ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

I think for an ideal gas, the entropy change when changing from state 1 (T1, P1) to state 2 (T2, P2) is given by:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Wait, but sometimes I've seen it written with Cv instead of Cp. Or maybe it's better to use the formula derived from the combined first and second laws. Let me think. The differential of entropy is dS = (Cp / T) dT - (n R / P) dP, something like that?

Wait, no, I think the entropy change for an ideal gas can be expressed as:

ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1)

Alternatively, since PV = nRT, you can express it in terms of pressure. Oh wait, another approach is to use:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Because Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure, and we can relate the pressure change. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the correct formula.

Wait, another way: the entropy change for an ideal gas can be written as:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Yes, that's the formula I remember. Because when pressure increases, if volume decreases, that would lead to a negative contribution to entropy. So if P2 > P1, the second term would be negative, leading to a decrease in entropy.

So in this problem, T increases from 25°C to 125°C. Let's convert these to Kelvin. 25°C is 298 K, and 125°C is 398 K. So T2 is 398 K, T1 is 298 K.

Pressures are from 1 atm to 5 atm. So P2 is 5 atm, P1 is 1 atm.

n is 3.00 mol. Cp is (5/2) R. So let me plug all these into the formula.

First, compute the temperature term: n Cp ln(T2/T1).

n =3, Cp= (5/2) R, so 3*(5/2 R) * ln(398/298)

Calculate 398/298: 398 is 100 more than 298, so approximately 1.336.

So ln(1.336) is about 0.295. Let me double-check with a calculator. Hmm, ln(1.336) is approximately 0.295.

So the temperature term is 3*(5/2)*R * 0.295.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So (5/2)*8.314 is (2.5)*8.314 = approx 20.785 J/mol·K.

So 3 * 20.785 = 62.355 J/K. Multiply by 0.295: 62.355 * 0.295 ≈ 18.4 J/K.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 62.355 * 0.3 is about 18.7, but since it's 0.295, it's about 18.4.

Now the pressure term: -n R ln(P2/P1).

P2 is 5, P1 is 1, so P2/P1 is 5. So ln(5) is about 1.609.

So term is -3 * R * 1.609.

R is 8.314, so 3*8.314 =24.942.

24.942 *1.609 ≈ 40.13.

So the pressure term is -40.13 J/K.

So total ΔS is 18.4 -40.13 = -21.73 J/K.

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A:25.7, B:15.3, C:10.5, D:33.4, E:-30.7, F:-45, G:-60.2, H:-22.1, I:5.8, J:-17.9.

Hmm, our approximate calculation is about -21.7 J/K. The closest option is H: -22.1 J/K^-1, and J is -17.9. So H is the closest.

But wait, perhaps I made some rounding errors. Let me be more precise with the calculations.

First, T1 = 25 +273.15 =298.15 K. T2=125+273.15=398.15 K.

Compute T2/T1: 398.15 /298.15 ≈1.3364.

ln(1.3364)= let me compute more accurately. Let me calculate ln(1.3364):

I know that ln(1.3) is about 0.2624, ln(1.35)=0.3001. So 1.3364 is between 1.3 and 1.35.

Let me use a calculator approach: ln(1.3364) ≈0.2953.

So the temperature term is 3 * (5/2 R) * 0.2953.

(5/2 R)=2.5 *8.314=20.785 J/mol·K.

3 *20.785 =62.355.

62.355 *0.2953 ≈approx 62.355 *0.3 is 18.7065, but since it's 0.2953, it's about 18.7065 * (0.2953/0.3) → 0.9843 multiplier. So approx 18.7065 *0.9843 ≈18.43 J/K.

Now the pressure term:

ln(5) is 1.60944.

So pressure term: -3 *8.314 *1.60944.

3*8.314=24.942.

24.942 *1.60944 ≈ let's compute 24 *1.60944=38.62656, 0.942 *1.60944≈1.518. Total ≈38.62656+1.518=40.14456.

So pressure term is -40.1446 J/K.

Total ΔS=18.43 -40.1446= -21.7146 J/K, approximately -21.7 J/K.

Looking back at the options, option H is -22.1 J/K, which is very close. Other options are E (-30.7) and J (-17.9). So H must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure about the formula. I used ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Is that correct?

Another approach is to use the formula:

ΔS = n [ Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

Which is the same as what I did.

Alternatively, another formula is ΔS = n [ Cv ln(T2/T1) + R ln(V2/V1) ]

But since I don't have V, using the Cp version is better because I can express in terms of P.

Wait, let me think again: Another formula I've seen is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Yes, that's correct. Because when you express the entropy change in terms of T and P, you have:

Using the relation that for an ideal gas, entropy change is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

So yes, I think I applied the correct formula.

So the calculation leads to approximately -21.7, which is closest to option H (-22.1 J/K^-1). So the answer should be H.
</think>

To calculate the entropy change (ΔS) for the system when the state of 3.00 mol of a perfect gas is changed from 25°C and 1.00 atm to 125°C and 5.00 atm, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S = n C_{p, \mathrm{m}} \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - n R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \mathrm{K} \)
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = 125 + 273.15 = 398.15 \, \mathrm{K} \)

### Step 2: Identify constants and parameters
- Number of moles: \( n = 3.00 \, \mathrm{mol} \)
- Molar heat capacity at constant pressure: \( C_{p, \mathrm{m}} = \frac{5}{2} R \)
- Gas constant: \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K} \)
- Initial pressure: \( P_1 = 1.00 \, \mathrm{atm} \)
- Final pressure: \( P_2 = 5.00 \, \mathrm{atm} \)

### Step 3: Calculate the temperature term
\[
\text{Temperature term} = n C_{p, \mathrm{m}} \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{398.15}{298.15} \approx 1.336 \)
- \( \ln(1.336) \approx 0.295 \)
- \( C_{p, \mathrm{m}} = \frac{5}{2} R = 2.5 \cdot 8.314 = 20.785 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K} \)
- \( n C_{p, \mathrm{m}} = 3 \cdot 20.785 = 62.355 \, \mathrm{J/K} \)
- Temperature term: \( 62.355 \cdot 0.295 \approx 18.43 \, \mathrm{J/K} \)

### Step 4: Calculate the pressure term
\[
\text{Pressure term} = -n R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]
- \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{5.00}{1.00} = 5 \)
- \( \ln(5) \approx 1.609 \)
- \( n R = 3 \cdot 8.314 = 24.942 \, \mathrm{J/K} \)
- Pressure term: \( -24.942 \cdot 1.609 \approx -40.14 \, \mathrm{J/K} \)

### Step 5: Combine the terms
\[
\Delta S = \text{Temperature term} + \text{Pressure term} = 18.43 - 40.14 \approx -21.71 \, \mathrm{J/K}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of \( \Delta S \approx -21.71 \, \mathrm{J/K} \) is closest to option **H: -22.1 J/K**.

### Rationalization of the sign
The negative sign of \( \Delta S \) indicates that the entropy of the system decreases. This is because the increase in pressure (from 1.00 atm to 5.00 atm) dominates over the increase in temperature (from 25°C to 125°C), leading to a net decrease in the system's entropy.
