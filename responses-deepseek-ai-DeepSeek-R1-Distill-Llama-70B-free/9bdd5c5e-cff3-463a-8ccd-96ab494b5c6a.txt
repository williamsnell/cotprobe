Question:

A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of nonradiating low back pain for 3 days. The pain began after he worked in his yard. He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: MRI of the spine
B: Chiropractic treatment
C: X-rays of the spine
D: Lumbar puncture
E: Surgical consultation
F: Steroid injections
G: Acupuncture
H: Regular activity
I: Bed rest

Okay, so I've got this question about a 37-year-old man with low back pain. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The patient's main issue is nonradiating low back pain that started after working in his yard. So, it's probably related to physical activity, maybe muscle strain. He's had a similar episode before that resolved on its own, which suggests it's something acute and not chronic.

He doesn't have any changes in bowel or bladder function, which is good because that often points to more serious issues like cauda equina syndrome. His vital signs are normal, so no signs of infection or other systemic issues.

On exam, there's bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. That makes sense with a muscle strain. His range of motion is limited by pain, which is typical. The straight-leg raising test is negative, which is important because that test can indicate nerve root irritation, like in a herniated disc. Since it's negative, it's less likely to be a disc issue or sciatica.

So, the question is about the next step in management, besides giving him pain relief. The options are various diagnostic tests and treatments.

Option A is MRI of the spine. MRI is usually for when you suspect something more serious, like a disc herniation, infection, or tumor. But since he has no red flags and the straight-leg test is negative, maybe an MRI isn't the first step.

Option B is chiropractic treatment. Chiropractic care can help with some back issues, especially if it's musculoskeletal. But I'm not sure if it's the immediate next step after initial assessment.

Option C is X-rays. X-rays are good for checking fractures or bone issues, but in acute low back pain without red flags, guidelines often don't recommend immediate imaging. They might not show much, especially if it's a soft tissue injury.

Option D is a lumbar puncture. That's for meningitis or other CNS issues, which he doesn't have symptoms of, like fever or stiff neck. So probably not needed.

Option E is surgical consultation. Unless there's a surgical emergency, which there's no indication of here, this seems too aggressive.

Option F is steroid injections. That's more for chronic inflammation or specific conditions like severe sciatica, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Option G is acupuncture. Some people find relief with it, but it's usually considered after other treatments have failed or as an adjunct.

Option H is regular activity. I remember reading that staying active is often recommended for acute back pain, as bed rest can actually make it worse.

Option I is bed rest. Like I just thought, bed rest is generally not advised anymore for acute low back pain. It can lead to deconditioning and prolong recovery.

Putting this together, the patient has acute, mechanical low back pain, likely from muscle strain. He has no red flags, so imaging isn't immediately needed. The best next step after pain management would be to advise him to stay active. So the answer should be H: Regular activity.

The patient is a 37-year-old man with nonradiating low back pain following physical activity, likely indicating a musculoskeletal issue such as muscle strain. He has no red flags (e.g., changes in bowel/bladder function, fever, or neurological deficits) and a negative straight-leg raising test, which reduces the likelihood of nerve root irritation or herniated disc. 

Given these details, advanced imaging (MRI or X-rays) or invasive procedures (lumbar puncture, steroid injections, or surgery) are unnecessary at this stage. Bed rest is not recommended as it can worsen outcomes, and alternative therapies like chiropractic care or acupuncture are not the immediate next step. The most appropriate management is to advise the patient to maintain regular activity, as this promotes recovery and prevents deconditioning.
