Okay, so I have this matrix A and I need to find its determinant. The matrix is a 3x3 one, so I remember there's a specific method for calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let me think about how to do this.

The matrix given is:
A = [[2, 4, 3],
     [3, 3, 1],
     [42, 20, 51]]

I think the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is something like this: you take the elements of the first row and multiply them by the determinants of their respective minors, then add and subtract them appropriately. Or maybe it's using the rule of Sarrus? Wait, no, I think the rule of Sarrus is for 3x3, but I might get confused with the method.

Alternatively, the standard method is expansion by minors along the top row. So the determinant would be:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So applying this to our matrix A:

a=2, b=4, c=3
d=3, e=3, f=1
g=42, h=20, i=51

Plugging into the formula:

det(A) = 2*(3*51 - 1*20) - 4*(3*51 - 1*42) + 3*(3*20 - 3*42)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First part: 2*(3*51 -1*20)
3*51 = 153, 1*20=20. So 153-20=133. Multiply by 2: 2*133=266.

Second part: -4*(3*51 -1*42)
3*51 is 153 again, 1*42 is 42. So 153-42=111. Multiply by -4: -4*111= -444.

Third part: 3*(3*20 -3*42)
3*20 is 60, 3*42 is 126. 60-126= -66. Multiply by 3: 3*(-66)= -198.

Now add all three parts together: 266 -444 -198.

Wait, let me compute that. 266 minus 444 is -178. Then subtract 198: -178 -198 = -376.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I see option H is -376. So that's the answer.

Wait, did I compute everything correctly? Let me double-check the calculations.

First part: 3*51 is indeed 153, minus 20 is 133. 2*133=266. That's correct.

Second part: 3*51=153, 1*42=42. 153-42=111. Multiply by -4 gives -444. Correct.

Third part: 3*20=60, 3*42=126. 60-126= -66. Multiply by 3: -198. Correct.

Adding up: 266 -444 = -178. Then -178 -198. Let's see, 178 + 198 is 376. So 266 -444 -198 = 266 - (444+198) = 266 - 642 = -376. Yes.

So the determinant is -376, which is option H.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{det}(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)
\]

For the given matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 4 & 3 \\
3 & 3 & 1 \\
42 & 20 & 51
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = 4\), \(c = 3\), \(d = 3\), \(e = 3\), \(f = 1\), \(g = 42\), \(h = 20\), and \(i = 51\). Applying the formula:

1. Compute \(a(ei - fh)\):  
   \[
   2 \cdot (3 \cdot 51 - 1 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot (153 - 20) = 2 \cdot 133 = 266
   \]

2. Compute \(-b(di - fg)\):  
   \[
   -4 \cdot (3 \cdot 51 - 1 \cdot 42) = -4 \cdot (153 - 42) = -4 \cdot 111 = -444
   \]

3. Compute \(c(dh - eg)\):  
   \[
   3 \cdot (3 \cdot 20 - 3 \cdot 42) = 3 \cdot (60 - 126) = 3 \cdot (-66) = -198
   \]

Adding these results together:  
\[
266 - 444 - 198 = -376
\]

Thus, the determinant of matrix \(A\) is \(-376\), which corresponds to option **H**.
