Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our kingdoms."
Letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, 1526
Source 2:
"This expedition has cost us much: it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand—as though speaking in our name—what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory."

Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question. Let me read through the sources and the options carefully.

So, the question is about the tone of King Afonso I's letter to King John III of Portugal in 1526. The letter is complaining about Portuguese activities in Kongo. He says that his people are kidnapping others, including freedmen, nobles, and relatives, to sell to the Portuguese. He's clearly upset about this and sees it as a problem because it's not serving God well and is causing inconvenience.

Looking at Source 2, it's from King Manuel to his envoy, asking them to make sure the ships are filled, preferably with slaves, copper, or ivory. So the Portuguese are pushing for more goods, especially slaves, which is leading to the situation Afonso describes.

The question is asking what development this tone reflects. The options are from A to J.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Encouragement of European settlers. The letter doesn't mention settlers; it's about the taking of people, so probably not A.

Option B: Rising interest in European political structures. The letter is a complaint about the actions, not about adopting structures, so B might not fit.

Option C: Resistance to European conquest. The letter is more about the negative impact of trade, not direct military resistance, but maybe. I'm not sure yet.

Option D: Consolidation of states along the coast. The letter is about internal issues caused by trade, not about state formation, so maybe not D.

Option E: Introduction of European farming methods. The letter doesn't mention agriculture, so E is unlikely.

Option F: Promotion of Christianity. The letter mentions serving God, but the main issue is the kidnapping, so F might not be the focus.

Option G: Acceptance of European culture. The king seems upset, so he's not accepting, so G is not it.

Option H: Trading posts. The letter talks about trade but the problem is the kidnapping, not the establishment of posts, so H might not be the best fit.

Option I: Dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods. The king's people are desiring European goods, which is leading to the problem. So maybe this is about dependency. The letter says that the people are "keenly desirous" of European wares, which leads them to kidnap others to trade. So the tone reflects that they are increasingly dependent on this trade, which is causing internal issues.

Option J: Diplomatic alliance. The letter is a complaint, so it's not about forming an alliance but addressing a problem within an existing alliance.

So, putting it together, the tone reflects that the Kongolese are becoming dependent on trade with Europe because their desire for European goods is leading to negative consequences like kidnapping. Therefore, the correct answer would be I.

The tone of King Afonso I's letter reflects a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods, as the desire for European wares leads to internal issues such as kidnapping and exploitation.

Answer: I
