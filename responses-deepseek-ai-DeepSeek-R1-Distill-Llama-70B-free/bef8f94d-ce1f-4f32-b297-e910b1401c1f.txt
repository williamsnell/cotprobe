Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the scientific community and who discovered women's capacity for multiple orgasms. Hmm, let's think through this.

The question is asking which researcher or team originally discovered that women can have multiple orgasms. The options are A to J, with various names I recognize from different fields.

First, I'll try to recall what each of these people is known for. Let's go through the options:

A: Kaplan. I think Helen Singer Kaplan was a sex therapist known for her work on sexual desire and disorders. She might have contributed to understanding sexual response.

B: Kinsey. Alfred Kinsey was a biologist known for his work on human sexuality, specifically the Kinsey Reports in the 1940s and 50s. His research was about sexual behavior in men and women, including orgasm frequencies.

C: Masters and Johnson. They were a team known for their research on human sexual response. They did a lot of groundbreaking work in the 1960s, including laboratory studies on sexual physiology. I remember they identified the four stages of sexual response.

D: Darwin. He's the evolution guy, Origin of Species. Not related to this topic.

E: Hite. Shere Hite did the Hite Reports, focusing on female sexuality and orgasms from a more feminist perspective, I think in the 70s.

F: Spock. Probably Dr. Benjamin Spock, known for his baby and child care books. Unrelated.

G: Watson and Crick. They discovered DNA's structure. Not relevant here.

H: Freud. Sigmund Freud, the psychoanalyst. He had theories about female sexuality, like the clitoral vs vaginal orgasm, but I'm not sure he did empirical studies on multiple orgasms.

I: Skinner. B.F. Skinner was a behaviorist psychologist, known for operant conditioning. Not related.

J: Pavlov. Ivan Pavlov, known for classical conditioning with dogs. Not related.

So, the key is to figure out who first documented that women can have multiple orgasms.

I know that Masters and Johnson's work was very detailed on sexual physiology. They studied the physical responses during arousal and orgasm. They might have been the ones to scientifically demonstrate that women can have multiple orgasms without the refractory period that men typically experience.

On the other hand, Kinsey's reports were more about the frequency and diversity of sexual behaviors, including how many orgasms people have. I think he might have collected data showing that some women can have multiple orgasms, but perhaps not in the same detailed physiological way as Masters and Johnson.

Wait, but the question is about who originally discovered it. So was it Kinsey earlier, or Masters and Johnson later?

I think Kinsey's reports came before Masters and Johnson's work. So maybe Kinsey was the first to note that women can have multiple orgasms based on his surveys and interviews.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Masters and Johnson's 1966 book "Human Sexual Response" detailed the sexual response cycle, including that women can have multiple orgasms. They did laboratory observations, so they might have been the first to scientifically demonstrate it, not just report it from interviews.

Alternatively, perhaps Kinsey's work in the 1950s included data on multiple orgasms in women, which was then later studied more thoroughly by Masters and Johnson.

So the question is about the original discovery. If Kinsey's research was earlier and included this finding, then he might be the answer. But if the detailed physiological proof came from Masters and Johnson, then they might be the correct choice.

I think the correct answer is C: Masters and Johnson because they were the first to document it scientifically with their research. But wait, Kinsey's work was earlier. Let me try to remember.

Kinsey's reports were in the late 40s and 50s. He did report on the incidence of multiple orgasms in women based on his surveys. So perhaps he was the first to bring this to light in the scientific community.

But then again, Masters and Johnson are more associated with the detailed understanding of sexual response, including multiple orgasms. So maybe it's them.

Wait, I think I've read that Masters and Johnson's work showed that women can have multiple orgasms, which was a significant finding that went against previous assumptions. So perhaps they are the correct answer.

Alternatively, the question is about the original discovery. If earlier researchers like Kinsey had already noted it, then the answer would be B. But if the detailed study was by Masters and Johnson, then C.

I'm a bit torn here. But I think the answer is C: Masters and Johnson, because they were the ones who conducted the physiological studies that demonstrated it, even if Kinsey had reported it earlier based on self-reported data.

So I'll go with C: Masters and Johnson.

The question asks who originally discovered women's capacity for multiple orgasms in the scientific community. To determine this, it's important to evaluate the contributions of the listed researchers:

- **A: Kaplan**: Known for work on sexual desire and disorders, but not specifically for discovering multiple orgasms.  
- **B: Kinsey**: Conducted large-scale surveys on sexual behavior in the 1940s-50s, including data on orgasm frequencies. He likely noted the phenomenon of multiple orgasms in women, but his work was based on self-reported data rather than physiological studies.  
- **C: Masters and Johnson**: Conducted groundbreaking laboratory research on sexual physiology in the 1960s, detailing the sexual response cycle. They provided the first scientific, physiological evidence that women can experience multiple orgasms.  
- **D: Darwin**: Known for evolutionary theory, unrelated to this topic.  
- **E: Hite**: Focused on female sexuality in the 1970s, but her work came after Masters and Johnson.  
- **F: Spock**: Known for child-rearing advice, unrelated.  
- **G: Watson and Crick**: Discovered DNA's structure, unrelated.  
- **H: Freud**: Theorized about female sexuality but did not study multiple orgasms empirically.  
- **I: Skinner**: Behaviorist psychologist, unrelated.  
- **J: Pavlov**: Known for classical conditioning, unrelated.  

While Kinsey's earlier work included data on multiple orgasms, Masters and Johnson were the first to scientifically demonstrate and document this phenomenon through physiological research. Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Masters and Johnson**.
