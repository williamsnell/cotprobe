Okay, so I have this question about Erikson's stages of psychosocial development. Hmm, I remember that Erik Erikson was a psychologist who developed a theory that goes beyond Freud's psychosexual stages. He proposed eight stages, each with a specific conflict or crisis that needs to be resolved for healthy development.

Wait, the question is asking me to list and describe these stages. I think each stage has a particular virtue or strength that comes from successfully navigating the crisis. Let me try to recall the stages in order.

The first stage is during infancy, right? I think it's about trust vs. mistrust. Babies develop trust if their caregivers are responsive and reliable. If not, they might develop mistrust. So that's stage one.

Next, the second stage is toddlerhood, I believe. It's autonomy vs. shame and doubt. Toddlers learn to do things on their own, like using the toilet. If they're encouraged, they feel autonomous. But if they're criticized too much, they might feel ashamed or doubtful.

Stage three is during the preschool years, maybe around 3-5 years old. The conflict here is initiative vs. guilt. Children start taking on more responsibilities and may feel guilty if they're made to feel that their actions are wrong. This is when they might start showing leadership or feel anxious about it.

Then comes the fourth stage, which I think is during school age, around 6-12 years old. It's industry vs. inferiority. At this point, kids are in school and learning new skills. They feel a sense of accomplishment (industry) if they succeed, but might feel inferior if they fail or aren't encouraged.

Stage five is adolescence, around 12-18 years old. The crisis here is identity vs. role confusion. Teens explore their identities and try to find their place in the world. If they can't find a clear identity, they might feel confused about their roles in life.

Next is young adulthood, I think. Stage six is intimacy vs. isolation. Young adults seek meaningful relationships and intimacy. If they fail to form such connections, they might feel isolated or alone.

Stage seven is middle adulthood, roughly 40-65 years old. The conflict is generativity vs. stagnation. People at this stage focus on contributing to society, maybe by raising a family or pursuing meaningful work. If they don't feel productive, they might feel stagnant or unfulfilled.

Finally, stage eight is late adulthood, 65 and older. It's ego integrity vs. despair. Older adults reflect on their lives. If they feel satisfied with their accomplishments, they achieve integrity. But if they have regrets, they might feel despair.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this sequence. Option C says:

(1) trust vs. mistrust, (2) autonomy vs. shame and doubt, (3) initiative vs. guilt, (4) industry vs. inferiority, (5) identity vs. role confusion, (6) intimacy vs. isolation, (7) generativity vs. stagnation, and (8) ego integrity vs. despair.

That matches exactly what I was thinking. So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is option C, as it accurately lists and describes Erikson's eight stages of psychosocial development, each with its corresponding crisis and virtue. These stages are:

1. Trust vs. Mistrust (infancy)
2. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (toddlerhood)
3. Initiative vs. Guilt (preschool years)
4. Industry vs. Inferiority (school age)
5. Identity vs. Role Confusion (adolescence)
6. Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood)
7. Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood)
8. Ego Integrity vs. Despair (late adulthood)

Answer: C
