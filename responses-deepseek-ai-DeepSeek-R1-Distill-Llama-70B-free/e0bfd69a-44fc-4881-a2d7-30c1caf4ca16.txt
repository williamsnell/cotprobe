Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a water droplet suspended in air due to an electric field. Hmm, okay, let me think about what I need to do.

The question is asking for the magnitude of the gravitational force on the drop. Wait, but the drop is suspended in air because of an electric field. Oh right, that means the electric force is balancing the gravitational force. So the electric force must be equal in magnitude to the gravitational force but opposite in direction, keeping the drop suspended.

So, the gravitational force is what I'm looking for. Gravitational force is calculated using F_gravity = m * g, right? Where m is the mass of the drop and g is the acceleration due to gravity, about 9.8 m/s².

Wait, but I don't know the mass of the drop. The problem gives me the diameter, though. The diameter is 1.20 micrometers, which is 1.20e-6 meters. So the radius would be half of that, 0.60e-6 meters or 6.0e-7 meters.

The drop is a sphere, so its volume V is (4/3)πr³. Once I have the volume, I can find the mass using the density of water. Oh yeah, the density of water is about 1000 kg/m³.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the radius from the diameter.
2. Compute the volume of the sphere.
3. Use density to find mass (mass = density * volume).
4. Multiply mass by g to get the gravitational force.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since the electric force is equal to the gravitational force, maybe I can calculate the electric force and that will be equal to mg. Let me think. The electric force F_electric is qE, where q is the charge and E is the electric field.

But the problem doesn't give me the charge; it's giving me E. Hmm. Oh wait, but in the problem statement, perhaps the electric force is what's balancing gravity. So if F_electric = F_gravity, then qE = mg. But without knowing q, that might not help me directly. Unless I can find q another way, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait no, the question is just asking for the gravitational force. So it's easier to compute it directly from the mass.

So let's proceed with calculating the volume and then the mass.

First, radius r = diameter / 2 = (1.20e-6 m) / 2 = 0.60e-6 m = 6.0e-7 m.

Volume V = (4/3)πr³.

Let me compute r³: (6.0e-7 m)^3 = 216e-21 m³ = 2.16e-19 m³.

Multiply by 4/3 π: (4/3)*π*(2.16e-19) = Let's compute that.

4/3 is approximately 1.3333. π is about 3.1416. So 1.3333 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.1888.

Then 4.1888 * 2.16e-19 = Let's calculate 4 * 2.16 is 8.64, 0.1888 *2.16 ≈ 0.407. So total is around 9.047e-19 m³.

Alternatively, exact calculation:

(4/3) * π * (6e-7)^3

= (4/3) * π * (216e-21)
= (4 * 216 /3) * π * 1e-21
= (864/3) * π * 1e-21
= 288 * π * 1e-21
≈ 288 * 3.1416 ≈ 904.7 * 1e-21 = 9.047e-19 m³.

So V ≈ 9.047e-19 m³.

Now, density ρ = 1000 kg/m³.

Mass m = ρ * V = 1000 kg/m³ * 9.047e-19 m³ = 9.047e-16 kg.

Wait no, 1e3 * 9.047e-19 = 9.047e-16 kg.

Wait, wait! Wait, 1e3 is 10^3, and 9.047e-19 is 9.047 * 10^-19. So 1e3 * 9.047e-19 = 9.047e-16 kg. Correct.

So mass is approximately 9.047e-16 kg.

Now, gravitational force F = m * g = 9.047e-16 kg * 9.8 m/s².

Let me compute that. 9.047e-16 * 9.8 = 

9.047 *9.8 ≈ let's see: 9 *9.8 is 88.2, 0.047 *9.8 ≈ 0.4606. So total ≈ 88.2 + 0.4606 = 88.6606. So 88.66e-16 N. Wait, because 9.047e-16 times 9.8 is 9.047*9.8= about 88.66, so 88.66e-16 N.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 9.047 *9.8.

9 *9.8 is 88.2.

0.047 *9.8: 0.04 *9.8 = 0.392; 0.007 *9.8=0.0686. So 0.392 +0.0686=0.4606.

So total 88.2 +0.4606=88.6606. So 88.6606e-16 N.

But that's 8.86606e-15 N, because 88.66e-16 is 8.866e-15.

Wait, 88.66e-16 is the same as 8.866e-15.

So F_gravity ≈ 8.866e-15 N.

Looking at the options, option I is 8.87e-15 N, which is very close.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Let me recompute the volume.

r = 0.60e-6 m = 6e-7 m.

r^3 = (6e-7)^3 = 6^3=216, so 216e-21 m³.

(4/3) π r^3 = (4/3) * π * 216e-21 = (4 * 216) /3 = (864/3) = 288. So 288 * π * 1e-21.

288 * π = approx 904.778684 (since 288 *3=864, 288*0.1416≈40.8, so 904.8).

So 904.8e-21 m³ = 9.048e-19 m³.

Density is 1e3 kg/m³, so mass is 1e3 * 9.048e-19 = 9.048e-16 kg.

Then F = m g = 9.048e-16 kg * 9.8 m/s².

Compute 9.048 *9.8.

9 *9.8= 88.2.

0.048 *9.8= 0.4704.

Total is 88.2 +0.4704=88.6704.

So 88.6704e-16 N = 8.86704e-15 N.

Which is approximately 8.87e-15 N. So option I is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

Options:

A: 1.00e-14 N.

Wait, no, the options are in the range of 1e-15.

Option I is 8.87e-15 N, which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer is I.

To determine the gravitational force on the spherical water drop, we start by calculating its mass. The diameter of the drop is given as \(1.20 \ \mu \mathrm{m} = 1.20 \times 10^{-6} \ \mathrm{m}\), so the radius is:

\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{1.20 \times 10^{-6}}{2} = 6.00 \times 10^{-7} \ \mathrm{m}.
\]

The volume of the spherical drop is calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\):

\[
r^3 = (6.00 \times 10^{-7})^3 = 216 \times 10^{-21} = 2.16 \times 10^{-19} \ \mathrm{m}^3,
\]
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (2.16 \times 10^{-19}) = \frac{4}{3} \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 2.16 \times 10^{-19} \approx 9.047 \times 10^{-19} \ \mathrm{m}^3.
\]

The density of water is \(1000 \ \mathrm{kg/m^3}\), so the mass of the drop is:

\[
m = \text{density} \cdot \text{volume} = 1000 \cdot 9.047 \times 10^{-19} = 9.047 \times 10^{-16} \ \mathrm{kg}.
\]

The gravitational force is then calculated as:

\[
F_{\text{gravity}} = m \cdot g,
\]
where \(g = 9.8 \ \mathrm{m/s^2}\). Substituting the mass:

\[
F_{\text{gravity}} = 9.047 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 9.8 \approx 8.87 \times 10^{-15} \ \mathrm{N}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**I: \(8.87 \times 10^{-15} \ \mathrm{N}\).**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I**
