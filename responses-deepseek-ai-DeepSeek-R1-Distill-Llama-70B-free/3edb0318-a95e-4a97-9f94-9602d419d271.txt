Okay, so I've got this problem here about airflow, and I need to find the Mach number. Hmm, I remember that the Mach number is the ratio of the flow velocity to the speed of sound in the fluid. Right, Mach number (M) = V / a, where V is the velocity and a is the speed of sound.

Wait, the given values are for air. Air has a specific heat ratio, k, which is 1.4 here. The molecular weight (M_W) is 29. Oh, and the velocity is 224 feet per second. The pressure is 14.7 psia, which I think is standard atmospheric pressure. The temperature is 17 degrees Celsius. Oh wait, I need to convert that to an absolute temperature, probably in Kelvin or Rankine because the speed of sound depends on that.

So first, let's convert the temperature. 17°C to Kelvin is 17 + 273.15 = 290.15 K. Alternatively, in Rankine, which is Fahrenheit plus 459.67. But since I'm working in feet and slugs (English units), maybe Rankine is more appropriate because some formulas use it. Let me think, the speed of sound formula in air is usually given by a = sqrt(k * R * T), where R is the specific gas constant for air.

Wait, R for air. The universal gas constant is R_univ = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Oh wait, but the specific gas constant R for air is R_univ divided by the molecular weight. So R = R_univ / M_W.

Let me calculate that. R_univ is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). M_W is 29 lbmol/lbmole. So R = 10.7316 / 29 = let's compute that. 10.7316 divided by 29. 29 into 10.7 is about 0.369. Let me compute it more accurately. 29 * 0.369 is 10.68, which is close. So R ≈ 0.369 psi·ft³/(lb·R).

Wait, maybe I should double-check the units. Because I'm working in feet, pounds, and seconds. So the speed of sound in air is a = sqrt( k * R * T ), where R is in (ft·lbf)/(lb·R). Hmm, because the units should work out. Let me think: psi is lbf per square inch, so to get ft·lbf per lb·R, I need to convert psi to lbf/ft². Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is a = 20.05 * sqrt(T) when T is in Kelvin. Wait, is that right? Because for air at sea level, the speed of sound is about 331 m/s at 0°C, which is 20.05 * sqrt(273). Because sqrt(273) is approx 16.52, 20.05*16.52 is around 331. So that formula might be a shortcut.

But since my temperature is 17°C, which is 290 K, using that formula would give a = 20.05 * sqrt(290). Let me compute that. sqrt(290) is about 17.02. So 20.05 *17.02 ≈ let's see, 20*17 is 340, and 0.05*17 is 0.85, so 340.85 m/s? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the units would be in m/s, but my velocity is in feet per second. I need the speed of sound in ft/s to match the units.

Wait, maybe I should stick with the first method. Let me get back to calculating R properly.

The universal gas constant R_univ is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). So R (specific) is R_univ / M_W. So 10.7316 /29 = approximately 0.3697 psi·ft³/(lb·R). Wait, no, because M_W is 29 lbm per lbmol. So the specific gas constant R is R_univ / M_W.

But wait, what are the units here? R_univ is in psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), and M_W is in lbm/lbmol. So R would be (psi·ft³/(lbmol·R)) / (lbm/lbmol) )= psi·ft³/(lbm·R). Because lbmol cancels.

Now, to get a in ft/s, let's think about the units. The formula a = sqrt(k*R*T) would require that R has units of (ft²/(s²·R)), because inside the sqrt, you have (unitless) * (something) * R, which should give ft²/s².

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way to compute a.

Alternatively, I can compute the speed of sound using the formula a = sqrt( γ * R * T ), but I need R in consistent units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the temperature in Rankine. Since I'm working in English units, R in ft·lbf/(lb·R) would make sense.

Wait, R_univ is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Let me convert this to ft·lbf/(lb·R). Because 1 psi is 1 lbf/in², and 1 ft is 12 inches. So 1 psi = 1 lbf/in² = (1 lbf) / (1/144 ft²) ) = 144 lbf/ft².

So 1 psi·ft³ is 144 lbf/ft² * ft³ = 144 lbf·ft.

So R_univ in terms of ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 144 (lbf·ft)/(psi·ft³) )= 10.7316 * 144 = approx 1546.66 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R).

Then R specific is R_univ / M_W. So 1546.66 / 29 ≈ 53.33 ft·lbf/(lb·R).

Wait, but wait: R has units of ft·lbf/(lb·R). Because the specific gas constant is in ft·lbf per lb per Rankine.

Wait, but the formula for a is sqrt( γ * R * T ), where R is in ft·lbf/(lb·R), and T is in Rankine.

So let me plug in the numbers. γ is 1.4. R is 53.33 ft·lbf/(lb·R). T is 17°C, which is 273.15 +17 = 290.15 K, which is 290.15 * 9/5 + 491.67 (since K to R is K * 9/5). Wait, no, Rankine is Kelvin + 459.67? No, wait, 0 K is absolute zero, which is -459.67 F, so 0 C is 32 F. So to convert Kelvin to Rankine, it's Kelvin * 9/5. So 290.15 K * 9/5 = 522.27 R.

Wait, let me recalculate that: 17°C is 62.6°F. To get Rankine, add 459.67: 62.6 +459.67 = 522.27 R.

So T = 522.27 R.

Now, a = sqrt( γ * R * T ) = sqrt( 1.4 * 53.33 * 522.27 )

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1.4 * 53.33 = approx 74.662.

Then 74.662 * 522.27 ≈ Let's see, 70 * 500 =35,000, 4.662 *522 ≈2442, so total is about 35,000 +2442= 37,442. Then sqrt(37,442) ≈ 193.6 ft/s.

Wait, wait, but I think I made a mistake in calculating 1.4 *53.33. Let me recalculate. 53.33 *1.4: 53 *1.4 is 74.2, 0.33*1.4 is 0.462, so total is 74.662.

Then 74.662 *522.27 = let's compute that more accurately. 74.662 * 500 =37,331. 74.662 *22.27= approx 74.662 *20=1,493.24, 74.662 *2.27=approx 74.662*2=149.324, 74.662*0.27≈20.18. So total 149.324 +20.18= 169.504. So adding 1,493.24 +169.504 = 1,662.744. So total is 37,331 +1,662.744= 38,993.744.

So sqrt(38,993.744) = approx? Let's see, 200^2 is 40,000. So it's a bit less than 200. Let's compute 197^2= 38,809. 198^2=39,204. So 38,993 is between 197 and 198. Let me compute 197.5^2 = (200 -2.5)^2= 200^2 -2*200*2.5 +2.5^2=40,000 -1000 +6.25=39,006.25. Hmm, our value is 38,993.744, which is less than 39,006.25. So it's 197.5 - (39,006.25 -38,993.744)/ (2*197.5)

The difference is 39,006.25-38,993.744=12.506. So delta is 12.506 / (2*197.5)=12.506 /395≈0.03167. So sqrt ≈197.5 -0.03167≈197.468 ft/s.

So a≈197.468 ft/s.

Wait, but that seems a bit low. Because at 0°C (273 K), the speed of sound in air is about 331 m/s, which is about 1086 ft/s. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in unit conversion?

Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation of R. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier steps: R_univ is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). To convert to ft·lbf/(lb·R), I need to convert psi·ft³ to ft·lbf.

Because 1 psi is 1 lbf/in². So 1 psi·ft³ = (1 lbf/in²) * (1 ft³) = 1 lbf * ft³ / in².

But 1 ft is 12 inches, so 1 ft² = 144 in². Therefore, 1 psi·ft³ = 1 lbf * ft³ / (1/144 ft²) ) = 144 lbf·ft.

So R_univ in ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 144 ft·lbf/(psi·ft³) ) = 10.7316 *144= approx 1546.66 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R).

Then R specific is R_univ / M_W = 1546.66 /29 ≈53.33 ft·lbf/(lb·R).

Wait, but that leads to a being about 197 ft/s, which is way too low. Because I know the speed of sound in air at 17°C is around 343 m/s, which is about 1128 ft/s. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, I must have messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me try a different approach. Maybe using the formula a = 20.05 * sqrt(T), where T is in Kelvin. Wait, does that formula work?

Wait, 20.05 m/s per sqrt(K). So for T=273 K, a=20.05*sqrt(273)=20.05*16.52≈331 m/s, which is correct. So for T=290 K, a=20.05*sqrt(290)=20.05*17.02≈341.2 m/s. To convert that to ft/s, 1 m/s is about 3.28084 ft/s. So 341.2 *3.28084 ≈ let's calculate:

340 *3.28084 = 1115.48, 1.2 *3.28084≈3.937, so total ≈1119.417 ft/s.

Wait, that makes more sense. So a≈1120 ft/s.

Wait, but earlier method gave me 197 ft/s, which is way off. So I must have messed up the R calculation.

Let me think again. Maybe I should use a different approach. The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by a = sqrt( γ * R * T ), where R is the specific gas constant.

But perhaps I should use R in different units. Let me check another source. Oh wait, R for air is approximately 1716 ft·lbf/(lb·R). Wait, that's a different value. Where did I get 53.33 from? Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, I think the correct specific gas constant R for air is 1716 ft·lbf/(lb·R). Let me confirm that. Because I've read that elsewhere. So R is 1716 ft·lbf/(lb·R), and k=1.4, T is 522.27 R.

So a = sqrt(1.4 *1716 *522.27 )

Calculate 1.4 *1716 = 2402.4.

Then 2402.4 *522.27 = let's compute that. 2402.4 *500=1,201,200. 2402.4 *22.27= let me compute 2402.4 *20=48,048, 2402.4 *2.27= approx 5,454. So total 48,048 +5,454=53,502. So total is 1,201,200 +53,502=1,254,702.

Then sqrt(1,254,702) is about 1,120.5 ft/s, which aligns with the earlier value.

Wait, so I must have miscalculated R earlier. Because the correct R is 1716, not 53.33. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, I think I see. Earlier, I converted R_univ (10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R)) into ft·lbf/(lb·R), but perhaps I forgot to account for molecular weight correctly.

Wait, R_univ is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). To get R specific, which is R_univ / M_W. So 10.7316 /29 = approx 0.3697 psi·ft³/(lb·R). But wait, that's not the same as ft·lbf/(lb·R). So to get R in ft·lbf/(lb·R), I need to convert the units.

So, 1 psi·ft³ is 1 lbf/in² * ft³. Since 1 ft =12 in, 1 ft³ = 12^3 in³ = 1728 in³. So 1 psi·ft³ = (1 lbf/in²) * (1728 in³) )= 1728 lbf·in. But wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, I think I should have converted psi to lbf/ft², then multiplied by ft³ to get ft·lbf.

So 1 psi = 1 lbf / in². 1 ft² =144 in², so 1 psi =1 lbf / (1/144 ft²) )= 144 lbf/ft².

So 1 psi·ft³ =144 lbf/ft² * ft³ =144 lbf·ft.

So R_univ in ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) is 10.7316 *144 = 1546.66 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R).

Then R specific is R_univ / M_W =1546.66 /29 ≈53.33 ft·lbf/(lb·R).

Wait, but this gives R as 53.33, but I thought the correct R is 1716. So perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing lbmol with lb.

Wait, perhaps the correct R is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lb·R). So using that, a= sqrt(1.4 *53.35 *522.27).

So 1.4 *53.35 =74.69. 74.69 *522.27 = about 38,995. So sqrt(38,995)= approx 197.47 ft/s. But that's way too low.

But earlier, using the shortcut method, I got 1120 ft/s, which is correct. So my mistake must be in the calculation of R. I think the correct R is 1716 ft·lbf/(lb·R). So perhaps I should just use that instead.

Alternatively, maybe I should rely on the shortcut formula, which seems to give the correct answer.

So, using a = 20.05 * sqrt(T in K). So T=290 K, a=20.05 *17.02≈341 m/s, which is 1120 ft/s.

So the speed of sound a is about 1120 ft/s.

The flow velocity V is given as 224 ft/s. So Mach number M = V /a =224/1120 =0.2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 0.2.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 224 divided by 1120 is 0.2 exactly. So M=0.2.

So the correct answer should be F:0.2.
</think>

To determine the Mach number of the airflow, we use the formula:

\[
M = \frac{V}{a}
\]

where \( V \) is the flow velocity and \( a \) is the speed of sound in air. The given values are:

- \( V = 224 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- \( k = 1.4 \) (specific heat ratio for air)
- \( M_W = 29 \, \text{lbmol/lbmol} \) (molecular weight of air)
- \( T =
