Okay, so I have this problem where Mr. Golden bought three bonds from Suttonsmith Corporation. Each bond has a maturity value of $1,000. For each bond, he gets $15 semiannually for 20 years, and then the full $1,000 at the end. The interest rates on the bonds are 3%, 4%, and 3.6%. I need to find out how much he paid for each bond. 

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on bond pricing, but I remember that the price of a bond is the present value of its future cash flows. So I need to calculate the present value of the semiannual payments and the present value of the face value, then add them together.

Wait, each bond makes semiannual payments. So for each bond, there are two payments a year, right? So for 20 years, that's 40 periods. Each payment is $15. Oh, but wait, the question says he'll receive $15 semiannually, so that's $15 every six months for 20 years.

So each bond's total payments are 40 times $15. But I can't just sum them; I need to discount each payment back to the present value. The discount rate is the bond's interest rate, but since payments are semiannual, I think I should use half the annual rate as the discount rate for each period.

Wait, no, wait. The interest rate given is annual, nominal. So for example, the 3% bond: the semiannual rate would be 3%/2 = 1.5% per period. Because each payment is every six months, so each period is half a year.

So for each bond, the present value (PV) will be the sum of the present value of the coupon payments plus the present value of the face value.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is: PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where PMT is the payment per period, r is the periodic interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

And for the face value, it's a single sum, so its PV is FV / (1 + r)^n.

So let's break this down for each bond.

First, let's handle the 3% bond.

Bond 1: 3% annual interest, so semiannual rate is 1.5% (0.015). The coupon is $15 each period. Number of periods is 20 years * 2 = 40.

So the PV of the coupons is 15 * [(1 - (1.015)^-40)/0.015].

And the PV of the face value is 1000 / (1.015)^40.

I need to compute these values.

Wait, but I don't have a calculator here. Maybe I can remember some present value factors or look up the present value interest factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each part step by step.

Wait, but maybe I can think about the bond's price in terms of whether it's selling at a discount, premium, or par.

Wait, the coupon rate is 1.5% semiannual. So the coupon rate per period is 15. But compared to the bond's yield, which is also 1.5% per period in this case.

Wait, when the coupon rate equals the yield, the bond sells at par. So if the coupon rate equals the required return, the bond's price is equal to its face value. But wait, no, I think that's only true for bonds with annual payments. Because in this case, the coupon is $15, which is 1.5% of $1000, and the yield is 1.5% per period. So each coupon payment is exactly the required return. So the present value of the coupons plus the present value of the face should add up to $1000. So the bond would be selling at par, which is $1000.

Wait, so for the 3% bond, the price is $1000. Because the coupon rate (1.5% semiannual, 3% annually) equals the yield rate (3% annual), so the bond is selling at face value.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think again: each period, the bond pays $15. The required return per period is 1.5%. So the present value of each $15 is 15/(1.015)^n for n=1 to 40. The sum of these is an annuity, and the present value of an annuity with payments equal to the interest would just be the initial principal. So the present value of the coupons is $1000*(1.5%)*something? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the present value of an ordinary annuity is PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r. So the coupon is 15, r is 0.015, n is 40.

So PV_coupons = 15 * [1 - (1.015)^-40 ] / 0.015.

And PV_face = 1000 / (1.015)^40.

So the total price is PV_coupons + PV_face.

But if the coupon rate equals the yield, then the price should equal the face value. Because the cash flows exactly match the required return, so the bond is priced at par.

Wait, that makes sense. So the 3% bond would be priced at $1000.

Wait, but let me check with numbers. Let's compute the present value of the coupons. 

The present value of an annuity formula: PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Plugging in the numbers: 15 * [ (1 - (1.015)^-40 ) / 0.015 ]

I think (1.015)^40 is about e^(0.015*40) = e^0.6 ≈ 1.822. So 1/(1.015)^40 ≈ 0.547. So 1 - 0.547 = 0.453.

So 0.453 / 0.015 = approx 30.2.

So 15 * 30.2 = 453.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the face value's present value would be 1000 * 0.547 ≈ 547. So 453 + 547 is 1000 exactly. Oh, right! So when coupon rate equals the yield, the sum of the present value of coupons and face value is exactly the face value. So the price is $1000.

So for the 3% bond, price is $1000.04? Wait, no, in the options, I see that some have $1000.04 like option C and H. But why .04? Oh, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives a value very close to $1000, maybe $1000.04 due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (1.015)^40.

Using the formula, 1.015^40.

I can compute it step by step, but perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or other approximations, but maybe better to find an approximate value.

Wait, 1.015^40 is equal to e^(40 * ln(1.015)).

ln(1.015) ≈ 0.0148 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + ... for small x). So 40 * 0.0148 = 0.592.

e^0.592 ≈ 1.807. So 1/(1.015)^40 ≈ 0.553.

So for the present value of the face: 1000 * 0.553 ≈ 553.

For the coupons: 15 * [1 - 0.553 ] / 0.015 → 15 * (0.447 / 0.015 ) → 15 * 29.8 → 447.

Adding 447 + 553 = 1000. So the bond is priced at $1000.

But looking at the options, I see that some have $1000.04 for the 3% bond. Maybe because the actual calculation is precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3% is the annual coupon rate, so the coupon would be 30 annually, but wait no, the coupon is $15 semiannually. So that's 30 annually, which is 3% of 1000.

Wait, no, 3% annually would be $30 per year. So 15 semiannually is correct.

So the correct price for the 3% bond is $1000.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E says $1000 for the 3% bond, option H says $1000.04, etc.

Now, let's move to the 4% bond. For this bond, the yield is higher than the coupon rate.

Wait, the coupon is 3% annually (15 semiannually), and the yield is 4% annually, so 2% semiannual.

Wait, wait, no. The yield is 4% annually, so the semiannual rate is 2% (0.02).

So the coupon payment is 15 each period, which is 3% annual, or 1.5% semiannual.

Since the yield is 2% per period, which is higher than the coupon rate of 1.5%, the bond will sell at a discount.

So the price will be less than $1000.

To find the price, we calculate the present value of the coupons and the face value.

PV_coupons = 15 * [1 - (1.02)^-40 ] / 0.02

PV_face = 1000 / (1.02)^40

Let me compute these.

First, (1.02)^40. Let me compute that.

I know that (1.02)^40 is approximately e^(0.02*40) = e^0.8 ≈ 2.2255. So 1/(1.02)^40 ≈ 0.4564.

So PV_face ≈ 1000 * 0.4564 ≈ 456.4.

Now, the present value of the coupons:

[1 - (1.02)^-40 ] ≈ 1 - 0.4564 = 0.5436.

Divide by 0.02: 0.5436 / 0.02 = 27.18.

Multiply by 15: 15 * 27.18 = 407.7.

So total PV = 456.4 + 407.7 = 864.1.

So approximately $864.10. Looking at the options, for the 4% bond, the price is around $860 or $863.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.02)^40 exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps use the present value of annuity formula more precisely.

Wait, but without exact calculation, maybe I can see which option has a 4% bond price around 860-865.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 3%: $1000, 4%: $860.23, 3.6%: $910.26.

Option C: 3%: $1000.04, 4%: $860.23, 3.6%: $910.26.

Option H: 3%: $1000.04, 4%: $865.23, 3.6%: $915.26.

Option J: 3%: $1000.04, 4%: $863.23, 3.6%: $920.26.

Hmm. So for the 4% bond, the price is around 860-865. So perhaps the correct value is around 863.

Wait, but let me try to calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute (1.02)^40.

I can compute it step by step.

Compute 1.02^40:

1.02^10 is approx 1.2190.

1.02^20 = (1.2190)^2 ≈ 1.48896.

1.02^40 = (1.48896)^2 ≈ 2.217.

Wait, 1.48896 squared is 1.48896 * 1.48896.

Let me calculate that:

1.48896 * 1.48896:

1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96.

0.08896 * 1.48896 ≈ 0.1325.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1.48896^2:

1.48896 * 1.48896 = ?

Let me compute 1.48896 * 1.48896:

1.48^2 = 2.1904.

But wait, perhaps using (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

Let a = 1.48, b=0.08896.

So (1.48 + 0.08896)^2 = (1.48)^2 + 2*(1.48)*(0.08896) + (0.08896)^2.

1.48^2 = 2.1904.

2*(1.48)*(0.08896) = 2.96 * 0.08896 ≈ 0.2633.

(0.08896)^2 ≈ 0.007915.

So total ≈ 2.1904 + 0.2633 + 0.007915 ≈ 2.4616.

So (1.02)^40 ≈ 2.4616, so 1/(1.02)^40 ≈ 0.4071.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because earlier approximation suggested about 0.456. Hmm, perhaps my step-by-step method isn't accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms.

ln(1.02) = approx 0.0198026.

Multiply by 40: 0.0198026 *40 = 0.7921.

e^0.7921 ≈ 2.207.

So 1/(1.02)^40 ≈ 1/2.207 ≈ 0.4533.

So PV_face = 1000 * 0.4533 ≈ 453.30.

Now, the present value of coupons.

So [1 - (1.02)^-40 ] / 0.02 = (1 - 0.4533)/0.02 = 0.5467 /0.02 = 27.335.

Multiply by 15: 15 * 27.335 ≈ 410.03.

So total PV = 453.3 + 410.03 ≈ 863.33.

So approximately $863.33. Looking at the options, option J has $863.23 for the 4% bond, but option H has $865.23. So which is closer?

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps using a better approximation for (1.02)^40.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value interest factor for annuity.

The formula for the present value annuity factor is (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r.

For r=0.02, n=40.

So let me compute (1.02)^40 more accurately.

I can use the formula:

(1.02)^40 = e^(40 * ln(1.02)).

ln(1.02) ≈ 0.0198026.

40 * 0.0198026 = 0.792106.

e^0.792106 ≈ 2.2071 (since e^0.7 ≈ 2.0138, e^0.79 ≈ 2.203, e^0.7921 ≈ 2.207).

So (1.02)^40 ≈ 2.2071, so 1/(1.02)^40 ≈ 0.4523.

So PV_face = 1000 * 0.4523 = 452.3.

Now the annuity factor:

(1 - 0.4523)/0.02 = 0.5477 /0.02 = 27.385.

Multiply by 15: 15 *27.385 = 410.775.

Adding to the face value PV: 452.3 + 410.775 = 863.075.

So approximately $863.08. So the closest option is option J, which has 4% at $863.23. Alternatively, perhaps due to more precise calculations, it could be around there.

Now, the third bond has a 3.6% annual yield. So the semiannual rate is 1.8% (0.018).

Again, the coupon is 15 semiannually, so 30 annually, which is 3% of 1000.

So the coupon rate is 3% annually, and the bond's yield is 3.6% annually. Since 3% < 3.6%, the bond sells at a discount.

So the price will be less than $1000, but more than the 4% case because 3.6% is closer to 3% than 4% is.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3% is the coupon rate. The bond's yield is 3.6%, which is higher than the coupon rate. So the bond is selling at a discount, same as the 4% bond. But the discount will be less than the 4% bond's discount because the yield is closer to the coupon rate.

So let's compute the price for the 3.6% bond.

Semiannual rate is 1.8% (0.018). Number of periods is 40.

PV_coupons = 15 * [1 - (1.018)^-40 ] / 0.018.

PV_face = 1000 / (1.018)^40.

Let's compute (1.018)^40.

Again, using the exponential approximation:

ln(1.018) ≈ 0.01783.

40 * 0.01783 ≈ 0.7132.

e^0.7132 ≈ 2.0395.

So 1/(1.018)^40 ≈ 0.4913.

PV_face = 1000 * 0.4913 ≈ 491.3.

Now the annuity factor:

[1 - 0.4913 ] / 0.018 = 0.5087 /0.018 ≈ 28.26.

Multiply by 15: 15 *28.26 ≈ 423.9.

So total PV = 491.3 + 423.9 ≈ 915.2.

So approximately $915.20.

Looking at the options, for 3.6% bond:

Option E has $910.26.

Option C has $910.26.

Option H has $915.26.

Option J has $920.26.

So my approximation gives around 915.20, so the closest is option H's $915.26.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Compute (1.018)^40.

Using the same method:

ln(1.018) = 0.01783.

40 *
