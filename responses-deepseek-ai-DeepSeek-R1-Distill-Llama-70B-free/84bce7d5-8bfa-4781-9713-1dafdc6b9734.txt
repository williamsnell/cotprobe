Question:

The owner of a parcel of land received the following letter from a buyer: "I will pay you $2,200 an acre for [theparcel]." The owner's letter of reply stated, "I accept your offer." Unknown to the owner, the buyer had intendedto offer only $2,000 per acre but had mistakenly typed "$2,200." As both parties knew, comparable land in thevicinity had been selling at prices between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre. Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between theparties?

Options:

A: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,400 per acre, as it is the highest price in the vicinity.
B: There is a contract, but the price per acre will be determined by a third-party appraiser.
C: There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.
D: There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake asto a basic assumption.
E: There is no contract, because the buyer can argue that the price was a typo.
F: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, but the buyer can renegotiate the price.
G: There is no contract, because the parties have not met in person to discuss the deal.
H: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as it is the lowest price in the vicinity.
I: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended.
J: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The situation is that a landowner received a letter from a buyer offering $2,200 per acre. The owner replied, accepting the offer. But here's the twist: the buyer actually intended to offer $2,000 per acre but made a typo. Both parties know that nearby land is selling between $2,000 and $2,400. So, the question is about the legal consequences of this exchange.

Hmm, I remember that for a contract to be valid, there needs to be a meeting of the minds, also known as mutual assent. Both parties must agree on the terms. So if one party makes a mistake in their offer, does that affect the contract?

Wait, the buyer made a mistake in the offer. They meant $2,000 but wrote $2,200. The owner accepted without knowing about the mistake. So in contract law, if an offer is made with a mistake, and the offeree accepts without knowing, is there a binding contract?

I think about the case where an offer is based on a mistake. If the mistake is so significant that it relates to a basic assumption of the contract, and the other party knows about it, maybe the contract can be rescinded. But in this case, the owner didn't know about the typo. They just saw $2,200, which is within the range of comparable sales ($2,000 to $2,400). So it's a plausible price, just higher than what the buyer intended.

So the key issue here is whether the buyer's mistake in the offer can void the contract. I think about unilateral mistake versus mutual mistake. A unilateral mistake is when only one party is mistaken. If the other party knows or has reason to know of the mistake, the contract might not be enforceable. But if the offeree doesn't know, then the contract stands as is.

In this scenario, the buyer made a unilateral mistake. The owner didn't know about it and accepted the offer. The offer was $2,200, which is within the market range, so the owner had no reason to suspect a typo. Therefore, the buyer is bound by the terms of the offer unless there's some other doctrine that applies.

Wait, another thought: is there a mutual mistake? But both parties don't share the same mistake here. The buyer intended $2,000, but the owner thought it was $2,200. So it's a unilateral mistake.

Under the common law, a unilateral mistake doesn't typically make a contract voidable unless the mistake relates to a fundamental aspect of the agreement and the non-mistaken party knew or had reason to know of the mistake. Here, the owner didn't know, so the mistake wouldn't invalidate the contract.

So the contract should be formed at $2,200 per acre because the buyer's offer was clear, and the owner accepted it without any issue. The fact that the buyer made a typo doesn't affect the validity since the owner had no knowledge of it and the price was within the expected range.

Looking at the options:

Option J says there's a contract at $2,200 regardless of the buyer's intention. That seems right because the offer was $2,200, and the owner accepted it. The buyer's intent is what they meant, but the offer was clear on its face.

Option C suggests no contract because the parties had different meanings. But in contract law, it's the objective standard that matters. The owner's acceptance was based on what was written, not what the buyer intended. So C is incorrect.

Option E says no contract because the buyer can argue it's a typo. But without the owner knowing, that argument doesn't hold.

So the correct answer should be J.

The scenario involves a buyer offering $2,200 per acre for land due to a typo, with the buyer intending to offer $2,000. The owner accepted the offer without knowing about the mistake. For a contract to be valid, there must be mutual assent, but this is determined by an objective standardâ€”the terms as expressed, not the parties' subjective intentions. 

Here, the buyer's offer was clearly stated at $2,200, which is within the market range of $2,000 to $2,400. The owner accepted the offer without any indication of suspicion or knowledge of the typo. Under contract law, a unilateral mistake (where only one party is mistaken) does not invalidate a contract unless the non-mistaken party knew or had reason to know of the mistake. In this case, the owner had no reason to suspect the typo, so the contract is enforceable at the stated price of $2,200 per acre.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option J** is correct because the contract is formed at $2,200 per acre, as the buyer's offer was clear, and the owner accepted it without knowledge of the mistake.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the objective standard applies; the owner's acceptance was based on the written offer, not the buyer's intent.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the buyer cannot void the contract based on a typo when the owner had no knowledge of it.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.**
