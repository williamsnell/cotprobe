Question:

What is the elasticity of demand?

Options:

A: Elasticity of demand is the ratio of income change to the change in quantity demanded
B: Elasticity of demand is the total revenue divided by the change in quantity of a good sold
C: Elasticity of demand is the measure of the speed at which goods are produced in response to market demands
D: Elasticity of demand is the change in quantity demanded in response to changes in market conditions other than price
E: Elasticity of demand is the change in quantity supplied due to a change in consumer preferences
F: Elasticity of demand is a measure of the extent to which quantity of a good demanded responds to changes in the price of the good
G: Elasticity of demand is the ratio of price to quantity demanded
H: Elasticity of demand is the percentage change in price
I: Elasticity of demand is the change in quantity demanded
J: Elasticity of demand is the change in the price of one good in response to a change in the price of another good

Okay, so I've got this question about elasticity of demand, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on economics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that elasticity in economics usually refers to how responsive one variable is to a change in another. So, when it comes to demand elasticity, I think it's about how much the quantity demanded changes when something else changes.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one.

Option A says it's the ratio of income change to change in quantity demanded. Wait, I think that's more about income elasticity of demand, not price elasticity. Because income elasticity would look at how demand changes when income changes, not the price.

Option B is total revenue divided by change in quantity sold. That doesn't ring a bell. I thought total revenue is price times quantity, but elasticity is a measure of responsiveness, not directly revenue. So B might not be right.

Option C mentions the speed of production in response to demand. That sounds more like supply-side elasticity or production responsiveness, not demand. So probably not C.

Option D says change in quantity demanded due to market conditions other than price. That's vague. Elasticity of demand typically refers to responsiveness to price changes. Other factors might be considered in cross elasticity or other types, but the question is about the general elasticity of demand.

Option E talks about change in quantity supplied due to consumer preferences. Wait, that's about supply, not demand. Plus, elasticity of demand is about how quantity demanded changes, not supplied. So E seems off.

Option F states it's a measure of how quantity demanded responds to price changes. That sounds right. I remember the formula for price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. So F looks correct.

Option G is the ratio of price to quantity demanded. That's just price divided by quantity, which doesn't measure elasticity. It's a simple ratio, not responsiveness.

Option H is percentage change in price. That's only part of the equation for elasticity, not the whole thing. Elasticity compares quantity change to price change, not just the price change itself.

Option I is change in quantity demanded. That's a part of elasticity but not the measure. Elasticity isn't just the change; it's how much it changes relative to the price change.

Option J talks about the price of one good changing in response to another. That sounds like cross-price elasticity, which is a different concept. The question is about elasticity of demand in general, not cross elasticity.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. It accurately describes elasticity of demand as the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes.

The correct answer is F. Elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to changes in its price. This is best captured by option F, which accurately describes it as the extent to which quantity demanded changes in response to price changes.

Answer: F
