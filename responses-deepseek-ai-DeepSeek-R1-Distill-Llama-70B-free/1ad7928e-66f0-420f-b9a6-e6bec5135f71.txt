Okay, so I have this question about Carl Rogers and his person-centered theory. The scenario is that Peter comes from a family where all the male members have been doctors for generations. But Peter decides to become an artist instead. His parents say they love him, but they're really upset about his choice. The question is asking how Rogers would explain this attitude of Peter's parents.

Hmm, I remember that Rogers talked a lot about the concept of the self and how people's self-concepts can sometimes be incongruent with their experiences. So when something happens that doesn't fit with their self-image, it can cause distress. 

In this case, Peter's parents probably have a strong self-structure that includes the idea that being a doctor is the family tradition and maybe even part of their identity. When Peter chooses a different path, it challenges that part of their self-concept. So even though they love him, their self-structure is threatened because their notion of what it means to be a valuable family member (being a doctor) is being contradicted by Peter's choice.

Looking at the options, option B says that the parents' self-structure includes the idea that male family members must be doctors, and this is incongruent with their love for Peter, causing distress. That fits with what I was thinking about Rogers' theory. The other options either don't touch on the self-concept or focus on other factors like social stigma, financial stability, or family reputation, which might be related but aren't directly tied to Rogers' specific explanation.

So I think the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around how Carl Rogers would explain the distress of Peter's parents when he chooses to become an artist instead of following the family tradition of becoming a doctor. Rogers' person-centered theory emphasizes the importance of self-concept and the discomfort that arises when experiences conflict with one's self-structure. Peter's parents likely have a self-concept deeply rooted in the notion that male family members should be doctors. Peter's decision threatens this self-structure, causing distress despite their love for him.

Among the options, option B directly aligns with Rogers' theory by highlighting the incongruence between the parents' self-structure and Peter's choice, leading to emotional turmoil.

Answer: B
