Question:

A 19-year-old college student comes to the physician because of vaginal irritation and pain with urination for 5 days. Two weeks ago, she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?

Options:

A: Bacterial vaginosis
B: Candidiasis
C: Chlamydia trachomatis infection
D: Escherichia coli infection

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the scenario is.

The patient is a 19-year-old college student who's presenting with vaginal irritation and pain during urination for the past five days. She had streptococcal pharyngitis two weeks ago and was treated with amoxicillin. She's sexually active with two partners in the past year and uses condoms. Her last menstrual period was a week ago. Her vital signs are normal except maybe slightly low blood pressure. On pelvic exam, there's erythema of the vulva and vagina, and a thick white discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4.

Hmm. So I need to determine the most likely cause from the options given: bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, Chlamydia, or E. coli infection.

Let me think about each possibility.

First, the patient was recently treated with amoxicillin for strep throat. Antibiotics can disrupt the normal vaginal flora, which might predispose her to certain infections. For example, killing off the protective bacteria could lead to an overgrowth of yeast, which is a common cause of vaginal candidiasis.

Looking at the symptoms: she has vaginal irritation, dysuria (painful urination), and a thick white discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4. I remember that normal vaginal pH is acidic, around 3.8-4.5. In bacterial vaginosis (BV), the pH tends to be higher than normal, often above 4.5 because the bacteria in BV (like Gardnerella) produce amines that raise the pH. So a pH of 4 would be on the lower side, which doesn't support BV. So maybe not option A.

Candidiasis, which is a yeast infection, typically presents with a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge. The pH in these cases remains acidic, usually below 4.5. So a pH of 4 fits here. Also, after antibiotic use, the risk of yeast infections increases because the normal flora (like Lactobacillus) is reduced, allowing yeast to overgrow. So this seems to fit.

Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. It often presents with symptoms like dysuria and abnormal discharge, but the discharge in Chlamydia is typically more mucopurulent, maybe yellowish. Also, the pH in Chlamydia might be higher than normal, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the patient's presentation with a thick white discharge might not align as much with Chlamydia. Plus, Chlamydia can cause cervicitis, which might present with other signs like a friable cervix or more pelvic pain, but the question doesn't mention those.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is more commonly associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs), such as cystitis or pyelonephritis. The dysuria she's experiencing could be from a UTI, but the presence of a thick white vaginal discharge would be unusual for E. coli. E. coli might cause a different type of discharge, maybe more watery or with a different color. Also, the pH might be different because E. coli can split urea, but I'm not sure how that affects the pH in this context.

So putting it all together: recent antibiotic use leading to yeast overgrowth, symptoms of vaginal irritation and thick white discharge, pH of 4 which is on the lower side. This points towards candidiasis, which is option B.

Another point to consider is that bacterial vaginosis (BV) typically has a fishy odor, especially when potassium hydroxide (KOH) is added. The discharge in BV is usually thin and grayish-white. So the thick white discharge is more indicative of a yeast infection.

Chlamydia and E. coli seem less likely based on the discharge characteristics and pH. Therefore, the most likely answer is B, candidiasis.

The patient is a 19-year-old college student presenting with vaginal irritation, dysuria, and thick white vaginal discharge. She recently completed a course of amoxicillin for streptococcal pharyngitis, which can disrupt normal vaginal flora and predispose her to infections like candidiasis. On examination, the pH of the discharge is 4, which is within the normal acidic range for vaginal pH and aligns with candidiasis, as bacterial vaginosis typically presents with a higher pH. The thick white discharge is characteristic of candidiasis, often described as cottage cheese-like, and the recent antibiotic use further supports this diagnosis.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection and Escherichia coli infection are less likely given the discharge characteristics and pH. Chlamydia often presents with mucopurulent discharge and may involve cervicitis, while E. coli is more associated with urinary tract infections and does not typically cause thick white vaginal discharge. Bacterial vaginosis is also unlikely due to the normal pH and the absence of a fishy odor, which is commonly seen in BV.

Thus, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is candidiasis.

Answer: B
