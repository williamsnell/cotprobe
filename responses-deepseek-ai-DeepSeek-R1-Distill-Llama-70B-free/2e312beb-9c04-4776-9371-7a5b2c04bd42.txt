Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a string under tension and its frequency. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The problem says the string has a tension of 256 newtons and a frequency of 100 vibrations per second. Then the tension is changed to 144 newtons, and I need to find the new frequency. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember that the frequency of a string under tension relates to the tension. Oh right, the formula for the frequency of a vibrating string is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ), where T is the tension and μ is the linear mass density. Oh, but wait, does this formula imply that the frequency is proportional to the square root of the tension? Because T is under the square root here.

So if I rearrange that, f is proportional to sqrt(T/μ), but assuming that the length L and the mass per unit length μ stay the same, right? Because the problem doesn't mention changing the string or its length. So in this case, μ and L are constants.

So the initial frequency f1 is 100 Hz when T1 is 256 N. The new tension T2 is 144 N, and we need to find f2.

Since f is proportional to sqrt(T), I can set up a proportion. So f1 / f2 = sqrt(T1 / T2). Wait, no, wait: if f is proportional to sqrt(T), then f1/f2 = sqrt(T1 / T2). Or maybe it's f2 = f1 * sqrt(T2 / T1). Let me think.

Wait, if f increases when T increases, because a tighter string vibrates faster. So when T goes up, f goes up. So yes, f is directly proportional to sqrt(T).

So the formula should be f2 = f1 * sqrt(T2 / T1).

Let me plug in the numbers:

T1 is 256 N, T2 is 144 N.

So sqrt(T2/T1) = sqrt(144/256). Let's compute that. 144 divided by 256 is... Let me see: 144/256 = 9/16, since 144 is 12^2 and 256 is 16^2. So sqrt(9/16) is 3/4.

So f2 = 100 Hz * (3/4) = 75 Hz.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 75 vps, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, is the formula correct? Because another version I remember is f = (1/2L) * sqrt(T/μ). So when T increases, f increases, which aligns with the previous reasoning. So yes, the proportion is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach it using ratios without plugging in the formula. Since f is proportional to sqrt(T), the ratio f2/f1 is sqrt(T2/T1). So f2 = f1 * sqrt(T2/T1).

So same calculation as before: (144/256) is 9/16, square root is 3/4. So 100 * 3/4 is 75. So 75 Hz.

Looking back at the options, option I is 75 vps. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between frequency and tension for a vibrating string. The frequency \( f \) is proportional to the square root of the tension \( T \), given by the formula:

\[
f \propto \sqrt{T}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- Initial frequency \( f_1 = 100 \, \text{Hz} \)
- Initial tension \( T_1 = 256 \, \text{N} \)
- New tension \( T_2 = 144 \, \text{N} \)

First, calculate the ratio of tensions:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{144}{256} = \frac{9}{16}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{16}} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Now, calculate the new frequency:

\[
f_2 = f_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}} = 100 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 75 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Thus, the new frequency is \( 75 \, \text{Hz} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
