Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the root mean square (rms) speed of gases. Hmm, I remember that rms speed is related to the temperature and the molar mass of the gas. Let me try to think through this.

The problem says the rms speed of hydrogen (H₂) is 1600 m/s at a temperature T. And the question is asking for the rms speed of oxygen (O₂) at the same temperature. Right, I think there's a formula that connects rms speed with molar mass.

Wait, the formula I remember is the rms speed equation from the kinetic theory of gases. The formula is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/(M)), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass in kilograms per mole. Oh wait, or was it per mole? Yeah, I think M is the molar mass.

So since the temperature is the same for both gases, T is a constant here. So the rms speed depends on the square root of the inverse of the molar mass. Because the other terms (3R) are constants too. So if I have two gases, their rms speeds are inversely proportional to the square roots of their molar masses.

Hydrogen is H₂, so its molar mass is 2 g/mol. Wait, no, wait—no, wait, the molar mass of hydrogen (H₂) is 2 grams per mole because each hydrogen atom is about 1 g/mol, and there are two atoms in a molecule. Similarly, oxygen (O₂) has a molar mass of 32 g/mol because each oxygen atom is 16 g/mol, and there are two in the molecule.

Wait, but in the formula, M needs to be in kg/mol, right? So I should convert those. So H₂ is 0.002 kg/mol, and O₂ is 0.032 kg/mol.

So the rms speed of H2 is 1600 m/s, and I need to find the rms speed of O2 at the same T.

So using the formula, the ratio of their rms speeds would be the square root of (M_O2 / M_H2), but wait, wait, no. Because v_rms is sqrt(3RT/M), so if I take v1/v2 = sqrt( M2 / M1 ). Let me double-check. Let me denote v1 as the rms speed of H₂, and v2 as that of O₂.

So v1 = sqrt(3RT/M1), v2 = sqrt(3RT/M2). So v1/v2 = sqrt( (3RT/M1) / (3RT/M2) ) = sqrt( M2 / M1 ). 

Wait, no, wait. Let me do the ratio correctly. v1 over v2 is sqrt( (3RT/M1) ) divided by sqrt( (3RT/M2) ) which becomes sqrt( (M2)/(M1) ). So v2 = v1 * sqrt( M1 / M2 ).

Ah, right, that makes sense. Because if M increases, the speed decreases, so the ratio is sqrt(M1/M2).

So M1 is H2's molar mass, which is 2 g/mol. M2 is O2's molar mass: 32 g/mol.

So M1 is 2, M2 is 32. So the ratio M1/M2 is 2/32 = 1/16.

So the square root of 1/16 is 1/4. So v2 = v1 * (1/4).

Since v1 is 1600 m/s, then v2 is 1600 * (1/4) = 400 m/s.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Because another way: if the molar mass is larger, the speed should be smaller. So O2 is heavier than H2, so O2 should have a lower rms speed. So if H2 is 1600, O2 should be lower, which 400 is.

Looking at the options, option A is 400 m/sec. So the correct answer should be A.

The root mean square (rms) speed of a gas is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}
\]

where \( R \) is the gas constant, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( M \) is the molar mass of the gas. Since the temperature \( T \) is the same for both hydrogen (\( \text{H}_2 \)) and oxygen (\( \text{O}_2 \)), the rms speeds are inversely proportional to the square roots of their molar masses:

\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}}
\]

Here, \( v_1 \) is the rms speed of hydrogen, \( v_2 \) is the rms speed of oxygen, \( M_1 \) is the molar mass of hydrogen (\( 2 \, \text{g/mol} \)), and \( M_2 \) is the molar mass of oxygen (\( 32 \, \text{g/mol} \)).

Rearranging for \( v_2 \):

\[
v_2 = v_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{M_1}{M_2}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
v_2 = 1600 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{32}} = 1600 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{16}} = 1600 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 400 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the rms speed of oxygen at the same temperature is \( 400 \, \text{m/s} \). From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 400 m/sec**
