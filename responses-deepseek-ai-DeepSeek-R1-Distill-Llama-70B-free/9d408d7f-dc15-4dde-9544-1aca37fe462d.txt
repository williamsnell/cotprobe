Okay, so I've got this physics question here about the wavelength of a sound wave from a tuning fork. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the tuning fork is standard and emits at 440 cycles per second. Oh wait, 440 Hz, that's the standard concert pitch for A above middle C. I remember that.

I need to find the wavelength. Wavelength is the distance a wave travels in one complete cycle. So I think the formula that connects speed, frequency, and wavelength is v = fλ, where v is the speed of sound, f is frequency, and λ is wavelength.

Right, so if I can remember the speed of sound in air, that's probably needed here. I think the standard speed is around 343 meters per second at room temperature. But wait, the answer options are in feet. Oh right, because the options are in feet, I should convert the speed into feet per second.

How do I convert meters to feet? Let me think. 1 meter is approximately 3.281 feet. So 343 m/s multiplied by 3.281 should give me the speed in feet per second.

Let me do that math. 343 * 3.281. Let's see, 300*3 is 900, but wait, 343 is more precise. So 343 * 3 is 1029, 343 * 0.281 is about 96.4, so total is around 1125.4 feet per second. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 343 * 3.281:

343 * 3 = 1029.

343 * 0.281: Let me compute 343 * 0.2 = 68.6, 343 * 0.08 = 27.44, 343 * 0.001 = 0.343. Adding those: 68.6 +27.44 is 96.04, plus 0.343 is 96.383. So total is 1029 + 96.383 = 1125.383 ft/s. So approximately 1125.4 ft/s.

Wait, no, wait. I think I might be making a mistake here. Wait, the speed of sound varies with temperature, but standard is often taken as 331 m/s in dry air at 0°C and 343 m/s at 20°C. So 343 m/s is correct for room temp. But wait another thing: I'm pretty sure the speed of sound in feet per second is often approximated as 1120 ft/s. So maybe I should use that as a simpler number. So 1120 ft/s is the speed.

So, v = 1120 ft/s, f = 440 Hz.

Using the formula v = fλ, we can solve for λ: λ = v/f.

So λ = 1120 / 440. Let me compute that. 440 times 2 is 880, 440 times 2.5 is 1100. Because 440*2=880, 440*0.5=220, so 880+220=1100. So 440*2.5 = 1100. So 1120 is 20 more than 1100, so 1120/440 = 2.5 + (20/440). 

20/440 is 0.04545... So λ ≈ 2.5 + 0.045 = 2.545 feet.

Looking at the options, I see option G is 2.5 ft (approx.), and option J is 3.5 ft, so the closest would be G.

Wait but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the speed. Let me double-check. Because 343 m/s is about 1125.383 ft/s as I calculated before. So let me use that exact number.

So λ = 343 m/s * (3.281 ft/m) / 440 Hz.

Wait no, wait. Wait, v is 343 m/s, but I need to convert that to ft/s. So 343 * 3.281 = approx 1125.383 ft/s.

So λ = 1125.383 / 440 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1125.383 ÷ 440.

Well, 440 * 2 = 880.

440 * 2.5 = 1100, as before.

So 440 * 2.545 = 440*(2 + 0.5 + 0.045) = 440*2=880, 440*0.5=220, 440*0.045=19.8. So 880+220=1100, +19.8=1119.8. Which is about 1120, which is what we have. So 1125.383 is a bit more than 2.545. Let's compute 1125.383 /440.

440 * 2.545 = 1119.8, as above. The difference is 1125.383 - 1119.8 = 5.583.

So 5.583 /440 = approx 0.01268. So total λ ≈ 2.545 + 0.01268 ≈ 2.5577 feet.

So approximately 2.56 feet. So the closest option is G, which is 2.5 ft (approx.), but wait, sometimes the speed is taken as 1130 ft/s. Let me try that.

If v is 1130 ft/s, then 1130/440 ≈ 2.568, which is around 2.57 ft. Still, the closest option is G, 2.5 ft.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option G is 2.5 ft (approx.), so that's the correct choice.

To determine the wavelength of the sound wave emitted by a standard 440 Hz tuning fork, we use the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength: 

\[
v = f \lambda
\]

Here, \(v\) is the speed of sound, \(f\) is the frequency, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength. The speed of sound in air at room temperature is approximately \(343 \, \text{m/s}\), which converts to about \(1125.4 \, \text{ft/s}\) (using \(1 \, \text{m} \approx 3.281 \, \text{ft}\)).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(\lambda\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
\]

Substituting \(v = 1125.4 \, \text{ft/s}\) and \(f = 440 \, \text{Hz}\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1125.4}{440} \approx 2.557 \, \text{ft}
\]

This value is approximately \(2.56 \, \text{ft}\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(2.5 \, \text{ft}\), which corresponds to option G.
