Okay, so I've got this question here about a 30-year-old woman who's having some mood issues related to her menstrual cycle. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the patient is nulliparous, which means she hasn't given birth before. She's been having mood changes for several months. The symptoms she describes are anxiety, hyperactivity, and trouble sleeping, and these happen 3 to 4 days before her menses start. Then, when her period begins, she feels acutely depressed, stops eating (anorectic), gets irritable, and becomes lethargic. Her physical exam is normal, and she has no psychiatric history. She and her husband have been trying to conceive for over two years, and she had a tuboplasty a year ago to fix a closed fallopian tube.

So, the main issue here seems to be mood symptoms that are cyclic and tied to her menstrual cycle. The question is asking for the most likely diagnosis from the given options.

Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about various things for at least six months. It's not specifically tied to the menstrual cycle, so this might not fit since her symptoms are clearly premenstrual.

Option B: Bipolar I disorder, mixed. Bipolar I involves manic episodes, and a mixed episode would have both manic and depressive symptoms at the same time. The patient's symptoms seem to be more tied to her cycle rather than being a broader mood disorder. Plus, she doesn't have a history of mania or mixed episodes as far as we know.

Option C: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). PMDD is a condition where women experience severe mood and physical symptoms in the premenstrual phase. Symptoms include irritability, anxiety, mood swings, and then depression when menses start. This seems to fit her description pretty well. She has anxiety and hyperactivity before her period, then depression and lethargy when it arrives.

Option D: Cyclothymic personality. Wait, I think cyclothymic disorder is a mood disorder with periods of hypomania and depression, but it's over two years. But the key here is that her symptoms are specifically related to her menstrual cycle, which points more towards PMDD than a personality disorder. Also, cyclothymic is a personality issue which is more long-standing.

Option E: Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). This is a chronic depression that lasts two years or more. Her symptoms are fluctuating with her cycle, not persistent, so probably not this.

Option F: PTSD. Post-traumatic stress disorder would come after a trauma. There's no mention of any trauma in her history, so this is unlikely.

Option G: Seasonal affective disorder. This occurs at certain times of the year, typically winter. Her symptoms are monthly, so not seasonal.

Option H: Bipolar II disorder. This involves major depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes. Again, her symptoms are tied to her menstrual cycle and don't indicate hypomania outside of that.

Option I: Adjustment disorder with depressed mood. This is when a person has a depressive reaction to a specific life event or stressor. She did have a tuboplasty, but her symptoms are cyclic and tied to her menses, not a specific event.

Option J: Major depressive disorder. This would be a single episode or recurrent episodes, but again, her symptoms are specifically premenstrual and not the broader depression without a cyclical pattern.

Putting this all together, the patient's symptoms align most closely with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). She experiences distinct mood changes in the premenstrual phase, which are severe enough to affect her life. The key here is the timing relative to her menstrual cycle and the specific symptoms she's exhibiting.

The patient is a 30-year-old nulliparous female presenting with mood changes tied to her menstrual cycle. She experiences anxiety, hyperactivity, and insomnia 3–4 days before her menses, followed by depression, anorexia, irritability, and lethargy when her period begins. She has no psychiatric history and has been trying to conceive for over two years, with a history of tuboplasty to correct a closed fallopian tube. Physical examination findings are normal.

The symptoms are clearly cyclic and linked to her menstrual cycle, which strongly suggests a diagnosis related to premenstrual symptoms. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is characterized by severe mood and physical symptoms in the premenstrual phase, including anxiety, irritability, and depression, aligning closely with her presentation. Other options like generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorders, persistent depressive disorder, PTSD, seasonal affective disorder, adjustment disorder, and major depressive disorder do not fit as well because they lack the specific menstrual cycle correlation and symptom pattern described.
