Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the probability that an electron in a carbon nanotube is located between two specific points, x = 4.95 nm and x = 5.05 nm. The wavefunction given is normalized as ψ = (2/L)^(1/2) * sin(πx/L), and the length L is 10.0 nm. Hmm, okay, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a certain region is the integral of the probability density over that region.

So the probability density is |ψ|². Since this is a real wavefunction, the square is just ψ squared. Let's write that out: |ψ|² = (2/L) * sin²(πx/L). 

The probability P that the electron is between a and b is the integral of |ψ|² dx from a to b. So in this case, a is 4.95 nm and b is 5.05 nm. 

Wait, but L is given as 10 nm. So I should convert those x-values into the same units as L. Oh wait, they are already in nanometers, so that's consistent. So I can proceed without unit conversion.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from 4.95 to 5.05) (2/10) sin²(πx/10) dx. Let me simplify the constants first. 2/10 is 0.2, so 0.2 * ∫ sin²(πx/10) dx from 4.95 to 5.05.

Hmm, integrating sin squared terms. I remember a trigonometric identity that can help here. The identity is sin²θ = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that, the integral becomes 0.2 * ∫ [ (1 - cos(2πx/10)) / 2 ] dx. 

Simplify the constants: 0.2 * (1/2) is 0.1. So the integral is 0.1 * ∫ (1 - cos(2πx/10)) dx from 4.95 to 5.05. 

Breaking this into two integrals: 0.1 [ ∫1 dx - ∫cos(2πx/10) dx ] from 4.95 to 5.05.

Let's compute each integral separately. The integral of 1 dx from a to b is just (b - a). The integral of cos(ax) dx is (1/a) sin(ax) + C. So in this case, a is 2π/10, which simplifies to π/5. So the integral of cos(2πx/10) dx is (5/π) sin(2πx/10) + C, or (5/π) sin(πx/5) + C.

Putting this together, our expression becomes:

0.1 [ (5.05 - 4.95) - (5/π)( sin(2π*5.05/10) - sin(2π*4.95/10) ) ]

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, evaluate (5.05 - 4.95) which is 0.10 nm. So the first term is 0.10.

Now for the second term, involving the sine functions.

Compute 2πx/10 at x=5.05 and x=4.95.

At x=5.05:
(2π * 5.05) / 10 = (2π * 5.05) / 10 = (2 * 5.05 * π) / 10 = (10.1 * π)/10 = 1.01 π.

Similarly, at x=4.95:
(2π *4.95)/10 = (9.9 * π)/10 = 0.99 π.

So the sine terms become sin(1.01π) and sin(0.99π).

I remember that sin(π + θ) is -sinθ. But wait, 1.01π is π + 0.01π, so sin(1.01π) = sin(π + 0.01π) = -sin(0.01π). Similarly, sin(0.99π) is sin(π - 0.01π) = sin(0.01π), because sin(π - θ) = sinθ.

So sin(1.01π) = -sin(0.01π), and sin(0.99π) = sin(0.01π).

So, the difference between these two terms: sin(1.01π) - sin(0.99π) = [ -sin(0.01π) ] - [ sin(0.01π) ] = -2 sin(0.01π).

So the integral becomes:

0.1 [ 0.10 - (5/π) * (-2 sin(0.01π)) ) ]

Wait, wait. Let me retrace. The expression was:

0.1 [ (0.10 ) - (5/π)( sin(1.01π) - sin(0.99π) ) ) ]

Which we determined is:

0.1 [ 0.10 - (5/π)( -2 sin(0.01π) ) ) ]

So that's 0.1 [ 0.10 + (10/π) sin(0.01π) ) ]

Wait, let's compute each part accurately.

Wait, (5/π) multiplied by (-2 sin(0.01π)) would be (5/π) * (-2 sin(θ)) = -10 sinθ / π.

So, the entire term becomes 0.10 - ( -10 sinθ / π ) = 0.10 + (10 sinθ)/π.

So putting it all together:

0.1 * [ 0.10 + (10/π) * sin(0.01π) ) ]

Now, let's compute this.

Wait, 0.01π is a small angle, so sin(0.01π) ≈ 0.01π, because for small θ, sinθ ≈ θ (in radians). So sin(0.01π) ≈ 0.01π.

So, substituting this approximation:

sin(0.01π) ≈ 0.01π.

So, the term (10/π) * sin(0.01π) ≈ (10/π) * 0.01π = 0.10.

So the expression inside the brackets becomes 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20.

So then, 0.1 * 0.20 = 0.02.

Wait, that gives a probability of 0.02, which is 2%.

But wait, I should check if the approximation is valid. Let me compute sin(0.01π) more accurately.

Wait, 0.01π is approximately 0.0314159 radians.

The sine of 0.0314159 is about 0.0314107. So using the approximation, it's about 0.03141, which is very close to 0.01π (0.0314159). So the approximation is good.

Thus, the term (10/π)*0.03141 is approximately (10/3.1416)*0.03141 ≈ (3.1831) * 0.03141 ≈ 0.10.

So the calculation holds.

Therefore, the probability is 0.02, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. Because when I did the substitution, I might have made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the integral exactly without approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact integral to see if it makes a difference.

Let me try that.

The integral we're looking at is 0.1 [ 0.10 + (10/π) * sin(0.01π) ) ]

Wait, let me compute 0.1 * [0.10 + (10/π)* sin(0.01π) ]

Compute each term numerically.

First, 0.10 is 0.10.

Compute (10/π) * sin(0.01π):

sin(0.01π) = sin(0.031415927) ≈ 0.031410759.

So (10/π) * 0.031410759 ≈ (3.183098862) * 0.031410759 ≈ Let's calculate this.

3.183098862 * 0.031410759 ≈ 0.100000.

Wait, exactly, because 3.183098862 is 10/π, and 0.031410759 is approximately (0.01 * π), so their product is approximately 0.1.

So the term inside becomes 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20.

Then, 0.1 * 0.20 = 0.02.

So the probability is 0.02, which is 2%.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.020, which matches.

Wait, but I should make sure that I set up the integral correctly.

The wavefunction is ψ = (2/L)^(1/2) sin(πx/L). So ψ squared is (2/L) sin²(πx/L). The integral from 4.95 to 5.05 gives the probability. All the steps look correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the region is small enough (0.1 nm wide) that I can approximate the probability density as roughly constant over that interval. Then, the probability would be approximately |ψ(x0)|² * Δx, where x0 is around 5 nm.

Let me try that approach as a check.

Compute |ψ(5.00)|². ψ = (2/10)^(1/2) sin(π*5/10) = sqrt(0.2) sin(π/2) = sqrt(0.2) * 1. So |ψ|² is 0.2 * 1 = 0.2.

Then, the probability is approximately 0.2 * (0.10) = 0.02, which matches the earlier result.

So that gives me more confidence that the answer is 0.02, which is option A.

To calculate the probability that the electron is between \(x = 4.95 \, \mathrm{nm}\) and \(x = 5.05 \, \mathrm{nm}\), we use the normalized wavefunction:

\[
\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right),
\]

where \(L = 10.0 \, \mathrm{nm}\). The probability density is \(|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right)\). The probability \(P\) is given by:

\[
P = \int_{4.95}^{5.05} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = \frac{2}{L} \int_{4.95}^{5.05} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right) \, dx.
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \(\sin^2\theta = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}\), the integral becomes:

\[
P = \frac{2}{L} \int_{4.95}^{5.05} \frac{1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)}{2} \, dx = \frac{1}{L} \int_{4.95}^{5.05} \left[1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)\right] \, dx.
\]

Breaking this into two terms:

\[
P = \frac{1}{L} \left[\int_{4.95}^{5.05} 1 \, dx - \int_{4.95}^{5.05} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) \, dx\right].
\]

The first term is straightforward:

\[
\int_{4.95}^{5.05} 1 \, dx = 5.05 - 4.95 = 0.10.
\]

For the second term, the integral of \(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)\) is:

\[
\int \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) \, dx = \frac{L}{2\pi} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right).
\]

Evaluating this from \(4.95\) to \(5.05\):

\[
\int_{4.95}^{5.05} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) \, dx = \frac{L}{2\pi} \left[\sin\left(\frac{2\pi \cdot 5.05}{L}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{2\pi \cdot 4.95}{L}\right)\right].
\]

Substituting \(L = 10.0 \, \mathrm{nm}\):

\[
\frac{2\pi x}{L} = \frac{2\pi x}{10} = \frac{\pi x}{5}.
\]

At \(x = 5.05\), \(\frac{\pi x}{5} = 1.01\pi\), and at \(x = 4.95\), \(\frac{\pi x}{5} = 0.99\pi\). Using the sine function properties:

\[
\sin(1.01\pi) = -\sin(0.01\pi), \quad \sin(0.99\pi) = \sin(0.01\pi).
\]

Thus:

\[
\sin\left(\frac{2\pi \cdot 5.05}{L}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{2\pi \cdot 4.95}{L}\right) = -\sin(0.01\pi) - \sin(0.01\pi) = -2\sin(0.01\pi).
\]

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_{4.95}^{5.05} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) \, dx = \frac{10}{2\pi} \cdot (-2\sin(0.01\pi)) = -\frac{10}{\pi} \sin(0.01\pi).
\]

For small angles, \(\sin(0.01\pi) \approx 0.01\pi\). Substituting this:

\[
-\frac{10}{\pi} \sin(0.01\pi) \approx -\frac{10}{\pi} \cdot 0.01\pi = -0.10.
\]

Now, combining the two terms:

\[
P = \frac{1}{10} \left[0.10 - (-0.10)\right] = \frac{1}{10} \cdot 0.20 = 0.02.
\]

Thus, the probability that the electron is between \(x = 4.95 \, \mathrm{nm}\) and \(x = 5.05 \, \mathrm{nm}\) is \(0.02\), corresponding to option **A**.
