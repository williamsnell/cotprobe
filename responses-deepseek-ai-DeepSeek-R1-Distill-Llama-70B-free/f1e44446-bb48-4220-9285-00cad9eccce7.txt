Okay, so I've got this question about reinforcement schedules and their resistance to extinction. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that different schedules affect how long a behavior persists once the reinforcement stops. Let me try to recall what each schedule entails.

The question is asking which schedule results in behavior that's least resistant to extinction. So I need to find the one where the behavior stops quickly when reinforcement isn't given anymore.

The options are A through J, each with different schedules. Let's think through each one.

Option A: Variable ratio. I think this is where the reinforcement comes after an unpredictable number of responses. Like gambling, right? It's supposed to create high and steady responding and is very resistant to extinction. So this probably isn't the answer.

Option B: Variable interval. This is where reinforcement is given after varying amounts of time. I remember that variable schedules in general are more resistant than fixed ones. So maybe this isn't the least resistant either.

Option C: Fixed ratio with a large ratio. Fixed ratio is when you get reinforcement after a set number of responses, like getting a bonus after every 100 sales. A large ratio would mean you have to do a lot of responses before getting a reward. I think fixed ratios can lead to high response rates, but if the ratio is large, maybe the behavior isn't as strong. Or perhaps when the ratio is large, the reinforcement is sparse, so when it stops, the behavior might extinguish faster? Not sure yet.

Option D: Continuous with long intervals. Wait, continuous reinforcement is when every response is reinforced. But if it's continuous with long intervals, maybe that's not possible. Or perhaps it's a typo and they mean fixed interval with long intervals. Wait, no, continuous would mean every response is reinforced, but with long intervals, maybe the reinforcement is given only after long pauses. Or maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, perhaps continuous reinforcement is when every response is reinforced, which is typically very fast to extinguish because if the reinforcement stops, the behavior stops quickly.

Wait, no—continuous reinforcement (like option E) would mean every correct response is reinforced. So E: continuous. That's supposed to result in quick acquisition but also quick extinction because the behavior depends on every response being reinforced. Without the reinforcement, it stops.

Wait, but the question is about which is least resistant to extinction. So the schedule that leads to the quickest extinction would be the answer.

So, let's go through them again.

Resistance to extinction is generally highest with variable schedules, then fixed schedules, and continuous is the least resistant. Wait, no—continuous reinforcement actually leads to the quickest extinction. Because the organism is used to getting a reward every time. So when the reward stops, they stop responding quickly.

Wait, or was it the other way around? I think variable ratio schedules create the most resistance because the person doesn't know when the next reward is coming, so they keep responding hoping for it. Fixed ratio and interval are less resistant than variable. And continuous is the least resistant.

So among the options, the least resistant would be the continuous reinforcement schedule.

Looking back, option E is continuous. So if E is the correct answer, then the answer is E.

But wait, looking at the options, let's make sure. For example, option C is fixed ratio with large ratio. Fixed ratio schedules, especially with large ratios, may lead to slower extinction than variable ratio. But compared to continuous, fixed ratio might be more resistant than continuous.

So, the behavior under continuous reinforcement would extinguish the fastest, meaning it's least resistant to extinction.

So the correct answer should be E: continuous.

The question asks which reinforcement schedule results in behavior that is least resistant to extinction. Resistance to extinction refers to how quickly a behavior stops when reinforcement is no longer provided. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A: Variable ratio**  
  Reinforcement is given after an unpredictable number of responses. This schedule creates highly resistant behavior to extinction, as the unpredictability motivates continued responding.  

- **Option B: Variable interval**  
  Reinforcement is given after varying amounts of time. Like variable ratio, this schedule also leads to high resistance to extinction due to its unpredictable nature.  

- **Option C: Fixed ratio with large ratio**  
  Reinforcement is given after a fixed number of responses, but with a large ratio. While this can lead to high response rates, a large ratio may result in slower extinction compared to smaller ratios. However, it is still more resistant than continuous reinforcement.  

- **Option D: Continuous with long intervals**  
  This option is unclear, as continuous reinforcement typically means every response is reinforced. If it implies reinforcement after long intervals, it might resemble a fixed interval schedule, which is more resistant to extinction than pure continuous reinforcement.  

- **Option E: Continuous**  
  In continuous reinforcement, every response is reinforced. This schedule leads to rapid acquisition of behavior but also rapid extinction when reinforcement stops, as the behavior is highly dependent on consistent rewards.  

- **Option F: Fixed ratio**  
  Reinforcement is given after a fixed number of responses. This schedule is more resistant to extinction than continuous reinforcement but less resistant than variable schedules.  

- **Option G: Fixed interval**  
  Reinforcement is given after a fixed amount of time. This schedule is less resistant to extinction than variable schedules but more resistant than continuous reinforcement.  

- **Option H: Variable ratio with large ratio**  
  Similar to variable ratio, but with a larger number of responses required. This schedule is highly resistant to extinction.  

- **Option I: Variable ratio with small ratio**  
  Similar to variable ratio but with fewer responses required. Still highly resistant to extinction.  

- **Option J: Fixed interval with long intervals**  
  Reinforcement is given after a fixed amount of time, with longer intervals. This schedule is more resistant to extinction than continuous reinforcement.  

Among the options, continuous reinforcement (Option E) results in behavior that is least resistant to extinction because the behavior stops quickly when reinforcement is withheld.
