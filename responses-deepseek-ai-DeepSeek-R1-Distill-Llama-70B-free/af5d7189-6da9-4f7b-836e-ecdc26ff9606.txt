Okay, so I've got this transformer problem here, and I need to figure out the T-equivalent circuit parameters when referred to the low voltage winding. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. The transformer is 200 kVA, with a voltage rating of (13,200 / 2,200) volts. It's a single-phase transformer operating at 60 Hz. There are some test data provided: open circuit and short circuit measurements.

The parameters we need to find are for the T-equivalent circuit, referred to the low voltage side. The options are from A to J. I think the first step is to calculate the turns ratio because that's essential for referring impedances.

The turns ratio (a) is the ratio of high voltage to low voltage. So, high voltage is 13,200 volts, low is 2,200. So a = 13,200 / 2,200. Let me calculate that: 13,200 divided by 2,200. 2,200 times 6 is 13,200. So a is 6. Wait, but turns ratio is usually either a = V1/V2 or a = N1/N2; I think it's V1/V2 here because that's the definition given. So a = 6. Hmm, looking at the options, turns ratio varies. Option A has 6.00, so that's a possible candidate. Others have different ratios. So if my calculation is correct, other options might not have the correct a, but I should confirm.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The transformer's rated voltage is 13,200 / 2,200. So primary is 13,200 V, secondary is 2,200 V. So the turns ratio a is V1/V2 = 13,200 / 2,200 = 6. Yes, that's correct. So any option without a turns ratio of 6 can be eliminated. Looking at the options:

Option A: 6.00
Option B:5.70
C:5.82
D:5.90
E:4.82
F:6.82
G:5.82
H:5.82
I:6.00
J:5.50

So possible correct options are A and I. Others have different a values. But wait, maybe I'm wrong about which side is primary and secondary. Let me think again. The problem says the transformer is (13,200 / 2,200) volts. Typically, the first voltage is primary, second is secondary. So I think a is 6. So options A and I have a=6.

Wait, no, looking again, option I has a=6.00, same as A. So both A and I have the correct a. Hmm, but the other parameters will help differentiate.

Next, I think about the open circuit test. It's done to find the core losses and the magnetizing reactance. The open circuit test is usually done on the low voltage side, but I'm not sure; sometimes it's done on either side. Wait, the open circuit test data is 2,200 volts, 3.1 amps, 1,550 watts, 60 Hz, and 12,800 volts. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, the open circuit test: if the transformer is open on the secondary side, then the primary is supplied with voltage. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think.

Wait the open circuit test is done with one winding open. Typically, the one with lower voltage is easier to leave open. So if the test is done with the secondary open, then the primary is supplied with voltage. Alternatively, the test could be done with the primary open, but that would require a much higher voltage source, which is less likely. So I think the open circuit data is with the secondary open. 

Wait, the given open circuit data lists volts as 2,200, which is the low voltage. So probably, the primary is supplied with 2,200 V, and the secondary is open. Because if the secondary is open, the primary voltage would be 2,200 V, and the current would be 3.1 A. The power input is 1,550 watts.

Wait, no: the open circuit test usually measures the core loss. So the power input is the core loss, which is 1,550 watts here. So that's P_oc = 1,550 W. Then, the magnetizing current is 3.1 A, and the magnetizing impedance is V_oc divided by I_oc. So Z_oc = V_oc / I_oc = 2,200 V / 3.1 A. Let me compute that.

2,200 / 3.1 is approximately 710 ohms. So the open circuit impedance is about 710 ohms. Since in an open circuit, the current is the magnetizing current, which is much smaller than the full load current, that makes sense. Now, the open circuit impedance Z_oc is approximately equal to the magnetizing reactance X_m, because the resistance R_core is much smaller than X_m. So X_m is about 710 ohms.

Wait, but Z_oc is the parallel combination of R_core and X_m. So Z_oc = (R_core * X_m) / (R_core + X_m). Since R_core is much smaller than X_m, Z_oc ≈ R_core. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when you have a parallel RC circuit, the impedance is dominated by the smaller of the two. So if X_m is much larger than R_core, then Z_oc ≈ R_core. But if R_core is much smaller, then at 60 Hz, X_m is typically much larger than R_core, so Z_oc is approximately R_core. Wait, but in our case, Z_oc is 710 ohms, which is about 2,200 / 3.1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The open circuit test is performed to find the core losses and the magnetizing reactance. The equivalent circuit for the open test would have the magnetizing branch in parallel with the core loss resistance.

So, the power input in the open circuit test is equal to the core loss, which is I² R_core. Wait, no. In the open circuit test, the input power is equal to the core loss (P_core) plus the copper loss, but since the secondary is open, the copper loss is I² R_winding, where I is the excitation current. But the copper loss is usually small and sometimes neglected. Alternatively, some textbooks say that the open circuit test measures the core loss (also called iron loss) plus a small copper loss, which is the I² R of the primary winding. But in our case, the power is given as 1,550 W, which is the core loss plus primary copper loss. Wait, but no, in the open circuit test, the current is small, so the copper loss is small compared to the core loss. So P_oc is approximately equal to the core loss.

Wait, but here, P_oc is 1,550 W. So R_core is P_oc / V² * something. Wait, no. The core loss is modeled as a resistance in parallel with the magnetizing inductance. So the power is V² / R_core. Because in parallel, the power is V² / R_core.

So, the open circuit power is P_oc = V_oc² / R_core. So R_core = V_oc² / P_oc.

V_oc is 2,200 V. So R_core = (2,200)^2 / 1,550.

Calculating that: 2,200 squared is 4,840,000. Divided by 1,550.

4,840,000 / 1,550 ≈ let's compute.

1,550 goes into 4,840,000 how many times. Let me approximate:

1,550 * 3,000 = 4,650,000. So 4,840,000 - 4,650,000 = 190,000 left.

190,000 / 1,550 ≈ 122.58. So total is 3,000 + 122.58 ≈ 3,122.58 ohms. So R_core ≈ 3,122.58 ohms.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because earlier, Z_oc was 710 ohms, which would be the parallel combination of R_core and X_m. So if R_core is 3,122 and X_m is 710, then 1/R_core is about 0.00032 mho, and 1/X_m is about 0.001408 mho. So the total admittance Y_oc is approximately 0.0017 mho, which is 1/588 ohms. But our Z_oc was 710 ohms, so this doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the open circuit test was done on the high voltage side. Let me reconsider that.

Wait, the open circuit test data is: Volts = 2,200, which is the low voltage rating. So if the test was done on the low voltage side, with the high voltage side open, then the current is 3.1 A. But that would mean the primary is 2,200 V, and the secondary is open. So the magnetizing current is 3.1 A. So in that case, the magnetizing reactance X_m is V / I = 2,200 / 3.1 ≈ 710 ohms, as I calculated earlier. Then, the core resistance R_core is (V²) / P_oc.

Wait, that's correct. So R_core = (2,200)^2 / 1,550 ≈ 4,840,000 / 1,550 ≈ 3,122.58 ohms.

But wait, the magnetizing reactance X_m is 2πfL_m, where L_m is the magnetizing inductance. So X_m = 2π * 60 * L_m = 377 * L_m.

So if X_m is 710, then L_m = 710 / 377 ≈ 1.884 H.

But how does this help us with the T-equivalent circuit? Hmm.

Now, the T-equivalent circuit has series impedance (r1' + r2) + j (x1' + x2), and shunt impedance (R_core || X_m). But when referring to the low voltage side, some of these parameters will be scaled.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps.

The T-equivalent circuit parameters when referred to the low voltage side (secondary) would involve scaling the primary parameters by the square of the turns ratio.

Wait, the turns ratio a is V1/V2 = 6. So when referring primary quantities to secondary, we divide by a².

So, the shunt elements (R_core and X_m) are on the primary side, so when referred to the secondary, they would be divided by a².

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the T-equivalent circuit, the shunt branch (core loss and magnetizing) are in the primary's reference. So when referring everything to the secondary (low voltage), we need to adjust these shunt elements.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the short circuit test.

The short circuit test data: volts = 210, current = 90.9 A, power = 2,500 W, frequency 60 Hz. So the short circuit test is performed by shorting the secondary and applying a voltage on the primary until the current is rated. But wait, the voltage here is 210 V, and the current is 90.9 A. Let me compute the impedance.

In the short circuit test, the impedance Z_sc is V_sc / I_sc = 210 V / 90.9 A ≈ 2.31 ohms. The power is P_sc = 2,500 W, which is equal to I_sc² (R_eq), where R_eq is the equivalent resistance. So R_eq = P_sc / I_sc² = 2,500 / (90.9)^2 ≈ 2,500 / 8,256.81 ≈ 0.303 ohms.

So the series resistance r_eq is approximately 0.303 ohms. The reactance can be found from Z_sc² = R_eq² + X_eq². So X_eq = sqrt(Z_sc² - R_eq²) = sqrt(2.31² - 0.303²) ≈ sqrt(5.336 - 0.0918) ≈ sqrt(5.244) ≈ 2.29 ohms.

Wait, but in the short circuit test, the magnetizing current is neglected, so the impedance measured is primarily the series impedance, which includes the primary and secondary resistances and reactances.

Wait, but when the transformer is referred to the low voltage side, the series resistance and reactance are the sum of the primary and secondary impedances, referred appropriately.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the short circuit test gives the series impedance, which includes the primary and secondary resistances and leakage reactances. So the equivalent series impedance Z_eq is R_eq + j X_eq.

But when referring to the secondary side, the primary resistance and reactance are referred to the secondary by dividing by a². So the total series resistance is r1' + r2, and the series reactance is x1' + x2. But since in the short circuit test, we measure the total series impedance referred to the primary, but in this case, the short circuit test was done on the secondary, so the voltage is applied to the primary, and the current is measured in the primary.

Wait, no, actually, in the short circuit test, the secondary is shorted, and a voltage is applied to the primary to circulate the full-load current. But the voltage and current measured are on the primary side. So the impedance measured (Z_sc) is the primary's series impedance plus the secondary's series impedance referred to the primary.

Wait, so Z_sc (primary) = (r1 + r2') + j (x1 + x2'), where r2' = r2 / a², and x2' = x2 / a².

But when referring everything to the secondary side, the series impedance becomes (r1' + r2), where r1' = r1 / a².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the T-equivalent circuit when referred to the secondary.

So, the T-equivalent circuit parameters when referred to the secondary (low voltage) would have:

- Series resistance: r1' + r2 = (r1 / a²) + r2

- Series reactance: x1' + x2 = (x1 / a²) + x2

But wait, the T-equivalent circuit's series branch includes both resistance and reactance. So the short circuit test gives us the total series impedance, which is sqrt(R_eq² + X_eq²). But in our case, the R_eq from the short circuit test is approximately 0.303 ohms, and X_eq is about 2.29 ohms. So total Z_eq is around 2.31 ohms, which matches the Z_sc we calculated earlier.

Wait, no. The Z_sc is 210 / 90.9 ≈ 2.31 ohms. The R_eq is 0.303 ohms, so X_eq is sqrt(2.31² - 0.303²) ≈ 2.29 ohms.

So, the series impedance when referred to the primary is 2.31 ohms. But when referred to the secondary, this would be multiplied by a², because impedance scales with the square of the turns ratio when referred from primary to secondary.

Wait, no, wait. If the short circuit test is done on the secondary side, the measured impedance is the primary's impedance plus the secondary's impedance referred to the primary. So Z_sc_primary = (r1 + r2') + j(x1 + x2'), where r2' = r2 / a², etc.

But when referring to the secondary, the series impedance would be (r1' + r2) + j(x1' + x2), where r1' = r1 / a², x1' = x1 / a².

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure this.

The short circuit test gives us the series impedance as viewed from the primary. So Z_sc_primary = r1 + r2' + j(x1 + x2'), where r2' = r2 / a² and x2' = x2 / a².

But when we refer to the secondary, this Z_sc_primary becomes Z_sc_secondary = (r1 + r2/a² + r2) * a² ???

No, perhaps it's better to think that the short circuit impedance measured from the primary is Z_p = (r1 + (r2/a²)) + j(x1 + (x2/a²)).

When referred to the secondary, the series impedance is Z_s = (r2 + (r1/a²)) + j(x2 + (x1/a²)).

But from the short circuit test, we have Z_p = 2.31 ohms, which is equal to (r1 + r2/a²) + j(x1 + x2/a²). The real part is R_eq = 0.303 ohms, and the imaginary part is X_eq ≈ 2.29 ohms.

So, from the short circuit test, when referred to the primary:

r1 + r2/a² = 0.303 ohms

x1 + x2/a² = 2.29 ohms

But when we refer to the secondary side, the series resistance becomes:

r2 + r1/a² = ?

Similarly, the series reactance is x2 + x1/a².

But we don't have individual values for r1 and r2, or x1 and x2. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the T-equivalent circuit referred to the low voltage winding. So perhaps we need to compute all parameters as referred to the secondary.

So, let's outline the parameters we need for the T-equivalent when referred to the secondary:

- R: The shunt resistance, which is R_core referred to the secondary. Since R_core is in the primary circuit, its value when referred to the secondary is R_core / a².

- X_m: The magnetizing reactance, which is X_m referred to the secondary, so X_m / a².

Wait, no. The magnetizing reactance X_m is part of the shunt branch. In the primary, the shunt branch is R_core in parallel with X_m. When referred to the secondary, these would be scaled by a².

Wait, no. Let me think again. The magnetizing reactance and core resistance are on the primary side. So when referred to the secondary, their values are divided by a².

So R_core_secondary_ref = R_core / a².

X_m_secondary_ref =
