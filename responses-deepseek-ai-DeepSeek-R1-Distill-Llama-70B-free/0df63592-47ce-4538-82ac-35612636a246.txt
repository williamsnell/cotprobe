Question:

There are two highly inbred strains of laboratory mice whose adult body weights are very different. Assume that the mouse's body weight is under the control of three pairs of contrasting genes: A vs. a, B vs. b and D vs. d. Assume further that each capital letter gene is responsible for contributing 5.0 grams to the total body weight, and that lowercase letters contribute 2.5 grams to total body weight. The average weight of mice in Strain I is 30 grams, while that of Strain II mice is 15 grams. (a) What are the most likely genotypes of these two strains? (b) Suppose Strain I and Strain II are crossed. What will be the phenotype of the F_1 progeny?

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

So, the question is about two strains of mice, Strain I and Strain II. Their average body weights are different—30 grams for Strain I and 15 grams for Strain II. The body weight is controlled by three pairs of genes: A/a, B/b, and D/d. Each capital letter (dominant) contributes 5 grams, and each lowercase (recessive) contributes 2.5 grams. 

Part (a) asks for the most likely genotypes of these two strains. Part (b) is about crossing them and finding the F1 phenotype.

Hmm, okay. So each gene contributes a certain amount. Let's think about the total. Each gene has two alleles, so each pair contributes (for a dominant and recessive) or both dominant or both recessive.

Wait, the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. Oh, wait, each capital contributes 5g, and each lowercase 2.5g. But wait, each gene has two alleles, so for each gene (like A), each allele adds its value. So for each gene, the total contribution is the sum of the two alleles. So for a gene, like AA would be 5 +5=10g. Aa would be 5 +2.5=7.5g. And aa would be 2.5+2.5=5g.

Wait, but wait—no. Actually, wait. Each pair of genes (like A/a) contributes a certain amount. So each gene has two alleles, but each allele contributes its value. So each gene contributes a total of (sum of alleles) to the body weight.

Wait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's model this. Let's say each gene contributes a certain amount based on its alleles.

Each pair of alleles (like A and a) contributes to the weight. So for each gene, the total contribution is based on the two alleles.

So for each gene:
- If it's homozygous dominant (AA), each A contributes 5g, so total is 10g.
- If it's heterozygous (Aa), then 5 + 2.5 =7.5g.
- If it's homozygous recessive (aa), 2.5 +2.5 =5g.

So each gene contributes 10, 7.5, or 5 grams. And since there are three genes, the total weight is the sum of all three.

So Strain I has an average weight of 30g. Let me calculate what genotype would give that.

Each of the three genes contributes maximum (10g each), so 3 *10=30g. So each gene must be AA. So genotype for Strain I would be AABBDD? Because all three are homozygous dominant.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have other combinations. Let me check.

Strain II has 15g. Let's see. Each gene contributes 5g (aa) each. So 3 *5=15g. So all three genes are homozygous recessive: aabbdd.

So for part (a), Strain I is AABBDD, Strain II is aabbdd. Let's look at the options.

Option C says Strain I: AA BB DD, Strain II: aabb dd. So that matches. The F1 progeny would be... let's see.

Now, when you cross Strain I (AABBDD) with Strain II (aabbdd), what's the F1?

Each parent is homozygous. So for each gene:

- A/a: parents are AA (Strain I) and aa (Strain II). So all F1 will be Aa.
- B/b: same, parents are BB and bb. F1 is Bb.
- D/d: parents are DD and dd. F1 is Dd.

So F1 genotype is AaBbDd.

Now, the phenotype is determined by each gene's contribution. Each Aa contributes 7.5g (5+2.5), same for Bb and Dd. So each gene contributes 7.5g.

So total weight is 3 *7.5 =22.5g.

Looking at the options, option C says F1 is 22.5g. So that matches.

Wait, let me check the options. Option C is:

C: Strain I: AA BB DD, Strain II: aabb dd, F1:22.5g.

Yes. So option C is a candidate.

But let me check other options to be sure.

Option A: Strain I: AABB DD. Wait, that's AA for A, BB for B, DD for D. So same as option C. Strain II is aabb dd—same as option C. Then F1 is 20g. But according to my calculation, F1 should be 22.5g. So option A's F1 is wrong. So A is out.

Option D: Strain I: AABB; Strain II: aabb. Wait, each has only two genes? No, question says three genes. So that's probably wrong because D isn't considered. So D is incorrect.

Option G: Strain I has AA BB DD, Strain II has aa bb dd. So F1 would be AaBbDd, same as before. So F1 weight would be 22.5g. So option G says F1 is 27.5g, which is higher. So that doesn't match. So G is wrong.

Wait, why would option G's F1 be 27.5g? Oh, maybe I miscalculated. Let me see. Oh, no, if each is Aa, Bb, Dd, each gives 7.5, so 3 *7.5=22.5. So option C is correct.

Wait, what about option B? Strain I is AAbb DD. So for A, it's AA, B is bb. So each gene's contribution would be:

A: AA →10g.

B: bb →5g.

D: DD →10g.

So total is 10+5+10=25g. But Strain I's average is 30g. So this is wrong. So option B can't be correct.

Option E: Strain I is AABB Dd. So for D, it's Dd, which contributes 7.5g. So total would be 10 (A) +10 (B) +7.5 (D)=27.5g. But Strain I is 30g, so this doesn't fit. So option E's Strain I is wrong.

Option F: Strain I is AA BB DD. So same as option C. Strain II is aa BB dd. So for B, Strain II is BB? Wait, no, Strain II has aa BB dd. So for B, they are BB. Then when crossed with Strain I's BB, all F1 would be BB. So for gene B, F1 would be BB →10g. For A: Aa →7.5g. For D: Dd →7.5g. So total is 7.5 +10 +7.5=25g. But Strain I is AA BB DD, which is 30g. But Strain II here is aa BB dd, which would have B as BB, so that gene contributes 10g. So Strain II's weight would be: A is aa (5g), B is BB (10g), D is dd (5g). Total 20g, but Strain II's average is 15g. So this can't be right. So option F's Strain II is wrong.

Option I: Strain I has AA bb dd. So A is AA →10, B is bb →5, D is dd →5. Total 20g. But Strain I's average is 30g, so no. So I is wrong.

Option J: Strain I is AA bb DD. So A is 10, B is 5, D is 10. Total 25g. But Strain I is 30g. So wrong.

Option H: Both strains are Aa Bb Dd. But if both parents are Aa Bb Dd, then F1 would require a different calculation, but their weights would be 7.5 *3=22.5g each. But Strain I is 30g, so no. So H is out.

So the only option that fits is option C. Strain I is AA BB DD, Strain II is aabb dd, and F1 is 22.5g.

To solve the problem, we analyze the genotypes of the two mouse strains and their F1 progeny based on the given gene contributions and phenotypic weights.

### Part (a): Determining the genotypes of Strain I and Strain II
1. **Gene Contributions**: Each capital letter allele (A, B, D) contributes 5.0 grams, and each lowercase allele (a, b, d) contributes 2.5 grams. For each gene, the total contribution is the sum of its two alleles:
   - **AA**: 5 + 5 = 10 g
   - **Aa**: 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 g
   - **aa**: 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 g

2. **Strain I (30 g)**: To achieve a total weight of 30 g, all three genes must contribute the maximum amount (10 g each). This requires Strain I to be homozygous dominant for all three genes: **AABBDD**.

3. **Strain II (15 g)**: To achieve a total weight of 15 g, all three genes must contribute the minimum amount (5 g each). This requires Strain II to be homozygous recessive for all three genes: **aabbdd**.

### Part (b): Determining the phenotype of the F1 progeny
When Strain I (**AABBDD**) is crossed with Strain II (**aabbdd**), the F1 progeny will inherit one allele from each parent for each gene:
- **A/a**: F1 = **Aa** (5 + 2.5 = 7.5 g)
- **B/b**: F1 = **Bb** (5 + 2.5 = 7.5 g)
- **D/d**: F1 = **Dd** (5 + 2.5 = 7.5 g)

The total weight of the F1 progeny is the sum of the contributions from all three genes:  
\[
7.5 + 7.5 + 7.5 = 22.5 \, \text{g}
\]

### Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Correct genotypes for Strain I and Strain II, but incorrect F1 weight (20 g instead of 22.5 g). **Eliminated**.
- **Option B**: Incorrect genotypes for Strain I and Strain II. **Eliminated**.
- **Option C**: Correct genotypes for Strain I (**AABBDD**) and Strain II (**aabbdd**), and correct F1 weight (22.5 g). **Correct**.
- **Option D**: Incorrect genotypes, as it only considers two genes. **Eliminated**.
- **Option E**: Incorrect genotypes for Strain I and Strain II. **Eliminated**.
- **Option F**: Incorrect genotypes for Strain II and incorrect F1 weight. **Eliminated**.
- **Option G**: Incorrect F1 weight (27.5 g instead of 22.5 g). **Eliminated**.
- **Option H**: Incorrect genotypes for both strains. **Eliminated**.
- **Option I**: Incorrect genotypes for Strain I and Strain II. **Eliminated**.
- **Option J**: Incorrect genotypes for Strain I and Strain II. **Eliminated**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **C**: Strain I: **AABBDD**, Strain II: **aabbdd**, F1 progeny: **22.5 g**.
