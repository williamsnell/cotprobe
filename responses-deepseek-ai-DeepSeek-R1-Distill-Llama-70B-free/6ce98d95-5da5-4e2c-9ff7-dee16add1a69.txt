Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?

Options:

A: It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.
B: It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.
C: It goes against the spirit of the Twenty-fourth Amendment by effectively imposing a "literacy tax."
D: It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.
E: It violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating write-in candidates differently.
F: It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.
G: It unreasonably limits the means by which a candidate can campaign, infringing on democratic practices.
H: It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.
I: It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.
J: It interferes with the right to vote as guaranteed by the Nineteenth Amendment.

Okay, so I've got this constitutional law question here, and I need to figure out the strongest argument the candidate can make against the state's interpretation of the statute. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A state passed a law that requires write-in candidates' names and office designations to be written in ink on the ballot. A candidate, who's German-American, is trying to help his voters by sending them tear-off stickers with his name and office. His campaign thinks this will help because many German voters aren't proficient in English and might have trouble writing it correctly. But the election official says the stickers don't comply with the statute because they require the information to be written in ink, not stickers. The candidate sues, claiming this violates the U.S. Constitution.

So, the question is about which constitutional argument is the strongest here.

Let's look at the options provided. The options are A through J, each citing different constitutional amendments or clauses.

The key here is to figure out which constitutional right is being infringed upon by the state's action. The state says the stickers don't comply because they're not in ink, so the voters can't use them. The candidate's voters might have trouble writing the name and office, especially if they're not English-proficient. So, the issue is about access to voting, possibly discrimination based on language, or an unfair burden on certain groups.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack English proficiency. That sounds like a possible Equal Protection claim under the 14th Amendment, as it's treating non-English speakers differently.

Option C: It goes against the spirit of the 24th Amendment by imposing a "literacy tax." The 24th Amendment prohibits poll taxes, but it doesn't directly address literacy tests. However, the Supreme Court has held that literacy tests that disproportionately affect minorities are unconstitutional under the 14th and 15th Amendments, but I'm not sure about the 24th.

Option I: It interferes with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which banned literacy tests. That could be a strong argument because if the state is effectively requiring voters to write in English, it might be akin to a literacy test, which is prohibited.

Option D: Discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general. Similar to A but broader.

Option B: Interferes with the federal election power under the 15th. The 15th Amendment prohibits denying the vote based on race or color, but this situation is about language, not race. Unless the voters are a racial minority, but the question specifies German-Americans, which is more of a language issue than race.

Option E: Treats write-in candidates differently. Not sure, because the statute applies to all write-in candidates, so it's not about treating them differently from others, but about the method.

Option F: Discriminates against write-in candidates. Again, the law applies to all write-ins, so maybe not discrimination against them as a class.

Option G: Limits campaign methods, affecting democratic practices. Not sure if that's a direct constitutional claim; it's more about campaign regulation.

Option H: Restricts free speech. I don't see a direct free speech issue here. The regulation is about how votes are cast, not about campaign speech.

Option J: Interferes with the 19th Amendment, which is about sex discrimination in voting. Not relevant here.

So, focusing on the possible options: A, C, D, I.

The 24th Amendment (Option C) deals with poll taxes, not literacy. But the Voting Rights Act (Option I) does deal with literacy tests. The VRA prohibits literacy tests as a prerequisite to voting. So, if the state is requiring that the voter write the name and office in ink, and if the voter can't do that because of language barriers, it's effectively a literacy test.

Wait, but the state isn't requiring a literacy test per se; they're requiring the voter to write the candidate's name and office. So, it's more of a ballot access issue. The Supreme Court has held that ballot access laws must not be unduly burdensome. So, if the law makes it harder for certain groups to vote for a candidate, that could be an Equal Protection issue under the 14th Amendment.

Option A is about discrimination against German voters lacking English. That's a specific group, so it's a possible Equal Protection claim. Option D is broader, about all non-English speakers.

The candidate's argument is that the state's interpretation burdens these voters unduly, effectively disenfranchising them because they can't write the name and office correctly. So, this could be a violation of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits practices that result in the denial of the vote based on race, color, or language, under Section 208 or other sections.

Wait, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, includes protections against language discrimination. Section 208, I think, requires that voting materials be provided in languages other than English where a certain percentage of the population speaks that language. But this situation isn't about providing materials in another language; it's about how the voter marks the ballot.

Alternatively, the argument could be that the requirement imposes a burden similar to a literacy test, which the VRA prohibits. So, the state's rule could be seen as a "test" that voters must pass—writing the name correctly—which could disproportionately affect non-English speakers.

So, Option I says it interferes with the VRA by outlawing literacy tests. That might be the strongest argument because the VRA specifically bans literacy tests, and this could be seen as effectively imposing one.

Alternatively, Option C suggests it's a literacy tax. But the 24th Amendment is about poll taxes, not literacy. So, that might not be the best fit.

Option A is about discrimination against a specific language group, but the Equal Protection claim would require showing that the law disproportionately affects them and that it's a suspect classification. Language can be tied to national origin, which is a suspect classification, so that could be a strong argument.

But the VRA specifically addresses literacy tests, so Option I might be a more direct argument.

Alternatively, the candidate might argue that the state's requirement violates Section 2 of the VRA, which prohibits voting practices that result in the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or language. If the statute makes it harder for non-English speakers to vote for the candidate, it could be a violation under VRA Section 2.

So, considering all this, the strongest argument might be that it violates the VRA by effectively imposing a literacy test, which is prohibited. So, Option I.

Alternatively, if the argument is under the Equal Protection Clause, Option A or D could be possible, but the VRA might offer a more direct statutory basis.

Wait, the question is about the constitutional argument, not statutory. So, the VRA is a federal law, not a constitutional amendment. The candidate is suing under the U.S. Constitution, so the argument would be based on constitutional provisions, possibly the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

So, perhaps the strongest constitutional argument is that it violates Equal Protection because it discriminates against non-English speakers, a suspect class. So, Option A or D.

But Option A is more specific, about German voters, while D is broader. The Equal Protection argument would likely be based on the impact on non-English speakers generally.

Wait, but the question is about the strongest constitutional argument. So, the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause could be invoked, arguing that the statute disparately impacts non-English speakers. Alternatively, if the statute imposes a requirement that's akin to a literacy test, it could be challenged under the 15th Amendment, but that's more about race, not language.

Alternatively, the 24th Amendment could be stretched, but I think the stronger argument is Equal Protection under the 14th.

So, looking at the options again:

Option C: Spirit of 24th Amendment. Not directly applicable.

Option I: VRA, but that's a statutory claim, not constitutional.

So, the constitutional argument would be based on the 14th Amendment.

So, the options that relate to Equal Protection are A, D, E, F.

Option A: Discriminates against German voters (a specific group).

Option D: Discriminates against non-English speakers in general.

So, which is stronger? The law may disproportionately affect non-English speakers, making it hard for them to write the name correctly. So, an Equal Protection claim based on language, which is tied to national origin, a suspect classification.

Thus, the strongest argument is that it unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general (Option D).

Wait, but Option A is about German voters specifically. If the group is based on national origin, which is a suspect classification, then a court would apply strict scrutiny. So, Option A could also be a strong argument.

But the question is about the strongest possible argument, and it's possible that the broader argument (Option D) is better because it's not limited to one group but applies to all non-English speakers, which may include multiple protected classes.

Alternatively, the candidate's argument is that the statute as interpreted by officials imposes a requirement that effectively acts as a literacy test, which is prohibited under the 14th Amendment because it disproportionately affects certain groups. So, perhaps Option C, but I thought earlier that the 24th doesn't cover literacy tests.

Wait, the 24th Amendment says: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax."

But the Supreme Court has held that the 24th Amendment also prohibits the denial of the vote based on literacy tests, beyond just poll taxes. So, in cases like Carr v. Salerno (1973), the court has interpreted the 24th Amendment to cover more than just taxes. So, if the state is requiring voters to write in the candidate's name and office, and this has the effect of a literacy test, it could be seen as violating the 24th Amendment.

Therefore, Option C could be a viable argument.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

The 24th Amendment prohibits the federal government and the states from denying the right to vote in federal elections due to the failure to pay a poll tax or other tax. However, the Supreme Court in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (1966) struck down Virginia's poll tax as a violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, but also noted that it was a violation of the 24th Amendment in federal elections.

But the Court has also held that literacy tests in federal elections are a violation of the 14th Amendment, and under the 24th Amendment, as seen in Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), where the Court upheld the federal law banning literacy tests in federal elections as a valid exercise under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, but also in line with the 24th.

So, if the state's requirement of writing in the name and office in ink is akin to imposing a literacy test, it could be a violation of the 14th Amendment and the 24th Amendment.

Thus, Option C says it goes against the spirit of the 24th by imposing a "literacy tax," which might be a stretch, but it's possible.

Alternatively, the argument under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, claiming that the law disproportionately impacts non-English speakers, which is a suspect class, would require strict scrutiny.

So, perhaps the strongest argument is under the Equal Protection Clause, making Option A or D the best.

But Option C is about the 24th Amendment, which might not directly apply to state elections unless it's a federal election. Wait, the scenario says it's a state election. The 24th Amendment applies to federal elections, so maybe it's not applicable here.

So, if the election is state-level, then the 24th Amendment's protections don't apply because they only cover federal elections. That's an important point.

So, Option C might not be applicable because it's a state election, not a federal one.

Therefore, the argument would have to be under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

So, Option A or D.

The candidate's argument is that the requirement discriminates against non-English speakers, making it harder for them to vote for him. So, this is a disparate impact on a protected class—non-English speakers, which ties into national origin, a suspect classification.

Thus, under Equal Protection, the state would have to meet strict scrutiny, showing a compelling interest and that the law is narrowly tailored.

So, the strongest argument would be that it's an Equal Protection violation, treating non-English speakers differently.

Looking at the options, Option D says it unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general. That seems broader and more encompassing of the issue.

Alternatively, Option A is about German voters specifically. But the issue affects all non-English speakers, not just Germans. So, Option D is a better fit.

So, the strongest argument is Option D: It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.

Wait, but the question is about the strongest constitutional argument. So, is there a better option?

Another angle: the statute might impose an undue burden on the right to vote, violating the fundamental right to vote under the 14th Amendment.

But the options don't include that directly. The options are about discrimination or other specific amendments.

So, among the given options, the best is likely Option D.

Wait, but wait. The candidate is a write-in candidate, and the statute applies to all write-in candidates. So, the argument isn't about write-in candidates being treated differently, but about the voters being unable to comply due to language barriers.

So, the issue is that the statute's requirement (writing in ink) is more burdensome for non-English speakers, thus violating Equal Protection.

Therefore, the strongest argument is that it unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters, which is Option D.

The question revolves around a state statute requiring write-in candidates' names and office designations to be written in ink on the ballot. A German-American candidate challenges this requirement, arguing that it disproportionately affects non-English speaking voters who may struggle to write the information correctly. The candidate sues, claiming the state's interpretation violates the U.S. Constitution.

To determine the strongest constitutional argument, the analysis focuses on several key points:

1. **24th Amendment (Option C)**: While the 24th Amendment prohibits poll taxes and has been interpreted to also address literacy tests in federal elections, it does not apply to state elections. Since the scenario involves a state election, this option is not directly applicable.

2. **Voting Rights Act (Option I)**: The VRA prohibits literacy tests and discrimination based on language. However, the question specifically asks for a constitutional argument, not a statutory one. Thus, while the VRA is relevant, it is not the strongest constitutional claim.

3. **Equal Protection Clause (14th Amendment)**: The statute's requirement of writing in ink may disproportionately impact non-English speakers, who face a higher burden in complying. This raises an Equal Protection issue, as language proficiency is tied to national origin, a suspect classification under strict scrutiny.

4. **Specific vs. Broader Discrimination**: Option A focuses on German voters specifically, while Option D addresses non-English speakers in general. The broader argument (Option D) is stronger because it encompasses all affected voters, not just one group.

5. **Other Options**: Options B, E, F, G, H, and J are less relevant or inapplicable. For example, the 15th Amendment (Option B) pertains to race, not language, and the 19th Amendment (Option J) addresses sex discrimination, which is unrelated here.

The strongest constitutional argument is that the statute unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. This makes Option D the most compelling choice.

**Answer: D**
