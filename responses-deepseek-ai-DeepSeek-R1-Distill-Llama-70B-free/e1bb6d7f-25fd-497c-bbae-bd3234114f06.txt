Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about criminal law, specifically regarding attempted murder charges. The defendant was driving recklessly at a high speed, over 100 mph in a residential area. He lost control, jumped the curb, and hit a woman walking on the sidewalk. She got really hurtâ€”severe injuries, hospitalized for 11 months, permanently disabled.

The question is whether he should be found guilty of attempted murder. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to recall what attempted murder entails. Attempted murder is generally the intentional act of trying to kill someone, with the intent to cause their death. So, the key here is intent. Did the defendant specifically intend to kill the woman?

In this scenario, the defendant was driving recklessly. Reckless driving suggests a disregard for the safety of others, but does that equate to the specific intent required for attempted murder? I think there's a difference between recklessness and intent. Recklessness is more about being aware of a substantial risk and ignoring it, which is a lower mental state than intent.

Attempted murder requires the specific intent to kill. So, if the defendant didn't have that intent, he can't be guilty of attempted murder. The fact that he was driving recklessly might support a charge like reckless endangerment or maybe even manslaughter if someone died, but not attempted murder.

Looking at the options:

Option F says "not guilty because he didn't intend to kill the woman." That seems right because intent is a key element for attempted murder. Without that specific intent, the charge doesn't hold.

Option C suggests guilty because of willful and wanton disregard. Willful and wanton is more about recklessness, which again doesn't meet the intent required for attempted murder.

Option I says guilty because a person is presumed to intend natural and probable consequences. That's the doctrine of transferred intent, but I think that applies when the intent is there but directed at the wrong target. Here, the issue is whether the defendant had any intent to kill anyone at all.

Option J talks about awareness of potential consequences. That's more like recklessness again, not specific intent.

So, putting it together, since the defendant was reckless but didn't specifically intend to kill the woman, he shouldn't be convicted of attempted murder. The correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F. The defendant's reckless driving indicates a disregard for safety, but attempted murder requires specific intent to kill, which is absent here.

Answer: F
