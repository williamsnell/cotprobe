Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Rogerian therapy. I remember that Rogerian therapy is also called client-centered therapy, right? It's all about the client's experience and the therapeutic relationship. The main idea, if I recall correctly, is that the therapist creates a supportive environment where the client feels safe to explore their feelings.

The question is asking what the major task of a Rogerian therapist is. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says conducting psychological tests. Hmm, I don't think so. Rogerian therapy is more about the therapeutic relationship rather than testing or diagnosis. So probably not A.

Option B is about prescribing medication. No, that's more of a psychiatrist's role, not a therapist, especially in Rogerian approach which is more talk-based.

Option C mentions analyzing past traumas in every session. I think that's more Freudian or psychodynamic therapy. Rogerian might touch on the past, but it's not the focus every session.

Option D is about finding a cure. I don't think the Rogerian approach is about curing; it's more about helping the client find their own way through self-actualization.

Option E, judging and evaluating the client. No, Rogerian emphasizes unconditional positive regard, so the therapist wouldn't judge.

Option F talks about changing behavior through reinforcement. That sounds more like behavior therapy, which uses techniques like operant conditioning.

Option G is interpreting behavior, which again sounds like psychoanalysis or cognitive-behavioral approaches.

Option H is providing direct solutions. I don't think so; Rogerian therapists don't give advice but facilitate the client's own problem-solving.

Option I says establishing an atmosphere where the client can be open to experience. That rings a bell. Rogerian therapy is all about creating a supportive, non-judgmental space where the client feels comfortable exploring their thoughts and feelings.

Option J is challenging the client's beliefs. That's more of a cognitive-behavioral approach where they question and change maladaptive thoughts.

So putting it all together, the major task is to create that supportive environment. So the correct answer should be I.

The major task of a Rogerian (or client-centered) therapist is to establish an atmosphere that allows the client to feel safe and open to experiencing their emotions and thoughts. This approach emphasizes unconditional positive regard, empathy, and genuineness to facilitate the client's self-exploration and growth, rather than focusing on diagnosis, behavior change, or providing solutions.

Answer: I
