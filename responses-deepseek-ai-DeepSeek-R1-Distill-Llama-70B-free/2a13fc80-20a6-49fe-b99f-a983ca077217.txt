Question:

A large data set contains information about all students majoring in computer science in colleges across the United States. The data set contains the following information about each student.
   ° The student's gender
   ° The state in which the student attends college
   ° The student's grade point average on a 4.0 scale

 Which of the following questions could be answered by analyzing only information in the data set?

Options:

A: What is the percentage of students majoring in computer science who also participate in sports?
B: How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state?
C: Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects?
D: What is the average age of students majoring in computer science?
E: What is the most common second major for students majoring in computer science?
F: Which college has the highest number of students majoring in computer science?
G: What percent of computer science majors receive financial aid?
H: What percent of students attending college in a certain state are majoring in computer science?

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which question can be answered by the given dataset. Let's see what the dataset includes. It has information about each student majoring in CS, specifically their gender, the state they attend college in, and their GPA on a 4.0 scale. So I need to look at each question and see if it can be answered with just that info.

Option A: Percentage of CS students who play sports. Hmm, the dataset doesn't mention anything about sports participation. So I don't think we can answer this.

Option B: How many states have more female CS majors than male. Oh right, the data has gender and state. So for each state, we can count the number of male and female students. If in a state, females are more than males, we count that state. So yes, this is possible.

Option C: Do CS majors have higher GPAs than other majors? Well, the dataset only has GPA for CS students. There's no data on other majors, so we can't compare. So no.

Option D: Average age. The dataset doesn't include age, so can't answer this.

Option E: Most common second major. The dataset only mentions the major as CS. So no info on second majors. Can't answer.

Option F: Which college has the highest number of CS students. Wait, the dataset doesn't mention specific colleges, only states. So we can't tell which particular college, only which state has more. So F isn't answerable.

Option G: Percent of CS students on financial aid. The dataset doesn't include financial info, so no.

Option H: Percent of students in a state who are CS majors. Hmm, the dataset has each student's state but not the total number of students in each state across all majors. Without knowing the total students in a state, we can't find the percentage that are CS majors. So H can't be answered.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The dataset contains all students majoring in CS across the US. So for each state, we know how many CS majors there are. But to find the percentage of all students in a state that are CS majors, we need the total number of students in that state. Since the dataset doesn't include non-CS majors, we can't calculate that percentage. So H is not possible.

So the only correct answer is option B.

The correct answer is B.

B: How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state?

Step-by-step explanation:
- The dataset includes each student's gender and state.
- For each state, the number of male and female CS majors can be counted.
- States where females outnumber males can be identified and counted.

Answer: B
