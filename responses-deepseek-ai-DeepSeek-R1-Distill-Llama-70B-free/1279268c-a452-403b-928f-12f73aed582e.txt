Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a 55-year-old man admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. His behavior is a bit concerning, and I need to figure out which psychological defense mechanism explains it. Let me try to break this down.

First, the scenario: The man is a business executive, so he's probably used to being in control and respected. He's polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff. That's interesting because he's treating people differently based on their status maybe. Physicians are higher up, so he's polite, but nurses and others are lower, so he's rude. That makes me think of splitting—like seeing people as either all good or all bad. But I'm not sure yet.

Then, his family comes to visit. His wife and two of three children arrive. He says with disgust that the missing child is and always has been worthless. So he's being really harsh about his own child. That's a strong reaction. Why would he do that? It could be a defense mechanism where he's redirecting his feelings. Like, maybe he's upset about being in the hospital and not in control, so he's taking it out on his child.

Let me think about the options provided. The options are A through J, each a different defense mechanism.

Option A: Denial. That's when someone refuses to accept reality. But here, he's not denying his situation; he's expressing strong emotions about his child. So maybe not denial.

Option B: Regression. That's when someone reverts to an earlier stage of development, like a child. I don't see clear signs of that here. He's acting authoritative but not childlike.

Option C: Projective identification. This is when someone attributes their own unacceptable feelings to others and then interacts with them based on that. Like, if he feels worthless, he might see his child as worthless. But I'm not too familiar with this one, so I'll have to think more.

Option D: Reaction formation. That's when someone expresses the opposite of their true feelings. For example, if he loves his child but acts hateful. Maybe, but why would he do that? I'm not sure if that fits perfectly.

Option E: Displacement. This is redirecting emotions from the original source to a safer target. So if he's angry at being sick or in the hospital, he might take it out on someone he feels safe with, like the missing child. That could make sense because he's expressing disgust toward his child when maybe he's upset about something else.

Option F: Projection. This is attributing one's own unacceptable feelings to others. So if he feels worthless, he might say his child is worthless. That could fit because he's being critical of his child, possibly reflecting his own feelings.

Option G: Rationalization. Making excuses for behavior. Doesn't seem to fit here because he's not justifying his actions, just expressing disdain.

Option H: Splitting. This is seeing people as either all good or all bad. He's polite to the physician (good) and berates others (bad). That fits well with splitting. Also, he's devaluing his child, which is part of splitting where you idealize some and devalue others.

Option I: Intellectualization. Avoiding emotions by focusing on the intellectual aspects. Doesn't fit because he's being emotional about his child.

Option J: Sublimation. Channeling unacceptable feelings into constructive behavior. Not relevant here.

So now I'm considering options E, F, H, and C. Let me think more.

He's being polite to the doctor and rude to others. That's splitting—dividing people into good and bad categories. Also, his harsh criticism of his child could be part of that, seeing the child as all bad.

But what about displacement? He's redirecting his anger. If he's angry about his health situation, he might take it out on the child. So both displacement and splitting could be at play, but the question is about the most likely explanation.

Alternatively, projection would be if he feels that he himself is worthless and projects that onto the child. But the scenario doesn't give clear evidence that he feels that way about himself.

So between splitting and displacement. The fact that he's treating different people differently (doctor vs others) points more towards splitting. Splitting is a defense mechanism where people are viewed as either all good or all bad, often seen in borderline personality disorder but can occur in others under stress.

Wait, but the question is about his behavior towards the staff and his child. So the splitting would explain both—idealizing the doctor (good) and devaluing the others (bad), and similarly devaluing his child.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is H: Splitting.

The patient, a 55-year-old business executive, exhibits behavior that suggests he is using the defense mechanism of splitting. He is polite to the physician, whom he likely views as a figure of authority or respect, while berating the nurses and staff, whom he may see as less important. This dichotomy—treating individuals as either "all good" or "all bad"—is a hallmark of splitting. Additionally, his harsh criticism of the missing child, describing them as "worthless," further supports this mechanism. By idealizing some individuals (e.g., the physician) and devaluing others (e.g., the staff and his child), he demonstrates the classic pattern of splitting.

Other options, such as displacement (redirecting emotions) or projection (attributing one's own feelings to others), could partially explain his behavior. However, splitting most comprehensively accounts for his actions, as it encompasses both his differential treatment of the hospital staff and his devaluation of his child.
