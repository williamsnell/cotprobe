Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the open systems model of public relations. I remember that public relations models are different ways organizations communicate with their publics. There's like the press agentry model, public information model, two-way asymmetric, two-way symmetric, and then the open systems model.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is true about the open systems model. The options are A through H. Let me think about what each model entails.

The open systems model, I think, is more about the organization being adaptive and interactive with its environment. Unlike the earlier models which were more one-way or focused on persuading the publics, the open systems approach sees the organization as part of a larger environment where it needs to adapt and engage in two-way communication.

So the open systems model emphasizes that organizations are not isolated; they interact with their surroundings. This means they should be flexible and responsive to changes. So they would probably listen to feedback and adjust accordingly.

Looking at the options:

A: It discourages feedback from its publics. That doesn't sound right because open systems would encourage feedback.

B: Aims at maintaining a static environment. No, open systems are dynamic, so B is probably wrong.

C: Supports non-transparency and secrecy. I don't think so. Open systems would promote transparency because they're about interaction, not secrecy.

D: Emphasizes controlling perception rather than adapting. That sounds more like the two-way asymmetric model, where the focus is on persuasion.

E: Adapts to changing environments. Yes, that fits with what I was thinking. Open systems adapt because they're part of a dynamic environment.

F: Promotes one-way communication. No, open systems are about two-way, so F is incorrect.

G: Encourages working in isolation. The opposite, they don't work in isolation, so G is wrong.

H: Focuses on removing communication barriers internally. Hmm, maybe, but the question is about the publics, not internal divisions. So H might not be the best choice.

So the correct answer should be E.

The open systems model of public relations is characterized by its emphasis on adaptability and interaction with the environment. It views the organization as part of a dynamic ecosystem where it must engage in two-way communication and respond to feedback. This model promotes transparency and flexibility rather than secrecy or isolation. Among the options provided, the statement that aligns with these principles is:

**E: It adapts to changing organizational environments.**

Answer: E
