Question:

Each year, the local boys' and girls' club sponsors a "Baseball Card Bonanza. " During the three- day event, collectors of baseball cards gather, exchanging and swapping old cards. A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card. The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.
B: Yes, because the collector used his knowledge of the card's value to exploit the boy.
C: Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.
D: Yes, because the collector took advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge about the card's value.
E: No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.
F: No, because the boy willingly accepted the offer made by the collector.
G: Yes, because the collector was obligated to disclose the true value of the card.
H: No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.
I: No, because the boy had the opportunity to decline the collector's offer.
J: No, because the collector didn't force the boy to sell the card.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about the boy and the collector. Let's see what the scenario is.

So, there's this Baseball Card Bonanza event where people trade cards. A 12-year-old boy and girl are there. A 32-year-old collector approaches them and asks to look through their cards. The boy and girl agree. While looking, the collector finds a 1948 Branch Rickey card. Rickey was the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, so not a player. The collector knows the card is worth over $500 but offers the boy 50 cents. The boy thinks it's not valuable because Rickey wasn't a player, so he sells it. The next day, the boy finds out it's worth $600 and wants to sue for deceit.

The question is whether the boy will prevail in a deceit claim against the collector.

I remember that deceit, or fraud, requires certain elements. Let me think: generally, for fraud, you need a false representation of a material fact, knowledge that it's false (scienter), intent to induce reliance, actual reliance, and damages.

In this case, did the collector make any false statements? The collector asked to look through the cards and offered 50 cents. But the collector didn't say anything false about the card's value, right? He just offered a low price. So the boy agreed to sell it for 50 cents because he thought it wasn't valuable.

So the issue here is whether the collector's offer constitutes fraud. I think in contract law, there's a principle that you don't have to disclose the value of an item unless there's a special relationship, like a fiduciary duty. In most cases, buyers and sellers don't have a duty to disclose the true value. So if someone offers you less than the item's worth, and you accept, that's just a bad bargain, not fraud.

So the collector didn't lie about the card's value. He just offered a low price, and the boy accepted. The boy thought it was worth little, which is why he sold it. So there's no false representation here.

Looking at the options, option E says no because the collector made no false representations of fact. That seems right. Other options like B, C, D, G talk about exploiting or not disclosing the value, but in law, you don't have to disclose unless there's a duty. There's no such duty here.

So the answer should be E.

The boy will not prevail in his claim of deceit against the collector. For a deceit claim to succeed, there must be a false representation of a material fact, knowledge of its falsity, intent to induce reliance, actual reliance, and resulting damages. In this scenario, the collector did not make any false statements about the card's value; he simply offered a low price for it. The boy agreed to the offer based on his own belief about the card's worth. There is no legal obligation for a buyer to disclose the true value of an item unless a special relationship exists, such as a fiduciary duty, which is absent here. Therefore, the collector's actions do not constitute deceit.

E: No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.

Answer: E
