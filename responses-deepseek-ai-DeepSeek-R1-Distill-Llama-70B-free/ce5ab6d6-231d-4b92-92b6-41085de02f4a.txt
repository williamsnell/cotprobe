Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question says: Find the number that makes the statement true: 48 m = Box mm. The options are from A to I, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what the equation is saying. So, 48 meters equals some number of millimeters. Wait, because the right side says "Box mm"â€”I think that's a placeholder for a number, right? So the equation is 48 meters equals X millimeters.

Alright, I remember that meters and millimeters are units of length. I should convert meters to millimeters because the right side is in millimeters. Let me think about the conversion factors. 

I know that 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, and 1 centimeter is 10 millimeters. So, 1 meter is 100 cm * 10 mm/cm. Oh wait, that's 1000 millimeters in a meter. Right, 1 m = 1000 mm. 

So, if I have 48 meters, to convert that to millimeters, I multiply 48 by 1000. Let me do that calculation. 48 times 1000 is 48,000. So 48 meters equals 48,000 millimeters.

Looking back at the options, option B is 48,000. So the answer should be B.

Wait a second, let me double-check. Sometimes I mix up the conversions. Let me recount: 1m = 1000 mm. So 48 m = 48 * 1000 mm. Yeah, that's 48,000. So yes, B is correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward conversion. So I'm confident that B is the right choice.

The equation given is 48 meters equals an unknown number of millimeters. Since 1 meter equals 1000 millimeters, multiplying 48 by 1000 gives 48,000 millimeters. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: 48,000.

Answer: B
