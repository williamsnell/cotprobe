Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about Frere's discovery and where it was located. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Frere was an English antiquarian, right? He was involved in some early archaeological finds. Wait, wasn't he the one who found something related to Stonehenge? Or maybe that's someone else. Hmm.

Wait, no, I think Frere discovered something in Suffolk, England. I recall that he found some flint tools. Oh right, he found flint implements, like stone tools, which were significant because they were associated with extinct animals. That was a big deal because it suggested that humans had existed much earlier than previously thought.

So the question is about the location of his discovery. The options are A to J. Let's go through them.

Option A: Inside a pyramid. No, that's more Egypt-related, like with mummies and pharaohs. Not Frere.

Option B: Ocean depths, sunken ship. Doesn't fit; Frere's finds were on land.

Option C: Remote island, far from humans. Not sure, but I don't think so. His finds were in England, I believe.

Option D: Surface, above extinct animals. Hmm, or was it beneath them?

Wait, I think Frere found the tools in the same layers as the bones of extinct animals like mammoths. So the tools were beneath the remains, not above.

Option E: Beneath the remains. That sounds right.

Option F: Africa where humans hadn't lived. No, Frere was in England, so not this.

Option G: Medieval castle ruins. Medieval is later, Frere's finds were prehistoric.

Option H: Under a skyscraper in a city. No, that's modern and not his context.

Option I: Prehistoric cave. Maybe, but I think his finds were in a different context, like open sites rather than caves.

Option J: Where only dinosaur fossils were found. Dinosaurs were before humans, but I think his site had extinct Ice Age animals, not dinosaurs. Because dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous, much earlier than humans.

Wait, but the question is about where the discovery was located. So the key point is that Frere's tools were found beneath the bones of extinct animals, which supported the idea that humans were much older. So the location would be beneath those remains.

So looking back, option E says "beneath the remains of extinct animals." That matches what I was thinking.

I think that's the correct choice. So the answer is E.

The significance of Frere's discovery was that what he found was located beneath the remains of extinct animals. This finding supported the idea that humans had existed much earlier than previously thought, as the tools were found in the same layers as the bones of mammoths and other Ice Age animals.

Answer: E
