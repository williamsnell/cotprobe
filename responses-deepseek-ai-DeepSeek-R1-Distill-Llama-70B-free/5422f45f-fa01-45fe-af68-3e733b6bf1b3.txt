Okay, so I've got this question about dementias and which one is less likely to have cognitive symptoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my neurology, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that different types of dementia present with different symptoms. Some primarily affect memory and cognition, while others might have more prominent physical or personality changes early on.

The question is asking which dementia has cognitive symptoms that are less likely. So I need to think about which of these options is known for maybe not having as much cognitive impairment, or maybe the cognitive issues come later.

Let's go through the options one by one.

A: Parkinson's. I think Parkinson's disease primarily affects movement. It's known for tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. But I also remember that some people with Parkinson's develop dementia, called Parkinson's disease dementia. So cognitive symptoms are present there, but maybe they come after the motor symptoms. But I'm not sure if cognitive symptoms are less likely overall.

B: Vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause after Alzheimer's. It's caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often due to strokes or small vessel disease. The symptoms can vary depending on the area affected, but I think cognitive issues are a big part of it. So probably not the answer.

C: Pick's disease. Pick's is a type of frontotemporal dementia. From what I remember, frontotemporal dementias often present with changes in personality, behavior, and language, rather than memory problems early on. So cognitive symptoms might be less prominent in the beginning, but I'm not certain if they're less likely overall.

D: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This is a prion disease, and it's known for rapid progression. Symptoms include memory loss, behavioral changes, and visual disturbances. So cognitive symptoms are definitely present.

E: Frontotemporal dementia. As I thought earlier, this often affects the front and temporal lobes. Early symptoms are usually behavioral or language-related. So maybe in the early stages, cognitive symptoms are less pronounced compared to other dementias like Alzheimer's, where memory issues are a big early symptom.

F: NeuroAIDS. This is the neurological manifestation of HIV/AIDS. Symptoms can include cognitive impairment, so I don't think this is the right answer.

G: Alzheimer's. The most common form, and it's all about cognitive decline, especially memory. So definitely not this one.

H: Huntington's. Huntington's disease is primarily a movement disorder with chorea (involuntary movements). But it also has cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms. So cognitive symptoms are present, but maybe they come after the movement issues. But I'm not sure if they're less likely.

I: Lewy body dementia. This is known for cognitive fluctuations, hallucinations, and parkinsonian motor symptoms. Cognitive symptoms are definitely a part of it, so not the answer.

J: Mixed dementia. This is a combination, often of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. So cognitive symptoms would be present from both.

So, based on this, the question is which is less likely to have cognitive symptoms. From what I recall, frontotemporal dementia (E) and Huntington's (H) might present with less cognitive symptoms early on, but more behavioral or movement issues.

Wait, but the question is about which is "less likely" to have cognitive symptoms. So maybe one of these has cognitive symptoms that are not as prominent as others.

Wait, another angle: some dementias are more about personality changes than cognition. Like frontotemporal dementia, where early symptoms might be things like apathy, disinhibition, or language problems, rather than memory loss. So in that case, cognitive symptoms might be less likely in the early stages, but they can develop as the disease progresses.

But the question is about which dementia is less likely to have cognitive symptoms overall, not just early stages.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is Huntington's, because it's more known for movement and psychiatric symptoms, with cognitive decline being a part but perhaps less prominent than in other dementias.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: the term 'cognitive symptoms' can include a variety of functions beyond memory, like executive function, language, etc. So in frontotemporal dementia, there are cognitive symptoms, but they might be different from the memory-centric issues seen in Alzheimer's.

But the question is about being 'less likely' to have cognitive symptoms. So perhaps the answer is Huntington's because it's more known for the movement disorder aspects, and the cognitive decline is maybe not as severe as in other dementias. Or maybe it's the opposite.

I think I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Alzheimer's: definitely has cognitive symptoms, so not the answer.

Vascular dementia: yes, cognitive symptoms.

Lewy body: yes.

Pick's: as a subtype of frontotemporal, same as E.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob: yes.

NeuroAIDS: yes.

Mixed: yes.

So the options left are A (Parkinson's), E (Frontotemporal), H (Huntington's).

Parkinson's with dementia: they do have cognitive issues, but perhaps not as severe as others. Wait, no, Parkinson's disease dementia does have significant cognitive decline.

Frontotemporal: as I thought, early on more personality and behavior, but still cognitive symptoms.

Huntington's: movement is the main thing, but cognitive decline happens. So perhaps in Huntington's, the cognitive symptoms are less likely than in other dementias.

Wait, but the question is about which dementia is less likely to have cognitive symptoms. So perhaps in Huntington's, the primary issues are movement and psychiatric, and cognitive decline is a part but maybe less prominent.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E: Frontotemporal dementia. Because early on, they might not have the same level of cognitive impairment as Alzheimer's. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another angle: the question is about which is less likely to have cognitive symptoms, meaning that in that particular dementia, cognitive symptoms are not a common feature. So perhaps the answer is Huntington's, as it's primarily a movement disorder with dementia being a part of it.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A: Parkinson's, because in early stages, cognitive symptoms might be less, but as the disease progresses, they develop. But the question isn't about the stage.

Wait, the question is about which dementia is less likely to have cognitive symptoms. So which of the listed dementias is known for having less cognitive issues.

I think that in Huntington's, the cognitive issues are present but may be overshadowed by the movement disorder. However, I'm not sure if that makes them less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H: Huntington's, because it's more known for movement and psychiatric issues, and perhaps the cognitive symptoms are less severe or less likely than in other dementias.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another option is E: Frontotemporal, where perhaps early on, the cognitive symptoms are less prominent, but they do develop.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should look for the most probable answer based on what I remember.

I think the answer is E: Frontotemporal dementia, because in its early stages, it's more about personality and behavioral changes rather than cognitive decline. So cognitive symptoms might be less likely early on.

But the question is about which dementia overall is less likely, not just early stages.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H: Huntington's, because the primary symptoms are movement and psychiatric, and cognitive decline is a part but not the main feature.

I'm a bit stuck, but I'll have to make a decision.

Wait, another point: the question says "cognitive symptoms less likely". So perhaps in some dementias, cognitive symptoms are not the primary presentation.

I think the answer is H: Huntington's, because it's primarily a movement disorder, and while cognitive decline occurs, it's perhaps less likely to be the main symptom compared to others.

Alternatively, the answer could be E: Frontotemporal, but I'm not as confident.

Wait, I think I remember that frontotemporal dementia is sometimes called "frontal lobe dementia" and early on, it affects personality and behavior, with cognitive functions like memory being relatively spared. So perhaps cognitive symptoms are less likely in the early stages. But the question doesn't specify the stage.

So I'm a bit torn between E and H.

But the options are E: Frontotemporal dementia, and H: Huntington's.

Another thought: the question is phrased as "cognitive symptoms less likely". So which of these two has less cognitive symptoms compared to others.

From what I've studied, frontotemporal dementia can present with significant cognitive issues, but perhaps not as much as Alzheimer's. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E: Frontotemporal, because it's more about personality changes than cognitive decline, making cognitive symptoms less likely.

I think I'll go with E: Frontotemporal dementia as the answer.

To determine which dementia is less likely to have cognitive symptoms, it is important to analyze the primary symptoms associated with each option:

- **A: Parkinson's**: Primarily a movement disorder with symptoms like tremors and rigidity. While Parkinson's disease dementia can develop, cognitive symptoms are present and significant in the dementia stage.

- **B: Vascular dementia**: Caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often due to strokes. Cognitive symptoms are a prominent feature, making this unlikely to be the answer.

- **C: Pick's disease**: A subtype of frontotemporal dementia, characterized by early behavioral and personality changes. Cognitive symptoms may be less prominent initially but still develop as the disease progresses.

- **D: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease**: A prion disease with rapid progression, including memory loss and cognitive decline. Cognitive symptoms are a key feature.

- **E: Frontotemporal dementia**: Affects the frontal and temporal lobes, often presenting with early behavioral, personality, and language changes. Cognitive symptoms may be less pronounced in the early stages compared to other dementias like Alzheimer's.

- **F: NeuroAIDS**: Involves cognitive impairment as a symptom, so this is not the answer.

- **G: Alzheimer's**: The most common form of dementia, characterized by significant cognitive decline, particularly in memory. This is not the answer.

- **H: Huntington's**: Primarily a movement disorder with chorea and psychiatric symptoms. Cognitive decline is a part of the disease but may be less prominent compared to movement and psychiatric symptoms.

- **I: Lewy body dementia**: Features cognitive fluctuations, hallucinations, and parkinsonian motor symptoms. Cognitive symptoms are a key component.

- **J: Mixed dementia**: Combines features of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, both of which involve cognitive symptoms.

The question asks which dementia is "less likely" to have cognitive symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are present in all forms of dementia, frontotemporal dementia (E) is known for its early emphasis on behavioral and personality changes, with cognitive symptoms being less pronounced initially. Similarly, Huntington's (H) is more associated with movement and psychiatric symptoms, with cognitive decline being a secondary feature. However, frontotemporal dementia is more directly associated with less likelihood of cognitive symptoms in the early stages compared to other dementias.

**Answer: E**
