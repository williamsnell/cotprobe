Okay, so I've got this problem about achromatic lenses. Hmm, I remember that achromatic lenses are designed to minimize chromatic aberration, which happens because different wavelengths of light bend differently. So the idea is that combining two lenses made of different glasses can make the combination achromatic.

The problem gives me two glasses: crown glass with v1 = 60.2 and flint glass with v2 = 36.2. Wait, v is the reciprocal of the dispersive power, right? So dispersive power is (v-1) for each material. Or wait, no, wait, the dispersive power is (n_F - n_C), where n is the refractive index for Fraunhofer lines F and C. And the Abbe value v is (n_d - 1)/(n_F - n_C), I think. So v is the reciprocal of the dispersive power multiplied by (n_d -1). But I'm not sure if that matters for this problem.

The problem says when the two lenses are placed in contact, they form an achromatic combination with a focal length of 10 cm. I need to find the focal lengths of each lens.

Wait, so when you have two lenses in contact, the combined focal length is given by 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2. Right, because the lenses are in contact, so their focal lengths add algebraically.

But since it's achromatic, the chromatic aberration must be zero. That means the condition for achromatism is that (1/f1) * v1 = (1/f2) * v2. Oh wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

The condition for achromatism is that the dispersion caused by the first lens is canceled by the second. So the formula is (1/f1) * (v1) + (1/f2) * (v2) = 0. Wait, no, maybe it's (f1)/(v1) + (f2)/(v2) ) = 0? Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: for an achromatic lens combination, the following must hold:

(1/f1) * (v1) + (1/f2) * (v2) = 0

Wait, I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. The condition for achromatism is that the change in focal length for different wavelengths (the chromatic aberration) is zero. So the formula is that the sum of the contributions from each lens is zero.

Each lens contributes (1/f) * (v), but perhaps with a negative sign based on whether it's converging or diverging. Wait, maybe it's (1/f1)v1 + (1/f2)v2 = 0. Or perhaps (f1/f2) = (v1)/( -v2 ), because if one is positive and the other negative.

Wait, I think the correct condition is (f1)/(v1) + (f2)/(v2) ) = 0. Because each lens's contribution to the chromatic aberration is inversely proportional to their Abbe number. Or maybe I should think in terms of the lens maker's formula.

Wait, the lens maker's formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but that's for a single surface. Maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, I remember that for two lenses in contact to form an achromatic combination, the condition is f1/f2 = v1/v2, but with opposite signs. So, like, if one is positive (convex) and the other is negative (concave), their focal lengths have opposite signs, and their ratio is v1 to v2. So f1/f2 = -v1/v2.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think: the condition is that the combination is achromatic, so the primary chromatic aberration is zero. The formula for that is (1/f1) * (v1) + (1/f2) * (v2) = 0. Let me check that.

Wait, I think that's correct. Because each lens contributes to the chromatic focal shift, and for the combination to be achromatic, these contributions must cancel each other out. So (1/f1) * v1 + (1/f2) * v2 = 0.

So that's equation (1): (1/f1)v1 + (1/f2)v2 = 0.

And equation (2) comes from the total focal length: 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2.

Given that f_total is 10 cm. So 1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/10.

So I have two equations:

1) (v1/f1) + (v2/f2) = 0

2) 1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/10.

Hmm, let me write this down.

From equation 1: v1/f1 = -v2/f2 → f2 = (-v2 f1)/v1.

Wait, solving equation 1 for f2:

v1/f1 + v2/f2 = 0 → v2/f2 = -v1/f1 → f2 = - (v2 f1) / v1.

Wait, v1 is 60.2, v2 is 36.2. So plug in:

f2 = -(36.2 / 60.2) * f1 → f2 ≈ -(0.6013) * f1.

Now, substitute f2 into equation 2.

Equation 2: 1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/10.

Substituting f2:

1/f1 + 1/(-0.6013 f1) = 1/10.

Let me compute 1/(-0.6013 f1) = -1/(0.6013 f1).

So:

1/f1 - 1/(0.6013 f1) = 1/10.

Factor out 1/f1:

[1 - (1/0.6013)] * (1/f1) = 1/10.

Compute 1/0.6013 → approximately 1.663.

So 1 - 1.663 = -0.663.

So:

-0.663 * (1/f1) = 1/10 → (1/f1) = -1/(10 * 0.663) → f1 = -10 * 0.663 → f1 ≈ -6.63 cm.

Wait, that's a negative focal length, so it's a diverging lens.

Then, from f2 = -(36.2/60.2) * f1 → since f1 is negative, f2 will be positive.

f2 = (36.2/60.2)*6.63 → let's compute that.

36.2/60.2 ≈ 0.6013.

So 0.6013 * 6.63 ≈ 3.99 cm.

So f1 is approximately -6.63 cm, f2 is approximately 3.99 cm.

Looking at the options, option I says f2=3.99 cm, f1=-6.63 cm. So that's option I.

Wait, but let me double-check the equations because I might have mixed up the signs. Let me re-express equation 1.

Equation 1: (v1/f1) + (v2/f2) = 0 → (v1/f1) = - (v2/f2) → f2 = - (v2 f1) / v1.

Which is what I did, so the calculations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is (1/f1) * v1 = - (1/f2) * v2 → f2 = - (v2 f1)/v1.

So yes, that's correct.

Another approach: if I let f1 be positive for a converging lens, then f2 would have to be negative if v1 and v2 are positive. Wait, but in our case, flint glass (v2) is lower than crown, so perhaps the flint lens is more dispersive. Wait, but in our solution, f1 is negative. So what does that imply about the lens types.

Wait, if f1 is negative, that's a diverging lens. So which of the two materials would make which lens.

Wait, the problem states that the first lens is crown glass, the second is flint. But the actual type (convex or concave) depends on the focal length.

Wait, in our solution, f1 is -6.63 cm, which is a diverging lens. So the crown glass lens is diverging. The flint glass lens is f2=3.99 cm, which is converging.

Wait, but the formula I used didn't take into account the lens types, only their materials. So the calculation seems correct.

Looking at the options, option I is f2=3.99 cm, f1=-6.63 cm. So that's the right answer.

To solve the problem, we use the conditions for an achromatic lens combination. The two lenses must satisfy the following:

1. **Achromatic condition**:  
   The chromatic aberrations of the two lenses must cancel out, which gives the equation:  
   \[
   \frac{v_1}{f_1} + \frac{v_2}{f_2} = 0
   \]  
   Rearranging, we find:  
   \[
   f_2 = -\frac{v_2}{v_1} f_1
   \]  

2. **Total focal length condition**:  
   The combined focal length of the two lenses is given as 10 cm, so:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{10}
   \]  

### Step 1: Solve for \(f_2\) in terms of \(f_1\)
From the achromatic condition:  
\[
f_2 = -\frac{v_2}{v_1} f_1
\]  
Substituting \(v_1 = 60.2\) and \(v_2 = 36.2\):  
\[
f_2 = -\frac{36.2}{60.2} f_1 \approx -0.6013 f_1
\]  

### Step 2: Substitute \(f_2\) into the total focal length equation
Substitute \(f_2 = -0.6013 f_1\) into \(\frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{10}\):  
\[
\frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{-0.6013 f_1} = \frac{1}{10}
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
\frac{1}{f_1} - \frac{1}{0.6013 f_1} = \frac{1}{10}
\]  
Factor out \(\frac{1}{f_1}\):  
\[
\left(1 - \frac{1}{0.6013}\right) \frac{1}{f_1} = \frac{1}{10}
\]  
Compute \(\frac{1}{0.6013} \approx 1.663\):  
\[
\left(1 - 1.663\right) \frac{1}{f_1} = \frac{1}{10}
\]  
\[
-0.663 \cdot \frac{1}{f_1} = \frac{1}{10}
\]  
Solve for \(f_1\):  
\[
f_1 = -\frac{1}{0.663 \cdot \frac{1}{10}} \approx -6.63 \, \text{cm}
\]  

### Step 3: Solve for \(f_2\)
Using \(f_2 = -0.6013 f_1\):  
\[
f_2 = -0.6013 \cdot (-6.63) \approx 3.99 \, \text{cm}
\]  

### Final Answer
The focal lengths are \(f_1 = -6.63 \, \text{cm}\) and \(f_2 = 3.99 \, \text{cm}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:  

**I: \(f_2 = 3.99 \, \text{cm}, f_1 = -6.63 \, \text{cm}\)**
