Question:

At high pressures and temperatures a quite good equation of state is P(V - nb) = nRT, where b is a constant. Find (\partialV / \partialT)_P and (\partialV / \partialP)_T from this equation and hence dV in terms of P, T, (V - nb), dT and dP.

Options:

A: dV= - [(V - nb) / P]dP - [(V - nb) / T]dT
B: dV= - [(V - nb) / P]dP + [(V - nb) / T]dT = (V - nb) [- (dP / P) + (dT / T)]
C: dV= [(V - nb) / P]dP - [(V - nb) / T]dT
D: dV= [(V - nb) / P]dP + [(V - nb) / T]dT

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The equation of state is given as P(V - nb) = nRT. I'm supposed to find the partial derivatives (∂V/∂T)_P and (∂V/∂P)_T, and then express dV in terms of P, T, (V - nb), dT, and dP. The options are from A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to solve for V in terms of P and T to make taking the partial derivatives easier. Let me try that.

Starting with P(V - nb) = nRT. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for V. Let's divide both sides by P:

V - nb = (nRT)/P

So V = (nRT)/P + nb.

Wait, but n is a constant here, right? So V is expressed in terms of P and T. Now, I need to find the partial derivatives of V with respect to T at constant P, and with respect to P at constant T.

Let me write V as:

V = (nR T) / P + n b

Okay, so for (∂V/∂T)_P, I treat P as a constant. So the derivative of the first term, (nR T)/P, with respect to T is (nR)/P. The second term, nb, is a constant, so its derivative with respect to T is zero. So:

(∂V/∂T)_P = nR / P

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the equation as P(V - nb) = nRT. So perhaps I should be more precise. Let me consider V as a function of P and T. But maybe I should use the equation without solving for V, to take the partial derivatives more formally.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the equation P(V−nb) = nRT and take total differentials on both sides. That might be a good approach because I'm being asked about dV in terms of dP and dT.

Taking the differential of both sides:

d[P(V - nb)] = d(nRT)

On the left side, I'll apply the product rule. So P d(V - nb) + (V - nb) dP = nR dT.

Wait, because n and R are constants, right? So the right side is straightforward. Now, the left side: d[P(V−nb)] is P*d(V−nb) + (V−nb)*dP.

So expanding:

P dV - P dn b + (V - nb) dP = nR dT

Wait, but wait, n is a constant, right? Because in thermodynamics, n is the number of moles, which is usually considered a constant unless otherwise stated. So dn would be zero. So the term -P dn b disappears.

So the equation becomes:

P dV + (V - nb) dP = nR dT

Hmm, I need to solve for dV. Let me rearrange this:

P dV = nR dT - (V - nb) dP

So,

dV = [nR dT - (V - nb) dP ] / P

Hmm, but the question says to express dV in terms of (V - nb), P, T, dT, and dP. Let me see. Oh, because in the equation, (V - nb) is already present, and I can factor that if possible.

Wait, let me look at the expression I have for dV:

dV = [nR dT / P ] - [ (V - nb) dP / P ]

But from the original equation, P(V - nb) = nRT. So nRT = P(V - nb). Therefore, nR = P(V - nb) / T

Wait, let me see. Let's substitute nR from the equation. Because the original equation is P(V - nb) = nRT, so solving for nR gives nR = P(V - nb)/T.

Substituting into the expression for dV:

dV = [ (P(V - nb)/T ) * dT ) / P ] - [ (V - nb) dP / P ]

Simplify each term:

The first term: [ (P (V-nb) dT ) / (T P) ) ] → (V - nb) dT / T

The second term: (V - nb) dP / P

So putting it together:

dV = (V - nb) (dT / T ) - (V - nb) (dP / P )

Factor out (V - nb):

dV = (V - nb) [ (dT / T ) - (dP / P ) ]

Alternatively, I can write this as:

dV = (V - nb) [ (dT/T) - (dP/P) ]

Looking at the options, let's see which matches this. Let me review the options:

Option A: dV= - [(V - nb) / P]dP - [(V - nb) / T]dT

No, that's negative for both terms.

Option B: dV= - [(V - nb)/P]dP + [(V - nb)/T]dT = (V-nb)[ -dP/P + dT/T ]

Wait, that's the same as my expression. Because [ -dP/P + dT/T ] is the same as [dT/T - dP/P]. So option B matches.

Option C: dV= [(V - nb)/P]dP - [(V - nb)/T]dT → That would be positive dP and negative dT, which doesn't match.

Option D: Both terms positive, but the expression I have is (dT/T - dP/P), so D would be [ (V-nb)/P dP + (V-nb)/T dT ], which doesn't match.

So the correct option should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes signs can be tricky.

Wait, when I took the differential, I had:

P dV + (V - nb) dP = nR dT

So, solving for dV:

dV = [nR dT - (V - nb) dP ] / P

That's correct.

Then, replacing nR with [P(V - nb)] / T (from nRT = P(V - nb), so nR = P(V - nb)/T )

So substituting:

dV = [ (P(V - nb)/T ) dT - (V - nb) dP ] / P

Simplify each term:

First term: P(V-nb) dT / (T P) ) → (V - nb) dT / T

Second term: (V - nb) dP / P

So:

dV = (V-nb)(dT/T ) - (V-nb)(dP/P )

Factor out (V - nb):

dV = (V - nb) [ dT/T - dP/P ]

Which can be written as:

dV = (V - nb) [ (dT/T) - (dP/P) ]

Looking at the options, option B is written as:

dV= - [(V - nb)/P]dP + [(V - nb)/T]dT = (V - nb) [ -dP/P + dT/T ]

Which is the same as my expression. So option B is correct.

To solve the problem, we start with the given equation of state:

\[
P(V - nb) = nRT
\]

Taking the total differential of both sides:

\[
d[P(V - nb)] = d(nRT)
\]

Expanding the left-hand side using the product rule:

\[
P \, dV + (V - nb) \, dP = nR \, dT
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(dV\):

\[
P \, dV = nR \, dT - (V - nb) \, dP
\]

\[
dV = \frac{nR \, dT - (V - nb) \, dP}{P}
\]

From the original equation, \(P(V - nb) = nRT\), we can express \(nR\) as:

\[
nR = \frac{P(V - nb)}{T}
\]

Substituting this into the expression for \(dV\):

\[
dV = \frac{\frac{P(V - nb)}{T} \, dT - (V - nb) \, dP}{P}
\]

Simplifying each term:

\[
dV = \frac{(V - nb) \, dT}{T} - \frac{(V - nb) \, dP}{P}
\]

Factoring out \((V - nb)\):

\[
dV = (V - nb) \left(\frac{dT}{T} - \frac{dP}{P}\right)
\]

This matches the form given in **Option B**:

\[
dV = (V - nb) \left(-\frac{dP}{P} + \frac{dT}{T}\right)
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B**
