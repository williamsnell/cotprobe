B: Subtracting quantities
C: Dividing quantities
D: Multiplying quantities
E: Ordering quantities
F: Describing quantities
G: Comparing quantities

Okay, so I've got this question here about a second-grade teacher's lesson. Let me try to understand what's going on. The teacher has each student pick a card with a three-digit number. Then, they model these numbers using base ten blocks on a place value mat. The question is asking which whole number concept this lesson reinforces best.

Hmm, base ten blocks are those physical blocks that represent ones, tens, and hundreds, right? So when students use them on a place value mat, they're probably breaking down the three-digit number into its components. Like, if the number is 245, they'd use two hundreds, four tens, and five ones. 

Wait, so what's the main concept here? Well, place value is a big part of understanding whole numbers. When you decompose a number into hundreds, tens, and ones, you're showing an understanding of how each digit represents a different place value. 

The options given are A through J, each related to different math operations or concepts. Let me go through them one by one.

A: Counting quantities. Counting is more about listing numbers in order, like 1,2,3,... So maybe not the best fit here.

B: Subtracting quantities. That's an operation, but the lesson is about modeling numbers, not performing subtraction.

C: Dividing quantities. Again, an operation, and the question doesn't mention dividing.

D: Multiplying quantities. Another operation. Doesn't seem to fit.

E: Ordering quantities. That's about putting numbers in order from least to greatest or vice versa. They might do that as part of the lesson, but the main focus seems to be on breaking down the number.

F: Describing quantities. Describing could involve talking about the numbers, but the key action here is modeling with blocks, which is more about decomposition.

G: Comparing quantities. Comparing would involve looking at two or more numbers to see which is bigger, etc. Not sure if that's the main point.

H: Decomposing quantities. Oh wait, decomposing is breaking things into parts. That's exactly what they're doing with the hundreds, tens, and ones.

I: Adding quantities. Addition is another operation. The lesson isn't about adding numbers together.

J: Equalizing quantities. That's making two things equal, which doesn't fit here.

So the lesson is about taking a three-digit number and breaking it down into its place values. That's decomposing. So the answer should be H.

The lesson involves students selecting a three-digit number and using base ten blocks on a place value mat to model it. This activity focuses on breaking down the number into its components: hundreds, tens, and ones. This process is known as decomposing quantities, as it involves understanding how each digit represents a different place value. Among the given options, decomposing quantities (H) is the most relevant concept being reinforced in this lesson.

Answer: H
