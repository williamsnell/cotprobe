Okay, let me try to figure out this question. So, there are two statements given, and I need to determine if each is true or false, and then pick the right option from A to J.

Statement 1 says: Highway networks were introduced after ResNets and eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. Hmm, I remember that Highway Networks came before ResNets. Highway Networks were introduced by Kaiming He and others in 2015, right? Or wait, no, maybe ResNets came after. Wait, ResNets were in 2015 as well, I think. Or was it earlier? Let me think. Highway Networks were introduced in a 2015 paper, and ResNets came a bit later, maybe 2015 or 2016. Wait, no, I think ResNets were actually introduced in 2015 as well, perhaps. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. I think Highway Networks came before ResNets. Because ResNets are a type of network that builds on some earlier ideas, possibly including highways. So if Statement 1 says Highway came after ResNets, that would be incorrect. So Statement 1 is false.

Then, the second part of Statement 1: they eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. I think Highway Networks do use max pooling in some cases, but maybe not as much as others. Wait, no, I'm not sure. I remember that Highway Networks use a combination of convolution and max pooling, but perhaps the main point is that they don't rely on max pooling as much as other networks. Or maybe they use something else. Alternatively, maybe they don't use max pooling at all and only use convolutions. I'm not certain. Let me think: Highway Networks have these highway layers which include a transform gate and a carry gate. The transform gate applies a convolution, and the carry gate allows some information to pass through. So maybe they don't use max pooling in their design. So if Statement 1 says they don't use max pooling and only use convolutions, that might be correct. Wait, but the first part of Statement 1 is wrong because Highway Networks were introduced before ResNets, so the first part is false. So Statement 1 is false overall.

Now, Statement 2: DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets. Hmm, I remember that DenseNets have a different structure than ResNets. In ResNets, each residual block has a few layers, and the skip connections go every few layers. In DenseNets, each layer is connected to every other layer in a dense block, which means more connections. So DenseNets have more parameters and require more memory because of their dense connectivity. So Statement 2 is true.

So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Looking at the options, the options are about whether each statement is true or false.

Looking at the options:

Option J: False, True. So J would be correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another thought: Maybe the introduction dates are different. I think Highway Networks were introduced in 2015 by Srivastava et al., and ResNets were introduced in 2015 as well, but perhaps ResNets came later in the same year. So if Statement 1 says Highway Networks came after ResNets, that's false because they were both around the same time, perhaps. Or maybe ResNets came after Highway. So I'm pretty sure that Statement 1 is false because Highway Networks were introduced before ResNets.

So overall, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. So the correct option is J: False, True.

Statement 1 claims that Highway networks were introduced after ResNets and that they eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. However, Highway Networks were introduced before ResNets, making the first part of the statement false. While Highway Networks do use convolutions, they may still incorporate max pooling in certain cases, so the claim about eschewing max pooling is also questionable. Therefore, Statement 1 is false overall.

Statement 2 asserts that DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets. This is true because DenseNets have a densely connected architecture, where each layer is connected to every other layer in a dense block, leading to a higher number of parameters and memory usage compared to ResNets, which use residual connections with fewer layers.

Given this analysis, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true.

The correct answer is **J: False, True**.
