To determine the deviation of each value from the mean, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the mean** of the given values:  
   Mean = (4 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 9) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6.

2. **Compute the deviation** of each value from the mean:  
   - For the first value (4): 4 - 6 = -2  
   - For the second value (4): 4 - 6 = -2  
   - For the third value (6): 6 - 6 = 0  
   - For the fourth value (7): 7 - 6 = 1  
   - For the fifth value (9): 9 - 6 = 3  

   So, the deviations are: **-2, -2, 0, 1, 3**.

3. **Match the computed deviations to the options provided**.  
   The deviations **-2, -2, 0, 1, 3** correspond to **Option H**.

Answer: H
