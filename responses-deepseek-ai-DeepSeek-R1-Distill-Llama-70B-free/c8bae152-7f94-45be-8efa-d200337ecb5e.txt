Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this wave question. Let's see, the question is about what happens when a wave moves from shallow water to deep water. Hmm, I remember that waves behave differently in shallow versus deep water. I think it has to do with the depth relative to the wavelength.

Wait, in shallow water, the wave is a shallow-water wave, right? And in deep water, it's a deep-water wave. I remember that the speed of a wave depends on the depth of the water in some way. Oh right, for shallow water, the speed is related to the square root of the depth. Like, v = sqrt(g*h), where h is the depth. So when the water is shallow, the speed is slower because h is smaller. 

Deep water waves, I think, have their speed determined by the wavelength and the frequency. Oh wait, the formula for deep water is v = λ * f, where λ is the wavelength and f is the frequency. But wait, I also remember that in deep water, the speed doesn't depend on the depth anymore. So when the wave moves from shallow to deep, the depth increases, so maybe the speed changes.

Wait, no, when moving from shallow to deep, the depth is increasing. So in shallow water, the wave speed is sqrt(gh), and when it's deep, the speed is (gλ)/(2π), or something like that. Or wait, another way I remember is that in deep water, the speed depends on the wavelength. So if the wave moves into deeper water, the depth becomes much larger than the wavelength, so the wave starts to behave as a deep-water wave.

Now, the question is about what changes: frequency, wavelength, speed. I know that when a wave moves from one medium to another, like from shallow to deep water, the frequency stays the same because the frequency is determined by the source. So the frequency shouldn't change. That rules out some options where frequency changes.

So looking at the options, options A, F, G, J have frequency that doesn't change or stays the same. Let me look again. The question is, when moving from shallow to deep water, what happens?

In shallow water, the wave speed is v = sqrt(gh). In deep water, v = (λ f) because for deep water, the wave speed is proportional to the wavelength. Wait, but wait, the relationship between speed, wavelength, and frequency is v = λ f. So if frequency is constant, then if the speed changes, the wavelength must change.

Wait, when moving to deeper water, the depth is larger, so for the wave, the speed in deep water is determined by v = (gλ)/(2π), which is sqrt(gλ/(2π)) * something. Or perhaps I should think about it this way: when the wave enters deep water, it's now a deep-water wave where the speed is determined by the wavelength. But if the frequency is the same as before, then if the wave speed changes, the wavelength would have to change because v = λ f. Since f is same, if v changes, λ changes.

Wait, in shallow water, the wave's speed was slower. So when it moves into deep water, the speed increases. Because when the depth increases, the wave is no longer in shallow conditions. So, the speed increases. If the speed increases and frequency is the same, then the wavelength must increase because λ = v/f. So if v increases and f is same, λ increases.

So putting that together: frequency doesn't change, wavelength increases, speed increases. So looking at the options, option A says exactly that: frequency does not change, wavelength increases, speed increases.

Let me double-check. When waves move into deeper water, do they speed up? I think so, because in the ocean, waves move faster in deeper water. So yes, speed increases. And since frequency is same, wavelength must increase.

So the correct answer should be option A.

When a wave moves from shallow water to deep water, its behavior changes due to the relationship between wave speed, wavelength, and frequency. In shallow water, the wave speed is given by \( v = \sqrt{gh} \), where \( h \) is the water depth. As the wave moves into deeper water, the depth becomes much larger than the wavelength, and the wave transitions to a deep-water wave. In deep water, the wave speed is determined by the wavelength and frequency, \( v = \lambda f \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( f \) is the frequency.

The frequency of the wave remains constant as it moves from shallow to deep water because it is determined by the source of the wave. Since the speed increases in deeper water and the frequency remains unchanged, the wavelength must also increase, as \( \lambda = v / f \).

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is the one where the frequency does not change, the wavelength increases, and the speed increases. This corresponds to **Option A**.
