Okay, so I've got this problem here about buying a motorcycle, and I need to figure out the finance charge and the percentage by which the installment price exceeds the cash price. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the motorcycle has a cash price of $275. That's the amount you'd pay if you bought it outright, no financing involved. But the question is about an installment plan, which means you're paying over time, and there's probably some interest or finance charge involved.

The installment plan terms are 10% down and then $18.20 per month for 18 months. So I think the first thing I need to do is calculate the total amount paid under the installment plan. Then, compare that to the cash price to find the finance charge and the percentage increase.

Let me jot down the numbers:

- Cash price: $275
- Down payment: 10% of $275
- Monthly payment: $18.20
- Number of payments: 18 months

Wait, the down payment is 10% of the cash price. So 10% of 275 is 0.10 * 275 = $27.50. That's the amount paid upfront.

Then, each month for 18 months, the buyer pays $18.20. So the total for the monthly payments would be 18 * 18.20. Let me calculate that: 18 * 18 is 324, and 18 * 0.20 is 3.60, so total is 324 + 3.60 = $327.60.

So the total amount paid under the installment plan is the down payment plus the total of the monthly payments. That's 27.50 + 327.60 = $355.10.

Wait wait, let me double-check that calculation. 18 * 18.20. Hmm, 10 payments would be 182, and 8 more would be 18.20 *8. Let me compute 18 *18.20.

18 * 18 = 324. 18 * 0.20 = 3.6. So yes, 324 +3.6 = 327.6. Then add the down payment: 275 *0.10 =27.5. 27.5 + 327.6 = 355.1. So the total installment price is $355.10.

Now, the cash price is $275. So the finance charge is the difference between the installment price and the cash price. That would be 355.10 - 275 = $80.10. So the finance charge is $80.10. Hmm, looking at the options, that matches option J's first number, which is $80.10.

But I also need to find the percentage by which the installment price exceeds the cash price. So that's the finance charge divided by the cash price, times 100 to get the percentage.

So the percentage is (80.10 / 275) * 100. Let's calculate that. 

First, 80.10 divided by 275. Let me compute that. 275 * 0.3 is 82.5, which is a bit higher than 80.1. So let's see: 275 * 0.29 = let's see, 275 * 0.3 is 82.5, so 0.29 is 82.5 - 0.275*1 = 82.5 - 2.75 = 79.75. So 0.29 *275=79.75.

Our finance charge is 80.10, which is 0.35 more than 79.75. So, 80.10 / 275 = (79.75 +0.35)/275 = 0.29 + (0.35/275).

Wait, maybe a better way to compute 80.10 /275.

Let me do it step by step. 80.10 ÷ 275.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 16.02 /55.

55 goes into 160 two times (2*55=110), subtract 110 from 160: 50. Bring down the 2: 502.

55 into 502: 9 times 55 is 495. So 9, remainder 7. Bring down a zero: 70.

55 into 70 once (55), remainder 15. Next digit is 1, bring down zero: 150.

55 into 150 is 2 times (110), remainder 40. Bring down a zero: 400.

55 into 400 is 7 times (385), remainder 15. Hmm, this seems to be repeating.

So 16.02 /55 = 0.29109 approximately. So 0.29109 *100 =29.109%. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 29.1%.

So the percentage is 29.1%. Looking at the options, option J says $80.10 and 29.1%, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the total installment cost. Down payment is $27.5, 18 months at $18.20 is 18 *18.20=327.6. 27.5 +327.6=355.1. Cash price is 275. So 355.1-275=80.1. So that's correct.

The percentage is 80.1/275 *100. Let me compute 80.1/275. Maybe another approach: 275 is 11*25, but not sure. Alternatively, 275 * 0.29 is 79.75, as before. 79.75 + 0.35=80.10. So 0.29 + (0.35/275) = 0.29 + 0.00127≈ 0.29127, so 29.127%, which rounds to 29.1%.

So the correct answer is J: $80.10, 29.1%.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the total amount paid under the installment plan. The motorcycle has a cash price of $275, and the installment plan requires a 10% down payment and 18 monthly payments of $18.20 each.

1. **Down Payment**:  
   The down payment is 10% of the cash price:  
   \[
   \text{Down Payment} = 0.10 \times 275 = 27.50
   \]

2. **Total Monthly Payments**:  
   The total amount paid in monthly payments is:  
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Payments} = 18 \times 18.20 = 327.60
   \]

3. **Total Installment Price**:  
   The total amount paid under the installment plan is the sum of the down payment and the total monthly payments:  
   \[
   \text{Total Installment Price} = 27.50 + 327.60 = 355.10
   \]

4. **Finance Charge**:  
   The finance charge is the difference between the total installment price and the cash price:  
   \[
   \text{Finance Charge} = 355.10 - 275 = 80.10
   \]

5. **Percentage by Which Installment Price Exceeds Cash Price**:  
   To find the percentage, we divide the finance charge by the cash price and multiply by 100:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{80.10}{275} \right) \times 100 \approx 29.1\%
   \]

Thus, the finance charge is $80.10, and the installment price exceeds the cash price by approximately 29.1%. Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: $80.10, 29.1%**
