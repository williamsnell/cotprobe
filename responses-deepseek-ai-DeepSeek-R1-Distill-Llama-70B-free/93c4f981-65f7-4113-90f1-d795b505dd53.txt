Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the percentage difference between ln(1+x) and x when x is 0.0050. Hmm, I remember that for small values of x, ln(1+x) is approximately equal to x, but they're not exactly the same. The question is asking about the percentage difference between them.

Alright, let me think about how to approach this. I think the percentage difference is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the two values, dividing by the average of the two, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. So the formula would be something like:

Percentage Difference = |(ln(1+x) - x)| / ((ln(1+x) + x)/2) * 100%

Wait, but wait. Or is there another way? Sometimes, percentage difference can be calculated differently, like (approximate - exact)/exact * 100%. But I'm not sure which method applies here. Oh, right, in this case, since we're comparing two quantities, the percentage difference formula I mentioned first is correct.

But wait, maybe another approach. Since x is small, perhaps a series expansion would help. I remember that ln(1+x) can be expanded as a Taylor series around x=0. The expansion is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... So for small x, the higher-order terms become negligible.

So for x=0.005, which is 0.5% (since 0.005 is 0.5% of 1), the x squared term is (0.005)^2 = 0.000025. So the first term in the expansion is x, which is 0.005, and the second term is -x²/2 = -0.0000125. So ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2.

So substituting x=0.005, ln(1.005) ≈ 0.005 - 0.0000125 = 0.0049875.

Now, the actual value of x is 0.005. So the difference between ln(1+x) and x is approximately 0.0049875 - 0.005 = -0.0000125. The absolute value is 0.0000125.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should calculate both values accurately. Let me compute ln(1.005) using a calculator. Since I don't have a calculator here, I can use the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the percentage difference as (ln(1+x) - x) / x * 100%, but no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, that would be the percentage error if x is the approximate value and ln(1+x) is the exact. Hmm, but the question is about the percentage difference between the two, not relative error.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the relative difference between ln(1+x) and x, using x as the reference. So the formula could be (ln(1+x) - x)/x * 100%. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, let me clarify. The percentage difference can be a bit ambiguous depending on context. But in this case, since the question is about the percentage difference between the two, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the absolute difference divided by the average of the two, as I first thought.

Alternatively, maybe it's more standard to compute (ln(1+x) - x) / x * 100% as the percentage difference, treating x as the base. Let me think: for small x, ln(1+x) is approx x, but a little less. So the percentage difference would be small.

So let's compute both approaches.

First, compute ln(1.005). Let me calculate it accurately. I know that ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4...

So for x=0.005:

ln(1.005) = 0.005 - (0.005)^2 / 2 + (0.005)^3 / 3 - (0.005)^4 /4 + ...

Calculate each term:

First term: 0.005.

Second term: (0.005)^2 = 0.000025; divided by 2 is 0.0000125. So subtract 0.0000125.

Third term: (0.005)^3 = 0.000000125; divided by 3 is approximately 0.0000000416667. So add that.

Fourth term: (0.005)^4 = 0.000000000625; divided by 4 is 0.00000000015625. Subtract that.

So adding up:

0.005 = 0.0050000000

Subtract 0.0000125 → 0.0049875

Add 0.0000000416667 → ~0.0049875416667

Subtract 0.00000000015625 → ~0.0049875415104.

So ln(1.005) ≈ 0.0049875415.

Now, x is 0.005.

So the difference between ln(1+x) and x is 0.0049875415 - 0.005 = -0.0000124585.

The absolute difference is 0.0000124585.

Now, to compute the percentage difference. Let's consider both possibilities.

Option 1: Average of the two values.

Average = (ln(1+x) + x)/2 = (0.0049875415 + 0.005)/2 = (0.0099875415)/2 = 0.00499377075.

Percentage difference = (0.0000124585 / 0.00499377075) * 100%.

Compute that:

0.0000124585 / 0.00499377075 ≈ 0.0000124585 / 0.00499377075 ≈ 0.002494 approximately.

Multiply by 100% gives about 0.2494%.

So that's about 0.249% difference.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.249%.

Option 2: If I compute (ln(1+x) - x) / x * 100%, that would be (-0.0000124585 / 0.005) *100% ≈ (-0.0024917)*100% ≈ -0.24917%. The absolute value is about 0.249%, same as before.

So either way, the percentage difference is approximately 0.249%.

Looking back at the options, option J is 0.249%.

Another way to think: the percentage difference is roughly (x²/2)/x *100% = x/2 *100% = 0.005/2 *100% = 0.25%. So that's 0.25%, which matches our earlier calculation of approximately 0.249%.

So the correct answer should be option J: 0.249%.

To calculate the percentage difference between $\ln(1+x)$ and $x$ for $x=0.0050$, we start by approximating $\ln(1+x)$ using its Taylor series expansion around $x=0$: 

\[
\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \dots
\]

For small $x$, higher-order terms become negligible. Substituting $x=0.005$:

\[
\ln(1+0.005) \approx 0.005 - \frac{(0.005)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.005)^3}{3} - \frac{(0.005)^4}{4}
\]

Calculating each term:

- First term: $0.005$
- Second term: $\frac{(0.005)^2}{2} = \frac{0.000025}{2} = 0.0000125$
- Third term: $\frac{(0.005)^3}{3} = \frac{0.000000125}{3} \approx 0.0000000416667$
- Fourth term: $\frac{(0.005)^4}{4} = \frac{0.000000000625}{4} \approx 0.00000000015625$

Adding these terms:

\[
\ln(1.005) \approx 0.005 - 0.0000125 + 0.0000000416667 - 0.00000000015625 \approx 0.0049875415
\]

The value of $x$ is $0.005$. The absolute difference between $\ln(1+x)$ and $x$ is:

\[
\text{Difference} = |0.0049875415 - 0.005| = 0.0000124585
\]

To calculate the percentage difference, we divide the absolute difference by the average of the two values:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\ln(1+x) + x}{2} = \frac{0.0049875415 + 0.005}{2} = 0.00499377075
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Difference} = \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Average}} \times 100 = \frac{0.0000124585}{0.00499377075} \times 100 \approx 0.249\%
\]

This matches the approximation using the leading term of the series expansion, where the percentage difference is approximately:

\[
\frac{x^2/2}{x} \times 100 = \frac{x}{2} \times 100 = \frac{0.005}{2} \times 100 = 0.25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage difference is approximately **0.249%**, which corresponds to option **J**.
