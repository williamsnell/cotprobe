Okay, so I have this question about atmospheric carbon sources. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that carbon cycles through the atmosphere, oceans, plants, and animals. Let me think about each option.

Option A is Respiration. I know that when humans and animals breathe, we exhale carbon dioxide. Plants also respire, especially at night when they're not photosynthesizing. So respiration definitely releases CO2 into the atmosphere. So A is a source.

Option B is Photosynthesis. Wait, photosynthesis is when plants take in CO2 from the atmosphere to make glucose. So that's actually removing carbon from the atmosphere, not adding it. So B might be the answer because it's not a source.

Option C is Bacterial decomposition. Bacteria break down dead organic matter, and in the process, they release CO2. Like when leaves rot or food decomposes in a landfill. So that's adding carbon to the atmosphere. So C is a source.

Option D is Combustion of fossil fuels. Burning coal, oil, and gas releases a lot of CO2. This is a major human activity contributing to atmospheric carbon. So D is definitely a source.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a source. So looking back, the options are A, B, C, D. A, C, D are all sources. B is a sink because it absorbs CO2. So the correct answer should be B.

The question asks which option is NOT a source of atmospheric carbon. 

- **A: Respiration** releases carbon dioxide (CO₂) into the atmosphere through the breathing of organisms, making it a source.  
- **B: Photosynthesis** removes CO₂ from the atmosphere as plants use it to produce glucose, making it a sink, not a source.  
- **C: Bacterial decomposition** releases CO₂ as bacteria break down organic matter, so it is a source.  
- **D: Combustion of fossil fuels** releases large amounts of CO₂, making it a significant source.  

Since photosynthesis removes carbon from the atmosphere rather than adding it, the correct answer is **B**.  

B
