E: 1 jiffy = 2.2 × 10^-10 sec
F: 1 jiffy = 6.6 × 10^-12 sec
G: 1 jiffy = 1.0 × 10^-10 sec
H: 1 jiffy = 5.0 × 10^-11 sec
I: 1 jiffy = 3.3 × 10^-10 sec
J: 1 jiffy = 3.3 × 10^-11 sec

Okay, so I need to figure out how many seconds correspond to one jiffy, which is defined as the time it takes light to travel 1 cm. Hmm, I remember that the speed of light is a really big number, so maybe I should start by writing down what I know.

The speed of light is given as 3.0 × 10^8 meters per second. Wait, but the distance here is in centimeters, not meters. Oh right, I need to convert that to meters because the speed is in meters per second. So 1 cm equals 0.01 meters because there are 100 cm in a meter. So 1 cm = 1e-2 meters.

Time is equal to distance divided by speed. So the formula should be time = distance / speed. The distance is 0.01 meters, and the speed is 3.0e8 m/s. Let me plug those numbers in.

So time = 0.01 m / (3.0e8 m/s). Let me compute that. 0.01 divided by 3e8. Well, 0.01 is the same as 1e-2. So 1e-2 divided by 3e8 is (1/3) * 1e-10, because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract them. So 1e-2 / 1e8 = 1e-10. Then multiply by 1/3.

Wait, let me do the math more carefully. 1e-2 divided by 3e8 equals (1e-2) / (3e8) = (1/3) * 1e-10 = approximately 3.333...e-11 seconds. Wait, because 1/(3e8) is (1/3)*1e-8, but wait no, wait 1e-2 divided by 1e8 is 1e-10, so 1e-2 / 3e8 is 1/(3) * 1e-10. Which is 3.333e-11? Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck the exponents.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it numerically. Let's see:

0.01 meters divided by 3e8 m/s.

0.01 / 3e8 = (0.01) / (300,000,000) seconds.

0.01 is 1e-2, so 1e-2 / 3e8 = (1 / 3) * 1e-10, which is (0.333...)e-10, which is 3.333e-11 seconds.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any option with 3.3e-11. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 3.3e-12

B:4.5e-9

C:3.3e-9

D:7.5e-11

E:2.2e-10

F:6.6e-12

G:1.0e-10

H:5.0e-11

I:3.3e-10

J:3.3e-11

Oh wait, option J is 3.3e-11. So that's what I got. So the answer should be J.

Wait, did I do the calculation right? Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake with the exponents.

Another approach: 1 cm is 0.01 m. Speed of light is 3e8 m/s.

Time is 0.01 / 3e8.

0.01 is 1e-2. 3e8 is 3 * 1e8.

So (1e-2) / (3e8) = (1 / 3) * (1e-2 / 1e8) = (1/3) * 1e-10.

1e-10 divided by 3 is approximately 3.333e-11 seconds. So yes, that's 3.3e-11, which matches option J.

So the correct answer should be J.

To determine how many seconds correspond to one jiffy, we start by noting that a jiffy is defined as the time it takes light to travel 1 cm. The speed of light is given as \( 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and the distance of 1 cm must be converted to meters:  
\[
1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} = 1 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{m}.
\]

The formula for time is:  
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}.
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-2}}{3.0 \times 10^8} = \frac{1}{3} \times 10^{-10} \, \text{s}.
\]

Simplifying further:  
\[
\text{Time} \approx 3.333 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}.
\]

This matches the value \( 3.3 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s} \), which corresponds to option J.
