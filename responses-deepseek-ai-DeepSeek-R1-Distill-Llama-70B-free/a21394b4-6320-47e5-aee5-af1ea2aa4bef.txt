Okay, so I've got this problem here about labeled graphs and their scores. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is asking how many labeled graphs have a score of (6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2). Wait, what's a score in this context? Oh right, I remember that the score of a graph is a sequence where each element represents the number of edges incident to a vertex. So this score has seven elements: the first is 6 and the rest are 2s. That means the graph has seven vertices, one with degree 6 and six vertices each with degree 2.

Wait a second, the Handshaking Lemma says that the sum of degrees must be even because each edge contributes to two vertices. Let's check: 6 + (2*6) = 6 + 12 = 18, which is even. Okay, that's good; otherwise, it wouldn't be possible.

Now, I remember that the number of labeled graphs with a given degree sequence is given by something called the configuration model or maybe using multinomial coefficients. Oh wait, it's related to counting the number of ways to pair the edges. But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

So each vertex has a certain number of "stubs" or points where edges can attach. The vertex with degree 6 has 6 stubs, and each of the six others has 2 stubs each. So in total, the stubs are 6 + (6*2) = 18, which makes sense because 18 edges (since each edge connects two stubs, so 18/2=9 edges in total).

The number of ways to pair these stubs would be (18-1)!! because each pairing is a way to form edges. Wait, no, I think it's (18)! divided by (2^9 * 9!) because you're matching each pair without considering order. Oh right, the formula for the number of ways to pair 2n points is (2n)! ) / (2^n n! ). So here, n is 9 because 18 stubs make 9 edges.

But wait, that's the total number of ways without considering the labels. Oh no, because the vertices are labeled, so each distinct pairing corresponds to a different labeled graph. But wait, I think I need to adjust for overcounting because some pairings might lead to the same graph when considering automorphisms. Or maybe not, because the labels are fixed, so each distinct set of edges is unique.

So the formula for the number of labeled graphs with a given degree sequence is ( (sum d_i)! ) / ( product (d_i! ) ) ) divided by 2^(m) m! where m is the number of edges. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the number is given by the multinomial coefficient. So the total number of ways is (18)! / ( (6!)(2!^6) ) ) / ( 2^9 * 9! )? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down.

Each vertex's stubs are being connected. The first vertex has 6 stubs, and the others have 2 each. The process is to pair all stubs. The total number of ways to do this is (18)! / ( (6!)(2!^6) ) ) divided by something? Or wait, perhaps it's (18)! divided by (2^9 * 9! ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The number of ways to create a graph with the given degree sequence is ( (sum d_i)! ) / ( product (d_i! ) ) ) multiplied by something. Or maybe the number of labeled graphs is calculated using the configuration model, which counts the number of ways to assign edges as ( (sum d_i) choose d1, d2, ..., dn ) ) divided by the product of the factorials of the degrees, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, I found a formula before that the number of labeled graphs is equal to ( (sum d_i)! ) / ( product (d_i! ) ) ) times (1/(product (k! ) )) where k is the number of edges between each pair, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that the number of labeled graphs with degree sequence d1, d2, ..., dn is given by (n-1 choose d1, d2, ..., dn) but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of pairing. The problem is to count the number of perfect matchings in a multiset of stubs. The formula for this is ( (sum d_i)! ) / ( product (d_i! ) ) ) divided by 2^{m} m! where m is the number of edges.

Wait, let me check: sum d_i is 18, and m is 9. So the number would be (18! ) / (6! * (2!)^6 ) ) divided by (2^9 * 9! ). Let me compute that.

Wait, let's compute the denominator first. 6! is 720, (2!^6) is (2^6)=64. So denominator is 720 * 64 = 46080.

Then, 18! is a huge number, but let's see if there's a simplification. The numerator is 18! and the denominator is 6! * 2^6 * 2^9 * 9! So 2^6 * 2^9 is 2^15=32768.

So overall, the denominator is 720 * 32768 * 362880 (since 9! is 362880). Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ( (sum d_i)! ) / ( product (d_i! ) * product (k_i! ) ) ), but I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is ( (sum d_i) choose d1, d2, ..., dn ) ) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's (sum d_i)! / (product (d_i! )) ) times 1/(2^m m! ), where m is the number of edges.

Wait, let's try that. So sum d_i is 18, m=9. So 18! / (6! * (2!)^6 ) * (1/(2^9 *9! )).

Let me compute the denominator: 6! is 720, (2!^6) is 64, 2^9 is 512, 9! is 362880.

So denominator is 720 * 64 * 512 * 362880. That's a huge number. The numerator is 18! which is approximately 6.4e15, but the denominator is way bigger, so the result must be a manageable number.

Wait, maybe I can compute this step by step. Let me write the formula as:

Number of graphs = (18)! / (6! * (2!)^6 * 2^9 * 9! )

So 18! / (6! * 64 * 512 * 362880 )

Wait, 6! is 720, 64 is 2^6, 512 is 2^9, and 362880 is 9!.

Wait, 720 * 362880 = let's compute that. 720 * 362880 = ?

Wait 720 * 362880 = 720 * 362880 = let me compute 720 * 362880. 362880 * 700 = 254,016,000; 362880 * 20 = 7,257,600. Total is 254,016,000 +7,257,600 = 261,273,600.

So 720 * 362880 = 261,273,600.

Then, 261,273,600 * 512 = let's compute that. 261,273,600 * 500 = 130,636,800,000. 261,273,600 *12=3,135,283,200. So total is 133,772,083,200.

Now, multiply by 64? Wait no, wait. Because denominator is 720 * 64 * 512 * 362880. Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator as (720 * 362880) * (64 * 512) first.

720 * 362880 = 261,273,600 as before.

64 *512 = 32,768.

So 261,273,600 * 32,768 = let's compute that. Hmm, that's a big number.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute this as 18! / (6! * (2^6) * (2^9) * 9! )

Which can be written as 18! / (6! * 2^{15} * 9! )

So 2^15 = 32768.

So denominator is 720 * 32768 * 362880.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Let's compute this step by step.

But maybe using factorials and simplifying.

Wait, 18! is 6402373705728000.

Denominator: 6! =720; 2^15=32768; 9! =362880.

So denominator = 720 * 32768 * 362880.

Compute 720 * 362880 first. As before, that's 261273600.

Then multiply by 32768: 261273600 * 32768.

Let me compute that:

261,273,600 * 32,768.

Hmm, perhaps approximate, but I'm trying to find 261,273,600 * 32,768.

Wait, 261,273,600 * 32,768 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps compute 261,273,600 * 32768 = ?

Let me try breaking it down:

32768 = 32000 + 768.

261,273,600 * 32000 = 261,273,600 * 3.2e4 = ?

261,273,600 * 3e4 = 7,838,208,000,000.

261,273,600 * 2e4 = 5,225,472,000,000. Wait, wait, 32000 is 3.2e4, so 261,273,600 *3.2e4 = (261,273,600 *3e4) + (261,273,600 * 0.2e4) )

Wait, 261,273,600 *3e4 = 261,273,600 *30,000 = 7,838,208,000,000.

261,273,600 *2e3 (since 0.2e4 is 2000) = 261,273,600 *2,000 = 522,547,200,000.

So 7,838,208,000,000 + 522,547,200,000 = 8,360,755,200,000.

Now, 261,273,600 *768 = ?

Let me compute 261,273,600 *700 = 183,091,520,000.

261,273,600 *60 = 15,676,416,000.

261,273,600 *8 = 2,090,188,800.

Adding these together: 183,091,520,000 +15,676,416,000 = 198,767,936,000 + 2,090,188,800 = 200,858,124,800.

So total denominator is 8,360,755,200,000 + 200,858,124,800 = 8,561,613,324,800.

Now, the numerator is 18! = 6,402,373,705,728,000.

So number of graphs is 6,402,373,705,728,000 / 8,561,613,324,800.

Let me compute that division.

First, let me see how many times 8.5616133248e12 fits into 6.402373705728e15.

So 6.402373705728e15 / 8.5616133248e12 = (6.402373705728 / 8.5616133248) ) * 1e3.

Because 1e15/1e12 = 1e3.

Compute 6.402373705728 / 8.5616133248 ≈ 0.747 * 1e3 = 747.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

8.5616133248e12 goes into 6.402373705728e15 how many times?

Compute 6.402373705728e15 / 8.5616133248e12 = (6.402373705728 /8.5616133248 ) * 1e3.

6.402373705728 ÷ 8.5616133248 ≈ 0.747.

So 0.747 * 1e3 ≈ 747.

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's exactly 750? Or maybe a specific integer.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as exact division.

Wait, 18! is 6402373705728000.

Denominator is 720 * 32768 * 362880 = let's compute that.

Wait, 720 = 6! = 720.

32768 = 2^15.

362880 = 9! = 362880.

So 720 * 362880 = 720 * 362880.

Earlier, I computed that as 261273600.

261273600 * 32768 = ?

Wait, 261273600 * 32768 = let me compute this as 261273600 *32768.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 261273600 *32768 = 261273600 * (32000 + 768).

As I did before, that's 8,360,755,200,000 +200,858,124,800 = 8,561,613,324,800.

So denominator is 8,561,613,324,800.

So 18! is 6,402,373,705,728,000.

Divide 6,402,373,705,728,000 by 8,561,613,324,800.

So 6,402,373,705,728,000 ÷ 8,561,613,324,800 = ?

Let me compute how many times 8,561,613,324,800 fits into 6,402,373,705,728,000.

Compute 8,561,613,324,800 * 747 = ?

Well, 8,561,613,324,800 * 700 = 5,993,129,027,360,000.

8,561,613,324,800 *40 = 342,464,532,992,000.

8,561,613,324,800 *7 = 59,931,293,273,600.

Adding these together: 5,993,129,027,360,000 + 342,464,532,992,000 = 6,335,593,560,352,000.

Plus 59,931,293,273,600 gives 6,395,524,853,625,600.

Which is less than 6,402,373,705,728,000.

The difference is 6,402,373,705,728,000 -6,395,524,853,625,600 = 6,848,852,102,400.

Now, 8,561,613,324,800 * 0.8 = 6,849,090,659,840.

That's very close to the remaining 6,848,852,102,400.

So approximately 747.8 times.

But since the number of graphs must be an integer, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the number of labeled graphs with a given degree sequence, which is:

Number of graphs = (sum d_i)! / ( product (d_i! ) ) * (1 / (2^{m} m! )) )

Wait, but sum d_i is 18, so 18! / (6! * (2!)^6 ) * (1/(2^9 *9! )) )

Wait, so 18! / (6! * (2^6) ) / (2^9 *9! )

Which is 18! / (6! * 2^{15} *9! )

So 18! = 6402373705728000.

Denominator: 6! =720, 2^15=32768, 9! =362880.

So denominator is 720 *32768 *362880 = let's compute that again.

720 * 362880 = 261273600.

261273600 *32768 = ?

Let me compute 261273600 *32768:

261,273,600 * 32,768.

Hmm, perhaps I can write 32,768 as 2^15, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 261273600 *32768 = ?

Wait, 261,273,600 * 32,768 = 261,273,600 * (30,000 + 2,768) = ?

261,273,600 *30,000 = 7,838,208,000,000.

261,273,600 *2,768 = ?

Compute 261,273,600 *2,000 = 522,547,200,000.

261,273,600 *700 = 183,091,520,000.

261,273,600 *68 = let's compute 261,273,600 *60=15,676,416,000; 261,273,600 *8=2,090,188,800. So 15,676,416,000 +2,090,188,800 =17,766,604,800.

So 522,547,200,000 +183,091,520,000 =705,638,720,000 +17,766,604,800=723,405,324,800.

So total 7,838,208,000,000 +723,405,324,800=8,561,613,324,800.

So denominator is 8,561,613,324,800.

Now, 18! is 6,402,373,705,728,000.

So 6,402,373,705,728,000 divided by 8,561,613,324,800 equals approximately 747.8.

But that's a fractional number, which doesn't make sense because the number of graphs must be an integer.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I forgot to account for something. Alternatively, perhaps
