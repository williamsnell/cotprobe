Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about the heat capacity of gases and determining the structure of a molecule based on that information. Hmm, I remember that heat capacity relates to the degrees of freedom of the molecules, which is connected to the equipartition theorem.

The problem states that at 0°C, the vibrational contribution to Cp is negligible. Oh right, at low temperatures like 0°C, vibrational modes don't contribute much to the heat capacity because they aren't excited. So we only consider translational and rotational contributions.

We're comparing two gases: gas X and N2(g). It says that the Cp for X(g) and N2(g) are the same. Wait, but wait. Oh no, I think I misread that. Let me check again. Oh, no, the problem says that Cp for X(g) equals Cp for N2(g). But then it also says that the equipartition value of Cp for X minus that for N2 is 6 cal/(deg·mol). Hmm, maybe I need to think about this more carefully.

So, let's recall the formula for molar heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) using the equipartition theorem. For an ideal gas, Cp is calculated based on the degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom include translational, rotational, and vibrational modes, but since vibrational is negligible here, we can ignore that.

For a monoatomic gas, there are 3 translational degrees of freedom. So, Cp for monoatomic is (5/2)R, because each translational contributes (1/2)R and there are three of them, but wait, no—wait, the general formula is Cp = (γ) * (f/2) * R, where γ is the heat capacity ratio, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think for each degree of freedom, you get (1/2)R per mole, and for Cp, it's (f/2 + 1) R? Wait, maybe I should get the exact expressions.

Wait no, the formula for Cp is ( (f/2) + 1 ) * R, where f is the number of degrees of freedom contributing. Wait, no, that's for Cv. Because for Cv, monoatomic is (3/2) R, diatomic (linear) is (5/2) R, and Cp is Cv + R. So, for Cp:

Monoatomic: Cv = (3/2) R → Cp = (5/2) R.

Diatomic (linear, like N2): at room temp, I think f is 5 (3 translational, 2 rotational). So Cv would be (5/2) R → Cp = (7/2) R.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the vibrational contributions are negligible, so for diatomic N2, Cp would be based on 5 degrees of freedom (3 trans, 2 rot), so Cp = (7/2) R. But wait, when vibrational modes are considered, but here they're negligible, so that's correct.

Wait, the problem says that the Cp for X(g) and N2(g) are the same. Wait, no, wait—no, the first statement says that the Cp for X and N2 are the same, but then the second part says that the equipartition value of Cp for X minus that for N2 is 6 cal/(deg·mol). Hmm, that seems contradictory. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the question says: "C_P for X(g) and for N2(g) is the same." But then, "the equipartition value of C_P for X(g) minus the equipartition values of C_P for N2(g) = 6 cal/deg-mole." Wait, that's confusing. How can they be the same but their equipartition values differ?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh, maybe the first part is saying that when vibrational contributions are negligible, their Cp values are the same. But when considering the equipartition values (which includes vibrational?), the difference is 6 cal/(deg·mol). Or maybe I've got that wrong.

Wait, no. Let me parse the question again. It says: "At 0°C, the vibrational contribution to C_P is negligible. Then, C_P for X(g) and for N2(g) is the same." So, under these conditions (negligible vibrational), C_P for X and N2 are the same. But when considering the equipartition values (which would include vibrational contributions), the difference is 6 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, but wait. The equipartition theorem gives the maximum possible contribution from each active mode. So, the equipartition value would be the theoretical maximum, including all modes. So, when the problem says the equipartition value of Cp for X minus that of N2 is 6 cal/(deg·mol), that would mean that X has more degrees of freedom than N2 in the equipartition sense.

Wait, but if at 0°C, vibrational modes are 'frozen out', so their contributions are negligible. So, the C_P measured (without vibrational) for X and N2 are the same. But when considering the full equipartition (including vibrational), X has a higher Cp than N2 by 6 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, but let me get the numbers right. Let's compute the Cp for N2 when vibrational is considered. N2 is a diatomic, linear molecule. So without vibrational, its degrees of freedom are 3 translational and 2 rotational, total of 5. So, its Cv would be (5/2) R, so Cp = Cv + R = (7/2) R. But when including vibrational, each vibrational mode contributes 2 (since each vibrational mode has a potential and kinetic component). But wait, for diatomic molecules, there's only one vibrational mode (along the bond axis). So including vibrational adds 2 degrees of freedom. So, for N2, when vibrational is active, the total degrees of freedom would be 5 + 2 =7. So Cv would be (7/2) R, so Cp would be (9/2) R.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, for a diatomic, the vibrational mode is two degrees of freedom. So without vibrational, degrees of freedom are 5 (3 trans, 2 rot), as you said. With vibrational, 7. So Cp would be (7/2 R) for Cv plus R, making Cp (9/2 R).

Wait, but the problem states that at 0°C, vibrational is negligible, so for N2, Cp is (7/2) R. But when we consider the equipartition values (including vibrational), N2's Cp would be (9/2) R. So, the equipartition Cp for N2 is (9/2) R.

Now, what about X? The problem says that when vibrational is neglected, the Cp for X and N2 are the same, which would imply that X also has the same number of translational and rotational degrees of freedom as N2 in that scenario. But when considering vibrational, X's Cp is higher than N2's by 6 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, no. The problem says that the equipartition value of Cp for X minus that for N2 is 6 cal/(deg·mol). So, Cp_X (equipartition) - Cp_N2 (equipartition) = 6 cal/(deg·mol).

So, we can write:

Cp_X = Cp_N2 +6 cal/(deg·mol).

But let's compute Cp for each in terms of R. R is approximately 2 cal/(deg·mol), right? Because 1 R is about 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is about 1.987 cal/(deg·mol). So, 1 R ≈ 2 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, let me confirm: 1 mole gas constant R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Since 1 cal = 4.184 J, R in cal is 8.314 /4.184 ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K). So approximately 2 cal/(mol·K).

So, using R ≈ 2 cal/(deg·mol), let's compute Cp for N2 when including vibrational. As I thought, Cp would be (9/2) R = 4.5 R. So, 4.5 * 2 =9 cal/(deg·mol).

So, if X's Cp (equipartition) is 6 cal/(deg·mol) higher than N2's, then X's Cp would be 9 +6 =15 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, no. Wait, no. The problem says Cp_X (equipartition) minus Cp_N2 (equipartition) equals 6 cal/(deg·mol). So,

Cp_X = Cp_N2 +6.

But Cp_N2 (with vibrational) is (9/2) R =4.5 *2=9 cal/(deg·mol). So, Cp_X would be 9 +6=15 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, but wait, 15 cal/(deg·mol) is 15/2 =7.5 R. Hmm, that seems high. Let's think about what kind of molecule would have a Cp of 15 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me re-express everything in terms of R.

So, Cp (equipartition) for N2 is (9/2) R. Therefore, Cp_X = (9/2 R) +6 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait no, because 6 cal/(deg·mol) is 6/(R) in terms of R, because R is 2 cal/(deg·mol). So 6 cal/(deg·mol) =3 R.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's express 6 cal/(deg·mol) in terms of R. Since R is approximately 2 cal/(deg·mol), 6 cal/(deg·mol) equals 3 R.

So, Cp_X (equipartition) = Cp_N2 (equipartition) +3 R.

Cp_N2 (with vibrational) is (9/2) R. So Cp_X is (9/2 +3) R = (15/2) R.

Wait, (9/2 +3)= (9/2 +6/2)=15/2 R.

Hmm, so Cp_X (equipartition) is 15/2 R, which is 7.5 R.

Wait, but what's the formula for Cp in terms of degrees of freedom?

Cv = (f/2) R → Cp = Cv + R = (f/2 +1) R.

So, for Cp_X to be (15/2) R, we have:

(15/2) R = (f_X /2 +1) R → 15/2 = f_X/2 +1 → 15/2 -2/2= f_X/2 → 13/2 =f_X/2 → f_X=13.

Wait, 13 degrees of freedom? That can't be right for a molecule. Because even a polyatomic with n atoms has 3n degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, vibrational). But wait, no, each molecule's total degrees of freedom are 3n, but when considering translational, rotational, and vibrational separately.

Wait, but for Cp, we consider all the active modes. Wait, but at equipartition, all modes are active. So for a molecule with n atoms, the total degrees of freedom are 3n.

Wait, but for a gas, the translational degrees are always 3. Rotational are 3 for nonlinear, 2 for linear. Vibrational are 3n-5 for linear, 3n-6 for nonlinear. But wait, in the equipartition sense, all these would contribute.

Wait, but for Cp, which includes translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions, the total degrees of freedom (f) would be 3 + rotational + vibrational.

Wait, perhaps for a linear molecule, rotational degrees are 2, vibrational are 3n-5.

So, for a linear molecule, total f =3 (trans) +2 (rot) + (3n-5) (vibr) = 3+2+3n-5= 3n.

Wait, that makes sense because total degrees of freedom are 3n, which includes translational, rotational, and vibrational.

Similarly, for a nonlinear molecule, rotational degrees are 3, vibrational are 3n-6. So f=3+3+(3n-6)=3n.

So, regardless of structure, the total degrees of freedom are 3n. So, for Cp, the equipartition value would be (f/2 +1) R.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. For each degree of freedom, you get (1/2) R for Cv. So, for f degrees of freedom, Cv = (f/2) R. Then, Cp = Cv + R = (f/2 +1) R.

So, if f=13, then Cp would be (13/2 +1) R = (15/2) R, which is 7.5 R, which is 15 cal/(deg·mol), as R is 2 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, so if X's Cp (equipartition) is 15 cal/(deg·mol), then f_X=13.

But wait, 3n = f → n= f/3. So, 13/3 is about 4.33, which isn't possible because the number of atoms must be an integer. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine the calculations.

Wait, the problem says that when vibrational is negligible, X and N2 have the same Cp.

So, when vibrational is ignored, for N2, which is diatomic and linear, it has 3 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom, so f=5.

So, Cv = (5/2) R → Cp = (7/2) R.

So, for X, when vibrational is ignored, it must also have 5 degrees of freedom contributing to Cp.

Wait, but wait. For a molecule, when vibrational is ignored, the degrees of freedom are 3 (translational) + rotational. So, for X, under these conditions, it must have 5 degrees of freedom as well, so 3 trans + 2 rot, which would imply a linear molecule, because linear molecules have 2 rotational degrees of freedom.

Wait, but if X is linear and diatomic, like N2, then why would the equipartition Cp differ?

Wait, perhaps X has more atoms. Let me think.

Wait, let's think about the situation when vibrational is ignored. For both X and N2, Cp is the same. So that implies that, without vibrational, X has the same number of degrees of freedom as N2. N2 has 5 (3 trans +2 rot). So X must have 5 as well. So, X would need to have 3 trans and 2 rot, meaning it's a linear molecule.

Wait, so X is a linear molecule with 2 rotational degrees. So, it's either diatomic linear or a linear triatomic, or linear with more atoms. Wait, but how?

Wait, no. Wait, for a linear molecule, the number of rotational degrees is 2, regardless of the number of atoms. So, for example, CO2 is linear triatomic, with 2 rotational degrees. So, if X is a linear molecule, whether diatomic, triatomic, etc., when vibrational is ignored, it will have 3 trans +2 rot =5 degrees, so f=5. Thus, Cp would be (5/2 +1) R = (7/2) R, same as N2.

So, that explains why, when vibrational is negligible, X and N2 have the same Cp.

Now, the difference comes in when considering the full equipartition, including vibrational. So, for X, when vibrational is considered, the Cp increases.

The problem states that Cp_X (equipartition) - Cp_N2 (equipartition) =6 cal/(deg·mol).

We know that Cp_N2 (with vibrational) is (9/2) R, which is 4.5 R or 9 cal/(deg·mol).

So, Cp_X (equipartition) = Cp_N2 (equipartition) +6 cal/(deg·mol) =9 +6=15 cal/(deg·mol).

But since R is 2 cal/(deg·mol), 15 cal/(deg·mol) is 7.5 R.

So, Cp_X = (f_X/2 +1) R =7.5 R.

Thus,

(f_X/2 +1) R =7.5 R → f_X/2 +1 =7.5 → f_X/2 =6.5 → f_X=13.

So, X has 13 degrees of freedom.

But wait, each molecule has 3n degrees of freedom in total (3n = translational + rotational + vibrational). So, 3n=13 → n=13/3≈4.33.

Wait, that's not possible, since n must be an integer. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the Cp values.

Wait, Cp for N2 when considering vibrational would be:

N2 is diatomic linear, so when vibrational is considered, it has 5 (3 trans +2 rot) + 2 vibrational (since diatomic has one vibrational mode, which counts as 2 degrees) → f=7.

So, Cp for N2 would be (7/2 +1) R? Wait, no. Wait, Cp is (f/2 +1) R?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Cv is (f/2) R, so Cp is Cv + R = (f/2) R + R = (f/2 +1) R.

So, for N2 with f=7, Cp = (7/2 +1) R = (9/2) R, which is 4.5 R.

Which in cal/(deg·mol) is 4.5 *2=9 cal/(deg·mol), as I thought earlier.

So, for X, Cp is 15 cal/(deg·mol), which is 7.5 R.

So, 7.5 R = (f_X/2 +1) R → f_X/2 +1 =7.5 → f_X/2=6.5 → f_X=13.

So, 3n=13 →n≈4.333. But n
