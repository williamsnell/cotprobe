Okay, so I have this problem about finding the 15's and 16's complement of some hexadecimal numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the 15's complement is like the one's complement but for 4-bit groups because hexadecimal digits are 4 bits each. So for each hex digit, you subtract it from 15 (which is F in hex) to get the 15's complement. Similarly, the 16's complement would be each digit subtracted from 16 (which is 10 in hex), but wait, no, actually, 16's complement is more like the two's complement but for hex. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the 15's complement is like inverting each bit in a 4-bit nibble. So for each hex digit, you calculate F minus that digit. For example, A is 1010 in binary, so its 15's complement is 0101, which is 5 in hex. So F minus A is 5. So for the 15's complement, each hex digit is replaced by F minus that digit.

The 16's complement is a bit trickier. I think for 16's complement, which is the one's complement plus one, but since we're dealing with hex digits, I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait. Maybe for each nibble, it's like the 16's complement is the 15's complement plus 1. So for each hex digit, 16's complement is (F - digit) + 1. But let me think about that again.

Wait, maybe I should handle each part separately. Let's go through each part.

The question gives four hexadecimal numbers: a) FFO, b) 1234, c) ABCD, d) 0000. For each, we need to find both the 15's and 16's complements.

Let's tackle part a) FFO.

FFO is a three-digit hex number. Let's break it down into nibbles: FF and 0.

Wait, or wait, wait—FF is two nibbles, each F. So FFO is 0xFF0, which is 12 bits. So each nibble is FF, F, 0.

Wait, but when computing the 15's complement, each nibble is subtracted from F. So let's compute each digit.

First, the 15's complement:

- F → F - F = 0
- F → 0 again
- 0 → F - 0 = F

So 15's complement of FFO is 00F.

Wait, but wait, the digits are FF and 0. Let me think: FF is two F's. So each F becomes 0, and the 0 becomes F. So the 15's complement is 00F.

Now the 16's complement. Hmm. Wait, 16's complement for a nibble is F - digit + 1? Let me think. Because 15's is F - digit, and 16's is F - digit +1. Because 15's is one's complement, 16's is two's complement.

So for each nibble, 16's complement is (F - digit) +1.

Wait, let's test with F:

F's 15's is 0, 16's is 0+1=1.

0's 15's is F, 16's is F+1=10 (which is 0 with a carryover). But wait, in hex, adding 1 to F (15) gives 10, which is 16 in decimal, but we're working per nibble, so that might cause a carry. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps 16's complement is calculated by subtracting the digit from F and then adding 1, but considering each nibble individually.

So for FFO:

Each nibble:

- F → 0 +1 =1
- F →1
- 0 → F (15) +1 = 16, which is 0 with a carryover. But since it's per nibble, perhaps it wraps around. Wait, maybe each nibble is treated as a 4-bit number, so when you add 1, 0 becomes 1, F (15) becomes 0, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it as for each hex digit, compute (F - digit) +1.

So for F:

(F - F) +1= 0+1=1.

For 0:

(F -0)+1= F+1= 0 (since F is 15, 15+1=16, which is 0x10, but for a nibble, it's 0 with a carryover, but since each nibble is independent, maybe it's 0, and the carry is ignored, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe 16's complement is calculated per nibble as (16 - digit), which would be 0 for F and 10 for 0.

Wait, 16 in hex is 0x10, so per nibble, 16 would be 0 with a carryover. So perhaps 16's complement is (0x10 - digit) for each nibble, but since each nibble is 4 bits, 16 is 0x10, so subtracting the digit from 0x10.

Wait, but 0x10 is 16 in decimal, so for a single nibble (4 bits), 16 would be 0x10, so for a nibble digit d, 16's complement is (16 - d) mod 16.

So for each nibble:

The 16's complement is (16 - d) in hex.

So for F (15): 16 -15=1 → 1.

For 0: 16-0=16 → 0x10, which is 0 in the nibble with a carryover, but in 4 bits, it's 0000, but the carryover might affect the next nibble, but when handling each nibble separately, perhaps it's treated as 0.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should just compute each digit's 15's and 16's complement.

Wait, the question says to find both the 15's and 16's complement for each number. But looking at the options, each option gives four parts, which I think correspond to the 15's complement of each of the four numbers. Or wait, perhaps the options list a) through d) with each being a certain value, but how do they map?

Wait, looking at the options, each option (A to J) has a through d, with values. So I think the question is to compute the 15's and 16's complements for each of the four numbers, and then see which option matches.

Wait, but the question says "Obtain the 15's and 16's complement of the following hexadecimal numbers," but the options only list four parts. So perhaps each option is the 15's complement of each number. Or perhaps each option lists the 15's and the 16's complements for each number, but it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the question. Oh, the question says "Obtain the 15's and 16's complement," but the options for each choice (A-J) have a) to d) with four values each. So maybe each option represents the 15's and 16's complement for each of the four numbers. But that would mean each part a, b, c, d in the options has two values, but the way the options are written, each option's a, b, etc., is a single value.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed step by step.

So for part a) FFO:

15's complement: each digit is replaced by F minus that digit.

Digits: F, F, 0.

So F → 0, F →0, 0→F.

So 15's complement is 00F.

16's complement would be 15's complement plus 1. But since we're dealing with nibbles, adding 1 to the entire 15's complement.

Wait, no: 16's complement is the two's complement, which is 15's complement plus 1.

So for FFO, 15's is 00F, adding 1 gives 0100? Wait, but 00F is three nibbles, adding 1 would make it 0100, which is four nibbles. But that doesn't make sense in the options. Hmm, perhaps I should consider each nibble's 16's complement individually.

Alternatively, perhaps 16's complement is computed as FFFF... +1 minus the number.

Wait, perhaps the 16's complement is the same as the two's complement in hex, which would be 16's complement = 15's complement +1.

So for FFO:

15's is 00F.

Adding 1: 00F + 1 = 010.

So 16's complement is 010.

But wait, 00F in hex is 0x00F, which is 15 in decimal. Adding 1 gives 16, which is 0x010. So the 16's complement of FFO is 010.

Wait, but FFO is 0xFFF0, which is 65520 in decimal. The 16's complement would be 0x10000 - 0xFFF0 = 0x10000 - 0xFFF0 = 0x10. So yes, 16's complement is 0x10, which is 010 in hex.

So for part a) FFO, 15's is 00F and 16's is 010.

Now looking at the options, each option's a) is the 15's complement of FFO, and perhaps the other parts are for the other numbers.

Looking at the options:

Option E: a) 00F, which matches our calculation for part a)'s 15's complement.

Option C: a) 00F as well.

Wait, so for part a) 15's complement is 00F, and 16's is 010.

Now moving to part b) 1234.

Let's compute 15's complement first.

Each digit:

1 → F -1 = E (14)
2 → F-2 = D (13)
3 → F-3 = C (12)
4 → F-4 = B (11)

So 15's complement is E D C B → EDCB.

Now 16's complement is 15's complement plus 1.

So EDCB + 1 = EDCC.

Wait, because adding 1 to B (11) gives C (12), so EDCB +1 = EDCC.

Wait, no. Let me think again: EDCB is the 15's complement. Adding 1 to this would be:

Start from the last digit:

B +1 = C.

So EDCB +1 = EDCC.

Wait, but wait, 15's complement is EDCB, so 16's complement is EDCB +1 = EDCC.

Wait, but let me confirm with the number 1234.

1234 in hex is 0x1234.

The 16's complement is 0x10000 - 0x1234 = 0xEDCC.

Yes, that's correct. So 16's complement is EDCC.

So part b)'s 15's is EDCB, 16's is EDCC.

Looking back at the options, let's see which option has a) 00F and b) EDCB or EDCC.

Option E: a) 00F, b) EDCB.

Option C: a) 00F, b) EDCD.

Hmm, so part b's 15's is EDCB, 16's is EDCC.

So which option for part b) would that match?

Looking at the options, for part a) 00F, so options C and E.

Option C's part b) is EDCD.

Option E's part b) is EDCB.

Wait, but we calculated part b)'s 15's complement as EDCB, and 16's as EDCC.

So in the options, if the options are providing the 15's complement for each part, then for part b), the 15's is EDCB, so looking at the options, option E's part b) is EDCB.

Now part c) ABCD.

15's complement: each digit is F - digit.

A → 10 in hex is 1010 in binary. F is 15, so 15-10=5 → 5.

B → 11 → 15-11=4 →4.

C →12 →15-12=3→3.

D→13→15-13=2→2.

So 15's complement is 5 4 3 2 → 5432.

16's complement is 5432 +1 =5433.

Wait, adding 1 to 5432: 2 +1=3, so 5433.

Alternatively, 16's complement is 0x10000 - 0xABCD = ?

0xABCD is 43981 in decimal.

0x10000 is 65536.

65536 -43981 = 21555.

21555 in hex is 0x5433.

Yes, that's correct.

So part c)'s 15's is 5432, 16's is 5433.

Looking at the options, for part c), option E's part c) is 5432.

Option C's part c) is 5432.

Wait, option C's part c) is 5432, and 16's would be 5433, but the options only show one value per part.

Wait, perhaps each option is giving the 15's complement for a), b), c), d), and 16's complement in another part of the option? Or perhaps the options list the 15's and 16's for each number together, but it's unclear.

Wait, the options for each choice (A-J) list a), b), c), d) as four separate values. So I think each of these is the 15's complement for each of the four numbers.

Wait, but looking at part d) 0000.

15's complement: each digit is F-0= F. So FFFF.

16's complement: FFFF +1 = 10000, which is 0x10000, but as a hex number, it's 5 digits. However, in 16 bits, 0000's 16's complement is 0000 +1 = 0001, but wait, no, 16's complement is two's complement, which for 0000 would be 0000, but adding 1 would give 0001.

Wait, let me think again. 0000 in hex is 0. The 15's complement is FFFF, and the 16's complement is FFFF +1 = 10000, which is beyond 4 nibbles. But in 4 nibbles, adding 1 to FFFF would cause a carryover, so it becomes 0000 with a carryover out, which we can ignore. So the 16's complement of 0000 is 0000 +1 = 0001?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach it differently.

The 16's complement of a number N is defined as (2^16 - N), assuming 16 bits (8 nibbles). But since our numbers are of varying lengths, perhaps each number is considered as a 4-nibble (16-bit) number.

So for 0000:

15's complement is FFFF.

16's complement is FFFF +1 = 10000, which is 5 nibbles, but if we're considering 4 nibbles, it would be 0000 with an overflow, but the correct 16's complement would be 10000. However, in the context of the options, perhaps it's represented as 0000.

Wait, no, perhaps for 4 nibbles (16 bits), 0000's 16's complement is 0000. Because 2^16 is 1 followed by sixteen zeros in binary, which is 0x10000. So 0x10000 - 0x0000 = 0x10000, which is a 5-nibble number. But in 4 nibbles, it's 0000.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the 16's complement is calculated as 0x10000 - N, so for 0000, it's 0x10000, which is 0000 0000 0000 0000 in 16 bits. But when represented as a hex number, it would be 0000.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 0x10000 is beyond 16 bits, so perhaps it's ignored, and the result is 0000.

Alternatively, perhaps the 16's complement is N = 0000 → 16's complement is 0001, but that doesn't fit with the formula 0x10000 - N.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's compute 16's complement for each part.

Part d) 0000.

15's complement: FFFF.

16's complement: FFFF +1 = 10000, which is 0000 with a carryover, but as the question is about hexadecimal representation, perhaps it's 0000.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think of each number as having a certain number of nibbles, and compute the 15's and 16's accordingly.

But perhaps I should proceed with what I have.

So, compiling the results:

a) FFO → 15's: 00F; 16's: 010.

b) 1234 → 15's: EDCB; 16's: EDCC.

c) ABCD → 15's:5432; 16's:5433.

d) 0000 →15's: FFFF; 16's: 0000 (since adding 1 to FFFF in 4 nibbles would overflow to 0000).

Wait, but FFFF +1 = 10000, which is 5 nibbles, but if we're considering only 4 nibbles, it wraps around to 0000.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach, but let's proceed.

Now, looking at the options, which option matches these results.

Looking at option E: a) 00F, b) EDCB, c)5432, d)FFFF.

So part a)'s 15's is 00F (matches), part b)'s 15's is EDCB (matches), part c)'s 15's is5432 (matches), part d)'s 15's is FFFF (matches).

But then what about the 16's complements? Because each option only lists one value per part, I'm assuming
