Question:

Congress has recently enacted a statute designed to prevent price gouging of gasoline by private retail sellers. To help administer the new statute Congress created a seven-member agency, four members of which were appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue "cease and desist" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who "intentionally engaged in price gouging. " In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency?

Options:

A: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to interpret regulations without the approval of the President.
B: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to issue fines.
C: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to imprison private citizens.
D: Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts.
E: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make "cease and desist" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.
F: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.
G: Congress may not create an agency to regulate private business practices.
H: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to regulate prices.
I: Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.
J: Congress may not delegate power to an agency without the approval of the Supreme Court.

Okay, so I have this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with Congress delegating power to an agency. I remember that there are certain limits on how Congress can delegate its authority. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is about an agency created by Congress to prevent price gouging of gasoline. The agency has seven members: four appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. It's authorized to issue rules interpreting existing regulations and issue "cease and desist" orders after hearings. Violations of these orders can lead to fines and/or imprisonment.

The question asks for the strongest constitutional argument against the agency's authority. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

First, I recall the non-delegation doctrine. Congress can delegate legislative power to agencies, but it must provide an intelligible principle to guide the agency's discretion. However, the Supreme Court has been pretty deferential, so that might not be the issue here unless the delegation is too broad.

Looking at the powers of the agency: they can issue rules interpreting regulations and enforce them with cease and desist orders. The problem might be with the enforcement powers. Specifically, the agency can impose fines and imprisonment. That sounds like a judicial or executive function.

Wait, the Constitution separates powers. The judiciary has the power to try cases and impose penalties. If an agency is imposing fines and imprisonment, that might be a problem because it's an administrative body exercising judicial power without proper checks.

I think about cases like United States v. Morgan and the Administrative Procedure Act, but the key case here might be one where the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot delegate judicial powers to an administrative agency without violating the separation of powers.

Another point is the appointment of the agency members. The President, Senate, and Speaker each appoint some. Usually, agencies are part of the executive branch, and their heads are appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. Here, Congress is appointing some members, which could raise issues about Congress delegating to itself or creating an unconstitutional agency structure.

Wait, but the question is about the delegation of authority, not the structure of the agency. So maybe the composition is a red herring. The main issue is the power to impose criminal penalties.

So, option E says Congress can't delegate power to make cease and desist orders punishable by imprisonment. Because that's a criminal penalty, which typically requires judicial process. Agencies can't impose criminal penalties without violating due process or separation of powers.

Alternatively, option C says Congress can't delegate power to imprison. That's similar to E. But E specifically ties it to the cease and desist orders. Which is stronger?

I think the key point is that administrative agencies can't impose criminal penalties without a court. So when the agency issues an order, and then enforces it with fines or imprisonment, that's usurping judicial authority.

Looking at the options again, option E says Congress may not delegate power to make "cease and desist" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment. That sounds right because it's essentially allowing the agency to act as a court, imposing penalties without judicial oversight.

Another angle is the delegation of rulemaking. But I think the bigger issue is the enforcement power. So the strongest argument is that Congress can't delegate the power to impose criminal penalties because that's a judicial function, not an executive or legislative one.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the delegation of legislative power. But the agency is issuing rules interpreting regulations, which is more of a quasi-legislative action, but that's usually permissible if guided by an intelligible principle.

So I think the best answer is E.

The strongest constitutional argument against the authority of the agency is that Congress may not delegate power to an administrative agency to issue "cease and desist" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment. This delegation improperly allows the agency to impose criminal penalties, which is a judicial function that cannot be exercised by an administrative body without violating the separation of powers. Administrative agencies are generally permitted to enforce civil penalties, but criminal penalties, such as fines and imprisonment, require judicial process and cannot be delegated to an agency. This makes Option E the most compelling argument.
