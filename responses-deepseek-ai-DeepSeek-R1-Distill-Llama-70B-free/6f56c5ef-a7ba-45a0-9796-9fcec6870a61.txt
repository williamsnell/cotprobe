Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state)."

Okay, so I have this question about the 1864 election, and I need to figure out which conclusion is best supported by the excerpt provided. Let me read through the information again and then look at each option one by one.

The excerpt says that Lincoln was reelected with 78% of the Union electorate voting. He won the Electoral College by a large margin, 212 to 21. His popular vote was 55%, which was the third highest in the 19th century. McClellan only won New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. The Republicans got support from native-born farmers, skilled workers, professionals, New Englanders, younger voters, and military. Democrats were strong in cities and among Irish and German immigrants, who were the largest immigrant groups. Lincoln got 78% of the Union soldiers' and sailors' votes, which wasn't necessary for his win but had symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress and took back state legislatures, only losing the New Jersey governorship.

Now, the question is about which conclusion is best supported. Let's go through the options.

Option A: Republicans gained control of Congress because Lincoln campaigned for them. The excerpt says Republicans gained seats and retained control, but it doesn't mention Lincoln campaigning. So maybe not the best supported.

Option B: Lincoln won because of Union successes in the Civil War. The excerpt doesn't directly link his victory to specific Union successes; it more talks about voter demographics and support. Not sure if this is supported.

Option C: McClellan's home state, NJ, was the only place he had significant support. Wait, the excerpt says McClellan won NJ, Delaware, and Kentucky. So he had support in those states, but it's not clear if those were the only places he had significant support. Maybe in other states he didn't win but still had some support. So C might not be correct.

Option D: 1864 election had one of the lowest vote counts in the 19th century. The excerpt says 78% of the electorate voted, which seems high. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Majority of Lincoln's votes were from younger people. The excerpt says Republicans drew support from younger voters, but it doesn't say they were the majority. So E might not be the best conclusion.

Option F: Most of Lincoln's votes came from military. It says he got 78% of soldiers' votes, but that's not necessarily the majority of his total votes. Soldiers were a significant group, but maybe not the majority of his supporters. So F might not be correct.

Option G: Democrats were strong in rural areas and farmers. No, the excerpt says Republicans had support from farmers, while Democrats were strong in cities and among immigrants. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Lincoln won more in heavily populated Northern states, McClellan in sparse ones. The excerpt doesn't talk about state populations, just that McClellan won NJ, DE, KY. But it does say Lincoln got 55% of the popular vote, which might indicate more support in populated areas. But the excerpt doesn't explicitly state this, so I'm not sure if H is the best.

Option I: Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South. The excerpt doesn't mention black voters at all. So I is not supported.

Option J: Lincoln's victory was due to immigrant support. But the excerpt says Democrats were strong among immigrants, not Republicans. So J is incorrect.

Wait, looking again. The excerpt says that Democrats were strongest in cities and among Irish and German-Americans. So immigrants supported Democrats, not Republicans. So any option suggesting Lincoln had immigrant support is wrong, which includes J.

So which options are left? Let me review.

Option C says McClellan's home state was the only place he had significant support. The excerpt says he won three states, but maybe in other states, he didn't have much support. It says he only won those three, so perhaps those were the only states with significant support. So maybe C is correct.

Option B, about Union successes, is not directly supported by the text. The text doesn't mention any specific events or successes leading to the election outcome, so B isn't the best.

Option H: If Lincoln won the popular vote by a significant margin (55%), that suggests he did well in more populated areas. Since the North was more populated, maybe H is correct. But the text doesn't specify state population densities, so H is an inference.

Option C: The question is whether New Jersey was the only state with significant support. The text says McClellan won three states, but maybe in other states, he didn't get much of the vote. So perhaps C is correct.

Wait, the question is about the conclusion best supported. The excerpt says McClellan won only NJ, DE, and KY. So in those three states, he had significant support, but in other states, perhaps he didn't. So the only states where he had significant support were those three. So C says his home state was the only place he had significant support, but that's not true because he had support in three states. So C is incorrect because it's not the only place.

So now I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Which options are left? The correct answer is likely not among these. Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, the excerpt says McClellan won only three states, but perhaps in other states, he still had a significant percentage of the vote. The question is about where he had significant support. If he won only those three, perhaps those were the only ones where he had significant support.

So option C says McClellan's home state was the only place he had significant support. But he had support in three states, so C is incorrect because it's not only New Jersey.

So maybe the correct answer is H, that Lincoln won more in the heavily populated states. Since his popular vote was 55%, which is a solid majority, it suggests he did well in the more populous states. The North, being more industrialized and populated, likely contributed to this. So H might be the best supported.

Alternatively, looking back, the key point about the military vote: it says Lincoln got 78% of the soldiers' votes, which wasn't necessary for his victory but had symbolic value. But the question is about which conclusion is supported.

Wait, none of the options directly address the military vote except F, but F says the majority of Lincoln's votes came from military, which isn't necessarily true. So F is incorrect.

So perhaps the best supported conclusion is H: Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states, McClellan in sparser ones. Because the popular vote percentage and the fact that McClellan only won three states suggest that.

Alternatively, another angle: the excerpt mentions that the Republicans retained control of Congress, and that the Democrats were strongest in the cities. So maybe the urban vs. rural divide isn't the focus, but the state population could be.

I think option H is the best supported because Lincoln's higher popular vote suggests he won more in the populated states.

The question asks which conclusion is best supported by the excerpt about the 1864 election. The excerpt provides details about voter demographics, election outcomes, and the performance of Lincoln and McClellan. Letâ€™s analyze the options:

- **Option A**: The excerpt does not mention Lincoln campaigning for Congress, so this is not supported.
- **Option B**: The excerpt does not explicitly link Lincoln's victory to Union successes in the Civil War, making this conclusion unsupported.
- **Option C**: McClellan won three states (New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky), so it is incorrect to say his home state was the only place he had significant support.
- **Option D**: The excerpt states that 78% of the electorate voted, which is a high turnout, so this is incorrect.
- **Option E**: While younger voters supported Republicans, the excerpt does not indicate they were the majority of Lincoln's votes, so this is not the best conclusion.
- **Option F**: Lincoln received 78% of the military vote, but the excerpt does not suggest this was the majority of his total votes, so this is incorrect.
- **Option G**: The excerpt states that Democrats were strong in cities, not rural areas, so this is incorrect.
- **Option H**: Lincoln won the popular vote with 55%, suggesting he performed well in heavily populated Northern states, while McClellan won sparsely populated states. This is the best-supported conclusion.
- **Option I**: The excerpt does not mention black voters or the Emancipation Proclamation, so this is unsupported.
- **Option J**: The excerpt states that Democrats, not Republicans, had strong support among immigrants, so this is incorrect.

The best-supported conclusion is that Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states. 

**Answer: H**
