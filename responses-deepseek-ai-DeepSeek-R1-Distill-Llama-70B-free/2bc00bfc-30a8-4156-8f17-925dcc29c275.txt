Question:

How does the term "growth" as used in bacteriologydiffer from the same term as applied to higher plants and animals?

Options:

A: Growth in bacteria refers to the length of their life cycle, while in plants and animals, it pertains to the longevity of individual organisms.
B: Growth in bacteria refers to the speed of their movement, while in plants and animals, it refers to the rate of their metabolism.
C: Growth in bacteria refers to the size of individual cells, while in plants and animals, it refers to the population size.
D: Growth in bacteria refers to an increase in the entire population of cells, while in plants and animals, it refers to the increase in size of the individual organism.
E: Growth in bacteria is measured by the number of species present, while in plants and animals, it is measured by the diversity of the ecosystem.
F: Growth in bacteria refers to the change in their genetic material, while in plants and animals, it refers to the evolution of species.
G: Growth in bacteria refers to the expansion of their habitat, while in plants and animals, it refers to the increase in their territory.
H: Growth in bacteria refers to the increase in cell size, while in plants and animals, it relates to the increase in the number of cells.
I: Growth in bacteria refers to the adaptation to environmental conditions, while in plants and animals, it refers to the development of adaptive traits.
J: Growth in bacteria refers to the complexity of their structure, while in plants and animals, it refers to the development of their organs.

Okay, so I've got this question about how the term "growth" differs in bacteriology compared to higher plants and animals. Hmm, I remember that bacteria are single-celled organisms, so their growth must be different from more complex life forms.

Wait, what do I know about bacterial growth? Bacteria reproduce by binary fission, right? So each bacterium splits into two, leading to an increase in the population. So when we talk about growth in bacteria, it's about the number of individuals increasing. That makes sense because they don't get bigger as single cells; instead, each cell divides.

On the other hand, plants and animals are multicellular. Their growth is about getting bigger. Like, when a plant grows, it might produce new leaves or a taller stem. For animals, growth means increasing in size, like a puppy getting bigger and developing into a dog. So their growth is about the size of the individual organism, not the number of organisms.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says bacterial growth refers to population increase, and plant/animal growth refers to individual size increase.

Option D says exactly that: bacteria growth is an increase in the population, while higher organisms' growth refers to the size of the individual. That fits what I was thinking.

Let me check the other options to be sure. Option C talks about cell size for bacteria, but I don't think bacterial cells get much bigger; they just divide. So C is probably wrong. Option H says bacteria's growth is cell size, which I don't think is right either. Option A is about life cycle length, which doesn't seem related. The others don't seem to fit either.

So I'm confident that the correct answer is D.

The term "growth" in bacteriology refers to an increase in the population of bacteria through cell division, whereas in higher plants and animals, it refers to the increase in the size of individual organisms.

Answer: D
