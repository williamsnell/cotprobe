Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking it down step by step.

The question is about translating a formula in propositional logic (PL) into an English sentence using a given key. The formula given is (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C, and the options are A through J. 

First, I need to understand what each part of the formula means. The key provided assigns each letter to a specific statement:

A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.
B: Izzy plays Minecraft.
C: Emily stops working.
D: Russell makes dinner.
E: Ashleigh stops by.

So, the formula is (~A ∨ ~B) → C. Let me parse this. 

In logic, ~A means "not A", so ~A is "Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book." Similarly, ~B is "Izzy does not play Minecraft." The ∨ symbol stands for "or," so ~A ∨ ~B is "either Marina doesn't read the book or Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, or both." 

The → symbol represents implication, which can be read as "if... then..." So the whole formula is an implication where the antecedent (the "if" part) is (~A ∨ ~B) and the consequent (the "then" part) is C, which is Emily stops working.

Putting it together: If either Marina doesn't read the book or Izzy doesn't play Minecraft (or both), then Emily will stop working. 

Wait, but let me think again. The formula is (~A ∨ ~B) → C. So, whenever ~A or ~B is true, C must be true. Another way to think about it is that for Emily to stop working, it's sufficient that either of those two conditions is met.

Now, I need to look at the options and see which one matches this structure.

Option A: "If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, then Emily will stop working." Hmm, this uses "and" instead of "or." So the antecedent here is ~A ∧ ~B, which is different from our formula which uses ∨. So A is not correct.

Option B: "If Emily stops working, then either Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, or Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." Wait, this is flipping the implication. The formula is (~A ∨ ~B) → C, which is "if (~A or ~B), then C." But option B is C → (~A ∨ ~B), which is the converse. So B is incorrect.

Option C: "Emily will stop working only if Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." The phrase "only if" indicates a necessary condition. So this would mean that for C to be true, both ~A and ~B must be true. But our formula only requires one of them. Also, it's using "and," which is stricter than "or." So C is not right.

Option D: "Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft." Wait, sufficient condition means that if C is true, then the other condition must be true. But D is phrased as C being sufficient for (~A ∨ ~B). That would mean C → (~A ∨ ~B), which again is the converse of our original formula. So D is not correct.

Option E: "Unless Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, Emily will stop working." Let me think about "unless." "Unless X, Y" is logically equivalent to "if not X, then Y." So here, X is "Marina reads or Izzy plays," so not X is "~A ∧ ~B" (neither reads nor plays). So E is saying "if ~A and ~B, then C." But our formula is (~A ∨ ~B) → C, which is a different antecedent. So E is not correct.

Option F: "If Emily stops working, then neither Marina is reading a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy is playing Minecraft." This is C → (~A ∧ ~B). Again, it's the converse and also uses "and" instead of "or." So F is incorrect.

Option G: "Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working." "Entails" is another way of saying implies. So this would mean (~A ∨ ~B) → C, which matches our formula exactly. So G seems correct. But wait, let me check the other options to be sure.

Option H: "If Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily won't stop working." This is (A ∨ B) → ~C. Our formula is (~A ∨ ~B) → C, so H is the inverse of our formula and negates C. So H is not correct.

Option I: "If neither Marina reads a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working." This is (~A ∧ ~B) → C. Our formula uses "or," not "and," so I is not correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me re-examine the formula. The formula is (~A ∨ ~B) → C. So any time either ~A is true or ~B is true, then C must be true. So the correct translation should express that. 

Looking back at G: "Either Marina not reading... or Izzy not playing... entails that Emily stops working." That sounds correct because it directly translates to (~A ∨ ~B) → C.

But wait, let me check the wording of each option again carefully. Option G says "entails that Emily stops working." So yes, that's exactly the implication.

Alternatively, perhaps another option might be correct. Let me think about contrapositive. The contrapositive of (~A ∨ ~B) → C is ~C → (A ∧ B). But none of the options seem to mention that.

Wait, another approach: the original formula can also be written using implication equivalence. Remember that P → Q is equivalent to ~P ∨ Q. So let me rewrite the formula:

(~A ∨ ~B) → C is equivalent to ~(~A ∨ ~B) ∨ C, which simplifies to (A ∧ B) ∨ C. So if both A and B are true, then C is true. Alternatively, if either A or B is false, then C is true.

Wait, but that's complicating things. Let me stick to the original structure. 

So the correct option should state that if either ~A or ~B is true, then C is true. Which matches option G.

Wait, but looking again, option E says: "Unless Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, Emily will stop working." 

Breaking that down, "unless X, Y" is equivalent to "if not X, then Y." So X is (A ∨ B), so not X is (~A ∧ ~B). So E is saying if ~A and ~B, then C. But our formula is if ~A or ~B, then C. So E is not correct.

So the only option that correctly states that either ~A or ~B leads to C is option G.

The formula to translate is \((\neg A \lor \neg B) \to C\), where:

- \(A\): Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.
- \(B\): Izzy plays Minecraft.
- \(C\): Emily stops working.

The formula \((\neg A \lor \neg B) \to C\) can be read as: "If either Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book or Izzy does not play Minecraft (or both), then Emily stops working."

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: "If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, then Emily will stop working."  
   - This uses "and" (\(\neg A \land \neg B\)) instead of "or" (\(\neg A \lor \neg B\)), so it does not match the formula.  
   - **Incorrect**.

2. **Option B**: "If Emily stops working, then either Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, or Izzy doesn't play Minecraft."  
   - This flips the implication, making it \(C \to (\neg A \lor \neg B)\), which is the converse of the original formula.  
   - **Incorrect**.

3. **Option C**: "Emily will stop working only if Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft."  
   - The phrase "only if" indicates a necessary condition, and it uses "and" (\(\neg A \land \neg B\)) instead of "or" (\(\neg A \lor \neg B\)).  
   - **Incorrect**.

4. **Option D**: "Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft."  
   - This suggests \(C \to (\neg A \lor \neg B)\), which is the converse of the formula.  
   - **Incorrect**.

5. **Option E**: "Unless Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, Emily will stop working."  
   - "Unless \(X\), \(Y\)" is equivalent to "If not \(X\), then \(Y\)." Here, \(X\) is \(A \lor B\), so \(\neg X\) is \(\neg A \land \neg B\). This means the statement is \((\neg A \land \neg B) \to C\), which is not the same as the formula.  
   - **Incorrect**.

6. **Option F**: "If Emily stops working, then neither Marina is reading a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy is playing Minecraft."  
   - This is \(C \to (\neg A \land \neg B)\), which is the converse and uses "and" instead of "or."  
   - **Incorrect**.

7. **Option G**: "Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working."  
   - "Entails" means implies, so this directly matches the formula \((\neg A \lor \neg B) \to C\).  
   - **Correct**.

8. **Option H**: "If Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily won't stop working."  
   - This is \((A \lor B) \to \neg C\), which is the inverse of the formula.  
   - **Incorrect**.

9. **Option I**: "If neither Marina reads a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working."  
   - This is \((\neg A \land \neg B) \to C\), which uses "and" instead of "or."  
   - **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The only option that correctly translates the formula \((\neg A \lor \neg B) \to C\) is **Option G**.
