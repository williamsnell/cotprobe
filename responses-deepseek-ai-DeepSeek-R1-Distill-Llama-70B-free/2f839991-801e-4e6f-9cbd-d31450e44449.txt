Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Hindenberg dirigible. Hmm, I remember that the Hindenberg was a hydrogen-filled airship that caught fire, leading to a big disaster. The question is about calculating the energy released when the hydrogen burned.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The volume of hydrogen is 1.4 × 10^8 liters. It was filled at 1 atm and 0°C. So, I think I need to find out how many moles of hydrogen there are, then use the heat of formation of water vapor to find out the energy released.

Wait, the reaction is hydrogen burning to form water vapor. The standard heat of formation of water vapor at 25°C is given as -57.8 Kcal per mole. Since this is exothermic, the energy released should be positive, but the negative sign indicates that it's the enthalpy change.

First, I need to calculate the moles of H2. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Since pressure is 1 atm, temperature is 0°C which is 273 K. R is the gas constant, but I need to make sure the units match. Oh wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So that should work here.

So n = PV/(RT). P is 1 atm, V is 1.4e8 L, T is 273 K.

n = (1 atm * 1.4e8 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 273 K)

Let me calculate the denominator first. 0.0821 * 273 ≈ let's see, 0.08 * 273 is about 21.84. But more accurately, 0.0821 * 273 is approximately 22.41.

So n ≈ 1.4e8 / 22.41 ≈ let's compute that. 1.4e8 is 140,000,000. Divided by 22.41.

140e6 / 22.41 ≈ let's see, 140e6 is 140 million. 22.41 times 6 is about 134.46, so 6.24 million perhaps? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 22.41 × 6.24 = 140?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me compute this step by step.

140,000,000 divided by 22.41.

22.41 * 6.24e6 = ?

Let me see, 22.41 * 6e6 = 134.46e6. 22.41 * 0.24e6 = approx 5.378e6. So total about 139.838e6. Close to 140e6.

So n ≈ 6.24e6 moles of H2.

But wait, wait, the reaction of hydrogen burning is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

So each 2 moles of H2 produces 2 moles of H2O, releasing 2*(-57.8) kcal. Because each mole of H2O releases 57.8 kcal.

Wait, no. The standard heat of formation is for one mole of H2O. So for each mole of H2O formed, 57.8 kcal is released. So for each mole of H2 burned, how much is released?

The reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2 moles of H2 produce 2 moles of H2O. So each mole of H2 leads to one mole of H2O. Therefore, the heat released per mole of H2 is 57.8 kcal.

So for each mole of H2, 57.8 kcal is released. So total energy released would be n_H2 * 57.8 kcal.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the stoichiometry again. The balanced equation is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2 moles H2 → 2 moles H2O. So per 2 moles H2, 2 * 57.8 kcal is released. So per mole H2, 57.8 kcal is released. So yes, the energy per mole H2 is 57.8 kcal.

So n is 6.24e6 moles H2. So energy released is 6.24e6 * 57.8 kcal.

Wait, 57.8 times 6.24e6. Let me compute that.

6e6 *57.8 = 346.8e6.

0.24e6 is 240,000. 240,000 *57.8 = let's compute 240,000 *50 =12,000,000; 240,000 *7.8 = 1,872,000. So total 13,872,000. So 346.8e6 +13.872e6 = 360.672e6 kcal.

Wait, but wait, let me check the exact multiplication.

6.24e6 * 57.8 = ?

Well, 6.24 *57.8 = let's compute that.

6 * 57.8 = 346.8

0.24 *57.8 = 13.872

So 346.8 +13.872 = 360.672

So 360.672e6 Kcal.

Looking at the options, option E is 360 ×10^6 Kcal. Option C is 450. Option F is 480, etc.

Wait, but wait, is there any consideration for temperature change? The problem states that the reaction temperature is 25°C, but the hydrogen was filled at 0°C. Do I need to account for the change in temperature's effect on the internal energy or enthalpy?

Wait, the standard heat of formation given is at 25°C. So I think that the calculation is considering the products at 25°C. So the initial temperature is 0°C, but the reaction occurs at 25°C. Hmm, but wait, when you burn hydrogen, the reaction itself releases heat, but perhaps the heat capacity would come into play for the temperature change of the gases.

Wait, but the question asks for the energy released when it burned to gaseous products at a reaction temperature of 25°C. So perhaps the initial and final temperatures are both 25°C, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat of formation is the enthalpy change at 25°C, so the calculation already accounts for that. So the temperature during the reaction (25°C) is the same as the standard conditions for the heat of formation. So perhaps no additional temperature adjustments are needed.

So the calculation we did, 360.672e6 Kcal, which is approximately 3.6e8 Kcal, but looking at the options, E is 360e6 Kcal. So 360 million kcal.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the moles again.

Wait, the volume is 1.4e8 liters. Pressure is 1 atm, temperature 0°C (273 K). Using PV=nRT.

n = (1 atm * 1.4e8 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *273 K)

Compute denominator: 0.0821 *273 = let's calculate accurately.

0.0821 * 273 = 

0.08 *273 =21.84

0.0021 *273 = 0.5733

So total 22.4133 ≈22.413.

So n =1.4e8 /22.413 ≈ let me compute 1.4e8 /22.413.

1.4e8 is 140,000,000.

140,000,000 divided by 22.413. Let's compute 22.413 *6.24e6.

Wait, 22.413 *6e6 is 134,478,000.

22.413 *0.24e6 is 5,379,120.

So 134,478,000 +5,379,120 =139,857,120. So 6.24e6 moles would be 6,240,000. So 22.413 *6.24e6 = approx 139.857e6, which is close to 140e6. So n ≈6.24e6 moles H2.

So the energy is 6.24e6 *57.8 kcal.

6 *57.8 is 346.8, 0.24 *57.8 is 13.872, total 360.672 million kcal.

Looking at the options, option E is 360e6 Kcal. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So per 2 moles H2, 2 moles H2O are formed. So the ΔH is 2*(-57.8) = -115.6 kcal per 2 moles H2, which is -57.8 kcal per mole H2.

So yes, the calculation is correct. So the energy is 6.24e6 *57.8 = 360.67e6 Kcal, which is approximately 360e6, so option E.

To calculate the energy released when the hydrogen in the Hindenberg dirigible burned, we start by determining the number of moles of hydrogen gas using the ideal gas law:

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

Given:
- \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \),
- \( V = 1.4 \times 10^8 \, \text{L} \),
- \( T = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273 \, \text{K} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \),

we calculate:

\[
n = \frac{1 \cdot 1.4 \times 10^8}{0.0821 \cdot 273} \approx \frac{1.4 \times 10^8}{22.413} \approx 6.24 \times 10^6 \, \text{moles of H}_2.
\]

The reaction for the combustion of hydrogen is:

\[
2 \, \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of \(\text{H}_2\) produce 2 moles of \(\text{H}_2\text{O}\), so each mole of \(\text{H}_2\) produces 1 mole of \(\text{H}_2\text{O}\). The standard heat of formation of water vapor at 25°C is given as \(-57.8 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\), meaning 57.8 Kcal of energy is released per mole of \(\text{H}_2\) burned.

The total energy released is:

\[
\text{Energy} = n_{\text{H}_2} \cdot \Delta H = 6.24 \times 10^6 \cdot 57.8 \, \text{Kcal}.
\]

Breaking this down:
\[
6 \times 10^6 \cdot 57.8 = 346.8 \times 10^6, \quad 0.24 \times 10^6 \cdot 57.8 = 13.872 \times 10^6,
\]
\[
\text{Total Energy} = 346.8 \times 10^6 + 13.872 \times 10^6 = 360.672 \times 10^6 \, \text{Kcal}.
\]

Thus, the energy released is approximately \( 360 \times 10^6 \, \text{Kcal} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
