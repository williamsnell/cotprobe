Okay, I have this question about genetics, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking which traits are affected by more than one gene. The options are from A to J, and each represents a different genetic concept. Let me go through each option one by one to see which ones fit.

So, the question is about traits influenced by more than one gene. I remember that some traits are polygenic, which means multiple genes control them. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details of each term, so I'll think through each option.

Starting with option A: Heterozygous traits. Heterozygous refers to having two different alleles for a gene, like in Aa. But this is about the genotype of a single gene, not multiple genes. So this probably isn't the right answer.

Option B: Mendelian traits. Mendelian traits are those that follow the laws of Mendel, like segregation and independent assortment. These are typically controlled by single genes, such as flower color or pea shape. So this might not be correct since the question is about multiple genes.

Option C: Multiple alleles traits. Multiple alleles mean more than two alleles for a single gene, like in blood types (ABO system). But again, it's about one gene with several alleles, not multiple genes. So this is probably not the answer.

Option D: Polygenic traits. Polygenic definitely comes to mind. These are traits influenced by more than one gene. Examples include skin color, height, and eye color. So D is a strong candidate.

Option E: Pleiotropic traits. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Like how a single gene might influence both eye color and hearing. So this is the opposite situationâ€”multiple traits from one gene. So E is not what we're looking for.

Option F: Sex-linked traits. These are genes located on the sex chromosomes. They can be influenced by one gene, but whether it's on the X or Y doesn't necessarily mean multiple genes. So F is about location, not the number of genes.

Option G: Incomplete dominance traits. Incomplete dominance is when the heterozygote shows a blend, like pink flowers in snapdragons. This is about the interaction of alleles at a single gene locus, not multiple genes. So G isn't it.

Option H: Autosomal traits. Autosomal refers to genes on non-sex chromosomes. Like B, these can be single-gene traits, such as cystic fibrosis. So H doesn't fit the multiple gene idea.

Option I: Codominant traits. Codominance is when both alleles are expressed, like blood type AB. Again, it's about alleles of a single gene, not multiple genes. So I is out.

Option J: Blended alleles. I think this refers to when alleles combine, like in incomplete dominance, resulting in a blend. But that's a single gene scenario, so J isn't correct.

So the only option that fits is D: Polygenic traits. These are definitely affected by more than one gene. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other options. Wait, the question says "which of the following are traits" so it's possible there could be more than one correct option, but looking back, the options are presented as single-select, I think. So the correct answer is D.

The question asks which traits are affected by more than one gene. After analyzing each option:

- **A: Heterozygous traits** involve two different alleles of a single gene, not multiple genes.
- **B: Mendelian traits** are typically controlled by single genes.
- **C: Multiple alleles traits** refer to multiple alleles of a single gene.
- **D: Polygenic traits** are influenced by multiple genes, making this the correct answer.
- **E: Pleiotropic traits** involve one gene affecting multiple traits, not multiple genes.
- **F: Sex-linked traits** are located on sex chromosomes but not necessarily influenced by multiple genes.
- **G: Incomplete dominance traits** involve the interaction of alleles at a single gene locus.
- **H: Autosomal traits** are located on non-sex chromosomes but can be single-gene traits.
- **I: Codominant traits** involve the expression of two alleles of a single gene.
- **J: Blended alleles** refer to the combination of alleles in incomplete dominance, a single-gene phenomenon.

The correct answer is **D: Polygenic traits**, as they are explicitly influenced by more than one gene.

Answer: D
