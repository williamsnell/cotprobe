Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the diffusion coefficient of nitrogen gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the collisional cross section of N2 as 0.43 nm². I need to find the diffusion coefficient at 1 atm and 298 K. The options are from A to J, each with different values. 

Wait, I remember that the diffusion coefficient is related to the kinetic theory of gases. Oh right, Graham's law comes into play here, but wait, no, Graham's law is more about the rate of effusion. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, there's the Stokes-Einstein equation, but that's for particles in a fluid, so maybe not applicable here.

Oh wait, the diffusion coefficient for gases can be calculated using the formula involving the mean free path. Or perhaps it's the Chapman-Enskog theory? Yeah, that's right. The Chapman-Enskog equation gives the diffusion coefficient for binary gas mixtures, but since this is N2 in itself, maybe a self-diffusion coefficient applies here.

The formula for the diffusion coefficient D is given by something like D = (1/3) * λ * v_avg, where λ is the mean free path and v_avg is the average speed of the molecules. But wait, I think the actual formula might have more precise terms.

Alternatively, I remember there's a formula that relates D to the pressure, temperature, and the collisional cross section. Let me try to recall the exact expression. Oh right, the diffusion coefficient can be expressed as:

D = (k_B * T) / (3 * sqrt(2) * π * d² * P)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Another approach is to use the kinetic theory formula for diffusion coefficient:

D = ( (k_B * T) / (3 * π * η * d) ) * sqrt( (π * m) / (8 * k_B * T) ) )

Hmm, not sure about that. Maybe I should look for a more direct formula. Oh wait, the formula I remember is D = ( (1/3) * λ * v_avg ) * (1/ (something)).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is D = ( (k_B * T) / (3 * π * η * d) ), but I'm getting confused with the terms. Maybe I should think in terms of the mean free path λ.

The mean free path λ is given by λ = (k_B * T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where d is the collisional diameter. Wait, but here the cross section is given, which is σ = π d². So σ = π d² → d² = σ / π.

So substituting that into the formula for λ:

λ = (k_B * T) / (sqrt(2) * π * (σ/π) * P )

Simplify that: the π in the denominator and the σ's denominator π would cancel. Let's see:

λ = (k_B * T) / (sqrt(2) * σ * P )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

λ = (k_B*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P )

But since d² = σ/(π), substituting:

λ = (k_B*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * (σ/π) * P )

Simplify denominator: sqrt(2) * π * (σ/π) = sqrt(2) * σ

So λ = (k_B*T) / (sqrt(2) * σ * P )

Now, the average speed v_avg is sqrt( (8 * k_B * T) / (π * m) ), where m is the mass of a single molecule.

So putting it all together, the diffusion coefficient D is (1/3) * λ * v_avg.

So D = (1/3) * [ (k_B*T) / (sqrt(2) * σ * P) ) ] * [ sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π m) ) ]

Let me compute that:

D = (k_B*T) / (3 * sqrt(2) * σ * P ) * sqrt(8 k_B T / (π m)) )

Simplify terms:

Multiply the terms under square roots:

sqrt(8 k_B T / (π m)) ) = sqrt(8) * sqrt(k_B T / (π m)) )

So putting it all together:

D = (k_B T) / (3 sqrt(2) σ P ) ) * sqrt(8) * sqrt( k_B T / (π m) )

Simplify sqrt(8) = 2 sqrt(2). So:

D = (k_B T ) * 2 sqrt(2) * sqrt( k_B T / (π m) ) ) / ( 3 sqrt(2) σ P )

The sqrt(2) cancels with the denominator's sqrt(2), leaving 2 sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) = 2.

So:

D = (2 k_B T ) * sqrt( k_B T / (π m) ) ) / ( 3 σ P )

Wait, perhaps there's a better approach. Alternatively, I can recall that for self-diffusion, the diffusion coefficient is given by:

D = ( (3/8) * sqrt( (k_B T)^3 / (π m) ) ) / ( P * σ )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look up the formula again but since I can't, I'll try another approach.

Alternatively, another formula for the diffusion coefficient is D = ( (1/3) * λ * v_avg ), as I thought earlier. So let's compute λ and v_avg.

Compute λ first:

λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) * π d² P )

But d² = σ/π, so substituting:

λ = (k_B T) / ( sqrt(2) * π * (σ/π) * P ) ) = (k_B T) / ( sqrt(2) * σ * P )

Compute v_avg: v_avg = sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π m) )

So D = (1/3) * (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) σ P ) ) * sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π m) )

Simplify this expression:

D = (1/3) * (k_B T) * sqrt(8 k_B T) / ( sqrt(2) σ P ) * 1/ sqrt( π m )

So sqrt(8) is 2*sqrt(2), so:

sqrt(8 k_B T) = 2 sqrt(2) sqrt( k_B T )

Thus:

D = (1/3) * (k_B T) * (2 sqrt(2) sqrt(k_B T)) ) / ( sqrt(2) σ P sqrt( π m ) )

Simplify terms:

The sqrt(2) cancels in numerator and denominator.

So:

D = (1/3) * 2 * (k_B T) * sqrt(k_B T) ) / ( σ P sqrt( π m ) )

Wait, let's compute the exponents:

(k_B T) * sqrt(k_B T) = (k_B T)^(3/2)

So:

D = (2 / 3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( σ P sqrt( π m ) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe it's better to use the formula as D = (1/(3 sqrt(2))) * ( (k_B T)/(π m) )^(1/2) * (k_B T)/(P σ) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term step by step.

First, compute the average speed v_avg:

v_avg = sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π m) )

Then, compute the mean free path λ:

λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) * π d² P )

But since d² = σ/π, substitute:

λ = (k_B T) / ( sqrt(2) * π * (σ/π) * P )

Simplify denominator: sqrt(2) * σ * P

So λ = (k_B T) / ( sqrt(2) * σ * P )

Then, D = (1/3) * λ * v_avg

So:

D = (1/3) * [ (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) σ P) ] * [ sqrt(8 k_B T / (π m)) ]

Now, sqrt(8) is 2 sqrt(2), so:

D = (1/3) * [ (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) σ P) ] * [ 2 sqrt(2) * sqrt( k_B T / (π m) ) ]

The sqrt(2) in denominator and numerator will cancel:

So D = (1/3) * (k_B T) * 2 sqrt(2) * sqrt( k_B T / (π m) ) / ( sqrt(2) σ P )

Wait, no, the sqrt(2) in the denominator is from λ, and the numerator has sqrt(8) which is 2 sqrt(2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to just plug in the numbers.

Let me collect all the constants and variables.

Given:

σ = 0.43 nm² = 0.43e-18 m² (since 1 nm² = 1e-18 m² )

P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa

T = 298 K

We need m, the mass of a N2 molecule.

The molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol. So the molecular mass m is (28 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number).

Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 mol⁻¹.

So m = 28e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = (28e-3) / (6.022e23) kg.

Let me compute that:

28e-3 / 6.022e23 = (28 / 6.022) * 1e-26 kg.

28 / 6.022 ≈ 4.6486 → 4.6486e-26 kg.

So m ≈ 4.6486e-26 kg.

Now, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Now, compute each term step by step.

First, compute the mean free path λ:

λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) * σ * P )

Compute numerator: k_B T = 1.380649e-23 J/K * 298 K ≈ 4.114e-21 J.

Denominator: sqrt(2) * 0.43e-18 m² * 101325 Pa.

Compute denominator step by step:

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142.

So denominator = 1.4142 * 0.43e-18 m² * 101325 Pa.

Wait, Pa is N/m², so units: m²·Pa = m²*(N/m²) )= N/m^0 → but wait, the denominator is sqrt(2)*σ*P → units would be (m²)*(Pa), but Pa is kg/(m·s²). Hmm, not sure about the units here, but perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

Compute denominator:

1.4142 * 0.43e-18 = approx 0.608e-18 → 6.08e-19.

Multiply by 101325:

6.08e-19 * 1e5 (approx, since 1e5 is 100,000) → 6.08e-14. But more accurately:

101325 = 1.01325e5 → 6.08e-19 * 1.01325e5 ≈ 6.08e-19 * 1e5 = 6.08e-14, but let's compute it properly.

6.08e-19 * 1.01325e5 = 6.08 * 1.01325 * 1e-14 → 6.08 *1.01325 ≈ 6.16 → 6.16e-14.

So denominator is approximately 6.16e-14.

So λ = 4.114e-21 / 6.16e-14 ≈ let's compute that.

4.114e-21 / 6.16e-14 = (4.114 /6.16) * 1e-7 → approx 0.6677 * 1e-7 → 6.677e-8 m, which is 66.77 nm. That seems reasonable for a mean free path at 1 atm.

Next, compute v_avg.

v_avg = sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π m) )

Compute numerator inside sqrt: 8 k_B T = 8 * 4.114e-21 J = 3.291e-20 J.

Denominator: π m = π * 4.6486e-26 kg ≈ 3.1416 *4.6486e-26 ≈ 1.46e-25 kg.

So the fraction is 3.291e-20 / 1.46e-25 = approx (3.291 / 1.46) * 1e5 → approx 2.254 * 1e5 → 2.254e5.

Taking sqrt of that: sqrt(2.254e5) ≈ 474.8 m/s.

So v_avg ≈ 475 m/s.

Now, compute D.

D = (1/3) * λ * v_avg → (1/3) * 6.677e-8 m * 475 m/s.

Multiply 6.677e-8 * 475 = 3.170e-5 m²/s.

Then divide by 3: 3.170e-5 /3 ≈ 1.057e-5 m²/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.06e-5, which matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes factors can be tricky.

Wait, when I computed λ, I used (k_B T)/(sqrt(2)*σ*P). Did I get the formula right? Let me make sure.

Yes, the formula for the mean free path is (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P ), but since d² = σ/π, substituting gives (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) σ P ), which I used.

So the calculation for λ was correct.

And v_avg is correct as well.

Then D should be (1/3)*λ*v_avg → which gives approximately 1.06e-5 m²/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.06e-5, which should be the correct answer.

To determine the diffusion coefficient of $\mathrm{N}_2$ at a pressure of $1 \mathrm{~atm}$ and a temperature of $298 \mathrm{~K}$, we use the formula for the diffusion coefficient:

\[
D = \frac{1}{3} \lambda v_{\text{avg}}
\]

where $\lambda$ is the mean free path and $v_{\text{avg}}$ is the average molecular speed.

### Step 1: Calculate the mean free path $\lambda$
The mean free path is given by:

\[
\lambda = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \sigma P}
\]

Here:
- $k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J/K}$ (Boltzmann constant),
- $T = 298 \mathrm{~K}$,
- $\sigma = 0.43 \mathrm{~nm}^2 = 0.43 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{~m}^2$ (collisional cross section),
- $P = 1 \mathrm{~atm} = 101325 \mathrm{~Pa}$.

Substituting the values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{(1.380649 \times 10^{-23})(298)}{\sqrt{2}(0.43 \times 10^{-18})(101325)}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
k_B T = (1.380649 \times 10^{-23})(298) = 4.114 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~J}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sigma \cdot P = 1.4142 \cdot (0.43 \times 10^{-18}) \cdot 101325 = 6.16 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda = \frac{4.114 \times 10^{-21}}{6.16 \times 10^{-14}} = 6.677 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~m}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the average molecular speed $v_{\text{avg}}$
The average molecular speed is given by:

\[
v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{8 k_B T}{\pi m}}
\]

Here, $m$ is the mass of a single $\mathrm{N}_2$ molecule. The molar mass of $\mathrm{N}_2$ is $28 \mathrm{~g/mol}$, so:

\[
m = \frac{28 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}} = 4.6486 \times 10^{-26} \mathrm{~kg}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{8 (1.380649 \times 10^{-23})(298)}{\pi (4.6486 \times 10^{-26})}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator inside the square root:

\[
8 k_B T = 8 \cdot (1.380649 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot 298 = 3.291 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{~J}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
\pi m = 3.1416 \cdot (4.6486 \times 10^{-26}) = 1.46 \times 10^{-25} \mathrm{~kg}
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{3.291 \times 10^{-20}}{1.46 \times 10^{-25}}} = \sqrt{2.254 \times 10^5} = 474.8 \mathrm{~m/s}
\]

### Step
