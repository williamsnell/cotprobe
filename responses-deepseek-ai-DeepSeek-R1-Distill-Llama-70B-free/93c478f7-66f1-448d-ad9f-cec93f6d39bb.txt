Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a simple harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in SHM, the natural frequency is an important concept. The question gives me a mass and a spring constant, and I need to find the natural frequency. Let's think about the formula.

Wait, the natural frequency formula is nu_0 equals one over two pi times the square root of mass over spring constant. No, wait, no. I think it's sqrt(k/m) divided by 2pi? Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the angular frequency omega_0 is sqrt(k/m), and the frequency nu is omega divided by 2pi. So yeah, nu_0 equals (1/(2pi)) times sqrt(k/m). But wait, sometimes it's written as sqrt(k/m)/(2pi). That's the same thing.

Wait, the mass is given as 100 grams. Oh, right, I need to convert that to kilograms because in SI units, mass is in kg. So 100 grams is 0.1 kg. Got it.

The spring constant k is 1e4 dyne/cm. Wait, what's a dyne? I remember that 1 dyne equals 1e-5 Newtons. Because 1 N is 1 kg·m/s², and 1 dyne is g·cm/s², with g being 9.8 m/s², so 9.8e-3 kg·m/s². Wait, no—wait, 1 dyne = 1 g·cm/s². Since 1 kg is 1000 g, 1 g is 0.001 kg. 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 1 dyne = (0.001 kg)(0.01 m/s²) )= 1e-5 kg·m/s², which is 1e-5 N. Right, so 1 dyne is 1e-5 N.

So the spring constant k is 1e4 dyne/cm. Let me convert that to N/m. Because 1 dyne/cm is (1e-5 N) / (0.01 m) )= 1e-3 N/m. So 1e4 dyne/cm is 1e4 * (1e-3 N/m) )= 1e1 N/m? Wait, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, 1 dyne/cm = (1e-5 N) / (0.01 m) )= (1e-5) / (1e-2) )= 1e-3 N/m. So yes, 1 dyne/cm = 1e-3 N/m. So 1e4 dyne/cm is 1e4 * 1e-3 N/m = 1e1 N/m. So k is 10 N/m.

Wait, but wait, 1e4 dyne/cm is 10^4 dyne per cm. So for each cm, it's 1e4 dyne. So when you have 1e4 dyne/cm, that's the same as 1e4 (g·cm/s²) per cm. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of units. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert k into N/m directly.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute everything in CGS units and then convert the frequency. Let me think about that. Because sometimes using CGS units for some steps might be easier. Let me see.

Wait, the formula for the frequency is nu = (1/(2pi)) * sqrt(k/m). So if I can compute k in dynes/cm and m in grams, perhaps I can find the frequency in a different unit system, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Wait, no, the natural frequency is in hertz, which is per second. So it's better to convert everything to SI units.

So mass m is 100 grams = 0.1 kg.

Spring constant k is 1e4 dyne/cm. So 1e4 dyne/cm is equal to 1e4 * (1e-5 N) / (1e-2 m), because 1 dyne is 1e-5 N and 1 cm is 1e-2 m. So the calculation:

k = (1e4 dyne/cm) * (1e-5 N/1 dyne) / (1e-2 m/cm) 

Wait, let me redo that. So, 1 dyne/cm = 1e-5 N / 0.01 m, because 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 1 dyne/cm = (1e-5 N) / (0.01 m) )= 1e-3 N/m.

So 1e4 dyne/cm is 1e4 * 1e-3 N/m = 10 N/m. So k = 10 N/m.

Now, plugging into the frequency formula:

nu_0 = (1/(2pi)) * sqrt(k/m) 

k is 10 N/m, m is 0.1 kg.

So sqrt(k/m) is sqrt(10 / 0.1) = sqrt(100) =10. So 10 rad/s.

Then nu_0 = (1/(2 pi)) *10 ≈ (10)/(6.2832) ≈ approx 1.5915 Hz. Which is about 1.59 s^-1.

Wait, but looking at the options, they’re all in the range of 1e-2 s^-1. For example, option A is 5.8e-2, which is 0.058. Hmmm, that's way lower than what I got. So I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the unit conversion somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I converted 1e4 dyne/cm to N/m, I think I may have made an error. Let me go through that again.

1 dyne = 1e-5 N.

1 cm = 0.01 m.

So 1 dyne/cm is equal to (1e-5 N) per 0.01 m, so:

1 dyne/cm = (1e-5 N) / (0.01 m) )= 1e-3 N/m.

So 1e4 dyne/cm is 1e4 * 1e-3 N/m = 1e1 N/m, which is 10 N/m. That's correct.

Wait, but then when I plug into the formula, I get nu_0 as about 1.59 Hz, which is way higher than any of the options. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Wait, wait, no—frequency is (1/2pi) * sqrt(k/m), right? Yes. Because angular frequency omega is sqrt(k/m), and frequency is omega/(2pi).

Wait, perhaps the units for the spring constant were given in a different way. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says k is 1e4 dyne/cm. Right, 10^4 dyne/cm.

Wait, did I convert that correctly to N/m? Oh wait, another approach: 1 dyne/cm is 0.1 N/m. Because 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 dyne/cm is (1e-5 N) / (0.01 m) )= 1e-3 N/m. Wait, 1e-5 / 1e-2 = 1e-3. So yes, 1 dyne/cm is 1e-3 N/m. So 1e4 dyne/cm is 1e4 *1e-3 N/m = 10 N/m. So that's correct.

Hmm, so why am I getting such a high frequency when the options are all around 0.06 to 0.09 Hz?

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation of the formula. Let me recalculate:

k =10 N/m

m=0.1 kg

so k/m =10 /0.1 =100.

sqrt(k/m) is sqrt(100)=10 rad/s.

Then nu_0=10/(2 pi)≈10/(6.2832)= approx 1.5915 Hz.

But that's not matching any of the options. All the options are 0.06 to 0.09 times 1e-1, so 0.06 to 0.09 s^-1.

Wait, did I perhaps miss a decimal point in the given problem?

Wait, the problem says the mass is 100 grams. So 0.1 kg. That seems right.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Wait, sometimes when you see natural frequency, maybe the formula is sqrt(k/m) divided by 2pi, but I think that's correct.

Wait, wait wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh no. Wait, angular frequency is sqrt(k/m) but frequency is that divided by 2pi, yes. So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the answer is about 1.59 Hz, which is 1.59 s^-1. But the options are all in the 0.06-0.09 s^-1 range. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the mass and the spring constant. Let me think. Oh wait, in the formula, it's k/m. So if I had m=0.1 kg and k=10 N/m, k/m is 100. But wait, if I had m=100 kg, that would be different, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the spring constant was given as 1e4 dyne per cm, which is 1e4 * 1e-5 N / 0.01 m. Wait, let's recalculate:

1 dyne/cm = (1e-5 N) / (0.01 m) = 1e-3 N/m. 

So 1e4 dyne/cm is 1e4 * 1e-3 N/m =10 N/m. So that's correct.

Hmm, so I'm getting a much higher frequency than the options suggest. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought: maybe the problem is using a different formula, perhaps square root of (k/m) but in different units.

Wait, let me try to compute the frequency using CGS units. Because in CGS, mass is in grams, spring constant in dyne/cm, and time in seconds, perhaps it would be easier.

In CGS units, the formula for frequency in Hz (which is 1/s) is:

nu = (1/(2 pi)) * sqrt( k / m )

But in CGS, k is in dyne/cm, which is g·cm/s² per cm, so dyne/cm is g/s². Because dyne is g·cm/s². So 1 dyne/cm is (g·cm/s²)/cm = g/s².

So when using CGS units, the formula would be:

nu (Hz) = (1/(2 pi)) * sqrt( k (dyne/cm) / m (g) )

Wait, because in CGS, k is in dyne/cm = g/s². m is in grams, which is g.

So let me plug in the values:

k =1e4 dyne/cm.

m=100 grams.

So sqrt( k/m ) = sqrt(1e4 / 100 ) = sqrt(100) )=10 s^-1.

Then nu_0 = 10/(2 pi) ≈1.5915 Hz.

Same result as before. So same problem. So why are the options all around 0.06 Hz?

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula, perhaps the period instead? No, the question asks for frequency.

Wait, maybe the problem statement had a typo. Let me check again.

Problem statement: mass is 100g, spring force constant 1e4 dyne/cm. Displaced 3 cm and released. Calculate the natural frequency nu_0.

Wait, but the initial displacement doesn't affect the natural frequency. So it shouldn't matter. So the displacement is irrelevant here.

Hmm, I'm really confused. Because according to my calculations, the answer is around 1.59 Hz, which is not among the options.

But all the options are about 0.06 to 0.09 Hz. So perhaps I made a mistake in converting units.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the conversion from dyne/cm to N/m.

Wait, 1 dyne = 1e-5 N.

1 cm = 0.01 m.

So 1 dyne/cm = (1e-5 N) / (0.01 m) )= 1e-3 N/m.

So 1e4 dyne/cm = 1e4 * 1e-3 N/m =10 N/m. So that's correct.

Wait another idea: did I confuse Hz with rad/s? Because angular frequency is in rad/s. So for example, if I got 10 rad/s, that's about 1.59 Hz. But the options are in the 0.06-0.09 Hz range, so that's way off.

Wait, could the spring constant be 1e4 N/m instead of 1e4 dyne/cm? That would make sense because 1e4 N/m would give a lower frequency. But the problem clearly states 1e4 dyne/cm. So that can't be.

Another possibility: perhaps I mixed up meters and centimeters in the spring constant. Let me think. Oh wait, no, the spring constant is in dyne/cm, so per cm. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should try recalculating using different units.

Wait, let me try to express the formula in CGS units.

In CGS, the formula for angular frequency is:

omega = sqrt( (k dynes/cm) / m grams )

Wait, because in CGS, F = -k x, where k is in dyne/cm, x in cm, so F in dyne.

But for the formula, angular frequency in rad/s is sqrt(k/m). But in CGS, the units of k are dyne/cm, and m in grams.

Wait, let me check the units. Dyne is g cm/s².

So k in dyne/cm is (g cm/s²) / cm = g/s².

Mass m in grams is g.

So k/m is (g/s²) / g )= 1/s². So the square root is 1/s. So that gives angular frequency in rad/s. So the formula is correct.

So when I plug in k =1e4 dyne/cm, m=100 g.

omega = sqrt(1e4 / 100 )=sqrt(100)=10 rad/s. So frequency is 10/(2 pi)= ~1.59 Hz.

So same result. So no, the calculation is correct, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps the problem is in the initial data.

Wait, looking back, the mass is 100 grams, which is 0.1 kg. Correct. Spring constant 1e4 dyne/cm, which is 10 N/m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the frequency. Let me compute it again.

k =10 N/m

m=0.1 kg

omega = sqrt(10 / 0.1 )= sqrt(100)=10 rad/s.

nu = 10 / (2 pi) = 1.5915 Hz ≈1.59 s^-1.

Hmm... So the answer is approximately 1.59 Hz, which is 1.59 s^-1. But looking at the options, the highest is option J at 0.7e-1, which is 0.07, way lower.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the units. Let me think: perhaps I should have converted the displacement into meters before plugging in. But no, the displacement doesn't affect the natural frequency, only the amplitude.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the period, not the frequency? Let me check the question again. No, it's asking for the natural frequency nu_0.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the calculation was done correctly, but I'm missing a factor. Let me re-examine the formula.

Wait, the formula for frequency is nu = (1/(2 pi)) * sqrt(k/m). Yes. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should try plugging in the numbers without unit conversion, but that might lead to errors. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for g or something, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the formula uses the spring constant in N/cm instead of N/m? Let's see.

Wait, if k is given as 1e4 dyne/cm, which is 10 N/m, but if I mistakenly treated it as N/cm, that would change things.

Wait, 1 N/cm = 100 N/m. So if k were 1e4 N/cm, that would be 1e6 N/m, which is way higher. But that's not the case here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done in Hz but using different unit conversions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the period first, then invert it.

The period T is 2pi sqrt(m/k). So T in seconds.

m=0.1 kg, k=10 N/m.

T = 2pi * sqrt(0.1/10) = 2pi * sqrt(0.01) = 2pi * 0.1 = 0.2 pi seconds. So T ≈0.628 s.

Then frequency nu=1/T ≈1.5915 Hz, same as before.

Hmm, same result. So I'm confident in this calculation, but it's not matching any of the options.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

A: 5.8e-2

B:4.7e-2

C:8.2e-2

D:6.9e-2

E:5.5e-2

F:9.0e-2

G:6.2e-2

H:7.5e-2

I:8.5e-2

J:7.0e-2

Wait, all are in the 0.04 to 0.09 Hz range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion somewhere. Let me try converting the spring constant again.

Wait, 1 dyne/cm = (1e-5 N) / (0.01 m) )= 1e-3 N/m.

So 1e4 dyne/cm = 1e4 * 1e-3 N/m =10 N/m.

Ah wait, wait a second! 1e4 dyne/cm is 10^4 dyne/cm. So 1e4 dyne/cm is equal to 10^4 * (1e-5 N) / (1e
