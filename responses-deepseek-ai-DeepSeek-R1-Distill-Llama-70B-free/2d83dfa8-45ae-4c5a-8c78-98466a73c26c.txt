Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mr. John Kirk borrowed $3,000 and was charged an interest rate of 10 and a half percent for 180 days. I need to figure out how much interest he has to pay. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky depending on the type of interest. I think this might be simple interest because it's for a specific period, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, the problem says it's for a 180-day period, so maybe it's simple interest over that time.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate, and T is the time in years. Wait, but here the time is given in days, 180 days. So I need to convert that into years because the rate is annual.

Wait a second, 180 days is half a year, right? Because 180 is half of 360, which I think is the number of days in a year for these calculations. So that means T is 0.5 years.

Now, the interest rate is 10 and a half percent. Oh wait, 10 and a half is 10.5%. So R is 0.105 in decimal.

Putting it all together, the principal P is $3,000. So I = 3000 * 0.105 * 0.5. Let me calculate that.

First, 0.105 multiplied by 0.5 is 0.0525. Then, 3000 multiplied by 0.0525. Let me do that step by step. 3000 * 0.05 is 150, because 3000*0.05 is 150. Then 3000*0.0025 is 7.5. So adding those together, 150 + 7.5 is 157.5. So the interest should be $157.50.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $157.50. Let me check the options again. Option I is $157.50, so that must be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Another way: 10.5% of 3000 is (10.5/100)*3000. Let's compute that. 10% of 3000 is 300, 0.5% is 15, so together 300+15=315. So 10.5% is $315. But wait, that's for a full year. Since it's only half a year, we take half of 315, which is 157.50. Yep, that's the same result.

So the correct answer should be I: $157.50.

The interest calculation involves using the simple interest formula \( I = P \times R \times T \), where:

- **Principal (P)** = $3,000
- **Rate (R)** = 10.5% = 0.105
- **Time (T)** = 180 days = 0.5 years

Substituting the values:

\[
I = 3000 \times 0.105 \times 0.5
\]

First, calculate \( 0.105 \times 0.5 = 0.0525 \). Then, multiply by the principal:

\[
I = 3000 \times 0.0525 = 157.50
\]

Thus, the interest Mr. Kirk has to pay is **$157.50**. The correct option is:

I: $157.50

Answer: I
