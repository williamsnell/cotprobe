Question:

Discuss the establishment of a new species of plant or animalby the theory of isolation.

Options:

A: New species arise when there is a complete genetic overhaul due to a cataclysmic event.
B: New species of animals and plants may arise because some physical separation discontinues the distribution of a species for long periods of time, leading to independent evolution and divergence in their gene pools, ultimately causing two new distinct species to arise.
C: New species develop when an existing species is exposed to radiation or chemical pollutants.
D: New species are formed when individuals of a species adapt to different diets within the same environment.
E: New species evolve when an existing species undergoes a sudden mutation.
F: New species evolve when members of a species travel to space and undergo genetic changes due to cosmic radiation.
G: New species arise due to cross-breeding between existing species.
H: New species emerge exclusively through the process of artificial selection by humans.
I: New species originate when a species' habitat is destroyed, forcing them to adapt to a new habitat or die out.
J: New species are created through human intervention and genetic modification.

Okay, so I have this biology question about the establishment of new species, specifically through the theory of isolation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

I remember that species formation has to do with different mechanisms. There's the biological species concept, which says that species are groups of interbreeding organisms that can't produce fertile offspring with others. So, if a group gets isolated and can't breed with the rest, they might form a new species.

The question is about the theory of isolation. So isolation must be a key factor here. There are types of isolationâ€”geographic, reproductive, etc. Geographic isolation is when a physical barrier splits a species into two groups. Over time, they evolve differently because they're in different environments, maybe with different selection pressures.

Looking at the options:

Option A talks about a complete genetic overhaul due to a cataclysmic event. That sounds more like a punctuated equilibrium idea, not isolation. Plus, it's a sudden change, but isolation is more gradual.

Option B says new species arise because physical separation stops the species distribution for a long time, leading to independent evolution. That fits with geographic isolation. The gene pools diverge and form two new species. This seems correct.

Option C is about radiation or chemicals. That's more mutation or maybe environmental pressures, not isolation.

Option D: different diets in the same environment. That's ecological niches or maybe adaptive radiation, but not isolation. They're still in the same area, so they can potentially interbreed unless other factors prevent it.

Option E: sudden mutation. That's more like the mutation theory, not isolation. Plus, mutations usually have small effects, not big enough to create a new species on their own.

Option F: space travel and cosmic radiation. That's really out there. I don't think that's a standard mechanism for speciation. Maybe in science fiction, not biology.

Option G: cross-breeding between species. That's hybridization, which can sometimes lead to new species, but it's different from isolation. Also, the question is about isolation, so G isn't the answer.

Option H: artificial selection by humans. That's a factor, but it's more about selective breeding, not natural isolation leading to speciation.

Option I: habitat destruction forcing adaptation. That's more about environmental change and natural selection, not isolation. The destruction might cause isolation, but the option doesn't mention separation, just adaptation.

Option J: human intervention and genetic modification. Again, that's more direct human action, like genetic engineering, not the natural process of isolation.

So the best fit is option B. It correctly describes geographic isolation leading to independent evolution and the formation of new species.

The theory of isolation explains that new species can arise when physical separation disrupts the distribution of a species, leading to independent evolution. This divergence in their gene pools eventually results in two distinct species. Among the options provided, option B accurately describes this process.

B: New species of animals and plants may arise because some physical separation discontinues the distribution of a species for long periods of time, leading to independent evolution and divergence in their gene pools, ultimately causing two new distinct species to arise.
