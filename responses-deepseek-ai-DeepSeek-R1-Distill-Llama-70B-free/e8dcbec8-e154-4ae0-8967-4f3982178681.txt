The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the singing and chanting of songs from 1:00P. M. to 1:00A. M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, "We're number 1. . . we're number 1. " One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?

Options:

A: The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.
B: The ordinance is unjust as it discriminates against those who are not religious.
C: The ordinance is not fair because it only applies to two or more persons, thus single individuals can create noise without consequence.
D: The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.
E: The ordinance directly contradicts the students' right to celebrate their college's victory.
F: The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.
G: The ordinance is biased against persons who can't sing or chant religious songs.
H: The ordinance is invalid as it fails to consider the cultural importance of chanting and singing in a group.
I: The ordinance is not applicable because it was after a football game, a special occasion.
J: The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with an ordinance and its potential violations. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question describes a city ordinance that prohibits singing and chanting by two or more persons between 1 PM and 1 AM if the noise is audible off the premises. However, it exempts religious songs. Some college students were chanting "We're number 1..." after a football game, and they got arrested. Now, they're challenging the ordinance's constitutionality.

The question asks which argument would be their weakest. So, I need to find the argument that's least likely to succeed in court.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: The ordinance deprives liberty without due process because it's not related to a legitimate community interest. I think cities often regulate noise for public safety and peace, which are legitimate interests. So this might be a weak argument because the ordinance does relate to such interests.

Option B: The ordinance is unjust because it discriminates against non-religious people. This sounds like an equal protection argument, which could be stronger because it's treating religious and non-religious differently.

Option C: The ordinance isn't fair because it only applies to two or more persons. So singles can make noise. I'm not sure about this. The ordinance is about group noise, which can be louder. Maybe the city has a rational basis for targeting groups, so this argument might not be strong, but I'm not certain.

Option D: The ordinance denies equal protection by distinguishing religious singing from others. This is similar to B, but more specific. Courts might find this an impermissible content-based restriction under the First Amendment, so this is a strong argument.

Option E: The ordinance contradicts the right to celebrate. I don't think there's a constitutional right to celebrate in a way that disturbs the peace. This seems like a weak argument because the right to celebrate isn't absolute and can be regulated for public order.

Option F: The ordinance violates freedom of expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This is a strong argument because content-based restrictions on speech are typically subject to strict scrutiny. The exemption for religious songs might make it content-based, which is problematic.

Option G: The ordinance is biased against those who can't sing religious songs. This seems similar to D and B, but maybe less directly about equal protection. It's a weaker argument because it's more about inability rather than the content itself.

Option H: The ordinance ignores cultural importance of group chanting. Cultural importance alone might not override a city's noise regulations. This could be a weak argument because cities can regulate noise even if it's culturally significant.

Option I: The ordinance doesn't apply because it was after a football game, a special occasion. I don't think ordinances typically have exceptions for special events unless specified. So this argument is probably weak.

Option J: The language is vague and overbroad. If the ordinance is too broad, it could infringe on protected speech. Vagueness and overbreadth are valid constitutional challenges, so this is a strong argument.

Now, the question is which is the weakest argument. Looking through, E seems weak because the right to celebrate isn't a recognized constitutional right that would override a valid noise ordinance. Similarly, I is also weak because special occasions don't automatically exempt from laws unless the law says so.

Between E and I, which is weaker? E says it contradicts the right to celebrate. I don't think the Constitution recognizes such a right, so E is a very weak argument. I says it's a special occasion, but ordinances usually apply regardless unless there's an exception. So both E and I are weak, but maybe E is weaker because there's no constitutional right to celebrate.

Alternatively, looking at option C: it applies only to two or more. The ordinance is about group noise. The city might have a rational basis for regulating group noise more strictly than individual noise, as groups are likely louder. So the argument that it's unfair to single individuals might not hold much water. So C is a weak argument.

Wait, so the weakest argument would be one that's clearly without merit. So which of these options presents an argument that's not supported by law?

Option E argues that the ordinance contradicts the right to celebrate, which is not a recognized constitutional right. The First Amendment protects certain types of expression, but not all forms of celebration. So E is a weak argument because there's no such right.

Similarly, option C argues about single individuals, but the ordinance might reasonably target group noise, which is more disruptive. So that argument might not be strong either.

So, considering all, the weakest arguments would be E and I, but E is about a non-existent right, making it weaker.

Wait, another angle: the question asks for the weakest argument against the ordinance. So, which argument is least likely to succeed.

Option E is that the ordinance directly contradicts the students' right to celebrate. There's no constitutional right to celebrate, so this argument is very weak. So the weakest argument is E.

Alternatively, option C is about the ordinance applying only to two or more persons. But the city might have a rational basis for that, as group chanting is generally louder and more disruptive. So the argument that it's unfair to single individuals is weak because the distinction is rationally related to the noise level, which is a legitimate government interest.

So between E and C, which is weaker? E is weaker because it's based on a nonexistent right, whereas C is based on an equal protection argument, albeit a weak one.

So the weakest argument is E.

The question involves a city ordinance prohibiting singing and chanting by two or more persons between 1:00 PM and 1:00 AM if the noise is audible off the premises, with an exemption for religious songs. College students were arrested for chanting "We're number 1..." after a football game, and they now challenge the ordinance's constitutionality. The task is to identify the weakest argument against the ordinance.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A:** Argues the ordinance deprives liberty without due process because it is unrelated to a legitimate community interest. This is weak because noise regulations are typically tied to legitimate interests like public peace and safety.

- **Option B:** Claims the ordinance is unjust because it discriminates against non-religious individuals. This is a stronger argument, as it raises equal protection concerns due to the religious exemption.

- **Option C:** Argues the ordinance is unfair because it applies only to two or more persons, allowing single individuals to create noise without consequences. While this is a weak argument, the city may have a rational basis for targeting group noise, which is often louder and more disruptive.

- **Option D:** Alleges the ordinance denies equal protection by distinguishing between religious and non-religious singing. This is a strong argument, as content-based restrictions on speech are subject to strict scrutiny.

- **Option E:** Claims the ordinance contradicts the students' right to celebrate. This is a very weak argument because there is no recognized constitutional right to celebrate that would override a valid noise ordinance.

- **Option F:** Argues the ordinance violates freedom of expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This is a strong argument, as content-based restrictions on speech are typically scrutinized heavily.

- **Option G:** Suggests the ordinance is biased against those who cannot sing religious songs. This is a weaker argument compared to others, as it focuses on inability rather than content-based discrimination.

- **Option H:** Argues the ordinance ignores the cultural importance of group chanting. This is weak because cultural significance alone does not override legitimate noise regulations.

- **Option I:** Claims the ordinance does not apply because it was after a football game, a special occasion. This is weak because ordinances generally apply regardless of the occasion unless explicitly exempted.

- **Option J:** Argues the ordinance is vague and overbroad. This is a strong argument, as vagueness and overbreadth are valid constitutional challenges.

**Conclusion:** The weakest argument is **Option E**, as it is based on a nonexistent constitutional right to celebrate. While other arguments, such as Option C, are also weak, Option E is the least likely to succeed because it lacks any constitutional basis.

**Answer:** E
