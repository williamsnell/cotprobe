Okay, so I've got this problem about graph theory and Ramsey numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is: what's the smallest n such that if you color the edges of a complete graph with n vertices using two colors, red and blue, you're guaranteed to have either a red 4-clique or a blue 4-clique. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, right, Ramsey numbers. I remember that Ramsey numbers tell us the minimum number of vertices required to ensure a certain structure appears, regardless of how you color the edges. The classical Ramsey number R(s, t) is the smallest n such that any red-blue edge coloring of K_n contains a red K_s or a blue K_t.

In this question, we're looking for R(4,4), I think. Because we need a 4-clique in red or a 4-clique in blue. So I'm trying to remember what R(4,4) is.

I recall that R(3,3) is 6. That's the classic party problem where either three people all know each other or three don't. But what about R(4,4)? I think it's higher. Let me think about the known Ramsey numbers.

Wait, I remember that R(4,4) is 18. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me think. There's a formula for some cases, but exact Ramsey numbers are rare. For example, R(s,t) where s=4 and t=4.

Wait, the known Ramsey numbers: R(1, n) is just 2, trivial. R(2, n) is n+1. R(3,3)=6, R(3,4)=9, I think. R(3,5)=14 maybe? Wait, no, R(3,5) is 14? Or is that R(4,4)?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general approach. The Ramsey number R(m, m) is the smallest n such that any 2-coloring of K_n contains a monochromatic K_m.

I've heard that R(4,4) is 18. So if n is 18, any red-blue coloring will have either a red K4 or a blue K4.

But wait, let's double-check. Because sometimes I confuse it. So R(3,3)=6, R(4,4)=18, R(5,5)=... I don't think that's known exactly, but R(4,4) is 18, so the answer here would be 18. So looking at the options, J is 18. So the answer would be J.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers. I think R(4,4)=18 might be correct. Let me think about the reasoning. For lower numbers, like n=17, perhaps you can color the edges in such a way to avoid a 4-clique in either color. But at 18, it's impossible.

So the question is, what's the smallest n where this is guaranteed. So the answer should be 18, which is option J.

The problem involves determining the smallest number \( n \) such that any red-blue edge coloring of a complete graph \( K_n \) guarantees the existence of either a red 4-clique or a blue 4-clique. This is related to Ramsey numbers, specifically \( R(4,4) \), which is the smallest \( n \) for which any 2-coloring of \( K_n \) contains a monochromatic \( K_4 \).

Known Ramsey numbers include \( R(3,3) = 6 \), and it is established that \( R(4,4) = 18 \). This means that for \( n = 18 \), any red-blue edge coloring of \( K_{18} \) will necessarily contain either a red \( K_4 \) or a blue \( K_4 \). For \( n = 17 \), it is possible to color the edges in a way that avoids a monochromatic \( K_4 \), but this is no longer possible for \( n = 18 \).

Thus, the smallest \( n \) that guarantees a monochromatic 4-clique in either red or blue is 18, corresponding to option J.

Answer: J
