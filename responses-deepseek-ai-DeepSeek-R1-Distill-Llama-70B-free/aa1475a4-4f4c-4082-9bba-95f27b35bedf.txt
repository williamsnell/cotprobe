Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Pledge of Allegiance, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Pledge of Allegiance is a well-known statement in the United States, often recited in schools and various events. I've heard it many times before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact wording, especially the ending.

I think the Pledge starts with "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America..." Then it goes on to mention something about one nation. Wait, does it say "under God" or not? I think that's part of it, but maybe that's optional or added later. Anyway, after that, I believe it mentions "liberty and justice for all."

So putting that together, the last part would be "liberty and justice for all." Therefore, the final word should be "all." Let me check the options given. 

Looking at the options, option B is "all," which would be the last word. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing it with another part. Sometimes, people might think the last word is "flag," but no, that's earlier in the pledge. 

Wait, another thought: I think the original version didn't include "under God," but it was added later. So the structure is: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all. So the very end is "justice for all," making "all" the last word.

So the options are A: unity, B: all, C: indivisible, D: allegiance, E: America, F: justice, G: liberty, H: stands, I: flag, J: one.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: all.
