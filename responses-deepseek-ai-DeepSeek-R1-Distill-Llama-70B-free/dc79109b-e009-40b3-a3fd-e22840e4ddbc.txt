Okay, so I have this problem about a cylindrical container and I need to find the dimensions that minimize the total cost. Hmm, let's see. The capacity is 10 cubic feet. The top and bottom are made of material costing $2 per square foot, and the side is $1.50 per square foot.

Wait, so the container is a cylinder, which has two circles (top and bottom) and a rectangle when unwrapped (the side). But the cost for the top and bottom is different from the side.

I think I should model this with some equations. Let's denote the radius as r and the height as h.

First, the volume of the cylinder is V = πr²h. Since the capacity is 10, πr²h = 10. That's one equation.

Now, the cost. The top and bottom each have an area of πr². So combined, their area is 2πr². Each costs $2, so total cost for top and bottom is 2 * (2πr²) = 4πr²? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the top and bottom each cost $2 per square foot. So the cost for each is 2 * πr², and since there are two, the total is 2 * (2πr²) = 4πr²? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

No, wait, maybe it's simpler. The area of top and bottom together is 2 * πr². Each square foot of that area costs $2, so the total cost for top and bottom is 2 * (πr²) * 2. Because each has area πr², so two of them make 2πr². Multiply by $2 per sq ft: 2πr² * 2 = 4πr². Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, no. Wait, the cost is $2 per square foot. The area is 2πr². So cost for top and bottom is 2πr² * 2 = $4πr².

Wait, no, wait. No, the total area is 2πr² (since two circles). Each square foot costs $2, so total is 2 * (2πr²) = 4πr²? Or is it 2πr² * 2? Wait, no. Let me think again. Each of the two circles has area πr². Each costs $2 per sq ft. So each circle costs 2 * πr². Two circles: 2 * (2πr²) = 4πr². So top and bottom cost 4πr² dollars.

Wait, no, wait. No, that's not correct. Because the problem says the top and bottom are made of material costing $2 per square foot. So each has area πr². So the cost for top is $2 * πr², same for bottom. So total is 2*(2πr²) = 4πr². Hmm, maybe that's correct.

Then the side is a rectangle when unwrapped. Its area is circumference times height, which is 2πr * h. The cost is $1.50 per square foot, so the cost for the side is 1.5 * (2πr h) = 3πr h.

So total cost C is 4πr² + 3πr h.

But we have the volume constraint: πr² h = 10 → h = 10/(πr²).

Substituting h into the cost equation:

C(r) = 4πr² + 3πr * (10/(πr²)).

Simplify that. Let's compute each term.

The second term: 3πr * (10/(πr²)) = (3πr * 10) / (π r²) → The π cancels, r cancels one r in denominator.

So 3 * 10 / r → 30 / r.

So the cost function becomes C(r) = 4πr² + 30/r.

Now, to minimize C with respect to r, we take derivative and set to zero.

Compute dC/dr:

dC/dr = 8πr - 30 / r².

Set to zero: 8πr - 30/(r²) = 0.

Multiply both sides by r² to eliminate denominator:

8π r^3 - 30 = 0 → 8π r^3 = 30 → r^3 = 30/(8π) → r^3 = (15)/(4π) → r = cube root of (15/(4π)).

Let me compute that. Let me calculate 15/(4π):

15 is approximately 15. 4π is about 12.566. So 15/12.566 ≈ 1.194. So cube root of 1.194 is about 1.06 feet. So r ≈ 1.061 feet. Then h is 10/(π r²). Let's compute r squared: (1.061)^2 ≈ 1.126. So π * 1.126 ≈ 3.54. So h ≈ 10 / 3.54 ≈ 2.825, which is approximately 2.828 feet.

Looking at the options, option A says radius 1.061 and height 2.828. That's what I got. So the answer should be A.

To determine the dimensions that minimize the total cost of the cylindrical container, we start by defining the radius as \( r \) and the height as \( h \). The volume constraint is given by:

\[
\pi r^2 h = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \frac{10}{\pi r^2}.
\]

The total cost \( C \) includes the cost of the top and bottom (each costing $2 per square foot) and the side (costing $1.50 per square foot). The areas are as follows:

- Top and bottom combined: \( 2 \pi r^2 \), with a total cost of \( 2 \cdot 2 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi r^2 \).
- Side: \( 2 \pi r h \), with a total cost of \( 1.5 \cdot 2 \pi r h = 3 \pi r h \).

Thus, the total cost function is:

\[
C(r) = 4 \pi r^2 + 3 \pi r h.
\]

Substituting \( h = \frac{10}{\pi r^2} \) into the cost function:

\[
C(r) = 4 \pi r^2 + \frac{30}{r}.
\]

To minimize \( C(r) \), we take the derivative with respect to \( r \):

\[
\frac{dC}{dr} = 8 \pi r - \frac{30}{r^2}.
\]

Setting \( \frac{dC}{dr} = 0 \) gives:

\[
8 \pi r - \frac{30}{r^2} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 \pi r^3 = 30 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r^3 = \frac{30}{8 \pi} = \frac{15}{4 \pi}.
\]

Solving for \( r \):

\[
r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{15}{4 \pi}}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{15}{4 \pi} \approx 1.194 \), we find \( r \approx \sqrt[3]{1.194} \approx 1.061 \, \text{feet} \).

Using the volume constraint to find \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{10}{\pi r^2} = \frac{10}{\pi (1.061)^2}.
\]

Approximating \( (1.061)^2 \approx 1.126 \), we find:

\[
h \approx \frac{10}{\pi \cdot 1.126} \approx \frac{10}{3.54} \approx 2.828 \, \text{feet}.
\]

Thus, the dimensions that minimize the total cost are approximately \( r = 1.061 \, \text{feet} \) and \( h = 2.828 \, \text{feet} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
