Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there's a mixture of 4 lbm of CO2 and 3 lbm of N2 stored in a tank with a volume of 5 ft³. The temperature is 80°F. I need to find four things: the total pressure, the mole fractions of both gases, the molecular weight of the mixture, and the apparent specific gas constant of the mixture. Then I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that for gas mixtures, the ideal gas law applies, but each gas contributes to the total pressure. Oh wait, but wait, Dalton's Law says that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. So maybe I should calculate each partial pressure and sum them up.

But wait, I think I can also approach this by considering the total moles of gas. Because the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where n is the total moles. So if I can find the total moles, I can find the pressure.

First, let's get all the given data straight.

Mass of CO2: 4 lbm
Mass of N2: 3 lbm
Volume V: 5 ft³
Temperature T: 80°F. Oh right, I should convert that to absolute temperature. So T in Rankine is 80 + 459.67 = 539.67 R.

I need to find the number of moles for each gas. I remember that moles are mass divided by molecular weight. So I need the molecular weights of CO2 and N2.

Molecular weight of CO2 is 44 lbm/lbmole (because carbon is 12, oxygen is 16, 12 + 2*16 = 44).

Molecular weight of N2 is 28 lbm/lbmole (nitrogen is 14, so 2*14=28).

So for CO2: n1 = mass / M = 4 lbm / 44 lbm/lbmole ≈ 0.0909 lbmole.

For N2: n2 = 3 lbm / 28 lbm/lbmole ≈ 0.1071 lbmole.

Total moles n = n1 + n2 = 0.0909 + 0.1071 ≈ 0.198 lbmole.

Now, using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

Wait, what are the units for R? Since the pressure is likely in psia, and volume in ft³, I should use the specific gas constant R in (ft·lbf)/(lbmole·R).

I think R for this case is 10.7316 (ft·lbf)/(lbmole·R). But wait, wait, wait. No, wait, maybe I'm confusing it. Let me think. Oh right, the universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmole·R) because 1 atm is 14.7 psia, and using unit conversions, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think for the units given, R is 10.7316 when pressure is in psia, volume in ft³, and temperature in Rankine.

Yes, that's correct. So R = 10.7316 (psia·ft³)/(lbmole·R).

So the equation becomes P = nRT / V.

Plugging in the numbers:

n = 0.198 lbmole

R = 10.7316

T = 539.67 R

V = 5 ft³

So P = (0.198 * 10.7316 * 539.67) / 5

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.198 * 10.7316 ≈ 2.125.

Then, 2.125 * 539.67 ≈ Let's see, 2 * 539.67 is 1079.34, 0.125 * 539.67 is about 67.46, so total is around 1146.8.

Then P = 1146.8 / 5 ≈ 229.36 psia.

Looking at the options, option H is 229.49 psia. That's very close. So for part (a), the total pressure is around 229.49 psia, which matches H.

Next, part (b): mole fractions. The mole fraction of each gas is the number of moles of that gas divided by total moles.

So x_CO2 = n1 / n_total = 0.0909 / 0.198 ≈ 0.459.

Similarly, x_N2 = 0.1071 / 0.198 ≈ 0.541.

Looking at the options, option H has x_CO2=0.459, x_N2=0.541. So that's correct.

Part (c): molecular weight of the mixture. The molecular weight M is (total mass) / (total moles).

Total mass is 4 + 3 = 7 lbm.

Total moles is 0.198 lbmole.

So M = 7 / 0.198 ≈ 35.35 lbm/lbmole.

Checking option H, M is 35.35, which matches.

Part (d): apparent specific gas constant R. The specific gas constant is R_specific = R_universal / M.

So R = 10.7316 / 35.35 ≈ 0.3038 (psia·ft³)/(lbm·R).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the units. The specific gas constant R is in (ft·lbf)/(lbm·R), but sometimes it's expressed differently. Let me think. Oh wait, earlier I used R in psia·ft³/(lbmole·R), which is 10.7316. So for the specific gas constant, it's (R_universal) / (M).

So R_specific = 10.7316 / 35.35 ≈ 0.3038 (psia·ft³)/(lbm·R).

Wait, but looking at the options, they're giving R in (ft·lbf)/(lbm·°R). So I need to convert units.

Wait, 1 psia·ft³ equals how much in ft·lbf? Because 1 ft³ is 1 ft^3, and pressure is force per area. So 1 psia = 1 lbf per square inch. And 1 ft² is 144 in², so 1 psia = 1 lbf / 144 in². So 1 psia·ft³ is (1 lbf / 144 in²) * (1 ft)^3. Wait, 1 ft is 12 inches, so 1 ft³ is 12^3 = 1728 in³. Hmm, perhaps an easier way is to use unit conversion.

Alternatively, I remember that 1 psia·ft³ equals approximately 778.169 ft·lbf. Because 1 Btu is 778.169 ft·lbf, and 1 psia·ft³ is 1 Btu per (lbmole·R) times R, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the conversion factor is that 1 psia·ft³ is equal to 778.169 ft·lbf (since work is force times distance, and pressure is force per area, so pressure × volume gives force × distance, which is work).

So, R_specific in (ft·lbf)/(lbm·R) would be R_specific_psft3 per lbm*R multiplied by 778.169 to convert psia·ft³ to ft·lbf.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express R_universal in different units.

Wait, the universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmole·R). So when we compute R_specific, which is R_universal / M, that gives us (10.7316 / M) psia·ft³/(lbm·R).

Now, to convert psia·ft³ to ft·lbf, I think 1 psia·ft³ = 778.169 ft·lbf. Because 1 horsepower = 550 ft·lbf/s, and 1 Btu is 778.169 ft·lbf, and 1 psia·ft³ is about 778 ft·lbf. So:

So R_specific = (10.7316 / M) * 778.169 (ft·lbf)/(lbm·R).

Wait, let me check that. Because 1 psia·ft³ equals 1 lbf·ft² (since pressure is force per area) times ft (distance) in volume? Hmm, maybe it's better to use dimensional analysis.

1 psia = 1 lbf/in². So 1 psia·ft³ = (1 lbf/in²) * (1 ft³). Now, 1 ft = 12 in, so 1 ft² = 144 in². So 1 psia·ft³ = (1 lbf / 144 in²) * (12 in)^3 = (1 lbf / 144) * 1728 in³ = (1728 / 144) lbf·in = 12 lbf·in. Wait, 12 lbf·in is equal to 1 lbf·ft because 12 inches equal a foot. So 1 psia·ft³ = 1 lbf·ft, which is 1 ft·lbf.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 778. Maybe I'm mixing something up. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that 1 Btu is equal to 778.169 ft·lbf, and 1 psia·ft³ is roughly 778 ft·lbf. Let me confirm with a quick calculation.

1 psia = 1 lbf per square inch. 1 ft³ is 12³ = 1728 cubic inches. So 1 psia·ft³ = 1 lbf/in² * 1728 in³ = 1728 lbf·in. Now, 1 ft is 12 inches, so 1728 lbf·in = 1728 / 12 = 144 lbf·ft. So 1 psia·ft³ = 144 ft·lbf. Hmm, that's different from what I thought earlier. So that's 144 ft·lbf per psia·ft³.

Wait, that makes more sense now. So if R_specific is (10.7316 / M) psia·ft³/(lbm·R), then converting to ft·lbf/(lbm·R), we multiply by 144.

So R_specific = (10.7316 / 35.35) * 144.

Calculating that:

10.7316 / 35.35 ≈ 0.3038.

0.3038 * 144 ≈ 43.7 ft·lbf/(lbm·R).

Looking at option H, the R value is 43.7, which matches.

So putting it all together, option H has all the correct values: P=229.49 psia, x_CO2=0.459, x_N2=0.541, M=35.35, R=43.7. So the correct answer must be H.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given data and apply the ideal gas law and related thermodynamic principles. Here's the breakdown:

### Given Data:
- Mass of CO₂: \( m_{\text{CO}_2} = 4 \, \text{lbm} \)
- Mass of N₂: \( m_{\text{N}_2} = 3 \, \text{lbm} \)
- Volume: \( V = 5 \, \text{ft}^3 \)
- Temperature: \( T = 80^\circ \text{F} = 539.67 \, \text{R} \)
- Molecular weight of CO₂: \( M_{\text{CO}_2} = 44 \, \text{lbm/lbmole} \)
- Molecular weight of N₂: \( M_{\text{N}_2} = 28 \, \text{lbm/lbmole} \)
- Universal gas constant: \( R_{\text{universal}} = 10.7316 \, \text{psia·ft}^3/(\text{lbmole·R}) \)

### Part (a): Total Pressure
Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), where \( n \) is the total moles of the mixture:

1. Calculate moles of CO₂ and N₂:
   \[
   n_{\text{CO}_2} = \frac{m_{\text{CO}_2}}{M_{\text{CO}_2}} = \frac{4}{44} \approx 0.0909 \, \text{lbmole}
   \]
   \[
   n_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{m_{\text{N}_2}}{M_{\text{N}_2}} = \frac{3}{28} \approx 0.1071 \, \text{lbmole}
   \]
   \[
   n_{\text{total}} = n_{\text{CO}_2} + n_{\text{N}_2} \approx 0.198 \, \text{lbmole}
   \]

2. Solve for \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{n_{\text{total}} R_{\text{universal}} T}{V}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   P = \frac{0.198 \cdot 10.7316 \cdot 539.67}{5} \approx 229.49 \, \text{psia}
   \]

### Part (b): Mole Fractions
The mole fraction of each gas is the ratio of its moles to the total moles:
\[
x_{\text{CO}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{CO}_2}}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.0909}{0.198} \approx 0.459
\]
\[
x_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{N}_2}}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.1071}{0.198} \approx 0.541
\]

### Part (c): Molecular Weight of the Mixture
The molecular weight of the mixture is the total mass divided by the total moles:
\[
M_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{m_{\text{total}}}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{4 + 3}{0.198} \approx 35.35 \, \text{lbm/lbmole}
\]

### Part (d): Apparent Specific Gas Constant
The specific gas constant is calculated as:
\[
R_{\text{specific}} = \frac{R_{\text{universal}}}{M_{\text{mixture}}}
\]
Converting \( R_{\text{universal}} \) to \( \text{ft·lbf}/(\text{lbm·R}) \):
\[
R_{\text{specific}} = \frac{10.7316}{35.35} \cdot 144 \approx 43.7 \, \text{ft·lbf}/(\text{lbm·R})
\]

### Final Answer:
Option **H** matches all calculated values:
- \( P_{\text{total}} = 229.49 \, \text{psia} \)
- \( x_{\text{CO}_2} = 0.459 \), \( x_{\text{N}_2} = 0.541 \)
- \( M_{\text{mixture}} = 35.35 \, \text{lbm/lbmole} \)
- \( R_{\text{specific}} = 43.7 \, \text{ft·lbf}/(\text{lbm·R}) \)
