C: perceptual adaptation
D: summation
E: perceptual set
F: sensory interaction
G: binocular cue
H: depth perception
I: shape constancy
J: autokinetic effect

Okay, so I've got this question here about Tina and the space shuttle. Hmm, let's see. The question is about why she had trouble recognizing the space shuttle when she saw it flying after seeing a picture of it ready to launch. I need to figure out which psychological concept explains this.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the scenario. The first time Tina saw the space shuttle, it was in a picture ready to launch. Then, she saw another picture of it flying, but she didn't recognize it easily. So what's different between the two situations?

Wait, maybe it's about perception. She saw it in one context and then another, and that affected her recognition. I remember something about how our past experiences and expectations influence perception. Oh, like perceptual set! That's when your expectations or past experiences shape what you perceive. So if she first saw the shuttle in a launch setting, she might have expected it to look a certain way. Then, when it's in a different position or context, like flying, her brain isn't prepared for that image, making it harder to recognize.

Let me think about the other options to make sure. Sensory adaptation is when you stop noticing a stimulus because you're exposed to it for a long time. That doesn't fit here because it's about two different instances, not continuous exposure. Perceptual adaptation might be similar, but I'm not too sure about that term. Dishabituation is when a stimulus that was ignored becomes noticed again, which doesn't seem relevant.

What about the other choices? Summation is a term I think I've heard in neuroscience, maybe related to how neurons fire when signals add up. Not relevant here. Sensory interaction could be about how different senses work together, but again, this is about visual perception in different contexts.

Binocular cues and depth perception are about how we perceive 3D, which doesn't explain the recognition issue. Shape constancy is when objects look the same even if their shape on the retina changes, like a circle seen at an angle looks like an oval. Wait, the space shuttle's shape might change when it's moving, but would that affect recognition? Maybe, but I think the main issue here is more about expectation and context.

Autokinetic effect is when a stationary point appears to move, which isn't the case here. So I'm leaning towards perceptual set. Because Tina's initial exposure set her expectation, so when the shuttle was in a different state, she struggled to recognize it.

The question revolves around why Tina had difficulty recognizing the space shuttle when she saw it flying after initially seeing it ready to launch. This can be explained by the concept of **perceptual set**, which refers to how our past experiences, expectations, and context influence perception. Tina's initial exposure to the space shuttle in a launch setting likely shaped her expectations, making it harder for her to recognize it in a different context, such as flying.

Analyzing the options:
- **Sensory adaptation** and **perceptual adaptation** involve changes in sensitivity or perception over time, which don't fit this scenario.
- **Dishabituation** refers to renewed attention to a previously ignored stimulus, which is irrelevant here.
- **Summation** pertains to neural signaling and is unrelated.
- **Sensory interaction** involves multiple senses working together, which isn't applicable.
- **Binocular cues** and **depth perception** relate to 3D vision, not recognition in different contexts.
- **Shape constancy** involves recognizing objects despite retinal changes, but the issue here is more about contextual expectation.
- **Autokinetic effect** involves perceived movement of stationary objects, which isn't relevant.

Thus, the best explanation is **perceptual set**, as Tina's initial exposure influenced her expectations, affecting her ability to recognize the space shuttle in a new context.
