Question:

What is the rationale of subtracting expenditures for im-ports in measuring aggregate demand as compared to adding exports as a new component of aggregate demand?

Options:

A: Exports represent spending on foreign goods
B: Imports represent spending on foreign goods inducing production abroad, while exports increase domestic production and create jobs.
C: Exports represent a transfer of domestic wealth to foreign entities
D: Expenditures for imports and exports are both added in measuring aggregate demand
E: Exports are subtracted because they represent an outflow of domestic currency
F: Imports are not significant to the economy, whereas exports are the main driver of economic growth
G: Imports are investments in foreign markets, and exports are considered a form of savings
H: Imports and exports are considered equal and cancel each other out in aggregate demand
I: Imports increase domestic production
J: Imports represent domestic consumption, and exports are deducted to avoid double counting in GDP calculations

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this economics question about aggregate demand and why we subtract imports but add exports. Hmm, I remember that aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an economy. It includes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). 

Wait, why do we add exports and subtract imports? Let me think. Exports are goods produced domestically but sold abroad, so they add to the demand because they're part of what's being produced. On the other hand, imports are goods bought from other countries, which means that the spending on imports doesn't go towards domestic production. So when we calculate aggregate demand, we subtract imports because they represent spending that's not contributing to our own economy's demand.

Looking at the question again, it's asking why we subtract imports and add exports. So the rationale must be about where the spending is directed. Imports lead to spending that's outside the country, so we subtract them because they don't contribute to domestic demand. Exports are added because they contribute to domestic production and employment.

Let me look at the options. Option B says imports represent spending on foreign goods, inducing production abroad, while exports increase domestic production and jobs. That makes sense. Because when you import, you're buying foreign stuff, which boosts their economy, not yours. Exports are your goods being bought by others, which means your economy produces more, creates jobs, etc.

Another option could be J, which talks about imports as domestic consumption and exports being deducted to avoid double counting in GDP. Wait, no, I think GDP includes exports as part of the total production. So in aggregate demand, which is about spending, we add exports because they are a component of demand, and subtract imports because they're a leakage from the domestic circular flow.

So the correct answer should be B. Because imports take spending away from the domestic economy, while exports add to it.

The rationale for subtracting imports and adding exports in measuring aggregate demand lies in their impact on the domestic economy. Exports are goods and services produced domestically but sold abroad, increasing domestic production and creating jobs. Imports, however, represent spending on foreign goods, which induces production abroad rather than at home. Subtracting imports ensures that only spending contributing to domestic demand is counted, while adding exports reflects their positive impact on the economy.

Answer: B
