Okay, so I've got this question about Turing machines and decidable problems. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

The question is about a deterministic Turing machine M with a tape alphabet of blank, 0, and 1. It starts with a blank tape, and we're looking at the computation C, which could be infinite. The input to each problem is M and a positive integer n. We need to determine which of the problems I, II, III are decidable.

Let's go through each problem.

Problem I: The computation C lasts for at least n steps. So, does this mean we can decide whether M will run for n steps or more? Well, I remember that the halting problem is undecidable, but this isn't exactly the same. Because even if the machine doesn't halt, it might run for n steps. Wait, but how can we know if it will reach step n?

Wait, but for any given n, we can simulate M step by step up to n steps. If it halts before, then we know it doesn't last n steps. If it hasn't halted by n steps, then yes, it does last at least n steps. Since n is finite, simulation is possible. So, problem I is decidable. Because for any M and n, we can simulate up to n steps and see. So I is decidable.

Problem II: The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step. So two conditions here: run beyond n steps, and write a 1 after step n. Hmm, is this decidable?

So first, we need to check if M runs beyond n steps. If it stops before, then condition fails. If it runs beyond, we need to check if it ever writes a 1 after step n. But wait, after step n, it could run infinitely without ever writing a 1. How can we check that?

Hmm, but the problem is whether such a 1 is ever printed after step n. If M is in an infinite loop where it keeps moving without writing a 1, then it won't satisfy the condition. But how can we determine that?

Wait, but the machine's behavior is deterministic. So, after step n, we can simulate M step by step, checking each step to see if it writes a 1. But wait, the machine could run forever without writing a 1, so our simulation might not terminate. So, if we simulate beyond step n, but for how long? There's no bound. So, it's possible that we can't decide this because we don't know when to stop.

Alternatively, maybe we can find a way to determine if M will ever print a 1 after step n. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this is undecidable because it's equivalent to some other undecidable problem.

Wait, but another approach: the first part (running at least n steps) is decidable. The second part (printing a 1 after n steps) is also a condition we can check, but how? Because after step n, M could take an infinite time before printing a 1, or never print it. So, how can we decide that?

So, for problem II, if M doesn't run beyond n steps, the answer is no. If it does run beyond, we need to check if it ever prints a 1 after that. But since the machine might run forever without printing, we can't know for sure. So, problem II is undecidable.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe there's a smarter way. Since the machine is deterministic, after step n, the machine is in some state and has a certain tape configuration. From there, maybe we can determine if it will ever print a 1. But I don't remember any specific theorems about that. It feels like this could be undecidable because it's similar to the problem of whether a machine will ever output a certain symbol, which I think is undecidable.

So, problem II is undecidable.

Problem III: M scans at least n distinct tape squares during computation C. So, we need to determine if the machine uses at least n cells on the tape during its computation.

Hmm, how can we approach this? Well, a deterministic Turing machine on a blank tape will have its head start at the initial position. The machine can move left or right, and each step it can read/write.

If the machine's head never moves beyond a certain number of cells, then the number of scanned cells is finite. But if the machine's head moves indefinitely in one or both directions, then the number of scanned cells is infinite.

Wait, but for a given n, we can simulate the machine until it either uses n cells or halts. If it halts before using n cells, then the answer is no. If during the simulation, it uses n cells, then yes. But what if it runs forever without using n cells? Wait, can that happen?

Wait, no. Because if the machine runs forever without using n cells, that would mean that it's using a finite number of cells, say, less than n. Because it can't keep moving beyond new cells forever without eventually reaching n. Wait, no. Because it could, say, oscillate between a finite number of cells. For example, move right, then left, right, left, etc., without ever going beyond a certain point. So, in that case, it's scanning only a finite number of cells, say, 3 cells. So, if n is 5, then the answer would be no.

But how can we determine whether the machine will scan at least n cells? Because for some machines, they might scan more than n cells, but for others, they might not.

Wait, but for a given n, can we simulate the machine until it either halts (and count the cells used) or until it uses n cells? Because if we simulate step by step, each time the head moves to a new cell, we can count it.

So, during the simulation, each time the head moves to a new cell, we add to a counter. If the counter reaches n, then we return yes. If the machine halts before that, then we return no.

But wait, the problem is that the machine could run forever without ever reaching n cells. So, our simulation might run forever, never reaching a conclusion.

So, is there a way to decide this? Because for some machines, you might loop forever in a small area, while for others, they might eventually reach n cells.

Wait, but in finite steps, how can we know whether the machine will ever reach n cells? It's possible that the machine will oscillate between, say, two cells, never moving beyond. So, in that case, the number of scanned cells is 2, which is less than n if n is 3.

But how can we determine that? Because we can't simulate forever. So, perhaps problem III is undecidable as well.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because for problem I, we can simulate for n steps. For problem III, it's about the number of cells scanned. Let's think about this.

Suppose n is 5. We simulate the machine step by step. Each time the head moves to a new cell, we mark it as used. As soon as the count of used cells reaches 5, we return yes. If the machine halts before that, return no.

But what about machines that loop without ever using 5 cells. For example, a machine that just moves left and right between two cells. So, it will never reach 5 cells. But how can we know that it won't eventually go beyond? Because the machine's behavior is determined by its state and tape.

Wait, but in reality, if the machine enters a loop where it keeps moving between two cells without ever going beyond, then it's not going to use any new cells beyond that. So, for such a machine, the number of scanned cells is finite, say 2.

But how can we detect that in a simulation? Because we can't run the simulation forever. So, we can't know for sure after finite steps whether the machine will ever reach n cells.

So, perhaps problem III is also undecidable.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. There's a theorem called the "Tape Boundedness" problem. Let me think. The problem of whether a Turing machine uses more than a certain number of tape cells is decidable. Or is it?

Wait, I think it's similar to the problem of whether a machine will ever print a certain symbol. I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the number of cells used is a semidecidable property. That is, if the machine does use more than n cells, we can detect it by simulation, but if it doesn't, we can't be sure in finite time.

Hmm, no. Wait, what if the machine is in a loop that doesn't use any new cells beyond a certain point. Then, the total number of cells used is finite. So, for problem III, given M and n, the question is whether M's computation uses at least n cells.

But how can we determine whether M will ever use n cells? Because for some M, it might, but for others, it won't.

Wait, but for any given M and n, if M will ever use n cells, then in finite steps (specifically, when it reaches the nth cell), we can detect it. But if M never uses n cells, how can we know? Because the simulation might run forever without using n cells, and we can't wait forever.

So, problem III is only semidecidable. So, no algorithm can decide it in general. So, problem III is undecidable.

Wait, but wait another thought. The problem is whether during the computation, M scans at least n squares. So, M could either halt, having scanned some number of squares, or run forever, scanning possibly infinitely many squares.

If the computation is finite (i.e., M halts), then the number of scanned squares is finite. So, if M halts, and the number is >=n, then yes. Otherwise, no.

If the computation is infinite, then M must be scanning an infinite number of squares? No, wait. Because M could loop between a finite number of squares, like moving back and forth without ever going beyond. So, the number of scanned squares could be finite even in an infinite computation.

So, for problem III, to determine whether the number of scanned squares is >=n.

So, when M's computation is finite: we can simulate until it halts, count the squares, and compare to n.

When M's computation is infinite: we need to determine if, in the infinite steps, the head visits at least n squares.

But how can we determine that? Because in the infinite case, M might be visiting finitely many squares in a loop, which would mean it doesn't reach n. Or it might be moving to new squares each time, which would imply it does reach n.

Wait, but how can we know? Because to know that, we'd have to determine whether the machine's head position will reach a new cell beyond n.

Hmm, I think this is tricky. I'm not sure, but maybe problem III is decidable.

Wait, no, because for some machines, it's impossible to decide. For example, a machine that, given n, might either loop between two cells or eventually move right to n+1. But without knowing, we can't decide.

Alternatively, perhaps problem III is decidable because you can simulate the machine and, for each new cell it visits, keep track. If within finite steps, it reaches n cells, then yes. If it's stuck in a loop without reaching n, then you can't know. But since the machine might run forever without using n cells, you can't decide.

Therefore, problem III is undecidable.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier thought. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, but I remember that the problem of whether a Turing machine will ever visit the nth cell on the tape is decidable. Because, for any machine, you can simulate it until it either visits the nth cell or until it's clear that it will never do so. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of cells a Turing machine can visit is at least n if and only if the machine does not loop forever within a finite number of cells. But how to determine that.

Wait, maybe it's possible. Because, for example, if the machine's head moves right forever, then it will visit infinitely many cells. So, for any n, it will visit n cells. Similarly, if it moves left forever.

But if the machine's head oscillates between two cells, then it will only visit 3 cells (the starting, one left, one right), assuming it never moves beyond that.

But how can we determine whether the machine will eventually move beyond a certain cell? Because, for a given n, if the machine's head ever moves beyond cell n in either direction, then it will have scanned >=n+1 cells.

Wait, but perhaps the head's movement is bounded. How can we know?

Alternatively, perhaps for any given n, we can simulate the machine until it either visits the nth cell or until it's clear that it won't.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think the problem is that without knowing the machine's behavior, we can't be certain. So, perhaps problem III is undecidable.

Wait, but another angle: the problem is similar to the halting problem. Because, the machine could be designed in a way that the number of cells it uses depends on an undecidable property. So, in that case, problem III would be undecidable.

But wait, problem I is decidable because we can simulate for n steps. So, perhaps problem III is also decidable because for any machine, if it uses n cells, it must do so in a finite number of steps. So, we can simulate until either the machine uses n cells (return yes) or until it halts (return no). Because if the machine runs forever without using n cells, it must be stuck in a loop using a finite number of cells less than n. So, the simulation can detect that?

Wait, no, because if the machine is running forever without using n cells, the simulation would run forever, and we wouldn't know when to stop. So, in that case, the problem is undecidable.

Wait, but how can we know when the machine is in a loop that doesn't use new cells beyond a certain point? Because the machine's behavior could be periodic. For example, the machine could have a cycle where it moves back and forth between two cells.

So, for problem III, the question is whether the number of distinct cells visited is at least n. So, if the machine is in a loop that doesn't visit new cells, then the count is finite, and if n is larger than that count, the answer is no. But how can we detect if the machine is in such a loop?

Hmm, perhaps we can't. Because we can't determine in general whether a machine will loop forever without using new cells. So, problem III is undecidable.

Wait, but wait another thought. The number of cells a Turing machine uses is either finite or infinite. So, in the case where the machine uses infinitely many cells, the answer to problem III is yes for any n. But if the machine uses finite cells, then for n larger than that number, the answer is no.

But how can we determine whether the machine uses an infinite number of cells? Because that's equivalent to determining whether the machine's head moves to infinity in either direction.

But I don't think that's decidable. Because it's similar to the halting problem. For example, a machine that decides whether another machine halts, and based on that, moves right forever or loops.

So, problem III is undecidable.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize.

Problem I: Can simulate for n steps. Decidable.

Problem II: After n steps, machine must print a 1. But can't be sure because the machine could run forever without printing. So II is undecidable.

Problem III: Whether the machine scans at least n cells. If the machine uses n cells, we can detect it. If it uses fewer, but halts, we can detect. But if it runs forever without using n cells, we can't detect in finite time. So, III is undecidable.

Wait, but problem III is about whether during the computation, at least n cells are scanned. So, if the machine's computation is finite, then the number is finite, and we can check. If it's infinite, then the number of cells could be finite or infinite.

Wait, but in an infinite computation, the machine could either scan infinitely many cells (like moving right forever) or only finite cells (like looping between two cells without exploring further). So, for problem III, if the machine's computation is infinite and it's scanning an infinite number of cells, then yes, it uses >=n cells. But if it's scanning a finite number, then depending on n, it may or may not.

So, how can we determine whether an infinite computation scans infinitely many cells?

Hmm.

Wait, I think that's the crux. If the computation is infinite, then either the machine's head visits infinitely many cells (so yes for any n), or it visits only finitely many (so no if n is larger than that finite number).

But determining whether the head visits infinitely many cells is equivalent to determining whether the machine's head goes to infinity, which is not decidable.

So, problem III is undecidable.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought problem I was decidable, and the others not. So, looking back at the options, the choices are from A to J.

Let's look at the options.

Option D: I only.

Option A: III only.

Option E: All are decidable.

Option I: I, II, III.

Wait, but according to my current reasoning, only problem I is decidable. So, the correct answer would be option D: I only.

But wait, I thought problem III might be decidable. Let me think again.

Another approach: for problem III, the number of cells scanned is either finite or infinite.

If the machine halts, then the number is finite. So, in that case, for any n greater than the number of cells, the answer is no.

If the machine doesn't halt, the number could be finite or infinite.

Wait, but if the machine doesn't halt, but keeps moving in one direction, the number of cells scanned is infinite. So, for any n, the answer is yes.

But if the machine doesn't halt and loops within a finite area, then the number of cells is finite.

So, the problem reduces to: does the machine either halt after scanning <n cells, or run forever while scanning <n cells.

Wait, but how can we know whether a non-halting machine will scan infinitely many cells? Because that's equivalent to determining whether the machine's head goes to infinity.

But determining that is undecidable. So, problem III is undecidable.

Thus, only problem I is decidable. So, the correct answer is
