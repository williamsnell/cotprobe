Question:

A farmer owned a 40-acre tract of farmland located in a small southern town. The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. " The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?

Options:

A: The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease.
B: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.
C: The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.
D: The tenant failed to pay the full amount of rent as required by the lease.
E: The farmer's promise to survey the tract was an unfulfilled condition precedent to the tenant's right to purchase.
F: The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise of the option.
G: The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch constituted a material breach of the lease.
H: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
I: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.
J: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contracts and lease agreements, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there's a farmer who leased 40 acres to a tenant for seven years, starting from February 15, 2000, and ending at noon on February 15, 2007. The lease includes a provision where the tenant has to pay $5,000 a month and keep the building in good repair. There's also an option for the tenant to buy 10 acres at the end of the lease for $150,000. 

Before the lease was signed, the farmer orally promised to survey the 10-acre tract. Then, during the last year of the lease, the tenant decides to exercise the option. But the tenant starts building an irrigation ditch without the farmer knowing. When the tenant tells the farmer he's exercising the option, the farmer refuses and says he never had the land surveyed.

The question is about what the farmer's best defense is if the tenant sues for specific performance. The options are A through J.

First, I need to understand the legal issues here. The lease includes an option to purchase. The farmer is refusing to perform, so the tenant is seeking specific performance, which is a remedy where the court orders the farmer to go through with the sale.

I remember that for specific performance, the contract needs to be clear and certain, and the remedy is usually granted when monetary damages wouldn't suffice, like in real estate transactions.

Looking at the defenses, let's consider each option.

Option A: The option was unenforceable because it wasn't in the written lease. But wait, the lease did include the option. The lease had the provision, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Option agreement unenforceable under parol evidence rule. Parol evidence applies when there's a written contract, and prior or contemporaneous agreements are not admissible to contradict it. But here, the oral promise was about surveying, not the option itself. The option is in the lease, so B doesn't apply.

Option C: Option not exercised within the term. The lease ended on Feb 15, 2007, and the tenant notified during the last year. So the exercise was within the term. Unless the option had a specific time to exercise, but the question doesn't say that. So C might not be right.

Option D: Tenant didn't pay full rent. The lease requires payment on the 15th each month. Did the tenant pay? The question doesn't mention any failure to pay rent, so D isn't supported.

Option E: Farmer's promise to survey was a condition precedent. So if the farmer didn't survey, does that mean the tenant can't exercise the option? The option in the lease is for the tenant to purchase, and the farmer's oral promise was a separate promise. Conditions precedent are things that must happen before an obligation arises. But the lease's option doesn't mention surveying as a condition. So maybe the tenant's right to exercise wasn't dependent on the survey. So E might not be valid.

Option F: Farmer didn't consent to the exercise. But the lease gives the tenant the option, so the farmer's consent isn't needed beyond the terms of the option. Once the tenant exercises it properly, the farmer must perform. So F doesn't seem right.

Option G: Tenant's irrigation ditch was a material breach. The lease says the tenant must keep the building in repair. The ditch is on the land, but the question doesn't specify any lease terms about altering the property. Unless building the ditch is a violation, but it's not clear. Also, the farmer's defense would be that the tenant breached the lease, which might allow the farmer to terminate the lease but not necessarily prevent specific performance of the option. The option is a separate agreement, so maybe G is a possibility.

Option H: Property description too indefinite. The lease mentions 10 acres of the 40-acre tract. But the farmer didn't survey it, so is the description too vague? The tenant might argue that they can identify the 10 acres, but without a survey, maybe it's indefinite. But the option was in the lease, so perhaps the description was sufficient. Not sure about H.

Option I: Farmer's failure to survey excused him. But the lease's option didn't make surveying a condition. So I don't think I is correct.

Option J: Option lacked separate consideration. The option was part of the lease agreement, which had consideration (the rent and maintenance). So the option doesn't need separate consideration because it's part of the same contract. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but let me think again about option G. The tenant built an irrigation ditch without permission. The lease requires the tenant to keep the building in good repair but doesn't say anything about not making improvements. So perhaps the ditch doesn't violate the lease terms. If the tenant didn't breach, then G isn't a defense.

Option C: If the option had to be exercised before the lease ended, which it was, since the lease ended on Feb 15, 2007, and the tenant exercised during the last year, then C isn't a valid defense.

So, which options are left? Maybe H or E.

Wait, another angle: the option was part of the lease, which is a written contract. The farmer's oral promise to survey isn't part of the lease. So the tenant can't enforce that promise because it's not in the written lease. But the option itself is enforceable.

Wait, looking back, the farmer's best defense. The tenant is suing for specific performance. The farmer could argue that the description is too indefinite. The lease says 10 acres, but without a survey, it's unclear which 10 acres. So the court can't order specific performance because the property isn't adequately described.

So H might be the answer. Because specific performance requires the contract to identify the property sufficiently. If the 10 acres weren't surveyed, maybe the description is too vague.

Alternatively, option G: if the tenant's action (building the ditch) was a breach, but the lease didn't prohibit such actions. Unless it's considered waste. If the tenant made an improvement, maybe it's not waste. So perhaps G isn't the best defense.

Wait, but the lease says the tenant must keep the building in as good repair as at the start. It doesn't say anything about the land or other structures. So building a ditch might not violate the lease terms, unless it's considered committing waste. But I'm not sure. If the lease doesn't prohibit it, maybe G isn't a good defense.

So, circling back, the best defense might be H: description too indefinite.

Alternatively, maybe the option wasn't properly exercised. But the lease included the option, so that's probably not it.

Wait, the tenant started building the ditch without the farmer's knowledge. If that's a material breach, the farmer could terminate the lease. But the lease ended anyway on Feb 15, 2007. If the breach occurred before the lease ended, the farmer could have terminated early, but since the lease term ended, maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between G and H. But I think H is stronger because without a survey, the description is too vague for specific performance.

So the answer would be H.

The question revolves around a farmer's best defense against a tenant's suit for specific performance regarding an option to purchase 10 acres of a 40-acre tract. The lease included the option, and the tenant sought to exercise it, but the farmer refused, citing that he never surveyed the 10-acre tract as orally promised before the lease was executed. The analysis of the options is as follows:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The option was included in the written lease, so it is enforceable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The parol evidence rule does not apply here because the option itself was in the written lease.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The tenant exercised the option during the last year of the lease, which was within the lease term.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no evidence in the question that the tenant failed to pay rent.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The farmer's oral promise to survey was not a condition precedent to the tenant's right to exercise the option, as the lease did not make the survey a requirement.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The farmer's consent is not required for the tenant to exercise the option, as the lease already granted the tenant the right to do so.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The lease does not prohibit the tenant from building an irrigation ditch, and there is no clear indication that this action constitutes a material breach.
- **Option H**: Correct. The description of the 10-acre tract may be too indefinite because the farmer never surveyed it, making it difficult to identify the specific property for the remedy of specific performance.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The farmer's failure to survey does not inherently excuse him from fulfilling the option agreement.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The option was part of the lease agreement, which had consideration, so it does not lack consideration.

The best defense for the farmer is that the description of the 10-acre tract is too indefinite to permit specific performance, as the lack of a survey makes it unclear which 10 acres are intended. 

Answer: H
