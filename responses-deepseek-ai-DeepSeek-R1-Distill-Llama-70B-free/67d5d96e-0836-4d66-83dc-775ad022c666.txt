Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: (0.0081) raised to the power of 3/4. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. 

First, I remember that when dealing with exponents, especially fractional ones, it might help to express the number in a different form. I think 0.0081 is a decimal, but maybe it's a fraction or a power of a smaller number. Wait, 0.0081 seems familiar. Let me think, 81 is 9 squared, right? So 0.0081 is like 81 divided by 10,000. Because 81 times 100 is 8100, and divided by 100,000 would be 0.0081. Wait, no, 81 divided by 10,000 is 0.0081 because 10,000 is 10^4. So 0.0081 equals 81/10000, which simplifies to (9^2)/(10^4). 

Alternatively, I can write 0.0081 as (0.09)^2 because 0.09 times 0.09 is 0.0081. But maybe another way is better. Oh, right, 0.0081 is (0.3)^4. Let me check that. 0.3 squared is 0.09, and then squared again is 0.0081. Yes, that's correct. So 0.0081 is (0.3)^4. 

So, if I rewrite the original expression as (0.3^4)^(3/4), that simplifies. When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So 4 times (3/4) is 3. So (0.3^4)^(3/4) becomes 0.3^3. 

Wait, 0.3 cubed is 0.027. But wait, the options given are fractions, none of them are decimals. So maybe I should express 0.3 as a fraction. 0.3 is 3/10, right? So 0.3^3 is (3/10)^3. 

Calculating that, (3)^3 is 27, and (10)^3 is 1000. So (3/10)^3 is 27/1000. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 27/1000. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 100/27

B: 1000/81

C: 1000/9

D: 10/27

E: 100/3

F: 1000/3

G: 100/81

H: 1000/27

I: 100/9

J: 10/3

Hmm. None of these are 27/1000. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I approached it incorrectly. Let me try another method. The original expression is (0.0081)^(3/4). 

Another way to handle fractional exponents is to take the root first, then raise to the power. So 3/4 can be seen as taking the 4th root and then cubing it, or taking the cube after the 4th root. 

So, the 4th root of 0.0081. Let me find the 4th root. I know that 0.0081 is 81/10000, which is (3^4)/(10^4), because 3^4 is 81 and 10^4 is 10000. So the 4th root of (3^4/10^4) is (3/10). Because the 4th root of 3^4 is 3, and same for 10^4. So 4th root is 3/10, which is 0.3. 

Then, I need to raise this result to the 3rd power. So (3/10)^3 is 27/1000. Again, same result as before. But the options don't have 27/1000. Wait, maybe I should invert it? Because 27/1000 is the same as 1000/(27* something). No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: maybe I made a mistake in expressing 0.0081. Let me double-check. 0.0081 is 81/10000. 81 is 9^2, and 100 is 10^2, so 10000 is (10^2)^2 = 10^4. So 81/10000 is (9/100)^2. Wait, 9/100 is 0.09, and 0.09 squared is 0.0081. So 0.0081 is (0.09)^2. But how does that help?

Alternatively, think of 0.0081 as (0.3)^4, as I did before. So taking that to the 3/4 power would be (0.3)^(4*(3/4)) = 0.3^3 = 0.027, which is 27/1000. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should express 0.0081 as a power of 10. Let's see: 0.0081 is 8.1 x 10^-3. But that might not help much. Alternatively, express 0.0081 as 81e-5, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take logarithms. Let me try that approach. Let me compute the logarithm of 0.0081. 

Log(0.0081) is log(8.1e-3) = log(8.1) + log(1e-3). Log(8.1) is approximately 0.9085 (since log(8)=0.9031, and 8.1 is a bit more), and log(1e-3) is -3. So log(0.0081) is approximately 0.9085 -3 = -2.0915.

But then, the exponent is 3/4, so multiplying the log by 3/4 gives: (-2.0915) * (3/4) ≈ -1.5686. 

Then, taking the antilog (10^x) of -1.5686. 10^(-1.5686) equals 10^(-1) * 10^(-0.5686). 10^(-1) is 0.1. 10^(-0.5686) is approximately 0.27, since 10^(-0.568) is about 0.27. So 0.1 * 0.27 is 0.027, which is 27/1000 again. 

So same result. But none of the options match. Hmm. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should represent 0.0081 as a fraction and then apply the exponent. Let me write 0.0081 as 81/10000. So (81/10000)^(3/4). 

Breaking this down: 81 is 3^4, and 10000 is 10^4. So (3^4 / 10^4)^(3/4) = (3^4)^(3/4) / (10^4)^(3/4). 

Each part simplifies. (3^4)^(3/4) is 3^(4*(3/4)) ) =3^3=27. Similarly, (10^4)^(3/4)=10^(4*(3/4))=10^3=1000. So 27/1000. 

Again, same result. So the answer should be 27/1000. But looking at the options, that's not present. So maybe I made a mistake in the question. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says (0.0081)^3/4. So maybe the exponent is 3/4. Oh wait, I think I interpreted it correctly. Maybe the options are given differently. Let me look for 27/1000. 

Looking at the options, option H is 1000/27, which is the reciprocal of 27/1000. So that's 1/(27/1000)=1000/27. Hmm. Similarly, option B is 1000/81, which is larger than 1. 

Wait, but my calculation gives me 27/1000, which is 0.027. But in the options, only fractions are given, and none match. So perhaps I have a mistake in my approach.

Wait another thought: 3/4 exponent can be done as taking the 4th root first, then cubing. So 4th root of 0.0081 is 0.3, then cubing it gives 0.027, which is 27/1000. So maybe the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps 0.0081 isn't (0.3)^4. Let me compute 0.3^4. 0.3 squared is 0.09, square again is 0.0081. Yes, that's correct. So that approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should express 0.3 as 3/10. So (3/10)^4 is 81/10000. So (0.0081)^(3/4) = ( (3/10)^4 )^(3/4 ) = (3/10)^(3) = 27/1000. 

So that's the same as before. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the question was (0.81)^(3/4), but no, the question says 0.0081. 

Wait, perhaps I should represent 0.0081 as (9/1000) multiplied by something? Let me see: 0.0081 is 81/10000, which is 9^2 / (100)^2. So 9/100 is 0.09, squared is 0.0081. So yes, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe I should represent 0.0081 as (3^4)/(10^4). So (3^4/10^4)^(3/4) = (3^(4*(3/4)) ) / (10^(4*(3/4)) ) )= 3^3 /10^3=27/1000.

Hmm. So I keep getting 27/1000, which is 0.027. But looking at the options, none of them match. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the exponent.

Wait, another thought: maybe the exponent is 3 divided by 4, but perhaps it's 3 over 4, so the same as 0.75. So I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe the question is (0.0081)^(3/4), but perhaps taking the cube first and then the 4th root. Let me try that approach. So cube of 0.0081 is (0.0081)^3. Let me compute that. 0.0081 * 0.0081 = 0.00006561, then times 0.0081 again: approx 0.000000531441. Then take the 4th root of that. Hmm, that's a very small number, which doesn't match the earlier approach. So I think that's not the right way to do it. Because when you have a^(m/n), it's the same as the nth root of a^m or the mth power of the nth root. So it's better to take the nth root first, then raise to m.

So, I think my initial approach is correct, but perhaps I need to check the options again. Let me list all the options:

A: 100/27 ≈3.7037

B:1000/81≈12.345679

C:1000/9≈111.1111

D:10/27≈0.37037

E:100/3≈33.3333

F:1000/3≈333.333

G:100/81≈1.2345679

H:1000/27≈37.037

I:100/9≈11.1111

J:10/3≈3.3333

Wait, none of these are 27/1000 which is 0.027. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me re-calculate (0.0081)^(3/4).

Alternative approach: express 0.0081 as 81e-4, which is 81 * 10^-4.

So, 81 is 3^4, so 3^4 * 10^-4. So (3^4 *10^-4)^(3/4) = [3^4]^(3/4) * [10^-4]^(3/4) = 3^(3) * 10^(-3) = 27 * 10^-3 = 0.027, which is 27/1000.

So I'm confident that the result is 27/1000.

Looking back at the options, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, option H is 1000/27, which is 1/(27/1000). So maybe I made a mistake in the exponent sign. Let me think: perhaps the exponent is positive 3/4. Oh, no, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the original number was 0.81 instead of 0.0081. Because if it's 0.81, which is (0.9)^2, then (0.9^2)^(3/4)=0.9^(3/2)=sqrt(0.9)^3. The square root of 0.9 is about 0.9487, cubed is about 0.853. But that would still not match any of the options except perhaps some fractions.

Wait, but the question is definitely 0.0081. So maybe none of the options is correct. But that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should express 0.0081 as 81/10000, then take the 4th root, which is (81/10000)^(1/4)= (3^4/10^4)^(1/4)=3/10. Then, raising that to the 3rd power: (3/10)^3=27/1000. So same result.

Wait, unless the expression is (0.0081)^(4/3), but the question says 3/4. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question was written as (0.0081)^(3/4), but maybe it's (0.0081)^(3) divided by 4, but that would be a different thing. No, the way it's written is exponent 3/4.

Wait, maybe I should think of 0.0081 as (3^4)/(10^4), so (3/10)^4. Then (3/10)^4 raised to 3/4 is (3/10)^(3), which is 27/1000.

So I'm stuck because the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be the case. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the fraction. Because 27/1000 is the same as 1000/(27* (1000/27)^(-1) ), but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when simplifying. Let me re-calculate:

(0.0081)^(3/4) = (81e-4)^(3/4) = (81)^(3/4) * (10^-4)^(3/4).

Now, 81^(3/4) is (3^4)^(3/4)=3^(3)=27.

(10^-4)^(3/4)=10^(-4*(3/4))=10^(-3)=1e-3.

So 27 * 1e-3 = 0.027 = 27/1000.

So that's correct. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, wait. Let me think differently. Perhaps 0.0081 is 9^2 / 100^2, so sqrt(0.0081) would be 9/100=0.09, and then taking that to the 3/2 power. Wait, no, that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should write 0.0081 as (0.9)^2, but 0.9^2 is 0.81, not 0.0081. So that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check my initial steps again.

0.0081 is 81/10000, which is (3^4)/(10^4). So the 4th root is 3/10. Then raise to the 3rd power: (3/10)^3=27/1000.

So I think I'm correct, but the options don't include 27/1000. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for 27/1000 as a reciprocal. Wait, option H is 1000/27, which is the reciprocal of 27/1000. So perhaps I inverted something.

Wait, maybe I should have taken the reciprocal in the exponent. Let me think: suppose I write 0.0081 as (10/3)^-4. Because (10/3)^4 is (10000/81), so reciprocal is 81/10000=0.0081. So (0.0081)^(3/4) would be [(10/3)^-4]^(3/4)= (10/3)^(-3) = (3/10)^3=27/1000. So same result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the reciprocal of the exponent. Wait, no, because exponents don't work that way. 

Wait, perhaps the question was (0.0081)^(4/3). Let me compute that. 0.0081^(4/3) would be the cube root of 0.0081 squared. The cube root of 0.0081 is 0.2, because 0.2^3 is 0.008. So (0.2)^4 is 0.0016, which is 16/10000, which is 4/2500, but that
