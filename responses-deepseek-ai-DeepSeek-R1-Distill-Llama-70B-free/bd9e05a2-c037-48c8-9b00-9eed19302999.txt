Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about electrostatic force between two spheres when some charge is transferred from one to the other. I need to find the fraction α that maximizes the force F between them.

Hmm, I remember from Coulomb's Law that the force between two charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². Oh right, and since the spheres are treated as particles, their sizes might not matter much here; the distance r is probably constant because it's not mentioned.

So the problem states that a fraction α of the charge Q on the first sphere is transferred to the second. Let me break that down. Initially, the first sphere has charge Q, and the second has zero. After transferring a fraction α, the first sphere's charge becomes Q - αQ, which is Q(1 - α). The second sphere gets αQ. 

So the two charges are q1 = Q(1 - α) and q2 = αQ. Plugging these into Coulomb's Law, the force F is proportional to (Q(1 - α)) * (αQ) ) / r². Since r is constant, I can ignore that part and focus on the product (1 - α)(α) multiplied by Q². But wait, Q² is a constant because Q is given, so the variable here is α. 

So F is proportional to α(1 - α). To maximize F, I need to maximize the product α(1 - α). This sounds like a quadratic equation problem. Let me think about it. The function f(α) = α(1 - α) is a parabola that opens downward. Its maximum is at the vertex. 

The vertex of a parabola given by f(x) = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Wait, but in this case, f(α) = -α² + α. So expanding that, a = -1 and b = 1. So the maximum occurs at α = -b/(2a) → -(1)/(2*(-1)) = 1/2. So α is 0.5. 

Wait, that would mean the maximum force occurs when half the charge is transferred. But let me double-check. If α is 0.5, then each sphere has Q/2. The product is (Q/2)^2 = Q²/4. 

What if α was something else, say 0.4. Then the product is 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24. Which is less than 0.25 (since 0.5*0.5=0.25). So yeah, 0.5 gives the maximum product. 

So the answer should be E, which is 0.5. Let me look at the options again. Yes, option E is 0.5.

To determine the value of $\alpha$ that maximizes the magnitude $F$ of the electrostatic force between two spheres, we start by applying Coulomb's Law. The force is given by:

\[
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
\]

Here, $q_1 = Q(1 - \alpha)$ and $q_2 = \alpha Q$, where $\alpha$ is the fraction of charge transferred from the first sphere to the second. Substituting these into the formula, the force becomes:

\[
F \propto \alpha (1 - \alpha)
\]

To maximize $F$, we need to maximize the product $\alpha (1 - \alpha)$. This is a quadratic function of the form:

\[
f(\alpha) = \alpha (1 - \alpha) = -\alpha^2 + \alpha
\]

The maximum of a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ occurs at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. For this function, $a = -1$ and $b = 1$, so the maximum occurs at:

\[
\alpha = -\frac{1}{2(-1)} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the force is maximized when $\alpha = 0.5$. Verifying this, if $\alpha = 0.5$, the charges on the spheres are $q_1 = q_2 = \frac{Q}{2}$, and the product $q_1 q_2 = \left(\frac{Q}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{Q^2}{4}$, which is indeed the maximum value.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 0.5**
