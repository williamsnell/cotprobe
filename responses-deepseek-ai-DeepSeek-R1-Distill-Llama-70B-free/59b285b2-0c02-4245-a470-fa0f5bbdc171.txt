Okay, so I have this multiple choice question about the difference between money income and real income. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that these terms relate to how we measure income in terms of purchasing power. Let me think.

Money income, I think, is the actual amount of money you receive, like your salary or wages in dollar terms. It's the nominal value. Real income, on the other hand, must adjust for inflation or changes in prices. So real income would be about what those dollars can actually buy.

Wait, the question is asking what the difference is. So, money income is nominal, right? It's just the number of dollars. Real income accounts for inflation, meaning it's the purchasing power. So if you have $100 and inflation is high, your real income would be less because your $100 doesn't go as far.

Looking at the options:

Option A says money income is before taxes, real after. I don't think taxes are the key here. It's more about purchasing power.

Option B talks about wealth accumulation vs savings. That doesn't sound right. Real income is about purchasing power, not savings.

Option C: Money income is purchasing power, real is dollars. Wait, that's the opposite. Because money income is the dollars, so this is reversed. So C is wrong.

Option D: Money income as price indexâ€”no, price index is like CPI, not income. So D is wrong.

Option E: Money is dollars received, real is goods and services you can buy. Yes, this matches what I was thinking. Money income is nominal, real is adjusted for what you can purchase.

Option F: Money as physical currency, real as asset value. Not quite, because real income is more about what your money can buy, not the value of assets.

Option G: Money is goods, real is dollars. Again, opposite of correct. So G is wrong.

Option H: Money is face value, real is dividends. I don't think that's the right context here.

Option I: Money is GDP per capita, real is PPP. GDP per capita is a measure, but the question is about individual income, not national. So probably not.

Option J: Money is nominal wage, real is adjusted for inflation. That sounds correct too. Because real wage would adjust for inflation, showing the actual purchasing power.

Wait, so E and J both look correct. Let me read the options again.

Option E says money income is the amount of dollars, real is goods/services. That's correct.

Option J says money is nominal wage, real is adjusted. So J is more specific to wages, while E is about any income.

The question is about money income and real income in general, not just wages. So E is the broader correct answer.

So the answer should be E.

The difference between money income and real income lies in their representation of purchasing power. Money income refers to the nominal amount of dollars a person receives, while real income reflects the actual goods and services that can be purchased with that money, adjusting for inflation or price changes. 

Analyzing the options:

- **E** correctly states that money income is the amount of dollars received, and real income is the goods and services one can buy, which aligns with the concept of purchasing power.
- **J**, while accurate for wages, is more specific to wage rates and inflation adjustments, making it less general than **E**.

Thus, the best answer is **E**.

Answer: E
