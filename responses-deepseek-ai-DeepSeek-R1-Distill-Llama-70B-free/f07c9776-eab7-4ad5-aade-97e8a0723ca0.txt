Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about Planet X. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question says that Planet X orbits its sun once every 100 Earth days. So that's its orbital period, right? Like, its year is 100 Earth days long. And it rotates around its axis in the prograde direction with a sidereal day of 100 Earth days. Wait, a sidereal day is the time it takes to rotate once relative to the stars, correct? So that's like Earth's sidereal day, which is a bit less than 24 hours because of the Earth's orbit around the sun affecting the solar day.

Now, the question is asking how long a solar day on Planet X would be. A solar day is the time between two sunrises, right? So it's like the day length from our perspective. On Earth, it's 24 hours, which is a bit longer than the sidereal day because Earth moves a bit in its orbit while rotating.

So I'm thinking, how do the orbital period and the sidereal rotation period relate to the solar day? I remember there's some formula for this. I think it's similar to how we calculate the length of a day on Venus or Mars. 

Let me try to remember. The formula might involve the sidereal rotation period and the orbital period. Oh right, the solar day is calculated considering both the planet's rotation and its orbit around the sun. I think the formula is something like 1/(1/sidereal_day - 1/orbital_period) or maybe the other way around. Wait, no, let me think again. 

I remember something about the stars moving relative to the sun. So the planet has to rotate more than 360 degrees to get the sun back to the same spot in the sky because it's also moving along its orbit. So the solar day is longer than the sidereal day when the orbital period is longer than the rotation period. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. 

Wait, let's think about it step by step. Imagine the planet moving around the sun. Each day, as it rotates, a bit of its orbit has been completed. So from the sun's perspective, the planet has to rotate a bit more than a full rotation to have a new day. 

So the formula I think is: 

1/solar_day = (1/orbital_period) - (1/sidereal_day)

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let's think of the angular speeds. The planet's rotation angular speed ω_rot is 360 degrees per sidereal_day. The orbital angular speed ω_orb is 360 degrees per orbital_period. 

The solar day is the time it takes for the sun to appear in the same position in the sky. So relative to the planet's surface, the sun moves because the planet is orbiting. So the sun's apparent movement is a combination of the planet's rotation and its orbital motion.

So the formula for the solar day (S) is given by:

1/S = (ω_rot - ω_orb) 

Since ω_rot is 360/(sidereal_day) and ω_orb is 360/(orbital_period), but wait, since both are in degrees per day, maybe I need to correct the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how much the planet has rotated relative to its orbit. Let me think of it this way: in the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun once (orbital period, T), it makes T/t_rot rotations. So the number of sidereal days in a year is T/t_rot. 

But for the solar day, we're interested in how often the sun appears in the same position. So each solar day, the planet must have rotated one full rotation more than it would have in the absence of orbital motion. Or wait, maybe the other way around. 

Alternatively, considering that the planet moves along its orbit, each solar day, a point on the planet's surface must rotate once relative to the sun. So the formula for the solar day (S) would be calculated based on the difference between the rotation period and the orbital period.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for an example. Let's take Earth. Earth's sidereal day is about 23.93 hours, and the orbital period is 365.25 days. But our solar day is 24 hours, which is a bit longer than the sidereal day because the Earth moves in its orbit. So the solar day is longer than the sidereal day.

Wait, but that's for Earth, where the sidereal day is shorter than the orbital period. In this question, both are 100 Earth days. So the sidereal day and the orbital period are the same.

Wait, so if the sidereal rotation period is the same as the orbital period, what happens? Let me think. If a planet's rotation period equals its orbital period, it becomes tidally locked, right? Like the Moon always shows the same face to Earth because it's tidally locked. So in that case, one side always faces the sun. So the solar day would be the same as the orbital period. But wait, in our case, the sidereal day is 100 Earth days, and the orbital period is also 100 Earth days. So the planet's day and year are the same length, meaning it's tidally locked. So the solar day would be infinite because the sun never moves in the sky. But that can't be the case. Alternatively, if it's tidally locked, then a solar day would be the same as the orbital period, which is 100 days. But wait, in the options, there's an option G which is 100 Earth days. But the question is about the solar day, not the sidereal day.

Wait the problem says the planet rotates prograde direction with a sidereal day of 100 Earth days. So it's not tidally locked because if it were, the sidereal day would be the same as the orbital period, but that's what it is here. So perhaps it's tidally locked. Wait, but if it's tidally locked, then the same side always faces the sun, so the solar day is as long as the orbital period, but the sidereal day is the same as the orbital period. So in that case, the solar day would be the same as the sidereal day, 100 days. But that's only if the planet isn't tidally locked. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, but in the case where the rotation period equals the orbital period, the planet is tidally locked. So the solar day would be the same as the sidereal day, but wait no. Because if it's tidally locked, the sun is fixed in the sky. So the solar day is undefined because the sun doesn't rise or set. So the solar day would be the same as the orbital period, which is 100 days, but that's if the planet is rotating once per orbit. But in this case, the sidereal day is 100 days, same as the orbital period. So that would mean the planet is tidally locked, making the solar day equal to the orbital period. But that would mean that the sun is stationary in the sky, so the solar day is the same as the orbital period, which is 100 days. But another thought: if the planet's rotation period is the same as its orbital period, then the solar day would be infinite because the sun doesn't move. Wait, but that can't be. It can't have a solar day if it's tidally locked because the sun doesn't rise or set. So perhaps there is no solar day, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, the solar day is the same as the sidereal day, but that's 100 days, so option G. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the options are: option J says "There is no solar day Planet X is tidally locked." But I'm not sure if that's correct. If a planet is tidally locked, it has a permanent day side and night side, so the concept of a solar day (time between sunrises) doesn't apply because the sun doesn't rise or set. So the solar day would be undefined or infinitely long. So option J would be the correct answer. But wait, the initial parameters are that the sidereal day is 100 days, same as the orbital period. So if the planet is rotating once per orbit, that's tidal locking, so the solar day is the same as the orbital period. Or perhaps the solar day is undefined.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the solar day (S) is given by:

1/S = (1/sidereal_day) - (1/orbital_period)

Wait, that can't be right. Because in Earth's case, the sidereal day is about 23.93 hours, and the orbital period is 365 days. So plugging in:

1/S = (1/23.93) - (1/365)

But that would give a negative number, which doesn't make sense. So I think I got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is 1/S = (1/sidereal_day) + (1/orbital_period), but that gives a positive number. Let me test with Earth's values.

Earth's sidereal day is roughly 23.9345 hours, which is about 0.998 days. Orbital period is 365.25 days.

So 1/S = (1/0.998) + (1/365.25) ≈ 1.002 + 0.00274 ≈ 1.00474, so S ≈ 0.996 days, which is about 23.86 hours, which is close to Earth's solar day of 24 hours. So that seems to fit.

Wait, so the formula is 1/S = (1/sidereal_day) + (1/orbital_period) in days. But wait, in this case, the sidereal day and orbital period are both 100 days. So let's plug in:

1/S = (1/100) + (1/100) = 2/100 = 1/50. So S = 50 days. So the solar day would be 50 Earth days. Looking at the options, H is 50 Earth days. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier thought about tidal locking. Because if the sidereal day equals the orbital period, the planet is tidally locked, meaning the same face always points to the sun. So the sun doesn't move in the sky, so the solar day is undefined, meaning there's no solar day. But according to the formula, it's 50 days.

Hmm, I'm confused. Let's think again.

If the planet's sidereal rotation period is equal to its orbital period, then it's tidally locked. So the same side always faces the sun, which means the sun doesn't rise or set. So in that case, the solar day is undefined or infinite because the sun is always in the same position. But according to the formula, when both are 100 days, the solar day is 50 days. That can't be right because the planet can't have a shorter solar day than the sidereal day if it's tidally locked.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me double-check the formula for the solar day. I think the correct formula is:

1/solar_day = |(1/sidereal_day) - (1/orbital_period)|

But considering the direction of rotation. Since it's prograde, the rotation is in the same direction as the orbit. So the formula for a prograde rotation is:

1/solar_day = (1/sidereal_day) - (1/orbital_period)

Wait, but in Earth's terms, the sidereal day is less than the orbital period. So 1/0.998 - 1/365 ≈ 1.002 - 0.00274 ≈ 0.999, so solar_day ≈ 1.001 days, which is about 24 hours, which matches. So the formula would be:

solar_day = 1/( (1/sidereal_day) - (1/orbital_period) )

But wait, that only applies when the sidereal_day is less than the orbital period. If the sidereal_day is greater than the orbital period, then the denominator would be negative, and you'd have a negative solar day, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the absolute value.

Wait, in the case where the planet's rotation period is longer than the orbital period, the solar day would be shorter than the sidereal day. For example, Venus has a very long rotation period of 243 Earth days, but its orbital period is 225 Earth days. So using the formula:

1/solar_day = (1/243) - (1/225) → negative number, so we take the absolute value: 1/225 - 1/243 = (243 - 225)/(243*225) = 18/(54900) → approx 0.000328 → solar_day ≈ 3045 days. Wait, that can't be right because Venus's solar day is about 117 Earth days. Hmm, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula:

solar_day = (sidereal_day * orbital_period) / (orbital_period - sidereal_day)

But that would cause a division by zero when they are equal. Alternatively, if the rotation period is the same as the orbital period, the denominator becomes zero, which would make the solar day infinite, implying no solar day, which aligns with the tidal locking concept.

Wait, so in this problem, both are 100 days, so orbital_period - sidereal_day = 0. So the formula would give an undefined result, implying that the solar day is infinite, which would mean there's no solar day because the sun doesn't move in the sky. So the correct answer would be option J: There is no solar day because Planet X is tidally locked.

So why did the earlier formula suggest 50 days? Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when the sidereal day equals the orbital period, the planet is tidally locked, so the solar day doesn't exist. Therefore, the answer is J.

So looking back, the options are:

A: No sun → incorrect because Planet X does have a sun.

B: 200 → maybe, but I don't see why.

J: No solar day because tidally locked → seems correct in this case.

So the answer should be J.
</think>

Planet X orbits its sun once every 100 Earth days, and its sidereal day (rotation period relative to the stars) is also 100 Earth days. The question asks for the length of a solar day, which is the time between two sunrises on the planet.

To determine the solar day, we consider the relationship between the sidereal day and the orbital period. The solar day is influenced by both the planet's rotation and its orbital motion around the sun. When the sidereal day equals the orbital period, the planet becomes tidally locked. This means the same side of the planet always faces the sun, causing the sun to appear stationary in the sky. As a result, the concept of a solar day becomes undefined because the sun does not rise or set.

Given that Planet X's sidereal day and orbital period are both 100 Earth days, it is tidally locked. Therefore, there is no solar day on Planet X.
