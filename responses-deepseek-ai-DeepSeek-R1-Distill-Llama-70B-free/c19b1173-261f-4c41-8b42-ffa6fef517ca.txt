Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. It's about the maximum value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum for 43Ca. The given spin I is 7/2. Hmm, I remember that spin angular momentum is a quantum mechanical property, and for particles like nuclei or electrons, their spin can have specific quantized values.

Wait, the question is about the maximum z-component. I think the z-component of angular momentum is quantized in steps of ħ (h-bar), right? So for any angular momentum quantum number I, the z-component can take values from -Iħ to +Iħ in integer steps. Oh wait, but wait—nuclear spin is a bit different. I think for the nucleus, the spin quantum number is I, so the maximum m_I (the z-component) would be I multiplied by ħ.

Wait, but I need to confirm. The spin angular momentum S (or I here) has a magnitude given by the formula sqrt(I(I+1))ħ. But the z-component, I_z, can be m_I * ħ, where m_I ranges from -I to +I in integer steps. So the maximum value of I_z is when m_I is +I, so I * ħ.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh no, wait, for the spin angular momentum, the maximum z-component is indeed Iħ. Because I is the quantum number, and m_I can be from -I to +I, each differing by 1. So the maximum is Iħ.

So in this case, I is 7/2. So I need to compute I * ħ. What's the value of ħ? I remember that h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. And ħ is h divided by 2π, so about 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s.

So putting it all together: maximum I_z is (7/2) * ħ.

Let me compute that. 7/2 is 3.5. Multiply that by 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let's see:

3.5 * 1.0545718e-34 = ?

3 * 1.0545718 is approximately 3.1637e-34, 0.5 * 1.0545718 is about 0.5273e-34. So adding them together, 3.1637 + 0.5273 is 3.691, so 3.691e-34.

Wait, but let me double-check the multiplication. Let me compute 7/2 * 1.0545718e-34.

7/2 is 3.5. 3.5 * 1.0545718 = 3.5 * 1.0545718.

Let me compute more accurately:

1.0545718 *3 =3.1637154

1.0545718 *0.5=0.5272859

So adding: 3.1637154 + 0.5272859 = 3.690, 3.690... so 3.690 approximately 3.691e-34 J s.

Looking at the options, option I is 3.691e-34. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the options. Let me look again.

Options:

A: 10.492 x10^-34,

B:2.549,

C:5.493,

D:4.185,

E:1.238,

F:8.370,

G:6.234,

H:9.854,

I:3.691,

J:7.123.

Yes, option I is 3.691e-34, which matches my calculation.

The maximum value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum occurs when \( m_I = +I \), where \( I \) is the spin quantum number. For \( ^{43}\text{Ca} \), \( I = \frac{7}{2} \). The z-component of spin angular momentum is given by \( I_z = m_I \hbar \), and the maximum value is \( I_z = I \hbar \).

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Substituting \( I = \frac{7}{2} \), the calculation becomes:

\[
I_z = \frac{7}{2} \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} = 3.5 \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}.
\]

Breaking this down:
- \( 3 \cdot 1.0545718 = 3.1637154 \),
- \( 0.5 \cdot 1.0545718 = 0.5272859 \),
- Adding these gives \( 3.1637154 + 0.5272859 = 3.6900013 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

Thus, the maximum z-component of the spin angular momentum is approximately \( 3.691 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

From the given options:
- Option I corresponds to \( 3.691 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), which matches the calculated value.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: 3.691 x 10^-34 J s.
