Okay, so Vinnie wants to sell an item that cost him $18.20. He's planning to use a 40% markup based on the selling price. Hmm, wait, I need to be careful here. I remember that markup can be based on cost or selling price, and the formulas are different.

So, the question says it's a 40% markup on the selling price. Right, when the markup is based on the selling price, the formula for selling price (SP) is SP = Cost / (1 - markup rate). Because the markup is a percentage of the selling price, not the cost. 

Wait, let me make sure. So, if the markup is 40% of the selling price, then the cost is 60% of the selling price because 100% minus 40% markup. So, 60% of SP equals the cost. So SP = Cost / 0.6.

Vinnie's cost is $18.20. So plugging that in: SP = 18.20 / 0.6. Let's calculate that. 

18.2 divided by 0.6. Hmm, 18 divided by 0.6 is 30, because 0.6 times 30 is 18. Then 0.2 divided by 0.6 is 0.333... So adding them, 30 + 0.333 is 30.333... So approximately $30.33.

Looking at the options, option C is $30.33, which matches my calculation. So I think that's the correct answer.

The selling price is calculated using the formula for markup based on selling price: 

\[
SP = \frac{\text{Cost}}{1 - \text{Markup Rate}}
\]

Given the cost is $18.20 and the markup rate is 40% (or 0.4), the formula becomes:

\[
SP = \frac{18.20}{1 - 0.4} = \frac{18.20}{0.6} \approx 30.33
\]

Thus, the selling price is approximately **$30.33**, which corresponds to option C.
