Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is about whether verbal stimuli can be an acquired source of drive. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that drives are things that motivate behavior, right? Like, they push us to do something to reduce a need, such as hunger or thirst.

Wait, the question is specifically about verbal stimuli being an acquired source. So, I'm thinking about types of drives. Drives can be primary, which are innate, like eating or drinking, and secondary, which are learned. Oh, right! Secondary drives are acquired through experience and learning. So, if verbal stimuli are an acquired source, they must be part of secondary drives.

Verbal stimuli are things like words, phrases, or commands. So, can these learned things motivate us? I think so. For example, praise or encouragement can motivate someone to work harder. Praise is a verbal stimulus, and it's something we learn to associate with positive outcomes. So, if someone says "Good job!", that can drive someone to continue the behavior because they've learned that it means approval or a reward.

Looking at the options now. The question is whether verbal stimuli may be an acquired source of drive. So the correct answer should reflect that verbal cues can become sources of drive through learning.

Option A says verbal cues are effective only in specific cultural contexts. Well, that might be true, but the question is about whether they can be an acquired source in general. So A isn't the best choice.

Option B claims only non-verbal stimuli can be sources of drive. That's not right because we know verbal can too, like praise.

Option C says verbal stimuli only work in early childhood. No, that's not correct. People of all ages can be motivated by verbal cues.

Option D states that verbal stimuli are innate. No, because they're learned, so they're acquired, not innate.

Option E says they're not acquired. That's the opposite of what the question is suggesting, so E is incorrect.

Option F says verbal stimuli only affect animals. Definitely not true; humans are heavily influenced by verbal cues.

Option G claims they only work with physical reinforcement. That's partially true, but I think verbal cues can sometimes work on their own once they're learned. Like, if you've been conditioned to respond to praise, it might motivate you even without a physical reward each time.

Option H says they're only informational. But they do have motivational properties, so H is wrong.

Option I says language has no influence on behavior. That's false because language definitely shapes behavior.

Option J says certain verbal cues become acquired through learned responses. That fits perfectly. Because through learning, these verbal cues can motivate us, making them an acquired source of drive.

So the correct answer should be J.

The question asks whether verbal stimuli can be an acquired source of drive. Drives are motivations that push individuals to act, and they can be primary (innate) or secondary (learned). Verbal stimuli, such as praise or encouragement, are learned through experience and can motivate behavior by being associated with positive outcomes. This aligns with secondary drives, which are acquired.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Verbal cues can be effective across various contexts, not just specific cultural ones.
- **B**: Incorrect. Verbal stimuli can also serve as sources of drive.
- **C**: Incorrect. Verbal stimuli motivate people of all ages, not just in early childhood.
- **D**: Incorrect. Verbal stimuli are learned, not innate.
- **E**: Incorrect. Verbal stimuli can be acquired sources of drive.
- **F**: Incorrect. Verbal stimuli significantly influence humans, not just animals.
- **G**: Incorrect. Verbal cues can motivate independently once learned.
- **H**: Incorrect. Verbal stimuli have motivational properties beyond being purely informational.
- **I**: Incorrect. Language profoundly influences human behavior.
- **J**: Correct. Verbal cues become motivational through learned responses, making them acquired sources of drive.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**.
