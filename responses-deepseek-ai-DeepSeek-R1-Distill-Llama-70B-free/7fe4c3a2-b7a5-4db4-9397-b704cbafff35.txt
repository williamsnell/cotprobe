Okay, so I have this question about what (7/10) EOM means, and I need to figure it out. I remember that terms like these are often related to payment terms in invoices, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me try to break it down.

EOM stands for "End of Month," I think. So that part I'm pretty sure about. The numbers 7 and 10 probably refer to days, but I'm not sure in what context. Maybe it's about discounts for early payment?

I recall that sometimes companies offer a discount if you pay within a certain number of days. Like, if you pay within 10 days, you get a 7% discount or something like that. But wait, I'm not sure if the first number is the discount percentage or the number of days.

Wait, the structure is (7/10) EOM. So maybe the 7 is the discount percentage, and 10 is the number of days. So 7% discount if paid within 10 days after the end of the month? Or is it 10% discount within 7 days?

I'm a little confused. Let me think about standard payment terms. I think terms like "2/10, net 30" mean 2% discount if paid in 10 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 30 days. So applying that logic here, (7/10) EOM would be 7% discount if paid within 10 days after the end of the month.

So looking at the options, which one matches that? Let's go through them.

Option A: Deduct 7% if payment is made no later than the tenth day after the end of the month. That sounds right. Because 7% discount for paying within 10 days after EOM.

Option B: 10% within 7 days of receiving invoice. No, that's not matching because the format is 7/10, so 7% and 10 days. Also, it's EOM, not from receiving the invoice.

Option C: 7% on the 10th day of the month. That's not it because it's about when you pay after EOM, not a specific day of the month.

Option D: Pay full within 7 days of EOM. No discount here, so doesn't fit.

Option E: 10% within seventh day after EOM. That would mean 10% discount in 7 days, but our term is 7/10.

Option F: 7% within 10 days of receiving. But again, the term is EOM, so it's from the end of the month, not receipt.

Option G: 10% on 7th day after EOM. Again, the discount is 10%, but our term starts with 7, so probably 7%.

Option H: 7% on the 10th day of the month. That's not considering the EOM part correctly, I think.

Option I: Full amount within 10 days of EOM. No discount, so no.

Option J: 10% by seventh day of the month. Doesn't fit the structure.

So the correct option should be A: 7% discount if paid by the 10th day after EOM.

The term "(7/10) EOM" refers to payment terms where the customer may deduct 7% of the invoice amount if payment is made no later than the tenth day after the end of the month. This aligns with standard payment terms where the first number represents the discount percentage, and the second number represents the days allowed to receive the discount after the specified date (in this case, the end of the month).

Option A correctly states this: "A customer may deduct 7% of the amount of the invoice if payment is made no later than the tenth day after the end of the month."

Answer: A
