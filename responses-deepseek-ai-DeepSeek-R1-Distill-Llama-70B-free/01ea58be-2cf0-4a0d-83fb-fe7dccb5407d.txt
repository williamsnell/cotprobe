Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about calculating the standard enthalpy change (Δr H°) for a given reaction, using the provided standard internal energy change (Δr U°). 

The reaction given is: C₂H₅OH(l) + 3 O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g) + 3 H₂O(g). They've provided Δr U° as -1373 kJ/mol at 298 K. I remember that ΔH is related to ΔU through the equation ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n)RT, where Δ(n) is the change in moles of gas. Oh wait, wait, wait, no. Let me think again. I think the formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n) * R * T, but I might be mixing it up. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, no, I think I got it right. The relation is ΔH° = ΔU° + Δ(n) * R * T. Because enthalpy change includes the heat at constant pressure, which accounts for the work done by gases. So the formula connects the two. 

But wait, what exactly is Δ(n)? Oh right, Δ(n) is the change in moles of gas in the reaction. So I need to calculate how many moles of gas are produced minus how many are consumed. 

Looking at the reaction: On the reactant side, we have ethanol as a liquid, so that's 1 mole of C₂H₅OH(l). Then 3 moles of O₂(g), so total gaseous moles on reactant side is 3. On the product side, we have 2 moles of CO₂(g) and 3 moles of H₂O(g). So the product's gaseous moles are 2 + 3 = 5. 

Wait wait, no. Wait, the water is a gas here, so yes, it's included. So the moles of gas in products are 2 CO₂ and 3 H₂O, making 5. The reactants have 3 moles O₂. So Δ(n) is moles of gaseous products minus moles of gaseous reactants. So that's (2 + 3) - 3 = 2? Because 5 -3 is 2. So Δn = 2. 

Wait, but wait another thing. The ethanol is a liquid, so it doesn't contribute to the gas moles. So the reactant gases are only O₂, which is 3 moles. The product gases are CO₂ and H₂O(g), which are 2 + 3 = 5. So Δn = 5 -3 = 2. Yeah, that's correct. So Δ(n) is +2.

Now, the formula is ΔH° = ΔU° + Δ(n) * R * T. Wait, but wait another thing. I recall from my studies that when calculating ΔH from ΔU, the correct formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n) * R * T. But wait, let me make sure. I think the formula is ΔH = ΔU + (Δn) * R*T, where Δn is the change in moles of gas. So yes, that's right.

Now, R is the gas constant. What's the value of R here? Well, since the given ΔU is in kJ/mol, and R is commonly 8.314 J/mol·K, I need to convert that into kJ. So R is 8.314 J/mol·K = 0.008314 kJ/mol·K.

The temperature is given as 298 K. So putting it all together: ΔH° = ΔU° + (Δn) * R * T.

Plugging the numbers in: ΔU° is -1373 kJ/mol. Δn is 2. So:

ΔH° = (-1373) + (2) * (0.008314 kJ/mol·K) * 298 K.

Calculating the second term: 2 * 0.008314 * 298.

Let me compute that:

First, 0.008314 * 298 = ?

Well, 0.008314 * 300 would be about 2.4942, but since it's 298, which is 300 - 2, so subtract 0.008314 * 2 = 0.016628. So 2.4942 - 0.016628 = approximately 2.4776.

But wait, let's compute it more accurately. 0.008314 * 298 = 298 * 8.314e-3.

Compute 298 * 8 = 2384e-3 = 2.384.

298 * 0.314 = Let's see: 298 * 0.3 = 89.4; 298*0.014=4.172. So 89.4 +4.172=93.572. So 93.572e-3 = 0.093572. So total is 2.384 + 0.093572 = 2.477572 kJ/mol.

But wait, that's for 1 mole. But we have 2 from Δn. So multiply by 2: 2.477572 * 2 = 4.955144 kJ/mol.

So the ΔH° becomes: -1373 + 4.955 = approximately -1368.045 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option J is -1368 kJ/mol. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the R*T part.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K → 0.008314 kJ/mol·K.

So 0.008314 * 298 = let me compute precisely:

298 * 0.008 = 2.384.
298 * 0.000314 = 0.093652.
Adding together: 2.384 + 0.093652 = 2.477652 kJ/mol.

Multiply by Δn=2: 2.477652 *2=4.955304 kJ/mol.

So ΔH° = -1373 + 4.9553 = -1368.0447 kJ/mol. So approximately -1368, which is option J.

Another thing to double-check: was Δn calculated correctly? Reactant gases: O2 is 3 moles. Product gases: CO2 (2) + H2O (3) =5. So 5 -3 = 2. Yes, correct. So yes, the calculation is correct.

To calculate the standard enthalpy change (Δr H°) for the reaction:

**C₂H₅OH(l) + 3 O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g) + 3 H₂O(g)**

we use the relationship between ΔH° and ΔU°:

\[
\Delta H^\ominus = \Delta U^\ominus + \Delta(n) \cdot R \cdot T
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the reaction and calculate Δ(n)
- **Reactants (gaseous):** 3 moles of O₂(g).
- **Products (gaseous):** 2 moles of CO₂(g) + 3 moles of H₂O(g) = 5 moles of gas.
- **Δ(n):** Moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants = \( 5 - 3 = 2 \).

### Step 2: Identify constants
- **Δr U°:** Given as \(-1373 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\).
- **R:** Gas constant = \( 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol·K} = 0.008314 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol·K} \).
- **T:** Temperature = \( 298 \, \mathrm{K} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the correction term
\[
\Delta(n) \cdot R \cdot T = 2 \cdot 0.008314 \cdot 298
\]
First, calculate \( 0.008314 \cdot 298 \):
\[
0.008314 \cdot 298 = 2.477572 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]
Then multiply by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2.477572 = 4.955144 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Δr H°
\[
\Delta H^\ominus = \Delta U^\ominus + \Delta(n) \cdot R \cdot T
\]
\[
\Delta H^\ominus = -1373 + 4.955144 = -1368.0449 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated Δr H° is approximately \(-1368 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\), which corresponds to **option J**.
