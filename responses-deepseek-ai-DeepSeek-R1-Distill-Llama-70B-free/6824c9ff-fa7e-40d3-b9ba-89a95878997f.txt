Question:

A woman broke her leg while skiing. She was taken to a hospital where she was treated by a doctor who determined that the woman would need surgery to set the broken bones so that they would heal properly. During the surgery, the doctor inserted several metal screws into the woman's leg to hold the bones together. Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective. The woman was forced to have a second surgery to replace the defective screws. If the woman asserts a strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital for using defective screws in her surgery, she will most likely

Options:

A: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital can argue that the defect was not apparent during the surgery.
B: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product to her that was defective and unreasonably dangerous.
C: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital failed to provide a follow-up check on the screws used.
D: prevail, because the hospital and the doctor were negligent in their duty to ensure the safety of medical devices used.
E: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws and, therefore, the defect in the screws was not their fault.
F: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital will be treated as service providers rather than product sellers.
G: not prevail, because the hospital did not separately charge for the screws, thus they cannot be held responsible.
H: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not inform her about the potential risks of defective screws.
I: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital are not liable for defects in medical devices they did not manufacture.
J: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them.

Okay, so I've got this question about strict tort liability, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is about a woman who broke her leg skiing and needed surgery. The doctor inserted metal screws, but later they turned out to be defective, causing her to need a second surgery. Now she's suing the doctor and the hospital under strict tort liability for using defective screws.

Hmm, I remember that strict liability applies to the sellers of products, especially if the product has a defect that makes it unreasonably dangerous. But wait, does that apply here? The doctor and hospital didn't manufacture the screws; they just used them during surgery.

So, the question is whether the doctor and hospital can be held strictly liable. I think in some cases, medical professionals can be considered as providers of services rather than product sellers. Products liability usually targets manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. But sometimes, if a service provider is also providing a product as part of the service, there might be liability.

Wait, but in this case, the bill didn't include a separate charge for the screws. So maybe the screws were part of the overall service. If that's the case, the hospital and doctor might not be considered product sellers, but rather service providers. And strict liability usually applies to product sellers, not service providers.

I also remember that under the "hybrid" or dual role, sometimes courts will treat medical providers as both service providers and product sellers if they are supplying a product. But I'm not sure if that applies here. For example, if a pharmacy sells a drug, they might be strictly liable if it's defective. But a doctor prescribing it might not be, unless perhaps in some cases where the drug is considered a product they provided.

In this case, the screws were implanted during surgery as part of the treatment. The hospital didn't charge extra for them, so they were likely included in the cost of the surgery. So maybe the court would see the screws as part of the service, not a separate product.

If that's the case, then the doctor and hospital might not be strictly liable because they didn't sell the product. They used it as part of their service. So the woman might have to claim under negligence instead, showing that they were negligent in selecting or using the screws. But the question is about strict liability, not negligence.

Looking at the options:

Option A says they won't prevail because the defect wasn't apparent during surgery. But strict liability doesn't require the defendant to know about the defect; it's about the product being defective, regardless of fault.

Option B says she'll prevail because the screws were defective and dangerous. But this would apply if the doctor and hospital were product sellers. If they're service providers, this might not hold.

Option E says she won't prevail because they didn't manufacture the screws. That's a possibility because strict liability is typically against the manufacturer. But sometimes, if the seller (like a hospital) is in the business of selling such products, they might be liable. But if they're just using them as part of a service, maybe not.

Option F says they won't prevail because the doctor and hospital are treated as service providers, not product sellers. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

Option I says she won't prevail because they didn't manufacture the screws. That's similar to E, but I think it's more about whether they are in the business of selling the product.

So between E, F, and I. The key is whether the defendants are considered product sellers or service providers.

If the screws were part of the service and not sold separately, they're likely service providers. So strict liability wouldn't apply. So options E, F, or I would be correct.

Option E says they aren't manufacturers, so not liable. That's a bit too broad because sometimes non-manufacturers can be strictly liable if they are in the business of selling the product. Like a retailer.

Option F says they're treated as service providers. If the screws were part of the service and not a product they sell separately, then F makes sense.

Option I says they aren't liable because they didn't make the screws. But again, that's not necessarily true if they are considered sellers.

So I think the correct answer is either F or E. But wait, some courts have held that when a service provider supplies a product as part of the service, like a doctor using a product, they can sometimes be held strictly liable. But others treat them differently.

Wait, another point: the hospital didn't charge separately for the screws. So maybe they were part of the service, making the providers not product sellers. So the answer would be F or E.

I'm a bit torn. Let me think about cases. I recall that in some cases, like when a doctor prescribes a drug, they aren't liable because they're not the seller. But if the hospital sells the drug as part of treatment, maybe they are. But in this case, the screws were implanted, so it's more like a product used in the service.

I think the answer is that the doctor and hospital would not be strictly liable because they are service providers, not product sellers, so option F.

The question revolves around whether a doctor and hospital can be held strictly liable for using defective screws during surgery. Strict liability typically applies to product sellers, not service providers. In this case, the screws were part of the surgical service, and the hospital did not charge separately for them, indicating they were included in the overall cost of the procedure. Courts often distinguish between service providers and product sellers, and here, the doctor and hospital are likely treated as service providers rather than product sellers. 

Strict liability requires that the defendant be in the business of selling the product. Since the screws were used as part of the service and not sold separately, the doctor and hospital do not fall into this category. While some cases may blur the line between service providers and product sellers, the lack of a separate charge for the screws strengthens the argument that the defendants are not product sellers. Therefore, the woman is unlikely to prevail in a strict liability claim against the doctor and hospital.

The best answer is **F**.
