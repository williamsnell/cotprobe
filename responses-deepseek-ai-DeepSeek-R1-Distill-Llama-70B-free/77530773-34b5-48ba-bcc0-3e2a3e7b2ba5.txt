Okay, so I've got this problem here about transportation costs and mileage. Hmm, let me read it again. It says that transporting one pound of merchandise 100 miles costs $5.00, and 700 miles costs $28.50. They want a linear function to describe this relationship and then find the cost for 200 and 400 miles. The options are A to J, each with two values.

Alright, so first, since it's a linear relationship, it should fit the equation C(m) = a*m + b, where C is the cost, m is the miles, and a and b are constants. Wait, but wait, maybe it's better to think of it as C(m) = km + c, where k is the slope (cost per mile) and c is the y-intercept, which might be the base cost (if any). 

Wait, but in this case, when m is 0, what is C? It's the fixed cost, but the problem doesn't mention any fixed cost. So perhaps the relationship is just C = km, where c is zero. Or maybe not. Let me think.

We have two points: (100, 5) and (700, 28.50). Using these, I can find the slope, which is the cost per mile.

So slope a = (28.50 - 5) / (700 - 100) = (23.5) / 600. Let me calculate that. 23.5 divided by 600. 23.5 divided by 600 is 0.0391666... So approximately $0.039166 per mile. Hmm, that's about 3.9166 cents per mile.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 23.5 divided by 600. 600 goes into 23.5 how many times? 600 times 0.03 is 18. 23.5 -18 =5.5 left. 5.5 /600 = 0.00916666. So total is 0.03 +0.009166666 = 0.039166666. So yes, about 0.0391667 dollars per mile.

So the equation is C(m) = 0.0391667 * m + b. Wait, but when m=100, C=5. So plugging in, 5 = 0.0391667 *100 + b. 0.0391667 *100 = 3.91667. So 5 =3.91667 +b → b=5-3.91667=1.08333.

Wait, so the equation is C(m) = (23.5/600)*m + 1.08333. Hmm. But wait, let's double-check. Because if I plug m=700, what's C?

23.5/600 *700 = 23.5 *700 /600. 700/600 is 7/6. 23.5 *7/6 = (23.5 *7)=164.5 /6 ≈27.416666. Then adding the b=1.08333, 27.416666 +1.08333≈28.5, which matches. So that's correct.

But wait, maybe there's a simpler way to represent this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the cost is directly proportional to miles, so C = k*m, without any fixed cost. Let me see: if that's the case, using m=100, C=5.

Then k would be 5/100 = 0.05 dollars per mile. Wait, but then at 700 miles, it would be 0.05 *700=35, but the problem says it's 28.50. So that can't be right. So the relationship must have a fixed cost component. So the correct model is C = a*m + b.

So with that, the function is C(m) = (23.5/600)m + 1.08333. Let me write that as fractions to be precise. 23.5 is 47/2, so 47/2 divided by 600 is 47/(2*600)=47/1200. So a=47/1200 dollars per mile. And b is 1.083333, which is 13/12 (since 1.083333 is 13/12). Wait, 13 divided by 12 is 1.083333. So b =13/12.

Wait, let me check that. 13/12 is approximately 1.083333, yes. So C(m) = (47/1200) m +13/12.

But maybe I should represent this as a linear equation in dollars. Now, the problem asks for the cost per pound to transport 200 and 400 miles. So I'll plug m=200 and m=400 into the equation.

For m=200:

C = (47/1200)*200 +13/12. Let's compute each term.

(47/1200)*200 = (47 *200)/1200. 200/1200 =1/6. So 47*(1/6)=47/6 ≈7.833333 dollars.

13/12 is approximately 1.083333 dollars.

So total C ≈7.833333 +1.083333 ≈8.916666. So approximately $8.916666, which is about $8.92. Hmm, looking at the options, let's see which options have around 8.90 for the first value.

Looking at options: Option A is $8.90 and $16.70. Option C is $9.90 and $19.80. Option F is $9.00 and $18.00. Option J is $8.50 and $17.00. Option G is $7.80 and $15.60.

Wait, our calculation is approx $8.916666, so closer to 8.92. So the closest option is A at 8.90, but let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps using fractions for more precision.

C(200) = (47/1200)*200 +13/12.

(47/1200)*200 = (47 *200)/1200 = (47 *1)/6 = 47/6.

47/6 is 7 and 5/6, which is approximately 7.833333.

13/12 is 1 and 1/12, which is approximately 1.083333.

Adding together: 7 +1 =8, and 5/6 +1/12 = (10/12 +1/12)=11/12 ≈0.916666. So total is exactly 8 and 11/12, which is 8.916666...

So 8.916666 is approximately $8.92. The options have 8.90 (A), 9.00 (F), 9.90 (C), etc.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to model it without the fixed cost. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the fixed cost is zero, but that didn't fit earlier. Because when m=0, C would be zero. So if I try that approach.

If C = a*m, then using m=100, C=5 → a=5/100=0.05. Then for m=700, C=0.05*700=35, which doesn't match 28.50. So that's not possible. So the fixed cost must be present.

Wait, but perhaps I should check my earlier calculation another way. Let me compute the cost per mile correctly.

The cost for 100 miles is $5. For 700 miles, it's $28.50. So the difference in miles is 700-100=600 miles, and the difference in cost is 28.50-5=23.50. So 23.50 over 600 miles is 23.50/600 per mile.

23.50 divided by 600 is 0.03916666... So the variable cost per mile is approximately 3.916666 cents.

So the equation is C = 0.03916666 * m + b. Now, when m=100, C=5. So 5=0.03916666*100 +b → 5=3.916666 +b → b=1.083333.

So yes, that's correct. So the function is C(m)=0.03916666 m +1.083333.

Now, let's compute C(200) and C(400).

C(200)=0.03916666*200 +1.083333.

0.03916666 *200 = 7.833332.

7.833332 +1.083333=8.916665, so $8.916665, which is approximately $8.92.

C(400)=0.03916666*400 +1.083333.

0.03916666 *400=15.666664.

15.666664 +1.083333=16.75.

So $16.75.

Now looking at the options, which one has 8.9166 (approx 8.92) and 16.75.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 8.90 and 16.70.

Option E: 12 and 24.

Option C:9.90 and 19.80.

Option J:8.50 and 17.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 8.9166 and 16.75. So perhaps I made a mistake, or maybe the question expects rounding to the nearest cent, but perhaps the initial approach was wrong.

Wait, let me think another way. Maybe the fixed cost is zero, but that didn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the cost per mile is computed as (28.50 -5)/(700-100) =23.5/600=0.03916666 per mile, as I did. So each mile beyond 100 would cost that. But wait, maybe the fixed cost is for the first 100 miles, and then it's variable beyond that. Wait, but the problem says the relationship is linear, so it's a straight line model.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the cost is modeled as C(m) = km, with k being the slope. But that would mean when m=0, C=0. Let me see if that works. So with m=100, C=5. So k=5/100=0.05. Then at m=700, C=0.05*700=35. But the problem states it's 28.50, which doesn't match. So that can't be right. So the model must include a fixed cost.

So the correct model is C(m) = 0.0391666*m +1.083333.

So for m=200, C=8.916666, which is approximately $8.92, and for 400, it's 16.75.

Looking at the options, the closest is Option A: 8.90 and 16.70. But that's 8.90 and 16.70, which is a bit lower than our calculation. Alternatively, maybe my calculation is off. Let me recheck the initial data.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute the exact values again more precisely.

The slope is 23.5/600. Let me compute 23.5 divided by 600.

23.5 ÷ 600: 600 goes into 23.5 0.039166666... times. So that's correct.

Then, using m=100, C=5. So 5= (23.5/600)*100 +b.

Compute (23.5/600)*100: 23.5*100=2350; divided by 600, 2350/600=3.916666...

So 5=3.916666 +b → b=1.083333.

So yes, the equation is correct.

Now, for m=200:

C= (23.5/600)*200 +1.083333.

23.5 *200=4700; 4700/600=7.833333.

7.833333 +1.083333=8.916666, which is 8.916666... So $8.916666.

Similarly, for 400 miles:

23.5/600 *400 = (23.5 *400)/600=9400/600=15.666666...

15.666666 +1.083333=16.75.

So 16.75.

Now, looking at the options, none of them exactly match 8.9166 and 16.75. So perhaps the question expects rounding to the nearest cent or to the nearest dollar? Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: $8.90 and $16.70.

Option J: $8.50 and $17.00.

Option F: $9.00 and $18.00.

Hmm. So perhaps the question expects the values to be rounded to the nearest cent. 8.916666 is approximately 8.92, but the closest option is A, which is 8.90 and 16.70. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to model without the fixed cost, but that doesn't fit the given data.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the fixed cost being zero. Let me try that again. Let's model it as C = (28.50 -5)/(700-100) *m.

So C = (23.5/600)*m. So for m=100, C would be 23.5/600 *100 =23.5/6=3.916666, but the given C is 5. So that's not matching. Hence, the fixed cost must be present.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the transportation cost has a base rate plus a per-mile rate. So when you ship up to 100 miles, it's a flat $5, and beyond that, it's an additional per-mile rate. But the problem states the relationship is linear, which suggests a straight-line model with C = a*m + b, so that's consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the function to pass through (0,0), which would mean the fixed cost is zero. Let me check that.

If C(m) = a*m, then at m=100, C=5 → a=0.05. Then at m=700, C=0.05*700=35, but the problem says it's 28.50. So that's inconsistent. So no, the fixed cost can't be zero.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I miscalculated 23.5/600.

23.5 divided by 600: Let me do it step by step.

23.5 ÷ 600.

Well, 600 goes into 23.5 0.0391666 times.

So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the cost per mile beyond a certain point, but that complicates it beyond a linear model.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation using two-point form.

The two points are (100,5) and (700,28.50). The slope m is (28.50-5)/(700-100)=23.5/600=0.03916666.

So the equation using point-slope form, using (100,5):

y -5 = 0.03916666(x -100).

So y=0.03916666x -0.03916666*100 +5.

Calculating 0.03916666*100=3.916666.

So y=0.03916666x -3.916666 +5 → y=0.03916666x +1.083333.

Which matches what I had before.

So at x=200: 0.03916666*200=7.833332 +1.083333=8.916665.

At x=400: 0.03916666*400=15.666664 +1.083333=16.75.

So the costs are $8.916665 and $16.75.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 8.90 and 16.70.

Option E:12 and 24.

Option C:9.90 and 19.80.

Option B:10 and 20.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match. So perhaps the question expects us to round to the nearest cent.

Wait, 8.916665 is approximately $8.92, but the closest option is A at 8.90. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the exact value, but the options don't have it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact fractions.

Let me redo the calculation with exact fractions.

Slope = 23.5/600 =47/1200.

So the equation is y = (47/1200)x + b.

Using (100,5):

5 = (47/1200)*100 + b → 5 = (47*100)/1200 + b → 5 = 4700/1200 +b → 4700/1200 is 47/12 ≈3.916666.

So 5=47/12 + b → b=5 -47/12 = (60/12 -47/12)=13/12 ≈1.083333.

So y= (47/1200)x +13/12.

Now, for x=200:

y= (47/1200)*200 +13/12.

(47/1200)*200 =47/6 ≈7.833333.

13/12 ≈1.083333.

Adding together:47/6 +13/12 = (94/12 +13/12)=107/12 ≈8.916666.

Which is exactly 107/12 dollars, which is 8 and 11/12 dollars, because 12*8=96, 107-96=11. So 11/12 is 0.916666.

Similarly, for x=400:

y= (47/1200)*400 +13/12.

(47/1200)*400 =47/3 ≈15.666666.

15.666666 +1.083333=16.75, which is exactly 16.75.

Looking back at the options, none of the options have 16.75. Wait, option A is $16.70, which is close. But 16.75 is 16.75, which isn't exactly any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects to round to the nearest cent, but 16.75 is exactly $16.75, so it's possible that the options might have that, but I'm not seeing it. Let me check the options again.

Looking back: Option A is 8.90 and 16.70.

Option C is 9.90 and 19.80.

Option E is 12 and 24.

Option F is 9.00 and 18.00.

Option J is 8.50 and 17.00.

Hmm,
