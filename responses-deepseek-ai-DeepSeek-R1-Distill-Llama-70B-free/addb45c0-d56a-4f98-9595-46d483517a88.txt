Alright, so I've got this problem here about two used car offers, and I need to figure out which one is cheaper and by how much. Let me break it down step by step.

Okay, the first dealer is offering a car for $2,500, but that's less 15%. Hmm, I think that means I need to subtract 15% of $2,500 from the original price. So how do I calculate that? Well, 15% as a decimal is 0.15. So I'll multiply 2500 by 0.15 to get the discount. Let me do that: 2500 * 0.15 equals... let's see, 2500 times 0.1 is 250, and 2500 times 0.05 is 125, so adding those gives 375. So the discount is $375. Subtracting that from $2500 gives me 2500 - 375 = $2125. So the first offer is $2125.

Now the second dealer is offering a similar car for $2,350 less 10%, plus a $25 tune-up charge. Wait, so I need to apply the discount first and then add the tune-up fee. Let me see. The discount here is 10%, so that's 0.10 times 2350. Let me calculate that: 2350 * 0.10 is 235. So the discounted price is 2350 - 235 = $2115. But then there's a $25 tune-up charge, so I add that. 2115 + 25 equals $2140.

Wait, so the first offer is $2125 and the second is $2140. Comparing those, which is lower? Let me subtract them. 2140 minus 2125 equals 15. So the first offer is $15 cheaper than the second. Wait, no wait, wait a second. Because 2125 is less than 2140, right? So yes, the first offer is lower, and the difference is 15. So the lower offer is the first one, and it's $15 less than the second.

Looking at the options, the choices are from A to J. The question asks which is the lower offer and how much less. So the amount less is $15, which would correspond to option G: $15.

The first dealer's offer is calculated by taking 15% off $2,500: 

$2,500 - (0.15 × $2,500) = $2,500 - $375 = $2,125.

The second dealer's offer involves a 10% discount on $2,350 plus a $25 tune-up charge:

$2,350 - (0.10 × $2,350) = $2,350 - $235 = $2,115. Adding the $25 tune-up gives $2,115 + $25 = $2,140.

Comparing the two, the first offer ($2,125) is lower than the second ($2,140) by $15.

The correct answer is G: $15.

Answer: G
