Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about static friction and a turntable. Hmm, I remember that static friction is the force that keeps an object from moving when there's a force trying to make it slide. The problem gives me the coefficient of static friction, which is 0.30, and the turntable's rotation speed in revolutions per minute. I need to find the maximum distance from the center where the coin won't slide. 

Wait, the turntable is rotating, so the coin must be experiencing some kind of force trying to pull it outward. Oh right, that's the centripetal force. But wait, the coin isn't moving outward; it's the friction that's providing the necessary centripetal force to keep it rotating with the turntable. So the maximum static friction force must be equal to the required centripetal force at the maximum distance.

Let me think about the formula. The maximum static friction force is given by f_s = μs * N, where μs is the coefficient of static friction and N is the normal force. Since the coin is on a horizontal turntable, the normal force N must balance the weight of the coin. So N = mg, where m is the mass of the coin and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

But wait, the coin's mass might cancel out. Let me see. The centripetal force needed is F_c = m * ω² * r, where ω is the angular velocity in radians per second and r is the radius (distance from the center). Since at maximum distance, F_c equals the maximum static friction, so:

μs * mg = m ω² r

Oh, the mass cancels out. So r = (μs * g) / ω².

That's good because I don't know the mass of the coin, but it doesn't matter.

Now I need to calculate ω. The turntable is rotating at 33.3 revolutions per minute (rpm). To convert that to radians per second, since one revolution is 2π radians, and one minute is 60 seconds. So:

ω = 33.3 rev/min * 2π rad/rev / 60 sec/min.

Let me compute that. 33.3 divided by 60 is approximately 0.555. Multiply by 2π: 0.555 * 2π ≈ 3.49 rad/s. Wait, wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

33.3 * 2 = 66.6, then 66.6 * π is approximately 209.2, divided by 60 gives about 3.487 rad/s. So ω ≈ 3.487 rad/s.

Wait, but 33.3 rpm is actually approximately equal to 33.3/60 = 0.555 Hz. So 0.555 * 2π = 3.49... yeah, about 3.49 rad/s.

Now plug into the formula for r:

r = (μs * g) / ω².

Given μs is 0.30, g is 9.8 m/s².

So numerator: 0.30 * 9.8 = 2.94.

Denominator: (3.487)^2. Let's compute that. 3.487 squared is approximately:

3.487 * 3.487. Let me compute:

3 * 3 = 9.

3 * 0.487 = 1.461.

0.487 *3 =1.461.

0.487 *0.487 ≈ 0.237.

Wait, maybe better to compute 3.487^2:

= (3 + 0.487)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.487 + 0.487^2 = 9 + 2.922 + 0.237 ≈ 12.159.

So denominator is about 12.159.

So r = 2.94 / 12.159 ≈ 0.2418 meters.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.242 m. That's really close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can lead to small errors.

Wait, let me compute ω more accurately. 33.3 rpm is 33.3 /60 = 0.555 revolutions per second. So ω is 0.555 * 2π = ?

0.555 * 2 = 1.11, 1.11 * π ≈ 3.4817 rad/s.

So ω squared is (3.4817)^2.

3.4817^2: Let me compute accurately.

3.48^2 = 12.1104.

But 3.4817 is a little more than 3.48.

Let's compute (3.48 + 0.0017)^2 = 3.48^2 + 2*3.48*0.0017 + (0.0017)^2.

3.48^2 = 12.1104.

2*3.48*0.0017 = 0.011832.

(0.0017)^2 = 0.00000289.

So sum is 12.1104 + 0.011832 = 12.122232 + 0.00000289 ≈ 12.122235.

So denominator is about 12.1222.

Numerator is 0.3 *9.8=2.94.

So r = 2.94 / 12.1222 ≈ 0.2424 m.

So approximately 0.242 meters. Looking at the options, option E is 0.242 m, which matches.

So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide, we analyze the forces acting on the coin. The coin is held in circular motion by the centripetal force, which is provided by the static friction force. At the maximum distance, the static friction force equals the required centripetal force:

\[
f_s = \mu_s \cdot N = \mu_s \cdot mg
\]

The centripetal force is given by:

\[
F_c = m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r
\]

Equating the two forces:

\[
\mu_s \cdot mg = m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r
\]

The mass \(m\) cancels out, leaving:

\[
r = \frac{\mu_s \cdot g}{\omega^2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the turntable's rotational speed to angular velocity
The turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute (rpm). Converting to radians per second:

\[
\omega = \frac{33.3 \, \text{rev/min} \cdot 2\pi \, \text{rad/rev}}{60 \, \text{s/min}} = 0.555 \cdot 2\pi \approx 3.487 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the maximum distance
Substitute the values into the formula for \(r\):

\[
r = \frac{\mu_s \cdot g}{\omega^2}
\]

Given \(\mu_s = 0.30\), \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\), and \(\omega^2 = (3.487)^2 \approx 12.159\):

\[
r = \frac{0.30 \cdot 9.8}{12.159} = \frac{2.94}{12.159} \approx 0.242 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated value \(r \approx 0.242 \, \text{m}\) matches option **E**.
