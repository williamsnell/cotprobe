Okay, so I've got this question about a profit function for Y Corporation. Hmm, let's see. The function is π = -10,000 + 400Q - 2Q². I remember that profit functions are usually quadratic, and they can tell us the maximum profit point when the function is at its peak.

Part a) asks what happens if output is zero. Well, if Q is zero, I just plug in 0 for Q in the equation. So that would be π = -10,000 + 400*0 - 2*(0)^2. Which simplifies to π = -10,000. Oh, so that's a loss of $10,000. Got it.

Part b) is about finding the output level that maximizes profit. I remember that for a quadratic function like this, which is a downward opening parabola (since the coefficient of Q² is negative), the maximum occurs at the vertex. The formula for the vertex in a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). 

Here, a is -2 and b is 400. So plugging those in: Q = -400/(2*(-2)) = -400 / (-4) = 100. So the output level that maximizes profit is 100 units. 

Wait, but let me double-check that. If I take the derivative of the profit function, it should give the slope at any point. The derivative dπ/dQ is 400 - 4Q. Setting that equal to zero for maximization: 400 -4Q = 0 → 4Q=400 → Q=100. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, for part a) the answer is a loss of $10,000, and part b) is Q=100. Let me check the options:

Option I says a) Loss of $10,000, b) Q=100. That matches what I got. 

Wait, but let me look again. The options given are from A to J. Option F is a) Loss of 10k, b) Q=50. No, because I calculated Q=100. Option I is a) Loss of 10k, b) Q=100. Yes, that's correct.

The profit function for Y Corporation is given as:

\[
\pi = -10,000 + 400Q - 2Q^2
\]

### Part (a): What happens if output is zero?
If \( Q = 0 \), substitute into the profit function:

\[
\pi = -10,000 + 400(0) - 2(0)^2 = -10,000
\]

This results in a loss of $10,000.

### Part (b): At what output level is profit maximized?
The profit function is quadratic, and since the coefficient of \( Q^2 \) is negative, it represents a downward-opening parabola. The maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is found at:

\[
Q = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 400 \). Substituting these values:

\[
Q = -\frac{400}{2(-2)} = -\frac{400}{-4} = 100
\]

Thus, the output level that maximizes profit is \( Q = 100 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **I: a) Loss of $10,000, b) Q=100**.
