Okay, so I've got this economics question here about marginal cost and average variable cost. Hmm, I need to figure out where they intersect. Let me think back to what I learned in my microeconomics class.

I remember that marginal cost (MC) is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. It's calculated as the change in total cost when an additional unit is produced. Average variable cost (AVC), on the other hand, is the total variable cost divided by the number of units produced. Variable costs are the costs that change with the level of production, like labor and materials.

Now, I think about the shapes of these curves. The marginal cost curve is typically U-shaped because of diminishing returns. It starts low, then increases as production increases. The average variable cost curve is also U-shaped but starts higher and then decreases before increasing again. Wait, no, maybe it's the average fixed cost that does something different. AVC is variable, so it doesn't include fixed costs. 

I remember that the MC curve intersects the AVC curve at its minimum point. Oh right! Because when MC is below AVC, AVC is decreasing, and when MC is above AVC, AVC starts increasing. So the point where MC equals AVC is where AVC is at its lowest. That makes sense because that's the point where adding another unit doesn't lower the average anymore; it's the most efficient point for variable costs.

Looking at the options, option G says "the minimum of average variable cost." That must be the correct answer. Let me double-check the other options to make sure. Option A is about average total cost, which isn't directly related here. Option C is about profit-maximization, which I think relates to MC and MR (marginal revenue), not AVC. Options D and J are about maxima, which doesn't fit since we're talking about the minimum point. So yeah, I'm pretty confident G is the right choice.

Marginal cost (MC) is the cost of producing one additional unit, while average variable cost (AVC) is the total variable cost divided by the number of units produced. Both curves are U-shaped due to diminishing returns. The MC curve intersects the AVC curve at the point where AVC is minimized. This occurs because when MC is below AVC, AVC decreases, and when MC rises above AVC, AVC increases. Therefore, the intersection point is at the minimum of AVC.

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is **G: the minimum of average variable cost**, as it aligns with the economic principle that MC intersects AVC at its lowest point.

Answer: G
