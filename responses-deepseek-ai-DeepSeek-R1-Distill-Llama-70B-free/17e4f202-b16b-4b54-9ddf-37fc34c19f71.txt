Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility products and precipitation of iron hydroxides. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The question says the solubility products (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₂ and Fe(OH)₃ are 1e-17 and 1e-38, respectively. The concentrations of Fe²+ and Fe³+ are each 1e-5 M. We need to find the pH where each hydroxide just begins to precipitate.

Wait, I remember that the solubility product is the product of the ion concentrations at equilibrium. For a metal hydroxide like Fe(OH)₂, the dissolution reaction would be Fe(OH)₂(s) ⇌ Fe²+ + 2OH⁻. So Ksp for Fe(OH)₂ is [Fe²+][OH⁻]^2.

Similarly, for Fe(OH)₃, the reaction is Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻. So Ksp is [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3.

Since we're given the Ksp and the metal ion concentrations, we can solve for [OH⁻] and then find the pH.

Let me start with Fe(OH)₂. Ksp is 1e-17. The [Fe²+] is 1e-5 M. So plugging into the Ksp expression:

1e-17 = (1e-5) * [OH⁻]^2.

Wait, let me rearrange that equation to solve for [OH⁻]. Divide both sides by 1e-5:

[OH⁻]^2 = (1e-17) / (1e-5) = 1e-12.

Take the square root of both sides: [OH⁻] = sqrt(1e-12) = 1e-6 M.

Now, to find pH from OH⁻ concentration. pH + pOH = 14. pOH is -log[OH⁻], so pOH = 6. Therefore, pH = 14 - 6 = 8.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, no. Wait, when I have [OH⁻] = 1e-6, the pOH is 6, so pH is 8. That's correct.

Now for Fe(OH)₃. Ksp is 1e-38. The [Fe³+] is also 1e-5. So using the same approach:

1e-38 = (1e-5) * [OH⁻]^3.

Divide both sides by 1e-5: [OH⁻]^3 = 1e-33.

Take the cube root: [OH⁻] = (1e-33)^(1/3) = 1e-11 M.

Now pOH is -log(1e-11) = 11. So pH = 14 - 11 = 3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because a pH of 3 is very acidic. But Fe(OH)₃ is a base, so it would precipitate in basic solutions. So wait, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let me think again. No, wait, the calculation is correct. If [OH⁻] is 1e-11, the solution is more acidic than basic. Because [OH⁻] is low, meaning H+ is high.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because Fe(OH)₃ is more insoluble than Fe(OH)₂, right? Because its Ksp is lower. So it should precipitate at a lower pH, meaning a higher pH is needed for precipitation. Wait, am I getting this backwards?

Wait, no, Ksp is a measure of solubility. Lower Ksp means less soluble. So Fe(OH)₃ is less soluble than Fe(OH)₂. So it should precipitate more easily, meaning at a lower pH. Because lower pH (more H+) means lower OH- concentration. But wait, hydroxide precipitation happens when OH- is high enough.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. For Fe(OH)₂ to precipitate, you need enough OH- to make the product [Fe²+][OH-]^2 exceed Ksp. So higher OH- (higher pH) is needed for precipitation.

Wait, so for Fe(OH)₂, we found that OH- is 1e-6, which means pH 8. So that's when Fe(OH)₂ starts to precipitate.

For Fe(OH)₃, we found OH- of 1e-11, which is pH 3. That seems too low. Wait, but if the [Fe³+] is 1e-5, and Ksp is 1e-38, which is much smaller, then maybe that's correct. Because Fe(OH)₃ would require a higher OH- concentration to reach its Ksp, but wait, wait, let me re-examine the calculation.

Wait, Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ is [Fe³+][OH-]^3 = 1e-38. [Fe³+] is 1e-5, so [OH-]^3 = (1e-38) / (1e-5) = 1e-33. Cube root is 1e-11. So [OH-] is 1e-11, which is pOH 11, so pH 3.

Hmm, that seems correct. So Fe(OH)₂ starts to precipitate at pH 8, and Fe(OH)3 starts to precipitate at pH 3. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because Fe(OH)3 is less soluble, so it should precipitate at lower pH (higher acidity), right? Because if the solution is more acidic (lower pH), OH- is lower, but for less soluble compounds, they precipitate more easily. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about precipitation when the solution is basic enough. So higher pH (more OH-) would cause precipitation of hydroxides. So to find the minimum pH where precipitation just begins, you calculate the pH where Q equals Ksp. So for Fe(OH)₂, we found that at pH 8, the product equals Ksp, so above pH 8, it would precipitate. Similarly, for Fe(OH)3, at pH 3, the product equals Ksp, so above pH 3, it would precipitate.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because at pH 3, [OH-] is 1e-11. If pH increases, OH- increases, so precipitation occurs when pH is higher than the threshold.

Wait, let me think of it this way: For Fe(OH)₂, when pH < 8, [OH-] is less than 1e-6, so [Fe²+][OH-]^2 < Ksp, so no precipitation. When pH =8, [OH-] is 1e-6, so product equals Ksp, so it just starts to precipitate. So at pH higher than 8, precipitation occurs.

Similarly for Fe(OH)3: when pH <3, [OH-] <1e-11, so product < Ksp, no precipitation. At pH=3, product=Ksp, so precipitation begins. So at higher pH (pH>3), it starts to precipitate.

Wait, but wait a second: Fe(OH)3 is less soluble (lower Ksp), so why does it start to precipitate at lower pH? Because to reach its Ksp, you need less OH-.

Wait, no, wait, the Ksp is lower. Let me think again. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 1e-38, which is much lower than Fe(OH)2's 1e-17. So Fe(OH)3 is less soluble, so it should precipitate more readily, which would mean that it starts to precipitate at a lower pH (since lower pH has lower OH-). Or wait, no, higher pH has higher OH-; so for a less soluble compound, you need a lower concentration of OH- to reach the Ksp. Wait, maybe.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose I have a solution of Fe²+ at 1e-5 M. For Fe(OH)2, Ksp is 1e-17.

So [OH-]^2 = Ksp / [Fe²+] = 1e-17 / 1e-5 = 1e-12. So [OH-] = 1e-6, pH 8.

For Fe(OH)3, [Fe³+] is 1e-5, Ksp is 1e-38. [OH-]^3 = 1e-38 / 1e-5 = 1e-33. So [OH-] is 1e-11, pH 3.

So Fe(OH)3 starts to precipitate at pH 3, while Fe(OH)2 starts at pH 8.

Wait, but in a solution where pH is 8, what happens to Fe(OH)3? Let me think. At pH 8, OH- is 1e-6. So for Fe(OH)3, Q = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 = (1e-5)(1e-6)^3 = 1e-5 * 1e-18 = 1e-23. Which is much larger than Ksp of 1e-38. So yes, Fe(OH)3 would have already precipitated by pH 8.

So this would mean that Fe(OH)3 starts to precipitate at lower pH than Fe(OH)2. So at pH 3, Fe(OH)3 starts to precipitate, and at pH 8, Fe(OH)2 starts.

So the question is, what pH will each hydroxide just begin to precipitate? So the answer would be pH 8 for Fe(OH)2 and pH 3 for Fe(OH)3.

Looking at the options, let me check:

Option I: pH=8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH=3 for Fe(OH)3. Yes, that's option I.

Wait, let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 4 and 9.

B:6 and 11.

C:12 and7.

D:9 and4.

E:10 and5.

F:5 and10.

G:14 both.

H:7 and2.

I:8 and3.

J:11 and6.

Yes, option I is Fe(OH)2 at 8 and Fe(OH)3 at 3. So the correct answer is I.

But wait, wait another thing. I should make sure I didn't mix up Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3 in the options.

In the problem, the first part is Fe(OH)2, then Fe(OH)3.

So option I says pH=8 for Fe(OH)2 and pH=3 for Fe(OH)3. So that's correct.

To determine the pH at which Fe(OH)₂ and Fe(OH)₃ begin to precipitate, we use the solubility product (Ksp) expressions for each compound. The dissolution reactions are:

1. **Fe(OH)₂(s) ⇌ Fe²⁺ + 2OH⁻**  
   Ksp = [Fe²⁺][OH⁻]²  
   Given Ksp = 10⁻¹⁷ and [Fe²⁺] = 10⁻⁵ M:  
   \[
   [OH⁻]² = \frac{Ksp}{[Fe²⁺]} = \frac{10^{-17}}{10^{-5}} = 10^{-12}
   \]  
   \[
   [OH⁻] = \sqrt{10^{-12}} = 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
   \]  
   The pOH is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(10^{-6}) = 6
   \]  
   Since pH + pOH = 14:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - 6 = 8
   \]  
   Thus, Fe(OH)₂ begins to precipitate at **pH = 8**.

2. **Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺ + 3OH⁻**  
   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³  
   Given Ksp = 10⁻³⁸ and [Fe³⁺] = 10⁻⁵ M:  
   \[
   [OH⁻]³ = \frac{Ksp}{[Fe³⁺]} = \frac{10^{-38}}{10^{-5}} = 10^{-33}
   \]  
   \[
   [OH⁻] = \sqrt[3]{10^{-33}} = 10^{-11} \, \text{M}
   \]  
   The pOH is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(10^{-11}) = 11
   \]  
   Since pH + pOH = 14:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - 11 = 3
   \]  
   Thus, Fe(OH)₃ begins to precipitate at **pH = 3**.

### Final Answer:
The pH at which Fe(OH)₂ begins to precipitate is 8, and the pH at which Fe(OH)₃ begins to precipitate is 3. This matches **Option I**.
