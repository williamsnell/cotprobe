Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Gestalt therapy and transference. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer here. Let me start by recalling what I know about Gestalt therapy. 

Gestalt therapy focuses on the present moment and the therapeutic relationship. It emphasizes awareness and the client's experience in the here and now. I remember that Gestalt therapists often encourage clients to explore their immediate feelings and sensations rather than dwelling on past events.

Now, the question is about transference. Transference is when a client redirects their feelings towards important figures in their life (like parents) onto the therapist. In some therapies, like psychoanalysis, transference is a big deal and is analyzed to understand the client's unconscious feelings.

But Gestalt therapy has a different approach. I think Gestalt doesn't focus much on transference. Instead, they might see it as a distraction from the present moment. Wait, but how exactly is it viewed? I'm trying to remember. I think in Gestalt, the therapeutic relationship is authentic, so transference isn't encouraged or seen as useful. They might ignore it or not address it as much.

Looking at the options:

A: Seen as a projection of the therapist's issues. No, transference is usually about the client's projections, not the therapist's.

B: Ignored as it is not relevant. That sounds plausible because Gestalt focuses on the present and might not delve into transference.

C: Created by the client's fantasy. Maybe, but I'm not sure. Transference is more about redirecting feelings, not creating a fantasy.

D: Encouraged to deepen the relationship. No, I don't think so. Encouraging transference is more of a psychoanalytic approach.

E: Seen as a sign of regression. I don't recall this being the case in Gestalt.

F: Considered a sign therapy is progressing. Hmm, maybe, but I'm not sure. Or is it the opposite?

G: Interpreted early in treatment. That sounds more like psychoanalysis again.

H: Worked through via dream work. Gestalt might use dream work, but I'm not sure if that's how they handle transference.

I: Considered a sign of resistance. Not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: In Gestalt therapy, the therapist-client relationship is more of an I-Thou relationship, where both are authentic. So transference might be seen as a departure from that authenticity. So perhaps the therapist would point out the transference and bring the client back to the present.

But the options don't directly say that. Looking again, the options are whether transference is seen as something, ignored, etc.

I think the correct answer is B: ignored as not relevant. Because Gestalt focuses on the present and might not spend much time analyzing transference. Alternatively, maybe it's F: considered a sign therapy is progressing. Or perhaps it's D: encouraged to deepen the relationship, but I don't think so.

Wait, another angle: In Gestalt, the therapist might actually address the transference as it happens, to maintain the here-and-now focus. So perhaps they don't ignore it but work through it. But the options don't have that as an option.

Looking at the options again, option F says considered a sign that therapy is progressing. I'm not sure. Maybe when transference occurs, the therapist uses it to explore the client's current feelings.

Alternatively, in Gestalt, transference is not typically a focus. So the answer might be B: ignored. But I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another thought: I remember that Gestalt therapy doesn't usually focus on transference as a therapeutic tool. They might see it as a distraction and not relevant, thus ignoring it. So the answer would be B.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm not entirely sure about all the details. Maybe I should think about what the other options mean. For example, option F says it's a sign therapy is progressing. If transference occurs, perhaps the client is engaging more deeply, but I'm not sure if Gestalt views it that way.

Alternatively, some sources I've read before suggest that Gestalt therapists might not ignore transference but would address it in the present moment. So perhaps the answer isn't B. But the options don't have an option that says "addressed in the present." 

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Projection of therapist's issues.

B: Ignored.

C: Client's fantasy.

D: Encouraged.

E: Regression.

F: Sign of progress.

G: Interpreted early.

H: Dream work.

I: Resistance.

I think I need to pick between B and F. If Gestalt doesn't focus on transference, then B is correct. But if they do use it as a sign, maybe F.

Wait, another point: In Gestalt, the therapy is more about awareness. So if a client is transferring, the therapist might point it out to increase awareness, but not necessarily ignoring it. So perhaps the answer isn't B. But the options don't include "worked through in the present," so maybe the closest is F.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the main approaches:

- Psychoanalysis: transference is central, analyzed.

- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): doesn't focus much on transference.

- Gestalt: focuses on present, might not delve into transference much, so perhaps they ignore it. So answer B.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another thought: I've read that in Gestalt therapy, the therapeutic relationship is genuine, so transference is not encouraged. Therefore, if transference happens, it's addressed to bring the client back to reality, but the question is about how it's usually handled.

Wait, the question asks, "In Gestalt therapy, transference is usually..." So the options are about how it's viewed.

If transference isn't a focus, then it's ignored. So answer B.

Alternatively, some sources say that Gestalt therapists might view transference as a form of resistance or as a client's way of avoiding the present moment. So maybe option I: considered a sign of resistance.

Wait, that's possible. So if the client is transferring feelings, the therapist might see it as the client avoiding their current emotions or issues, thus a sign of resistance.

But I'm not sure. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall any specific Gestalt principles. The key figures in Gestalt are Fritz Perls, Laura Perls, and Paul Goodman.

Fritz Perls was known for his focus on the here and now and the empty chair technique. He probably didn't focus much on transference. So perhaps the answer is B: ignored.

Alternatively, I've heard that Gestalt therapists don't typically "work with" transference in the way analysts do. They might not ignore it but use it to highlight the client's present experience. But the options don't cover that.

So considering all this, I'm leaning towards B: ignored as not relevant.

In Gestalt therapy, the focus is on the present moment and the authentic therapeutic relationship. Transference, which involves redirecting feelings from significant figures in the client's life onto the therapist, is not typically a central focus. Unlike psychoanalysis, where transference is analyzed extensively, Gestalt therapy tends to view transference as less relevant to the therapeutic process. The approach emphasizes awareness and the here-and-now experience, and transference is often seen as a potential distraction from this focus. While Gestalt therapists might address transference to maintain authenticity, the question asks about the usual approach, which aligns more with ignoring transference as it is not considered relevant to the therapy process.
