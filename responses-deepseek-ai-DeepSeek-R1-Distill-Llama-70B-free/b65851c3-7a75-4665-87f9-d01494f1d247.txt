Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What problems are posed in referring to the many forms of protozoans as belonging to one single animal phylum?

Options:

A: Protozoans can be classified into only two distinct groups based on mobility.
B: Protozoans all live in similar habitats, which negates the need for diverse classification.
C: Protozoans exhibit extreme diversity, taxonomic organization is problematic, and they possess certain plant-like features.
D: Protozoans are a type of bacteria, making their classification straightforward.
E: Protozoans are all the same
F: All protozoans have a similar genetic makeup, which simplifies classification.
G: Protozoans are easy to classify
H: Protozoans are multicellular organisms, which makes them easier to classify into one phylum.
I: The term 'protozoan' refers to a single species with little variation, thus one phylum is sufficient.
J: Protozoans only possess animal-like features

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about protozoans and their classification. Hmm, I remember that protozoans are single-celled organisms, right? But wait, the question is about why referring to many forms of protozoans as a single animal phylum is problematic. 

I think the key here is that protozoans are diverse. They don't all fit neatly into one category. Let's see the options. Option C says they exhibit extreme diversity, which makes taxonomic organization difficult, and they have some plant-like features. That makes sense because I remember some protozoans are photosynthetic, like Euglena, which has chloroplasts. So they can't just be classified as animals only.

Looking at the other options: Option A says only two groups based on mobility. I don't think that's the main issue. They're more diverse than that. Option B says similar habitats, but no, they live in various places. Option D says they're bacteria, which is wrong because protozoans are eukaryotes. Option E says they're all the same, which isn't true. F says similar genetic makeup, but that's not right either. G says they're easy to classify, which contradicts the question. H says they're multicellular, which is incorrect because they're single-celled. I says they're a single species, which is wrong. J says only animal-like features, but C mentioned plant-like features too.

So the correct answer should be C because it addresses the diversity and the mix of characteristics.

The correct answer is C. Protozoans are diverse, making their classification into a single phylum problematic. They also exhibit both animal-like and plant-like features, such as photosynthesis in some species.

Answer: C
