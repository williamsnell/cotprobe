Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cell potential. Hmm, I remember that cell potential is related to electrochemical cells and the flow of electrons. The question gives me a reaction: Ni + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn. I need to find the cell potential and determine the direction of the spontaneous reaction.

Wait, I think I should start by identifying the oxidation and reduction parts of the reaction. So, oxidation is loss of electrons, and reduction is gain. Let me look at the components. Nickel is going from Ni (solid) to Ni²+, so it's losing two electrons. That means Ni is being oxidized. Then, Sn²+ is being reduced to Sn metal. So, the Ni is the anode (oxidation) and Sn²+ is the cathode (reduction).

Now, to find the cell potential, I need the standard reduction potentials for both half-reactions. I remember that standard tables have these values. Let me think: the standard reduction potential for Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni is about -0.25 V or something like that. And for Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn, I think it's around -0.13 V. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact values. Oh right, sometimes I mix up the exact numbers, but I think Ni is more negative than Sn here.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. If Ni is being oxidized, then its reverse reaction (which is reduction) has a potential. So the standard cell potential E°cell is E°cathode minus E°anode. Oh wait, no, wait again. The cell potential is calculated as E°cathode (reduction) minus E°anode (which is the reduction potential of the anode material). But wait, the anode is where oxidation happens. Since the anode is Ni being oxidized, its standard potential is for Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni(s), which is -0.25 V. But since it's being oxidized (reverse), the anode's contribution is the opposite.

So, the cathode is Sn²+ being reduced to Sn. Let's double-check the standard potentials. I think Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn has E° = -0.13 V, and Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni has E° = -0.25 V. So the cathode is higher (less negative) than the anode, meaning the cell reaction is spontaneous as written.

Now, the standard cell potential E°cell is E°cathode - E°anode. So that's (-0.13) - (-0.25) = 0.12 V. But wait, no—the E°anode is the value for the anode's reduction, which is -0.25 V. Since the anode is undergoing oxidation, the actual potential contribution is -(-0.25) = +0.25? Wait, I'm getting confused. No, wait: The standard cell potential is E°cathode minus E°anode. Because E°anode is the potential for the reduction of the anode material. So if the anode is being oxidized, its E° is less than that of the cathode, which makes the cell potential positive.

So, E°cell = (-0.13) - (-0.25) = 0.12 V. But wait, are the numbers right? Because sometimes I get the values mixed up. Let me make sure. Another thought: If I have the standard potentials, the one with higher (less negative) E° will act as the cathode. Since Sn²+ has a higher E° (-0.13) than Ni (-0.25), Sn²+ will be reduced, and Ni will be oxidized. So that's correct.

But wait, the problem gives concentrations for Ni²+ and Sn²+. Oh right, so this isn't under standard conditions (1M concentrations). So I need to use the Nernst equation to calculate the actual cell potential.

The Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q, but sometimes it's written as E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q at 25°C. Since the problem is probably assuming 25°C, I can use the 0.0592 V per log.

The reaction is Ni(s) + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn(s). So the cell reaction quotient Q is [Ni²+]/[Sn²+]. Because solids don't contribute to Q. So Q = (1.3) / (1.0e-1) = 1.3 / 0.1 = 13.

Wait, wait. Let me write the reaction again. The balanced reaction is Ni + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn. So the stoichiometric coefficients are all 1. So the Nernst equation for the cell is E = E°cell - (0.0592/2) * log Q.

Wait, what's n here? n is the number of moles of electrons transferred. In each half-reaction: Ni → Ni²+ + 2e⁻ (oxidation), and Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn (reduction). So total electrons transferred is 2. So n=2.

So, putting it all together. E°cell is 0.12 V as calculated before. Now, Q is [Ni²+]/[Sn²+] = 1.3 / 0.1 = 13. So log Q is log(13) ≈ 1.113.

So plug into the Nernst equation: E = 0.12 V - (0.0592/2) * 1.113.

Calculating (0.0592/2) = 0.0296 V. Multiply by 1.113: 0.0296 * 1.113 ≈ 0.0330 V.

So E = 0.12 V - 0.0330 V ≈ 0.087 V.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.087. The options are 0.15, 0.02, etc. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the reaction. Let me double-check the Nernst equation. Wait, the Nernst equation can also be written as E = E° + (0.0592/n) * log ( [oxidized]^a / [reduced]^b )? No, wait, for the cell, I think I have to consider the reaction as written.

The general form is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q, where Q is [products]/[reactants] as per the cell reaction.

Wait, in the cell reaction, the products are Ni²+ and Sn(s), and reactants are Sn²+ and Ni(s). So Q is [Ni²+]/[Sn²+] as I did before. So that part seems right.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated E°cell. Let me double-check the standard potentials. Another source says the standard reduction potential for Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni is -0.257 V, and for Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn is -0.126 V. So E°cell = (-0.126) - (-0.257) = 0.131 V. Oh wait, that's different from before. So maybe I was wrong earlier when I thought E°cell was 0.12 V. It's actually 0.131 V.

So then, using that E°cell = 0.131 V.

Then, applying Nernst again: E = 0.131 - (0.0592/2) * log(13).

Log(13) is about 1.113, as before.

So 0.0592/2 is 0.0296. Multiply by 1.113 gives 0.0330 V.

E = 0.131 - 0.0330 = 0.098 V. So approximately 0.098 V.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 0.11 V. Or perhaps option A is 0.15, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me think again. The Nernst equation for the cell is E = E°cell - (0.0592/n) log Q. Wait, alternative way: The cell's reaction is Ni(s) + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn(s). So Q is [Ni²+]/[Sn²+] = (1.3)/(0.1) = 13.

So log Q is 1.113. So E = 0.131 V - (0.0592/2)*1.113.

Wait, wait. Another approach: sometimes, the Nernst equation is written as E = E° + (0.0592/n) * log ( [Reactants]/[Products] )? No, I think it's E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q. Wait, depending on how the reaction is written.

Wait, another approach: E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q.

In this case, Q is [Ni²+]/[Sn²+] because the cell reaction produces Ni²+ and consumes Sn²+.

So with Q=13, log Q=1.113.

So E = 0.131 V - (0.0592/2)*1.113.

Calculating 0.0592/2 = 0.0296. 0.0296 * 1.113 ≈ 0.0296 * 1 = 0.0296 and 0.0296 * 0.113 ≈ 0.00334. So total ≈ 0.0329 V.

So 0.131 - 0.0329 = 0.0981 V. Approximately 0.098 V.

Looking at the options, the closest value is 0.11 volts (option I). But let me think if perhaps I messed up the sign somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cell potential I calculated is positive, which would mean the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction. So the cell is producing electricity, and electrons are flowing from Ni to Sn²+.

Wait, but what if the concentrations affect this. The Ni²+ is at 1.3 M, higher than standard, and the Sn²+ is lower than standard (0.1 M). So Le Chatelier's principle says that higher concentration of product (Ni²+) would shift the reaction backward, making the cell potential lower than E°.

Which aligns with what I found: E is less than E°.

So my calculation gives around 0.098 V. The options don't have that, but option I is 0.11, which is close. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the standard potentials.

Wait, perhaps the standard potentials are different. Let me check again: for example, some sources give Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni as E° = -0.25 V, and Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn as E° = -0.13 V. So E°cell is (-0.13) - (-0.25) = 0.12 V.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation using more precise values, E° was 0.131 V. So perhaps the problem expects me to use E° as 0.12 V.

So then, E = 0.12 - 0.033 = 0.087 V.

Still, the options don't have this. So perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, the reaction as written: Ni + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn.

So the anode is Ni, being oxidized to Ni²+. The cathode is Sn²+ being reduced to Sn.

So the standard cell potential E°cell is E°(cathode) - E°(anode). E°(cathode) is Sn²+ → Sn, which is -0.13 V. E°(anode) is Ni²+ → Ni, which is -0.25 V.

So E°cell = (-0.13) - (-0.25) = 0.12 V.

So E°cell = 0.12 V.

Now, using Nernst equation:

E = E° - (0.0592/2) * log Q.

Q = [Ni²+]/[Sn²+] = 1.3 / 0.1 = 13.

So log(13) ≈ 1.113.

So:

E = 0.12 - (0.0296)(1.113) = 0.12 - 0.0329 ≈ 0.087 V.

Hmm, 0.087 is approximately 0.09 V. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me try calculating more accurately. Let me compute 0.0592/2 * log(13).

0.0592 divided by 2 is 0.0296. Log(13) is approximately 1.11394.

So 0.0296 * 1.11394 = let's calculate:

1.11394 * 0.0296:

Let me compute 1 * 0.0296 = 0.0296.

0.11394 * 0.0296: 0.1 * 0.0296=0.00296; 0.01394*0.0296≈0.000412.

So total ≈ 0.0296 + 0.00296 + 0.000412 ≈ 0.03297 V.

So E = 0.12 - 0.03297 = 0.087 V.

Still, no option near 0.087. The options are A:0.15, B:0.02, C:0.25, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should have used log(Q) as the inverse. Because for the reaction, the formula is written as Q = [products]/[reactants]. In this case, products are Ni²+ and Sn(s), and reactants are Sn²+ and Ni(s). So [Ni²+]/[Sn²+] is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reverse. Let me think again: The Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q, where Q is [Ni²+]/[Sn²+].

Wait, but wait another moment. The cell potential is E = E°cell - (0.0592/n) log Q.

But wait, perhaps the reaction is better written in terms of reduction for each half-cell. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of each half-cell's potential.

The anode (oxidation) is Ni → Ni²+ + 2e⁻. The standard potential for the reverse (reduction) is -0.25 V. So the actual potential for the anode (oxidation) would be E_anode = E°_anode + (0.0592/2) log([Ni²+]).

Wait, no, for the anode (oxidation), the Nernst equation would require considering the reverse. So the oxidation is Ni → Ni²+ + 2e⁻. The standard potential for the reduction is E°_Ni = -0.25 V. So the potential for the oxidation would be the reverse: E_anode = -E°_Ni + (0.0592/2) log([Ni²+]).

Similarly, the cathode is Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn. Its E_cathode is E°_Sn + (0.0592/2) log([Sn²+]).

Wait, no, the Nernst equation for a reduction is E = E° + (0.0592/n) log([reactant]/[product]). But for the Sn²+ reduction, the reaction is Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn. So the reactant is Sn²+ and the product is Sn (solid, so 1). So E_cathode = E°_Sn + (0.0592/2) log([Sn²+]).

Wait, no, the general Nernst equation for a reduction is E = E° + (0.0592/n) log([oxidized]/[reduced]). For Sn²+ being reduced to Sn, the oxidized form is Sn²+ and reduced is Sn (so activity is 1). So E_cathode = E°_Sn + (0.0592/2) log([Sn²+]).

Similarly, for the anode (oxidation of Ni), the reaction is Ni → Ni²+ + 2e⁻. The reverse reaction would be Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni, which has E°_Ni = -0.25 V. The Nernst equation for the oxidation (anode) is E_anode = E°_Ni - (0.0592/2) log([Ni²+]).

Wait, because when you reverse the reaction, you reverse the sign of the Nernst equation. So for the oxidation:

E_anode = E°(oxidation) + (0.0592/2) log([products]/[reactants]).

But E° for oxidation is the negative of E° for reduction. So E°_oxidation = -E°_Ni = 0.25 V.

So E_anode = 0.25 V + (0.0592/2) log([Ni²+]/1).

Ah, wait, that might be a better approach.

So let me compute E_anode and E_cathode separately.

E_cathode = E°_Sn + (0.0592/2) log([Sn²+]).

E_cathode = (-0.13 V) + (0.0296) * log(0.1).

Wait, [Sn²+] is 0.1 M. So log(0.1) = -1.

So E_cathode = (-0.13) + 0.0296*(-1) = -0.13 - 0.0296 = -0.1596 V.

Similarly, E_anode = E°_oxidation + (0.0592/2) log([Ni²+]).

E°_oxidation is 0.25 V (since Ni is oxidized, the reverse of its reduction potential).

[Ni²+] is 1.3 M. So log(1.3) ≈ 0.1139.

So E_anode = 0.25 + (0.0296) * 0.1139 ≈ 0.25 + 0.00337 ≈ 0.25337 V.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the anode is where oxidation occurs, so
