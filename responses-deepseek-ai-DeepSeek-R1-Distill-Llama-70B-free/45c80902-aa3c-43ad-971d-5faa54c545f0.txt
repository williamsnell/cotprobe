Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Mill's views on pleasure. Hmm, I remember that Mill was a utilitarian, like Jeremy Bentham, but I think he had some differences. Let me think.

Bentham's utilitarianism was all about the quantity of pleasureâ€”like how much pleasure and how long it lasts. But Mill, I think he added something else. Oh right, he talked about the quality of pleasures. So for Mill, it's not just about how much pleasure you get, but also the kind of pleasure. He said something about preferring higher pleasures over lower ones. Like, intellectual pleasures are better than, say, physical ones because they're more fulfilling in a deeper sense.

So the question is asking what the value of a pleasure depends on according to Mill. The options are about different factors. Let's look at the options.

Option A: its rarity or frequency. I don't think Mill said anything about rarity affecting value. It's more about the nature of the pleasure.

Option B: societal norms and values. Well, Mill was more into the individual's experience but framed within a utilitarian framework. I don't think societal norms directly determine the value of the pleasure for him. It's more about the inherent quality.

Option C: individual's personal preference. Wait, but Mill did say that some pleasures are objectively better. So even if someone prefers a lower pleasure, it's still considered lower. So it's not just personal preference.

Option D: effort required. No, that doesn't ring a bell. The value isn't about how hard you work for it.

Option E: potential pain. Maybe, but I think Bentham considered that, but Mill's focus was more on the quality, not necessarily the pain that comes with it.

Option F: quantity alone. That's Bentham, not Mill. Mill criticized this approach.

Option G: quality alone. Wait, but I think Mill considered both quantity and quality. Wait, no, he emphasized quality but did he ignore quantity? Or did he include it as part of the consideration?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Mill's utilitarianism says that the value is based on both the quantity and quality of the pleasure. Like, when comparing two pleasures, you look at which one has a higher quality, but if they're the same quality, then the quantity matters. So for example, a higher quality pleasure is better even if the quantity is less than a lower quality one. But if two pleasures are of the same quality, the one with more quantity is better.

So the correct answer should be that the value depends on both quantity and quality. Looking back at the options, option I says both quantity and quality. Option G is quality alone, which isn't correct because he does account for quantity as a secondary factor.

So the answer should be I.

Wait, but another thought: in Mill's writing, he says that quality is more significant than quantity. But he doesn't dismiss quantity entirely. So when assessing the value, both aspects are considered. So the correct option is I.

The value of a particular pleasure, according to Mill, depends on both its quality and quantity. Mill, a utilitarian, expanded on Bentham's focus on quantity by emphasizing the importance of the quality of pleasure, arguing that higher-quality pleasures (such as intellectual or moral ones) are inherently more valuable than lower-quality ones (like mere physical gratification). However, he also recognized that quantity plays a role when pleasures are of the same quality. Therefore, the correct answer is that the value depends on both factors.
