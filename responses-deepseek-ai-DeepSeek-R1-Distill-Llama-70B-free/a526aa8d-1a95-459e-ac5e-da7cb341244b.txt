Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about research methods. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about a researcher testing problem-solving skills in participants of different ages: 10, 20, and 30 years old. They're using twenty participants in each age group. The question is asking which research method this is.

Alright, I remember that in psychology, there are several research methods. Let me try to recall them. There's experimental, which involves manipulating variables and seeing the effect. Then there's survey, which is like asking people questions. Case study is when you focus on a single person or a small group in depth. 

Wait, but this question is about age groups. Oh right, developmental psychology often looks at how things change with age. So methods like cross-sectional, longitudinal, or sequential come into play here. Cross-sectional studies take different age groups at the same time, like testing children, adults, and older adults all now. Longitudinal would follow the same group over time, like testing the same people when they're 10, then again at 20, etc., which takes a long time. Sequential might combine elements of both, maybe testing different cohorts over time.

In this case, the researcher is testing twenty people in each of three different age groups. So it's not longitudinal because they're not following the same people over time. So cross-sectional makes sense because they're comparing different age groups at one point in time.

Wait, but what about developmental? Developmental is more the area of study, not the method. The method here is cross-sectional because they're comparing across different ages at the same time.

So looking at the options, F is cross-sectional. Option J is developmental, which is the field, not the method. So the correct answer should be F.

The researcher is testing problem-solving skills across different age groups (10, 20, and 30 years old) at a single point in time. This approach involves comparing data from distinct age groups simultaneously, which is characteristic of a cross-sectional study. 

Option F: cross-sectional is the correct answer because it describes the method used to compare different groups at the same time. Other options like developmental (J) refer to the field of study, not the method.

Answer: F
