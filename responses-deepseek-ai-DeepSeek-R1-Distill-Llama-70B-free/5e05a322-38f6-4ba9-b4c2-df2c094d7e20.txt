Okay, so I need to figure out the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 231. Hmm, I remember that hexadecimal uses base 16, so each digit represents a value from 0 to 15, right? And the letters A to F represent 10 to 15.

Wait, how do I convert from decimal to hexadecimal again? Oh right, I think I need to divide the number by 16 and keep track of the remainders. Let me try that.

So starting with 231. Dividing by 16. 16 times 14 is 224. Oh wait, 16*14=224. So 231 minus 224 is 7. So the first remainder is 7. But wait, actually, when you divide, the quotient is 14 and the remainder is 7. But wait, wait, no, maybe I'm getting this backward. Let me think again.

Wait, the way it works is you take the number, divide by 16, the remainder is the least significant digit, and the quotient becomes the next part. So let's do it step by step.

231 divided by 16. Let me calculate that. 16 times 14 is 224, which is less than 231. 16 times 15 is 240, which is more than 231. So the quotient is 14, and the remainder is 231 - (14*16) = 231-224=7.

So the remainder is 7, which is the least significant digit in hex. Now take the quotient, which is 14, and convert that. But since 14 is less than 16, it's the next digit. So 14 in hex is E, right? Because A is 10, B is 11, up to F as 15. So 14 is E.

So putting it together, the hex number would be E followed by 7. So that's E7. Wait, but looking at the options, option I is E7, so that would be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should verify my calculation. 16 times 14 is 224, plus 7 is 231. So that seems right. So 231 in hex is E7.

Looking at the options, option I is E7. So the correct answer should be I.

To convert the decimal number \(231_{10}\) to its hexadecimal representation, we use the division-remainder method with base 16:

1. Divide 231 by 16:  
   \(231 \div 16 = 14\) with a remainder of \(7\).  
   The remainder \(7\) corresponds to the least significant digit in hexadecimal.

2. Convert the quotient \(14\) to hexadecimal:  
   In hexadecimal, \(14\) is represented by the letter \(E\).

Thus, the hexadecimal representation of \(231_{10}\) is \(E7_{16}\).

From the given options, \(E7_{16}\) corresponds to **option I**.
