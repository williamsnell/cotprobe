Okay, so I have this question about recombinant alpha-iduronidase and which disease it's used to treat. I remember that this has something to do with enzyme replacement therapies. Let me think about the diseases and the enzymes involved.

First, I know that lysosomal storage diseases often result from enzyme deficiencies. Each enzyme is specific to breaking down certain substrates. So, alpha-iduronidase must be involved in breaking down some kind of glycosaminoglycan, maybe?

Wait, Hurler syndrome rings a bell. I think that's caused by a deficiency in alpha-L-iduronidase. Yeah, because I remember that Hurler is also called mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). The enzyme alpha-iduronidase helps break down dermatan and heparan sulfates. Without it, these substances accumulate in the lysosomes, leading to various symptoms like clouded corneas, joint issues, and developmental delays.

So recombinant alpha-iduronidase would replace the deficient enzyme in patients. I think the drug used is called Aldurazyme, or maybe something similar. It's administered via IV to help reduce the symptoms of MPS I.

Looking at the options, option I is Hurler syndrome. So that should be the correct answer.

Other options: Tay-Sachs is hexosaminidase A deficiency, so that's option B. Gaucher is glucocerebrosidase, option H. Fabry is alpha-galactosidase A, option D. Hunter syndrome, which is MPS II, requires iduronate-2-sulfatase, so that's option E. So none of those are the same enzyme as in the question.

Recombinant alpha-iduronidase is used to treat Hurler syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). This condition arises from a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, which is essential for breaking down glycosaminoglycans like dermatan and heparan sulfates. Without this enzyme, these substances accumulate in lysosomes, leading to symptoms such as clouded corneas, joint issues, and developmental delays. The recombinant enzyme replaces the deficient one, helping to alleviate these symptoms. Among the options provided, Hurler syndrome corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
