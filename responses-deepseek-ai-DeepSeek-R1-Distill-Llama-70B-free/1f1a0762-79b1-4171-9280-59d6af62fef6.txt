Question:

Following their law school graduation party, a graduate and his roommate were driving home in an automobile that was owned and operated by the graduate. As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. "The complaint is

Options:

A: admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.
B: inadmissible, because it is considered hearsay.
C: admissible as a declaration against interest.
D: admissible, because the graduate consented to its use.
E: inadmissible, because the roommate is not a party to the lawsuit.
F: inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.
G: admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.
H: admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
I: admissible as an admission.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read it carefully. 

Alright, so the scenario is about a car accident involving a law graduate and his roommate. The graduate was driving his own car, and they hit a motorcycle whose rider got seriously injured. The rider sued the graduate for speeding. Then, the roommate sued the rider for negligence and running a red light. Later, the roommate settled with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. 

At the trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he saw the rider drive through a red light and swerve into their path. Now, the rider is trying to rebut that by offering the roommate's complaint against the graduate, which alleged that the graduate was driving too fast. The question is whether that complaint is admissible.

Hmm. So, the roommate's complaint says the graduate was speeding. Now, the rider wants to use that against the roommate's testimony. So, what's the issue here? It's about hearsay, I think. Because the complaint is an out-of-court statement being offered for the truth of the matter assertedâ€”that the graduate was speeding.

Wait, but wait. The roommate is testifying that the rider ran a red light, and the rider is trying to show that the roommate had previously claimed the graduate was speeding. So, isn't this a prior inconsistent statement? Because the roommate is now saying something different than what he said before.

But wait, prior inconsistent statements are generally admissible if they were made under oath, like in a deposition or a prior testimony. Was the complaint sworn? I think complaints are usually verified, but I'm not entirely sure. If the complaint was verified, then it's under oath. If not, then maybe not.

Alternatively, this could be an admission. Because the roommate is a party opponent? Wait, no, the roommate settled and dismissed the suit. So, the graduate was a party, but the roommate is now a witness in the rider's trial. Or is the roommate a party to this current lawsuit?

Wait, the rider is suing the graduate, and the roommate sued the rider but settled. So in this current trial, the rider is the plaintiff, the graduate is the defendant. The roommate is a witness for the defendant, I think. Because the roommate testified for the defense, saying the rider was at fault.

So when the rider offers the roommate's complaint against the graduate, that's the roommate suing the graduate. The complaint alleged that the graduate was speeding. So, the roommate's own statement is being used against him. 

So, the roommate made a statement in the complaint that the graduate was speeding, and now he's testifying that the rider ran a red light. So, the rider is trying to impeach the roommate's credibility by showing he previously blamed the graduate, implying that maybe the graduate wasn't at fault, so the rider was. So, this is a prior inconsistent statement.

But wait, prior inconsistent statements can be used as substantive evidence if they were made under oath. So, if the complaint was verified, then it's admissible as substantive evidence. If not, then it can only be used to impeach the witness's credibility, not as evidence of the truth of the matter.

So, the options are about which exception applies. Option H is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. But is it admissible under that exception?

Wait, another angle: the roommate is a party to this case? No, in the current trial, the parties are the rider (plaintiff) and the graduate (defendant). The roommate is just a witness. So, the roommate's prior statement in the complaint is being offered by the rider against the roommate's testimony.

Alternatively, could this be an admission under FRE 801(d)(2)? Because it's a statement offered against the roommate, who is a party opponent? Wait, no, the roommate isn't a party opponent here. The parties are the rider and the graduate. The roommate was a plaintiff in a different case against the graduate, but in this case, he's just a witness.

So, if the statement is being offered against the roommate, who is not a party, then it's not an admission under 801(d)(2)(D), because that applies to statements by a party-opponent. So, that rules out option I.

So, it's not an admission. So, the other option is prior inconsistent statement. If the complaint was made under oath, then it's admissible under 801(d)(1)(A) as a prior inconsistent statement. If not, then it can only be used for impeachment, not as substantive evidence.

But wait, in this question, the rider is offering the complaint as evidence. So, if the complaint wasn't made under oath, then it's hearsay and inadmissible as substantive evidence. It can only be used to impeach the roommate's credibility, not as evidence that the graduate was speeding.

So, is the complaint considered a statement under oath? Typically, complaints are verified, meaning they're sworn to under penalty of perjury. So, if that's the case, then the statement would be admissible as a prior inconsistent statement under 801(d)(1)(A). 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if all complaints are verified. Sometimes they are, sometimes not. But in the context of a bar exam question, I think they'd assume it's verified. So, that would make it an admissible prior inconsistent statement. So option H would be correct.

But wait, another thought: the roommate is now a witness, not a party. So, the prior statement is being used by the rider (a party) against the roommate (a witness). So, does that make the statement admissible under the prior inconsistent statement rule?

Yes, because the statement was made under oath in a prior proceeding (the complaint). So, it would qualify as a prior inconsistent statement and thus be admissible as substantive evidence. So option H says it's admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. So that would be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says "admissible as an admission." But I thought that doesn't apply because the roommate isn't a party. So, only if it's a prior inconsistent statement would it be admissible.

So, the answer should be H.

Wait, but in the facts, the roommate dismissed his lawsuit against the graduate as part of a settlement. So, maybe the complaint is no longer part of the record. But that shouldn't matter because the statement was made regardless of the suit's outcome.

Another option is E: inadmissible because the roommate is not a party. But I don't think that's right because prior inconsistent statements can be used against witnesses regardless of whether they're parties.

So, I think the correct answer is H: admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the roommate's complaint against the graduate, which alleged that the graduate was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred." The rider seeks to offer this complaint to rebut the roommate's testimony that the rider drove through a red light and swerved into the graduate's automobile. The analysis focuses on whether the complaint qualifies under any exception to the hearsay rule.

1. **Hearsay Consideration**: The complaint is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted (that the graduate was speeding). This makes it hearsay unless it falls under a recognized exception.

2. **Prior Inconsistent Statement**: The roommate's testimony at trial (that the rider ran a red light) is inconsistent with his prior allegation in the complaint (that the graduate was speeding). If the complaint was made under oath (e.g., verified), it qualifies as a prior inconsistent statement under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(1)(A). This would make it admissible as substantive evidence.

3. **Admission by a Party Opponent**: The complaint does not qualify as an admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(D) because the roommate is not a party to the current lawsuit. The roommate is merely a witness, so this exception does not apply.

4. **Other Exceptions**: The complaint does not fall under other exceptions, such as the business records exception or declarations against interest, as it does not meet the requirements for these rules.

5. **Dismissal of Lawsuit**: The fact that the roommate dismissed his lawsuit against the graduate as part of a settlement does not affect the admissibility of the complaint, as the statement was already made.

Given that the complaint was likely verified (a common assumption in such scenarios) and thus made under oath, it qualifies as a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 801(d)(1)(A). Therefore, it is admissible as substantive evidence to rebut the roommate's testimony.
