Okay, so I've got this problem about a Charge-It revolving charge card. The question is asking me to figure out how much needs to be paid on a $75 balance, what the new unpaid balance will be, and what the annual interest rate is. And then choose the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by breaking down what I know. The card requires payment of one-sixth of the balance each month. That probably means that each month, you pay 1/6 of whatever your current balance is. Additionally, there's an interest charge of 1 and a half percent each month. Wait, is that 1.5% per month or annually? Hmm, the question says it's an interest charge of 1(1/2)%, which is 1.5%. But wait, the last part of the question is asking for the annual rate. So I think the 1.5% is the monthly rate. Because annual rate would be much higher, like 18% or something. So yeah, monthly interest is 1.5%.

So the steps I think are: first, calculate the monthly payment which is one-sixth of $75. Then calculate the interest on the balance before or after the payment? Wait, usually, interest is calculated on the outstanding balance before the payment is made. So maybe I should compute the interest first, then the payment, or is it the other way around?

Wait no, perhaps the payment is made first, then interest is applied? Or maybe it's the other way. Let me think about how credit cards typically work. I'm pretty sure that interest is charged on the unpaid balance, which is after any payments have been made. Wait, no, no. The interest is calculated based on the average daily balance during the billing cycle, which is before the payment is made. So perhaps the correct order is: calculate the interest on the current balance, add it to get the new balance, then subtract the payment made, leaving the new unpaid balance.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Let's say you have a balance of $75. Each month, you have to pay one-sixth of the balance. So the payment is 75 divided by 6, which is 12.5. So $12.50 as the monthly payment. But before that, you have an interest charge. So the interest is 1.5% of $75, which is 1.125. So the new balance would be 75 +1.125 = 76.125, then subtract the payment of 12.50, giving 63.625. But wait, let me check that again.

Wait, no, perhaps the payment is made first, then interest is applied on the remaining balance. Or is it the other way around? Because when you make a payment, it's usually applied to the principal and interest, but the interest is calculated before any payment is made in the cycle.

Wait, perhaps I should model it step by step. Let me take the initial balance as $75.

First, calculate the interest for the month. 1.5% of 75 is 75 * 0.015 = 1.125. So the interest is $1.125.

Now, the total amount owed before payment is 75 + 1.125 = 76.125.

But the payment due is one-sixth of the original balance, so 75 /6 = 12.50. So you pay $12.50, leaving an unpaid balance of 76.125 - 12.50 = 63.625, which is $63.63 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 63.63. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option F is $12.50, $63.50, 19%. Hmm, but 63.625 would round to 63.63, not 63.50. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on the balance after the payment is made. Let me try that approach.

So the initial balance is $75. The payment is one-sixth, so 75/6 = 12.50. So you subtract that first, making the new balance 75 -12.50 = 62.50. Then, apply the 1.5% interest on this new balance. 62.50 * 0.015 = 0.9375. So the new balance becomes 62.50 + 0.9375 = 63.4375, which is approximately $63.44. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options exactly either.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Another approach: the payment is 1/6 of the balance, so 75/6 is 12.50. So the payment is $12.50. But before making the payment, you get charged interest on the balance, which is 1.5% of 75 = 1.125. So the new balance after adding interest is 75 + 1.125 = 76.125. Then, subtract the payment of 12.50, which leaves 76.125 -12.50 = 63.625, which is 63.63. But looking at the options, option H has $12.50 as payment, $62.50 as balance, but that's without the interest. So maybe I'm not considering the interest correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is applied after the payment. Let's see. So initial balance $75. Payment is 12.50, so balance after payment is 62.50. Then, interest is 1.5% of 62.50, which is 0.9375, so total balance is 63.4375, which rounds to 63.44. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking again at the options, option E is payment $13.63, new balance $62.50, and 18% annual. Option H is $12.50, $62.50, 18%. So perhaps the payment isn't exactly 1/6 of 75, but maybe the payment is 1/6 of the balance plus interest.

Wait, perhaps the payment is 1/6 of the balance plus interest. Let me think. So, 75 plus interest of 1.125 is 76.125. Then, one-sixth of that is 76.125 /6 = 12.6875, which would be approximately $12.69. So you pay $12.69, and the new balance is 76.125 -12.6875 = 63.4375, which is about 63.44. But the options don't have that either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see the possible options. Let's look for the options where the payment is either 12.50 or 13.63 or 14.63, etc.

Option A: 15, 60, 18%. So payment is 15, which is 75/5. Hmm, but the problem says one-sixth, which is 12.50.

Option B: 14.63, 60.37, 20%. So 14.63 is about 75*(0.195) but that's maybe including interest.

Option E: 13.63, 62.50, 18%. Let's see, 13.63 is the payment, which would be 75 * 0.1818... which is roughly 1/5.5, not 1/6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the payment is 1/6 of the balance before interest. So 75/6 is 12.50. So payment is 12.50. The interest is 1.5% of 75, which is 1.125. So total owed with interest is 76.125. Then, subtract the payment of 12.50, leaves 63.625, which is 63.63.

Looking at the options, option H is payment 12.50, new balance 62.50, but that's without the interest. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, am I calculating the interest correctly after the payment? Or perhaps the interest is applied to the unpaid balance after the payment.

Wait, perhaps the process is: each month, you pay 1/6 of the balance, then interest is applied on the remaining balance.

So let's recalculate:

Initial balance: 75.

Payment: 75 /6 = 12.50.

Balance after payment: 75 -12.50 =62.50.

Interest on this new balance: 62.50 * 0.015 = 0.9375.

So new balance is 62.50 + 0.9375 =63.4375, which is 63.44.

But none of the options have 63.44. Option H has 62.50 after payment, but that's before adding interest. Hmm. So maybe this approach isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is applied before the payment is made.

So initial balance 75.

Interest: 75 *0.015=1.125.

New balance: 76.125.

Payment: 76.125 /6 =12.6875.

So payment is 12.69, and new balance is 76.125 -12.6875=63.4375, which again is about 63.44.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the payment is 1/6 of the original balance, not the interest-inclusive balance. So 75/6 is 12.50. So you pay 12.50, and then interest is applied on the new balance of 62.50, which is 0.9375, making it 63.4375.

But again, none of the options have this. Hmm.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: payment 13.63, balance 62.50, 18% annual. Wait, 13.63 is approximately 75 * 0.1818, which is 1/5.5. Maybe not.

Option I: payment 13.13, balance 61.87, 18%. 13.13 is roughly 75 * 0.175, which would be 1/6 is about 0.1666, so 13.13 is higher than that.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the annual interest rate. The monthly rate is 1.5%, so the annual rate would be 1.5% *12, which is 18%. So the annual rate is 18%.

So looking at the options, any option with 18% as annual rate could be correct. Let's see which options have 18%: A (18%), E (18%), G (17%), H (18%), I (18%).

So possible options are A, E, G, H, I.

Now, the payment is one-sixth of the balance, which is 75/6=12.50. So any option with payment 12.50 is H and F.

Wait option H says payment is 12.50, new balance 62.50, 18% annual. So let me see: if payment is 12.50, then new balance would be 75-12.50=62.50, but then add interest on 62.50, which would be 62.50 *0.015=0.9375, so total 63.4375. But option H says the new balance is 62.50. That doesn't include the interest. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated on the original balance before payment. So 75*0.015=1.125, added to 75 making 76.125. Then payment is 12.50, leaving 63.625, which rounds to 63.63. But none of the options have that.

Wait, option E says payment 13.63, balance 62.50, 18% annual. Let me see how that could happen. If 13.63 is the payment, what's 75 + interest - payment =62.50.

So 75 + interest -13.63=62.50.

So interest would be 62.50 +13.63 -75= 0.13. That can't be right because 1.5% of 75 is 1.125.

Alternatively, perhaps the payment includes the interest. So the payment is 1/6 of the balance plus any interest.

Wait, maybe the payment is 1/6 of (balance + interest). Let me calculate that: 75 +1.125=76.125. 76.125 /6=12.6875. So payment is 12.69. Then, new balance is 76.125 -12.6875=63.4375. Again, not matching any options.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one makes sense.

Option E: payment $13.63, balance $62.50, 18% annual.

Let me check how 13.63 is calculated. 13.63 is approximately 75 * 0.1818, which is roughly 1/5.5. Not exactly 1/6. Alternatively, perhaps the payment is calculated as 1/6 of the balance after adding interest.

Wait, 75 +1.125=76.125. 76.125 /6=12.6875≈12.69, not 13.63. So maybe that's not the case.

Option I: payment 13.13, balance 61.87, 18%. Let's see, 13.13 is 75 * 0.175, which is roughly 1/5.714. Not 1/6.

Option B: payment 14.63, balance 60.37, 20% annual. 14.63 is 75 * 0.195, which is close to 1/5.1. Not 1/6.

Option J: payment 14.63, balance 61.50, 19%. Not sure.

Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about how the monthly payment and interest work together.

The monthly payment is 1/6 of the balance, so 75/6=12.50. So the payment is $12.50.

The interest is 1.5% of the balance. So 75 *0.015=1.125.

So the new balance after payment and adding interest would be 75 -12.50 +1.125 =63.625, which is $63.63. But none of the options have this.

Wait, looking at the options, option E has a new balance of $62.50. How could that happen?

If the new balance is 62.50, then:

After payment and interest, balance is 62.50.

So 75 - payment + interest =62.50.

So payment - interest = 75 -62.50=12.50.

So payment =12.50 + interest.

But the interest is 1.5% of what? If it's 1.5% of the original balance, 1.125, then payment would be 12.50 +1.125=13.625, which is approximately $13.63.

So payment is 13.63, new balance is 62.50, annual rate 18%.

Wait, but how does that work? Because the payment is supposed to be 1/6 of the balance, which is 75/6=12.50, but that would mean the payment is 13.63 instead. So that would imply that perhaps the payment is calculated after adding the interest.

Wait, perhaps the payment is 1/6 of (balance + interest). So 75 +1.125=76.125. 76.125 /6=12.6875≈12.69. Then new balance is 76.125 -12.6875=63.4375≈63.44. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the payment is 1/6 of the balance, and then the interest is applied on the remaining balance.

So:

Payment: 75 /6=12.50.

Balance after payment: 75-12.50=62.50.

Interest on 62.50: 62.50 *0.015=0.9375.

New balance:62.50 +0.9375=63.4375≈63.44.

But again, no option matches this.

Wait, but option E has payment 13.63, balance 62.50, 18% annual. Let me check if that could be correct.

If the payment is 13.63, then the balance after payment would be 75 -13.63=61.37. Then, interest on that would be 61.37 *0.015≈0.9205. So new balance would be 61.37 +0.9205≈62.29, which is about 62.29, not 62.50.

Hmm, not quite matching. Alternatively, maybe the interest is applied before the payment. Let me try that.

Initial balance:75.

Interest:75*0.015=1.125.

Balance after interest:76.125.

Payment:76.125 /6≈12.6875.

New balance:76.125 -12.6875≈63.4375.

But this doesn't match any option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the payment is 1/6 of the original balance, and then interest is applied on the new balance.

So:

Payment:12.50.

Balance after payment:75-12.50=62.50.

Interest:62.50 *0.015=0.9375.

New balance:63.4375≈63.44.

But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the interest is applied on the original balance, added, and then the payment is made as 1/6 of the new balance.

So:

75 + (75*0.015)=76.125.

Payment:76.125 /6≈12.6875.

New balance:76.125 -12.6875≈63.4375.

Again, no matching option.

This is getting confusing. Let me go back to the annual interest rate. It's definitely 18%, as 1.5% per month times 12 is 18%. So options with 18% are possible.

Looking at option E: payment 13.63, balance 62.50, 18%. Let me see how that could happen.

If the payment is 13.63, which is 75 *0.1818≈1/5.5.

But 1/6 of 75 is 12.50, so that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the payment is 1/6 of the balance after interest.

So 75 +1.125=76.125. 76.125 /6=12.6875≈12.69.

But that doesn't match option E's
