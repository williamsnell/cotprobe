Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

Alright, the problem is about a solid glass sphere with radius R and an index of refraction of 1.50. One hemisphere is silvered over, so it's like a mirror on that half. There's a small object located on the axis of the sphere at a distance 2R from the unsilvered surface. I need to find where the image is formed by the refracting and reflecting surfaces. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, okay. So the setup is a glass sphere, with one half silvered. The object is outside the sphere, right? Because the unsilvered surface is where the object is placed. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the object is on the axis at a distance 2R from the unsilvered surface. So the unsilvered surface is the front, and the silvered part is the back hemisphere. So the object is 2R away from the front surface.

Wait, no, wait. Let me visualize this. The sphere is a solid glass sphere, so it's a ball. One hemisphere is silvered, meaning it's a mirror. So if you imagine looking at it, the front is glass, and the back is mirrored. So the object is placed on the axis, 2R away from the unsilvered surface. So the unsilvered surface is the part facing the object. So the sphere is between the object and the mirror.

Wait, no, the object is outside the sphere. The sphere's radius is R. So the distance from the object to the unsilvered (glass) surface is 2R. So from the object to the glass surface is 2R, then the sphere has radius R, so the other side (the silvered part) is R away from the glass surface. So the object is outside, 2R from the glass, and the mirror is on the opposite side of the sphere from the object.

So the light from the object first goes through the glass sphere, then reflects off the silvered part. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the object is on the axis. The light would enter the glass sphere, go through it, hit the mirrored surface, which reflects it back, and then the light exits the sphere again. So it's like the sphere is acting as a lens and then a mirror.

So the image is formed due to both refraction and reflection. So this is a problem involving both a lens (the glass sphere) and a mirror (the silvered hemisphere).

I think the process is: first, the object is at 2R from the glass surface. The light goes through the glass sphere, which is a refracting surface, and then reflects off the mirrored surface, then comes back through the glass.

Wait, but the sphere is solid glass, so when light enters, it's going through a spherical surface. So first, I should calculate where the image is formed after refraction through the glass sphere. Then, since the other side is silvered, that image would act as an object for the mirror. Then, the mirror would produce another image, which would then go back through the glass sphere, which would refract it again.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to model the process step by step. Let's see.

First, the object is at a distance u1 from the glass surface (the unsilvered part). u1 is 2R. The glass has an index of refraction n = 1.50. The sphere's radius is R.

So when the object is outside the sphere, the light rays enter the sphere, refract, go through the glass, then hit the silvered surface, which is a mirror. So that mirror will reflect the refracted rays back into the sphere, which then exit the sphere again, forming the image.

So perhaps the process is similar to a lens followed by a mirror. So first, compute the image formed by the glass sphere (acting as a lens) when the object is at 2R from its surface. Then, that image becomes the object for the mirror, which is at a distance equal to the radius of the sphere (R) behind the glass.

Wait, but wait. The sphere is solid, so the distance from the glass surface to the mirror is R, right? Because the sphere's radius is R, so the other side is R away from the glass.

So first step: object is at 2R from the glass. The glass sphere's radius is R. So let's model this as a spherical refracting surface. The formula for the image formed by a spherical surface is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, but wait, no, the formula is 1/di = (n-1)(1/R) + 1/do, but wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the formula for a single spherical refracting surface is:

1/di = (n - 1) * (1/R) + (1/do),

but wait, I think the correct formula is (n-1)(1/R) when the object is in a particular medium. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is:

1/di = (n₂/n₁ - 1)(1/R) + (1/do)

Wait, no, alternatively, the formula is:

n₁/u + n₂/u' = (n₂ - n₁)/R,

where u is the object distance in medium 1, u' is the image distance in medium 2, R is the radius of curvature (positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light), and n₁ and n₂ are the refractive indices of the object and image spaces.

In this case, the object is in air (n₁=1), and the sphere is glass (n₂=1.5). The surface is convex towards the object, so R is positive. Wait, the glass sphere is convex on the outside. So R is positive.

So the formula should be n₁/u + n₂/u' = (n₂ - n₁)/R.

Let me plug in the numbers:

n₁ = 1.0, u = 2R (object distance is 2R in front of the surface).

n₂ = 1.5.

So,

(1.0)/(2R) + (1.5)/u' = (1.5 - 1.0)/R

Simplify the right-hand side: (0.5)/R.

So,

(1)/(2R) + (1.5)/u' = 0.5/R.

Multiply both sides by 2R to eliminate denominators:

1 + 3R/u' = 1.

Wait, let's compute each term:

Left side: (1)/(2R) + (1.5)/u' = 0.5/R.

Let me compute each term:

(1)/(2R) = 0.5/R.

So 0.5/R + (1.5)/u' = 0.5/R.

Subtract 0.5/R from both sides:

(1.5)/u' = 0.

Hmm, that can't be right. Because that would imply u' is infinite, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait. Did I get the sign of R correct?

In the formula, R is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light.

In this case, the glass sphere's surface is convex towards the object (since the object is outside), so R is positive.

So the equation is correct.

Wait, but when I plug in the numbers, I get 0.5/R + (1.5)/u' = 0.5/R.

So subtracting 0.5/R from both sides gives (1.5)/u' = 0 => u' approaches infinity. That can't be right. That would imply that the image is formed at infinity, which would mean the rays are parallel after refraction, which would happen if the object is at the focal point of the lens.

Wait, so perhaps the object is at the focal point of the glass sphere acting as a lens. That would cause the image to be at infinity. But wait, let's confirm.

Wait, the focal length of a spherical surface is given by f = (n₂ R)/(n₂ - n₁). Wait, no, the formula for a single refracting surface is 1/f = (n₂ - n₁)/R.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the focal length of a single surface is f = (n₂ R)/(n₂ - n₁) when the surface is convex. So for our case, n₂=1.5, n₁=1.0, R is R.

So f = (1.5 * R)/(1.5 - 1.0) ) = (1.5 R)/(0.5) ) = 3 R.

Wait, so the focal length is 3R. So if the object is placed at 2R from the surface, which is inside the focal length (since 2R < 3R), then the image formed would be real and on the other side of the surface.

Wait, but earlier, plugging into the formula gave me u' approaching infinity, which suggests that the image is at infinity. That would mean the object is at u = f, because when you place an object at the focal point of a converging lens (or a refracting surface), the image is at infinity.

Wait, but according to the focal length calculation, the focal length is 3R. So if the object is at 2R from the surface, which is less than f, that would mean it's inside the focal length, and the image would be virtual, but wait, wait, no. Wait, for a converging surface (convex), when the object is between the surface and the focal point, the image is virtual and behind the surface. But in our case, the object is in air, and the refracting surface is the glass sphere. So when the object is placed at u = 2R, which is less than f =3R, so it's inside the focal length.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that the image is at u' approaching infinity. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Let me redo the equation:

n₁/u + n₂/u' = (n₂ - n₁)/R.

Plugging in the values:

1/(2R) + 1.5/u' = (1.5 - 1)/R.

Which is:

1/(2R) + 1.5/u' = 0.5/R.

Let me subtract 1/(2R) from both sides:

1.5/u' = 0.5/R - 1/(2R) = (0.5 - 0.5)/R = 0.

So 1.5/u' = 0 → u' approaches infinity.

Ah, so that suggests that the image is at infinity. So this would imply that the object is at the focal point. Because when the object is at the focal point, the image is at infinity. Wait, but earlier calculation of focal length was 3R. So if the object is at 2R from the surface, which is less than 3R, that's not the focal point. So this leads me to a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the focal length. Let me think again. The focal length of a single refracting surface is given by f = (n₂ R)/(n₂ - n₁). So with n₂=1.5, R=R, n₁=1.0.

So f = (1.5 * R) / (0.5) ) = 3R, as before.

So if the object is at a distance u=2R in front of the surface, which is less than f=3R, then the image should be virtual and located at u' = ?

Wait, but according to the equation, when u=2R, u' is infinity. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should model the glass sphere as a lens with two surfaces. But wait, no, the sphere is a single refracting surface because the other side is silvered. So it's more like a plano-convex lens, but only the curved surface is there, and the flat surface is a mirror.

Wait, perhaps I should treat the glass sphere as a single refracting surface followed by a mirror.

So first, the object is at 2R from the glass surface. The light refracts into the glass, then reflects off the mirror (the silvered hemisphere), which is at a distance R behind the glass surface (since the sphere's radius is R).

Wait, wait. The glass sphere's center is at a distance R from the glass surface. So when the light enters the glass at the front surface, it travels through the glass, and then hits the mirror at the back, which is R away from the front surface.

So the light goes through the glass, which is a distance R thick, then reflects.

Wait, but perhaps the first step is to find the image formed by the glass surface, then use that image as the object for the mirror.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that the image after the glass surface is at infinity. So if the image is at infinity, then the mirror would reflect it back. So the mirror would produce an image that's symmetric, but considering that the image is at infinity, perhaps the final image after reflection is also at a certain position.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

First, the object is at distance u = 2R from the glass surface. The glass sphere has radius R and n=1.5.

So the first refraction happens at the glass surface.

Using the formula:

n₁/u + n₂/u' = (n₂ - n₁)/R.

Here, n₁=1, u=2R, n₂=1.5, R=R.

So:

(1)/(2R) + (1.5)/u' = 0.5/R.

Subtracting (1)/(2R) from both sides:

(1.5)/u' = 0.5/R - 0.5/R = 0.

So u' approaches infinity. So that suggests that the refracted rays are parallel, meaning that the image is at infinity. Therefore, the light entering the glass would travel parallel after refraction.

Wait, that can't be right because for a convex surface with n₂ > n₁, when the object is placed between the surface and the focal point, the image is virtual and located behind the surface. But our calculation suggests u' is infinite. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the sign conventions correctly. Let me double-check the formula.

The formula is:

n₁ * (1/u) + n₂ * (1/u') = (n₂ - n₁) / R.

In this case, u is positive because it's in front of the surface. R is positive because the surface is convex towards the incoming light.

So plugging the numbers:

(1)/(2R) + (1.5)/u' = (0.5)/R.

Subtract (1)/(2R) from both sides:

(1.5)/u' = (0.5/R) - (1)/(2R) = (1 - 0.5)/R → 0.5/R - 0.5/R = 0.

So (1.5)/u' = 0 → u' = infinity.

Hmm, so the refracted rays are parallel, implying that the object is at the focal point of the glass surface. But earlier, the focal length was 3R. So if u=2R is not the focal point, why is u' infinity?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the focal length of a single surface versus a lens. Because a single refracting surface's focal length is f = (n₂ R) / (n₂ - n₁).

In this case, f = (1.5 R) / 0.5 = 3R, as before.

So if the object is placed at u = 2R, which is less than f =3R, then according to the lens formula, the image should be virtual, and located at u' given by 1/u' = (n₂ -n₁)/R - n₁/(n₂ u).

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula for a single refracting surface.

Wait, another approach: the object is at u = 2R. The image formed by the glass surface is at u'.

Using the formula:

1/u' = [(n₂ - n₁)/R] + [n₁/(n₂ u)].

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the lensmaker's equation for a single surface.

Alternatively, perhaps using ray optics. Let's consider a ray parallel to the axis. It hits the glass sphere. The point of incidence is at radius R from the center. The angle of incidence can be determined, then the angle of refraction, and see where it goes.

Wait, perhaps this might take too long, but I'm stuck on why the image is at infinity when u=2R < f=3R.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the image is at infinity after the glass surface. Then, the mirror is at a distance R from the glass surface (since the sphere's radius is R), so the distance from the image (at infinity) to the mirror is also R.

Wait, but the mirror is on the other side of the glass sphere, right? So the object is 2R from the glass, the glass is R thick, so the distance from the object to the mirror is 3R.

But when the image after the glass is at infinity, that means the light rays are parallel. So when these parallel rays hit the mirror, they reflect back as parallel rays. Then, upon exiting the glass sphere, those rays would converge to a point.

Wait, no. Wait, the mirror is at the back of the glass sphere. So the parallel rays enter the glass, go through, reflect off the mirror, then go back through the glass sphere.

Wait, but if the incoming rays are parallel after refraction, then when they hit the mirror (which is at the center of the sphere?), wait, no. The mirror is on the hemisphere, so the back surface is at R distance from the glass surface.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the glass sphere acting as a lens, and then a mirror placed at a distance R from the lens.

So after the lens (glass sphere), the image is at infinity. Then, the mirror is placed at a distance R from the lens. So the image at infinity is  R away from the mirror. So the mirror would create an image that is 2R behind the mirror, but since the image is at infinity, the mirror's reflection would form an image at 2R behind the mirror, but considering the mirror's position, that's 2R + R = 3R from the original lens.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the mirror as being at the focal point of the lens. Because
