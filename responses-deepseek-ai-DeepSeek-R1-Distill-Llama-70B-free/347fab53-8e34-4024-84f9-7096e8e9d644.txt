Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is: "Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma." The variables given are j for José, k for Kevin, and w for Wilma. The predicate is Ixyz, which stands for "x introduces y to z."

Hmm, I need to figure out how to structure this. So, the predicate Ixyz means x is the one doing the introducing, y is the person being introduced, and z is the person to whom y is being introduced. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I get the order right. The way it's written, Ixyz is x introduces y to z. So, x is the introducer, y is the person being introduced, and z is the person they're being introduced to.

So the sentence is: Wilma introduces Kevin to José. Because the sentence says Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma. So the structure is that Wilma is the one doing the action, Kevin is the one being introduced, and José is the one he's being introduced to.

Wait, no, actually, the sentence is "Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma." So the subject is Kevin, but he's the one being introduced. The action is done by Wilma. So the structure is: Wilma (the introducer) introduces Kevin (the one being introduced) to José (the one he's being introduced to).

So in terms of Ixyz, x is Wilma (w), y is Kevin (k), and z is José (j). So the predicate would be Iw k j. 

Wait, but in the options, how is that represented? Let's look at the options.

The options are from A to I. Each option is a combination of letters. Let me list them out:

A: Ijkw
B: Iwjw
C: Iwjk
D: Ijwk
E: Ikkj
F: Ijjk
G: Iwwk
H: Ikjw
I: Iwkj

Wait, so each option is a three-letter combination after the I. Let me think about each part.

So x is Wilma, so the first letter after I is w. Then y is Kevin (k), and z is José (j). So the structure should be I w k j. So the letters after I would be w, then k, then j. So the entire predicate would be IwkJ, but in the options, the letters are lowercase, so IwkJ would be Iwkj, but looking at the options, option C is Iwjk, and option I is Iwkj.

Wait, wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me double-check. The predicate is Ixyz, where x is the introducer, y is the one introduced, and z is the one to whom y is introduced. So in "Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma," the introducer is Wilma (w), the one introduced is Kevin (k), and the one to whom he's introduced is José (j). So x=w, y=k, z=j. So the formula should be IwkJ, which would be Iwkj, because the letters after I are w, then k, then j. So looking at the options, option C is Iwjk, which would mean w as x, j as y, and k as z. That doesn't fit because y should be Kevin (k), not José (j). Option I is Iwkj, which is w, k, j, which fits.

Wait, but let me read the options again. Option C is Iwjk, which would be w introducing j to k. That would mean Wilma introduces José to Kevin, which is the opposite of what the sentence says. So that's not correct.

Option I is Iwkj, which is w introducing k to j. So Wilma introduces Kevin to José, which matches the sentence.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A: Ijkw → j introduces k to w

B: Iwjw → w introduces j to w

C: Iwjk → w introduces j to k

D: Ijwk → j introduces w to k

E: Ikkj → k introduces k to j

F: Ijjk → j introduces j to k

G: Iwwk → w introduces w to k

H: Ikjw → k introduces j to w

I: Iwkj → w introduces k to j

So yes, option I is Iwkj, which is w introducing k to j, which is correct because the sentence is Wilma introducing Kevin to José.

Wait, but I thought the correct answer would be option C, but I think I confused the order. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the order of y and z. Let me think again.

The sentence is "Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma." So the structure is: Wilma (agent) introduces Kevin (theme) to José (recipient). So in terms of the predicate Ixyz, x is the agent, y is the theme, and z is the recipient.

So x = w, y = k, z = j. So the formula is I(w, k, j), which would be Iwkj, which is option I.

So the correct answer should be option C or I? Wait, no, option C is Iwjk, which is w, j, k. That would mean Wilma introduces José to Kevin, which is not what the sentence says. The sentence says Kevin is introduced to José, so Wilma introduces Kevin to José. So y is Kevin (k), z is José (j). So the correct order is w, k, j, which is Iwkj, option I.

So the correct answer is option I.

The sentence "Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma" needs to be translated into predicate logic using the predicate Ixyz, where x is the introducer, y is the person being introduced, and z is the person to whom y is introduced. 

Given the variables:
- j: José
- k: Kevin
- w: Wilma

The structure of the sentence is as follows:
- Wilma (w) is the introducer (x).
- Kevin (k) is the person being introduced (y).
- José (j) is the person to whom Kevin is introduced (z).

Thus, the correct translation into predicate logic is Iwkj, which corresponds to option I.
