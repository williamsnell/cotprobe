Question:

A proton enters a solenoid. Upon entry, the proton is moving in a straight line along the axis of the solenoid. Which of the following is a correct description of the proton’s motion within the solenoid?

Options:

A: The proton will be bent in a circular path.
B: The proton will be bent in a parabolic path.
C: The proton will continue in its straight path and slow down.
D: The proton will be bent in a spiral path.
E: The proton will move in a zigzag pattern.
F: The proton will move in a straight path and speed up.
G: The proton will accelerate in its straight path.
H: The proton will oscillate back and forth along the axis of the solenoid.
I: The proton will continue in its straight path at constant velocity.
J: The proton will move in an elliptical path.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a proton entering a solenoid. Hmm, I need to figure out what happens to its motion. Let me think. I remember that solenoids produce magnetic fields when current passes through them. Oh wait, the magnetic field inside a solenoid is pretty uniform and runs along the axis of the solenoid.

Now, the proton is moving along the axis when it enters. So the direction of its velocity is the same as the magnetic field inside. Right, the magnetic force on a moving charge is given by the Lorentz force law, F = q(v × B). Since the velocity and B are in the same direction, the cross product would be zero. That means the force is zero. So the proton shouldn't experience any force.

If there's no force, then the proton should continue moving in a straight line without changing its motion. It won't slow down or speed up because there's no acceleration. So its velocity should stay constant. I remember that in such cases, when a charged particle moves parallel to the magnetic field, it doesn't get deflected.

Let me look at the options. Option I says the proton continues in a straight path at constant velocity. That sounds right. Other options talk about circular or spiral paths, which would happen if the velocity was perpendicular to the field. Parabolic might be if there's some other force, like electric or varying fields, but not here. Zigzag would be more like in an oscillating field maybe. So yeah, I think I is the correct answer.

When a proton enters a solenoid along its axis, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is uniform and parallel to the proton's velocity. The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by \( \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) \). Since the velocity (\( \mathbf{v} \)) and magnetic field (\( \mathbf{B} \)) are parallel, the cross product \( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \) is zero, resulting in no magnetic force acting on the proton. Consequently, the proton continues moving in a straight line at a constant velocity without any deflection or acceleration.

Analyzing the options:
- **A, B, D, E, F, G, H, J**: These describe paths or behaviors that would occur if the proton experienced a force, which is not the case here.
- **I**: Correctly states that the proton continues in a straight path at constant velocity.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I**

Answer: I
