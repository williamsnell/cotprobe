Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the temperature at the center of an uninsulated metal wire. Hmm, let me see. I remember that when electricity flows through a wire, it generates heat, and this heat has to be dissipated. Since the wire isn't insulated, the heat is probably being transferred to the surroundings through convection or something like that.

The problem gives me a bunch of data: the current is 900 amps, the diameter is 0.50 inches. Wait, diameter, so radius would be half of that, which is 0.25 inches. But I might need to convert that into feet because the units for thermal conductivity are in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches, so 0.25 inches is 0.25/12 feet, which is approximately 0.0208333 feet.

The thermal conductivity k is 10 Btu/hr-ft-°F. Got it. The resistance per foot is 0.00015 ohms. Oh, and the heat transfer coefficient h is 6.0 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. Ambient temperature is 65°F. I need to find the temperature at the center of the wire.

I think I should start by calculating the heat generated per unit length of the wire. Since the wire is conducting electricity, the power generated (which becomes heat) is given by P = I²R. But wait, R here is the resistance per foot, right? So P per foot would be I squared multiplied by the resistance per foot.

So I = 900 A, R = 0.00015 ohms per foot. So P = (900)^2 * 0.00015. Let's calculate that. 900 squared is 810,000. Multiply by 0.00015 gives 810,000 * 0.00015. Hmm, 810000 * 0.0001 is 81, and 810000 * 0.00005 is 40.5, so total is 121.5 Watts per foot? Wait, but wait, the units are in Btu/hr. Oh wait, because the other units are in Btu. Hmm, maybe I should convert Watts to Btu/hr.

Wait, 1 Watt is 3.41214 Btu/hr. So 121.5 Watts is 121.5 * 3.41214 ≈ let's see, 120 * 3.412 is about 409.44, and 1.5 *3.412 is about 5.118, so total around 414.56 Btu/hr per foot. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can keep everything in SI units and then convert at the end. Wait, but the thermal conductivity is given in Btu units, so perhaps it's easier to convert power into Btu/hr.

Wait, but wait. I think I might be getting confused here. Let me think again. The heat generated per foot is I² R, which is in Watts per foot. Then, to get into Btu per hour per foot, I multiply by 3.41214. So 121.5 W/ft * 3.41214 = approx 414.56 Btu/hr-ft.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for steady-state heat transfer in a cylinder, which is a common problem in heat transfer.

Oh right, the wire is a cylinder, so the heat transfer would be radially outward. Under steady-state conditions, the heat generated within the wire is conducted to the surface and then convected away.

So the heat generation per unit length is q_gen = I² R, and that's 900² * 0.00015 = 121.5 W per foot, which I think is correct.

Wait, but for heat transfer analysis, perhaps it's better to work in cylindrical coordinates. The general heat equation for a cylinder with uniform heat generation is:

dT/dr = - (q_gen * r)/(k)

Wait, but that's for the temperature distribution when you have heat generation. The solution to this would give the temperature as a function of radius.

Alternatively, the maximum temperature occurs at the center (r=0), and the temperature drops to the surface temperature at r = radius.

So integrating the differential equation, the temperature at the center would be higher than at the surface.

Wait, but I also need to account for the convective heat loss from the surface. So the heat conducted to the surface (q_cond) must equal the heat convected away (q_conv).

So q_cond = q_conv.

The heat conducted through the surface is given by Fourier's law: q = (2πkL) * (dT/dr at r = radius). But wait, for a cylinder, the heat conducted per unit length is q = (2πk L) * (T_center - T_surface)/(ln(r_outer / r_inner)), but wait, no, since it's a solid cylinder, the r_inner is zero. So perhaps a better approach is to find the temperature distribution within the wire.

Let me think about the differential equation again.

The heat equation in cylindrical coordinates (assuming steady-state and symmetry) is:

d²T/dr² + (1/r)(dT/dr) + (q_gen)/(k) = 0

Wait, I might have forgotten the exact form, but I think it's something like that. The solution to this equation gives the temperature as a function of r.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for a solid cylinder with uniform heat generation, the temperature at the center is T_center = T_surface + (q_gen * r²)/(4k)

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I think the formula is T_center = T_surface + (q_gen r²)/(4k), but I need to confirm.

Wait, perhaps I should derive it. The differential equation for steady-state heat transfer in a cylinder with heat generation is:

(1/r) d/dr (r dT/dr) = -q_gen / k

Integrate this equation. Let me set u = dT/dr, then (1/r) du/dr = -q_gen/(k r)

Wait, maybe I should do a substitution. Let me try integrating.

First, the equation: d²T/dr² + (1/r) dT/dr = -q_gen / k

Let me let x = dT/dr, then dx/dr + (1/r) x = -q_gen/(k)

This is a first-order linear ODE. The integrating factor would be e^{∫ (1/r) dr} = r.

Multiplying both sides by r:

r dx/dr + x = -q_gen r /k

Which is d/dr (r x) = - q_gen r /k

Integrate both sides:

r x = - (q_gen/(2k)) r² + C

So x = dT/dr = - (q_gen/(2k)) r + C/r

Now, apply boundary conditions. The temperature must be finite at r=0, so C must be zero. So dT/dr = - (q_gen r)/(2k)

Integrate again to find T(r):

T(r) = ∫ dT/dr dr = ∫ [ - (q_gen r)/(2k) ] dr = - (q_gen r²)/(4k) + D

At the surface, r = R, T(R) = T_surface.

So, T(R) = - (q_gen R²)/(4k) + D = T_surface

Thus, D = T_surface + (q_gen R²)/(4k)

So the temperature at the center (r=0) is T(0) = D = T_surface + (q_gen R²)/(4k)

Ok, that seems correct. So T_center = T_surface + (q_gen R²)/(4k)

But wait, I also need to relate the heat conducted to the surface and the convective heat loss.

The heat conducted per unit length (q_cond) is the same as the heat generated per unit length (q_gen * π R²), because in steady state, all heat generated is conducted out.

Wait, no, because for a unit length, the volume is π R² * 1, so the heat generated per unit length is q_gen * π R² * 1. But Fourier's law at the surface is q_cond = -k (dT/dr) evaluated at r=R, multiplied by the surface area.

Wait, let's think about it. The heat conducted per unit length is the heat flux at the surface multiplied by the circumference and the unit length.

So, q_cond per unit length = -k (dT/dr at r=R) * 2π R * 1 (unit length)

But from earlier, dT/dr at r=R is - (q_gen R)/(2k)

So substituting, q_cond = -k [ - (q_gen R)/(2k) ] * 2π R *1

Simplify: k * (q_gen R)/(2k) ) * 2π R = (q_gen R^2) π

Which makes sense because the heat generated per unit length is q_gen * π R², so it's consistent.

Now, the heat conducted to the surface is lost via convection. So q_conv = h (T_surface - T_ambient) * surface area.

Surface area per unit length is 2π R *1.

Thus, q_conv = h (T_surface - T_ambient) * 2π R

Since q_cond = q_conv,

q_gen * π R² = h (T_surface - T_ambient) * 2π R

Simplify:

q_gen R = 2 h (T_surface - T_ambient)

So,

T_surface - T_ambient = (q_gen R) / (2 h)

Now, substitute into the earlier equation for T_center:

T_center = T_surface + (q_gen R²)/(4k)

But T_surface = T_ambient + (q_gen R)/(2 h)

So,

T_center = [T_ambient + (q_gen R)/(2 h) ] + (q_gen R²)/(4k)

Alternatively,

T_center = T_ambient + (q_gen R)/(2 h) + (q_gen R²)/(4k)

Now, let's compute each term.

First, calculate q_gen. Wait, earlier I had q_gen = I² R = 900^2 * 0.00015 ohms/ft.

Wait, no. Wait, R is in ohms per foot, and I is in amps. So the resistance for a foot is R = 0.00015 ohms.

So the power per foot is P = I² R = 900^2 * 0.00015.

Calculate that: 900^2 = 810,000.

810,000 * 0.00015 = 121.5 W per foot.

Wait, but 121.5 W is in SI units. Since the other parameters are in Btu, maybe I should convert this to Btu per hour.

1 Watt = 3.41214 Btu/hr. So 121.5 W = 121.5 * 3.41214 ≈ 414.56 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, but wait, maybe the units for q_gen are in Btu/hr per cubic foot? Because I think q_gen is the volumetric heat generation rate.

Wait, no, because the way we used it in the equation, q_gen was the heat generated per unit volume. Wait, no, earlier in the differential equation, the term was q_gen, so let me confirm.

Wait, in the differential equation, the term is (q_gen)/(k), so the units of q_gen should be Btu/(hr·ft³), because k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F), and the Laplacian has units of 1/ft². So to get units consistent, (q_gen)/(k) would have units (Btu/(hr·ft³)) / (Btu/(hr·ft·°F))) = 1/(ft²·°F), which matches the Laplacian.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the resistance is given as 0.00015 ohms per foot. So the power per foot is 121.5 W, which is 414.56 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, but the heat generation per unit volume would be q_gen = (I² R) / (Volume per foot). The volume per foot is π R² * 1 ft, which is in ft²·ft = ft³.

Wait, R is 0.25 inches, which is 0.0208333 feet. So R = 0.0208333 ft.

Volume per foot is π (0.0208333)^2 * 1 = π * (0.000434028) ≈ 0.0013617 ft³.

So the heat generated per foot is 414.56 Btu/hr, so the volumetric heat generation q_gen is 414.56 / 0.0013617 ≈ 304,392 Btu/(hr·ft³).

Wait, that's a huge number. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 0.25 inches is 0.0208333 feet. So R = 0.0208333 ft.

Area = π R² = π (0.0208333)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.000434028 ≈ 0.0013617 ft².

So the volume per foot is 0.0013617 ft³.

The heat generated per foot is 121.5 W = 414.56 Btu/hr.

So q_gen = 414.56 Btu/hr / 0.0013617 ft³ ≈ 414.56 / 0.0013617 ≈ 304,392 Btu/(hr·ft³).

Wait, but that seems really high. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I've handled units is wrong. Maybe I should stick to SI units for the heat generation and then convert k and other parameters.

Wait, but the problem gives k in Btu units, so maybe it's easier to convert everything to Btu.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the variables in consistent units.

Let me recast the problem in IP units.

Given:

I = 900 A

Resistance per foot, R = 0.00015 ohms.

So power per foot, P = I² R = (900)^2 * 0.00015 = 810,000 * 0.00015 = 121.5 W/ft.

Convert to Btu/hr: 121.5 W * 3.41214 Btu/(W·hr) = 414.56 Btu/(hr·ft).

Now, the volumetric heat generation rate q_gen is P per unit volume.

The volume of the wire per foot is π R², where R is 0.0208333 ft.

So q_gen = 414.56 Btu/(hr·ft) / (π * (0.0208333)^2 ft²) ) → because volume is area * length, so per foot, it's area in ft².

So volume per foot is π*(0.0208333)^2 = approx 0.0013617 ft².

Wait, no, wait! No, the volume is in ft³, because it's area (ft²) times length (ft). So for a one-foot length, the volume is 0.0013617 ft³.

So q_gen = 414.56 Btu/(hr·ft) / 0.0013617 ft³ → which is 414.56 / 0.0013617 ≈ 304,392 Btu/(hr·ft³).

Hmm, that's a very high value, but perhaps that's correct.

Now, the formula for T_center is:

T_center = T_ambient + (q_gen R)/(2 h) + (q_gen R²)/(4k)

Wait, let me plug in all the values.

T_ambient = 65°F.

R is 0.0208333 ft.

h = 6.0 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

k = 10 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

q_gen is 304,392 Btu/(hr·ft³).

So,

First term: (q_gen * R) / (2 h) → (304392 * 0.0208333) / (2 *6)

Compute numerator: 304392 * 0.0208333 ≈ 304392 * 0.0208333 ≈ let's calculate 300,000 * 0.0208333 = 6,250. So 304392 *0.0208333≈ 6,250 + (4,392 * 0.0208333). 4,392 * 0.0208333 ≈ 91.666. So total numerator ≈ 6,250 +91.666 ≈ 6,341.666.

Denominator: 2*6=12.

So 6,341.666 /12 ≈ 528.472°F.

Second term: (q_gen * R²) / (4k)

Compute R squared: (0.0208333)^2 ≈ 0.000434028 ft².

q_gen * R² = 304,392 * 0.000434028 ≈ let's compute 300,000 * 0.000434028 = 130.2084, and 4,392 * 0.000434028 ≈ 1.905. So total ≈ 130.2084 +1.905 ≈ 132.1134.

Divide by 4k =4 *10=40.

So 132.1134 /40 ≈3.3028°F.

So total T_center =65 +528.472 +3.3028 ≈ 596.7748°F.

Looking at the options, option F is 596°F, option G is 595, H is 592.8, etc.

Wait, but my calculation gave approximately 596.77°F, so the closest option would be F:596°F.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed (q_gen * R)/(2 h), I might have made a miscalculation.

Let me recompute that term.

q_gen = 304,392 Btu/hr/ft³.

R = 0.0208333 ft.

So q_gen * R = 304392 * 0.0208333.

Let me compute 304,392 * 0.0208333 exactly.

0.0208333 is 1/48, because 1/48 ≈0.0208333.

So 304392 * (1/48) = 304392 ÷48.

Compute 48 * 6341 = 48*6000=288000; 48*341=16,368 → 288000+16,368=304,368. So 48*6341=304,368. The difference is 304,392 -304,368=24. So 24/48=0.5. So 304,392 /48 =6341.5.

So (q_gen * R) =6341.5
