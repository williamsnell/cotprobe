Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about conflict and integration models in the development of state societies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, the question is asking about what each model emphasizes in terms of tensions. Conflict models and integration modelsâ€”right, these are probably theories about how societies develop and the factors that drive that development.

I remember that conflict models usually focus on the idea that societies develop because of competition and struggle, often between different groups. So maybe these models look at external tensions, like threats from outside the group, such as other societies or states, which might cause a society to organize more centrally to defend itself or compete effectively. Alternatively, maybe internal tensions, like class struggles or different interests within the society.

Integration models, on the other hand, probably focus on how different parts of a society come together and unify. So maybe they look at internal tensions, like how different groups within a society need to work together, share resources, or integrate their social structures. Or perhaps they consider external factors as well, but in a different way.

Wait, I think I remember something about Elman Service's theories. He talked about bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states. But how does that tie into conflict vs. integration models? Let me think. Oh right, conflict theories (like those inspired by Marx) might argue that state formation happens because of internal class conflicts leading to the need for a controlling mechanism, which becomes the state. So internal tensions here.

Integration models, perhaps, are more about how societies come together through cooperation and shared infrastructure, maybe due to external pressures like trade or shared enemies. So maybe integration models focus on external tensions that require a unified response, leading to state formation.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Another angle: some theories suggest that state formation arises from the need to manage conflicts between different groups within the society. So conflict models would focus on internal tensions. Integration models might instead focus on how external factors, like the need for defense against other groups, drive the integration of various smaller units into a larger state.

So putting it together: conflict models emphasize internal tensions (like class struggles or internal disputes) leading to state development, while integration models emphasize external tensions (like threats from other groups or the need to compete with neighboring societies) leading to integration and state formation.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option F says internal; external. So conflict models emphasize internal tensions, integration models emphasize external. That fits what I was thinking.

Another option is E: external; internal. Wait, that would mean conflict is external and integration is internal. That doesn't seem right. Because earlier I thought conflict was internal, integration external.

Option F is internal then external, which matches my reasoning.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I might be mixing up the terms. Let me double-check. Conflict theories often talk about internal factors, like inequality and class struggle, leading to the development of the state as a tool for the ruling class. So state formation is due to managing internal conflicts. Integration models, on the other hand, might look at how external pressures, like warfare with neighboring groups, lead to the formation of states as a way to organize defense and offense more effectively.

So that would mean conflict models emphasize internal tensions, and integration models emphasize external. So the first blank is internal, the second external. Looking for that in the options.

Option F is internal and external. So the first part is internal, the second external. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not flipping anything. The question says, "conflict models emphasize the importance of __________ tensions in the development of state societies, while integration models emphasize ____________ tensions."

So the first blank is conflict models, which I think is internal, and the second is integration models, which is external. So that's internal and external, which is option F.

The question asks about the types of tensions emphasized by conflict and integration models in the development of state societies. Conflict models focus on internal tensions, such as class struggles or internal disputes, which drive state formation as a mechanism to manage these conflicts. Integration models, in contrast, emphasize external tensions, such as warfare or competition with neighboring societies, which lead to the integration of smaller units into a larger, more organized state. 

Analyzing the options, the correct pairing is internal tensions for conflict models and external tensions for integration models. This corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
