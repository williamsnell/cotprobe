Okay, so I've got this question about internal and external validity, and I'm a bit fuzzy on the concepts, but let's try to work through it. The question is asking which terms correspond correctly to implications for internal and external validity.

Hmm, I remember that internal validity is about whether a study correctly establishes cause and effect. So things that threaten internal validity would be factors that make it unclear whether the independent variable actually caused the effect. On the other hand, external validity is about how generalizable the results areâ€”like whether the findings can be applied to other populations, settings, etc.

Wait, the question is about what each one has implications for. The first blank is about internal validity, and the second about external validity.

Looking at the options, each has two terms. I need to match each term correctly.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Random assignment, temporal precedence. Random assignment is used to ensure that groups are equivalent, which helps with internal validity because it controls for extraneous variables. Temporal precedence is about cause happening before effect, which is part of establishing causality, so also related to internal validity. But wait, the second part is about external validity. So maybe this isn't the right pairing.

Option B: Nonspuriousness, temporal precedence. Nonspuriousness refers to ensuring that the observed relationship isn't due to other variables, which is part of internal validity. Temporal precedence again relates to causation. So both terms seem related to internal validity. Not sure if they fit the external part.

Option C: Generalizability, causality. Generalizability is definitely about external validity. Causality is internal. So the first blank is internal, so the terms would be causality and then generalizability. But the question says first blank is internal, so this would have causality first, which fits. Wait, but the option says generalizability first. No, the first part is about internal validity. So this option is reversed.

Option D: Temporal precedence, nonspuriousness. Both terms are about internal validity factors. So second blank isn't about external.

Option E: Temporal precedence, random selection. Temporal precedence is internal. Random selection is about external validity because it's about how the sample is selected to represent the population. So the first blank is internal (temporal), second is external (random selection). That could be a possibility.

Option F: Nonspuriousness, random assignment. Nonspuriousness is internal, random assignment is an aspect of internal validity as well. So both terms are internal, not fitting the external part.

Option G: Causality, generalizability. Causality is internal, generalizability is external. So the first blank is causality (internal), second generalizability (external). That fits the question: causality has implications for internal, and generalizability for external.

Option H: Random selection, causality. Random selection is external, causality is internal. So first blank would be about internal, which is causality, but the option has random selection first. So that's not matching the question structure.

Option I: Random selection, random assignment. Both are about selection and assignment, but random selection is external, random assignment is internal. So if the first blank is internal, the second external. So in this option, first is random selection (external) which is wrong. Because first blank should be internal.

Option J: Random assignment, random selection. So first is internal (correct), second is external (correct). So this pairing is about internal and external validity. Wait, but the terms in the question are about what has implications for each. So random assignment affects internal validity, and random selection affects external. So this option would fit.

Wait, but I thought G was also a possibility. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is phrased as:

"___________ has implications for internal validity and ___________ has implications for external validity."

So the first term is about internal, the second about external.

Option G: Causality, generalizability. So causality is about internal, generalizability about external. So that would fit.

Option J: Random assignment, random selection. So random assignment (which is about internal) and random selection (which is about external). So that would also fit.

So now I'm torn between G and J.

Wait, the terms in the question are likely to be more about the key aspects. Internal validity is about whether the study supports a causal relationship. So factors like temporal precedence, nonspuriousness, and causality are key.

External validity is about generalization, so random selection (representative sample) and generalizability.

So the correct pairing would be a term related to internal validity and a term related to external.

Option G: Causality (internal) and generalizability (external). That makes sense.

Option J: Random assignment (internal validity because it reduces selection bias) and random selection (external, because it allows generalization). So J would be correct if the terms are about the aspects that affect each validity.

Wait, but the question is phrasing it as "has implications for". So what aspects are tied to each validity.

I think that internal validity is affected by factors like causality (did X cause Y?), and external is about generalizability.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

G: causality, generalizability.

So the first blank is causality (internal), second is generalizability (external). So that would be correct.

But wait, the question is: [first] has implications for internal, [second] for external.

So G would say causality has implications for internal validity, which is correct. Generalizability for external, correct.

Alternatively, option J says random assignment (impacts internal) and random selection (impacts external). So both are correct.

But the question is about which terms fit the blanks. So which options correctly pair the terms.

In the options, the correct pairing would be terms that are about each type of validity.

I think the answer is G: causality and generalizability.

Wait, but another way: internal validity involves things like ensuring that the cause comes before the effect (temporal precedence), that there's no spuriousness, and that there's no selection bias (so random assignment is part of that). So random assignment is a method to ensure internal validity.

External validity is about whether you can generalize the findings. That involves random selection (so your sample is representative) and generalizability.

So the question's first term is something that has implications for internal validity. So it could be random assignment. The second term is something that has implications for external validity, which could be random selection.

Looking at the options, option J is random assignment and random selection. So the first has implications for internal, second for external. That would fit.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to remember the key points.

Internal validity: Did the study establish a causal relationship? Threats include things like selection bias (which random assignment addresses), history effects, maturation, etc. So random assignment is a method to enhance internal validity.

External validity: Can the results be generalized to other populations, settings? Factors include random selection (sampling) and generalizability.

So the statements in the question should be:

Random assignment (impacts internal validity) and random selection (impacts external validity).

Looking at the options, option J is "Random assignment, random selection." So that would fit.

Alternatively, option G is "Causality, generalizability." So the first term is about internal validity, the second about external.

So both G and J could be correct, but the terms might be more precise.

Wait, the question is phrased as which terms have implications. So for internal validity, it's causality. For external, it's generalizability.

No, wait. The question is about what has implications for each validity. So whether variables are causal (internal) or general (external).

Alternatively, the terms could be about the threats. But the question is about implications, so maybe the terms are about what aspects they affect.

I think the correct answer is G: causality and generalizability.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of another approach.

The first part of the statement is about internal validity. So the term should be something that is a key aspect of internal validity.

Internal validity is about whether the cause and effect relationship is truly causal. So key terms include causality, temporal precedence, nonspuriousness, and random assignment (to avoid selection bias).

The second part is about external validity, which is about generalizability. So terms include random selection, generalizability, and whether the study can be replicated in other settings.

So looking at the options, the correct pairing would be a term related to internal validity factors and one related to external.

Option G: causality (internal), generalizability (external) â†’ correct.

Option J: random assignment (internal), random selection (external) â†’ correct.

So both G and J seem correct.

Wait, the question is which option correctly fills the blanks.

The question: [A] has implications for internal validity, [B] for external.

So looking at the options:

G: causality (implications for internal), generalizability (external).

J: random assignment (internal), random selection (external).

Which of these is correct?

I think both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is G. Because causality is about internal validity implications, and generalizability is about external.

But wait, the options are about the implications. So:

Random assignment affects internal validity because it ensures that groups are similar, reducing selection bias. Random selection affects external validity because it allows the sample to represent the population.

So option J is also correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall what the book says.

In experiments, internal validity is about causation. Threats include history, maturation, testing, instrumentation, statistical regression, selection, mortality, and ambient invalidity.

External validity is about generalization. Threats include population validity (sampling bias), ecological validity, temporal validity, and treatment diffusion.

So the methods to enhance internal validity include random assignment. Methods to enhance external validity include random selection.

So the first blank is about internal validity implications, which would be random assignment. The second is about external, which is random selection.

So the correct option is J: random assignment, random selection.

Wait, but the question is phrased in terms of implications, not methods. So the terms could be more about the concepts.

Alternatively, causality is about internal, generalizability about external.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. I think the correct answer is G: causality, generalizability.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: looking for the standard pairing.

I recall that internal validity is about whether the study correctly infers causation. So the key term is causality.

External validity is about whether the findings can be generalized, so the key term is generalizability.

Therefore, the correct option is G.
</think>

The question asks which terms correctly fill the blanks regarding implications for internal and external validity. Internal validity pertains to whether a study establishes a causal relationship, while external validity concerns the generalizability of the findings.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Random assignment (internal validity) and temporal precedence (internal validity). Both terms relate to internal validity, so this does not fit.
- **Option B**: Nonspuriousness (internal validity) and temporal precedence (internal validity). Both terms are about internal validity, so this does not fit.
- **Option C**: Generalizability (external validity) and causality (internal validity). While the terms are correct, they are reversed in the context of the question.
- **Option D**: Temporal precedence (internal validity) and nonspuriousness (internal validity). Both terms relate to internal validity, so this does not fit.
- **Option E**: Temporal precedence (internal validity) and random selection (external validity). This pairing is plausible, but temporal precedence is more specific than the broader concept of causality.
- **Option F**: Nonspuriousness (internal validity) and random assignment (internal validity). Both terms relate to internal validity, so this does not fit.
- **Option G**: Causality (internal validity) and generalizability (external validity). This pairing is correct, as causality is central to internal validity, and generalizability is key to external validity.
- **Option H**: Random selection (external validity) and causality (internal validity). While correct, the terms are reversed in the context of the question.
- **Option I**: Random selection (external validity) and random assignment (internal validity). The first term is about external validity, but the question asks for internal validity first, so this does not fit.
- **Option J**: Random assignment (internal validity) and random selection (external validity). This pairing is correct, as random assignment enhances internal validity, and random selection enhances external validity.

Both **Option G** and **Option J** are plausible, but **Option G** aligns more closely with the broader concepts of internal and external validity. Causality is a fundamental aspect of internal validity, and generalizability is a fundamental aspect of external validity.
