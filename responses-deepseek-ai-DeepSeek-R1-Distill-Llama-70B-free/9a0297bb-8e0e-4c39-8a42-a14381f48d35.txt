Question:

What are the chief differences between plant andanimal cells?

Options:

A: Animal cells have larger vacuoles than plant cells
B: Animal cells have a rigid cellulose wall
C: Animal cells contain chloroplasts
D: Plant cells are typically smaller than animal cells
E: Animal cells can perform photosynthesis, while plant cells cannot
F: Plant cells contain a single large mitochondrion, while animal cells have many small ones
G: Animal cells have a central vacuole, while plant cells do not
H: Plant cells have centrioles, while animal cells do not
I: Plant cells have a rigid cellulose wall, large central fluid sap, contain chloroplasts, and undergo a different process of cell division as compared to animal cells.
J: Both plant and animal cells have a rigid cellulose wall

Okay, so I've got this question about the differences between plant and animal cells. Hmm, I remember that both are eukaryotic cells, so they share some features, but there are some key differences. Let me think through this.

First, I think plant cells have a cell wall made of cellulose, right? And I don't think animal cells have that. So looking at the options, any that say animal cells have a rigid cellulose wall would be wrong. Let me check the options.

Option B says animal cells have a rigid cellulose wall. That's incorrect because that's a plant cell feature. Option J says both have it, which is also wrong.

Next, I remember that plant cells have large vacuoles, especially a central vacuole which helps with storage and structure. Animal cells have smaller vacuoles. So looking at the options, option A says animal cells have larger vacuoles. That's the opposite, so A is incorrect. Option G says animal cells have a central vacuole, which isn't right because it's the plant cells that have that.

Chloroplasts are another point. Plant cells have chloroplasts for photosynthesis, while animal cells don't. So option C claims animal cells have chloroplasts, which is wrong. Option E says animal cells can do photosynthesis and plant cells can't, which is opposite of the truth. So E is wrong.

Mitochondria... I think both have mitochondria, but the number varies. Wait, no, both have multiple small mitochondria. Wait, no, I think both have multiple, but maybe the number isn't the main difference. Option F says plant cells have a single large mitochondrion, which doesn't sound right. I think both have many, so F is incorrect.

Cell size... I'm not sure if plant cells are typically smaller. I think generally animal cells can vary more, but I don't remember a strict size difference as a key point. Option D says plant cells are smaller, but I'm not certain.

Centrioles... Plant cells usually don't have them, or they have fewer. Animal cells have centrioles which are involved in spindle formation during cell division. Option H says plant cells have centrioles and animals don't, which is wrong. So H is incorrect.

Cell division process... Yes, plant cells undergo a different type of cell division. They form a cell plate during cytokinesis, whereas animal cells have the cleavage furrow. So the plant cells have a different process.

Putting this together, the correct answer should mention the plant cell wall, the presence of chloroplasts, the central vacuole (wait, no, the presence of a large central vacuole is a plant cell feature), and the different cell division.

Looking at the options, option I says: Plant cells have a rigid cellulose wall, large central fluid sap (maybe referring to the vacuole), contain chloroplasts, and undergo a different process of cell division. That sounds right.

So I think the correct answer is I.

The chief differences between plant and animal cells include the presence of a rigid cellulose cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole in plant cells. Additionally, plant cells undergo a different process of cell division compared to animal cells, forming a cell plate during cytokinesis. These features are accurately described in option I.

Answer: I
