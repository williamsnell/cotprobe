Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem is about calculating the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq). The given reaction is a half-cell reaction: AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq). I'm also given the standard electrode potential E° as +0.222 V. The μ° for AgCl(s) is -109.71 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Hmm, I remember that for electrochemical cells, the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) is related to the cell potential (E°) by the equation ΔG° = -nFE°, where F is the Faraday constant. But wait, in this case, it's a half-cell reaction, so I need to think about how that applies here.

The reaction given is a reduction because it's gaining an electron. So, in the context of the standard hydrogen electrode, this is a cathode reaction. But I'm not sure if that matters right now. Let's focus on the Gibbs energy.

I think the first step is to figure out the standard Gibbs energy change (ΔG°) for this reaction. Once I have that, I can relate it to the standard Gibbs energies of formation of the substances involved.

The reaction is:

AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq)

The ΔG° for this reaction is the sum of the products' Gibbs energies minus the reactants. So,

ΔG°_rxn = [G°(Ag(s)) + G°(Cl⁻(aq))] - [G°(AgCl(s)) + G°(e⁻)]

Wait, electrons in reactions. Hmm, the Gibbs energy of an electron is usually taken as zero under standard conditions. So G°(e⁻) is zero. So the equation simplifies to:

ΔG°_rxn = [G°(Ag) + G°(Cl⁻)] - G°(AgCl)

But I'm looking for the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻, which is ΔGf°(Cl⁻). The standard Gibbs energy of formation is defined as the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

So for AgCl(s), the formation reaction is:
Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s)
And the ΔGf° for AgCl(s) is given as μ°(AgCl,s) = -109.71 kJ/mol⁻¹. Wait, but wait, I think μ° here is the standard chemical potential, which for a reaction is the same as ΔG°_f. So yes, the ΔGf° for AgCl is -109.71 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But in our reaction, AgCl is a reactant, breaking down into Ag and Cl⁻. So the ΔG°_rxn for our reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction of AgCl. 

Wait, the formation reaction of AgCl is Ag(s) + ½Cl₂(g) → AgCl(s), right? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think again.

The reaction given is the decomposition of AgCl into Ag and Cl⁻. So the ΔG° for this reaction would be the negative of the ΔGf° of AgCl, because the formation is the reverse. So:

ΔG°_rxn = - (ΔGf°(AgCl)) 

But wait, wait. Let me clarify. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements. So for AgCl(s), it's formed from Ag(s) and Cl⁻(aq) (assuming Cl comes from HCl in solution). Wait, no, actually, the standard formation reaction for AgCl would involve Cl₂ gas. Because Cl⁻ in solution isn't an element in its standard form. Oh, right, because Cl⁻ in solution isn't in its elemental form. The standard state for Cl is Cl₂(g), so the formation reaction is:

Ag(s) + ½ Cl₂(g) → AgCl(s) 

So the ΔGf° for AgCl(s) is -109.71 kJ/mol⁻¹. Which means the reverse reaction, AgCl(s) → Ag(s) + ½ Cl₂(g), has ΔG° = +109.71 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But our reaction is AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq). So it's not just decomposing into Ag and Cl₂; the Cl⁻ is in solution, and an electron is involved.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the relation between ΔG° and cell potential. Since this is a half-reaction, E° is given, and I can calculate ΔG° for the reaction.

The formula is ΔG° = -n F E°, where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred. In this reaction, one electron is gained (since it's a reduction), so n=1.

F is Faraday's constant, approximately 96485 C/mol⁻¹. But wait, the units for E° are in volts, and F is in C/mol⁻¹, so when we multiply, the units would be (C·V)/mol, which is J/mol. Since 1 kJ is 1000 J, I'll need to convert appropriately.

So, E° is 0.222 V. So:

ΔG° = -n F E° 

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔG° = - (1 mol) * 96485 C/mol * 0.222 V 

Since 1 V = 1 J/C, so the units should work out.

Calculating that:

First, 96485 * 0.222 = Let's compute:

0.222 * 96485 ≈ Let's see. 0.2 *96485=19,297. 0.022*96485≈ 2,123.7. So total is approx 19,297 + 2,123.7 = 21,420.7 J/mol, which is 21.4207 kJ/mol.

But since ΔG° is -n F E°, and n is 1, so ΔG° = -21,420.7 J/mol → -21.42 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait: so the ΔG° for this reaction is -21.42 kJ/mol.

But wait, what is the reaction? It's AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq). So the ΔG°_rxn is -21.42 kJ/mol.

Now, how does this relate to the Gibbs free energy of formation of Cl⁻?

I need to find ΔGf°(Cl⁻, aq). The standard Gibbs free energy of formation is the change when 1 mole of Cl⁻ is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for Cl⁻, the formation reaction would be:

½ Cl₂(g) → Cl⁻(aq)

But wait, the standard state of Cl is Cl₂(g), so the formation reaction of Cl⁻ would be from Cl₂.

So, the ΔGf°(Cl⁻) is the Gibbs energy change for this reaction.

Now, let's relate this to the given reaction. Let's write the given reaction again:

AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq)          ΔG°_rxn = -21.42 kJ/mol

But I also know the ΔGf° values of AgCl(s), Ag(s), and Cl⁻(aq). Wait, but the ΔGf° of Ag(s) is zero, because it's in its standard state. Similarly, the ΔGf° of AgCl(s) is given as -109.71 kJ/mol⁻¹.

So, using the equation:

ΔG°_rxn = [ΔGf°(Ag) + ΔGf°(Cl⁻)] - [ΔGf°(AgCl) + ΔGf°(e⁻)]

Again, ΔGf°(e⁻) is zero, and ΔGf°(Ag) is zero. So:

ΔG°_rxn = [0 + ΔGf°(Cl⁻)] - [(-109.71) + 0]

So:

ΔG°_rxn = ΔGf°(Cl⁻) + 109.71 kJ/mol

But we found that ΔG°_rxn is -21.42 kJ/mol. So:

-21.42 = ΔGf°(Cl⁻) + 109.71

Solving for ΔGf°(Cl⁻):

ΔGf°(Cl⁻) = -21.42 - 109.71 = -131.13 kJ/mol

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers. Because 21.42 plus 109.71 is about 131.13, so with the negative, it's -131.13.

Looking at the options:

Option C is -131.1 kJ/mol⁻¹. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, I had ΔG°_rxn = -nFE°. Let me recheck those calculations.

n is 1, E° is 0.222 V.

So F is 96485 C/mol.

So 96485 * 0.222 = let's compute more accurately.

0.2 * 96485 = 19297.

0.022 * 96485 = 2126.97.

Adding together: 19297 + 2126.97 = 21423.97 J/mol, which is 21.424 kJ/mol.

So ΔG°_rxn = -21.424 kJ/mol.

Then, ΔG°_rxn = [0 + ΔGf°(Cl⁻)] - [ΔGf°(AgCl)].

So:

-21.424 = ΔGf°(Cl⁻) - (-109.71)

→ -21.424 = ΔGf°(Cl⁻) + 109.71

→ ΔGf°(Cl⁻) = -21.424 -109.71 = -131.134 kJ/mol.

Yes, so approximately -131.1, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options, and option C is -131.1. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the standard Gibbs energy of formation of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(aq)$, we start with the given half-cell reaction:

$$\operatorname{AgCl}(s) + \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \operatorname{Ag}(s) + \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(aq)$$

The standard Gibbs energy change for this reaction, $\Delta G^\circ_{\text{rxn}}$, can be calculated using the relation between Gibbs free energy and cell potential:

$$\Delta G^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = -n F E^\circ$$

Here:
- $n = 1$ (number of electrons transferred),
- $F = 96485 \, \mathrm{C/mol}$ (Faraday's constant),
- $E^\circ = +0.222 \, \mathrm{V}$ (standard electrode potential).

Substituting the values:

$$\Delta G^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = -(1)(96485)(0.222) = -21423.97 \, \mathrm{J/mol} = -21.42 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.$$

Next, we relate $\Delta G^\circ_{\text{rxn}}$ to the standard Gibbs energies of formation of the reactants and products. The reaction can be expressed as:

$$\Delta G^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \left[\Delta G_f^\circ(\operatorname{Ag}) + \Delta G_f^\circ(\mathrm{Cl}^{-})\right] - \left[\Delta G_f^\circ(\operatorname{AgCl}) + \Delta G_f^\circ(\mathrm{e}^{-})\right].$$

Since $\Delta G_f^\circ(\operatorname{Ag}) = 0$ (element in its standard state) and $\Delta G_f^\circ(\mathrm{e}^{-}) = 0$, the equation simplifies to:

$$\Delta G^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \Delta G_f^\circ(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}) - \Delta G_f^\circ(\operatorname{AgCl}).$$

The standard Gibbs energy of formation of $\operatorname{AgCl}(s)$ is given as $\Delta G_f^\circ(\operatorname{AgCl}) = -109.71 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$. Substituting this and $\Delta G^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = -21.42 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$:

$$-21.42 = \Delta G_f^\circ(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}) - (-109.71).$$

Rearranging:

$$\Delta G_f^\circ(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}) = -21.42 - 109.71 = -131.13 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.$$

Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is:

**C: -131.1 $\mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$**

Thus, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(aq)$ is **-131.1 kJ/mol**.

Answer: C
