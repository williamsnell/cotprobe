Question:

A rock drops onto a pond with a smooth surface. A few moments later, the wave produced by the rock’s impact arrives at the shore, touching the ankles of a wading child. Which of the following observations provides evidence that the portion of the wave hitting the child’s ankles carries less energy than the wave did when it was first created by the rock’s impact?

Options:

A: The wave has become more turbulent.
B: The wave has split into multiple smaller waves.
C: The wave pulse’s width has become greater.
D: The wave's height has become greater.
E: The wave is moving more slowly.
F: The wave pulse’s width has become smaller.
G: The wave's speed has increased.
H: The wave’s height has become smaller.
I: The temperature of the water has changed.
J: The wave's color has changed.

Okay, so I've got this physics question here about waves and energy. Hmm, let me try to think through this. The question is about a rock dropping into a pond and creating a wave that eventually reaches the shore where a child is wading. The key point is that the wave's energy when it hits the child is less than when it was first created. I need to figure out which observation supports that.

Wait, I remember that the energy of a wave is related to its amplitude. The higher the amplitude, the more energy it carries. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the energy in a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude. So if the wave's height (which is its amplitude) decreases, its energy would decrease as well.

So the question is asking which observation shows that the wave has less energy when it reaches the child. So looking at the options, I need to find something that indicates the wave's amplitude is smaller.

Let me look at the options. Option H says the wave's height has become smaller. That makes sense because if the height is smaller, the energy is less. Another option is E, which says the wave is moving more slowly. But wait, in water, wave speed depends on the medium and the wavelength, but as the wave travels, especially in shallow water, the speed might change. Wait, actually, when a wave approaches the shore, it's moving into shallower water. I think in shallow water, the speed decreases. But does that relate to energy?

Wait, the energy of a wave is also related to its speed because energy transfer depends on both speed and amplitude. But I'm not sure if the speed alone indicates energy. Because if the wave is slowing down, but maybe the amplitude is staying the same, the energy might change. Alternatively, if the amplitude is lower, that's a direct indication of lower energy.

So the question is about the portion of the wave that hits the child. So if the wave's height has decreased, that part of the wave has less energy. That would be option H.

Let me check the other options. Option A: More turbulent. Turbulence might relate to how the wave is breaking, but not directly to energy. Option B: Split into smaller waves. Not sure, maybe that's about diffraction or reflection, but not directly about energy carried by each part. Option C: Pulse width greater. Hmm, the width being greater—I think that relates to the length of the wave train. Maybe if it's spread out, the energy is more dispersed, but I'm not sure. Option E: Moving more slowly. As I thought earlier, speed is related, but not as direct as amplitude. Option F: Pulse width smaller. That would be the opposite of C, not sure. Option G: Speed increased? Probably not, since waves usually slow down in shallow water. Option I: Temperature change. Unrelated. J: Color change. Also unrelated.

So the best option is H: the wave's height has become smaller. Because lower amplitude means less energy.

The energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude (height). When a wave travels across a pond and reaches the shore, its height decreases, indicating a reduction in energy. Among the given options, the observation that the wave's height has become smaller directly supports the conclusion that the portion of the wave hitting the child carries less energy than when it was first created.
