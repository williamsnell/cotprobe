Okay, so I have this question about ophthalmic prescriptions and the difference between glasses and contact lenses. Hmm, I remember that the position of the lens affects the required refractive power. Glasses are worn in front of the cornea, while contact lenses are placed directly on the eye. Wait, so the distance between the lens and the cornea must matter here.

The prescription for glasses is -4.50 m^-1. Oh wait, that's the refractive power, right. Glasses are typically positioned 14mm in front of the cornea. But contact lenses are much closer, almost touching the eye. So the vertex distance is less for contacts.

I think the formula involves the vertex distance. Oh right, the formula is 1/f' = 1/f + delta, where delta is related to the change in vertex distance. Or wait, maybe it's using the lens equation considering the vertex distance.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me think. The formula I remember is that when the vertex distance changes, the required power changes. The formula is: 

new power (F') = old power (F) + (F * delta) / (1 + delta * F)

Wait, no, maybe it's better to use the formula that relates the two. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the power needed for contact lenses (F') can be calculated using F' = F / (1 - d*F), where d is the vertex distance difference.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline what I know.

The vertex distance for glasses is 14 mm, which is 0.014 meters. Contact lenses are placed much closer, like almost zero distance. So the vertex distance for contacts is about 0 mm. So the difference in vertex distance is d = 0.014 m (since we're moving the lens 14mm closer to the cornea).

Wait, no, the vertex distance for contacts isn't exactly zero. I think it's around 0.5 mm to 1 mm. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can approximate it as zero, so the difference is 14mm.

So the formula used to adjust the power is:

1/F' = 1/F + delta

Wait, no. The correct approach, I think, is that the power for the contact lens (F') is related to the spectacle power (F) by the formula:

F' = F / (1 + (F * d))

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The formula I'm trying to recall is probably:

F' = F + (F * delta) / (1 - delta * F)

No, perhaps a better approach is to use the lens formula considering the vertex distance. The vertex distance (s) affects the power required. The formula used to calculate the equivalent power when the vertex distance changes is:

1/F' = 1/F + s, where s is the vertex distance in meters.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, because when the vertex distance is s, the actual position of the image changes relative to the eye.

Wait, here's the correct approach. The formula to adjust the power when changing the vertex distance is:

1/F' = 1/F + (d) 

where d is the change in vertex distance (in meters) when moving from the original position (glasses) to the new position (contact lenses). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the exact formula.

Alternatively, the formula might be derived from the lens equation considering the change in the position. The formula I remember is F' = F / (1 + (F * d)), where d is the vertex distance in meters. Wait, that doesn't seem correct dimensionally because F is in m^-1, d in m, so F*d would be dimensionless. So F' would be in m^-1, same as F.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

F' = F + (F * d) / (1 + d * F)

Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. Alternatively, I've heard about the "vertex formula" which is:

F' = F / (1 - (F * d))

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

The power of the lens is inversely proportional to the focal length. The focal length changes when the lens is moved closer to the eye. So if the original lens is at a vertex distance of 14mm (0.014 m), but the contact lens is at a much smaller distance (let's say ~0.5 mm, but perhaps for this problem, it's considered 0 mm).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

F' = F / (1 - F * delta)

But wait, the units again. Let me think of F as the spectacle lens power, and F' as the contact lens power. The vertex distance for spectacles is 14mm, and for contacts, let's approximate it as 0. So the change in vertex distance is 14mm = 0.014 m.

Wait, no, delta would be the difference in vertex distances. So if the original vertex distance is 14mm, and the new is 0, then delta is 14mm = 0.014 m.

Wait, but if the contact lens is placed at the cornea, the vertex distance is zero. So the delta is 14mm. But how does that affect the power?

I think the formula for the new power is F' = F / (1 - F * delta). Let me plug in the numbers. F is -4.50 m^-1, delta is 0.014 m.

So F' = (-4.50) / (1 - (-4.50) * 0.014 )

Calculate the denominator:

1 - (-4.50 * 0.014) = 1 + (4.5 * 0.014 )

4.5 * 0.014 = 0.063.

So denominator is 1.063.

So F' = (-4.50) / 1.063 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 4.5 divided by 1.063.

Well, 1.063 times 4 is 4.252. 4.5 is 0.248 more than 4.252. 0.248 / 1.063 ≈ 0.233 of 1. So 4.5 / 1.063 ≈ 4.233.

But since F was -4.5, F' is approximately -4.233 m^-1.

Looking at the options, option A is -4.23 m^-1. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have mixed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Another approach: The formula for the relationship between spectacle lens power F and contact lens power F' when the vertex distance s is changed is given by:

1/F' = 1/F + s

Wait, no, because that would mean if s is positive (moving the lens away), the power would decrease, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

F' = F + s, but that also seems too simplistic and doesn't account for the product of F and s.

Wait, another source I recall says that the correct formula is F' = F / (1 + F * d), where d is the change in vertex distance.

Wait, let's try that. F is -4.50, d is +0.014 m (since the contact lens is 14mm closer, so the vertex distance decreases by 14mm, so d is negative? Wait, no, perhaps d is the difference in vertex distances. So when moving from 14mm to 0mm, the change is -14mm, which is -0.014 m.

Wait, perhaps I should model it correctly. Let me think: the vertex distance for the glasses is 14mm, which is s1 = 0.014 m. The vertex distance for contacts is s2 = 0. So delta s is s2 - s1 = -0.014 m.

The formula I've come across is F' = F + (F * delta_s) / (1 + F * s1 )

Wait, that might be more accurate. Let me plug in the numbers.

F is -4.50 m^-1, delta_s is -0.014 m, s1 is 0.014 m.

So F' = (-4.50) + [ (-4.50)*(-0.014) ] / (1 + (-4.50)*(0.014) )

Compute numerator of the fraction: (-4.5)*(-0.014) = 0.063.

Denominator: 1 + (-4.5 * 0.014) = 1 - 0.063 = 0.937.

So the fraction is 0.063 / 0.937 ≈ 0.06726.

So F' = (-4.50) + 0.06726 ≈ -4.4327 m^-1.

Wait, that's approximately -4.43, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is F' = F / (1 + F * d), where d is the change in vertex distance.

Wait, let's try that. d is the change from glasses to contacts. So d is s2 - s1 = 0 - 0.014 = -0.014 m.

So F' = (-4.50) / (1 + (-4.50)*(-0.014) )

Compute denominator: 1 + (4.5 * 0.014) = 1 + 0.063 = 1.063.

So F' = (-4.50) / 1.063 ≈ -4.233 m^-1, which is approximately -4.23, matching option A.

So I think the correct approach is to use F' = F / (1 + F * d), where d is the change in vertex distance (which is negative 0.014 m here because the lens is moved closer by 14 mm).

Wait, but wait: when you move the lens closer to the eye, s decreases, so delta s is negative. But in the formula, d is the new s minus old s. So if the old s was 0.014 m, and the new s is zero, d = -0.014 m.

So substituting into F' = F / (1 + F * d )

F is -4.50, d is -0.014.

So denominator: 1 + (-4.50) * (-0.014) = 1 + 0.063 = 1.063.

So F' = (-4.50) / 1.063 ≈ -4.233, which is option A.

But wait, I've heard that contact lenses have a lower power than glasses for myopes because they're closer to the eye. Wait, in this case, the patient's prescription is -4.50, which is myopic (nearsighted). So for a myope, contact lenses have a lower (less negative) power than glasses because the lens is closer to the eye.

Wait, wait, that's conflicting with what I just calculated. Because if the glasses are -4.50, the contact lens would be less negative, meaning a smaller magnitude. But according to my calculation, F' is -4.23, which is less negative than -4.50, which makes sense. So that seems correct.

So the correct answer should be A: -4.23 m^-1.

To determine the correct prescription for contact lenses when the patient originally has a prescription of -4.50 m⁻¹ for glasses worn 14 mm in front of the cornea, we need to account for the change in vertex distance. Glasses are typically positioned 14 mm (0.014 m) in front of the cornea, while contact lenses are placed much closer, effectively at a vertex distance of approximately 0 mm.

The formula to calculate the new refractive power for contact lenses is:

\[
F' = \frac{F}{1 + F \cdot d}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the original refractive power of the glasses (-4.50 m⁻¹),
- \( d \) is the change in vertex distance, which is \( 0 - 0.014 = -0.014 \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
F' = \frac{-4.50}{1 + (-4.50) \cdot (-0.014)}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
1 + (-4.50) \cdot (-0.014) = 1 + 0.063 = 1.063
\]

Now, calculate \( F' \):

\[
F' = \frac{-4.50}{1.063} \approx -4.233 \, \text{m}^{-1}
\]

Thus, the new prescription for the contact lenses is approximately -4.23 m⁻¹. This makes sense because, for myopic (nearsighted) patients, the refractive power of contact lenses is slightly less negative than that of glasses due to the reduced vertex distance.

From the given options, the closest match is:

**A: -4.23 m⁻¹**
