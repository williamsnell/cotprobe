Okay, so I have this physics problem about calculating the work done to lift coal up a mine shaft. Hmm, let's see. I remember that work is related to force and distance, but wait, when the force varies, it's not just a simple multiplication. Oh right, that's when you use integrals and Riemann sums.

The problem says the cable weighs 2 lb per foot. So the weight per unit length is 2 lb/ft. The coal itself is 800 lb, and the mine shaft is 500 feet deep. Wait, so the cable's weight is distributed along its length, which is being lifted as well. So the total work would be the sum of the work done to lift the coal and the work done to lift the cable, but wait, no, I think the problem is only about lifting the coal, but the cable's weight contributes to the force because as you lift the coal, you're also lifting the cable. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, I get confused. Let me read again.

The cable is used to lift the 800 lb of coal. So the coal is at the bottom, and as you lift it up, you're also lifting the cable. So the total weight being lifted at any point is the weight of the coal plus the weight of the cable that's already been lifted.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think: when you lift the coal up, the length of the cable that's out of the shaft decreases as you lift. Oh wait, no, if the shaft is 500 ft deep, and you're lifting the coal up from the bottom to the top, then initially, the entire cable is in the shaft, and as you lift, you're pulling the cable up, so the length of cable remaining in the shaft decreases as you lift. So the weight of the cable being lifted at any point depends on how much is left in the shaft.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it. Let's say that at a certain point, you've lifted the coal up by x feet, so x ranges from 0 to 500 ft. At that point, the length of the cable still in the shaft is (500 - x) feet. So the weight of the cable still to be lifted is 2 lb/ft * (500 - x) ft. So the total force you're exerting at that point is the weight of the coal (800 lb) plus the weight of the remaining cable, which is 2*(500 -x) lb. So the force F(x) = 800 + 2*(500 - x).

Wait, no, wait a second. Is the cable's weight being lifted as part of the work? Because the cable is attached to the coal. So as you lift the coal, you're lifting the entire cable along with it. But maybe another approach is that the cable's weight adds to the force needed to lift. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the force as a function of x, where x is the distance the coal has been lifted.

Wait, another approach: when the coal is at position x (from the bottom), the length of cable that needs to be supported is (500 - x) feet, because you've already lifted x feet, so the remaining in the shaft is (500 - x) feet. So the weight of the cable at that point is 2*(500 - x) lb. So the total force you're lifting is the weight of the coal plus the weight of the remaining cable, which is F(x) = 800 + 2*(500 - x).

Wait, but wait, when x is 0 (at the bottom), the cable's entire length is in the shaft, so the weight would be 2*500 = 1000 lb. So F(0) = 800 + 1000 = 1800 lb. When x is 500 (at the top), the remaining cable is 0, so F(500) = 800 + 0 = 800 lb. That makes sense because as you lift the coal, the cable's weight that you're lifting decreases.

Now, the work done is the integral of F(x) dx from x=0 to x=500. So W = ∫ F(x) dx from 0 to 500.

So F(x) = 800 + 2*(500 - x) = 800 + 1000 - 2x = 1800 - 2x.

Therefore, W = ∫ (1800 - 2x) dx from 0 to 500.

Let me compute this integral:

The integral of 1800 dx is 1800x.

The integral of -2x dx is -x².

So evaluating from 0 to 500:

At 500: 1800*(500) - (500)^2.

1800 * 500 is 900,000.

500 squared is 250,000.

So 900,000 - 250,000 = 650,000 ft-lb.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because when I lift the coal, the force is due to both the coal and the cable. Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, the work done to lift the cable itself is considered, but in this case, the problem states that the cable weighs 2 lb/ft, so perhaps I should calculate the work done on both the coal and the cable.

Wait, but the problem says "Find the work done." It doesn't specify whether it's just the work to lift the coal or the total work including the cable. Hmm, but the way I modeled it, F(x) includes both the coal and the cable's weight. So that should be correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes in these problems, the work done is just to lift the coal against the cable's tension, which varies. Alternatively, perhaps the work done is the integral of the tension in the cable times dx. The tension in the cable at point x would be the weight of the coal plus the weight of the cable below that point, which is 800 + 2*(500 - x), as I thought earlier.

So the integral of that from 0 to 500 gives 650,000 ft-lb, which is option F.

Looking back at the options, option F is 650,000 ft-lb.

But wait, let me think again: sometimes when you model the problem, the work done lifting the cable itself is also part of the total work. But in this problem, the cable is attached to the coal, so as the coal is lifted, the entire cable is also being lifted. So the work done would include lifting the coal and the entire cable.

Wait, wait, no. The cable is uniform along its length, so as the coal is lifted, each infinitesimal segment of the cable is being lifted a distance x, but perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, the problem could be approached by calculating the work done to lift the coal (which is at a constant weight, 800 lb) and the work done to lift the cable.

The work to lift the coal is straightforward: W_coal = 800 lb * 500 ft = 400,000 ft-lb.

Now, for the cable: the cable is 500 ft long, with a weight per foot of 2 lb. The total weight of the cable is 2 * 500 = 1000 lb. But when lifting the cable, each infinitesimal segment of the cable at position x (from the bottom) needs to be lifted a distance of x feet. So the work done to lift the entire cable would be the integral from 0 to 500 of (2 dx) * x, because each slice of cable at position x has weight 2 dx lb and is lifted x feet.

So W_cable = ∫ (2x) dx from 0 to 500.

Integral of 2x is x². Evaluated from 0 to 500: 500² = 250,000 ft-lb.

So total work W_total = W_coal + W_cable = 400,000 + 250,000 = 650,000 ft-lb.

So that's the same answer as before, which is option F.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be F: 650,000 ft-lb.

To calculate the work done to lift the 800 lb of coal up a 500 ft mine shaft using a cable that weighs 2 lb/ft, we need to account for both the work done to lift the coal and the work done to lift the cable itself.

### Step 1: Work to Lift the Coal
The coal has a constant weight of 800 lb, and it is lifted a total distance of 500 ft. The work done to lift the coal is:

\[
W_{\text{coal}} = \text{force} \times \text{distance} = 800 \, \text{lb} \times 500 \, \text{ft} = 400,000 \, \text{ft-lb}.
\]

### Step 2: Work to Lift the Cable
The cable weighs 2 lb/ft, and its total length is 500 ft. As the coal is lifted, each infinitesimal segment of the cable at position \(x\) (from the bottom) is lifted a distance \(x\). The weight of a small segment of the cable is \(2 \, dx\), and the work done to lift this segment is \((2 \, dx) \times x\). The total work to lift the entire cable is:

\[
W_{\text{cable}} = \int_0^{500} 2x \, dx.
\]

The integral of \(2x\) is \(x^2\), so:

\[
W_{\text{cable}} = \left[ x^2 \right]_0^{500} = 500^2 - 0^2 = 250,000 \, \text{ft-lb}.
\]

### Step 3: Total Work
The total work done is the sum of the work to lift the coal and the work to lift the cable:

\[
W_{\text{total}} = W_{\text{coal}} + W_{\text{cable}} = 400,000 + 250,000 = 650,000 \, \text{ft-lb}.
\]

### Final Answer
The total work done is **650,000 ft-lb**, which corresponds to option **F**.
