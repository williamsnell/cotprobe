Okay, so I have this problem about heat transfer, specifically forced convection around a pipe. Hmm, I remember that when a fluid flows over an object, like a pipe, heat is transferred between the fluid and the surface. The question gives me some parameters, and I need to calculate the heat transfer rate per unit length of the pipe. 

Let me see, the pipe has a diameter of 4 inches. Oh wait, I should probably convert that into feet because the other measurements are in feet and the answer is in Btu per hour per foot. So 4 inches divided by 12 is 1/3 of a foot, so D = 1/3 ft.

The surface temperature of the pipe is 90°F, and the air has a bulk temperature of 75°F. So the temperature difference, ΔT, is 90 -75 =15°F. 

The air is flowing at 15 ft/s. I think I need to calculate the convection heat transfer coefficient (h) first. Once I have h, I can use the formula for heat transfer rate q = h * A * ΔT, but since it's per unit length, the area A would be the circumference times length. But let me think step by step.

Wait, the formula for forced convection around a cylinder (since the pipe is cylindrical) uses the Nusselt number (Nu) which relates to the Reynolds number (Re) and Prandtl number (Pr). The general approach is to find Nu = (h D)/k, where k is thermal conductivity of air. Then we can find h.

So first, I need the Reynolds number Re = (V D)/ν, where ν is the kinematic viscosity of air. I remember that at around room temperature, the kinematic viscosity of air is about 0.00016 ft²/s. Wait, let me think: at 75°F (which is roughly 24°C), the viscosity might be a bit different, but maybe the problem expects me to use standard values. For simplicity, perhaps ν is taken as 0.000016 ft²/s? Wait, no, that's 1.6e-5. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, kinematic viscosity ν is in ft²/s. For air at around 20°C (which is close to 75°F?), ν is about 0.00016 ft²/s, which is 1.6e-4 ft²/s. So I'll use ν = 1.6e-4 ft²/s.

So Re = (V D) / ν. V is 15 ft/s, D is 1/3 ft. So Re = (15 * (1/3)) / (1.6e-4) = (5) / 0.00016. Let me compute that: 5 / 0.00016 = 5 / 1.6e-4. So 5 * 1e4 /1.6 = 50000 / 1.6 ≈ 31250. So Re is about 31,250. That's in the turbulent flow regime, which is Re > 2300 for flow around cylinders.

Wait, for a cylinder, the flow is usually considered laminar if Re is below about 4000, and turbulent above. So at Re ~31k, it's definitely turbulent. 

Now, for forced convection around a cylinder in the turbulent regime, I think the Nusselt number is given by the Churchill-Bernstein correlation. The formula I remember for Nu is:

Nu = 0.3 + (0.62 * Re^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3)) ) / [1 + (0.4/Pr)^(2/3) ] * [1 + (Re/282000)^0.5/10]^(1/4)

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, another correlation for higher Re in turbulent flow is: Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.4.

Wait, I think for Re between 10^4 and 1e6, the standard correlation is Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.4. So maybe that's the one to use here.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've seen different correlations. Let me think: for a circular cylinder in crossflow, the Nusselt number can be approximated using the equation:

Nu = 0.27 Re^0.63 Pr^0.36  for 10 < Re < 2500 (laminar)

And for higher Re, maybe Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.4.

Wait, wait, another thought: maybe the problem expects me to use the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is more general for forced convection in tubes, but I'm not sure if it applies here. The Dittus-Boelter equation is Nu = 0.023 Re^n Pr^0.4, where n is 0.8 for turbulent flow.

Alternatively, perhaps for a cylinder, the correlation is different. Let me think. For a cylinder, when Re is around 1e4 to 1e5, the correlation I remember is Nu = 0.26 Re^0.6 Pr^0.37.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard correlations, but since I'm trying to simulate a student's thinking, I'll proceed with what I can recall.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a simplified approach. Let me consider that perhaps the problem uses a specific correlation, so I'll go with the most commonly used one for turbulent flow around a cylinder, which is:

Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.4.

So, let me proceed with that.

But wait, I also need the Prandtl number for air. Pr for air at around room temperature is approximately 0.7. Let me confirm: yes, at 20°C, Pr is about 0.7. So I'll take Pr = 0.7.

So now, Re is 31250, Pr is 0.7.

Calculating Nu:

Nu = 0.023 * (31250)^0.8 * (0.7)^0.4.

Hmm, calculating exponents can be a bit tricky. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, (31250)^0.8.

Compute ln(31250) = ln(3.125e4) = ln(3.125) + ln(1e4) ≈ 1.144 + 9.2103 ≈ 10.354.

Multiply by 0.8: 10.354 * 0.8 = 8.283.

Exponentiate: e^8.283 ≈ e^8 is about 2980, e^0.283 ≈ e^0.28 is about 1.323. So 2980 * 1.323 ≈ 2980 * 1.3 ≈ 3874, but more accurately: 2980 *1.323 is approximately 2980 + 2980*(0.323)= 2980 + ~962 ≈ 3942.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute 31250^0.8.

31250 = 3.125e4.

3.125^0.8: Let's compute that. 3^0.8 is about e^(0.8 ln3) ≈ e^(0.8*1.0986) = e^0.879 ≈ 2.408. 3.125 is a bit more than 3, so maybe around 2.44.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use logarithms.

Compute log10(31250) = 4.4949 (since 10^4.4949 ≈ 31250).

So log10(31250^0.8) = 0.8 *4.4949 ≈ 3.5959.

So 10^3.5959 ≈ 10^0.5959 * 1e3.

10^0.5959: 10^0.6 is about 3.98, so approximately 3.98e3 → 3980.

So 31250^0.8 ≈ 3980.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was around 3942. Close enough. Let's say approximately 4000.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise. Let's compute 31250^0.8.

I know that 31250 = 10000 * 3.125.

So 31250^0.8 = (1e4)^0.8 * (3.125)^0.8.

(1e4)^0.8 = (10^4)^0.8 = 10^(3.2) = 10^3 * 10^0.2 ≈ 1000 * 1.5849 ≈ 1584.9.

Now, 3.125^0.8: Let me compute this.

3.125 is 25/8, but perhaps taking natural logs.

ln(3.125) ≈ 1.1442228.

So 0.8 * ln(3.125) ≈ 0.915378.

e^0.915378 ≈ 2.498, since e^0.9 ≈ 2.4596, and e^0.915 ≈ about 2.498.

So 3.125^0.8 ≈ 2.498.

So 31250^0.8 ≈ 1584.9 * 2.498 ≈ 1584.9 * 2.5 = 3961.25, but since 2.498 is slightly less than 2.5, maybe around 3960.

So approximately 3960.

Now, (0.7)^0.4.

Compute ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

Multiply by 0.4: -0.35667 * 0.4 ≈ -0.1427.

e^(-0.1427) ≈ 1 - 0.1427 + (0.1427^2)/2 - ... approximately. Alternatively, I know that e^-0.14 ≈ 0.8694, and e^-0.1427 ≈ about 0.867.

So 0.7^0.4 ≈ 0.867.

Now, putting it all together:

Nu = 0.023 * 3960 * 0.867.

Compute 0.023 * 3960 first.

0.023 * 3960 = (0.02 * 3960) + (0.003 * 3960) = 79.2 + 11.88 = 91.08.

Then multiply by 0.867: 91.08 * 0.867.

Compute 91 * 0.867: let's see, 90*0.867=78.03, plus 1*0.867=78.03 +0.867=78.897.

And 0.08 *0.867=0.06936. So total is approximately 78.897 + 0.06936 ≈ 78.966.

So Nu ≈ 78.966.

Now, Nu is h*D/k, so h = Nu *k / D.

Wait, I need the thermal conductivity of air. At room temperature, k for air is approximately 0.015 Btu/(hr-ft-°F). Wait, let me confirm: yes, thermal conductivity of air is around 0.015 in those units.

Wait, let me check: the thermal conductivity of air at 20°C is about 0.025 W/m·K. But wait, in Btu units, 1 W/m·K is approximately 0.5778 Btu/(hr-ft-°F). So 0.025 W/m·K * 0.5778 ≈ 0.01445 Btu/(hr-ft-°F), which is about 0.0145. So I think the value is about 0.0145 Btu/(hr-ft-°F). But sometimes, in some references, it's taken as 0.015 for simplicity.

Wait, but in the problem, perhaps it's given as 0.015. Let me proceed with k=0.015 Btu/(hr-ft-°F).

So h = (Nu * k) / D.

Wait, D is in feet, which is 1/3 ft.

So h = (78.966 * 0.015) / (1/3) = ?

Compute numerator: 78.966 * 0.015 = approx 1.18449.

Then divide by (1/3), which is multiplying by 3: 1.18449 *3 ≈ 3.55347 Btu/(hr-ft²-°F).

So h ≈ 3.55 Btu/(hr-ft²-°F).

Wait, that seems a bit low. Hmm. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of Nu. Let me go back.

Wait, Re was 31250, and I used the correlation Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.4. Plugging in Re^0.8 as 3960, Pr^0.4 as 0.867.

So 0.023 * 3960 = 91.08, and 91.08 * 0.867 ≈ 78.96.

So Nu ≈ 79.

Then, h = (79) * (0.015) / (1/3) = ?

Wait, 0.015 multiplied by 79 is 1.185. Then, divided by (1/3) is 1.185 *3 = 3.555. So h≈3.555 Btu/(hr-ft²-°F).

Wait, but wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake in the units for k. Because in the formula Nu = h D / k, the units of k would be in Btu/(hr-ft-°F), and D is in feet.

So the calculation seems correct, but perhaps I should double-check the thermal conductivity value.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a more accurate value for k. Let me think: maybe the problem expects me to use k=0.015 Btu/(hr-ft-°F). So proceeding with that.

Now, having h, I can compute the heat transfer rate per unit length. The formula for heat transfer rate is q = h * A * ΔT.

But since it's per unit length, the area A is the surface area per unit length of the pipe. The pipe is a cylinder, so the surface area per unit length is the circumference times 1 foot.

The circumference C = π D. D is 1/3 ft, so C = π*(1/3) ≈ 1.0472 ft.

So A = C * 1 ft = 1.0472 ft².

Wait, no, that's for a unit length. So A is 1.0472 ft² per foot of pipe.

So q = h * A * ΔT.

h is 3.555 Btu/(hr-ft²-°F), A is 1.0472 ft², ΔT is 15°F.

So q = 3.555 * 1.0472 * 15.

Let me compute that.

First, 3.555 * 1.0472 ≈ 3.555 * 1.05 ≈ 3.731. But more accurately, 3.555 *1.0472.

Compute 3 * 1.0472 = 3.1416, 0.555 *1.0472 ≈ 0.581. So total is 3.1416 + 0.581 ≈ 3.7226.

Then multiply by 15: 3.7226 * 15 ≈ 55.839 Btu/hr-ft.

Hmm, that's approximately 55.8 Btu/hr-ft. But wait, looking at the options, the highest is 95, and the options go down to 60. So 55.8 is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong correlation for Nusselt number. Maybe the problem expects me to use a different correlation.

Let me think again. Another correlation for a cylinder in crossflow in the turbulent regime is the one from Churchill and Bernstein, which is:

Nu = 0.3 + [0.62 Re^{0.5} Pr^{1/3} ] / [1 + (0.4/Pr)^{2/3}] * [1 + (Re/282000)^{1/2}]^{1/4}.

But that seems more complicated. Let me try that.

Given Re = 31250, Pr = 0.7.

Compute each part:

First part: 0.62 * Re^0.5 * Pr^(1/3).

Re^0.5 = sqrt(31250) ≈ 176.7767.

Pr^(1/3) = (0.7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.887.

So 0.62 * 176.7767 * 0.887 ≈ 0.62 * 176.7767 ≈ 109.723, then 109.723 * 0.887 ≈ 97.34.

Denominator: 1 + (0.4/Pr)^(2/3) = 1 + (0.4/0.7)^(2/3).

0.4/0.7 ≈ 0.5714.

(0.5714)^(2/3) ≈ e^( (2/3) * ln(0.5714) ) ≈ e^( (2/3)*(-0.554) ) ≈ e^(-0.369) ≈ 0.693.

So denominator is 1 + 0.693 = 1.693.

So the second part is 97.34 / 1.693 ≈ 57.53.

Third part: [1 + (Re/282000)^0.5 ]^0.25.

Re is 31250, so Re/282000 ≈ 0.1109.

(0.1109)^0.5 ≈ 0.333.

So 1 + 0.333 = 1.333.

1.333^0.25 ≈ e^( (1/4)*ln(1.333) ) ≈ e^( (1/4)*0.2877 ) ≈ e^0.0719 ≈ 1.0746.

So the third part is approximately 1.0746.

Putting it all together:

Nu = 0.3 + (57.53) * 1.0746 ≈ 0.3 + 61.83 ≈ 62.13.

So Nu ≈ 62.13.

Now, compute h = (Nu * k) / D.

k = 0.015 Btu/(hr-ft-°F), D = 1/3 ft.

h = (62.13 * 0.015) / (1/3) = (0.932) / (1/3) =
