Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that Lily is going to give away all the pieces of candy in her bag, and she can give an equal number of pieces to 5, 3, or 2 people. So, I need to find out which number of pieces could be in the bag based on the options given.

Hmm, so the key here is that the number of candies must be divisible by 5, 3, and 2. Because if she can divide them equally among those numbers of people, the total must be a multiple of each of those numbers. Wait, no, actually, she can give to 5 people, or 3, or 2. So the total number must be divisible by each of these numbers individually. Because, for example, if she chooses to give to 5 people, the total must be divisible by 5. Similarly for 3 and 2.

So the number we're looking for must be a common multiple of 5, 3, and 2. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of least common multiple. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers will give me the smallest number that fits, and any multiple of that LCM would also work.

Let me calculate the LCM of 5, 3, and 2. Well, 5 is a prime number, 3 is also prime, and 2 is prime. So the LCM would be 5 * 3 * 2 = 30. So the number of candies must be a multiple of 30.

Looking at the options provided:

A:25 → 25 divided by 5 is 5, which is fine, but 25 divided by 3 is not a whole number. So this can't be it.

B:12 → 12 is divisible by 3 and 2, but 12 divided by 5 is 2.4, which isn't whole. So no.

C:50 → 50 divided by 5 is 10, which is good. 50 divided by 2 is 25, also good. But 50 divided by 3 is about 16.666..., which isn't a whole number. So 50 doesn't work.

D:35 → 35 is divisible by 5 (7) and maybe 7, but 35 divided by 3 is about 11.666..., so nope.

E:45 → Let's see: 45 divided by 5 is 9, which is good. 45 divided by 3 is 15, that's fine. 45 divided by 2 is 22.5, which isn't a whole number. Oh wait, but she can give to 2 people? So 45 isn't divisible by 2. So E is out.

F:30 → 30 divided by 5 is 6, which is okay. 30 divided by 3 is 10, that's good. 30 divided by 2 is 15, which works. So 30 is a possible number.

G:20 → 20 divided by 5 is 4, good. 20 divided by 3 is about 6.666..., so nope.

H:15 → 15 divided by 5 is 3, okay. 15 divided by 3 is 5, good. But 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, which isn't a whole number. So H doesn't work.

I:40 → 40/5=8, good. 40/3≈13.333, so nope.

J:55 → 55/5=11, good. 55/3≈18.333, so nope.

So the only number that is divisible by 5, 3, and 2 is 30, which is option F.

The number of pieces of candy must be divisible by 5, 3, and 2. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 30, meaning the total must be a multiple of 30. Among the options, only 30 satisfies this condition.

A: 25 → Not divisible by 3.  
B: 12 → Not divisible by 5.  
C: 50 → Not divisible by 3.  
D: 35 → Not divisible by 3 or 2.  
E: 45 → Not divisible by 2.  
F: 30 → Divisible by 5, 3, and 2.  
G: 20 → Not divisible by 3.  
H: 15 → Not divisible by 2.  
I: 40 → Not divisible by 3.  
J: 55 → Not divisible by 3 or 2.  

The correct answer is **F: 30**.
