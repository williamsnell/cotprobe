Question:

A company wants a 20 percent return on investment before taxes at a sales volume equal to 80 percent of capacity. Fixed annual costs are $200,000 and the annual capacity is 200,00 units. If the variable cost per unit is $9 and the company investment is $1,400,000, what should be the selling price per unit given that production and sales are 80 percent of capacity?

Options:

A: $15
B: $18
C: $13
D: $17
E: $19
F: $11
G: $12
H: $10
I: $16

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company that wants a certain return on investment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the company wants a 20 percent return on investment before taxes. The sales volume is 80 percent of capacity. Their fixed annual costs are $200,000, and the annual capacity is 200,000 units. The variable cost per unit is $9, and the company's investment is $1,400,000. They're asking for the selling price per unit when production and sales are at 80% of capacity.

Wait, so first, I need to find the selling price such that the company achieves a 20% ROI before taxes. ROI is calculated as (Profit / Investment) * 100, right? So they want a 20% return, which means their profit should be 20% of $1,400,000.

Let me write that down. 20% of $1.4M is 0.2 * 1,400,000 = $280,000. So their desired profit before taxes is $280,000.

Now, profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Costs. Total costs include both fixed and variable costs.

The sales volume is 80% of capacity. Capacity is 200,000 units, so 80% of that is 0.8 * 200,000 = 160,000 units.

So they're producing and selling 160,000 units. For each unit, the variable cost is $9, so total variable costs would be 160,000 * $9. Let me calculate that: 160,000 *9 = $1,440,000.

Wait, but wait, no, actually, that's the variable cost. So total variable cost is 9 * 160,000 = $1,440,000. Fixed costs are $200,000. So total costs are $1,440,000 + $200,000 = $1,640,000.

So Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs. We know the desired profit is $280,000, so:

$280,000 = Total Revenue - $1,640,000.

So solving for Total Revenue: Total Revenue = $280,000 + $1,640,000 = $1,920,000.

Total revenue is also equal to the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. So if they're selling 160,000 units, then:

Total Revenue = Selling Price * 160,000.

We can set that equal to $1,920,000.

So, Selling Price = $1,920,000 / 160,000.

Let me compute that. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 1000, that's 1920 / 160. Hmm, 160 times 12 is 1920. So 1920/160 =12. So the selling price per unit would be $12.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes I might have mixed up something.

So, ROI is 20%, so profit is 1.4M * 0.2 = 280k. Correct.

Production is 80% of 200k units: 160k units. Variable cost per unit is $9, so variable costs are 160k *9=1.44M. Fixed costs are 200k. So total costs 1.44M + 0.2M =1.64M. So profit is 1.64M subtracted from revenue.

So revenue needed is 1.64M +280k=1.92M. Then, revenue is price times quantity, 160k units. So 1.92M /160k units =12 per unit. So that's $12. Looking at the options, option G is $12.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't forget anything, like taxes or something. Oh, the question says before taxes, so no, that's correct.

Yes, I think $12 is the correct answer. So option G.

To determine the selling price per unit, we start by calculating the desired profit based on the company's target return on investment (ROI). The company seeks a 20% ROI on its $1,400,000 investment, which translates to:

\[
\text{Desired Profit} = 0.20 \times 1,400,000 = \$280,000.
\]

Next, we calculate the total costs. The company operates at 80% of its annual capacity of 200,000 units, which equals:

\[
\text{Sales Volume} = 0.80 \times 200,000 = 160,000 \, \text{units}.
\]

The variable cost per unit is $9, so the total variable costs are:

\[
\text{Total Variable Costs} = 160,000 \times 9 = \$1,440,000.
\]

Adding the fixed annual costs of $200,000, the total costs become:

\[
\text{Total Costs} = \$1,440,000 + \$200,000 = \$1,640,000.
\]

The total revenue required to achieve the desired profit is:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Costs} + \text{Desired Profit} = \$1,640,000 + \$280,000 = \$1,920,000.
\]

The selling price per unit is then calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of units sold:

\[
\text{Selling Price per Unit} = \frac{\$1,920,000}{160,000} = \$12.
\]

Thus, the selling price per unit is $12, which corresponds to option G.
