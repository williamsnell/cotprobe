Okay, so I've got this problem here about fluid flow and pressure drop. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says water is flowing through a tube. The properties given are density (62.4 lb/ft^3) and viscosity (0.000672 lb/(ft·sec)). The tube has a bore of 0.25 inches and the velocity is 1 foot per second. We need to find the pressure drop over a 10-foot length of the tube.

I remember that pressure drop in pipes is usually calculated using some form of the Darcy-Weisbach equation or maybe the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Wait, Darcy-Weisbach is for more general cases, including turbulent flow, while Hagen-Poiseuille is for laminar flow, right? So which one applies here?

First, I think I should determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. That depends on the Reynolds number. Reynolds number (Re) is given by (density * velocity * diameter) / viscosity. Oh wait, but the units have to be consistent. Let me make sure all the units are in the same system. Since the density is given in lb/ft^3 and viscosity in lb/(ft·sec), I think we're using the English system here.

Wait, but wait, the diameter is in inches. Let me convert that to feet. 0.25 inches is 0.25/12 = 0.0208333 feet.

So, Re = (density * velocity * diameter) / viscosity.

Plugging in the numbers: density is 62.4 lb/ft³, velocity is 1 ft/s, diameter is 0.0208333 ft, and viscosity is 0.000672 lb/(ft·sec).

Calculating the numerator: 62.4 * 1 * 0.0208333 = Let's compute that. 62.4 * 0.0208333 is approximately 62.4 * 0.0208333. 0.0208333 is 1/48, so 62.4 /48. Let's see: 62.4 divided by 48. 48*1=48, 48*1.3=62.4. Oh wait, 48 * 1.3 is 62.4, so 62.4 /48 is 1.3. So, 62.4 * 0.0208333 is 1.3 lb/(ft²·sec) or something? Wait, actually, the units for Re are dimensionless, but let me just compute the number.

So Re = (62.4 * 1 * 0.0208333) / 0.000672. Let me compute numerator: 62.4 * 0.0208333 = approx 1.3. Then 1.3 divided by 0.000672 is approximately 1932. So Re is about 1932.

Wait, the critical Reynolds number is around 2000 for flow in a pipe. So if Re is below 2000, the flow is laminar. If it's above, it's turbulent. Here, Re is 1932, which is just below 2000, so the flow is laminar. That means I can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for pressure drop.

Hagen-Poiseuille equation is ΔP = (8 * viscosity * velocity * L) / (π * r^4 * density * g). Wait, no, maybe I should think again. Or perhaps ΔP = (32 * viscosity * velocity * L) / (diameter² * g * density) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for pressure drop in laminar flow is ΔP = (8 * η * L * v) / (π * r^4). But wait, units might be tricky here. Alternatively, another form I remember is ΔP = (32 * η * v * L) / (d²), where d is the diameter. But wait, no, because that might be in different units. I think in the CGS system, but here we are in the English system, so perhaps I should convert units or adjust the formula accordingly.

Wait, here's another approach. The Darcy-Weisbach equation is more general and can be used for any flow regime. It states that the pressure drop is due to friction, which is given by (f * L * v^2 * density) / (2 * d), where f is the Darcy friction factor.

But for laminar flow, f is 64 / Re. So since we have Re = 1932, which is less than 2000, we can use f = 64 / Re.

So putting it all together, the pressure drop ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * d), where f is 64/Re, ρ is density, v is velocity, and d is diameter.

Wait, let me get the formula correct. Darcy-Weisbach equation is:

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * d), where h_f is the head loss.

But since we need pressure drop ΔP, we can write ΔP = h_f * ρ * g.

Wait, no, because h_f is in feet, so multiplying by ρ (lb/ft³) and g (ft/sec²) would give units of lb/ft², which is psf, the unit we need.

Wait, let me clarify. The Darcy-Weisbach formula gives the head loss (h_f) as:

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * d)

So to get pressure drop ΔP, we have ΔP = h_f * ρ * g.

Wait, that would be ΔP = (f * L * v² * ρ) ) / (2 * d).

Yes, because h_f is (f L v²)/(2 g d), and then multiplying by ρ g gives (f L v² ρ)/(2 d).

So that makes sense.

Now, plugging in the numbers:

f = 64 / Re = 64 / 1932 ≈ let me calculate that. 64 divided by 1932. Let's see:

1932 / 64 is approximately 30. So 64 / 1932 is approximately 0.0331.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1932 ÷ 64: 64 * 30 = 1920, so 1932-1920=12. So 30 + 12/64 = 30.1875. So 64/1932 = 1/(30.1875) ≈ 0.03313.

So f ≈ 0.03313.

Now, L is 10 ft.

v is 1 ft/s.

ρ is 62.4 lb/ft³.

d is 0.25 inches. Wait, earlier I converted that to 0.0208333 ft, right?

So putting it all into the equation:

ΔP = (f * L * v² * ρ) / (2 * d).

Plug in the numbers:

f = 0.03313,

L = 10,

v = 1,

ρ = 62.4,

d = 0.0208333.

So compute numerator: 0.03313 * 10 * (1)^2 * 62.4.

Let me compute step by step.

0.03313 * 10 = 0.3313.

0.3313 * 62.4 = Let's compute that. 0.33 * 60 = 19.8, but more accurately:

0.3313 * 62.4.

62.4 * 0.3 is 18.72, 62.4 * 0.0313 is about 1.95232.

So total approximately 18.72 + 1.95232 = 20.67232.

Then, denominator: 2 * d = 2 * 0.0208333 = 0.0416666.

So ΔP = 20.67232 / 0.0416666.

Let me compute that: 20.67232 ÷ 0.0416666.

Well, 20.67232 / 0.0416666 is the same as 20.67232 * (1/0.0416666). Since 1/0.0416666 is 24, because 0.0416666 is 1/24.

So 20.67232 * 24 = Let's compute:

20 *24=480,

0.67232 *24≈ 16.13568.

So total is approximately 480 +16.13568 = 496.13568.

Wait, that seems really high. Because 20.67232 divided by 0.0416666 is 20.67232 *24= approx 496.13568 psf.

But looking at the options, the highest option is H: 23.45 psf. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

Wait, Darcy-Weisbach equation is ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * d).

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the units. Let me make sure that all the units are compatible.

f is dimensionless.

L is in ft.

ρ is in lb/ft³.

v is in ft/s.

d is in ft.

So the units for ΔP would be (lb/ft³) * (ft²/s²) * ft / ft.

Wait, let me compute the units:

(f) is dimensionless.

(L) is ft.

(ρ) is lb/ft³.

(v^2) is ft²/s².

So numerator: f * L * ρ * v² → (ft) * (lb/ft³) * (ft²/s²) → (lb * ft²) / (ft³ s²) ) → (lb) / (ft s²).

Denominator: 2 * d → ft.

So overall, ΔP has units (lb/(ft s²)) / ft → lb/(ft² s²). That doesn't seem right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should have included gravity in the formula. Wait, no, because in the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the head loss h_f is (f L v²)/(2 g d), and then ΔP = h_f * ρ * g. So combining them, ΔP = (f L v² ρ) / (2 d).

So the units of h_f are in feet, so when you multiply by ρ (lb/ft³) and g (ft/s²), you get ΔP in lb/ft², which is psf.

Wait, let me recompute the units correctly.

h_f = (f L v²) / (2 g d).

h_f has units of length (feet).

Then, ΔP = h_f * ρ * g.

So ρ is lb/ft³, g is ft/s².

So ΔP's units: (ft) * (lb/ft³) * (ft/s²) = lb/(ft·s²) * ft = lb/(s²). Wait, that doesn't give psf. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula directly as ΔP = (8 η L v) / (π r^4) for laminar flow, but that's when the flow is in the laminar regime, which it is here since Re is 1932.

Wait, let me try that approach. So Hagen-Poiseuille equation is ΔP = (8 η L v) / (π r^4).

But I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Given that η is in lb/(ft·sec), L is in ft, v is in ft/s, r is in ft.

So let's compute this.

First, compute r: diameter is 0.25 inches, so radius is 0.125 inches, which is 0.125/12 = 0.0104166667 ft.

So r = 0.0104166667 ft.

Now, plug into the equation:

ΔP = (8 * η * L * v) / (π * r^4).

Compute each part:

η = 0.000672 lb/(ft·s).

L = 10 ft.

v = 1 ft/s.

r = 0.0104166667 ft.

Compute numerator: 8 * 0.000672 * 10 * 1 = 8 * 0.000672 * 10 = 0.05376.

Denominator: π * (0.0104166667)^4.

Let me compute r^4 first.

0.0104166667 ft = 1/96 ft ≈ 0.010416667.

(1/96)^4 = 1/(96^4).

Compute 96^4: 96^2 = 9216; 96^4 = (9216)^2 = 84,934,656.

So r^4 = 1/(84,934,656) ≈ 1.177e-8 ft^4.

So denominator = π * 1.177e-8 ≈ 3.700e-8.

Now, ΔP = 0.05376 / 3.700e-8.

Compute that: 0.05376 / 3.7e-8 ≈ 1.452 psf.

Wait, but that's way lower than any of the options given. The options start at 8.22 psf. So that can't be right. So where did I go wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the Hagen-Poiseuille equation isn't applicable here because the flow isn't in the correct regime, but I thought Re was 1932, so it's laminar. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should use the Darcy-Weisbach equation correctly with the correct friction factor. Let me recalculate.

Re = 1932, so in laminar flow, f = 64/Re = 64/1932 ≈ 0.03313.

Then, ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * d).

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.03313,

L = 10 ft,

ρ = 62.4 lb/ft³,

v = 1 ft/s,

d = 0.25 in = 0.0208333 ft.

So compute numerator: 0.03313 * 10 * 62.4 * (1)^2.

0.03313 * 10 = 0.3313.

0.3313 * 62.4 = let's compute that.

60 * 0.3313 = 19.878,

2.4 * 0.3313 ≈ 0.7951,

So total ≈ 19.878 + 0.7951 = 20.6731.

Denominator: 2 * 0.0208333 = 0.0416666.

So ΔP = 20.6731 / 0.0416666 ≈ 496.1357 psf.

But that's way higher than any of the options given. So this can't be right either. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the Darcy-Weisbach formula. Let me check the formula again.

The correct Darcy-Weisbach equation is:

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * d),

and ΔP = h_f * ρ * g.

So ΔP = (f * L * v² * ρ) / (2 * d).

Wait, but let me include g in the calculation. Because maybe I missed that. Oh wait, in the previous approach, I didn't include g. Let me correct that.

So h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * d).

Then, ΔP = h_f * ρ * g = (f * L * v² * ρ) / (2 * d).

Wait, that's what I did before, so including g in the formula cancels out because when calculating ΔP, you multiply by ρ * g. So the formula remains the same.

Hmm, that's confusing because plugging the numbers gives a much higher value than the options.

Wait, maybe I should try the Hagen-Poiseuille equation again, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Hagen-Poiseuille equation: ΔP = (8 * η * L * v) / (π * r^4).

Wait, let me compute it again, but being more precise.

Compute r^4:

r = 0.25 inch / 2 = 0.125 inch = 0.125/12 ft = 0.0104166667 ft.

r^4 = (0.0104166667)^4 = let me compute this step by step.

0.0104166667^2 = (approx) 0.00010833333.

Then, 0.00010833333 squared is approx 0.000000011759.

So r^4 ≈ 1.176e-8 ft^4.

So denominator: π * 1.176e-8 ≈ 3.7e-8.

Numerator: 8 * η * L * v.

η is 0.000672 lb/(ft·s),

L =10 ft,

v=1 ft/s.

So 8 * 0.000672 = 0.005376.

0.005376 *10 = 0.05376.

0.05376 *1 = 0.05376.

So numerator is 0.05376.

So ΔP = 0.05376 / 3.7e-8 ≈ 1.452 psf.

But the options don't have anything near 1.45. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the diameter and radius in Hagen-Poiseuille. Let me check. Hagen-Poiseuille uses radius, yes, so r is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the units for viscosity are given in different units than I'm using. Let me check the units again.

Viscosity is given as 0.000672 lb/(ft·sec). Wait, but in the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, when using the English system, the viscosity unit is lb/(ft·s), which is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure about the formula. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation in consistent units should be:

ΔP = (8 * η * L * v) / (π * r^4).

But perhaps I should check the formula again
