The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?

Options:

A: No, because the employer cannot intervene in a personal injury case.
B: No, because the employer's claim is not directly related to the clerk's personal injury claim.
C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.
D: No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
E: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the amount the clerk is seeking in damages.
F: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.
G: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.
H: No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about federal procedure, specifically regarding intervention in a lawsuit. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a mail clerk who got injured and is suing the building owner for negligence. The employer wants to intervene, asserting its own claim for the damaged computer. The question is whether the court will grant the motion to intervene.

First, I remember that intervention is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. There are two types: intervention as of right and permissive intervention.

Intervention as of right applies when the applicant has an interest in the subject matter, the disposition of the case might impair that interest, and the applicant isn't adequately represented by existing parties. Alternatively, permissive intervention is allowed if the applicant's claim shares common questions of law or fact with the existing case.

Looking at the clerk's case: the clerk is suing for personal injuries, and the employer is suing for property damage (the computer). The building owner is the defendant in both cases. So, the employer's claim is against the same defendant, and the negligence claim would likely involve similar facts—like the condition of the loading dock, whether the owner was negligent in maintaining it, etc.

So the employer's claim shares common questions of law (negligence) and fact (the ice, the dock, the accident). That seems to fit the permissive intervention criteria under Rule 24(b)(1)(A), which allows intervention when there's a common question of law or fact.

Wait, but what about intervention as of right? Let's see. The employer's interest is in recovering for the damaged computer. The clerk's case is about his personal injuries. If the clerk were to lose, would that impair the employer's interest? Not necessarily, because the clerk and the employer have different claims. The employer's claim is based on property damage, while the clerk's is personal injury. So maybe the employer's interest isn't directly tied to the outcome of the clerk's case in a way that would require intervention as of right.

But for permissive intervention, the court has discretion. If the claims share common facts and legal issues, the court might allow it. This makes sense because it promotes efficiency—trying both claims together could avoid duplicate litigation and consistent outcomes on common issues.

Looking at the options:

Option C says yes because the employer has a direct negligence claim. That might be true, but that's about whether they have a claim, not whether they can intervene. The question is about intervention, not the merits of the claim.

Option G says yes because of common questions. That aligns with permissive intervention.

Option D says no because the interest isn't impaired. That's probably about intervention as of right. Since the employer's interest is separate, maybe D is a contender. But the employer isn't required to intervene as of right, but can the court permit it under permissive?

So the motion is timely, and the claims are related. The employer's claim is not directly about the clerk's injury but about the same incident. The court might grant permissive intervention because of shared issues.

So the answer is likely G: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions with the clerk's action.

Wait, but another thought: Is the employer's claim derivative? Like, does it depend on the clerk's claim succeeding? Probably not, because the employer's claim is about the computer damage, which is a separate harm from the clerk's injury. So the clerk could lose, but the employer might still win if they can prove the building owner's negligence caused the computer damage, regardless of the clerk's personal injury.

So the employer's interest isn't directly tied to the clerk's case outcome, which would mean that intervention as of right (which requires that the applicant's interest may be impaired) might not apply. But permissive intervention is still possible because of the common questions.

So the correct answer would be G. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the motion to intervene based on common questions of law and fact.

The question revolves around whether the employer's motion to intervene in the clerk's personal injury lawsuit against the building owner is likely to be granted. Intervention is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, which allows for two types: intervention as of right and permissive intervention. 

Intervention as of right requires that the applicant has an interest in the subject matter, the disposition of the case might impair that interest, and the applicant is not adequately represented by existing parties. However, in this case, the employer's claim for property damage (the computer) is separate from the clerk's personal injury claim, and the clerk's case outcome does not directly impair the employer's interest. Therefore, intervention as of right does not apply.

Permissive intervention, under Rule 24(b)(1)(A), allows the court to grant intervention if the applicant's claim shares common questions of law or fact with the existing case. Here, both the clerk and the employer are alleging negligence by the building owner related to the same incident—the ice near the loading dock. The employer's claim for property damage and the clerk's claim for personal injury both depend on proving the building owner's negligence in maintaining the premises. This overlap in factual and legal issues makes permissive intervention appropriate.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** correctly identifies that the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action, making permissive intervention likely. 
- Other options, such as **Option C**, focus on the employer's direct claim but do not address the intervention criteria. 
- **Option D** incorrectly assumes that the employer's interest is not impaired, which is irrelevant since permissive intervention does not require impairment of interest.

Thus, the court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene based on the common questions of law and fact shared between the two claims.
