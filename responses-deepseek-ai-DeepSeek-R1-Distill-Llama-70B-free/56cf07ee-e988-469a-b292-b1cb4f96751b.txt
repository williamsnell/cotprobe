The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A furniture store had a truck that an employee of the store used to deliver furniture to the store's customers. One afternoon while the employee was driving the truck to deliver a chair to a customer, the employee negligently ran through a stop sign and hit a car. The driver of the car suffered a leg injury and succeeded in suing the furniture store, recovering $25,000. Assume that all of these events occur in a jurisdiction that has statutes permitting defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity. In the event that the furniture store brings suit against its employee (the truck driver) to recover for its losses, the furniture store will recover

Options:

A: $15,000, because the employee and the furniture store share 60-40 responsibility for the accident.
B: $25,000, unless the furniture store was fully insured against such losses.
C: nothing, because the furniture store should have maintained the truck in a safer condition.
D: $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident.
E: nothing, because the furniture store was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages.
F: $12,500, unless the furniture store had provided proper training to the employee.
G: nothing, because the employee was not acting negligently.
H: the full amount, only if the employee has sufficient personal insurance coverage.
I: $12,500, because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.
J: nothing, because the employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with employer liability and the ability of the employer to seek contribution or indemnity from the employee. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a furniture store's employee was using a company truck to deliver furniture. He ran a stop sign negligently and hit another car, injuring the driver. The driver sued the furniture store and recovered $25,000. Now, the store is suing the employee to recover their losses. The question is about how much, if anything, the store can recover from the employee.

First, I remember that under the doctrine of respondeat superior, employers are vicariously liable for the torts committed by their employees within the scope of employment. So here, the employee was delivering furniture, which is within his job duties, so the store would be liable for his actions.

But the question is about the store's ability to seek contribution or indemnity from the employee. I think this depends on the jurisdiction's approach to joint and several liability, and whether the employer can shift some or all of the liability back to the employee.

In some jurisdictions, if the employer is held vicariously liable, but the employee was negligent, the employer can seek indemnity from the employee. Indemnity usually means the employer can recover all the damages they had to pay, while contribution would only allow them to recover a portion, based on the employee's share of fault.

But wait, I also recall that in many jurisdictions, the employer cannot seek indemnity from the employee if the employer is vicariously liable because the employer's liability is based on the employer-employee relationship, not on any direct negligence by the employer itself. So if the employer didn't do anything wrong except for hiring the employee or providing the truck, they might not be able to shift the liability.

Wait, but sometimes if the employer was also negligent, like if they didn't maintain the truck properly or didn't train the employee, then they could be directly liable as well. But in this case, the facts don't indicate any direct negligence by the employer. The employee was simply driving negligently while delivering furniture.

So if the employer's liability is solely based on respondeat superior without any independent negligence, the employer might not be able to recover from the employee. Because the employer is liable regardless of their own fault, the employee's negligence is imputed to the employer, but the employer can't then pass that back to the employee unless there's some specific rule allowing it.

I think the general rule is that an employer cannot seek indemnity from an employee when the employer's liability is based solely on the doctrine of respondeat superior. The employer can only seek contribution or indemnity if the employer is also at fault. So here, since the store didn't have any direct fault, they can't recover anything from the employee.

Looking at the options:

A: Suggests a 60-40 split, but I don't think that's the case here because the employer is fully liable under respondeat superior.

B: Says $25k unless the employer was fully insured. I don't think insurance affects the ability to seek indemnity; it's more about whether the employer is liable.

C: Says nothing because the store should have maintained the truck safer. But the facts don't say anything about the truck's maintenance, so this is probably not applicable.

D: $25k because the employee was at fault. But as I thought earlier, the employer can't recover if they're only vicariously liable.

E: Nothing because the employer is primarily liable. This might be correct because if the employer can't seek indemnity, they can't recover anything.

F: $12.5k unless proper training was provided. Again, this depends on the employer's own negligence, which isn't indicated here.

G: Nothing because the employee wasn't negligent. But the employee was negligent, so this is incorrect.

H: Full amount only if the employee has insurance. I don't think the employee's insurance is the issue; it's about the legal ability to recover.

I: $12.5k as equal responsibility. But the employer is fully responsible under respondeat superior; the employee's share doesn't reduce the employer's liability.

J: Nothing because the employee was acting within the scope of employment. That makes sense because the employer's liability is based on that, and they can't shift the loss to the employee in such cases.

Wait, option J says nothing because the employee was within the scope. That's consistent with what I was thinkingâ€”the employer can't get indemnity because the employee was acting within the scope, so the employer's liability is based on respondeat superior without their own fault.

So the answer should be J. But wait, let me double-check. Some jurisdictions allow employers to seek indemnity from employees if the employee was negligent and the employer wasn't. But I think in many US jurisdictions, the employer can't. For example, under the common law, the employer is liable, and the employee is also liable, but the employer can't make the employee indemnify them unless the employer had some separate duty that they breached.

In this case, the store didn't have any direct negligence; the employee was the only one at fault. So the store would be liable for the $25k but can't recover it from the employee because the store's liability is based solely on respondeat superior. Therefore, the correct answer is J.

In this scenario, the furniture store is vicariously liable for the employee's negligence under the doctrine of respondeat superior because the employee was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred. The question revolves around whether the store can recover from the employee for the $25,000 it paid to settle the claim.

Under the general rule in many jurisdictions, an employer cannot seek indemnity from an employee when the employer's liability is based solely on respondeat superior and the employer is not independently negligent. Indemnity is typically allowed only if the employer has direct liability due to its own negligence or breach of duty. Here, the facts do not indicate any direct negligence by the furniture store, such as improper maintenance of the truck or inadequate training of the employee. Therefore, the store cannot shift the loss to the employee.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, F, I**: These options suggest splitting liability, but the employer is fully liable under respondeat superior, and there is no indication of shared fault.
- **B, H**: These options introduce insurance as a factor, but insurance does not affect the legal ability to seek indemnity.
- **C, E, G**: These options are incorrect because they misstate the basis for liability or the facts of the case.
- **D**: This option assumes the employer can recover the full amount because the employee was at fault, but this ignores the general rule that employers cannot seek indemnity from employees in cases of vicarious liability without employer fault.
- **J**: This is correct because the employer cannot recover from the employee when the employee was acting within the scope of employment, as the employer's liability is based solely on respondeat superior.

Thus, the furniture store cannot recover anything from the employee.

**Answer: J**
