Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question is about a textbook that weighs 30 N at sea level. Then, it's asking what the best estimate of its weight would be on a mountain peak that's 6,000 meters above sea level. The options are from A to J, with various Newtons given.

Hmm, I remember that weight is related to gravity. So weight equals mass times gravity, right? W = m * g. At sea level, the textbook's weight is 30 N. So, m * g = 30 N. That means the mass of the textbook is 30 N divided by g, which is 9.8 m/s². But wait, maybe I can just think in terms of the change in gravity rather than calculating the exact mass.

Wait, so Earth's radius is given as 6,400 km, which is 6,400,000 meters. The mountain is 6,000 meters high, so the distance from the center of the Earth to the mountain peak would be 6,400,000 + 6,000 = 6,406,000 meters. 

I think the gravitational force decreases with the square of the distance from the center of the Earth. So the formula for gravitational force (or weight) is F = G * (M * m) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, m is the object's mass, and r is the distance from Earth's center.

Since the textbook's weight at sea level is 30 N, that's F1 = 30 N. At the mountain peak, the distance is larger, so F2 would be less. Let me find the ratio of F2 to F1.

The ratio F2/F1 would be (r1²) / (r2²), because F is inversely proportional to r squared. So r1 is the Earth's radius, 6,400,000 m, and r2 is 6,406,000 m.

Let me calculate r1/r2. So 6,400,000 / 6,406,000. Let me compute that. Maybe approximate it.

6,400,000 divided by 6,406,000. Let's factor out 6,400,000 from denominator: 6,400,000 (1 + 6,000/6,400,000). So 6,000/6,400,000 is 6/6,400, which is 0.0009375, approximately 0.00094.

So r1/r2 = 1 / (1 + 0.0009375) ≈ 1 - 0.0009375, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

So r1²/r2² would be (1 - 0.0009375)^2. But since this is small, maybe I can approximate it as 1 - 2*(0.0009375). Let's compute that.

0.0009375 multiplied by 2 is 0.001875. So 1 - 0.001875 = 0.998125. So F2/F1 is approximately 0.998125.

Then F2 = F1 * 0.998125 = 30 N * 0.998125. Let's compute that.

30 * 0.998125 = 29.94375 N. So approximately 29.94 N.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one to 30 N is option G: 30 N. Hmm, but wait, the change was only about 0.1%, so the weight would be slightly less than 30 N. So perhaps 29.94 N is the value, but the options don't have that. So maybe the answer is 30 N, because the change is negligible, so the weight remains approximately the same.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. The mountain is 6 km high. Let me compute r2 = 6,400,000 + 6,000 = 6,406,000 m. The ratio is 6,400,000 / 6,406,000. Let me compute that as 6400000 / 6406000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 6400 / 6406. Let's compute 6400 ÷ 6406.

Well, 6406 is 6400 +6. So 6400/6406 ≈ (6400)/(6400*(1 + 6/6400)) ) = 1/(1 + 0.0009375). Using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈1 -x + x² -x³... So, approximately 0.9990625. Wait, earlier I thought 1/(1+x) ≈1 -x, but perhaps a better approach is to compute 6400/6406.

Let me compute 6400 divided by 6406.

So 6406 * 0.999 is 6406 - 6.406 = 6399.594. That's less than 6400. So 0.999 gives 6399.594, which is 0.406 less than 6400. So to get 6400, perhaps it's 0.999 + (0.406 / 6406). 0.406/6406 ≈ 0.0000633. So approximately 0.9990633.

So (r1/r2) ≈ 0.9990633. Then (r1/r2)^2 is (0.9990633)^2. Let me compute that.

0.9990633 squared is approximately 0.998127 (since (1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a when a is small. Here, 0.9990633 = 1 - 0.0009367. So squared is 1 - 2*(0.0009367) = 1 - 0.0018734 = 0.9981266.)

So F2/F1 is approximately 0.9981266. Thus F2 = 30 N * 0.9981266 ≈ 29.9438 N. So about 29.94 N.

Looking at the options, the closest one is G:30 N, but wait, the options are in whole numbers, so 30 N is an option. However, wait, another thought: perhaps the change in gravity is so small that the weight is considered approximately the same, so 30 N is the best estimate.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a more precise approach. Let's compute 30 N multiplied by (r1/r2)^2.

r1 = 6.4e6 m, r2=6.406e6 m.

r1/r2 = (6.4e6) / (6.406e6) = 6.4 / 6.406.

Compute 6.4 /6.406. Let's do this division.

6.406 goes into 6.4 zero times. Put a decimal: 64.0 / 64.06.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as 64 / 64.06.

Wait, 64.06 is 64 + 0.06. So 64/(64+0.06) = 1/(1 + 0.06/64) = 1/(1 + 0.0009375) ≈ 0.9990625 as before.

So the square is 0.998127, so F2 is 30 *0.998127 ≈29.944 N.

Now, the options are 30 N (G), 25 N (J), or maybe 29 N isn't an option. So the closest is 30 N. So perhaps the intended answer is G:30 N.

Wait, but another approach. Maybe using the approximation for g at different heights. The standard formula for g at height h is g' = g * (1 - 2h/R), where R is Earth's radius, assuming h << R. So h is 6,000 m, R is 6,400,000 m. So 2h/R = 2*6000/(6.4e6) = 12,000 /6,400,000 = 0.001875.

So g' = g*(1 - 0.001875) = 9.8 m/s² * 0.998125 ≈9.8 *0.998125. Let's compute that. 9.8 *0.998125 = 9.8*(1 - 0.001875) =9.8 - (9.8 *0.001875).

9.8 *0.001875 = 0.018375. So g' ≈9.8 -0.018375 =9.781625 m/s².

Then the weight at the mountain is m * g'. But m is 30 N /9.8 m/s² = approximately 3.0612 kg.

So weight =3.0612 kg *9.781625 m/s² = let's compute that. 3 *9.78 is 29.34, 0.0612 *9.78 ≈0.599. So total ≈29.34 +0.599 =29.939 N. So again, about 29.94 N.

So the weight is approximately 29.94 N, which is very close to 30 N. So the best estimate would be 30 N, option G.

Therefore, the answer should be G:30 N.

The problem involves estimating the weight of a textbook at a height of 6,000 meters above sea level, given that its weight at sea level is 30 N. Weight is calculated as \( W = m \cdot g \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. At sea level, \( g \) is approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), so the mass of the textbook is \( m = \frac{30}{9.8} \approx 3.06 \, \text{kg} \).

The gravitational force decreases with the square of the distance from the Earth's center, according to the formula:

\[
F = \frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{r^2}
\]

where \( r \) is the distance from the Earth's center. At sea level, \( r_1 = 6,400,000 \, \text{m} \), and at the mountain peak, \( r_2 = 6,400,000 + 6,000 = 6,406,000 \, \text{m} \). The ratio of the weights at the two locations is:

\[
\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \left( \frac{r_1}{r_2} \right)^2
\]

Substituting \( r_1 = 6,400,000 \) and \( r_2 = 6,406,000 \):

\[
\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \frac{6,400,000}{6,406,000} \approx 0.999063
\]

Squaring this value:

\[
\left( \frac{r_1}{r_2} \right)^2 \approx 0.998127
\]

Thus, the weight at the mountain peak is:

\[
F_2 = F_1 \cdot 0.998127 = 30 \cdot 0.998127 \approx 29.94 \, \text{N}
\]

This value is very close to 30 N, and the change in weight is negligible for practical purposes. Among the given options, the best estimate for the textbook's weight on the mountain peak is:

**G: 30 N**
