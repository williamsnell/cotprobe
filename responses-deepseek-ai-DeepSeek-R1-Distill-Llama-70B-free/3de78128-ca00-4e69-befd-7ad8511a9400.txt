Question:

A frameshift mutation is created when

Options:

A: a base pair is moved from one location in a gene to another
B: a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one
C: telomeric sequences are removed from DNA
D: a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene
E: a large portion of a chromosome is deleted
F: a gene is duplicated within the DNA sequence
G: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that it no longer codes for any amino acid
H: a base pair is replaced with a different base pair in a gene
I: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that it codes for the same amino acid
J: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation

Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about frameshift mutations. I remember that mutations can change the DNA sequence, and there are different types like point mutations, insertions, deletions, and so on.

The question asks, "A frameshift mutation is created when..." and gives options from A to J. I need to choose the correct one. Let me recall what a frameshift mutation is. From what I remember, frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted or deleted in a number that's not a multiple of three. Since codons are three nucleotides long, adding or removing one or two (or any number not divisible by three) would shift the entire reading frame. This changes all the subsequent codons downstream from the mutation, leading to a completely different translation of the genetic code.

So looking at the options:

Option A: A base pair is moved from one location to another. That sounds more like a translocation, maybe, but not necessarily a frameshift. Or perhaps it's a type of rearrangement, but I don't think moving a base pair alone would create a frameshift unless it's an insertion or deletion.

Option B: A codon's sequence changes to code for a different amino acid. That's a missense mutation, right? Because a single codon is altered, leading to a different amino acid. Not a frameshift.

Option C: Telomeric sequences are removed. Telomeres are at the ends of chromosomes, and their removal might lead to other issues like chromosome instability, but not specifically a frameshift mutation. That's more about chromosome structure.

Option D: A base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene. Oh, wait, this sounds familiar. Insertion or deletion (indels) of one or two base pairs would cause a frameshift. Because if you add or remove a number not divisible by three, the reading frame shifts. So this could be the correct answer.

Option E: A large portion of a chromosome is deleted. That's a chromosomal deletion, perhaps leading to various issues, but not a frameshift mutation. Frameshifts are specific to the reading frame in a gene.

Option F: A gene is duplicated. Duplication would add an extra copy of a gene, but unless it's a number of base pairs that's not a multiple of three, it might cause a frameshift. Wait, but duplication usually refers to a segment that's a multiple of three, so maybe it doesn't cause a frameshift. Or maybe it depends. Hmm. I'm not sure, but the question is about what creates a frameshift, so I think duplication might not necessarily cause it. Plus, the option doesn't specify the number of base pairs, so I think D is more accurate.

Option G: A codon's sequence changes to stop coding for any amino acid. That's a nonsense mutation, creating a premature stop codon. Not a frameshift.

Option H: A base pair is replaced with another. That's a point mutation, specifically a substitution. Could be a silent, missense, or nonsense mutation, but not a frameshift.

Option I: Codon changes but codes for the same amino acid. That's a silent mutation. No effect on protein, so not a frameshift.

Option J: Codon changes to a stop codon. Again, that's a nonsense mutation, not frameshift.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene. Because insertions or deletions (indels) of bases in numbers not divisible by three cause a frameshift. But wait, the option D says either inserted or deleted. Even if it's just one or two, that's enough to shift the frame. So yes, D is correct.

A frameshift mutation occurs when the reading frame of a gene is altered, which happens when nucleotides are inserted or deleted in a number that is not a multiple of three. This disrupts the codon sequence, leading to a completely different translation of the genetic code downstream from the mutation.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Moving a base pair is more akin to a translocation or rearrangement, not a frameshift.
- **B**: A codon changing to code for a different amino acid is a missense mutation, not a frameshift.
- **C**: Removing telomeric sequences affects chromosome stability but does not relate to frameshift mutations.
- **D**: Insertion or deletion of a base pair (or a number not divisible by three) shifts the reading frame, directly causing a frameshift mutation.
- **E**: Deleting a large chromosomal portion is a chromosomal deletion, not a frameshift.
- **F**: Gene duplication may not necessarily cause a frameshift unless the duplicated segment disrupts the reading frame.
- **G**: A codon changing to stop coding for an amino acid is a nonsense mutation, not a frameshift.
- **H**: Replacing a base pair is a point mutation, not a frameshift.
- **I**: A codon changing to code for the same amino acid is a silent mutation, not a frameshift.
- **J**: A codon changing to a stop codon is a nonsense mutation, not a frameshift.

The correct answer is **D**, as insertions or deletions of base pairs in a gene are the direct cause of frameshift mutations.
