Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the atomic weight of electrons. Hmm, I remember that the atomic weight is usually the mass per mole of a substance, right? But wait, electrons are subatomic particles, so their atomic weight would be different from atoms or molecules.

The question gives the mass of an electron as 9.109 × 10^-28 grams. I think I need to find out how many grams are in one mole of electrons. Oh right, a mole is Avogadro's number, which is about 6.022 × 10^23 particles per mole.

So the plan is to take the mass of one electron and multiply it by Avogadro's number to get the molar mass. Let me write that down: mass_per_mole = mass_of_one_electron × Avogadro's_number.

Plugging in the numbers: 9.109e-28 g * 6.022e23 (mol^-1). Let me calculate that. 

Wait, 9.109 times 6.022 is approximately... let's see, 9 * 6 is 54, but more accurately, 9.109 * 6.022. Hmm, 9 * 6 is 54, 0.109 *6 is about 0.654, so 54.654. Then 9.109 * 0.022 is about 0.200. So adding those together, about 54.854. So the product is roughly 54.85? Wait, no, because the exponents are 10^-28 and 10^23. So multiplying those gives 10^(-28+23) = 10^-5. So the total would be 54.85e-5 grams per mole. Wait, 54.85e-5 is the same as 5.485e-4 grams per mole. 

Looking at the options, option C is 5.48 × 10^-4 g/mole. That seems to fit. But let me double-check my calculation to be sure.

Wait, 9.109e-28 multiplied by 6.022e23. Let me compute it step by step. 

9.109 * 6.022 = let's calculate that precisely. 9 *6=54, 9*0.022=0.198. 0.109 *6=0.654, 0.109*0.022≈0.002398. Adding all together: 54 +0.198 +0.654 +0.002398. Let's see: 54 +0.198 is 54.198, plus 0.654 is 54.852, plus 0.0024 is 54.8544. So about 54.8544e-5 grams per mole. 

Wait, 54.8544e-5 is 5.48544e-4 grams per mole. So that's approximately 5.48e-4, which matches option C. 

I should make sure I didn't mix up grams and kilograms or anything. The units in the answer are grams per mole, which is correct for molar mass. 

Another way to think: the molar mass of an electron is (mass of electron) × Avogadro's number. So yeah, that's exactly what I did.

I think that's right. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the atomic weight of electrons, we start with the given mass of a single electron, \( 9.109 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{g} \), and multiply it by Avogadro's number, \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \), to find the molar mass. The calculation is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of electrons} = (9.109 \times 10^{-28}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23}) = 5.485 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

This result matches option C, \( 5.48 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{g/mole} \), which is the correct answer. The units are consistent with molar mass, and the calculation confirms the value.
