The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A business purchased a computer from a seller's web site. The purchase form had a prominent hyperlink connection to a page that contained "important additional terms and conditions of sale," but the purchaser did not access that page. The delivered product included the additional terms in writing, along with a bold-lettered notice requiring the purchaser to return the product within 30 days if it did not accept the stated terms and conditions. After 35-days, the business became dissatisfied with the computer, and sued the seller for breach of contract. The seller demanded that the dispute be decided by private arbitration as per the additional terms and conditions to the agreement. Is the purchaser legally bound to participate in arbitration?

Options:

A: No, because federal law requires that a company give 90 days for return and the 30-day provision was null and void.
B: No, because there was no contract formed due to the purchaser's lack of assent to the additional terms and conditions.
C: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.
D: Yes, because the seller provided the additional terms and conditions in writing with the delivered product.
E: No, because the purchaser did not explicitly agree to the terms and conditions that include private arbitration.
F: Yes, because the purchaser was aware of the additional terms and conditions, despite not accessing them.
G: No, because the seller did not clearly communicate the additional terms and conditions to the purchaser.
H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.
I: No, because the seller did not obtain explicit consent from the purchaser for the additional terms and conditions.
J: Yes, because federal law requires that arbitration must be used to attempt an initial resolution with respect to sales that take place on the internet.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let's see. The situation is a business bought a computer from a seller's website. The purchase form had a prominent hyperlink to additional terms and conditions, but the purchaser didn't access that page. Then, when the product was delivered, it included those additional terms in writing with a bold notice saying to return within 30 days if they didn't accept the terms. The business didn't return it within 30 days—35 days later, they were dissatisfied and sued. The seller wants the dispute to go to private arbitration as per those additional terms.

The question is whether the purchaser is legally bound to arbitration. So, the main issue is whether those additional terms became part of the contract.

First, I remember that contract formation requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, for terms to be part of a contract, they usually need to be agreed upon. In online terms, sometimes courts look at whether the terms were presented in a way that a reasonable person would notice them.

In this case, the purchase form had a hyperlink to the terms. The purchaser didn't click on it, so didn't see the terms during purchase. But then, the terms were included in the delivered product with a notice. The notice said to return within 30 days if they didn't accept. The purchaser didn't return it, so kept it for 35 days.

I think this is a "browse-wrap" vs. "click-wrap" agreement situation. Click-wrap requires the user to click "I agree," which makes it more likely the terms are enforceable. Browse-wrap just has a hyperlink, so it's less clear. But here, the terms were also provided after the purchase, in the delivered product.

When a buyer receives goods with terms, if they don't reject them within a certain period, it can be considered acceptance. This is similar to the UCC's rules about additional terms in a contract between merchants. Under UCC §2-207, additional terms become part of the contract unless they're material and the offeror objects within a reasonable time. But I'm not sure if that applies here because this might be a consumer transaction, not between merchants.

Alternatively, this might be a question of whether the additional terms were effectively communicated and accepted. The fact that the terms were in the delivered product with a clear notice to return within 30 days could imply that by keeping the product beyond that period, the purchaser accepted the terms.

So, the key points are:
1. The terms were available via hyperlink at purchase, but purchaser didn't access them.
2. Terms were included with the product and a 30-day return notice.
3. Purchaser didn't return within 30 days, keeping it for 35.

I think the courts would look at whether the purchaser had a reasonable opportunity to know about the terms and whether their conduct (not returning) indicated acceptance.

In cases like this, when terms are provided after the sale but with a clear option to return, courts sometimes find that the buyer's retention of the goods beyond the specified period constitutes acceptance of the terms. So the additional terms, including arbitration, become part of the contract.

Looking at the options:

Option C says yes, because not returning within 30 days binds them to the terms. That seems to fit.

Option E says no because no explicit agreement. But maybe the conduct (not returning) is enough.

Option B says no contract formed due to lack of assent. But maybe the initial purchase was a contract, and the additional terms were added afterwards. Or perhaps the initial contract incorporates the terms via the hyperlink, but if the hyperlink wasn't clicked, that might not be sufficient.

Wait, the initial purchase might have formed a contract without the additional terms. Then the seller sends additional terms with the product, which the purchaser can either accept or reject by returning. So by not returning, the purchaser agrees to those terms.

So the initial contract is from the purchase, and the additional terms are proposed afterwards. Under UCC, if these are additional terms and the purchaser doesn't object, they might become part of the contract. So yes, the purchaser is bound.

So looking at the options, C says yes because not returning binds them. D says yes because writing with delivered product, but maybe that's not enough if the purchaser didn't agree. H says yes because part of contract regardless of reading, but that seems too broad.

I think the correct answer is C because the failure to return within 30 days after clear notice would indicate acceptance of the terms.

The question revolves around whether the purchaser is legally bound to arbitration based on additional terms and conditions provided after the purchase. The key issues are whether the terms were effectively communicated and accepted by the purchaser.

1. **Initial Purchase and Hyperlink**: The purchase form included a hyperlink to additional terms, but the purchaser did not access it. This raises the issue of whether the terms were sufficiently communicated at the time of purchase. Generally, for terms to be enforceable, they must be presented in a way that a reasonable person would notice them. However, the purchaser's failure to access the hyperlink complicates this.

2. **Delivered Terms and Notice**: The seller included the additional terms with the delivered product, along with a bold-lettered notice requiring the purchaser to return the product within 30 days if they did not accept the terms. This creates a scenario where the purchaser had a clear opportunity to reject the terms by returning the product. The purchaser did not return the product within the specified 30-day period, keeping it for 35 days instead.

3. **Acceptance by Conduct**: Courts often find that when terms are provided after a sale, along with a reasonable opportunity to reject them (e.g., by returning the product), the purchaser's retention of the goods beyond the specified period can constitute acceptance of the terms. This principle suggests that the purchaser's inaction (not returning the product) indicates acceptance of the additional terms, including the arbitration clause.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option C**: Correct. The purchaser's failure to return the product within 30 days binds them to the additional terms, as their conduct implies acceptance.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. While explicit agreement was not given, the purchaser's conduct (not returning the product) can imply acceptance.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. A contract was formed at the time of purchase, and the additional terms were subsequently accepted through the purchaser's conduct.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the terms were provided in writing, mere inclusion with the product is not sufficient without evidence of acceptance.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. This option overstates the enforceability of terms without considering the necessity of acceptance.
   - **Other Options**: A, F, G, I, J are either irrelevant or incorrect based on the facts.

The correct answer is **C**, as the purchaser's failure to return the product within the specified period indicates acceptance of the additional terms, binding them to arbitration.
