Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: A population undergoes a shift where the really tall and really short individuals decrease in relative frequency compared to those of medium size. This happens because of a change in resource availability. And the question is asking what this is an example of, with options from A to J.

Hmm. I remember that this has to do with natural selection types. Let me think about the different types of selection. 

There's directional selection, which is when one extreme of a trait becomes more common. Like if being taller gives a big advantage, the population shifts towards taller individuals. But in this case, both the tall and the short are decreasing, so that's not it.

Then there's stabilizing selection. I think that's when the extremes are selected against, and the average or medium trait becomes more common. Because having too much or too little of a trait is bad. So in this scenario, the medium-sized individuals are favored, which makes their numbers go up relative to the tall and short. That sounds exactly like what's happening here. So this should be stabilizing selection.

Wait, what about the other options? Let me make sure I'm not mixing them up. 

Disruptive selection is the opposite of stabilizing. In disruptive selection, the extremes are favored, and the middle is selected against. So that's when the population splits into two groups. But here, the extremes are decreasing, so it's not disruptive.

Genetic drift is random changes in allele frequencies, not related to selection pressures. So it's not that. 

Bottleneck effect is a type of genetic drift where a population's size is drastically reduced, leading to loss of diversity. Not the case here.

Founder effect is when a new population is started by a small number of individuals, leading to a loss of genetic variation. Also not relevant.

Convergent evolution is when different species develop similar traits because they live in similar environments. Not related here.

Sympatric speciation is when new species form in the same geographic area, usually due to reproductive isolation. Not what's happening here.

Adaptive radiation is when a single species splits into multiple species that occupy different ecological niches. Not this.

Sexual selection is about traits that improve mating success, like peacock tails. Doesn't fit the scenario.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be stabilizing selection, which is option B.

The question describes a scenario where individuals with extreme traits (very tall or very short) decrease in relative frequency, while those with medium size increase. This occurs due to a change in resource availability, which suggests a form of natural selection. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Directional selection** (E) is incorrect because it involves a shift toward one extreme of a trait, not a reduction of extremes.
- **Disruptive selection** (D) is the opposite of this scenario, as it favors extremes and selects against the middle.
- **Stabilizing selection** (B) fits perfectly, as it describes selection against extremes, favoring the average or medium trait.
- Other options like **genetic drift** (C), **founder effect** (I), and **bottleneck effect** (G) involve random changes or reductions in genetic diversity, not selection pressures.
- **Convergent evolution** (A), **sympatric speciation** (F), **adaptive radiation** (H), and **sexual selection** (J) are unrelated to the described scenario.

Thus, the correct answer is **stabilizing selection**.

Answer: B
