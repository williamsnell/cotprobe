Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the mass of calcium bromide needed to prepare a solution. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on molarity calculations, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mass of CaBr₂ required to make 150 ml of a 3.5 M solution. The molecular weight (M.W.) is given as 200.618 g/mole. Alright, I remember that molarity is moles per liter.

Wait, so molarity (M) is moles of solute per liter of solution. So, first, I should find out how many moles of CaBr₂ are needed. Then, convert that to grams using the molecular weight.

But wait, the volume here is 150 ml, which is 0.15 liters. Because, right, 1 liter is 1000 ml. So I need to calculate moles as Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters.

Molarity (M) = moles / liters → moles = M * liters.

So moles = 3.5 M * 0.15 L. Let me compute that. 3.5 times 0.15 is... 3.5 * 0.1 is 0.35, and 3.5 * 0.05 is 0.175. So 0.35 + 0.175 is 0.525 moles. So I need 0.525 moles of CaBr₂.

Now, to find the mass, I multiply moles by molecular weight. Molecular weight is 200.618 g/mol.

So mass = moles * M.W. = 0.525 mol * 200.618 g/mol.

Calculating that: 200.618 times 0.5 is 100.309. Then, 200.618 times 0.025 is... let's see: 200.618 * 0.02 is 4.01236, and 200.618 * 0.005 is 1.00309. So adding those gives 4.01236 + 1.00309 = 5.01545. So 100.309 + 5.01545 is 105.32445 grams. So approximately 105.32 g.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 105.32 g. So the answer should be C.

Wait, just double-checking. Oh wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 0.525 times 200.618.

Let me do it step by step:

200.618 * 0.5 = 100.309.

200.618 * 0.02 = 4.01236.

200.618 * 0.005 = 1.00309.

Adding 100.309 + 4.01236 = 104.32136. Then 104.32136 + 1.00309 = 105.32445.

So yes, ~105.32 grams. So option C is correct.

To determine the mass of calcium bromide (CaBr₂) needed to prepare 150 mL of a 3.5 M solution, we start by calculating the number of moles of CaBr₂ required. Molarity (M) is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution, so:

\[
\text{Moles of CaBr}_2 = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume in liters}
\]

Given that the volume is 150 mL (or 0.15 L) and the molarity is 3.5 M:

\[
\text{Moles of CaBr}_2 = 3.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.15 \, \text{L} = 0.525 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Next, we convert moles to grams using the molecular weight (M.W.) of CaBr₂, which is 200.618 g/mol:

\[
\text{Mass of CaBr}_2 = \text{Moles} \times \text{M.W.} = 0.525 \, \text{mol} \times 200.618 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
\text{Mass of CaBr}_2 = 0.525 \times 200.618 = 105.32445 \, \text{g}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the required mass is approximately **105.32 g**. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**C: 105.32 g of CaBr₂.**

C
