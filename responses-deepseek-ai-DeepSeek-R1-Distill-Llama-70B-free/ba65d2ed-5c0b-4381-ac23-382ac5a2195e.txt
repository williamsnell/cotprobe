Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa."
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974
Rodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?

Options:

A: The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers
B: The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World
C: The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa
D: The importation of New World products into Africa

Okay, so I've got this history question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about Walter Rodney's argument in his book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa." The passage provided says that the imperialist system is responsible for African underdevelopment by draining its wealth and preventing resource development. It also mentions that Western European capitalists expanded their exploitation beyond Europe to Africa.

The question is asking which development from 1450 to 1750 C.E. Rodney's argument is responding to. The options are A through D.

Let me break this down. Rodney is talking about imperialism and capitalism as the main causes of Africa's underdevelopment. He specifically points out that European capitalists exploited Africa, which started during the period of European exploration and colonization.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers. Wait, I thought that during 1450-1750, Europeans didn't really colonize the interiors yet. That happened more in the 19th century with the Scramble for Africa. So maybe this isn't the right answer.

Option B: The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World. That's the transatlantic slave trade, right? Europeans took enslaved Africans to the Americas. Rodney's argument is about how Europe exploited Africa, and the slave trade was a big part of that. This seems related.

Option C: The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa. While Christianity did spread in some parts, I don't think that's the main focus here. Rodney is more about economic exploitation rather than religious spread.

Option D: The importation of New World products into Africa. This is about the Columbian Exchange bringing goods like maize, cassava, etc. But Rodney is talking about Europe exploiting Africa, not so much about trade of goods into Africa. So this might not be the primary focus.

Wait, but what's the timeline again? The period is 1450-1750. So during this time, Europeans were involved in the slave trade, extracting resources, and establishing trade posts but not full colonization yet.

Rodney's argument is about the exploitation that started with European contact, which includes the slave trade and resource extraction. So the expansion of the African diaspora (the slave trade) is a key part of how Europe underdeveloped Africa, as it took away a significant labor force and disrupted local economies.

So the correct answer should be B. But let me think again. The passage mentions that capitalists extended their exploitation from Europe to cover all of Africa. The initial exploitation in Africa during 1450-1750 was through the slave trade and extracting resources without fully colonizing the interior. So the expansion of the African diaspora to the New World is a direct result of this exploitation.

Therefore, the answer is B.

The passage by Walter Rodney focuses on European exploitation of Africa, particularly through imperialism and capitalism, which drained African wealth and hindered development. During the period of 1450 to 1750 C.E., the primary form of this exploitation was the transatlantic slave trade, which led to the expansion of the African diaspora to the New World. This process disrupted African societies and economies, aligning with Rodney's argument about the roots of African underdevelopment. 

Options A and C are less relevant as they pertain to later colonization and religious spread, respectively. Option D, while related to trade, does not address the direct exploitation highlighted by Rodney. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B

Answer: B
