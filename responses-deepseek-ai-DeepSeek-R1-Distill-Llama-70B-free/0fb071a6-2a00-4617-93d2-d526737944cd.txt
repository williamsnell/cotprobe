Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about CPA liability, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is: To which of the following parties will a CPA be liable if the CPA fraudulently issues an unqualified opinion on a corporation's materially misstated financial statements? The options are corporate shareholders and corporate bondholders.

The options are A through J, each with different combinations of yes or no and conditions.

I remember that CPAs can be held liable under certain circumstances when they issue inaccurate or fraudulent audit opinions. I think this relates to who the CPA owes a duty to and whether those parties can claim reliance on the financial statements.

So, I recall that when a CPA is negligent, they might be liable to third parties who rely on the financial statements, like investors and creditors. But the situation here is about fraud. Fraudulent actions by the CPA might have different implications.

In general, under the Ultramares doctrine, CPAs are liable to parties they knew were going to rely on the financial statements, and for whom they had a specific duty. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, I think in cases of fraud, the rules might be different. There's something called the "fraud on the market" theory, but I'm not sure if that applies to CPAs. Or maybe it's about the duty owed to specific parties.

So, let's break it down. The CPA issued an unqualified opinion on financials that were materially misstated, and they did so fraudulently. That means the CPA knew the statements were wrong or were reckless in their audit.

Who can sue the CPA? Third parties who relied on the statements to their detriment.

Corporate shareholders: They are existing owners. Do they rely on the financial statements when making decisions? Maybe, but I think the primary liability for shareholders is when the CPA's actions cause them to buy or hold shares based on incorrect info. But I'm not sure if all shareholders can claim this or only those who purchased after the statements were issued.

Corporate bondholders: They are creditors who loan money to the corporation. They would rely on financial statements when deciding to lend money. If the statements are misstated, and the bondholders relied on them, causing them financial loss, they can probably sue.

Wait, but the key here is whether the CPA owed a duty to these parties. Under common law, the CPA's duty is typically to the client (the corporation) and to third parties who are known to rely on the statements. So, bondholders might be considered known third parties because they are directly involved in financial dealings with the company.

But for shareholders, especially existing ones, it's a bit trickier. I remember something about the "stakeholder" theory where existing shareholders might not be able to recover unless they can show the CPA knew they would rely on the statements for a specific transaction, like selling shares.

But in this case, the CPA acted fraudulently. I think that when a CPA acts with intent to defraud, the duty might extend more broadly. There's the concept of "fraud on the market," which affects all investors by artificially inflating stock prices. But I'm not certain if that's the case here.

Alternatively, under the Securities Exchange Act, certain parties might have causes of action, but that's more about the company and its officers, not the CPA directly.

Wait, but the question is about general liability, not under specific federal securities laws. So focusing on common law, if the CPA's fraudulent act causes reliance and damage, then the parties can sue.

So for the shareholders: If they bought stock after the false statements were issued and the price was inflated, they might have a claim. But if they were already shareholders, could they claim for the drop in value? I'm not sure. I think some courts have allowed existing shareholders to recover if they can show reliance on the financials in holding their shares, leading to losses when the truth comes out.

For bondholders: They would have loaned money based on the financial health of the company. If the statements were misstated, making the company appear more solvent than it was, the bondholders could claim they relied on the CPA's opinion when deciding to lend, leading to financial loss.

So, both shareholders and bondholders could potentially sue if they can show reliance and damage. But wait, the question is about whether the CPA is liable to each. So the answer would be yes to both.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Yes Yes.

Other options have conditions, like requiring knowledge of fraud (Option B), or requiring a contractual relationship (Option I), or proving reliance and loss (Options F and J).

But in the case of fraudulent issuance of an opinion, the CPA's liability is broader. Under the case law, when a CPA acts with intent to defraud, they can be held liable to any third party who relies on the statements, even if the CPA didn't have a specific relationship with them. This is sometimes referred to as the "fraud" exception to the privity rule.

So, the CPA would be liable to both shareholders and bondholders who relied on the statements and suffered losses.

So the correct answer is D: Yes Yes.

To determine the CPA's liability for fraudulently issuing an unqualified opinion on materially misstated financial statements, it is important to analyze the duty owed to third parties and the circumstances under which liability arises. 

When a CPA acts fraudulently, the liability extends beyond the traditional privity of contract and can include third parties who rely on the financial statements to their detriment. This is based on the principle that fraudulent conduct by a CPA creates a broader duty to any party who reasonably relies on the misstated financial statements.

**Corporate shareholders** may have a claim if they can demonstrate reliance on the misstated financial statements, such as purchasing or holding shares based on the inaccurate information, and subsequently suffering financial losses. Similarly, **corporate bondholders**, who rely on financial statements to assess the creditworthiness of the corporation before lending money, can also sue if they suffered losses due to the misstatements.

The key distinction here is that fraudulent conduct by the CPA eliminates the need to prove a direct contractual relationship or specific knowledge of reliance. Instead, liability arises from the CPA's intentional or reckless behavior, which creates a duty to any third party who reasonably relies on the financial statements.

Given this analysis, the CPA would be liable to both corporate shareholders and corporate bondholders who can demonstrate reliance and financial loss. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: Yes Yes

Answer: D
