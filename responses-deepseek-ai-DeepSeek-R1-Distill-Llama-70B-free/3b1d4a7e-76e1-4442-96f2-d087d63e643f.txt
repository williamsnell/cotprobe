Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer, and I need to figure out how much heat the air picks up per hour. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

Alright, the question says that air is passing over a flat hot plate. They give me the temperatures of the air and the plate, the dimensions of the plate, and the velocity of the air. I need to find the heat quantity per hour. 

Wait, I remember that when a fluid flows over a surface, you can calculate the heat transfer using convection. Oh right, Newton's Law of Cooling. But wait, Newton's Law is about the rate of cooling, which is the same as the heat transfer rate. The formula is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convection heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

But wait, I don't have the value of h here. Oh, right, maybe I can find it using some correlation. For flow over a flat plate, I think the convection coefficient depends on the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number. Oh, but wait, without knowing the properties of air, like kinematic viscosity and thermal conductivity, I can't calculate h directly. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the fluid properties, so maybe it's expecting me to use a standard value. Or perhaps it's using the formula for forced convection over a flat plate, which has a specific average Nusselt number.

The Nusselt number (Nu) is given by something like Nu = 0.037 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33 for a turbulent flow, where Re is the Reynolds number. But again, without knowing viscosity or thermal conductivity, I can't compute Re or Pr.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects me to assume a value for h. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, like considering the heat capacity of the air and the flow rate.

Wait, another approach: the heat gained by the air should equal the heat lost by the plate. So maybe I can compute the mass flow rate of air and use the specific heat to find the heat transfer.

Let me think. The mass flow rate (m_dot) is density (rho) * velocity (V) * area (A). But I don't have the density of air. Oh wait, at standard conditions, the density of air is about 0.076 lbm/ft³, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Also, the specific heat of air is around 0.24 Btu/lbm-°F.

Wait, maybe I can find the volumetric flow rate first. The plate's area would be length times width. So A = 1.5 ft * 2.5 ft = 3.75 ft². The velocity is 15 ft/s. So the volumetric flow rate is A * V = 3.75 * 15 = 56.25 ft³/s.

Wait, converting that to per hour: 56.25 ft³/s * 3600 s/hr = 202,500 ft³/hr. Okay.

Now, the mass flow rate m_dot is rho * Volumetric flow rate. If rho is 0.076 lbm/ft³, then m_dot = 0.076 * 202500 = let's calculate that. 0.076 * 200,000 is 15,200, and 0.076 * 2,500 is 190, so total around 15,390 lbm/hr.

The temperature difference ΔT is 150°F - 50°F = 100°F. The specific heat c_p is 0.24 Btu/lbm-°F. So the heat transfer rate Q is m_dot * c_p * ΔT.

Plugging in the numbers: 15,390 lbm/hr * 0.24 Btu/lbm°F * 100°F.

Wait, 15,390 * 0.24 = let's compute that. 15,000 * 0.24 is 3,600. 390 * 0.24 is about 93.6. So total is 3,693.6. Then multiply by 100°F gives 369,360 Btu/hr. That seems way too high, and none of the options are anywhere near that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, maybe the density is different. I assumed 0.076 lbm/ft³ at standard conditions, but if the air is at 50°F, which is higher than standard temperature (maybe 60°F or so?), then the density would be lower. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the density at the film temperature. The film temperature is the average of the air and plate temperatures: (50 + 150)/2 = 100°F. 

The density of air at 100°F can be found using the ideal gas law. At standard pressure, the density of dry air is roughly inversely proportional to absolute temperature. Standard temperature is 60°F, which is 520°R. At 100°F (460 + 100 = 560°R), the density would be (520/560) times standard density. So 0.076 lbm/ft³ * (520/560) ≈ 0.076 * 0.9286 ≈ 0.0706 lbm/ft³.

Let me recalculate with this value. m_dot = 0.0706 lbm/ft³ * 202,500 ft³/hr = 0.0706 * 202500 ≈ let's compute 0.07 * 202500 = 14,175, and 0.0006 *202500=121.5, so total ≈14,296.5 lbm/hr.

Then Q = m_dot * c_p * ΔT = 14,296.5 * 0.24 * 100. Let's compute 14,296.5 *0.24. 14,000 *0.24=3,360. 296.5 *0.24≈71.16. So total ≈3,431.16 Btu/hr. Hmm, still way higher than any of the options, which are in the hundreds or low thousands. So I'm definitely missing something.

Wait, maybe the area I'm using is incorrect. The plate's dimensions are 1.5 ft by 2.5 ft, so area is 3.75 ft². But in convection, the area is the surface area in contact with the fluid, which for a flat plate would be length times width, which I did. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the question is expecting a different approach, like using the convection heat transfer coefficient and the area.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer in air, with a given h value. But without h provided, I'm stuck. Maybe the problem expects me to use an empirical formula or a standard h value for air flowing over a flat plate.

Wait, I recall that for air at moderate velocities (like around 10-15 ft/s), the convection coefficient h is around 2-5 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. But I'm not certain. Let's say I use h=2. Then compute Q.

Area A = 3.75 ft². ΔT=100°F. So Q=h*A*ΔT=2*3.75*100 = 750 Btu/hr. Looking at the options, option H is 750. But wait, I'm not sure if h is 2. Maybe it's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the Reynolds number to find h more accurately. Let's try that.

The Reynolds number Re is (velocity * length)/kinematic viscosity. The characteristic length for a flat plate is the length in the direction of flow. Wait, the plate is 1.5 ft long and 2.5 ft wide. So which is the length in the flow direction? The problem doesn't specify, but I think the length is the dimension along the flow. Hmm, but the problem doesn't say whether the air flows along the length or the width. Oh, wait, the question says the plate is flat and the air is passing over it, so probably the length is the direction of flow, so L=1.5 ft.

Wait, no, sometimes in these problems, the length is the length in the flow direction, and the width is across. But the problem doesn't specify. Oh wait, the plate's dimensions are length 1.5 ft and width 2.5 ft. So assuming the air flows along the length, so L=1.5 ft.

The kinematic viscosity of air at around 100°F (film temperature) is needed. At 100°F, which is 560 R, the viscosity of air is approximately 0.0000171 lbm/ft·s (I think at 60°F it's around 0.0000161, so at 100°F, it's a bit higher). Alternatively, maybe I should look up or recall the kinematic viscosity. Let me think: kinematic viscosity ν = μ/ρ. At 100°F, μ for air is about 0.000044 lbm/(ft·hr), wait no, that's probably in different units. Wait, maybe I should convert units correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that at 20°C (about 70°F), ν for air is about 0.0000159 ft²/s. At higher temperatures, ν increases. Maybe at 100°F, ν is around 0.0000175 ft²/s.

So Re = (V * L) / ν = (15 ft/s * 1.5 ft) / 0.0000175 ft²/s.

Calculating numerator: 15 *1.5=22.5. Denominator: 0.0000175.

So Re = 22.5 / 0.0000175 ≈ 1,285,714. So Re is about 1.285 million, which is well into the turbulent flow regime.

The Nusselt number for a flat plate in turbulent flow (Re > 5e5) is given by Nu = 0.037 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33. The Prandtl number for air is around 0.7.

So Nu = 0.037 * (1.285e6)^0.8 * (0.7)^0.33.

Let me compute each part.

First, (1.285e6)^0.8. Let's compute log(1.285e6)= log(1.285) + 6*log(10)= 0.1098 + 6*1=6.1098. 0.8 * 6.1098=4.8878. So antilog is 10^4.8878 ≈ 77000.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 1e6^0.8 = (1e6)^(0.8) = (1e6)^(4/5) = (1e6^(1/5))^4. 1e6^(1/5)=10^(6/5)=10^1.2≈15.8489. So (15.8489)^4 ≈ (15^4)=50625, but 15.8489 is a bit higher. Let me compute 15.8489^2=251.19, then squared again: (251.19)^2 ≈ 63,100. So 1e6^0.8≈63,095. But our Re is 1.285e6, which is 1.285 times that. So (1.285e6)^0.8= (1e6 *1.285)^0.8= (1e6)^0.8 * (1.285)^0.8. We know (1e6)^0.8≈63,100. Now, (1.285)^0.8: log(1.285)=0.1098, 0.8*0.1098=0.0878. 10^0.0878≈1.228. So (1.285)^0.8≈1.228. So total ≈63100 *1.228≈77,600.

Then, 0.037 *77,600= approx 0.037 *7.76e4= 2872. Plus, multiply by Pr^0.33. Pr=0.7, so 0.7^0.33. Let's compute ln(0.7)= -0.35667. Multiply by 0.33: -0.1177. Exponentiate: e^(-0.1177)= approx 0.889. So Pr^0.33≈0.889.

So Nu≈2872 *0.889≈2555.

Now, Nu is h * L / k, where k is thermal conductivity. So h = Nu * k / L.

We need k for air at 100°F. Thermal conductivity of air at around 100°F is about 0.015 Btu·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹.

So h = 2555 * 0.015 / 1.5 ft.

Calculate numerator: 2555 *0.015 = 38.25.

Divide by 1.5: 38.25 /1.5 =25.5 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

So h is about 25.5.

Wait, that seems high. Did I make a mistake? Let me check the steps.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the units. Let me double-check the kinematic viscosity. At 100°F (about 38°C), ν for air is around 0.0000172 m²/s. Wait, no, that's in SI units. Converting to ft²/s: 1 m²/s = 10.7639 ft²/s. So 0.0000172 m²/s = 0.0000172 *10.7639 ≈ 0.000185 ft²/s. Wait, that's much bigger than what I used earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake in the value of ν.

Wait no, wait. I think I'm getting confused between m²/s and ft²/s. Let me clarify.

At 20°C, ν for air is about 1.5e-5 m²/s. At higher temperatures, it increases. So at 100°F (about 38°C), ν is around 1.8e-5 m²/s. Converting that to ft²/s: 1 m² = 10.76391 ft², so 1 m²/s = 10.76391 ft²/s. So 1.8e-5 m²/s = 1.8e-5 *10.76391 ≈ 0.0001938 ft²/s.

So correct ν is approximately 0.0001938 ft²/s.

Now recalculate Re: V=15 ft/s, L=1.5 ft.

Re = (15 * 1.5) / 0.0001938 = 22.5 / 0.0001938 ≈ 116,124.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So Re is about 116,124, which is in the turbulent regime.

Now compute Nu. For Re=1.16e5, which is above the 5e5? Wait no, 1.16e5 is 116,000, which is below 500,000, so it's in the transitional or lower turbulent range. So perhaps the earlier correlation I used (Nu=0.037 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33) is still applicable, but maybe the exponent changes slightly.

Wait, I think the formula Nu=0.037 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33 applies for Re>5e5. For lower Re, maybe the exponent is different. Alternatively, maybe use a different formula, like Nu=0.664 Re^0.5 Pr^0.33 for laminar flow, but since Re here is 1.16e5, it's turbulent.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for mixed flow. Or maybe I should use a more accurate approach, but maybe I can proceed with the same formula.

So with Re=1.16e5, Nu=0.037*(1.16e5)^0.8 * (0.7)^0.33.

Compute (1.16e5)^0.8: Let me take natural logs. ln(1.16e5)= ln(116000)= ln(116)+ln(1000)=4.745+6.908=11.653. Multiply by 0.8: 9.3224. Exponentiate: e^9.3224≈ 10,700.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 1.16e5 = 116,000.

So 116,000^0.8 = e^(0.8 * ln(116000)).

ln(116000) ≈ ln(1.16e5) = ln(1.16) + ln(1e5) = 0.1484 + 11.5129 ≈ 11.6613.

Multiply by 0.8: 9.329.

e^9.329 ≈ e^9 * e^0.329 ≈ 8103 * 1.389 ≈ 11,260.

Wait, but that's too high. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 116,000^0.8.

Wait, 10^0.8= about 6.3096. So 116,000=1.16e5=1.16 *1e5.

So (1.16e5)^0.8 = (1.16)^0.8 * (1e5)^0.8.

(1e5)^0.8= (1e5)^(4/5)= (1e5^(1/5))^4. 1e5^(1/5)=10^(5/5)=10^1=10. So (10)^4=10,000.

(1.16)^0.8: Let's compute log(1.16)=0.0645. 0.8*0.0645=0.0516. 10^0.0516≈1.127.

So (1.16e5)^0.8≈1.127 *10,000=11,270.

Then, Nu=0.037 *11,270 * (0.7)^0.33.

Compute 0.7^0.33. Let me compute ln(0.7)= -0.35667. Multiply by 0.33: -0.1177. e^-0.1177≈0.889.

So Nu=0.037 *11,270 *0.889 ≈ 0.037 *10,000=370, but more accurately: 0.037 *11270=416.99, then
