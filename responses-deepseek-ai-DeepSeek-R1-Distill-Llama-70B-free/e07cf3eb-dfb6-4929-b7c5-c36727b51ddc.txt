Okay, I need to figure out which statements about ARCH(q) and GARCH(1,1) models are true. Let me start by recalling what I know about these models.

So, ARCH stands for Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. The ARCH(q) model specifically uses past squared returns (like lagged values) to forecast the current variance. GARCH(1,1) stands for Generalized ARCH, which includes both lagged variances and squared returns. 

Looking at the statements:

i) The ARCH(q) model is likely to be the more parsimonious.

Hmm, parsimonious means using fewer parameters. ARCH(q) has q parameters for the lagged squared terms. GARCH(1,1) has two parameters: one for the lagged variance (the GARCH term) and one for the lagged squared return (the ARCH term), plus the constant. So, if q is greater than 2, GARCH would be more parsimonious. But if q is 1, for example, GARCH(1,1) would have more parameters. Wait, wait, but the question is comparing them in general. Oh wait, the GARCH model often requires fewer parameters because it can capture long-term dependencies with just a couple of terms instead of many lags. So statement i might be false because GARCH is usually more parsimonious than ARCH(q), which might require many lags. Wait, but the statement says ARCH(q) is more parsimonious. I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. Parsimonious means fewer parameters. ARCH(q) can have a lot of parameters if q is large. GARCH(1,1) has only two parameters beyond the mean equation. So if someone uses an ARCH model with many lags, like q=5, that's six parameters (including the constant), whereas GARCH(1,1) uses three. So GARCH is more parsimonious. So statement i is false because GARCH is more parsimonious, not ARCH(q). So i is incorrect.

ii) The ARCH(q) model is more likely to violate non-negativity constraints.

Non-negativity constraints ensure that the variance is always positive. In ARCH(q), each coefficient must satisfy certain conditions. If the sum of the coefficients is too large or negative, the model might not maintain positive variance. GARCH(1,1) has an additional term (the lagged variance), which helps in maintaining positivity more easily. So I think ARCH(q) is more likely to run into non-negativity issues because it only uses squared returns, whereas GARCH includes the previous variance as well. So statement ii is true.

iii) The ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. The ARCH(q) model explicitly includes q lags. It can't have an infinite number. But GARCH models, through the recursive structure, can capture the effect of an infinite number of past squared returns because each term depends on the previous variance, which in turn depends on even earlier terms. So statement iii is false because it's the GARCH model, not ARCH(q), that allows for an infinite number of lags. So iii is incorrect.

iv) The GARCH(1,1) model will usually be sufficient to capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance.

Yes, I remember that GARCH(1,1) is commonly used because it's often adequate to model the volatility clustering in most financial time series. It captures both short-term effects (through the ARCH term) and longer-term effects (through the GARCH term). So statement iv is true.

So, evaluating each statement:

i) False
ii) True
iii) False
iv) True

Wait wait, earlier I thought statement i was false because GARCH is more parsimonious. So statement i claims that ARCH(q) is more parsimonious, which is incorrect. So i is false.

So the correct statements are ii and iv, and iv is correct. But looking back, wait, let me check.

Wait, I thought statement iv is correct. So, which options include ii and iv?

Looking at the options:

Option A: (ii), (iii), (iv) only → includes iii which I thought was false.

Option B: (iii) and (iv) only → iii is false.

Option C: All four → no.

Option D: (i), (iii), (iv) → i and iii are false.

Option E: (ii) and (iii) → iii is false.

Option F: (i), (ii), (iii) → i and iii are false.

Option G: (i) and (ii) → i is false.

Option H: (i) and (iii) → both false.

Option I: (ii) and (iv) → this matches my assessment. So ii and iv are correct.

Option J: (i) and (iv) → i is false.

So the correct answer should be option I: (ii) and (iv) only.

Wait, but earlier I thought statement iv is correct. So yes, option I is correct, which is statements ii and iv.

Wait, but let me double-check statement iv. It says the GARCH(1,1) model will usually be sufficient. Yes, that's what I was taught. So iv is correct.

So the correct statements are ii and iv, which is option I.

To determine which statements about ARCH(q) and GARCH(1,1) models are true, let us analyze each statement carefully:

1. **Statement i**: "The ARCH(q) model is likely to be the more parsimonious."  
   Parsimonious means using fewer parameters. ARCH(q) requires \( q \) parameters for the lagged squared returns, while GARCH(1,1) requires only two additional parameters (one for the lagged variance and one for the lagged squared return). GARCH(1,1) is generally more parsimonious than ARCH(q), especially when \( q \) is large. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

2. **Statement ii**: "The ARCH(q) model is more likely to violate non-negativity constraints."  
   Non-negativity constraints ensure that the conditional variance remains positive. ARCH(q) relies solely on lagged squared returns, making it more susceptible to violating these constraints compared to GARCH(1,1), which includes a lagged variance term that helps maintain positivity. Thus, this statement is **true**.

3. **Statement iii**: "The ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance."  
   This is incorrect because ARCH(q) explicitly includes only \( q \) lags of squared returns. It is the GARCH model, through its recursive structure, that can capture the effects of an infinite number of past squared returns. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

4. **Statement iv**: "The GARCH(1,1) model will usually be sufficient to capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance."  
   GARCH(1,1) is widely used because it effectively captures both short-term and long-term dependencies in the conditional variance. It is often sufficient for modeling volatility clustering in financial time series. Thus, this statement is **true**.

### Conclusion:
The correct statements are **ii** and **iv**. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**I: (ii) and (iv) only**
