Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Steven Fox is a salesman, and he earns money in two ways: a fixed amount per vacuum cleaner he sells and a commission on accessories and supplies. The question is asking for his total income for the month.

First, I need to break down the information given. He sells 14 cleaners. For each cleaner, he gets $32.50. So, the first part of his income is 14 multiplied by $32.50. Let me calculate that. 14 times 32.50... Hmm, 10 times 32.50 is 325, and 4 times 32.50 is 130, so 325 + 130 is 455. So, he makes $455 from the vacuum cleaners.

Next, he also sells $237.40 worth of accessories and supplies. But he doesn't get all of that; he gets a 25% commission on it. Commission means he takes a percentage of the total sales. So, 25% of 237.40. To find 25%, I can divide by 4 because 25% is a quarter. Let's see, 237.40 divided by 4. 200 divided by 4 is 50, and 37.40 divided by 4 is 9.35. So 50 + 9.35 is 59.35. So his commission is $59.35.

Now, to find his total income, I need to add the money from the cleaners and the commission. So that's 455 plus 59.35. Let me add that up. 455 plus 50 is 505, and then plus 9.35 is 514.35. So his total income is $514.35.

Looking at the options, option A is $514.35. So the correct answer should be A.

To calculate Steven Fox's total income for the month, we sum his earnings from two sources: 

1. **Commission from vacuum cleaners**:  
   He sold 14 cleaners at $32.50 each.  
   \( 14 \times 32.50 = 455.00 \).

2. **Commission from accessories and supplies**:  
   He sold $237.40 worth, earning a 25% commission.  
   \( 0.25 \times 237.40 = 59.35 \).

Adding these together:  
\( 455.00 + 59.35 = 514.35 \).

The total income is $514.35, which corresponds to **option A**.

Answer: A
