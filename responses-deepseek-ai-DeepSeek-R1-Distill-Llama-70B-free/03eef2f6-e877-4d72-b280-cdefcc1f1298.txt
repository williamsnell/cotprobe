Okay, so I've got this question about where the concept of 'natural law' first appeared. The options are the French Revolution, American War of Independence, Roman Law, or Greek Thinking. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that natural law has something to do with the idea that there are certain rights or principles that are inherent and universal, not made by humans. Like, they exist naturally and are discoverable through reason. I think this idea has been around for a long time.

The question is about where it first appeared. So I need to trace it back to its origins. I know that in the Enlightenment period, which influenced both the French and American revolutions, natural law was a big deal. Thinkers like John Locke talked about life, liberty, and property being natural rights. But wait, that's probably not where it started. Those revolutions were products of earlier ideas.

Roman Law—now, I recall that the Romans had a concept called "jus naturale." Wasn't that related to natural law? Roman jurists like Cicero discussed natural law, saying it's based on human nature and applies to everyone. So maybe Roman Law is a candidate.

But then there's Greek Thinking. Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Plato had ideas about natural justice or what's right by nature. For example, Aristotle talked about natural justice being universal. Plato discussed the idea of a higher law that's based on reason and nature. So the Greeks were probably earlier than the Romans in developing these ideas.

Wait, but the term "natural law" as a concept—I think the Greeks didn't use the exact term but had the ideas. The Romans might have formalized it more. Or maybe it's the other way around.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about when each option was in time. Greek Thinking would be around 5th century BCE and earlier. Roman Law came later, maybe around the time of the Roman Republic and Empire, so maybe 1st century BCE to a few centuries CE. So the Greeks were earlier.

But wait, another angle: the Stoics, who were Greek and then Roman, had a big influence on natural law. They believed in a universal natural law that applies to all humans. So Stoicism, which began in Greece around 300 BCE, might have been where the idea started to take shape more clearly.

So putting it all together, the concept of natural law probably originated in Greek Thinking, with philosophers like Plato and Aristotle laying the groundwork, and then the Stoics developing it further. The Romans later adopted and expanded upon it in their legal theories.

So looking back at the options, the answer would be D: Greek Thinking.

The idea of 'natural law' can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy, where thinkers like Plato and Aristotle discussed concepts of natural justice and universal principles based on human nature. The Stoics further developed these ideas, emphasizing a universal natural law applicable to all humans. While Roman Law later formalized and expanded on these concepts, the origins of natural law are rooted in Greek Thinking.
