Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about oil flowing through a pipe. The flow is laminar, which I remember means it's smooth and orderly, not turbulent. The pipe has an inside diameter of half an inch, and the oil is flowing at a rate of 6 gallons per minute. They're asking four questions: pressure loss per foot, velocity at the center, shear stress at the wall, and the radial position where velocity equals average velocity. Oh, and they give the density and viscosity of the oil: density is 60 lb/ft³ and viscosity is 0.2016 lbm/ft-s.

Hmm, I think I need to use Poiseuille's law here because it's for laminar flow in a pipe. Poiseuille's equation relates the flow rate to the pressure gradient, viscosity, and pipe dimensions. The equation I remember is Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 η L), where Q is flow rate, r is radius, ΔP is pressure drop, η is viscosity, and L is length. But wait, I need to make sure all units are consistent.

Wait, the flow rate is given in gallons per minute, and the pipe diameter is in inches. I'll need to convert these to consistent units, probably to feet and seconds since viscosity is given in lbm/ft-s and density in lb/ft³.

Let me jot down the given data:

Flow rate Q = 6 gal/min
Pipe diameter d = 0.5 inches → radius r = 0.25 inches
Density ρ = 60 lb/ft³
Viscosity μ = 0.2016 lbm/ft-s

First, I'll convert Q to cubic feet per second because I think the units for Poiseuille's law are in feet and seconds.

Wait, how do I convert 6 gal/min to ft³/s? Let me think. I know that 1 gallon is 0.133681 cubic feet, and 1 minute is 60 seconds.

So, 6 gal/min * 0.133681 ft³/gal = 0.802086 ft³/min. Then divide by 60 to get per second: 0.802086 /60 ≈ 0.013369 ft³/s.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that accurately:

6 * 0.133681 = 0.802086 ft³ per minute. Divided by 60 is approximately 0.013369 ft³/s.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because 6 gal/min is a volumetric flow rate, and Poiseuille's equation uses Q as the volumetric flow rate. So yeah, that's correct.

Next, the radius of the pipe. The diameter is 0.5 inches, so radius is 0.25 inches. I need to convert that to feet because the other units are in feet.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 0.25 inches is 0.25/12 = 0.0208333 feet.

Now, applying Poiseuille's equation: Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 μ L)

Wait, but wait. The pressure drop ΔP is per unit length L. Since the question asks for the pressure lost per foot length, I can set L = 1 foot.

So, rearranging the equation to solve for ΔP (pressure drop per foot):

ΔP = (8 μ L Q) / (π r^4 )

Substituting the values:

μ = 0.2016 lbm/ft-s
L = 1 ft
Q = 0.013369 ft³/s
r = 0.0208333 ft

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔP = (8 * 0.2016 * 1 * 0.013369) / (π * (0.0208333)^4 )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 8 * 0.2016 = 1.6128. Then 1.6128 * 0.013369 ≈ 0.02156.

Wait, let me compute accurately:

8 * 0.2016 = 1.6128.

1.6128 * 0.013369:

Let me compute 1.6128 * 0.013369:

0.013369 * 1.6128.

Let me compute 0.013369 * 1.6128:

0.013369 * 1 = 0.013369

0.013369 * 0.6128 ≈ let's see, 0.013369 * 0.6 = 0.0080214, 0.013369 * 0.0128 ≈ 0.0001709.

Adding together: 0.013369 + 0.0080214 = 0.0213904 + 0.0001709 ≈ 0.0215613.

So numerator is approximately 0.0215613.

Denominator is π * (0.0208333)^4.

Compute (0.0208333)^4:

First compute (0.0208333)^2 = (approx) 0.0003472.

Then square that: (0.0003472)^2 = approx 1.2048e-7.

Wait, let me compute accurately:

0.0208333^2 = (0.0208333) * (0.0208333) = 0.00043402778.

Then, (0.00043402778)^2 = (approx) 1.883e-7.

So denominator is π * 1.883e-7 ≈ 5.924e-7.

Wait, let me compute 0.0208333^4:

0.0208333^2 = (1/48)² = 1/(48²) = 1/2304 ≈ 0.000434027778.

Then 0.000434027778^2 = (4.34027778e-4)^2 = (4.34027778e-4)^2 = approx (4.34e-4)^2 = 1.883e-7.

So π * 1.883e-7 ≈ 5.923e-7.

So denominator is ~5.923e-7.

Now, ΔP = numerator / denominator = 0.0215613 / 5.923e-7 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0215613 / 5.923e-7 = ?

Well, 5.923e-7 is 0.0000005923.

So 0.0215613 / 0.0000005923 ≈ Let me compute this division.

Hmm, 0.02156 / 0.0000005923 ≈ 0.02156 / 5.923e-7 ≈ (2.156e-2) / (5.923e-7) ≈ (2.156 /5.923 ) * 1e5.

2.156 /5.923 ≈ approximately 0.3638.

So 0.3638e5 → 36380.

Wait, that can't be right, because I think I made a miscalculation. Let me try this another way.

Alternatively, compute 0.0215613 / 5.923e-7.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1e-7: (0.0215613 / 1e-7) / (5.923e-7 / 1e-7) ) → 215613 / 5.923 ≈ ?

Compute 215613 ÷ 5.923.

Well, 5.923 * 36,380 = 5.923 * 36,380.

Wait, wait, 5.923 * 36,380 = 5.923 * 3.638e4.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 5.923 × 36,380 → but that's getting messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Wait, 5.923 × 36,000 = 213,180.

5.923 × 380 = approximately 2,251.

So 36,380 *5.923 ≈ 36,000 *5.923 = 213,180, plus 380 *5.923 ≈ 2,251 → total 215,431.

Which is close to 215,613.

So 36,380 → gives approx 215,431. The target is 215,613.

So the difference is 215613-215431=182.

So 182/5.923 ≈ 30.73.

So total is approximately 36,380 +30.73=36,410.73.

So ΔP ≈ 36,410.73 lb/ft² per foot? That seems way too high. But wait, that can't be right because the options are in the thousands, like 1,075 to 1,250 lb per ft² per foot.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me re-examine.

Wait, Q is in ft³/s, correct? Yes, 0.013369 ft³/s.

r is in feet: 0.0208333 ft, correct.

μ is in lbm/ft-s, correct.

Ah, wait, I think I might have used the wrong formula. Because I recall that for Poiseuille's Law, the units can sometimes be tricky. Let me make sure that the units are consistent.

Wait, another thought: The pressure drop in Poiseuille's equation is in force per area, which is pounds per square foot (lb/ft²), but wait, in the imperial system, pressure is lb-force per square inch (psi), but here the options are in lb/ft² per foot.

Wait, but that's okay. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, denominator is π * (0.0208333)^4.

Wait, 0.0208333 ft is 0.25 inches. So (0.25/12) ft.

Wait, 0.25/12 = 0.0208333... ft. Correct.

(0.0208333)^4: Let me compute this again.

0.0208333^2 = approx 0.000434028.

Then, 0.000434028 squared is (4.34028e-4)^2 = 1.883e-7.

So denominator is π * 1.883e-7 ≈ 5.923e-7.

Numerator: 8 * μ * Q → 8 * 0.2016 lbm/ft-s * 0.013369 ft³/s.

Wait, 8 * 0.2016 = 1.6128.

1.6128 * 0.013369 ≈ let me compute accurately:

1.6128 * 0.013369.

Let me do it step by step:

1.6128 * 0.01 = 0.016128

1.6128 * 0.003369 = ?

Compute 1.6128 * 0.003 = 0.0048384.

1.6128 * 0.000369 = approximately 0.000595.

Adding those together: 0.0048384 + 0.000595 = 0.0054334.

So total numerator is 0.016128 + 0.0054334 = 0.0215614.

So numerator is 0.0215614 lbm/(ft-s) * ft³/s → Wait, the units would be lbm/(ft·s) * ft³/s.

Wait, lbm is a mass unit, but in the imperial system, pressure is in lb-force per area. So perhaps I need to account for the conversion factor between lbm and lbf.

Ah, right, I think I missed that. Because in the imperial system, you can't directly equate mass and force without considering g_c, the gravitational conversion factor. Because F = m*a, and a is in ft/s². So 1 lbm * g_c (32.174 lbm-ft/lbf-s²) gives units of force.

Wait, so in the equation, when using imperial units, the viscosity term would have units of lbm/ft-s, but when multiplied by other terms, you need to include the conversion factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the units in Poiseuille's equation to make sure everything's correct.

The general form of Poiseuille's Law is Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 μ L).

In SI units, Q is in m³/s, r in meters, ΔP in Pa (N/m²), μ in Pa·s, and L in meters. But in imperial, the units are a bit trickier.

So, in imperial units, the pressure drop ΔP would be in lb/ft², Q in ft³/s, r in ft, μ in lbm/ft·s, and L in ft.

Wait, but when I use the formula, the units must balance out. Let me check the units:

[Q] = ft³/s

[π r^4] = ft^4

[ΔP] = lb/ft²

[8 μ L] = (lbm/ft·s) * ft → lbm/(ft·s) * ft = lbm/s.

Wait, so the equation has (π r^4 ΔP)/(8 μ L) → (ft^4 * lb/ft²) / (lbm/s).

Which is (ft^2 * lb) / (lbm/s) → (ft² lb s) / lbm.

But Q is in ft³/s, so the units don't match. Hmm, that indicates I'm missing a conversion factor.

Ah, I think I remember that in the imperial system, you need to include the specific weight or use the conversion factor g_c, which is 32.174 lbm-ft/lbf-s².

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes the specific weight, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to rederive the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct form of Poiseuille's Law in imperial units is:

ΔP = (8 μ Q L) / (π ρ g_c r^4 )

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe I should use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is:

ΔP = (8 μ L Q) / (π r^4 )

But then considering the units, because in the imperial system, the units don't directly match without the conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

ΔP (lb/ft²) = (8 * μ (lbm/ft-s) * Q (ft³/s) * L (ft)) / (π * r^4 (ft^4)) * (1/g_c)

Because without the conversion factor, the units don't balance. Let me think about the units again.

The term (8 μ Q L) has units:

μ: lbm/(ft·s)

Q: ft³/s

L: ft

So, μ * Q * L → (lbm/(ft·s)) * (ft³/s) * ft → lbm * ft³/(s² * ft) → lbm * ft²/(s²).

Then, dividing by (π r^4): which is in ft^4.

So the denominator is π r^4 → ft^4.

Thus, the entire expression without any conversion factor would have units:

(lbm * ft²/s²) / ft^4 → lbm/(ft² s²).

To get pressure in lb/ft², we need to convert lbm to lbf. Since 1 lbm = 1/g_c lbf, because F = m a, and a = g = 32.174 ft/s², so 1 lbm = 1/32.174 lbf·s²/ft.

Wait, maybe I should multiply by the conversion factor g_c to account for the units.

So perhaps the correct expression is:

ΔP = (8 μ Q L) / (π r^4 ) * (1/g_c)

Because without that, the units wouldn't make sense. Let's test this.

Including 1/g_c, which is in lbm-ft/(lbf-s²).

So:

(8 μ Q L) → (lbm/(ft·s)) * (ft³/s) * ft → lbm * ft³/(s² * ft) → lbm * ft²/(s²).

Divide by (π r^4) → ft^4.

Multiply by 1/g_c → (lbm-ft)/(lbf-s²).

So overall units:

(lbm * ft²/s²) / (ft^4) ) * (lbm-ft)/(lbf-s²) ) 

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula in imperial units is:

ΔP = (8 μ Q L) / (π ρ r^4 g_c )

Because then, the units would involve density ρ in lbm/ft³, and g_c.

Wait, let's see:

μ: lbm/(ft·s)

Q: ft³/s

L: ft

ρ: lbm/ft³

g_c: lbm-ft/(lbf-s²)

So numerator: 8 μ Q L → (lbm/(ft·s)) * (ft³/s) * ft → lbm * ft³/(s² * ft) → lbm * ft²/(s²).

Denominator: π ρ r^4 g_c → (lbm/ft³) * ft^4 * (lbm-ft/(lbf-s²)).

Wait, that seems more complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the viscosity from lbm/ft-s to lbf-s/ft². Since 1 lbm = 1/g_c lbf·s²/ft, so 1 lbm/ft-s = (1/g_c) lbf·s/ft².

So, μ in lbf·s/ft² would be μ * (1/g_c).

So, let me compute that.

Given μ is 0.2016 lbm/ft-s.

So, 0.2016 lbm/ft-s = 0.2016 / 32.174 lbm/(ft-s) * (lbf-s²/ft) / lbm → Wait, maybe it's better to compute μ in lbf·s/ft².

Wait, 1 lbm = 1/32.174 lbf·s²/ft.

So, 1 lbm/ft-s = (1/32.174) lbf·s²/(ft * ft) ) * (1/ s) → because
