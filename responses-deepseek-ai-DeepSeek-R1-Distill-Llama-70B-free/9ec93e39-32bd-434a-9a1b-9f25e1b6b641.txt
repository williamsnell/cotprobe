Question:

Congress enacts a statute that makes Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street. Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?

Options:

A: It is invalid because it conflicts with the ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., City Council.
B: It is valid as it is within the purview of Congress's power over transportation.
C: It is invalid because the law infringes upon the rights of the residents of Washington, D.C.
D: It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.
E: It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.
F: It is invalid because it violates the Tenth Amendment.
G: It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.
H: It is valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.
I: It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.
J: It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest.

Alright, so I've got this question about the constitutionality of a federal statute versus a local ordinance. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that Congress enacted a statute making Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street. The reason was to help members of Congress avoid heavy traffic when traveling to the Capital. Before that, the Washington D.C. City Council had an ordinance making it a two-lane street. Now, the question is whether the federal statute is constitutional.

First, I need to remember the basic principles of federalism and the powers of Congress versus local governments. I recall that the District of Columbia is a federal district, not part of any state, so Congress has special authority there. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to exercise exclusive legislation over the District. This is known as the District Clause.

So, since D.C. isn't a state, the usual Tenth Amendment issues might not apply as much. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not given to the federal government to the states, but D.C. isn't a state. That makes me think that Congress's authority here is pretty broad.

Looking at the options, option G says it's valid because Congress has exclusive power over D.C. That sounds plausible. But I should check the other options to be sure.

Option A says it's invalid because it conflicts with the D.C. ordinance. But if Congress's power is exclusive, their law would preempt the local one, right? So A might not be correct.

Option B mentions Congress's transportation power. I know Congress can regulate interstate commerce, but Pennsylvania Avenue is a local street, probably not directly related to interstate commerce. Unless it's a major thoroughfare affecting commerce, but the question doesn't specify that. So B might not be the best choice.

Option C says it's invalid because it infringes on residents' rights. I don't think there's a specific constitutional right being violated here. The statute is about traffic flow, not individual rights like free speech or equal protection. So C seems unlikely.

Option D claims it's invalid due to interstate commerce discrimination. Again, unless the street directly affects interstate commerce, this doesn't apply. The statute's purpose is for Congress members, not commerce, so D might not be right.

Option E talks about the property power. The property clause allows Congress to manage federal property, but Pennsylvania Avenue isn't necessarily federal property just because it's in D.C. So E might not apply here.

Option F says it's invalid under the Tenth Amendment. But as I thought earlier, D.C. isn't a state, so the Tenth Amendment doesn't give it the same autonomy. So F is probably wrong.

Option G, again, points to Congress's exclusive power over D.C. That seems to fit because Congress can make laws for the District without interference from local ordinances. So G looks correct.

Option H mentions interstate commerce power. Unless the statute affects commerce, which it doesn't seem to, H isn't the right choice.

Option I says D.C. has exclusive power over public thoroughfares. But if Congress has exclusive authority, this isn't the case. So I is probably incorrect.

Option J suggests it's valid due to a governmental interest. While that's true, the main issue is Congress's authority, not just any governmental interest. So J is less specific than G.

Putting it all together, the best answer seems to be G because Congress's exclusive power over the District of Columbia allows it to enact such a statute, preempting the local ordinance.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a federal statute enacted by Congress designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a one-way street, which conflicts with a prior ordinance by the Washington, D.C., City Council. The key issue revolves around the scope of Congress's authority over the District of Columbia.

Under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the exclusive power to legislate for the District of Columbia. This authority, known as the District Clause, allows Congress to enact laws for the District without interference from local ordinances. Since Washington, D.C., is not a state, the Tenth Amendment, which reserves certain powers to states, does not apply. Therefore, Congress's statute would preempt the local ordinance.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Congress's exclusive power over the District allows it to preempt local ordinances, so the conflict does not invalidate the federal statute.
- **B**: Incorrect. While Congress has authority over transportation, this statute's purpose is not tied to interstate commerce or a specific federal transportation power.
- **C**: Incorrect. The statute does not infringe on individual rights protected by the Constitution.
- **D**: Incorrect. There is no indication the statute burdens interstate commerce.
- **E**: Incorrect. The statute does not involve Congress's property power, as Pennsylvania Avenue is not necessarily federal property.
- **F**: Incorrect. The Tenth Amendment does not apply to Washington, D.C., as it is not a state.
- **G**: Correct. Congress's exclusive legislative authority over the District of Columbia validates the statute and allows it to preempt the local ordinance.
- **H**: Incorrect. The statute is not based on Congress's interstate commerce power.
- **I**: Incorrect. Congress, not the D.C. City Council, has exclusive authority over public thoroughfares in the District.
- **J**: Incorrect. While the statute serves a governmental interest, the primary basis for its validity is Congress's exclusive power over the District.

The most accurate answer is **G**, as Congress's exclusive power over the District of Columbia directly supports the validity of the statute.

Answer: G
