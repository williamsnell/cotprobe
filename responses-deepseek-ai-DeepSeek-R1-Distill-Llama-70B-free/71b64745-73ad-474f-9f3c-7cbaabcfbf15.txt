Question:

Suppose that a two-stage rocket starts from rest with a mass m_1. At burn-out of the first stage engine, the mass is m_2. If the exhaust velocity is v_0, the rocket velocity after the first stage engines quit is v = v_0ln(m_1 / m_2). Before the second stage engines are ignited, part of the mass m_2 is discarded - the mass of the first stage engines. The mass of the second stage ism_Awhen the en-gines start andm_Bwhen the engines shut down. What is the terminal velocity of the second stage?

Options:

A: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 - m_2) / (m_A * m_B)]
B: v = v_0 In [(m_1 * m_2)(m_A*m_B)]
C: v = v_0 ln [(m_1^2 / m_2) * (m_A / m_B)]
D: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 * m_2) / (m_A + m_B)]
E: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 / m_2) + (m_A/m_B)]
F: v = v_0 In [(m_1 / m_2)(m_A+m_B)]
G: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 + m_2) * (m_A - m_B)]
H: v = v_0 ln [m_1 / (m_2 + m_A + m_B)]
I: v = v_0 In [(m_1 / m_2)(m_A/m_B)]
J: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 + m_2) / (m_A * m_B)]

Okay, let's tackle this rocket problem. Hmm, so it's a two-stage rocket scenario. I remember that rocket velocity depends on the mass ratio and exhaust velocity. The formula I recall is the rocket equation, which is delta v equals v0 times the natural log of (initial mass over final mass). 

So the first stage: the rocket starts with mass m1 and when the first stage burns out, the mass is m2. So the velocity after the first stage is v = v0 ln(m1/m2). Got that part.

Now, before the second stage starts, part of m2 is discarded, which is the mass of the first stage engines. Wait, so the second stage's initial mass is m_A when the engines start. When the second stage engines shut down, the mass is m_B. So the second stage's mass changes from m_A to m_B.

Wait, but what's the initial mass for the second stage? Oh, right, after the first stage, the mass is m2. Then we discard the first stage's engines, so the remaining mass is m_A. So the second stage starts with m_A and burns until m_B. So the velocity from the second stage would be v0 ln(m_A/m_B). 

But wait, the rocket is already moving at v = v0 ln(m1/m2) after the first stage. So the total velocity is the sum of the two stages' contributions. So total v_total = v0 ln(m1/m2) + v0 ln(m_A/m_B).

Factor out v0, so v_total = v0 [ln(m1/m2) + ln(m_A/m_B)].

Using logarithm properties, ln(a) + ln(b) = ln(ab), so this becomes v0 ln( (m1/m2) * (m_A/m_B) ) = v0 ln( (m1 * m_A) / (m2 * m_B) ).

Wait, but looking at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again.

Option I is v0 ln[ (m1/m2)(m_A/m_B) ) ] which is exactly what I have. So option I seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. The second stage's mass starts at m_A and ends at m_B. So the mass ratio is m_A/m_B. So yes, the velocity from the second stage is v0 ln(m_A/m_B). Adding that to the first stage's v gives the total.

Yes, so the answer should be option I.

To determine the terminal velocity of the two-stage rocket, we analyze the contributions from both stages. The rocket equation states that the velocity change for each stage is given by:

\[
\Delta v = v_0 \ln\left(\frac{\text{initial mass}}{\text{final mass}}\right).
\]

### First Stage:
- The rocket starts with mass \(m_1\) and burns out with mass \(m_2\).
- The velocity after the first stage is:
  \[
  v_1 = v_0 \ln\left(\frac{m_1}{m_2}\right).
  \]

### Second Stage:
- Before the second stage engines ignite, the mass of the first stage engines is discarded, leaving the second stage with an initial mass \(m_A\).
- The second stage burns until its mass is reduced to \(m_B\).
- The velocity contribution from the second stage is:
  \[
  v_2 = v_0 \ln\left(\frac{m_A}{m_B}\right).
  \]

### Total Velocity:
The total terminal velocity is the sum of the velocities from both stages:
\[
v_{\text{total}} = v_1 + v_2 = v_0 \ln\left(\frac{m_1}{m_2}\right) + v_0 \ln\left(\frac{m_A}{m_B}\right).
\]

Using the logarithmic property \(\ln(a) + \ln(b) = \ln(ab)\), this simplifies to:
\[
v_{\text{total}} = v_0 \ln\left(\frac{m_1}{m_2} \cdot \frac{m_A}{m_B}\right).
\]

### Matching with the Options:
The correct expression matches **Option I**, which is:
\[
v = v_0 \ln\left(\frac{m_1}{m_2} \cdot \frac{m_A}{m_B}\right).
\]

Thus, the terminal velocity of the second stage is given by **Option I**.
