Question:

Loretta Landlord owned a commercial building in a commercial strip surrounded by a residential community. One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally told Loretta the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so she was leaving. If Loretta then sued Sally for breach of the lease contract, the likely outcome is a judgment for

Options:

A: Loretta, only if she can prove that Sally knew about the upcoming law change.
B: Loretta, if she can prove that Sally intended to breach the contract from the start.
C: Sally, because the change in law was beyond her control.
D: Sally, because the law change is a valid reason for terminating the lease.
E: Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.
F: Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.
G: Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.
H: Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.
I: Sally, because the law change made the purpose of the lease void.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a lease agreement and a breach of contract. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

So, Loretta is a landlord who owns a commercial building in a residential area. She had a month-to-month tenant, a dance troop, paying $500 a month. But the director left, the troop folded, and they vacated the space. Then Sally comes along, rents the space for two years at $1000 a month without telling Loretta she plans to open a topless strip joint. 

After a month, the county passes a law banning such businesses in that neighborhood. So Sally tells Loretta the new law makes it impossible to operate, so she's leaving. Now, Loretta is suing Sally for breach of the lease. The question is who would win.

I remember that in contract law, there are certain defenses against breach, like impossibility or illegality. So, if a contract becomes impossible to perform due to unforeseen circumstances, the obligation might be discharged.

Wait, but when Sally signed the lease, she didn't disclose her intended use. So the lease was for a commercial space, but she used it for a strip joint. But then the law changed, making that use illegal. So Sally can't operate anymore.

So, the issue is whether Sally is in breach for leaving. The lease probably requires her to pay rent for the two years. But if the use becomes illegal, can she stop paying?

I think there's a concept called "impossibility of performance" which might apply here. But wait, impossibility usually applies when performance becomes physically or legally impossible. If the law makes the intended use illegal, does that make the lease impossible to perform?

Alternatively, there's the concept of frustration of purpose. That's when the main reason for the contract is destroyed, making it pointless to continue. But I think frustration is when the purpose is frustrated, but the performance is still possible. Like if you rent a space for a parade, but the parade is canceled. The space can still be used, but the main purpose is gone. So, Sally's purpose was to run a strip joint, which is now illegal. So maybe she can argue frustration of purpose.

Wait, but does the lease specify the use? If the lease didn't specify that it's for a strip joint, then Sally's use might have been a violation of the lease terms anyway. But in this case, she didn't disclose it, so maybe Loretta didn't approve it. But the question is about the law making it illegal, not about the lease terms.

Alternatively, if the law changes after the lease was signed, making the intended use illegal, does that discharge the contract? I think that's more about supervening illegality. If the government makes an action illegal after the contract was formed, that can render the contract void or voidable, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the contract here is the lease. The lease is for the space, not for the specific use. So Sally is leasing the space, and she's using it for a strip joint. If the law now prohibits that use, does that affect the lease? Or does it just make her business illegal, but she's still obligated to pay rent?

I think the lease would still be enforceable. Because the lease is about using the space, not about operating a legal business. Unless the lease had a specific use clause, Sally might be in breach for using it for an illegal purpose, but that's a separate issue.

Wait, but Sally is arguing that because the law changed, she can't operate, so she's leaving. So she's trying to get out of the lease. But the lease doesn't specify the use, so she's just a tenant. Unless the lease has a clause that ties the use to legality.

Alternatively, maybe the doctrine of impossibility applies because the intended use is now illegal, making it impossible to perform the lease as intended. But I'm not sure if that's a strong argument.

I think generally, a change in the law after the contract doesn't discharge the contract unless it specifically relates to the subject matter. For example, if the government condemns the property, that's a different story. But here, the law just prohibits the use. So Sally might still be on the hook for the lease unless she can prove impossibility.

Wait, but if the use is prohibited, then the purpose of the lease is frustrated. So maybe she can argue frustration of purpose. But I think courts are reluctant to apply that unless the purpose is completely destroyed and both parties knew it was the main reason for the contract.

In this case, Sally didn't disclose her intended use, so Loretta might not have known. So perhaps the frustration of purpose argument wouldn't hold because Loretta didn't agree to that specific use.

So, if Sally just stops paying rent, Loretta can sue for breach. Sally's defense would be that the law made it impossible for her to perform. But I'm not sure if that's a valid defense here.

Alternatively, if the law makes the use illegal, does that mean the contract is impossible to perform? Or is it just that her business is illegal, but she can still lease the space for another purpose?

Wait, the question says Sally is leaving because she can't operate the strip joint. So she's terminating the lease. The issue is whether she's in breach.

If the lease requires her to pay rent regardless of how she uses the space, then she can't just leave. Unless the law makes it impossible to perform the lease. So, if she can't use the space for any legal purpose, maybe. But she could use it for another business that's legal. So the impossibility argument might fail because she could sublease or use it for something else.

So, Sally's argument that the law made it impossible might not hold because she could use the space for another purpose. Therefore, she can't claim impossibility, so Loretta would win.

Wait, but the question is about whether the law made the lease impossible. If the lease was for a specific use that's now illegal, maybe that's different. But the lease here is general. So Sally's obligation is to pay rent, regardless of how she uses the space, unless the lease says otherwise.

So, Sally can't just stop paying because her intended use is illegal. She's still bound by the lease. Therefore, Loretta can sue for breach, and Sally has no valid defense. So the judgment would be for Loretta.

Looking at the options:

Option B says Loretta wins if she can prove Sally intended to breach from the start. But there's no indication Sally intended that; she just couldn't continue because of the law.

Option H says Loretta wins because the law was passed after the lease. That makes sense because the law change doesn't affect the existing contract.

So the correct answer is H, but wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, some might argue that the law's change made the purpose impossible, so Sally isn't liable. But I think that's not the case because the lease isn't tied to that specific use unless specified.

Wait, the lease was for two years, and the law was passed after the lease was signed. So the lease is valid, and Sally is breaching by leaving. So the outcome is a judgment for Loretta.

Looking at the options, option H says Loretta wins because the new law was passed after the lease was executed. That sounds correct because the law can't retroactively invalidate a contract unless it's about public policy or something, which I don't think applies here.

So the answer is H.

The question revolves around a lease agreement between Loretta Landlord and Sally Sleazy. Loretta leased a commercial space to Sally under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month. Sally intended to operate a topless strip joint but did not disclose this to Loretta. Shortly after opening, a new law was passed prohibiting such businesses in the neighborhood. Sally claimed the law made it impossible to operate and vacated the premises, leading Loretta to sue for breach of the lease.

Key legal principles to consider include impossibility of performance, frustration of purpose, and the enforceability of contracts despite subsequent legal changes. Impossibility of performance applies when an unforeseen event renders performance physically or legally impossible. Frustration of purpose, on the other hand, occurs when the primary purpose of the contract is destroyed, making performance pointless. However, courts are reluctant to apply frustration of purpose unless both parties were aware of and agreed to the specific purpose at the time of contracting.

In this case, the lease did not specify the intended use of the space, and Loretta was unaware of Sally's plans. While the new law prohibits topless strip joints, it does not necessarily render the lease impossible to perform, as Sally could theoretically use the space for another legal purpose. Therefore, Sally's obligation to pay rent remains unless the lease explicitly tied the use to a specific purpose.

The critical factor is that the law was passed after the lease was executed. Generally, a subsequent change in law does not retroactively invalidate a contract unless it directly affects the subject matter or violates public policy. Here, the law prohibits a specific use but does not invalidate the lease itself. Thus, Sally's decision to vacate and cease payments constitutes a breach of the lease, and Loretta is entitled to sue for damages.

Among the options provided, the most accurate is **H: Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed**. This reflects the principle that a subsequent change in law does not discharge a contract unless it directly undermines the contract's subject matter or violates public policy.

**Answer: H**
