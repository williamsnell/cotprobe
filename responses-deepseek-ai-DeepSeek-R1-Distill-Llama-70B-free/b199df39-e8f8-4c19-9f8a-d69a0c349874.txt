Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Paul owes some money with sales tax and then figure out how much he paid based on the terms given. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, the problem says Paul owed $56.30 plus a 3% sales tax. Right, so I need to calculate the sales tax first. Sales tax is a percentage of the amount owed. So 3% of 56.30. Let me compute that.

3% is 0.03 in decimal. So 56.30 multiplied by 0.03. Let me do that calculation. 56.30 * 0.03. Well, 50 * 0.03 is 1.50, and 6.30 * 0.03 is 0.189. Adding those together, 1.50 + 0.189 is 1.689. So the sales tax is $1.689.

Wait, but money is usually to two decimal places, so that would be $1.69. So the total amount Paul owes before any discounts is 56.30 plus 1.69. Let me add that. 56.30 + 1.69 equals... 56.30 + 1 is 57.30, plus 0.69 makes 57.99. So the total is $57.99 before any discounts.

Now, the terms are (2/10), (n/30). I remember that in business terms, this is read as "2% discount if paid within 10 days, net 30". So if Paul pays within 10 days, he gets a 2% discount on the total amount. Otherwise, he pays the full amount in 30 days.

The question says Paul paid one week after the agreement. One week is 7 days. So 7 days is within the 10-day window. That means he qualifies for the 2% discount.

So I need to calculate 2% of the total amount ($57.99) and subtract that from the total to find out how much Paul paid.

2% of 57.99 is 0.02 * 57.99. Let me compute that. 57.99 * 0.02. Hmm, 50 * 0.02 is 1.00, 7 * 0.02 is 0.14, 0.99 * 0.02 is 0.0198. Adding those together: 1.00 + 0.14 is 1.14 plus 0.0198 is 1.1598. So approximately $1.16.

Wait, that can't be right because 57.99 * 0.02 is 1.1598, which is about $1.16. So the discount is $1.16.

Subtracting that from the total: 57.99 - 1.16 equals 56.83. Wait, but wait, let me make sure I did that right. Because 57.99 minus 1.16: 57.99 - 1 is 56.99, minus 0.16 is 56.83.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A through J. Looking back, the options include C: $58.65, H: $58.12, and others. Hmm, $56.83 isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the discount more accurately. Let's calculate 57.99 * 0.02 exactly. 57.99 * 0.02 is 1.1598, which is $1.16 (rounded to the nearest cent). So 57.99 minus 1.16 is indeed 56.83. But none of the options match this. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total after tax. Let me double-check that. The original amount is $56.30, and the tax is 3%. So 56.30 * 1.03. Let me compute that.

56.30 * 1.03. So 56.30 * 1 is 56.30, 56.30 * 0.03 is 1.689. So adding them gives 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989, which is $57.99 when rounded to the nearest cent. So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the discount is applied correctly. Maybe the discount is applied to the original amount before tax? Wait, no, the tax is added first, and then the discount is applied on the total. Because the discount is a percentage of the total invoice amount.

Wait, another thought: maybe the discount is applied to the pre-tax amount. Let me see. If the terms are (2/10), n/30, that usually applies to the total after all charges, including tax. Because otherwise, the discount would be a bit lower.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me recompute the discount.

Total after tax is $57.99. 2% of that is 57.99 * 0.02 = 1.1598, so $1.16. So the amount paid is 57.99 - 1.16 = 56.83.

But looking at the options, I don't see 56.83. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the tax. Let me compute 56.30 * 0.03 accurately. 56 * 0.03 is 1.68, 0.30 * 0.03 is 0.009, so total is 1.68 + 0.009 = 1.689, which is 1.69. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the discount is applied on a different basis. Let me think again. The terms are 2/10, n/30. So 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 30 days.

Paul paid after 7 days, so within the discount period. So the discount applies to the total amount including tax.

Hmm. So 57.99 * 0.98 would be the amount paid, because 100% - 2% = 98%.

Let me compute 57.99 * 0.98.

57.99 * 0.98:

I can think of it as 57.99 - (57.99 * 0.02) = 57.99 - 1.1598 = 56.8302, which is $56.83 when rounded.

But looking at the options, the closest one I see is option H: $58.12. Wait, that's higher than 57.99. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me compute 57.99 * 0.98 more accurately.

Another approach: 57.99 * 0.98.

Compute 57.99 * 98 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 57.99 * 98 and then divide by 100.

57.99 * 98:

Let me compute 57.99 * 100 = 5799.00.

Subtract 57.99 * 2 = 115.98.

So 5799 - 115.98 = 5683.02.

Now divide by 100: 5683.02 /100 = 56.8302, which is $56.83.

But none of the options match this, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the discount is applied to the pre-tax amount. Let's try that.

Original amount: $56.30.

Discount is 2% of 56.30: 56.30 * 0.02 = 1.126.

So the discounted amount would be 56.30 - 1.126 = 55.174.

Then add the tax on the discounted amount? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the tax is on the total amount, which includes the discount if applicable.

Wait, perhaps the tax is applied first, then the discount. So that's what I did earlier, but it's leading to 56.83, which isn't an option.

Looking again at the options, the options given are A:57.99, B:60.35, C:58.65, D:59.50, E:57.50, F:56.86, G:54.00, H:58.12, I:55.65, J:55.17.

Hmm. So none of the options is 56.83. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the sales tax is 3%, but maybe it's applied differently. Alternatively, perhaps the terms are applied as a trade discount, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total differently. Let me try to compute the tax correctly.

Wait, 56.30 * 3% is 1.689, so total is 57.989, which is 57.99.

Then 2% discount: 57.99 * 0.02 = 1.1598, so 57.99 - 1.1598 = 56.8302.

Rounded to the nearest cent is 56.83. But that's not among the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is 56.86, which is close but not exact. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the tax is calculated on the discounted amount? No, that's not standard practice. Usually, tax is applied to the pre-discount amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the discount is 2/10, which might be 2% in 10 days, but perhaps it's a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps the discount is not 2%, but 2/10 of a dollar per something. No, I think 2/10 refers to 2% if paid in 10 days.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the calculation.

Total amount: 56.30.

Tax: 3% of 56.30 is 1.689, so total becomes 57.989.

Discount is 2% of 57.989, which is 1.15978. So the amount paid is 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922, which is $56.83 when rounded.

But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the terms are (2/10), (n/30). So maybe the discount is 2% of the invoice total, and the n/30 refers to the time.

But perhaps I should check if any of the options, when increased by 2%, would give 57.99.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's say the amount paid is X. Then X = 57.99 * (1 - 0.02) = 57.99 * 0.98 = 56.8302.

So looking for an option around 56.83. The closest is F:56.86.

Wait, 56.83 is 56.83, which is not exactly F, which is 56.86. Hmm, so perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 57.99 * 0.98 exactly.

57.99 * 0.98:

Let me compute 57.99 * 98:

57.99 * 98:

Calculate 57 * 98 = (50 *98) + (7*98) = 4900 + 686 = 5586.

Then 0.99 * 98 = 97.02.

So total is 5586 + 97.02 = 5683.02.

Now divide by 100: 5683.02 /100 = 56.8302.

So $56.83.

But the options don't have this exact amount.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the discount is applied to the pre-tax amount. Let me try that.

So the pre-tax amount is 56.30.

Discount: 56.30 * 0.02 = 1.126.

So discounted amount: 56.30 - 1.126 = 55.174.

Then add tax on this discounted amount. Wait, no, because the tax is applied on the original amount, not the discounted one. Or is it?

Wait, perhaps the tax is applied after the discount. Let me think about the order.

If the discount is applied first, then the tax is added on the discounted amount.

So:

Original amount: 56.30.

Discount: 2% of 56.30 = 1.126.

Discounted amount: 56.30 - 1.126 = 55.174.

Then tax on 55.174 at 3%: 55.174 * 0.03 = 1.65522.

Total amount: 55.174 + 1.65522 = 56.82922, which is 56.83. Same as before.

Still, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the tax is applied first, then the discount on the total.

That's what I did earlier, leading to 56.83, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me list them:

A: $57.99 → that's the total before discount.

B: $60.35 → that's higher than the total, so probably not.

C:58.65 → higher than total.

D:59.50 → higher.

E:57.50 → a bit less than 57.99.

F:56.86 → close to 56.83.

G:54.00 → too low.

H:58.12 → higher.

I:55.65 → lower.

J:55.17 → lower.

So the closest is F:56.86.

But why am I getting 56.83?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the tax differently. Let me try to compute the tax as exact as possible.

Tax is 3% of 56.30.

56.30 * 0.03 = 1.689.

So total is 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989, which is 57.99 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Then 2% discount on 57.99: 57.99 * 0.02 = 1.1598.

So the amount after discount is 57.99 - 1.1598 = 56.8302.

Rounded to the nearest cent, that's 56.83.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the tax was applied correctly. Maybe the tax is on the discounted amount.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the discount is applied first, then tax. Let me try that.

Amount:56.30.

Discount: 2% of 56.30 = 1.126.

So discounted amount: 56.30 - 1.126 = 55.174.

Tax on 55.174: 55.174 * 0.03 = 1.65522.

Total:55.174 + 1.65522 = 56.82922 → $56.83.

Again, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is applied to the tax amount.

Wait, that seems unlikely. The discount is usually applied to the total amount, including tax.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the tax as exactly as possible, without rounding.

So 56.30 * 0.03 = 1.689.

So total is 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989.

Then 2% discount: 57.989 * 0.02 = 1.15978.

Subtracting that gives 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922.

Rounded to the nearest cent is 56.83.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the answer intended is F:56.86, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the terms are (2/10), (n/30), which might mean something else. Wait, perhaps the "n" stands for "net", so it's 2% discount in 10 days, net 30. So if you don't take the discount, you pay in 30 days. If you take the discount, you pay within 10 days.

But that's what I assumed earlier. So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the discount is a trade discount or a cash discount. But in this context, it's a cash discount.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total after tax is $57.99, and I need to compute 98% of that.

So 57.99 * 0.98.

Let me compute 57.99 * 0.98:

57 * 98 = let's compute 57 * 100 = 5700, minus 57 * 2 = 114 → 5700 - 114 = 5586.

Then 0.99 * 98 = 97.02.

So total is 5586 + 97.02 = 5683.02.

Divide by 100:56.8302.

So again, 56.83.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is F:56.86, but I'm getting 56.83.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different way to compute the tax. Let me think: perhaps the tax is computed with more decimal places, leading to a slightly different amount.

Wait, let's compute the tax precisely.

56.30 * 0.03 = 1.689.

Total including tax:57.989.

Then 2% discount:57.989 * 0.02 = 1.15978.

So 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922.

Rounded to the nearest cent, it's 56.83.

Wait, perhaps the problem rounds the discount differently.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different method, such as rounding the discount to the nearest cent before subtracting.

So 57.99 * 0.02 = 1.1598 → $1.16.

Subtracting that from 57.99 gives 56.83.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps the tax is 3% on the discounted amount. Let me try that.

So original amount:56.30.

Discount:2% → 56.30 * 0.98 = 55.234.

Then tax on 55.234:55.234 * 0.03 = 1.65702.

Total:55.234 + 1.65702 = 56.89102 → $56.89.

Which is close to option F:56.86.

But 56.89 is not an option either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different order: tax first, then discount
