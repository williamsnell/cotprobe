Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says that Jess scored 18 points in her last basketball game, and each basket she made was worth 2 points. They're asking how many baskets she made. Hmm, right, so baskets in basketball are worth points, and each basket here is 2 points. So I need to find out how many times she scored 2 points to get a total of 18.

Wait, so each basket is 2 points. So if I divide the total points by the points per basket, that should give me the number of baskets. That makes sense because if each basket is 2 points, then the number of baskets multiplied by 2 gives the total points. So the reverse would be total points divided by 2.

Let me do the math. 18 points divided by 2 points per basket. 18 รท 2 equals 9. So that would mean she made 9 baskets. Let me double-check that. 9 baskets times 2 points each is 18, which matches the total points she scored. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options provided: A is 5, B is 20, C is 36, D is 6, E is 10, F is 18, G is 12, H is 9, I is 8, J is 16. So the correct answer should be H, which is 9.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I'm dividing, I might get confused. So 2 points per basket, so each basket adds 2. How many times does 2 go into 18? Well, 2 times 9 is 18. Yep, that's correct.

I think I'm confident with this. So the answer is H.

The problem asks how many baskets Jess made if each basket is worth 2 points and she scored 18 points. To find the number of baskets, divide the total points by the points per basket: 18 รท 2 = 9. Therefore, Jess made 9 baskets.

The correct answer is H.
