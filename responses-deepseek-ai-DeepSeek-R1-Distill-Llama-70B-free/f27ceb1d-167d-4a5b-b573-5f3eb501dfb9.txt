Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

After waiting in line for two hours to gain entry into a popular nightclub, a man was denied admission because his attire failed to conform to the club's dress code. When he was refused admittance, the man angrily shouted to the club's doorman, "You'll be sorry for this. After I'm through, this club will be reduced to rubble. " Later that same evening, the man returned to the club with two explosives in his possession. He noticed the defendant leaving the club and followed him into a nearby parking lot. As the defendant was about to enter his car, the man grabbed him, pointed a gun and said, "Follow me, you punk, or I'll blow your brains out. " The man led the defendant to the rear of the club, handed him the explosives, and directed him to throw them through an open window of the club. In fear of his life, the defendant tossed the explosives into the club, causing an inferno that killed 25 people. In this jurisdiction, the applicable arson statute includes all buildings. If the defendant is charged with felony murder for the death of the people in the club, he will most likely be found

Options:

A: not guilty, because he was coerced into committing the act.
B: guilty, because he did not attempt to alert authorities before throwing the explosives.
C: not guilty, because he was acting under immediate threat to his life.
D: guilty, because they were killings that occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.
E: not guilty, because the defendant was justified under the circumstances.
F: not guilty, because duress is a defense to arson.
G: guilty, as the crime was premeditated and caused multiple deaths.
H: guilty, because he physically committed the act of throwing the explosives.
I: not guilty, because he was not the primary actor in the crime.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about felony murder. Honestly, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the scenario is that a man was denied entry into a nightclub because of the dress code. He got angry and threatened the doorman, saying he'd reduce the club to rubble. Later that night, he comes back with explosives. He notices the defendant leaving the club and follows him into a parking lot. He points a gun at the defendant and tells him to follow or else he'll blow his brains out. Then, he leads the defendant to the club, hands him explosives, and tells him to throw them into the club through an open window. The defendant, fearing for his life, does so, causing a fire that kills 25 people.

Now, the question is about whether the defendant is guilty of felony murder. The jurisdiction's arson law includes all buildings. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to remember what felony murder is. From what I recall, felony murder is when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the felony is inherently dangerous. The idea is that any death during such a felony makes the participants guilty of murder, regardless of intent.

So in this case, the underlying felony would be arson, since the defendant threw explosives into the club, which is a building. Arson is a felony, and it's definitely an inherently dangerous crime because it involves fire, which can cause serious harm or death.

The defendant was coerced, though. He was threatened with a gun and feared for his life. So, does duress or coercion serve as a defense here?

I think duress can sometimes be a defense, but it has limitations. Typically, duress is a defense to crimes except for murder. But wait, felony murder is a form of murder charged under the felony murder rule, so it's a bit tricky.

Wait, but felony murder doesn't require intent to kill, only that the death happened during a felony. So even if the defendant didn't want to kill anyone, if he committed the felony (arson), and a death resulted, he could be guilty of felony murder.

But here, the defendant was forced to commit the arson. Does that affect the felony murder charge? I'm trying to remember if duress can be a defense to felony murder.

I think the general rule is that duress is not a defense to murder, including felony murder. The rationale is that allowing duress as a defense could encourage people to commit serious crimes under threat, and it's better to hold them accountable rather than risk more harm.

So even if the defendant was coerced into committing arson, once the arson is committed and people die, he could still be liable for felony murder. Because the felony (arson) is a dangerous crime, and the death is a natural consequence, his participation in the felony makes him guilty.

Looking at the options:

A: Not guilty because of coercion. But I think that's not correct because duress doesn't excuse murder.

B: Guilty because he didn't alert authorities. I don't think that's relevant. The issue is the act, not whether he alerted someone.

C: Not guilty because immediate threat. Again, I think duress isn't a defense here.

D: Guilty because during an inherently dangerous felony. This sounds right. Arson is dangerous, and deaths occurred during it.

E: Not guilty, justified. Justification usually requires more than just being threatened; perhaps self-defense, but here he was forced to commit a crime against others, so justification might not apply.

F: Not guilty because duress is a defense to arson. While duress might sometimes be a defense to the underlying felony, for felony murder, which is murder, it's probably not a defense.

G: Guilty because premeditated. Wait, but the defendant didn't plan it; the other guy did. So premeditation might not apply, but felony murder doesn't require premeditation.

H: Guilty because he threw the explosives. True, but the question is about felony murder, not the act itself.

I: Not guilty because not the primary actor. But in felony murder, all participants can be guilty, regardless of who the primary is.

So the best answer seems to be D: guilty because the killings occurred during an inherently dangerous felony.

The question revolves around whether the defendant can be convicted of felony murder after being coerced into committing arson that resulted in 25 deaths. Felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony. Here, the underlying felony is arson, which is inherently dangerous. The defendant was forced to commit the crime under duress, but duress is generally not a valid defense to murder, including felony murder. The rationale is that allowing duress to excuse such serious crimes could undermine accountability and public safety. Therefore, despite the coercion, the defendant's participation in the inherently dangerous felony of arson makes him guilty of felony murder.

Option D correctly identifies that the defendant is guilty because the killings occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.

Answer: D
