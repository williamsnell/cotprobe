Okay, so I've got this question about Nathanson's arguments regarding abolishing the death penalty. Let's see, I remember Nathanson has some specific points about what messages society sends when it either uses or abolishes the death penalty. The question is asking which message Nathanson argues we send by abolishing it.

The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says we believe in the possibility of redemption and change. That makes sense because if we don't execute someone, they have the chance to change, maybe reform. But I'm not sure if that's the exact point Nathanson made.

Option B: there are penalties worse than death. Hmm, I think Nathanson mentioned that life imprisonment could be seen as worse than death for some people, so that might be a message. But is that the main point he's arguing for abolition?

Option C: we're unable to administer justice effectively. Not sure about this. I don't recall him saying that. It might relate more to the argument about flaws in the system leading to wrongful convictions.

Option D: no punishment proportional to murder. Wait, that sounds like a point in favor of the death penalty, not against. If someone thinks death is the only fitting punishment for murder, they might support it. So probably not D.

Option E: always a possibility of judicial errors. That's a common argument against the death penalty, but does Nathanson frame it as a message we send by abolishing it? I'm not certain. It's more of a reason to oppose it rather than a message.

Option F: lenient towards heinous crimes. That doesn't seem right. Abolishing the death penalty might be seen as more lenient by some, but Nathanson's argument is probably more about morality rather than leniency.

Option G: prioritize rehabilitation over punishment. That aligns with the idea of redemption (Option A). But I'm trying to remember which point Nathanson emphasizes. I think he talks about the value of human life, so maybe that's a different option.

Option H: none of the above. This is a catch-all, but I think one of the options does fit.

Option I: respect the dignity of human life. That sounds familiar. Nathanson might argue that abolishing the death penalty shows that we value human life, even that of criminals, which is a strong moral stance.

Option J: flawed criminal justice system. This is related to option E, about judicial errors. But again, I think the main message is more about the value of life rather than the system's flaws.

So, putting it together, Nathanson's argument is likely that abolishing the death penalty sends a message about the respect for human dignity. So the answer should be I.

The correct answer is I: we respect the dignity of human life.
