Okay, so I have this physics problem here about ice and water. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm. Let's see. The setup is a 200 g ice cube placed into 500 g of water at 20°C. I need to find out what the resultant situation is, choosing from the given options.

Alright, I remember that when ice is placed in water, a few things can happen. The ice can melt, the water can cool down, or maybe they reach an equilibrium where some ice remains. I think the key here is to calculate the heat transfer and see whether the ice can melt completely or not, and what the final temperature would be.

First, I need to recall some constants. The specific heat capacity of water is about 4186 J/kg°C, I think. And the latent heat of fusion for ice is around 334,000 J/kg. Oh wait, but wait, the latent heat is the amount of energy needed to melt ice without changing the temperature, right? So when ice melts, it absorbs heat at 0°C until it's all melted.

So the problem is about heat exchange. The ice will absorb heat from the water. The water might lose heat, causing its temperature to drop, and the ice might melt. But whether all the ice melts depends on how much heat is available.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Mass of ice (m_ice) = 200 g = 0.2 kg
- Mass of water (m_water) = 500 g = 0.5 kg
- Initial temperature of water (T_initial) = 20°C

I think the process involves two steps: first, melting the ice, and second, possibly warming the melted ice to the final temperature. Alternatively, the water might cool down to 0°C, and some ice might remain.

Wait, but in this case, once the ice starts melting, the temperature of the system (water and ice) will be at 0°C because ice melts at 0°C. So any heat lost by the water will go into melting the ice, and the final temperature can't go below 0°C unless all the ice is gone, but then the water would stay at 0°C.

Wait, no, if all the ice melts, the system can then possibly increase in temperature. But wait, no, because the ice was at 0°C initially, and the water was at 20°C. So heat flows from water to ice until one of them is exhausted.

So let me think about the heat required to melt the ice. The heat of fusion (Q_fusion) is m_ice * L, where L is latent heat.

Q_fusion = 0.2 kg * 334,000 J/kg = 66,800 J.

Now, the water at 20°C will lose heat as it cools down. The maximum heat it can lose is when it cools to 0°C. The heat lost by the water is Q_water = m_water * c_water * (T_initial - T_final). Here, T_final would be 0°C.

So Q_water_max = 0.5 kg * 4186 J/kg°C * (20 - 0) = 0.5 * 4186 * 20.

Let me calculate that: 0.5 * 4186 is 2093, times 20 is 41,860 J.

So the water can give up 41,860 J before it reaches 0°C. But the ice needs 66,800 J to melt completely. Since 41,860 is less than 66,800, this means the water can't provide enough heat to melt all the ice. So only part of the ice will melt, and the remaining water and melted ice will be at 0°C.

Wait, but wait. So the heat from the water (41,860 J) will be used to melt part of the ice. How much ice can be melted with that much heat?

The amount of ice melted (m_melted) is Q_water / L.

m_melted = 41,860 J / 334,000 J/kg = approximately 0.125 kg, which is 125 grams.

Wait, so 125 grams of ice will melt, and the remaining ice is 200 - 125 = 75 grams. But wait, no, wait. Because when the water cools to 0°C, all the heat it can give is used to melt ice. So after 125g melts, the system is at 0°C, and there's still 75g of ice left.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me check again.

The total heat available from the water cooling to 0°C is Q_water = 41,860 J. The heat required to melt the ice is Q_ice = m * L.

So m = Q_water / L = 41860 / 334000 = approx 0.125 kg, so 125 g. So 125 g of ice melts, leaving 75 g of ice remaining.

Wait, but the options don't seem to have 75g ice left. Let me look at the options again.

Option H says 75g block of ice floating in water at 0°C. That's one of the choices. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, but wait. 200g ice, 125g melts, so 75g remains. The water, after cooling to 0°C, now has the melted ice (125g of water) added to it. So the total water is 500g + 125g = 625g at 0°C, with 75g of ice remaining.

So the situation is that there's still ice, and the water is at 0°C. So option H says 75g ice, water at 0°C. That matches.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I is 200g ice floating in water at 0°C. That's not possible because some ice must have melted. Option D is 100g ice, but I calculated 75g. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recompute the numbers carefully.

Calculating Q_water: 0.5 kg * 4186 J/kg°C * 20°C.

0.5 * 4186 = 2093 J/°C. Multiply by 20°C: 2093 *20 = 41,860 J. That's correct.

Q_fusion needed for all ice: 0.2 kg * 334,000 = 66,800 J.

Available heat is 41,860, which is less than 66,800, so only part of the ice melts.

m_melted = 41,860 / 334,000 = 0.125 kg = 125g.

So 125g melted, 75g remains.

So the remaining ice is 75g, and the water is now at 0°C because it gave up all its heat to melt the ice.

So the correct option would be H: 75g ice remains, water at 0°C.

But wait, let's check the options again.

Option H: 75g ice floating in water at 0°C. Yes, that's correct.

But wait, another thought: when the ice melts, the resulting water would be at 0°C, right? So the 125g of melted ice becomes 125g of water, making the total water 625g at 0°C, with 75g ice remaining. So the system is at 0°C, with ice floating.

So the correct answer should be H.

Looking at the options, option H is choice H: 75g ice remains, water at 0°C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another option is I: 200g ice remains, water at 0°C. That would only happen if the water couldn't melt any ice, but that's not the case here because the water was at 20°C, which is higher than 0°C.

So the correct answer is H.

To determine the resultant situation when a 200 g ice cube is placed in 500 g of water at 20°C, we analyze the heat transfer between the ice and the water. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Heat required to melt the ice**:  
   The latent heat of fusion for ice is \( L = 334,000 \, \text{J/kg} \). To melt the entire 200 g (0.2 kg) of ice, the energy required is:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{fusion}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L = 0.2 \, \text{kg} \cdot 334,000 \, \text{J/kg} = 66,800 \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Heat available from the water**:  
   The water initially at 20°C can lose heat as it cools to 0°C. The heat lost is given by:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T,
   \]  
   where \( m_{\text{water}} = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \), \( c_{\text{water}} = 4186 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)} \), and \( \Delta T = 20 \, \text{°C} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{water}} = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \cdot 4186 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)} \cdot 20 \, \text{°C} = 41,860 \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison of heat available and heat required**:  
   The water can only provide \( 41,860 \, \text{J} \), which is less than the \( 66,800 \, \text{J} \) required to melt all the ice. Therefore, only a portion of the ice will melt.  

4. **Mass of ice melted**:  
   The amount of ice that can be melted with \( 41,860 \, \text{J} \) is:  
   \[
   m_{\text{melted}} = \frac{Q_{\text{water}}}{L} = \frac{41,860 \, \text{J}}{334,000 \, \text{J/kg}} = 0.125 \, \text{kg} = 125 \, \text{g}.
   \]  
   Thus, \( 125 \, \text{g} \) of ice melts, leaving \( 200 \, \text{g} - 125 \, \text{g} = 75 \, \text{g} \) of ice remaining.

5. **Final state of the system**:  
   After the heat transfer, the water cools to 0°C, and the remaining 75 g of ice floats in the water. The final system consists of 625 g of water (500 g initial water + 125 g melted ice) at 0°C, with 75 g of ice remaining.

6. **Analysis of the options**:  
   - **Option H**: "75 g block of ice floating in water at 0°C" matches the calculated result.  
   - Other options, such as "no ice remains" or "water at temperatures above 0°C," are inconsistent with the calculations.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: 75 g block of ice floating in water at 0°C.**
