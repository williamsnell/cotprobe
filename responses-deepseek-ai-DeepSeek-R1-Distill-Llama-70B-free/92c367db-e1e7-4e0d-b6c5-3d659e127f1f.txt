Okay, so I have this problem where a company's revenue and cost functions are given, and I need to find the breakeven point and determine how many units to produce to make a profit. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the breakeven point is where the revenue equals the cost. So, I need to set R equal to C and solve for X. The revenue function is R = 90 times the square root of (2X), and the cost function is C = 3X + 1200.

So, setting them equal: 90√(2X) = 3X + 1200. That looks a bit tricky because of the square root. Maybe I can simplify this equation step by step.

Let me write it down: 90√(2X) = 3X + 1200. To make it easier, I can divide both sides by 3 to reduce the numbers. Dividing both sides by 3 gives 30√(2X) = X + 400.

Now, I have 30√(2X) = X + 400. Hmm, how do I solve for X here? Square roots can be a pain. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. But I have to remember that squaring both sides might introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll need to check the solutions at the end.

Let me denote √(2X) as Y for a moment to make it easier. So, Y = √(2X), which means Y² = 2X. Then the equation becomes 30Y = (Y²)/2 + 400. Wait, no, because X is equal to Y²/2. So substituting back, the equation is 30Y = (Y²/2) + 400.

Wait, maybe I should do it without substitution. Let's go back to 30√(2X) = X + 400. I'll square both sides:

(30√(2X))² = (X + 400)².

Calculating the left side: (30)^2 * (√(2X))^2 = 900 * 2X = 1800X.

Right side: (X + 400)^2 = X² + 800X + 160000.

So now the equation is 1800X = X² + 800X + 160000.

Let's bring everything to one side to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 1800X from both sides:

0 = X² + 800X + 160000 - 1800X.

Simplify the terms:

X² - 1000X + 160000 = 0.

Wait, wait: 800X - 1800X is -1000X, right? So the quadratic equation becomes X² - 1000X + 160000 = 0.

Now, I need to solve for X using this quadratic equation. Let's see if I can factor it, but the numbers are pretty big. Maybe using the quadratic formula is better.

The quadratic formula is X = [1000 ± sqrt( (1000)^2 - 4*1*160000 ) ] / (2*1).

Calculating the discriminant: D = (1000)^2 - 4*1*160000.

1000 squared is 1,000,000. 4 times 160,000 is 640,000. So D = 1,000,000 - 640,000 = 360,000.

So sqrt(D) is sqrt(360,000). Let me compute that. 360,000 is 36 * 10,000. So sqrt(36*10^4) = 6 * 100 = 600.

Thus, X = [1000 ± 600]/2.

So two solutions:

X = (1000 + 600)/2 = 1600/2 = 800.

X = (1000 - 600)/2 = 400/2 = 200.

So X could be 800 or 200. But wait, because we squared both sides, we might have introduced an extraneous solution. I need to check both solutions in the original equation.

Let me test X=200 first.

Original equation: 90√(2*200) = 3*200 + 1200.

Compute left side: 2*200 = 400, so sqrt(400)=20. 90*20=1800.

Right side: 3*200=600; 600 +1200=1800. So 1800=1800. So X=200 is valid.

Now test X=800.

Left side: 2*800=1600, sqrt(1600)=40. 90*40=3600.

Right side: 3*800=2400 + 1200=3600. So 3600=3600. X=800 is also valid.

Hmm, so both solutions are valid. That means the breakeven points are at X=200 and X=800. Wait, but breakeven points are where revenue equals cost. So the company breaks even at these two points. So between them, what's the situation?

I think I need to analyze the regions. Let's pick a value between 200 and 800, say X=500.

Compute R and C at X=500.

R = 90√(2*500) = 90√(1000). Hmm, sqrt(1000) is about 31.62, so 90*31.62 ≈ 2846.8.

C = 3*500 + 1200 = 1500 + 1200 = 2700.

So R ≈2846.8 and C=2700. So R > C in this region. That means between X=200 and X=800, the company is making a profit.

Outside of these points, let's pick X=100. Then R=90√(200) ≈90*14.14≈1272.6. C=3*100+1200=300+1200=1500. So R < C. So at X=100, the company is losing money.

Now pick X=850. R=90√(1700) ≈90*41.23≈3715. C=3*850+1200=2550+1200=3750. So R≈3715 < 3750, so loss again.

So the company makes a profit when X is between 200 and 800. So the breakeven points are at 200 and 800 units. So to make a profit, they need to produce more than 200 and less than 800. Wait, no, because between 200 and 800, they make a profit, as R > C. So the inequality would be 200 < X < 800. But looking back, the options don't have that exact wording. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 250 < X <850

B:100 < X <700

C:350 < X <900

D:0 < X <600

E:300 < X <900

F:150 < X <750

G:200 < X <800

H:X <200

I:X>800

J:400 < X <1000

So option G is 200 < X <800, which matches what I found. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but let's make sure. The question asks for the breakeven point and how many units to produce to make a profit. Wait, does the question have two parts? The first part is to find the breakeven point, which are X=200 and X=800. But the second part is about the inequality for making profit, which is between them.

So the answer is G: 200 < X <800.

So the correct option is G.
</think>

To determine the breakeven point and the range of units to produce for a profit, we start by setting the revenue function \( R = 90\sqrt{2X} \) equal to the cost function \( C = 3X + 1200 \). This gives:

\[
90\sqrt{2X} = 3X + 1200
\]

Dividing through by 3 simplifies the equation to:

\[
30\sqrt{2X} = X + 400
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
(30\sqrt{2X})^2 = (X + 400)^2
\]

\[
1800X = X^2 + 800X + 160000
\]

Rearranging into standard quadratic form:

\[
X^2 - 1000X + 160000 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \( X = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1000 \), and \( c = 160000 \):

\[
X = \frac{1000 \pm \sqrt{1000^2 - 4(1)(160000)}}{2}
\]

\[
X = \frac{1000 \pm \sqrt{360000}}{2}
\]

\[
X = \frac{1000 \pm 600}{2}
\]

This yields two solutions:

\[
X = \frac{1000 + 600}{2} = 800 \quad \text{and} \quad X = \frac{1000 - 600}{2} = 200
\]

Thus, the breakeven points are \( X = 200 \) and \( X = 800 \). To determine the range where the company makes a profit, we analyze the behavior of \( R \) and \( C \). For \( X < 200 \) or \( X > 800 \), \( R < C \), indicating a loss. For \( 200 < X < 800 \), \( R > C \), indicating a profit.

The correct inequality for profitable production is:

\[
200 < X < 800
\]

From the given options, the correct choice is:

G: \( 200 < X < 800 \).
