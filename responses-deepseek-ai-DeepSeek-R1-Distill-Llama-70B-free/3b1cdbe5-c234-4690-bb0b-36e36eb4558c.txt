Okay, so I've got this problem here about stocks and percentages. Let me try to break it down. The question says that a stock was sold at a gain of 13.5 percent on its original cost. I need to find out what percent the selling price is of the original cost. Hmm, right. 

Wait, I remember that when you sell something for a gain, the selling price is the original cost plus the gain. Oh right, the gain is calculated on the original cost. So if the original cost is, let's say, $100, then a 13.5% gain would be $13.5. So the selling price would be $113.5. 

But wait, the question is asking for the percentage the selling price is of the original cost. So if the original cost is 100%, the selling price would be 113.5%, because it's the original plus the gain. 

So the options are A to J. Let me look at the options. Option G is 113.5%, which matches what I just calculated. So the answer should be G. 

Alternatively, I can think algebraically. Let me denote the original cost as C. The gain is 13.5% of C, which is 0.135 * C. So the selling price (S) is C + 0.135C = 1.135C. To find what percent this is of the original cost, I can express it as (S/C)*100%, which is (1.135C/C)*100% = 113.5%. Yep, same answer. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was understanding that the gain is added to the original cost, and then expressing that as a percentage of the original. So the correct option is G.

The selling price is calculated by adding the gain to the original cost. A 13.5% gain means the selling price is 113.5% of the original cost. 

Answer: G
