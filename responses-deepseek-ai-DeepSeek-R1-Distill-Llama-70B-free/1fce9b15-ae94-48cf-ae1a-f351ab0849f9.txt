Okay, so I've got this question about a helium-neon laser and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that the transition from the 3s to the 2p neon level gives a laser emission at 632.8 nm. The energy of the 2p level is given as 15.2e-19 J. The question is asking how much pumping energy is required, assuming no loss. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in lasers, the pumping energy is needed to excite atoms to a higher energy state so that when they drop back down, they emit photons. So the energy required for pumping would be the difference between the higher energy level (pumping to) and the lower one (the transition to).

Wait, wait. The transition here is from 3s to 2p. So 3s must be a higher energy level than 2p. When the electron drops from 3s to 2p, it emits a photon of 632.8 nm. But the energy given is for the 2p level. So the 3s level must have higher energy than 2p.

Oh wait, but the energy of 2p is 15.2e-19 J. So to find the pumping energy, we need the energy of the 3s level minus the 2p level. But wait, how do we find the 3s energy?

I think the energy of the emitted photon during the transition would be the difference between the two levels. The wavelength is given, so I can calculate the energy of the emitted photon using E=hc/λ.

Wait, but the question gives the energy of the 2p level as 15.2e-19 J. So the 3s level must be higher. Let me think about the steps.

1. Calculate the photon energy emitted when transitioning from 3s to 2p. That's E_photon = hc/λ.

2. The energy difference between 3s and 2p is equal to E_photon. So, E_3s - E_2p = E_photon.

3. Since E_2p is given as 15.2e-19 J, E_3s would be E_2p + E_photon.

But wait, the pumping energy would be the amount needed to raise the neon atoms from their ground state (or a lower state) up to the 3s level. However, in this question, it's phrased a bit differently. It says, how much pumping energy is required, assuming no loss in the transition. So I think it's asking for the energy difference between the initial state (maybe lower than 3s) and the 3s state.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the initial state. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, in a He-Ne laser, the process involves helium being excited first. Helium has higher energy levels, and when it collides with neon, it pumps the neon atoms. So the neon's excited state (like 3s) is populated via this process. So the pumping energy would be the energy needed to get the neon into the 3s state.

Wait, but the question is about the transition from 3s to 2p. So E_3s is higher than E_2p. So the energy of the emitted photon is E_3s - E_2p.

So if I can find E_photon, I can find E_3s. Then, the pumping energy would be the energy required to get from the lower state (maybe ground state) to 3s. But wait, the question says "assuming no loss in the helium-neon transition", so perhaps the pumping energy is exactly the energy required to raise from the 2p level to the 3s level? Or perhaps the ground state is lower than 2p? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the 2p level is a lower energy state. So the pump must raise the atoms from a lower state (like ground state) to the 3s level. But without knowing the ground state energy, maybe the question is considering the 2p as the lower state that the system is in before being pumped? Or perhaps the 3s is a metastable state, and the ground state is lower than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's take the given data.

Given:

λ = 632.8 nm = 632.8e-9 m.

E_2p = 15.2e-19 J.

We need to calculate E_pumping, which is the energy needed to pump the neon atoms into the 3s state. But to find that, we need the energy of the 3s state.

Since the transition is from 3s to 2p, the energy difference is E_3s - E_2p = photon energy.

So E_photon = hc/λ.

Let me compute that. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is 3e8 m/s.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (632.8e-9)

Let me compute the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 632.8e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 632.8e-9 = approx 3.141e-19 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

632.8e-9 = 6.328e-7 m.

So 1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 = approx 3.141e-19 J.

So E_photon is about 3.14e-19 J.

So the energy difference between 3s and 2p is 3.14e-19 J. So E_3s = E_2p + E_photon.

E_2p is 15.2e-19 J, so E_3s = 15.2e-19 + 3.14e-19 = 18.34e-19 J.

Now, the pumping energy is the energy required to reach the 3s level. But wait, from where? If the atoms are in the ground state, which is lower than 2p, then the pumping energy would be E_3s - E_ground. But the question doesn't give E_ground.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that before pumping, the atoms are in the 2p state. That doesn't make much sense, because 2p is an excited state. Alternatively, maybe the 2p is a metastable state, and the pump excites to 3s.

Alternatively, perhaps the pumping energy is the energy required to excite from 2p to 3s, which would be E_photon as we've calculated.

Wait, but that can't be right because the 3s is higher than 2p, so the pumping energy is the energy needed to get from 2p to 3s, which is E_photon, 3.14e-19 J. But none of the options match that exactly, but let's look.

Wait, looking at the options:

A:3.12e-19

B:21.5e-19

C:18.32e-19

D:19.5e-19

E:15.2e-19

F:22.7e-19

G:20.32e-19

H:16.4e-19

I:17.2e-19

J:12.1e-19

Hmm, the E_photon is 3.14e-19, which would be option A's 3.12e-19. But the question is about pumping energy, which is the energy needed to get to the 3s level. So if the initial state is the 2p level, then the pumping energy is indeed the E_photon, but wait, that would be option A.

But wait, maybe the initial state is the ground state of neon. Suppose the ground state is lower than 2p. Then, E_pump would be E_3s - E_ground. But since E_ground isn't given, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 2p level is the initial state, so the pump energy is the difference between 3s and 2p, which is 3.14e-19 J, so option A.

But wait, another angle. Let me think again. The question says, "how much pumping energy is required assuming no loss in the helium-neon transition." So perhaps the pumping is the energy needed to get from the 2p level to the 3s level. Because in the He-Ne laser, the He atoms are excited and transfer their energy to Ne. So the Ne goes from ground state (let's say E1) to 3s (E3), which requires E3 - E1. But without knowing E1, maybe the question is making an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the energy required is the energy difference between 3s and 2p, which is the E_photon. But that would be 3.14e-19, option A.

But looking at the options, option A is 3.12, which is close but not exact. Wait, perhaps my calculation was off.

Let me do the exact calculation. Let me compute E_photon.

E_photon = hc/λ.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value now).

c=299792458 m/s.

But for approximation, using 3e8 m/s is okay, but let's compute more precisely.

λ =632.8 nm =632.8e-9 m.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (632.8e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (632.8e-9) 

Wait, 632.8e-9 is 6.328e-7 m.

So 1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 = let's calculate this.

Let me compute 1.9878e-25 ÷6.328e-7.

First, 1.9878 ÷6.328 ≈ 0.3141.

Then, 1e-25 /1e-7 =1e-18.

So 0.3141e-18 =3.141e-19 J.

So about 3.14e-19 J. So the closest option is A:3.12e-19, which is a bit lower.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value with precise h and c might give a slightly different result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the sum of E_3s, which is 15.2e-19 + 3.14e-19 =18.34e-19. That would be option C:18.32e-19.

Wait, that's another approach. If the 2p level is 15.2e-19 J, and the 3s level is higher by E_photon (3.14e-19), then E_3s is 15.2 +3.14 = 18.34e-19, which matches option C (18.32e-19). So the pumping energy would be E_3s, which is 18.32e-19 J, option C.

But wait, why would the pumping energy be E_3s? Because the pump raises the atom from the ground state (let's say E_ground) to E_3s. So the energy required is E_3s - E_ground. But if E_ground is lower than 2p, which is 15.2e-19, then E_3s would be 15.2e-19 + E_photon. But without E_ground, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the pumping energy is the energy needed to reach the 3s level from the 2p level. Then, the pumping energy would be E_photon, which is 3.14e-19 J. But then the correct option would be A, 3.12e-19.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 18.32e-19, which is close to E_3s=18.34e-19 J.

So which interpretation is correct?

The question is: how much pumping energy is required assuming no loss in the helium-neon transition?

Ah, perhaps the pumping is the energy required to excite the neon from ground state to 3s. But if the 2p is a lower state, then the ground state is even lower. So E_pumping would be E_3s - E_ground.

But since E_ground isn't given, perhaps the question assumes that the 2p is the initial state. That is, perhaps the atoms are initially in the 2p state, and the pump raises them to the 3s state, which requires E_photon (3.14e-19 J), option A.

But that doesn't make much sense because the 2p is an excited state, not the ground state.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2p is the ground state. But that also doesn't make sense because in neon, the ground state is lower than the 2p level.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. In a laser, the pumping raises atoms from a lower energy state (like ground state) to a higher energy state (like 3s). The transition then occurs from 3s to 2p, emitting a photon of energy E = hc/λ.

So the energy of 3s is E_3s, and 2p is E_2p.

So E_3s = E_2p + (hc/λ) =15.2e-19 +3.14e-19=18.34e-19.

So the pumping energy is E_3s - E_ground.

But if E_ground is the ground state of neon, which is lower than 2p, then E_ground <15.2e-19.

But since the question doesn't specify E_ground, perhaps it assumes that the pumping is from 2p to 3s, which would require 3.14e-19 J, option A.

But given the options, option C is 18.32e-19, which is the E_3s value. So if the pumping is from ground state (E_ground) to E_3s, and E_ground is zero, then the pumping energy would be E_3s=18.34e-19, option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the pumping energy is the energy needed to reach the 3s level, which is E_3s. So E_3s is 18.34e-19 J, option C.

But why would the pumping energy be E_3s? Because if the initial state is the ground state (E_ground=0), then E_pumping = E_3s - E_ground = E_3s=18.34e-19 J, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming no loss, meaning that the energy used for pumping is entirely converted into the energy levels, so the energy required is the energy of the 3s state.

So in that case, the pumping energy would be 18.34e-19 J, which is option C:18.32e-19.

But wait, the exact calculation when λ=632.8e-9 m.

Compute E_photon precisely:

E_photon = (6.62607015e-34 J·s * 299792458 m/s) / (632.8e-9 m)

Calculate numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = approx 1.98644586e-25 J·m.

Divide by 632.8e-9 m: 1.98644586e-25 / 632.8e-9 = (1.98644586 /632.8 )e-16.

1.98644586 /632.8 ≈ 0.0031415.

So 0.0031415e-16 = 3.1415e-19 J.

So E_photon is 3.1415e-19 J.

E_3s = 15.2e-19 +3.1415e-19 =18.3415e-19 J, which is approximately 18.34e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 18.32e-19 J. That's very close but not exact. Perhaps the given energy in the question is approximate.

Wait, maybe the 2p level energy is given as 15.2e-19 J. Let me double-check.

In the question, 2p energy is 15.2 ×10^-19 J.

So E_3s=15.2 +3.1415=18.3415e-19, which is 1.83415e-18 J, or 18.3415e-19 J.

The closest option is C:18.32e-19. Hmm, 18.32 is 18.32e-19. So the difference is 0.0215e-19, which is small. Perhaps the question uses an approximate value for h or c.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute E_photon with more precise steps.

E_photon = hc/λ.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s.

c=299792458 m/s.

λ=632.8e-9 m.

Compute hc: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = ?

Let me compute this:

6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = (6.62607015 *2.99792458 )e-34+8 = (19.864676 )e-26 = 1.9864676e-25 J·m.

Now, divide by λ=632.8e-9 m.

So 1.9864676e-25 /632.8e-9 = (1.9864676 /632.8 )e-16.

Compute 1.9864676 /632.8.

632.8 is approximately 633. So 1.9864676 /633 ≈0.003141.

So E_photon ≈3.141e-19 J.

So E_3s=15.2e-19 +3.141e-19 =18.341e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 18.32e-19, which is very close. Perhaps the question rounded E_photon to 3.12e-19 J, leading to E_3s=15.2 +3.12=18.32e-19, which is option C.
