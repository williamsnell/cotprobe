Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about English law and jurisdiction, specifically regarding extra-territorial abduction. Hmm, I need to figure out whether such an abduction is a ground for refusing jurisdiction. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that extra-territorial abduction refers to the act of taking someone from another country to face trial in your own country. I think this is sometimes a controversial topic because it can involve issues of international law and human rights.

I recall that in English law, the courts have certain principles about how they exercise jurisdiction. There's this concept of "abuse of process," which comes into play when the way someone is brought before the court is so unfair or unjust that it undermines the integrity of the legal proceedings.

Wait, wasn't there a case where the court decided that if someone was abducted from another country, the English courts might stay the proceedings because it's an abuse of process? I think that's right. The court's main concern is whether the abduction would render the trial unfair or if it would be against the principles of justice.

So looking at the options:

Option A says such abduction is encouraged. That doesn't sound right because encouraging illegal actions wouldn't make sense for a court.

Option B says it has no influence. But I think it does have an impact because the court does consider how the defendant was brought before them.

Option C suggests staying proceedings would prevent justice for international criminals. Hmm, maybe, but the court's primary concern is the fairness of the trial, not necessarily about whether the person is an international criminal.

Option D says the case is dismissed immediately. I don't think that's always the case. The court might stay the proceedings but not necessarily dismiss the case outright.

Option E claims jurisdiction is nullified. That seems too strong. The court doesn't lose jurisdiction; it's more about whether they should exercise it.

Option F says the abductor is liable but no stay. I'm not sure about that. I think the focus is more on whether the trial should proceed, not just the abductor's liability.

Option G says courts always refuse jurisdiction. No, that's too absolute. It probably depends on the circumstances.

Option H states it's an abuse of process leading to a stay. This rings a bell. The court would consider the abduction as an abuse, so they might stay the proceedings.

Option I says proceedings are stayed if the abductee isn't a UK citizen. I don't think citizenship is the determining factor here; it's more about the process and fairness.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is H. Extra-territorial abduction can be seen as an abuse of process, leading the court to stay the proceedings. This aligns with what I remember about English law and the principles of fairness in legal proceedings.

The question revolves around whether extra-territorial abduction serves as a ground for refusing jurisdiction in English courts. English law considers such abduction under the concept of "abuse of process," where the fairness and integrity of legal proceedings are paramount. Courts may stay proceedings if the abduction undermines justice, rather than dismissing the case outright or nullifying jurisdiction. The key factor is the unfairness of the process, not the defendant's nationality or the abductor's liability. Among the options, H correctly identifies that such abduction constitutes an abuse of process, potentially leading to a stay of proceedings.

Answer: H
