Okay, so I have this problem about finding the input impedance of a transmission line. Hmm, I remember that transmission lines have some specific formulas for calculating impedance when they're terminated with a certain load. Let me think.

The problem says the line has a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. It's terminated with a load impedance of +j50 ohms. Oh wait, j is the imaginary unit, so that's a purely reactive load, maybe a capacitor or inductor. And the line length is such that beta times l equals pi radians. Beta is the phase constant, right? Beta is 2pi over lambda, so when beta*l is pi, that means l is lambda/2. Oh, right, because beta l = (2pi/lambda) * l. So if beta l is pi, then l is lambda/2. So the line is half a wavelength long.

I remember the formula for the input impedance of a transmission line. It's Z_in = Z0 * (Z_L + Z0 tanh(beta l)) / (Z0 + Z_L tanh(beta l)) or something like that. Wait, no, that's for when the line is lossy. Oh wait, when the line is lossless, the formula uses the hyperbolic functions differently. Or maybe it's Z_in = Z0 * (Z_L + j Z0 tan(beta l)) / (Z0 + j Z_L tan(beta l)).

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh right, the correct formula when the line is lossless (which it probably is here) is Z_in = Z0 * (Z_L + j Z0 tan(beta l)) / (Z0 + j Z_L tan(beta l)).

But wait, another way to think: when the length is a multiple of half-wavelengths, the input impedance can be simplified. Because for a half-wave line, the impedance transforms in a particular way.

Wait, when the line is a half wavelength long (beta l = pi), the tangent of beta l is tan(pi) which is zero. Oh wait, because beta l is pi radians, so beta l = pi, so l is lambda/2.

So substituting into the formula: Z_in = Z0 * (Z_L + j Z0 * tan(beta l)) / (Z0 + j Z_L * tan(beta l)).

But tan(pi) is zero. So the formula simplifies to Z_in = Z0 * Z_L / Z0. Because the j terms with tan(beta l) disappear. So Z_in = Z_L.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because if Z_in is Z_L, then when a half-wave line is terminated with Z_L, the input impedance is Z_L. But I thought that a half-wave transformer can be used to match impedances, but maybe that's when the line is a quarter wave.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a lossless line, the impedance at a distance l from the load is Z_in = Z0 * (Z_L + j Z0 tan(beta l)) / (Z0 + j Z_L tan(beta l)).

Wait, when beta l is pi, then tan(beta l) is tan(pi) which is zero. So substituting, Z_in = Z0 * (Z_L + 0) / (Z0 + 0) = Z0 * Z_L / Z0 = Z_L. So the input impedance equals the load impedance.

Wait but wait, in this case, the load is +j50 ohms. So Z_L is j50. So then Z_in would be j50 ohms.

Looking at the options, option C is -50j, option H is +50j. So according to this, the answer would be H.

But wait a second, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check. Another approach is to use the reflection coefficient method.

The reflection coefficient gamma is (Z_L - Z0)/(Z_L + Z0). So substituting Z_L = j50, Z0 = 50. So gamma = (j50 -50)/(j50 +50) = [50(-1 + j)] / [50(1 + j)] ) = (-1 + j)/(1 + j).

Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, when the line is a half-wavelength, the input impedance is the same as the load impedance. Because any phase shift over half a wavelength would invert the impedance in a way. Wait, no, perhaps that's for a quarter wavelength. Wait, no, I think for a quarter wave transformer, the input impedance is transformed by a factor involving Z0 and the load.

Wait another thought: for a line of length l, when l = lambda/2, the input impedance repeats. Like, if you have a line longer than lambda/2, but in steps of lambda/2, the input impedance is the same as the load. So in that case, the input impedance should be equal to the load. So Z_in = Z_L = j50 ohms.

But looking at the options, option H is +50j, which would be j50. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, let me think again if I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Z_in = Z0 * [ Z_L + j Z0 tan(beta l) ] / [ Z0 + j Z_L tan(beta l) ].

Wait, if beta l is pi, then tan(beta l) is zero. So Z_in becomes Z0 * Z_L / Z0 = Z_L. So yes, that's correct.

So the input impedance is j50 ohms, which is option H.

To determine the input impedance of a 50 ohm transmission line terminated in a load impedance of \( +j50 \, \Omega \), where the line length satisfies \( \beta l = \pi \) radians, we use the formula for the input impedance of a lossless transmission line:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \frac{Z_L + j Z_0 \tan(\beta l)}{Z_0 + j Z_L \tan(\beta l)}.
\]

Here:
- \( Z_0 = 50 \, \Omega \) (characteristic impedance),
- \( Z_L = +j50 \, \Omega \) (load impedance),
- \( \beta l = \pi \) radians.

Since \( \tan(\beta l) = \tan(\pi) = 0 \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \frac{Z_L}{Z_0} = Z_L.
\]

Thus, the input impedance equals the load impedance, \( Z_{\text{in}} = +j50 \, \Omega \).

From the given options:
- Option H corresponds to \( +50j \, \Omega \), which matches the calculated input impedance.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: \( +50j \, \Omega \).**
