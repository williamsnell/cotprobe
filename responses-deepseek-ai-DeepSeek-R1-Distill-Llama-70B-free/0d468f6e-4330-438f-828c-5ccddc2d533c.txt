Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an airplane landing on a carrier deck. Hmm, I need to find the acceleration and the time it takes to stop. The options are given, but I should work through it step by step.

Alright, the airplane's initial speed is 150 miles per hour. Wait, but the stopping distance is given in feet, so I think I need to convert the speed to feet per second to keep the units consistent. Oh right, unit conversion is crucial here.

So, how do I convert miles per hour to feet per second? I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, 150 miles per hour would be 150 * 5280 feet per 3600 seconds. Let me calculate that. 150 divided by 3600 is 0.041666... Multiply that by 5280. Let me do the math: 5280 * 150 = 792000. Then divide by 3600. 792000 / 3600 is... 220. So the speed is 220 ft/s? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 60 miles per hour is 88 ft/s, right? Because 60 mph is a common conversion. So 60 mph is 88 ft/s, so 150 mph would be 2.5 times that. 88 * 2.5 is 220. Yeah, that's correct. So initial velocity u is 220 ft/s.

The airplane comes to a stop, so the final velocity v is 0. The distance covered during this stopping is 500 feet. I need to find acceleration and time.

I remember the kinematic equations. One of them is v² = u² + 2as. Since v is 0, this simplifies to 0 = u² + 2as. So the acceleration a would be -u²/(2s). Let me plug in the numbers. u is 220, so u squared is 220^2. Let's see, 220*220 is 48,400. Then 2s is 2*500=1000. So a = -48400 / 1000 = -48.4 ft/s². Oh wait, that's the acceleration. So that's negative because it's deceleration.

Now for the time. Another kinematic equation is v = u + at. Since v is 0, we have 0 = u + at. So t = -u/a. Plugging in the numbers, u is 220, a is -48.4. So t = 220 / 48.4. Let me calculate that. 48.4 times 4 is 193.6, 48.4 *4.5 is 48.4*4=193.6 plus 48.4*0.5=24.2 → 217.8. Hmm, 48.4 *4.55 is 48.4*(4 + 0.55) = 193.6 + (48.4*0.55). 48.4 *0.5 is 24.2, and 0.05 *48.4 is 2.42. So 24.2 +2.42=26.62. So total is 193.6 +26.62=220.22. That's a bit over 220. So 4.55 seconds would give a time that brings the velocity to zero. Because 48.4 *4.55 is approximately 220. So t is about 4.55 seconds.

Looking at the options, option B is -48.4 ft/s² and 4.55 seconds. So that must be the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we start by converting the airplane's initial speed from miles per hour to feet per second. Using the conversion factors \(1 \, \text{mile} = 5280 \, \text{feet}\) and \(1 \, \text{hour} = 3600 \, \text{seconds}\), the initial velocity \(u\) is calculated as:

\[
u = 150 \, \text{mi/hr} \times \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{1 \, \text{mile}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{hour}}{3600 \, \text{seconds}} = 220 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

The final velocity \(v\) is \(0 \, \text{ft/s}\) since the airplane comes to a stop. The stopping distance \(s\) is given as \(500 \, \text{ft}\). Using the kinematic equation \(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\) and substituting \(v = 0\), we solve for the acceleration \(a\):

\[
0 = u^2 + 2as \implies a = -\frac{u^2}{2s}.
\]

Substituting \(u = 220 \, \text{ft/s}\) and \(s = 500 \, \text{ft}\):

\[
a = -\frac{220^2}{2 \times 500} = -\frac{48400}{1000} = -48.4 \, \text{ft/s}^2.
\]

Next, we calculate the time \(t\) it takes to stop using the equation \(v = u + at\). Substituting \(v = 0\), \(u = 220 \, \text{ft/s}\), and \(a = -48.4 \, \text{ft/s}^2\):

\[
0 = u + at \implies t = -\frac{u}{a}.
\]

\[
t = -\frac{220}{-48.4} = 4.55 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the airplane has a deceleration of \(-48.4 \, \text{ft/s}^2\) and takes \(4.55 \, \text{seconds}\) to stop. Comparing these results with the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: -48.4 ft/sec² and 4.55 sec**
