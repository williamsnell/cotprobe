Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a freight engine pulling some cars. Hmm, I need to find out how fast the engine can pull the string of cars. Let me think about what I know.

The problem says the freight cars weigh 200 tons. Oh wait, I should probably convert that to a more usable unit, like pounds or kilograms. I remember that one ton is 2000 pounds, so 200 tons would be 200 * 2000 = 400,000 pounds. Or wait, maybe I should use kilograms because the unit for force might be in newtons. Oh wait, no, because the horsepower is in hp, which relates to watts, so maybe I should stick with the metric system.

Wait, actually, let me think again. The coefficient of rolling friction is given as 0.005. Friction force is usually calculated as the coefficient multiplied by the normal force. The normal force here would be the weight of the cars. Wait, but in what units?

So, the weight in tons. Let me convert 200 tons to kilograms. Because 1 ton is 1000 kg, so 200 tons is 200,000 kg. So the weight (force) is mass times gravity. Gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s². So the normal force F_n is 200,000 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me calculate that: 200,000 * 9.8. Wait, 200,000 * 10 is 2,000,000, so subtract 200,000 * 0.2, which is 40,000. So F_n is about 1,960,000 Newtons.

The frictional force F_friction is the coefficient (0.005) times F_n. So 0.005 * 1,960,000. Let me compute that: 0.005 is 5e-3. 5e-3 * 1.96e6 = (5 * 1.96) * 1e3 = 9.8 * 1e3 = 9800 Newtons. So the frictional force opposing the motion is 9800 N.

Now, power is related to force and velocity. The engine's power is 400 hp. I need to convert horsepower to watts because the units will be in SI. I remember that 1 hp is approximately 745.7 watts. So 400 hp is 400 * 745.7. Let me calculate that: 400 * 700 is 280,000, and 400 * 45.7 is 18,280. So adding them gives 298,280 watts, roughly 298.28 kW.

Power P is also equal to force times velocity, P = F * v. We need to find the velocity v. So rearranging, v = P / F.

Here, the force the engine needs to apply is equal to the frictional force, because at constant speed, the applied force equals the opposing force. So F is 9800 N.

So v = 298,280 W / 9800 N. Let me compute that. 298280 ÷ 9800 ≈ let's see, 9800 * 30 = 294,000. So 30 m/s is 294,000. The remaining is 298,280 - 294,000 = 4,280. 4,280 / 9800 ≈ 0.436. So total is approximately 30.436 m/s.

Wait, but wait. The question asks for the speed in miles per hour. Oh, right, I have to convert m/s to mi/hr.

I know that 1 m/s is approximately 2.23694 miles per hour. So 30.436 m/s * 2.23694 ≈ let's calculate that.

30 * 2.23694 is about 67.108, and 0.436 * 2.23694 is approximately 0.977. So total is around 68.085 mi/hr.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation. 30.436 * 2.23694. Let me compute 30 * 2.23694 = 67.1082. 0.436 * 2.23694: 0.4 * 2.23694 is about 0.8948, and 0.036 * 2.23694 is approximately 0.0805. So 0.8948 + 0.0805 = 0.9753. So total is 67.1082 + 0.9753 ≈ 68.0835 mi/hr.

Hmm, looking at the options, the closest one is option E: 65 mi/hr, or option J:60. Wait, let me check my calculations again to see if I made any mistakes.

Wait, wait. The weight was 200 tons. Did I convert that correctly? Oh wait, in the US, a ton is 2000 pounds. Oh wait, the initial mistake might be here. Because if it's 200 tons, and if it's short tons (US), then each ton is 2000 lbs. So 200 tons is 400,000 lbs. Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier by converting to kilograms using metric tons.

So, I should do this again with pounds instead.

Let me start over. Weight is 200 tons (assuming short tons), so 200 * 2000 = 400,000 pounds. To convert pounds to kilograms, since 1 lb ≈ 0.453592 kg, so 400,000 lbs = 400,000 * 0.453592 ≈ let's see, 400,000 * 0.45 is 180,000 kg. Then 400,000 * 0.003592 is approximately 1,436.8 kg. So total is about 181,436.8 kg.

Wait, but actually, perhaps it's better to work in pounds and use the appropriate gravity conversion. Because when calculating friction, F_friction = μ * m * g. Wait, but in pounds, weight is already a force. So perhaps using pounds would be better.

Wait, in the US system, weight in pounds is a force (since 1 lb is the force of gravity on 1 lbm (pound mass)). So, if the cars weigh 200 tons, each ton is 2000 lbs, so 200 * 2000 = 400,000 lbs-force.

So the normal force F_n is 400,000 lb-force.

Frictional force F_friction = μ * F_n = 0.005 * 400,000 lb = 2,000 lb.

Now, the power is 400 hp. I need to convert that to foot-pounds per second or something similar.

I remember that 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/sec.

So 400 hp = 400 * 550 = 220,000 ft-lbf/sec.

Power P = F * v, so v = P / F.

But wait, the units need to match. Let's see: F is in pounds-force, and the power is in ft-lbf/sec, so when I divide P (ft-lbf/s) by F (lbf), I get ft/s.

So v = 220,000 ft-lbf/sec / 2000 lb = 110 ft/s.

Wait, 220,000 divided by 2000 is 110 ft/s.

Now, I need to convert that speed into miles per hour.

I know that 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds.

So, to convert ft/s to mi/hr: multiply by (3600 s / 1 hr) and divide by (5280 ft / 1 mi).

So, 110 ft/s * (3600 / 5280) = 110 * (3600/5280).

Let me compute 3600/5280: both can be divided by 240. 3600/240=15, 5280/240=22. So 15/22 ≈ 0.6818.

So 110 * 0.6818 ≈ 75 mi/hr.

Hmm, that's one of the options. Option B is 75 mi/hr.

Wait, but earlier when I did the calculation using metric units, I got about 68 mi/hr. Wait, why did I get a different answer when I used kg versus pounds? Because I messed up the initial conversion. Because when I first thought, I treated 200 tons as metric tons (200,000 kg), but the correct approach is to treat it as US tons (2000 lbs each), so 400,000 lbs.

So now with this correct approach, I get 75 mi/hr, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I'm a bit confused.

In the US system:

Weight (force) = 200 tons * 2000 lb/ton = 400,000 lb.

Friction force F = μ * weight = 0.005 * 400,000 lb = 2,000 lb.

Power P = 400 hp = 400 * 550 ft-lbf/s = 220,000 ft-lbf/s.

v = P / F = 220,000 / 2000 = 110 ft/s.

Convert to mi/hr: 110 ft/s * (3600 s/hr) / (5280 ft/mi) = (110 * 3600) / 5280.

Calculate numerator: 110 * 3600 = 396,000.

Divide by 5280: 396,000 / 5280.

Let me compute that. 5280 * 75 = 396,000. So 396,000 / 5280 = 75. So yes, 75 mi/hr.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

To determine how fast the freight engine can pull the string of cars, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Weight of the freight cars**: The problem states the weight as 200 tons. In the US system, 1 ton is 2000 pounds, so the total weight is:

   \[
   200 \, \text{tons} \times 2000 \, \text{lb/ton} = 400,000 \, \text{lb}.
   \]

2. **Frictional force**: The coefficient of rolling friction is \( \mu = 0.005 \). The frictional force is calculated as:

   \[
   F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \times \text{weight} = 0.005 \times 400,000 \, \text{lb} = 2000 \, \text{lb}.
   \]

3. **Power of the engine**: The engine's power is given as 400 hp. Converting this to foot-pounds per second:

   \[
   1 \, \text{hp} = 550 \, \text{ft-lbf/sec}, \quad \text{so} \quad 400 \, \text{hp} = 400 \times 550 = 220,000 \, \text{ft-lbf/sec}.
   \]

4. **Velocity of the train**: Power is related to force and velocity by \( P = F \cdot v \). Rearranging for \( v \):

   \[
   v = \frac{P}{F} = \frac{220,000 \, \text{ft-lbf/sec}}{2000 \, \text{lb}} = 110 \, \text{ft/s}.
   \]

5. **Convert velocity to miles per hour**: To convert \( 110 \, \text{ft/s} \) to miles per hour, use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{mi/hr} = \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{3600 \, \text{s}} \):

   \[
   v = 110 \, \text{ft/s} \times \frac{3600 \, \text{s/hr}}{5280 \, \text{ft/mi}} = 75 \, \text{mi/hr}.
   \]

Thus, the freight engine can pull the string of cars at a speed of **75 mi/hr**.

**Answer: B**
