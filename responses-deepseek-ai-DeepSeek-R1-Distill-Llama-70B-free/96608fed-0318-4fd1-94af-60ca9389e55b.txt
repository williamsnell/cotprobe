Okay, so I've got this question here about moons of a planet, specifically asking about Phoebe Dione and Helene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that planets have moons, and each has their own set. The big ones like Jupiter and Saturn have a lot of moons. I think Jupiter has the most, but Saturn is a close second. Then there's Uranus and Neptune, which also have moons, but not as many as the gas giants.

Phoebe Dione... Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, maybe it's Phoebe and Dione. Are those two separate moons? Or is the name Phoebe Dione combined? I might be mixing things up. Let me think. I remember Phoebe is a moon of Saturn. Yeah, Phoebe is one of Saturn's moons. It's an irregular moon, I think, with a retrograde orbit, meaning it goes around Saturn in the opposite direction compared to the planet's rotation.

Then there's Dione. Dione is definitely a moon of Saturn. I remember that Dione and Rhea are similar in size, and they're both part of the larger moons of Saturn. So Dione is Saturn's moon.

Wait, but the question says Phoebe Dione and Helene. Oh, maybe I misread that. So it's two moons: Phoebe Dione and Helene? Or is it Phoebe and Dione, and Helene as another moon? I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Helene is another moon I've heard of. I think Helene is also a moon of Saturn. Yes, Helene is one of Saturn's moons. I believe it's a smaller moon, maybe part of the inner moons or perhaps a shepherd moon. So if both Phoebe and Helene are moons of Saturn, then the answer would be Saturn.

Wait, but what about Dione? Dione is definitely a Saturn moon as well. So all three—Phoebe, Dione, and Helene—are moons of Saturn. So the planet in question is Saturn.

Looking at the options, option A is Saturn. So the answer should be A.

The question asks which planet has moons named Phoebe Dione and Helene. Upon analyzing the names, it's clear that Phoebe, Dione, and Helene are all moons of Saturn. Phoebe is a notable irregular moon of Saturn with a retrograde orbit, while Dione is one of Saturn's larger moons. Helene is also a smaller moon of Saturn. Since all three moons are associated with Saturn, the correct answer is Saturn.

Answer: A
