Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay and half-lives. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm. Alright, the problem says there's a sample with one million radioactive nuclei, and the half-life is 20 seconds. They're asking how many nuclei remain after 10 seconds.

Wait, right, half-life is the time it takes for half of the nuclei to decay. So if the half-life is 20 seconds, that means every 20 seconds, half of the remaining nuclei decay. But wait, the question is after 10 seconds, which is half of the half-life time. So I can't just take half of the initial amount because 10 seconds isn't a full half-life period.

I remember the formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where T is the half-life. So N0 is the initial number of nuclei, which is 1,000,000 here. T is 20 seconds, and t is 10 seconds.

Plugging in the numbers: N(10) = 1e6 * (1/2)^(10/20) = 1e6 * (1/2)^0.5. Oh wait, 0.5 is half. So (1/2)^0.5 is the square root of 1/2, which is approximately 0.7071.

So calculating that, 1,000,000 multiplied by 0.7071 gives about 707,100 nuclei remaining. Looking at the options, option G is 707,000. That must be the right answer.

Wait, but waitâ€”am I sure I did that correctly? Let me double-check. The formula is correct. Half-life is 20s, so after 20s, 500k left. After 10s, which is half of the half-life, so we're halfway between 1M and 500k. But wait, that's not exactly correct because decay isn't linear. It's exponential. So after 10s, it's not 750k, which is halfway between 1M and 500k. Instead, it's the square root of half, as I did earlier. So 0.7071, that's right.

So the correct answer should be G: 707,000 nuclei.

To determine how many radioactive nuclei remain after 10 seconds, we use the formula for radioactive decay:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{T}}
\]

Here:
- \( N_0 = 1,000,000 \) (initial number of nuclei),
- \( T = 20 \, \text{s} \) (half-life),
- \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \) (time elapsed).

Substituting the values:

\[
N(10) = 1,000,000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{10}{20}} = 1,000,000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{0.5}
\]

The term \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{0.5}\) is the square root of \(\frac{1}{2}\), which is approximately \(0.7071\). Thus:

\[
N(10) = 1,000,000 \cdot 0.7071 \approx 707,100 \, \text{nuclei}.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **707,000 nuclei**, which corresponds to option G.
