Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about angular magnification when viewing an object through a pane of glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the object is viewed at 33 cm, and the glass is 5 mm thick. I remember that angular magnification has to do with how much the object appears magnified or demagnified when viewed through a medium. Oh right, I think it's related to the concept of lateral shift or something like that.

Wait, I think the formula for angular magnification (M) when looking through a medium like glass is given by M = (t)/(u), where t is the thickness of the medium and u is the distance from the object to the medium. Or was it the object distance from the lens? No, wait, in this case, the object is placed in air, and we're looking through the glass. So the object is at a distance u from the glass. 

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. I think the angular magnification is actually calculated using the formula M ≈ (t)/(f), but wait, that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's (n-1)t/u, where n is the refractive index of the glass. Oh, right! Because when light passes through a medium of thickness t, there's a lateral shift, which causes an apparent shift in the position of the object. This shift leads to angular magnification.

So the formula I remember is M = (n - 1) * (t) / u. But wait, I'm not sure if the denominator is u or something else. Let me think again. The angular magnification can be approximated by the ratio of the lateral shift (which is (n-1)*t) to the object distance u. So M ≈ (n-1)t / u.

But wait, I don't remember the exact value of the refractive index of glass. Typically, n for glass is around 1.5, right? So n-1 would be 0.5.

Now, the thickness t is given as 5 mm. Oh wait, the object distance is 33 cm. I need to make sure the units match. Let's convert everything to the same units. 5 mm is 0.5 cm because 1 cm is 10 mm, so 5 mm is 0.5 cm. Alternatively, maybe I should convert to meters, but since u is in cm, probably better to convert t to cm as well.

So t = 0.5 cm, u = 33 cm. So plugging into the formula, M ≈ (0.5) * 0.5 cm / 33 cm. Let's compute that.

0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25. Divide by 33 gives approximately 0.007575. Wait, but that's a decimal. So to get the percentage, I multiply by 100. That gives 0.7575%, approximately 0.76%. Looking at the options, A is 0.7%, which is close. Other options are 0.5%, 1%, etc. So the closest answer would be A: 0.7%.

Wait a second, did I get the formula right? Because another thought comes to mind. Angular magnification is also sometimes approximated as M ≈ (n-1) * (t/u) * (1/f), but that doesn't seem right. No, I think that's not correct. The correct formula should be M = (n-1) * (t/u), because the lateral shift is (n-1)*t, and the magnification comes from that shift divided by the object distance. So that would make sense.

So, the calculation is (1.5 -1) = 0.5. Multiply by t (0.5 cm) gives 0.25 cm. Divided by u (33 cm) gives 0.25/33 ≈ 0.007575, which is 0.7575%. So that's 0.76%, which is approximately 0.7% when rounded to one decimal place. So the correct answer would be A: 0.7%.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another approach: the angular magnification in this context is due to the refraction through the glass pane. When the object is placed close to the glass, the light is refracted, causing an apparent shift. The formula for angular magnification when looking through a thin medium is M = (n-1)*(t/u), where t is the thickness and u is the object distance. So that's the same as before.

Alternatively, if the pane is thick, maybe we have to consider more, but 5 mm is pretty thin, so the approximation holds.

So, using n=1.5, t=0.5 cm, u=33 cm:

M = 0.5 * 0.5 / 33 = 0.25 /33 ≈ 0.007575, which is 0.7575%.

Looking at the options, A is 0.7%, which is the closest. So the answer should be A.

To determine the percentage of angular magnification when viewing an object through a pane of glass, we use the formula for angular magnification:

\[
M \approx (n - 1) \cdot \frac{t}{u}
\]

Where:  
- \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass (approximately \( n = 1.5 \) for glass).  
- \( t \) is the thickness of the glass (given as \( 5 \, \text{mm} = 0.5 \, \text{cm} \)).  
- \( u \) is the object distance from the glass (given as \( 33 \, \text{cm} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate \( n - 1 \)
\[
n - 1 = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Plug values into the formula
\[
M \approx 0.5 \cdot \frac{0.5}{33}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the multiplication and division
\[
M \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25
\]
\[
M \approx \frac{0.25}{33} \approx 0.007575
\]

### Step 4: Convert to percentage
\[
M \approx 0.007575 \cdot 100 \approx 0.7575\%
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated angular magnification is approximately \( 0.76\% \), which is closest to \( 0.7\% \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 0.7%**
