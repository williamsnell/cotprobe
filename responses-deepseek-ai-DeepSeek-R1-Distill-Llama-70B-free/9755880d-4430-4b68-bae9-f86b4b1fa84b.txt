Okay, so I have this problem about a cylinder containing propane, and I need to find the maximum operating temperature. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the cylinder has a volume of 10 ft³ and a safe working pressure of 500 psig. I remember that psig means pounds per square inch gage pressure, so that's the pressure above atmospheric. I think the standard atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psia (pounds per square inch absolute). So the absolute pressure inside the cylinder when it's under 500 psig would be 500 + 14.7 = 514.7 psia.

Wait, wait, but when dealing with gas laws, we need to use absolute pressure and absolute temperature. So that's an important point. Got it.

The cylinder contains 1 lb-mole of propane. Propane is C3H8, but maybe the exact molecule isn't too important here. The key is that it's a gas, so the ideal gas law would apply. But wait, propane might not behave ideally at high pressures, but maybe the problem assumes ideal behavior. I'll go with that for now.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. P is pressure, V volume, n moles, R the gas constant, and T temperature in absolute units (like Kelvin or Rankine).

I know the volume is 10 ft³. I need to make sure all the units are consistent. The gas constant R has different values based on the units. Since the pressure is in psia and volume in ft³, I think R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·R). Let me confirm that—yes, that's right because R can be 10.7316 when using these units.

So plugging the numbers in. P is 514.7 psia, V is 10 ft³, n is 1 lb-mole. We're solving for T.

So rearranging the ideal gas law: T = (P V) / (n R).

Let me compute that. PV = 514.7 psia * 10 ft³ = 5147 psia·ft³.

n R is 1 * 10.7316 = 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·R).

So T = 5147 / 10.7316.

Let me do that division. 5147 ÷ 10.7316. Hmm, let's see. 10.7316 times 479 is roughly 5147 because 10 * 480 is 4800, and 0.7316 *480 is about 350. So 4800 + 350=5150. So approximately 480 R.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me calculate more accurately.

5147 divided by 10.7316. Let me compute step by step.

10.7316 * 479 = ?

10 *479 =4790, 0.7316*479. Let's compute 0.7*479= 335.3, 0.0316*479≈15.13. So total 335.3+15.13=350.43. So 4790 +350.43=5140.43. That's very close to 5147. So the difference is about 6.57. So 479 + (6.57 /10.7316) ≈ 479 + ~0.613 ≈ 479.613 R.

Wait, but wait, 10.7316 * 0.613 is approximately 6.58. So yes, about 479.6 R.

So T ≈ 479.6 R.

Now, to convert that to Fahrenheit, since we want the temperature in F. Remember, to convert from R to F, we subtract 459.67. So 479.6 R - 459.67 = ?

Let's compute that. 479.6 minus 459.67 is approximately 19.93 degrees F. So around 20 F?

Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the options are all in the hundreds. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me double-check the gas constant.

Oh wait! I think I might have mixed up the units for R. Because sometimes R is given as 10.7316 when the pressure is in psia, volume in cubic feet, and temperature in Rankine. So that should be correct. Wait, but the volume is in ft³, yes.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation.

PV = 514.7 psia * 10 ft³ = 5147 psia ft³.

n is 1, so nR is 10.7316 psia ft³/R.

So T = (5147) / (10.7316) = ?

Wait, 5147 divided by 10.7316. Let's compute it more accurately.

Let me use a calculator approach. 5147 ÷ 10.7316.

Let me approximate:

10.7316 * 480 = let's see, 10 *480=4800, 0.7316*480=350.368, so total 5150.368.

Wait, but our PV product is 5147, which is slightly less than 5150.368. So 480 would give us 5150.368, which is just a bit more than 5147.

So 5147 is 5150.368 - 3.368. So 3.368 /10.7316 ≈ 0.314.

So 480 - 0.314 ≈ 479.686 R.

So 479.686 R.

Now, converting R to F: T (F) = T (R) - 459.67.

So 479.686 -459.67= 20.016 F.

Wait, that's about 20 degrees F. But that's way lower than any of the options provided, which are all above 180 F. So something's very wrong here.

Wait, could I have mixed up something else? Let me think again.

Ah! Oh wait, maybe the volume was given in cubic feet, but for the ideal gas law, when using R=10.7316, the volume should be in cubic feet. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the pressure? The problem says 500 psig. So 500 plus 14.7 is 514.7 psia. That's correct.

Wait, but wait, propane's critical temperature is around 206 F (I remember it's a bit higher than that, maybe 210 F). So when the temperature is above the critical temperature, the gas cannot be liquefied, no matter the pressure. So if the temperature is higher than the critical temp, then the gas will always stay as gas, and the pressure would be determined by PV=nRT.

Wait, but in this problem, we're looking for the maximum operating temperature such that the propane is just a gas, not a liquid. So perhaps the maximum temperature is the critical temperature of propane. Because beyond that, no matter how much pressure you apply, it won't liquefy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum temperature where the propane can exist as a gas at the given pressure.

Wait, but the question says the cylinder contains 1 lb-mole of propane. So if the temperature is too high, the pressure would be higher than the safe working pressure. So we're to find the maximum T where P is 500 psig.

Wait, but according to the calculation, when T is about 20 F, the pressure is 500 psig. But that seems way off, because the options are all much higher. So clearly, I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the cylinder's pressure to be the vapor pressure of propane at that temperature. Because propane is a vapor that can condense into liquid if the temperature is too low, but if the temperature is too high, the vapor pressure is higher than the cylinder's safe pressure. So perhaps the maximum operating temperature is the temperature at which propane's vapor pressure equals 500 psig.

Wait, that makes more sense. Let me think again. So propane has a vapor pressure that depends on temperature. At higher temperatures, the vapor pressure increases. So the maximum temperature you can have without the pressure exceeding the safe limit is when the vapor pressure equals 500 psig.

So the question then becomes, what temperature corresponds to a vapor pressure of 500 psig for propane?

So I need to look up the vapor pressure of propane at various temperatures. I think that propane's vapor pressure at, say, 100 F is something like 183 psig. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might remember that at 100 F, the vapor pressure is around 183 psig, and it increases as temperature increases.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about these exact values, so perhaps I should think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the original approach using the ideal gas law was correct, but I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the calculation.

So T = (P V) / (n R).

P is 514.7 psia.

V is 10 ft³.

n is 1.

R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·R).

So T = (514.7 * 10) / (1 * 10.7316) = 5147 / 10.7316.

Let me compute that more accurately.

10.7316 * 480 = 5150.368 as before.

We have 5147, which is 3.368 less than 5150.368. So 480 - (3.368/10.7316) = 480 - 0.314 ≈ 479.686 R.

Convert to F: 479.686 - 459.67 = 20.016 F.

Hmm, that's around 20 F. But the options are all way higher, so clearly, I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, maybe the cylinder is containing propane as a gas, but the maximum temperature would be when the propane is just all in vapor phase at that pressure. So perhaps the cylinder's pressure is the vapor pressure of propane at that temperature. So when the temperature increases, the vapor pressure increases. So the maximum temperature is when the vapor pressure equals 500 psig. So we need to find the temperature where propane's vapor pressure is 500 psig.

I think the vapor pressure of propane at various temperatures can be found using tables or Antoine equation.

The Antoine equation is log10(P) = A - (B/(T + C)), where P is in mmHg and T is in Celsius. But I might get the constants wrong.

Alternatively, I remember that for propane, the vapor pressure at 100 F is about 183 psig. At higher temperatures, it's higher. Let me see if I can remember or estimate.

If at 100 F, it's 183 psig, then the vapor pressure increases with temperature.

Wait, but I think the critical temperature of propane is about 206 F. Beyond that, the gas cannot be liquefied, no matter the pressure. So at temperatures above 206 F, propane remains a gas regardless of pressure. So if the cylinder's pressure is 500 psig, which is well below the critical pressure (which for propane is around 616 psia or something like that), then the maximum temperature would be the critical temperature. Wait, but the critical pressure is higher, so perhaps that's not directly relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the critical temperature is the highest temperature at which the gas can be liquefied, regardless of pressure. So above the critical temperature, no amount of pressure will liquefy it. But in this problem, the propane is already in the cylinder as a gas, and we're looking for when it would start to liquefy, but that's when the pressure is higher than the vapor pressure at that temperature.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the temperature where the vapor pressure of propane is 500 psig. Because if the cylinder's pressure is 500 psig, the propane will start to condense into liquid when the temperature drops below the temperature corresponding to a vapor pressure of 500 psig. But since we're looking for the maximum operating temperature, perhaps that's the temperature where the vapor pressure is equal to the cylinder's pressure.

Wait, no, because at higher temperatures, the vapor pressure is higher. So if the cylinder's pressure is 500 psig, and the temperature increases, the vapor pressure increases. So if the temperature is higher than the temperature where vapor pressure is 500 psig, the pressure inside would exceed 500 psig, which is unsafe. Therefore, the maximum operating temperature is the temperature where propane's vapor pressure is exactly 500 psig. So if the temperature is higher than that, the pressure would exceed the safe limit.

So I need to find the temperature where propane's vapor pressure is 500 psig. Let's see.

I think I can use the Antoine equation for propane. The Antoine constants I found online (but I'm trying to remember) are A=3.3013, B=1063.5, C=233.0, valid for T between 273.15 K and 371.25 K (which is about 0°C to 98°C, or 32 F to 208 F).

The equation is log10 P = A - (B)/(T + C), where P is in mmHg.

Wait, but I need P in psig. Let me proceed step by step.

First, I need to find T where the vapor pressure P equals 500 psig. But wait, Antoine gives P in mmHg, so I'll need to convert 500 psig to mmHg.

Standard atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia, which is 760 mmHg. So 500 psig is 500 + 14.7 = 514.7 psia. Now, convert psia to mmHg: 514.7 psia * 760 mmHg / 14.7 psia ≈ 514.7 * 760 /14.7.

Wait, let me compute that.

514.7 *760 = let's see: 500*760=380,000, 14.7*760≈11,172. So total ≈ 391,172.

Divide by 14.7: 391172 /14.7 ≈ let's see, 14.7 *26,600 is about 390,600. So 26,600 + (572/14.7) ≈ 26,600 + ~38.9 ≈ 26,638.9 mmHg.

So P = 26,638.9 mmHg.

Now, using Antoine's equation:

log10(P) = 3.3013 - (1063.5)/(T + 233.0)

We have P=26,638.9 mmHg.

Compute log10(26,638.9). Let me see, log10(2.66389e4) ≈ 4.425 (since 10^4.425 ≈ 26,638.9).

So 4.425 = 3.3013 - (1063.5)/(T +233).

Rearranging:

4.425 -3.3013 = - (1063.5)/(T+233)

Which is 1.1237 = - (1063.5)/(T+233)

Multiply both sides by (T +233):

1.1237*(T +233) = -1063.5

So T +233 = -1063.5 / 1.1237 ≈ -1063.5 /1.1237 ≈ let's compute that.

1.1237 * 947 ≈ 1064 (since 1.1237 *900=1011.33; 1.1237*47≈52.8. So 1011.33+52.8=1064.13). So 947 would give 1064.13, but we have negative 1063.5, so it's approximately -947.

So T +233 ≈ -947 → T ≈ -947 -233 = -1180 K? That can't be right because the Antoine equation is only valid up to 371.25 K.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should invert the equation. Let me go back.

Wait, Antoine's equation is log10(P) = A - B/(T + C). So P is in mmHg.

We have P = 500 psig = 514.7 psia. To convert to mmHg, as before, 514.7 * 760 /14.7 ≈ 26,638.9 mmHg.

So log10(26,638.9) ≈ 4.425.

So 4.425 = 3.3013 - (1063.5)/(T +233).

Wait, 4.425 = 3.3013 - (1063.5)/(T +233).

So subtract 3.3013 from both sides:

4.425 -3.3013 = - (1063.5)/(T +233).

That gives 1.1237 = - (1063.5)/(T +233).

Multiply both sides by (T +233):

1.1237*(T +233) = -1063.5.

Then, (T +233) = -1063.5 /1.1237 ≈ -947.

So T = -947 -233 = -1180 K, which is impossible because temperature can't be negative in K in this context. So clearly, something's wrong here.

Wait, I think I messed up the Antoine equation's units or the way I applied it. Let me double-check the Antoine constants.

Upon more careful consideration, I think I may have the Antoine constants wrong. Let me try to recall correct values. Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach.

Another approach: look up vapor pressure of propane at certain temperatures.

I recall that at 100 F (approx 37.8 C), propane's vapor pressure is about 183 psig. At higher temperatures, it's higher.

Let me make a table in my mind:

Temp (F) | Vapor Pressure (psig)
--------------------------------
100      | 183
120      | ?
140      | ?
160      | ?
180      | ?
200      | ?

I think at 200 F, propane's vapor pressure is around 500 psig. Wait, that's probably the case, which would make the maximum operating temperature 200 F, option B.

Wait, but wait, when I thought about the ideal gas law earlier, I got a temperature of about 20 F, which is way lower. But that approach gave me a very low temperature, which doesn't match the options, so perhaps that approach was wrong, and the correct approach is to consider the vapor pressure.

So if at 200 F, the vapor pressure is 500 psig, then that would be the maximum temperature before the pressure would exceed the cylinder's safe limit.

Let me think again: if the cylinder is at a higher temperature than 200
