Question:

A plantiff sued a defendant for injuries suffered m a fall on the sidewalk of the defendant's home. The plaintiff's complaint alleged that the walk was covered by a thick sheet of ice, which had been negligently left there for several days by the defendant. In his answer, the defendant set forth that the ice formed overnight and that the plaintiff fell before the defendant had a chance to remove it. During the trial, a physician, whose office was next door to the defendant's home, testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice, which had been there for several days was at least two inches thick. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked the physician the following question: "During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?"Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, the physician's testimony will be ruled

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay evidence.
B: admissible, because the physician had personal knowledge of the plaintiff's injuries.
C: admissible, because it provides additional information about the plaintiff's condition.
D: admissible, because it sheds light on the plaintiff's physical condition at the time of the fall.
E: inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is not relevant to prove that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated.
F: inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is biased.
G: inadmissible, because the defendant's counsel failed to lay a proper foundation.
H: inadmissible, because it contradicts the defendant's statement.
I: admissible, because it is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.
J: admissible, because it helps to establish the timeline of events.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's break it down step by step. The scenario is a trial where the plaintiff sued the defendant for injuries from a fall on an icy sidewalk. The defendant's answer says the ice formed overnight and the plaintiff fell before the defendant could remove it. 

At the trial, a physician testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice had been there for several days, being two inches thick. Now, during cross-examination, the defense attorney asked the physician a question about whether the plaintiff told him during treatment that the fall was due to dizziness causing loss of equilibrium. The plaintiff's attorney objected, and we need to determine if the physician's testimony is admissible.

So the question is about the admissibility of this statement the plaintiff allegedly made to the physician. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I remember that statements made by a patient to a physician for diagnosis or treatment are admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. That's under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4). So if the statement was made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, it's not considered hearsay and is admissible.

In this case, the physician is being asked about what the plaintiff said during treatment. The statement explains why the plaintiff fellâ€”dizziness leading to loss of equilibrium. This seems relevant to the plaintiff's condition and the cause of the fall, which could affect the defendant's liability.

Wait, but the defense is trying to suggest that the fall wasn't due to the ice but perhaps the plaintiff's own dizziness. So they're trying to introduce this statement to show that the plaintiff's own condition caused the fall, which would negate the defendant's negligence as the proximate cause.

So the key issue is whether the statement is admissible. Since it was made during treatment, it's covered under 803(4). Therefore, the objection by the plaintiff's attorney should be overruled, and the testimony should be admissible.

Looking at the options, option I says it's admissible because it's reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. That fits because the plaintiff's statement about dizziness would help the physician diagnose and treat, perhaps indicating an inner ear issue or other medical condition.

Option D says it's admissible because it sheds light on the plaintiff's physical condition at the time of the fall. That's also true, but the more precise reason is under the hearsay exception for medical diagnosis.

Option A says it's inadmissible as hearsay, but that's incorrect because of the exception.

So the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I. The physician's testimony about the plaintiff's statement is admissible under the hearsay exception for statements made for diagnosis or treatment.

I
