Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the net cost of a television set after discounts. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The TV originally costs $120, and there are two discounts applied: 30% and 20%. Wait, but how are these discounts applied? Are they applied one after the other or combined? I think when you have multiple discounts, you apply them sequentially. So first apply one discount, then apply the second discount on the new amount.

Alright, let's start with the first discount of 30%. To find 30% of $120, I can calculate 0.3 * 120. Let me do that. 0.3 times 120 is 36. So the discount amount is $36. Subtracting that from $120 gives me $84. So after the first discount, the price is $84.

Now, the second discount is 20%. But wait, is this 20% off the original price or the already discounted price? I think it's off the already discounted price because usually, discounts are applied successively. So I need to find 20% of $84. Let's calculate that. 0.2 times 84 equals 16.8. So the second discount is $16.8.

Subtracting that from $84 gives me the final price. 84 minus 16.8 is... let me do the math. 84 minus 16 is 68, and then minus 0.8 is 67.2. So the final cost is $67.2.

Looking at the options, option J is $67.20, which matches my calculation. But wait, another thought: sometimes, multiple discounts might be combined and applied together. Let me check if that's the case here. If I combine the discounts, 30% and 20%, that would be a total discount of 50%. Wait, no, because discounts don't add up linearly when applied successively. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, if you have two discounts, you can calculate the total discount factor by multiplying (1 - discount1) * (1 - discount2). So that would be (0.7) * (0.8) = 0.56. Then 0.56 times 120 is 67.2, which is the same result. So either way, whether applying them one after the other or calculating the combined effect, I get the same final price.

So the correct answer should be J: $67.20.

The television set originally costs $120 and is discounted by 30% and then 20%. To calculate the net cost:

1. Apply the first discount of 30%:  
   \( 120 \times 0.3 = 36 \)  
   Subtract this from the original price:  
   \( 120 - 36 = 84 \).

2. Apply the second discount of 20% to the new price of $84:  
   \( 84 \times 0.2 = 16.8 \)  
   Subtract this from $84:  
   \( 84 - 16.8 = 67.2 \).

Thus, the net cost of the television set is $67.20. This matches option J.

J: $67.20
