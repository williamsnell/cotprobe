Okay, so I have this problem here about Joanna Moorman borrowing money, and I need to figure out how much interest she has to pay and the total amount due. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says she borrowed $2,000 at 9% interest, and the interest is calculated based on the actual number of days the loan was outstanding. She took the loan on April 12 and paid it back on July 11. So I need to calculate the number of days between these two dates.

Hmm, calculating days between dates can be tricky. I remember that for such calculations, I have to consider the month lengths. Let me list the months involved: April, May, June, and part of July.

Wait, wait. The loan was taken on April 12, so April has 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30 is how many days? Let's see: 30 minus 12 is 18, but since the 12th is the starting day, I think I need to add 1. So 30-12=18, then 18+1=19 days in April.

Then comes May, which has 31 days. So that's 31 days.

Next is June, which has 30 days.

And then July. She's paying on July 11, so that's 11 days into July, including the 11th?

Wait, but when you count the days, do you include both the start and end dates? Or just up to the day before? Oh right, because the loan is outstanding from April 12 to July 11. So the day she pays is the last day the loan is outstanding. So I should include that day.

Wait, actually, when calculating the number of days between two dates, you subtract the start date from the end date. But sometimes whether you include both start and end days can vary. Let me think again.

Let me count each month step by step:

April: from April 12 to April 30. So that's 30 - 12 = 18 days. But since the 12th is included, it's 19 days in April.

May: 31 days.

June: 30 days.

July: 11 days (since she paid on July 11, so that day is counted).

So adding them up: 19 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 11 (July) = 91 days. Wait, but wait a minute. Because the loan was taken on April 12, so the first day is counted as day 0 or day 1? Hmm, I think in most cases, the day you take the loan is counted as day 1. So from April 12 to April 30 is 19 days (including the 12th). Then May has 31, June 30, and July 11. So 19 + 31 = 50, plus 30 is 80, plus 11 is 91 days.

Wait, but let me double-check. If I go from April 12 to April 13, that's 2 days. So April 12 is day 1, April 13 day 2, etc. So from 12 to 30: 30-12=18, plus 1 gives 19 days. So that part is right.

So total days: 19 + 31 + 30 + 11 = 91 days. So option a is 91 days.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 91 days, option A is 87, and so on.

Now, part b is the amount of interest. The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where P is principal, r is rate, t is time in years.

But wait, the interest is 9% per annum, but the time is in days. So I need to convert days into a fraction of a year.

So 91 days. Assuming it's not a leap year, 365 days.

So t = 91 / 365.

So I = 2000 * 0.09 * (91/365).

Let me compute that.

First, 2000 * 0.09 is 180.

Then 180 * (91/365) = ?

Let me compute 91/365 first. 365 ÷ 91 is approximately 4. So 91/365 ≈ 0.2493.

So 180 * 0.2493 ≈ 44.674, approximately $44.67.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option G: $44.50, but C says $50, which is too much. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the days.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount the dates.

Wait another approach: using the number of days from April 12 to July 11.

April has 30 days. So April 12 to April 30 is 19 days (including 12th).

May: 31 days.

June: 30 days.

July: 11 days (up to and including July 11).

So 19 + 31 = 50, plus 30 is 80, plus 11 is 91 days.

Alternative way: Maybe the end date isn't inclusive. Wait, for example, if you borrow on day 1 and repay on day 1, that's zero days? No, that can't be right. Usually, if you have a loan from day 1 to day 2, that's considered 1 day. So I think the calculation of 91 days is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question counts the days as the actual days the money is borrowed. So from April 12 to July 11 is 91 days. So that part seems correct.

Wait another thought: Maybe July 11 is the day of payment, so the loan was outstanding for 91 days minus 1, so 90 days? Because when you pay on day 91, that's the last day. So the interest is calculated up to July 10. Hmm, that's possible.

Let me think: If I take a loan on day 1, and pay on day 1, is that 0 days? Or 1 day? I think it's 1 day. So from April 12 to April 13 is 2 days. So from April 12 to July 11 is 91 days.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated as the exact number of days, not including the end date. So when you pay on July 11, the loan was active until July 10, so 90 days.

Wait, that makes sense because the payment is made on July 11, so up to July 10 is the period. So the days would be 90.

So let me recalculate the days.

April: 30 -12 = 18, plus 1 is 19 days.

May: 31

June: 30

July: 11 days? Or up to July 10, which is 10 days. Because July 11 is the payment date.

Wait, so from April 12 to July 11 is 91 days including both start and end. But if the payment is made on July 11, perhaps the interest is only for the days up to July 10, making it 90 days.

So 19 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 10 (July) = 90 days.

Ah, that would change things. So then the number of days is 90.

So part a would be 90 days.

Then, part b, the interest would be I = 2000 * 0.09 * (90/365).

So 2000 * 0.09 = 180.

90/365 is approximately 0.24658.

180 * 0.24658 ≈ 44.38, approximately $44.38.

Looking at the options, option G has 89 days, $44.50. Option D has 90 days, $45.

Wait, but if I calculate it more accurately. 90 divided by 365 is 90/365. Let's compute 90 * 0.09 *2000/(365).

Wait, wait: 2000 * 0.09 is 180, as before. Now, 90/365 = 0.246575... So 180 * 0.246575 ≈ 44.38.

Hmm, so approximately $44.38. The options have $44.50 (option G), but that's for 89 days. Option D is $45 for 90 days.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Compute 90 * 0.09 = 8.1% per year. So per day, it's 8.1% / 365.

So per day interest: (2000 * 0.09)/365 = 180/365 ≈ 0.49315 per day.

So 90 days * 0.49315 ≈ 44.384, which is about $44.38.

But the options don't have $44.38. Let me look.

Option G: 89 days, $44.50.

Option D: 90 days, $45.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it exactly.

Compute 2000 * 0.09 *90 /365.

2000 * 0.09 is 180.

180 *90 = 16200.

16200 /365 = let's compute that.

365 × 44 is 16060. 16200-16060=140.

140/365 ≈ 0.38356.

So 44 + 0.38356 ≈ 44.38.

So approximately $44.38.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G, $44.50, but that's with 89 days. Option D is $45, 90 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the days are 91. Let me recalculate that.

If days are 91, then 91/365 * 180 = (91 *180)/365.

91 × 180 = 16,380.

16,380 /365.

365 × 44 = 16,060. 16,380-16,060=320.

320/365 ≈ 0.8767.

So 44.8767, approximately $44.88.

Which is not exactly matching any option.

Wait, maybe the interest is being calculated with 360 days in a year? Sometimes, in some financial calculations, people use 360 days instead of 365 for simplicity.

Let me try that.

If using 360 days:

For 90 days: (2000 * 0.09 *90)/360 = (180 *90)/360 = (16200)/360=45.

Ah, exactly $45. So that matches option D: 90 days, $45, total $2045.

Because 2000 +45 =2045.

Looking back, the options: option D is 90 days, $45, $2045.

So why is that? Because if we consider 360 days a year, the calculation becomes exact.

So perhaps the question assumes a 360-day year for calculating interest. That would make the interest exactly $45 when the days are 90.

So the days are 90, the interest is $45, and the total is $2045.

So that would be option D.

But wait, the initial question says "actual number of days". So perhaps the exact days are counted, and the calculation uses 365 days.

In that case, the interest would be approximately $44.38, which isn't exactly any of the options. So perhaps the intended approach is to use 360 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest calculation uses 365 days, but the options are rounded.

Wait, the options: option G is 89 days, $44.50. Option D is 90 days, $45.

So perhaps the correct number of days is 90, and the interest is $45. So the answer would be D.

But then the total would be $2045.

So looking at the options, the answer should be D.

But wait, I thought the days were 91 earlier. But if the payment is on July 11, perhaps it's 90 days because the last day isn't counted.

Hmm, perhaps I should cross-verify.

Alternative approach: Use the formula for the number of days between two dates.

April 12 to July 11.

April: 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30: 30 -12 = 18 days, but including April 12, that's 19 days.

May: 31 days.

June: 30 days.

July: 11 days (up to July 11).

Wait, if you include the start and end dates, that's 19 +31 +30 +11 =91 days.

But if the end date is the day of payment, perhaps we exclude it, making it 90 days.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of it as a timeline.

Day 1: April 12 (borrowed)

Day 2: April 13

...

Day 19: April 30

Then May 1 is day 20.

So May has 31 days: day 20 to day 50.

June 1 is day 51, June 30 is day 80.

July 1 is day 81.

July 11 is day 91.

So the payment on July 11 is day 91.

So the loan was active for 91 days, including the start and end dates.

So the interest should be calculated for 91 days.

In that case, the interest would be 2000 * 0.09 * (91/365) = ?

As above, that's approximately $44.88.

Which isn't exactly an option, but option C is $50 for 91 days.

Wait, but let me compute 91 days with 360.

2000 *0.09*91/360= 2000*0.09=180; 180*91=16380; 16380/360=45.5.

Wait, 45.5. So $45.50.

But that's not an option either. Wait, no option C is 91 days, $50, which would be 2000*(0.09)*(91/182)= because 91 is half of 182, so 4.5%. 2000*0.045=90, but option C is $50. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as 9% per annum, and they are using the exact fraction.

Wait, perhaps the way to calculate is:

I = P * r * t, where t is in years.

t = 91/365.

So I = 2000 * 0.09 * (91/365) = 2000 * 0.09 * 0.249315 ≈ 2000 * 0.02242 ≈ 44.85.

So approximately $44.85. None of the options exactly match that.

Looking back at the options:

A: 87 days, $43.50, $2043.50

B: 88 days, $48, $2048

C:91 days, $50, $2050

D:90 days, $45, $2045

E:92 days, $46, $2046

F:92 days, $49, $2049

G:89 days, $44.50, $2044.50

H:89 days, $40, $2040

I:93 days, $42, $2042

J:95 days, $47.50, $2047.50

Hmm, the closest to my calculation of 90 days and $44.38 is option G:89 days, $44.50, but that's 89 days. Alternatively, option D is 90 days, $45.

Wait, but perhaps the exact calculation gives $45 when using 360 days, which is why option D is correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is D:90 days, $45, total $2045.

Alternatively, let's compute it with 360 days.

t=90/360=0.25.

So I=2000 *0.09 *0.25=2000 *0.0225=45. So exactly $45.

So that makes sense. So the number of days is 90, and the interest is $45, making the total $2045.

So the answer would be option D.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of days Joanna Moorman paid interest, the amount of interest, and the total amount due. The loan was taken on April 12 and paid back on July 11, with an annual interest rate of 9%. The interest is calculated based on the actual number of days the loan was outstanding.

### Part (a): Number of Days
- **April**: From April 12 to April 30 is 19 days (including the 12th).
- **May**: 31 days.
- **June**: 30 days.
- **July**: 11 days (up to and including July 11).

Adding these together:  
\[
19 \, \text{(April)} + 31 \, \text{(May)} + 30 \, \text{(June)} + 11 \, \text{(July)} = 91 \, \text{days}.
\]

However, if the payment date (July 11) is not counted as a day the loan was outstanding, the total number of days would be 90. This is the interpretation that aligns with the final answer.

### Part (b): Amount of Interest
The formula for simple interest is:  
\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t,
\]  
where \(P = 2000\), \(r = 0.09\), and \(t = \frac{\text{days}}{365}\) (or 360 days if using a simplified financial year).

1. **Using 365 days**:  
   \[
   t = \frac{90}{365} \approx 0.24658,
   \]  
   \[
   I = 2000 \cdot 0.09 \cdot 0.24658 \approx 44.38.
   \]

2. **Using 360 days**:  
   \[
   t = \frac{90}{360} = 0.25,
   \]  
   \[
   I = 2000 \cdot 0.09 \cdot 0.25 = 45.
   \]

The exact calculation using 360 days gives \(I = 45\), which matches the options provided.

### Part (c): Total Amount Due
The total amount due is the principal plus interest:  
\[
\text{Total} = 2000 + 45 = 2045.
\]

### Final Answer
The correct option is **D**: 90 days, $45 interest, and a total of $2045.  

**Answer: D**
