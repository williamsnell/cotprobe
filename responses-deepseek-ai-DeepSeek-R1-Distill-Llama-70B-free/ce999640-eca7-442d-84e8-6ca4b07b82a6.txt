Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the data rate for a motion video. Hmm, let's see. The video is 352x288 pixels, in RGB, at 30 frames per second. Oh wait, and it's 30 seconds long, but I think that's just the total duration, but maybe not needed for the data rate per second.

Wait, data rate is usually per second, right? So I think I should calculate the bits per second. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, each frame is 352 by 288 pixels. So the number of pixels per frame is 352 multiplied by 288. Let me calculate that. 352 times 288... Let me do the math step by step.

352 * 200 is 70,400. 352 * 88 is... 352 * 80 is 28,160, and 352 * 8 is 2,816. So 28,160 + 2,816 is 30,976. So total pixels per frame would be 70,400 + 30,976 = 101,376 pixels per frame.

Wait, no, wait. Because 352 * 288 is 352 multiplied by 288. Let me compute 352*288 properly. Maybe I should break it down.

288 is 200 + 88. So 352*200=70,400. 352*88: Let me compute 352 * 80 = 28,160 and 352 * 8 = 2,816. So 28,160 + 2,816 = 30,976. So 70,400 + 30,976 = 101,376 pixels per frame. Got that right.

Now, each pixel is RGB, which is 3 bytes per pixel, I think. Because R, G, B each take one byte (8 bits). So 3 bytes per pixel. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, 1 byte is 8 bits. So each color component is typically 8 bits, so each pixel is 3*8=24 bits. Oh wait, right, 24 bits per pixel.

So per frame, the number of bits is 101,376 pixels * 24 bits per pixel. Let me compute that. 101,376 * 24.

Let me break it down: 100,000 *24 = 2,400,000. 1,376 *24: 1,000*24=24,000; 376*24. 300*24=7,200, 76*24=1,824. So 7,200 + 1,824 =9,024. So 24,000 +9,024=33,024. So total is 2,400,000 +33,024=2,433,024 bits per frame.

Wait, no, wait. 101,376 is 352*288. So 101,376 *24 = ?

Let me compute 101,376 *24:

Compute 101,376 *20 = 2,027,520.

Compute 101,376 *4 = 405,504.

Add them together: 2,027,520 +405,504 =2,433,024 bits per frame. Yep.

Now, the frame rate is 30 frames per second. So the total data rate is bits per frame multiplied by frames per second.

So 2,433,024 bits/frame *30 frames/s = 73,090,720 bits per second.

But wait, the question asks for megabits per second (Mbits/s). Oh right, because 1 megabit is 1 million bits, or 1e6 bits.

So 73,090,720 bits/s divided by 1e6 gives us 73.09072 megabits per second.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, 352 *288 is indeed 101,376. 101,376 *24 = 2,433,024 bits per frame. Multiply by 30: 2,433,024 *30 = 73,090,720 bits/s. Divide by 1e6 to get 73.09072 Mbits/s.

Looking at the options, option I is 73.1. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me make sure all the steps are correct. Another way: Let's compute the total data per second.

Each frame is 352x288 =101,376 pixels. Each pixel is 3 bytes (24 bits). So per frame, 101,376 *3 = 304,128 bytes. Multiply by 30 frames per second: 304,128 *30 =9,123,840 bytes per second.

Convert to megabytes per second: 9,123,840 / (1024 * 1024) ≈ let's compute 9,123,840 / 1,048,576 ≈ approximately 8.7 MB/s. But wait, that's megabytes. To get megabits, multiply by 8, because 1 byte is 8 bits. So 8.7 *8 ≈69.6 Mbits/s. Wait, that's different. Wait, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, I'm getting two different results. Hmm. Let me figure out where I went wrong.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute the byte approach.

Wait, 352x288 pixels per frame. Each pixel is 3 bytes.

So per frame, 101,376 *3 = 304,128 bytes.

30 frames per second: 304,128 *30 =9,123,840 bytes/s.

Convert to megabytes: 9,123,840 / (1024*1024) = 9,123,840 /1,048,576 ≈ approximately 8.7 MB/s. So 8.7 megabytes per second.

To get megabits, multiply by 8: 8.7 *8 =69.6 Mbits/s. Wait, that's option A.

But earlier I got 73.09072 Mbits/s when calculating in bits. Now I'm confused.

Wait, this discrepancy is because one approach uses bits and the other uses bytes. Let me make sure I'm being consistent.

Wait, let me try again.

Approach 1: Calculating in bits.

Each pixel is 24 bits (3 bytes). So per frame: 101,376 *24 =2,433,024 bits. Multiply by 30: 2,433,024 *30 =73,090,720 bits/s.

73,090,720 bits/s is 73.09072 Mbits/s, which rounds to 73.1. So option I.

Approach 2: Calculating in bytes.

Each pixel is 3 bytes. So per frame: 101,376 *3 =304,128 bytes.

30 frames/s: 304,128 *30 =9,123,840 bytes/s.

Convert bytes to bits: 9,123,840 *8 =73,090,720 bits/s. Which is same as before.

So 73,090,720 bits/s is 73.09072 Mbits/s.

Wait, so why did I get 69.6 earlier? Oh, because I must have made a mistake in the byte approach steps. Let me check.

Wait, 9,123,840 bytes/s is equal to 9,123,840 *8 =73,090,720 bits/s. So that's 73.09072 Mbits/s.

Wait, so then why when I converted 9,123,840 bytes/s to megabytes, I got 8.7 MB/s. 9,123,840 / (1024 *1024) = 9,123,840 /1,048,576 ≈ 8.7 MB/s. Then 8.7 MB/s *8 =69.6 Mbits/s? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, because 1 MB is 1e6 bytes, but 1 MiB is 1024^2 bytes, which is why I used 1,048,576.

Wait, but 9,123,840 bytes/s is 9.12384 megabytes per second (using 1 MB =1e6 bytes). Because 9,123,840 /1e6 =9.12384 MB/s. Then 9.12384 *8 =73.09072 Mbits/s.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. When I used 1,048,576 (which is 1024^2), I was calculating mebibytes per second, not megabytes. So perhaps I should have used 1e6 for MB/s, not 1,048,576.

So 9,123,840 bytes/s equals 9,123,840 /1e6 =9.12384 megabytes per second (MB/s) [using decimal definitions, where 1 MB =1e6 bytes].

Then, since 1 byte is 8 bits, 9.12384 MB/s =9.12384 *8 =73.09072 Mbits/s.

Ah, so that makes sense. So regardless of the approach, I get 73.09 Mbits/s, which is 73.1 when rounded to three significant figures.

Looking back at the options, option I is 73.1. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but why did I get a different number when I used 1,048,576? Because that's mebibytes. So 9,123,840 /1,048,576 ≈8.7 mebibytes per second. Then 8.7 *8 =69.6 Mbits/s, which is option A. But that's wrong because the question specifies MBits/s, which refers to megabits, not mebibits. Wait, no, the unit is Mbits/s. So whether using decimal or binary prefixes, the approach using bits directly is more straightforward and less error-prone.

So the correct calculation is 73.09072 Mbits/s, which rounds to 73.1. So the correct option is I.

I think I've got it. So the answer should be I.

To calculate the data rate for the given motion-video, we start by determining the number of pixels per frame. The video has a resolution of 352 × 288 pixels, so:

\[
352 \times 288 = 101,376 \, \text{pixels per frame}.
\]

Each pixel is represented in RGB format, which uses 24 bits per pixel (8 bits for each of the three color channels: red, green, and blue). Therefore, the total number of bits per frame is:

\[
101,376 \, \text{pixels/frame} \times 24 \, \text{bits/pixel} = 2,433,024 \, \text{bits/frame}.
\]

The video plays at 30 frames per second, so the total data rate in bits per second is:

\[
2,433,024 \, \text{bits/frame} \times 30 \, \text{frames/second} = 73,090,720 \, \text{bits/second}.
\]

To convert this to megabits per second (Mbits/s), we divide by \( 10^6 \) (since 1 megabit = \( 10^6 \) bits):

\[
73,090,720 \, \text{bits/second} \div 10^6 = 73.09072 \, \text{Mbits/second}.
\]

Rounding to three significant figures, the data rate is:

\[
73.1 \, \text{Mbits/second}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: 73.1**

Answer: I
