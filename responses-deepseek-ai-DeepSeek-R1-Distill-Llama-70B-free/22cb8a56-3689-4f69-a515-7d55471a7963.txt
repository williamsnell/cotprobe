Okay, so I've got this question about double fertilization in flowering plants. Hmm, I remember that double fertilization is a key process in angiosperms. Let me think about what I learned in biology class.

So, the question says that one sperm unites with the egg to form a zygote. That zygote will eventually develop into the embryo, right? I'm pretty sure the embryo is part of the seed. But wait, what's the other part?

Oh right, there's a second sperm involved. I think it doesn't fertilize another egg. Instead, it fuses with something called the polar nuclei. Polar nuclei... I remember those are in the embryo sac. Oh wait, the embryo sac has two polar nuclei, and when the sperm unites with them, they form something else.

Oh yeah! The fusion of the sperm with the polar nuclei leads to the formation of the endosperm. The endosperm is the tissue that provides nutrients to the developing plant, kind of like a food storage area. So the first sperm and egg make the zygote (which becomes the embryo), and the second sperm and polar nuclei make the endosperm.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one refers to this structure. Let's see the options again:

A: megagametophyte - Wait, the megagametophyte is the female gametophyte, like the embryo sac. So that's not it.

B: embryo - That's from the first fertilization, so that's not the second part.

C: microgametophyte - That's the male gametophyte, like the pollen grain. Not relevant here.

D: perisperm - I'm not too sure about this one. I think perisperm is related to the nucellus, but not endosperm.

E: seed coat - That's the outer layer of the seed, developed from the ovule's integuments. Not related to the second fertilization.

F: cotyledon - That's part of the embryo, like the seed leaf. So not the right answer.

G: endosperm - Yes, that's the one formed by the second fertilization.

H: epidermis - That's a layer of cells, like the skin, not related to this process.

I: endodermis - That's a type of tissue in plants, part of the ground tissue, but not the structure formed here.

J: seed embryo - That's the embryo again, so not the second part.

So the correct answer should be G: endosperm.

Double fertilization in flowering plants involves two key processes. First, one sperm unites with the egg to form a zygote, which develops into the embryo. Second, another sperm fuses with the polar nuclei in the embryo sac, leading to the formation of the endosperm. The endosperm is a nutrient-rich tissue that supports the growth of the embryo during seed development.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Megagametophyte** refers to the female gametophyte (embryo sac) and is not the structure formed by the second fertilization.  
- **B: Embryo** is formed by the first fertilization (sperm and egg) and is not the result of the second fertilization.  
- **C: Microgametophyte** is the male gametophyte (pollen grain) and is unrelated to the process.  
- **D: Perisperm** is derived from the nucellus and is not the product of the second fertilization.  
- **E: Seed coat** develops from the ovule's integuments and is unrelated to the second fertilization.  
- **F: Cotyledon** is part of the embryo and not the result of the second fertilization.  
- **G: Endosperm** is formed by the fusion of the second sperm with the polar nuclei, making it the correct answer.  
- **H: Epidermis** is a tissue layer and unrelated to this process.  
- **I: Endodermis** is a type of ground tissue and not relevant here.  
- **J: Seed embryo** refers to the embryo, which is formed by the first fertilization.

The correct answer is **G: Endosperm**.

Answer: G
