Okay, so I have this problem where Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice, and I need to find the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled. If they're the same, that number is considered the larger. Hmm, expected value problems can be tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that the expected value is just the average outcome if we were to perform the experiment many times. So I need to calculate the average of the maximum values from all possible rolls of two dice.

Each die has numbers from 1 to 6. When rolling two dice, there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Each outcome is equally likely since the dice are fair.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum of the two. So for each possible pair (a, b), where a is the result of the first die and b the second, the maximum is max(a,b). I need to find the average of all these max(a,b) values.

One approach is to list all possible outcomes and calculate the max for each, then sum them up and divide by 36. But that sounds time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I think using probability might help. The expected value E can be calculated by summing over all possible values k multiplied by the probability that the maximum is k. So E = sum from k=1 to 6 of [k * P(max = k)].

Yes, that makes sense. So I need to find P(max = k) for each k from 1 to 6.

How do I compute P(max = k)? Well, the maximum being k means that both dice are less than or equal to k, and at least one die is equal to k. So, it's the probability that both are ≤k minus the probability that both are ≤(k-1). Because P(max ≤k) is (k/6)^2, since each die has a k/6 chance to be ≤k, and both must be.

So P(max = k) = P(max ≤k) - P(max ≤k-1) = (k²/36) - ((k-1)²)/36) = (2k -1)/36.

Wait, let me check that. For example, for k=1, P(max=1) would be (1^2 - 0^2)/36 = 1/36. Which makes sense, because the only outcome is (1,1), which is 1 out of 36.

For k=2, P(max=2) would be (4 - 1)/36 = 3/36 = 1/12. Let's see, the outcomes where max is 2 are (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). That's 3 outcomes, so yes 3/36.

Similarly, for k=3, P(max=3) = (9-4)/36 = 5/36. The outcomes are when at least one die is 3, and the other is ≤3. Let's count: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (1,3), (2,3). That's 5, so correct.

So in general, P(max=k) = (2k -1)/36.

Wait, let me test for k=6. (2*6 -1)/36 = 11/36. Correct, because the number of outcomes where max is 6 is the total number of outcomes where at least one die is 6. There are 11 such outcomes: (6,1) to (6,6) and (1,6) to (5,6). So 6 +5=11. So 11/36, which matches.

So the formula seems correct.

So now, the expected value E is sum from k=1 to 6 of [k * (2k -1)/36 ].

So E = [1*(2*1 -1) + 2*(2*2 -1) + 3*(2*3 -1) + ... +6*(2*6 -1)] /36.

Let me compute each term:

For k=1: 1*(2-1)=1*1=1
k=2: 2*(4-1)=2*3=6
k=3:3*(6-1)=3*5=15
k=4:4*(8-1)=4*7=28
k=5:5*(10-1)=5*9=45
k=6:6*(12-1)=6*11=66

Now sum these up: 1 +6=7; 7+15=22; 22+28=50; 50+45=95; 95+66=161.

So E=161/36.

Wait, let me double-check the sum: 1 +6 is 7, plus15 is 22, plus28 is 50, plus45 is 95, plus66 is 161. So yes, 161.

So E=161/36.

Looking at the options, option F is 161/36, and option C is 161/24, which is larger. Option D is 161/18, which is larger. So correct answer is F.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula.

Alternative approach: For each possible value of k, the number of times k is the maximum is (2k-1). Because for k=1, it's 1 case; k=2, 3 cases; k=3,5; etc., which adds up to 1+3+5+7+9+11 =36, which makes sense as the total number of outcomes.

So the sum would be sum_{k=1}^6 k*(2k-1) = sum_{k=1}^6 (2k² -k).

Which is 2*sum(k²) - sum(k).

Sum(k²) from 1 to6 is 1+4+9+16+25+36=91.

Sum(k) from 1 to6 is 21.

So 2*91=182, minus 21 is 161. So yes, 161/36 is correct.

To determine the expected value of the larger of two numbers rolled on fair six-sided dice, we first recognize that there are 36 possible outcomes, each equally likely. The expected value \( E \) is calculated by summing over all possible values \( k \) (from 1 to 6) multiplied by the probability \( P(\text{max} = k) \), where \( \text{max} = k \) means the larger of the two numbers is \( k \).

The probability \( P(\text{max} = k) \) is given by:

\[
P(\text{max} = k) = P(\text{max} \leq k) - P(\text{max} \leq k-1)
\]

Since \( P(\text{max} \leq k) = \left(\frac{k}{6}\right)^2 \), we find:

\[
P(\text{max} = k) = \frac{k^2}{36} - \frac{(k-1)^2}{36} = \frac{2k - 1}{36}
\]

Now, the expected value \( E \) is:

\[
E = \sum_{k=1}^6 k \cdot P(\text{max} = k) = \sum_{k=1}^6 k \cdot \frac{2k - 1}{36}
\]

Expanding the terms:

\[
E = \frac{1 \cdot (2 \cdot 1 - 1) + 2 \cdot (2 \cdot 2 - 1) + 3 \cdot (2 \cdot 3 - 1) + 4 \cdot (2 \cdot 4 - 1) + 5 \cdot (2 \cdot 5 - 1) + 6 \cdot (2 \cdot 6 - 1)}{36}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
1 \cdot 1 = 1, \quad 2 \cdot 3 = 6, \quad 3 \cdot 5 = 15, \quad 4 \cdot 7 = 28, \quad 5 \cdot 9 = 45, \quad 6 \cdot 11 = 66
\]

Summing these values:

\[
1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66 = 161
\]

Thus, the expected value is:

\[
E = \frac{161}{36}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**F: \(\frac{161}{36}\)**
