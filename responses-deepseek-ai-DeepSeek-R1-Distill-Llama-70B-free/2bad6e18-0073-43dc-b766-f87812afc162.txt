Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the de Broglie wavelength of an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question says the electron has a kinetic energy of 100 eV. The mass of the electron is given as 9.11e-28 grams. I remember the de Broglie wavelength formula is lambda equals h over mv, where h is Planck's constant. But wait, I think there's another approach when dealing with kinetic energy. Oh right, maybe I can find the momentum first using the kinetic energy.

So kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². But I also know that momentum p is mv. So maybe I can express p in terms of KE. Let's see, KE = p²/(2m). Oh yeah, that makes sense because if p is mv, then v is p/m, so substituting into KE gives (p²)/(2m). So rearranging that, p equals sqrt(2mKE).

Wait, but the KE is given in eV, and I need to convert that into joules because the units have to match. I remember 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 100 eV would be 100 * 1.602e-19 J, which is 1.602e-17 J.

So plugging into p = sqrt(2mKE). The mass m is 9.11e-28 grams, but wait, grams are 1e-3 kg, right? So converting that, m = 9.11e-31 kg.

Wait, let me calculate that. 9.11e-28 grams is 9.11e-31 kg. Yep.

So p = sqrt(2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 1.602e-17 J). Let me compute that inside the square root.

First, 2 * 9.11e-31 is about 1.822e-30. Multiply that by 1.602e-17. Let's see, 1.822e-30 * 1.602e-17 = approximately 2.92e-47. So p is sqrt(2.92e-47) which is around 5.4e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, but let me do the calculation more accurately.

Wait, 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30. 1.822e-30 * 1.602e-17 = let's multiply the coefficients: 1.822 * 1.602 ≈ 2.920. The exponents are 10^(-30-17) = 10^-47. So 2.920e-47. Square root of that is sqrt(2.920e-47) = sqrt(2.920) * 1e-23.5. Because sqrt(1e-47) is 1e-23.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.92) is about 1.7086. So p = 1.7086e-23.5 kg·m/s. Wait, 1e-23.5 is the same as 1e-23 * sqrt(1e-1) ) because 23.5 is 23 + 0.5. So sqrt(1e-1)=0.316. So 1e-23.5 is 3.16e-24. So p ≈ 1.7086 * 3.16e-24 ≈ let's see, 1.7 *3 is 5.1, 0.08 *3 is about 0.24. So around 5.34e-24 kg·m/s. Hmm, I think I'm complicating this. Alternatively, I can calculate it numerically.

But wait, maybe I should just proceed with the formula for the wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength is h/(p). So h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

So lambda = 6.626e-34 / (5.4e-24) ≈ let's approximate. 6.6e-34 divided by 5.4e-24 is roughly (6.6/5.4) * 1e-10. 6.6/5.4 is about 1.222. So lambda ≈ 1.222e-10 meters. Oh wait, 1e-10 meters is 1 Angstrom (Å), since 1 Å is 1e-10 m. So 1.222e-10 m is 1.222 Å. Looking at the options, option C is 1.626, option A is 1.326, G is 1.226. Wait, my approximation was around 1.22, so maybe G is the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: I recall a shortcut formula for electrons when KE is given in eV. The formula is lambda (in Å) ≈ sqrt(150/(KE in eV)). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, another version: lambda (Å) = h / sqrt(2mE). Let me see.

Wait, the formula for de Broglie wavelength can be written as lambda = h / sqrt(2mE), where E is the kinetic energy. Wait, but E has to be in joules, right? Because h is in J·s, m in kg.

Wait, but maybe there's a version where when E is in eV, you can use different constants. Let me think. Let me rederive the formula.

We have:

lambda = h / (sqrt(2mE))

Where E is kinetic energy. So E in joules.

But since E is given in eV, let's convert E to joules. So E = 100 eV = 100 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-17 J.

So m is 9.11e-31 kg.

So 2mE = 2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 1.602e-17 J.

Calculate that: 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-17: 1.822e-30 * 1.602e-17 = (1.822 * 1.602) * 1e-47. 1.822 *1.602 is approximately 2.921. So 2mE = 2.921e-47 kg²·m²/s².

So sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2.921e-47) = sqrt(2.921) * 1e-23.5 ≈ 1.7096e-23.5 kg·m/s. Wait, 1e-23.5 is 3.16e-24. So 1.7096 * 3.16e-24 ≈ 5.4e-24 kg·m/s.

Then lambda = h / p. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So 6.626e-34 / 5.4e-24 = (6.626 /5.4 ) * 1e-10.

6.626 /5.4 is approximately 1.227. So lambda ≈ 1.227e-10 m, which is 1.227 Å.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.226 Å, which is very close. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but I remember another version where the formula might have a different coefficient when using eV. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as lambda (in Å) = 12.26 / sqrt(E in eV). Because plugging in E=100 eV, lambda would be 12.26 /10 = 1.226 Å. Yes, that's a common shortcut formula. So with E=100 eV, it's 12.26 / sqrt(100) = 12.26 /10 = 1.226 Å.

So that would be option G:1.226 Å.

To determine the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 100 eV, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE}}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the electron),
- \( E = 100 \, \text{eV} \) (kinetic energy in electron volts).

### Step 1: Convert kinetic energy to joules
Since \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), the kinetic energy in joules is:

\[
E = 100 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 1.602 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \sqrt{2mE} \)
First, calculate \( 2mE \):

\[
2mE = 2 \times (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) \times (1.602 \times 10^{-17}) = 2.921 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{kg}^2 \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

Now, take the square root:

\[
\sqrt{2mE} = \sqrt{2.921 \times 10^{-47}} = 1.709 \times 10^{-23.5} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength
Using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE}} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.709 \times 10^{-23.5}} = (6.626 / 1.709) \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\lambda \approx 1.227 \, \text{Å}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify using the shortcut formula
A commonly used shortcut formula for the de Broglie wavelength of an electron when the kinetic energy is in eV is:

\[
\lambda \, (\text{in Å}) = \frac{12.26}{\sqrt{E \, (\text{in eV})}}.
\]

For \( E = 100 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{12.26}{\sqrt{100}} = \frac{12.26}{10} = 1.226 \, \text{Å}.
\]

### Final Answer
Both methods yield a wavelength of approximately \( 1.226 \, \text{Å} \), which corresponds to **option G**.
