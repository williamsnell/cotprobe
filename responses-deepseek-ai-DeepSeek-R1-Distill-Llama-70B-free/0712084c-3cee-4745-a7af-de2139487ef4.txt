Okay, so I've got this problem about the combustion of octane and I need to find the theoretical air-fuel ratio. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives the combustion equation: C8H18 + 12.5O2 + 12.5*(3.76)N2 → 8CO2 + 9H2O + 47N2. Wait, so the 3.76 is the usual factor for nitrogen in air, right? Because air is about 21% O2 and 79% N2, and 79/21 is roughly 3.76. So for every mole of O2, there's 3.76 moles of N2.

The problem asks for the theoretical air-fuel ratio, which is the mass of air per mass of fuel. So I think I need to find how much air is used per mole of octane burned.

First, let's figure out the moles of air involved. The equation shows 12.5 moles of O2 and 12.5*3.76 moles of N2. Oh wait, but that's the moles of each component in the air. So the total moles of air would be the sum of O2 and N2 moles. So 12.5 + (12.5 * 3.76) = 12.5*(1 + 3.76) = 12.5 *4.76. Let me calculate that. 12.5 * 4 is 50, and 12.5 *0.76 is 9.5, so total 59.5 moles of air.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the equation, the 12.5 is the moles of O2, and the N2 is 12.5 * 3.76. So the total moles of air would be (12.5 + 12.5*3.76) = 12.5*(1 +3.76)=12.5*(4.76)=59.5 moles of air per mole of octane. So that's the moles of air.

But wait, the air is O2 and N2 combined. So the moles of air is indeed 12.5 (O2) + 12.5*3.76 (N2). So 12.5*(1+3.76) equals 12.5 *4.76 = 59.5 moles of air.

Now, to find the air-fuel ratio in mass terms. So I need to find the mass of air and the mass of the fuel, then take the ratio.

The fuel is C8H18. The molecular weight of octane is (8*12) + (18*1) = 96 +18=114 g/mol.

So for each mole of octane, the mass is 114 grams.

Now, the mass of air: air has a molecular weight of about 29 g/mol (since O2 is 32, N2 is 28; 0.21*32 +0.79*28 = 28.84, but often approximated as 29).

So moles of air are 59.5, so mass is 59.5 *29 g/mol. Wait, wait. Let me compute that. 59.5 *29. Let me calculate:

59 *29 = (60-1)*29=60*29=1740 -29=1711.

0.5 *29=14.5. So total 1711+14.5=1725.5 grams of air per mole of octane.

So the air-fuel ratio is mass of air divided by mass of fuel. So 1725.5 g air / 114 g fuel.

Let me compute that. 1725.5 /114. Let's see, 114 *15=1710. So 15 is 1710, which leaves 15.5 left. 15.5/114 is approximately 0.136. So 15.136, roughly 15.14.

Looking at the options, option B is 15.1 g air/g fuel. That's close to my calculation. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I make calculation errors.

Wait, wait, did I get the air moles right? The equation is per mole of octane. So 12.5 O2 and 12.5 *3.76 N2. So 12.5*(1+3.76) =12.5*4.76=59.5. Yes, that's correct.

Air molecular weight is 29 g/mol. So 59.5 *29 = let me compute 59.5 *30 is 1785, minus 59.5 gives 1725.5. Correct.

Fuel is 114 grams per mole. So 1725.5 /114 → let me compute this division accurately.

114 ×15 = 1710.

1725.5 -1710 =15.5.

15.5 /114 = 0.136 approx.

So 15.136 → approx 15.14, which would round to 15.1. So option B is 15.1 g air/g fuel.

Wait, but let me think, sometimes the ratio is expressed as AFR = (mass of air)/(mass of fuel). So yes, that's what I've done.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it using precise values. Let me see. The precise molecular weight of air is 28.97 g/mol (since N2 is 28.0134*2=56.0268; O2 is 31.9988*2=63.9976. 0.79*28.0134*2 = 44.336, 0.21*32=6.72. So 44.336 +6.72=51.056; wait, no, wait that's not the way. Actually, air is 79% N2 and 21% O2 by volume, but molecular weights are:

Molar mass of air is (0.79 *28.01) + (0.21 *32.00) = let's compute that.

0.79*28.01: 0.7 *28.01=19.607; 0.09*28.01=2.5209 → total 22.1279.

0.21 *32=6.72.

So total is 22.1279 +6.72=28.8479 g/mol. So approximately 28.85 g/mol.

So maybe I should use 28.85 instead of 29 to be precise.

So let's recalculate the mass of air: 59.5 moles *28.85 g/mol.

59.5 *28.85 = ?

Let me compute 60 *28.85 = 1731, but since it's 59.5, which is 60-0.5, so 1731 - (0.5 *28.85)=1731 -14.425=1716.575 grams.

So 1716.575 g of air per mole of octane.

Fuel mass is 114 g/mol.

So AFR =1716.575 /114 = let's compute.

114 ×15 =1710 → 1716.575-1710=6.575.

6.575/114= approx 0.05766.

So total is 15.05766, approximately 15.058. So about 15.06.

But earlier with 29, it was 15.14. So which one is correct? Well, perhaps the question expects the rough value with 29. But let's see.

Wait, the options have B as 15.1. So that's in line with the first calculation. But perhaps more precise.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the ratio in terms of moles:

Molar ratio is 59.5 moles air per 1 mole fuel. So (59.5 *28.85)/(114) = (59.5*28.85)/114.

Compute 59.5 *28.85: 60 *28.85 is 1731. 0.5*28.85 is 14.425. So 59.5*28.85=1731-14.425=1716.575.

Divide by 114: 1716.575 /114.

114 ×15=1710. 1716.575-1710=6.575.

6.575 /114 = 0.05766.

So 15.05766 ≈15.058.

So about 15.06, which rounds to 15.1 when rounded to three significant figures. So answer B.

So the correct answer is B:15.1g air/g fuel.

To determine the theoretical air-fuel ratio for the combustion of octane, we start with the given combustion equation:

\[
\text{C}_8\text{H}_{18} + 12.5\text{O}_2 + 12.5(3.76)\text{N}_2 \rightarrow 8\text{CO}_2 + 9\text{H}_2\text{O} + 47\text{N}_2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the total moles of air
The combustion equation shows that 12.5 moles of oxygen (\(\text{O}_2\)) and \(12.5 \times 3.76 = 47\) moles of nitrogen (\(\text{N}_2\)) are required per mole of octane. Since air is a mixture of \(\text{O}_2\) and \(\text{N}_2\), the total moles of air are:

\[
\text{Moles of air} = 12.5 + 47 = 59.5 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of air
The molecular weight of air is approximately \(28.85 \, \text{g/mol}\). Therefore, the mass of air is:

\[
\text{Mass of air} = 59.5 \times 28.85 = 1716.575 \, \text{g}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mass of fuel
The molecular weight of octane (\(\text{C}_8\text{H}_{18}\)) is:

\[
\text{Molecular weight of octane} = (8 \times 12) + (18 \times 1) = 96 + 18 = 114 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Thus, the mass of one mole of octane is \(114 \, \text{g}\).

### Step 4: Calculate the air-fuel ratio
The air-fuel ratio is the mass of air divided by the mass of fuel:

\[
\text{Air-fuel ratio} = \frac{\text{Mass of air}}{\text{Mass of fuel}} = \frac{1716.575}{114} \approx 15.06 \, \text{g air/g fuel}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The calculated air-fuel ratio is approximately \(15.06 \, \text{g air/g fuel}\), which rounds to \(15.1 \, \text{g air/g fuel}\). This matches option **B**.
