Okay, so I have this problem here about two sewing machines, and I need to figure out which one is the better buy and how much I save by choosing that one. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says there are two options. The first sewing machine costs $275 net price. I think "net price" means that's the final price after any discounts, so I don't have to calculate anything else for that one. It's straightforwardâ€”$275 is what I pay.

The second option is a machine listed at $320, but there's a discount involved. The discount is 12 and a half percent. Hmm, 12.5% is the same as 12.1/2 percent. I'm a bit rusty on percentages, but I remember that to calculate a discount, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply it by the original price. So, 12.5% as a decimal would be 0.125. 

Let me write that down. The discount amount would be 320 multiplied by 0.125. Let me do that calculation. 320 times 0.125. Oh wait, 0.125 is the same as 1/8, right? So 320 divided by 8 is... let me see. 8 times 40 is 320, so 320 divided by 8 is 40. So the discount is $40. 

Wait, so the discounted price would be the original $320 minus the $40 discount. That gives 320 minus 40, which is $280. So the second machine costs $280 after the discount.

Now, comparing the two options: the first is $275, the second is $280. So the first one must be cheaper. The question is, how much do I save by buying the cheaper one instead of the other?

So, if I buy the first machine at $275 instead of the second at $280, I save $5. Because 280 minus 275 is 5. So I save five dollars by choosing the first option.

Looking at the answer options, I need to see which one corresponds to this. Let me read the options again.

Option A is the $275 machine. That's the cheaper one, so that's the best buy. The question is, which machine is the best buy and how much you save. So the best buy is the $275 machine, and by buying it instead of the $320 machine, you save $5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The second machine is $320 with a 12.5% discount. So discount is 320 * 0.125. Let me calculate that again. 320 * 0.1 is 32, and 320 * 0.025 is 8. So 32 + 8 is 40. So yes, discount is $40, making the price $280. Then the first machine is $275, so the difference is indeed $5.

So the best buy is the $275 machine, and you save $5 by choosing it. Now, looking at the options, the question is which option correctly states this. The options are:

A: $275 machine. So this is the best buy.

B: $320 machine. No, because it's more expensive after discount.

C: $320 with a 20% discount. Wait, but the problem states it's a 12.5% discount, not 20. So that's not relevant here.

D: Both are same price. No, because 275 vs 280, they're different.

E: $300 machine with 10% discount. Not part of the problem.

F: $320 machine with 5% discount. Again, not what the problem says.

G: $250 with 15% discount. Not applicable.

H: $280 machine. That's the price after discount, but the best buy is the other one.

I: $310 machine with no discount. Doesn't match.

J: $350 machine with 15% discount. Not relevant.

So the correct answer is option A, the $275 machine. But wait, the question also asks how much you save. So the answer would involve which machine is the best buy and the savings. But looking at the options, each option is just one machine description. So perhaps the correct option is A because it's the cheaper one, and the savings is $5.

Wait, but the options don't include the savings amount, only the machine. So perhaps the correct answer is A, and the question is just asking which is the best buy, then the saving is $5, which isn't part of the options. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the best buy and how much you save. But the options are just the choices for the best buy. So the correct answer is A, the $275 machine.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me check again. The options are A to J, each describing a machine. The question is which is the best buy. So the correct answer is A because it's cheaper than the discounted $280 machine.

Wait, but let me think again. The first machine is $275, the second after discount is $280. So the first is cheaper by $5. So the best buy is the first machine, which is option A. So the answer is A.

The best buy is the sewing machine selling for $275, as it is cheaper than the second option after applying the discount. The second machine, listed at $320 with a 12.5% discount, costs $280 after the discount ($320 - $40 = $280). Comparing the two, the $275 machine saves you $5 compared to the $280 machine.

Option A correctly identifies the best buy as the $275 machine.

Answer: A
