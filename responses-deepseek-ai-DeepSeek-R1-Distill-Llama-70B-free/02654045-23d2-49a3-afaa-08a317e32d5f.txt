Question:

A woman duly executed a will under which she devised her farm to her nephew and bequeathed the residue of her estate to her niece. For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?

Options:

A: The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.
B: The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.
C: The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.
D: The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this wills and estates question. Let's see, I remember that when someone makes a will, they can leave their property to others, and if they sell that property, it might affect what the beneficiaries get.

The question is about a woman who made a will. She devised her farm to her nephew and left the residue of her estate to her niece. So the farm goes to the nephew, and everything else goes to the niece.

Then, she lived on the farm for 12 years after making the will. Later, she sold the farm and used the money to buy a home in the city, where she lived until she died. She never changed her will. Now, after her death, both the nephew and niece are claiming ownership of the home. The question is who owns the home.

Hmm, I think this has to do with what happens when a specific gift in a will is no longer in the estate when the person dies. I remember something about ademption. Ademption occurs when the testator sells or disposes of a specific gift before death, so the beneficiary gets nothing because the asset isn't there anymore.

Wait, so in this case, the farm was specifically given to the nephew. But she sold the farm. So the nephew's gift might have adeemed because she sold it. That would mean the nephew doesn't get the farm anymore. But what about the proceeds from the sale?

She used the proceeds to buy a home. So the home is new property acquired after the will was made. The will gives the residue to the niece, which is everything else not specifically given away. So the home wasn't specifically devised to anyone, so it would go to the niece as part of the residue.

Wait, but does the sale of the farm and buying the home affect the residue? Let me think. The residue is what's left after specific devises. So the farm was a specific devise, and she sold it. So the proceeds from the sale become part of the residue, unless she does something else with them. Because when she sells the farm, it's like she's converting it into cash. So the cash would be part of her estate at death.

But she used that cash to buy a home. So when she buys the home, she's using the proceeds, which were part of her estate. So the home becomes part of her estate. Since she didn't make any specific gift of the home in her will, it would pass as part of the residue to the niece.

So the nephew was supposed to get the farm, but she sold it, so he gets nothing. The home wasn't specifically given to anyone, so the niece, as the residuary beneficiary, gets it.

So looking at the options:

A: The nephew, because of ademption. Ademption would mean the nephew loses the farm, but does that affect the home? I don't think so. The home isn't part of the specific gift, so the nephew wouldn't get it. So this option is wrong.

B: The nephew because of equitable estoppel. I don't think estoppel applies here. Estoppel is more about when someone relies on a promise to their detriment. Not sure how that applies in this scenario. Doesn't seem right.

C: The niece because of lapse. Lapse is when a beneficiary dies before the testator. That's not the case here, so C is incorrect.

D: The niece because she's the residuary legatee. Yes, that makes sense. The home is part of the residue because it wasn't specifically devised, so it goes to the niece.

So the correct answer should be D.

The woman's will specifically devised the farm to her nephew and left the residue of her estate to her niece. However, the woman sold the farm after executing the will, and the proceeds from the sale were used to purchase a home in the city. Since the farm was sold, the specific devise to the nephew "adeemed," meaning he no longer had a right to the farm. The home, which was purchased with the proceeds, became part of the woman's estate at the time of her death. Because the will did not include a specific devise for the home, it passed as part of the residue to the niece, who was the residuary legatee.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While ademption applies to the farm, it does not affect the home, which was not part of the specific devise.
- **B**: Incorrect. Equitable estoppel is not relevant here, as there is no indication of reliance or promise by the woman.
- **C**: Incorrect. Lapse applies when a beneficiary predeceases the testator, which is not the case here.
- **D**: Correct. The home, not being specifically devised, passed to the niece as part of the residue.

The correct answer is **D: The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.**

Answer: D
