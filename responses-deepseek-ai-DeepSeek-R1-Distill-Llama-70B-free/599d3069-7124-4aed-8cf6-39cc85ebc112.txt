Okay, so I've got this question about why Britain imposed new taxes on their American colonies. Hmm, I remember from history class that this had something to do with the events leading up to the American Revolution. Let me think.

I think it was after a big war. Oh right, the French and Indian War, which was part of the Seven Years' War. Britain had spent a lot of money fighting that war, and after they won, they gained a lot of new territory, especially in North America. But all that fighting must have been expensive, right?

So after the war, Britain was probably in debt. They needed a way to pay off those debts. And since the colonies were part of the British Empire, they might have thought the colonies should help pay for the costs. I remember something about the British government thinking that the colonies were benefiting from their protection, like the military defense they provided, so it was only fair that the colonies contributed financially.

Wait, what taxes were imposed? There was the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Townshend Acts. These were all different ways Britain tried to tax the colonies. The colonists weren't happy about it because they didn't have a say in Parliament, leading to the "No taxation without representation" slogan.

Looking at the options, option B says the growing costs of war with France. That makes sense because the Seven Years' War was against France and its allies. So the costs from that war would have led Britain to tax the colonies more to help cover those expenses.

Another option is B. Let me check the other options to be sure. Option A is about increasing the king's wealth, but I don't think it was specifically for the king's personal gain. It was more about paying off national debts from the war. Option C is anger at American prosperity, but I don't recall that being the main reason. Britain was more focused on their own financial needs rather than being angry at the colonies' success. Option D is pressure from rich merchants, which doesn't ring a bell as the primary cause.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the correct answer is B: The growing costs of war with France.

The correct answer is B: The growing costs of war with France. Britain imposed new taxes on the American colonies primarily to address the financial burden left by the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War), which had significantly increased the national debt. The British government sought to cover these costs by taxing the colonies, leading to measures like the Sugar Act, Stamp Act, and Townshend Acts. These taxes were justified by the idea that the colonies should contribute to the empire's expenses, including military protection. However, this led to colonial resentment, as they had no representation in Parliament, sparking the famous protest of "No taxation without representation."
