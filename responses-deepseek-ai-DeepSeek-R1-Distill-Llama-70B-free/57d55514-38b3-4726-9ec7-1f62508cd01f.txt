Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about eosinophilic esophagitis, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what I remember about this condition.

Eosinophilic esophagitis, or EoE, is an inflammatory condition of the esophagus. I think it's related to allergies because I remember reading that it's often linked to food allergies or environmental allergens. So if the question is about whether it's due to allergy, the answer would probably not say it's not due to allergy. Looking at the options, option D says "Is not due to allergy," which I think is incorrect because EoE is often allergy-related.

Option A says it's not related to diet. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I remember that dietary changes are a common treatment approach. They might remove certain foods to see if symptoms improve. So A is likely incorrect.

Option B: Leads to oesophageal diverticular. Diverticula are like pouches that form in the wall of the esophagus. I think EoE can cause strictures, which are narrowings, but I'm not sure about diverticula. Maybe not directly.

Option C: Result of viral infection. I don't recall EoE being caused by a virus. It's more about immune response and allergies, so C is probably wrong.

Option E: Can be cured with lifestyle modifications only. I don't think it's curable that way. Treatment often includes medications like proton pump inhibitors or corticosteroids, sometimes dietary changes. So E might not be correct because it's about curing, which might not be the case.

Option F: Commonly treated with antibiotics. Wait, EoE isn't a bacterial infection, so antibiotics wouldn't be the go-to treatment. Unless maybe if it's a secondary infection, but I don't think that's common. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Leads to stomach ulcers. EoE affects the esophagus, not the stomach, so stomach ulcers are more related to H. pylori or NSAID use. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Benefits from antacid therapy. Antacids are for acid reflux. While some treatments for EoE might include PPIs (proton pump inhibitors), which reduce acid, EoE isn't the same as GERD. So maybe H isn't the best answer, but I'm not sure. Some studies show PPIs can help, but it's more about the inflammation than just acid.

Option I: May cause oesophageal obstruction. Yes, I remember that chronic inflammation and scarring in EoE can lead to strictures, which narrow the esophagus and cause difficulty swallowing, potentially leading to obstruction. So I sounds correct.

Let me go through each option again.

A: Not related to diet? No, diet is related. So A is incorrect.

B: Diverticula? Not sure, but I think it's more about strictures.

C: Viral? No.

D: Not due to allergy? No, it's often due to allergy. So D is incorrect.

E: Cure with lifestyle alone? Unlikely, needs medical treatment. So E is wrong.

F: Antibiotics? No.

G: Stomach ulcers? No.

H: Antacids? Maybe in some cases, but not the primary treatment.

I: Obstruction? Yes, as strictures can cause that.

So the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I: May cause oesophageal obstruction.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory condition of the esophagus often linked to allergies and dietary factors. It can lead to complications such as strictures, which are narrowings of the esophagus, potentially causing obstruction. 

- **A**: Incorrect because EoE is related to diet.
- **B**: Unlikely, as EoE is more associated with strictures than diverticula.
- **C**: Incorrect, as EoE is not caused by viral infections.
- **D**: Incorrect, as EoE is often due to allergies.
- **E**: Incorrect, as EoE typically requires medical treatment beyond lifestyle changes.
- **F**: Incorrect, as antibiotics are not a common treatment.
- **G**: Incorrect, as EoE affects the esophagus, not the stomach.
- **H**: Partially true, as PPIs may help, but not the primary treatment.
- **I**: Correct, as EoE can cause strictures leading to obstruction.

I
