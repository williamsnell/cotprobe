Okay, so I've got this limit problem here: the limit as x approaches 0 of x times the floor of 1/x. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on limits involving the floor function, but let's think through it.

First, I remember that the floor function, denoted as floor(y) or sometimes with brackets like ⎣y⎦, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to y. So for example, floor(2.3) is 2, floor(1.999) is 1, and floor(-1.1) is -2 because it's the next lower integer.

The function in the problem is x * floor(1/x). Let's consider what happens when x approaches 0. As x gets really small, 1/x becomes very large in magnitude. But wait, x approaches 0 from both the positive and negative sides, right? So I should probably check both cases separately.

Let's start with x approaching 0 from the positive side (x → 0+). In this case, x is a small positive number. Then 1/x is a large positive number. The floor of that would be the integer part just below 1/x. So if 1/x is, say, 1000.5, then floor(1/x) is 1000. So x * floor(1/x) would be x multiplied by 1000 in that case.

But wait, as x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches positive infinity. So floor(1/x) is the integer just below 1/x. Let's denote n = floor(1/x). Then n ≤ 1/x < n+1. If I solve for x, that gives 1/(n+1) < x ≤ 1/n.

So for a given integer n, when x is in (1/(n+1), 1/n], floor(1/x) is n. So x * floor(1/x) is x * n. But x is between 1/(n+1) and 1/n. So x * n is between n/(n+1) and 1. As n is a large positive integer here (since x is approaching 0), n/(n+1) approaches 1. So for each n, x * floor(1/x) approaches 1 as x approaches 1/(n+1) from above. Wait, but no, as x approaches 0, n increases to infinity. So let's think about it differently.

Wait, maybe I should consider the limit as x approaches 0 from the positive side. Let's let x approach 0+.

So x is positive and very small. So 1/x is a large positive number. Let me write 1/x as n + f, where n is an integer and 0 ≤ f < 1. So floor(1/x) would be n. So then x = 1/(n + f). So x * floor(1/x) = [1/(n + f)] * n = n/(n + f).

As x approaches 0, n approaches infinity because 1/x is getting larger. So n/(n + f) = 1/(1 + f/n). Since f is between 0 and 1, f/n approaches 0 as n approaches infinity. So the limit is 1/(1+0) = 1. So from the right side, the limit is 1.

Now, what about x approaching 0 from the negative side (x → 0-)? So x is a small negative number. Then 1/x is a large negative number (approaching negative infinity). So let's think about floor(1/x) in this case.

For example, if 1/x is -1000.5, then floor(1/x) would be -1001, because it's the next lower integer. So floor of a negative number less than -n is -(n+1). So here, for x approaching 0 from the negative side, 1/x approaches negative infinity. Let me denote m = floor(1/x), which would be a negative integer.

So m ≤ 1/x < m+1. But since x is negative, let's see: let's let m be a negative integer, so m = -k where k is a positive integer. Then m is negative, and m+1 is less negative. Wait, maybe I should solve for x in terms of m.

Wait, let's take m as the integer such that m ≤ 1/x < m+1. But x is negative, so 1/x is negative. So m is negative. Let me write m = -k, where k is a positive integer. So m = -k ≤ 1/x < m+1 = -k +1.

But since x is negative, 1/x is negative, so 1/x < 0. So for m being a negative integer, m ≤ 1/x < m+1.

But let's solve for x. Let me multiply through by x, but wait, since x is negative, the inequalities reverse when multiplying.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for x < 0, let x = -y where y > 0. Then 1/x = -1/y. So floor(1/x) = floor(-1/y). Let's think about that.

When y approaches 0 from the positive side (since x approaches 0 from the negative side), 1/y approaches positive infinity, so -1/y approaches negative infinity. So the floor of that would be the next lower integer. For example, if 1/y is 1000.5, then -1/y is -1000.5, and floor(-1000.5) is -1001.

So floor(-1/y) = - floor(1/y + 1) ??? Wait, perhaps not. Wait, for positive a, floor(-a) is -ceil(a). Because, for example, floor(-2.3) is -3, which is the negative of ceil(2.3)=3.

So floor(-a) = -ceil(a). So in this case, floor(-1/y) = -ceil(1/y). So if 1/y is not integer, ceil(1/y) is the next integer above 1/y. So for example, if 1/y is 1000.5, ceil(1/y) is 1001, so floor(-1000.5) is -1001.

So in our case, x is approaching 0 from the negative side, so y approaches 0 from the positive side. So 1/y approaches positive infinity, and floor(1/x) = floor(-1/y) = -ceil(1/y).

So our function becomes x * floor(1/x) = (-y) * (-ceil(1/y)) = y * ceil(1/y).

Now, let's let m = ceil(1/y), which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1/y. So m-1 < 1/y ≤ m. Which means 1/m ≤ y < 1/(m-1). So y is in [1/m, 1/(m-1)).

So y * m is the function. Since y is between 1/m and 1/(m-1), y * m is between 1 and m/(m-1). As m approaches infinity (since y approaches 0, 1/y approaches infinity, so m approaches infinity), m/(m-1) approaches 1. So y*m approaches 1 as m increases.

Wait, but m is getting large because y is approaching 0. So y * m, since y is approximately 1/m (because 1/y is approximately m), so y * m ≈ (1/m)*m = 1. So as m approaches infinity, y * m approaches 1. So the limit from the negative side is 1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake. Because when x approaches 0 from the negative side, x is negative, and 1/x is negative and approaching negative infinity. So floor(1/x) would be the next lower integer. So for example, if 1/x is -n + 0.5 (where n is a positive integer), then floor(1/x) is -n -1. Because, for example, 1/x = -1000.5, then floor is -1001.

So in that case, x = 1/( -1000.5 ) ≈ -0.0009995. So x * floor(1/x) is approximately (-0.0009995)*(-1001) ≈ 1.0005. So as x approaches 0 from the negative side, this product approaches 1.

Wait, but if I take another example: say 1/x is -1000.1, then floor(1/x) is -1001. So x is approximately -0.0009999. So x * floor(1/x) is (-0.0009999)*(-1001) ≈ 1.0009999, which is slightly above 1. So as 1/x becomes more negative, like -10000.5, then x would be approximately -0.000099995, and x*floor(1/x) would be (-0.000099995)*(-10001) ≈ 1.0001. So it's approaching 1 from above as x approaches 0 from the negative side.

Wait, but earlier when x approached from the positive side, the product approached 1 from below. Because, for example, 1/x is 1000.5, so x is approximately 0.0009995. So x * 1000 is approximately 0.9995, which is just below 1.

So from the right, the limit is 1, and from the left, the limit is also 1. So the overall limit is 1. So the answer should be B: 1.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me think again. Because when x approaches 0 from the negative side, the product x * floor(1/x) is approaching 1, but let me see:

Let x = -ε where ε is a small positive number approaching 0. So 1/x = -1/ε, which is a large negative number. Then floor(1/x) is the next lower integer, so if 1/x = -n + δ, where 0 < δ <1, then floor(1/x) = -n -1. So x * floor(1/x) = (-ε) * (-n -1) = ε(n+1).

But 1/x = -n + δ → x = -1/(n - δ) ≈ -1/(n) when n is large. So ε ≈ 1/(n). So ε(n+1) ≈ (1/n)(n+1) = (n+1)/n = 1 + 1/n. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the product approaches 1.

Wait, but in the example I did earlier, when 1/x is -1000.5, floor(1/x) is -1001, and x is approximately -0.0009995. So x * floor(1/x) is (-0.0009995)*(-1001) ≈ 1.0005, which is just over 1. So as x approaches 0 from the negative side, the product approaches 1 from above.

Similarly, when approaching from the positive side, x * floor(1/x) approaches 1 from below. So the left-hand limit is 1 and the right-hand limit is 1, so the overall limit is 1.

Wait, but in that case, the limit would be 1, so the answer is B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I think of x approaching 0 from the negative side, the product seems to approach 1 from above, but the right-hand side approaches 1 from below. But both sides approach 1, so the two-sided limit exists and is 1.

So the correct answer should be B: 1.

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{x \to 0} (x \lfloor 1/x \rfloor)\), we analyze the behavior of the function as \(x\) approaches 0 from both the positive and negative sides.

### Case 1: \(x \to 0^+\) (from the positive side)
As \(x\) approaches 0 from the positive side, \(1/x\) becomes a large positive number. Let \(n = \lfloor 1/x \rfloor\), where \(n\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(1/x\). Then:
\[
n \leq 1/x < n+1 \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad \frac{1}{n+1} < x \leq \frac{1}{n}.
\]
The function becomes \(x \cdot n\), and since \(x\) is in \((\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{1}{n}]\), we have:
\[
\frac{n}{n+1} < x \cdot n \leq 1.
\]
As \(x \to 0^+\), \(n \to \infty\), and \(\frac{n}{n+1} \to 1\). Thus, the limit from the positive side is:
\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} x \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 1.
\]

### Case 2: \(x \to 0^-\) (from the negative side)
As \(x\) approaches 0 from the negative side, \(1/x\) becomes a large negative number. Let \(m = \lfloor 1/x \rfloor\), where \(m\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(1/x\). Then:
\[
m \leq 1/x < m+1 \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad \frac{1}{m+1} < x \leq \frac{1}{m}.
\]
Since \(x\) is negative, \(m\) is also negative. The function becomes \(x \cdot m\), and since \(x\) is in \((\frac{1}{m+1}, \frac{1}{m}]\), we have:
\[
1 < x \cdot m < \frac{m}{m+1}.
\]
As \(x \to 0^-\), \(m \to -\infty\), and \(\frac{m}{m+1} \to 1\). Thus, the limit from the negative side is:
\[
\lim_{x \to 0^-} x \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 1.
\]

### Conclusion
Both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of the function as \(x \to 0\) are 1. Therefore, the overall limit is:
\[
\lim_{x \to 0} (x \lfloor 1/x \rfloor) = 1.
\]

The correct answer is **B: 1**.
