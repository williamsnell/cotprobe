Okay, so I have this question about group theory, which I'm trying to wrap my head around. The question is about determining for which integers n between 3 and 11 inclusive, there's only one group of order n up to isomorphism. The options are A through J, each listing different sets of numbers. 

Alright, I remember that groups of certain orders are unique, meaning there's only one group (up to isomorphism) of that order. From what I've studied, this has to do with the concept of cyclic groups and the classification of abelian groups, but also non-abelian groups when applicable.

Let me think about each number from 3 to 11 and see what I remember about the groups of those orders.

Starting with n=3. I know that the only group of order 3 is the cyclic group Z3. That's because 3 is prime, and all groups of prime order are cyclic and unique. So, yes, there's only one group here.

n=4: Hmm, I think there are two groups of order 4. One is the cyclic group Z4, and the other is the Klein four-group V4, which is isomorphic to Z2 × Z2. So for n=4, there are two non-isomorphic groups. That means n=4 doesn't satisfy the condition of having only one group.

n=5: 5 is prime, so like n=3, the only group is Z5. So only one group here.

n=6: Now, I'm a bit unsure. I remember that groups of order 6 can be either cyclic (Z6) or the symmetric group S3, which is non-abelian. So that's two groups. So n=6 doesn't have a unique group.

Wait, no, wait. Hold on. For order 6, the cyclic group and the symmetric group S3. Oh wait, isn't S3 of order 6? So yeah, two groups. So n=6 is out.

n=7: 7 is prime, so only Z7. So only one group.

n=8: I think there are several groups of order 8. Let me recall. There are abelian groups like Z8, Z4×Z2, and Z2×Z2×Z2. Then there are non-abelian groups like the dihedral group D4 and the quaternion group Q8. So that's more than one group. So n=8 doesn't qualify.

n=9: 9 is 3 squared. For order p² where p is prime, the groups are abelian. I think there are two: one is the cyclic group Z9, and the other is the direct product Z3×Z3. So two groups, meaning n=9 doesn't have a unique group.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, for prime squares, p^2, are there only two abelian groups? Yes. So n=9 has two groups, so it doesn't have only one group.

n=10: 10 is 2×5. I remember that for order 10, the groups are Z10 (cyclic) and the dihedral group D5 (symmetries of a pentagon), which is non-abelian. So two groups here as well. So n=10 doesn't qualify.

n=11: 11 is prime, so only Z11. Only one group.

So compiling this:

n=3: 1 group.
n=4: 2 groups.
n=5: 1 group.
n=6: 2 groups.
n=7: 1 group.
n=8: multiple groups.
n=9: 2 groups.
n=10: 2 groups.
n=11: 1 group.

So the numbers where there's only one group are 3,5,7,11.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,5,7,11 only. That's what I have here.

Option F is 3,5,7,9,11. But I thought n=9 has two groups, so F would include 9 incorrectly.

Option B: 8,9,10,11. No, because 8 and 9 have multiple groups.

Option E: 3,4,5,6. But 4 and 6 have multiple groups, so no.

Option J: 5,6,7,8,9. 6 and 8 have multiple groups, so no.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine for which integers \( n \) such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 11 \) there is only one group of order \( n \) (up to isomorphism), we analyze each \( n \) in this range:

- **\( n = 3 \):** The only group of order 3 is the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). There is only one group.

- **\( n = 4 \):** There are two groups of order 4: the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_4 \) and the Klein four-group \( V_4 \). Thus, there is more than one group.

- **\( n = 5 \):** The only group of order 5 is the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). There is only one group.

- **\( n = 6 \):** There are two groups of order 6: the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \) and the symmetric group \( S_3 \). Thus, there is more than one group.

- **\( n = 7 \):** The only group of order 7 is the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \). There is only one group.

- **\( n = 8 \):** There are multiple groups of order 8, including the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \), the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \), the elementary abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_2^3 \), and non-abelian groups like the dihedral group \( D_4 \) and the quaternion group \( Q_8 \). Thus, there is more than one group.

- **\( n = 9 \):** There are two groups of order 9: the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_9 \) and the elementary abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Thus, there is more than one group.

- **\( n = 10 \):** There are two groups of order 10: the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_{10} \) and the dihedral group \( D_5 \). Thus, there is more than one group.

- **\( n = 11 \):** The only group of order 11 is the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \). There is only one group.

From this analysis, the integers \( n \) in the range \( 3 \leq n \leq 11 \) for which there is only one group are \( 3, 5, 7, \) and \( 11 \).

Examining the options:

- **Option A:** \( 3, 5, 7, 11 \) only. This matches the analysis.
- **Option B:** \( 8, 9, 10, 11 \) only. Incorrect, as \( 8, 9, \) and \( 10 \) have multiple groups.
- **Option C:** \( 4, 6, 8, 10 \) only. Incorrect, as these values have multiple groups.
- **Option D:** \( 6, 7, 8, 9 \) only. Incorrect, as \( 6, 8, \) and \( 9 \) have multiple groups.
- **Option E:** \( 3, 4, 5, 6 \) only. Incorrect, as \( 4 \) and \( 6 \) have multiple groups.
- **Option F:** \( 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 \). Incorrect, as \( 9 \) has multiple groups.
- **Option G:** \( 4, 5, 6, 8 \) only. Incorrect, as \( 4, 6, \) and \( 8 \) have multiple groups.
- **Option H:** For all integers \( n \) such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 11 \). Incorrect, as many values in this range have multiple groups.
- **Option I:** For no such integer \( n \). Incorrect, as \( 3, 5, 7, \) and \( 11 \) have only one group.
- **Option J:** \( 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \). Incorrect, as \( 6, 8, \) and \( 9 \) have multiple groups.

The correct answer is **Option A**.

**Answer:** A
