Okay, so I have this question about the relative occupancies of spin energy levels in a radical species. Hmm, I remember from my notes that this is related to the Boltzmann distribution. The formula for the ratio of occupancies between two states is based on the energy difference between them divided by thermal energy, right?

The formula I think is Nα/Nβ = exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)). Oh wait, but wait, because for spin states, the energy difference is related to the magnetic field and the g-factor. Oh right, the Zeeman effect. So the energy levels split into α and β, with energies Eα and Eβ.

The energy difference ΔE is Eβ - Eα. For an electron spin, E = -g μ_B m_S · B, where m_S is ±1/2. So for α, m_S is -1/2 (lower energy), and β is +1/2 (higher energy?) Wait, no, actually, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think: when the spin is aligned with the magnetic field (m_S = +1/2), it's lower in energy. So Eβ is higher than Eα? Or am I getting the signs wrong here?

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The energy is E = -g μ_B m_S B. So when m_S is +1/2 for the β state (assuming β is the higher state?), the energy is E_β = -g μ_B (1/2) B. And E_α would be when m_S is -1/2, so E_α = g μ_B (1/2) B. Oh wait, no, that would make E_β lower if B is positive. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the labels for α and β mixed up. Maybe α is the lower energy state and β is the higher. So m_S for α is +1/2, and β is -1/2? No, wait, maybe it's the opposite. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the splitting ΔE = g μ_B B. Because the difference in energy between the two states would be ΔE = E_β - E_α. Let me calculate that. Suppose α is the lower energy state, so E_α = - (1/2) g μ_B B. E_β = (1/2) g μ_B B? No, wait, wait, let's see: if the magnetic moment is aligned with B, it's lower energy. So maybe m_S is +1/2 for the lower energy (α), so E_α = - (g μ_B B)/2. E_β is when m_S is -1/2, so E_β = (g μ_B B)/2. So ΔE = E_β - E_α = [ (g μ_B B/2) ] - [ (-g μ_B B/2) ] = g μ_B B. So ΔE = g μ_B B.

Wait, that makes sense. So the energy difference is g μ_B B. Now, the ratio Nα/Nβ would be based on the Boltzmann factor. Since E_β is higher than E_α, the occupancy of β (Nβ) would be less than that of α (Nα) when temperature is low, but as temperature increases, the ratio approaches 1.

The formula for the ratio is Nα/Nβ = exp(ΔE/(k_B T)). Wait, no. Because the energy for β is higher, so the population in β will be lower. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)) for the higher energy state. So for Nα/Nβ, since E_β > E_α, the population ratio should be Nα/Nβ = exp(ΔE/(k_B T))^{-1}?

Wait, let me think again. The general formula is (N_upper)/(N_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)). So if E_β is higher than E_α, then Nβ/Nα = exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)), which implies that Nα/Nβ = exp(ΔE/(k_B T)). Because Nβ = Nα exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)), so the ratio Nα/Nβ is exp(ΔE/(k_B T)).

Wait, wait, let's be precise. The number of particles in each state is given by the Boltzmann distribution: N_i = (1/Z) exp(-E_i/(k_B T)), where Z is the partition function. For two states, E_α and E_β, with E_α < E_β, the ratio Nα/Nβ would be [exp(-E_α/(k_B T))]/[exp(-E_β/(k_B T)))] = exp( (E_β - E_α)/(k_B T) ) = exp(ΔE/(k_B T)).

So the ratio Nα/Nβ is equal to exp(ΔE/(k_B T)). So that's the formula I need to use.

Now, ΔE is g μ_B B. But wait, the question gives the frequency of the bands, not the magnetic field. Oh right, because in EPR, the resonance condition is h ν = g μ_B B. So B is related to the microwave frequency ν.

Wait, the relation is hν = g μ_B B, so B = h ν/(g μ_B). But in terms of the calculation, we can express ΔE as h ν, because ΔE = g μ_B B = h ν.

Wait, because h ν = g μ_B B → ΔE = h ν. Oh wait, because ΔE is g μ_B B, and substituting B = h ν/(g μ_B), so ΔE = g μ_B * (h ν)/(g μ_B) ) = h ν. So yes, ΔE = h ν.

So the ratio Nα/Nβ = exp( h ν/(k_B T) )

Wait, but wait, that would give a very large exponent for typical microwave frequencies. Let me think: for example, at X-band, which is around 9 GHz. Let's compute h ν/(k_B T) at 300 K.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

ν is the frequency. For L-band and W-band, I think L-band is around 1 GHz, and W-band is like 95 GHz? Wait, I'm not too sure about the exact frequencies. Let me try to remember: EPR has different bands. X-band is about 9 GHz, K-band is around 20 GHz, Q-band about 35 GHz, W-band about 95 GHz. L-band is a lower frequency, maybe around 1 GHz or so. So let's say for L-band, ν_L is 1e9 Hz, and W-band ν_W is 95e9 Hz.

But wait, I think I might be getting the exact numbers wrong, but perhaps the specific numbers are given in the question. Wait, the question says "at L- and W-band frequencies". Wait, but the question doesn't provide the exact frequencies, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think back. The question gives the g value as 2.05, but for the ratio calculation, the exact g might not matter because in the formula, the ratio depends only on h ν/(k_B T). Wait no, because ΔE = g μ_B B, but from resonance, h ν = g μ_B B, so ΔE = h ν. Thus, the g cancels out. So the ratio only depends on ν, T, and constants.

So, the ratio Nα/Nβ is exp( h ν/(k_B T) )

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-express:

ΔE = h ν.

So the exponent is (h ν) / (k_B T).

But since Nα/Nβ = exp(ΔE/(k_B T)), so it's exp( h ν/(k_B T) )

But wait, that can't be right. Because for typical frequencies, h ν is much larger than k_B T, making the exponent very large, so Nα >> Nβ, pushing the ratio Nα/Nβ to be a large number, which isn't the case in practice. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in reality, at room temperature and for typical EPR conditions, the population difference between the spin states is small, so the ratio Nα/Nβ is just slightly above 1.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should have ΔE = g μ_B B, and then using E = h ν = g μ_B B → B = h ν/(g μ_B). So ΔE = g μ_B * (h ν)/(g μ_B) ) → h ν. So ΔE is h ν.

But then the ratio Nα/Nβ = exp(ΔE/(k_B T)) = exp( h ν/(k_B T) )

Wait, but for ν = 1e9 Hz (1 GHz), h ν is about 6.626e-34 * 1e9 = 6.626e-25 J.

k_B is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K.

At T = 300 K, k_B T is about 4.14e-21 J.

So h ν/(k_B T) = (6.626e-25) / (4.14e-21) ≈ 1.6e-4.

So exp(1.6e-4) ≈ 1.00016. So the ratio Nα/Nβ is about 1.00016, which would mean that Nα is slightly larger than Nβ, but the ratio is very close to 1.

Wait, but looking at the options, the ratios are all less than 1. So for example, option A says 0.985 at L-band. Hmm, that would imply that Nα is less than Nβ, which contradicts what I just found.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let's think again.

Wait, if E_α is the lower energy state, then Nα is higher than Nβ. So Nα/Nβ should be greater than 1. But the options all have ratios less than one. So that suggests I have the ratio inverted.

Ah! Oh wait, perhaps I mixed up α and β. Maybe α is the higher energy state, and β is the lower. Let me clarify.

Wait, in EPR, the ground state is typically the lower energy state with m_S = +1/2 (aligned with B). So when the spin is aligned, it's lower energy. So when we have E_α and E_β, perhaps E_α is the lower energy (m_S = +1/2), and E_β is higher (m_S = -1/2). So the energy difference is ΔE = E_β - E_α = g μ_B B.

Then, the populations are Nα and Nβ. Since E_α is lower, Nα should be higher than Nβ, so Nα/Nβ > 1.

But the options all have Nα/Nβ less than 1. So perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Nβ/Nα = exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)), so Nα/Nβ = exp(ΔE/(k_B T)).

Wait, let's re-express the formula correctly.

The ratio N_upper/N_lower = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k_B T) )

So if E_α < E_β, then N_β is the upper state, so N_β/N_α = exp( - (E_β - E_α)/(k_B T) ) → N_α/N_β = exp( (E_β - E_α)/(k_B T) )

But earlier calculation shows that (E_β - E_α)/(k_B T) is a small positive number, so exp(small) ≈ 1 + small. So Nα/Nβ is slightly above 1.

But the options have values like 0.98, which is less than 1. That suggests that Nα < Nβ, implying that E_α is higher than E_β.

Wait, perhaps I have the labels for α and β reversed.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the energy difference as E_α - E_β. Let me think.

Another approach: The general formula is (N_upper)/(N_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) )

Assuming E_upper > E_lower.

So, for our case, if E_β is upper, then N_β = N_α exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) )

So N_α/N_β = exp(ΔE/(k_B T) )

So, if ΔE is small compared to k_B T, then N_α/N_β is just a bit above 1.

But in the options, all the ratios are less than 1, which would mean N_α < N_β, implying that E_α is higher than E_β.

So perhaps I'm getting the labels wrong. Maybe α is the higher energy state.

Wait, perhaps in the question, α and β are defined in the opposite way. So, perhaps α is the state with m_S = -1/2 (higher energy), and β is m_S = +1/2 (lower energy). Then E_α = + (1/2) g μ_B B, E_β = - (1/2) g μ_B B.

Wait, no, that can't be, because when the spin is aligned with the field, it's lower in energy. So for m_S = +1/2, the energy is lower.

So, perhaps in the question, α is the lower energy state (m_S = +1/2), and β is the higher (m_S = -1/2). So, Nα > Nβ, so ratio Nα/Nβ > 1.

But the options give all ratios <1, so perhaps I have the ratio inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps I should do the calculation again, carefully.

Let me compute h ν/(k_B T) for L-band and W-band.

Assume L-band frequency is ν_L = 1e9 Hz (1 GHz), W-band ν_W = 95e9 Hz (95 GHz).

Compute for each:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K

T = 300 K.

Compute exponent = h ν / (k_B T)

For L-band:

h ν = 6.626e-34 * 1e9 = 6.626e-25 J

k_B T = 1.38e-23 * 300 = 4.14e-21 J

exponent_L = 6.626e-25 / 4.14e-21 ≈ 0.00016.

So exp(0.00016) ≈ 1.00016.

So Nα/Nβ = exp(0.00016) ≈ 1.00016. So approximately 1.0002, which is about 1. So the ratio is very close to 1, slightly above.

But the options for L-band are around 0.98 to 0.995.

Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should be using (ΔE)/(k_B T) = (g μ_B B)/(k_B T). But since B is related to frequency via h ν = g μ_B B, then B = h ν/(g μ_B). So ΔE = g μ_B B = h ν.

So, same as before. So the exponent is h ν/(k_B T), which is small for L-band, leading to a ratio just above 1.

But the options have Nα/Nβ less than 1, which doesn't align. So perhaps something is wrong.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the ratio Nβ/Nα, not Nα/Nβ. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "relative occupancies of the α and β spin energy levels", and the ratio is Nα/Nβ. So if Nα < Nβ, the ratio is less than 1.

Which would mean that E_α is higher than E_β. So perhaps I have the energy levels for α and β inverted.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the resonance condition. At resonance, the microwave photon's energy matches the energy difference between the spin states. So when a photon is absorbed, an electron goes from the lower energy state (aligned, α) to the higher energy state (β). So E_β > E_α.

Thus, Nα > Nβ at thermal equilibrium, so Nα/Nβ > 1. But the options have ratios less than 1, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to think about it: The population ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Nα/Nβ = exp( (E_β - E_α) / (k_B T) )

But since E_β > E_α, E_β - E_α is positive. So the exponent is positive, making Nα/Nβ > 1.

But the options have the ratio less than 1. So perhaps I have the energies inverted.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have E_α - E_β in the exponent. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the correct formula is N_upper / N_lower = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k_B T) )

So for E_β > E_α, N_β is the upper state.

Thus, N_β/N_α = exp( - (E_β - E_α)/(k_B T) )

Which can be rewritten as N_α/N_β = exp( (E_β - E_α)/(k_B T) )

So, this brings us back to the same point: Nα/Nβ is greater than 1.

Therefore, the options provided must have a typo, or I have a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the reciprocal, i.e., Nβ/Nα. Let me check the question again.

Question: Calculate the relative occupancies of the α and β spin energy levels... So the ratio is Nα/Nβ.

Hmm. So according to the calculation, Nα/Nβ is about 1.00016 for L-band, which is very close to 1. So the ratio would be approximately 1.00016, which is 1.00 when rounded to four decimal places. But none of the options have a ratio of 1.00. The options are like 0.98, 0.99, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.

Let me recalculate for L-band (ν=1e9 Hz):

h ν = 6.626e-34 *
