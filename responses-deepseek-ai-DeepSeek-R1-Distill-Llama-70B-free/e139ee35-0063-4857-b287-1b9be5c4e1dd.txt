The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A researcher planning a survey of school principals in a particular state has lists of the school principals employed in each of the 125 school districts. The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?

Options:

A: This is a purposive sampling, where the researcher only selects individuals that meet specific characteristics.
B: This is a non-probability sampling, where the samples are gathered in a process that does not give all the individuals in the population equal chances of being selected.
C: This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.
D: This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.
E: This is a convenience sampling, where the researcher chooses the easiest group to reach.
F: This is a snowball sampling, where existing study subjects recruit future subjects.
G: This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.
H: This is a quota sampling, where the researcher ensures equal representation of each district.
I: This is a sequential sampling, where sampling continues until a certain criteria is met.
J: This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.

Okay, I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about sampling methods in research. Let me try to break it down.

So, the scenario is a researcher planning a survey of school principals in a state. They have lists from each of the 125 school districts. Instead of combining all these lists into one big group and then taking a sample from that, the researcher decides to take a random sample from each individual district. The question is asking which conclusion is correct about this method.

Hmm, I remember that there are several types of sampling methods. Let me go through them one by one.

First, the options are A through J, each describing a different sampling method. I need to figure out which one matches the scenario.

The procedure here is to sample from each district separately. So, the population is divided into districts (which are like subgroups), and then a random sample is taken from each. I think this relates to stratified sampling. Wait, what's stratified sampling again? Oh right, stratified sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (or strata) and then randomly sampling from each stratum. This ensures that each subgroup is represented in the sample. It's often done to make the sample more representative or to compare across strata.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's a stratified sample which may give comparative info that a simple random sample wouldn't. That sounds right because, by sampling from each district, you can compare results across districts. Simple random sampling from the whole population might not ensure representation from each district, especially if some districts have few principals.

Other options: 

Option B is non-probability sampling. No, because the researcher is using a random sample from each district, so it's probability-based.

Option D is cluster sampling. Wait, cluster sampling is when you divide the population into clusters (like districts) and then randomly select some clusters to sample. But here, the researcher is sampling from all districts, not selecting a subset of clusters. So D might not be correct.

Option J suggests it's a simple random sample done more easily. No, because it's not sampling from the whole population but from each subgroup.

So, putting this together, the correct answer should be C: stratified sample.
</think>

The researcher is using a method where the population is divided into subgroups (districts), and a random sample is taken from each subgroup. This is characteristic of **stratified sampling**, which ensures each subgroup is represented and allows for comparisons across them. This method differs from cluster sampling (D) because all districts are sampled, not a subset. It is also distinct from simple random sampling (J) as it doesn't involve sampling from the entire population. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that this is a stratified sample.

Answer: C
