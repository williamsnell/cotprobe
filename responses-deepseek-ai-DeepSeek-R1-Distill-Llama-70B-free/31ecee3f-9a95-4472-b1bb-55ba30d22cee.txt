Okay, so I've got this matrix question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Both A and B are n-by-n matrices. The rank of A is n, and the rank of A multiplied by B is zero. The question is asking what the rank of B is. The options are from A to J, each a possible answer.

Hmm, I remember that the rank of a matrix is the dimension of its column space, which is the number of linearly independent columns. For a square matrix, if the rank is n, that means it's full rank. So matrix A is invertible because only invertible square matrices have full rank. Oh wait, right, because if a square matrix has rank equal to its size, it's invertible.

So A is invertible. Now, the rank of A*B is zero. Wait, a rank of zero means that the matrix is the zero matrix. Because the only matrix with rank zero is the zero matrix. So A*B must be the zero matrix.

But wait, A is invertible. If A is invertible, then I can multiply both sides by A inverse. Let's think: A*B = 0. If I multiply both sides on the left by A^{-1}, which exists because A is invertible, then A^{-1} * A * B = A^{-1} * 0. That simplifies to I * B = 0, so B = 0.

Oh wait, so B has to be the zero matrix. And the rank of the zero matrix is zero. So the rank of B is zero. Looking back at the options, option A is 0.0. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose A is invertible and B is any matrix such that AB is zero. Then B must be zero because if AB=0, and A is invertible, then B = A^{-1} 0 = 0. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the rank of B is zero, which is option A.

Both A and B are n-by-n matrices. The rank of A is n, which means A is invertible since only full-rank square matrices are invertible. The rank of the product A*B is given as 0, which implies that A*B is the zero matrix. 

Since A is invertible, we can multiply both sides of the equation A*B = 0 by A^{-1} (the inverse of A) on the left. This gives:

\[
A^{-1}(A*B) = A^{-1}*0
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
(I*B) = 0 \implies B = 0
\]

The zero matrix has a rank of 0. Therefore, the rank of B is 0, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
