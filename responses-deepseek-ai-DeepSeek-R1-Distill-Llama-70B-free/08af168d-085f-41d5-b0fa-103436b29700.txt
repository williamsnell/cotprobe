Okay, so I have this question about Aurignacian and Mousterian technologies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but let me think this through.

I remember that both terms relate to Stone Age tool industries. Mousterian is associated with the Neanderthals, right? And Aurignacian is linked to early modern humans, like Homo sapiens in Europe. So the question is about the differences in their technologies.

Wait, what's the main difference between the two? I think Mousterian tools are more about flake tools, like scrapers and denticulates. They used a lot of Levallois technique, which is a method to produce flakes with a prepared core. So their tools were more flake-based.

On the other hand, Aurignacian is part of the Upper Paleolithic, which I believe is more advanced. Upper Paleolithic tools often involve blade production. Blades are longer, thinner flakes that have more usable edges. So Aurignacian probably focused more on blades rather than flakes. That means their tools would have more usable surface area because blades have longer edges.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Mousterian focused on scrapers. I think Mousterian did use scrapers, but I'm not sure if that's the key difference. Aurignacian might have had more specialized tools beyond just scrapers.

Option B: Aurignacian was primarily for stone tools. Both made stone tools, so this might not be the right distinction.

Option C: Aurignacian less advanced. No, Upper Paleolithic is usually seen as more advanced than Mousterian, which is Middle Paleolithic.

Option D: Mousterian produced more usable blade surface. Wait, I thought Mousterian was more about flakes. Blades would have more surface, so this might not be right.

Option E: Aurignacian produced more. That makes sense because of their blade technology. Blades have longer edges, so more usable surface.

Option F: Mousterian less. If E is correct, then F is also correct but phrased differently. But the question is about the difference, so E seems like a direct answer.

Option G: Mousterian mainly hand axes. Wait, hand axes are more associated with the Acheulean industry, which is even older than Mousterian. Mousterian might have some hand axes but not mainly.

Option H: Mousterian more projectile points. I'm not sure. Aurignacian probably had more specialized tools like projectile points, maybe. Mousterian might have had some, but I don't think that's the main difference.

So putting it together, the main difference is that Aurignacian had more blade production, leading to more usable blade surface. So the correct answer would be E, and the incorrect options would be the others. Let me double-check.

Wait, sometimes I get confused between blade and flake. Blades are longer and have at least twice the length as width. So in Aurignacian, blade tools would have more usable edges. Mousterian, with more scrapers and denticulates, which are flake tools, have less usable surface per tool.

So the answer should be E.

The Aurignacian technology, associated with early modern humans, differed from Mousterian technology, linked to Neanderthals, primarily in its focus on blade production. Aurignacian tools, part of the Upper Paleolithic, emphasized the creation of blades, which are longer, thinner flakes with more usable edges. This resulted in tools with a greater usable blade surface compared to the Mousterian toolkit, which relied more on flake tools like scrapers and denticulates. Therefore, the key distinction lies in the Aurignacian's production of more usable blade surface.

Answer: E
