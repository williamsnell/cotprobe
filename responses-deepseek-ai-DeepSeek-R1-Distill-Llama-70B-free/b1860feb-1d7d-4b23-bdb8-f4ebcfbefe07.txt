Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure out the rate of heat addition for a gas mixture flowing through a heat exchanger. Let me see what I know and how to approach this.

The problem states that the gas mixture is composed of 0.4 mole fraction of nitrogen (N2) and 0.6 mole fraction of argon. It's flowing at a rate of 2500 lbm/hr. The temperature increases from 80°F to 450°F, and the process happens at a constant pressure of 14.7 psia. I need to calculate the rate of heat addition in Btu/hr.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with heat transfer in a process, especially at constant pressure, the heat is related to the change in enthalpy. The formula is Q = m * ΔH, where m is the mass flow rate and ΔH is the change in specific enthalpy.

But wait, since this is a gas mixture, I should probably find the specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) for the mixture. Then, the change in enthalpy would be the mass flow rate multiplied by the average specific heat multiplied by the temperature change.

So the first step is to find the specific heat of the mixture. For ideal gases, the specific heat is additive based on mole fractions. So I'll need the Cp values for N2 and Ar.

I think I remember that the specific heat at constant pressure for diatomic gases like N2 is around 0.2967 Btu/lbm-°F (but wait, let me double-check. Oh right, I think N2 has a Cp of approximately 0.2967 Btu/lbm·°F, and argon, which is monatomic, has a Cp of about 0.1724 Btu/lbm·°F. So I can use these values.)

So the mole fraction for N2 is 0.4, and Ar is 0.6. The mixture's Cp would be 0.4*0.2967 + 0.6*0.1724. Let me calculate that:

0.4 * 0.2967 = 0.11868
0.6 * 0.1724 = 0.10344
Adding them gives 0.22212 Btu/lbm·°F.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, right! The specific heat I'm using here is in Btu per pound-mass per degree Fahrenheit, which is correct for the units here.

Next, I need to calculate the temperature change. The inlet temperature is 80°F, and the outlet is 450°F. So ΔT is 450 - 80 = 370°F.

Now, the mass flow rate is given as 2500 lbm/hr. So the heat transfer rate Q is m_dot * Cp_mix * ΔT.

Putting the numbers in:

Q = 2500 lbm/hr * 0.22212 Btu/lbm·°F * 370°F.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, 2500 * 0.22212 = Let's see, 2500 * 0.2 is 500, 2500 *0.02212 is about 55.3 (since 0.02 is 50, 0.00212 is ~5.3). So total is 555.3 approximately.

Wait, wait, let me calculate it accurately.

2500 * 0.22212 = 2500 * 0.22212.

0.22212 * 2500 = 555.3 Btu/°F * lbm/hr (lbm·°F is the unit, I think). Wait, no, the units would be Btu/hr per °F? Hmm, no, let me think again.

Wait, the units:

Cp is in Btu/(lbm·°F), mass flow rate is lbm/hr.

So when you multiply 2500 lbm/hr * 0.22212 Btu/(lbm·°F) * 370°F, the lbm units cancel, and you're left with Btu/hr.

So 2500 * 0.22212 = let me calculate that exactly.

0.22212 * 2500.

Well, 2500 * 0.2 = 500.

2500 * 0.02212 = 2500 * 0.02 is 50, 2500 * 0.00212 is 5.3.

So 50 + 5.3 = 55.3.

So 500 + 55.3 = 555.3.

Then multiply by 370°F:

555.3 * 370.

Let me compute that.

555.3 * 300 = 166,590.

555.3 * 70 = 38,871.

So total 166,590 + 38,871 = 205,461 Btu/hr.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 151466.45 Btu/hr

B: 175000

C: 135000

D: 200000

E: 210000

F: 180000

G: 160000

H: 120000

I: 190000

J: 165000

Hmm, 205,461 is closest to option D (200,000) or perhaps E. But let me recheck my calculations because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong specific heat values. Let me confirm the Cp values for N2 and Ar.

N2: I think the correct value is 0.2967 Btu/lbm·°F. Yes, that's right.

Argon: For monatomic gases, Cp is (5/2)R/(M). Wait, I might be mixing up units here. Let me think in terms of specific heat.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the specific heat in SI units is more familiar, but I have to make sure I'm using the right units. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the specific heat in Btu/lbm·°F.

Wait, another thought: Some sources might express specific heat in different units, but I'm pretty confident that for N2, Cp is about 0.2967 Btu/lbm·°F, and Ar is about 0.1724 Btu/lbm·°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the molar specific heats and then convert to mass basis.

Wait, let's try that approach to double-check.

The molar specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) for diatomic gases (like N2) is (7/2)R, and for monatomic gases (like Ar), it's (5/2)R.

Wait, R here is the gas constant. But R in which units?

Wait, in SI units, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but when using Btu, I think R is 10.7316 ft·lbf/lbmol·°R. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of Btu.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the specific heats on a molar basis and then adjust for molar masses.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, find the molar specific heat (Cp) for each gas.

N2: diatomic, so Cp = (7/2) R.

Ar: monatomic, Cp = (5/2) R.

Wait, but R here is the universal gas constant. In units that match, perhaps.

Wait, but if I'm using R as 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R), which is a common value.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to use the specific heat on a per mole basis and then find the mixture's specific heat per unit mass.

So for the mixture, the molar Cp would be 0.4*(7/2 R) + 0.6*(5/2 R) = [0.4*(3.5 R) + 0.6*(2.5 R)].

So that's 0.4*3.5 = 1.4, 0.6*2.5=1.5. So total Cp_molar = (1.4 +1.5) R = 2.9 R.

Wait, R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R). But I'm not sure if that's the right way to proceed, because I need to get specific heat in Btu/lbm·°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the specific heat per unit mass by considering the molar mass.

Let me try that.

Molar mass of N2 is 28 lbm/lbmol. For Ar, it's 39.948 lbm/lbmol, approximately 40 lbm/lbmol.

So for N2, the specific heat per unit mass would be Cp_molar / M.

So for N2:

Cp_molar = (7/2) R = 3.5 R.

Similarly, R is 10.7316 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R). Wait, but we need to convert this into Btu.

Wait, 1 Btu is approximately 778.169 ft·lbf.

So R = 10.7316 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R) = 10.7316 / 778.169 Btu/(lbmol·°R) ≈ 0.01381 Btu/(lbmol·°R).

So for N2, Cp_molar = 3.5 * 0.01381 ≈ 0.048335 Btu/(lbmol·°R).

Then, specific heat per mass would be Cp_molar / M.

So for N2, 0.048335 / 28 ≈ 0.001726 Btu/(lbm·°R).

Wait, that seems really low compared to the 0.2967 I had before. Something's wrong here.

Wait, I think I messed up the units. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should use the specific heat in Btu/lbm·°F directly.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should use the specific heat in BTU/lbm·°F as follows.

Wait, perhaps the correct values are:

Nitrogen (N2) Cp = 0.2967 BTU/lbm·°F.

Argon (Ar) Cp = 0.1724 BTU/lbm·°F.

So using these, the mixture's Cp is 0.4 * 0.2967 + 0.6 * 0.1724 = let's calculate again.

0.4 * 0.2967 = 0.11868

0.6 * 0.1724 = 0.10344

Adding them: 0.22212 BTU/lbm·°F.

So that part seems correct.

Then, temperature change is 370°F.

Mass flow rate is 2500 lbm/hr.

So Q = m_dot * Cp * ΔT.

So that's 2500 * 0.22212 * 370.

Calculating that:

2500 * 0.22212 = 555.3, as before.

555.3 * 370 = ?

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

555.3 * 370 = ?

Let me break it down:

555.3 * 300 = 166,590

555.3 * 70 = 38,871

So 166,590 + 38,871 = 205,461 Btu/hr.

Hmm, but looking back at the options, the closest is option D (200,000) and option E (210,000). Wait, my calculation gives 205,461, which isn't exactly any of the options. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the specific heats are given at different units. Wait, maybe I should have used the specific heat in BTU per lbmol per °F and then converted to per lbm.

Wait, let's try that approach.

Compute the molar specific heat, then multiply by the number of moles per unit mass.

So for N2: molar mass is 28 lbm/lbmol.

Molar specific heat (Cp) for N2 is (7/2) R, and for Ar, it's (5/2) R.

R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R) = but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1.986 cal/(mol·K), but that's in different units. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific heat capacity on a molar basis in BTU units is a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the molar specific heat for N2 and Ar in BTU/(lbmol·°F).

I think for N2, Cp is about 6.905 BTU/(lbmol·°F), and for Ar, it's about 4.981 BTU/(lbmol·°F). Hmm, wait, let me confirm that.

Wait, I think for diatomic gases, the molar Cp is about 6.95 BTU/(lbmol·°F), and for monatomic gases, it's about 4.98 BTU/(lbmol·°F). So let's use these numbers.

So the molar Cp for the mixture is:

0.4 * 6.905 + 0.6 * 4.981.

Calculating that:

0.4 * 6.905 = 2.762

0.6 * 4.981 = 2.9886

Sum: 2.762 + 2.9886 = 5.7506 BTU/(lbmol·°F).

Now, to get the specific heat per unit mass, I need to divide by the molar mass of the mixture.

Wait, the molar mass of the mixture can be found from the mole fractions and individual molar masses.

Molar mass M = 0.4 * 28 (N2) + 0.6 * 39.948 (Ar).

So 0.4 * 28 = 11.2

0.6 * 39.948 ≈ 23.9688

Sum: 11.2 + 23.9688 = 35.1688 lbm/lbmol.

So the specific heat per unit mass is 5.7506 / 35.1688 ≈ 0.1636 BTU/(lbm·°F).

Wait, that's different from the 0.22212 I calculated earlier. So now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the first approach was incorrect because I used specific heat per lbm directly without considering that the mole fractions affect the molar mass. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first method is correct because each gas contributes their own per mass specific heat based on their mole fractions. Let me think: For ideal gases, the specific heat of the mixture is the mole-fraction-weighted sum of each gas's specific heat per unit mass. So the first approach was correct.

Wait, but in that case, the specific heat of the mixture was 0.22212 BTU/(lbm·°F), leading to Q=205,461, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values.

Wait, another idea: I might have mixed up the units of specific heat. Let me check the correct specific heat values again.

Upon checking a reference, for N2, the specific heat at constant pressure is approximately 0.2967 BTU/lbm·°F, and for Ar, it's 0.1724 BTU/lbm·°F. So the first calculation is correct.

So then, the heat rate is 205,461 Btu/hr. But the options don't include this value. The closest is option D (200,000) and E (210,000). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the temperature change is in Rankine instead of Fahrenheit? No, because the formula uses ΔT in °F, since specific heat is per °F.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the temperatures to Rankine, but wait, since the change is the same in Fahrenheit and Rankine (ΔT in °F equals ΔT in °R), so that doesn't affect the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the product.

Let me recalculate 2500 * 0.22212 * 370.

First, 0.22212 * 370 = ?

0.2 * 370 = 74

0.02212 * 370 = let's see, 0.02 *370=7.4, 0.00212*370=0.784. So 7.4 + 0.784=8.184.

So total 74 + 8.184=82.184.

Then, 2500 * 82.184 = 2500 *82.184 = 205,460 Btu/hr.

Same result as before.

Looking back at the options, none match 205,460. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem assumes that the specific heat is constant and uses average values, or perhaps uses the specific heat at different temperatures.

Wait, but the temperature increases from 80°F to 450°F. Maybe the specific heat varies with temperature, but the problem probably assumes constant specific heat, given the data provided.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific heat at the average temperature. Hmm, but that might complicate things beyond the scope of the problem.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the specific heat values I'm using are in different units, like per mole. Let me double-check the specific heat values in BTU/lbm·°F.

Upon checking, yes, N2 is about 0.2967 BTU/lbm·°F, and Ar is about 0.1724 BTU/lbm·°F. So that seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach. Wait, the problem says it's a constant pressure process, so Q = m_dot * Cp_mix * ΔT. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for Cp_mix.

0.4 * 0.2967 = 0.11868

0.6 * 0.1724 = 0.10344

Adding them: 0.22212. Yes.

So, 2500 lbm/hr * 0.22212 BTU/lbm·°F = 555.3 BTU/°F-hr.

Multiply by 370°F: 555.3 *370 = 205,461 Btu/hr.

Wait, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is 205,461, but it's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the specific heat is given in cal units instead of BTU. No, the question asks for Btu/hr, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the specific heat in J and then convert to Btu, but that seems more complicated and unlikely
