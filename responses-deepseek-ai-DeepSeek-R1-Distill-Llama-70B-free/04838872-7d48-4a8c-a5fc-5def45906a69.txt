Okay, so I've got this question about polymer chemistry here. It's about calculating the number average and weight average degree of polymerization, X_n and X_w. Hmm, I remember that the degree of polymerization is related to the molecular weight, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

The question gives me the definitions for M_n (number average molecular weight) and M_w (weight average molecular weight). Let me try to recall what these are. Oh right, M_n is calculated by summing the total weight divided by the total moles, or equivalently, it's the sum of (N_i * M_i) divided by the sum of N_i. And M_w is the sum of (W_i * M_i) divided by the sum of W_i, which can also be written as sum(N_i * M_i²) / sum(N_i * M_i).

But the question is about X_n and X_w, the degree of polymerization averages. I think the degree of polymerization X is related to M_i. Oh wait, for a polymer, the molecular weight M_i is the degree of polymerization X multiplied by the molar mass of the repeating unit, say M_0. So M_i = X_i * M_0. But since M_0 is a constant for a given polymer, maybe when taking averages, it factors out.

So if X_i = M_i / M_0, then the average X would be the average of M_i divided by M_0. So for X_n, it should be (sum N_i X_i) / sum N_i, which would be (sum N_i (M_i/M_0)) / sum N_i. The M_0 cancels out, so yes, X_n is sum(N_i X_i) / sum N_i.

Similarly, for weight average X_w, which is the weight average of X. Since M_w is sum(W_i M_i) / sum W_i, substituting M_i = X_i M_0, that becomes sum(W_i X_i M_0) / sum W_i. Again, M_0 is a constant, so X_w would be sum(W_i X_i) / sum W_i.

Wait, but looking back at the given definitions, M_w can also be written as sum(N_i M_i²) / sum(N_i M_i). Substituting M_i = X_i M_0, that becomes sum(N_i (X_i² M_0²)) / sum(N_i X_i M_0). The M_0² in numerator and M_0 in denominator gives M_0, so X_w would be [sum(N_i X_i²) * M_0²] / [sum(N_i X_i) * M_0)] = [sum(N_i X_i²) / sum(N_i X_i)] * M_0. Hmm, but wait, since M_w is also sum(W_i M_i)/sum(W_i), which is sum(W_i X_i M_0) / sum W_i. So X_w is sum(W_i X_i) / sum W_i.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The weight average molecular weight M_w is sum(W_i M_i)/sum W_i. Since W_i is the weight of each species, which is N_i * M_i * M_0 (since M_i = X_i M_0, and N_i is moles, so W_i = N_i * M_i = N_i X_i M_0).

So substituting W_i into M_w: sum( N_i X_i M_0 * X_i M_0 ) / sum( N_i X_i M_0 ). So numerator is sum( N_i X_i² M_0² ), denominator is sum( N_i X_i M_0 ). So M_w is [sum N_i X_i² M_0²] / [sum N_i X_i M_0 ] = (M_0 sum N_i X_i² ) / (sum N_i X_i ). So X_w is [sum N_i X_i² ] / [sum N_i X_i ].

Wait, but earlier I thought X_w is sum(W_i X_i)/sum W_i. Let me see. Since W_i is N_i X_i M_0, then sum W_i X_i is sum N_i X_i² M_0. Sum W_i is sum N_i X_i M_0. So X_w would be [sum N_i X_i² M_0 ] / [sum N_i X_i M_0 ] = [sum N_i X_i² ] / [sum N_i X_i ], same as before. So both approaches give the same result.

So X_n is sum N_i X_i / sum N_i, and X_w is sum N_i X_i² / sum N_i X_i.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because in the given options, the X_n and X_w are defined in terms of N_i, W_i, etc., so I need to see which option matches what I've derived.

Looking at the options:

Option A:
X_n = (sum N_i X_i) / (sum N_i)
X_w = (sum N_i X_i²) / (sum N_i X_i)
That's exactly what I derived. So that's option A.

Wait, let me double-check the other options to make sure there isn't a trick.

Option B: X_n is sum W_i X_i / sum W_i, which would be the same as X_w in my earlier reasoning. But no, because X_n is number average, which should be sum N_i X_i / sum N_i, not W_i.

Option C: X_n has sum N_i X_i divided by sum N_i X_i^0.5. That doesn't make sense to me.

Option D: X_n is sum w_i X_i / sum w_i. Wait, w_i is weight fraction. Since W_i = w_i * W_total, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. But I don't think that's the case; number average shouldn't involve weight fractions.

Option E: X_n is sum N_i X_i / sum N_i X_i squared. No, that doesn't fit.

Option F: Complicated fractions with squares, not matching.

Option G: X_n is sum N_i X_i^3 / sum N_i X_i, which is like a z-average perhaps, not number average.

Option H: X_n is sum N_i X_i^2 / sum N_i X_i, which is the same as X_w in option A. And X_w is sum N_i X_i / sum N_i, which is X_n. So H swaps the two.

Option I: Both X_n and X_w are the same as H's, which can't be right since they should be different.

Option J: Uses W_i in X_n, which doesn't fit.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The question asks for the derivation of equations for the number average degree of polymerization, \( X_n \), and the weight average degree of polymerization, \( X_w \), based on the given definitions of molecular weight averages. The degree of polymerization \( X_i \) is related to the molecular weight \( M_i \) by \( M_i = X_i \cdot M_0 \), where \( M_0 \) is the molar mass of the repeating unit. Since \( M_0 \) is constant, it cancels out when calculating averages.

For \( X_n \), the number average is derived as:

\[
X_n = \frac{\sum N_i X_i}{\sum N_i}
\]

where \( N_i \) is the number of moles of species with degree of polymerization \( X_i \).

For \( X_w \), the weight average is derived as:

\[
X_w = \frac{\sum N_i X_i^2}{\sum N_i X_i}
\]

This is consistent with the definition of weight average molecular weight \( M_w \), where the molecular weight is replaced by the degree of polymerization.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Matches the derived equations for \( X_n \) and \( X_w \).
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it misrepresents \( X_n \) and \( X_w \) using weight fractions and incorrect powers of \( X_i \).
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it introduces incorrect powers of \( X_i \) in the denominators.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it uses weight fractions \( w_i \) for \( X_n \), which is inconsistent with the definition of number average.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as it introduces incorrect powers of \( X_i \) in the denominators.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it introduces overly complex and incorrect expressions.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it misrepresents \( X_n \) and \( X_w \) with incorrect powers of \( X_i \).
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as it swaps the definitions of \( X_n \) and \( X_w \).
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it makes \( X_n \) and \( X_w \) identical, which is not consistent with their definitions.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as it uses weight fractions \( W_i \) inappropriately.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: \( X_n = \frac{\sum N_i X_i}{\sum N_i}, \, X_w = \frac{\sum N_i X_i^2}{\sum N_i X_i} \)**.
