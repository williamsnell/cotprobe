Okay, so I've got this problem here about heating water in a pipe, and I need to find the length of the pipe required. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem gives me the initial and final temperatures of the water. The initial temperature is 50°F, which converts to 283.3 K, and the final is 80°F, which is 300 K. The pipe has an inner diameter of 2 inches, which is 0.0508 meters. The wall temperature is a constant 210°F, converting to 372.2 K. The average fluid velocity is 10 feet per second, which I might need to convert to meters per second because the standard units for these kinds of calculations are usually in meters, kilograms, seconds, etc.

Hmm, I think this is a heat transfer problem involving convection. I remember that when a fluid flows through a pipe and heat is transferred, we can use the concept of the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD) or perhaps the concept of the heat transfer coefficient and the overall heat transfer.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, this might be a problem about determining the length of the pipe needed to achieve a certain temperature change. So I should think about the energy balance and the heat transfer rate.

Let me recall the formula for heat transfer in a pipe. The heat transfer rate Q is given by Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

Wait, but wait a second, I think that's the basic Newton's law of cooling formula. But in this case, since the fluid is moving, I might need to use the concept of the overall heat transfer coefficient, U, multiplied by the log mean temperature difference, LMTD.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. For a double-pipe heat exchanger, we often use the LMTD approach, but here it's just a single pipe with a constant wall temperature. So maybe the approach is different.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a problem involving the Graetz number, which relates to heat transfer in laminar flow in pipes with a constant wall temperature. But Graetz number is more for laminar flow, but I don't know the flow regime here because I don't know the Reynolds number yet.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the Reynolds number first to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number Re is given by Re = (v * d * ρ) / μ, where v is velocity, d is diameter, ρ is density, and μ is dynamic viscosity.

But I don't have the viscosity or the density of water at the given temperature. Hmm, but perhaps I can calculate it using known properties. Let me think about the temperature. The initial temp is 50°F, but the average temp would be somewhere between 50°F and 80°F, maybe around 65°F (18.3°C). Alternatively, maybe I should use the properties at the average bulk temperature.

Wait, the fluid is water, so properties can be found. At 65°F, I think the density (ρ) is roughly 998 kg/m³, and the dynamic viscosity (μ) is about 0.00098 kg/(m·s). Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check these values, but for the sake of proceeding, I'll go with these approximations.

So, velocity v is given as 10 ft/s. Let me convert that to m/s. Since 1 ft is 0.3048 meters, 10 ft/s is 10 * 0.3048 = 3.048 m/s.

The diameter d is 2 inches, which is 0.0508 meters.

So, Re = (v * d * ρ) / μ = (3.048 m/s * 0.0508 m * 998 kg/m³) / 0.00098 kg/(m·s).

Let me compute the numerator first. 3.048 * 0.0508 ≈ 0.1547 m²/s. Multiply by 998 kg/m³: 0.1547 * 998 ≈ 154.2 kg/(s·m).

Now divide by μ, which is 0.00098 kg/(m·s). So 154.2 / 0.00098 ≈ 157,400. So Re is about 157,400, which is greater than 10,000, so the flow is turbulent.

Since the flow is turbulent, I can use the Dittus-Boelter correlation for the Nusselt number, which is Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^n, where n is 0.4 for heating (since the fluid is being heated, the property ratio is greater than 1) or 0.3 for cooling. So n would be 0.4 here.

Wait, the Dittus-Boelter equation is Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^n, where n is 0.4 if the fluid is being heated, and 0.3 if cooled. So since the water is being heated, n=0.4.

But to use this, I need the Prandtl number, Pr, which is calculated as Pr = (μ * c_p) / k, where c_p is specific heat at constant pressure, and k is the thermal conductivity.

Again, using the average temperature of the water. Let's take the average between 50°F and 80°F, which is 65°F (18.3°C). At this temperature, for water:

- c_p is approximately 4186 J/(kg·K)
- k (thermal conductivity) is about 0.651 W/(m·K)
- μ is 0.00098 kg/(m·s)
Wait, but wait: I think at 20°C, μ is about 0.001003 kg/(m·s), so at 65°F (18.3°C), perhaps a bit less, but using 0.00098 is okay.

So, Pr = (μ * c_p) / k = (0.00098 kg/(m·s) * 4186 J/(kg·K)) / 0.651 W/(m·K)

Compute numerator: 0.00098 * 4186 ≈ 4.101 J/(s·m)
Divide by 0.651: 4.101 / 0.651 ≈ 6.3. So Pr ≈ 6.3.

Now, compute Nu using Dittus-Boelter: Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.4

Re is 157400, so Re^0.8: Let me compute that. 157400^0.8. Hmm, I might need to take logs or use an approximate approach.

But perhaps I can compute 157400^0.8 step by step. Let me note that 157400 is about 1.574e5.

Alternatively, using logarithms: ln(157400) = ln(1.574e5) = ln(1.574) + ln(1e5) ≈ 0.454 + 11.513 = 11.967.

Multiply by 0.8: 11.967 * 0.8 ≈ 9.5736.

Exponentiate: e^9.5736 ≈ 14,000? Wait, e^9 is about 8103, e^10 is about 22026. 9.5736 is about 9.57, which is 9 + 0.57.

e^9.57 ≈ e^9 * e^0.57. e^0.57 ≈ 1.77, so 8103 * 1.77 ≈ 14340.

Wait, but maybe using a calculator would be more accurate, but since I'm just estimating, let's say Re^0.8 ≈ 14340.

Then, Pr^0.4: Pr is 6.3, so 6.3^0.4. Let me compute that. 6.3^0.4 is approximately 6.3^(2/5). Let's see, 6.3^(1/5): the fifth root of 6.3 is approximately 1.47, so squared is 2.16.

So, Nu ≈ 0.023 * 14340 * 2.16.

Compute 0.023 * 14340: 14340 * 0.023 = 14340 * 0.02 is 286.8, 14340 * 0.003 is 43.02 → total 329.82.

Multiply by 2.16: 329.82 * 2.16 ≈ 329.82 * 2 = 659.64, 329.82 * 0.16 ≈ 52.77 → total 712.41.

So, Nu ≈ 712.41.

Now, Nu is defined as (h * d)/k → h = (Nu * k)/d.

So, h = (712.41 * 0.651 W/(m·K)) / 0.0508 m.

Compute numerator: 712.41 * 0.651 ≈ 464.5 W/(m²·K).

Divide by 0.0508 m: 464.5 / 0.0508 ≈ 9150 W/(m²·K).

So the convective heat transfer coefficient h is approximately 9150 W/(m²·K).

Now, the next part is to find the length of the pipe needed to raise the temperature from 283.3 K to 300 K. The pipe wall is at 372.2 K.

I think the formula for the temperature change in a pipe can be approached using the energy balance. The heat transferred Q is equal to the mass flow rate times the specific heat times the temperature change.

But also, Q can be calculated as the heat transfer from the pipe wall to the fluid, which is Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_bulk_avg), but wait, no. Because the bulk temperature changes along the pipe, the temperature difference isn't constant, so the mean temperature difference is needed. Oh wait, since the wall temperature is constant, perhaps we can use the concept of the effectiveness or the logarithmic mean temperature difference.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the equation:

Q = ṁ * c_p * (T_out - T_in) = h * A * (T_wall - T_bulk_avg).

Wait, but T_bulk_avg isn't straightforward because the bulk temperature changes along the pipe. The correct approach here is to use the concept of the average temperature difference over the pipe length, which for a constant wall temperature is (T_wall - T_bulk_in) + (T_wall - T_bulk_out)) / 2, but I think that's for the case where the fluid is heating up, so the average ΔT would be (T_wall - (T_in + T_out)/2). Alternatively, perhaps it's the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD), which is (T_wall - T_in) - (T_wall - T_out))/ln((T_wall - T_in)/(T_wall - T_out))).

Wait, actually, for a pipe where the wall temperature is constant and the fluid is changing temperature, the appropriate mean temperature difference is the LMTD.

The LMTD (log mean temperature difference) is given by:

ΔT_lm = (ΔT_in - ΔT_out) / ln(ΔT_in / ΔT_out)

Where ΔT_in = T_wall - T_in

ΔT_out = T_wall - T_out

So in this case, ΔT_in = 372.2 K - 283.3 K = 88.9 K

ΔT_out = 372.2 K - 300 K = 72.2 K

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because as the fluid moves through the pipe, its temperature increases from T_in to T_out, so the difference (T_wall - T_bulk) decreases. So, the initial difference is higher than the final difference.

Wait, but in our case, the wall is hotter than the fluid, so the fluid is being heated. So:

ΔT_in = T_wall - T_in = 372.2 - 283.3 = 88.9 K

ΔT_out = T_wall - T_out = 372.2 - 300 = 72.2 K

So, the LMTD is (88.9 - 72.2) / ln(88.9 / 72.2) = (16.7) / ln(1.231).

Compute ln(1.231). Let me think: ln(1.2) is about 0.182, ln(1.231) is a bit higher. Let me compute it more accurately. Let me see: 1.231^1 is 1.231, e^0.21 is approx 1.233, so ln(1.231) ≈ 0.21.

So, ΔT_lm ≈ 16.7 / 0.21 ≈ 79.52 K.

Alternatively, using a calculator, ln(1.231) ≈ 0.2075, so 16.7 / 0.2075 ≈ 80.48 K.

Wait, maybe I should compute it accurately. Let me compute 88.9 / 72.2 ≈ 1.231. So ln(1.231) is approximately 0.2075.

So, ΔT_lm = (88.9 -72.2) / 0.2075 = 16.7 / 0.2075 ≈ 80.48 K.

So, the average temperature difference is approximately 80.48 K.

Now, the heat transfer rate Q is given by Q = h * A * ΔT_lm.

But Q is also equal to the rate of energy change of the fluid, which is Q = ṁ * c_p * (T_out - T_in).

So, setting them equal: ṁ * c_p * (T_out - T_in) = h * A * ΔT_lm.

We can solve for the area A, which is π * d * L, where L is the length of the pipe.

So, ṁ is the mass flow rate, which is density * velocity * cross-sectional area.

The cross-sectional area of the pipe is π * (d/2)^2 = (π d²)/4.

So, ṁ = ρ * v * (π d² /4).

Now, putting it all together:

ρ * v * (π d² /4) * c_p * (T_out - T_in) = h * π * d * L * ΔT_lm

We can solve for L:

L = [ (ρ * v * (π d² /4) * c_p * (ΔT)) ] / (h * π * d * ΔT_lm )

Simplify the equation:

Cancel π from numerator and denominator:

L = [ (ρ * v * d² /4 * c_p * ΔT) ] / (h * d * ΔT_lm )

Simplify d²/d = d:

L = [ (ρ * v * d * c_p * ΔT ) /4 ] / (h * ΔT_lm )

Which is L = (ρ * v * d * c_p * (T_out - T_in)) / (4 * h * ΔT_lm )

Now, let's plug in the known values.

But before that, let me make sure all the units are consistent.

Given:

- ρ: I'm using 998 kg/m³ at the average temp.
- v: 3.048 m/s
- d: 0.0508 m
- c_p: 4186 J/(kg·K)
- T_out - T_in: 300 K - 283.3 K = 16.7 K
- h: 9150 W/(m²·K) = 9150 J/(s·m²·K)
- ΔT_lm: ~80.48 K

Putting it all into the equation:

L = (998 kg/m³ * 3.048 m/s * 0.0508 m * 4186 J/(kg·K) * 16.7 K) / (4 * 9150 J/(s·m²·K) * 80.48 K)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

First, numerator:

998 * 3.048 * 0.0508 * 4186 * 16.7

Let me compute step by step.

Compute 998 * 3.048 = approx 998 * 3 = 2994, 998 * 0.048 = 47.904 → total 2994 + 47.904 = 3041.904.

Then multiply by 0.0508: 3041.904 * 0.0508 → Let's compute 3000 * 0.0508 = 152.4, 41.904 * 0.0508 ≈ 2.13 → total ≈ 152.4 + 2.13 = 154.53.

Now, multiply by 4186: 154.53 * 4186 → Let me compute 150 * 4186 = 628,000 (approx). 4.53 *4186 ≈ 4*4186=16,744 + 0.53*4186≈ 2,220 → total ≈ 16,744 + 2,220 = 18,964. So 150 gives 628,000, 4.53 gives approx 18,964 → total numerator so far: 628,000 + 18,964 ≈ 646,964.

Multiply by 16.7: 646,964 * 16.7 → Let me compute 646,964 * 10 = 6,469,640; 646,964 * 6 = 3,881,784; 646,964 * 0.7=453,874.8 → total 6,469,640 + 3,881,784 = 10,351,424 + 453,874.8 ≈ 10,805,298.8.

So numerator ≈ 10,805,298.8 J·kg/(m·s²) → Wait, no, let me think about the units, but maybe I can just compute the numerical value.

Denominator: 4 * 9150 * 80.48 → 4 * 9150 = 36,600 → 36,600 * 80.48 → Let me compute 36,600 * 80 = 2,928,000, 36,600 * 0.48 = 17,568 → total 2,928,000 +17,568 = 2,945,568.

So denominator is 2,945,568 J/(s·m²·K) * K → J/(s·m²).

Wait, but actually, the denominator is (4 * h * ΔT_lm) → units would be (dimensionless * J/(s·m²·K) * K ) → J/(s·m²).
