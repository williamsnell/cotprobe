Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding the value of 1/m + 1/n where m and n are the roots of the quadratic equation 2x² + 15x + 16 = 0. Hmm, I remember that for quadratic equations, there are some formulas related to the sum and product of roots. Let me think.

Oh right, for any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots m + n is equal to -b/a, and the product mn is c/a. So in this case, a is 2, b is 15, and c is 16. 

Let me write that down:
Sum of roots m + n = -b/a = -15/2.
Product of roots mn = c/a = 16/2 = 8.

Now, the question is asking for 1/m + 1/n. I need to express this in terms of m + n and mn. I remember that 1/m + 1/n can be rewritten as (m + n)/(mn). Oh yeah, because when you add fractions, you get a common denominator. So (n + m)/mn.

So substituting the values I have:
1/m + 1/n = (m + n)/(mn) = (-15/2) / 8.

Wait, let me compute that. So (-15/2) divided by 8 is the same as (-15/2) multiplied by (1/8), right? So that's (-15) * (1) / (2*8) = -15/16.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, and then divided by 8. So 7.5/8 is 0.9375. But since it's negative, it's -0.9375. 

Looking at the options, option G is -0.9375. So that should be the correct answer. 

I think that's it. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sum is -15/2, product is 8. 1/m + 1/n is (sum)/(product), so (-15/2)/8 equals -15/16, which is -0.9375. Yep, that's option G.

To find the value of \( \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are the roots of the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 15x + 16 = 0 \), we use the relationships for the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). These are:

- Sum of roots: \( m + n = -\frac{b}{a} \)
- Product of roots: \( mn = \frac{c}{a} \)

For the given equation:
- \( a = 2 \), \( b = 15 \), \( c = 16 \)
- \( m + n = -\frac{15}{2} \)
- \( mn = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)

The expression \( \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} \) can be rewritten as \( \frac{m + n}{mn} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{m + n}{mn} = \frac{-\frac{15}{2}}{8} = -\frac{15}{16} = -0.9375
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: -0.9375**
