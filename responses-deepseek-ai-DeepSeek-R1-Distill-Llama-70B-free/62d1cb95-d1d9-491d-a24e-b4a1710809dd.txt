Question:

Explain the mechanism of the genetic determination of sex in humans.

Options:

A: The presence of two X chromosomes in the absence of a Y chromosome has no impact on the sex of an individual.
B: The number of autosomes determines the sex of an individual.
C: The sex of an individual is determined by the number of X chromosomes, irrespective of the Y chromosome.
D: The combination of two Y chromosomes determines that an individual will be female.
E: The presence of an X chromosome and an additional chromosome other than Y determines that an individual will be male.
F: Environmental factors determine the genetic sex of an individual.
G: The presence of the X chromosome determines that an individual will be male.
H: The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male.
I: The process of meiosis determines the sex of an individual.
J: The total number of chromosomes in an individual dictates their sex.

Okay, so I have this question about the genetic determination of sex in humans, and I need to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, in humans, I remember that sex is determined by the sex chromosomes, which are X and Y. Most people have 46 chromosomes in total, right? And of those, 44 are autosomes, which don't determine sex, and then there are the two sex chromosomes. 

Wait, so females typically have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y (XY). Oh right, that's the usual setup. So the presence of the Y chromosome is what makes a person male. Because the Y carries the SRY gene, which is crucial for testis development. Without it, the gonads develop as ovaries.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says that two X's without a Y has no impact on sex. That's not right. Because two X's would make the person female, so it definitely impacts the sex.

Option B: Number of autosomes determines sex. No, autosomes are the same in males and females (44), so that's incorrect. It's the sex chromosomes that matter.

Option C: Sex is determined by the number of X's, regardless of Y. Hmm. Wait, a person can have more than two X's, like XXY (Klinefelter's), which is male. Or XXX, which is female. So the presence of Y determines male, not just the count of X. So option C doesn't sound right because the Y plays a role.

Option D: Two Y's make someone female. No, that's wrong. Two Y's would be XY, but wait, no, two Y's would be in a person with XYY, which is still male. So D is incorrect.

Option E: X plus another non-Y chromosome makes male. Wait, the other chromosome is Y for males. Because males are XY. So E says if there's an X and another that's not Y, like another X, that would make male? No, because females are XX. So E is wrong.

Option F: Environmental factors determine genetic sex. No, genetic sex is determined by chromosomes at conception. Environmental factors can influence gender identity, but not the genetic sex.

Option G: Presence of X makes male. No, because females have two X's. So that's incorrect.

Option H: Presence of Y makes male. That sounds right. Because if you have a Y, you develop testes, which makes you male. So this is likely the correct answer.

Option I: Meiosis determines sex. Meiosis is the process that produces gametes with either X or Y, but the determination of the individual's sex is based on whether the sperm was X or Y. So while meiosis is part of the process, it's not determining the individual's sex directly. The presence of Y in the fertilized egg does.

Option J: Total chromosome number dictates sex. No, because humans can have variations like 45 (Turner's: X0) or 47 (like XXY), but the total number isn't the determinant. It's the presence of Y.

So the correct answer should be H: The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male.

The genetic determination of sex in humans is based on the presence of specific sex chromosomes. Typically, females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The Y chromosome plays a critical role in determining male sex because it carries the SRY gene, which triggers the development of testes. Without the Y chromosome, the gonads develop as ovaries, resulting in female development.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Two X chromosomes in the absence of a Y chromosome determine female sex, so this has an impact.
- **B**: Incorrect. Autosomes do not determine sex; sex is determined by the sex chromosomes.
- **C**: Incorrect. While the number of X chromosomes influences sex, the presence of the Y chromosome is the determining factor for male sex.
- **D**: Incorrect. Two Y chromosomes (e.g., XYY) still result in male sex, not female.
- **E**: Incorrect. The presence of an X and a Y chromosome determines male sex, not the presence of an X and another non-Y chromosome.
- **F**: Incorrect. Genetic sex is determined by chromosomes at conception, not environmental factors.
- **G**: Incorrect. The presence of an X chromosome does not determine male sex; females also have X chromosomes.
- **H**: Correct. The presence of the Y chromosome determines male sex due to the SRY gene.
- **I**: Incorrect. While meiosis produces gametes with X or Y chromosomes, the individual's sex is determined by the presence of the Y chromosome.
- **J**: Incorrect. The total number of chromosomes does not dictate sex; it is the specific sex chromosomes that matter.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H
