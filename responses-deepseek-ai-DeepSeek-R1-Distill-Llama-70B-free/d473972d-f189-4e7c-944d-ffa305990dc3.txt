Okay, so I've got this question about the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). Hmm, I remember that the ELM is a theory in psychology about how people process persuasive messages. I think it was developed by Petty and Cacioppo. So, the question is asking when a person is most likely to use the "central route" of processing.

Wait, right, the central route involves careful consideration of the arguments, like when someone is really thinking through the information. The other route, the peripheral route, is more about superficial cues, like how attractive the speaker is or the number of arguments without really thinking about their quality.

So the question is, under what condition does someone use the central route? The options are A to I. Let me think about each option.

Option A: The message is within his latitude of acceptance. Latitude of acceptance refers to the range of ideas a person finds acceptable. If the message is within that, does that mean they process it centrally? Or maybe they agree, so they don't need to think too much. Wait, maybe when the message is in their acceptance range, they might be more open, but I'm not sure if that's when they use central processing.

Option B: He's in a neutral or slightly negative mood. I'm not too sure about this. Maybe a negative mood could make someone analyze more because they're more critical? Or perhaps a positive mood makes them more likely to take the peripheral route.

Option C: The message is outside his latitude of acceptance. So if the message is outside what they find acceptable, maybe they'll think more about it. Like, if someone presents an idea that's different from what I believe, I might engage more with the arguments to see if I should change my mind. So that might lead to central processing.

Option D: Everyone else in the group disagrees with the message. Hmm, social pressure maybe. If others disagree, maybe the person feels the need to evaluate the arguments more carefully because they're in the minority. Or perhaps they just go along with the group without much thought. Not sure.

Option E: Everyone else in the group agrees. If others agree, maybe the person doesn't feel the need to think deeply and just goes with the flow, using the peripheral route.

Option F: He strongly disagrees with the message. If he disagrees, maybe he's motivated to counterargue, so he might engage more with the message's arguments, using the central route.

Option G: The message is irrelevant. If it's irrelevant, he probably won't think much about it, so peripheral route.

Option H: He thinks the message is boring. If it's boring, maybe he doesn't engage deeply, so peripheral again.

Option I: He's distracted. Distraction leads to less ability to process deeply, so peripheral route.

Wait, the central route is when people have both the motivation and the ability to process the information. So factors that increase motivation and ability would lead to central processing.

So when is someone motivated to process a message centrally? When the message is personally relevant, when they have a vested interest, or when the message is outside their current beliefs, prompting them to think more.

So looking at the options again. Option C says the message is outside the latitude of acceptance. Latitude of acceptance is like the range of attitudes a person considers acceptable. If the message is outside that, maybe the person is more motivated to think about it, perhaps to counterargue or to see if they should change their views.

Alternatively, if the message is within the latitude of acceptance (option A), the person might agree without much thought, using the peripheral route.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The latitude of acceptance includes the person's current position and the range they find acceptable. If a message is within that, they might not feel the need to process it deeply because it's already in line with their thoughts. But if it's outside, they might be more motivated to evaluate it, leading to central processing.

So the correct answer would be when the message is outside the latitude of acceptance, which is option C.

Alternatively, another factor that influences central processing is personal relevance. If the message is relevant, they're more likely to engage deeply. But none of the options directly state that.

Looking at the options, option C seems to fit because being outside the latitude would prompt more thinking.

The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) describes two routes of information processing: the central route and the peripheral route. The central route involves careful consideration of arguments and is more likely when individuals are motivated and able to engage deeply with the message. Factors that increase motivation, such as personal relevance or a vested interest, often lead to central processing.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: If the message is within the latitude of acceptance, the person may already agree with it and process it peripherally, without deep engagement.
- **Option B**: A neutral or slightly negative mood might influence processing, but it is not directly tied to central route engagement.
- **Option C**: If the message is outside the latitude of acceptance, the person is more motivated to evaluate it critically, leading to central processing.
- **Option D**: Group disagreement could lead to social pressure, but it is unclear if this consistently results in central processing.
- **Option E**: Group agreement might reduce the need for deep engagement, favoring peripheral processing.
- **Option F**: Strong disagreement could motivate counterarguing, but this is not explicitly tied to central processing in the ELM framework.
- **Option G**: Irrelevant messages are unlikely to engage deep processing.
- **Option H**: Boring messages typically lead to peripheral processing.
- **Option I**: Distraction reduces the ability to engage deeply, favoring peripheral processing.

The most consistent answer is **Option C**, as messages outside the latitude of acceptance prompt greater motivation to evaluate arguments, aligning with central route processing.
