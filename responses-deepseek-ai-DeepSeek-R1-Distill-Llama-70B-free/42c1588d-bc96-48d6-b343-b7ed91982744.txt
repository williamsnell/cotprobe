Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the dissociation of nitrogen tetroxide (N₂O₄) into nitrogen dioxide (NO₂). The reaction is N₂O₄ → 2 NO₂. They've given me the mass of N₂O₄, which is 1.588 grams. It's in a 500 cm³ glass vessel at 25°C. The total pressure is 1 atm. I need to find the degree of dissociation (alpha, α) and the value of Kp. Then choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what I know. I remember that for a dissociation reaction like this, the degree of dissociation helps in finding the concentrations of the products and reactants at equilibrium.

First, I think I should find the number of moles of N₂O₄ initially. The molar mass of N₂O₄ is important here. Nitrogen has an atomic weight of about 14, and oxygen is 16. So N₂O₄ would be (2*14) + (4*16) = 28 + 64 = 92 g/mol. So 1.588 grams divided by 92 g/mol gives the moles.

Let me calculate that. 1.588 / 92. Let me do this on paper. 92 into 1.588. 92 goes into 158 once (since 92*1=92), remainder is 66, bring down the 8: 668. 92*7 is 644, so another 7, remainder 24. So approximately 0.01726 moles. Wait, wait, let me check that again. Wait, 1.588 divided by 92. Let me compute 92 * 0.017.

92 * 0.017 = 1.564. Oh, because 0.01 *92 is 0.92, 0.007 *92 is 0.644. So 0.92 + 0.644 = 1.564. So 1.588 - 1.564 = 0.024. So 0.024 /92 is approximately 0.00026. So total is about 0.01726 mol. Let me call it approximately 0.01726 moles.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me compute it accurately:

1.588 /92 = ?

Well, 92 * 0.017 = 1.564. Subtract that from 1.588, we get 0.024 grams. 0.024 /92 = 0.0002609 mol. So total is 0.0172609 mol. Approximately 0.01726 mol.

Okay, so initial moles of N₂O4: n = 0.01726 mol.

The volume is 500 cm³, which is 0.5 liters. So the initial concentration would be n/V = 0.01726 / 0.5 = 0.03452 M.

So the initial concentration of N₂O4 is 0.03452 M. Since it's dissociating into 2 moles of NO₂, but let's set up the ICE table.

Let me let the degree of dissociation be α. Then, for every mole of N₂O4 that dissociates, it produces 2 moles of NO₂.

So initial:
[N₂O4] = 0.03452 M
[NO₂] = 0

Change:
[N₂O4] decreases by α * 0.03452. Or wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it in terms of change.

Wait, the correct way is:

Let me denote the initial concentration of N₂O4 as C = 0.03452 M.

At equilibrium, the concentration of N₂O4 will be C - α*C. Because α is the degree of dissociation, so the amount dissociated is α*C.

Wait, but for gases, sometimes it's easier to think in terms of moles. Because pressure and volume are involved. Alternatively, I can consider the total pressure to find the mole fractions.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the initial moles, then the change.

Initial moles of N₂O4: n = 0.01726 mol.

At dissociation, suppose α is the degree of dissociation. Then, the moles of N₂O4 that dissociate is α*n. Each mole of N₂O4 produces 2 moles of NO₂.

So moles at equilibrium:

N₂O4: n - α*n = n(1 - α)
NO₂: 2 α n

Total moles = n(1 - α) + 2 α n = n(1 - α + 2 α) = n(1 + α)

So the total moles are (0.01726)(1 + α).

The total pressure is given as 1 atm. The volume is 0.5 L. So using PV = n_total RT.

Wait, using the ideal gas law, the total moles can be found, but wait, since it's at 25°C, which is 298 K.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So P V = n_total R T.

Rearranged, n_total = (P V) / (R T) = (1 atm * 0.5 L) / (0.0821 * 298).

Let me compute that.

Compute denominator first: 0.0821 * 298 ≈ 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 24.63, but more accurately:

298 * 0.0821:

200 *0.0821=16.42

90 *0.0821=7.389

8 *0.0821=0.6568

Total: 16.42 +7.389=23.809 +0.6568=24.4658.

So denominator is 24.4658.

n_total = (1 *0.5)/24.4658 ≈ 0.5 /24.4658 ≈ 0.02044 mol.

Wait, but earlier I found that n =0.01726 mol. So according to the ideal gas law, the total moles at equilibrium should be 0.02044 mol.

But from the dissociation, the total moles are n(1 + α) = 0.01726 (1 + α) = 0.02044.

So set up the equation: 0.01726 (1 + α) = 0.02044.

Divide both sides by 0.01726:

1 + α = 0.02044 / 0.01726 ≈ 1.184.

So α ≈ 0.184.

Okay, so the degree of dissociation is approximately 0.184. Now, I need to find Kp.

Wait, Kp is the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures.

The expression for Kp for the reaction N₂O4 ↔ 2 NO₂ is Kp = (P_NO2)^2 / P_N2O4.

So I need to find the partial pressures of each at equilibrium.

First, the total pressure is 1 atm. Let me find the mole fractions.

From earlier, the moles at equilibrium:

N₂O4: n(1 - α) = 0.01726 * (1 - 0.184) ≈ 0.01726 * 0.816 ≈ 0.01407 mol.

NO₂: 2 α n ≈ 2 *0.184 * 0.01726 ≈ 0.00636 * 2 = 0.00636 mol? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2 *0.184 is 0.368, times 0.01726.

Wait, 0.01726 * 0.368 ≈ 0.00636 mol.

Wait, no. Let me compute each:

n_N2O4 = 0.01726 * (1 - 0.184) = 0.01726 *0.816 = let me compute this.

0.01 *0.816=0.00816

0.007 *0.816=0.005712

0.00026*0.816≈ 0.000212.

So 0.00816 +0.005712=0.013872 +0.000212≈0.014084 mol.

n_NO2 = 2 *0.01726 * α = 2 *0.01726 *0.184.

Compute 0.01726 *0.184:

0.01 *0.184=0.00184

0.007 *0.184=0.001288

0.00026 *0.184≈0.00004784.

Adding them: 0.00184 + 0.001288=0.003128 +0.00004784≈0.00317584.

Multiply by 2: 0.00635168 ≈ 0.00635 mol.

So total moles is 0.014084 + 0.00635 ≈0.020434, which matches the earlier calculation.

Now, the mole fractions are each component's moles divided by total moles.

Mole fraction of N₂O4: 0.014084 /0.020434 ≈ 0.6895.

Mole fraction of NO₂:0.00635 /0.020434 ≈ 0.3105.

So partial pressures:

P_N2O4 = mole fraction * total pressure =0.6895 *1 atm ≈0.6895 atm.

P_NO2=0.3105 *1 atm≈0.3105 atm.

Now, Kp=(P_NO2)^2 / P_N2O4 = (0.3105)^2 /0.6895.

Compute 0.3105^2: 0.3105 *0.3105.

Let me compute:

0.3 *0.3 =0.09.

0.3 *0.0105=0.00315.

0.0105 *0.3=0.00315.

0.0105 *0.0105=0.00011025.

So adding all: 0.09 + 0.00315 +0.00315 +0.00011025=0.09641025.

So (0.3105)^2 ≈0.09641.

Now divide by 0.6895:

0.09641 /0.6895 ≈ let's see.

0.6895 *0.14=0.0965. Oh, that's close. So 0.14 approximately.

Wait, 0.6895 *0.14 = 0.09653.

But our numerator is 0.09641, which is just a bit less. So 0.14 approximately, but a little less.

Wait, 0.6895 *0.14 = 0.09653.

So 0.09641 is 0.09641 /0.6895 = 0.14 - (0.09653-0.09641)/(0.6895).

The difference is 0.09653-0.09641=0.00012.

So delta is 0.00012 /0.6895 ≈ 0.000174.

So 0.14 - 0.000174 ≈ 0.1398.

So Kp≈0.1398, approximately 0.14.

Wait, but wait. Let me do a more accurate division:

Compute 0.09641 ÷ 0.6895.

Let me write it as 9641e-5 ÷ 6895e-4 = (9641/6895)* (1e-5/1e-4) )= (1.397) * (0.1) )= 0.1397.

Wait, that can't be right because 6895 * 1.4 = 9653, which is a bit higher than 9641. So 9641/6895 is about 1.4 *0.999 ≈1.3986.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 9641 ÷ 6895.

Hmm, 6895 *1.4 = 9643. So 6895 *1.4 = 9643, which is 2 more than 9641. So 1.4 - (2/6895) ≈ 1.4 - 0.00029 ≈1.3997.

So 9641/6895 ≈1.3997.

So (9641e-5) / (6895e-4) )= (9641/6895) * 10^(-5-(-4)) )= (1.3997) *10^(-1) = 0.13997 ≈0.140.

So Kp≈0.140.

So the degree of dissociation α is approximately 0.184, and Kp is approximately 0.14.

Looking at the options:

Option F: α=0.1846; Kp=0.141.

That's very close to what I calculated.

Another option is E: alpha 0.2, Kp 0.15. But my values are closer to F.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the step where I computed the moles of N₂O4 as 1.588g /92g/mol. Let me calculate that accurately.

1.588 /92: 92*0.017 is 1.564, as before. 1.588-1.564=0.024. 0.024/92 is 0.0002609. So total is 0.0172609 mol. Correct.

Then, the total pressure is 1 atm, V=0.5 L, T=298 K.

n_total=PV/(RT)= (1)(0.5)/(0.0821*298)=0.5/(24.4658)= approx 0.02044 mol. Then, 0.01726 (1+α)=0.02044 → 1+α=1.184 →α=0.184. Correct.

Then, moles N₂O4 at equilibrium: 0.01726*(1-0.184)=0.01726*0.816≈0.01407 mol.

Moles NO2: 2*0.01726*0.184≈0.00636 mol. So total moles: 0.01407+0.00636=0.02043 mol. Correct.

Mole fractions:

N₂O4: 0.01407/0.02043≈0.688.

NO₂: 0.00636/0.02043≈0.311.

Partial pressures:

0.688 atm and 0.311 atm.

Kp=(0.311)^2 /0.688.

Compute 0.311^2: 0.096721.

0.096721 /0.688 ≈0.1406.

Ah, so Kp≈0.1406. So option F says Kp=0.141, which matches.

So the correct answer must be option F: α=0.1846; Kp=0.141.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the initial moles of nitrogen tetroxide (N₂O₄). The molar mass of N₂O₄ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of } N_2O_4 = (2 \times 14) + (4 \times 16) = 92 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The mass of N₂O₄ given is 1.588 g, so the moles are:

\[
n = \frac{1.588}{92} \approx 0.01726 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of the vessel is 500 cm³, which is 0.5 L. The initial concentration of N₂O₄ is:

\[
C = \frac{n}{V} = \frac{0.01726}{0.5} = 0.03452 \, \text{M}.
\]

The dissociation reaction is:

\[
N_2O_4 \rightarrow 2NO_2.
\]

Let the degree of dissociation be \( \alpha \). At equilibrium:
- The concentration of N₂O₄ is \( C - \alpha C = C(1 - \alpha) \),
- The concentration of NO₂ is \( 2\alpha C \).

The total moles of gas at equilibrium can be calculated using the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = n_{\text{total}}RT.
\]

Given \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \), \( V = 0.5 \, \text{L} \), \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), and \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \):

\[
n_{\text{total}} = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(1)(0.5)}{(0.0821)(298)} \approx 0.02044 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total moles at equilibrium are also related to the initial moles and the degree of dissociation:

\[
n_{\text{total}} = n(1 + \alpha).
\]

Substituting \( n = 0.01726 \) and \( n_{\text{total}} = 0.02044 \):

\[
0.01726(1 + \alpha) = 0.02044.
\]

Solving for \( \alpha \):

\[
1 + \alpha = \frac{0.02044}{0.01726} \approx 1.184, \quad \alpha \approx 0.184.
\]

Next, we calculate the partial pressures of N₂O₄ and NO₂. The mole fractions are:

\[
\text{Mole fraction of } N_2O_4 = \frac{n(1 - \alpha)}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.01726(1 - 0.184)}{0.02044} \approx 0.6895,
\]
\[
\text{Mole fraction of } NO_2 = \frac{2n\alpha}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{2(0.01726)(0.184)}{0.02044} \approx 0.3105.
\]

The partial pressures are:

\[
P_{N_2O_4} = (\text{Mole fraction of } N_2O_4) \times P_{\text{total}} = 0.6895 \times 1 \, \text{atm} \approx 0.6895 \, \text
