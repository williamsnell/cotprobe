Question:

What evidence is there that there are specialized sound detectorsfor human speech ?

Options:

A: Auditory complex neurons primarily respond to tactile stimulation instead of auditory signals.
B: Only a small minority of neurons in the auditory complex are dedicated to processing speech sounds.
C: 40% of the neurons in the auditory complex do not even respond to pure tones, but only to more complex sounds such as bursts of noise or clicks.
D: Neurons in the auditory complex are equally responsive to all sound frequencies.
E: Neurons in the auditory complex respond to changes in light intensity.
F: Neurons in the auditory complex have been found to respond exclusively to musical tones, not speech.
G: Auditory complex neurons show a heightened response to visual motion cues rather than sounds.
H: All neurons in the auditory complex respond only to pure tones.
I: Neurons in the auditory complex respond to simple, uniform sounds.
J: The majority of neurons in the auditory complex are specialized for detecting water sounds.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about evidence for specialized sound detectors for human speech. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking what evidence exists that there are specialized detectors in the auditory system for speech. So, I'm thinking about what I remember from my psychology classes about how we process speech sounds. I recall that the auditory system is specialized in some way for speech, but the exact details are a bit fuzzy.

Looking at the options:

Option A says auditory complex neurons respond primarily to tactile stimulation. That doesn't make sense because the auditory complex is for hearing, right? So this is probably wrong.

Option B claims only a small minority of neurons are dedicated to speech. I'm not sure, but I thought a larger portion might be involved since speech is so important for humans.

Option C states that 40% don't respond to pure tones but to more complex sounds like noise bursts or clicks. That rings a bell. I think the auditory system has neurons that respond better to complex sounds rather than simple tones. Since speech is made up of complex sounds, this would support specialized detectors.

Option D says neurons are equally responsive to all frequencies. That doesn't sound right because the auditory system is known to have varying sensitivity across frequencies, which is why we can distinguish different sounds.

Option E is about responding to light, which is unrelated to the auditory system. Definitely wrong.

Option F is about musical tones, not speech. I don't think that's correct because the question is about speech, not music.

Option G mentions visual motion, which again is unrelated to hearing. So wrong.

Option H says all neurons respond only to pure tones. That can't be right because the auditory system handles a variety of sounds, including speech which is complex.

Option I says neurons respond to simple sounds. But I thought some neurons need more complex stimuli, like formants in speech sounds. So maybe this is incorrect.

Option J talks about water sounds, which doesn't relate to speech. So not the answer.

So, narrowing it down, the correct answer is probably option C. Because if 40% of neurons don't respond to pure tones but to more complex sounds, that suggests they're specialized for things like speech, which are complex. Pure tones are simple and don't carry the same information as speech sounds, which include various frequencies and changes.

Wait, but I also remember something about how some neurons are tuned to specific phonetic sounds. For example, certain neurons might fire in response to the sound /ba/ or /da/. But that's more specific than just complex sounds. However, the option that's closest to this idea is C, which mentions responding to complex sounds like bursts or clicks, which are part of speech.

So I think the answer is C.

The evidence that there are specialized sound detectors for human speech can be found in the fact that many neurons in the auditory complex respond preferentially to complex sounds rather than simple pure tones. This is crucial because speech is composed of complex auditory elements, such as consonant-vowel transitions, which are more intricate than pure tones. Option C highlights that 40% of neurons in the auditory complex do not respond to pure tones but instead react to more complex sounds like bursts of noise or clicks, which are integral to speech perception. This specialization suggests an evolutionary adaptation for processing speech, a critical function for human communication.

Answer: C
