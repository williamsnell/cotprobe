Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about philosophy. The question is asking which philosopher called the idea of natural rights 'nonsense on stilts'. The options are A through J, each listing a different philosopher.

First, I need to recall what I know about natural rights and the philosophers associated with them. I remember that natural rights are a concept often linked to Enlightenment thinkers, particularly John Locke. Locke argued that individuals have inherent rights to life, liberty, and property, which governments are supposed to protect. So, he's definitely a proponent of natural rights, not someone who would criticize them.

Then there's Jeremy Bentham. I think he was a utilitarian. Utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of actions, emphasizing the greatest good for the greatest number. Bentham was critical of the idea of natural rights. I remember reading somewhere that Bentham dismissed the concept as nonsensical. The phrase 'nonsense on stilts' sounds familiar in that context. It's a pretty strong way to describe an idea, so it's likely someone who opposed the idea of inherent rights.

Looking at the options, Jeremy Bentham is option H. Let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Immanuel Kant (option C) was more about deontological ethics, focusing on duties and rules rather than rights in that specific way. Thomas Hobbes (F) believed in a social contract but thought that without government, life would be 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short'—more about the need for authority than rights.

Other options like Socrates, Descartes, or Nietzsche don't seem to fit. Alan Gewirth (G) might have had something to say on rights, but I don't recall him using that specific phrase. So, putting it all together, Jeremy Bentham is the one who called natural rights 'nonsense on stilts'.
