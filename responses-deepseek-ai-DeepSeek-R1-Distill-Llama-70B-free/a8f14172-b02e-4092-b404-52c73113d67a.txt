Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about what's not a rewarding aspect of being a grandparent. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is asking which option is NOT one of the most rewarding things for grandparents. The options are A through J. I need to think about what grandparents typically enjoy and see which one doesn't fit.

Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Sharing wisdom and life experiences. I've heard grandparents love giving advice and telling stories. That sounds rewarding, so this is probably a correct aspect and not the answer.

B: Having a second chance at parenting. Oh yeah, grandparents often say they can do things differently now, maybe be more patient or involved. So this seems like a pro, not the answer.

C: Watching grandchildren grow and develop. Definitely a big one. Seeing them learn and change must be very fulfilling. So this is a correct aspect, not the answer.

D: Having others to wait on you. Hmm, wait. I'm not sure. Do grandparents feel rewarded by being waited on? Or is it the other way around? I think grandparents are usually the ones helping, not being waited on. This might be the incorrect one.

E: Reliving their own childhood through their grandchildren. Yeah, I've heard this a lot. They get to experience the joy again through their grandkids. So this is a correct aspect.

F: Having an excuse to indulge in childish activities. Like playing games, toys, maybe even stuff they didn't do as kids. Sounds fun, so this is a correct point.

G: Spoiling the grandchildren. Oh definitely, grandparents often spoil their grandkids, maybe with treats or leniency. So this is a common rewarding aspect.

H: Feelings of immortality. I think this refers to how having grandchildren makes them feel they leave a legacy, so it's a positive feeling. So correct aspect.

I: Being able to spend quality time with family. That's a big one. Quality time is rewarding, so this is correct.

J: Remembering when they were grandchildren. Wait, grandparents would remember their own grandparents, I guess. So this might be a positive, nostalgic feeling. So this is a correct aspect.

So looking back, the question is which is NOT rewarding. D says having others wait on you. Grandparents are more likely to take care of others than be taken care of. So D seems like the odd one out. The other options all fit with common things grandparents enjoy.

The correct answer is:

D: Having others to wait on you

This is because grandparents typically find reward in giving, sharing, and nurturing their grandchildren, rather than being waited on themselves.

Answer: D
