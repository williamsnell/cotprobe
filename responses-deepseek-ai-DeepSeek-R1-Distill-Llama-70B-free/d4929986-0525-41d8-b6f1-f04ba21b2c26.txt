Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about microaggressions and what Lukianoff and Haidt say about them. Hmm, I remember that Lukianoff and Haidt have written about this topic, maybe in their book or articles. Let me think.

The question is asking what the recent trend to uncover microaggressions encourages, according to them. The options are A through D. I think I've heard that they're critical of the microaggression trend. They probably argue that it has negative effects, maybe on free speech or mental health.

Option A says it encourages students to confabulate reasons. Confabulate means to make up or fabricate. So, are they saying students make up microaggressions? I'm not sure. I think they might argue that the focus on microaggressions leads to people interpreting things as offensive even when they're not, which could involve fabricating reasons why something is offensive.

Option B is about pursuing justice by marking out racism, etc. That sounds positive, but I don't think Lukianoff and Haidt are in favor of this trend. They're more about the downsides, so B might not be the right choice.

Option C says it leads to labeling by assigning global negative traits to people. Oh, right! I remember something about this. They talk about how when someone is accused of a microaggression, it's often treated as evidence of a deep-seated prejudice, which can lead to stereotyping or labeling people as racist or sexist without considering the full context. So this might be the correct answer.

Option D mentions universities having legal obligations. I'm not too sure about this. I think they discuss the administrative burden, but the question is about what the trend encourages, not necessarily the legal aspects. So D might not be the main point they're making here.

Wait, going back. Lukianoff and Haidt's main points include that the focus on microaggressions can create a culture of offense and sensitivity, which might lead to people being labeled too quickly. So option C fits because assigning global negative traits is about labeling someone based on a single action or word, assuming they're entirely racist, sexist, etc.

So I'm leaning towards option C being the correct answer. It's about the labeling aspect, which I think they critique as harmful because it oversimplifies people's behaviors and intentions.

The correct answer is C. Lukianoff and Haidt argue that the trend of uncovering microaggressions leads to labeling individuals with global negative traits, oversimplifying their behaviors and intentions without considering context.

Answer: C
