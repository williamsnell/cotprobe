Okay, so I've got this economics question about the kinked demand curve, and I'm trying to figure it out. I remember that the kinked demand curve is a model used in oligopoly markets. Oligopoly is where there are a few firms, so their actions can affect each other.

The question is asking which statement is NOT correct regarding the kinked demand curve. The options are A through D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says there's no price leader. Hmm, I think in the kinked demand model, there isn't a single price leader. Instead, each firm reacts to the others' prices. So if one firm lowers their price, others might follow to maintain their market share. But if a firm raises its price, others probably won't follow because they'd gain more customers. So A seems correct, which means it's not the answer we're looking for since the question is about what's NOT correct.

Option B states there are relatively equal shares of the market. That makes sense because in oligopoly, especially with a kinked demand curve, firms are interdependent and might have similar market shares, so B is correct. So not the answer either.

Option C says price is greater than marginal costs. I remember that in oligopolies, firms might price above marginal cost because of their market power, so C is correct. So again, not the answer.

Option D claims the demand curve is of one continuous function. Wait, the kinked demand curve isn't smooth. It has a kink, right? The demand curve is actually two separate segments joined at a kink. So it's not a single continuous function. That makes D incorrect. So the correct answer is D because the statement is wrong about the demand curve being continuous.

The kinked demand curve model describes oligopoly markets where firms are interdependent. It is characterized by a non-continuous demand curve with a "kink" due to differing elasticities of demand. 

- **Option A**: Correct. There is no single price leader; firms adjust prices based on competitors' actions.
- **Option B**: Correct. Firms often have relatively equal market shares due to interdependence.
- **Option C**: Correct. Price typically exceeds marginal cost due to market power.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The demand curve is not a single continuous function; it has a kink.

The statement that is NOT correct is **D**. 

Answer: D
