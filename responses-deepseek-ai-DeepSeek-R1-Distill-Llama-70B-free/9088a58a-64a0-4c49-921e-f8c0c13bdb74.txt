Okay, so I have this question about the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. Hmm, I remember that when it comes to genetics and family relations, the amount of shared genes can be a bit tricky. Let me try to break this down.

First, I think about how genes are passed down through generations. Parents pass half their genes to each child, right? So, for example, a parent has two copies of a gene (one from each of their parents), and they give one to their child. So each child gets 50% of their genes from each parent.

Now, first cousins are the children of siblings. So, each of your first cousins has a parent who is your aunt or uncle. Let me visualize this. Let's say you have an aunt who is your father's sister. She has children, and those are your first cousins.

Each of your parents gives you 50% of their genes. So your father gives you half his genes, and your mother gives you the other half. Now, your aunt (your father's sister) also got half of her genes from your grandfather and half from your grandmother, just like your father did. But which half?

Wait, because siblings don't share exactly the same genes. They each get a random 50% from each parent. So on average, how much do they share? I think I remember that full siblings share about 50% of their genes. So your father and his sister (your aunt) each have a 50% chance of sharing any given gene from their parents.

So when your aunt has a child (your first cousin), that child gets 50% of their genes from your aunt. But your aunt only shares 50% of her genes with your father. So the genes that you and your cousin share would come from the shared genes between your father and aunt.

Let me put this into numbers. Let's say your father has a certain gene. He has a 50% chance of passing it to you. Your aunt also has a 50% chance of passing that same gene to her child (your cousin). So the chance that both you and your cousin have that gene is 0.5 (from your father to you) multiplied by 0.5 (from your aunt to your cousin), which is 0.25, or 25%. But wait, that's just for one gene. But across all genes, on average, how much do first cousins share?

Alternatively, I think another approach is to consider that each generation, the genetic contribution is halved. So, for first cousins, you go back two generations. Let me think: you and your cousin share a set of grandparents. Each of you gets 50% of your genes from each of your parents, but each parent gets 50% from their own parent (your grandparent). So the path is: you get 50% from your parent, who got 50% from the grandparent. So that's 25% from each grandparent. But since you and your cousin both get 25% from each of the same grandparents, how does that overlap?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the proportion of genes you share. For each gene in the grandparent, there's a chance it's passed to you and to your cousin.

Let me think in steps. Each grandparent has two copies of a gene. They pass one to each of their children (your parent and your aunt/uncle). So, each of your parents has a 50% chance of getting any particular gene from the grandparent. Then, each of your parents passes on 50% of their genes to you. Similarly, your aunt or uncle passes 50% of their genes to your cousin.

So, the chance that a particular gene from the grandparent is passed to you is 0.5 (from grandparent to your parent) * 0.5 (from your parent to you) = 0.25. Similarly, the chance it's passed to your cousin is 0.5 (from grandparent to your aunt/uncle) * 0.5 (from aunt to cousin) = 0.25. 

But the probability that both you and your cousin have that gene is 0.25 (you) * 0.25 (cousin) = 0.0625, which is 6.25%. But wait, that's for each gene. Since each gene is independent, on average, you'd share about 12.5% of your genes. Wait, why 12.5%? Because you have two grandparents contributing, right? Or maybe not, because each gene comes from a specific path.

Wait no, I think I might be confusing this. Let me try another approach. The coefficient of relatedness for first cousins is 1/8, which is 12.5%. But wait, the question is asking about the proportion of genes shared on average.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think in terms of the number of shared genes. Suppose each person has, say, 20,000 genes (just as an example). 

Your parent has 50% of their genes from each of your grandparents. So for each gene, you have a 50% chance of having the one from grandpa, say. Similarly, your cousin's parent (your aunt) also has a 50% chance of giving a gene from grandpa. So for any particular gene in grandpa, the chance that both you and your cousin have it is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. But wait, that would mean on average, 25% of the genes from each grandparent are shared. But each person gets 25% of their genes from each grandparent (since 50% from each parent, who each got 50% from the grandparent), so the shared genes would be 25% of the total, which is 12.5%? Because each grandparent contributes 25%, and for each, 25% of that is shared.

Wait, perhaps another way: the expected proportion of genes shared between first cousins is 12.5%, which is 1/8. Because first cousins share, on average, one-eighth of their genes. So the proportion would be 1/8.

Looking back at the options, option G is 1/8. So the correct answer would be G.

The proportion of genes shared by first cousins can be determined by analyzing the genetic inheritance pathways. Each individual inherits 50% of their genes from each parent, and each parent, in turn, inherits 50% of their genes from each grandparent. 

For first cousins, the shared genes come from the common grandparents. The probability that a specific gene from a grandparent is passed to one cousin is \(0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25\). Similarly, the probability that the same gene is passed to the other cousin is also \(0.25\). The probability that both cousins share the same gene is therefore \(0.25 \times 0.25 = 0.0625\), or 6.25%, for each gene from one grandparent. Since there are two shared grandparents, the total proportion of shared genes is \(2 \times 0.0625 = 0.125\), or 12.5%.

This corresponds to a proportion of \( \frac{1}{8} \), as \( \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

G: \( \frac{1}{8} \).

Answer: G
