Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because variances can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Alright, the problem has several parts, but I'm focusing on the first four questions. Let's break it down.

First, the standard costs are given. Materials are $2 per pound, and each unit requires 10 pounds. So the standard material cost per unit is 10 * $2 = $20. Labor is $3 per hour, and each unit takes 5 hours, so labor cost per unit is 5 * $3 = $15. Overhead is $1.20 per hour, so for 5 hours, that's 5 * $1.20 = $6. Adding those up, the standard cost per unit is $20 + $15 + $6 = $41. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, last month they made 1,000 units and sold 800. The actual costs incurred were a bit different. Let's jot those down:

- Materials: 10,500 lbs purchased and used, costing $21,525.
- Labor: 5,100 hours worked, costing $15,402.
- Overhead: $6,400.

The questions are about variances. So I need to calculate the materials price variance, materials quantity variance, labor rate variance, labor efficiency variance, and the overhead variance.

Starting with part 1: What is a standard cost? How is it used? I remember that standard cost is a predetermined cost that should be incurred under normal conditions. It's used for budgeting, cost control, and performance evaluation. Companies set these standards and then compare actual costs to them to find variances, which help in identifying where they're over or under performing.

But since the question is multiple-choice, maybe I don't need to write that out, but just make sure I understand it for context.

Moving to part 2: The two materials variances. These are the price variance and the quantity variance.

The formula for materials price variance is (Actual Price - Standard Price) * Actual Quantity Purchased. But wait, I think it's the quantity used, not purchased, since the problem says materials were purchased and used. So I should use the quantity used.

The standard price is $2 per lb. Actual price can be found by dividing total materials cost by quantity used. Total materials cost is $21,525, and quantity used is 10,500 lbs. So actual price per lb is 21525 / 10500. Let me calculate that: 21525 รท 10500 is $2.05 per lb.

So, materials price variance = (2.05 - 2.00) * 10,500 lbs. That's 0.05 * 10500 = $525. Now, since the actual price is higher than the standard, this variance is unfavorable.

Wait, but wait, another formula I remember is (Actual - Standard) * Actual Quantity. So if actual is higher, it's unfavorable. So yes, $525 unfavorable. So that's the materials price variance.

Next, the materials quantity variance. The formula is (Actual Quantity Used - Standard Quantity Allowed) * Standard Price. 

They produced 1,000 units, each requiring 10 lbs, so standard quantity allowed is 1,000 *10 = 10,000 lbs. Actual used was 10,500 lbs.

So, variance is (10,500 - 10,000) * $2 = 500 * 2 = $1,000. Now, whether it's favorable or unfavorable depends on whether they used more or less. Using more materials (since actual is higher) would mean more cost, so it's unfavorable. So materials quantity variance is $1,000 unfavorable.

Wait, but wait. The formula is (Actual - Standard) * Standard Price. Positive means unfavorable. So yes, that's right.

So for materials, the two variances are $525 unfavorable (price) and $1,000 unfavorable (quantity).

Now part 3: Labor variances. There's the rate variance and the efficiency variance.

Labor rate variance is (Actual Rate - Standard Rate) * Actual Hours Worked. 

Standard rate is $3 per hour. Actual rate is total labor cost divided by actual hours. Total labor cost is $15,402, and actual hours are 5,100. So actual rate is 15402 / 5100. Let me compute that: 15402 รท 5100. Let me see, 5100 * 3 = 15300, so 15402-15300=102. So 102/5100 = 0.02. So actual rate is $3.02 per hour.

So variance is (3.02 - 3.00) * 5100 hours. That's 0.02 *5100 = $102. Since actual rate is higher than standard, this is unfavorable.

Next, labor efficiency variance. Formula is (Actual Hours - Standard Hours) * Standard Rate. 

Standard hours for 1,000 units is 1,000 *5 =5,000 hours. Actual hours were 5,100. So variance is (5,100 -5,000)*3 = 100 *3 = $300. Since they used more hours, this is unfavorable.

Wait wait, but wait. If they used more hours than standard, that's inefficient, so the variance is unfavorable. So labor efficiency variance is $300 unfavorable.

Wait, but some sources might calculate it as Standard Hours - Actual Hours, but then the variance's sign changes. Let me double-check. Oh no, the formula is (Actual - Standard) * Standard Rate. So positive variance is unfavorable. So yes, $300 unfavorable.

So labor variances: rate variance $102 unfavorable, efficiency variance $300 unfavorable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because in labor variances, the efficiency variance is also influenced by the quantity produced. So if they produced more units, maybe that's why more hours were used. Wait, in this case, they produced 1,000 units, which would require 5,000 hours at standard. They used 5,100, so 100 extra hours. So yes, that's 100*3=300 unfavorable.

So that part seems correct.

Now part 4: Overhead variance. I think overhead variance is calculated based on the actual overhead cost and the standard overhead cost applied.

But wait, the problem gives actual overhead cost as $6,400. The standard overhead rate is $1.20 per hour. They worked 5,100 hours. So standard overhead cost for those hours is 5,100 * $1.20 = let's calculate that. 5,000 *1.20=6,000, and 100 *1.20=120, so total 6,120.

So the overhead variance is Actual - Standard. So 6,400 -6,120 = $280. But wait, wait, I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the standard is based on the units produced. Let me think.

Wait, standard overhead is usually applied based on standard hours allowed for production. So for 1,000 units, standard hours would be 5,000. So standard overhead is 5,000 *1.20 = $6,000. 

But actual overhead was $6,400, and actual hours were 5,100. So perhaps another way is to compute the overhead variance as the difference between actual and standard for the hours worked. Alternatively, sometimes it's computed as the difference between actual overhead and (standard rate * actual hours). 

Wait, the overhead variance is often considered as the difference between actual overhead and the amount that should have been applied based on actual hours. So let's clarify.

Standard overhead rate is $1.20 per hour. Actual hours were 5,100. So applied overhead would be 5,100 *1.20 =6,120. But actual overhead was 6,400. So the variance is 6,400 -6,120= $280. But wait, that's only $280. But wait, maybe the overhead is also compared to the standard based on units produced.

Alternatively, another approach: sometimes, overhead variance includes both the spending variance and the volume variance. But the question is asking just for the overhead variance, which I think refers to the total variance, not splitting into spending and volume.

Wait, but in the problem, it's possible that the overhead variance is simply actual overhead minus the standard overhead based on units produced. So standard overhead for 1,000 units is 1,000 units *5 hours/unit * $1.20/hour = 5,000 *1.20= $6,000. Actual overhead was $6,400, so variance is 6,400 -6,000 = $400 unfavorable.

Hmm, so I'm a bit confused here. Which is the correct approach? Because sometimes overhead variance is computed as actual - (standard rate * actual hours), but in other cases, it's based on the standard for the units produced.

Wait, let me check the possible options. Let's see the options given.

Looking at the options, the overhead variance in the choices is either $400 or $350, etc. For example, option A says Overhead Variance $400 unfavorable. Option E also has $400 unfavorable. Option B has $400 favorable. Hmmm.

Wait, let me think again. The standard cost per unit includes overhead of $6. So for 1,000 units, standard overhead is 1,000 * $6 = $6,000. Actual overhead is $6,400. So the variance is $6,400 - $6,000= $400, which is unfavorable because actual is higher than standard.

So that would make the overhead variance $400 unfavorable.

Wait, but wait, another approach: sometimes, the overhead variance is calculated as (Actual Overhead) minus (Applied Overhead). Applied overhead is standard rate multiplied by actual hours. So applied overhead is 5,100 *1.20=6,120. So actual overhead is 6,400. So variance is 6,400 -6,120= $280. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the way the problem is expecting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the overhead variance is based on the difference from the standard for the units produced, not the hours used. So that would be 1,000 units * $6 = $6,000. Actual is $6,400, so variance is $400 unfavorable. That's matching option A and E.

So I think that's the way the problem is set up. So overhead variance is $400 unfavorable.

Now, let's go back to the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Materials Price Variance $525 (favorable), Material Quantity Variance $1000 (unfavorable), Labor rate variance $102 (unfavorable), Labor Efficiency Variance $300 (favorable), Overhead Variance $400 (unfavorable).

Wait, no, in our calculations, materials price variance is $525 unfavorable, not favorable.

So option A's materials price variance is favorable, which is wrong. So A is out.

Option B: Materials Price Variance $500 (unfavorable), Quantity $1000 (favorable), which is wrong because materials quantity should be unfavorable.

Option C: Materials Price Variance $525 (unfavorable), Quantity $950 (favorable). Wait, our quantity was $1000 unfavorable, so C is wrong.

Option D: Materials Price $600 (unfavorable), which is higher than our calculation, so no.

Option E: Materials Price Variance $525 (unfavorable), Quantity $1000 (unfavorable). Labor rate $102 (unfavorable), Efficiency $300 (unfavorable). Overhead $400 (unfavorable). That matches all our calculations except for the labor efficiency.

Wait, in our calculation, labor efficiency variance was $300 unfavorable, which matches E. So E's labor variances are both unfavorable. Let me check:

E's 2 labor variances: rate $102 unfavorable, efficiency $300 unfavorable. Yes.

So E seems to match all our calculations.

Wait, but let's double-check all the parts:

1. Materials Price Variance: $525 unfavorable (E has this)
2. Materials Quantity Variance: $1000 unfavorable (E has this)
3. Labor Rate Variance: $102 unfavorable (E has this)
4. Labor Efficiency Variance: $300 unfavorable (E has this)
5. Overhead Variance: $400 unfavorable (E has this)

Yes, so E is the correct option.

Wait, but let me check the other options to be sure.

Option J: Has Materials Price Variance $500 (unfavorable), which is less than our $525. So no.

Option I: Materials Price $500 favorable, which is wrong.

Option H: Price $550, which is higher.

So yes, E is the correct one.

The problem involves calculating variances for materials, labor, and overhead. Here's the analysis:

### Materials Variances:
1. **Materials Price Variance**:  
   Formula: \((\text{Actual Price} - \text{Standard Price}) \times \text{Actual Quantity}\)  
   Actual price = \(\frac{\$21,525}{10,500 \text{ lbs}} = \$2.05\) per lb.  
   Variance = \((2.05 - 2.00) \times 10,500 = \$525\) (unfavorable, as actual price > standard price).

2. **Materials Quantity Variance**:  
   Formula: \((\text{Actual Quantity} - \text{Standard Quantity}) \times \text{Standard Price}\)  
   Standard quantity = \(1,000 \text{ units} \times 10 \text{ lbs/unit} = 10,000 \text{ lbs}\).  
   Variance = \((10,500 - 10,000) \times \$2 = \$1,000\) (unfavorable, as actual quantity > standard quantity).

### Labor Variances:
1. **Labor Rate Variance**:  
   Formula: \((\text{Actual Rate} - \text{Standard Rate}) \times \text{Actual Hours}\)  
   Actual rate = \(\frac{\$15,402}{5,100 \text{ hours}} = \$3.02\) per hour.  
   Variance = \((3.02 - 3.00) \times 5,100 = \$102\) (unfavorable, as actual rate > standard rate).

2. **Labor Efficiency Variance**:  
   Formula: \((\text{Actual Hours} - \text{Standard Hours}) \times \text{Standard Rate}\)  
   Standard hours = \(1,000 \text{ units} \times 5 \text{ hours/unit} = 5,000 \text{ hours}\).  
   Variance = \((5,100 - 5,000) \times \$3 = \$300\) (unfavorable, as actual hours > standard hours).

### Overhead Variance:
Formula: \(\text{Actual Overhead} - (\text{Standard Rate} \times \text{Standard Hours})\)  
Standard overhead = \(1,000 \text{ units} \times 5 \text{ hours/unit} \times \$1.20/\text{hour} = \$6,000\).  
Actual overhead = \$6,400.  
Variance = \$6,400 - \$6,000 = \$400 (unfavorable, as actual overhead > standard overhead).

### Matching with Options:
- **Materials Price Variance**: \$525 (unfavorable).  
- **Materials Quantity Variance**: \$1,000 (unfavorable).  
- **Labor Rate Variance**: \$102 (unfavorable).  
- **Labor Efficiency Variance**: \$300 (unfavorable).  
- **Overhead Variance**: \$400 (unfavorable).  

These match **Option E**.
