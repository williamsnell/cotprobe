Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: The drive shaft of an automobile rotates at 3600 revolutions per minute and transmits 80 horsepower from the engine to the rear wheels. I need to compute the torque developed by the engine. The options are from A to J, with various lb·ft values.

Hmm, I remember that torque is related to horsepower and rotational speed. Oh right, there's a formula that connects these three variables. I think it's something like torque equals horsepower multiplied by some constant, then divided by the rotational speed. Wait, what's the exact formula again?

I think the formula is: Torque (in lb·ft) = (Horsepower × 5252) / RPM. Or wait, maybe it's 550? No, I think 550 is for watts or something else. Let me get this straight. Oh yeah, 1 horsepower is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second. So when we're dealing with torque, which is in lb·ft, we need to convert the rotational speed into the correct units.

Wait, RPM is revolutions per minute. So to get the right units, I probably need to convert that into a per second basis. Or does the formula account for that already?

Let me think. The formula I remember is Torque (lb·ft) = (Horsepower × 5252) / RPM. Oh wait, because 5252 is the conversion factor that includes seconds. Let me verify that.

So 1 horsepower is 550 ft·lb/s. So if the engine is producing P horsepower, then the power in ft·lb/s is P*550. Power is also equal to torque multiplied by angular velocity. Angular velocity in radians per second is 2π times RPM divided by 60 to convert to per second. So the formula would be Power = Torque * 2π * RPM / 60.

Wait, let me write that out: P (hp) = (Torque (lb·ft)) * (2π * RPM / 60) ) / 550, because 1 hp is 550 lb·ft/s.

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to derive the formula properly.

Power (P) in horsepower is related to torque (τ) in lb·ft and angular velocity (ω) in revolutions per minute (RPM) by the equation:

P = (τ * ω) / 5252

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Power in general is torque multiplied by angular velocity, but the units need to match.

So, torque is in lb·ft, angular velocity in RPM. Let's convert RPM to rad/s because standard units for torque (in N·m) and angular velocity (rad/s) give power in watts. But since we're dealing with lb·ft and horsepower, perhaps there's a direct conversion.

Wait, let me approach it differently. One horsepower is 550 ft·lb/s. So if the power is 80 hp, that's 80 * 550 = 44,000 ft·lb/s.

The rotational speed is 3600 RPM. To find torque, I can use the formula:

Torque (τ) = Power / Angular Velocity (in rad/s)

Wait, but power is also τ * ω, where ω is in rad/s. So yes, τ = P / ω.

But here, P is in ft·lb/s, and ω needs to be in rad/s.

So, let's compute ω. 3600 RPM is 3600 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2π radians, so 3600 rev/min = 3600 * 2π rad/min. To convert to rad/s, divide by 60: (3600 * 2π) / 60 = (60 * 2π) rad/s = 120π rad/s.

Wait 3600 divided by 60 is 60. So 60 * 2π = 120π rad/s.

So ω is 120π rad/s.

Now, P is 80 hp, which is 80 * 550 = 44,000 ft·lb/s.

So torque τ = P / ω = 44,000 / (120π).

Let me compute that. 44,000 divided by 120 is 366.666... So 366.666 divided by π.

π is approximately 3.1416, so 366.666 / 3.1416 ≈ 116.7 lb·ft.

Looking at the options, I see option H is 117 lb·ft, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Let me double-check the steps.

First, 80 hp = 80 * 550 = 44,000 ft·lb/s. Correct.

RPM to rad/s: 3600 RPM = 3600 * 2π rad/min = 3600 * 2π /60 rad/s = 60 * 2π rad/s = 120π rad/s. Correct.

Torque τ = 44,000 / (120π) = 44,000/(376.99..) ≈ 116.7 lb·ft.

So 116.7 is approximately 117, so the answer would be H.

But wait, the options have H as 117 lb·ft, which matches. So that's the correct choice.

Alternatively, I remember a formula that torque in lb·ft is equal to (horsepower × 5252) / RPM.

Let me try that. 80 * 5252 = 420,160. Divided by 3600 gives 420160 / 3600.

Compute 420160 / 3600: 420160 / 3600 = 116.711... So approximately 116.71 lb·ft, which again is about 117. So same result.

So the correct answer would be option H, 117 lb·ft.
</think>

To compute the torque developed by the engine, we use the relationship between power, torque, and angular velocity. The formula to calculate torque in lb·ft is:

\[
\tau = \frac{P \cdot 5252}{\text{RPM}}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the power in horsepower (80 hp in this case),
- RPM is the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (3600 RPM),
- 5252 is a conversion factor that accounts for unit consistency.

Substituting the values:

\[
\tau = \frac{80 \cdot 5252}{3600}
\]

First, calculate \( 80 \cdot 5252 = 420,160 \). Then divide by 3600:

\[
\tau = \frac{420,160}{3600} \approx 116.71 \, \text{lb·ft}
\]

This value rounds to approximately 117 lb·ft. Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is **H: 117 lb·ft**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H**
