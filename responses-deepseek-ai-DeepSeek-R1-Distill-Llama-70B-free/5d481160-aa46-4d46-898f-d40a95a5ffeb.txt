Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating a homeowner's insurance premium. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says the premium rate is $0.96 per $100. Hmm, so that means for every $100 of the home's value, the insurance costs 96 cents. The home in question is $27,000. So first, I think I need to calculate the base premium before any discounts.

Wait, how do I do that? Oh right, I multiply the rate by the value, but since it's per $100, I divide the total value by 100 first. So 27,000 divided by 100 is 270. Then multiply by the rate, which is 0.96. Let me write that down: 270 * 0.96. Let me calculate that.

270 * 0.96. Well, 270 * 1 is 270, so 270 minus 10% of 270 (which is 27) gives 243. So the base premium is $243.

But wait, the problem says there's a discount if the homeowner accepts a $250 deductible. The discount is 20% of the premium. So I need to apply a 20% discount on the $243.

How do I calculate 20% of 243? Well, 10% is 24.3, so 20% is double that, which is 48.6. So the discount is $48.6.

Subtracting that from the base premium: 243 - 48.6 equals 194.4. Wait, but wait—let me check that math again. 243 minus 48.6. 243 - 40 is 203, then minus 8.6 is 194.4. Yep, that's right.

But wait, looking at the options, none of them are $194.40. Let me check the options again. The options given are A:51.84, B:220, C:184.80, D:259.20, E:145.20, F:207, G:246.40, H:102, I:123.84, J:165.60.

Hmm, I don't see 194.40. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I miscalculated the base premium. Let's redo that part. So the rate is $0.96 per $100. For $27,000, that's 270 times 0.96. Let me compute that again.

270 * 0.96. Breaking it down: 200 * 0.96 is 192, 70 * 0.96 is 67.2. Adding them together: 192 + 67.2 = 259.2. Oh wait, that's different! I must have messed up earlier. So the base premium is actually $259.2, not 243. Where did I go wrong before?

Oh wait, because 270 * 0.96. Let me do it another way. 270 * 0.96 = (270 * 1) - (270 * 0.04). 270 * 0.04 is 10.8. So 270 - 10.8 is 259.2. Oh right, that makes more sense.

So the base premium is $259.20. Now applying a 20% discount on that. 20% of 259.2 is 0.2 * 259.2. Let's compute that: 259.2 * 0.2 is 51.84. So the discount is $51.84.

Wait, no, wait. 20% discount on the premium. So the discount is 20% of the base premium, which is 259.2. So 259.2 * 0.2 = 51.84. Therefore, the discounted premium is 259.2 - 51.84.

Let me subtract that: 259.2 minus 51.84. 259.2 - 50 is 209.2, then subtract 1.84 more, which gives 207.36. Hmm, but again, looking at the options, the closest I see is option F at $207. But wait, 207.36 isn't exactly 207. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the discount is applied differently. Let me recheck. The base premium is 0.96 per 100, so 270 * 0.96 = 259.20. Yes. Then 20% discount on that. 259.2 * 0.2 = 51.84. So 259.2 - 51.84 equals 207.36. But none of the options exactly match that. Let me look again at the options.

Options are:

A:51.84 → that's the discount amount, not the final premium.

B:220

C:184.80

D:259.20 → that's the base premium without discount.

E:145.20

F:207 → close to 207.36.

G:246.40

H:102

I:123.84

J:165.60

So the closest is option F: $207. But wait, my calculation gives 207.36, which isn't exactly 207.00. Hmm. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's compute 259.2 minus 51.84.

259.2 minus 51.84:

Start with 259.20

Subtract 50 → 209.20

Subtract 1.84 → 207.36.

But 207.36 is not an option. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, maybe the discount applies to the rate, not the premium? No, the question says a 20% discount on the premium. So the initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is applied before calculating the premium. Wait, no, the problem says the base rate is 0.96, then the discount is applied if you take the deductible.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is 0.96 per $100, so 270 * 0.96 = 259.2. Then 20% off, so 259.2 * 0.8 = 207.36. But again, 207.36 isn't an option. The closest option is F: 207.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to round to the nearest dollar, which would make it 207. So option F would be the answer.

Wait, but let's check the options again. Option F is 207, which is exactly what I have when I subtract 51.84 from 259.2. Wait, but 259.2 -51.84 is 207.36, which is 207.36. So perhaps the answer expects it to be 207.36, but since that's not an option, the closest is 207.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the base premium calculation. Let me try calculating 270 * 0.96 again. 270 * 0.96. Let me compute 270 * 96 cents.

Wait, 1% of 270 is 2.7. So 96% is 270 * 0.96.

Alternatively, compute 270 * 96 = ?

Wait, 270 * 96. Let's compute that.

270 * 96:

Compute 270 * 90 = 24,300

Compute 270 *6 = 1,620

Add them: 24,300 +1,620 = 25,920.

Now, since it's 270 * 0.96, we divide by 100: 259.20. So that's correct.

So the base is 259.20, discount of 20% is 51.84, so total premium is 207.36.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 207. So perhaps that's the intended answer, even though it's a slight approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the initial calculation steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 20% discount is applied to the rate, not the total premium. Let me see. If the rate is 0.96 per 100, applying a 20% discount on the rate would make the rate 0.96 * 0.8 = 0.768 per 100.

Then, the premium would be (27,000 / 100) * 0.768 = 270 * 0.768.

Let me compute that. 270 * 0.768.

Breaking it down: 200 * 0.768 = 153.6, 70 * 0.768 = 53.76. Adding them: 153.6 +53.76=207.36. Same result. So perhaps the discount is applied to the rate, which gives the same final premium as before. Either way, the result is 207.36, which again isn't an option but option F is 207.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 184.80, which is 207.36 minus something. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate 20% of 243. Wait, earlier I thought the base was 243, but that was a mistake. So no, that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rate and the discount is applied differently. Let me reread the question.

The premium rate is $.96 per $100. So that’s the base rate. Then, ABC allows a discount of 20% of the premium if the policy has a $250 deductible.

So the discount is 20% of the premium, which is the base rate multiplied by the value. So the steps are:

1. Calculate base premium: 270 * 0.96 = 259.20.

2. Apply 20% discount on 259.20: 259.20 * 0.8 = 207.36.

So the correct answer is 207.36, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the options are rounded, and the correct choice is F:207.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial base premium calculation. Let me check that again.

Wait, 27,000 divided by 100 is 270. 270 multiplied by 0.96. Let me compute this carefully:

0.96 * 270.

Compute 1 * 270 = 270.

But since it's 0.96, that's 4% less than 1. So 4% of 270 is 10.8.

So 270 -10.8 =259.2. Yes, that's correct.

So 20% of 259.2 is 51.84, so 259.2 -51.84 = 207.36.

Looking at the options, F is 207, which is the closest. So I think the answer is F: $207.

The premium rate for homeowners insurance is $0.96 per $100 of the home's value. For a home valued at $27,000, the base premium is calculated as follows:

1. Divide the home's value by 100:  
   \[
   \frac{27,000}{100} = 270
   \]

2. Multiply by the premium rate:  
   \[
   270 \times 0.96 = 259.20
   \]

Thus, the base premium is **$259.20**.

Next, a 20% discount is applied to the base premium because the homeowner accepts a $250 deductible clause. The discount is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 259.20 = 51.84
\]

Subtracting the discount from the base premium gives the final premium:  
\[
259.20 - 51.84 = 207.36
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value to $207.36 is **$207**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: $207**
