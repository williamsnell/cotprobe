Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The problem says, "All of Bella’s photos are in 8 photo books. Each photo book has 25 photos. Which expression shows how to find the total number of photos Bella has?" And then there are options from A to J.

Hmm, I think this is about multiplication or addition, maybe. Let me break it down.

So, Bella has 8 photo books, right? And each one has 25 photos. So, to find the total number of photos, I need to calculate how many photos are there when you have 8 sets of 25.

Wait, when you have multiple groups of the same number, that's when you use multiplication. Like, if you have 3 groups of 4 apples, you do 3×4 to get 12 apples. So in this case, each book is a group with 25 photos, and there are 8 such groups. So 8 multiplied by 25 should give the total.

Looking at the options, option A is 25 × 8. Oh, that's the same as 8×25, just swapped. Multiplication is commutative, so the order doesn't matter. So option A should be the correct one.

Let me check the other options just to be sure. Option B is 8 + 25. Adding them would give 33, which doesn't make sense because if each book has 25, 8 books would be way more than 33. So B is wrong.

Option C is 25 +25. That's 50. But that's only adding two books. Since there are 8, that's not right either.

Option D is 25×25, which is 625. That would be if she had 25 books each with 25 photos, but that's not the case here.

Option E is 8-25, which gives a negative number. Doesn't make sense in this context. Similarly, F is 25-8, which is 17, but that's irrelevant.

G is 25+8, same as B, which is 33. Not enough. H is 8 ÷25, which would be 0.32. Definitely not, since we're counting whole photos.

I is 25 ÷8, which is around 3.125. Again, not relevant for the total photos.

J is 8×8, which is 64. But each book has 25, not 8, so that's wrong.

So yeah, option A is definitely the right choice here. Multiplying the number of books by the number of photos per book gives the total.

To determine the total number of photos Bella has, we multiply the number of photo books (8) by the number of photos in each book (25). This is represented by the expression **25 × 8**.
