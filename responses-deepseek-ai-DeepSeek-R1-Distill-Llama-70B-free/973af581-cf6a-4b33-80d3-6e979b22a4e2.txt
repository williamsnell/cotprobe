Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the yearly salary and weekly earnings for four individuals: Y, W, U, and S. They each have different payment schedules, so I need to figure out how each one translates to a yearly amount and then to a weekly amount. 

Let's take it step by step. First, I'll look at each person's payment details.

Starting with Y: Y is paid $380 semi-monthly. Hmm, semi-monthly means they get paid twice a month, right? So that would be every two weeks. Wait, actually, semi-monthly is typically twice a month, like on the 15th and 30th. So there are 12 months in a year, and each month has two payments. So that's 24 payments a year. So to get Y's yearly salary, I multiply 380 by 24. Let me do that: 380 *24. Let's see, 380 *20 is 7600, and 380 *4 is 1520, so 7600+1520=9120. So Y's yearly salary is $9,120.

Next, to find the weekly amount, since there are 52 weeks in a year. So I take 9120 divided by 52. Let's calculate that: 52 * 175 is 9100 (because 52*175= (50*175)+(2*175)=8750+350=9100). So 9120-9100=20 left. So 20/52 is approximately 0.3846. So 175 + 0.3846 is about 175.3846. Rounding to two decimal places, that's $175.38 per week.

Now, moving on to W: W receives $55 per day and works four days each week. So W's weekly income is 55 *4 = $220. Then, the yearly salary would be 220 *52 weeks. Let me compute that. 220*50=11,000 and 220*2=440, so total is 11,440. So W's yearly is $11,440 and weekly is $220.

Next is U: U is paid $480 per month. So that's a monthly salary. There are 12 months, so yearly is 480 *12. Let me calculate: 400*12=4800 and 80*12=960, so 4800+960=5760. So U's yearly salary is $5,760. For weekly, divide by 52: 5760 /52. Let's see, 52*110=5720. So 5760-5720=40. 40/52≈0.7692. So 110 +0.7692≈110.77. So $110.77 per week.

Lastly, S makes a bi-weekly salary of $515. Bi-weekly means every two weeks. So there are 26 bi-weekly periods in a year (since 52/2=26). So yearly salary is 515 *26. Let me compute that: 500*26=13,000 and 15*26=390. So 13,000+390=13,390. So S's yearly is $13,390. For weekly, since it's bi-weekly, we can divide by 2. So 515 /2 =257.50. So $257.50 per week.

Now, let me summarize the results:

Y: $9,120 yearly; $175.38 weekly.
W: $11,440 yearly; $220 weekly.
U: $5,760 yearly; $110.77 weekly.
S: $13,390 yearly; $257.50 weekly.

Wait, but wait a second, looking at the options, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. 

Wait, for Y: semi-monthly is 24 payments a year. 380*24=9,120. That seems right. And 9120/52=175.38. That's correct.

W: 55*4=220 per week. 220*52=11,440. Correct.

U: 480*12=5,760. 5760/52≈110.77. Correct.

S: 515*26=13,390. 515/2=257.5. Correct.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches these numbers.

Option F says:
Y: $9120 yearly, $175.38 weekly;
W: $11440 yearly, $220 weekly;
U: $5760 yearly, $110.77 weekly;
S: $13390 yearly, $257.50 weekly.

Yes, that's exactly what I calculated. So the correct option would be F.

The correct answer is option **F**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Y's Salary:**
   - Paid $380 semi-monthly (24 payments/year).
   - Yearly: \( 380 \times 24 = 9,120 \).
   - Weekly: \( 9,120 \div 52 \approx 175.38 \).

2. **W's Salary:**
   - Paid $55/day, works 4 days/week.
   - Weekly: \( 55 \times 4 = 220 \).
   - Yearly: \( 220 \times 52 = 11,440 \).

3. **U's Salary:**
   - Paid $480/month.
   - Yearly: \( 480 \times 12 = 5,760 \).
   - Weekly: \( 5,760 \div 52 \approx 110.77 \).

4. **S's Salary:**
   - Paid $515 bi-weekly (26 payments/year).
   - Yearly: \( 515 \times 26 = 13,390 \).
   - Weekly: \( 515 \div 2 = 257.50 \).

**Matching with Options:**
Option **F** matches the calculated values:
- Y: $9,120 yearly, $175.38 weekly.
- W: $11,440 yearly, $220 weekly.
- U: $5,760 yearly, $110.77 weekly.
- S: $13,390 yearly, $257.50 weekly.

**Answer:** F
