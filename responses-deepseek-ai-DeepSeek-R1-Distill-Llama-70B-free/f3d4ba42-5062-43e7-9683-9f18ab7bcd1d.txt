Question:

In a clinical trial, 30 sickle cell anemia patients are randomly assigned to two groups. One group receives the currently marketed medicine, and the other group receives an experimental medicine. Each week, patients report to the clinic where blood tests are conducted. The lab technician is unaware of the kind of medicine the patient is taking. This design can be described as

Options:

A: a completely randomized design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments
B: a completely randomized design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two blocks
C: a matched-pairs design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine forming a pair
D: a double-blind design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments
E: a factorial design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two factors
F: a randomized block design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two blocks
G: a crossover design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments
H: a randomized block design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments
I: a matched-pairs design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two blocks
J: a single-blind design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments

Okay, so I've got this question about a clinical trial design, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down what the question is saying.

Alright, the setup is that there are 30 patients with sickle cell anemia. They're randomly assigned to two groups. One group gets the currently marketed medicine, and the other gets an experimental medicine. Every week, they go to the clinic for blood tests. Importantly, the lab technician doesn't know which medicine each patient is taking. So I need to determine what kind of design this is from the given options.

Hmm, the key terms here are "randomly assigned," "two groups," and "lab technician is unaware." Let's think about the different study designs.

First, I remember that in a completely randomized design, participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups. That sounds like what's happening here because the patients are split into two groups randomly. So that's a possibility.

But wait, what about blinding? The technician doesn't know which medicine the patient is on. That means the technician is blind to the treatment. But the question doesn't mention whether the patients know which group they're in. So if only the technician is blind, that's a single-blind study. If both the patients and the technicians are unaware, it's double-blind.

The question states the lab technician is unaware, but it doesn't say anything about the patients. So it's at least single-blind. But the design they're asking about might be more structural than just the blinding aspect.

Looking at the options, option A is a completely randomized design with two treatments. Option D is a double-blind design with two treatments. Option J is single-blind.

Wait, the question is about the design, not just the blinding. So the design refers to how the subjects are assigned. So completely randomized design (CRD) is when subjects are randomly assigned to treatments without any blocking. That fits here because they're randomly assigned to two groups.

So option A says it's a completely randomized design with the two medicines as treatments. That seems right. But let's check the other options too.

Option B talks about blocks, which would be a randomized block design. But the question doesn't mention any blocking variables, like pairing or matching based on something else. So probably not B.

Option C is matched-pairs, but that's when each subject is paired with another similar subject, and each gets a different treatment. The question doesn't say anything about matching, so C is unlikely.

Option D is double-blind. But the question doesn't specify that the patients are also unaware, only the technician. So D is about blinding, not the design type. The design is still completely randomized.

Option E is factorial design, which involves multiple factors and their combinations. Here, it's just two treatments, so E is out.

Option F is randomized block with two blocks. Again, no mention of blocks, so F isn't right.

Option G is crossover. That's when each subject gets both treatments in sequence. The question doesn't indicate that; each group gets one medicine, so G is not correct.

Option H is randomized block design with treatments. Again, no blocks mentioned, so probably not H.

Option I is matched-pairs as blocks, which again, the question doesn't mention pairing.

Option J is single-blind. But the question's design aspect is about random assignment, not just the blinding. The design is completely randomized, and the blinding aspect is single-blind. But the question is asking for the design, not the blinding. So the answer would be A, with the design being completely randomized, and the single-blind being an additional aspect but not the design type.

So the correct answer should be A.

The clinical trial involves 30 sickle cell anemia patients randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving the currently marketed medicine and the other receiving the experimental medicine. The lab technician is unaware of the treatment each patient is receiving, indicating some level of blinding. However, the question focuses on the design of the study rather than the blinding aspect.

In this scenario, the patients are randomly assigned to two groups without any blocking or matching variables, which aligns with a **completely randomized design (CRD)**. The two medicines are treated as separate treatments in this design. Other options, such as randomized block design, matched-pairs, or crossover design, do not fit because there is no mention of blocking, pairing, or subjects receiving both treatments sequentially.

While the study incorporates single-blind elements (the technician is unaware of the treatment), the design itself is best described as a completely randomized design. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: a completely randomized design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments.

Answer: A
