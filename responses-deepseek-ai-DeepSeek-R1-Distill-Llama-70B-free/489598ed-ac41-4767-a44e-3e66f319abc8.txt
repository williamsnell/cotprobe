Okay, so I've got this problem here about selecting a committee. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking how many ways we can form a committee of 2 men and 3 women from a group of 6 men and 8 women. Hmm, okay.

I think I remember something about combinations being used for selections where the order doesn't matter. So, like, when you're choosing people for a committee, the order in which you pick them doesn't matter, right? So this is a combination problem, not permutation.

So the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k! (n-k)!)). So I'll need to calculate two separate combinations: one for the men and one for the women.

First, let's handle the men. There are 6 men, and we need to choose 2. So that's 6 choose 2. Let's compute that. 6! divided by (2! * (6-2)! ) which simplifies to (6*5*4!)/(2*1 *4!) ). Oh wait, the 4! cancels out from numerator and denominator. So it's (6*5)/(2*1) = 30/2 = 15. So there are 15 ways to choose the men.

Next, the women. There are 8 women, and we need 3. So that's 8 choose 3. Let me calculate that. 8! / (3! (8-3)! ) = (8*7*6*5!)/(3! *5! ). The 5! cancels out, leaving (8*7*6)/(3*2*1). 8*7 is 56, times 6 is 336. Divided by 6 (since 3*2=6), 336/6 is 56. So 56 ways for the women.

Now, since these are independent choices (selecting men and women don't affect each other), I think I multiply the two numbers together to get the total number of ways. So 15 ways for men multiplied by 56 for women. Let me compute that.

15 * 56... let's see. 10*56 is 560, and 5*56 is 280, so 560 + 280 = 840. So 840 total ways.

Looking at the options, option I is 840. So the answer should be I.

To determine the number of ways to select a committee of 2 men and 3 women from a group of 6 men and 8 women, we use combinations, as the order of selection does not matter. 

1. **Selecting 2 men from 6**:  
   The number of ways to choose 2 men from 6 is given by the combination formula:  
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

2. **Selecting 3 women from 8**:  
   The number of ways to choose 3 women from 8 is:  
   \[
   \binom{8}{3} = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
   \]

3. **Total number of ways**:  
   Since the selections of men and women are independent, we multiply the two results:  
   \[
   15 \times 56 = 840
   \]

Thus, the total number of ways to form the committee is **840**, which corresponds to option **I**.
