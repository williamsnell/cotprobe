Alright, so I need to figure out what the title "Dalai Lama" means. Hmm, I remember that "Dalai" is related to the ocean in some way, maybe from a language like Tibetan or Mongolian. I think "Dalai" translates to "ocean." So the first part of the title is about the ocean.

Now, the second part is "Lama." I'm pretty sure "Lama" is a term used in Tibetan Buddhism for a religious teacher or monk, someone wise. So "Lama" probably means "wisdom" or refers to a wise person.

Putting it together, "Dalai Lama" would be something like "Ocean of Wisdom." Let me think about the options. Option H is "Ocean of Wisdom," which fits. I don't think it's "Lover of Wisdom" because that would imply a different structure. Also, "Ocean of Stillness" is another option, but I don't recall "Lama" meaning stillness. It's more about wisdom.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. I remember that "Dalai" comes from the Mongolian word for ocean. So "Dalai Lama" as "Ocean Lama," with Lama being a wise teacher, so "Ocean of Wisdom" makes sense. That would be option H.

The title "Dalai Lama" translates to "Ocean of Wisdom." "Dalai" means "ocean," and "Lama" refers to a wise teacher in Tibetan Buddhism. 

Answer: H
