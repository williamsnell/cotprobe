Okay, so I've got this question about John Rawls and his theory of justice. I remember that Rawls introduced the concept of the original position, where people come together to decide the principles of a just society without knowing their personal circumstances. That's the veil of ignorance part. The question is about what the parties in the original position (POP) would opt for regarding 'social primary goods'.

Wait, social primary goods are those things that every rational person is presumed to want. From what I recall, these include things like basic rights and liberties, freedom of movement, free choice of occupation, and the social bases of self-respect. Also, they include wealth and income, but only as means to achieve these other things.

So the options are A through D. Let's look at each one.

Option A: The POP will choose wealth over a compassionate society. Hmm. I don't think so. Rawls' theory isn't about maximizing wealth for its own sake. Instead, it's about ensuring that everyone has enough to meet their basic needs. The difference principle comes into play here, which allows for inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged. So it's not just about choosing wealth; it's about how wealth is distributed.

Option B: The POP will choose equality over power. That sounds more plausible. Rawls' principles prioritize equal basic liberties and equal opportunity. The first principle is about equal rights, and the second includes the idea of fair equality of opportunity. So equality is a big deal. But I'm not sure about the 'power' part. Do the POP choose equality over power? I think Rawls is more concerned with ensuring a fair distribution that reduces inequalities that are not to everyone's advantage.

Option C: The POP will be unselfish. Wait, no. The parties in the original position are supposed to be rational and self-interested, but they're choosing principles that they think will benefit them, given that they don't know where they'll end up in society. So they're not being unselfish; they're being prudent and fair. So option C doesn't seem right.

Option D: The POP will choose to protect the disabled. I'm not sure. Rawls does talk about ensuring that everyone has access to primary goods, including those who are less advantaged. The difference principle is supposed to help the least advantaged members of society. So maybe protecting the disabled falls under that. But is that the primary focus when it comes to social primary goods? I think the broader principle is about structuring society so that inequalities are only allowed if they help the worst-off.

Wait, another thought. The primary goods are about what people need to pursue their plans of life. So the POP would want to ensure that everyone has enough, regardless of their abilities. That might mean ensuring that even the disabled have access to these goods, perhaps through social support. So option D could be correct.

But looking back at the options, the question is about which proposition is most consistent with what Rawls claims the POP would opt for. So which is more central to his argument?

Rawls' two principles of justice: first, equal basic liberties, and second, fair equality of opportunity and the difference principle. So the POP would choose to maximize the minimum level of primary goods, ensuring that even the least advantaged are as well off as possible.

So option D says they choose to protect the disabled, which would be part of ensuring the least advantaged are protected. But I'm not sure if that's the exact wording Rawls uses. Alternatively, option B is about equality over power, which aligns with the first principle's emphasis on equal rights.

Wait, the question is about social primary goods. So it's about the distribution of these goods, not just rights. The difference principle is about how to distribute these goods. So the POP would choose to structure society so that the distribution of primary goods benefits the least advantaged. So perhaps option D is about protecting the disabled, which would be part of that.

Alternatively, option B is more about equality in general. But Rawls allows for inequalities as long as they benefit the least. So equality isn't the only goal.

Wait, the question is phrased as which proposition is most consistent with what Rawls says the POP would opt for regarding social primary goods. So I think the POP would opt to ensure that everyone has sufficient primary goods, with a focus on the least advantaged. So protecting the disabled would fit because they are among the least advantaged groups.

So the answer would be D: The POP will choose to protect the disabled.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should cross-check. Another approach: the POP are self-interested but behind the veil of ignorance. They don't know their abilities, so they would want a society that supports those who are less fortunate, including the disabled. So yes, the POP would choose to protect the disabled to ensure that even in the worst case, they're taken care of.

So I think the correct answer is D.

The question asks which proposition is most consistent with what Rawls claims the parties in the original position (POP) would opt for regarding 'social primary goods.' Rawls' theory emphasizes that the POP, operating under the veil of ignorance, would prioritize principles ensuring a just distribution of social primary goods—such as basic rights, liberties, and resources—especially for the least advantaged. The difference principle allows inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged, and the POP would aim to maximize the minimum level of primary goods for all.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests the POP would choose wealth over a compassionate society. This is inconsistent with Rawls, as the goal is not to maximize wealth for its own sake but to ensure fair distribution and meet basic needs.
- **Option B** states the POP would choose equality over power. While equality is a key principle, Rawls allows for certain inequalities if they benefit the least advantaged, so this option is not fully aligned with his theory.
- **Option C** claims the POP will be unselfish. However, the POP are rational and self-interested, aiming to ensure their own well-being under the veil of ignorance, so this is incorrect.
- **Option D** suggests the POP will choose to protect the disabled. This aligns with Rawls' emphasis on ensuring the least advantaged, including disabled individuals, have access to social primary goods. Protecting the disabled is consistent with the POP's goal of structuring society to benefit all, especially the most vulnerable.

Given Rawls' focus on the least advantaged and the distribution of social primary goods, **Option D** is the most consistent with his claims.

Answer: D
