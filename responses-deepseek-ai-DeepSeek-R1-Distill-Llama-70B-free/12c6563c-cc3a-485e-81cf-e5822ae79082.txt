Okay, so I've got this question about public relations, specifically referencing a theory by Esman from 1972. The question is asking which type of publics help an organization exist by lending authority or assistance. The options are A through J, each a different term.

First, I need to recall what I know about publics in PR. I remember that there are different categories of publics based on how they interact with an organization. Let me think... I think there's something about different types like strategic, enabling, functional, and normative publics.

Wait, Esman talked about four types of publics. From what I remember, he categorized them as the strategic, enabling, functional, and normative publics. Each plays a different role in the organization's operations.

The question is about which publics lend authority or assistance. So I should think about what each of these terms means.

Strategic publics are those that an organization interacts with to achieve specific goals. They might be customers, clients, or others directly related to the organization's objectives.

Enabling publics, if I remember correctly, are those that provide the organization with the authority or the means to operate. They're like the stakeholders who give the organization its legitimacy or resources. For example, the government might grant permits, or investors provide funding.

Functional publics are more about the day-to-day operations. They help the organization function smoothly, like employees or suppliers. They're essential for the operational aspects but not necessarily about authority.

Normative publics are influenced by societal norms and values. They might pressure the organization to conform to certain standards, but they don't directly enable the organization's existence through authority.

So the question is about which publics help the organization exist by lending authority or assistance. That sounds like enabling publics because they provide the necessary authority, like legal permits, funding, or support that allows the organization to operate.

Looking at the options, option B is Enabling. So I think the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B: Enabling. According to Esman (1972), enabling publics are those that provide an organization with the authority or resources necessary to exist and operate. This includes stakeholders such as government entities granting permits or investors providing financial support.

Answer: B
