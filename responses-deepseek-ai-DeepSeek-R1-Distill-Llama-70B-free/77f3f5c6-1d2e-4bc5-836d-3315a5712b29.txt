Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding the insanity defense. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question says that a husband is on trial for murder and pleads insanity. In this jurisdiction, the defense of insanity is an affirmative defense. The question is asking what the husband must do to prove his defense.

I remember that in criminal law, the burden of proof generally rests on the prosecution to prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. However, when it comes to affirmative defenses like insanity, the rules might be different.

An affirmative defense is a defense that, if proven, would justify or excuse the defendant's conduct. For such defenses, the burden often shifts to the defendant. So, I think the defendant has the burden of production and maybe even the burden of persuasion.

Wait, let me clarify. The burden of production refers to the obligation to present evidence on the issue. The burden of persuasion is the obligation to convince the factfinder (judge or jury) that the claim is true by a certain standard.

In some jurisdictions, for affirmative defenses, the defendant has both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion. But I'm not sure about the specific standards here.

The options are:

A: Neither burden of production nor persuasion. That doesn't sound right because affirmative defenses usually require the defendant to present evidence.

B: Burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That's the prosecution's burden for the crime itself, not the defense.

C: Burden of production. So only the duty to present evidence, but what about persuasion?

D: Show a history of mental illness. That's one aspect, but maybe not the full requirement.

E: Provide substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is a term often used in civil cases for the burden of production. But in criminal cases, I think it's different.

F: Expert testimony. While expert testimony is common in insanity defenses, it's not necessarily required. The defendant might use it, but it's not an obligation.

G: Prove innocence. No, the defense doesn't have to prove innocence, just that they meet the criteria for the defense.

H: Convince jury of mental instability. That sounds like persuasion, but does the defendant have the burden of persuasion?

I: Burden of persuasion only. So the defendant must convince the jury but doesn't have to present evidence? That doesn't make sense because the defendant would have to present some evidence to meet the burden.

Wait, in an affirmative defense, the defendant typically has the burden of production and sometimes also the burden of persuasion. But I'm a bit confused about whether it's both or just one.

I think that in many jurisdictions, the defendant bears the burden of proof (both production and persuasion) for an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. But sometimes, it's just the burden of production, and once met, the prosecution has to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt.

Wait, no. The prosecution must prove all elements beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense, when raising an affirmative defense, has the burden of production (to present enough evidence), but the burden of persuasion might still be on the prosecution to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. Or maybe the defense must prove it by a certain standard.

Hmm, let me think. For example, in some places, the defendant must prove insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. That would mean they have both the burden of production and persuasion.

But the question is about the jurisdiction where the defense is an affirmative defense. So in such cases, I believe the defendant has the burden of production, which means they must present sufficient evidence to support the defense. But what about the burden of persuasion?

I think that the burden of persuasion is on the defendant for an affirmative defense. So the defendant must prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence (which is a lower standard than beyond a reasonable doubt).

Wait, but in some states, the burden is on the defendant to prove insanity by a preponderance, which includes both production and persuasion.

Looking back at the options, option C is burden of production, option E is substantial evidence, which is more about the production side. Option I is burden of persuasion only, which doesn't make sense because you have to produce evidence too.

So the correct answer would be that the husband has the burden of production, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. I remember that in the federal system and many states, when the defense is an affirmative defense, the prosecution must prove the defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. So in that case, the defendant doesn't have the burden of persuasion, only the burden of production.

Wait, that complicates things. So the initial burden is on the prosecution to prove that the defendant was sane. So if the defendant presents enough evidence (burden of production), the prosecution then has to disprove insanity beyond a reasonable doubt.

But in some jurisdictions, it's the other way around. So the defendant must prove insanity by a preponderance.

Wait, but the question says that in the jurisdiction, the defense of insanity is an affirmative defense. So that would mean that the defendant has the burden of proving it. So maybe the defendant has both the burden of production and persuasion.

Wait, no. Because the question is about the burden of production and persuasion. So an affirmative defense typically requires the defendant to have the burden of production, but not necessarily persuasion. Or does it?

Alternatively, in some places, once the defendant introduces sufficient evidence (meets burden of production), the prosecution must negate it beyond a reasonable doubt. So the burden of persuasion remains with the prosecution.

So in that case, the defendant only has the burden of production, not persuasion.

So looking back, the options:

C: burden of production.

E: provide substantial evidence (which is similar to burden of production, as substantial evidence is enough to support a verdict).

But I think the correct term is burden of production. So option C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let me think again. The US Supreme Court case of Patterson v. New York (1978) held that states can place the burden of proving insanity on the defendant. So in such jurisdictions, the defendant has the burden of persuasion (i.e., must prove insanity by a preponderance or perhaps clear and convincing evidence, depending on the state).

So if the jurisdiction follows that, then the husband would have both the burden of production and persuasion. But looking at the options, there's no option that says both. The closest would be option I (burden of persuasion only) or option C (burden of production only).

Wait, but the options don't have an option that combines both. So perhaps, in this question, the jurisdiction requires the defendant to prove the defense by a preponderance, meaning both burden of production and persuasion. But none of the options say that.

Looking at the options again, option E is "the requirement to provide substantial evidence of his insanity at the time of the crime." Substantial evidence is a standard for the burden of production, not persuasion. So if the jurisdiction requires the defendant to prove insanity, he must provide substantial evidence (production) and also persuade the jury (persuasion). But the options don't combine both.

Wait, but perhaps in this question, the correct answer is E. Because it's about providing substantial evidence. Alternatively, option C, which is burden of production.

Alternatively, the correct answer is E because it's the requirement to provide substantial evidence, which is the burden of production.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the terminology. The burden of production is the duty to come forward with evidence. The burden of persuasion is the duty to convince the factfinder.

In an affirmative defense, the defendant has the burden of production, which means they must present enough evidence to support the defense. If they meet this burden, then the prosecution must disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt.

But in some jurisdictions, the defendant has the burden of persuasion as well, meaning they have to prove the defense by a preponderance.

So, in this question, the husband must prove his defense. So he has both the burden of production and persuasion. But looking at the options, there's no such option. So perhaps the correct answer is C, burden of production, because that's the initial step.

Wait, no, the question is about what the husband must do to prove his defense. So he must produce evidence (burden of production) and also persuade (burden of persuasion). But the options don't have both. So perhaps the answer is E, which is about providing substantial evidence, which is the burden of production.

Wait, but let me think again. The standard for burden of production is that the defendant must present sufficient evidence so that the issue must be considered by the factfinder. Substantial evidence is a term used to describe this burden. So option E says "provide substantial evidence of his insanity at the time of the crime," which seems to align with the burden of production.

Alternatively, option C is "the burden of production," which is correct. So between C and E.

Wait, the options are worded as what the husband "has" in order to prove his defense. So the options are about what the husband must do.

Option C says he has the burden of production. So that's correct because he must produce evidence.

But wait, if the jurisdiction requires the defendant to prove the defense by a preponderance, then he would have both burdens. But the options don't include that.

Thus, the correct answer is C: the burden of production.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the term "burden of proof" is used to include both production and persuasion. But in the options, B is "burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt," which is the prosecution's burden.

So, the husband doesn't have the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; that's for the prosecution. Therefore, the husband's burden is either production or persuasion.

So, in this case, the husband's burden is the burden of production. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

In criminal law, the burden of proof generally rests on the prosecution to prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. However, when an affirmative defense, such as insanity, is raised, the burden shifts to the defendant in some jurisdictions. The question asks what the husband must do to prove his insanity defense in a jurisdiction where it is an affirmative defense.

An affirmative defense requires the defendant to meet certain obligations. Specifically, the burden of production refers to the obligation to present sufficient evidence to support the defense, while the burden of persuasion refers to the obligation to convince the factfinder (judge or jury) that the defense applies. In many jurisdictions, the defendant bears the burden of production for an affirmative defense, meaning they must provide enough evidence to raise the issue. Once this burden is met, the prosecution may then need to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The defendant cannot avoid both the burden of production and persuasion for an affirmative defense.
- **B**: Incorrect. The burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies to the prosecution, not the defendant, for proving the elements of the crime.
- **C**: Correct. The defendant has the burden of production, meaning they must present sufficient evidence to support the insanity defense.
- **D**: Incorrect. While a history of mental illness may be relevant, it is not the specific requirement for proving insanity.
- **E**: Incorrect. Providing substantial evidence is related to the burden of production, but this option is less precise than option C.
- **F**: Incorrect. Expert testimony is a common tool but not a strict requirement for proving insanity.
- **G**: Incorrect. The defendant does not need to prove innocence, only that they meet the criteria for the affirmative defense.
- **H**: Incorrect. Convincing the jury of mental instability is part of the burden of persuasion, which may not apply in this jurisdiction.
- **I**: Incorrect. The burden of persuasion alone does not account for the need to present evidence.

The most accurate answer is that the husband has the burden of production, as he must present sufficient evidence to raise the issue of insanity.
