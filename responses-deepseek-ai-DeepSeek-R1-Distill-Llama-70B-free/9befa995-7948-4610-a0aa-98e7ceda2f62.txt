Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says the distance from Chicago to New York City is 794 miles, and I need to round that to the nearest hundred. Hmm, rounding to the nearest hundred, right. Let me think about how rounding works.

First, I remember that when you round a number, you look at the digit in the place just below the one you're rounding to. In this case, since we're rounding to the nearest hundred, I should look at the tens place. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the hundreds place is the third digit from the right. So 794 is a three-digit number. Breaking it down: 7 is in the hundreds place, 9 is in the tens, and 4 is in the ones.

When rounding to the nearest hundred, I should focus on the digit in the tens place. If that digit is 5 or higher, I round the hundreds place up by one. If it's less than 5, I leave the hundreds place as it is. So in 794, the tens digit is 9. Oh, 9 is definitely higher than 5. So that means I need to round up the hundreds place.

The hundreds digit is 7. Rounding up from 7 would make it 8. So the number becomes 800. Let me double-check that. 794 is between 700 and 800. Since the tens digit is 9, which is more than 5, it's closer to 800 than 700. So yes, 800 is correct.

Looking at the options, option G is 800. So the answer should be G. Let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. The number is 794, rounding to the nearest hundred. Tens digit is 9, which is >=5, so round up. 7 becomes 8, so 800. Yep, that makes sense.

The number 794 is rounded to the nearest hundred by examining the tens digit, which is 9. Since 9 is greater than or equal to 5, the hundreds digit (7) is increased by 1, resulting in 800.

G: 800

Answer: G
