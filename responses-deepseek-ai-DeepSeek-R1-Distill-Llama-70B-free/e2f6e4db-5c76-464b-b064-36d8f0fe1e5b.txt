Okay, so I've got this problem here about oxygen molecules arriving at the mitochondria in an active person. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, where do I start?

Alright, the question says the person has a mass of 84 kg. So first, I think I need to calculate the total oxygen consumption per minute for the whole body. The given rate is 40 mL of O2 per minute per kilogram. So for 84 kg, that should be 40 mL/kg * 84 kg. Let me do that math: 40 * 84 is 3360 mL per minute. So the person uses 3360 mL of O2 each minute.

Wait, but the question is about how many molecules arrive each second at each mitochondrion. So I need to convert this volume into the number of molecules. Oh right, I'll need to use the ideal gas law for that. The conditions are T=300 K and P=1.00 atm.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. I need to find the number of moles of O2 consumed per second. Let me remember the gas constant R. Oh right, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). 

But wait, the volume given is per minute, and I need per second. Let me handle the time conversion first. So 3360 mL per minute is 3360 / 60 = 56 mL per second. Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Because 40 mL per kg per minute: the total is 40*84=3360 mL/min. So per second, it's 3360 mL / 60 s = 56 mL/s. So 56 mL/s is the total O2 consumption rate.

But to find the number of molecules, I should probably convert that volume into moles, then multiply by Avogadro's number. 

So first, let's convert mL to liters. 56 mL is 0.056 L. Using PV=nRT, P is 1 atm, V is 0.056 L, T is 300 K, R is 0.0821. So n = (P V )/(R T).

n = (1 atm * 0.056 L) / (0.0821 * 300) 

Let me calculate the denominator: 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 24.63. So n ≈ (0.056) / 24.63 ≈ 0.002275 mol. So about 0.002275 moles of O2 per second.

Now, each mole has Avogadro's number of molecules, which is 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So the number of molecules per second is 0.002275 * 6.022e23 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.002275 * 6.022e23 = (2.275e-3 ) * 6.022e23 = approximately 1.37e21 molecules per second.

Wait, but wait, no. That's the total for the entire body per second. But each mitochondrion in each cell is getting some fraction of that. Oh right, because each cell has many mitochondria, and each kg has many cells.

So the problem states that per kilogram of body mass, there are 1.6e10 cells. And each cell has about 800 mitochondria. So for 84 kg, the total number of cells is 1.6e10 cells/kg * 84 kg = 1.6e10 * 84 = 1.344e12 cells.

Each cell has 800 mitochondria, so total mitochondria is 1.344e12 * 800 = 1.0752e15 mitochondria.

Now, the total number of O2 molecules per second is 1.37e21. So per mitochondrion, it's 1.37e21 / 1.0752e15 ≈ 1.27e6 molecules per second per mitochondrion.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait, maybe I missed a step. Let me go back.

The total O2 per second is 56 mL/s. Wait, wait no, 3360 mL per minute is the total, so per second is 56 mL/s. So that part is correct.

Then, converting to moles: n = (1 atm * 0.056 L) / (0.0821 * 300) = 0.056/(24.63) ≈ 0.002275 mol/s.

Multiply by Avogadro: 0.002275 * 6.022e23 = approx 1.37e21 molecules/s.

Total cells: 84 kg * 1.6e10 cells/kg = 1.344e12 cells.

Total mitochondria: 1.344e12 * 800 ≈ 1.0752e15.

Molecules per mitochondrion per second: 1.37e21 / 1.0752e15 ≈ 1.27e6. 

Looking at the options, option C is 1.27e6. So the answer should be C.

To determine how many oxygen molecules arrive each second at the mitochondria of an active person with a mass of 84 kg, we proceed as follows:

1. **Total Oxygen Consumption**:  
   The oxygen consumption rate is given as 40 mL of O₂ per minute per kilogram of body weight. For an 84 kg person, the total oxygen consumption is:  
   \[
   40 \, \text{mL/kg/min} \times 84 \, \text{kg} = 3360 \, \text{mL/min}.
   \]  
   Converting this to per second:  
   \[
   \frac{3360 \, \text{mL/min}}{60 \, \text{s/min}} = 56 \, \text{mL/s}.
   \]

2. **Convert Volume to Moles**:  
   Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), where \( P = 1.00 \, \text{atm} \), \( V = 0.056 \, \text{L} \) (since \( 56 \, \text{mL} = 0.056 \, \text{L} \)), \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), and \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \):  
   \[
   n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(1.00 \, \text{atm})(0.056 \, \text{L})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(300 \, \text{K})} \approx 0.002275 \, \text{mol/s}.
   \]

3. **Convert Moles to Molecules**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \)):  
   \[
   \text{Molecules per second} = 0.002275 \, \text{mol/s} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{21} \, \text{molecules/s}.
   \]

4. **Total Mitochondria in the Body**:  
   The number of cells per kilogram is \( 1.6 \times 10^{10} \), and each cell contains 800 mitochondria. For 84 kg:  
   \[
   \text{Total cells} = 1.6 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cells/kg} \times 84 \, \text{kg} = 1.344 \times 10^{12} \, \text{cells}.
   \]  
   Total mitochondria:  
   \[
   1.344 \times 10^{12} \, \text{cells} \times 800 \, \text{mitochondria/cell} = 1.0752 \times 10^{15} \, \text{mitochondria}.
   \]

5. **Molecules per Mitochondrion per Second**:  
   Divide the total number of oxygen molecules by the total number of mitochondria:  
   \[
   \frac{1.37 \times 10^{21} \, \text{molecules/s}}{1.0752 \times 10^{15} \, \text{mitochondria}} \approx 1.27 \times 10^{6} \, \text{molecules/(mitochondrion·s)}.
   \]

Thus, the number of oxygen molecules arriving each second at each mitochondrion is approximately \( 1.27 \times 10^6 \). The correct answer is:

**C: \( 1.27 \times 10^6 \)**
