Question:

A land development company was the owner of a400-acre tract of land in the Great Lakes region. Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that "the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. "After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor  land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. "At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?

Options:

A: Easement appurtenant.
B: Fee simple subject to executory limitation.
C: Leasehold estate.
D: Fee simple absolute.
E: Remainder interest.
F: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.
G: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.
H: Fee simple determinable.
I: Life estate pur autre vie.
J: Fee simple defeasible.

Okay, so I've got this real property question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup is about a land development company that owns a 400-acre tract. They develop two subdivisions, each 150 acres—eastern and western. The plats for each have the same restrictions, which say that the land can only be used for single-family homes. The covenant runs with the land, binding all lot owners, their heirs, and assigns.

Then, after selling most of the lots in both subdivisions, the company sells 50 acres to a country club. The deed has specific provisions. Let me read that again. The deed says:

1. The property can be used as a country club with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, clubhouse, etc.
2. It can also be subdivided into a residential area similar to the eastern development, and then it must follow the same residential restrictions as the eastern one.
3. The restrictions are covenants running with the land. If there's a breach, the grantor (the land company) can choose to re-enter and terminate the estate.

So the question is about the country club's interest in the 50-acre tract. The options are various types of estates and interests.

Hmm. I remember that when a deed includes conditions or restrictions, it affects the type of estate conveyed. Let's think about the different options.

Option A: Easement appurtenant. That's a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. But here, the country club is buying land, not just the right to use it. So probably not an easement.

Option B: Fee simple subject to executory limitation. An executory interest is a type of future interest where the holder has the right to take possession if a condition is met. I think this might come into play if the grantor has a right to take back the property upon a breach.

Option C: Leasehold estate. That's when you have a lease, but here the country club is getting a deed, not a lease. So it's not a leasehold.

Option D: Fee simple absolute. That's the highest form of ownership without any conditions. But the deed has restrictions, so it's probably not absolute.

Option E: Remainder interest. That's when someone has an interest that follows after a prior estate. Doesn't seem to fit here because the country club is getting present ownership, not something that kicks in later.

Option F: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest. A determinable fee means it automatically ends if a condition happens. But wait, the grantor here doesn't automatically get it back; they have an option to re-enter. So maybe not.

Option G: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent. This is when the grantor has a right of re-entry if a condition is breached. The grantor can choose to take back the property but doesn't have to. That sounds like what's happening here because the grantor can choose to terminate the estate if there's a breach.

Option H: Fee simple determinable. This is when the estate automatically ends upon a condition. The deed would use words like "so long as" or "until." The deed here says the grantor may re-enter, which is a condition subsequent, not automatic.

Option I: Life estate pur autre vie. That's an estate for the life of someone else. Not relevant here.

Option J: Fee simple defeasible. This is a broader category that includes determinable and subject to condition subsequent. But the specific type would be more accurate—like G or H.

So looking back, the deed gives the country club the land but with conditions. The key is that upon breach, the grantor has the option to re-enter and terminate the estate. That's a condition subsequent, which creates a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between F and G. Let me clarify. A determinable fee is created with language like "as long as" or "until." Here, the deed allows the grantor to choose to re-enter. That's a right of re-entry, which is a condition subsequent. So the country club's estate is fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which is option G.

Wait, but option F is determinable fee subject to executory interest. Or is it? No, because an executory interest is when a third party (not the grantor) has the right to take the property upon breach. Here, the grantor retains the right, which is a condition subsequent, so the estate is subject to condition subsequent, not an executory limitation.

So I think the correct answer is G: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

The country club's interest in the 50-acre tract is determined by analyzing the deed's provisions. The deed imposes restrictions on the property's use and grants the land development company the right to re-enter and terminate the estate upon a breach of the covenants. This right of re-entry is a classic example of a **condition subsequent**, which allows the grantor to choose whether to reclaim the property if the condition is violated. 

Key points of analysis:
- The deed does not automatically terminate the estate upon a breach (which would indicate a **determinable fee**).
- The grantor retains a right of re-entry, which is characteristic of a **condition subsequent**.
- The country club holds a **fee simple estate**, but it is not absolute because of the restrictions and the grantor's right to re-enter.

Thus, the country club's interest is best described as a **fee simple subject to condition subsequent**.
