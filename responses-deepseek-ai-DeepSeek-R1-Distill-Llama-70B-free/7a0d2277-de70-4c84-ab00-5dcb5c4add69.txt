Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spring. Hmm, let me read it again. It says that 2 J of work is needed to stretch a spring from its natural length of 30 cm to 42 cm. The question is asking how far beyond its natural length a force of 30 N will keep the spring stretched. And then there are multiple-choice options.

Alright, I'm a bit rusty on spring problems, but I remember that springs obey Hooke's Law. Hooke's Law says that the force needed to stretch or compress a spring is proportional to its displacement from the natural length. The formula is F = kx, where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement.

Wait, but the problem here mentions work done, which is energy. Oh right, the work done to stretch the spring is related to the potential energy stored in it. Oh yeah, the potential energy U in a spring is given by U = (1/2)kx².

So the first part of the problem gives me the work done, which equals the potential energy. So 2 J = (1/2)kx². I can use this to find the spring constant k.

Wait, what's x in this case? The spring is stretched from 30 cm to 42 cm, so the displacement is 42 cm - 30 cm = 12 cm. Oh wait, but I need to convert that to meters because the units in physics are usually in SI. So 12 cm is 0.12 meters.

Putting that into the equation: 2 J = (1/2) * k * (0.12 m)². Let me solve for k.

So 2 = 0.5 * k * 0.0144. Wait, 0.12 squared is 0.0144. So 2 = 0.5 * k * 0.0144.

Wait, 0.5 * 0.0144 is 0.0072. So 2 = k * 0.0072. To find k, divide both sides by 0.0072: k = 2 / 0.0072.

Let me calculate that. 2 divided by 0.0072. Hmm, 0.0072 is 7.2e-3. So 2 / 0.0072 = 2000 / 7.2. Let me do that division. 7.2 times 277 is approximately 2000? Wait, 7.2 times 277 is 7.2*277. Let me compute 7 * 277 = 1939, and 0.2 * 277 = 55.4. So total 1939 + 55.4 = 1994.4. That's about 277. Close enough for now. So k is approximately 277.777... N/m. Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, 0.0072 is 7.2e-3. So 2 / 0.0072 = 2 / (7.2/1000) ) = 2 * (1000/7.2) = 2000 / 7.2. Yes. So 2000 divided by 7.2. Let's compute that: 7.2 times 277 is 2000 - like I had before. So k is approximately 277.78 N/m.

Wait, let me get more precise. 7.2 * 277 = 7.2 * 200 = 1440, 7.2 *77= 554.4. So 1440 + 554.4=1994.4. So 2000 is 5.6 more. So 5.6 /7.2 is about 0.777... So k is 277.777..., approximately 277.78 N/m.

Okay, now that I have k, the next part is to find out how far the spring stretches when a force of 30 N is applied. Using Hooke's Law, F = kx. So x = F/k.

So F is 30 N, k is approximately 277.78 N/m. So x = 30 / 277.78.

Let me compute that. 30 divided by 277.78. Hmm, 30/277.78. Let me see. 277.78 is about 277.78. So 30/277.78 is approximately ?

Wait, 277.78 is about 278. So 30/278 is approximately 0.108. Wait, 278 * 0.1 is 27.8, 0.108 *278 = 30. Because 0.1 *278=27.8, 0.008*278=2.224. So 27.8 + 2.224 = 30.024. So x≈0.108 meters, which is 10.8 centimeters. So the displacement is 10.8 cm beyond the natural length.

Wait, but let me check my calculation. Let me do 30 divided by 277.7777778. Let me compute 30 / (2000/7.2) )= 30 * 7.2 / 2000.

30*7.2 is 216. 216 divided by 2000 is 0.108 meters, which is 10.8 cm.

So the displacement is 10.8 cm beyond natural length. So looking at the options, option F is 10.8 cm.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let's recap:

Work done (U) is 2 J = ½ k x², where x is 0.12 m. So solving for k gives 277.778 N/m.

Then, F = 30 N = k x => x = 30 / 277.778 ≈ 0.108 m = 10.8 cm.

So yes, the answer should be 10.8 cm, which is option F.

To solve the problem, we start by using the relationship between the work done on the spring and the potential energy stored in it. The work done is given as \( 2 \, \mathrm{J} \), and the potential energy in a spring is described by the formula:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

Here, \( x \) is the displacement of the spring from its natural length. The spring is stretched from \( 30 \, \mathrm{cm} \) to \( 42 \, \mathrm{cm} \), so the displacement is:

\[
x = 42 \, \mathrm{cm} - 30 \, \mathrm{cm} = 12 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.12 \, \mathrm{m}
\]

Substituting the known values into the potential energy equation:

\[
2 = \frac{1}{2} k (0.12)^2
\]

Simplify \( (0.12)^2 = 0.0144 \):

\[
2 = 0.5 k (0.0144)
\]

\[
2 = k (0.0072)
\]

Solve for \( k \):

\[
k = \frac{2}{0.0072} = 277.78 \, \mathrm{N/m}
\]

Now, using Hooke's Law, \( F = kx \), we can find the displacement \( x \) when a force of \( 30 \, \mathrm{N} \) is applied:

\[
x = \frac{F}{k} = \frac{30}{277.78}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
x \approx 0.108 \, \mathrm{m} = 10.8 \, \mathrm{cm}
\]

Thus, the spring will be stretched \( 10.8 \, \mathrm{cm} \) beyond its natural length by a force of \( 30 \, \mathrm{N} \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 10.8 cm**
