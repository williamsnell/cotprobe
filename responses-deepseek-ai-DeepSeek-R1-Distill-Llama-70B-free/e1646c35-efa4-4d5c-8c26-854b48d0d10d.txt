Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Fraunhofer diffraction patterns from a circular aperture. Hmm, I remember that Fraunhofer diffraction is when you have far-field diffraction, so the light source is point-like and the observation screen is far away. The question is about the first diagonal maximum, but wait, wait, diagonal maximum? Oh wait, probably the first secondary maximum, not the central maximum. Because the central maximum is the brightest, and the first secondary is the first peak after that.

So the problem is asking for the value of I/I₀ at this first diagonal maximum. I think I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is called the Airy pattern. The central maximum is the brightest, and the first secondary maximum has a certain intensity relative to the central one.

The formula for the intensity in the Airy pattern is I = I₀ (J₁(x)/(x))², where x is the argument of the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1. At the central maximum, x is 0, and J₁(0) is 0.5, so I₀ would be when x approaches 0. Let me think, when x approaches 0, J₁(x) ≈ ½ x, so (J₁(x)/x)² becomes (½ x /x )² = (½)^2 = ¼. So I₀ would be the maximum intensity, which is I₀. Wait, no, wait. No, in the formula, I think I₀ is the intensity at the center, which is when x is zero. So the central maximum is I₀ = I₀ (since J₁(0) is ½, so (½/x) as x approaches zero... wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The general formula is I(θ) = I₀ (J₁(k a sinθ)/(k a sinθ))². Here, a is the radius of the aperture, k is 2π/λ. The variable is x = k a sinθ. So the central maximum is at x=0, which gives the maximum intensity I₀. Then the first secondary maximum is the first peak after x=0. 

I recall that the positions of the minima are where J₁(x) = 0. The first minimum is at x ≈ 3.8317, which is the first zero of J₁. But the maxima are in between the zeros. The first secondary maximum occurs at a value of x where the derivative of J₁(x)/x is zero. Wait, or maybe it's where the derivative of (J₁(x))^2/(x²) is zero. Alternatively, perhaps where the function J₁(x)/x has its first maximum after x=0.

I think the first maximum occurs at x ≈ 1.8412 times pi? Or wait, no, maybe it's x ≈ 1.8412. Wait, wait, the first zero of J₁(x) is at x ≈ 3.8317, but the maxima occur at different points.

Let me think. The maxima of J₁(x) occur at specific points. Wait, the function J₁(x) starts at 0.5x when x is small. It goes up and down. The first maximum of J₁(x) occurs at x ≈ 1.8412. Oh wait, no, that's the first zero of J₀(x). Wait, J₀(x) has its first zero at x≈2.4048, and J₁ has its first zero at 3.8317. But the maxima of J₁(x)... Hmm. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The intensity in the Airy pattern is given by (J₁(x)/x)^2. The first maximum after the central peak occurs where the derivative of this function is zero. So to find the maxima, we can take the derivative of (J₁(x)/x)^2 and set it to zero.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember the values. I think the first secondary maximum occurs at an x value of approximately 5.1356, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's one of the minima. Wait, no, the minima are at x = 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the first secondary maximum would be between the first and second minima. Wait, the first minimum is at 3.8317, so the first secondary maximum would be before that. Wait, no, the central maximum is at x=0, then the first minimum is at 3.8317, so the first secondary maximum is between 0 and 3.8317.

Wait, no. The central maximum is the first peak, and the secondary maxima are the lower peaks after that. So the first secondary maximum is the first peak after the central maximum, which would be the first peak beyond the central maximum. So between the central maximum and the first minimum.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the x value where the maximum occurs. I remember that the first secondary maximum occurs at x ≈ 1.8412. Wait, no, that's the first zero of J₁(x) isn't it? No, wait J₁(x)'s first zero is at x≈3.8317. Wait, J₁(1.8412) is zero? No, J₀(2.4048) is zero, J₁(3.8317) is zero. So 1.8412 is the first zero of J₁? No, no, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, J₀(x) has its first zero at x≈2.4048, and J₁(x) has its first zero at x≈3.8317. So the first maximum of J₁(x) must be somewhere before 3.8317. Wait, J₁(x) starts at 0.5x (when x is small), then increases, reaches a maximum, then decreases to zero at x≈3.8317.

So the first maximum of J₁(x) occurs at x≈1.8412? Wait, no, perhaps x≈1.8412 is the first maximum of J₁(x). Let me think, I think that's correct. So the maximum of J₁(x) occurs at x≈1.8412. So when x=1.8412, J₁(x) is maximum. But wait, in our case, the function is (J₁(x)/x)^2. So the maximum of this function occurs where its derivative is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the maxima of (J₁(x)/x) occur at the same x where J₁(x) has its maxima. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first secondary maximum occurs at x≈5.1356, but that's beyond the first minimum, which is at x≈3.8317. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should just remember the value. I think the first secondary maximum has a ratio I/I₀ of approximately 0.017, but that's way too low. No, wait, that's the intensity at the first minimum, but the minima are zero. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the intensity at the first secondary maximum. Let me think. The central maximum is I₀, and the first secondary maximum is lower. I remember that the first secondary maximum has an intensity of about 0.0175 I₀, but that seems way too small. No, wait, that's the value for something else. Wait, no, wait, I think I might be getting confused with the intensity in the double-slit pattern, which is different.

Wait, no, for the Airy pattern, the first secondary maximum is about 0.0175 times I₀. But wait, in the options given, the smallest is 0.125 (option D) and the options are all around 0.1 to 0.235. So 0.0175 isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the maxima. Let me think again. The formula is I = I₀ [J₁(x)/x]^2. So the central maximum is when x=0, and J₁(0) is 0.5, so [J₁(0)/0]^2 approaches 0.25 I₀, but wait, that's not possible because the central maximum should be the highest. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me clarify.

Wait, the correct formula for the intensity in the Fraunhofer diffraction of a circular aperture is I = I₀ [J₁(x)/(x)]^2, where x = (2π a sinθ)/λ, and a is the radius of the aperture. The central maximum occurs at x=0, so plugging x=0, J₁(0) is 0.5. Wait, so J₁(0) = 0.5, so [J₁(0)/0]^2 is undefined. But we can compute the limit as x approaches 0. Using L’Hospital’s Rule: lim x→0 [J₁(x)/x] = lim [ (d/dx J₁(x)) / 1 ] = J₁’(0). What's J₁’(x) at x=0? The derivative of J₁(x) at 0 is 0.5. Because J₁(x) ≈ (x/2) - (x^3)/(16) + ... So J₁’(x) ≈ 1/2 - (3x^2)/(16). At x=0, J₁’(0) = 1/2. So [J₁(x)/x] as x approaches 0 approaches 1/2. So [1/2]^2 = 1/4. So I(0) = (I₀) * (1/4). Wait, that can't be right because the central maximum should be the brightest point. So I think I must have the normalization wrong. Maybe I₀ is actually the intensity at the center, which would be (1/4) I_total, and the total intensity integrated over all angles is I_total. Hmm, perhaps the way the formula is written, I₀ is a scaling factor, but the maximum intensity is when x=0, which would be I₀*(1/4), but that doesn't make sense because the maxima should be higher than the surrounding. Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Another approach: The central intensity is I₀, and the secondary maxima are fractions of that. So perhaps I₀ is the intensity at the center. Then the formula would be I = I₀ [J₁(x)/x]^2 / [J₁(0)/0]^2. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as I/I₀ = [J₁(x)/x]^2, where I₀ is the intensity at the center.

Wait, I think I need to get this straight. The Airy pattern's central disk intensity is given by [J₁(x)/x]^2. At x=0, as x approaches 0, [J₁(x)/x] approaches 0.5, so [0.5]^2 = 0.25. So the central intensity is 0.25 I₀? That doesn't make sense because the central maximum should be the brightest point. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the normalization wrong. Maybe I₀ is the total intensity, and the central maximum is a fraction of that. Alternatively, perhaps I₀ is the intensity at the center, and elsewhere it's lower. So I/I₀ would be the ratio relative to the central maximum.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the value of x where the first secondary maximum occurs, then compute [J₁(x)/x]^2 at that x, and that gives I/I₀.

I think the first secondary maximum occurs at x ≈ 1.8412. Wait, no, that's the first zero of J₁(x) divided by x? Or perhaps that's where J₁(x) has its maximum. Let me try to find the correct x value.

Alternatively, perhaps the first secondary maximum occurs at x ≈ 5.1356, which is the second zero of J₁(x). No, wait, the first zero is at 3.8317, and the second is at 7.0156. Wait, so if the first minimum is at 3.8317, then the first secondary maximum would be somewhere before that, maybe around x ≈ 1.8412. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the first secondary maximum for the Airy pattern occurs at an x value of approximately 1.8412 times π. Wait, that would be about 5.79, which is beyond the first minimum. That doesn't make sense because the first maximum after the central one should be before the first minimum.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think of the graph of the Airy pattern. The central maximum is at x=0. Then the first minimum is at x≈3.8317. The first secondary maximum occurs before that, at x≈1.8412. Yes, that sounds right. So x=1.8412.

So then, to find I/I₀, we compute [J₁(x)/x]^2 at x=1.8412.

I need to find the value of J₁(1.8412) divided by 1.8412, then square it.

I remember that J₁(x) has its first maximum at x≈1.8412. So at that point, J₁(x) is maximum. So J₁(1.8412) would be the maximum value of J₁(x), which I think is approximately 0.5816.

Wait, let me double-check: The maximum of J₁(x) occurs at x ≈ 1.8412, and J₁(1.8412) ≈ 0.5816.

So J₁(1.8412) ≈ 0.5816. Then J₁(x)/x is 0.5816 / 1.8412 ≈ 0.3156.

Then squaring that gives (0.3156)^2 ≈ 0.0995, which is about 0.1. But looking at the options, the closest would be D: 0.125, but 0.1 isn't an option. Hmm, maybe my approximation is off.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me think: the exact value of J₁(1.8412) is about 0.5816. So 0.5816 / 1.8412 = let's compute that. 0.5816 divided by 1.8412.

Let me calculate: 1.8412 ÷ 0.5816 ≈ 3.166. So 0.5816 / 1.8412 ≈ 1/3.166 ≈ 0.3157.

Squaring that gives approximately (0.3157)^2 ≈ 0.0997, which is about 0.1. None of the options is exactly 0.1, but looking at the options, D is 0.125. That's higher than 0.1, so maybe my approximation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the actual maximum is lower. Maybe I should look for a more precise calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the first secondary maximum with another point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should find the derivative of [J₁(x)/x]^2 and set it to zero to find the maxima. The derivative would be 2 [J₁(x)/x] [ (J₁'(x) x - J₁(x)) / x² ].

Setting this equal to zero gives J₁'(x) x - J₁(x) =0 → J₁'(x) x = J₁(x).

So we need to solve for x where x J₁'(x) = J₁(x).

I don't remember the exact solution, but I think the first solution after x=0 is around x≈3.054. Wait, no, that's where the derivative of J₁(x) is zero. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the first maximum of [J₁(x)/x]^2 occurs at x≈1.8412, but the actual calculation comes out to about 0.315 squared, which is 0.099, so 0.1. But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm wrong about the x value.

Alternatively, perhaps the first maximum is at x≈3.054, but that's the second zero of J₀(x). Wait, J₀(x) has its first zero at 2.4048, and the first maximum at x≈3.054. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up J₀ and J₁.

Wait, maybe I should look for the first maximum of J₁(x)/x. Let me think: J₁(x)/x. At x=0, it's 0.5. As x increases, it goes up to a maximum, then decreases, passing through zero at x=3.8317.

So the maximum of J₁(x)/x occurs at some point before 3.8317. Let's say it's at x=1.8412, which is where J₁(x) has its maximum. So then J₁(x)/x at x=1.8412 would be maximum. But when I calculated that, it gave 0.315, which squared is 0.0997.

But the options don't have 0.1. The closest is D:0.125, but that's 25% higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of J₁(1.8412). Let me think again. Maybe J₁(1.8412) is higher than 0.5816. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator or some approximation. Let me think: Bessel functions can be approximated, but I'm not sure of the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the first secondary maximum in the Airy pattern has an intensity of about 0.0175 times the central maximum. Wait, that's much lower. But that can't be right because the options are all higher than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture with that of a single slit or double slit. For a single slit, the first secondary maximum is at about 1.43 times the wavelength, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The first secondary maximum of the Airy pattern occurs at x≈1.8412, and the intensity there is about (J₁(1.8412)/(1.8412))². Let me compute J₁(1.8412) more accurately.

I remember that J₁(1.8412) is approximately 0.5816, as I thought before. So 0.5816 divided by 1.8412 is roughly 0.5816 / 1.8412 ≈ 0.3157
