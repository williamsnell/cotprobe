The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An 18-year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration
B: Immediate cesarean section
C: Hormone therapy to balance MSAFP levels
D: Monitor patient without taking action
E: Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations
F: Administer a pregnancy test
G: Prescribe oral contraceptives
H: Ultrasonography
I: Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration
J: Conduct a pelvic exam

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about prenatal care, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the patient is an 18-year-old primigravid woman. That means she's pregnant for the first time. She comes in for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks of gestation. Wait, that seems a bit late for the first visit, right? I think most initial visits happen earlier, like around 8-12 weeks. But maybe she wasn't sure about her dates or something.

She's unsure about the date of her last menstrual period (LMP). That's a bit tricky because calculating gestational age usually relies on the LMP. She thinks the pregnancy probably occurred right after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Hmm, okay. So she stopped the pill and got pregnant around then. But she's not certain of her LMP date, which complicates things for determining the exact gestational age.

Her MSAFP (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median (MoM). I remember that MSAFP is a screening test for certain fetal abnormalities, like neural tube defects or abdominal wall defects. Elevated levels can indicate a higher risk, but they're not diagnostic on their own.

So the question is asking, what's the next step in management? The options are A to J.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration. Well, amniocentesis is an invasive test that can measure amniotic fluid AFP, but it's usually done after an abnormal screening test. But wait, MSAFP is just a screening, so a high level would prompt further testing. But amniocentesis is more about genetic testing (like for chromosomal abnormalities) and can also measure AFP, but is that the immediate next step? Maybe, but maybe not the first thing.

Option B: Immediate cesarean section. That doesn't make sense. There's no indication for delivering the baby right now; she's at 16 weeks, which is too early, and there's no immediate threat mentioned.

Option C: Hormone therapy to balance MSAFP levels. I don't think MSAFP levels are treated with hormones. That doesn't seem right. MSAFP is a screening tool, not something you can treat with hormones.

Option D: Monitor without action. Maybe not the best approach. Elevated MSAFP suggests the need for further evaluation, so just monitoring might not be appropriate.

Option E: Triple screening for MSAFP, β-hCG, and estriol. Wait, the triple screen typically includes these three: MSAFP, β-hCG, and estriol. But in this case, the MSAFP is already elevated. So maybe the next step is to do the full triple screen to get more information. But wait, the triple screen is usually done between 15-22 weeks, so maybe she's in that window. But she already has an MSAFP result, so perhaps they might proceed to other tests.

Option F: Administer a pregnancy test. She's already pregnant and 16 weeks along, so that's unnecessary.

Option G: Prescribe oral contraceptives. She's pregnant, so that doesn't make sense. Plus, she stopped them 5 months ago.

Option H: Ultrasonography. Oh, right. Ultrasound can help in multiple ways here. First, confirming the gestational age because she's unsure of her LMP. Knowing the exact gestational age is crucial because MSAFP levels are interpreted based on the gestational age. Also, ultrasound can check for multiple pregnancies, which can cause elevated MSAFP, or signs of fetal abnormalities that might explain the high levels.

Option I: Repeat MSAFP measurement. Maybe, but usually, if the level is high, they proceed to further testing rather than repeating. Although, sometimes a repeat is done to confirm if it's a lab error, but I think the first step is more about confirming the gestational age.

Option J: Conduct a pelvic exam. Not sure how that would help in this context. Pelvic exams are routine, but this is about the elevated MSAFP.

Putting this together: The MSAFP is high, so the next step should be to do an ultrasound. The ultrasound can confirm the gestational age (since her dates are uncertain), check for multiple pregnancies, and look for any fetal anomalies that might explain the elevated AFP. Additionally, if there's any doubt about the gestational age, the ultrasound can provide a more accurate estimate, which is important because MSAFP levels are interpreted based on gestational age.

So the options are between E, H, and maybe I. Wait, does the triple screen include more than just MSAFP? The triple screen is MSAFP, β-hCG, and estriol. So if she's already had the MSAFP, maybe doing the triple screen could provide more information. But I think the immediate next step is to get an ultrasound to assess the pregnancy, confirm dates, and look for possible causes of elevated MSAFP.

So the answer would be H: Ultrasonography.

The patient is an 18-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation with an uncertain last menstrual period (LMP) and an elevated maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration of 3 multiples of the median (MoM). Elevated MSAFP is a screening test that suggests an increased risk of fetal abnormalities, such as neural tube defects or abdominal wall defects, but it is not diagnostic. The next step should focus on further evaluation to determine the cause of the elevated MSAFP and confirm gestational age.

- **Option A (Amniocentesis)**: While amniocentesis can measure amniotic fluid AFP and assess for genetic abnormalities, it is an invasive procedure typically performed after initial non-invasive evaluations, such as ultrasound, to confirm gestational age and rule out other causes of elevated MSAFP.
- **Option B (Immediate cesarean section)**: This is not appropriate, as there is no indication for immediate delivery at 16 weeks.
- **Option C (Hormone therapy)**: MSAFP levels are not treated with hormone therapy, as this is a screening test rather than a condition requiring treatment.
- **Option D (Monitor without action)**: Elevated MSAFP requires further investigation, so passive monitoring is not appropriate.
- **Option E (Triple screening)**: The triple screen includes MSAFP, β-hCG, and estriol. While this could provide additional information, the immediate next step should focus on confirming gestational age and evaluating fetal anatomy.
- **Option F (Pregnancy test)**: The patient is already confirmed pregnant, making this unnecessary.
- **Option G (Prescribe oral contraceptives)**: This is inappropriate, as the patient is pregnant and has already stopped oral contraceptives.
- **Option H (Ultrasonography)**: Ultrasound is the most appropriate next step. It can confirm gestational age, assess for multiple pregnancies, and evaluate fetal anatomy for potential abnormalities that could explain the elevated MSAFP.
- **Option I (Repeat MSAFP measurement)**: While repeating the test might confirm the result, it does not address the need to investigate the cause of the elevation.
- **Option J (Pelvic exam)**: A pelvic exam is not relevant to the evaluation of elevated MSAFP.

The best next step is ultrasonography to confirm gestational age, assess for potential causes of elevated MSAFP, and evaluate fetal anatomy.
