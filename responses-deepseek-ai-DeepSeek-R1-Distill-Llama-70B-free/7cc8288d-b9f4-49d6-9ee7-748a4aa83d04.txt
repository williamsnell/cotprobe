Okay, so I've got this problem about a pulley and a belt, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the problem again carefully.

The pulley is 15 inches in diameter and rotates at 1200 rpm. It transmits 15 horsepower. There's a 1/4 inch thick single leather belt used. I need to calculate the width of the belt given that the ratio of tensions on the tight to slack side is 2:1, and the design stress is 200 psi.

Hmm, I remember that in belt drives, the power transmitted depends on the difference in tensions between the tight and slack sides. Oh right, the formula is Power (P) = (T_tight - T_slack) * v, where v is the belt speed. And belt speed can be calculated from the pulley's diameter and rpm.

Wait, the diameter is 15 inches, so the radius is 7.5 inches. To find the belt speed, the formula is v = π * D * N / 60. Let me compute that. D is 15 inches, N is 1200 rpm.

So v = π * 15 * 1200 / 60. Let me compute step by step. 15 * 1200 is 18,000, divided by 60 is 300. So v = π * 300. Approximately 3.1416 * 300 ≈ 942.48 inches per minute. Wait, but power is usually in horsepower, and the units need to match up. Oh wait, maybe I should convert the velocity into feet per minute because horsepower uses foot units.

Wait, 1 inch is 1/12 foot, so 942.48 inches per minute is 942.48 / 12 = about 78.54 feet per minute.

Now, Power is 15 hp. The formula is P = (T1 - T2) * v, where T1 is tight side tension, T2 slack. So 15 hp = (T1 - T2) * 78.54 ft/min.

But wait, I think the correct formula might involve converting horsepower into foot-pounds per minute. Because 1 hp is 550 ft-lbf per second, but since our velocity is in feet per minute, maybe I should adjust that.

Wait, let's think again. The correct formula for power is P = (T1 - T2) * v, but P needs to be in the same units as the product (T1-T2)*v. Since T is in pounds (force), and v is in feet per minute, then the units would be lb-ft per minute. But 1 hp is 550 lb-ft per second. So I need to convert 15 hp to lb-ft per minute.

So 15 hp = 15 * 550 lb-ft/s = 8250 lb-ft/s. Then convert seconds to minutes: 8250 lb-ft/s * 60 s/min = 495,000 lb-ft/min.

So now, P = 495,000 lb-ft/min = (T1 - T2) * v.

Wait, but v was in ft/min. Wait, no, in the formula, v is in ft/min, but the units when multiplied by (T1-T2) in lb would give lb-ft/min. So setting 495,000 = (T1-T2) * 78.54.

Wait, let me compute that. So 78.54 is in ft/min. So, (T1-T2) = 495,000 / 78.54 ≈ let's see, 495000 / 78.54 ≈ approximately 6300 lb.

Wait, that seems high, but perhaps that's correct. Now, the ratio of T1 to T2 is 2:1. So T1 = 2*T2. Let me call T2 as x. Then T1 = 2x. So T1 - T2 = x. So x = 6300 lb.

So T2 is 6300 lb, and T1 is 12,600 lb.

Wait, but I'm not sure I did that right. Let me check the steps again. The power equation: P = (T1 - T2)*v. v is in feet per minute. So 15 hp = (T1-T2) * v, but wait, I might have messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, another approach: Sometimes, power is calculated as (T1 - T2) * v, where v is in feet per minute, and the power comes out in lb-ft per minute. But since 1 hp = 550 lb-ft/s, which is 33,000 lb-ft per minute (since 550 *60=33,000). So 15 hp would be 15 * 33,000 = 495,000 lb-ft/min.

So, (T1 - T2) * v = 495,000 lb-ft/min. We have v as 78.54 ft/min. So (T1-T2)=495,000 /78.54 ≈ 6300 lb. So that's correct.

Now, with T1 = 2*T2, so T1 - T2 = T2 =6300 lb. So T2 =6300 lb, T1=12,600 lb.

Now, I need to find the width of the belt. The belt is made of leather, 1/4 inch thick. The design stress is 200 psi. Stress is force per unit area, so the tension would be stress multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the belt.

The cross-sectional area would be the width (w) times the thickness (t=0.25 in). So area A = w * t.

The tension in the belt on each side is T = stress * A. But wait, each side of the belt (tight and slack) has a different tension. So I think each side's tension is calculated using the same area, but the stress might be the same? Wait, but the stress is given as the design stress, which I think refers to the allowable stress.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something. The maximum tension the belt can handle without exceeding the design stress would be T_max = stress * A. But in this case, both T1 and T2 are within the belt's capacity, but the belt's width determines the maximum possible T, which would be when the belt is under the highest tension, which is T1.

So the belt's maximum allowable tension is T_max = 200 psi * (w * 0.25 in). But in our case, T1 is 12,600 lb, so T1 must be equal to T_max.

So 12,600 lb = 200 psi * (w * 0.25 in)

Wait, let me write it as:

T1 = stress * (width * thickness)

So 12,600 = 200 * (w * 0.25)

Let me compute the right side: 200 * 0.25 =50. So 12,600 =50 * w.

So w=12,600 /50 = 252 inches? Wait, that can't be right. 252 inches is way too big, over 21 feet. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the units. Because 200 psi is pounds per square inch. So the area must be in square inches.

So the area A is w (in inches) multiplied by t (in inches). So A = w * t.

So T1 = 200 * (w * 0.25). So 200*(w*0.25) = 50w.

So T1=50w.

But we have T1=12,600 lb.

So 50w=12,600 → w=12,600/50=252 inches. That's impossible because the pulley is only 15 inches in diameter. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the stress is the difference in tensions over the area. No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the stress is related to the average tension or something else.

Wait, another approach. The belt's tension on the tight side is T1, so the stress (sigma) is T1 divided by the cross-sectional area. So sigma = T1/(A) = T1/(w * t).

But the design stress is given as 200 psi, so sigma must be ≤200 psi. Therefore, T1/(w * t) =200 psi.

So, T1=200 * w * t.

Plugging in T1=12,600 lb, t=0.25 inches.

So 12,600 =200 * w *0.25 → 12,600=50 w → w=252 inches.

Again, that can't be right. So I must be making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the stress is based on the tight side tension. Or maybe I'm confusing the stress formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is that the total tension in the belt is the sum of both sides? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the belt's tension varies between T1 and T2, but the cross-sectional area is the same everywhere. So each point in the belt is under either T1 or T2, but the area is the same.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the belt's maximum allowable tension. The maximum tension the belt can handle is when it's on the tight side, T1. So T1 can't exceed the stress multiplied by the area.

So T1 = stress * (width * thickness).

But that's what I did, leading to w=252 in, which is way too big. So I must have made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the tensions T1 and T2.

Let me go back. The power is 15 hp.

First, I calculated the belt speed v as 78.54 ft/min.

Then, using P = (T1-T2)*v, so (T1-T2)=P/(v).

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the units when converting power.

Wait, let's try another approach. The correct formula for power transmitted by a belt is:

P (hp) = (T1 - T2) * v (in ft/min) / (550 ft-lbf/sec * 60 sec/min) )

Wait, no. Let me think: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/sec = 33,000 ft-lbf/min.

So, P (in hp) = (T1 - T2) * v (ft/min) / 33,000.

So rearranging, (T1 - T2) = (P * 33,000) / v.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. P=15 hp, v=78.54 ft/min.

So (T1-T2)= (15 *33000) /78.54 → 15*33000=495,000.

So 495,000 /78.54 ≈ 6300 lb.

So that part is correct. So T1-T2=6300 lb.

Given the ratio T1/T2=2/1, so T1=2*T2. Thus, T1-T2=T2=6300 lb → T2=6300, T1=12600 lb.

So back to the stress equation. Stress is T1/(A), where A is cross-sectional area.

Stress = 200 psi = T1/(w * t).

So 200 = 12600/(w * 0.25).

Wait, solving for w:

w = 12600 / (200 *0.25) → 12600/(50) = 252 inches.

This can't be right. The pulley is only 15 inches in diameter, so a 252-inch belt is impossible. So I must be making a wrong assumption.

Wait a minute, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the belt is a loop around the pulley, and the cross-sectional area is per side. Or maybe I'm miscalculating the area.

Wait, the belt's cross-section is a rectangle of width w and thickness t. So area is w * t. So T1 = stress * (w * t).

But in this case, T1 is 12,600 lb, which would require a huge width.

Alternatively, perhaps the stress is the average stress, and the actual stress varies, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the design stress with the allowable stress for the belt material. Maybe the stress is calculated as the average of T1 and T2 over the area.

Wait, perhaps the stress is based on the average tension. So average tension T_avg = (T1 + T2)/2. So T_avg = (12600 +6300)/2=9450 lb.

Then, stress is T_avg / (w * t) =200 psi.

So 9450/(w * 0.25)=200 → 9450=50 w → w=189 inches. Still way too big.

Hmm, that's even worse. So that approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the belt's thickness is 1/4 inch, so that adds to the area. So the area is w * t, but maybe I should consider that the belt's thickness contributes to the area. But I did that already.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the initial power calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the diameter is 15 inches, so the circumference is π*D = π*15 ≈47.12 inches. The speed is 1200 rpm, so the belt speed in inches per minute is 47.12 * 1200 ≈56,544 in/min.

Wait, wait, earlier I converted inches per minute to feet per minute by dividing by 12, getting 4,712 in/min → 4,712/12≈392.7 ft/min. Wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the initial calculation of belt speed.

Wait, wait, let me compute the belt speed correctly. The pulley's diameter is 15 inches. The circumference is π*diameter, so π*15 ≈47.12 inches. The pulley rotates at 1200 rpm, so each revolution, the belt moves 47.12 inches. So in one minute, at 1200 rpm, the belt moves 1200 *47.12 inches per minute.

1200 *47.12 = 56,544 inches per minute.

Convert to feet per minute: 56,544 inches / 12 =4,712 feet per minute.

Ah, so earlier calculation was wrong. I thought v was 78.54 ft/min, but the correct v is 4,712 ft/min.

That's a big mistake. So let me redo the power equation.

Power P = (T1 - T2) * v → rearranged (T1-T2) = P / v.

Wait, but P is in horsepower, which needs to be converted to ft-lbf/min.

So 15 hp =15 * 550 ft-lbf/sec =8250 ft-lbf/sec.

Convert that to ft-lbf/min: 8250 *60=495,000 ft-lbf/min.

So (T1-T2)=495,000 / (v in ft/min).

v is 4,712 ft/min.

So (T1-T2)=495,000 /4712 ≈ let's compute that.

Well, 4712 × 100 = 471,200. 4712 × 105=4712*100 +4712*5=471200 +23560=494,760. That's very close to 495,000. So approximately 105 lb.

So (T1-T2)≈105 lb.

Wait, that makes much more sense. Earlier I had 6300 lb due to a calculation error in the belt speed.

So, now, T1-T2=105 lb.

Given ratio T1=2*T2, so T1=2T2.

Then, T1 - T2 = T2 =105 lb → T2=105 lb, T1=210 lb.

Now, the stress on the tight side is T1/(A), where A is area of the belt's cross-section.

Stress = T1/(w * t) =200 psi.

So, 200 =210/(w * 0.25).

Solving for w:

w =210/(200 *0.25) =210/(50)=4.2 inches.

So the width is 4.2 inches. Looking at the options, option H is 4.2 in.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the belt speed. The pulley's diameter is 15 inches, so its circumference is:

\[
\text{Circumference} = \pi \cdot \text{Diameter} = \pi \cdot 15 \approx 47.12 \, \text{inches}.
\]

At 1200 rpm, the belt speed in inches per minute is:

\[
v = 1200 \cdot 47.12 = 56,544 \, \text{inches per minute}.
\]

Converting to feet per minute:

\[
v = \frac{56,544}{12} = 4,712 \, \text{ft/min}.
\]

Next, we calculate the power transmitted by the belt. The power is given as 15 hp, which is converted to ft-lbf/min:

\[
1 \, \text{hp} = 550 \, \text{ft-lbf/sec}, \quad 15 \, \text{hp} = 15 \cdot 550 = 8,250 \, \text{ft-lbf/sec}.
\]

\[
\text{Power in ft-lbf/min} = 8,250 \cdot 60 = 495,000 \, \text{ft-lbf/min}.
\]

The power equation is:

\[
P = (T_1 - T_2) \cdot v,
\]

where \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are the tensions on the tight and slack sides, respectively. Rearranging for \(T_1 - T_2\):

\[
T_1 - T_2 = \frac{P}{v} = \frac{495,000}{4,712} \approx 105 \, \text{lb}.
\]

Given the ratio \(T_1 : T_2 = 2 : 1\), we let \(T_2 = x\) and \(T_1 = 2x\). Substituting into \(T_1 - T_2 = 105\):

\[
2x - x = 105 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 105 \, \text{lb}.
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 = 105 \, \text{lb}, \quad T_1 = 2 \cdot 105 = 210 \, \text{lb}.
\]

The belt's cross-sectional area is determined by its width \(w\) and thickness \(t = 0.25 \, \text{in}\). The stress on the tight side is given by:

\[
\text{Stress} = \frac{T_1}{A} = \frac{T_1}{w \cdot t}.
\]
