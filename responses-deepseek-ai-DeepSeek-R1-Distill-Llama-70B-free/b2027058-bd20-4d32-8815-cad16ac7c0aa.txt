Okay, so I've got this psychology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a psychologist who tells parents to use appropriate consequences when dealing with their children's misbehavior. Also, the psychologist mentions that the goals of misbehavior can be to confirm an assumed disability, get attention, power, or revenge. I need to figure out which theoretical orientation this is from the options given.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on all the theories, but let's try to break it down. The key points here are consequences for misbehavior and the goals of misbehavior being things like attention or power.

First, I remember that behavioral theories often focus on consequences as a way to modify behavior. Like, operant conditioning uses positive and negative reinforcement. So maybe that's part of it. But then, the part about the goals of misbehavior—like attention, power, etc.—that sounds familiar too. I think that's more related to something else.

Wait, I think that's from Adlerian theory. Adler talked about the reasons behind children's misbehavior. He suggested that children misbehave for specific goals, such as seeking attention, getting power, or exacting revenge. So the goals are about meeting their needs or overcoming feelings of inadequacy.

Let me think about the options. Option A is Adlerian. That fits because Adlerian therapy does focus on understanding the underlying goals of behavior. Also, using consequences might align with that approach since it's about encouraging responsibility and appropriate behavior.

But wait, what about cognitive-behavioral? They do focus on consequences too, but I think they're more about changing thoughts and behaviors through cognitive restructuring. The part about the goals of misbehavior doesn't ring a bell as much with CBT.

Another thought: Transactional Analysis (TA). I remember TA talks about ego states and transactions between parent and child. It includes concepts like the "games" people play, which could relate to misbehavior as a way to get certain responses. So maybe that's a possibility. But I'm not sure if TA specifically lists those goals like attention or power.

Also, let me consider the options. The question mentions the goal of misbehavior can be to confirm an assumed disability. Adlerian theory does talk about inferiority and striving for superiority. So children might act out to confirm a disability they think they have, which is part of their striving to overcome feelings of inadequacy.

So putting it together, the focus on goals like attention, power, revenge, and confirming a disability points towards Adlerian. And the use of consequences as a method probably fits within that framework as well.

Wait, but I thought behavioral theories (option I) focus on external consequences. So if the psychologist is using consequences, maybe it's behavioral. But the part about the goals of misbehavior—like attention—sounds more like Adlerian. Because behavioral theories are more about the external rewards and punishments, not so much the underlying psychological goals.

So the answer is probably Adlerian, which is option A.

The psychologist's emphasis on using appropriate consequences and understanding the goals of misbehavior, such as seeking attention, power, revenge, or confirming an assumed disability, aligns with Adlerian theory. Adlerian psychology focuses on the underlying reasons for behavior, including these specific goals, and encourages responsibility and appropriate behavior through methods like consequences.

A: Adlerian
