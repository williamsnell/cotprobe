Question:

Devise an experiment which would distinguish between Decay and Interference theories of forgetting. What results would have to be obtained to support the Decay theory? To support the Interference theory?

Options:

A: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly more than the control group, indicating that time strengthens memories. Interference Theory is supported if recall is unaffected by additional learning tasks.
B: Interference Theory is supported if the control group recalls more than the experimental group when a competing task is introduced immediately after learning, indicating that immediate interference affects recall.
C: Interference Theory is supported if both groups recall the same amount from learning task A
D: Decay Theory is supported if the recall is unaffected over time, while Interference Theory is supported if recall decreases with the introduction of a competing task shortly after learning.
E: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group demonstrates improved recall with the introduction of a competing task, indicating that interference can actually enhance memory retention.
F: Decay Theory is supported if both groups recall the same amount from learning task A, proving that time fades memories. Interference Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly less than the control group, indicating interference from other memories
G: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly less than the control group
H: Decay Theory is supported if recall diminishes in the absence of any competing tasks over a long period, indicating that memories fade naturally over time. Interference Theory is supported if recall diminishes only when a competing task is introduced during the retention interval.
I: Both theories are supported if the control group recalls significantly less than the experimental group
J: Interference Theory is supported if both groups show improved recall over time, suggesting that memories consolidate rather than decay or interfere with each other.

Okay, so I've got this question about psychology theories of forgetting, specifically Decay Theory and Interference Theory. Hmm, I remember that these are two different explanations for why we forget things. Let me try to break this down.

The question is asking me to devise an experiment that can distinguish between these two theories. Then, I need to figure out what results would support each theory. 

First, I should probably recall what each theory says. Decay Theory suggests that memories fade over time if they aren't used or rehearsed. It's like, imagine you learn something new, and then don't think about it again. Over time, the memory just disappears because the neural connections weaken. 

Interference Theory, on the other hand, says that forgetting happens because other information interferes with the memory. So, if you learn something new (let's say task B) after learning something else (task A), the new information might interfere with your ability to recall task A. This could happen either because the new info pushes the old out or because it makes it harder to retrieve the old info.

So the experiment needs to test these two possibilities. How can I set up conditions where one theory is supported over the other?

Let me think about possible experimental designs. Maybe one where you have two groups. One group learns a task and then doesn't do anything else—just waits. The other group learns the same task but then does another task that might interfere. Or perhaps, the second group does something unrelated after learning.

Wait, but the key is to isolate whether time alone causes forgetting (Decay) or whether introducing new information (Interference) does. So maybe:

- Control Group: Learns task A, then waits for a period without any new tasks.
- Experimental Group: Learns task A, then immediately does task B, which is similar or different, depending on the design.

But wait, if I want to test Decay, I need to see if just time causes forgetting. So perhaps the control group waits without any new tasks, while the experimental group does some other activity. Alternatively, maybe the experimental group does a task that causes interference.

Wait, no. Actually, to test Decay, you want a condition where no interference occurs. So maybe the control group is just left alone after learning, and the experimental group is given an interfering task. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the control group does nothing after learning, while the experimental group is given additional tasks that might interfere. Then, if the experimental group remembers less, it supports Interference Theory. If the control group, which did nothing, still forgets, that would support Decay.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Decay is about the passage of time causing forgetting. So in the control group, if they just wait and forget, that supports Decay. But wait, no—because even in the control group, if they're just waiting, maybe other things in their environment cause interference. So how can you isolate Decay?

Hmm, maybe using a within-subjects design. Like, have all participants learn task A, and then after some time, test their recall. But that alone won't differentiate the theories because other variables could cause interference.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to manipulate whether the retention interval (the time between learning and recall) includes interference. So, for example:

- Group 1: Learn task A, then do nothing during the retention interval (just wait), then recall.
- Group 2: Learn task A, then perform a different task (task B) during the retention interval, then recall.

If Group 1 shows significant forgetting, Decay is supported. If Group 2 shows more forgetting than Group 1, then Interference is at play because the extra task caused more forgetting.

Alternatively, if the retention interval is long enough, maybe Decay would predict that even without interference, forgetting occurs. So if Group 1 forgets a lot, that supports Decay. But if Group 2, which had interference, forgets even more, that supports Interference as an additional factor.

Wait, but the question is about distinguishing between the two. So the design should aim to see which factor is causing the forgetting.

Let me think about the possible options given. The question provides options A through J, each describing different outcomes.

The correct experiment would vary whether there's an interfering task. So results supporting Decay would be if, without interference, recall decreases over time. Results supporting Interference would be if adding an interfering task leads to worse recall.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly pairs these outcomes.

Option H: Decay supported if recall diminishes without competing tasks over a long time. Interference supported if recall diminishes only when a competing task is introduced.

Yes, that makes sense. Because in the case where there's no interference, if forgetting happens, it's due to Decay. If forgetting happens more when there's interference, then it supports Interference Theory.

So, the experiment would have two groups. One group, after learning, does nothing (no interference) and waits a long time. The other group does an interfering task during the retention interval. If the first group forgets, Decay is supported. If the second group forgets more, Interference adds to it.

So the correct answer should be H.

To distinguish between Decay Theory and Interference Theory of forgetting, an experiment could involve two groups:

1. **Control Group**: Learns task A, then does nothing during the retention interval (no interference) before recall.
2. **Experimental Group**: Learns task A, then performs a competing task (interference) during the retention interval before recall.

- **Decay Theory** is supported if recall diminishes in the control group over time, indicating that memories fade naturally without interference.
- **Interference Theory** is supported if recall diminishes more in the experimental group when a competing task is introduced, showing that interference disrupts memory retention.

Among the options, **Option H** correctly captures this design and its implications:

**H**: Decay Theory is supported if recall diminishes in the absence of any competing tasks over a long period, indicating that memories fade naturally over time. Interference Theory is supported if recall diminishes only when a competing task is introduced during the retention interval.

Answer: H
