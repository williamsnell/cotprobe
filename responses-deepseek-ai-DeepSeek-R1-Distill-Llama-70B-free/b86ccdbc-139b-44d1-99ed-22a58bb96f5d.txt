Question:

An investor owned a four-story office building located in downtown. The building was old and badly in need of renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by

Options:

A: the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.
B: the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.
C: the friend, because the investor has no right to redeem after the deed absolute was executed.
D: the friend, if the friend can establish that the deed absolute was executed later in time.
E: the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.
F: the friend, because the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity.
G: the investor, because the friend refused to accept the $125,000 indebtedness.
H: the investor, if the investor can prove that the deed was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt.
I: the investor, because the deed absolute was not intended as an outright conveyance upon default.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about mortgages, deeds, and foreclosure. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

So, the scenario is an investor who owns a four-story office building. The building is old and needs renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrows $125,000 from a friend. As consideration, the investor signs a promissory note for $125k payable in a year, and secures it with a mortgage on the building. The mortgage is dated January 1 and recorded on January 2. 

Then, on February 1, the investor executes a deed absolute, naming the friend as the grantee. Wait, a deed absolute is usually a complete transfer, but here it's intended only as additional security. So, it's like a mortgage, not an outright sale. 

To make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and eliminate the right to redeem, the investor delivers this deed to his nephew in escrow. The instructions are to give the deed to the friend if the investor fails to pay the note at maturity. So, on January 1 of the next year, the investor doesn't pay, so the nephew gives the deed to the friend, who records it two weeks later. 

Then, two weeks after that, the investor offers the $125k, but the friend refuses. The investor sues to set aside the deed and redeem the property, while the friend counters that the deed was an outright conveyance upon default. 

The question is, who will the court rule in favor of?

I remember that mortgages typically give the borrower the right to redeem the property after default by paying the debt. But here, there's a deed absolute involved. I think a deed absolute can sometimes be used as a mortgage if the intent is for it to be security. But in this case, the investor tried to structure it so that there's no right to redeem, using an escrow arrangement.

Wait, so the deed was given in escrow with instructions to deliver upon default. That sounds like a mortgage with a power of sale. But if the deed is absolute, does that mean the friend becomes the outright owner upon default, without the need for foreclosure? 

I think the key here is the intent behind the deed. If the deed was intended as a mortgage (security), then the borrower should have the right to redeem. But if it's an outright conveyance upon default, then the friend owns it, and the investor can't redeem. 

In the scenario, the deed was intended as additional security, so it's more like a mortgage. So, even though it's a deed absolute in form, the substance is a mortgage. Therefore, the investor should have the right to redeem by paying the debt, even after the deed was delivered.

Also, the fact that the debt was tendered within a reasonable time (two weeks after the deed was delivered) might matter. The friend refused the payment, which suggests they're trying to keep the property, but legally, if it's a mortgage, the investor can still pay off the debt and get the property back.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H says the investor if he can prove the deed was intended as security. Option I says the investor because the deed wasn't intended as outright conveyance. Option E says the investor because the deed didn't extinguish redemption right.

Wait, but if the deed was delivered and recorded, does that change things? Well, if it's a mortgage in disguise, the right to redeem should still exist unless state law says otherwise. Some states have laws about mortgages being in the form of a deed with a license to redeem, but in this case, the investor tried to eliminate redemption by using an escrow arrangement. 

But courts typically look at the substance over the form. So even if the parties tried to structure it as an outright transfer upon default, if it's security, it's a mortgage, and the right to redeem exists. 

So the investor should win because the deed was intended as security, which means it's a mortgage, and he can redeem by paying the debt. 

Looking at the options, E says the investor because the deed didn't extinguish his right of redemption. H says investor if he can prove it was additional security. I think H is also a possibility, but E seems broader. Because if the deed was intended as security, the right to redeem exists regardless of whether the friend accepted the payment later.

Wait, but in this case, the friend recorded the deed after the default. So does that mean the property is now the friend's? But if it's a mortgage, the recording of the deed would just perfect the security interest, not transfer ownership outright. So the investor still has the right to redeem.

So the correct answer would be either E or H or I. Let me think again. 

Option I says the investor because the deed wasn't intended as outright conveyance upon default. That's probably correct because the intent was security. So the court would look at the intent and find that it's a mortgage, granting the right to redeem.

So the judgment should go in favor of the investor, allowing redemption. 

Looking at the options:

E: investor, because deed didn't extinguish right of redemption.

H: investor, if he can prove deed was intended as security.

I: investor, because deed wasn't intended as outright conveyance.

Wait, the question is about whether the court will grant the relief sought by the investor. The investor wants to set aside the deed and redeem. If the deed was intended as security, then yes. So the court should allow that. 

So the correct answer is either E, H, or I. 

But which one? Let me think about the options again. 

Option H says the investor can get relief if he proves the deed was intended as additional security. That seems to match the scenario because the deed was supposed to be security. 

Option E says the investor wins because the deed didn't extinguish the right of redemption. But does a deed absolute as security automatically extinguish the right? No, because it's a mortgage, so the right exists.

Option I says the investor wins because the deed wasn't intended as outright conveyance. That's also correct because the intent was security. 

Wait, perhaps the key is that the deed absolute was intended as a mortgage, so the right of redemption exists. So H and I are both possible. 

But looking at the answer choices, H and I are similar but worded differently. 

Hmm, the question is about what the court should decide. The investor's argument is that the deed was intended as security, so it's a mortgage, and he has the right to redeem. The friend says it's an outright conveyance. 

So the court will look at the intent. If the intent was security, then it's a mortgage, and the right to redeem exists. So the investor's argument would prevail if he can show that intent. 

So the correct answer would be H: the investor, if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security.

Wait, but another thought: in some jurisdictions, a deed absolute given as security with a right to redeem is treated as a mortgage, regardless of the form. So the court would enforce it as a mortgage, giving the right to redeem. So the investor can redeem by paying the debt, even after the deed is delivered. 

So the friend's argument that it's an outright conveyance wouldn't hold because the intent was security. Therefore, the investor can still pay the debt and get the property back, so the court should grant the investor's relief.

So the correct answer should be E or H or I. 

Wait, but option E says the investor because the deed absolute didn't extinguish the right of redemption. That's correct because the right comes from the mortgage, and the deed as a mortgage allows redemption. 

But I'm a bit confused between E and H. 

Option E is a statement of the result without considering the intent, whereas H is conditional on proving intent.

Wait, the question is about what the court should grant. The investor's case hinges on proving that the deed was intended as security. So the judgment would be for the investor if he can prove that the deed was meant as security. 

So the answer would be H.

Alternatively, if the court automatically treats a deed absolute as a mortgage when used as security, then E would be correct. But I think the court would look at the intent, so H is the right choice.

Wait, but another angle: when the investor delivered the deed in escrow, with instructions to deliver upon default, that's similar to a mortgage with a power of sale. But in some states, such an arrangement is treated as a mortgage, giving the borrower the right to redeem even after the sale. 

So regardless of the form, the substance is a mortgage, so the right to redeem exists. 

Therefore, the court would rule for the investor, so the answer is E because the deed didn't extinguish the right of redemption. 

Wait, but the key point is that the investor tried to make it so that there's no right to redeem. But legally, if it's a mortgage, that right exists unless the mortgage explicitly waives it, which may not be enforceable. 

So the court would see the deed as a mortgage, and the right to redeem exists. So the investor can redeem by paying the debt. 

So the answer is E: the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option E: investor, because deed absolute did not extinguish right of redemption.

Option H: investor, if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security.

Which is correct? Well, the court would need to determine whether the deed was intended as a mortgage or an outright transfer. If it's a mortgage, then yes, redemption is possible. So the investor needs to prove that intent.

Therefore, the correct answer is H: the investor, if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security.

But wait, in the scenario, the deed was intended as additional security, so the investor can prove that. So the court would rule for him, making H the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the court treats the deed as a mortgage regardless of the parties' intent, then E would be correct.

I think the correct approach is that the court looks at the intent. So the answer is H.

The question revolves around whether a deed absolute, intended as additional security for a loan, extinguishes the investor's right to redeem the property upon default. The investor and the friend disagree on the nature of the deed, with the investor arguing it was meant as security (like a mortgage) and the friend claiming it was an outright conveyance upon default.

Key facts include:
1. The deed absolute was delivered to a nephew in escrow with instructions to transfer it to the friend upon default.
2. The deed was recorded after the investor failed to pay the promissory note.
3. The investor tendered payment two weeks after the deed was recorded, but the friend refused.

The court must determine whether the deed absolute was intended as a mortgage (granting the investor a right to redeem) or as an outright conveyance (eliminating the right to redeem). Courts generally look to the substance over the form and the intent of the parties. If the deed was intended as security, it is treated as a mortgage, and the right to redeem exists. If it was intended as an outright conveyance, the right to redeem is extinguished.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The priority of the mortgage over the deed is irrelevant because the issue is whether the deed was intended as security or an outright conveyance.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The deed absolute does not automatically effectuate an outright conveyance; the court must consider the intent behind it.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The investor retains the right to redeem if the deed is treated as a mortgage.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The timing of the deed's execution is not determinative; the intent is the key factor.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The deed absolute does not inherently extinguish the right of redemption; it depends on the intent behind the deed.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The investor's failure to pay does not automatically mean the friend is entitled to the property; the right to redeem must still be considered.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The friend's refusal to accept payment does not resolve the issue of whether the right to redeem exists.
- **Option H**: Correct. The court will rule for the investor if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security, which aligns with the facts provided.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While it is true that the deed was not intended as an outright conveyance, the correct reasoning focuses on proving the intent behind the deed as security.

The correct answer is **H**, as the court will grant relief to the investor if he can establish that the deed absolute was intended as additional security for the debt.

Answer: H
