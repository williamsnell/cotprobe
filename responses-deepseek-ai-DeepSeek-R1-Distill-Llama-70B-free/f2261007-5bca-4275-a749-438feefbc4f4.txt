Okay, so I have this geography question to answer, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about the Rio Grande and its role as part of the boundary between the United States and Mexico. I remember that the Rio Grande is a river, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let's break it down.

First, the question asks what kind of boundary the Rio Grande is an example of. The options are A through I, each describing a different type of boundary. So I need to understand each option and see which one fits the Rio Grande.

Option A is a forest boundary. Hmm, I don't think the Rio Grande is a forest. It's a river, so that's probably not it. Plus, forests covering such a large boundary area don't seem right.

Option B is a desert boundary. Well, the Rio Grande does flow through desert regions, but the river itself is a waterway, not a desert. So maybe this isn't the right category either.

Option C is an artificial boundary. Artificial boundaries are usually man-made, like canals or borders drawn on a map without natural features. The Rio Grande is a natural river, so I don't think this is correct.

Option D is a man-made canal. I know the Suez and Panama Canals are examples of that, but the Rio Grande is a natural river, not a canal built by humans. So D is out.

Option E is a continental divide. A continental divide is a line where water flows to different oceans on either side. I don't think the Rio Grande serves that purpose. It flows into the Gulf of Mexico, I believe, so it's not dividing between two major drainage basins like a continental divide would.

Option F is a mountain range. The Rio Grande is a river, not a mountain range. So F isn't correct.

Option G is a natural boundary. This seems more plausible. Natural boundaries are physical features like rivers, mountains, or deserts. Since the Rio Grande is a river, a natural feature, this could be the right answer.

Option H is a water divider. Wait, isn't that similar to a continental divide? Or maybe it refers to something else. I'm not too sure, but I think a water divider might be a local term, but I'm more confident about natural boundary being the term used here.

Option I is an ocean boundary. The Rio Grande isn't an ocean; it's a river flowing into the ocean, so I can eliminate this option.

Putting it all together, the Rio Grande is a river serving as a natural boundary between the US and Mexico. So the correct answer should be G: a natural boundary.

The Rio Grande is a river that serves as a natural boundary between the United States and Mexico. Among the given options, it fits best as a natural boundary because it is a physical geographical feature, not a man-made or artificial one. 

Answer: G
