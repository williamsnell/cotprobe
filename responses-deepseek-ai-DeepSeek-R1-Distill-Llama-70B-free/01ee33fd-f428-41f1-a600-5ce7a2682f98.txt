Okay, so I've got this problem about an electric kettle, and I need to figure out the answers to four parts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem says the kettle has 2 liters of water, heating from 20°C to boiling point, which is 100°C. It takes 5 minutes. The supply voltage is 200 V, and a kWh costs 2 cents. The questions are about power consumed, cost for six uses, resistance, and current.

Starting with part (a), the power consumed. I remember that power is related to energy. The energy used here is the heat required to raise the water's temperature. Since heat losses are negligible, all electrical energy goes into heating the water.

The formula for heat energy is Q = m * c * ΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change. For water, c is about 4186 J/kg°C. But wait, the mass isn't given in kg. The volume is 2 liters. Since 1 liter of water is approximately 1 kg, 2 liters would be 2 kg.

So, Q = 2 kg * 4186 J/kg°C * (100 - 20)°C. Let me calculate that. 100-20 is 80. So 2 * 4186 * 80. Let me do the math. 4186 * 80 is... 4186*80: 4186 * 8 is 33488, so times 10 is 334880, wait no, 80 is 8*10, so 33488*10 = 334,880 J. Then multiply by 2 kg: 334,880 * 2 = 669,760 Joules.

But wait, that's in Joules. Power is energy per time. The time given is 5 minutes. Oh, but I need to convert that into hours since the cost is per kWh. Wait, no, because for part (a) power is in watts, which is joules per second. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to first find the energy in kWh and then compute power.

Wait, let me think again. The energy Q is 669,760 J. To convert to kWh, since 1 kWh is 3.6 million joules (because 1 kW is 1000 J/s, so 1 hour is 3600 seconds: 1000 * 3600 = 3,600,000 J). So 669,760 J divided by 3.6e6 J/kWh gives the energy in kWh.

Let me compute that: 669760 / 3600000 = approximately 0.186 kWh. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 3.6e6 is 3,600,000. So 669,760 divided by 3,600,000. Let me calculate that.

669760 / 3600000 = (669760 ÷ 1000) / (3600000 ÷ 1000) )= 669.76 / 3600 ≈ 0.186 kWh.

Wait, but that's the energy used. Now, power is energy over time. The time is 5 minutes, which is 5/60 hours = 1/12 hours ≈ 0.0833 hours.

So power P = energy / time. So 0.186 kWh / 0.0833 hours = 2.24 kW? Wait, that can't be right because 0.186 divided by (5/60) is 0.186 * (60/5) = 0.186 * 12 = 2.232 kW. So approximately 2.23 kW.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option F has (a) 2.23 kW. Option E is 2 kW. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: Calculate the power in watts. The energy is 669,760 J over 5 minutes, which is 300 seconds. So power is 669760 J / 300 s ≈ 2232 W, which is 2.232 kW. So that's 2.23 kW, which is option F for part (a).

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used more precise calculations. Let me redo it:

Q = m c ΔT = 2 kg * 4186 J/kg°C * 80°C = 2 * 4186 *80.

4186 * 80 = let's compute 4000*80=320,000, 186*80=14,880 → 320,000 + 14,880 = 334,880 J/kg. Multiply by 2 kg: 669,760 J.

Time is 5 minutes = 300 seconds. Power P = Q/t = 669760 / 300 ≈ 2232 W = 2.232 kW ≈ 2.23 kW. So that's correct.

So for part (a), the answer should be about 2.23 kW. Looking at the options, option F has (a) 2.23 kW, so that fits.

Then part (b): cost of using the kettle six times. Each use consumes 2.23 kWh? Wait wait, no. Wait, each use consumes 0.186 kWh (as calculated earlier). Because the power is 2.23 kW, so energy is 2.23 kW * (5/60) h) = 0.1865 kWh per use. So six uses would be 6 * 0.1865 ≈ 1.119 kWh.

But wait, wait. Let's think in terms of the power and time. Each use is 5 minutes, which is 1/12 of an hour. So per use, the energy is 2.23 kW * (5/60) h = (2.23 *5)/60 = 11.15 /60 = 0.1858 kWh. So for six uses, 6 * 0.1858 ≈ 1.1148 kWh.

The cost is 2 cents per kWh. So 1.1148 kWh * 2 cents = 2.2296 cents, approximately 2.23 cents.

Looking at the options, option F has (b) 2.23 cents. So that fits.

Wait, but option F's part (b) is 2.23 cents? Looking back: option F says (b) 2.23 cents. So that's correct.

Now part (c): resistance of the heating element. The supply voltage is 200 V. Power P = V²/R → R = V² / P.

P is 2.23 kW = 2230 W. V is 200 V.

So R = (200)^2 / 2230 = 40000 / 2230 ≈ let's compute that. 40000 ÷ 2230.

2230 * 17 = let's see, 2230*10=22300, 2230*7=15610 → 22300+15610=37910. 2230*18=37910+2230=40140. Oh, wait, 2230*17.9 ≈ 40000?

Wait, 2230 * 17.9 = 2230*(18 - 0.1) = 2230*18=40140, minus 2230*.1=223 → 40140-223=39917. Hmm, but 2230 * 17.9 = 39917, which is just under 40,000. So 40000 / 2230 ≈ 17.9 ohms. Because 17.9 *2230≈39917, and 2230 *17.91 = 39917 + 2230*0.01=22.3 → 39917+22.3=39939.3. So 17.91 would give 39,939, which is closer to 40,000. So 17.91 Ohms. But looking at the options, option F says (c) 17.9 Ohms. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me compute 200^2 / 2232 W.

200^2 is 40,000. 40,000 divided by 2232 is approximately 17.92 Ohms. So around 17.9 Ohms, which matches option F.

Then part (d): current in the element. Current I = V/R. Voltage is 200 V, resistance is approximately 17.9 Ohms.

So I = 200 / 17.9 ≈ let's compute that.

17.9 * 11 = 196.9 → 200-196.9=3.1. So 11 + (3.1/17.9) → 3.1/17.9 ≈ 0.173. So 11.173 A, approximately 11.17 A. Looking at the options, option F says (d) 11.2 A. So that's correct.

Putting it all together:

(a) 2.23 kW → option F
(b) 2.23 cents → option F
(c) 17.9 Ohms → option F
(d) 11.2 A → option F

So the correct answer is option F.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

### (a) Power Consumed
The energy required to heat the water is calculated using the formula for heat energy:  
\[
Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]  
where \(m = 2 \, \text{kg}\), \(c = 4186 \, \text{J/kg°C}\), and \(\Delta T = 80 \, \text{°C}\).  
\[
Q = 2 \cdot 4186 \cdot 80 = 669,760 \, \text{J}
\]  
Converting this to kilowatt-hours (kWh):  
\[
1 \, \text{kWh} = 3.6 \times 10^6 \, \text{J}, \quad Q = \frac{669,760}{3.6 \times 10^6} \approx 0.186 \, \text{kWh}
\]  
The time taken is 5 minutes, which is \(\frac{5}{60} = 0.0833 \, \text{hours}\). The power is then:  
\[
P = \frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{0.186}{0.0833} \approx 2.23 \, \text{kW}
\]  

### (b) Cost of Using the Kettle Six Times
The energy per use is approximately \(0.186 \, \text{kWh}\). For six uses:  
\[
\text{Total Energy} = 6 \cdot 0.186 = 1.116 \, \text{kWh}
\]  
The cost at \(2 \, \text{cents/kWh}\) is:  
\[
\text{Cost} = 1.116 \cdot 2 = 2.23 \, \text{cents}
\]  

### (c) Resistance of the Heating Element
Using the formula \(P = \frac{V^2}{R}\), where \(V = 200 \, \text{V}\) and \(P = 2.23 \, \text{kW} = 2230 \, \text{W}\):  
\[
R = \frac{V^2}{P} = \frac{200^2}{2230} = \frac{40,000}{2230} \approx 17.9 \, \Omega
\]  

### (d) Current in the Element
Using Ohm's Law, \(I = \frac{V}{R}\):  
\[
I = \frac{200}{17.9} \approx 11.2 \, \text{A}
\]  

### Final Answer
All calculations align with the values in **Option F**:  
- (a) \(2.23 \, \text{kW}\)  
- (b) \(2.23 \, \text{cents}\)  
- (c) \(17.9 \, \Omega\)  
- (d) \(11.2 \, \text{A}\)
