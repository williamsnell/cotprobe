Question:

During a two-month span, there were 15 bank robberies in the city area. The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery. The prosecution seeks to introduce the ski mask and the money found in his home into evidence. A motion by the defendant's attorney to exclude the items will be

Options:

A: granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask.
B: granted, if the defendant can prove that the police did not have a valid warrant.
C: denied, if the prosecution can prove that the police had a valid warrant.
D: granted with respect to the money, if it can be proven that it was not obtained from the robberies.
E: granted with respect to the ski mask, but denied with respect to the money.
F: denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.
G: denied with respect to the money, if it can be proven that it was obtained from the robberies.
H: granted with respect to the ski mask, if it can be proven that it was obtained illegally.
I: denied with respect to the ski mask, if it can be proven that it was used in the robberies.
J: granted with respect to both the ski mask and the money.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about evidence admissibility in a criminal case. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant who's been arrested for bank robberies. The police got a tip from a reliable informant, secured an arrest warrant, and went to his home. When they arrived, the defendant was in his underwear and asked to get dressed. An officer asked if anyone else was there, and he said he was alone. The officer then accompanied him to the bedroom, checked the closet, found a ski mask, and took it. Later, another officer did a protective sweep and found a box of money, which was stolen.

The question is whether the ski mask and the money will be admissible in court. The defendant's attorney is trying to get them excluded.

I remember that when police have an arrest warrant, they can arrest the person, and under the Payton v. New York case, they can enter the home to make the arrest. But what about searching the premises? I think that when they take the defendant into custody, they can conduct a protective sweep, especially if they have a reasonable belief that there are other dangerous people present.

In this case, the defendant said he was alone, but the officer still did a protective sweep of the other rooms. I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the protective sweep is allowed without consent or a warrant. I think that under Maryland v. Buie, a protective sweep is allowed if the officers have a reasonable belief that there are other people who might pose a danger. But since the defendant said he was alone, does that negate the reasonable belief? Hmm, maybe the officer's partner thought there might still be someone else, but if the defendant is already under arrest and in custody, maybe the sweep wasn't justified.

Wait, but the officer who went into the bedroom was with the defendant, and the partner did the sweep of the other rooms. So the protective sweep of the back storage room might be an issue. If the police didn't have a search warrant, they can only search areas within the defendant's reach (like the arrest area) without consent. The back storage room is another part of the house, so unless there was consent or probable cause, the search might be invalid.

Regarding the ski mask: the officer accompanied the defendant to the bedroom. The defendant asked to enter the closet. The officer inspected the closet first and found the ski mask. So was this a valid search? Since the defendant was in custody, the officer might have a right to search the area for officer safety. Also, when the defendant was getting clothes, the officer could check the closet to ensure no weapons are present. So the ski mask was in plain view during a lawful search, making it admissible.

As for the money, the officer found it during a protective sweep. If the sweep was unlawful because there was no reasonable belief that others were present, then the money would be excluded. However, if the protective sweep was lawful, then the money, being in plain view, would be admissible.

Wait, so the issue is whether the protective sweep was lawful. The defendant told the officer he was alone, so perhaps the officer's belief that others were present was unreasonable. If the protective sweep was unlawful, then the money found would be inadmissible as fruit of the poisonous tree.

So the ski mask was found during a lawful search incident to arrest, and the money was found during an unlawful protective sweep. Therefore, the ski mask is admissible, and the money is not.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the motion is granted (money excluded) but denied (ski mask allowed). That fits.

Option F says both are denied (both admitted). That would be if both searches were lawful.

But I think the protective sweep was unlawful because the defendant said he was alone, so no reasonable belief others were there. So the money is excluded. Ski mask is in, money is out.

So the correct answer is A.

The scenario involves a defendant arrested for bank robberies, with evidence (a ski mask and money) seized during police actions in his home. The admissibility of this evidence hinges on the legality of the searches conducted.

1. **Ski Mask**: The officer accompanied the defendant to the bedroom and inspected the closet before allowing the defendant to enter. This search was lawful under the circumstances, as it was conducted for officer safety and within the scope of a lawful arrest. The ski mask, found in plain view, is therefore admissible.

2. **Money**: The money was discovered during a protective sweep of a back storage room. Under *Maryland v. Buie*, a protective sweep requires a reasonable belief that others posing a danger are present. Since the defendant stated he was alone, the officers' belief that others were present was likely unreasonable, making the sweep unlawful. Consequently, the money, as fruit of an unlawful search, should be excluded.

Thus, the defendant's motion to suppress will be granted with respect to the money but denied regarding the ski mask.
