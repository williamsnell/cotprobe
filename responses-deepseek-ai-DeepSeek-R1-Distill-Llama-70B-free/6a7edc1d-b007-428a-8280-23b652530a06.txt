Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the Articles of Confederation. Let's start by understanding the question and the provided information.

The question is referring to a passage from the Journals of the Continental Congress, 1777. The passage talks about recommending certain articles to the states, emphasizing the difficulty of uniting various sentiments and interests across many sovereign communities. It also mentions the necessity of uniting councils and strength to maintain common liberties.

The question is asking about a major weakness of the Articles of Confederation. The options are A through J, each pointing out a different potential weakness.

I remember that the Articles of Confederation had several weaknesses that led to the creation of the US Constitution. Let me list what I know about their weaknesses:

1. **No power to tax:** The federal government couldn't levy taxes; it had to rely on states, which often didn't contribute enough. This made funding national activities difficult.

2. **No executive branch:** There was no chief executive, so decisions were hard to enforce.

3. **Amendment difficulties:** The Articles required unanimous consent from all states to amend, which was nearly impossible.

4. **No judiciary:** There was no federal court system to resolve disputes.

5. **Weak national government:** States had more power, making it hard for the federal government to act effectively.

6. **No power to regulate commerce:** This led to issues like trade wars between states.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Made it too difficult to raise money through taxes. This aligns with the first point I mentioned. The government couldn't tax effectively.

Option B: No provision for creating new states. Wait, I think the Articles actually did allow for new states to be admitted, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Or perhaps this isn't a major weakness compared to others.

Option C: Created a too-powerful chief executive. No, the opposite was true; there was no strong executive.

Option D: Established a single identity too quickly. I don't think that's correct. The problem was more about too much state sovereignty.

Option E: Denied federal power to mediate state disputes. Yes, I remember that under the Articles, the federal government couldn't effectively mediate disputes between states, leading to potential conflicts.

Option F: Granted too much power to the judiciary. No, the judiciary was weak or non-existent.

Option G: Failed to establish a national currency. That's correct, but was that a major weakness? It contributed to economic issues, like inflation.

Option H: No mechanism for amendment. Yes, they required unanimous consent, which was a big issue.

Option I: No national army or navy. The government couldn't maintain a standing army, which was a problem, especially after the Revolutionary War.

Option J: Allowed unrestricted movement. I think the Articles actually allowed that, but it's not a weakness; it's more of a feature.

Now, the question is about a "major" weakness. So which of these is considered a primary issue?

The passage in the question mentions the difficulty of uniting various sovereign states, indicating that the structure made it hard to have a unified system. It also talks about uniting councils and strength, implying issues with national authority.

Looking back, the options:

A is about taxes, which was a big problem because the government couldn't fund itself properly. H is about amendment, which made it hard to fix the system. E is about mediating disputes, which was another flaw.

But the question is about which option is correct. The possible answers are that the Articles didn't have the power to tax (A), couldn't amend (H), couldn't mediate disputes (E), or couldn't maintain a military (I).

I think the most commonly cited weaknesses are the inability to tax, no executive, and the amendment issue. Since the question is about which is a major weakness, let's see what the options are.

The question provides a passage that emphasizes the difficulty of uniting the states and maintaining common liberties, which suggests issues with the structure's effectiveness.

Option H says the Articles did not include a mechanism for their own amendment. Wait, actually, the Articles did have a mechanism, but it was too strict—requiring all states to agree. So maybe the correct wording would be about the difficulty in amending, not the absence of a mechanism. Hmm, but the option says "did not include a mechanism," which isn't accurate because there was a mechanism, just a very hard one. So maybe H isn't correct.

Option E: Denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states. I think that was the case. The federal government couldn't effectively resolve state disputes, leading to conflicts.

Option A: The inability to raise money through taxes. This was a significant issue because the government couldn't fund its operations.

So which is more accurate as a major weakness? Both A and E are correct points, but the question is about which one is the answer.

Wait, the question is from the Journals of the Continental Congress in 1777. The Articles were adopted in 1777, but perhaps the context is about the challenges they faced when drafting, like the difficulty in uniting the states.

In the passage, they're recommending the articles to the states, noting the difficulty of combining sentiments and interests, and the necessity of uniting councils and strength.

So perhaps the key issue is that the government couldn't effectively make decisions because of the structure. Which weakness aligns with that?

If the government couldn't enforce laws or make decisions without state approval, that's a structural issue. The lack of power to tax (A) would make the government weak, as they couldn't fund a military or other needs.

Another thought: The most well-known weaknesses are the tax issue, amendment difficulty, and lack of executive. Since the options include A and H, and the question is about a major weakness.

Wait, the question is about the Articles' weaknesses. Let me think of the options again.

Option E: Denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states. So the federal government couldn't mediate, which could cause state conflicts. That's a valid point.

Option A: Made it too difficult to raise money through taxes and duties. That's also a big issue.

Which one is more directly a major weakness?

In the provided passage, the emphasis is on the difficulty of uniting the states, which suggests that the structure made cooperation hard. That could tie into the lack of a strong central authority, such as the inability to tax, which would prevent the government from acting effectively.

Alternatively, the inability to mediate disputes would cause more division.

I'm a bit torn. But I recall that the inability to tax is often cited as a primary weakness because without funding, the government couldn't operate effectively. For example, during the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress couldn't adequately fund the army, leading to hard conditions for the troops.

So between A and E, which is a major weakness? I think A is correct.

Wait, but another angle: The Articles of Confederation required a unanimous vote for amendments (H), making it nearly impossible to make changes. This was a significant flaw because it made the system inflexible.

But the question is about a major weakness, and the options are A through J.

Wait, the correct answer is H: did not include a mechanism for their own amendment.

Wait, no, the Articles did include a mechanism, but it was too strict. So the option might not be accurate, because they did have a mechanism, just a bad one.

Wait, the question is phrased: "did not include a mechanism for their own amendment." Is that correct? Let me think. The Articles required that any amendments be approved by all 13 states. So the mechanism existed, but it was too difficult. So perhaps the correct answer isn't H, because the mechanism was there, just not effective.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the lack of taxing power was a major issue.

Another point is that the question is about a major weakness. The inability to tax (A) is a fundamental flaw. The federal government couldn't raise revenue, making it unable to fund even basic functions.

So I think the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of each option again.

Option A: Made it too difficult for the government to raise money through taxes and duties. Yes, because the government couldn't impose taxes; they had to request money from states, which rarely paid up.

Option E: Denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states. I believe that's correct too.

Option H: Incorrect, because there was a mechanism, albeit requiring unanimous consent.

So between A and E. Which is a major weakness?

In the context of the passage, it's about uniting the states and their interests. The inability to mediate disputes would prevent that unity. So perhaps E is the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: Think about which options are incorrect.

Option C: Too powerful executive? No, the opposite.

Option D: Unified identity too quickly? Unlikely, as states were too sovereign.

Option F: Too much judiciary power? No.

Option G: No national currency. While that was a problem, maybe not the major one.

Option I: No national army. The government couldn't maintain one, which was a problem.

Option J: Unrestricted movement is actually a feature, not a weakness.

So narrowing down, the possible correct answers are A, E, H, I.

Wait, the question is about the major weakness. If I recall correctly, the Articles are often criticized for the lack of coercive power over the states, including taxation (A), and the inability to regulate commerce (which relates to G and I).

But the question asks which is a major weakness. The options are A, E, H, I.

I think the correct answer is A: Made it too difficult for the government to raise money through taxes and duties.

Another way: The passage mentions the difficulty of uniting the various sentiments and interests, which implies that the government couldn't effectively act, perhaps due to lack of funds or enforcement.

So I'll go with A as the correct answer.

The question asks about a major weakness of the Articles of Confederation, referencing a passage from the Journals of the Continental Congress in 1777. The passage highlights the difficulty of uniting the states and maintaining common liberties, suggesting structural issues with the federal system.

The Articles of Confederation had several well-documented weaknesses. Key among them were:

1. **Inability to tax**: The federal government could not levy taxes directly and relied on states for funding, which often resulted in insufficient revenue to support national activities.
2. **No executive branch**: There was no strong central authority to enforce decisions.
3. **Amendment difficulties**: The Articles required unanimous consent from all states for amendments, making reforms nearly impossible.
4. **No judiciary**: There was no federal court system to resolve disputes.
5. **Weak national government**: The federal government lacked the power to regulate commerce or mediate state disputes.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The inability to raise money through taxes was a significant issue, as it prevented the federal government from funding its operations effectively.
- **Option E**: The federal government's inability to mediate disputes between states was another flaw, leading to potential conflicts.
- **Option H**: While the Articles did have a mechanism for amendment, it was overly restrictive, requiring unanimous consent. However, the option's phrasing ("did not include a mechanism") is inaccurate because a mechanism did exist, albeit a flawed one.
- **Option I**: The lack of a national army or navy was a problem, but it is not as directly tied to the passage's emphasis on uniting the states.

The passage emphasizes the difficulty of uniting the states and maintaining common liberties, which aligns with the structural weakness of the federal government's inability to act effectively. Among the options, the inability to raise money through taxes (Option A) is a fundamental flaw that directly impacted the government's ability to function and unite the states.
