Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the native peoples of the northwest coast of North America. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the northwest coast refers to regions like present-day British Columbia in Canada and the states of Washington, Oregon, maybe parts of Alaska. The native peoples there included groups like the Tlingit, Haida, and Salish tribes. I think they were known for their rich culture and abundant resources.

The question is asking about their way of life. The options are from A to J, each describing different lifestyles or traits. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Simple foragers. Foragers are hunter-gatherers, but "simple" might imply a basic or minimalistic approach. I'm not sure if that's accurate for these groups because I recall they had a more complex society.

Option B: Maize agriculturalists. Maize is corn, which was a staple in Mesoamerica and other parts like the Southwest. But I don't think the northwest coast people relied heavily on maize. They probably had different crops or didn't farm as much.

Option C: Conquered by the Aztec. The Aztecs were in Central America, far south. The northwest tribes were way north, so this seems unlikely. Unless there was some contact, but I don't think they were conquered by the Aztecs.

Option D: Dependent on hunting large game. Large game like deer or maybe even whales? Wait, I think they did hunt whales and other marine mammals, but maybe "large game" is too specific. Also, they probably had a varied diet including fish and other seafood.

Option E: Primarily seafaring traders. They did have canoes and traded along the coast, but were they primarily traders? I think their economy was more based on abundant local resources rather than trade being their main focus.

Option F: Primarily desert dwellers. No, the northwest coast is temperate rainforest, lots of trees and rain, not desert. So this can't be right.

Option G: Known for their pottery skills. I'm not sure about this. I know they were skilled in woodworking and totem poles, but pottery might not be their main thing. Maybe other tribes were more into pottery.

Option H: Affluent foragers. This rings a bell. I remember reading that the northwest coast tribes were examples of "affluent foragers." They had a rich environment with plenty of food like salmon, which allowed them to have a more complex society without relying on agriculture. They had surpluses, which led to things like social stratification and art.

Option I: Nomadic herders. Herding implies they had domesticated animals, but I don't think the native northwest coast people had herds. They were more into fishing and gathering.

Option J: Early industrialists. No, industrialism came much later with European influence. These were pre-Columbian societies, so this doesn't fit.

So, putting it all together, the northwest coast natives were known as affluent foragers. They didn't need to farm because the natural resources were so abundant. They had a complex society with permanent settlements, art, and social hierarchies. So the correct answer should be H.

The native peoples of the northwest coast of North America, such as the Tlingit, Haida, and Salish, were known for their affluent forager lifestyle. They thrived in a resource-rich environment with abundant seafood, including salmon, which allowed them to build complex societies without relying on agriculture. Their way of life was characterized by social stratification, permanent settlements, and rich cultural expressions like totem poles. This makes option H the correct choice.
