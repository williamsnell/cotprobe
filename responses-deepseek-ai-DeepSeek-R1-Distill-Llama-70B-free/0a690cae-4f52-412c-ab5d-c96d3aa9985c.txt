Question:

A father and a son were indicted and charged with bank robbery. They allegedly participated together in robbing a bank in their hometown. After the son was arrested and given Miranda warnings, he confessed and admitted that he and his father took part in the bank robbery. The prosecution decided to charge the father and son in the same indictment and prosecute them together in a single trial. At trial, the son took the stand and recanted his earlier confession by denying participation in the robbery. The prosecution now seeks to introduce into evidence the son's earlier confession that was videotaped by the police. The son and the father both object to its admissibility. The confession should be

Options:

A: admitted against the father only, because the son recanted his confession.
B: not admitted against the son, but admitted against the father as it implicates him in the crime.
C: admitted against both the son and the father, because the son implicated the father in the crime.
D: not admitted against the son or the father, because the son was under duress when he confessed.
E: admitted against the son only, because it is his confession.
F: admitted against both the son and the father, because they were jointly charged.
G: not admitted against the son or the father, because the confession is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
H: not admitted against the son or the father, because the son recanted the confession.
I: admitted against both the son and the father, because they were engaged in a conspiracy.
J: admitted against the son only.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about evidence and confessions in a criminal trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a father and son were indicted together for a bank robbery. The son was arrested, given Miranda warnings, and then confessed, saying both he and his father did it. Now, they're being tried together. At the trial, the son takes the stand and recants his confession, denying involvement. The prosecution wants to introduce the son's earlier videotaped confession. Both the son and father object.

The question is about the admissibility of that confession. The options are from A to J.

Hmm. I remember that when a defendant's own confession is made, it's generally admissible against them, but there are rules about using it against co-defendants. Oh wait, right! The problem here is about the son's statement implicating both himself and his father. So when the son confesses, he's not just admitting his own guilt but also the father's.

I think about Bruton v. United States. That case dealt with the admissibility of a co-defendant's confession. From what I recall, if two defendants are tried together and one confesses implicating the other, that confession can't be used against the other defendant because it's hearsay, and the confessing defendant can't be cross-examined about it in front of the jury. But wait, Bruton was about when the co-defendant doesn't testify. In this case, the son is testifying and even recanting.

Wait, but in this scenario, the son is on the stand and recants. Does that change things? Because normally, if the co-defendant takes the stand, they can be cross-examined, so maybe the Bruton issue is avoided. But in this case, the son is the one who made the confession, and he's now recanting it.

So the prosecution wants to use the son's prior confession against both the son and the father. But the issue is whether that's permissible.

For the son himself, his own confession is admissible against him because it's a statement by a party-opponent under FRE 801(d)(2). So the prosecution can use it against him. So any option that says it's not admitted against the son is probably wrong, unless there's another issue like duress or Miranda violations. But the question doesn't indicate that the confession was involuntary or that Miranda was violated; it just says he was given Miranda warnings. So I think we can assume it's admissible as to him.

But the problem comes when the prosecution wants to use the son's confession against the father. That's where Bruton comes into play. Because the son's statement is being offered against the father, and if they're co-defendants in a joint trial, the father's rights under the Confrontation Clause might be violated if the son doesn't testify.

Wait, but in this case, the son does testify. He takes the stand and recants. So does that mean the father can confront the son about the statement? Because the son is available for cross-examination, the Bruton issue might not apply. Oh, but Bruton was about when the co-defendant doesn't testify. Here, the son does testify, so maybe the father's rights are satisfied because he can cross the son about the confession.

Wait, but Bruton's main issue is that when a co-defendant's confession is admitted, it's hearsay and the other defendant can't confront them unless they testify. So if the son testifies, then the father's confrontation rights are satisfied regarding the son's statement. Therefore, the son's confession can be used against the father as well.

Wait, but in this case, the son is testifying and recanting, which might actually help the father because the son is now denying the earlier statement. But the prosecution wants to use the earlier confession. So the issue is whether the son's prior statement can be used against both.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is admissible against the son under 801(d)(2)(A) as a prior inconsistent statement, but that's when the declarant is subject to cross-examination. Since the son is testifying, the prosecution can use the prior statement to impeach him, but that doesn't necessarily make it admissible as substantive evidence for the truth of the matter asserted unless it's a statement against interest or something else.

Wait, no. The son's prior confession is an admission by a party-opponent, so under FRE 801(d)(2), it's not hearsay and is admissible against the son. As for the father, the son's statement is being offered against the father, so it's hearsay unless an exception applies. But under Bruton, if the son is available to testify, then using the statement against the father is permissible because the father can cross-examine the son about it.

But wait, in this scenario, the son is testifying and recanting. So the prosecution can introduce the prior confession as substantive evidence against the son, but can they also use it against the father?

Wait, perhaps the father's situation is that the son's statement is hearsay unless it's within a conspiracy exception or something. Wait, if they were part of a conspiracy, maybe statements made in furtherance are admissible, but I'm not sure that's the case here.

Alternatively, the father's lawyer might argue that the son's statement is hearsay and inadmissible against him. But since the son is testifying, the father can cross-examine him about the statement, so it might not violate Bruton because the son is available as a witness.

Wait, but the son's statement is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth, so it's hearsay. Unless it's a statement against the son's interest, which it is because it admits to a crime, so maybe it's admissible against the son but not the father unless it's a co-conspirator statement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline:

- Son's confession is admissible against the son because it's his own statement (801(d)(2)).
- For the father, the son's statement is hearsay unless it's covered by an exception.
- If the father and son were in a conspiracy, and the statement was made during the conspiracy and in furtherance of it, then it could be admissible against the father under the co-conspirator exception (FRE 801(d)(2)(E)).
- But in this case, the charge is bank robbery, not conspiracy, but they might have been charged together as co-conspirators. The question says they were jointly charged, but I'm not sure if that's for conspiracy or as co-defendants in a robbery.

Wait, the question says they were "indicted and charged with bank robbery" and "prosecute them together in a single trial." So they're co-defendants in a robbery, not necessarily charged with conspiracy.

So, without a conspiracy charge, the co-conspirator exception wouldn't apply. Therefore, the son's statement would be hearsay as to the father unless it's non-hearsay, like an admission by a party-opponent, but the father isn't a party to the son's statement. So the son's statement is only an admission by the son, not by the father.

Therefore, the statement can be used against the son, but not against the father. However, if the son testifies and is subject to cross-examination, then under Bruton, the father's rights are satisfied because he can confront the son about the statement. Wait, but Bruton's issue was about the statement being used against a co-defendant when the declarant doesn't testify. Here, the declarant (son) does testify, so the father can cross-examine him, thus making the statement admissible against the father as well.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The son's statement is admissible against the son because it's his own admission. As for the father, the statement is hearsay unless it falls under an exception. Since the father isn't a party to the statement, it's not an admission by him. So the only way it's admissible against the father is if it's non-hearsay or falls under a hearsay exception.

But the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, so it's hearsay. Unless it's a statement against interest, but that exception applies when the declarant is unavailable. The son is available because he's testifying, so that exception wouldn't apply.

Wait, but the statement against interest exception (FRE 804(b)(3)) requires that the declarant is unavailable. The son is available because he's testifying, so that exception doesn't help.

So, the son's statement is admissible against the son, but inadmissible against the father as hearsay, unless there's another exception. But without a conspiracy charge, the co-conspirator exception doesn't apply. Therefore, the statement cannot be used against the father.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the son is testifying, the father's confrontation right is satisfied, so Bruton doesn't bar the use of the statement against the father. But Bruton dealt with the Confrontation Clause and hearsay. So if the son testifies, the statement can be used against the father because the father can cross-examine the son about it, thus satisfying the confrontation requirement. But that doesn't make it non-hearsay; it just allows it to be used despite hearsay under the Sixth Amendment.

Wait, no. The issue is that the statement is hearsay. The Confrontation Clause might allow it if the declarant is available, but the statement is still hearsay. So even if the declarant is available, the statement is hearsay unless it's an exception. So the son's statement can't be used against the father unless it's non-hearsay or falls under a hearsay exception.

Wait, but the son's statement is an admission by a party-opponent as to the son, but not as to the father. So, for the father, it's hearsay. Therefore, the statement can't be used against the father, even if the son testifies. So the prosecution can't use the son's confession against the father because it's hearsay and no exception applies.

But wait, I might be wrong. Let me think about this again. If the son makes a statement that incriminates both himself and the father, and the son testifies and is cross-examined about it, can the statement be used against the father?

I think the key here is that the statement is admissible against the son, but against the father, it's hearsay. Unless it's a co-conspirator statement, which would require that the statement was made in furtherance of a conspiracy. But in this case, they're charged with robbery, not conspiracy, so that exception doesn't apply.

So, putting it all together: the son's prior confession is admissible against the son because it's his own admission. But against the father, it's inadmissible hearsay, so it can't be used against him.

Looking at the options:

Option E: admitted against the son only.

Option B: not admitted against the son, but admitted against the father. That can't be right because the son's own statement is admissible against him.

Option J: admitted against the son only.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option E: admitted against the son only, because it is his confession. That makes sense.

Option J: admitted against the son only.

Wait, are E and J the same? Let me look.

Wait, the options are:

E: admitted against the son only, because it is his confession.

J: admitted against the son only.

So both E and J are similar, but perhaps the reasoning is different.

Wait, but looking more carefully, in the initial analysis, the son's confession is admissible against the son, but not against the father. So the correct option would be that it's admitted against the son only.

So looking at the options, E says "because it is his confession," which is correct. J just says "admitted against the son only," without the reason.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is E. Or is it J? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: admitted against the father only.

B: not admitted against the son, but admitted against the father.

C: admitted against both.

D: not admitted against either.

E: admitted against the son only, because it is his confession.

F: admitted against both.

G: not admitted against either because hearsay.

H: not admitted because recanted.

I: admitted against both because conspiracy.

J: admitted against the son only.

So, the reasoning is that the son's own confession is admissible against him, but not against the father. So the correct options are either E or J. But E gives a reason, while J doesn't. The answer needs to be the letter.

But wait, another point: when a defendant's confession is introduced, it's only admissible against him, not against others unless it's non-hearsay for them. So in this case, the father can't be implicated by the son's confession unless it's non-hearsay for him, which it's not.

So the conclusion is that the confession is admissible against the son only.

Looking at the options, E and J both suggest that. But E adds the reason, which is correct. So the answer should be E or J.

Wait, but in the options, E and J are both possible. Let me think again.

Wait, the Bruton issue: the son's statement can't be used against the father unless the son testifies. But the son did testify. So in Bruton, when the co-defendant testifies, the statement can be used against the other defendant. So maybe the statement can be used against the father as well, because the son is available for cross-examination.

Wait, but Bruton was about the Confrontation Clause allowing the statement to be used if the declarant is available. But that doesn't make the statement non-hearsay. So the statement is still hearsay as to the father unless it's an admission by the father, which it's not.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to clarify.

The son's statement is an admission by the son (party opponent) under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), so it's not hearsay and admissible against the son.

As for the father, the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter (that the father participated). So it's hearsay unless it's covered by an exception. The only possible exception here would be if it's a co-conspirator statement, but without a conspiracy charge, that's not applicable. So the statement is inadmissible against the father.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the confession is admitted against the son only. So the options are E or J.

Looking back, option E says "admitted against the son only, because it is his confession." That's correct.

Option J says "admitted against the son only." Also correct in conclusion, but without the reasoning.

But the answer options are structured so that each option gives a reason except for J. Wait, no, looking at the options:

E: admitted against the son only, because it is his confession.

J: admitted against the son only.

So both E and J say the same thing in terms of admissibility, but E adds a reason.

Wait, but in reality, the son's confession is admissible against him, but not against the father. So the correct answer is that it's admitted against the son only. So both E and J seem correct, but perhaps the intended answer is E because it gives the correct reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J, as the reasoning in E might not be the only factor. Wait, no, the reasoning in E is correct.

Wait, but another thought: when the son's statement is introduced, it's being offered as evidence by the prosecution. The son is a defendant, so his own prior statement is an admission, admissible against him. As for the father, the statement is hearsay, and without a hearsay exception, it's inadmissible. Therefore, the confession should be admitted against the son only.

So the correct answer is E or J. But looking at the options, J is "admitted against the son only." E is the same but with reasoning. Since both options are possible, but considering the answer structure, perhaps the correct letter is E.

Wait, but wait another point: when the son takes the stand and recants, the prosecution can still use the prior statement as substantive evidence because it's an admission by a party opponent. So the son's testimony doesn't negate the admissibility of the prior confession as to him. So the prosecution can use the confession against the son, but not against the father.

Therefore, the answer is E: admitted against the son only, because it is his confession.

But wait, looking back at the options, option J is also "admitted against the son only." So perhaps the correct answer is J because E's reasoning might not be the only consideration, or perhaps the options are structured differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it correctly states that the confession is admissible against the son because it's his own statement, making it non-hearsay as to him.

Yes, I think E is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the reason for admissibility against the son only.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the son's prior confession, which implicates both himself and his father in a bank robbery. The son recanted his confession at trial, and the prosecution seeks to introduce the prior confession into evidence. The issue is whether the confession is admissible against the son, the father, or both.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Admissibility Against the Son**:
   - The son's prior confession is an admission by a party-opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2)(A). This makes it non-hearsay and admissible against the son.
   - The fact that the son recanted his confession at trial does not negate the admissibility of the prior confession. The prosecution can still use it as substantive evidence against the son.

2. **Admissibility Against the Father**:
   - The son's confession is hearsay when offered against the father because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted.
   - Without a conspiracy charge or another hearsay exception (e.g., co-conspirator exception under FRE 801(d)(2)(E)), the confession cannot be admitted against the father.
   - Although the son testified and was subject to cross-examination, this does not convert the statement into non-hearsay for the father. The Confrontation Clause (addressed in *Bruton v. United States*) is satisfied because the son testified, but this does not resolve the hearsay issue.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The confession is admissible against the son, not just the father.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The confession is admissible against the son, as it is his own statement.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The confession is not admissible against the father due to hearsay.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The
