Okay, so I've got this question about wetted wall columns and mass transfer coefficients. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question gives me the coefficient K_G for SO2 absorption in water at 70°F, which is 0.068 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm. And it says the gas and liquid film resistances are equal. Then, I need to find the K_G for NH3 absorption at 49°F under the same conditions. Oh wait, but they give the diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 at 49°F as 0.115 and 0.168 cm²/sec, respectively.

Wait, so I'm thinking about how K_G relates to the diffusivities. I remember that in gas absorption, the overall mass transfer coefficient depends on the individual film coefficients. Since the resistances are equal, that probably means the gas and liquid film resistances are the same. So maybe the overall K_G is related to the individual coefficients in some way.

I think the formula for the overall mass transfer coefficient when both films contribute is 1/K_G = 1/k_G + 1/k_L. But wait, no, that's for the case when both phases contribute. Oh, but in this problem, it's stated that the gas and liquid film resistances are equal. So that would mean that k_G = k_L, but wait, no, because the resistances are inversely proportional to the coefficients. Oh wait, resistance is 1/k times the thickness or something? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I remember that for a wetted wall column, the mass transfer coefficient K_G can be expressed in terms of the diffusivity and other factors. Oh wait, maybe it's about the ratio of the diffusivities. Since K_G is proportional to the square root of the diffusivity over the other terms, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: since the problem states that the resistances are equal, then the contribution of each phase to the mass transfer is the same. So, the overall K_G would be a combination of the gas phase coefficient (k_G) and the liquid phase coefficient (k_L). But in this case, because the resistances are equal, perhaps the overall K_G is proportional to the square root of the product of the diffusivities? Or maybe just proportional to the diffusivity of the gas?

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The problem says that the resistance of the gas and liquid films are equal. So, 1/k_G = 1/k_L, meaning k_G = k_L? Or maybe that the resistances are equal, so the product terms are the same. Alternatively, perhaps the individual film coefficients are the same, but that doesn't make sense because the diffusivities are different.

Wait, perhaps I should model it properly. The mass transfer can be described by two-film theory, where the overall coefficient is given by 1/K_G = 1/k_G + 1/k_L. But in this case, since the resistances are equal, 1/k_G = 1/k_L, so each term is the same. Then 1/K_G = 2/k_G, so K_G = k_G / 2.

But wait, how do k_G and k_L relate to the diffusivities and other properties? Oh right, the individual coefficients (k_G and k_L) are proportional to the square root of their respective diffusivities (assuming similar flow conditions and that it's in the same type of equipment). So, maybe k_G is proportional to sqrt(D_G) and k_L is proportional to sqrt(D_L). But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, in a wetted wall column, the gas-phase coefficient might depend on the gas diffusivity and the liquid-phase on the liquid diffusivity.

Wait, but in this problem, the two different systems are SO2 and NH3. For SO2, K_G is given, and for NH3, we need to find it. The other conditions are the same, so perhaps the ratio of K_G values depends on the ratio of the square roots of their diffusivities.

But wait, the temperatures are different. The SO2 case is at 70°F, and the NH3 is at 49°F. Oh, but wait, the diffusivities given are at 49°F. So maybe the SO2's diffusivity at 70°F isn't given, but perhaps that's not needed. Because the problem states that other conditions are the same except for the diffusivities. Hmm.

Wait, the problem might be suggesting that since the resistances are equal, the overall K_G is proportional to the square root of the gas diffusivity. Because when both films contribute equally, perhaps the overall coefficient depends on the product of the two, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that in cases where the two film resistances are equal, the overall K_G is proportional to sqrt(D), where D is the gas diffusivity. Or maybe it's a combination of gas and liquid diffusivities.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio. For the SO2 case, the K_G1 is given, and for the NH3 case, K_G2 is to be found.

If K_G is proportional to sqrt(D), then K_G2/K_G1 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, but what's D in each case? For SO2, the given D is 0.115 cm²/sec at 49°F. Wait no, the SO2 D is at 49°F as well? Wait, the question says the diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 at 49°F are 0.115 and 0.168 cm²/sec, respectively. So when calculating for NH3, its D is higher than SO2's.

So, if K_G is proportional to sqrt(D), then K_G for NH3 would be higher than for SO2. But let me think carefully.

Wait, the initial K_G for SO2 is 0.068 lbmol/(hr·sqft·atm). The question says, when all other conditions are the same, so the same temperature? Wait, no, the first condition is at 70°F, and the second is at 49°F. Hmm, but the diffusivity values given are both at 49°F. So perhaps the original K_G for SO2 was at 70°F, but when we change to 49°F, everything else (like the other properties) adjusts to the new temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that for NH3 absorption, the conditions are the same as the SO2 case except for the diffusivities. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the ratio of K_G values depends on the ratio of the square roots of the diffusivities. Because the resistance being equal might imply that K_G is proportional to sqrt(D), but I'm not entirely sure.

So, let's model it. Assuming that K_G is proportional to sqrt(D), then K_G2 = K_G1 * sqrt(D2/D1).

Given that K_G1 is for SO2 with D1=0.115, and K_G2 is for NH3 with D2=0.168.

So K_G2 = 0.068 * sqrt(0.168/0.115).

Calculating that: 0.168 / 0.115 ≈ 1.4609. The square root is approx 1.21. So 0.068 * 1.21 ≈ 0.082.

Looking at the options, the closest value is option A: 0.085, but perhaps more precisely, let's do exact calculation.

Wait, 0.168 / 0.115 = (168/1000)/(115/1000) )= 168/115 ≈ 1.4609.

The square root of 1.4609: Let me calculate it. 1.21^2=1.4641, which is just a bit over. So sqrt(1.4609)≈ 1.2087.

So 0.068 * 1.2087 ≈ 0.068 * 1.2087.

Calculating 0.068 * 1.2 is 0.0816, and 0.068 * 0.0087 is about 0.000592. So total ≈ 0.0822 lbmol/(hr·sqft·atm).

But looking at the options, the closest one is perhaps option J: 0.092 or A: 0.085. Wait, maybe I missed a step.

Wait, perhaps the temperature difference affects the viscosity or other properties, but the problem states that all other conditions are the same. Hmm, maybe the temperatures are different, but the given K_G for SO2 is at 70°F, while NH3 is at 49°F. So perhaps the effect of temperature on the diffusivity must be considered.

Wait, but the diffusivity values are given at 49°F for both, so perhaps the K_G for NH3 at 49°F is what's being calculated, assuming that the other conditions (like viscosity, etc.) are the same as in the original case. So perhaps the only factor is the change in diffusivity.

Wait, but in the SO2 case, the temperature is 70°F, but the diffusivities given are at 49°F. Hmm, perhaps that's a confusion point.

Wait, the question says "the value of the coefficient K_G in a wetted wall column for the absorption of SO_2 in air by water at 70°F is 0.068...", and "the diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 at 49°F are 0.115 and 0.168 cm^2/sec, respectively."

So, perhaps the original K_G for SO2 is at 70°F, but when the problem asks for NH3 at 49°F, and using the given D's at that temperature, perhaps other factors like viscosity and density would change, but the problem says other conditions are the same. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the only change is the diffusivity, and the K_G scales with the square root of the diffusivity ratio.

Wait, but the problem says "all other conditions are the same", so maybe the temperature is the same as the original condition for SO2, which was 70°F, but the diffusivities are given at 49°F. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the given K_G for SO2 is at 70°F, but when calculating for NH3 at 49°F, the diffusivities are given at 49°F. So perhaps we need to adjust for the temperature change as well.

Wait, but the question is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the question.

"The value of the coefficient K_G in a wetted wall column for the absorption of SO2 in air by water at 70°F is 0.068lbmol/hr·sqft·atm. The resistance of gas and liquid films are equal in the absorption of SO2. The diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 at 49°F are 0.115 and 0.168 cm²/sec, respectively. Find the value of K_G for the absorption of NH3 in water at 49°F when all other conditions are the same."

Ah, so the K_G for SO2 is at 70°F, but for NH3, the conditions are at 49°F, and all other conditions are same except for the diffusivity.

Wait, but the problem is about K_G, which I think is a function of the system's properties, including temperature.

But perhaps the approach is that since the two systems have the same other conditions, the ratio of their K_G values depends on the square root of the ratio of their diffusivities.

Wait, but K_G is proportional to (D)^0.5, assuming all else being equal. So if the other conditions are the same, then K_G2 = K_G1 * sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, but in the SO2 case, the K_G was at 70°F, but the D is given at 49°F. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the K_G for NH3 at 49°F would be lower than the K_G for SO2 at 70°F, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the K_G is inversely proportional to the viscosity, but since the problem states other conditions are same, perhaps the viscosity is same, so only D matters.

But perhaps the key is that when the resistances are equal, the overall K_G is (k_G * k_L)^(1/2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, K_G = k_G * k_L / (k_G + k_L). But if k_G = k_L, then K_G = k_G^2/(2k_G) ) = k_G/2.

So if K_G is proportional to k_G, which is proportional to sqrt(D_G), then K_G would be proportional to sqrt(D_G). Similarly, if the same applies for the liquid phase, but perhaps since it's a gas, K_G is proportional to sqrt(D_G).

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the case where gas and liquid resistances are equal, K_G is proportional to sqrt(D_G * D_L), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when 1/K_G = (1/k_G) + (1/k_L), and if 1/k_G = 1/k_L, then 1/K_G = 2/k_G, so K_G = k_G / 2.

But if k_G is proportional to sqrt(D_G), then K_G would be proportional to sqrt(D_G). Similarly, if the same applies to k_L, but since the liquid is water, perhaps its D_L is the same in both cases, assuming it's water for both. So perhaps the K_G for NH3 would be K_G1 * sqrt(D_NH3 / D_SO2).

Wait, but in the problem, the K_G for SO2 is given, and perhaps D_SO2 is the D for SO2 in gas phase, and D_NH3 is NH3's D in gas phase.

Wait, but the given D's are for the gas phase? Or are they for the liquid phase? The question says "diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 at 49°F", but it doesn't specify the phase. Hmm, since we're dealing with gas absorption into liquid, the gas-phase diffusivity would be D_G, and the liquid-phase D_L is much smaller, but in this problem, the resistances are equal, so D_L must be such that the product terms are same.

Wait, but perhaps the given D's are for the gas phase. Because in gas absorption, the gas-phase D would influence the gas film resistance, and the liquid-phase D would influence the liquid film resistance. But the problem states that the resistances are equal, so perhaps the ratio of the D's in their respective phases are adjusted such that the resistances are same.

Wait, but in this problem, when switching from SO2 to NH3, perhaps the gas-phase D changes, and the liquid-phase D also changes. But the problem gives the D's at 49°F. So maybe for NH3, the D_G is 0.168 cm²/sec, and for SO2 it's 0.115. So their ratio is 0.168/0.115.

So if K_G is proportional to sqrt(D_G), then the new K_G would be K_G1 * sqrt(0.168/0.115).

Calculating that:

sqrt(0.168 / 0.115) = sqrt(1.4609) ≈ 1.2087.

So K_G2 = 0.068 lbmol/(hr·sqft·atm) * 1.2087 ≈ 0.0822.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.085, which is close, but perhaps more accurate calculation is needed.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

0.168 ÷ 0.115 = 1.460869565.

Square root of 1.460869565:

Let me compute it step by step. 1.2 squared is 1.44, 1.21 squared is 1.4641, which is a bit higher than 1.46087. So sqrt(1.46087) is approximately 1.2086.

So 0.068 * 1.2086 = ?

0.068 * 1.2 = 0.0816.

0.068 * 0.0086 = approx 0.0005848.

Adding them gives 0.0816 + 0.0005848 ≈ 0.0821848.

So approximately 0.0822 lbmol/(hr·sqft·atm).

Looking at the options:

A: 0.085
J: 0.092
I: 0.135
D: 0.174
E: 0.16

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 0.0822. The closest is option A: 0.085.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that K_G is proportional to sqrt(D). Maybe K_G is proportional to D, not its square root. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the mass transfer coefficient in a wetted wall column (which I think is a type of laminar flow in a vertical tube) is given by the equation k = (D * v) / L, where v is the velocity and L is the length, but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, for a wetted wall column, the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient k_G can be estimated using the relation:

k_G = (D_G * v) / (a_z * Sc)^0.5

Where Sc is the Schmidt number (Sc = v/ D_G). Wait, that would make k_G proportional to D_G^(1/2).

So yes, k_G is proportional to sqrt(D_G). So my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but in the case where the gas and liquid resistances are equal, then 1/K_G = 1/k_G + 1/k_L, and since 1/k_G = 1/k_L, then K_G = k_G / 2.

So if K_G is proportional to k_G, and k_G is proportional to sqrt(D_G), then K_G is proportional to sqrt(D_G). So the ratio of K_G2 to K_G1 is sqrt(D2/D1).

So for the given data, K_G2 = K_G1 * sqrt(D2/D1) = 0.068 * sqrt(0.168/0.115) ≈ 0.0822.

But the options don't have this exact value. The closest is option A: 0.085. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me calculate the exact value more accurately.

Compute 0.168 / 0.115:

0.168 ÷ 0.115 = (168 ÷ 1000) / (115 ÷
