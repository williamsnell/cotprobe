Okay, so I need to figure out which option indicates negative residual autocorrelation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that autocorrelation has to do with the relationship between a time series and lagged versions of itself. Positive autocorrelation means that if the residual is high at one point, the next residual is also likely to be high. Negative autocorrelation would be the opposite; a high residual would be followed by a low one, and vice versa. So it's like an alternating pattern over time.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that shows this up and down alternation. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Complete randomness. That would mean no autocorrelation, neither positive nor negative. So that's probably not it.

Option B: Consistent downward trend. That sounds more like a linear trend, not autocorrelation. Autocorrelation is about the residuals' pattern, not the trend itself. So B might relate to the original data's trend, not residuals.

Option C: Residuals that steadily increase then decrease. That seems like a parabolic shape, maybe indicating some curvature in the model. I'm not sure how that ties to autocorrelation. Maybe not negative.

Option D: Alternating pattern. Oh wait, that fits what I was thinking earlier. If the residuals alternate between positive and negative, that's a sign of negative autocorrelation. Like if one residual is high, the next is low, then high again, creating an oscillating pattern.

Option E: Far from zero. If all residuals are far from zero, that indicates a poor model fit, but not necessarily any autocorrelation direction. So probably not.

Option F: Repeats every few points. That sounds like periodicity or cyclicity, maybe indicating positive autocorrelation over those periods. So maybe not negative.

Option G: Cyclical pattern. Similar to F, this might imply positive autocorrelation within cycles. So not the negative case.

Option H: Close to zero. That's good, means the model explains the data well. No autocorrelation here, so not it.

Option I: Upward trend. Again, like B, a trend in residuals suggests model misspecification but not autocorrelation direction. So probably not.

Option J: Decrease then increase. That sounds like a U-shape, maybe indicating some non-linearity. Not sure about the autocorrelation aspect here.

Wait, going back, the question is about negative residual autocorrelation. Autocorrelation measures the correlation between residuals at different lags. Negative autocorrelation implies that when a residual is positive, the next one is negative, creating a pattern where they switch signs regularly.

So the best fit is D: An alternating pattern in the residuals. Because that's exactly what negative autocorrelation looks like. Alternating high and low values, which would result in a negative correlation coefficient when you calculate it.

I think that's the correct answer. So the answer should be D.

Negative residual autocorrelation occurs when there is an inverse relationship between residuals at different lags, meaning high residuals are followed by low residuals and vice versa, creating an alternating pattern. Among the options:

- **A** indicates no autocorrelation, as randomness implies no pattern.  
- **B** and **I** suggest trends, which relate to model misspecification, not autocorrelation.  
- **C** and **J** describe non-linear patterns but not alternating signs.  
- **D** directly describes an alternating pattern, which aligns with negative autocorrelation.  
- **E**, **H**, **F**, and **G** describe other residual characteristics unrelated to negative autocorrelation.  

Thus, the correct answer is **D: An alternating pattern in the residuals**.
