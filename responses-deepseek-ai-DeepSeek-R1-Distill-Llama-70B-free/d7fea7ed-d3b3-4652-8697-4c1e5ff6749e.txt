Okay, so I've got this problem here about the lifespan of electronic parts, and I'm supposed to figure out the mean and standard deviation assuming a normal distribution. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says that 60% of the parts last over 3 years, and 70% last less than 6 years. Wait, so that means... if 60% are over 3 years, then 40% are under 3 years or equal. Similarly, 70% are under 6, so 30% are over 6. Hmm, but wait, the problem says 70% last less than 6 years, so that's correct.

Since it's a normal distribution, I can use z-scores. I remember that in a normal distribution, the mean is the center, and the standard deviation tells us how spread out the data is. So I'll need to relate these percentages to z-scores.

Let me think about the 3-year mark first. 40% are below 3 years, which means the z-score for 3 corresponds to the 40th percentile. Similarly, for 6 years, 70% are below 6, so the 70th percentile. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 70% last less than 6 years, so 30% are above 6. So the z-score for 6 would correspond to the 70th percentile? Or wait, no. Let me correct that.

In a normal distribution, the z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a value is. The cumulative probability up to a certain z-score can be found from standard normal distribution tables.

So, for the 3-year point: P(X < 3) = 40% because 60% are above 3. So the cumulative probability up to 3 is 0.4. Similarly, for 6 years, P(X <6)=70%, so cumulative is 0.7.

I think I can set up two equations using the z-score formula. The z-score is (X - μ)/σ. So for X=3, z1 = (3 - μ)/σ, and the cumulative probability for z1 is 0.4. Similarly, for X=6, z2 = (6 - μ)/σ, and the cumulative probability is 0.7.

Now I can look up the z-scores corresponding to 0.4 and 0.7. Let me recall the standard normal distribution table. For 0.4 cumulative probability, the z-score is about -0.25. Because the closest value I can remember is that z= -0.25 corresponds to around 0.4013. Hmm, wait, maybe I should think more accurately. Let me think, the z-table for 0.4... The closest exact value would be z = -0.25 (which is approximately 0.4013). So for the first equation, z1 is approximately -0.25.

For the second point, 0.7 cumulative probability. I remember that z=0.5 gives about 0.6915, so maybe around 0.52? Wait, let me think. Wait, 0.7 is exactly at z=0.5244? Wait no, wait. Let's get this right. The z-score for 0.7 cumulative is about 0.524 or something? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the empirical rule. Actually, the exact z for 0.7 is approximately 0.5244. Because, for example, for P(Z <= z) = 0.7, looking up the z-table, the closest z is about 0.524. I think I remember that the z for 0.75 is about 0.6745, so 0.7 is lower than that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the exact values, but since I can't refer to a table, I'll proceed with approximate z-scores.

So, for the first equation: (3 - μ)/σ = z1 = -0.25.

Second equation: (6 - μ)/σ = z2 = 0.524.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, because for X=6, the cumulative probability is 0.7, so the z-score is positive, meaning that 6 is above the mean. So z2 is positive. So yeah, that makes sense.

So now I have two equations:

1) (3 - μ)/σ = -0.25

2) (6 - μ)/σ = 0.524

I can solve these two equations for μ and σ.

Let me call equation 1 as Eq1 and equation 2 as Eq2.

Let me rearrange Eq1:

3 - μ = -0.25 * σ → μ = 3 + 0.25σ → Eq1a.

Similarly, Eq2: 6 - μ = 0.524σ → μ = 6 - 0.524σ → Eq2a.

Now, set Eq1a equal to Eq2a:

3 + 0.25σ = 6 - 0.524σ

Let me solve for σ.

Bring terms with σ to one side and constants to the other.

0.25σ + 0.524σ = 6 -3 → 0.774σ =3 → σ=3/0.774 ≈ 3.876.

Wait, let me calculate that. 3 divided by 0.774.

Hmm, 0.774 times 3 is 2.322, wait, no, I'm calculating 3/0.774.

0.774 is approximately 0.774. So 3 divided by 0.774. Let me compute 3 ÷ 0.774.

Let me approximate:

0.774 * 3.8 = ?

0.774 * 3 = 2.322, 0.774 * 0.8=0.6192 → 2.322 + 0.6192=2.9412 → which is less than 3.

3.8 → 2.9412

Difference: 3 -2.9412=0.0588.

Now, 0.774 * 0.076 ≈ 0.0588.

So 3.8 + 0.076 ≈ 3.876.

So σ≈3.876.

Now, using Eq1a, μ=3 + 0.25 * σ.

So μ=3 + 0.25 * 3.876 → 3 + 0.969 → 3.969.

Wait, that's approximately 3.969, which is about 3.97.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again because the options don't exactly have these numbers. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J: μ=4.077, σ=3.661

Option H: μ=3.977, σ=3.861

Option I: μ=3.977, σ=3.761

Option E: μ=4.277, σ=3.861

Option A: μ=3.677, σ=3.661

Wait, my calculation gives μ ≈3.969, which is about 3.97, and σ≈3.876. So looking at the options, option H is μ=3.977, σ=3.861. Close but not exact. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the z-scores.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong z-scores. Let me double-check the z-scores for 0.4 and 0.7.

Wait, for P(Z < z) = 0.4, the z-score is approximately -0.2533 (from standard tables). Similarly, for 0.7, it's approximately 0.5255.

So perhaps I should use more precise z-values. Let's recalculate.

So Eq1: (3 - μ)/σ = -0.2533

Eq2: (6 - μ)/σ = 0.5255

Rearranging:

From Eq1, μ =3 + 0.2533σ

From Eq2, μ =6 - 0.5255σ

Set equal: 3 + 0.2533σ =6 -0.5255σ

Bring like terms together:

0.2533σ + 0.5255σ =6-3 → 0.7788σ =3 → σ=3/0.7788≈3.85.

Compute 3 ÷0.7788: 0.7788 *3.85= ?

0.7788 *3 = 2.3364

0.7788 *0.85= approx 0.7788*(0.8 +0.05)= 0.62304 + 0.03894=0.66198.

So 2.3364 +0.66198=2.99838≈3. So σ≈3.85.

Then, μ=3 +0.2533 *3.85 ≈3 + (0.2533 *3.85).

Compute 0.2533 *3.85:

0.25 *3.85=0.9625

0.0033 *3.85≈0.012705

Total ≈0.9625 +0.0127≈0.9752.

So μ≈3 +0.9752=3.9752, approximately 3.975.

So now, mu is about 3.975 and sigma about 3.85.

Looking at the options, option H is mu=3.977, sigma=3.861. That's very close to our calculations. So option H.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option H: μ=3.977, σ=3.861.

Yes, that's the closest match. So the answer should be option H.

To determine the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the lifespan of the electronic parts under a normal distribution, we analyze the given data:

1. **Given Data**:
   - 60% of the parts last over 3 years → P(X < 3) = 0.4.
   - 70% of the parts last less than 6 years → P(X < 6) = 0.7.

2. **Z-Scores**:
   Using standard normal distribution tables:
   - For P(X < 3) = 0.4, the z-score is approximately **-0.2533**.
   - For P(X < 6) = 0.7, the z-score is approximately **0.5255**.

3. **Z-Score Equations**:
   The z-score formula is \( z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \). Using the data:
   - For \( X = 3 \): \( -0.2533 = \frac{3 - \mu}{\sigma} \).
   - For \( X = 6 \): \( 0.5255 = \frac{6 - \mu}{\sigma} \).

4. **Solving for μ and σ**:
   Rearrange the equations:
   - From \( -0.2533 = \frac{3 - \mu}{\sigma} \): \( \mu = 3 + 0.2533\sigma \).
   - From \( 0.5255 = \frac{6 - \mu}{\sigma} \): \( \mu = 6 - 0.5255\sigma \).

   Set the two expressions for \( \mu \) equal:
   \[
   3 + 0.2533\sigma = 6 - 0.5255\sigma
   \]
   Combine terms:
   \[
   0.7788\sigma = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sigma = \frac{3}{0.7788} \approx 3.85
   \]

   Substitute \( \sigma \approx 3.85 \) into \( \mu = 3 + 0.2533\sigma \):
   \[
   \mu = 3 + 0.2533(3.85) \approx 3 + 0.975 \approx 3.975
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   The calculated values are \( \mu \approx 3.975 \) and \( \sigma \approx 3.85 \). The closest match is **Option H**: \( \mu = 3.977, \sigma = 3.861 \).
