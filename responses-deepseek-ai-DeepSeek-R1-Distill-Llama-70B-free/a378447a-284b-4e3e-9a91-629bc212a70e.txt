Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about CBT.

From what I remember, CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the interconnection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The idea is that by changing one's thoughts, you can influence their emotions and actions. It's often used to treat various mental health issues like depression, anxiety disorders, and more.

The question is asking about the goal of CBT. Let me look at the options:

A: Enhance physical strength. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. CBT is more about mental processes, not physical aspects.

B: Reward good behavior. Wait, that sounds more like behavioral therapy, specifically positive reinforcement. But CBT is a bit broader than that, I think.

C: Develop artistic skills. No, that's unrelated. CBT isn't about learning new skills in art.

D: Increase emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence involves recognizing and managing emotions, which seems related, but is that the primary goal of CBT? I'm not entirely sure. CBT does help people manage their emotions by changing their thought patterns, so maybe this is a possibility.

E: Maximize athletic performance. That's more about sports psychology, not CBT's main goal.

F: Improve memory retention. I don't think CBT is focused on memory. That's more like cognitive training or mnemonic techniques.

G: Achieve stoic wisdom. Stoicism is a philosophy that involves improving one's thoughts and emotions, but I'm not sure if CBT's goal is specifically stoic wisdom. It's more about mental health than philosophy.

H: Promote spiritual growth. CBT is secular, I believe, focusing on mental health rather than spirituality.

I: Build grit. Grit is about perseverance and passion for long-term goals. While CBT might help someone develop resilience, I'm not sure if that's its main goal.

So, thinking back, the core of CBT is to help individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their mental health issues. The goal is to improve emotional well-being by modifying these cognitive processes.

Option B mentions rewarding good behavior, which is part of behavioral therapy techniques, like positive reinforcement, which CBT might use. But the primary goal is more about changing thoughts and behaviors to improve mental health outcomes.

Option D, increasing emotional intelligence, is about understanding and managing emotions. CBT does help with that, but is that the primary goal? Or is it more about addressing specific issues like reducing symptoms of depression or anxiety?

Wait, maybe another angle. The question is about the goal, not the method. So what does CBT aim to achieve? It's to help people manage their mental health by altering harmful thought patterns. So, perhaps the goal is to improve emotional regulation, which ties into emotional intelligence.

Alternatively, looking at the options again, none of them directly say "improve mental health" or "reduce symptoms of mental disorders." So I need to pick the best fit from the given options.

Another thought: CBT teaches individuals to become aware of their negative thoughts and reframe them in a more constructive way. This process can lead to better emotional management, which is part of emotional intelligence.

So, putting it all together, the best answer seems to be D: increase emotional intelligence.
