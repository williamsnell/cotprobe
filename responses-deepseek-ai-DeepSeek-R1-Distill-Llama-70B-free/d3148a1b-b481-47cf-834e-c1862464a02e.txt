Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Find 4 and 3/4 percent of $24.85. Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on percentages, but I'll try to remember.

First, I think 4 and 3/4 percent is the same as 4.75%. Because 3/4 is 0.75, right? So 4 + 0.75 equals 4.75. So I'm looking for 4.75% of 24.85.

Wait, how do I calculate a percentage of a number again? Oh right, you convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So 4.75% becomes 0.0475. Then multiply that by 24.85.

Let me write this out. 24.85 multiplied by 0.0475. I'm not exactly sure how to do this off the top of my head, so maybe I can approximate or break it down.

Alternatively, I remember that 1% of a number is just that number divided by 100. So 1% of 24.85 is 0.2485. Then 4% would be 4 times that, which is 0.2485 * 4. Let's calculate that: 0.2485 * 4 is 0.994. So that's 4%.

Now, the 0.75% part. 0.75% is three-quarters of a percent. So 1% is 0.2485, so 0.75% is 0.2485 multiplied by 0.75. Let's see, 0.2485 times 0.75... Hmm, maybe I can calculate that.

Wait, 0.2485 * 0.75: 0.2485 * 0.75 is the same as (0.2485 * 3)/4. So 0.2485 *3 is 0.7455, divided by 4 is 0.186375. So that's approximately 0.1864.

So adding that to the 4% part: 0.994 + 0.1864 equals... Let me add them. 0.994 + 0.1864 is 1.1804. So about $1.1804.

Looking at the options, option I is $1.20, option F is $1.18, and option J is $1.05. Hmm, 1.1804 is approximately $1.18, which would be option F.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. Maybe I should calculate it another way.

Another approach: 4.75% of 24.85. So 24.85 * (4.75/100). Let's compute that.

First, let's compute 24.85 * 4.75. Hmm, but that's a bit tricky without a calculator. Alternatively, I can break it down.

4.75 is 4 + 0.75, so 24.85*4 + 24.85*0.75.

24.85 *4: 24 *4 is 96, 0.85*4 is 3.4, so 96 +3.4=99.4.

24.85 *0.75: Let's compute that. 24 *0.75 is 18, and 0.85 *0.75 is 0.6375. So 18 + 0.6375=18.6375.

Now add 99.4 and 18.6375. 99.4 +18 is 117.4, then +0.6375 is 118.0375.

So 24.85 *4.75 = 118.0375. But wait, that's 4.75 times, but I need 4.75 percent, which would be 4.75 divided by 100. So 118.0375 divided by 100 is 1.180375.

So that's about $1.1804, which is approximately $1.18. So the closest option is F: $1.18.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A through J. Option F is $1.18, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be F.

To find 4 and 3/4 percent of $24.85, first convert 4 and 3/4 percent to a decimal. Since 4.75% is equivalent to 0.0475 in decimal form, multiply this by $24.85:

\[
24.85 \times 0.0475 = 1.180375
\]

This result, $1.180375, rounds to approximately $1.18. Comparing this to the given options, the closest match is **Option F: $1.18**.

Answer: F
