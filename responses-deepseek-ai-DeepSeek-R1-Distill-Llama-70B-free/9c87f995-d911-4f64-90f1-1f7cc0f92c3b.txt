Okay, so I need to help Mr. Balfour decide where to invest his $1,000. He's considering two options: tax-free municipal bonds paying 6% interest and a savings account paying 8% interest. But he's in a 30% marginal tax bracket. Hmm, I remember that taxes can really affect the actual return you get from an investment.

Wait, so the municipal bonds are tax-free. That means he doesn't have to pay any taxes on the interest he earns from them. So the 6% is what he actually gets. But what about the savings account? The 8% interest is taxable, right? So he'll have to pay 30% tax on that interest. Let me calculate that.

So for the savings account, the interest earned would be $1,000 * 8% = $80. But he has to pay 30% tax on that $80. So the tax would be 0.3 * 80 = $24. That leaves him with $56 after taxes. So the after-tax interest rate is $56, which is 5.6% of the principal. 

Wait, because $56 is 56/1000 = 5.6%. So the after-tax return on the savings account is 5.6%. 

Comparing that to the municipal bonds which give 6% tax-free. So 6% is better than 5.6%. So he should go with the municipal bonds because they give a higher after-tax return.

Looking at the options, option A is municipal bonds, and option I is the savings account. So the correct choice should be A.

I think that's it. So he should choose the municipal bonds.

To determine where Mr. Balfour should invest his $1,000, we need to compare the after-tax returns of the two options:

1. **Municipal Bonds**: These are tax-free, so the interest earned is entirely $1,000 * 6% = $60.

2. **Savings Account**: The interest is taxable. The pre-tax interest is $1,000 * 8% = $80. With a 30% marginal tax rate, the tax paid is $80 * 30% = $24. The after-tax interest is $80 - $24 = $56, which equates to an after-tax return of 5.6%.

Since the tax-free municipal bonds yield a higher after-tax return (6%) compared to the savings account (5.6%), Mr. Balfour should invest in the municipal bonds.

**Answer:** A
