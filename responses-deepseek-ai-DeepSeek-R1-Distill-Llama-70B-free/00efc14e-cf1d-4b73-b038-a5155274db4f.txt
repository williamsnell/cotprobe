Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the absorption of light in a glass plate. The glass has an absorption coefficient alpha (α) of 0.05 mm^-1. The plate is 4 mm thick, and I need to find out what percentage of light is transmitted through it. The options are given from A to J, so I need to calculate it correctly and match the result to one of those options.

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through a medium, the transmission can be calculated using Beer-Lambert Law or something similar. Wait, what's the exact formula again? I think the Beer-Lambert Law states that the absorbance (A) is equal to the product of the molar absorptivity (which is related to the absorption coefficient here), the path length (l), and the concentration (c). But since this is solid glass, I don't think concentration comes into play. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Oh right! For a medium without concentration dependence, the transmitted light intensity (I) compared to the incident intensity (I0) can be found using the formula I = I0 * e^(-α * d), where α is the absorption coefficient and d is the thickness of the material. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because sometimes I've seen it written as I/I0 = e^(-α d), and sometimes it's I/I0 = 10^(-A), where A is the absorbance, which is α times d times log e (10) or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to just stick with the exponential form since that's more direct.

Wait, another thought: wait, the absorption coefficient given here is in mm^-1, so the units are reciprocal millimeters. The thickness is in mm, so when I multiply them, the units would cancel out, leaving a dimensionless exponent, which makes sense.

So the formula to use is I/I0 = e^(-α d). Since the question is about percentage transmitted, that would be (I/I0) * 100%.

So let's plug in the numbers. α is 0.05 mm^-1, and d is 4 mm. So α*d = 0.05 *4 = 0.2.

So I/I0 = e^(-0.2). Now I need to calculate e^(-0.2). Wait, e^(-x) is the same as 1/(e^x). So I can calculate e^0.2 and then take the reciprocal.

What's e^0.2 approximately? I know that e^0.2 is about 1.2214, because e^0 is 1, and e^0.2 is a bit more. Let me think: e^0.1 is approximately 1.1052, e^0.2 would be (e^0.1)^2, which is roughly (1.1052)^2. Let's calculate that: 1.1052 * 1.1052. 1 *1 is 1, 1*0.1052 is 0.1052, 0.1052*1 is another 0.1052, and 0.1052*0.1052 is about 0.01108. So adding them up: 1 + 0.1052 + 0.1052 + 0.01108. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 1.1052 squared is approximately 1.2214. So e^0.2 is about 1.2214. Therefore, e^-0.2 is 1/1.2214 ≈ 0.8187.

Wait, that's approximately 81.87% transmission. So looking at the options, option B is 81.87%, which would be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Wait, another approach: let's use a calculator approach for e^-0.2. Let me think, e^0.2 is approximately 1.221402758. So the reciprocal would be approximately 0.818730753, which is 81.8730753%. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 81.87%, which matches option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 81.87%, so that's the one. But hold on, let me make sure I didn't confuse the formula. Oh wait, another thought: wait, sometimes the formula is written as I/I0 = e^(-α d), but in some contexts, especially with optics, they might use the natural logarithm. But I think that's correct here. Also, the units are mm, so that's consistent.

Another point: the absorption coefficient's units are per mm, so when multiplied by mm thickness, it's unitless. So everything looks correct. So the percentage transmitted is approximately 81.87%, which is option B.

To determine the percentage of light transmitted through a 4 mm thick glass plate with an absorption coefficient of \( \alpha = 0.05 \, \text{mm}^{-1} \), we use the formula:

\[
\frac{I}{I_0} = e^{-\alpha d}
\]

where:
- \( \alpha = 0.05 \, \text{mm}^{-1} \) is the absorption coefficient,
- \( d = 4 \, \text{mm} \) is the thickness of the plate,
- \( \frac{I}{I_0} \) is the fraction of light transmitted.

First, calculate \( \alpha d \):
\[
\alpha d = 0.05 \times 4 = 0.2
\]

Next, compute \( e^{-0.2} \). Using approximations:
\[
e^{-0.2} \approx 0.8187
\]

Thus, the fraction of light transmitted is approximately 81.87%. Converting this to a percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage transmitted} = 0.8187 \times 100 = 81.87\%
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: 81.87%**

Answer: B
