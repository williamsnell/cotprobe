Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 6a equals 72, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Hmm, I remember that when you have an equation like this, you want to isolate the variable, which in this case is 'a'. 

Wait, how do I do that again? Oh right, the goal is to get 'a' by itself on one side of the equation. Right now, 'a' is being multiplied by 6. So I think the opposite operation would be division. Because multiplication and division are inverse operations.

So if 6 is multiplied by 'a', I should divide both sides by 6 to keep the equation balanced. That way, I'm not changing the equality, just simplifying it. Let me write that down: if I take 6a = 72 and divide both sides by 6, what happens? 

On the left side, 6 divided by 6 is 1, so it becomes 1*a, which is just 'a'. On the right side, 72 divided by 6 is... um, let's see, 6 times 12 is 72, so 72 divided by 6 is 12. So 'a' equals 12. That makes sense.

Looking back at the options provided, option A says to divide both sides by 6. That's exactly what I did. So the correct step is option A. 

I don't think any other options make sense here. Like, multiplying both sides by 6 would make the equation larger and 'a' would be even harder to find. Adding or subtracting 6 or 72 doesn't seem right because that would mess up the equality. So yeah, I'm confident the answer is A.

To solve for \( a \) in the equation \( 6a = 72 \), we need to isolate \( a \). Since \( a \) is multiplied by 6, we divide both sides of the equation by 6 to maintain balance. This simplifies to \( a = 12 \). The correct step is to divide both sides by 6.

Answer: A
