Okay, so I've got this electromagnetism problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have two media. Medium 1 is on the left side of the yz-plane, and Medium 2 is on the right. The yz-plane is where the boundary is, so x=0 I guess. Medium 1 has k1 = 1.5, and Medium 2 has k2 = 2.5. The electric field E1 is given as (x̂2 - ŷ3 + ẑ) V/m. Wait, the notation might be a bit different. Oh, right, I think it's E₁ = (2x̂ - 3ŷ + ẑ) V/m⁻¹? Or maybe it's E₁ = (2x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ) V/m, but the units are a bit confusing. Wait, the question says E1 is in Vm⁻¹, so electric field strength.

So, I need to find D1, E2, and D2. The options are a bit complicated, but I can approach this methodically.

I remember that when dealing with electromagnetic waves at a boundary, like between two media, the electric and magnetic fields have certain boundary conditions. The key ones are the continuity of the tangential component of E and the normal component of D across the boundary. Also, the wave must satisfy the wave equations in each medium, which probably relates to the wavevectors and the fields.

Wait, but wait—this might be about the electric displacement field D. Oh right, D is related to E via the permittivity. D = ε E, where ε is the permittivity of the medium. And since these are media, maybe they have relative permittivities ε_r, so ε = ε0 * ε_r. Or wait, I think k is the relative permittivity. Oh wait, no. Wait, k is the relative permittivity (also called the dielectric constant), so ε = ε0 * k. So D = ε E = ε0 k E.

But wait, in this problem, E1 is given. So in Medium 1, D1 would be ε1 times E1. Since ε1 = ε0 k1, that's ε0 * 1.5 E1.

Looking at E1: it's (x̂2 - ŷ3 + ẑ). So D1 would be 1.5 ε0 (2x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ) V/m. Let me calculate that. So each component is multiplied by 1.5. So 2 *1.5 is 3, -3*1.5 is -4.5, and 1*1.5 is 1.5. So D1 becomes ε0 (3x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ) V/m, right?

Wait, no. Wait, E is in V/m, and D is in C/m². But the problem just asks for D in terms of ε0 times the components, so I don't have to worry about units beyond that.

Now, for E2. At the boundary between two media, the tangential component of E must be continuous. So the tangential components of E1 and E2 must be the same at the interface (x=0). But wait, E1 has a normal component (the x-component, since x is perpendicular to the yz-plane) and tangential components (y and z). So the tangential parts are the y and z components of E. Therefore, E2 must have the same y and z components as E1 at the boundary. But wait, wait—no, because the wave might be refracted, so the wavevector direction changes, but the E field's tangential components must be continuous.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as a plane wave incident from Medium 1 to Medium 2. The wave approaches the boundary, and we have to find the transmitted wave in Medium 2. So the electric field in Medium 2, E2, will have components that depend on the transmission coefficients.

Wait, but perhaps it's simpler. Let's think about the boundary conditions. The tangential components of E must be continuous across the boundary. So, since the boundary is the yz-plane (x=0), the y and z components of E must be the same on both sides. So E1_y = E2_y and E1_z = E2_z.

Wait, but in Medium 1, E1 is given as (2x, -3y, z), in some unit. So the y-component is -3, and z-component is 1. So E2 must have those same y and z components. But what about the x-component? The x-component is the normal component, which can have a discontinuity, but D's normal component is continuous.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The boundary conditions are:

1. The tangential component of E is continuous. So E1_tangential = E2_tangential.

2. The normal component of D is continuous. So D1_normal = D2_normal.

Since the boundary is the yz-plane, the normal direction is x. So the x-component of D must be continuous.

So D1_x = D2_x.

But D1 is in Medium 1, which is ε0 k1 times E1. So D1_x is ε0 k1 E1_x. Similarly, D2_x is ε0 k2 E2_x.

So D1_x = D2_x → ε0 k1 E1_x = ε0 k2 E2_x → E2_x = (k1/k2) E1_x.

E1_x is 2, so E2_x = (1.5 / 2.5) * 2.

Wait, 1.5 divided by 2.5 is 0.6. So 0.6 * 2 is 1.2. So E2_x = 1.2.

So E2 has components (1.2, -3, 1) V/m? Wait, but the problem says E1 is in V/m, so the transmitted E2 would be (1.2 x̂ - 3 ŷ + ẑ), or maybe scaled differently.

Wait, no, because the tangential components must match. So E1 has E_y = -3 and E_z = 1. Therefore, E2 must have E_y = -3 and E_z =1. So yes, E2's y and z are the same as E1's.

So E2 is (E2_x x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ). And E2_x is 1.2, so E2 becomes (1.2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ) V/m.

Wait, but let me think again. The wave might be in a different medium, so the wavevector could be different, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the wave is propagating in the x-direction, so the y and z components are the same. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

So now, E2 is (1.2, -3, 1). Then D2 would be ε2 times E2, which is ε0 k2 times E2.

So D2_x = ε0 * 2.5 * 1.2 = 3 ε0.

D2_y = ε0 * 2.5 * (-3) = -7.5 ε0.

D2_z = ε0 * 2.5 * 1 = 2.5 ε0.

So D2 is (3, -7.5, 2.5) times ε0.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see.

Looking at option I: D1 is (3x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ), D2 is (3x̂ -7.5 ŷ + 2.5 ẑ). So that matches what I have for D2.

E1 is (2x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ), E2 is (1.2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ), which is exactly what I calculated.

So let me check the options. Option I says:

E1 = x̂2 - ŷ3 + ẑ,

E2 = x̂1.2 - ŷ3 + ẑ,

D1 = ε0 (x̂3 - ŷ4.5 + ẑ1.5),

D2 = ε0 (x̂3 - ŷ7.5 + ẑ2.5).

Wait, but according to my calculation, D1 would be ε0*(3x̂ -4.5 ŷ +1.5 ẑ). So let me look at the options.

Option I has D1 as (3x̂ -4.5 ŷ +1.5 ẑ) and D2 as (3x̂ -7.5 ŷ +2.5 ẑ), which matches what I got.

Wait, but let me check the other options to be sure.

Looking at option H: E2 is (1.5 x̂ -2.5 ŷ + ẑ), which doesn't match.

Option E: E2 is (1.1 x̂ ...), no.

Option G: E2 is x̂1, which is less than 1.2.

Wait, I think option I is correct.

But wait, let's make sure. So E2 has E_x =1.2, and E_y = -3, E_z =1.

So in the options, option I says E2 = x̂1.2 - ŷ3 + ẑ.

Yes.

So then D1 is ε0 *1.5 * E1.

E1 is 2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ.

So D1 is 1.5*2=3 x̂, 1.5*(-3)=-4.5 ŷ, 1.5*1=1.5 ẑ.

So D1 = ε0 (3x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ).

Which is exactly what option I says for D1.

D2 is 2.5 * E2.

E2 is 1.2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ.

So D2_x =2.5 *1.2=3.

D2_y=2.5*(-3)= -7.5.

D2_z=2.5*1=2.5.

So D2 is (3, -7.5, 2.5) times ε0.

Which matches option I's D2.

So the correct answer must be option I.

To solve the problem, we analyze the electric field **E** and displacement field **D** in two media separated by the yz-plane (x=0). Medium 1 (left of the yz-plane) has a relative permittivity \( k_1 = 1.5 \), and Medium 2 (right of the yz-plane) has \( k_2 = 2.5 \). The electric field in Medium 1 is given as \( \mathbf{E}_1 = (2\hat{x} - 3\hat{y} + \hat{z}) \, \text{V/m} \). The goal is to determine \( \mathbf{D}_1 \), \( \mathbf{E}_2 \), and \( \mathbf{D}_2 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The tangential components of \( \mathbf{E} \) are continuous across the boundary (x=0). Thus, \( E_{1y} = E_{2y} \) and \( E_{1z} = E_{2z} \).
   - The normal component of \( \mathbf{D} \) is continuous across the boundary. Thus, \( D_{1x} = D_{2x} \).

2. **Displacement Field in Medium 1**:
   - \( \mathbf{D}_1 = \epsilon_0 k_1 \mathbf{E}_1 \).
   - Substituting \( k_1 = 1.5 \) and \( \mathbf{E}_1 = (2\hat{x} - 3\hat{y} + \hat{z}) \), we calculate:
     \[
     \mathbf{D}_1 = \epsilon_0 (1.5 \cdot 2)\hat{x} + \epsilon_0 (1.5 \cdot -3)\hat{y} + \epsilon_0 (1.5 \cdot 1)\hat{z} = \epsilon_0 (3\hat{x} - 4.5\hat{y} + 1.5\hat{z}).
     \]

3. **Electric Field in Medium 2**:
   - From the boundary conditions, \( E_{2y} = E_{1y} = -3 \) and \( E_{2z} = E_{1z} = 1 \).
   - The x-component of \( \mathbf{E}_2 \) is determined using the continuity of \( D_x \): \( D_{1x} = D_{2x} \).
   - \( D_{1x} = \epsilon_0 k_1 E_{1x} = \epsilon_0 (1.5 \cdot 2) = 3\epsilon_0 \).
   - \( D_{2x} = \epsilon_0 k_2 E_{2x} \), so:
     \[
     E_{2x} = \frac{D_{1x}}{\epsilon_0 k_2} = \frac{3\epsilon_0}{\epsilon_0 \cdot 2.5} = \frac{3}{2.5} = 1.2.
     \]
   - Thus, \( \mathbf{E}_2 = (1.2\hat{x} - 3\hat{y} + \hat{z}) \, \text{V/m} \).

4. **Displacement Field in Medium 2**:
   - \( \mathbf{D}_2 = \epsilon_0 k_2 \mathbf{E}_2 \).
   - Substituting \( k_2 = 2.5 \) and \( \mathbf{E}_2 = (1.2\hat{x} - 3\hat{y} + \hat{z}) \), we calculate:
     \[
     \mathbf{D}_2 = \epsilon_0 (2.5 \cdot 1.2)\hat{x} + \epsilon_0 (2.5 \cdot -3)\hat{y} + \epsilon_0 (2.5 \cdot 1)\hat{z} = \epsilon_0 (3\hat{x} - 7.5\hat{y} + 2.5\hat{z}).
     \]

### Final Results:
- \( \mathbf{D}_1 = \epsilon_0 (3\hat{x} - 4.5\hat{y} + 1.5\hat{z}) \),
- \( \mathbf{E}_2 = (1.2\hat{x} - 3\hat{y} + \hat{z}) \, \text{V/m} \),
- \( \mathbf{D}_2 = \epsilon_0 (3\hat{x} - 7.5\hat{y} + 2.5\hat{z}) \).

### Correct Option:
Comparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is **Option I**.
