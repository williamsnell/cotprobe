Okay, so I've got this gas law problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says there's a 5000 cm³ container holding 4.90 grams of a gas. The pressure is 75.0 cm Hg, and the temperature is 50°C. Then, the question is asking what the pressure will be when 6.00 grams of the same gas is put into a 2000 cm³ container at 0°C.

Hmm, alright, so this seems like a gas law problem, probably involving the combined gas law or maybe using PV = nRT. I remember that the combined gas law is useful when comparing two states of the same gas, which might be the case here.

Wait, but the problem is about two different situations. The first situation is the initial state, and the second is the final state. So maybe I can set up a ratio using the combined gas law, which is (P1 V1)/T1 = (P2 V2)/T2. But wait, that's when the number of moles is the same. Oh, but in this case, the mass of the gas is changing, so the number of moles changes. That complicates things because n isn't constant anymore.

So maybe I should approach this using the ideal gas law for each situation separately and then relate them. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin.

First, I need to calculate the number of moles in each case. Because the mass is given, I can find moles by dividing by the molar mass. But wait, I don't know what the gas is. Oh, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the molar mass will cancel out in the end, so I don't actually need to know the specific gas.

Let me structure this:

Let’s denote the initial state as State 1 and the final state as State 2.

State 1:
- Mass (m1) = 4.90 g
- Volume (V1) = 5000 cm³
- Pressure (P1) = 75.0 cm Hg
- Temperature (T1) = 50°C = 323.15 K

State 2:
- Mass (m2) = 6.00 g
- Volume (V2) = 2000 cm³
- Pressure (P2) = ? (We need to find this)
- Temperature (T2) = 0°C = 273.15 K

Since the gas is the same in both states, its molar mass (M) is the same. So, the number of moles in each state can be written as:

n1 = m1 / M
n2 = m2 / M

So for each state, the ideal gas law applies:

P1 V1 = n1 R T1 → P1 V1 = (m1/M) R T1
P2 V2 = n2 R T2 → P2 V2 = (m2/M) R T2

I can write these as two equations and then divide them to eliminate R and M.

Equation 1: P1 V1 = (m1/M) R T1
Equation 2: P2 V2 = (m2/M) R T2

Dividing equation 1 by equation 2:

(P1 V1) / (P2 V2) = (m1 T1) / (m2 T2)

Because the M and R terms cancel out.

So rearranging to solve for P2:

P2 = (P1 V1 * m2 T2) / (V2 m1 T1)

Wait, let me make sure I rearrange correctly. Let me write the ratio again.

From (P1 V1)/(P2 V2) = (m1 T1)/(m2 T2)

So, cross-multiplying:

P1 V1 * m2 T2 = P2 V2 * m1 T1

So, solving for P2:

P2 = (P1 V1 m2 T2) / (V2 m1 T1)

Yes, that looks right.

Now, plugging in the numbers:

P1 = 75.0 cm Hg
V1 = 5000 cm³
m2 = 6.00 g
T2 = 273.15 K
V2 = 2000 cm³
m1 = 4.90 g
T1 = 323.15 K

Wait, but I should make sure all units are compatible. Since all the volumes are in cm³ and pressure in cm Hg, and R is in terms that would cancel out, I think the units here are consistent as long as the temperatures are in Kelvin, which they are.

So plugging in the numbers:

P2 = (75.0 * 5000 * 6.00 * 273.15) / (2000 * 4.90 * 323.15)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, numerator:

75.0 * 5000 = 375,000

375,000 * 6.00 = 2,250,000

2,250,000 * 273.15 = Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute that.

Wait, 2,250,000 * 273.15. Let me break it down:

2,250,000 * 200 = 450,000,000

2,250,000 * 73.15 = Let's compute 2,250,000 *70=157,500,000; 2,250,000*3.15=7,087,500. So 157,500,000 +7,087,500=164,587,500.

So 450,000,000 + 164,587,500=614,587,500.

So numerator is 614,587,500.

Denominator: 2000 *4.90=9,800.

9,800 * 323.15= Let me compute 9,800 *300=2,940,000; 9,800*23.15= let's see, 9,800 *20=196,000; 9,800 *3.15=30,870. So 196,000 +30,870=226,870. So 2,940,000 +226,870=3,166,870.

So denominator is 3,166,870.

So P2 = 614,587,500 / 3,166,870 ≈ Let me compute that.

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this division.

Wait, 614,587,500 ÷ 3,166,870. Let me see if I can approximate this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor some terms to make this easier.

Wait, let me see:

We can write it as:

(75 * 5000 *6 *273.15) / (2000 *4.90 *323.15)

Hmm, perhaps I can cancel some terms before calculating.

Let me see:

5000 / 2000 = 2.5

6/4.90 ≈ 1.2245

273.15/323.15 ≈ 0.8457

So, 75 * 2.5 * 1.2245 * 0.8457.

Let me compute this step by step.

75 *2.5 = 187.5

187.5 *1.2245 ≈ Let me compute 187.5 *1.2=225; 187.5 *0.0245≈4.59375. So total ≈ 229.59375.

Now, 229.59375 * 0.8457 ≈ Let me compute 229.59375 *0.8 = 183.675; 229.59375 *0.0457≈around 10.494. So total ≈ 183.675 +10.494≈194.169.

So P2 ≈194 cm Hg.

Looking at the options, option C is 194 cm Hg.

Wait, but wait a second: I think I made a mistake in the way I handled the units for pressure and volume. Because in the ideal gas law, pressure is usually in atmospheres, but here it's in cm Hg. But wait, since both pressures are in cm Hg, and the volumes are in cm³, perhaps the units will cancel out correctly. Wait, but in the ideal gas law, the units have to be consistent. So pressure in cm Hg might not be directly compatible unless the gas constant R is in terms of cm Hg and cm³. But since in our approach, we're taking a ratio, the units should cancel out, so the final pressure would be in cm Hg as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted the pressures into atmospheres, but since both are in cm Hg, and we're taking a ratio, maybe it's okay.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether the approach is correct. Let me think again.

Another approach: Maybe using the combined gas law with moles changing, but I think the way I did it is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the molar masses more carefully. Let's think again.

The number of moles is m/M, so the ideal gas equation can be written as:

PV = (m/M) RT

So, for the initial state:

P1 V1 = (m1/M) R T1 → equation 1

For the final state:

P2 V2 = (m2/M) R T2 → equation 2

Dividing equation 1 by equation 2:

(P1 V1) / (P2 V2) = (m1 T1) / (m2 T2)

Which rearranges to:

P2 = (P1 V1 m2 T2) / (V2 m1 T1 )

Which is exactly what I did before, so that's correct.

So the calculation gives me approximately 194 cm Hg, which is option C.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Let me recompute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 75.0 *5000 = 375,000

375,000 *6.00 = 2,250,000

2,250,000 *273.15 = Let me compute this as 2,250,000 *273 = 614,250,000, and 2,250,000 *0.15=337,500, so total 614,587,500.

Denominator: 2000 *4.90 = 9,800

9,800 *323.15 = 9,800 *300=2,940,000; 9,800*23.15= let's compute 9,800*20=196,000, 9,800*3.15=30, 870. So 196,000 +30,870=226,870. So 2,940,000 +226,870=3,166,870.

So 614,587,500 / 3,166,870 ≈ let me compute.

Well, 3,166,870 *194 = let's compute:

3,166,870 *200=633,374,000

But 194 is 6 less than 200, so 3,166,870 *6 =18, 9, so 3,166,870 *6=18,  let's compute 3,166,870 *6:

3,000,000 *6=18,000,000

166,870 *6=1,001,220 → total 19,001,220.

So 633,374,000 -19,001,220 =614,372,780.

But our numerator is 614,587,500, which is larger than 614,372,780 by about 214,720.

So 194 gives 614,372,780. The difference is 214,720.

So 214,720 /3,166,870 ≈ approx 0.0678.

So P2≈194.0678 cm Hg, which would round to 194 cm Hg, so option C.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be C: 194 cm Hg.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the ideal gas law in its two-state form, since the gas undergoes a change in mass, volume, and temperature. The relationship is given by:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

However, since the number of moles changes, we incorporate the mass and molar mass into the equation. The number of moles is proportional to the mass divided by the molar mass \( M \), and since \( M \) is constant for the same gas, it cancels out. The modified equation becomes:

\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 m_2 T_2}{V_2 m_1 T_1}
\]

### Given Data:
- **State 1**: \( P_1 = 75.0 \, \text{cm Hg}, V_1 = 5000 \, \text{cm}^3, m_1 = 4.90 \, \text{g}, T_1 = 50^\circ \text{C} = 323.15 \, \text{K} \)
- **State 2**: \( P_2 = ?, V_2 = 2000 \, \text{cm}^3, m_2 = 6.00 \, \text{g}, T_2 = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the equation:

\[
P_2 = \frac{(75.0)(5000)(6.00)(273.15)}{(2000)(4.90)(323.15)}
\]

1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   75.0 \times 5000 = 375,000
   \]
   \[
   375,000 \times 6.00 = 2,250,000
   \]
   \[
   2,250,000 \times 273.15 = 614,587,500
   \]

2. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   2000 \times 4.90 = 9,800
   \]
   \[
   9,800 \times 323.15 = 3,166,870
   \]

3. Divide the numerator by the denominator:
   \[
   P_2 = \frac{614,587,500}{3,166,870} \approx 194 \, \text{cm Hg}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated pressure is approximately **194 cm Hg**, which corresponds to **option C**.
