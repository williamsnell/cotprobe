Okay, so I have this problem about the Black-Scholes framework and using the delta-gamma approximation to find the new price of a put option when the stock price changes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the question gives me some initial data. The stock price is $30, and the put option price is $4.00. The delta (Δ) is -0.28 and gamma (Γ) is 0.10. Now, the stock price increases to $31.50, and I need to find the new put option price using delta-gamma approximation.

Wait, what's the delta-gamma approximation again? Oh right, it's a way to estimate how the option's price changes when the underlying stock price changes. The formula, I think, is something like:

ΔOption Price ≈ Delta * ΔStock + 0.5 * Gamma * (ΔStock)^2

Where ΔStock is the change in the stock price.

So the steps I need to take are:
1. Calculate the change in the stock price (ΔS).
2. Plug ΔS, Delta, and Gamma into the formula to find the approximate change in the option price.
3. Add this change to the original option price to get the new price.

Let me start with step 1. The initial stock price is $30, and it goes up to $31.50. So ΔS is 31.50 - 30.00 = $1.50.

Wait, but sometimes I've seen delta-gamma approximations where the change is represented as a percentage or maybe in decimal terms. But since the stock price is in dollars here, I think it's okay to use the absolute change in dollars.

So ΔS is 1.50.

Now, plug into the formula. Delta is -0.28, so that's the first term. The second term is 0.5 * Gamma * (ΔS)^2.

Calculating each part:

First term: Delta * ΔS = (-0.28) * 1.50 = -0.42.

Second term: 0.5 * 0.10 * (1.50)^2. Let's compute (1.50)^2 first, that's 2.25. Then 0.5 * 0.10 is 0.05. So 0.05 * 2.25 equals 0.1125.

Adding both terms together: -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075.

So the approximate change in the option price is a decrease of $0.3075.

Wait, but wait a minute. The original put option price is $4.00. So the new price would be 4.00 + (-0.3075) = $3.6925.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A through J.

Option E is 3.7, option J is 3.9, D is 3.0. Hmm, 3.6925 is approximately 3.69, which is close to 3.7 (option E). So I think the answer would be E.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the signs or the formula.

So the delta is -0.28 and the stock price increased. Since it's a put option, when the stock price goes up, the put price should go down because puts gain value when the stock goes down. So if the stock increases by $1.50, the put should decrease in price.

In the calculation, the first term was -0.42, which correctly reflects that. The second term, the gamma effect, is positive because gamma is positive for both calls and puts (I think). So the second term adds a small positive value, reducing the overall decrease.

So the total change is -0.3075, so the new price is 4.00 - 0.3075 = 3.6925, which is approximately 3.69. The closest option is E:3.7.

Wait, but let me make sure about the formula. Another way I've seen the approximation is:

Option Price Change ≈ Delta * (S_new - S_old) + 0.5 * Gamma * (S_new - S_old)^2.

Yes, that's what I used. So the calculation seems correct.

So the new price is approximately $3.69, which among the options is E:3.7.

To determine the new price of the put option when the stock price changes from $30 to $31.50 using the delta-gamma approximation, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P \approx \Delta \cdot \Delta S + 0.5 \cdot \Gamma \cdot (\Delta S)^2
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta S = 31.50 - 30.00 = 1.50\),
- \(\Delta = -0.28\),
- \(\Gamma = 0.10\).

### Step 1: Calculate the first term (\(\Delta \cdot \Delta S\)):
\[
\Delta \cdot \Delta S = -0.28 \cdot 1.50 = -0.42
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the second term (\(0.5 \cdot \Gamma \cdot (\Delta S)^2\)):
\[
(\Delta S)^2 = 1.50^2 = 2.25
\]
\[
0.5 \cdot \Gamma \cdot (\Delta S)^2 = 0.5 \cdot 0.10 \cdot 2.25 = 0.1125
\]

### Step 3: Combine the terms to find \(\Delta P\):
\[
\Delta P = -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the new option price:
\[
P_{\text{new}} = P_{\text{old}} + \Delta P = 4.00 + (-0.3075) = 3.6925
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the closest option:
The calculated new price, $3.6925, is closest to option **E: 3.7**.
