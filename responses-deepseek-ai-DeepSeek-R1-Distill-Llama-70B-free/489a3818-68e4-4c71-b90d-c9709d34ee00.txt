Question:

If XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room then

Options:

A: GDP increases because the painting is considered a luxury good.
B: GDP is unaffected because it is a second hand sale.
C: GDP is unaffected because the painting is considered a non-monetary asset.
D: GI)P decreases because I decreases.
E: GDP is unaffected because the painting is considered a depreciating asset.
F: GDP increases because it is considered an investment in art.
G: GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because C decreases.
H: GDP decreases because the painting is considered an unproductive asset.
I: GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because G decreases.
J: GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here. It's about GDP and how certain transactions affect it. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its boardroom. I need to figure out what happens to GDP as a result. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. It measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country over a specific time period. So, GDP includes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.

Now, the key here is determining whether the purchase of the painting by XYZ Corporation counts towards GDP. The painting is an original Matisse, so it's probably a one-time creation, but in this case, XYZ is buying it, not commissioning it. Wait, but does it matter if it's a new or existing painting?

I think GDP includes the value of final goods and services produced in the current period. So if the painting was created this year, its sale would add to GDP. But if it's an existing painting, like a second-hand sale, then the GDP impact might be different.

Wait, the question says XYZ buys an original Matisse. So if Matisse painted it in the past, say decades ago, then the painting is a second-hand good. So the sale would be a transfer of ownership of an existing asset, not a new production.

So if that's the case, then GDP isn't affected because GDP doesn't count second-hand sales. Because when you buy a used car, for example, it doesn't add to GDP since the car was already produced in a previous period.

But wait, this is a corporation buying the painting. So how does that affect the GDP components? GDP is broken down into C (consumption), I (investment), G (government spending), and Xn (net exports).

If XYZ is a company, their purchase could fall under investment. Investment in economics usually refers to capital expenditures, like buying machinery or buildings. But a painting... is that considered investment? Or is it just a tangible asset, maybe for decorative purposes?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So, if a company buys a painting, is that investment? Or is it something else.

In national accounts, investment (I) is the purchase of capital assets, like new buildings, machinery, etc. But a painting, even if it's expensive, might be considered a capital asset, but perhaps as a durable good. Alternatively, it could be a financial investment, but in GDP terms, investment is more about capital goods.

Alternatively, maybe the painting is an intermediate good or a final good. Wait, no, in this case, XYZ is using it for their boardroom, so perhaps it's considered a capital good, part of their fixed assets.

Wait, but if the painting was already created in a previous period, then its value was already counted in GDP when it was first sold. So when XYZ buys it now, it's a second-hand transaction. GDP doesn't count that because it's not a new production.

So the purchase doesn't add to GDP because it's a transfer of an existing asset. So GDP remains unaffected.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says GDP is unaffected because it's a second-hand sale. That makes sense.

Option C says GDP is unaffected because it's a non-monetary asset. Wait, non-monetary assets are things like property, so maybe that's another way to look at it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the purchase doesn't affect GDP because the painting isn't part of current production.

Option F says GDP increases because it's considered an investment in art. But if it's a second-hand sale, then even though it's an investment, it doesn't add to GDP since the good isn't newly produced.

So the correct answer is B: GDP is unaffected because it's a second-hand sale.

Wait, but let me confirm. GDP counts final goods and services in the year they're produced. So if the painting was made, say, 50 years ago, then its production was counted in that year's GDP. Now, when XYZ buys it, it's a transfer, so no contribution to current GDP.

Yes, so option B is correct.

The question revolves around how the purchase of an original Matisse painting by XYZ Corporation affects GDP. GDP measures the total value of final goods and services produced within a country during a specific period. It includes consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (Xn). 

The key consideration is whether the painting's purchase counts as a new production or a second-hand sale. Since the painting is an original work by Matisse, it was likely created in the past. Therefore, its value was already counted in GDP in the year it was first produced. When XYZ Corporation buys it now, the transaction is a second-hand sale, which does not contribute to current GDP because it involves the transfer of an existing asset rather than a new production.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that GDP is unaffected because the transaction is a second-hand sale. This aligns with the understanding that GDP does not count transfers of existing assets.
- Other options, such as **F**, which suggests GDP increases due to investment in art, are incorrect because the painting is not a newly produced good, even if it is considered an investment.
- **Option C**, which mentions non-monetary assets, is less precise because the key reason GDP is unaffected is the second-hand nature of the sale.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: GDP is unaffected because it is a second-hand sale.**
