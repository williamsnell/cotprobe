Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about property law, specifically dealing with remainders and reversions. Hmm, I remember from my studies that remainders and reversions have to do with future interests in property. Let me think through this.

The question is asking: What is it called when a remainder in the grantor's heirs is invalid and becomes a reversion in the grantor? The options are from A to J.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The grantor creates a remainder, but if that remainder is invalid, it goes back to the grantor as a reversion. So, when a remainder fails, the interest reverts to the grantor, right?

I remember that there are several doctrines related to remainders. Let me try to recall each option:

A: Related Doctrine of Merger – I think merger happens when the same person holds two successive interests, causing them to merge. Not sure if that's related here.

B: Contingent remainder – That's a type of remainder, but the question is about the remainder being invalid, not the type.

C: Doctrine of Worthier Title – I think this is when a grantor tries to create a remainder in someone, but that someone is not of "worthier title" (like a child), so the remainder is invalid and becomes a reversion. Wait, does that ring a bell? Or was it the opposite?

D: Doctrine of Escheat – That's when property goes to the state because there are no heirs, not directly related here.

E: Vested remainder – This is a type of remainder that is certain to occur, but again, the question is about invalidity.

F: Rule in Wild's Case – I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe something to do with class gifts or contingent remainders?

G: Doctrine of Lapse – I think this applies when a beneficiary dies before the grantor, so the gift lapses. But does that make the interest revert?

H: Rule in Shelley's Case – This is about when a life estate and a remainder are given to the same person, leading to the merger of interests. So if you have a life estate to A and then a remainder to A's heirs, it becomes a fee simple. But the question here isn't exactly about that.

Wait, but the question is about a grantor's heirs. So suppose the grantor conveys a life estate to someone, and then a remainder to the grantor's heirs. If that remainder is invalid, it becomes a reversion. Which doctrine covers that?

I think the Doctrine of Worthier Title applies when a grantor tries to create a remainder for a person who is not of a "worthier title." For example, if the grantor has a child and tries to leave a remainder to their own heirs, which would include the child, but if the child is alive, the grantor's heirs (which would be the child) are not a "worthier title" than the grantor. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Or maybe when the grantor attempts to create a remainder for a class that includes themselves, it's invalid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Doctrine of Worthier Title says that a remainder cannot be created in someone who is not of a worthier title than the grantor. So if the grantor tries to leave a remainder to his own heirs, which would include himself if he has no children, maybe that's invalid. Or perhaps when the remainder is to the grantor's heirs, which might effectively be the grantor again, making it a reversion.

Wait, another approach. The Doctrine of Worthier Title comes into play when a grantor attempts to create a remainder in a class that could include the grantor. For example, if a grantor (who is a woman) leaves property to her husband for life, then to her heirs. Her heirs would include her husband, so the remainder to her heirs is invalid because the husband is not of a worthier title than the grantor. So the remainder fails, and the grantor's interest becomes a reversion.

Alternatively, I remember that the Doctrine of Worthier Title invalidates a remainder if it's given to someone who is not of a worthier title than the grantor. So if the grantor's heirs are the remaindermen, but the grantor is still alive, maybe the remainder is to the grantor's heirs, which could include the grantor if they have no children. So the remainder is invalid, and the grantor's reversion is what's left.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be C: Doctrine of Worthier Title.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky. Let me think of another option. The Rule in Shelley's Case (option H) is when a life estate is given to A, and the remainder to A's heirs. Then, under Shelley's case, A gets the fee simple because the life estate and the remainder merge. But that's a different scenario.

So, in the original question, the grantor's heirs' remainder is invalid, so it becomes a reversion. That fits with Doctrine of Worthier Title because the remainder is to the grantor's heirs, which might include the grantor, making the remainder invalid, and thus the interest reverts to the grantor.

So the answer should be C.

The question asks about the doctrine that applies when a remainder in the grantor's heirs is invalid and becomes a reversion in the grantor. To answer this, it is important to analyze the scenario and the options provided.

The scenario involves a grantor creating a remainder, but the remainder is invalid, causing the interest to revert to the grantor. This situation is addressed by the Doctrine of Worthier Title. Under this doctrine, a remainder cannot be created in someone who is not of a "worthier title" than the grantor. For example, if the grantor attempts to create a remainder in their own heirs, and this includes themselves (if they have no children), the remainder is invalid. As a result, the interest reverts to the grantor as a reversion.

Other options, such as the Rule in Shelley's Case (option H), involve different scenarios, like the merger of a life estate and a remainder, and are not applicable here. The Doctrine of Worthier Title specifically addresses the invalidity of a remainder in the grantor's heirs, making it the correct answer.
