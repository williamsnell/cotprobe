Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question to answer, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about the two principal answers to whether life has any meaning for us. The options are from A to J, each pairing different philosophical views.

Hmm, I remember that this is a question about the meaning of life, which is a big topic in philosophy. So the question is asking which two main perspectives answer whether life has meaning. Let me think about the different philosophical theories I've come across.

First, I should probably break down each option to understand what they're suggesting.

Option A: Pessimist's view and Optimist's view. Pessimists think life is inherently negative, while optimists see the positive. But are these the principal answers? I'm not so sure. They seem more like emotional outlooks rather than structured philosophical responses.

Option B: Existentialist's view and Nihilist's view. Existentialists believe that life's meaning is created by the individual, that we're free to choose our path and create our own meaning. Nihilists, on the other hand, argue that life has no inherent meaning. This seems like a strong possibility because these are two distinct answers to the question of life's meaning.

Option C: Deterministic view and Free will view. Determinism is about everything being caused, no free choice, while free will is about having choices. But do these directly answer the question of life's meaning? They're more about how the world works rather than the meaning of life itself.

Option D: Materialistic view and Spiritual view. Materialism focuses on the physical world, while spiritual views emphasize non-material aspects. I'm not sure if these are the primary answers to life's meaning. They relate more to what's real rather than the meaning.

Option E: Empiricist's and Rationalist's view. These are epistemological positions about knowledgeâ€”empiricism through senses, rationalism through reason. Not directly about the meaning of life.

Option F: External view and Internal view. I'm not as familiar with these terms in this context. Maybe external meaning comes from outside (like society or God), and internal from within? That could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if these are the principal answers.

Option G: Theistic view and Agnostic view. Theistic is believing in a God, agnostic is unsure. Theistic could imply life has meaning from God, while agnostic might not commit. But again, maybe not the main two answers.

Option H: Monist and Dualist view. These are metaphysical positions about the nature of reality (one substance vs. two). Not directly about meaning.

Option I: Relativist and Absolutist view. Relativists believe in relative truths, absolutists in universal truths. This is more about ethics and knowledge than life's meaning.

Option J: Religious view and Liberal view. Religious might say life's meaning comes from a higher power, while liberal could be more humanistic. But I'm not certain if these are the main two.

So, circling back, the question is about the principal answers. The two main responses I can think of are existentialism and nihilism. Existentialists say you create your own meaning, while nihilists say there's no inherent meaning. That's a direct answer to whether life has meaning.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The question asks for the two principal answers to whether life has any meaning. After analyzing the options, the existentialist's view and the nihilist's view stand out as the most direct responses. Existentialists argue that individuals create their own meaning, while nihilists contend that life lacks inherent meaning. These perspectives directly address the question of life's meaning, making them the principal answers.

Answer: B
