Question:

Two hikers set off in an eastward direction. Hiker 1 travels 3 km while hiker 2 travels 6 times the distance covered by hiker 1. What is the displacement of hiker 2?

Options:

A: 36 km
B: 30 km
C: 12 km
D: 21 km
E: 9 km
F: 6 km
G: 18 km
H: 15 km
I: 3 km
J: 24 km

Okay, let's see. I've got this physics problem here about two hikers. Hmm, both are going east, right? So the problem says that Hiker 1 travels 3 km eastward. Hiker 2 goes 6 times that distance. Wait, so Hiker 2 is going 6 times 3 km. Let me do that math. 6 times 3 is 18, so that's 18 km. But wait, the question is asking about displacement, not just distance. Oh right, displacement is a vector quantity, so it has both magnitude and direction. But since both are moving in the same direction, east, the displacement would just be the distance multiplied by the direction.

So Hiker 1's displacement is 3 km east. Hiker 2's displacement is 6 times that, which is 18 km east. Looking at the options, the one that matches 18 is option G. I think that's it. I don't think I missed anything here because the direction is the same for both, so the displacement is straightforward. Yeah, I'm confident it's G.

The displacement of Hiker 2 is 18 km east.
