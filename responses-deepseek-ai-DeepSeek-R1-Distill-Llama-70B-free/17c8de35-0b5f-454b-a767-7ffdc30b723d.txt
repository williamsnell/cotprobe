Okay, so I've got this accounting problem about consolidated financial statements. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about King, Inc. which owns 70% of Simmon Co. So King is the parent company, and Simmon is the subsidiary. I remember that when preparing consolidated financial statements, we have to consider the parent's and subsidiary's financials, and also account for any intercompany transactions or balances.

The question gives me the liabilities of both companies. King's liabilities are $450,000, and Simmon's are $200,000. So at first glance, if I just add them together, that's $650,000. But wait, I think there's more to it because of the intercompany note payable.

Oh right, Simmon has a $100,000 note payable to King. That means Simmon owes King $100k. In consolidated statements, we have to eliminate the intercompany balances because they're internal transactions and shouldn't appear in the consolidated financials.

So let me break it down. King's liabilities are $450k, but does this note affect King's side? Well, the note is Simmon's liability to King, so in King's books, there's probably a receivable. But when consolidating, we need to see if this is an intercompany transaction that should be eliminated.

In the consolidated balance sheet, the parent's liability would be their own liabilities except for any intercompany items. Wait, no, the note is Simmon's liability to King. So from King's perspective, it's an asset (like accounts receivable), and from Simmon's, it's a liability.

But in consolidation, we eliminate the receivable and payable between the two. So the $100k that Simmon owes King would be eliminated. How does that affect the total liabilities?

Let me think: when we eliminate the intercompany note, Simmon's liability to King is offset against King's asset (the receivable). So in the consolidated liabilities, we shouldn't show Simmon's $100k as a liability because it's owed to the parent, which is part of the same consolidated entity.

Wait, but King's total liabilities are $450k. Do any of those relate to Simmon? I don't think so because the note is Simmon's liability. So King's $450k remains as is. Simmon's total liabilities are $200k, but $100k of that is the note to King, which we have to eliminate. So Simmon's liabilities in the consolidation would be $200k - $100k = $100k.

Then, the total consolidated liabilities would be King's $450k plus Simmon's adjusted $100k, which totals $550k. Wait, but looking at the options, option G is $550,000. So that's the answer?

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The parent's liabilities are separate, and the subsidiary's liabilities are adjusted for the intercompany portion.

Another way: Total liabilities before elimination are $450k (King) + $200k (Simmon) = $650k. But the $100k note is an intercompany liability, so we subtract it once. So $650k - $100k = $550k. Yep, that makes sense.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be G: $550,000.

To determine the total liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, we must consider the liabilities of both King, Inc. and Simmon Co., and adjust for any intercompany transactions.

1. **King's Liabilities**: King's liabilities total $450,000. These are external liabilities and remain unchanged in the consolidated financial statements.

2. **Simmon's Liabilities**: Simmon's liabilities total $200,000. However, $100,000 of this amount represents a note payable to King, which is an intercompany transaction. In consolidated financial statements, intercompany balances are eliminated because they represent transactions within the same economic entity.

3. **Adjustment for Intercompany Transaction**: The $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King is eliminated in the consolidation process. Therefore, Simmon's liabilities in the consolidated financial statements are reduced by $100,000, leaving $100,000.

4. **Total Consolidated Liabilities**: Adding King's liabilities ($450,000) to Simmon's adjusted liabilities ($100,000) gives a total of $550,000.

Thus, the total liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements are **$550,000**.
