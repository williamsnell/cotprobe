C: y = 13 - 36
D: 36 - y = 13
E: 13 = y + 36
F: y = 36 - 13
G: y + 36 = 13
H: y - 36 = 13
I: 36 + y = â€“13
J: 36 = y + 13

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. It asks which equation represents "36 less than a number y is equal to 13." Hmm, okay, I need to translate that into an equation.

Alright, let's break it down. The phrase is "36 less than a number y." So, when they say "less than," that usually means subtraction. So 36 less than y would be y minus 36, right? Because if you have a number and you subtract 36, that's taking away 36 from it. So that part translates to y - 36.

Now the next part is "is equal to 13." So putting it all together, the equation should be y - 36 equals 13. Because 36 less than y equals 13. So the equation is y - 36 = 13.

Looking at the options provided, I need to find which one matches this structure. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: 13 + y = 36. Hmm, that's saying 13 plus y equals 36. Doesn't fit because we're looking for y minus 36.

Option B: 13 - y = 36. That's 13 minus y equals 36. Again, not matching because the order is reversed; it's y minus 36.

Option C: y = 13 - 36. That's y equals a negative number, which doesn't make sense because 36 less than y should be 13, implying y is bigger than 13.

Option D: 36 - y = 13. Wait, that's 36 minus y equals 13. Oh wait, that's different from what I thought. Because the original is y - 36 = 13. So this would be if the equation was 36 less than y, but written as 36 - y. But wait, no, 36 less than y is y - 36, not 36 - y. So D might be tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, the wording is "36 less than a number y." So that's y - 36. So the correct equation is y - 36 = 13, which would be option H. Wait, did I skip that?

Let me check the options again.

Option H: y - 36 = 13. Yes, that's exactly what I have. So that's the correct one.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me re-examine the options. Option D says 36 - y =13. So that's 36 minus y equals 13. That's different because it's not y minus 36. So option D would mean y is 23 because 36 -23=13. But in our correct equation, y would be 49 because 49-36=13. So option D gives a different result, so it's not correct.

So the correct option is H: y - 36 = 13.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other options. Let's go through all of them.

Option E: 13 = y +36. That's y plus 36 equals 13, which doesn't fit. Because y would have to be negative, which isn't the case here.

Option F: y =36 -13. That's y=23. But that's from 36 minus 13 equals y, which isn't the same as the problem statement.

Option G: y +36 =13. Again, that would make y negative, which isn't right.

Option I: 36 + y = -13. That's way off, making y a negative number.

Option J: 36 = y +13. That's the same as y =23. Which again, isn't the correct equation we're looking for.

So yeah, the only correct option is H: y -36 =13.
</think>

The correct equation representing "36 less than a number \( y \) is equal to 13" is \( y - 36 = 13 \). This translates to \( y - 36 = 13 \), which matches option H.

Answer: H
