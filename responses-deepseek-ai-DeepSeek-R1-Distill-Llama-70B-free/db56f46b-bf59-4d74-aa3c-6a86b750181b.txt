Okay, so I have this question here about calculating the Sortino ratio for Mutual Fund A. Hmm, I remember that the Sortino ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let's think this through.

Wait, right! The Sortino ratio is similar to the Sharpe ratio, but instead of using the standard deviation of all returns, it uses the downside deviation. That makes it focus only on the downside risk, which is the risk of losing money. So the formula should be something like (Return of the fund - Risk-free rate) divided by the downside deviation of the fund.

Looking at the question, Mutual Fund A has an annualized return of 15% and a downside deviation of 8%. The risk-free rate is given as 2.5%. So I should plug these numbers into the formula.

So the numerator would be 15% minus 2.5%, which is 12.5%. The denominator is the downside deviation of Fund A, which is 8%. So the ratio would be 12.5% divided by 8%.

Let me do that calculation. 12.5 divided by 8 equals... let's see, 8 goes into 12 once, making 8, subtract to get 4. Bring down the 5, making 45. 8 goes into 45 five times (5*8=40), remainder 5. So 1.5625. Wait, that's 1.5625.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.56. That's really close to 1.5625. So I think that's the right answer. But wait, are there any other details I'm missing?

Oh wait, the problem is about the Sortino ratio for Fund A only. Yeah, I used Fund A's numbers. So the calculation is correct. So the answer should be approximately 1.56, which matches option I.

The Sortino ratio is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{\text{Fund Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\text{Downside Deviation}}
\]

For Mutual Fund A, the annualized return is 15%, the downside deviation is 8%, and the risk-free rate is 2.5%. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{15\% - 2.5\%}{8\%} = \frac{12.5\%}{8\%} = 1.5625
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value to 1.5625 is 1.56, which corresponds to option I.
