Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

Alright, the problem says that a chemist dropped a 200 g object into a tank of water, and it displaced 60 ml of water. Then, in a similar experiment, the same object was dropped into an oil, and this time it displaced 50 g of oil. The question is asking me to calculate the density of the object and the oil. The options are from A to J, with different density values.

Hmm. I remember that when an object is submerged in a fluid, it displaces a volume of the fluid equal to the volume of the object. Also, the buoyant force is involved here, but wait, since the object sank in both cases, maybe buoyancy isn't the main focus here. Or wait, maybe it's about comparing the displaced volumes to find densities.

Wait, let me think. If the object sinks, it means that the density of the object is greater than the density of the fluid it's placed in. So in water, the object sank and displaced 60 ml. In oil, which is less dense than water, it also sank but displaced 50 grams of oil. Wait, but wait, the displaced volume would be the same as the object's volume, right? Because the object is fully submerged.

Wait, no. Wait, when you submerge an object in a fluid, the volume displaced is equal to the object's volume. But the mass displaced depends on the fluid's density. So, for water, the displaced volume is 60 ml, which would correspond to 60 grams because water's density is 1 g/ml. Wait, but no, wait. Because in the problem, when it's in water, it displaces 60 ml, which is 60 grams. But in oil, it displaces 50 grams. Wait, but oil is less dense, so 50 grams would correspond to a larger volume.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says that in water, the object displaced 60 ml. So the mass of displaced water is 60 grams because density of water is 1 g/ml. So 60 ml * 1g/ml = 60 grams. 

In oil, the object displaced 50 grams of oil. So the volume displaced in oil would be mass divided by density. So Volume_oil = 50 g / density_oil.

But wait, the key point is that the volume displaced in each case is the same as the object's volume. Because when it's submerged, the displaced volume equals the object's own volume. So the object's volume is the same in both cases. 

So, the object's volume is 60 ml when in water. Because 60 ml of water was displaced. But wait, wait! No. Wait, the problem says in water, it displaced 60 ml, but in oil, it displaced 50 grams. So the displaced volume in oil is 50 g / density_oil. But the key is that the displaced volume in both cases is the same because the object's volume is the same. Wait, no, that can't be right because the displaced volume would depend on the fluid's density. 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backward. Let me think again. The object's volume is the same whether it's in water or oil. So, the displaced volume in water is 60 ml, so V = 60 ml. Then, when it's in oil, it displaces a different volume, but wait, no, because it's the same object. So that can't be. Wait, no, wait. No, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

Ah, the problem says it displaced 60 ml of water when it sunk to the bottom. So the displaced volume is 60 ml, which is the object's volume. Because when the object is submerged, the displaced volume equals the object's volume. So the object's volume is 60 ml.

Wait, then in oil, the object displaces 50 grams of oil. So the displaced volume in oil would be 50 g / density_oil. But since the object's volume is the same (60 ml), then 50 g / density_oil = 60 ml. Because the displaced volume in oil is 60 ml, same as the object's volume. Wait, that makes sense. So:

Density_oil = 50 g / 60 ml.

Wait, let's compute that. 50 divided by 60 is 0.8333... So that's approximately 0.83 g/ml. So the oil's density is 0.83 g/ml. 

Now, the object's mass is 200 grams, and its volume is 60 ml. So the object's density is mass/volume = 200 g / 60 ml. Let's calculate that: 200/60 is 3.333..., so about 3.33 g/ml.

So the object's density is 3.33 g/ml, and the oil's density is 0.83 g/ml. Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches. 

Option A says object's density is 3.33 and oil is 0.83. That fits. Option C has oil at 1, which is wrong. Option H has object at 4 and oil 0.83, which doesn't fit. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, in the oil case, the displaced mass is 50 grams. So displaced volume is 50g / density_oil. But the displaced volume in oil should equal the object's volume, which is 60 ml. So:

50 / density_oil = 60 â†’ density_oil = 50/60 = 0.833 g/ml. Correct.

Object's density is 200g /60ml = 3.333 g/ml. Correct.

So the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the volume of the object is the same in both water and oil. When the object is submerged in water, it displaces 60 ml of water, which corresponds to the object's volume. Since the density of water is 1 g/ml, the mass of the displaced water is 60 g.

In oil, the object displaces 50 g of oil. The displaced volume in oil can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Volume}_{\text{oil}} = \frac{\text{Mass}_{\text{oil}}}{\text{Density}_{\text{oil}}}
\]

Since the displaced volume in oil is equal to the object's volume (60 ml), we can solve for the oil's density:

\[
\text{Density}_{\text{oil}} = \frac{\text{Mass}_{\text{oil}}}{\text{Volume}_{\text{oil}}} = \frac{50 \, \text{g}}{60 \, \text{ml}} = 0.833 \, \text{g/ml}
\]

Next, we calculate the density of the object. The object's mass is 200 g, and its volume is 60 ml. Using the formula for density:

\[
\text{Density}_{\text{object}} = \frac{\text{Mass}_{\text{object}}}{\text{Volume}_{\text{object}}} = \frac{200 \, \text{g}}{60 \, \text{ml}} = 3.333 \, \text{g/ml}
\]

Thus, the density of the object is approximately 3.33 g/ml, and the density of the oil is approximately 0.83 g/ml. Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: Density of the object is 3.33 g/ml and the oil is 0.83 g/ml.**
