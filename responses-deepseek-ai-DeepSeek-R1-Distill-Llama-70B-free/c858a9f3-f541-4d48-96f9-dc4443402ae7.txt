Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about advanced animal societies. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking to discuss some elements found in advanced animal societies. The options are from A to G. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, what do I know about animal societies? Advanced societies usually have complex social structures. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Language development, agricultural practices, written communication. Wait, agricultural practices and written communication are things I associate with humans, not animals. I don't think animals have agriculture or writing. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Economic systems, legal structures, political elections. These definitely sound human. Animals don't have economies or legal systems as far as I know. So B is probably not right.

Option C: Adaptation, evolution, species diversity. Those are more general biological terms. Adaptation and evolution are processes, species diversity is a result, but do they specifically relate to the structure of advanced societies? Maybe not, since these are broader concepts.

Option D: Cultural traditions, artistic expression, philosophy. Again, these are very human concepts. I don't think animals have philosophy or art in the same way humans do. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Leadership, territory, dominance hierarchy. Oh, these ring a bell. Many animal groups have leaders, like alpha wolves or dominant chimpanzees. Territory is a common thing, like birds defending their nests. Dominance hierarchies are well-documented in many species. So E seems plausible.

Option F: Family structure, food chains, migration patterns. Family structure makes sense for advanced societies, but food chains are more about ecosystems, not social structures. Migration is a behavior, but I'm not sure if it's a defining element of an advanced society. So F might not be the best fit.

Option G: Habitat selection, mating rituals, parental care. These are all important behaviors, but do they indicate an advanced society? Habitat selection is about where to live, mating rituals are common even in simpler societies, and parental care is widespread too. Maybe not the most advanced elements.

So putting it together, the elements of leadership, territory, and dominance hierarchy are key features of advanced animal societies. For example, in primates, there's a clear hierarchy and leaders. In birds, territory defense is crucial, and many species establish dominance to lead the group. These elements help in organizing the society, which is a mark of being advanced.

Wait, another thought: Option E's elements are more about social structure and organization, which are signs of advanced societies. So I think E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: Leadership, territory, and dominance hierarchy are elements found in advanced animal societies.

Answer: E
