Okay, so I've got this problem here about mass transfer and heat transfer coefficients. Hmm, I remember from my classes that there's a relationship between the two, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a cylinder is placed perpendicular to a turbulent air stream. The air is flowing at 20 ft/sec. The wet surface absorbs ammonia, NH3. But they don't have mass transfer data, so they're using heat transfer data instead. The heat transfer coefficient given is h = 12 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. I need to find the mass transfer coefficient h_D.

Wait, I think the key here is the analogy between heat and mass transfer. Oh right, there's something called the Reynolds analogy which relates the heat transfer coefficient to the mass transfer coefficient. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula.

I recall that the Reynolds analogy is applicable when the Prandtl number (Pr) and the Schmidt number (Sc) are equal, or maybe when they're not too different. But wait, in this problem, I don't have the Pr or Sc values. Oh wait, maybe they're using the same fluid so the properties are similar. Or perhaps there's a different approach.

Another thought: There's a formula that connects the mass transfer coefficient (h_D) with the heat transfer coefficient (h) using the Lewis number. The Lewis number is the ratio of the Schmidt number to the Prandtl number (Le = Sc/Pr). But I'm not sure if that's the right path here.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use a direct proportionality. I remember the formula h_D = h * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3) or something like that. No, wait, the exact exponent might be different. Let me think. Oh, right! The Chilton-Colburn analogy might be more appropriate here. 

The Chilton-Colburn analogy states that the dimensionless numbers for heat and mass transfer are related. The specific equation is:

j_H = j_M * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3)

Wait, no, wait. The j-factors are different. The j_H is the heat transfer factor and j_M is the mass transfer factor. And the j-factor is defined as (h / (C * v)) * Pr^(2/3) for heat transfer, and similarly for mass transfer with Sc.

Wait another approach: The mass transfer coefficient h_D can be found using the heat transfer coefficient via the formula:

h_D = h * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3) * (k_air/k_mass) ?

No, maybe not. Alternatively, there's a direct relationship where h_D is proportional to h multiplied by some function of the properties.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relation:

h_D = (h / k) * (D / α)^(1/3)

But wait, no, that seems off. Alternatively, maybe it's h_D = h * (D / α)^(1/3), where D is the diffusion coefficient and α is the thermal diffusivity.

Wait, but I don't have values for D or α here. Since the problem gives h, the heat transfer coefficient, and asks for the mass transfer coefficient, perhaps it's using the assumption that Pr = Sc, which would make Le =1. If that's the case, then h_D would be equal to h. But that can't be right because the options don't have 12 as an option. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the same fluid so the properties like Pr and Sc are the same. Or maybe it's using air, which has known Pr. Wait, but ammonia is dissolving into the air (I think), so maybe the properties are based on the ammonia-air mixture. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the dimensionless numbers. The Nusselt number is for heat transfer, and the Sherwood number is for mass transfer. The analogy between them can be used.

The Nusselt number Nu = h L / k
The Sherwood number Sh = h_D L / D

If the flow is similar, and the Prandtl and Schmidt numbers are considered, then the relation between Nu and Sh can be established. For example, under certain conditions, Sh = Nu * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3).

But I'm not sure about the exact exponent here. Another thought: The Chilton-Colburn analogy says that j_H = j_M, where j factors are defined as:

j_H = (h / C) * (Pr)^(−2/3)
j_M = (h_D) * (Sc)^(−2/3)

Since j_H = j_M, we have:

h / (C * Pr^(2/3)) ) = h_D / (Sc^(2/3))

Wait, but wait, what's C here? Oh, I think C is the average specific heat at constant pressure. But perhaps in this problem, the fluid is air, so C is the specific heat of air, and perhaps the same properties are used for Sc and Pr.

Wait, maybe the equation simplifies to h_D = h * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3). Or perhaps (Sc/Pr)^(1/3) in the numerator or denominator. Let me think.

Wait, let me get the exact form of the Chilton-Colburn analogy. Oh right, the analogy states that:

j_H = j_M (Pr/Sc)^(1/3)

Wait, no, perhaps it's j_H = j_M (Sc/Pr)^(1/3), I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Alternatively, the j factors are defined as:

j_H = (h c_p) / (k G) ) * Pr^(-2/3) 

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, the j factor is:

j_H = St Pr^(2/3) 

Where St is the Stanton number for heat transfer, which is h/(ρ c_p v).

Similarly, j_M = Sh Sc^(2/3) / (ρ v D) ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track.

Let me try a different approach. The problem gives the heat transfer coefficient h, and we need to find h_D, the mass transfer coefficient. The relation between them is given by the Chilton-Colburn analogy, which says:

h_D = h * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3)

Wait, but I don't know the values of Sc and Pr. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the Schmidt number and Prandtl number are considered to be the same, which would make Sc/Pr =1, so h_D = h. But that can't be right because the options don't include 12. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the properties of air. Let me think about the typical values. The Prandtl number for air is about 0.7. The Schmidt number for ammonia in air is around 0.97? Or maybe a different value. Wait, I think the Schmidt number for NH3 in air is approximately 0.97. So Sc ≈ 0.97.

Wait, let me double-check. Wait, the Schmidt number Sc is the ratio of the kinematic viscosity to the diffusion coefficient. For ammonia in air, I think Sc is about 0.86 or 0.97. Let me think. Water vapor in air has Sc around 0.6, but ammonia might be lower. Wait, maybe it's around 0.86.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value isn't needed because the problem expects me to use an approximate method. But without knowing Sc and Pr, how can I proceed?

Wait, maybe the question assumes that the Prandtl number and the Schmidt number are equal, implying that Sc/Pr =1, making h_D = h. But that again gives 12, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the fact that for gases, the Lewis number (Le) is approximately 1, implying that Sc/Pr =1. But again, that would make h_D = h, which is 12. Not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. The problem states that the cylinder is wet, so maybe it's considering the liquid phase. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the Colburn analogy which relates the two coefficients.

Wait, the Colburn analogy states that h_D = (h / c_p) * (Pr/(Sc))^(1/3) * (M_w)^(-1/3) * (ρ μ / (D)) )... No, perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that connects the mass transfer coefficient with the heat transfer coefficient:

h_D = h * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3)

But without knowing Sc and Pr, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that Sc/Pr is a certain value.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another thought: The problem states that the same geometry and air velocity are used, so the Reynolds number is the same. If the Prandtl and Schmidt numbers are similar, then the mass and heat transfer coefficients are related via the square root or some other exponent. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is (Sc/Pr)^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps I should look for a standard value when Sc and Pr are not provided. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the fact that for air, the Prandtl number is about 0.7, and the Schmidt number for ammonia in air is around 0.86. So Sc/Pr ≈ 0.86 / 0.7 ≈ 1.2286.

So (Sc/Pr)^(1/3) would be approximately (1.2286)^(1/3) ≈ 1.07.

Then h_D = h * 1.07 = 12 * 1.07 ≈ 12.84. But wait, 12.84 isn't one of the options, which are all in the hundreds. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Oh wait, the heat transfer coefficient h is given in Btu/hr·ft²·°F. How does that convert to mass transfer units?

Wait, the units for h (heat) are Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). The units for h_D, the mass transfer coefficient, would be lbmol/(hr·ft²). Or perhaps in ft/hr? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the unit conversion here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the fact that h_D is proportional to h multiplied by some factor involving the Lewis number.

Wait, another approach. The mass transfer coefficient h_D is related to the heat transfer coefficient via the formula:

h_D = (h / c_p) * (k / D)^(1/3) * (μ / (ρ D))^(1/3) ) ... No, perhaps that's not the right way.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is h_D = (h * D) / k * (Pr/Sc)^(1/3). Because from the Chilton-Colburn analogy, the ratio of h_D to h is (Sc/Pr)^(1/3) times (k/D) ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the dimensionless numbers.

The Sherwood number (Sh) is h_D * L / D.

The Nusselt number (Nu) is h * L / k.

If the flow is the same, then Re is the same. So if Pr and Sc are known, Sh and Nu can be related.

In the case where the flow is turbulent, the Colburn analogy says that Sh = Nu * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3).

So Sh = Nu * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3).

But Sh = h_D L / D,

Nu = h L / k,

So substituting:

h_D L / D = (h L / k) * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3)

Cancel L from both sides:

h_D / D = (h / k) * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3)

So h_D = h * (k/D) * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3)

But wait, I don't have values for k or D here. The problem doesn't provide any of these properties. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that (k/D) is 1, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the assumption that (k/D) is equal to 1 in some unit system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the relation h_D = h * sqrt(Sc/Pr), but that's just a guess.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I don't have the necessary property values. Maybe the problem expects me to use an approximate value for (Sc/Pr)^(1/3) as a multiplier to h.

Wait, another thought. If the problem states that the same geometry and air velocity are used for both heat and mass transfer, perhaps the only variable is the property ratio. So the ratio h_D/h would be (Sc/Pr)^(1/3).

But since I don't have Sc and Pr, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that Sc/Pr is 1, making h_D = h. But that would give 12, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that for ammonia in air, the Schmidt number Sc is around 0.86, and the Prandtl number for air is around 0.7, so Sc/Pr is approximately 1.2286. Then the cube root of 1.2286 is about 1.07. So h_D = 12 * 1.07 ≈12.84. But that's nowhere near the options given, which are all in the hundreds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the units. Oh! Wait, the heat transfer coefficient is given in Btu units, but the mass transfer coefficient will have different units. So maybe I need to convert h from Btu/hr·ft²·°F to some other unit that's compatible with h_D's units.

Wait, the units for h (heat) are Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). The units for h_D are typically lbmol/(hr·ft²·atm) or similar, but sometimes expressed in ft/hr when considering the mass transfer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass transfer coefficient in the form of h_D = (mass flux) = (k_g * P), where P is pressure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the fact that the Lewis number (Le) is Sc/Pr, and that h_D = h * (1/Le)^(1/3), but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is using the same fluid for both heat and mass transfer, so the properties are the same. Then h_D would be h multiplied by some factor.

Wait, another approach: The j-factor for heat transfer is j_H = (h c_p) / (k G) ) * Pr^(-2/3)

And for mass transfer, j_M = (h_D c_p) / (D G) ) * Sc^(-2/3)

But since j_H = j_M,

h c_p / (k G) * Pr^(-2/3) = h_D c_p / (D G) * Sc^(-2/3)

Cancel terms:

h / k * Pr^(-2/3) = h_D / D * Sc^(-2/3)

Rearranging,

h_D = h * (D / k) * (Sc/Pr)^(2/3)

But again, without D and k values, I can't compute this.

Wait, but maybe in this problem, the ratio D/k is 1, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the same fluid so D and k are the same, but that's not the case here because for heat transfer, k is thermal conductivity of air, and for mass transfer, D is the diffusion coefficient of NH3 in air.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the Schmidt number Sc equals the Prandtl number Pr, so Sc/Pr =1, which would make h_D = h. But again, the options don't include 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio h_D/h is (Sc/Pr)^(1/3), and if Sc/Pr is approximately 0.86/0.7 ≈ 1.2286, then (1.2286)^(1/3) ≈ 1.07, so h_D ≈12 *1.07=12.84. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong values for Sc and Pr. Let me think again. The Schmidt number for ammonia in air is around 0.86, and the Prandtl number for air is about 0.7. So Sc/Pr=0.86/0.7≈1.2286. The cube root is about 1.07, so h_D=12*1.07≈12.84. But the options are all in the hundreds. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to unit conversion. The heat transfer coefficient is given in Btu units, but h_D might be in different units that require conversion. Let me think about the units.

The heat transfer coefficient h is in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). To convert that to mass transfer coefficient units, perhaps I need to use the specific heat and other properties.

Wait, the mass transfer coefficient h_D has units of length/time, like ft/hr. The heat transfer coefficient h has units of energy/(time·area·temperature). So perhaps to get h_D from h, I need to relate them via some properties.

Wait, maybe the relation is h_D = h * (M) / (c_p * ρ), where M is molar mass, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is h_D = (h / c_p) * (k / D) * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3). But without knowing k, D, c_p, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that for air, the product of c_p and rho is about 0.327 Btu/(ft³·°F) (I think that's roughly the value). Let me check the unit conversion.

The heat transfer coefficient h is in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). To get h_D in ft/hr, perhaps I can use:

h_D = h * (M * μ) / (k * Sc) )^(1/3)

But I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following approach:

The mass transfer coefficient h_D is related to the heat transfer coefficient h through the formula:

h_D = h * (D * Sc /
