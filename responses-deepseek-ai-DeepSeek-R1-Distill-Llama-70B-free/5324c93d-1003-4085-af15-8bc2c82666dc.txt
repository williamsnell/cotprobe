Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sapphire making bouquets with balloons. Let me read it again. She has 179 balloons and each bouquet needs 7 balloons. The question is how many bouquets she can make. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, so I think this is a division problem because she's distributing the balloons into groups (bouquets) of 7. So I need to divide 179 by 7 to find out how many bouquets she can make.

Wait, but how do I do that? Let me think. Division of 179 by 7. I remember that 7 times 20 is 140, right? Because 7x20 is 140. Then 179 minus 140 leaves me with 39. Hmm, wait no, wait, 179-140 is actually 39? Wait, no, 140 plus 39 is 179, yes. So 7 times 20 is 140, and then I have 39 left.

But wait, 7 times 5 is 35, so 20+5 is 25, and 7x25 is 175. Oh wait, because 25 times 7 is 175. So 179 minus 175 is 4. So that would mean she can make 25 bouquets, which use 175 balloons, and have 4 left over. But wait, the question is asking how many bouquets she can make, so it's 25, because the 4 leftover aren't enough for another bouquet.

Wait, but let me double-check the division. 7 goes into 17 twice (because 7x2 is 14), subtract 14 from 17, remainder 3. Bring down the 9 to make 39. 7 goes into 39 five times (7x5=35). So 25 with a remainder of 4. So yes, 25 bouquets.

Looking at the options, option H is 25 bouquets. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. 25 times 7 is 175. 179 minus 175 is 4, which is correct. So she can't make another full bouquet because she needs 7 each time. So yeah, 25 is the correct number.

To determine how many bouquets Sapphire can make, we need to divide the total number of balloons (179) by the number of balloons per bouquet (7). 

Performing the division:
- 7 Ã— 25 = 175, which is the largest multiple of 7 less than 179.
- Subtracting this from 179 leaves a remainder of 4 (179 - 175 = 4).

Since Sapphire cannot make a complete bouquet with the remaining 4 balloons, the total number of bouquets she can make is 25.

The correct answer is **H: 25 bouquets**.

H
