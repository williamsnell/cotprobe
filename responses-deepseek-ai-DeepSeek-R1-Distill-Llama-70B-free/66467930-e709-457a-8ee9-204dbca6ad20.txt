Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these types of calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about calculating the number of spontaneous fissions in a shale sample over a day. Let's see what data I have. The problem states that the spontaneous fission activity rate of U-238 is 6.7 fissions per kilogram per second. So that's like a given constant, right? 

The shale sample has 0.055% U-238 by weight. Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up. Oh wait, 0.055% is the same as 0.055 per hundred, which is 0.00055 in decimal form. Got it. So if I have a certain mass of shale, the mass of U-238 in it would be that percentage of the total mass.

The total mass of the shale pile is 10^6 kg, which is 1,000,000 kg or one million kilograms. Wait, no, wait—wait, the problem says 10^6 kg. Oh, no, wait, no, the pile is 10^6 kg? Wait, the question says 106 kg. Wait, let me check again. Oh, no, it says "a 106-kg pile of the shale." Oh, okay, so the total mass is 106 kg. Wait, 10^6 is a million, but 106 is just 106. Wait, no, 10^6 is a million. Oh but the problem writes it as 106-kg pile, so that's 1.06e2 kg, which is 106 kg. Okay, got it.

So I need to find the number of fissions in one day. Let's break it down.

First, I should find out how much U-238 is in the shale. Since the shale is 106 kg and 0.055% of that is U-238, I can calculate that. So:

Mass of U-238 = Total mass * percentage
Which is 106 kg * 0.055% 

Wait, 0.055% is 0.00055 in decimal. So:

106 kg * 0.00055 = ?

Let me compute that. 106 * 0.00055. Let's see, 100 * 0.00055 is 0.055, and 6 * 0.00055 is 0.0033. So total is 0.055 + 0.0033 = 0.0583 kg. So about 0.0583 kg of U-238.

Wait, that seems really low. Let me double-check. 0.055% is 0.055 per 100, so 0.00055. 106 kg times 0.00055 is indeed 0.0583 kg. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, the activity rate is given as 6.7 fissions per kg per second. So for each kilogram of U-238, every second, there are 6.7 fissions happening. So to find the total fissions per second (which is the activity), I multiply the mass of U-238 by the activity per kg.

So activity = mass * rate = 0.0583 kg * 6.7 fissions/kg/s.

Let me compute that. 0.0583 * 6.7. Hmm, 0.05 *6.7 is 0.335, and 0.0083 *6.7 is approximately 0.05571. Adding them together gives 0.335 + 0.05571 = 0.39071 fissions per second.

Wait, that seems low. Wait, no, because 0.0583 kg * 6.7 is about 0.39071. Yeah, that's correct.

But wait, this is per second. We need to find the number of fissions in one day. So we'll need to multiply by the number of seconds in a day.

How many seconds are in a day? Let's see: 1 day = 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute.

So 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes, and 1440 * 60 = 86400 seconds. So 86,400 seconds per day.

So total fissions = activity (fissions/s) * time (s) = 0.39071 fissions/s * 86400 s.

Calculating that: 0.39071 * 86400. Let's compute this.

Let me think. 0.39071 * 86400 = ?

Well, 0.4 * 86400 is 34560. But since it's 0.39071, which is 0.4 - 0.00929, so 34560 - (0.00929 * 86400).

Compute 0.00929 * 86400:

0.01 *86400 is 864. So 0.00929 is 0.01 - 0.00071, so 864 - (0.00071 *86400).

0.00071 *86400: 0.0007 *86400 is 60.48, and 0.00001 *86400 is 0.864. So 60.48 + 0.864 = 61.344. So 0.00071 *86400=61.344.

So 0.00929 *86400 = 864 - 61.344 = 802.656.

So now, 0.39071 *86400 = 34560 - 802.656 = 33757.344.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, 0.39071 * 86400 = (0.3 + 0.09 + 0.00071) * 86400.

But perhaps it's easier to compute directly:

0.39071 * 86400.

Let me multiply 39071e-7 * 86400.

Wait, perhaps approximate it. 0.39 *86400 is 0.39 *86400 = let's compute:

0.3 * 86400 = 25920.

0.09 *86400 = 7776.

So total 25920 +7776 = 33696.

Then, 0.00071 *86400 = approximately 61.2544.

So 33696 + 61.2544 = 33757.2544.

So about 33757.25 fissions per day.

Wait, but wait, that's only about 3.3e4 fissions? That seems way too low, especially because the options are in the order of 1e8 and such.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check each step.

Wait, the mass of U-238 is 0.055% of 106 kg.

0.055% is 0.00055. 106 * 0.00055.

Compute 100 kg * 0.00055 = 0.055 kg.

6 kg * 0.00055 = 0.0033 kg.

So total 0.055 + 0.0033 = 0.0583 kg. That's correct.

Then, activity rate is 6.7 fissions/kg/s. So 0.0583 kg *6.7 fissions/kg/s.

0.0583 *6.7 = ?

Let me compute 0.05 *6.7=0.335, 0.0083*6.7=0.05571. So sum is 0.39071 fissions per second. That seems correct.

Then, number of seconds in a day is 86400.

So 0.39071 *86400 = ?

0.39071 *86400.

Let me compute 0.39071 * 86400 by breaking it down:

0.3 *86400 = 25,920.

0.09 *86400 = 7,776.

0.00071 *86400 ≈ 61.2544.

Adding them: 25,920 +7,776 = 33,696; plus 61.2544 gives 33,757.2544.

So approximately 33,757 fissions per day. But wait, the options are way higher, like in the hundreds of millions. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents somewhere. Let me recheck the given numbers.

Wait, the activity rate is 6.7 fissions/kg/s. So per kilogram, 6.7 fissions every second.

So for 0.0583 kg, the activity is 0.0583 *6.7 ≈ 0.3907 fissions/s.

Wait, but 0.3907 fissions per second seems low, but let's see.

Wait, but the total time is 86400 seconds, so:

0.3907 fissions/s * 86400 s = 0.3907 *86400 = approx 33,757 fissions per day.

But the options are like 1e8, etc. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, the problem says the sample is 10^6 kg? Wait, no, the problem says "a 106-kg pile of the shale." Oh wait, wait, 1e6 kg is a million kg, but 106 kg is just 106 kg. Let me check the problem again.

Ah, wait the problem says 10^6 kg? Let me read the question again.

Wait, looking back: "Calculate the number of spontaneous fissions in one day in a 106-kg pile of the shale." Oh, okay, so it's 106 kg, not 10^6 kg. So 106 kg is 1.06e2 kg.

So that part was correct. So why is the result so low?

Wait, perhaps the activity rate is in fissions per kg per second, but perhaps it's per day? Or maybe I'm missing a step. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the number to be much higher because I'm miscalculating the mass.

Wait, 0.055% is 0.00055, correct. 106 kg * 0.00055 = 0.0583 kg of U-238.

Wait, 0.0583 kg is 58.3 grams. That's a small amount, but the activity is per kg, so it's 6.7 fissions per second per kg. So for 0.0583 kg, 0.0583 *6.7 = 0.3907 fissions/s.

Hmm, but that's only around 0.39 fissions/s. Multiply by 86,400 seconds, gives about 33,757 fissions per day.

But the options are all in the 1e8 range, like 100 million. So I'm missing something. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the initial data.

Wait, the activity rate is 6.7 fissions per kg per second. The sample has 0.055% U-238 by weight. So 106 kg of shale has 106 * 0.00055 kg U-238, which is 0.0583 kg. Correct.

So 0.0583 kg *6.7 fissions/kg/s = 0.3907 fissions/s.

Wait, unless the activity rate is 6.7e6 or something. But the question says 6.7 fissions/kg/s.

Wait, maybe I missed that the shale is 10^6 kg? Let me read the question again. The question says, "a 106-kg pile." So 106 kg. So 106 is 1.06e2 kg.

Hmm. But then the calculation gives about 3e4 fissions. But the options are about 1e8. So perhaps the activity rate is 6.7e6 fissions/kg/s? Or maybe I read the question wrong.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says: "The spontaneous fission activity rate of U-238 is 6.7 fissions/kg s." So 6.7 per kg per second.

Another possibility is that the fission rate is per gram, not per kg. But the question says per kg, so that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 106 * 0.00055. Let me recalculate:

106 kg * 0.055% = 106 * 0.00055.

106 * 0.0005 is 0.053, and 106 * 0.00005 is 0.0053. So total 0.053 + 0.0053 = 0.0583 kg. Correct.

So 0.0583 kg *6.7 fissions/kg/s = 0.39071 fissions/s.

Multiply by 86400 seconds: 0.39071 * 86400 = approx 33757 fissions.

But according to the options, the closest is E: 1e8, which is 100 million. So I'm way off.

Wait, perhaps the activity rate is 6.7e6 fissions/kg/s. Because 6.7 fissions/kg/s would be extremely low, but perhaps it's 6.7 million. Let me see: 6.7e6 * 0.0583 kg = 6.7e6 *0.0583 ≈ let's compute:

6.7e6 * 0.05 = 3.35e5.

6.7e6 * 0.0083 ≈ 5.561e4.

So total is 3.35e5 + 5.561e4 ≈ 4.0061e5 fissions/s.

4.0061e5 fissions/s *86400 s = 4.0061e5 *8.64e4 = approx 3.456e10 fissions. But that's way higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps the activity rate is 6.7 x 1e6 fissions/kg/s. Because 6.7 fissions/kg/s seems really low. But the question clearly states 6.7 fissions/kg/s.

Hmm, I'm stuck. There's a discrepancy between my calculation and the given options. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the percentage.

Wait, 0.055% is 0.055/100 = 0.00055. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different time unit. Wait, the rate is per second, so the total time is in seconds, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the number of U-238 atoms and then compute the decay constant or something. But the question gives the activity directly as fissions per kg per second, so I think that's not necessary. Activity is given, so I can directly use it.

Another thought: perhaps the 6.7 fissions/kg/s is per second, but I'm not considering the number of atoms. But wait, activity is already given, so I don't need to worry about that.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption about the mass of U-238 is wrong. Let me recompute.

Wait, 106 kg * 0.055% = 106 * 0.00055 = 0.0583 kg. Correct.

So 0.0583 kg *6.7 fissions/kg/s = 0.3907 fissions/s.

Then, in a day, 0.3907 *86400 = 33757. So about 3.3e4 fissions.

But the options start from 1e8. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when converting the percentage.

Wait, 0.055% is not 0.00055. Let me double-check that. Because 1% is 0.01, so 0.055% is 0.055/100 = 0.00055. Correct.

Wait, maybe the shale is 106,000 kg instead of 106 kg? Because 106 kg is small, but 10^6 kg would be a million kg. Let me read the problem again: "a 106-kg pile." So it's 106 kg, not 106,000.

Hmm, seems like I'm stuck. Maybe the problem intended the activity rate to be 6.7e6 fissions/kg/s. Let me try that.

If activity rate is 6.7e6 fissions/kg/s, then:

0.0583 kg *6.7e6 = approx 390,710 fissions/s.

Multiply by 86400 s: 390710 *86400 = approx 3.37e10 fissions. But the options are around 1e8, so that's too high.

Wait, perhaps I have the decimal point wrong in the activity rate. Let me check the question again: "6.7 fissions/kg s." So 6.7 per kg per second.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the U-238 fraction is 0.055%, which is 0.00055, but perhaps I should have used 0.055% of 106 kg as 106 * 0.055 /100, which is indeed 0.0583 kg.

Wait, maybe the problem states the fission rate in fissions per gram per second. Let me check: no, it's per kg.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of moles and then use the Avogadro's number to find the number of atoms, but that's for decay constants, not when the activity is given.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to see what the options are. The options are:

A: 4e8

B:6e8

C:5e7

D:2.5e8

E:1e8

F:2e8

G:7e8

H:4.5e8

I:1.5e8

J:3.2e8

Wait, the closest to my calculation (3.3e4) is nowhere near any of these. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the total mass. Wait, 106 kg is the mass of the shale, but perhaps the U-238 is a fraction of that. So 106 kg * 0.055% is 0.0583 kg, correct.

Wait, another approach: let me think in terms of the computation steps.

Activity (fissions/s) = mass of U-238 (kg) * rate (fissions/kg/s)

So Activity = 0.0583 kg *6.7 fissions/kg/s = 0.3907 fissions/s.

Time in seconds: 86400 s.

Total fissions = 0.3907 *86400 = 33757. So 3.3757e4.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I have the wrong rate. Let me think if I misread the units.

Wait, maybe the rate is 6.7 fissions per
