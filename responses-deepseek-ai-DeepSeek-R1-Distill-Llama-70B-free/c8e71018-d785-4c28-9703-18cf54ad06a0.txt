Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about trypsin, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let's see what I remember about trypsin and enzymes in general.

First, the question has four options: A, B, C, D. I'll go through each one step by step.

Option A says, "It is an organic compound made of proteins." Hmm, trypsin is an enzyme, right? And I remember that most enzymes are proteins. So yes, trypsin is a protein, which is an organic compound. So A is a true statement. So the incorrect answer can't be A.

Option B: "It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction." Catalysts do speed up reactions. Since trypsin is an enzyme, and enzymes act as catalysts, this makes sense. So B is true, meaning the wrong answer isn't B.

Option C: "It is operative over a wide pH range." Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Enzymes typically work best at a specific pH. Trypsin, I think, is active in the small intestine, which is a bit basic. But does it work over a wide range? Or does it have an optimal pH? I remember that if the pH is too high or too low, enzymes denature and lose activity. So maybe trypsin has a narrow pH range where it's effective. If that's the case, then C is false because it's not operative over a wide pH range. That could be the answer. But I'm not 100% sure yet.

Option D: "The rate of catalysis is affected by the concentration of substrate." Oh, right! Enzymes follow the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At lower substrate concentrations, the rate increases with more substrate. But once you reach the Vmax, adding more substrate doesn't change the rate. So yes, the substrate concentration affects the rate, making D a true statement. So D isn't the wrong one.

So, putting it together: the false statement is C because trypsin doesn't operate effectively over a wide pH range. It has an optimal pH where it's most active. So the correct answer should be C.

The question asks which statement about trypsin is NOT true. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Trypsin is an enzyme and enzymes are proteins, which are organic compounds. This statement is true.  
- **Option B**: Trypsin acts as a catalyst, speeding up reactions without being consumed. This is a fundamental property of enzymes, so this statement is true.  
- **Option C**: Enzymes, including trypsin, typically function optimally at a specific pH and are not effective over a wide pH range. This makes the statement false.  
- **Option D**: The rate of enzymatic catalysis is influenced by substrate concentration, as described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This statement is true.  

The false statement is **Option C**, as trypsin does not operate effectively over a wide pH range.  

Answer: C
