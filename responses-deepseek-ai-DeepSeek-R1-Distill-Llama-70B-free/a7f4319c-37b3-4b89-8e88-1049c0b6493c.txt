Question:

Aggressive ants live in the swollen thorns of a small tropical tree and feed on oil-rich bodies that the tree produces at the tips of its leaflets. Which of the following experiments best tests the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects?

Options:

A: Remove oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent ant density.
B: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.
C: Add more oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent leaf damage.
D: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent leaf damage.
E: Remove ants and measure subsequent thorn growth.
F: Add more leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.
G: Remove the thorns and measure subsequent density of ants.
H: Remove the tree and measure subsequent ant density.
I: Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.
J: Add more ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.

Okay, so I need to figure out which experiment best tests the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the setup: Aggressive ants live in the swollen thorns of a tropical tree. These ants feed on oil-rich bodies produced by the tree at the tips of its leaflets. The hypothesis is that these ants protect the plant from leaf-feeding insects. So the question is about testing this defense hypothesis.

I remember that in ecology, when testing whether one organism protects another, you often manipulate the presence of the protector and observe the effect on the variable you're interested in—in this case, the plant's leaves.

So the hypothesis is that ants (the protectors) defend the plant by deterring herbivores (leaf-feeding insects). To test this, you would want to see what happens when the ants are removed. If the ants are gone, and if they were indeed defending the plant, then there should be more damage to the leaves because the herbivores aren't being controlled anymore.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Remove oil-rich bodies and measure ant density. Hmm, that's about whether the ants depend on the oil bodies for food. It doesn't directly test if the ants protect the plant from insects.

Option B: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure ant density. Wait, if you remove the insects, would that affect the ants? Maybe, but the hypothesis is about the ants' effect on the insects, not the other way around. So this might not test the defense hypothesis.

Option C: Add more oil bodies and measure leaf damage. Adding oil might attract more ants, but the question is whether ants reduce leaf damage. This could be a way to see if more ants lead to less damage, which supports the hypothesis, but I'm not sure if it's the most direct test.

Option D: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure leaf damage. But if you remove the insects, the damage should decrease because there are no herbivores left. This doesn't test the role of the ants, though.

Option E: Remove ants and measure thorn growth. That's about the effect of ants on the plant's growth, not directly about leaf damage from insects. So probably not the right choice.

Option F: Add more leaf-feeding insects and measure ant density. This would test if more insects attract more ants, but again, not directly testing the defense effect on the plant.

Option G: Remove thorns and measure ant density. Thorn removal would affect where the ants live, but the question is whether ants protect the plant, not ant habitat.

Option H: Remove the tree and measure ant density. That's irrelevant because without the tree, the ants would probably leave or die, but it doesn’t address the plant defense aspect.

Option I: Remove ants and measure leaf damage. Oh, this looks promising. If the ants are removed and leaf damage increases, that supports the hypothesis that ants were defending the plant. Because without ants, more insects would presumably cause more damage.

Option J: Add more ants and measure leaf damage. If adding ants leads to less damage, that also supports the hypothesis. But which approach is better—removing or adding?

In experimental design, removing the variable (in this case, the ants) is often a direct way to test their effect. So Option I would directly test whether the presence of ants is necessary for reducing leaf damage. If you remove ants and damage increases, it supports the hypothesis.

So the correct answer should be I.

To test the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects, the most direct experiment would involve manipulating the presence of the ants and observing the effect on leaf damage. Specifically, removing the ants and measuring whether leaf damage increases would provide clear evidence for or against the hypothesis. This approach directly tests the necessity of the ants in defending the plant.

Option I, which involves removing ants and measuring subsequent leaf damage, is the best choice because it isolates the effect of the ants on leaf damage. If leaf damage increases after removing the ants, it supports the hypothesis that the ants were defending the plant. Other options either test unrelated variables or are less direct in addressing the hypothesis.

Answer: I
