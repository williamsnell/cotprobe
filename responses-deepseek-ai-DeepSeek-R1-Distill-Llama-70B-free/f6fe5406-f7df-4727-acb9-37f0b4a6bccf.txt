Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: "When the price of pears increases, we expect the following:..." and then there are options A through J. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that when the price of a product goes up, it affects both the demand and supply sides. Let me think about each side.

First, the demand side. I think about the law of demand, which says that as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases, assuming all else is equal. So if pears get more expensive, people will buy fewer of them. That would mean the quantity demanded of pears falls.

Wait, but what about the supply side? The law of supply says that as price increases, quantity supplied increases because producers are incentivized to produce more. So if pear prices go up, pear farmers would likely supply more pears.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Quantity supplied of pears falls. No, that's the opposite of what I thought. Higher price should lead to more supply, not less.

Option B: The price of apples falls. Hmm, maybe if pears are more expensive, people might buy more apples as a substitute. But does that mean the price of apples would fall? I'm not sure. If demand for apples increases, their price might rise instead, unless supply increases too. But the question is about what happens when the price of pears increases, not necessarily the cause. I'm not convinced B is correct.

Option C: No change in quantity demanded or supplied. That can't be right because price changes should affect both.

Option D: The price of pears falls. Wait, that's the opposite of what's happening. The question states the price increases, so D doesn't make sense.

Option E: Quantity demanded of pears falls. That aligns with the law of demand. So E seems correct.

Option F: Surplus of pears. A surplus occurs when quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded. If price goes up, quantity demanded falls and quantity supplied rises. So yes, that could create a surplus. But I'm not sure if that's the direct effect the question is pointing at.

Option G: Quantity demanded rises. No, that's opposite of what happens when price increases.

Option H: Demand for pears falls. Wait, is that the same as quantity demanded? I think demand is the whole curve, whereas quantity demanded is the amount at a specific price. So if price increases, quantity demanded falls, but the demand itself (the curve) doesn't shift unless other factors change. So H is about a shift in demand, which isn't necessarily what's happening here.

Option I: Quantity supplied rises. Yes, that's correct according to the law of supply. So I is also a possible answer.

Option J: Demand for pears rises. Again, this is about the demand curve shifting, which isn't indicated here. So no, J isn't correct.

So from the options, both E and I seem correct. But the question is asking what we expect when the price increases. So when price increases, quantity demanded decreases (E) and quantity supplied increases (I). But the question is phrased as "we expect the following," so perhaps more than one effect. However, looking at the options, each is a single statement.

Wait the options are each individual statements, so perhaps the correct answer includes both E and I, but looking at the choices, the options are separate. So the question is a bit unclear. Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the effect on the quantity demanded, which would be E.

Alternatively, the question might be about what happens in a market when price increases, but in reality, the correct understanding is that quantity demanded decreases and quantity supplied increases, but in the options, each is a separate choice.

Looking back, the question says "we expect the following," so perhaps both E and I are correct, but the options don't allow selecting multiple. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the supply side. Wait, no, the question doesn't specify which side.

Wait, maybe I misread the question. It says "when the price of pears increases," which could be due to a shift in demand or supply. But regardless, the immediate effect is that at a higher price, quantity demanded falls and quantity supplied rises.

So the possible correct answers would be E and I. But since each option is a separate choice, perhaps the intended answer is E, because the question might be focusing on the demand side effect.

Wait, but the options are for each individually. So in the given options, both E and I are correct effects. But the question is phrased as "we expect the following," so perhaps the answer expects multiple correct options, but the way the question is set up, each option is a possible choice. However, looking at the options, each is a separate possible answer.

Wait, looking again, the options are A through J, each a statement. So the correct answer could include E and I, but the options are presented as individual choices. So perhaps the intended answer is E, as the demand side effect.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge that when price increases, the quantity supplied increases. So I is also correct.

Wait, but the question is about what we expect to happen. So both E and I are correct. However, looking at the options, perhaps the question is looking for one correct answer. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E and I, but since the options are individual, maybe the answer expects both. But since each option is a separate choice, perhaps the correct answers are E and I.

But the way the question is phrased, it's a multiple-choice with options A to J, each being a possible correct answer. So perhaps the intended correct answers are E and I, but since we can only choose one, perhaps the question is more about the demand side.

Wait, but the answer expects a single letter. So I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about what's typically expected in such a question.

In most economics textbooks, when price increases, quantity demanded decreases (law of demand), and quantity supplied increases (law of supply). So both E and I are correct. But since the options don't include a choice that combines both, perhaps the intended answer is E, as the question might be focusing on the demand side.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that when price increases, suppliers will supply more, so I is correct.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again.

The question is: When the price of pears increases, what do we expect?

Options:

A: QS falls → No, QS rises.

B: Price of apples falls → Not necessarily; depends on if they're substitutes.

C: No change → No.

D: Price of pears falls → Opposite.

E: Qd falls → Correct.

F: Surplus → Possible if QS > Qd.

G: Qd rises → No.

H: Demand falls → No, demand is a curve; quantity demanded falls.

I: QS rises → Correct.

J: Demand rises → No.

So both E and I are correct, but the options don't allow selecting both. So perhaps the intended answer is E and I. But the options are individual.

Wait, the options are each possible answers, and the question is asking which of the options is correct. So both E and I would be correct, but in the given options, each is a separate choice. So perhaps the answer expects both, but since that's not possible, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E and I, but since the options are individual, maybe the correct approach is to select both. But the way the question is phrased, it's a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the answer expects E, because it's talking about the effect on quantity demanded, which is a direct consequence of a price increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both E and I, but since each is an option, the question expects us to choose both. But in the given format, each is a separate option, so perhaps the correct answers are E and I.

But the problem is that the user expects a single letter answer. So maybe I should think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only one side of the market. So if the price increases, producers supply more, so I is correct. But the question doesn't specify whether it's about supply or demand.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E because when price increases, quantity demanded decreases, which is more directly related to the consumer side.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.

In a typical supply and demand graph, when price increases, the quantity demanded moves along the demand curve to the left (so E is correct), and the quantity supplied moves along the supply curve to the right (so I is correct).

Therefore, both E and I are correct. However, looking at the options, each is a separate choice. But the question is presented as a multiple-choice with one correct answer, so perhaps only one of them is among the options as the correct choice.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

E: Quantity demanded of pears falls.

I: Quantity supplied of pears rises.

So both E and I are correct. But the way the question is phrased, perhaps the intended answer is both, but since it's a single selection, perhaps the answer expects both. But in the given options, each is a separate choice, so perhaps the correct answer includes both E and I.

Wait, but the question asks "we expect the following:" which suggests that more than one could be correct, but the options are each individual. So perhaps the correct answer is that both E and I occur, but since the options don't include a combined option, maybe the correct answer is either E or I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the effect on the supply side, so I is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what's more likely to be the intended answer. In most cases, when the price increases, the immediate thought is that quantity demanded decreases, which is E. So perhaps E is the correct answer intended here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the supply side effect, so I is the correct answer.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each option says.

Option E says the quantity demanded falls, which is correct.

Option I says the quantity supplied rises, which is also correct.

So both E and I are correct. But since the options are individual, perhaps the answer expects both. But since the question is a multiple-choice with one answer, perhaps I should look for which of these is an option.

Wait, but in the options, both E and I are present. So perhaps the correct answer is both E and I, but since the user is expecting a single letter, I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is phrased as "we expect the following:", so perhaps both E and I are correct, but since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding that when price increases, the quantity supplied increases, so I is correct.

I think I need to decide. Based on standard economics, both E and I are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the answer expects both, but as the user is to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A-J, each with a single statement.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both E and I, but since they're not combined, perhaps the intended answer is E and I, but since I can't choose both, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, I think that the correct answer is E and I. But since the question is presented as a single-choice, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but in reality, both happen. So perhaps the correct answer includes both E and I, but since each is an option, perhaps the correct answer is both, but the options don't allow that.

Wait, perhaps the answer expects both E and I to be correct, but since each is a separate option, perhaps the correct answer is either E or I. But the question is to choose one.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The law of demand says higher price leads to lower quantity demanded. The law of supply says higher price leads to higher quantity supplied. So both E and I are correct.

But looking at the options, they are separate. So perhaps the intended answer is E and I, but since they are individual options, perhaps the correct answer is both. But the way the question is set up, perhaps the answer expects both.

Wait, but the options don't include a choice that combines E and I. So perhaps the question expects both, but in the given options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E and I, but since the user is to select one, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the effect on the market, like a surplus. So when price increases, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, leading to a surplus, which is option F.

But that's only if the price is set above equilibrium. So if the price increases beyond equilibrium, then yes, there's a surplus. But the question doesn't specify whether the price is at equilibrium or not. So perhaps F is also a possible answer.

Wait, but the question is a general statement: when price increases, what happens. So regardless of equilibrium, the immediate effects are that Qd decreases and Qs increases. So E and I are correct.

So I think the correct answers are E and I. But since the question expects a single choice, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more focused on the supply side, so I is correct.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the most direct answers are E and I. Since I can't choose both, maybe the intended answer is E.

Wait, but the question is from the perspective of what happens when price increases. So both effects happen. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but since the options don't allow that, perhaps the answer is both E and I.

But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is E and I, but since each is a separate option, perhaps the correct answer is both. But the user expects a single letter, so perhaps I'm to choose both.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E and I, but the options don't allow that, so maybe the correct answer is E and I, but since I have to choose one, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, perhaps I should check my notes. Oh right, when price increases, quantity demanded decreases (E) and quantity supplied increases (I). So both are correct.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the intended answer is E and I, but since that's not possible, perhaps the answer expects both.

Wait, but the user is expecting a single letter, so perhaps I should choose both, but I can't. Alternatively, I'll have to pick one.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F: surplus, but that depends on whether the price is above equilibrium.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The safest answer is E and I, but since I can't choose both, perhaps the intended answer is E.

When the price of pears increases, we expect two key effects based on the laws of demand and supply:

1. **Quantity Demanded Falls (Law of Demand):** As the price of pears rises, consumers will buy fewer pears, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded. This is captured in option **E**.

2. **Quantity Supplied Rises (Law of Supply):** Conversely, as the price of pears increases, producers are incentivized to supply more pears, leading to an increase in the quantity supplied. This is captured in option **I**.

Both effects are correct and occur simultaneously when the price increases. However, since the question requires selecting only one option, and the focus is often on the demand side in such questions, the most direct and likely intended answer is **E: Quantity demanded of pears falls**.

Answer: E
