Okay, so I have this physics problem here about work done by a force on a particle moving along a path. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that F is a constant unit force parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1). So F must be a vector in the same direction as (-1,0,1), but since it's a unit force, I think I need to normalize that vector first. Wait, right, a unit vector has magnitude 1. So let's compute the magnitude of (-1,0,1).

The magnitude would be sqrt((-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 0 +1) = sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, I divide each component by sqrt(2). So the unit vector in that direction is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Therefore, the force F must be this unit vector multiplied by the magnitude of the force. Wait, but the problem says it's a unit force, so F should have a magnitude of 1. So F is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

Got it. Now, the particle moves along the path given by (t, t², t³) from t=0 to t=1. I need to find the work done by F on the particle along this path.

I remember that work is calculated as the integral of the dot product of the force and the displacement vector. Or wait, more precisely, the work done is the integral from t=a to t=b of F · dr/dt dt, where dr/dt is the velocity vector.

Alternatively, since F is constant, the work can also be expressed as F · the displacement vector, but that's only when the force is constant and the path is straight. Wait no, that's only in the case where the path is a straight line. Since the given path is a curve (because it's a cubic function in z), I can't use the simple F·(r(b)-r(a)) formula. So I have to compute the line integral along the path.

So, first, let's parameterize the position vector r(t) = (t, t², t³), where t goes from 0 to 1. Then, the derivative dr/dt is (1, 2t, 3t²). 

The force F is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). 

The work W is the integral from t=0 to t=1 of F · (dr/dt) dt.

So let's compute the dot product F · dr/dt.

F · dr/dt = (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 + 0 * 2t + (1/sqrt(2)) * 3t².

Simplify that: (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + 3t²/sqrt(2) = [3t² - 1]/sqrt(2).

So the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to 1 of [3t² -1]/sqrt(2) dt.

I can factor out the 1/sqrt(2) from the integral, so it becomes (1/sqrt(2)) ∫ (3t² -1) dt from 0 to 1.

Compute the integral ∫ (3t² -1) dt. The integral of 3t² is t^3, and the integral of -1 is -t. So the antiderivative is t^3 - t.

Evaluate from 0 to 1:

At t=1: (1)^3 -1 = 1 -1 = 0.

At t=0: 0 -0 =0.

So the integral from 0 to1 is 0 - 0 =0.

Wait, that can't be right. So the work done is (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = 0.

But I'm looking at the options, option I is 0. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, let's go back. When I computed F · dr/dt, I had (-1/sqrt(2))(1) + (1/sqrt(2))(3t²). So that's (-1 +3t²)/sqrt(2). So the integrand is (3t² -1)/sqrt(2). Integrating that from 0 to1.

Integral of 3t² is t^3, integral of -1 is -t. So the antiderivative is t^3 - t, evaluated at 1 and 0.

At t=1: 1-1=0. At t=0: 0-0=0. So the difference is 0. So the work is zero.

Wait, but why is the work zero? Because the force is perpendicular to the displacement on average? Hmm, maybe because the path's projection along the force direction results in symmetric contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of F. Let me confirm F again. The force is parallel to (-1,0,1). So the unit vector is (-1,0,1)/sqrt(2). Correct. So that part is right.

Another thing: the velocity vector is correct as (1, 2t, 3t²). So the dot product computation is correct.

Hmm, so the integral is zero. So the work done is zero. So the correct answer would be option I: 0.

Wait but looking back at the options, I is 0. So that's the answer.

To determine the work done by the force \( \mathbf{F} \) on the particle moving along the path \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t^2, t^3) \) from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \), we start by noting that \( \mathbf{F} \) is a unit force parallel to the vector \( (-1, 0, 1) \). 

### Step 1: Normalize the direction vector
The magnitude of \( (-1, 0, 1) \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
Thus, the unit vector in the direction of \( (-1, 0, 1) \) is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, 0, 1).
\]
Since \( \mathbf{F} \) is a unit force, it is given by:
\[
\mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, 0, 1).
\]

### Step 2: Parameterize the path and compute the velocity
The position vector is \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t^2, t^3) \). The velocity vector is the derivative of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) with respect to \( t \):
\[
\mathbf{v}(t) = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = (1, 2t, 3t^2).
\]

### Step 3: Compute the dot product \( \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) \)
The dot product is:
\[
\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0) \cdot 2t + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) \cdot 3t^2.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 + \frac{3t^2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3t^2 - 1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 4: Set up and evaluate the integral for work
The work \( W \) is given by:
\[
W = \int_{0}^{1} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) \, dt = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \int_{0}^{1} (3t^2 - 1) \, dt.
\]
Factoring out \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), we compute the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (3t^2 - 1) \, dt = \left[ t^3 - t \right]_{0}^{1}.
\]
Evaluating at \( t = 1 \):
\[
1^3 - 1 = 0.
\]
Evaluating at \( t = 0 \):
\[
0^3 - 0 = 0.
\]
Thus, the integral evaluates to \( 0 - 0 = 0 \), and the work is:
\[
W = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 = 0.
\]

### Final Answer
The work done by the force is zero. The correct option is:

**I: 0**
