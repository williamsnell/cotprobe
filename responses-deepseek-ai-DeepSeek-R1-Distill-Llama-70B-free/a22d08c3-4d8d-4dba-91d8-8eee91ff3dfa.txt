The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A minor child was eating a fish sandwich in a fast food restaurant when a large metal object, later identified as a fish hook, got caught in her throat. The trapped hook caused her to cough blood uncontrollably, and she was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by showing that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence. Will the lawsuit be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant?

Options:

A: No, because the restaurant should have provided a warning about potential hazards in their food.
B: Yes, because the child should have been supervised while eating.
C: Yes, because the restaurant cannot control what is in the fish they receive from suppliers.
D: Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.
E: No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.
F: No, because the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks.
G: Yes, because customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it.
H: No, because the restaurant should have had a procedure in place to prevent such incidents.
I: Yes, because the restaurant did everything reasonable to ensure the safety of their food.
J: No, because the restaurant should have checked each fish individually for hooks.

Okay, so I've got this question about a legal case involving a minor who got a fish hook in her throat while eating a fish sandwich at a fast-food restaurant. The restaurant is being sued, but they're defending by saying they did everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects and weren't negligent. I need to figure out if the lawsuit would be dismissed or not.

First, I should remember the basics of negligence and product liability. In a negligence case, the plaintiff has to prove that the defendant owed a duty, breached that duty, caused harm, and actual damages. If the restaurant did everything reasonable, maybe they didn't breach their duty, so no negligence.

But wait, there's also strict liability. Strict liability applies when a product has a defect that makes it unreasonably dangerous. So even if the restaurant wasn't negligent, if the product was defective, they could still be liable. But the options don't all mention strict liability.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the restaurant should have provided a warning. I don't think so because it's a fish sandwich, and the presence of a fish hook isn't something you'd expect. They might not need to warn about that unless it's a known risk.

Option B says the child should have been supervised. That sounds more like contributory negligence, but the question is about the restaurant's liability, not the parent's. So maybe not relevant here.

Option C says the restaurant can't control suppliers. But under strict liability, the seller can be liable regardless of fault. So even if the supplier is at fault, the restaurant might still be liable.

Option D says the customer assumes the risk of metal hooks in fish. That doesn't sound right because a fish hook is not a typical risk people expect when buying a sandwich. It's not like bones, which are common, but a hook is unusual.

Option E says there's strict liability for an unreasonably dangerous product. That seems possible. If the sandwich with a hook is a defective product, strict liability applies even without negligence.

Option F is about not posting a warning. Similar to A, but I don't think a warning is necessary here because it's not a usual hazard.

Option G says customers expect foreign objects. That doesn't make sense because you don't expect a fish hook in your food.

Option H says the restaurant should have a procedure. But the question states they did everything reasonable, so this might not apply.

Option I says the restaurant did everything reasonable, so no negligence. So if negligence is the claim, maybe the lawsuit is dismissed. But if it's strict liability, then even without negligence, they could lose.

Option J says they should have checked each fish. That's probably too strict; it's not reasonable to expect individual checking of every fish.

So the key issue is whether this is a negligence case or strict liability. The question says the restaurant's defense is that they were not negligent. So if the claim is based on negligence, the lawsuit might be dismissed. But if it's strict liability, the restaurant could still lose.

Looking back, the options: E says strict liability applies. So if that's the case, the lawsuit wouldn't be dismissed. But option I says yes, judgment for the restaurant because they did everything reasonable, implying no negligence.

Wait, the question is about whether the lawsuit is dismissed. So if the restaurant isn't negligent, then the negligence claim fails. But if strict liability applies, the restaurant is still liable.

So the options are whether the lawsuit is dismissed (judgment for restaurant) or not.

So option E says no, because strict liability applies. Option I says yes, because no negligence.

So the answer depends on whether the claim is based on negligence or strict liability.

The question is a bit ambiguous, but the lawsuit is based on the restaurant's negligence, as the defense is that they weren't negligent. But the question is about the outcome. If the restaurant wasn't negligent, the negligence claim fails, so the lawsuit would be dismissed, and judgment entered for the restaurant.

Wait, but some jurisdictions might impose strict liability on restaurants for serving defective products, even if they weren't negligent. So under strict liability, the restaurant could be liable regardless of their care.

But the options don't all present this. Option E says yes to strict liability, others mention negligence.

So perhaps the correct answer is E, but let's see.

Wait, the options: the question is whether the lawsuit will be dismissed. If the restaurant is not negligent, and the claim is based on negligence, then yes, it's dismissed. But if it's strict liability, then no, the lawsuit isn't dismissed.

I think in product liability cases, restaurants can be held strictly liable if they sell a defective product. So even if they weren't negligent, they could still be liable.

So the correct answer would be E: No, because strict liability applies.

Wait, but the options are a bit different. Let me read the options again.

Option E: No, because even without negligence, strict liability applies for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.

So if that's the case, the lawsuit wouldn't be dismissed; the restaurant would be liable. So the answer would be E.

But I'm a bit confused because the restaurant's defense is that they did everything reasonable, which would negate negligence but not strict liability.

So the answer should be E. So the lawsuit is not dismissed; the restaurant is liable under strict liability.

The question revolves around whether a restaurant can be held liable when a child found a fish hook in her sandwich, causing injury. The restaurant defends by stating it was not negligent and did everything reasonable to ensure safety. The key issue is whether the lawsuit will be dismissed or if the restaurant can still be liable under strict liability.

In negligence cases, the plaintiff must prove the defendant owed a duty, breached it, caused harm, and resulted in damages. If the restaurant did everything reasonable, it likely did not breach its duty, and the negligence claim would fail. However, strict liability applies when a product is unreasonably dangerous, even if the seller was not negligent. Restaurants can be held strictly liable for selling defective products, such as food containing foreign objects like a fish hook, which is not a foreseeable risk for consumers.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The restaurant is not required to warn about unforeseeable hazards like a fish hook in a sandwich.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The lawsuit focuses on the restaurant's liability, not the parent's supervision.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Strict liability applies regardless of the restaurant's control over suppliers.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Customers do not assume the risk of encountering a fish hook, as it is an unusual and unforeseeable hazard.
- **Option E**: Correct. Strict liability applies even without negligence if the product is unreasonably dangerous.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. A warning is not necessary for such an unforeseeable hazard.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Customers do not expect foreign objects like a fish hook in their food.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The restaurant is said to have done everything reasonable, so this does not apply.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the restaurant may not have been negligent, strict liability still applies.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. It is not reasonable to expect the restaurant to check every fish individually.

The correct answer is **E**, as strict liability applies even if the restaurant was not negligent, making the lawsuit not dismissed.
