Question:

An orange grove and a vineyard are adjoining tracts of land located in a county. In 2006, a farmer purchased the orange grove, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The vineyard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the orange grove, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the vineyard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $200,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher farmer deed nor the farmer  investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the orange grove. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that the orange grove abuts a public highway. The only access to that public highway for the vineyard is across the orange grove. If the investor initiates an appropriate action to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove, she should

Options:

A: prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.
B: prevail, because the farmer was aware of the easement when he purchased the vineyard.
C: not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.
D: prevail, because the vineyard has no other access to the public highway.
E: not prevail, because the easement was never actually used by the shepherd.
F: prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.
G: prevail, because the right-of-way was granted by a remote predecessor and not the farmer.
H: not prevail, because the farmer has the right to revoke the easement at any time.
I: not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.
J: not prevail, because the right-of-way was not included in the farmer-investor deed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real property question about easements. Let's break it down step by step. I remember that easements can be a bit tricky, especially when dealing with appurtenant easements and how they transfer with property sales.

The scenario: There's an orange grove and a vineyard next to each other. The farmer bought the orange grove in 2006, and it's a 10-acre tract with fee simple absolute. The vineyard, which is 20 acres, was owned by a rancher, also in fee simple. 

Wait, there's a predecessor of the farmer who granted an easement to a shepherd. This easement was appurtenant to the vineyard, meaning it benefits the vineyard and burdens the orange grove. The easement was for a right of way, and it was properly recorded. But the shepherd never used it. 

Then, in 2010, the rancher sells the vineyard to the farmer. So now the farmer owns both the orange grove and the vineyard. Then in 2011, the farmer sells the vineyard to an investor for $200k, and the deed doesn't mention the easement. 

The investor is now claiming she has the right of way across the orange grove, but the farmer says no. The orange grove abuts a public highway, and the only access to it for the vineyard is across the orange grove. 

So the question is whether the investor can use the right of way. The options are A through J.

Easements appurtenant require two properties: the dominant tenement (benefitting) and the servient tenement (burdened). Here, the vineyard was the dominant, and the orange grove the servient. The easement was created by a predecessor of the farmer, so it's a pre-existing easement.

When the farmer bought the vineyard from the rancher, he became the owner of both the vineyard and the orange grove. Hmm, so if one person owns both the dominant and servient estates, does the easement still exist? I think this is about merger. Merger can extinguish an easement when the same person owns both estates. But wait, merger isn't automatic, right? It's when the two estates are held by the same person, and the easement is extinguished because the necessity for the easement is gone.

But in this case, the farmer later sells the vineyard to the investor. So when the farmer owned both, the easement might have been extinguished by merger. But when he sold the vineyard, does the easement spring back into existence? Or was it already gone?

Wait, no. If the easement was extinguished when the farmer acquired the vineyard, then when he sells it again, the easement wouldn't automatically come back. Because the merger would have ended it. So the investor wouldn't have the easement anymore.

Alternatively, maybe the merger doesn't apply here. Because the easement was appurtenant to the vineyard, and the farmer only owned the vineyard for a short time before selling it. But I'm a bit confused about when merger occurs. I think that when the same person owns both the dominant and servient estates, the easement is extinguished. So when the farmer bought the vineyard, he owned both, so the easement was extinguished. Then, when he sold the vineyard, the easement wouldn't exist anymore because it was already gone.

So looking at the options:

Option C says the easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the vineyard. That would mean the investor can't prevail because the easement no longer exists.

Option D says she should prevail because the vineyard has no other access. But if the easement was extinguished, that wouldn't matter. So the necessity wouldn't matter if the easement was already ended.

Option A says once recorded, it remains until released. But if merger happened, it's released automatically, I think.

Option E says she doesn't prevail because the easement wasn't used. But non-use doesn't extinguish an easement unless there's abandonment, which requires intent and usually more than just non-use.

So the key is whether the merger when the farmer bought the vineyard extinguished the easement. If yes, then the investor doesn't have it. So the correct answer would be C.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure. Because the original easement was created when the orange grove and vineyard were separate. When the farmer bought the vineyard, he owned both, so the easement was extinguished. Then when he sells the vineyard, the easement isn't recreated because it was already gone. So the investor doesn't get it.

Alternatively, maybe the easement wasn't extinguished because the farmer only owned both for a short time. But I think once he owns both, the easement is gone regardless of how long he owns them.

So the answer should be C: not prevail because merger extinguished the easement.

The question revolves around whether an easement appurtenant created for the benefit of the vineyard (dominant tenement) and burdening the orange grove (servient tenement) survives after changes in ownership. The easement was properly recorded but never used by the original beneficiary (the shepherd). The farmer, who initially owned the orange grove, later acquired the vineyard in 2010, bringing both properties under common ownership. This raises the issue of "merger," where an easement can be extinguished when the same party owns both the dominant and servient estates. 

When the farmer sold the vineyard to the investor in 2011, the easement would not automatically reattach because it had already been extinguished by merger during the farmer's ownership. The investor's claim to the easement fails because the easement was no longer in existence when the vineyard was sold. While the vineyard's lack of alternative access to the public highway might seem relevant, it does not revive an easement that has been extinguished. Other options, such as non-use or failure to mention the easement in deeds, are less critical than the legal effect of merger.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.
