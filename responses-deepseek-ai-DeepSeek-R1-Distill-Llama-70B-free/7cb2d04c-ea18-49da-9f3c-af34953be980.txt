Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the mass flow rate of oil being pumped through a pipe. The question gives me a bunch of parameters, and I'm supposed to find the correct option from A to J. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the horsepower required to pump the oil is 6, and the efficiency of the pump is 75%. The oil has a density of 60 lb/ft³ and a kinematic viscosity of 0.02 ft²/sec. The pipe is 4 inches in diameter and 250 feet long. I need to find the mass flow rate in tons per hour.

Wait, wait. I remember that horsepower is a unit of power, which relates to work done over time. And since the pump's efficiency is given, I think I need to find the actual work done by the pump, considering the efficiency. Efficiency is the ratio of useful work output to the energy input, right? So if the pump is 75% efficient, that means for every horsepower of input, it's actually doing 0.75 horsepower worth of useful work.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the horsepower given is the required horsepower. Or is it the input or output? Oh, wait, the problem says the horsepower required is 6, with the pump's efficiency being 75%. Hmm, I think that the 6 horsepower is the power delivered by the pump. Or is it the power input? Wait, no, I think that the power required (the shaft work) is 6 hp, but since the pump is only 75% efficient, maybe the actual power input is higher? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. The problem says the horsepower required to pump is 6, and efficiency is 75%. So perhaps that 6 hp is the power that the pump actually imparts to the fluid, meaning the useful work done on the fluid. Because sometimes, when they talk about required horsepower, they mean the power that needs to be delivered to the fluid, which would be the output power of the pump. But then the pump's efficiency would relate the input power (what's supplied to the pump, like from the motor) to the output power (what's actually used to pump the fluid). So in that case, if the useful power is 6 hp, and efficiency is 75%, the input power would be higher. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by finding the flow rate first. I remember that the power required to pump a fluid can be calculated using the formula involving head loss and flow rate. The power (P) is equal to the weight flow rate (W) multiplied by the head (h), divided by the pump efficiency. Hmm, no, wait. Let me get the right formula.

Wait, the general formula for pump power is P = (Q * γ * H) / (η), where Q is the volumetric flow rate, γ is the specific weight of the fluid (weight per unit volume), H is the head (height) the fluid is lifted, and η is the efficiency. But wait, in this problem, I'm not given H. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, no, the problem is about friction loss in the pipe, not lifting. Oh wait, the question is about pumping through a pipe, so maybe the head here is the head loss due to friction in the pipe. Because when you pump a fluid through a pipe, the pump has to do work to overcome the friction losses, which cause a pressure drop along the pipe.

Ah, right! So I think the head loss (h_f) in a pipe is given by the Darcy-Weisbach equation: h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D), where f is the Darcy friction factor, L is the length of the pipe, v is the average flow velocity, g is acceleration due to gravity, and D is the pipe diameter.

But wait, then to find the power required, the formula would be P = (Q * γ * h_f) / η. Since Q is the volumetric flow rate, γ is the specific weight (lb/ft³), and h_f is the head loss. But then I need to find Q, which is area times velocity (A * v), so maybe I can express everything in terms of velocity.

Wait, but I don't know the velocity yet. Alternatively, I might need to find the velocity using the power equation. Let's think about this step by step.

First, let's note down all the given data:

- Horsepower (P) = 6 hp
- Efficiency (η) = 75% = 0.75
- Oil density (ρ) = 60 lb/ft³
- Kinematic viscosity (ν) = 0.02 ft²/s
- Pipe diameter (D) = 4 inches = 4/12 ft = 1/3 ft ≈ 0.3333 ft
- Pipe length (L) = 250 ft

I need to find the mass flow rate (ṁ), which is mass per unit time, typically in lb/s or lb/hr. Since the options are in tons per hour, I'll need to convert accordingly.

Wait, but first, let's clarify the approach. The power required by the pump is used to overcome the friction losses in the pipe. So the power equation is P = (Q * γ * h_f) / η. Since the pump's efficiency is 75%, that means that the input power is higher than the useful power, but wait, the 6 hp is the required power, perhaps it's the useful power output. Wait, I think that P here is the power delivered to the fluid, so that would be the useful power, and then the input power would be higher. But in the formula, I think P is the useful power, so the equation would be:

Useful Power (P) = (Q * γ * h_f) * η. Or wait, no. Let me get this right. The useful power is the power delivered to the fluid, so P = (Q * γ * h_f) / η. Because η is the efficiency, which is the ratio of useful power out to the power supplied in. So if the pump's efficiency is 75%, then the useful power is 0.75 times the input power. So in this problem, if the required horsepower is 6 hp, that would be the useful power. So, P (useful) = 6 hp.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's be precise.

The formula for the power required by the pump (shaft work per unit time) is:

P = (Weight flow rate) * (Head) / (η)

Where Weight flow rate is in lb/s, Head is in feet, and P is in horsepower.

Wait, but in this case, the head would be the head loss due to friction, h_f. So,

P = (Q * γ * h_f) / η

Because Q is the volumetric flow rate in ft³/s, γ is lb/ft³, so Q*γ would be lb/s, which is weight per second, so weight flow rate. Then h_f is in feet, so (lb/s)*ft gives lb·ft/s, which is equivalent to horsepower (since 1 hp = 550 lb·ft/s). So the formula becomes:

P = (Q * γ * h_f) / η

But I need to express Q in terms of velocity. Since Q = A * v, and A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe.

So, first, find A. The pipe diameter is 4 inches, which is 1/3 ft. So radius is 1/6 ft. The cross-sectional area A = π * (D/2)^2 = π*(1/6)^2 = π/36 ≈ 0.08727 ft².

So Q = A * v = (π/36) * v.

Now, the head loss h_f can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D)

But I need to find the friction factor f. To find f, I can use the Colebrook-White equation or the Moody diagram, but since the flow is likely turbulent, maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, since I have the kinematic viscosity, I can calculate the Reynolds number and find f accordingly.

The Reynolds number Re is given by Re = (v * D) / ν

So plugging in the values: D is 0.3333 ft, ν is 0.02 ft²/s.

Re = v * 0.3333 / 0.02 = v * 16.665

Depending on the value of Re, f can be determined. Let's assume that the flow is turbulent, so Re is greater than 4000, which is the usual cutoff for turbulent flow.

But since I don't know v yet, perhaps I can express h_f in terms of v and substitute back into the power equation.

Let me write down all the equations.

First, h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D)

Then, Q = (π/36) * v

So P = (Q * γ * h_f) / η

Substituting Q and h_f:

P = [(π/36)*v] * [60 lb/ft³] * [ (f * 250 * v²) / (2 * 32.2 ft/s² * 0.3333 ft) ) ] / 0.75

Wait, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can solve for v.

But wait, I'm missing the value of f, the friction factor. So perhaps I can make an initial assumption for f, solve for v, then check Re and find f more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express f in terms of Re, using an approximation like the Swamee-Jain equation, which is valid for turbulent flow:

f = (1/4) * log( (ε/(3.7 D)) + (5.74)/Re^0.9 ) )^(-2)

But wait, the problem doesn't give the pipe's roughness ε. Hmm, that's a problem. Oh wait, perhaps it's assumed to be hydraulically smooth, or maybe ε is negligible. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the Hazen-Williams equation, but that's for head loss in terms of velocity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for f using the relation for laminar flow, but given the Re is probably high, that might not apply.

Wait, perhaps I can make an initial assumption that the flow is turbulent and use f = 0.02, a common approximation for turbulent flow in pipes. Let me check that later.

Alternatively, another approach: The power required by the pump is 6 hp, which is equal to the rate of doing work to overcome the friction losses. So, P = (mass flow rate) * g * h_f. Wait, but mass flow rate is in lb/s (since lb is a unit of force, not mass, but in the English system, lb mass is sometimes used with gc). Hmm, perhaps this approach is more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should better start by finding the volumetric flow rate Q, then find the mass flow rate from that.

So, let's try to express everything in terms of v.

So, from the power equation:

P = (Q * γ * h_f) / η

We have P = 6 hp, η = 0.75, γ = 60 lb/ft³.

Expressed in consistent units:

1 hp = 550 lb·ft/s.

So 6 hp = 6 * 550 = 3300 lb·ft/s.

So:

3300 = (Q * 60 * h_f) / 0.75

So 3300 = (Q * 60 * h_f) / 0.75

Multiply both sides by 0.75:

3300 * 0.75 = Q * 60 * h_f

2475 = Q * 60 * h_f

So Q * h_f = 2475 / 60 = 41.25

Now, Q = A * v = (π/36) * v

h_f = (f * L * v^2) / (2 * g * D)

Substituting these into Q * h_f = 41.25:

(π/36 * v) * [ (f * 250 * v^2) / (2 * 32.2 * 0.3333) ) ] = 41.25

Simplify the denominator in h_f:

2 * 32.2 * 0.3333 ≈ 2 * 32.2 * 0.3333 ≈ 2 * 10.7266 ≈ 21.4532

So h_f ≈ (f * 250 * v²) / 21.4532

Now, putting it all together:

(π/36 * v) * (f * 250 * v² / 21.4532) = 41.25

Simplify:

(π * f * 250 * v^3) / (36 * 21.4532) = 41.25

Compute the denominator: 36 * 21.4532 ≈ 772.3152

So:

(π * f * 250 * v^3) / 772.3152 ≈ 41.25

Multiply both sides by 772.3152:

π * f * 250 * v^3 ≈ 41.25 * 772.3152 ≈ 31851.33

So:

v^3 ≈ 31851.33 / (π * f * 250)

Hmm, but I still have two unknowns: v and f. Because f depends on the Reynolds number, which depends on v.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can assume a value for f to start with, compute v, then compute Re, and find a better f, and iterate until it converges.

Let me assume f = 0.02, which is a reasonable value for turbulent flow in a pipe with some roughness.

Plugging f = 0.02:

v^3 ≈ 31851.33 / (π * 0.02 * 250) = 31851.33 / (π * 5) ≈ 31851.33 / 15.70796 ≈ 2028.3

So v^3 ≈ 2028.3 → v ≈ cube root of 2028.3 ≈ 12.67 ft/s

Wait, that seems quite high. Let me check the calculation.

Wait, 12.67 ft/s is about 8.64 mph, which seems fast for pipe flow, but maybe it's possible.

Now, let's compute the Reynolds number Re = v * D / ν

v = 12.67 ft/s, D = 0.3333 ft, ν = 0.02 ft²/s

Re = (12.67 * 0.3333) / 0.02 ≈ (4.223) / 0.02 ≈ 211.15

Wait, that's way below the turbulent flow regime (Re > 4000). So my initial assumption of f=0.02 is incorrect because at Re=211, the flow is laminar, and f would be 64/Re, which is 64/211 ≈ 0.303.

Hmm, that's a problem. So I need to recalculate with f ≈ 0.303.

Wait, but if the flow is laminar, then f = 64/Re, which is 64/( (v D)/ν ) = 64 ν/(v D)

Wait, let me recast that.

Wait, let me try again. Since my initial assumption of f=0.02 led to Re=211, which is in the laminar regime, so f would actually be 64/Re.

So let's recalculate with f = 64/Re.

But since Re depends on v, which is what we're trying to find, this becomes a bit of an iterative process.

Let me approach this step by step.

Let me denote:

Re = (v D) / ν

And for laminar flow, f = 64 / Re.

So substituting f into the equation:

v^3 ≈ 31851.33 / (π * f * 250)

But f = 64/(Re) = 64 * ν/(v D)

So substituting:

v^3 ≈ 31851.33 / (π * (64 ν / (v D)) * 250 )

Simplify denominator:

π * (64 ν / (v D)) * 250 = π * 64 * ν * 250 / (v D)

So the equation becomes:

v^3 ≈ 31851.33 * v D / (π * 64 * ν * 250 )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

v^3 * π * 64 * ν * 250 ≈ 31851.33 * v D

Divide both sides by v:

v^2 * π * 64 * ν * 250 ≈ 31851.33 * D

Now, solve for v²:

v² ≈ (31851.33 * D) / (π * 64 * ν * 250 )

Plugging in the numbers:

D = 0.3333 ft, ν=0.02 ft²/s

So numerator: 31851.33 * 0.3333 ≈ 10617.11

Denominator: π * 64 * 0.02 * 250 ≈ 3.1416 * 64 * 0.02 * 250

Compute denominator step by step:

64 * 0.02 = 1.28

1.28 * 250 = 320

3.1416 * 320 ≈ 1005.31

So v² ≈ 10617.11 / 1005.31 ≈ 10.56

Thus, v ≈ sqrt(10.56) ≈ 3.25 ft/s

Wait, that's more reasonable. Let me check Re now.

Re = (v D) / ν = (3.25 * 0.3333) / 0.02 ≈ (1.082) / 0.02 ≈ 54.1

Hmm, that's still in the laminar flow regime (Re < 2000). So f = 64/Re ≈ 64/54.1 ≈ 1.183

Wait, but that's a very high friction factor, which would cause a lot of head loss. Let me plug this back into the equation to find v.

Wait, let me try this again with the new f value.

We have f ≈ 1.183.

So going back to the equation:

v^3 ≈ 31851.33 / (π * f * 250)

Plugging in f=1.183:

Denominator: π * 1.183 * 250 ≈ 3.1416 * 1
