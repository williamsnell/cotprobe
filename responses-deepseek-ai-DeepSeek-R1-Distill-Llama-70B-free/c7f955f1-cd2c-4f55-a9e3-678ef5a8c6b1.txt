Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about acetic acid and its ionization. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The problem has two parts, a and b. The ionization constant for acetic acid is given as 1.8 × 10^-5. Part a asks for the H+ concentration in a 0.10 M solution of acetic acid. Part b is similar but with an added twist—acetate ions are added to make their concentration 1.0 M by adding sodium acetate. So, it's about the common ion effect, I think.

Starting with part a. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely ionize. The formula for acetic acid ionization is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-. The ionization constant, Ka, is given, and for a weak acid, we can use the approximation that the concentration of H+ is approximately sqrt(Ka * C), where C is the initial concentration, assuming that the ionization is small.

So for part a, the initial concentration is 0.10 M. Let me plug in the numbers. Ka is 1.8e-5, so 1.8e-5 * 0.10 = 1.8e-6. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(1.8e-6) ≈ 1.34e-3 M. Wait, but wait, I remember that the approximation might not hold if the concentration is too low. Oh, but 0.1 M is maybe on the edge of where the approximation is valid. Let me check.

The exact method would be setting up the equation. Let me denote the change as x, so the concentrations at equilibrium are [CH3COOH] = 0.10 - x, [H+] = x, [CH3COO^-] = x. Then the Ka expression is (x^2)/(0.10 - x) = 1.8e-5.

If x is much smaller than 0.10, then 0.10 - x ≈ 0.10, so x^2 ≈ 1.8e-5 * 0.10 = 1.8e-6, so x ≈ sqrt(1.8e-6) ≈ 1.34e-3. But wait, 1.34e-3 is about 0.00134, which is 1.34% of 0.10, so maybe the approximation is okay. But maybe I should be more precise.

Let me compute without approximation. So x² = 1.8e-5 * (0.10 - x). Let's write it as x² + 1.8e-5 x - 1.8e-6 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a =1, b=1.8e-5, c= -1.8e-6.

So discriminant D = (1.8e-5)^2 + 4 * 1 * 1.8e-6 = 3.24e-10 + 7.2e-6 = approximately 7.2e-6 (since 3.24e-10 is negligible). So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(7.2e-6) ≈ 2.68e-3. Then x = [-1.8e-5 ± 2.68e-3]/2. Take the positive root, so (2.68e-3 - 1.8e-5)/2 ≈ (2.66e-3)/2 ≈ 1.33e-3. So that's about the same as the approximation. So part a's answer is approximately 1.3e-3 M. Looking at the options, let's see which option's part a is around 1.3e-3.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H: 1.3e-3 for part a, but part b is 1.8e-6.

Option G: 1.0e-3, which is lower.

Option D: 1.2e-3.

Option J: 0.9e-3.

Hmm, the exact value I calculated is about 1.33e-3, which isn't exactly matching any option. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the square root. Let me compute sqrt(1.8e-6). 1.8e-6 is 1.8 × 10^-6. The square root of 1.8 is approx 1.34, and sqrt(1e-6) is 1e-3. So yes, 1.34e-3. So the closest option would be H (1.3e-3) or perhaps D (1.2e-3). Hmm, maybe the exact calculation would give a value closer to 1.34e-3, so 1.3e-3 is option H. But looking at the options, perhaps the given options have rounded numbers.

But let's proceed to part b and see if that helps.

Part b: Now, there's 0.10 M acetic acid, but the concentration of acetate ions is increased to 1.0 M by adding sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates completely, so [CH3COO^-] = 1.0 M. So now, the solution is a buffer solution, I think, because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base.

The ionization equation is still CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-. But now, since we're adding a lot of acetate, the equilibrium will shift to the left, decreasing the ionization of acetic acid. So the H+ concentration will be lower than in part a.

The expression for Ka is still ( [H+][CH3COO^-] ) / [CH3COOH] = 1.8e-5.

We can rearrange this to find [H+] = (Ka * [CH3COOH]) / [CH3COO^-].

But [CH3COOH] is approximately 0.10 M, because adding sodium acetate (a strong electrolyte) doesn't change the concentration of the undissociated acetic acid much. Wait, but actually, the total concentration of acetate is 1.0 M, so when you add that, the solution's volume might change, but assuming the volumes are additive and that the concentration is given as 0.10 M acetic acid plus 1.0 M acetate, perhaps we can proceed.

So, the initial concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.10 M, [CH3COO^-] = 1.0 M, [H+] is what we're solving for.

At equilibrium, [CH3COOH] = 0.10 - x, [CH3COO^-] = 1.0 + x, [H+] = x. But since we're adding a strong electrolyte (sodium acetate), the x here will be very small compared to 1.0 M, so 1.0 + x ≈ 1.0.

So, let's approximate:

Ka = (x * 1.0) / (0.10 - x) ≈ 1.8e-5.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.10, 0.10 - x ≈ 0.10. So:

x ≈ (Ka * 0.10) / 1.0 = (1.8e-5 * 0.10) = 1.8e-6 M.

So [H+] is 1.8e-6 M. That would make the pH around 5.74, which seems right because it's a weak acid in a buffer with its conjugate base.

So for part a, the H+ is approximately 1.3e-3 M, and part b is 1.8e-6 M.

Looking at the options, the pair that matches is H: 1.3e-3 M and 1.8e-6 M. So option H.

But wait, looking back at the options, let's confirm:

Option H: 1.3 ×10^-3 M; 1.8 ×10^-6 M.

Yes, that matches. So I think the correct answer is H.

To solve the problem, we calculate the concentration of H⁺ ions in two scenarios involving a 0.10 M acetic acid solution, using the ionization constant \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \).

---

### Part (a): H⁺ concentration in 0.10 M acetic acid
Acetic acid is a weak acid, and its ionization can be represented as:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-
\]

Let the concentration of H⁺ ions at equilibrium be \( x \). Then:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = 0.10 - x, \quad [\text{H}^+] = x, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = x
\]

The ionization constant expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.10 - x}
\]

Assuming \( x \ll 0.10 \), we approximate \( 0.10 - x \approx 0.10 \), so:

\[
K_a \approx \frac{x^2}{0.10}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K_a \cdot 0.10 = (1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.10) = 1.8 \times 10^{-6}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.8 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.34 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the H⁺ concentration is approximately \( 1.3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \).

---

### Part (b): H⁺ concentration with 1.0 M acetate ions
When sodium acetate is added, the concentration of acetate ions (\( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] \)) is increased to 1.0 M. This creates a buffer solution, and the H⁺ concentration is suppressed due to the common ion effect. The ionization constant expression becomes:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}
\]

Rearranging for \( [\text{H}^+] \):

\[
[\text{H}^+] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.10)}{1.0} = 1.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the H⁺ concentration is \( 1.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \).

---

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- Part (a): \( [\text{H}^+] \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \)
- Part (b): \( [\text{H}^+] \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \)

The correct option is:

**H: 1.3 × 10⁻³ M; 1.8 × 10⁻⁶ M**
