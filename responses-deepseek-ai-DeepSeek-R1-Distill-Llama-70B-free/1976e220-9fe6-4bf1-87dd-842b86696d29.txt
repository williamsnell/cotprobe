Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Occasionally a boy is born withundescendedtestes (cryptorchidism), and he will be sterile unless they are surgically caused to descend into the scrotum. Explain the reason for this.

Options:

A: Human sperm cannot develop at the high temperature found within the body cavity.
B: The testes require the lower pressure environment of the scrotum for sperm maturation
C: Testes must be in the scrotum to properly attach to the vas deferens
D: The scrotum provides the necessary nutrients for sperm development
E: Gravity is required for the testes to function properly
F: Undescended testes result in hormonal imbalances that prevent sperm production
G: The testes need to be in the scrotum for aesthetic reasons
H: Undescended testes can lead to cancer
I: The scrotum is the only place where the testes can receive oxygen
J: Testes descend into the scrotum to make room for other organs

Okay, so I've got this question about undescended testes and why it causes sterility if not treated. Hmm, I remember that the scrotum is involved in temperature regulation for the testes. Wait, why is that important?

I think it's because sperm development is temperature-sensitive. The body's internal temperature is higher than the scrotum, which is slightly cooler. If the testes are inside the body cavity, they might be too warm. Oh right, human sperm can't develop properly at higher temperatures. So if the testes don't descend, the temperature isn't right, leading to infertility.

Looking at the options, option A says that human sperm can't develop at the high body temperature. That makes sense because the scrotum keeps them cooler. So A must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check the other options. Option B talks about pressure, but I don't think that's the main issue. The scrotum's role isn't primarily about pressure changes. Option C says something about attaching to the vas deferens, but the vas deferens should still connect even if the testes are in the scrotum. So that's probably not it.

Options D mentions nutrients, but the bloodstream provides those, not the scrotum's location. E is about gravity, which doesn't seem relevant here. F talks about hormonal imbalances, but I think the main issue is temperature, not hormones. G is about aesthetics, which isn't a medical reason. H says undescended testes can lead to cancer, which is true, but the question is about sterility. I is about oxygen, but again, oxygen is delivered via blood, so the scrotum's location shouldn't affect that. J is about making room, which I don't think is the reason.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the correct answer is A. The higher body temperature prevents proper sperm development.

The correct answer is based on the role of the scrotum in maintaining a lower temperature than the body cavity, which is essential for proper sperm development. If the testes do not descend, they are exposed to higher internal body temperatures, which impair sperm maturation and lead to sterility.

Answer: A
