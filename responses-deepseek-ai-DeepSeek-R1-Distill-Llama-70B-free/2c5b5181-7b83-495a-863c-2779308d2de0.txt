Question:

A man was standing on a street corner when a police officer approached him. The officer gently grabbed the man's arm and said, "Hey, I want to talk to you. " The man responded, "About what . . . I'm in a hurry to go home and watch the baseball game. " The officer then remarked, "Listen, what were you doing at the liquor store last week?" The man stated, "All right, man, I was there during the robbery. " Whereupon, the officer placed the man under arrest and charged him with robbery. The man was taken to police headquarters where he was booked. For the first time, he was given his Miranda warnings. He then waived his rights and confessed to being an accessory during the liquor store robbery. Afterward, the court appointed an attorney to represent the man. The attorney moved to suppress both statements the man gave to the police. The trial court granted the motion with respect to the first statement as a violation of Miranda. The man's attorney now moves to suppress the secondstatement given at the police headquarters. This motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the man didn't have an attorney present during the second statement.
B: not granted, because the first statement doesn't affect the legality of the second.
C: not granted, because the second statement was volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver.
D: not granted, because the man had already confessed to the crime.
E: not granted, because the man willingly gave the second statement.
F: granted, because the first statement was excluded, and the second statement is tainted.
G: granted, because the man was not informed of his rights before the second statement.
H: not granted, because the Miranda warning was correctly given before the second statement.
I: granted, because the man was under duress during the second statement.
J: granted, because the second statement was the fruit of the first statement.

Okay, so I need to figure out this Miranda rights question. Let's see... The situation is a man being approached by a police officer, and there are two statements he made. The first was when the officer grabbed his arm and asked him some questions, and the second was after he was booked and given Miranda warnings, which he waived and then confessed.

The first statement was suppressed because the court said it violated Miranda. Now, the attorney is moving to suppress the second statement. The options are various reasons for or against granting the motion.

I remember that Miranda warnings are required when a person is in custody and being interrogated. The first statement was made when the officer approached him, but the question is whether that was a custodial situation. The officer grabbed his arm, which might be enough to make him feel he's not free to leave, so Miranda applies. Since the first statement was without Miranda, it was suppressed.

Now, the second statement was after he was booked and Miranda warnings were given. He waived them and confessed. The issue is whether the second statement is admissible.

I think about the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine. If the first statement was obtained unlawfully, any evidence derived from it might be tainted. But here, the first statement was made without Miranda, but the second was made after Miranda was properly given. However, some cases say that if a defendant makes an initial statement without Miranda, a later statement made after Miranda might still be suppressed if it's found to be a result of the first.

Wait, but in the case of Oregon v. Elstad, the Supreme Court held that the second voluntary statement after Miranda warnings is admissible, even if an earlier statement was made without Miranda. So the second statement isn't tainted just because the first was unlawful.

So in this situation, the first statement was suppressed, but the second was made after proper warnings and a waiver. Therefore, the second statement is admissible.

Looking at the options, option C says "not granted because the second statement was volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver." Option H says "not granted because Miranda was correctly given before the second statement." Both seem plausible.

Wait, but the first statement being excluded doesn't necessarily affect the second if the second was properly Miranda-ized. So the motion to suppress the second statement should not be granted because the warnings were given and he waived them.

So the correct answer would be either C or H. Option C emphasizes the waiver, H emphasizes the correct Miranda warning.

Wait, the options: Option C says "volunteered after knowing waiver" and H says "Miranda was correctly given."

The key is that the second statement was made after proper warnings, so the motion should not be granted. So the answer is either C or H.

I think H is more accurate because it's about the correct giving of Miranda warnings before the second statement.

Wait, but another thought: If the initial arrest was based on the first statement, which was suppressed, then maybe the second statement is tainted. But in this scenario, the man was placed under arrest right after the first statement. So was the arrest lawful? Because the first statement was without Miranda, but if he was under arrest, the second statement's admissibility depends on whether it was voluntary and if Miranda was given.

Wait, but if the first statement was obtained without Miranda, and that led to the arrest, but the arrest itself might be valid based on probable cause regardless of the statement. So even if the first statement is suppressed, the arrest could still be valid because the officer might have had other reasons.

Alternatively, if the arrest was unlawful because it was based on the first statement, then the second statement might be tainted as fruit of an unlawful arrest. But I'm not sure about that.

But in this case, the question is about the second statement's suppression. The trial court already suppressed the first statement, so the second is being challenged now.

So, under Elstad, the second statement is admissible if it was made voluntarily after Miranda warnings. So the motion to suppress the second statement should not be granted.

Looking back at the options, option C says it's not granted because the second was volunteered after a knowing waiver. Option H says not granted because Miranda was correctly given before the second.

I think the correct reasoning is that the second statement was given after proper Miranda warnings, so it's admissible. So the answer is H.

Wait, but option C also makes sense because it's about the waiver. Which is more accurate?

In Elstad, the court said that the second statement is admissible if it's voluntary. So the fact that the warnings were given and he waived makes it admissible, regardless of the first statement.

So both options C and H seem correct, but perhaps the better answer is C because it's about the knowing waiver. Alternatively, H is about the correct Miranda warning.

Wait, the question is whether the second statement is being suppressed. The first was because of Miranda, but the second was given after Miranda. So the motion shouldn't be granted because the second was properly handled.

So the answer should be either C or H.

Looking again at the options:

C: not granted, because the second statement was volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver.

H: not granted, because Miranda warning was correctly given before the second.

I think the correct answer is C, because it's about the waiver. But I'm a bit confused because both could be correct.

Wait, the question says that after being booked, he was given Miranda warnings for the first time. So he was in custody, Miranda was required. He waived and confessed.

So the second statement was after proper warnings and a waiver, so it's admissible. Therefore, the motion to suppress should not be granted.

So the answer is option C or H. Hmm.

Wait, in the options, option C says "volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver." So that's correct.

Option H says "Miranda was correctly given before the second."

So both are correct, but which one is the best answer.

I think the key is that the second statement was made after a valid Miranda warning and waiver. So the correct reason is that the second statement was voluntary and Miranda was given, making the motion not granted.

So the answer is C or H. Looking at the options, I think the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of two statements made by a man during police interactions, focusing on Miranda rights. The first statement was made without Miranda warnings and was suppressed. The second statement was made after Miranda warnings were given and waived. The issue is whether the second statement should also be suppressed.

Under the precedent set by *Oregon v. Elstad*, a second statement made after proper Miranda warnings and a voluntary waiver is admissible, even if an earlier statement was obtained without Miranda warnings. The "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine does not apply here because the second statement was made voluntarily after Miranda rights were properly administered.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** states that the motion should not be granted because the second statement was "volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver." This aligns with the principle that a voluntary waiver of Miranda rights after proper warnings renders the statement admissible.
- **Option H** states that the motion should not be granted because "Miranda warning was correctly given before the second statement." This is also accurate, as the proper administration of Miranda warnings is a critical factor in the admissibility of the second statement.

Both options C and H are plausible, but the more precise reasoning focuses on the voluntary nature of the waiver and the admissibility of the second statement under *Elstad*. Therefore, **Option C** is the better answer.

Answer: C
