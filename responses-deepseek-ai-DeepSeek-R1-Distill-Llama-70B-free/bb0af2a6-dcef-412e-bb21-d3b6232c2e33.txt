Alright, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about finance and present values, which I'm still trying to get the hang of. Let me take it step by step.

Okay, the question is asking me to determine the annual amount needed to retire all the debts in 15 years. There are four parts to this: (a) through (d). I need to calculate the present value of each of these and then sum them up, right? Because the idea is that if I know the present value of all these debts, I can figure out how much I need to pay each year to cover them all over 15 years.

Let me list out each part and figure out what I need to do for each.

Starting with part (a): 10 annual mortgage payments of $1,000. Hmm, wait, so these are annual payments. But the interest rate is 12% effective annual rate. So I think I need to find the present value of an annuity here. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is P = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]. 

But wait, these payments are for 10 years, and the problem says the total time is 15 years. Does that mean these payments start right away? Or do they start in year 1? I think since it's an annual mortgage payment, the first payment is at the end of the first year. So it's an ordinary annuity.

Wait, but the total period we're looking at is 15 years. So the 10 payments are within those 15. So the present value of these 10 payments as of today. Then, after calculating that, I can find the equivalent annual payment for 15 years that would cover this present value.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up. The problem wants the annual payment needed to retire the entire debt in 15 years. So perhaps I should calculate the present value of each debt as of today, sum them all, and then find the annual payment required to pay off that total present value over 15 years at 12% interest.

Yes, that makes more sense. So each of the four debts needs to be converted into their present value today, then summed. Then, using that total present value, calculate the annual payment that would amortize it over 15 years.

So let's tackle each debt one by one.

(a) 10 annual mortgage payments of $1,000 each. The interest rate is 12% effective annual.

So for part (a), the present value (PV) is the present value of an ordinary annuity. The formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where PMT is $1,000, r is 0.12, n is 10.

Plugging the numbers in:

PV_a = 1000 * [ (1 - (1.12)^-10 ) / 0.12 ]

I need to calculate (1.12)^-10 first. Let me compute that. 1.12^10 is approximately 6.7275, so 1/6.7275 is about 0.14864. So 1 - 0.14864 is 0.85136. Divide by 0.12 gives 7.0947. Multiply by 1000, so PV_a is approximately $7,094.70.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Alternatively, I could use the present value factor for annuity. The factor for 12% over 10 years is [ (1 - 1.12^-10 ) / 0.12 ].

Using a calculator, 1.12^-10 is about 0.3220 (Wait, no, wait: 1.12^10 is about 6.7275, so 1/(1.12^10) is 1/6.7275 ≈ 0.14864, right. So 1 - 0.14864 is 0.85136. 0.85136 / 0.12 is approximately 7.09467. So yes, $7,094.67.

So (a) is about $7,094.67.

Moving on to part (b): 12 monthly payments of $100 on an automobile. The nominal annual rate is 12%, so I think I need to convert this to an effective monthly rate to calculate the present value.

Since it's a nominal rate, the monthly rate would be 12% / 12 = 1% per month. The payments are monthly, so it's a monthly annuity.

The present value of a monthly annuity (ordinary) is calculated as PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ], where r is the monthly rate and n is the number of months.

Here, PMT is $100, r is 0.01, and n is 12.

So PV_b = 100 * [ (1 - (1.01)^-12 ) / 0.01 ]

Compute (1.01)^-12 first. 1.01^12 is about 1.126825, so 1/1.126825 is approximately 0.887449. So 1 - 0.887449 is 0.112551. Divided by 0.01 gives 11.2551. Multiply by 100 gives $1,125.51.

So PV_b is approximately $1,125.51.

Wait, but the interest rate is given as the nominal rate on the automobile loan. So yes, 12% nominal, so 1% monthly. So that's correct.

Part (c): A bill for $2,000 due in two years. Since it's due in two years, and the effective annual rate is 12%, the present value is simply the amount divided by (1 + r)^n.

So PV_c = 2000 / (1.12)^2.

Calculate (1.12)^2: 1.2544. So 2000 / 1.2544 ≈ 2000 / 1.2544 ≈ $1,594.39.

So PV_c is approximately $1,594.39.

Part (d): A bill for $1,000 due today. That's simple; the present value is just $1,000 because it's due immediately. So PV_d = $1,000.

Now, summing all the present values:

PV_total = PV_a + PV_b + PV_c + PV_d

= 7,094.67 + 1,125.51 + 1,594.39 + 1,000.

Let me add them up:

7,094.67 + 1,125.51 = 8,220.18

8,220.18 + 1,594.39 = 9,814.57

9,814.57 + 1,000 = 10,814.57.

So total present value is approximately $10,814.57.

Wait, let me check the additions again.

7,094.67 + 1,125.51: 7k + 1.1k is 8.1k, 94.67 +125.51=220.18. So yes, 8,220.18.

8,220.18 + 1,594.39: 8,220 +1,594 is 9,814. 0.18 + 0.39 is 0.57. So 9,814.57.

9,814.57 +1,000 is 10,814.57. Correct.

Now, the next step is to find the annual payment needed to pay off this total present value over 15 years at 12% effective annual rate.

So we need to calculate an ordinary annuity where the present value is $10,814.57, the annual payment is PMT, the rate is 12% per period, and n is 15.

The formula is PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We need to solve for PMT.

Rearranging, PMT = PV / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So PMT = 10,814.57 / [ (1 - 1.12^-15 ) / 0.12 ]

First, compute (1.12)^-15. Let's calculate that.

1.12^15: Let me think. 1.12^10 is about 6.7275, as before. Then 1.12^5 is approximately 1.7623. So 1.12^15 = 6.7275 * 1.7623 ≈ around 11.874.

So 1/(1.12^15) ≈ 1/11.874 ≈ 0.0842.

So 1 - 0.0842 = 0.9158.

Divide by 0.12: 0.9158 / 0.12 ≈ 7.6317.

So PMT = 10,814.57 / 7.6317 ≈ Let me compute that.

10,814.57 divided by 7.6317.

Let me approximate:

7.6317 * 1,400 = 7.6317 * 1,400.

Wait, 7 * 1,400 is 9,800. 0.6317 *1,400 is about 884.38. So total 10,684.38.

Hmm, that's close to 10,814.57. So 1,400 gives us approximately 10,684.38. The difference is 10,814.57 - 10,684.38 = 130.19.

So how much more?

Each additional dollar in PMT adds 7.6317 to the total. So 130.19 /7.6317 ≈ 17.06.

So PMT would be approximately 1,400 + 17.06 ≈ 1,417.06.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

PMT = 10,814.57 / 7.6317.

Let me compute 10,814.57 /7.6317.

Well, 7.6317 * 1,417 = ?

Calculate 7.6317 * 1,417.

Let me break it down:

7 * 1,417 = 9,919.

0.6317 * 1,417 ≈ 0.6*1417= 850.2; 0.0317 *1417≈45.0.

So 850.2 +45= 895.2.

Total is 9,919 +895.2 = 10,814.2, which is very close to our PV of 10,814.57. So PMT is approximately $1,417. So about $1,417 per year.

Wait, but looking at the options provided, the closest is option J: $1,520.34, or perhaps option C: $1,580.42. Hmm, but wait perhaps my approximations are off.

Wait, maybe I should calculate (1.12)^-15 more accurately. Let's compute 1.12^15 precisely.

Alternatively, using the formula for present value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the present value annuity factor formula accurately.

The present value annuity factor (PVIFA) for r=12%, n=15 is [1 - (1.12)^-15 ] / 0.12. Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 1.12^-15:

We can compute this using logarithms or a calculator, but I'll try to compute it step by step.

We know that 1.12^10 ≈6.7275. Let's compute 1.12^15 as 1.12^10 * 1.12^5.

1.12^5: 1.12 *1.12=1.2544; *1.12=1.4049; *1.12=1.5735; *1.12=1.7623. So 1.12^5≈1.7623.

So 1.12^15=6.7275 *1.7623 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 1.7623 is 10.5738.

0.7275 *1.7623:

Compute 0.7 *1.7623=1.2336.

0.0275 *1.7623≈0.04845.

So total 1.2336 + 0.04845=1.28205.

Adding to 10.5738 gives 11.85585.

So 1.12^15≈11.85585.

So 1/(1.12^15)=1/11.85585≈0.08435.

So 1 - 0.08435=0.91565.

Divide by 0.12: 0.91565 /0.12≈7.6304.

So the PVIFA is approximately 7.6304.

Thus, PMT=10,814.57 /7.6304 ≈ let's compute this.

10,814.57 /7.6304.

Let me compute 7.6304 * 1,417 = ?

7 *1,417=9,919.

0.6304 *1,417≈ 0.6*1,417=850.2, 0.0304*1,417≈43.00.

So 850.2 +43=893.2.

Total 9,919 +893.2=10,812.2.

Which is very close to 10,814.57. So the PMT is approximately 1,417 plus a little more.

The difference is 10,814.57 -10,812.2=2.37.

Since each PMT unit contributes 7.6304, 2.37/7.6304≈0.31.

So PMT≈1,417.31.

Hmm, so about $1,417.31 per year.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: $1,520.34, but that's higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the present value calculations.

Wait, let me double-check each present value calculation. Maybe I messed up one of them.

Starting again:

(a) 10 annual payments of $1,000 at 12% effective.

PVIFA = [1 - 1.12^-10]/0.12.

1.12^10≈6.7275, so 1/6.7275≈0.14864. 1-0.14864=0.85136. 0.85136/0.12≈7.0947.

So PV_a=1,000 *7.0947≈7,094.67. Correct.

(b) 12 monthly payments of $100. Nominal rate 12%, so monthly rate 1%.

PVIFA for monthly: [1 - (1.01)^-12 ] / 0.01.

(1.01)^12≈1.126825. 1/1.126825≈0.887449. 1-0.887449=0.112551. 0.112551/0.01≈11.2551.

Thus, PV_b=100 *11.2551≈1,125.51. Correct.

(c) $2,000 due in two years at 12% effective.

PV=2000/(1.12)^2=2000/1.2544≈1,594.39. Correct.

(d) $1,000 due today. PV=1,000. Correct.

Total: 7,094.67 +1,125.51=8,220.18; +1,594.39=9,814.57; +1,000=10,814.57. Correct.

So sum is correct. Then, finding annual payment over 15 years.

So the PMT I calculated is about $1,417.31.

Looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are:

A: 1,225.00

B:1,500.00

C:1,580.42

D:1,250.00

E:1,450.00

F:1,375.69

G:1,600.00

H:1,700.00

I:1,305.75

J:1,520.34

Hmm, none of these are near 1,417. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong interest rate for one of the debts. Let me re-read the question.

The interest rate is 12 percent nominal on the automobile loan, and 12% effective on all other debts. So:

- For (a), (c), (d): 12% effective annual rate.

- For (b): 12% nominal annual, so monthly rate is 1% as I did.

So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the annual payment should be calculated using a different rate? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the annual payment that would pay off each debt separately, and then sum the annual payments. But no, the question says to determine the annual amount necessary to retire the entire debt in 15 years. So it's about finding a single annual payment that covers all debts, which have been converted to their present values summed together.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have treated the automobile loan as an effective annual rate instead of converting to monthly. But no, the question says the automobile loan has a nominal rate. So part (b) was correctly calculated with a monthly rate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total present value. Let me recalculate each PV.

PV_a: 7,094.67

PV_b:1,125.51

PV_c:1,594.39

PV_d:1,000

Total: 7,094.67 +1,125.51 = 8,220.18

8,220.18 +1,594.39 = 9,814.57

9,814.57 +1,000 =10,814.57. Correct.

Hmm. So the total PV is correct.

Wait, perhaps the 10 mortgage payments are made annually, starting in one year, so n=10, but the total period is 15 years. So when calculating the present value of the mortgage, I used 10 years. But when finding the annual payment to cover all debts over 15 years, I used 15 years. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the same interest rate for all debts, but no, the question says that the automobile loan uses the nominal rate, and the others use the effective rate.

Wait, now that I think about it, when I calculated the present value of the automobile loan (part b), I used the monthly rate, but when calculating the annual payment for the total, I used the annual effective rate. That's correct
