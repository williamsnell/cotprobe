Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the free energy change, ∆G, for a process involving water moving from a solution to a pure state. Hmm, I remember that free energy change is related to osmosis and osmotic pressure somehow.

The problem states that the process is H2O in a NaCl solution at 25°C going to pure H2O. The solution has a concentration of m (I guess that's molality) and an osmotic pressure of 2.0 atm at the same temperature. We need to find ∆G_298, so that's at 25°C, which is 298 K.

Wait, I remember that the formula for calculating the free energy change when a solute is involved is related to the osmotic pressure. Oh right! The equation is ∆G = -iMRT, where i is the van 't Hoff factor, M is the molarity, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. But wait, I'm not sure if it's molarity or molality here because the problem gives concentration as m, which is often molality. Hmm, that could be confusing.

Wait, no, osmotic pressure uses molarity in the formula π = iCRT. So maybe the M here is molarity, not molality. But in the problem, the solution's concentration is given as m, which might stand for molality. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The osmotic pressure π is given by π = iCRT, where C is the concentration in molarity (moles per liter). So if the solution is NaCl, which dissociates into two ions, Na+ and Cl-, so the van 't Hoff factor i would be 2. Because each NaCl unit gives two particles in solution.

So first, I think we can find the molarity from the osmotic pressure. π equals iCRT, so we can rearrange that to find C. Wait, but the problem gives the concentration as m (maybe molality). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using m as the molality, but I need to see how that connects.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline the steps.

The process is H2O (solution) → H2O (pure). So water is moving from a solution to pure water. That's osmosis. The free energy change for this process would be related to the work done against the osmotic pressure.

I remember that the formula for the maximum work done by the system is ∆G = -nRT ln(Q), but in this case, since it's at standard conditions, maybe that's not directly applicable.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the free energy change for transferring water from the solution to pure water. The free energy change for this process can be calculated using the osmotic pressure.

Wait, another approach: The work done during osmosis is equal to the osmotic pressure times the change in volume. But since we're dealing with free energy, which is a thermodynamic potential, perhaps I can use the relation ∆G = VΔP, where V is the volume and ΔP is the pressure change. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no, that's probably for expansion work. In this case, maybe it's better to consider the chemical potential. The chemical potential of water in the solution is lower than that of pure water because of the dissolved solute. So when water moves from the solution to pure water, the system is moving to a higher chemical potential, which is non-spontaneous, so the free energy change should be positive.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it this way: The process is water moving from a solution (where it's at a lower chemical potential due to the solute) to pure water. So the free energy change for this process would be positive, meaning the process is non-spontaneous, which makes sense because water would flow from pure into the solution, not the other way around, under normal osmosis.

But how do I calculate the actual value of ∆G?

I think the formula is ∆G = nRT ln(activity), but since we're dealing with an osmotic process, maybe it's better to use the osmotic pressure relation.

Wait, I remember that the free energy change for the process can be calculated using the equation ∆G = -Vπ, where V is the volume of water transferred and π is the osmotic pressure. But wait, that doesn't seem right because V is usually in terms of moles.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The work done during osmosis is equal to the osmotic pressure times the volume change. So for a small volume dV, the work dW = -π dV (since the system is doing work against the osmotic pressure). The maximum work done at constant temperature is equal to the free energy change.

Wait, but when water moves from the solution to pure water, the volume of the solution decreases, so the work done by the system is negative, meaning the free energy change is positive. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the change in the number of moles of water.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Gibbs free energy equation for a solution. The chemical potential of water in the solution is μ = μ0 + RT ln X, where X is the mole fraction of water. But when water moves to pure water, its chemical potential increases.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to directly compute ∆G from that. Maybe another approach would be better.

Wait, I think I remember that the free energy change for the process where water is transferred from a solution to pure water is given by ∆G = iMRT, where i is the van 't Hoff factor, M is the molarity of the solution, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The osmotic pressure π is equal to iCRT, so if we have π = 2.0 atm, and i = 2 (for NaCl), then we can find the concentration C in terms of molarity.

So rearranging π = iCRT, we get C = π / (iRT).

Given π = 2.0 atm, i = 2, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T = 298 K.

So C = (2.0 atm) / (2 * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298 K).

Let me compute that:

Denominator: 2 * 0.0821 * 298 = 2 * (0.0821 * 300 is about 24.63, but since it's 298, let me calculate more precisely.

0.0821 * 298 = ?

Well, 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63, but subtract 0.0821 * 2 = 0.1642, so 24.63 - 0.1642 = 24.4658.

Then multiply by 2: 24.4658 * 2 = 48.9316.

So C = 2.0 / 48.9316 ≈ 0.04083 mol/L.

So the concentration is approximately 0.04083 M.

Now, the free energy change for the process. Wait, but what's the process exactly? It's water moving from the solution to pure water. So for each mole of water moved, the free energy change would be RT ln(activity), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the free energy change is calculated using the osmotic pressure. I think the formula is ∆G = -nRT ln(Q), but in this case, maybe it's better to think about the process as moving n moles of water from the solution to pure water.

Wait, considering that, the free energy change would be equal to the work done against the osmotic pressure. So if we consider the transfer of n moles of water, the volume change would be n * V_m, where V_m is the molar volume of water. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ∆G = -Vπ, where V is the volume of water, but that seems a bit unclear. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: The work done during osmosis is W = -πΔV, where ΔV is the change in volume. But the maximum work is equal to the free energy change, so ΔG = W = -πΔV.

But wait, the process here is moving water from solution to pure, which would increase the volume of the pure side and decrease the solution side. But I'm not sure how that directly translates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the free energy change per mole of water. So the chemical potential of water in the solution is μ_solution = μ0 + RT ln X, where X is the mole fraction of water. In pure water, μ_pure = μ0.

So the free energy change per mole when moving from solution to pure would be μ_pure - μ_solution = -RT ln X.

But to find ln X, we can consider that in a dilute solution, X ≈ 1 - (n_solute / n_water), but perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between osmotic pressure and concentration.

Wait, another approach: The change in free energy when water moves from solution to pure water can be calculated using the equation ΔG = nRT ln(P1/P2), but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, no, that's for gas expansions. Maybe not the right approach.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back to the formula I thought of earlier: ΔG = iMRT.

Wait, but when I calculated C earlier, I found it to be approximately 0.04083 M. Now, if I use that in the formula ΔG = iMRT, then:

i = 2 (for NaCl), M = 0.04083 mol/L, R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T = 298 K.

So ΔG = 2 * 0.04083 * 0.0821 * 298.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 2 * 0.04083 = 0.08166.

Then, 0.08166 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.006709.

Then, 0.006709 * 298 ≈ 2.002 atm·L.

Wait, but wait, what are the units here? Because R is in L·atm/(mol·K), so when I multiply i * M (mol/L) * R (L·atm/mol·K) * T (K), the units would be (unitless) * (mol/L) * (L·atm/mol·K) * K → atm.

So the result would be in atm, but we have ΔG in what units? Because ΔG is in energy, typically in J or cal, but here the options are in cc·atm, which is a volume times pressure, so energy.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the formula I'm using isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of moles of water.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. The free energy change for the process is given by:

ΔG = V_π ΔP,

where V_π is the volume and ΔP is the pressure difference. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The osmotic pressure is the pressure required to prevent osmosis. So the work done by the system when water moves from solution to pure would be against this pressure. So, if the osmotic pressure is π, moving a volume V of water would involve work W = -πV.

But since ΔG is the maximum work, perhaps ΔG = W = -πV. But then, we'd need to know the volume of water moved, which isn't given in the problem.

Wait, but the problem might be considering the free energy change per mole of water transferred. So, per mole, the volume would be the molar volume of water, which is about 18 mL/mol (0.018 L/mol).

So let's compute that. For one mole of water, volume V = 0.018 L.

So ΔG = -πV = -2.0 atm * 0.018 L = -0.036 L·atm.

But wait, the problem asks for the free energy change for the process H2O(solution) → H2O(pure). So moving one mole of water.

But the options are in cc·atm, so 0.036 L·atm is 36 cc·atm, and since it's negative, the process is spontaneous in reverse. But wait, the process as written is moving from solution to pure, which is non-spontaneous, so ΔG should be positive.

Wait, so maybe I should take the absolute value. So 0.036 L·atm is 36 cc·atm, so positive 36.

Looking at the options, option A is 36 cc·atm. But wait, earlier when I calculated using ΔG = iMRT, I got approximately 2.002 atm·L, which would be 200.2 cc·atm, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong there.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me think again. The correct formula for the free energy change when a solute is present is ΔG = iMRT ln(Q), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is ΔG = -nRT ln(Q), where Q is the reaction quotient, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should relate this to the osmotic pressure. Since π = iCRT, and we can write ΔG as the work done against the osmotic pressure. So for one mole of solvent (water), the volume change is V, and the work done is P_ext × ΔV, but since it's moving against the osmotic pressure, P_ext is π.

So for one mole of water, V = 0.018 L. So ΔG = π × V = 2.0 atm × 0.018 L = 0.036 L·atm.

Since 1 L·atm is 1000 cc·atm, 0.036 L·atm is 36 cc·atm. But since moving from solution to pure is going against the natural direction, the process is non-spontaneous, so ΔG is positive. Therefore, ΔG = +36 cc·atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 36 cc·atm. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought of using the formula ΔG = iMRT, which gave me a different result, but maybe that formula applies to a different scenario, like the free energy of the solution relative to pure solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion comes from whether we're calculating per mole of solute or per mole of solvent. Because in this problem, we're moving water, so per mole of water.

Wait, let me think again. For each mole of water, the free energy change is π × V_m, where V_m is the molar volume. So 2.0 atm * 0.018 L/mol = 0.036 L·atm/mol, which is 36 cc·atm/mol. So that's 36 cc·atm per mole of water.

So that's the free energy change for transferring one mole of water from the solution to pure water, and it's positive, so the process is non-spontaneous, which makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option A: 36 cc·atm.
</think>

To calculate the free energy change, ΔG, for the process H₂O(solution, 25°C) → H₂O(pure, 25°C), we use the relationship between osmotic pressure and free energy. The osmotic pressure is given as π = 2.0 atm at 25°C, and the molar volume of water is approximately V_m = 0.018 L/mol.

The free energy change for transferring one mole of water from the solution to pure water is given by:

\[
\Delta G = -\pi V_m
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta G = -(2.0 \, \text{atm})(0.018 \, \text{L/mol}) = -0.036 \, \text{L·atm/mol}
\]

Converting to cc·atm (since 1 L = 1000 cc):
\[
\Delta G = -36 \, \text{cc·atm/mol}
\]

However, since the process involves moving water from the solution to pure water, which is non-spontaneous, the free energy change is positive. Thus, we take the absolute value:

\[
\Delta G = +36 \, \text{cc·atm/mol}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 36 cc·atm**
