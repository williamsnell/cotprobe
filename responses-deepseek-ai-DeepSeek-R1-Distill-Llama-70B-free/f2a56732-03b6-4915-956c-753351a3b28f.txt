Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that there are 8,000 hours in a year, and an individual has a potential market wage of $5 per hour. Then a rich uncle dies and leaves them an annual income of $4,000. The question is, if the person devotes 75% of their full income to leisure, how many hours will they work?

Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to understand what full income means. From what I remember, full income isn't just the wage you earn from working; it's the total of your earnings plus any unearned income, like from investments or, in this case, an inheritance. So, full income would be the money you make from your job plus the money you get from other sources.

So the individual's wage is $5 per hour. If they work a certain number of hours, let's call that 'h', then their earnings from work would be 5h. Plus, they have this $4,000 from their uncle. So their full income would be 5h + 4000.

Wait, no, wait. No, actually, wait a second. Full income is the maximum amount you can earn if you work all the time. So, perhaps full income is calculated as the wage multiplied by the total hours available. So if someone can work up to 8,000 hours at $5 per hour, their full income would be 5 * 8000 = $40,000. But wait, that doesn't seem right here because the inheritance is $4,000. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up concepts.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The individual's full income is their wage times the number of hours they could work if they didn't take any leisure. So, full income is what they can earn if they work all 8,000 hours. So their maximum possible earnings would be 5 * 8000 = $40,000 per year. But they also have an inheritance of $4,000, so their total full income would be 40,000 + 4,000 = $44,000?

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the inheritance is separate from their earnings. So maybe full income refers only to their earned income plus unearned income. Alternatively, perhaps the way it's being used here is that the individual's full income is their earned income (from working) plus any other income, which is the $4,000 here.

But the question is about how much they allocate to leisure, which is a time allocation. So the way I'm thinking is that the individual will decide how much to work based on their full income. The problem says they devote 75% of their full income to leisure. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Leisure is time, not money. So I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe it's the opposite. The individual's allocation is 75% of their time (their available hours) to leisure. So, full income is the maximum possible from working, but perhaps the problem is considering that they allocate 75% of their full income towards leisure activities, but that doesn't make sense because leisure is time. So perhaps it's their time allocation.

Wait, the question says "devotes 75 percent of full income to leisure". Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Wait, no, perhaps it's 75% of their full income that is spent on leisure. But that would relate to their expenditure on leisure goods. Alternatively, maybe it's that they spend 75% of their time on leisure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. It says, "devotes 75 percent of full income to leisure." Wait, that might not make sense because leisure is time, not money. So perhaps it's a typo, and they mean 75% of their time is leisure. Or maybe it's that 75% of their income is spent on leisure. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "full income" to refer to the total available time, so 8,000 hours. If 75% of that is leisure, then work hours would be 25% of 8,000. Let me calculate that. 25% is 0.25, so 0.25 * 8000 = 2000 hours. So the answer would be E:2000. But that seems too straightforward, and also the inheritance might play a role here.

Wait, no, the inheritance is $4,000 per year, and the wage is $5 per hour. So perhaps the individual's decision is based on their budget constraint. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think in terms of labor-leisure choice.

In economics, the labor-leisure model says that individuals choose between work (which gives income) and leisure (which they value). The more you work, the more income you have to spend on goods, but the less leisure time you have.

The income from work is wage * hours worked. So if someone works 'h' hours, they earn 5h dollars. Their total income is 5h + 4000 (the inheritance). So their total income is 5h + 4000.

Now, the question says they devote 75% of their full income to leisure. Wait, but full income is their total potential earnings if they worked all the time. So full income would be 5 * 8000 = 40,000. So 75% of that would be 0.75 * 40,000 = 30,000. But that can't be right because their actual income is 5h +4000. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the individual's full income includes the inheritance. So full income is 40,000 (from work) + 4,000 (inheritance) = 44,000. Then 75% of 44,000 is 33,000. But how does that relate to their work hours?

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to think about how much income the person is willing to have, given that they are choosing to allocate 75% of their full income to leisure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the term "full income" differently. Let me think again. Full income in economics is sometimes the sum of earnings plus the value of leisure time. But perhaps that's more advanced than what's needed here.

Wait, another approach: Suppose the individual can work up to 8,000 hours, earning $5 per hour, giving maximum earnings of $40,000. But they also have $4,000 from an inheritance. So their total possible income is $44,000. Now, if they decide to spend 75% of their time (not income) on leisure, then their work time would be 25% of 8,000, which is 2,000 hours. So they would earn 2,000 *5= $10,000 from work, plus the $4,000, making their total income $14,000. But the question is about how many hours they will work, which in this case would be 2,000. So the answer would be E:2000.

But wait, the question says "devotes 75 percent of full income to leisure." So perhaps it's not about time, but about money. So 75% of their income goes to leisure activities, which would mean that 25% is spent on other things, perhaps including work. But that doesn't make sense because work is time, not money spent.

Alternatively, maybe the person's full income is $44,000 (40k from work +4k inheritance). They decide to spend 75% of that on leisure, which would be 33,000. But how does that translate to hours worked?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different angle. The individual has a choice between work and leisure. The wage is $5 per hour. Their total available time is 8,000 hours. They receive an inheritance of $4,000.

In the labor-leisure model, the individual's constraint is that the hours they work (h) multiplied by the wage (5) plus their unearned income (4000) equals their total income, which they can spend on goods or leisure. But the question is about how much time they allocate between work and leisure.

Wait, but the question states that they devote 75% of full income to leisure. So, perhaps full income is the maximum possible, which would be if they worked all 8,000 hours, earning 40k, plus the 4k, so 44k. 75% of 44k is 33k, which they spend on leisure. So their expenditure on leisure is 33k.

But how does that relate to the hours worked? Because the value of leisure is the wage times the hours of leisure. So if the person's leisure time is L hours, then the value of their leisure is 5 * L. So 5L = 33,000. Solving for L, L = 33,000 /5 = 6,600 hours.

But total available time is 8,000 hours. So if they spend 6,600 hours on leisure, they work 8,000 -6,600 = 1,400 hours. So the answer would be G:1400.

Wait, that makes more sense. Let me go through it again.

Full income is the maximum they can earn: 8,000 *5 =40k +4k =44k.

They decide to spend 75% of this on leisure. So 0.75 *44k =33k.

The value of their leisure time is 33k, and since each hour of leisure is valued at the wage rate (5), then the number of hours they spend on leisure is 33k /5 =6,600 hours.

Total time available is 8,000, so work hours are 8,000 -6,600 =1,400 hours.

So the answer would be G:1400.
</think>

To determine how many hours the individual will work, we start by calculating their **full income**, which is the sum of their potential earnings from working all 8,000 hours at $5 per hour and the inheritance of $4,000. 

- **Maximum earnings from work**: \( 8,000 \, \text{hours} \times \$5/\text{hour} = \$40,000 \)
- **Inheritance**: \$4,000
- **Full income**: \( \$40,000 + \$4,000 = \$44,000 \)

The problem states that the individual devotes 75% of their full income to leisure. 

- **Income allocated to leisure**: \( 0.75 \times \$44,000 = \$33,000 \)

The value of leisure is calculated as the wage rate (\$5/hour) multiplied by the number of leisure hours (\( L \)). Setting this equal to \$33,000:

\[
5L = 33,000 \implies L = \frac{33,000}{5} = 6,600 \, \text{hours}
\]

The total time available in a year is 8,000 hours. Therefore, the number of hours worked is:

\[
\text{Hours worked} = 8,000 - 6,600 = 1,400 \, \text{hours}
\]

Thus, the individual will work **1,400 hours**.
