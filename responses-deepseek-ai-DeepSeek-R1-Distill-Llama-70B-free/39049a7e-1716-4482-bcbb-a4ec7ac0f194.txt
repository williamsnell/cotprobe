Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy required to separate atoms in a potassium iodide molecule. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question gives me the formula for potential energy using Coulomb's law, which is E_P = (k e²) / d. Oh wait, right, K is 9e9 N·m²/C². The distance d is 3.04e-10 meters. I think e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs.

Wait, potassium iodide is KI, so it's K+ and I- ions. Each has a charge of ±e, so when calculating the potential energy, it's the product of the two charges. So e squared.

So plugging in the numbers: E_P = (9e9) * (1.6e-19)^2 / (3.04e-10).

Let me compute that. First, calculate the numerator. 9e9 multiplied by (1.6e-19)^2. Let's do the exponent first: (1.6)^2 is 2.56, and (e-19)^2 is e-38. So 9e9 * 2.56e-38 = 9 * 2.56 * 1e9 * 1e-38.

Wait, 9 * 2.56 is approximately 23.04. Then 1e9 * 1e-38 is 1e-29. So 23.04e-29, which is 2.304e-28.

Now divide that by d, which is 3.04e-10 meters. So 2.304e-28 / 3.04e-10 = (2.304 / 3.04) * 1e-18.

Calculating 2.304 divided by 3.04. Let's see, 3.04 is about 3, so 2.3/3 is roughly 0.767. So 0.767e-18. But wait, that gives 7.67e-19 joules.

Wait, but the question asks for energy in electron volts. Oh right, I need to convert joules to eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules.

So E_P in eV is (7.67e-19 J) / (1.6e-19 J/eV) = 7.67 / 1.6 ≈ 4.79 eV.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is 4.8 eV. That's close. But let me double-check my calculations in case I messed up any steps.

Wait another thing: Coulomb's law potential energy is actually E = (k q1 q2) / r. Since both charges are e (but opposite signs, but squared so positive), so E is positive. And when you separate them, you have to do work against this potential. So the energy required is equal to the potential energy, which is positive.

Wait, in the formula, since we're calculating the potential energy when the ions are at distance d, to separate them to infinity, you need to provide energy equal to that potential energy. So I think I did it right.

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers more accurately.

Compute numerator: (9e9) * (1.6e-19)^2 = 9e9 * 2.56e-38 = 9 * 2.56 = 23.04, so 23.04e-29 (because 1e9 *1e-38 is 1e-29), yeah.

Denominator is 3.04e-10 m, so 23.04e-29 / 3.04e-10 = (23.04 / 3.04 ) * 1e-19.

23.04 /3.04: Let's compute that. 3.04 * 7 = 21.28. 23.04-21.28=1.76. So 7 + (1.76/3.04) = 7 + approx 0.579 = 7.579.

So 7.579e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 7.579e-19 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = 7.579 / 1.6 ≈ 4.74 eV. So approximately 4.74 eV.

Looking at the options, option H is 4.8 eV, which is the closest. But wait, let me check the other options. Option J is 5.7 eV, which is higher. Option D is 8.6. So 4.8 is the right one.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 23.04e-29 divided by 3.04e-10. Let me compute that again.

23.04 /3.04 is 7.579.

So (23.04e-29) / (3.04e-10) = (7.579) * (1e-29 / 1e-10) )= 7.579e-19 J.

Yes, same as before. Then 7.579e-19 /1.6e-19 = 4.74 eV.

So the closest option is H:4.8 eV.

To calculate the energy required to separate the ions in the potassium iodide molecule, we use the formula for Coulomb potential energy:

\[
E_P = \frac{k e^2}{d}
\]

Where:
- \( k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \),
- \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (elementary charge),
- \( d = 3.04 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \) (distance between the ions).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator
\[
k e^2 = (9 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2
\]
First, calculate \( e^2 \):
\[
e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]
Now multiply by \( k \):
\[
k e^2 = 9 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38} = 23.04 \times 10^{-29} = 2.304 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J·m}
\]

### Step 2: Divide by \( d \)
\[
E_P = \frac{2.304 \times 10^{-28}}{3.04 \times 10^{-10}}
\]
\[
E_P = \left( \frac{2.304}{3.04} \right) \times 10^{-18} \approx 0.7579 \times 10^{-18} = 7.579 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Convert to electron volts
To convert from joules to electron volts, use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):
\[
E_P = \frac{7.579 \times 10^{-19}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{7.579}{1.6} \approx 4.74 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated energy is approximately \( 4.74 \, \text{eV} \), which is closest to option **H: 4.8 eV**.
