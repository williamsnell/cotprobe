Okay, so I've got this question about options pricing, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a European call option on crude oil. The strike price is $50, and the maturity is one month. The call option is trading at $5. I need to find the price of the put premium with the same strike and expiration. The risk-free rate is 2% per month, and the spot price is $52.

Hmm, I remember something about put-call parity. Oh right, that's the formula that relates the price of a call and a put option. Let me try to recall the formula. I think it's something like C - P = S - K * e^(-rT), where C is the call price, P is the put price, S is the spot price, K is the strike, r is the risk-free rate, and T is the time to expiration in years.

Wait, let me make sure. Put-call parity for European options is: Call Price = Put Price + Stock Price - (Strike Price / (1 + r)^T). Or is it the other way around? Maybe it's C - P = S - PV(K). Yeah, where PV(K) is the present value of the strike price.

Right, so the formula is:

C - P = S - K * e^(-rT)

I think that's correct. So I can rearrange this to solve for P, the put price.

So rearranging, P = C - (S - K * e^(-rT)).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The formula is C - P = S - PV(K), so solving for P: P = C - [S - PV(K)].

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula is:

Call Price = Put Price + [Stock Price - (Strike Price / (1 + r)^T)]

So, if I rearrange that, Put Price = Call Price - [Stock Price - (Strike Price / (1 + r)^T)]

Alternatively, Put Price = Call Price + (Strike Price / (1 + r)^T) - Stock Price.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

C - P = S - PV(K)

So, P = C - (S - PV(K))

Which would be P = C - S + PV(K)

Hmm, I think that's correct. Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

C = $5

S = $52

K = $50

r = 2% per month. Since T is one month, that's 0.02.

T = 1 month, which is 1/12 of a year? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the time is in years. But wait, if the rate is 2% per month, then for T=1 month, r*T would be 0.02.

Wait, but in the formula, the discounting factor is e^(-rT). Wait, sometimes, the formula uses continuous compounding, but sometimes, it's done with simple rates. Wait, the put-call parity formula for European options when using discrete compounding is:

C - P = S - K * (1 + r)^(-T)

So, maybe I should use that form because the rate given is 2% per month, which is a discrete rate, not a continuous one.

Wait, let me double-check. Put-call parity is model-independent and applies regardless of the model (like Black-Scholes). The formula is for European options. So, for European options, the parity is:

Call Price = Put Price + [Spot Price - (Strike Price / (1 + r)^T)]

So, if I have C = $5, then:

$5 = P + ($52 - ($50 / (1 + 0.02)^1))

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute (1 + 0.02)^1 = 1.02.

Then, 50 / 1.02 = 50 / 1.02 ≈ 49.0196.

So, 52 - 49.0196 ≈ 2.9804.

So, 5 = P + 2.9804

Then, P = 5 - 2.9804 ≈ 2.0196.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option A: 2.92, but that's not exactly matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: Did I get the formula right? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula as:

C - P = S - PV(K)

So, PV(K) is K/(1 + r*T), but wait T is in years? Wait no, because if the rate is monthly, then T is 1 month, so T=1.

Wait, but in the formula, T is the time in years, but if the rate is given per month, then r*T would be 0.02 * 1 = 0.02. So yes, 50/(1.02) ≈49.0196.

So, S - PV(K) is 52 - 49.0196 ≈2.9804.

So, C - P = 2.9804.

So, 5 - P = 2.9804 → P = 5 - 2.9804 ≈ 2.0196, which is about $2.02.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.00, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a rounding error. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute 50 / 1.02:

50 divided by 1.02.

Well, 1.02 × 49 = 49.98. 49 × 1.02 = 49.98, so 50 is 49.98 + 0.02 → 49.01960784...

So, 52 - 49.01960784 = 2.98039216.

So, 5 - P = 2.98039216 → P = 5 - 2.98039216 = 2.01960784.

So, approximately $2.02, which isn't exactly one of the options. The closest is J: $2.00, but that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, wait. Another approach: Perhaps the question uses the Black-Scholes model? But I think put-call parity holds regardless, so the calculation should be straightforward.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should compute using continuous compounding, so r is 2% per month. So, the annual rate would be 0.02 * 12 = 24% per annum. But that's not correct because the rate given is per month, and the time is one month. So, perhaps the continuous rate would be different, but I think for put-call parity, it's better to use simple rates because the time is short (one month). Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses e^(-rT), so we can compute it as continuous.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let me compute K * e^(-rT), where r is 2% per month as a continuous rate.

Wait, but that's a point where I'm getting a bit confused. The risk-free rate is given as 2% per month. But in many cases, rates are given as annualized, so I need to make sure whether it's 2% per annum or 2% per month. The question says "one-month risk-free rate is 2%", which suggests that r is 0.02 for T=1/12 of a year.

Wait, but that's confusing. Let me clarify.

If the risk-free rate is 2% per month, then for T=1 month, the rate is 2% (so 0.02). But if the rate is annualized, say 24% per annum, then for one month, it's 2% (0.02). Hmm, no, that's not correct. Because 2% per month is 24% per annum, but that's not realistic. So perhaps the rate is 2% per annum, and T is 1/12.

Wait, but the question says the one-month risk-free rate is 2%, so that's 2% per month. So, for T=1 month, r*T=0.02.

So, maybe I should compute PV(K) as K * e^(-r*T), where r=0.02 and T=1.

Wait, but that's in months, so T is 1. So, e^(-0.02*1) ≈ 0.98019867.

So, PV(K) = 50 * 0.98019867 ≈ 49.009934.

Then, S - PV(K) = 52 - 49.009934 ≈ 2.990066.

So, C - P = 2.990066.

Given C=5, so 5 - P = 2.990066 → P≈5 -2.990066 ≈ 2.009934, which is about $2.01.

Still, the closest option is J: $2.00. But none of the options give exactly that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should use the formula in terms of future prices. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula as:

C + PV(K) = P + S

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct put-call parity is C - P = S - PV(K).

Wait, let me double-check. If I have a call and a put with the same strike and expiration, then the difference in their prices should equal the difference between the spot price and the present value of the strike.

So, C - P = S - PV(K).

So, in this case, 5 - P = 52 - (50 / (1.02)).

Wait, 50 / 1.02 is approximately 49.0196. So 52 - 49.0196 is about 2.9804.

So, 5 - P = 2.9804 → P = 5 - 2.9804 = 2.0196.

So P ≈ $2.02.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 2.92

B:3.20

C:4.80

D:1.50

E:4.50

F:5.00

G:1.00

H:3.50

I:3.75

J:2.00

So, the closest is J: 2.00, but it's not exactly matching. Maybe the question expects us to round to the nearest cent, but 2.02 isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 50 / 1.02 precisely.

50 divided by 1.02:

1.02 × 49 = 49.98, as before.

50 - 49.98 = 0.02. So 49 + (0.02/1.02) = 49 + 0.01960784 = 49.01960784.

So, 52 - 49.01960784 = 2.98039216.

So, 5 - P = 2.98039216 → P = 5 - 2.98039216 = 2.01960784, so approximately $2.0196.

Looking again, the options are:

J: 2.00.

But that's 2 dollars, and our calculation is about 2.02. Hmm. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the formula is P = C + PV(K) - S.

Wait, let me try that. So, P = 5 + (50 / 1.02) - 52.

So, 50 / 1.02 is 49.0196.

So, 5 + 49.0196 = 54.0196.

Then, 54.0196 -52 = 2.0196. So same result.

So, that's the same as before, leading to P ≈ 2.02.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the question is using the Black-Scholes formula instead of put-call parity. But that seems unlikely because put-call parity is a model-free relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the Black-Scholes model for both call and put, and then see.

Wait, but the question gives us the call price, so using Black-Scholes would require knowing volatility, which isn't provided. So that approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the call and put with the same strike and expiration, and using put-call parity to find the put price.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source in my mind.

Wait, another version of put-call parity is:

Put Price = Call Price + (Strike Price - Spot Price) / (1 + r)^T

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because if S is greater than K, then the call is in the money, and the put is out of the money.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

P = C + (PV(K) - S)

So, if PV(K) is less than S, then P would be less than C.

Wait, let me think about that.

In our case, PV(K) is approximately $49.02, S is $52.

So, PV(K) - S = 49.02 -52 = -2.98.

So P = C + (PV(K) - S) = 5 + (-2.98) = 2.02.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the put price is approximately $2.02, but the options don't have that. The closest is J: $2.00.

Wait, but perhaps I should check if I got the formula from the right perspective.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

C - P = S - PV(K)

So, rearranged, P = C - (S - PV(K)).

Which gives P = C - S + PV(K).

So, plugging the numbers:

P = 5 - 52 + (50 / 1.02)

5 -52 = -47

50/1.02 ≈49.0196

So, -47 + 49.0196 ≈ 2.0196.

Same result.

So, I think that's correct. But the options don't have $2.02.

Wait, looking back at the options: option J is $2.00, which is the closest. But perhaps the calculation uses a different rounding or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the risk-free rate is 2% per annum, not per month. Because if the rate is 2% per annum, and T is 1 month, which is 1/12 of a year, then r*T = (0.02)*(1/12) ≈ 0.0016667.

Then, PV(K) = 50 / (1 + 0.02/12)^1.

Wait, because if it's an annual rate, then the monthly rate would be 0.02/12.

So, 50 / (1 + 0.02/12) = 50 / (1.0016667) ≈ 49.8333.

Then, S - PV(K) = 52 - 49.8333 ≈ 2.1667.

So, C - P = 2.1667 → 5 - P = 2.1667 → P = 5 -2.1667 ≈ 2.8333, which is about $2.83. Looking at the options, option A is 2.92, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done with more precise decimal places.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

r is 2% per annum, so 0.02 per year.

T is 1 month, which is 1/12 year.

So, (1 + r*T) = 1 + 0.02*(1/12) = 1 + 0.0016667 = 1.0016667.

So, PV(K) = 50 / 1.0016667 ≈ 49.8333333.

Then, S - PV(K) = 52 - 49.8333333 ≈ 2.1666667.

So, C - P = 2.1666667 → 5 - P = 2.1666667 → P = 5 - 2.1666667 ≈ 2.8333333.

Hmm, that's approximately $2.83. But the options don't have that. The closest is option A: 2.92, but that's still a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the risk-free rate is 2% per month, but the time is 1/12 of a year, so the correct way is to calculate T as 1/12.

Wait, so if the risk-free rate is 2% per annum, but the time is one month, then r*T = 0.02 * (1/12) ≈ 0.0016667.

But I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify: the question says the one-month risk-free rate is 2%. So that would mean that for a one-month investment, the risk-free rate is 2%, so r = 0.02 for T=1 month.

So, the correct approach is to use r=0.02 and T=1 (in months), but when using the formula, T is in years. Wait, no, that's not correct. The formula uses T in years, so if the time is one month, T=1/12. But if the rate is given per month, then r would be 0.02 per month, and T=1, so r*T=0.02.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether T is in years or months. Let me make this clear.

In put-call parity, the formula is:

C - P = S - K * e^(-r*T)

Where T is the time to expiration in years, and r is the annual risk-free rate.

But in this question, the risk-free rate is given as 2% for one month. So, if the rate is 2% per month, then for T=1 month, r is 0.02, and T=1/12 years. So, r*T = 0.02 * (1/12) ≈ 0.0016667.

Wait, but that's if the rate is 2% per annum. No, that can't be right. Wait, no. If the rate is 2% per month, then that's 24% per annum. So, the annual rate would be 0.24, and T is 1/12.

So, r*T = 0.24 * (1/12) = 0.
