Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

There are 30 students from 5 classes, and they solved 40 math problems. Each student must answer at least one question. Now, every two students in the same class solved the same number of questions. Also, any two students in different classes have different numbers of questions they answered. The question is asking for the maximum possible number of students who only answered one question.

Hmm, so the key points here are:

1. 30 students in total, from 5 classes.
2. Each student answers at least one question, so the minimum is 1.
3. All students in the same class have the same number of answered questions.
4. Students from different classes have different counts of answered questions.
5. We need the maximum number of students who answered exactly one question.

Wait, so each class must have a unique number of questions answered, right? Because any two students from different classes have different counts. So each class is associated with a distinct number of questions.

Since there are 5 classes, there must be 5 distinct numbers representing the questions answered per class. Let's denote these as c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, where each ci is the number of questions each student in that class answered.

Each ci must be at least 1, and they all must be different. Also, the sum of all the questions answered by all students is 40. Each class has some number of students, say k1, k2, k3, k4, k5. Since there are 30 students in total, k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5 =30.

We need to maximize the number of students who answered exactly one question. So that's the sum of all ki where ci=1. But wait, since each class has a unique ci, only one class can have ci=1. Because if two classes had the same ci, that would violate the condition that any two students from different classes have different counts. So only one class can have students who answered 1 question each.

So the maximum number of students who answered one question is the size of the class with ci=1. We need to maximize this number, which means we should make as many students as possible in that class.

But we also have to satisfy the total sum of questions being 40. Let's think about how to arrange the ci's and the ki's to maximize the number of students in the class with ci=1, while keeping the total sum at 40.

Let me structure this:

Letâ€™s say one class has x students, each answering 1 question. So their total is x * 1 = x. The other four classes will have students answering more than 1 question each, and each of their counts must be unique.

So the other four classes must have ci values of at least 2, 3, 4, 5 in some order. But wait, since these counts must all be different, but the specific values depend on how we arrange them. To minimize the total questions used by these four classes, we should assign the smallest possible distinct values. That way, the remaining questions can be as low as possible, allowing x to be as large as possible.

So the minimal possible sum for the other four classes is when their c's are 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's check: 2+3+4+5 =14. So the sum of their students' questions would be sum(ci * ki) for i=2 to 5.

Wait, no. Wait. Each class has a certain number of students, each answering ci questions. So the total for each class is ki * ci.

If the other four classes have ci values of 2,3,4,5, then the sum from these classes will be k2*2 + k3*3 + k4*4 +k5*5.

But we need to make sure that k2 +k3 +k4 +k5 =30 - x, since the total number of students is 30, and x are in the first class.

We want to minimize the sum of questions from the other four classes so that the sum x + (sum for other classes) =40. So to maximize x, we need the sum of other classes to be as small as possible.

So what's the minimal possible sum for the other four classes, given that their c's are 2,3,4,5, and the number of students in each is at least 1 (since each class must have some students, right? The problem says 30 students from 5 classes, so each class has at least one student.)

So each of the other four classes must have at least one student. So k2, k3, k4, k5 >=1.

So the minimal sum from other classes is when each of these four classes has exactly 1 student, each with c=2,3,4,5 respectively. Then the sum would be 2+3+4+5=14. And the number of students in these classes is 4. So x would be 30-4=26. Then the total sum would be x*1 +14=26+14=40, which is exactly what we need.

So in this scenario, x is 26. So the maximum number of students who answered exactly one question is 26.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the other classes could have more students, but that would require their c's to be higher, which might increase the sum beyond 14, thus reducing x.

Wait, no. Because if the other classes have more students, but their c's are higher, the sum could be higher. Let me think.

Wait, wait. Let's make sure that the c's for the other classes are assigned optimally. Since each class must have a unique c, and the first class is 1, the others must be 2,3,4,5. If we have more students in the lower c classes, the sum would be lower.

So for the other four classes, to minimize their total sum, we can have as many students as possible in the class with c=2, then c=3, etc. Because putting more students in lower c's reduces the total sum.

Wait, but each class must have at least one student. So for the other four classes, the minimal sum occurs when each has exactly one student: 2+3+4+5=14. Any other distribution with more students in any of these classes would require that class to have more students, thus increasing the sum.

For example, if k2=2, and the others are 1 each, then sum would be 2*2 +3 +4 +5=4+3+4+5=16, which is higher than 14. So yes, the minimal sum is indeed 14 when each of the other classes has 1 student.

So in that case, the first class has x=26 students, each answering 1 question, contributing 26 to the total. The other four classes contribute 14, making the total 40. Perfect.

So the maximum possible number of students who answered exactly one question is 26, which is option E.

Wait, but let me look back at the options. The options are:

A:22, B:24, C:25, D:30, E:26, F:18, G:20, H:28, I:15, J:10.

So option E is 26, which matches our calculation.

But wait, could there be any other arrangement where x is higher? Let's think. Suppose instead of the other four classes having 2,3,4,5, maybe some other combination allows a lower sum. But wait, 2,3,4,5 are the minimal possible distinct integers after 1. So I don't think so. Any other set of four distinct integers greater than 1 would sum to more than 14.

For example, 2,3,4,6 sums to 15. So that would make the total sum x +15=40 =>x=25, which is less than 26. So that's worse.

Alternatively, if we have lower c's, but they can't be lower than 2 because 1 is already taken by the first class.

So yes, the minimal sum for the other classes is indeed 14, leading to x=26.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who answered exactly one question, given the constraints:

1. There are 30 students from 5 classes.
2. Each student answers at least one question.
3. All students in the same class answer the same number of questions.
4. Students from different classes answer different numbers of questions.
5. The total number of questions answered by all students is 40.

### Key Observations:
- Since students in the same class answer the same number of questions, each class is associated with a distinct number of questions. Let these numbers be \( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5 \), where \( c_i \geq 1 \) and all \( c_i \) are distinct.
- To maximize the number of students who answered exactly one question, we should maximize the size of the class where \( c_i = 1 \). Only one class can have \( c_i = 1 \), as the problem requires distinct question counts across classes.

### Minimizing the Total Questions from Other Classes:
To maximize the number of students in the class with \( c_i = 1 \), we need to minimize the total number of questions answered by the other four classes. The smallest distinct values for \( c_i \) (greater than 1) are \( 2, 3, 4, 5 \). If each of these classes has exactly 1 student, the total number of questions they contribute is:
\[
2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14
\]
The total number of students in these four classes is \( 4 \).

### Maximizing the Number of Students in the Class with \( c_i = 1 \):
Let \( x \) be the number of students in the class with \( c_i = 1 \). The total number of students is 30, so:
\[
x + 4 = 30 \implies x = 26
\]
The total number of questions answered by all students is 40. The class with \( c_i = 1 \) contributes \( x \cdot 1 = 26 \), and the other four classes contribute 14. Thus:
\[
26 + 14 = 40
\]
This satisfies the total number of questions.

### Conclusion:
The maximum possible number of students who answered exactly one question is \( 26 \).
