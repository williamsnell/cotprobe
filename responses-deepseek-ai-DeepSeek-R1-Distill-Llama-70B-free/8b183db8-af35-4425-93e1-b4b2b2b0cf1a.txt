Okay, so I have this question about alpha particles and what happens to an element's mass number when it ejects one. Hmm, I remember that alpha particles are related to nuclear reactions, probably radioactive decay. Let's think.

Wait, an alpha particle is a helium nucleus, right? So that's 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So when an element emits an alpha particle, it's losing those 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

But the question is about the mass number. Oh wait, the mass number is the total number of protons plus neutrons. So if you lose 2 protons and 2 neutrons, that's a total of 4 particles lost. So the mass number should decrease by 4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's think of an example. Like, uranium-238 decays by emitting an alpha particle. The resulting element would be thorium-234. Oh yeah, because 238 minus 4 is 234. So the mass number reduces by 4.

So looking at the options, which one is a decrease of 4? Let me check the options. Option F is 'reduces by 4.' So the answer should be F.

I think that's right. Because when an atom ejects an alpha particle (mass number 4), its own mass number goes down by 4. So the correct choice is F.

When an element ejects an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, the mass number of the element decreases by 4. This is because the mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons, and losing 4 nucleons (2 protons + 2 neutrons) results in a reduction of 4 in the mass number. For example, when uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, it becomes thorium-234. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

F: reduces by 4

Answer: F
