Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

You are a consultant asked to design an intervention program in a recently integrated housing project where antagonism and hostility between old and new residents are extremely high. The goal is to improve relations through contact. You would be more likely to facilitate that goal if you could arrange interactions that provide opportunities

Options:

A: for each group to reinforce their own positive traits without considering the other
B: where old and new residents are separated during most interactions
C: which encourage residents to ignore each other's presence
D: which provide an open airing and all-out discussion about what each group believes to be the negative crits of the other
E: which make explicit the status hierarchy chat is implicit in the interactions between the wo groups
F: that allow residents to vent their frustrations without any moderation
G: where residents can engage in competitive activities to establish dominance
H: for each group of residents co disconfirm negative traits of the other group
I: that involve only the leaders of each resident group in discussions

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about designing an intervention program in a housing project where there's a lot of antagonism between old and new residents. The goal is to improve relations through contact. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that when you have conflicting groups, certain types of interactions can help reduce tensions.

The question is asking which arrangement of interactions would best facilitate improved relations. Let me think about the options one by one.

Option A says each group reinforces their own positive traits without considering the other. That doesn't sound right. If each group is just focusing on themselves, they might not actually interact or address the issues between them. It could even make things worse by reinforcing stereotypes, maybe?

Option B suggests separating the groups during most interactions. That doesn't seem helpful. Separation usually doesn't help with integration. If they don't interact, how can they improve their relations? It might just keep the hostility as is.

Option C is about ignoring each other's presence. Ignoring the problem doesn't solve it. If they ignore each other, the tension might remain or even increase because issues aren't being addressed.

Option D talks about an open airing of negative criticisms. I think this is like having a big discussion where each group lists the other's negatives. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. It might lead to arguments and defensiveness rather than understanding. Unless it's done in a structured way, like with a mediator, but the option doesn't specify that.

Option E mentions making the status hierarchy explicit. I'm not too sure about this. If the hierarchy is made clear, maybe it could lead to more competition or reinforce existing power imbalances, which might not help reduce hostility.

Option F is about venting frustrations without moderation. That sounds like it could be counterproductive. Without any structure or moderation, venting might just lead to more arguments and escalate tensions.

Option G suggests competitive activities to establish dominance. Competition can sometimes help, but I think it's more likely to increase conflict, especially if the goal is to establish dominance. It might make the groups feel more apart rather than together.

Option H says each group can disconfirm negative traits of the other. Oh, wait, disconfirming negative traits... So, if each group can show the other that they don't fit the negative stereotypes, that could reduce prejudice. Like, through positive interactions where they prove the other group wrong about their negative assumptions. That sounds familiar, maybe related to the contact hypothesis or something like that.

Option I involves only the leaders in discussions. That might help with the leaders themselves, but it doesn't involve the rest of the residents. For real change, you probably need more widespread interaction, not just leadership.

So, putting it all together, the best option is probably H. Because when groups interact in a way that challenges their negative stereotypes, it can lead to better relations. This makes me think of the concept where positive contact reduces prejudice because it disconfirms the negative views each group has of the other.

To design an effective intervention program aimed at improving relations between old and new residents in a housing project, it is essential to focus on interactions that challenge and reduce negative stereotypes. Among the options provided, the most effective approach is to create opportunities where each group can disconfirm the negative traits the other group believes about them. This approach aligns with psychological principles such as the contact hypothesis, which suggests that positive interactions can reduce prejudice by challenging preexisting negative assumptions. 

Other options, such as reinforcing separate positive traits (A), separating groups (B), ignoring each other (C), airing negative criticisms without structure (D), emphasizing status hierarchies (E), unmoderated venting (F), competitive activities (G), or involving only leaders (I), are less likely to foster meaningful improvement in relations. These alternatives either fail to address the root causes of hostility or may exacerbate tensions. Therefore, the best choice is:

H: for each group of residents to disconfirm negative traits of the other group.

Answer: H
