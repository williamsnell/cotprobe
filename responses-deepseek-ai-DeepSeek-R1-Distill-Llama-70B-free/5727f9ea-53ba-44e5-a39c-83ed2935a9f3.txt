Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the heat capacity of a solution. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on thermochemistry, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that when one mole of NaCl reacts with sufficient water to form a 12% NaCl solution by weight, the enthalpy change (ΔH) is 774.6 cal at 20°C and 700.8 cal at 25°C. They also give the heat capacities (C_p) for solid NaCl as 12 cal/deg·mol and for water as 18 cal/deg·mol. The question is to find the heat capacity of the solution in cal/deg·g.

Wait, I remember that when a process occurs at constant pressure, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) is related to the heat capacity (C_p) and the temperature change. Oh right, the formula is ΔH = C_p * ΔT. But wait, in this case, the reaction is happening at different temperatures, so maybe we're looking at the change in ΔH with temperature.

So the idea is that the change in enthalpy when the temperature changes from 20°C to 25°C (which is a 5°C increase) is due to the heat capacities of the reactants and products. 

Let me think: the reaction is NaCl(s) dissolving in water to form an aqueous solution. The ΔH values given are for the dissolution process at two different temperatures. The difference in ΔH between the two temperatures should be related to the heat capacities of the substances involved.

Wait, the dissolution process is NaCl(s) → NaCl(aq). So the process involves one mole of NaCl solid dissolving. The ΔH at 20°C is 774.6 cal, and at 25°C, it's 700.8 cal. The change in ΔH is 700.8 - 774.6 = -73.8 cal. And this change happens over a 5 degree increase in temperature.

But wait, I think that when temperature increases, the ΔH of the process changes based on the heat capacities of the reactants and products. The formula I remember is:

ΔH2 = ΔH1 + (T2 - T1) * [C_p(products) - C_p(reactants)]

In this case, the reactant is NaCl(s) and the product is NaCl(aqueous). But wait, the dissolution also involves water. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The dissolution process is endothermic or exothermic, and the heat capacities of the solution and the solid NaCl are involved.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The dissolution of NaCl in water is accompanied by a change in enthalpy. The solution's heat capacity would affect how the enthalpy changes with temperature.

Wait, another thought: the ΔH for the dissolution at different temperatures can be modeled using Kirchhoff's Law, which states that the change in ΔH with temperature is equal to the heat capacity change multiplied by the temperature change. So, ΔH2 - ΔH1 = (C_p, solution - C_p, reactants) * (T2 - T1).

Wait, but the reactants here are NaCl(s) and water. The products are the NaCl solution. So the total heat capacities would be for the solution, minus the sum of the heat capacities of the reactants.

Wait, let's model it. Let me denote:

At T1 = 20°C, ΔH1 = 774.6 cal.
At T2 = 25°C, ΔH2 = 700.8 cal.
ΔT = T2 - T1 = 5°C.

The change in ΔH is ΔH2 - ΔH1 = 700.8 - 774.6 = -73.8 cal.

According to Kirchhoff's Law, this change should be equal to (C_p of products - C_p of reactants) multiplied by ΔT.

So: ΔΔH = (C_p, solution - (C_p NaCl(s) + C_p water)) ) * ΔT.

Wait, but wait, the reaction is 1 mole of NaCl(s) dissolving in water to form the solution. So the products are the solution, which has a certain amount of NaCl and water. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the solution's heat capacity would be the sum of the heat capacities of NaCl(aq) and water, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that the process is the dissolution of NaCl(s) into solution. So the reactants are 1 mole NaCl(s) and some water, and the product is the solution.

So, the heat capacity change ΔC_p would be C_p(solution) - (C_p NaCl(s) + C_p water * n), where n is moles of water involved. Hmm, but that might be tricky because we don't know how much water is involved.

Wait, perhaps the solution's heat capacity is considered as a separate entity. Because when you dissolve NaCl in water, the resulting solution has a certain heat capacity, and that's what we're trying to find.

Wait, the question gives that the solution is 12% NaCl by weight. So I can find the total mass of the solution, and then find how much NaCl and water are present.

Let me think: let's say I have 1 mole of NaCl. The molar mass of NaCl is about 58.44 g/mol (Na is ~23, Cl ~35.5). So 1 mole is 58.44 grams.

The solution is 12% NaCl by weight. So the total mass of the solution is such that 12% of it is NaCl. So, if the NaCl is 58.44 g, then the total solution mass is (58.44 g) / 0.12 = 486.2 g. So the solution's total mass is 486.2 grams.

Therefore, the mass of water in the solution is 486.2 g - 58.44 g = 427.76 g. Since the molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, the moles of water are 427.76 / 18 ≈ 23.76 moles.

So, in the solution, we have 1 mole NaCl and ~23.76 moles of water.

Wait, but the heat capacity of the solution would be the sum of the heat capacities of NaCl(aq) and water. Wait, but no, because the solution's heat capacity per gram is what's being asked. So perhaps the total heat capacity of the solution is (moles NaCl * C_p NaCl(aq)) + (moles H2O * C_p H2O). But wait, the problem gives C_p for solid NaCl and for water as 12 and 18 cal/(deg·mol), respectively. But when NaCl is in solution, is its C_p the same as the solid? Probably not, but the problem doesn't give C_p for NaCl(aq), so maybe it's assumed to be the same as the solid. Or perhaps the solution's C_p is treated as the sum of the C_p of the solute and solvent.

Wait, the problem states that the ΔH values are for the reaction of one mole of NaCl with sufficient water to form the solution. So the reactants are 1 mole NaCl(s) and a certain amount of water (liquid), and the product is the solution, which is a mixture of NaCl(aq) and water.

So, for the reaction:

NaCl(s) + H2O(l) → NaCl(aq)

But in terms of heat capacity, the solution's C_p would be (C_p of NaCl(aq) * moles NaCl) + (C_p of H2O(l) * moles H2O)).

But without knowing the exact moles of water, perhaps we can use the total solution's mass to find the specific heat.

Wait, but the question is asking for the specific heat capacity per gram of the solution, so perhaps we can model it as:

C_p(solution) = [ (moles NaCl * C_p NaCl) + (moles H2O * C_p H2O) ) ] / total mass of solution.

Because the specific heat is the total heat capacity divided by the mass.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the change in ΔH with temperature to find the solution's C_p.

Let me get back to Kirchhoff's Law. The change in ΔH with temperature is given by ΔC_p * ΔT, where ΔC_p is the difference in heat capacities between products and reactants.

So, the dissolution reaction is:

NaCl(s) → NaCl(aq)

But considering that the solution is formed from NaCl(s) and water, perhaps the reaction is:

NaCl(s) + H2O(l) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) ?

Wait, no, the H2O is part of the solution, so maybe the correct way is that the solution is NaCl(aq) + H2O, but the reaction is NaCl(s) dissolving in H2O(l) to form NaCl(aq).

So, the reactants are NaCl(s) and H2O(l), and the products are NaCl(aq) and H2O(l). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because H2O is on both sides. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is NaCl(s) dissolving in water to form the solution, so the product is the solution, which contains NaCl and water.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the solution as a separate component. So, the dissolution reaction is:

NaCl(s) → NaCl(aq)

And when NaCl dissolves, it's accompanied by water. So, the process's heat capacity change is the C_p of the solution minus the C_p of NaCl(s) and the C_p of water involved.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think in terms of the given data.

The ΔH changes from 774.6 cal at 20°C to 700.8 cal at 25°C, a decrease of 73.8 cal over 5 degrees. According to Kirchhoff's Law, this change is due to the difference in heat capacities between the products and reactants.

The formula would be:

ΔH2 - ΔH1 = (C_p, products - C_p, reactants) * (T2 - T1)

Here, the change in enthalpy is -73.8 cal, and the temperature change is +5°C.

So,

-73.8 = (C_p, solution - [C_p NaCl(s) + C_p H2O * n]) ) * 5

Wait, but how much water is involved? Because when NaCl dissolves, it's in a certain amount of water. From earlier, the solution is 12% NaCl, so for 1 mole NaCl (58.44g), the solution is 486.2g, with 427.76g water, which is about 23.76 moles.

So, in the reaction, 1 mole NaCl(s) + 23.76 moles H2O(l) → solution (486.2g).

So, the reactants are 1 mole NaCl(s) and 23.76 moles H2O(l). The product is the solution, which has a total mass of 486.2g.

But wait, the solution's heat capacity would be the sum of the heat capacities of NaCl(aq) and H2O in the solution. So, perhaps the heat capacity of the solution is (1 * C_p NaCl(aq) + 23.76 * C_p H2O) / 486.2g, since specific heat is per gram.

Wait, but the problem gives C_p for NaCl(s) as 12 cal/deg·mol and for water as 18 cal/deg·mol. It doesn't provide C_p for NaCl(aq). Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm supposed to assume that the C_p of NaCl(aq) is the same as NaCl(s)? That might be an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's heat capacity is considered as the weighted average of the components. So, considering the mass percentages.

Wait, the solution is 12% NaCl by mass, so 58.44g NaCl and 427.76g H2O in 486.2g solution.

The specific heat capacity (C_p) of the solution would then be:

C_p = ( (mass NaCl * C_p NaCl) + (mass H2O * C_p H2O) ) / total mass

But wait, the units here are in cal/(deg·g). So, the calculation would be:

C_p = [ (58.44g * C_p NaCl) + (427.76g * C_p H2O) ] / 486.2g

But I don't know C_p NaCl(aq). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the C_p of NaCl in solution is the same as in solid form. That might be a stretch, but let's proceed with that assumption.

So, C_p NaCl(aq) = 12 cal/(deg·mol)

Similarly, C_p H2O is 18 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, but wait. Moles vs mass. The specific heat I'm calculating is per gram, so perhaps I should calculate the total heat capacity per mole for each component and then find the specific heat.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total heat capacity per gram for each component and then take the weighted average.

Wait, for NaCl, molar mass is 58.44 g/mol, and C_p is 12 cal/(deg·mol), so per gram, it's 12 / 58.44 ≈ 0.205 cal/(deg·g).

For water, molar mass is 18 g/mol, C_p 18 cal/(deg·mol), so per gram, 18/18 = 1 cal/(deg·g).

So, the solution has 12% NaCl and 88% water by mass. Therefore, the specific heat of the solution would be:

C_p = 0.12 * (12/58.44) + 0.88 * (18/18)

Let me compute that:

0.12 * (12/58.44) = 0.12 * 0.205 ≈ 0.0246
0.88 * (18/18) = 0.88 * 1 = 0.88

So, total C_p ≈ 0.0246 + 0.88 ≈ 0.9046 cal/(deg·g)

Wait, that's around 0.90, which is close to option C (0.92) or E (0.87) or G (0.75). Hmm.

But wait, the question is using the ΔH values to compute the specific heat, not just taking an average based on mass. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me think again. The change in ΔH with temperature is given by the difference in C_p between products and reactants times the temperature change.

So, ΔH2 - ΔH1 = (C_p, products - C_p, reactants) * (T2 - T1)

Here, ΔH2 is 700.8 cal at 25°C, and ΔH1 is 774.6 cal at 20°C. So, ΔH2 - ΔH1 = 700.8 - 774.6 = -73.8 cal.

The temperature change T2 - T1 = 5°C.

So,

-73.8 cal = (C_p, solution - [C_p NaCl(s) + n_water * C_p H2O ]) * 5°C

Wait, but how much water is involved? Earlier, for 1 mole NaCl, we have about 23.76 moles H2O. So, n_water is 23.76.

So,

C_p, solution - (12 cal/(deg·mol) + 23.76 * 18 cal/(deg·mol)) ) = (-73.8) / 5 = -14.76 cal/deg

Wait, because the left side is (C_p, solution (in cal/(deg·mol)) ) minus the sum of the reactants' C_p.

Wait, but wait, the reactants are 1 mole NaCl(s) and 23.76 moles H2O(l), so their total C_p is (1 * 12) + (23.76 * 18) cal/(deg·mol).

Calculating that:

1*12 = 12
23.76 * 18 = let's compute 23 *18 = 414, 0.76*18=13.68, total 414+13.68=427.68

So total C_p reactants = 12 + 427.68 = 439.68 cal/(deg·mol)

So,

C_p, solution - 439.68 = -14.76

Thus, C_p, solution = 439.68 -14.76 = 424.92 cal/(deg·mol)

Wait, but that's the molar heat capacity of the solution. But the question asks for specific heat capacity in cal/(deg·g).

So, to get specific heat, we need to know the molar mass of the solution.

Wait, the solution is 486.2 g for 1 mole NaCl + 23.76 moles H2O. So total moles is 1 + 23.76 = 24.76 moles? Wait, no, because the solution is a mixture, not a compound. The molar mass of the solution isn't directly the sum of moles times their molar masses. Wait, no, the solution's mass is 486.2 g, which we've already calculated.

So, the molar mass of the solution is not directly applicable because it's a mixture. Instead, the specific heat is the total heat capacity divided by the total mass.

Wait, the solution's total heat capacity is 424.92 cal/(deg·mol) per mole of solution? Wait, no, because the reaction is per mole of NaCl. So, for 1 mole of NaCl, the solution is 486.2 g.

So, the molar heat capacity of the solution is 424.92 cal/(deg·mol) for 486.2 g. To get specific heat capacity (per gram), divide by the mass.

So, specific heat = 424.92 cal/(deg·mol) / 486.2 g/mol = ?

Wait, 424.92 divided by 486.2. Let me compute that.

424.92 ÷ 486.2 ≈ 0.874 cal/(deg·g)

Hmm, that's approximately 0.874, which is close to option E (0.87) or option I (1.01), etc.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

So
