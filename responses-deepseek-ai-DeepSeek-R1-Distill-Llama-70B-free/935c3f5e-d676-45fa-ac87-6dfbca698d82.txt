Question:

A seller and a buyer signed a contract of sale for improved real property. The contract contained a financing contingency for a certain percentage of the purchase price. The buyer obtained the requisite financing from a bank. At the closing, the buyer executed a note to the seller for a portion of the purchase price, which note was not secured by a mortgage. The buyer then executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to the bank, applying the bank loan proceeds to the purchase price of the property. The bank had actual knowledge of the prior note to the seller. The bank promptly recorded its mortgage. The buyer is now in default on both notes. There is no applicable statute. Which party has priority?

Options:

A: The buyer, because he executed both notes.
B: The bank, because it provided financing for the purchase of the property.
C: The seller, because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.
D: The bank, because its loan satisfied the financing contingency in the contract of sale.
E: The seller, because the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.
F: The seller, because the buyer's note to him was not secured by a mortgage.
G: The bank, because it promptly recorded its mortgage.
H: The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.
I: The buyer, because he is the one in default on both notes.
J: The seller, because the bank's loan did not fully cover the purchase price.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate question about priorities between a seller's note and a bank's mortgage. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a seller and buyer entered into a contract for improved real property. The contract has a financing contingency for a certain percentage of the purchase price. The buyer got the necessary financing from a bank. 

At closing, the buyer executed two notes. The first note is to the seller and isn't secured by a mortgage. The second note is secured by a mortgage to the bank, and the bank's loan is applied to the purchase price. The bank knew about the prior note to the seller and recorded its mortgage quickly. Now, the buyer is defaulting on both notes, and there's no statute involved.

The question is about which party has priority.

Hmm. So, in real estate, when multiple liens are involved, priority usually depends on the order in which they were recorded or, sometimes, on the type of lien. But here, the seller's note isn't secured by a mortgage, so it's probably an unsecured note, whereas the bank has a mortgage.

Wait, but the bank's mortgage was recorded promptly. Also, the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note. I think that the general rule is "first in time, first in right," but that applies when both are properly recorded. But if one is unrecorded, it might be different.

Wait, the seller's note isn't secured, so does that mean it's not a lien? Because a mortgage is a lien on the property. An unsecured note is just a personal debt, so it doesn't attach to the property. So the seller's note is just a personal obligation, whereas the bank has a mortgage lien on the property.

Wait, but the seller might have a vendor's lien. A vendor's lien arises when a seller provides financing as part of the sale. So even if it's not explicitly stated, some jurisdictions impose a vendor's lien by operation of law when the seller takes a note as part of the purchase price.

But in this case, the seller's note isn't secured by a mortgage. So does that mean the seller didn't take a lien on the property? Or does the vendor's lien apply regardless?

I'm a bit confused here. Vendor's liens typically are for the unpaid purchase price, and they are equitable liens. But whether they are automatically recognized can depend on the jurisdiction.

Alternatively, if the seller's note is unsecured, then the seller doesn't have a lien. The bank has a mortgage, which is a lien. So the bank's mortgage would have priority because it's a recorded lien, whereas the seller's is just an unsecured debt.

Wait, but the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note. Does that affect anything? Normally, under recording statutes, a subsequent bona fide purchaser without notice can have priority over a prior unrecorded lien. But if the bank had knowledge, maybe that affects whether it's a bona fide purchaser. But in this case, the seller's note wasn't recorded, and the bank's mortgage was recorded promptly.

Wait, but the seller's note isn't a lien, so it doesn't need to be recorded. Because only interests in real property need to be recorded. An unsecured note is a personal obligation, not a property interest. So the seller's claim is against the buyer personally, not against the property.

Therefore, when the buyer defaults, the bank can foreclose on the mortgage because it's a lien on the property, whereas the seller can only pursue the buyer personally, not the property.

Wait, but the seller might have a vendor's lien. So if the seller provided financing, even without a mortgage, some states automatically impose a vendor's lien. If that's the case, then the seller's lien would have priority over the bank's mortgage only if it was recorded first. But in this case, the seller's note wasn't secured, so perhaps the vendor's lien isn't applicable, or maybe it's implied.

Alternatively, perhaps the seller's note is considered a purchase money mortgage. Wait, the bank's note is a purchase money mortgage because it was used to purchase the property. The seller's note is also part of the purchase price, so it could be a purchase money mortgage as well.

Wait, but the seller's note is unsecured. So maybe it's not a mortgage. So the seller has an unsecured note, while the bank has a secured mortgage.

So when it comes to priority, the bank's mortgage, being a lien on the property, would take priority over any unsecured claims. Because when the buyer defaults, the secured creditor (bank) can foreclose and get paid from the sale proceeds before the unsecured creditor (seller).

But wait, what about the timing? The seller's note was executed first, at closing, before the bank's mortgage. But if the seller's note isn't a lien, then it's just an unsecured debt. The bank's mortgage is a lien, so it's a secured debt. So the secured debt takes priority over the unsecured, regardless of when it was created.

So the bank would have priority because their mortgage is a lien on the property, recorded promptly, and the seller's note is just an unsecured obligation. 

Looking at the options, option G says the bank because it promptly recorded its mortgage. Option H says the bank because it's a purchase money mortgage. Option C says the seller because he retained a vendor's lien first in time.

Wait, but the seller didn't have a lien because the note wasn't secured. So the vendor's lien might not apply here. Alternatively, maybe the seller's note is considered a vendor's lien, making it a lien without needing a mortgage. But I'm not sure about that.

In some jurisdictions, a vendor's lien is automatically created when the seller provides financing. So if the seller took a note for part of the purchase price, even without a mortgage, a vendor's lien arises. If that's the case, the seller's lien would have priority over the bank's mortgage only if it was recorded first.

But in this case, the seller's note wasn't secured, so maybe there's no vendor's lien. Or perhaps the vendor's lien is implied. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

If the seller has a vendor's lien, then that lien would have priority. But whether it's recorded depends. Vendor's liens are typically not recorded unless the seller takes steps to do so. But in this case, the seller didn't record a mortgage because the note wasn't secured. So perhaps the vendor's lien isn't recorded.

The bank's mortgage was recorded promptly. Under recording statutes, a subsequent lien (like the bank's) would have priority over a prior unrecorded lien (like the vendor's lien). But if the vendor's lien is considered to exist and is unrecorded, the bank, having recorded, would have priority if they are a bona fide purchaser. But the bank here isn't a purchaser; they're a lender. The bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note, so they can't claim bona fide purchaser status. 

Wait, but the bank's mortgage was recorded before the seller's, but the seller's wasn't recorded at all. So even if the seller had a vendor's lien, because it wasn't recorded, the bank's recorded mortgage would take priority.

So in that case, the bank's mortgage would be first in priority.

Alternatively, if the vendor's lien is not recorded and the bank's mortgage is recorded, then the bank's mortgage would have priority because it's recorded, even though the vendor's lien was created first.

So which option aligns with this? Option G says bank because it recorded promptly. Option H says bank because it's a purchase money mortgage.

Wait, purchase money mortgages have priority under some doctrines. A purchase money mortgage is a mortgage given to secure payment of the purchase price. So the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage because it's for the purchase of the property. The seller's note is also for the purchase price, so it could be a purchase money mortgage as well.

But since the seller's note isn't secured, it's not a mortgage, so it doesn't get the same priority as a purchase money mortgage.

In some states, purchase money mortgages have priority over other liens, even if recorded later, but that's not the case here because the bank recorded promptly.

Wait, no, the bank's mortgage was recorded promptly, so it would have priority over any unrecorded liens, like the seller's unsecured note.

So putting it all together, the bank's mortgage, being a recorded lien, has priority over the seller's unrecorded and unsecured note. So the bank has priority.

Looking back at the options:

Option G: The bank, because it promptly recorded its mortgage.

Option H: The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.

So which is correct? The priority comes from the recording, but also the type of mortgage.

Wait, purchase money mortgages do have priority. In some jurisdictions, a purchase money mortgage (like the bank's) has priority over other claims, even if they were created earlier, especially if the other claims aren't secured.

But in this case, the seller's note isn't a mortgage, so it's just an unsecured debt. The bank's is a secured purchase money mortgage, which would take priority over unsecured debts upon default.

So the bank's mortgage has priority because it's a purchase money mortgage and a secured lien, so option H.

Wait, but another angle: The financing contingency was satisfied by the bank's loan. The contract had a financing contingency for a percentage of the purchase price. The buyer obtained that from the bank, so the contingency was met, making the contract enforceable.

But I'm not sure if that affects the priority.

Alternatively, the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage, which is treated as such and given priority.

So I think the correct answer is H: The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.

But wait, another thought. The seller's note could be considered a purchase money mortgage as well, but it's unsecured. So perhaps the seller's lien, if any, would have priority as a purchase money mortgage, but since it's not secured, maybe not.

Wait, the seller's note isn't secured, so it's not a mortgage. The bank's is a mortgage, so it's a lien. So the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage lien, which has higher priority than an unsecured note from the seller.

So yes, the bank's mortgage would have priority because it's a purchase money mortgage and a secured lien.

So the answer is H.

The question revolves around determining the priority of claims between a seller's unsecured note and a bank's mortgage when a buyer defaults on both obligations. The seller and buyer entered into a contract for the sale of real property, which included a financing contingency. The buyer obtained financing from the bank, executing a note secured by a mortgage, while also executing a separate, unsecured note to the seller. The bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note and promptly recorded its mortgage. The buyer is now in default on both notes.

Key considerations include:

1. **Nature of the Seller's Note**: The seller's note is unsecured, meaning it does not create a lien on the property. Without a lien, the seller's claim is a personal debt against the buyer, not tied to the property itself.

2. **Bank's Mortgage**: The bank's note is secured by a mortgage, which is a lien on the property. The bank promptly recorded its mortgage, giving it priority over unrecorded interests under recording statutes.

3. **Vendor's Lien**: While some jurisdictions may recognize an equitable vendor's lien for unpaid purchase price, the seller's note being unsecured suggests that no such lien was explicitly created or recorded. Even if a vendor's lien existed, it would likely be subordinate to the bank's recorded mortgage.

4. **Purchase Money Mortgage**: The bank's mortgage qualifies as a purchase money mortgage, as it was used to finance the purchase of the property. Purchase money mortgages generally have priority over other claims, especially unsecured debts.

5. **Actual Knowledge of the Bank**: The bank's actual knowledge of the seller's note does not affect its priority because the bank's mortgage was properly recorded, and the seller's note was not secured by a lien.

Given these factors, the bank's mortgage, being a secured and recorded lien, takes priority over the seller's unsecured note. The bank's priority stems from the fact that its mortgage is a purchase money mortgage and was promptly recorded, ensuring its interest in the property is protected.

**Analysis of Options**:
- **Option G**: While the bank's prompt recording is relevant, the primary reason for its priority is the nature of its secured, purchase money mortgage.
- **Option H**: Correct. The bank's mortgage is a secured, purchase money mortgage, which takes priority over the seller's unsecured note.

**Conclusion**: The bank has priority because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.
