Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question says that when 4.90 grams of KCLO3 was heated, it showed a weight loss of 0.384 grams. I need to find the percent of the original KCLO3 that had decomposed. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to calculate it and see which one matches.

Alright, I remember that when KCLO3 decomposes upon heating, it breaks down into KCl and KClO4, but wait, no, actually, I think the correct products are KCl and O2. Hmm, wait no, that's when something else decomposes. Oh wait, KCLO3, potassium chlorate, decomposes into KCl and oxygen gas. Or wait, is that right? Let me think again. Oh yes, I think the decomposition reaction is 2 KCLO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. So that's the balanced equation.

So the reaction is 2 moles of KCLO3 producing 2 moles of KCl and 3 moles of O2. The oxygen gas would be released, causing the weight loss because it's leaving the sample. So the weight loss is the mass of the oxygen gas produced.

The problem says the weight loss is 0.384 grams, which must be the mass of O2 produced. So I can use that to find out how much KCLO3 decomposed.

First, I'll write down the molar masses to find the moles of O2. The molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol (16 g/mol per O atom, times 2). So 0.384 grams of O2 is equal to 0.384 g / 32 g/mol = 0.012 moles of O2.

Looking at the balanced equation, 3 moles of O2 are produced from 2 moles of KCLO3. So the mole ratio is 3 moles O2 to 2 moles KCLO3. So for every 3 moles of O2, 2 moles of KCLO3 decompose.

So the moles of KCLO3 that decomposed is (2/3) * moles of O2. So that's (2/3) * 0.012 mol = 0.008 moles of KCLO3 decomposed.

Now I need to find the mass of KCLO3 that decomposed. The molar mass of KCLO3: K is about 39.1, Cl is 35.5, and O3 is 16*3=48. So 39.1 + 35.5 +48 = 122.6 g/mol.

So 0.008 mol * 122.6 g/mol = 0.9808 grams of KCLO3 decomposed.

Wait, but wait, the initial mass of KCLO3 was 4.90 grams. So the percent decomposed is (mass decomposed / original mass) * 100.

So that's (0.9808 g / 4.90 g) * 100. Let me calculate that. 0.9808 divided by 4.90 is approximately 0.2, so 20%. So the percent decomposed is 20%, which is option B.

Wait a minute, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So O2 is 0.384 g, divided by 32 g/mol is 0.012 moles. That's correct. Then moles of KCLO3 is (2/3)*0.012 = 0.008 moles. Molar mass of KCLO3: K=39.1, Cl=35.5, O=16*3=48. So 39.1 +35.5 is 74.6, plus 48 is 122.6. So 0.008 * 122.6 is 0.9808 grams. 0.9808 /4.90 is 0.2, which is 20%. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be B:20%.

To determine the percent of KCLO₃ that decomposed, we start with the decomposition reaction:

\[
2 \, \text{KCLO}_3 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{KCl} + 3 \, \text{O}_2
\]

The weight loss of 0.384 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen gas (O₂) released. Using the molar mass of O₂ (32 g/mol), the moles of O₂ produced are:

\[
\text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{0.384 \, \text{g}}{32 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.012 \, \text{mol}
\]

From the balanced equation, 3 moles of O₂ are produced for every 2 moles of KCLO₃ that decompose. Thus, the moles of KCLO₃ decomposed are:

\[
\text{Moles of KCLO}_3 = \frac{2}{3} \times 0.012 \, \text{mol} = 0.008 \, \text{mol}
\]

The molar mass of KCLO₃ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of KCLO}_3 = 39.1 \, (\text{K}) + 35.5 \, (\text{Cl}) + 3 \times 16 \, (\text{O}) = 122.6 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The mass of KCLO₃ decomposed is:

\[
\text{Mass of KCLO}_3 = 0.008 \, \text{mol} \times 122.6 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.9808 \, \text{g}
\]

The percent of KCLO₃ that decomposed is:

\[
\text{Percent decomposed} = \left( \frac{0.9808 \, \text{g}}{4.90 \, \text{g}} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Thus, the percent of the original KCLO₃ that decomposed is **20%**, corresponding to option **B**.
