Okay, so I have this statistics question here about finding the mode of a sample. Hmm, I remember that the mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. But wait, I should make sure I'm not confusing it with mean or median. Mean is the average, and median is the middle value when the data is ordered. Mode is definitely about frequency, right?

Looking at the sample given: 14, 16, 21, 19, 18, 24, 17. Let me list them out to see if any numbers repeat. Let's see, I'll go through each one.

14 appears once. Next is 16, also once. Then 21 once, 19 once, 18 once, 24 once, and 17 once. Wait, so each of these numbers occurs exactly once? That means there's no number that repeats more than others. 

If all the numbers in the dataset are unique, then there's no mode. Because the mode is the most common one, and if they all appear the same number of times, there's no mode at all. So in this case, the mode doesn't exist for this sample.

Looking at the options, option A is "no mode". So the correct answer should be A.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. In the given sample (14, 16, 21, 19, 18, 24, 17), each number occurs exactly once. Since there is no number that repeats more than others, there is no mode for this dataset.

Answer: A
