Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Parfit's claims on the magnitude of pains. Hmm, I remember Parfit is a philosopher known for his work in ethics and personal identity. I think he discussed this in the context of moral theories or something related to comparing experiences.

The question is asking about whether the magnitude of pains can be compared, and the options are A through D. Let me think about what each option says.

Option A says they can be precisely compared. That would mean we can exactly measure and compare the intensity, like using a scale. But I don't think Parfit believed that. From what I recall, he was more skeptical about precise measurements, especially between different people.

Option B suggests they can be compared, but only roughly. So maybe we can tell if one pain is worse than another, but not by how much. That sounds plausible because people can describe their pain on a scale from 1-10, but it's subjective. However, I'm not sure if Parfit would agree on even rough comparisons between individuals.

Option C says they can be compared within individuals but not between. So a person can compare their own past and present pains, but not with others. That makes sense because each person's experience is unique, and what's a 7 for me might be different for someone else. I think Parfit might have argued that cross-individual comparisons are problematic.

Option D claims they cannot be compared either within or between individuals. That seems too extreme. People do compare their own pains over time, like saying this headache is worse than the last one. So D is probably not correct.

Wait, I think Parfit's point was about comparing pains across different people. He might have said that we can't really know the exact magnitude of another person's pain. So within the same individual, you can compare, but not between individuals.

So looking back, the options are:

A: precise comparison—probably not.

B: rough comparison between individuals—maybe, but I'm not sure.

C: within individuals yes, between no.

D: can't compare at all.

I think the correct answer is C. Parfit likely argued that while an individual can compare their own pains, comparing between people isn't feasible because of the subjective nature of pain.

The correct answer is C: can be compared within individuals, but not between individuals.

Answer: C
