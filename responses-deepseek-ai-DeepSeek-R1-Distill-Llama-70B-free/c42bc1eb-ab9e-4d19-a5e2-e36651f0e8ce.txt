Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the reduced mass of a nitrogen molecule. Hmm, I remember that reduced mass is a concept from physics, probably in the context of two-body problems. Let me think about what I learned.

Wait, the nitrogen molecule is N2, right? So each atom has an atomic mass of 14.00. Oh wait, but wait, each nitrogen atom in the molecule would have the same mass. So the two atoms are identical in mass. 

Reduced mass, μ, is a term used when dealing with two bodies orbiting around their mutual center of mass. The formula for reduced mass is μ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2). Oh right, because when you have two masses, you can model their motion as a single mass orbiting a common center, which simplifies the equations of motion.

So since both masses are the same (m1 = m2 = 14.00), then m1 * m2 would be 14 * 14, which is 196. And m1 + m2 would be 28. So μ = 196 / 28. Let me do that calculation. 196 divided by 28 is... let's see, 28 times 7 is 196. Oh wait, 28 * 7 is 196, so 196/28 is 7. So the reduced mass is 7.00.

Looking at the options, option J is 7.00. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the atomic mass given in atomic mass units or kilograms? Oh, the question says 'atomic mass of 14.00', which I think refers to the atomic mass unit, but since both masses are in the same units, the ratio (or in this case, division) should be fine. So the units would cancel out, and the reduced mass would have the same unit as the individual masses. So the result is 7.00 in atomic mass units.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident it's J.

The reduced mass of a system is calculated using the formula:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

For a nitrogen molecule (N\(_2\)), both nitrogen atoms have the same mass (\(m_1 = m_2 = 14.00\)). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\mu = \frac{14.00 \cdot 14.00}{14.00 + 14.00} = \frac{196.00}{28.00} = 7.00
\]

Thus, the reduced mass of the nitrogen molecule is 7.00. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

J: 7.00

Answer: J
