Question:

In humans, the disease known as hemophilia is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Sally and Sam, both of whom are normal, marry, and they have three children: (1) Saul, a hemophiliac, who marries a normal woman and has a daughter, Sarah, who is normal; (2) a normal daughter, Sheryl, who marries a normal man and has a son, Solomon, who is a hemophiliac; and (3) Shirley, also normal, who marries and has six normal sons. Using the letters H and h for the normal and hemophilia genes, respectively, and \nearrow to represent the Y chromosome, determine the genotypes of Sally, Sam, Saul, Sarah, Sheryl, Solomon and Shirley.

Options:

A: Sally: HH, Sam: h\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
B: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: HH
C: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
D: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: HH
E: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: Hh, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
F: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
G: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
H: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
I: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: H\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: HH
J: Sally: Hh, Sam: h\nearrow, Saul: H\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about hemophilia. Hmm, I remember hemophilia is a sex-linked recessive trait. So the gene responsible is on the X chromosome. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about Sally and Sam, who are both normal. They have three children: Saul, Sheryl, and Shirley. Then those kids have their own kids. I need to figure out the genotypes of everyone involved.

Alright, let's start with Sally and Sam. Both are phenotypically normal, so they don't have hemophilia. Since it's X-linked recessive, males are more likely to have the disease because they have only one X. So if a father has hemophilia, he'll pass his X (with the h) to all his daughters because his Y goes to sons.

Wait, but Sally and Sam are both normal. So Sally's genotype could be either HH or Hh. And Sam, since he's male, his genotype for the X would be either H or h. But since he's normal, his X must have the dominant H. So Sam's genotype is H Y. Because if he had h Y, he would have hemophilia, which he doesn't.

Now, Sally must carry at least one H. But since their sons (Saul) has hemophilia, let's think about that. Hemophiliac sons get their X from their mother because the Y comes from the father. So if Saul is a hemophiliac (h), he must have gotten the h allele from Sally. Because Sam can only give his X to daughters or his Y to sons. So Sally must have given the h to Saul.

Wait, Sally is normal, so if she's passing an h to her son, she must be a carrier. That means Sally is Hh. Because if she were HH, she couldn't pass an h to her son. So Sally's genotype is Hh, and Sam is H (so H Y).

Now, looking at their children:

1. Saul is a hemophiliac. So his genotype is h Y. Because he gets the Y from Sam and the h from Sally. So his X is h.

Saul marries a normal woman. Let's think about her genotype. Since she's normal, she can be HH or Hh. But unless stated otherwise, I guess we can assume she's not a carrier? Or maybe she is. But Sarah, their daughter, is normal. So Sarah's genotype must be getting an X from each parent. From Saul, she gets his X, which is h. From her mother (Saul's wife), she gets an X. Since Sarah is normal, the mother must have given her an H. So Sarah's genotype is Hh (from mother's H and father's h). Wait, no, wait. Sarah's genotype would be H from mother and h from father. So her genotype is Hh. But wait, Sarah is phenotypically normal. So that's correct because H is dominant.

Wait, Sarah is normal, so her genotype is either HH or Hh. But her father can only give h, and the mother gives H. So Sarah is Hh. But in the options, Sarah's genotype varies. Let me check each option later.

2. Sheryl is normal. Let's see. Since Sheryl is a daughter of Sally (Hh) and Sam (H Y), she gets her X from Sally and her X from Sam. Wait, no: wait, Sam gives either X or Y. Wait, no, daughters get an X from each parent. So Sally can give H or h, and Sam gives his X (H). So Sheryl's genotype would be either HH or Hh.

Wait, Sheryl is a daughter. From Sally (Hh), she could get H or h. From Sam (H), she gets H. So Sheryl's genotype is either H (from Sam) and H (from Sally) → HH, or H (from Sam) and h (from Sally) → Hh. So Sheryl could be HH or Hh.

Sheryl marries a normal man. Let's think about his genotype. Since he's normal, his genotype is H Y (he can't have hh because Y doesn't have a corresponding allele). So Sheryl's sons would get their X from Sheryl and Y from the father.

Sheryl has a son, Solomon, who is a hemophiliac. So Solomon's genotype is h Y. So the X he got from Sheryl must be h. So Sheryl must have given her h allele. That means Sheryl's genotype must be Hh, because she has an h to pass on. Because if she were HH, she couldn't pass h.

So Sheryl is Hh. Because she gave an h to her son. Therefore, Sheryl's genotype is Hh.

3. Shirley is normal. She marries and has six normal sons. Let's think about her genotype. She's a daughter of Sally (Hh) and Sam (H Y). So she gets X from each. From Sam, it's H, and from Sally, it's H or h. So her genotype is either HH or Hh.

Shirley marries a normal man. Let's say his genotype is H Y. They have six sons, all normal. So each son gets Y from father and X from Shirley. If all sons are normal, then the X from Shirley must have H. Because if Shirley were Hh, there's a 50% chance each son would get H or h. But all six sons are normal, which suggests that Shirley gave only H, so her genotype must be HH. Because if she were Hh, half the sons would get h and have hemophilia. But since all are normal, she must be HH.

So putting it all together:

Sally: Hh (because she must carry an h to pass to Saul)
Sam: H Y (since he's normal)
Saul: h Y (because he has hemophilia)
Sarah: Hh (from mother H and father h)
Sheryl: Hh (since she passed h to her son)
Solomon: h Y (has hemophilia)
Shirley: HH (since all her sons are normal, she can't have an h to pass)

Now, let me look at the options. Let's go through each one.

Option D: Sally Hh, Sam H, Saul hY, Sarah Hh, Sheryl Hh, Solomon hY, Shirley HH. That matches what I have.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D:

Sally: Hh

Sam: H\nearrow

Saul: h\nearrow

Sarah: Hh

Sheryl: Hh

Solomon: h\nearrow

Shirley: HH

Yes, that's exactly what I concluded.

Looking at the other options. Option F has Sally Hh, Sam H, but Sarah is HH? No, Sarah is Hh because she gets h from father. So F is incorrect.

Option D seems correct.

Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive trait, meaning the gene responsible for it is located on the X chromosome. Males are more likely to express the disease since they have only one X chromosome, while females would need two copies of the recessive allele (one on each X chromosome) to express the disease.

### Analysis of the Family:
1. **Sally and Sam**: Both are phenotypically normal. Since hemophilia is X-linked recessive:
   - Sally must have at least one dominant allele (H). She could be either **HH** (homozygous dominant) or **Hh** (heterozyous carrier). 
   - Sam, being male, has only one X chromosome. Since he is normal, his X must carry the dominant allele (**H**), making his genotype **H\nearrow**.

   However, since their son Saul has hemophilia, Sally must have passed the recessive allele (**h**) to him. This means Sally cannot be **HH** (as she would only pass **H**). Therefore, Sally’s genotype must be **Hh**.

2. **Saul**: Saul has hemophilia, so his genotype is **h\nearrow** (he received the **h** from Sally and the **Y** from Sam).

   - Saul marries a normal woman. Since Sarah, their daughter, is normal, Sarah must have inherited the dominant allele (**H**) from her mother and the recessive allele (**h**) from her father. Thus, Sarah’s genotype is **Hh**.

3. **Sheryl**: Sheryl is a normal daughter of Sally (**Hh**) and Sam (**H\nearrow**). She could inherit either **H** or **h** from Sally and **H** from Sam, making her genotype either **HH** or **Hh**. 

   - Sheryl marries a normal man (**H\nearrow**) and has a son, Solomon, who has hemophilia (**h\nearrow**). For Solomon to have hemophilia, he must have inherited the **h** allele from Sheryl. This means Sheryl must be a carrier (**Hh**), as she can pass the **h** allele.

4. **Shirley**: Shirley is a normal daughter of Sally (**Hh**) and Sam (**H\nearrow**). Like Sheryl, she could inherit either **H** or **h** from Sally and **H** from Sam, making her genotype either **HH** or **Hh**. 

   - Shirley marries a normal man (**H\nearrow**) and has six normal sons. Since all her sons are normal, Shirley must have passed only the dominant allele (**H**) to them. This is only possible if her genotype is **HH**, as a heterozyous carrier (**Hh**) would have a 50% chance of passing the **h** allele.

### Final Genotypes:
- **Sally**: **Hh**
- **Sam**: **H\nearrow**
- **Saul**: **h\nearrow**
- **Sarah**: **Hh**
- **Sheryl**: **Hh**
- **Solomon**: **h\nearrow**
- **Shirley**: **HH**

### Correct Option:
The correct answer is **D**.

D: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: HH.
