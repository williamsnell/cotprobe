Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the setup is that a professor owns an apartment building in fee simple. He conveys it to his son and daughter as tenants in common. But in the deed, he reserved a life estate for himself. Then he told the kids and put the deed in the family vault. 

Next, the son marries a doctor, and the professor doesn't like her. So the professor executes a "correction deed," this time conveying the building to the son and daughter as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Again, he reserves a life estate. Both kids accept this new deed. Then, six months later, the son dies intestate, and the doctor is his sole heir. The question is, who holds title to the apartment building now?

Hmm. So I need to think about the effect of these deeds and the reservation of the life estate. 

First, the initial conveyance: the professor conveys to son and daughter as tenants in common, reserving a life estate. So, as a life estate, the professor has the right to use the property during his life, and upon his death, the remainder goes to the son and daughter as tenants in common. 

But then the professor creates a correction deed, which changes the joint tenancy. So now, son and daughter are joint tenants with right of survivorship. Both deeds have the professor reserving a life estate. 

Wait, but when the professor made the second deed, does that mean the first conveyance is revoked? Or does the second deed supersede the first? Because the second deed was accepted by both children, which suggests they agreed to it. So I think the second deed would replace the first one because it's a later conveyance and delivery was accepted.

So after the correction deed, the son and daughter hold the remainder as joint tenants. But remember, the professor still has a life estate. So during his life, he has the right to the property, and upon his death, it goes to the son and daughter as joint tenants.

Now, the son dies. Since the son and daughter were joint tenants with right of survivorship, the son's interest would pass to the daughter upon his death. So the daughter would own the entire remainder interest, but it's subject to the professor's life estate because the life estate is still in effect.

Wait, but the son died intestate. His wife, the doctor, is his sole heir. But because the son and daughter were joint tenants, the son's interest doesn't go through his estate. Instead, it goes directly to the daughter. So the doctor wouldn't inherit the son's share because the joint tenancy's right of survivorship takes precedence.

So putting it all together: the professor has a life estate, and the daughter owns the entire remainder. So when the professor dies, the daughter gets full ownership.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the daughter is the sole owner, subject to the professor's life estate. That fits because she has the remainder in fee simple, but the professor's life estate is still active.

Option B suggests the daughter and doctor as tenants in common, but the correction deed made them joint tenants, so the survivorship applies, and the doctor doesn't get anything.

Wait, but the professor reserved a life estate in both deeds. So the fee simple is divided into the professor's life estate and the remainder to the son and daughter (later as joint tenants). So when the son dies, his interest goes to the daughter, and the professor's life estate continues until his death.

So the current title is the professor has a life estate, and the daughter has the remainder as the sole owner now.

So the correct answer should be C: the daughter as the sole owner, subject to the professor's life estate.

The professor initially conveyed the apartment building to his son and daughter as tenants in common, reserving a life estate for himself. This meant the professor retained the right to use the property during his life, with the remainder interest passing to the son and daughter as tenants in common upon his death. 

Subsequently, the professor executed a "correction deed," changing the conveyance to joint tenants with the right of survivorship, while again reserving a life estate. Since both children accepted the correction deed, it superseded the initial conveyance. As a result, the son and daughter held the remainder interest as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate.

When the son died intestate, the right of survivorship in the joint tenancy ensured that the son's interest passed entirely to the daughter, and the doctor (as the son's heir) did not inherit any interest in the property. The professor's life estate remains in effect, meaning the daughter holds the sole remainder interest, but the professor retains the right to use the property during his lifetime.

Thus, the current title to the apartment building is held by the daughter as the sole owner, subject to the professor's life estate.
