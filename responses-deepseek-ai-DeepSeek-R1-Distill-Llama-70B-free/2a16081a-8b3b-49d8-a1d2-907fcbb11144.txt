Question:

Trace the development of aggression from infancy to adolescence.

G: Aggression only manifests in social settings and is not present in solitary behaviors
H: Aggression is mainly caused by parental behavior
I: Aggression emerges as a response to academic pressures during the school-age years and does not appear before this stage
J: Aggression is a result of an identity crisis during adolescence

Okay, so I've got this question about the development of aggression from infancy to adolescence. Hmm, I remember that aggression isn't something that just pops up out of nowhere. I think it starts early on.

Wait, when I was a kid, I saw toddlers having temper tantrums. That's probably a form of aggression, right? Like when they hit or scream because they can't get what they want. So in infancy, aggression might be more about emotional outbursts.

Then as children grow, their aggression changes. Maybe they start understanding more about social norms. Oh, parents and society influence this. Like, if parents model aggressive behavior, their kids might pick up on that. So during childhood, aggression becomes more complex. Instead of just tantrums, maybe they act out more intentionally or in more complex ways.

Moving on to adolescence, I guess the pressures from society and maybe more frustration come into play. Teens are dealing with school stress, peer pressure, identity issues, and all that. So their aggression could be more directed or maybe more calculated. It's not just random hitting anymore but could be verbal aggression or even more deliberate actions.

Looking at the options now. Option A says aggression only starts in adolescence. That doesn't sound right because I remember kids showing aggressive behaviors much younger. So A is probably wrong.

Option B talks about aggression starting in infancy with temper tantrums, influenced by parents and society, and then evolving into more complex forms later. That matches what I was thinking. Infancy starts with basic expressions, then it develops as the child grows.

Option C claims aggression is innate and doesn't change. But I know behavior can be influenced by environment, so C might not be correct because it says it doesn't develop over time.

Option D says aggression starts in middle childhood without prior signs. But we know babies and toddlers show aggressive behaviors, so D can't be right.

Option E says it's solely genetic. That's too narrow because environment definitely plays a role, so E is probably incorrect.

Option F attributes aggression only to peer interactions in early childhood. That's too limited because parents and other factors also influence it.

Option G says aggression only happens socially. But babies can be aggressive when they're alone, like hitting their toys, so G is wrong.

Option H says it's mainly caused by parents. While parents do influence, it's not the only factor. So H is too narrow.

Option I says aggression starts in school-age due to academic pressures. But again, aggression starts much earlier, so I is incorrect.

Option J links aggression to an identity crisis in adolescence. Maybe that's a part of it, but it's not the whole story, especially since aggression starts earlier.

So the best answer must be option B. It captures the development from infancy onwards, influenced by various factors, and evolving over time.

The development of aggression can be traced from infancy through adolescence, evolving in form and complexity. In infancy, aggression often manifests as temper tantrums, driven by emotional outbursts and frustration. As children grow, their aggression becomes more influenced by parental behavior and societal factors, taking on more intentional and complex forms. During adolescence, aggression may evolve further, shaped by increased societal pressures, frustration, and other developmental challenges. 

Option B accurately captures this progression, describing how aggression begins in infancy, is influenced by parental and societal factors, and evolves into more complex forms during childhood and adolescence.

Answer: B
