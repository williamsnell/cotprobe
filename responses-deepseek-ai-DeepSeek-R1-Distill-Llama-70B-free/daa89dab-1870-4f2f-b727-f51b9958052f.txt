Okay, so I've got this question about Butler and what he says is impossible. Let me think. I remember that Butler was a bishop and a philosopher, so his ideas are probably related to ethics or human nature. The question is about what's impossible according to him.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which action or state is impossible. I think Butler talked about conscience and self-love, maybe. Oh right, Butler's Sermons come to mind. He argued against Hobbes, I think, who said that humans are selfish. Butler said that humans have different instincts, including benevolence and conscience.

Wait, in his sermon, Butler said something about conscience being superior. So he might have said that you can't act against your conscience. Or maybe that you can't not approve of doing good. Hmm.

Looking at the options:

Option A: do that which is good and not approve of it. That sounds like if you do good, you have to approve it. Because Butler might say that our conscience makes us approve of good actions.

Option B: be motivated by genuine benevolence. Wait, I thought Butler said benevolence is a real motive, so maybe this isn't impossible. So B is possible, so the question is about something impossible. So B is not the answer.

Option C: approve of others' actions without understanding. Maybe possible, but not sure. Not sure if Butler addressed that.

Option D: act without self-interest. Wait, I thought Butler said that self-love and conscience are both part of human nature. But he might argue that you can act without selfishness, but I'm not sure if it's impossible to act without self-interest. Maybe he said that we always have some self-interest, but perhaps that's not the case. Hmm.

Option E: feel empathy without acting. I'm not sure. Maybe possible, but not directly related to Butler's main points.

Option F: approve without imitating. Maybe possible, so not the answer.

Option G: have morality without conscience. Butler probably said that conscience is essential for morality, so G would be impossible. But I'm not sure if that's the exact wording in the options.

Option H: act against societal norms. That seems possible, so not the answer.

Option I: do something you don't approve of. That sounds like it's possible, maybe even common, so not impossible.

Option J: perceive good without desiring it. That rings a bell. I think Butler said that when you see the good, you inherently desire it. So it's impossible to perceive the good without desiring it. So J would be impossible.

Wait, but wait. Earlier I thought about option A. If you do that which is good, can you not approve of it? I think Butler said that the conscience approves of good actions, so you can't do good and not approve. So A would be impossible.

Wait, but I'm getting confused between A and J. Let me try to recall. Butler's point about conscience: when you do something good, your conscience approves. So if you do a good action, you must approve of it. So A says it's impossible to do good and not approve, which aligns with that.

But then what about J: perceive the good without desiring it. I think that might be from a different philosopher, maybe Kant or someone else. I'm a bit shaky here.

Alternatively, I remember in Butler's ethics, he argues against the idea that self-love is the only motive. He believes in the possibility of disinterested benevolence. So option B says it's impossible to be motivated by genuine benevolence. But that can't be right because Butler supports benevolence as a real motive.

Wait, the question is about what's impossible. So if Butler says that you can't do good without approving, then A is impossible. Alternatively, if he says that perceiving good leads to desire, then J is impossible.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of Butler's actual statements. In Sermon I, he talks about the authority of conscience. He says that if someone does a good action, their conscience will approve. So if you do good, you can't not approve. So A is impossible.

As for J, I'm not sure. Maybe that's more of a Stoic idea, or perhaps from another philosopher. So I'm leaning towards A as the correct answer because it directly relates to conscience approving good actions.

According to Butler, the question revolves around what he deems impossible. Butler, a philosopher known for his ethical theories, emphasized the role of conscience and self-love in human nature. He argued against Hobbes' view that humans are solely selfish, instead asserting that benevolence and conscience are integral to human behavior.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "Do that which is good and not approve of it." Butler believed that conscience inherently approves of good actions, making it impossible to do good without approval. This aligns with his ethical framework.
- **Option B**: "Be motivated by genuine benevolence." Butler supported benevolence as a real motive, so this is possible and not the answer.
- **Option C**: "Approve of the actions of others without understanding them." This is likely possible and not directly addressed by Butler as impossible.
- **Option D**: "Act without a sense of self-interest." Butler acknowledged self-love as part of human nature but did not claim it is impossible to act without self-interest.
- **Option E**: "Feel empathy without taking action." This is possible and not relevant to Butler's main points.
- **Option F**: "Approve of the actions of others without imitating them." This is possible and not the focus of Butler's impossibility.
- **Option G**: "Have a sense of morality without having a conscience." Butler likely viewed conscience as essential to morality, but this is not explicitly stated as impossible.
- **Option H**: "Act in ways that contradict societal norms." This is possible and not relevant to Butler's impossibility.
- **Option I**: "Do something of which one does not oneself approve." This is possible and common, so not the answer.
- **Option J**: "Perceive the good without desiring it." While this idea may resonate with other philosophers, Butler's focus was more on conscience approving good actions, making this less directly relevant.

The most consistent answer with Butler's views is **Option A**, as he emphasized that doing good inherently leads to approval through conscience.
