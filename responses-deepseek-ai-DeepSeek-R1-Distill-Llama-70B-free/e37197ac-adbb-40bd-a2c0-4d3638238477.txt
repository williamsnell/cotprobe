Okay, so I have this question about emission spectra of ions and hydrogen atoms. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that the emission spectrum has to do with the energy levels of electrons. So when electrons drop from higher energy levels to lower ones, they emit photons, and the wavelengths of those photons correspond to specific colors in the spectrum.

The question is about the doubly ionized lithium atom, Li++. Wait, doubly ionized means it's lost two electrons, right? So lithium normally has three electrons, I think. If it's Li++, it's lost two, so it has only one electron left. So Li++ is a hydrogen-like ion, meaning it has just one electron orbiting a nucleus. Oh, right, hydrogen-like ions have similar properties to hydrogen, but scaled based on their atomic number.

The atomic number Z for lithium is 3. So for hydrogen-like atoms, the energy levels are given by the formula E_n = - (Z² * R_H) / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. Oh wait, but I'm a bit confused. Hydrogen's emission spectrum is calculated using certain formulas, like the Rydberg formula which relates the wavelengths of the emitted photons to the energy levels.

The question says the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom, but all the wavelengths are something—either increased or decreased by a factor. I need to find what that factor is.

Wait, the emission spectrum's wavelengths depend on the energy differences. For hydrogen-like atoms, the wavelengths in the emission spectrum are inversely proportional to Z squared. Because the energy levels scale with Z squared, so the energy differences (which relate to photon energy and thus wavelength) would depend on Z². 

So the Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R_H (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where n₂ > n₁. For a hydrogen-like ion with charge Z, the formula becomes 1/λ = R_H * Z² (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). So the wavelengths for the ion would be 1/(Z²) times that of hydrogen. 

Wait wait, no. Because if the energy is proportional to Z², then the photon energy (E = hc/λ) would also be proportional to Z². So E ∝ Z² → (hc/λ) ∝ Z² → λ ∝ 1/Z². So the wavelengths of the emission lines for Li++ would be shorter than those of hydrogen by a factor of Z squared. Since Z for Li is 3, the wavelengths would be 1/9 as long—so each wavelength is decreased by a factor of 9 compared to hydrogen.

But wait the question says the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... Wait, no, the question states that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom where the wavelengths are scaled by a certain factor. Or wait, no, the question says, the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... So, perhaps I'm getting it reversed.

Wait, no, the question is asking about the hydrogen atom's wavelengths. So the Li++ has wavelengths that are scaled. So let's think: Li++ has Z=3. So its emission lines have wavelengths that are (1/3²) times those of hydrogen. So if the Li++ spectrum is the same as a hydrogen spectrum where all wavelengths are scaled by a factor, then what factor would make the hydrogen wavelengths match Li++?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the Rydberg constant. The Rydberg constant R for a hydrogen-like atom is R = R_H * Z², where R_H is for hydrogen. So for Li++, R_Li = R_H * 3² = 9 R_H. Then the Rydberg formula for Li++ would be 1/λ = 9 R_H (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). For hydrogen, it's 1/λ_H = R_H (same terms in n). So 1/λ_Li = 9 (1/λ_H) → λ_Li = λ_H / 9. So the wavelengths of Li++ are 1/9 of hydrogen's.

But the question is phrased differently. It says the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom where all wavelengths are... So if Hydrogen's wavelengths are scaled by a certain factor, they would match Li++. For example, if in the hydrogen case, all wavelengths were multiplied by 9, then 1/λ_H' = (1/λ_Li) → λ_H' = λ_Li * 9. So the hydrogen atom's wavelengths are longer, so in the hydrogen spectrum, each wavelength is 9 times longer than in Li++.

But wait, the question says that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... So the Li++ spectrum is the same as a hydrogen spectrum where the hydrogen's wavelengths are scaled by a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it another way. Suppose for a certain transition in Li++, the wavelength emitted is λ_Li. For the same transition (same n₁ and n₂), the hydrogen atom would have λ_H. If Li++ has a higher Z, the energy levels are more tightly bound, so the energy difference is higher, leading to shorter wavelengths. So λ_Li = λ_H / Z².

So in the question, the Li++ spectrum is identical to the hydrogen's, but the hydrogen's wavelengths are scaled. So if the hydrogen's wavelengths are scaled by a factor of 9, then the Li++ would match. Wait, maybe I'm getting this reversed.

The question is, the Li++ spectrum is identical to that of a hydrogen atom where all wavelengths are ... So for each line in Li++, there's a corresponding line in the hydrogen atom, but scaled. So for Li++: λ_Li = λ_H' , and λ_H' is the scaled version. So what is the relationship between λ_H' and λ_H?

Wait, let me think again. The Li++ has Z=3, so its emission lines are at wavelengths λ_Li = λ_H / Z², because λ is inversely proportional to Z². So λ_Li = λ_H /9.

So, the emission lines of Li++ are at 1/9 the wavelength of hydrogen's. So if you have a hydrogen atom whose emission wavelengths are all increased by a factor of 9, then its spectrum would match Li++? Wait no, because Hydrogen's wavelengths are longer, so if you decrease them by 9 times, you get Li++. Or wait, no, if you take the hydrogen wavelengths and make them 9 times longer, then they would correspond to the Li++ which are shorter.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about it in terms of scaling. If the Li++ spectrum is identical to a hydrogen spectrum where all wavelengths are scaled by a factor. So, for example, if the scaled hydrogen has a wavelength λ', then λ' = λ_Li. So what's λ_Li in terms of λ_H?

From before, λ_Li = λ_H / Z². So λ' = λ_H / 9.

But the question is about the hydrogen atom's wavelengths being scaled. So the hydrogen atom's original wavelengths are λ_H, and when scaled by a factor, become λ'. So in this case, λ' = λ_Li = λ_H /9. So the scaling factor is 1/9, meaning the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9. So the hydrogen in the question has its wavelengths decreased by 9 times to match Li++. 

Wait, but the question is phrased as the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... So if the hydrogen's wavelengths are all, say, multiplied by a factor, then the spectrum would match Li++. So if λ' is the scaled hydrogen wavelength, and λ_Li = λ', then λ' = λ_H * factor.

Wait, but from earlier, λ_Li = λ_H /9 → λ_H = 9 λ_Li. So if the hydrogen's wavelengths are 9 times longer than Li++'s. So for the hydrogen's spectrum to be the same as Li++'s, the hydrogen's wavelengths must be 9 times shorter. Or wait, no, because if Li++ has shorter wavelengths, then to make the hydrogen's wavelengths match, you need to make them shorter by a factor of 9.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this with specific transitions. Let's say in hydrogen, the transition from n=2 to n=1 emits a photon with wavelength λ_H. In Li++, the same transition would emit a photon with λ_Li = λ_H / Z² = λ_H /9.

So the Li++ spectrum has lines at λ_Li = λ_H /9. So the question says this Li++ spectrum is identical to the hydrogen spectrum when the hydrogen's wavelengths are scaled by a certain factor. So we can imagine that Li++'s spectrum matches a hydrogen spectrum where the hydrogen's wavelengths are scaled such that each λ' = λ_H * factor.

Wait, no. Let me think: the question is saying that the Li++ spectrum is the same as a hydrogen spectrum, but the hydrogen's wavelengths have been modified by a factor.

So in other words, the Li++'s spectrum is identical to a certain hydrogen spectrum. So what's the relationship between the hydrogen's original spectrum and the modified one.

Wait, perhaps the Li++'s spectrum (λ_Li) is the same as the modified hydrogen spectrum (λ'_H). So λ_Li = λ'_H.

But λ_Li is equal to λ_H / Z². So λ'_H = λ_H /9 → λ'_H = (1/9) λ_H.

So for the hydrogen atom's spectrum, all the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9. So the correct answer would be that the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9.

Looking at the options, option I is "decreased by a factor of 9". So the answer should be I.
</think>

The emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom (Li++, Z = 3) is identical to that of a hydrogen atom, but the wavelengths are scaled due to the difference in atomic number. For hydrogen-like atoms, the wavelengths of emitted photons are inversely proportional to the square of the atomic number, \( Z^2 \). This relationship arises because the energy levels of such atoms scale as \( Z^2 \), and the energy of emitted photons (\( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)) is directly proportional to the energy difference between levels.

For Li++, the wavelengths of the emission spectrum are given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{Li++}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{H}}}{Z^2}
\]

Substituting \( Z = 3 \), we find:

\[
\lambda_{\text{Li++}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{H}}}{9}
\]

This means that the wavelengths of the emission spectrum of Li++ are shorter than those of hydrogen by a factor of 9. The question asks how the wavelengths of a hydrogen atom would need to be scaled to match the emission spectrum of Li++. To make the hydrogen spectrum identical to that of Li++, the wavelengths of hydrogen would need to be decreased by a factor of 9.

Thus, the correct answer is that the wavelengths of the hydrogen atom are decreased by a factor of 9.
