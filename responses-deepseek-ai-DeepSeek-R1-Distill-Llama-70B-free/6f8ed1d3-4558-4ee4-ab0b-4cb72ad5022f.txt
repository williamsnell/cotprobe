Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x³ + 2x = 10. I'm supposed to use the Newton-Raphson method. Hmm, I remember that Newton-Raphson is an iterative method to find roots of a function. Right, so first I need to rewrite the equation in terms of f(x) = 0.

So, subtracting 10 from both sides gives me f(x) = x³ + 2x - 10. I need to find the value of x where f(x)=0.

The Newton-Raphson formula is x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f’(x_n). So I need to compute the derivative of f(x). The derivative f’(x) would be 3x² + 2, since the derivative of x³ is 3x² and the derivative of 2x is 2. The derivative of a constant like -10 is zero.

Now, I have to choose an initial guess, x_0. Since I don't have any information about where the root might be, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's think about the function f(x)=x³+2x-10. When x=2, f(2)=8 +4 -10=2. So f(2)=2, which is positive. What about x=1? f(1)=1 +2 -10= -7, which is negative. So between 1 and 2, the function goes from negative to positive, which means by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root between 1 and 2.

Wait, let me check another value. How about x=1.5? Let's calculate f(1.5). 1.5³ is 3.375, 2*1.5 is 3, so 3.375+3=6.375. 6.375-10= -3.625. So f(1.5)= -3.625. That's still negative. So the root is between 1.5 and 2.

Alternatively, trying x=1.8: 1.8³ is about 5.832, 2*1.8=3.6. So 5.832+3.6=9.432. 9.432-10= -0.568. Still negative. So between 1.8 and 2.

x=1.9: 1.9³ is 6.859, 2*1.9=3.8. Sum is 10.659. Minus 10 is 0.659. Positive. So the root is between 1.8 and 1.9.

Hmm. So maybe I can start with x0=1.8 as the initial guess. Alternatively, since f(1.8) is -0.568 and f(1.9)=0.659, the root is around there.

Wait, let me think about the Newton-Raphson steps. Let's pick x0=2.0 as the initial guess. Let's see what happens.

Wait, no, if I start with x0=2, f(x0)=2, as I calculated earlier. Then, f’(x0)=3*(2)^2 +2= 12+2=14. So the next iteration would be x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f’(x0) = 2 - (2)/14 = 2 - 0.142857 ≈ 1.85714.

Wait, so that's x1≈1.8571. Let me compute f(1.8571). Let's see: (1.8571)^3 + 2*(1.8571) -10.

Calculating 1.8571^3: 1.8571 * 1.8571 = approx 3.449, then 3.449 *1.8571 ≈ about 6.406. Then 2*1.8571=3.7142. So 6.406 +3.7142=10.1202. 10.1202-10=0.1202. So f(x1)=~0.1202.

Then f’(x1) is 3*(1.8571)^2 +2. Let's compute 1.8571^2=3.449, so 3*3.449=10.347, plus 2 is 12.347.

So x2 = x1 - f(x1)/f’(x1) = 1.8571 - (0.1202)/(12.347). Let's compute that denominator: 12.347. So 0.1202/12.347≈0.00973. So x2 ≈1.8571 - 0.00973≈1.8474.

Now compute f(x2)= (1.8474)^3 + 2*(1.8474) -10.

1.8474^3: Let's compute 1.8^3 is 5.832, 0.0474^3 is negligible, but to be precise, perhaps calculate it step by step.

Wait, 1.8474 *1.8474 = let's compute it as (1.8 +0.0474)^2= 1.8^2 + 2*1.8*0.0474 + (0.0474)^2= 3.24 + 0.17136 + 0.00225= ≈3.41361.

Then multiply by 1.8474: 3.41361 *1.8474. Hmm, that's a bit involved. Let's approximate:

3 * 1.8474 =5.5422,

0.41361 *1.8474 ≈ around 0.764.

So total is about 5.5422 +0.764≈6.306.

So 1.8474^3≈6.306.

Then, 2*1.8474=3.6948.

So 6.306 +3.6948=9.9998. Approximately 10. So f(x2)=9.9998 -10≈-0.0002. Wait, that's close to zero but a bit negative.

Wait, maybe my approximation of 1.8474^3 is off. Let me compute it more accurately.

1.8474^3: 

First, compute 1.8474 *1.8474.

Let me do it step by step:

1.8474 × 1.8474:

Calculate 1 × 1.8474 = 1.8474

0.8 ×1.8474 = 1.47792

0.04 ×1.8474=0.073896

0.0074 ×1.8474≈0.013656

Add them together: 1.8474 +1.47792=3.32532 +0.073896=3.4, plus 0.013656 is 3.413976.

So square is ~3.41398.

Then multiply by 1.8474:

3.41398 *1.8474.

Break it down:

3 *1.8474=5.5422

0.41398 *1.8474 ≈ let's compute:

0.4 *1.8474=0.73896

0.01398 *1.8474≈0.0258.

So 0.73896 +0.0258=0.76476.

So total is 5.5422 + 0.76476=6.30696.

So 1.8474^3≈6.30696.

Then, 2 *1.8474=3.6948.

So f(x)=6.30696 +3.6948 =9.99976.

So f(x2)=9.99976 -10 = -0.00024. Wait, that's a little below zero. So f(x2)≈-0.00024, which is very close to zero, but slightly negative.

Now, compute f’(x2)=3*(1.8474)^2 +2.

We already found (1.8474)^2≈3.41398.

So 3 *3.41398=10.24194. Add 2: 12.24194.

So f’(x2)=12.24194.

Now, compute the next iteration x3 = x2 - f(x2)/f’(x2).

f(x2)= -0.00024.

So x3=1.8474 - (-0.00024)/12.24194.

Which is 1.8474 + (0.00024/12.24194).

Compute 0.00024 /12.24194 ≈ 0.0000196.

So x3≈1.8474 +0.0000196≈1.8474196.

So that's about 1.8474, which is option B.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 1.8474. So that must be the correct answer.

But wait, I started with x0=2, but perhaps I should have started with x0=1.8 or another value. Let me see.

Alternatively, if I started with x0=1.9, let's see what happens.

Wait, but in the first iteration, when I used x0=2, I got x1=1.8571, then x2=1.8474, and then x3≈1.8474 again, so it's converged.

Alternatively, if I took x0=1.8, let's see.

f(1.8)= (1.8)^3 +2*1.8 -10= 5.832 +3.6=9.432 -10= -0.568.

f’(1.8)=3*(1.8)^2 +2= 3*3.24=9.72 +2=11.72.

x1 =1.8 - (-0.568)/11.72 =1.8 +0.568/11.72≈1.8 +0.0485≈1.8485.

Wait, that's close to 1.8474. Then, f(x1)=?

Compute f(1.8485)= (1.8485)^3 + 2*(1.8485) -10.

Compute 1.8485^3: Let me compute 1.84^3 = approx 1.84*1.84=3.3856; 3.3856*1.84≈ 6.23.

Wait, but let me be more precise.

1.8485^3:

1.8485 *1.8485 = ?

Let me compute 1.8485 *1.8485.

1.8 *1.8=3.24.

1.8 *0.0485=0.0873.

0.0485 *1.8=0.0873.

0.0485 *0.0485≈0.00235.

So adding all: 3.24 + 0.0873 +0.0873 +0.00235= 3.24 +0.1746 +0.00235≈3.417.

So square is ~3.417.

Now multiply by 1.8485: 3.417 *1.8485.

Compute 3 *1.8485=5.5455.

0.417 *1.8485: 0.4 *1.8485=0.7394; 0.017*1.8485≈0.03144. So total≈0.77084.

So 5.5455 +0.77084≈6.3163.

So 1.8485^3≈6.3163.

Then 2 *1.8485=3.697.

So f(x1)=6.3163 +3.697=9.1013? Wait, no, wait, 6.3163 +3.697=9.1013? No, wait, 6.3163 +3.697=9.1013? Oh wait, wait, 6.3163 +3.697=9.1013? Hmm, no, 6.3163+3.697=9.1013? Wait, 6+3=9, 0.3163+0.697=1.0133. So total 10.0133. Then 10.0133 -10=0.0133. So f(x1)=0.0133.

Wait, that's a positive value. So f(x1)=0.0133, which is very close to zero.

Compute f’(x1)=3*(1.8485)^2 +2.

(1.8485)^2 is approx 3.417 as before. So 3*3.417=10.251, plus 2 is 12.251.

So x2 =x1 - f(x1)/f’(x1) =1.8485 - (0.0133)/12.251≈1.8485 -0.001086≈1.8474.

So again, we reach x2≈1.8474, which is option B.

So the answer is B:1.8474.

To solve the equation \( x^3 + 2x = 10 \) using the Newton-Raphson method, we first rewrite it as \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x - 10 \). The goal is to find the root of \( f(x) = 0 \). The Newton-Raphson formula is:

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
\]

Here, \( f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2 \). We start with an initial guess \( x_0 \). By evaluating \( f(x) \) at several points, we determine that the root lies between \( x = 1.8 \) and \( x = 2 \), as \( f(1.8) < 0 \) and \( f(2) > 0 \). Choosing \( x_0 = 2 \) as the initial guess:

1. Compute \( f(2) = 2^3 + 2(2) - 10 = 8 + 4 - 10 = 2 \) and \( f'(2) = 3(2)^2 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14 \).  
   \[
   x_1 = 2 - \frac{2}{14} = 2 - 0.142857 \approx 1.8571
   \]

2. Compute \( f(1.8571) = (1.8571)^3 + 2(1.8571) - 10 \approx 6.406 + 3.7142 - 10 = 0.1202 \) and \( f'(1.8571) = 3(1.8571)^2 + 2 \approx 10.347 + 2 = 12.347 \).  
   \[
   x_2 = 1.8571 - \frac{0.1202}{12.347} \approx 1.8571 - 0.00973 \approx 1.8474
   \]

3. Compute \( f(1.8474) = (1.8474)^3 + 2(1.8474) - 10 \approx 6.30696 + 3.6948 - 10 = -0.00024 \) and \( f'(1.8474) = 3(1.8474)^2 + 2 \approx 12.24194 \).  
   \[
   x_3 = 1.8474 - \frac{-0.00024}{12.24194} \approx 1.8474 + 0.0000196 \approx 1.8474
   \]

At this point, the iterations have converged to \( x \approx 1.8474 \). This matches option **B**.

Answer: B
