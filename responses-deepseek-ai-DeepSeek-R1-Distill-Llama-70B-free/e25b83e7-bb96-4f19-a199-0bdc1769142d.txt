Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the percentage of people in Ethiopia who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013. The options are A through J, each with different percentages. I'm not exactly sure about the exact figure, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that Afrobarometer conducts surveys across African countries, including Ethiopia. They ask various questions about governance, corruption, and political opinions. So it's possible this data comes from such a survey.

I think corruption is a significant issue in many African countries, including Ethiopia. So the percentage is probably higher than 50% but I'm not certain. Let's consider the options: A is 44%, which is less than half. B is 34%, which seems low. C is 74%, D is 4% which is way too low, E is 54%, F is 84%, G is 64%, H is 24%, I is 94%, and J is 14%.

Wait, 94% seems extremely high. I doubt it's that high, maybe in some countries, but Ethiopia might not be at that level. Similarly, 84% is also quite high. 74% and 64% are also possible. 

I recall that in some Afrobarometer reports, around 2013, Ethiopia's corruption perception wasn't the worst but still significant. For example, in some East African countries, the figures can range between 50% to 70%. So 74% could be plausible, but I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: I think that in 2013, Ethiopia was under the EPRDF coalition, which had been in power for a long time. There might have been some dissatisfaction regarding governance and corruption, which could translate to higher percentages.

Wait, I'm trying to remember if I've seen any specific data points. I think in some reports, around 70% of Ethiopians viewed political parties as corrupt. So that would point towards option C, 74%. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it could be 64%, which is option G.

Hmm, maybe I should think about other similar countries. For example, in Kenya around that time, corruption perceptions were quite high. But Ethiopia's situation might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the figure was around 70%, making C the right choice.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another country. Wait, I think I remember a specific figure for Ethiopia being 74%. So I'm leaning towards option C.

The answer is based on considering Afrobarometer survey data and the context of Ethiopia's political climate in 2013. Given the significant governance issues and corruption perceptions, the figure likely falls in the higher range. After evaluating the options, 74% (option C) seems plausible.
