Okay, so I have this question about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I've heard about this before in psychology class, but I need to make sure I get the details right. Let me think.

The question is asking what motivates each person according to Maslow's theory. The options are A through J.

From what I remember, Maslow's hierarchy is like a pyramid with different levels of needs. The basic idea is that people are motivated to fulfill their lower-level needs before moving on to higher ones. So the first level is physiological needsâ€”like food, water, shelter. Then comes safety, then love and belonging, then esteem, and finally self-actualization.

Wait, but what's the core idea here? The theory says that people are motivated by unsatisfied needs. So once a lower need is met, they move up to the next. The top of the pyramid is self-actualization, which is about realizing one's potential and personal growth.

Looking at the options now. Option B says "striving for self-actualization and personal growth." That sounds like the top level, but is that the only motivator? No, because people start with the lower needs first. So option B is part of it but not the whole picture.

Option J says "satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy." Hmm, that might make sense. Because once one level is satisfied, the person is motivated by the next higher need. So the motivation comes from the next step they're trying to reach.

Wait, but the question is about what each person is motivated by. So the hierarchy implies that they're motivated to move up the steps. So each person is motivated by the next level of needs that aren't yet satisfied.

Option B is about self-actualization, which is the highest need, but not everyone is at that stage. So the general theory is that people are motivated by the next unmet need in the hierarchy.

Wait, but the question is about the theory in general. So according to Maslow, each person is motivated by their need to move up the hierarchy. So the correct answer would be that they're motivated by the next step in the hierarchy.

Looking back at the options, option J says "satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy." That seems to fit because each person is driven by the unmet needs in the next level once the current level is satisfied.

Wait, but another option is B. So if the question is about what they're motivated by, it's the striving for self-actualization. But that's just the top. The hierarchy includes all levels. So the motivation is to satisfy the needs in order, moving up each step.

So for example, someone who hasn't fulfilled their safety needs isn't motivated by esteem needs yet. So the motivation is the next step they're trying to reach.

So in that case, the answer would be J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another thought: the primary motivator is the need to fulfill the next step. So yes, J makes sense.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option B is striving for self-actualization, which is part of the theory. But the question is about each person's motivation according to the hierarchy. So it's not just about self-actualization, but the process of moving through the hierarchy.

So the correct answer is J: satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy.

Wait, but another angle: Maslow's theory is that people are motivated by the desire to satisfy their needs, starting from the lowest to the highest. So each person is motivated by the next need in the hierarchy. So the answer is J.

But I'm a bit torn because B is also a key part of the theory. But the question says 'theorizes that each person is motivated by what?' So each person is motivated by the next level. So J is more accurate.

The question asks about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and what motivates each person according to his theory. Maslow's hierarchy is structured as a pyramid, with lower-level needs (physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem) needing to be fulfilled before individuals can focus on higher-level needs like self-actualization. The theory suggests that people are motivated by the desire to satisfy their unmet needs, progressing from the lowest to the highest level.

Option B highlights self-actualization and personal growth, which is the highest level of the hierarchy. However, this is only part of the theory, as motivation also involves progressing through the lower levels first. Option J states that motivation comes from satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy, which aligns with the idea that individuals are driven to fulfill their unmet needs in sequential order. This makes J the most accurate answer, as it captures the broader mechanism of motivation across the entire hierarchy.

Answer: J
