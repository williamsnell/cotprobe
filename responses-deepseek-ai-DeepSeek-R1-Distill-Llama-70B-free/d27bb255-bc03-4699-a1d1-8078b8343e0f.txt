Question:

An employee wdrked as a delivery person for a drugstore. As part of the employee's duties and responsibilities, he would regularly deliver prescriptions and other items (such as toiletries, cosmetics, vitamins, and gift products) to customers. One afternoon while the employee was on duty, he remembered that it was his girlfriend's birthday. He went ahead and bought her a bottle of perfume from the pharmacy's cosmetics department. The employee paid the full price of $79. 95 for the perfume and had the perfume gift wrapped. He then drove to the girlfriend's house in the company van to personally deliver the birthday present. This trip took place during the employee's regular working hours while he was en route to make another delivery from his van. As he was traveling to the girlfriend's house, he was in such a hurry that he drove through a red light and collided with a vehicle owned and operated by a driver. The driver, who had entered the intersection on the green light, tried unsuccessfully to swerve and stop but was unable to avoid the employee's vehicle. The driver was injured in the accident, which caused extensive damage to both vehicles. If the driver brings suit against the drugstore to recover damages arising from the accident, the driver will probably

Options:

A: prevail, because the employee was using the company van at the time of the accident.
B: not prevail, because the employee paid for the perfume with his own money.
C: prevail, because the driver had the right of way at the time of the accident.
D: prevail, because the employee was under the control and direction of the drugstore at the time of the accident.
E: not prevail, because the employee was personally responsible for the accident.
F: not prevail, because the drugstore did not directly cause the accident.
G: not prevail, because the drugstore was not negligent in hiring the employee.
H: prevail, because the employee was on duty at the time of the accident.
I: not prevail, because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.
J: prevail, because the employee paid for the perfume.

Okay, so I've got this question here about employment law and vicarious liability. Hmm, I remember that vicarious liability is when an employer is held responsible for the actions of an employee performed within the scope of their employment. Let me break down the scenario.

The employee is a delivery person for a drugstore. His job is to deliver prescriptions and other items. One day, during work hours, he buys a perfume for his girlfriend's birthday. He pays full price, gets it gift-wrapped, and then drives the company van to her house to deliver it. But he does this while on his delivery route. On the way, he runs a red light and crashes into another driver who had the green light. The driver gets injured and sues the drugstore.

The question is whether the driver can successfully sue the drugstore. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

So, the key here is whether the employee was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident happened. If he was, the employer is liable. If not, the employer isn't.

The employee was on duty, using the company van, and during working hours. But he was delivering a personal gift, not something related to his job. Wait, but he was en route to another delivery. So he was supposed to be making deliveries as part of his job, but he took a detour to deliver the perfume to his girlfriend.

I think the main issue is whether this personal errand falls within the scope of his employment. Normally, if an employee is doing something personal and it's not for the employer's benefit, the employer might not be liable. But sometimes, if the errand is minor or if the employer allows personal use of the vehicle, the employer might still be liable.

In this case, the employee was using the van to make a delivery for work, but he also used it to deliver the perfume. So is the accident happening during a work-related activity or a personal one?

Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the employer is liable if the employee's actions were within the scope of employment. Scope includes duties the employee is hired to perform, and sometimes minor deviations (like a frolic) might still be within scope if they're not entirely personal.

Wait, but in this case, the employee was on his way to make another delivery. He took a detour to deliver the perfume. So was this detour within the scope of his duties?

I think it's a question of whether the errand was incidental to his job duties. If the employer allows some personal use, or if the errand doesn't take him completely away from his duties, the employer might still be liable.

Also, the fact that he was delivering the perfume while on his delivery route might mean that the errand was done in the course of his duties. It's a bit of a grey area, but I think the court would consider whether the employee's actions were reasonably related to his job.

In some cases, using a company vehicle for personal errands while on the job can still fall within the scope of employment, especially if the employer permits it or if it's a minor detour. If the employee was authorized to use the van for such purposes, then the employer could be liable.

So looking at the options:

A: Prevail because he used the company van. That's a point, but using the van alone isn't enough if the use was outside the scope.

C: Prevail because the driver had the right of way. That's about the accident itself, not the employer's liability.

D: Prevail because under the employer's control. That's more about the employer-employee relationship, which exists, but the key is the scope.

H: Prevail because on duty. Similar to A and D.

I: Not prevail because acting outside scope. That's the opposite.

Wait, in the scenario, the employee was on duty, driving the company van, but delivering a personal item. So was he acting within the scope?

I think the key is that he was combining a personal errand with a work duty. Courts sometimes find that if the errand is done in the course of employment, even if it's personal, the employer can be liable, especially if it's a minor deviation.

Alternatively, if the errand is entirely personal and unrelated to work, the employer isn't liable. Here, delivering the perfume isn't part of his job duties, but he was using the van during work hours and on his delivery route.

So perhaps the court would find that he was within the scope because he was using the van for a delivery, even if it was a personal one. Or maybe it's considered a detour that's a minor deviation, so within scope.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the factors. The employee was on his way to make another delivery, so the trip to his girlfriend's house was a detour. But he was using the van as he would for deliveries. So the employer might still be liable because the use of the van was within the scope of his job.

So the correct answer would be that the driver prevails because the employee was acting within the scope. So which option says that?

Looking at the options:

A: Prevail because using company van. That's a factor, but not the only one.

D: Prevail because under control. Again, part of it, but the real issue is scope.

H: Prevail because on duty. Same reasoning.

I: Not prevail because outside scope.

Wait, another angle: the employee was delivering a personal item, so that's a personal errand. Courts have held that when an employee is on a personal errand during work, if it's entirely personal and not for the employer's benefit, the employer isn't liable. But if the errand is incidental or if the employer allows it, then maybe.

In this case, the employee was delivering a gift he purchased, so it's a personal errand. But he was doing it while on his delivery route. So is this a deviation from his job duties?

I think the key is whether the errand was within the scope. If the errand was not part of his job, then the employer might not be liable. So in this case, delivering the perfume wasn't part of his job duties. His job was to deliver prescriptions and items to customers as part of his work, not personal gifts.

So even though he was on duty and using the van, the purpose of the trip was personal, not work-related. Therefore, he was acting outside the scope of his employment, so the employer isn't liable.

So the correct answer would be I: not prevail because outside scope.

Wait, but some cases say that if the employee is using the vehicle provided by the employer for a purpose that's within the scope, even if it's a personal errand, the employer might still be liable. For example, if the employee is allowed to use the vehicle for commuting, but in this case, it's during work hours and while making deliveries.

I'm a bit torn. But I think the majority view is that if the errand is personal and not for the employer's benefit, the employer isn't liable. So the driver wouldn't prevail against the drugstore because the employee was outside the scope.

So the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the driver can hold the drugstore liable for the accident caused by the employee. The key issue is whether the employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. Vicarious liability applies when an employee's actions are within the scope of their employment, meaning the actions are reasonably related to the job duties or are incidental to them.

In this case, the employee was on duty, using the company van, and during working hours. However, he was delivering a personal gift (perfume) to his girlfriend, which is not part of his job duties. While he was en route to another delivery, the detour to deliver the perfume was a personal errand and not for the employer's benefit. Courts generally find that personal errands, especially those unrelated to job duties, fall outside the scope of employment unless the employer explicitly allows such use of company resources.

Although the employee was using the company van and was on duty, the purpose of the trip was personal. Therefore, the employee was acting outside the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. As a result, the drugstore would not be liable for the accident under the doctrine of respondeat superior.

The correct answer is:

**I: not prevail, because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.**
