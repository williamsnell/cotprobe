Question:

A customer is suing a car dealer for selling him a salvaged vehicle that the car dealer had represented as being brand new. A few weeks before trial, the car dealer approached his sister and said, "Sis, I need some sympathy. I sold a salvaged vehicle to a customer, and now he's suing me. I didn't mean any harm by it. I inspected the vehicle and everything. " Unknown to either the car dealer or his sister, the sister's boyfriend was at the front door and overheard this conversation. When the time for trial came around, the car dealer left the country and refused to attend the trial, telling his attorney to handle it. The customer's attorney attempted several times to secure the car dealer's attendance at trial, but was unsuccessful. At trial, the sister's boyfriend is called to testify about the conversation he overheard. On objection by the car dealer's attorney, the court will most likely rule the testimony

Options:

A: admissible as a statement of intent.
B: inadmissible as it violates the defendant's right to confront the witness.
C: admissible as a declaration against interest.
D: admissible as a statement of present sense impression.
E: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
F: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
G: inadmissible as the statement was not made under oath.
H: inadmissible due to the absence of the defendant.
I: admissible as a statement of then-existing mental or emotional condition.
J: admissible as a spontaneous statement.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The scenario is about a car dealer who sold a salvaged car as new, and now the customer is suing him. Before the trial, the car dealer talks to his sister, telling her about selling the salvaged vehicle. The sister's boyfriend overhears this conversation. At trial, the car dealer doesn't show up, and the customer's attorney calls the boyfriend to testify about what he overheard.

The question is whether this testimony is admissible and under which exception, or if it's inadmissible because of some rule.

First, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the car dealer's statement to his sister is hearsay because it's being used to show he sold a salvaged car.

But there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. I need to think about which exception might apply here.

Let's go through the options:

Option A: Statement of intent. I think that applies when the statement shows the person's plan to do something. Here, the statement is about a past action (selling the car), not future intent, so maybe not A.

Option B: Confrontation Clause. The defendant's attorney is there, so the right to confrontation is satisfied. The issue isn't about cross-examining the witness because the defendant is absent. But wait, the defendant's absence might affect whether the statement can be used if it's hearsay. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this makes it inadmissible. I'll come back to this.

Option C: Declaration against interest. This exception applies when the statement is against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. Here, the car dealer admitted to selling a salvaged car, which could subject him to liability. So this could fit. But wait, the car dealer is the defendant, so his statement is against his own interest. So maybe C is a possibility.

Option D: Present sense impression. This is a statement made while perceiving an event or immediately after. The car dealer's statement was made a few weeks before trial, so maybe not immediate enough. Probably not D.

Option E: Hearsay not within exception. If none of the exceptions apply, then it's inadmissible. So if I don't think any of the other options apply, E would be correct.

Option F: Excited utterance. That requires the statement to be made under stress of a startling event. The car dealer was just talking to his sister, not in the stress of the event. So probably not F.

Option G: Not made under oath. But the sister's boyfriend is testifying, so the statement itself wasn't under oath. But the hearsay exception doesn't require the original statement to be under oath. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H: Absence of defendant. The defendant's absence might go to the Confrontation Clause, but generally, if the defendant doesn't show up, the trial can proceed without them, and their statements can still be used if they fit an exception. So H might not be the right reason for inadmissibility.

Option I: Existing mental or emotional condition. This applies to statements about the declarant's current feelings or thoughts. The car dealer's statement was about a past action, not his current state, so probably not I.

Option J: Spontaneous statement. Similar to excited utterance, requires spontaneity. The timing here is a few weeks before trial, so maybe not spontaneous enough.

Now, back to the options. The car dealer's statement to his sister is an admission by a party opponent. Wait, isn't that another exception? Oh, right! Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or the party himself. So the car dealer's statement would be an admission by a party opponent, making it admissible as non-hearsay.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Looking at the options, let me check again:

Option C is declaration against interest, which is another exception. But the admission by party opponent is a separate category, not an exception but an exemption from hearsay because it's defined as not hearsay.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that says "admissible as a party admission." So perhaps the correct answer is that it's hearsay but falls under an exception.

Wait, the sister's boyfriend is testifying about what he heard. The car dealer's statement was to his sister. The statement is being offered against the car dealer in a lawsuit. So under 801(d)(2), this is a statement by the party-opponent, so it's not hearsay at all. So it's admissible, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options:

The options are A-J. Option C is "declaration against interest." So the car dealer's statement is against his interest. But wait, he's saying he sold a salvaged car, which could expose him to liability. So it is a statement against interest. So under 804(b)(3), the declaration against interest exception applies, but only if the declarant is unavailable. Is the car dealer unavailable? He left the country and refused to attend. So he's unavailable as a witness.

Wait, but for the declaration against interest exception, the declarant must be unavailable. In this case, the car dealer is unavailable because he's not attending the trial. So his statement would qualify under the exception.

So option C would apply. But wait, earlier I thought it might be an admission by a party opponent, which is non-hearsay. So which is correct?

Wait, 801(d)(2) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or the party. So the car dealer is the party, so his statement is an admission by a party opponent and thus not hearsay. So it's admissible under that rule, not under an exception.

Looking back at the options, I don't see an option that refers to party admission. The options given are A-J. So perhaps the correct answer is that it's admissible as a statement against interest, option C.

Wait, but if it's an admission, it's not hearsay, so no exception is needed. So the testimony would be admissible as non-hearsay under 801(d)(2).

But looking at the options, the only option that would fit is either C or E. If it's non-hearsay, then it's admissible, so the hearsay objection would be overruled. But the options don't have an option for party admission, so perhaps the correct answer is E, inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

Wait, no. Because the statement is an admission by a party-opponent, so it's admissible. But the options don't have that as an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C is "declaration against interest." So if the statement is against the car dealer's interest, and he's unavailable, it would fit. But I'm a bit confused because the statement is being used against the car dealer, so it's both an admission and a declaration against interest. But which applies?

Wait, the declaration against interest applies when the statement is against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. The car dealer was telling his sister that he sold a salvaged car, which is against his interest because it's potentially illegal or gives rise to civil liability. So yes, it's a statement against interest.

But wait, the declaration against interest exception under 804(b)(3) requires that the declarant be unavailable. In this case, the car dealer is unavailable because he's not attending the trial. So the statement would qualify under that exception.

So the sister's boyfriend's testimony is admissible under the declaration against interest exception, making option C correct.

Alternatively, since it's an admission by a party opponent, it's not hearsay, so it's admissible. But I don't see an option that states that. The options only include C as a possible exception.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because the statement isn't covered by any exception. But that can't be right because either the admission or the declaration against interest would apply.

Wait, the car dealer is the defendant, so his statement is an admission. Therefore, under 801(d)(2), it's not hearsay. So the testimony would be admissible, and the objection would be overruled. But the options don't have an option that says it's admissible as a party admission.

Looking at the options again:

A: intent - no.

B: confrontation - probably not the issue.

C: declaration against interest - possible.

E: inadmissible as hearsay - but it's not hearsay if it's an admission.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The car dealer's statement is an admission by a party-opponent. Therefore, it's not hearsay. So the testimony is admissible, and the objection would be overruled. But looking at the options, none of them state that. So perhaps the correct answer is E, because the options don't include the admission exception.

Wait, no. Option C is about declaration against interest, which is a hearsay exception. But if the statement is admissible as non-hearsay (as an admission), then the exception isn't needed, making option E incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The sister's boyfriend is testifying to what the car dealer said. The statement is being offered to prove that the car dealer sold a salvaged car. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Possible exceptions: present sense impression (D), excited utterance (F), declaration against interest (C), or admission by party opponent.

If it's an admission by party opponent, it's not hearsay, so admissible. But the options don't have that. So maybe the answer is E.

Wait, but the options don't include an admission exception. So perhaps the correct answer is E, inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But wait, the statement could fall under declaration against interest.

Wait, the car dealer is the defendant, and his statement is against his interest. So if the statement is against his interest and he's unavailable, then it's admissible under the declaration against interest exception.

So the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if the statement is an admission, it's not hearsay, so admissible. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, but the sister's boyfriend is testifying. The statement was made a few weeks before trial, so the timing might not fit present sense impression or excited utterance.

So I think the correct answer is C: admissible as a declaration against interest.

Wait, but wait, the declaration against interest exception requires that the statement be against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. The car dealer's statement was against his interest because it could expose him to liability, so that fits.

But also, the car dealer is unavailable, so the exception applies. Therefore, the testimony is admissible under option C.

But I'm a bit confused because the statement is also an admission by a party opponent. So perhaps the better answer is that it's admissible as non-hearsay, but since that's not an option, I have to choose the best available.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement doesn't qualify as a declaration against interest because the car dealer didn't know he was making a statement against his interest. No, that's not necessary; it's enough that the statement was against his interest at the time.

So, I think the answer is C: admissible as a declaration against interest.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by the car dealer to his sister, which was overheard by her boyfriend. The statement is being offered into evidence at trial, and the issue is whether it qualifies as hearsay or falls under a recognized exception.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Hearsay Definition**: The car dealer's statement is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that he sold a salvaged vehicle as new). Therefore, it is hearsay unless an exception applies.

2. **Option A (Statement of Intent)**: This exception applies to statements showing the declarant's intent to act in the future. Here, the statement concerns a past action, not future intent, so this option does not apply.

3. **Option B (Confrontation Clause)**: The right to confront a witness is not violated here because the defendant's attorney is present at trial. The issue is not about confrontation but whether the statement is admissible as hearsay.

4. **Option C (Declaration Against Interest)**: Under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), a statement is admissible if it was against the declarant's interest at the time it was made and the declarant is unavailable. The car dealer's statement admitting to selling a salvaged vehicle exposes him to civil liability, making it against his interest. Additionally, the car dealer is unavailable because he left the country and refused to attend the trial. Thus, this exception applies.

5. **Option D (Present Sense Impression)**: This exception requires the statement to be made while the event was occurring or immediately after. The car dealer's statement was made weeks before trial, so it does not qualify as a present sense impression.

6. **Option E (Hearsay Not Within Any Exception)**: If no exception applies, the statement would be inadmissible. However, the statement qualifies under the declaration against interest exception, so this option is incorrect.

7. **Option F (Excited Utterance)**: This exception requires the statement to be made under the stress of a startling event. The car dealer's statement was made in a casual conversation with his sister, not under stress, so this option does not apply.

8. **Option G (Not Made Under Oath)**: The fact that the statement was not made under oath is irrelevant because hearsay exceptions do not require the original statement to be made under oath.

9. **Option H (Absence of the Defendant)**: The defendant's absence does not inherently render the statement inadmissible. The issue is whether the statement is hearsay or falls under an exception.

10. **Option I (Then-Existing Mental or Emotional Condition)**: This exception applies to statements about the declarant's current feelings or thoughts. The car dealer's statement was about a past action, not his mental state, so this option does not apply.

11. **Option J (Spontaneous Statement)**: Similar to the excited utterance exception, this requires spontaneity. The car dealer's statement was made weeks before trial, so it does not qualify as spontaneous.

### Conclusion:

The car dealer's statement qualifies as a declaration against interest under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) because it was against his interest at the time it was made, and he is unavailable to testify. Therefore, the testimony is admissible under this exception.
