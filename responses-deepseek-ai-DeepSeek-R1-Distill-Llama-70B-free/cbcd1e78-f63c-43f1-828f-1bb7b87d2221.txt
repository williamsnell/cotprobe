Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says two 30" plants are crossed, and their progeny have a specific ratio of heights. The heights range from 22" up to 38", and the numbers of each are given. The question is about determining the most probable genotypes of the parents, using letters A through J as options.

Hmm, so first, I remember that when plants are crossed, their progeny's traits depend on their genotypes. The ratio of the progeny can give clues about the genetic makeup of the parents. The classic example is the dihybrid cross, where a 9:3:3:1 ratio is expected if two parents are both AaBb.

Wait, but here, the ratio isn't a simple 9:6:1 or something; looking at the numbers: 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1. Oh, wait a second, that looks familiar. Let's see, 1 + 8 is 9, but wait, the numbers are 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, etc. Let me add them up. 1+8=9, +28=37, +56=93, +70=163, +56=219, +28=247, +8=255, +1=256. Oh, 256 total progeny. 256 is 4^4, which is 256. Because 4^4 is 256. So 256 progeny. So that suggests four genes, each with two alleles, perhaps.

Wait, the ratio of the offspring is 1:8:28:56:70:56:28:8:1. Oh, that's a 1-8-28-56-70-56-28-8-1 ratio. I think that's a pattern from a selfing or a cross that involves multiple genes. Let me think about the expansion of (a + b + c + d)^4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of each gene contributing to the phenotype, like a quantitative trait.

Wait, in a monohybrid cross, the ratio is 3:1. For dihybrid, it's 9:3:3:1. Trihybrid gives a 27:9:9:3:1 ratio... Wait no, that's for test crosses. Or maybe it's about the number of possible allele combinations.

Wait, another approach: each of these numbers corresponds to the number of plants with a certain phenotype, which relates to the number of possible genotypes. The maximum number is 70, which is in the middle. 70 is the highest, so that suggests it's the most common phenotype, perhaps the dominant or the most frequent combination.

Wait, but let me think about how the number of phenotypic classes relates to the number of genes. Each gene contributes to the phenotype. If you have two parents, each with some combination of alleles, their cross produces certain phenotypic ratios.

Looking at the ratio: 1,8,28,56,70,56,28,8,1. Let me see if this is a binomial expansion. Let's see, the coefficients for (a + b)^n: for n=0, it's 1. n=1: 1 1. n=2: 1 2 1. n=3: 1 3 3 1. n=4: 1 4 6 4 1. n=5: 1 5 10 10 5 1. Wait, but none of these match the given ratio.

Wait, but what if it's a trinomial expansion? Or maybe it's a product of multiple expansions. Oh, wait, perhaps each gene contributes in a way that the overall ratio is a product of their individual ratios.

Another thought: the numbers 1,8,28,56,70, etc., sum up to 256, which is 2^8. Hmm, maybe it's a cross involving four genes, each of which is heterozygous in both parents. Because each gene would produce a 1:2:1 ratio, and when you have four genes, the total number of phenotypes could be 3^4 = 81, but that's not matching the counts here.

Wait, but the specific numbers here: 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1. Let me count the number of terms. There are 9 terms, which is 3^2. So perhaps two genes, each with three alleles? No, that doesn't make sense because in typical Mendelian genetics, each gene has two alleles. Wait, unless it's a case of codominance or something else, but that's probably too complicated.

Wait, another approach: think about the parents. The parents are both 30". So their genotype would express 30" as the phenotype. The progeny have a range around 30", which includes both smaller and larger plants. So perhaps each parent is contributing some additive effect.

Wait, each inch could represent a certain number of alleles. Like, if there are four genes, each with two alleles (A and a, B and b, etc.), and each dominant allele contributes a certain value. For example, each dominant allele adds 2", and each recessive adds 0", so the total height is determined by the number of dominant alleles. Let's see:

If each gene contributes 2" when dominant, and 0" when recessive, then for four genes, the maximum would be 8" (if all are dominant). But wait, the plants are 30" tall, so maybe each gene contributes more, but the point is the additive effect.

Wait, perhaps each gene contributes a certain value. For example, if each dominant allele adds 4 inches, then each recessive adds 0. So for four genes, the maximum would be 16", but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps each adds 8", so max is 32" if all four are dominant, but the parents are 30", which is close to that. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but looking at the progeny, the tallest is 38". So if parents are 30", but their progeny can be up to 38, which is 8 inches taller. So perhaps each dominant allele adds 2 inches. Because then, two parents with, say, two dominant alleles each (each gene being Aa), their progeny could have more.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as each gene contributing a certain amount to the height, and the total height is the sum of all these contributions. So if each gene has two alleles, and each dominant allele contributes, say, x inches, and recessive contributes 0, then the total height would be the sum of their contributions.

So for two parents that are both 30", perhaps each contributes a certain number of dominant alleles. Let's say each parent is AaBbCcDd. So each gene is heterozygous. Then, each parent can produce gametes with different combinations of dominant and recessive alleles.

When these two parents are crossed, each gene would segregate according to Mendel's laws, resulting in F1 progeny with varying numbers of dominant alleles. The total height would be the sum of the contributions of each dominant allele.

Wait, but the parents are both 30", so perhaps each parent has two dominant alleles per gene? Let me think. If each dominant allele adds 2 inches, then for four genes, 4 * 2 = 8. But the parents are 30", so perhaps each gene contributes more.

Alternatively, perhaps each dominant allele contributes 8 inches. Wait, but that would make each gene worth 8", so with two dominant alleles, the plant would be 16". But the parents are 30", so maybe it's more than four genes.

Alternatively, perhaps the height is determined by multiple additive genes, each contributing a certain value. So if each of four genes contributes, say, 3 inches when dominant, and each parent is heterozygous for all four genes, their own height would be 4 * 1.5 * 2 = 12"? No, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps each gene contributes a certain amount. Let's model it. Let's assume that each gene has two alleles: one dominant (let's say, contributing +2") and recessive (0"). The parents are both 30". So, if each parent is AaBbCcDd (four genes, each heterozygous), then each parent would have, on average, two dominant alleles per gene, but no, wait: each heterozygous gene would contribute 2 inches (since Aa would give A 50% of the time, which is 2").

Wait, perhaps each gene contributes 6 inches. Because 30" divided by 5 genes would be 6 per gene. Wait, but 30/5 is 6, but the parents are 30", so maybe each has 5 dominant alleles, each contributing 6 inches. So 5 * 6 = 30. But then, their genotype would be AaBbCcDdEe, each heterozygous. Then, when crossed, their progeny would have varying numbers of dominant alleles.

Wait, but the number of phenotypic classes would be the number of different sums of dominant alleles. For five genes, each can be 0, 1, or 2 dominant alleles, but wait, no: each gene is a single locus. So each gene can contribute 0 (if aa), or 1 (if Aa or aA), but wait, no, in diploid organisms, each gene is two alleles. So for each gene, the possible contributions are 0 (recessive), 1 (heterozygous), or 2 (homozygous dominant). But in reality, if the parent is Aa, then the possible gametes contribute either A (dominant) or a (recessive). So each gene is either present as dominant or recessive in the gamete.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the progeny ratio. The ratio is 1:8:28:56:70:56:28:8:1. Let's see if this fits a known genetic ratio.

I remember that a cross between two triple heterozygotes (AaBbCc × AaBbCc) would produce a certain ratio. Let me recall: for three genes, each with independent assortment, each parent is AaBbCc. So each gamete has a 25% chance for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles.

The F1 would have varying numbers of dominant alleles. The possible phenotypic ratios would be... for each gene, a 3:1 ratio, but combined across three genes, it's a 27:9:9:3:1:1:1 ratio or something like that. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, but the given ratio has 9 terms, which is 3 squared. So perhaps two genes, each with three possible alleles. Wait, no, that's not typical. Alternatively, perhaps it's four genes, each with two alleles, but in a way that the number of possible dominant alleles sums up to a certain value.

Wait, another idea: the ratio 1:8:28:56:70:56:28:8:1 has 9 terms. 9 is 3^2, so perhaps it's the square of a trinomial. Wait, the expansion of (1 + 2 + 1)^2 is 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a product of two different binomial expansions. For example, (a + b)^2 * (c + d)^2, but that would give more terms.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two parents is trihybrid, being AaBbCc, and when crossed, their progeny have a 1:8:... ratio? No, I think that when two trihybrids are crossed, the F1 have a 1:6:15:20:15:6:1 ratio, but that's for a heptahybird cross, which doesn't seem to fit here.

Wait, perhaps the ratio here is a result of four genes each segregating in a 1:2:1 ratio. Because 4 genes, each with 3 possibilities, leading to 3^4 = 81 possible genotypes, but the phenotypic ratio is the sum of the probabilities. Wait, but the given ratio has only 9 terms, so perhaps it's a case of two genes, each with three phenotypic expressions. Or perhaps it's a case of each gene contributing to the phenotype in a way that the sum results in 9 phenotypic classes.

Wait, perhaps each parent is a dihybrid, and their cross results in a 1:8:28:56:70:56:28:8:1 ratio, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each of the parents is a trihybrid, and their cross produces this ratio.

Wait, another approach: the given ratio is symmetrical, which suggests that the parents are both the same genotype. Because if one parent is AABB and the other is aabb, the F1 would all be AaBb, so that's not this case. But here, the F1 has a range, so the parents must have been contributing different alleles.

Wait, the ratio 1:8:28:56:70:56:28:8:1. Let me think of the coefficients as the number of ways to achieve a certain sum. For example, in a binomial distribution, the coefficients are 1,4,6,4,1 for n=4. But here, the coefficients are larger. Wait, 1,8,28,56,70, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's the result of a cross where each parent is a quadruple heterozygote, like AaBbCcDd. So each gene is heterozygous, and when crossed with another AaBbCcDd, the progeny would have varying numbers of dominant alleles. The total number of possible phenotypes would be determined by the number of dominant alleles across the four genes.

Each gene can contribute 0, 1, or 2 dominant alleles. Wait, no: each gene has two alleles, so each can be homozygous dominant (2), heterozygous (1), or homozygous recessive (0). So for four genes, each with three possibilities, the total number of phenotypes would be 3^4 = 81, which is way more than the 9 observed. So perhaps each gene's contribution is additive, and the total is the sum of the dominant alleles.

Wait, but that would result in a range from 0 to 8, but the ratio here has 9 terms, which is 0 to 8, which makes sense. So the possible sums would be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So the coefficients in the ratio would correspond to the number of ways each sum can be achieved.

Wait, let's model this. Let's say each gene contributes 1 unit when dominant, and 0 when recessive. Then, the sum of four genes would range from 0 to 4, but our ratio here goes up to 8. So perhaps each gene has two alleles, and each dominant allele contributes 2 units. So each gene can contribute 0, 2, or 4 units. Then, the sum would range from 0 to 8, which matches the 9 terms in the ratio.

So each gene is heterozygous, so each parent is AaBbCcDd. Then, each gene can contribute 0 (aa), 2 (Aa), or 4 (AA) units. Wait, but the parents are both 30", which would be the sum of all their contributions. Let's say each parent has AaBbCcDd genotype, each gene being heterozygous, so each gene contributes 2 units. Then, each parent's total would be 4 genes * 2 units = 8 units, but the parents are 30". So perhaps each unit is 3.75 inches, but that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, each unit is 3.75 inches, 8 units would be 30". Hmm, maybe, but perhaps this is overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each dominant allele contributes 4 inches. So each heterozygous gene contributes 4 inches. So four genes would be 16 inches, but that's not matching the parent's height of 30". Alternatively, perhaps each gene contributes 7.5 inches. 4 * 7.5 is 30, which matches. So each dominant allele adds 7.5 inches. So when a plant is homozygous dominant (AA), it contributes 15 inches for that gene, heterozygous (Aa) 7.5, and recessive (aa) 0.

Wait, but that would make each parent's height 4 * 7.5 = 30", which matches. Then their progeny would have varying sums, which would lead to varying heights. Now, when two AaBbCcDd parents are crossed, their progeny would have genotypes that are combinations of these alleles.

The F1 phenotypic ratio would depend on the number of dominant alleles across all four genes. Let's think about the number of ways each possible total can occur. For each gene, the possible contributions are 0, 7.5, or 15 inches. Wait, but in reality, each gene's contribution is based on the number of dominant alleles. So each gene can contribute 0 (aa), 7.5 (Aa), or 15 (AA) inches. The total height is the sum across all four genes.

So the possible total heights would range from 0 (all aa) to 60 (all AA), but in this problem, the observed heights are from 22" to 38". So perhaps each gene contributes 5.5 inches, because 4 * 5.5 = 22, which is the shortest progeny. Wait, no, because the parents are 30", which would be 4 * 7.5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting into the weeds here.

Alternatively, perhaps each gene contributes 8 inches when dominant. So each Aa parent would have two dominant alleles, giving 16 inches. Wait, but 4 * 8 is 32, which is higher than 30". Hmm, maybe each dominant allele contributes 3.75 inches. So 4 * 3.75 = 15, but that's not matching the parents' 30". Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the height is determined by the number of dominant alleles, regardless of the specific gene. So each dominant allele adds a
