Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating how much money needs to be deposited for 3 months at a 3% annual interest rate to earn $11.25 in interest. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the formula given is I = P * r * t. I remember that I stands for interest, P is principal (the initial amount), r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time in years. Right, so I need to find P when I is $11.25, r is 3%, and t is 3 months. Wait, 3 months is a quarter of a year, so t would be 0.25 years, I think.

So let's plug in the values we have into the formula. I is 11.25, r is 0.03 (because 3% as a decimal is 0.03), and t is 0.25. We need to solve for P, so rearranging the formula, P = I / (r * t).

Let me do the calculations. First, r times t: 0.03 multiplied by 0.25 equals... let's see, 0.03 times 0.25 is 0.0075. So now, I divide 11.25 by 0.0075 to find P.

Wait, what's 11.25 divided by 0.0075? Let's see, I can think of this as 11.25 divided by 75/10000, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to adjust the decimal places. 0.0075 is the same as 75 ten-thousandths. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to convert 0.0075 into a fraction. 0.0075 is 3/400 because 0.0075 = 75/10000 = 3/400. So dividing by 3/400 is the same as multiplying by 400/3.

So 11.25 multiplied by (400/3). Let me compute that. 11.25 times 400 is... 11.25 * 400. Well, 10 * 400 is 4000, and 1.25 * 400 is 500, so total is 4500. Then, 4500 divided by 3 is 1500. So P equals $1500.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 11.25 divided by 0.0075. Let me see, 11.25 / 0.0075. Let's try it as moving the decimal. 0.0075 is 7.5e-3. So 11.25 / 0.0075 = ?

Alternatively, I can write this as (11.25 * 10000) / (0.0075 * 10000) = (112500) / (75) ) because 0.0075 *10000 is 75. So 112500 divided by 75. Let me compute that. 75 times 1500 is 112500, right? 75 * 1000 is 75,000, 75 * 500 is 37,500; 75,000 + 37,500 = 112,500. So yes, 75 * 1500 = 112,500. Therefore, 112500 /75 is 1500. So yes, P is $1500.

Looking at the options, option D is $1500. So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the principal amount \( P \) needed to earn \$11.25 in interest over 3 months at an annual interest rate of 3%, we use the formula:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( I = \$11.25 \) (interest earned),
- \( r = 0.03 \) (annual interest rate as a decimal),
- \( t = 0.25 \) (3 months as a fraction of a year).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( P \):

\[
P = \frac{I}{r \cdot t}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P = \frac{11.25}{0.03 \cdot 0.25}
\]

First, calculate \( r \cdot t \):

\[
0.03 \cdot 0.25 = 0.0075
\]

Now divide \( I \) by \( 0.0075 \):

\[
P = \frac{11.25}{0.0075} = 1500
\]

Thus, the principal amount required is \$1,500. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: \$1500**
