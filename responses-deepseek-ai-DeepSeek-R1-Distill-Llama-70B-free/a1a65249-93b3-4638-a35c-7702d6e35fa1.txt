What distance did he cover in the eight seconds of filming? Assume that the acceleration is uniform throughout.

Options:

A: 350 ft
B: 280 ft
C: 300 ft
D: 312 ft
E: 288 ft
F: 420 ft
G: 324 ft
H: 256 ft
I: 368 ft
J: 400 ft

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a skier being filmed, and I need to find the total distance he covers in eight seconds. Hmm, the problem says the skier travels 36 feet during the fourth second and 48 feet during the sixth second. And the acceleration is uniform, so it's constant acceleration motion.

Alright, I remember that when acceleration is constant, the motion can be described using the equations of kinematics. The key here is probably to find the initial velocity and the acceleration, then use them to compute the total distance over eight seconds.

Wait, the distance traveled during a particular second... Oh right, that's the displacement during that specific one-second interval. So during the fourth second, he went 36 ft, and during the sixth, 48 ft. How does that help me find the initial velocity and acceleration?

I think I can model each of these intervals. Let me think: the distance in the nth second is given by the formula s_n = u + (n-0.5)*a, where u is the initial velocity and a is acceleration. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the distance covered in the nth second is the total displacement from t = n-1 to t = n.

Alternatively, another approach: the displacement during the fourth second (from t=3 to t=4) is 36 ft, and during the sixth second (from t=5 to t=6) is 48 ft.

But wait, displacement in a time interval can be found using the equation s = ut + (1/2)a t². So the displacement during the fourth second is s(4) - s(3) = 36 ft. Similarly, s(6) - s(5) =48 ft.

So let's write this out.

Let me denote s(t) as the position at time t.

So s(4) - s(3) = 36 ft.

Similarly, s(6) - s(5) =48 ft.

Expressing each s(t) using the equation:

s(t) = u * t + (1/2) a t².

So s(4) = 4u + (1/2)a (4)^2 = 4u + 8a.

s(3) = 3u + (4.5)a.

So s(4) - s(3) = (4u -3u) + (8a -4.5a) = u + 3.5a =36 ft.

Similarly for the sixth second:

s(6) =6u + (1/2)a*(36) =6u +18a.

s(5)=5u + (1/2)a*25=5u +12.5a.

So s(6)-s(5)= (6u-5u)+(18a-12.5a)= u +5.5a=48 ft.

Now I have two equations:

1) u + 3.5a =36.

2) u +5.5a=48.

I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate u.

( u +5.5a ) - (u +3.5a )=48-36.

So 2a=12 → a=6 ft/s².

Now substitute a=6 into equation 1.

u +3.5*(6)=36 → u +21=36 → u=15 ft/s.

So initial velocity is 15 ft/s, acceleration 6 ft/s².

Now, I need to find the total distance covered in 8 seconds. Wait, no, the question asks for the distance covered in the eight seconds of filming. So from t=0 to t=8.

The total displacement s(8) is given by s= u t + 0.5 a t².

Plugging in u=15, a=6, t=8.

s(8)=15*8 + 0.5*6*(8)^2.

Calculating each part:

15*8=120.

0.5*6=3 → 3*(64)=192.

So s(8)=120 +192=312 ft.

Looking at the options, option D is 312 ft. So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the skier's motion under constant acceleration. The skier travels 36 ft during the fourth second (from \( t = 3 \) to \( t = 4 \)) and 48 ft during the sixth second (from \( t = 5 \) to \( t = 6 \)). Using the kinematic equation for displacement, \( s(t) = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \), we calculate the displacement during these intervals:

1. For the fourth second (\( t = 3 \) to \( t = 4 \)):
   \[
   s(4) - s(3) = \left(4u + \frac{1}{2}a(4)^2\right) - \left(3u + \frac{1}{2}a(3)^2\right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   s(4) - s(3) = u + 3.5a = 36 \, \text{ft}.
   \]

2. For the sixth second (\( t = 5 \) to \( t = 6 \)):
   \[
   s(6) - s(5) = \left(6u + \frac{1}{2}a(6)^2\right) - \left(5u + \frac{1}{2}a(5)^2\right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   s(6) - s(5) = u + 5.5a = 48 \, \text{ft}.
   \]

We now have two equations:
\[
u + 3.5a = 36 \tag{1}
\]
\[
u + 5.5a = 48 \tag{2}
\]

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) eliminates \( u \):
\[
(u + 5.5a) - (u + 3.5a) = 48 - 36
\]
\[
2a = 12 \implies a = 6 \, \text{ft/s}^2.
\]

Substituting \( a = 6 \) into equation (1):
\[
u + 3.5(6) = 36 \implies u + 21 = 36 \implies u = 15 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

Now, to find the total distance traveled in 8 seconds, we use the displacement equation:
\[
s(8) = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2.
\]
Substituting \( u = 15 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( a = 6 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), and \( t = 8 \):
\[
s(8) = 15(8) + \frac{1}{2}(6)(8)^2.
\]
\[
s(8) = 120 + 3(64) = 120 + 192 = 312 \, \text{ft}.
\]

Thus, the skier covers a total distance of 312 ft in 8 seconds. The correct answer is:

**D: 312 ft.**
