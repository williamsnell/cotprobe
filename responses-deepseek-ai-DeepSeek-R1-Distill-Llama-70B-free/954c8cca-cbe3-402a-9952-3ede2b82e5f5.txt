Okay, so I've got this question about holograms and interference fringes. Hmm, I remember that holography involves interference patterns, and when something changes, like displacement of a surface, it creates fringes that you can count to measure that change. 

The question says the displacement is 2500 nm, which is pretty small, like on the order of the wavelength of light. Oh wait, the laser used is a helium-neon laser. I think those emit at around 632.8 nm wavelength. Yeah, I've heard that number before.

So the problem has three parts: (a) displacement normal to the surface, (b) at 45 degrees, and (c) in the plane. I need to find how many fringes each case would produce.

I remember the formula for fringe count. I think it's something like the displacement divided by the wavelength, multiplied by some factor depending on the angle. Oh right, when the displacement is normal to the surface, the sensitivity is highest because the path difference is maximum. But wait, no—the formula might involve the cosine of the angle or something like that.

Wait, the basic idea is that the number of fringes (N) is equal to the displacement (d) divided by the wavelength (λ), but sometimes multiplied by 2. Because in holography, when you have two interfering waves, any displacement would cause a path difference. So for normal incidence, the path difference is 2d, right? Because the light goes out and comes back, so twice the displacement. So the number of fringes would be (2d)/λ. But wait, sometimes I've seen it as d/(λ/2), which gives the same result.

But wait, when the displacement is not normal. Let me think. If the displacement is at an angle θ relative to the normal, then the effective displacement in the direction of the light is d cosθ. Because displacement can be resolved into components. So the effective path difference would be 2d cosθ, assuming the light is incident normally.

So the general formula would be N = (2d cosθ)/λ. 

Let me confirm. If displacement is normal (θ=0), cosθ=1, so N=2d/λ. If displacement is in the plane (θ=90 degrees), cosθ=0, so N=0. That makes sense because in-plane displacement doesn't change the path length for the light coming in normal. So that's why for part (c), the answer is zero fringes.

Wait, but what about when the displacement is at 45 degrees? Then cos(45) is √2/2 ≈ 0.707. So the number of fringes would be 2d*(0.707)/λ.

Let me compute each part.

Given d = 2500 nm. λ for He-Ne is 632.8 nm, I think.

Calculating (a): θ=0, so cosθ=1.

N = 2*2500 / 632.8 → 5000 / 632.8 ≈ let's see. 632.8 *7 is 4430, 632.8*8=5062.4. So 5000 is between 7 and 8. 5000/632.8 ≈ 7.9. So (a) gives about 7.9 fringes.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes in holography, especially in reflection holograms, the formula might be different. Like, I've heard of the equation N = (2d)/λ when the object is deforming along the direction of illumination. But maybe in some cases it's N = d/(λ/2), which is the same as 2d/λ. So yeah, same result.

Now part (b): displacement is 45 degrees. So cos(45) is approx 0.7071.

N = (2 * 2500 * 0.7071) / 632.8 → 

Let me compute 2500 * 0.7071 ≈ 2500 * 0.7 = 1750, but 0.7071 is a bit more. 2500 * 0.7071 ≈ 1767.75 nm.

Multiply by 2 gives 3535.5 nm.

Divide by 632.8 → 3535.5 / 632.8 ≈ let's see. 632.8 *5 = 3164. 5.5 would be 3488.4. Hmm, 5.6 *632.8 = 5 *632.8 + 0.6*632.8 = 3164 + 379.68 = 3543.68. Oh wait, our numerator is 3535.5. So 5.6 is about 3543.68, which is a little higher. So 3535.5 is about 5.59, so approximately 5.6 fringes.

So (b) gives 5.6 fringes.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me recheck the formula. Suppose the displacement is at θ to the normal. Then the component of displacement along the direction of the light (normal) is d cosθ. So the path difference is 2d cosθ. So N = (2d cosθ)/λ.

For the given d=2500, θ=45, so N = 2*2500 * cos(45) / 632.8.

Another approach: 2500 * 2 =5000. 5000 * cos45 = 5000 * 0.7071≈3535.5. Then 3535.5 /632.8≈5.59≈5.6.

So (b) is 5.6 fringes.

Part (c): displacement in the plane, θ=90 degrees. So cos90=0. So N=0 fringes. That makes sense because the displacement is sideways, so the path difference doesn't change. Hence, no fringes.

So putting it all together: (a)=7.9, (b)=5.6, (c)=0.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option D says: (a)7.9, (b)5.6, (c)0. That's exactly what I got.

So the correct answer is option D.

In a hologram interference experiment, the number of fringes produced due to a displacement is determined by the formula:

\[
N = \frac{2d \cos\theta}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \(d\) is the displacement,
- \(\theta\) is the angle between the displacement and the normal to the surface,
- \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the laser light.

For a helium-neon laser, \(\lambda = 632.8 \, \text{nm}\), and the displacement is \(d = 2500 \, \text{nm}\).

### Part (a): Displacement normal to the surface (\(\theta = 0^\circ\))
When the displacement is normal to the surface, \(\cos\theta = 1\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
N = \frac{2 \cdot 2500}{632.8} = \frac{5000}{632.8} \approx 7.9 \, \text{fringes}.
\]

### Part (b): Displacement at \(45^\circ\) to the normal (\(\theta = 45^\circ\))
For \(\theta = 45^\circ\), \(\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
N = \frac{2 \cdot 2500 \cdot 0.707}{632.8} = \frac{3535.5}{632.8} \approx 5.6 \, \text{fringes}.
\]

### Part (c): Displacement in the plane of the surface (\(\theta = 90^\circ\))
When the displacement is in the plane of the surface, \(\cos\theta = 0\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
N = \frac{2 \cdot 2500 \cdot 0}{632.8} = 0 \, \text{fringes}.
\]

### Conclusion
The number of fringes for each case is:
- (a) \(7.9\) fringes,
- (b) \(5.6\) fringes,
- (c) \(0\) fringes.

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D: (a) 7.9 fringes, (b) 5.6 fringes, (c) 0 fringes.**
