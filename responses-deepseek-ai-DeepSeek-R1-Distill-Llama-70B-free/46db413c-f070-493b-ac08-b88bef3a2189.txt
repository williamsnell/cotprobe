Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the Coulomb force responsible for separating dust particles from the air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the electrode spacing is 1 x 10^3 meters, and the voltage is 1 x 10^4 volts. The particle's charge is +200 quanta. Wait, quanta of charge... Oh right, each quantum is the elementary charge, which is the charge of a single proton. So one quantum is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So 200 quanta would be 200 times that, right?

Let me jot that down. So the charge q is 200 * 1.6e-19 C. Let me compute that: 200 * 1.6 is 320, so 320e-19 C. Or 3.2e-17 C. Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. 1.6e-19 times 200 is 3.2e-17 coulombs. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, I think Coulomb's law is involved here. Coulomb's law gives the force between two charges, but wait, in this context, I think we're dealing with the electric field created by the electrodes, and the force on the charged dust particle due to that electric field. Oh right, because the force on a charge in an electric field is F = qE. So F equals charge times electric field.

So I need to find the electric field E first. The electric field between two electrodes is given by E = V/d, where V is the voltage (or potential difference) and d is the distance between the electrodes. So V is 1e4 volts, d is 1e3 meters. Let's calculate that.

E = V/d = (1e4 V) / (1e3 m) = 10 V/m. Oh, wait, 1e4 divided by 1e3 is 10, because 1e4 is 10^4, 1e3 is 10^3, so 10^(4-3) = 10^1 = 10 V/m. So E is 10 V/m.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, wait. Electric field E is indeed voltage gradient. So yeah, E = V/d, so units of volts per meter. So that's correct.

Now, the force F is qE. So F = q * E. We have q as 3.2e-17 C, and E as 10 V/m.

Wait, let's compute that. F = (3.2e-17 C) * (10 V/m). Hmm. Volts per meter is equivalent to (J/C)/m, since 1 V = 1 J/C. So V/m is J/(C·m). So when you multiply by C (charge), you get J/m, but wait, wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J/m would be kg·m/s², which is Newtons. So the units check out.

So calculating: 3.2e-17 C * 10 V/m = 3.2e-16 N. Because 3.2e-17 times 10 is 3.2e-16.

Wait, but that seems really small. Like, 3.2 times ten to the minus sixteenth power Newtons. But looking at the answer options, the options are all much larger, like 10^2 N to 10^19 N. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Let me double-check. Oh wait, the charge is 200 quanta, which is 200 times 1.6e-19 C. So 200 * 1.6e-19 is 3.2e-17 C. That's correct.

Electric field E is V/d = 1e4 V / 1e3 m = 10 V/m. That seems right too.

So F = qE = 3.2e-17 C * 10 V/m = 3.2e-16 N. But none of the options are that small. The smallest option is A, 2e2 N, which is 200 N. Hmmm. That's way bigger than my result. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the setup is different. Let me think again.

Wait, Coulomb force between two charges is F = k * |q1 q2| / r². But that's when you have two point charges. But in this case, perhaps it's the electric field from the electrodes acting on the charge.

Wait, maybe the electrodes create an electric field, and the particle, having a charge, feels a force. So F = qE. That's what I did earlier. So why is my answer way too small?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the exponents. Let me recalculate.

Charge q: 200 quanta. Each quantum is 1.6e-19 C. So 200 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-17 C. Correct.

Electric field E: 1e4 V / 1e3 m = 10 V/m.

F = 3.2e-17 C * 10 V/m = 3.2e-16 N. Hmm, that's 3.2e-16 N. But the options start at 2e2 N. So perhaps I messed up the charge calculation?

Wait another thought: Maybe the voltage is applied across a different distance. Wait, the electrode spacing is 1e3 meters? That's 1000 meters? That seems extremely large for an electrode setup, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, 1e3 meters is 1000 meters, which is a kilometer. That's a huge distance for electrodes. But assuming the problem states that, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I inverted the voltage and the distance. Let me check: E = V/d. If V is 1e4 V (10,000 V) and d is 1e3 m (1000 m), then E is 10 V/m. That's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different value for the charge. Let me recheck. The particle's charge is +200 quanta. So 200 * e, where e is 1.6e-19 C. So 200 * 1.6e-19 is 3.2e-17 C. Correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Coulomb force is between two charges, but I thought it's the electric field force.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the Coulomb force refers to the force between two charges, but in this context, maybe the electric field applies a force on the particle. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the electric field being between the electrodes, so the force on the particle's charge is due to that field. So my approach seems right, but the answer isn't matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3.2e-17 C multiplied by 10 V/m.

3.2e-17 * 10 = 3.2e-16 N. That seems correct. So none of the options match. But the options are all much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Wait, the electrode spacing is 1e3 m? Or perhaps I read it wrong. Let me check the question again.

Question says: Electrode spacing is 1 x 10^3 m, voltage is 1 × 10^4 V. Yes. So 1e3 m and 1e4 V.

Alternatively, perhaps the Coulomb force refers to the force between two particles, but the question says "responsible for the separation of dust particles from the air." Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the force is due to the electric field from the electrodes, so F = qE, which is what I've done.

But the result I got isn't one of the options. Hmmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the force in another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as F = (V * q) / d. Wait, but that's the same as F = q * (V/d) = qE. So that's the same approach.

Wait, wait, maybe the voltage is the potential difference, so E = V/d, but perhaps the units are different. Wait, 1e4 V is 10,000 V, and 1e3 m is 1000 m. So E = 10 V/m. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the charge is 200 times the elementary charge, but perhaps the calculation is 200e-19 C. Wait, no, because 1.6e-19 is e. So 200e would be 200 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-17 C. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.2e-17 * 10 again. 3.2e-17 * 10 is 3.2e-16 N. Hmm.

Looking at the answer options, I don't see this value. The options are A: 2e2, B:6.4e8, etc. So perhaps I have a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponents in my calculation. Let me compute 200 * 1.6e-19 again.

200 is 2e2. So 2e2 * 1.6e-19 = (2 * 1.6) * 10^(2-19) )= 3.2 * 10^(-17). So that's correct.

Wait, unless I'm supposed to use a different value for e? Like, maybe the problem uses e as 1.0e-19 or something? But no, the standard charge is ~1.6e-19 C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the force between two particles, each with charge 200e. So F = k * (200e)^2 / (d)^2.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me try that. Coulomb's law.

But then, what would be the distance between the particles? The electrode spacing is 1e3 m? Or is the dust particle moving through the field, and the relevant distance is something else?

Wait, if I model the electrodes as two plates separated by d = 1e3 m, with voltage V = 1e4 V, then the electric field is as I calculated before, 10 V/m. So the force on the particle is F = qE = 3.2e-17 C * 10 V/m = 3.2e-16 N.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the voltage is the potential difference across the particle itself. But that doesn't make much sense. The voltage between the electrodes is given, so the electric field in that region would be E = V/d.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the Coulomb force between the particle and one of the electrodes, considering their charges. Let's think: If one electrode is at a certain potential, and the particle has a charge, maybe the force is due to the image charge or something. But that's getting more complicated than necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the Coulomb force is between the two electrodes, but that doesn't make sense because electrodes are plates, not point charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the electrode as a charged plate, and the particle as a point charge, so the force would be F = (sigma) * q, where sigma is the surface charge density on the electrode.

Wait, but sigma is charge per unit area, and without knowing the area, that approach might not be feasible.

Wait, let me think again about the initial approach. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the exponents.

Wait, 200 * 1.6e-19 C is 3.2e-17 C. Correct.

E is 1e4 V / 1e3 m = 10 V/m. Correct.

So F = 3.2e-17 C * 10 V/m = 3.2e-16 N.

Wait, but none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the charge in terms of elementary charges without converting to coulombs. Let me think.

Wait, the charge is 200 quanta, which is 200e. So 200e. But perhaps the electric field is in V/m, which is N/C per V/m. Wait, no, V/m is (N/C)/m. So when you multiply by C, you get N.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use F = q * E, but in different units.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute everything in base SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in different terms. But I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the "Coulomb force" refers to the force experienced by the dust particle due to the electric field, but perhaps the problem expects me to compute something else.

Wait, perhaps the Coulomb force is the force between two particles, each with 200 quanta of charge, separated by the electrode spacing. So, F = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2.

But then, if both charges are 200 quanta, then q1 = q2 = 200e. So F = k * (200e)^2 / (d)^2.

Let me compute that. Let's see.

k is Coulomb's constant, 8.99e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.6e-19 C.

So q1 and q2 are each 200e = 3.2e-17 C.

So F = (8.99e9) * (3.2e-17)^2 / (1e3)^2.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

(3.2e-17)^2 = 10.24e-34 = 1.024e-33.

Multiply by 8.99e9: 8.99e9 * 1.024e-33 = approx 9.21e-24.

Denominator is (1e3)^2 = 1e6.

So F = (9.21e-24) / (1e6) = 9.21e-30 N. That's even smaller. So that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, this is confusing. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but my calculation is wrong. Let me recheck the initial approach.

Wait, wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula F = (V * q) / (d), but I thought that's equivalent to F = qE, since E = V/d. So F = q * (V/d) = (q V)/d.

Wait, let's compute it that way.

F = (q * V) / d.

q is 200e = 3.2e-17 C.

V is 1e4 V.

d is 1e3 m.

So F = (3.2e-17 C * 1e4 V) / 1e3 m.

Compute numerator: 3.2e-17 * 1e4 = 3.2e-13.

Divide by 1e3: 3.2e-13 / 1e3 = 3.2e-16 N. Same result as before.

So same answer, still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, voltage is 1e4 V, which is 10,000 V. The distance is 1e3 meters, which is 1000 meters. So E = 10,000 / 1000 = 10 V/m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the charge is 200 times elementary charge, which is 200 * 1.6e-19 C. So that's 3.2e-17 C. Correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to 200 quanta as 200 times the charge of an electron, but wait, that's the same as 200e.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using microcoulombs instead of coulombs. Wait, no, 200e is 3.2e-17 C, which is 0.32 microcoulombs? No, wait, 1 microcoulomb is 1e-6 C, so 3.2e-17 is 0.00032 microcoulombs. That doesn't help.

Wait, the options are all larger than my result. Let's see, what if I made a mistake with the exponent for E? Let me recheck E.

E = V/d = 1e4 V / 1e3 m = 10 V/m. So that's correct. So 3.2e-17 C * 10 V/m = 3.2e-16 N.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the charge in terms of Coulombs without scaling, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is 1e4 V, but the distance is 1e-3 meters instead of 1e3. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says electrode spacing is 1 x 10^3 m. So 1e3 m, not 1e-3. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should think about the direction of the force or if there's any other factor involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the force between the particle and an image charge on the electrode. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of electric field force as F = qE, but with E in a different unit. Wait, electric field can also be expressed in N/C. So E is 10 N/C (since 1 V/m = 1 N/C).

So F = qE = 3.2e-17 C * 10 N/C = 3.2e-16 N. Same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of the options are near this value. Looking at the options:

A: 2e2 N → 200 N

B: 6.4e8 N → 640,000,000 N

C:5e5 → 500,000 N

D:7.2e12 → 7.2 trillion N

E:2.8e6 → 2.8 million N

F:1e7 → 10 million N

G:4.5e11 → 450 billion N

H:1.6e19 → 1.6e19 N

I:3.
