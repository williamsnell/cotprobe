Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Henry's Law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the equilibrium concentration of oxygen gas in freshwater at 25°C when exposed to air at a pressure of 760 torr. They give the Henry's Law constant for oxygen in water at 25°C as 3.30 × 10^7 torr·atm/(mol·L), I think. Or wait, no, Henry's Law constant units can vary. Let me remember. Henry's Law states that the concentration of a dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure above the liquid. The formula is C = P / (H), where C is concentration, P is the partial pressure, and H is Henry's constant.

Wait, but wait. I might be mixing up the formula. Henry's Law can be written as C = (P)/(Kh), where Kh is the Henry's law constant. But sometimes the units might require some conversion. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So the problem says the air pressure is 760 torr. But wait, oxygen isn't the only gas in air. Air is about 21% oxygen by volume, right? So the partial pressure of oxygen would be 21% of 760 torr. Let me calculate that first.

So 21% is 0.21. 0.21 multiplied by 760 torr. Let me compute that. 760 * 0.21 = 159.6 torr. So the partial pressure of O2 is 159.6 torr.

Now, using Henry's Law, the concentration C should be P divided by Kh. So C = (159.6 torr) / (3.30e7 torr·something). Wait, I'm not sure about the units here. Let me think about the units of the Henry's Law constant.

I think the Henry's Law constant (Kh) is given in units of torr·L/mol. Because Henry's Law is written as P = Kh * C, where P is pressure in torr, and C is concentration in mol/L. So rearranged, C = P / Kh, so units would be (torr) / (torr·L/mol) ) = mol/L. Right, that makes sense.

So plugging in the numbers, C = 159.6 torr / 3.30e7 torr·L/mol. Let me compute that. 159.6 divided by 3.3e7.

Wait, 3.3e7 is 33,000,000. So 159.6 / 33,000,000. Hmm, let me do that division. Let's see, 159.6 divided by 33 million. Let me write it as 159.6 / 33,000,000. Let me approximate this.

33 million is 3.3e7, and 159.6 is 1.596e2. So 1.596e2 / 3.3e7 = (1.596 / 3.3) * 1e-5. Let's compute 1.596 divided by 3.3. 3.3 goes into 1.596 about 0.483 times. So approximately 0.483 * 1e-5 = 4.83e-6 mol/L.

Wait, but wait, that's 4.83e-6 mol per liter. But the question asks for the concentration in milligrams per liter. So I need to convert moles to grams, then to milligrams.

First, find the molar mass of O2. Oxygen's atomic weight is about 16 g/mol, so O2 is 32 g/mol.

So, 4.83e-6 mol/L multiplied by 32 g/mol gives grams per liter. Let's compute that: 4.83e-6 * 32 = ?

4.83e-6 * 32 = 0.00015456 grams per liter. Because 4.83 * 32 = 154.56, so 154.56e-6 grams. Since 1 gram is 1000 milligrams, I need to convert grams to milligrams.

0.00015456 grams = 0.15456 milligrams. So 0.15456 mg/L? Hmm, but that seems really low. Let me check my calculations again because none of the options are that low except option H:8 mg/L, but 0.154 is even lower. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the units of the Henry's Law constant. Let me double-check. The problem says the Henry's Law constant is 3.30 ×10^7 torrs. Wait, that can't be right. Because if Kh has units of torr·L/mol, as I thought earlier, but if the given value is 3.30e7 torr, that wouldn't make sense because you can't have units of torr without any other dimensions. So perhaps the Henry's Law constant is given in units that include atm or another pressure unit.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing different forms of Henry's Law. Another version is when the Henry's Law constant is expressed in L·atm/mol. Let me think. Let me check the units again.

If Henry's Law is written as C = P / Kh, then if P is in atm, and C is in mol/L, then Kh would have units of (atm·L)/mol. So in that case, if the given Kh is in terms of torr, but perhaps the pressure should be converted to atm.

Wait, the problem states the Henry's Law constant is 3.30e7 torrs. That's a bit ambiguous. Let me think. The pressure given is 760 torr, which is 1 atm. So perhaps the Henry's Law constant is given in different units. Let me think again.

Wait, let me clarify. The standard units for Henry's Law constant (Kh) depend on how it's expressed. If the gas is in atm, then Kh would be in terms of (atm·L)/mol. But if the pressure is in torr, then Kh would be in (torr·L)/mol.

Wait, but in the problem, the pressure is given in torr (760 torr), and Kh is given as 3.30e7 torrs. Hmm, that seems unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the units of Kh are in torr·L/mol, meaning that when you divide pressure in torr by Kh in torr·L/mol, you get mol/L.

So let's try that again.

P_O2 = 159.6 torr.

Kh = 3.30e7 torr·L/mol.

So C = P / Kh = 159.6 / 3.3e7 = same as before, 4.83e-6 mol/L.

But that gives a very low concentration, about 0.00000483 mol/L, which is 4.83e-6. Multiply by molar mass 32 g/mol: 4.83e-6 *32= 0.00015456 g/L, which is 0.15456 mg/L. That's about 0.155 mg/L, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo that division:

159.6 divided by 33,000,000.

Let me compute 159.6 / 33,000,000.

33,000,000 is 3.3e7.

So 159.6 / 3.3e7 = (159.6 / 3.3) * 1e-7.

Wait, 159.6 divided by 3.3 is 48.3. So 48.3 * 1e-7 = 4.83e-6 mol/L.

Yes, as before. But that's leading me to 0.154 mg/L, which isn't an option. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the Henry's Law constant is given in a different unit. Let me think. Oh, wait! Maybe the actual value is given in terms of (atm·L)/mol, not torr. Because 3.3e7 torr is way too high. Let me think: 1 atm is 760 torr, so 3.3e7 torr would be 3.3e7 / 760 ≈ 43461.5 atm. That's a huge pressure, which doesn't make sense for a Henry's Law constant. Maybe the correct unit is in (atm·L)/mol, so perhaps the given value is 3.30e7 atm·L/mol? Wait, but that's also not possible because that's an extremely high value. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again as presented in the problem. The problem says, "the Henry's law constant for oxygen in water at 25°C is 3.30 × 10^7 torrs." So the unit is torrs, but that doesn't make sense as a unit for Kh. Because Kh has to have pressure units times volume per mole. So perhaps the problem had a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the units.

Wait, maybe the Henry's Law constant is given as 3.30 ×10^7 L·torr/mol. Because that would make sense, as then the units would be (L·torr)/mol, but when you divide pressure (torr) by Kh (L·torr/mol), you get mol/L.

So if Kh is 3.30e7 L·torr/mol, then C = P / Kh would be (torr) / (L·torr/mol) ) = mol/L.

Wait, that makes sense. So perhaps the problem actually intended that the units of Kh are L·torr/mol, not just torr. Because otherwise, the units wouldn't make sense.

So redoing with that in mind:

P_O2 = 159.6 torr.

Kh = 3.30e7 L·torr/mol.

C = 159.6 torr / (3.3e7 L·torr/mol) ) = 159.6 / 3.3e7 = 4.83e-6 mol/L, same as before.

So that gives me 4.83e-6 mol/L, which is 4.83e-6 * 32 g/mol = 0.00015456 g/L = 0.15456 mg/L. But none of the options are that low. So I must have some error here.

Wait, perhaps the Henry's Law constant is actually 3.30 ×10^-7 torr^-1·mol/L or something else. Because 3.3e7 seems really high. Let me think: I've read that Henry's Law constants for gases in water are typically in the range of 10^3 to 10^5 atm·L/mol. For example, oxygen's Kh is around 770 L·atm/mol at 25°C, which would be 770 *760 torr·L/mol, which is about 5.85e5 torr·L/mol. Hmm, but the given value here is 3.3e7, which is much higher than that. So perhaps I'm misapplying the units.

Wait, perhaps I have the reciprocal of Henry's Law? Oh wait, some sources define Henry's Law as P = C * Kh, so C = P / Kh. Others might define it differently. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: I'll look up the Henry's Law constant for O2 in water at 25°C. Wait, from what I remember, the Kh for O2 is about 769 L·atm/mol. Let me confirm that. If that's the case, then converting that to torr would be 769 * 760 torr·L/mol = 769 *760 = let's see, 700*760=532,000, and 69*760=52,440, so total 584,440 torr·L/mol. So approximately 5.844e5 torr·L/mol.

But the problem gives Kh as 3.3e7 torr. That's way off. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, or I'm misunderstanding the units. Alternatively, perhaps the given Kh is in terms of (torr·L)/mol, so 3.3e7 torr·L/mol, which would be 3.3e7 /760 ≈ 43461.5 L·atm/mol, which is way higher than the known value for O2.

This suggests that perhaps the given Henry's Law constant in the problem is incorrect, or I'm miscalculating something. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the calculation as per the given data, even if it contradicts real-world values.

So, proceeding with the given data:

C = 159.6 torr / 3.3e7 torr·L/mol = 4.83e-6 mol/L.

Then, converting to mg/L: 4.83e-6 mol/L * 32 g/mol = 0.00015456 g/L = 0.15456 mg/L. So approximately 0.155 mg/L, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Henry's Law formula.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the Henry's Law constant is given as Kh = 3.30e7 (unitless), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is in atm, not torr.

Wait, the problem says the air pressure is 760 torr, which is 1 atm. So maybe I should convert the pressure to atm and use Henry's Law in those terms.

So, if the pressure is 1 atm, and the Kh is given in (torr·L)/mol, then perhaps I need to adjust the units.

Wait, let me try this. Let's assume that the given Henry's Law constant is 3.30e7 L·torr/mol. So, the partial pressure of O2 is 159.6 torr. So, C = 159.6 torr / (3.3e7 L·torr/mol) ) = 4.83e-6 mol/L as before.

But that leads me to 0.154 mg/L, which isn't an option. So perhaps the Henry's Law constant is given in another way. Another thought: Maybe it's given as 3.30e7 torr/(mol/L), which would make the units of Kh as torr·L/mol, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to provide the reciprocal of the Henry's Law constant. Let me think: If the given value were actually 1/Kh, then C would be P * (1/Kh) = 159.6 / (3.3e7)^-1, which would be 159.6 * (1e7/3.3). Wait, no, that would be 159.6 * (1/3.3e7), which would give a higher value. Wait, no, if Kh were actually smaller, then C would be larger.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula in a different way, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the Henry's Law constant is given in terms of (atm·L)/mol, but the pressure is in torr. So I need to convert the pressure to atm.

The partial pressure of O2 is 159.6 torr, which is 159.6 /760 atm = 0.21 atm exactly, as 21% of 1 atm.

So, if Kh is 3.30e7 (unit?), but if I'm assuming it's in (atm·L)/mol, then:

C = P / Kh = 0.21 atm / (3.3e7 atm·L/mol) ) = 0.21 / 3.3e7 = 6.36e-9 mol/L. That would give an even smaller concentration, which is worse.

Hmm, so that can't be right. So perhaps the given Henry's Law constant is incorrect in the problem, but I have to proceed with it as given.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recheck the calculations.

Partial pressure of O2 is 0.21 * 760 torr = 159.6 torr. Correct.

Kh given is 3.3e7 torr·L/mol. So C = 159.6 / 3.3e7 = 4.83e-6 mol/L. Then, multiply by molar mass 32 g/mol to get 0.000154 g/L, which is 0.154 mg/L. But none of the options match. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: Let's try using a different version of Henry's Law. Some sources define Henry's Law as C = (P * M) / (R * T), where M is molar mass. No, that's for ideal gas law, not Henry's.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C = (P / (R T)) * H, where H is Henry's constant in (mol/L·atm). No, that's not right either.

Wait, let me look up the formula again. Henry's Law is C = P / Kh, where C is concentration in mol/L, P is partial pressure in atm, and Kh is Henry's Law constant in (atm·L)/mol.

So, if I have P in atm, then I can use Kh in (atm·L)/mol.

In our case, P is 159.6 torr. Convert that to atm: 159.6 /760 = 0.21 atm.

But the problem gives Kh as 3.3e7 torr. Wait, no, the problem says the unit is torrs, which probably is a typo for (torr·L)/mol.

Wait, perhaps the given Henry's Law constant is in (torr·L)/mol, so I can use it directly with pressure in torr.

So, C = 159.6 torr / (3.3e7 torr·L/mol) ) = 4.83e-6 mol/L.

That's the same as before. Now, compute the concentration in mg/L.

4.83e-6 mol/L * 32 g/mol = 0.00015456 g/L = 0.15456 mg/L, which is about 0.155 mg/L.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is H: 8 mg/L, but that's way higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, let's think about units again. Did I miscalculate the unit conversion from mol to mg?

Wait, 1 mole of O2 is 32 grams. So 1 mol/L is 32 g/L, which is 32,000 mg/L. So, if I have 4.83e-6 mol/L, that's 4
