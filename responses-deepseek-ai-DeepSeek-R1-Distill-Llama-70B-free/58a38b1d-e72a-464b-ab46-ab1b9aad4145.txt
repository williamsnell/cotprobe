Question:

The price of labor is $2, and the price of capital is $1. The marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50. What should the firm do?

Options:

A: Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.
B: Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.
C: Increase both labor and capital so that both the marginal product of capital and labor rises.
D: Increase labor and keep capital constant so that the marginal product of labor falls and the marginal product of capital remains the same.
E: Decrease both labor and capital so that both the marginal product of capital and labor falls.
F: Keep labor constant and decrease capital so that the marginal product of labor remains the same and the marginal product of capital falls.
G: Keep labor constant and increase capital so that the marginal product of labor remains the same and the marginal product of capital rises.
H: Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.
I: Decrease labor and increase capital so that the marginal product of labor rises and the marginal product of capital falls.
J: Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about a firm deciding whether to use more labor, capital, or both. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step.

Alright, let's start by listing what I know. The price of labor is $2, and the price of capital is $1. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is 200, and the marginal product of capital (MPK) is 50. I remember that firms aim to maximize profits, so they'll adjust inputs where the marginal product per dollar is the highest.

Wait, I think the key here is the concept of marginal products and their relation to input prices. Oh right, the ratio of marginal product to price for each input should be equal at the optimal point. So, the firm should allocate resources until the last dollar spent on each input gives the same marginal product per dollar.

Let me calculate the ratios. For labor, MPL is 200 and price is $2, so the ratio is 200/2 = 100. For capital, MPK is 50 and price is $1, so 50/1 = 50. Oh, so labor's ratio is higher than capital's. That means the firm is getting more "bang for the buck" from labor than from capital.

So, the firm should probably increase its use of labor because each additional unit gives a higher marginal product per dollar spent. But wait, what about capital? Since labor's ratio is higher, maybe they should use more labor and less capital? Or no, maybe just more labor and same capital?

Wait, no. Because when you increase labor, the MPL will decrease due to diminishing marginal returns, right? And if you decrease capital, the MPK would increase because you're using less, so each additional unit becomes more valuable. Hmm, but in this case, the current MPK is lower than what it would be if you reduce capital. So perhaps the firm should adjust towards equalizing these ratios.

Wait, let me think again. The firm wants MPL/P_L = MPK/P_K. Right now, MPL/P_L is 100, MPK/P_K is 50. So they're not equal. To make them equal, the firm should adjust the inputs so that these ratios become the same.

So, since MPL/P_L is higher than MPK/P_K, the firm is getting more value per dollar from labor. Therefore, they should increase labor and decrease capital. Because when they increase labor, MPL decreases (as more workers lead to diminishing returns), and when they decrease capital, MPK increases. So moving in that direction will bring the ratios closer.

Looking at the options now. So the firm should decrease capital and increase labor. Let's see which options say that.

Option A: Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises. Wait, no. If you decrease capital, MPK would rise (since you have less, each unit is more valuable), not fall. So A says MPK falls and MPL rises, which doesn't make sense. Because decreasing capital should make MPK rise.

Option H: Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls. Oh, that's right. Because adding more labor (assuming MPL decreases as you add more) and decreasing capital (so MPK increases). So H seems correct.

Wait, let me check the other options. Option I: Decrease labor, increase capital. No, because that would make the ratios even more unequal. Option B: Increase capital and decrease labor. That would lower MPK further, which is the opposite of what we want.

So the correct action is to decrease capital and increase labor, which leads to MPK rising and MPL falling, making their ratios equal eventually. So the option that says that is H.

The firm aims to maximize profits by equalizing the ratio of marginal product to price for labor and capital. Currently, the marginal product of labor (MPL) is 200, and the price of labor (P_L) is $2, giving a ratio of 100. The marginal product of capital (MPK) is 50, and the price of capital (P_K) is $1, giving a ratio of 50. Since the ratio for labor is higher than for capital, the firm should adjust its inputs to bring these ratios closer together.

Increasing labor will decrease MPL due to diminishing marginal returns, while decreasing capital will increase MPK. This adjustment will move the firm toward the optimal allocation of resources. Among the options provided, the correct choice is to decrease capital and increase labor, which will cause MPK to rise and MPL to fall, aligning the ratios more closely.

The correct answer is **H**.
