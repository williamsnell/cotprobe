Okay, so I've got this question about amino acids and which ones are essential. Hmm, I remember that essential amino acids are the ones that the human body can't make on its own, so they must come from the diet. Let me try to recall the list.

Wait, I think there are nine essential amino acids. Oh right, they are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Or wait, sometimes I get confused because some sources might group them a little differently, but I think that's the standard list.

The question is asking which options list amino acids that are all essential. So I need to look through each option and check each amino acid in it.

Looking at the options:

Option A: leucine, methionine, and threonine. Okay, leucine is essential, methionine too, and threonine. So all three are essential. So option A could be a correct answer.

Option B: leucine (essential), cysteine, and glycine. Wait, cysteine is considered semi-essential because the body can make it from methionine, but I'm not sure if it's considered essential. Glycine is non-essential because the body can synthesize it. So B has one non-essential, so it's not the right answer.

Option C: proline, tyrosine, and serine. Proline is non-essential. Tyrosine is a bit tricky because it's considered conditionally essential; the body can make it from phenylalanine, but if someone doesn't have enough phenylalanine, they might need tyrosine. Serine is non-essential. So C has non-essentials.

Option D: valine (essential), glycine (non), arginine (conditionally essential, I think). So D has at least one non-essential, so it's out.

Option E: methionine (essential), serine (non), tyrosine (conditional). So E has some non-essentials, so not correct.

Option F: isoleucine (essential), alanine (non), glycine (non). So F has two non-essentials, so no.

Option G: lysine (essential), tyrosine (conditional), cysteine (semi-essential). So not all essential; G is out.

Option H: aspartate (non-essential, since the body makes aspartic acid), valine (essential), threonine (essential). So H has one non, so no.

Option I: lysine (essential), proline (non), arginine (conditionally essential). So I has non-essentials, so no.

So the only option where all three are essential is option A: leucine, methionine, and threonine.

The question asks which option lists amino acids that are all essential components of the diet. Essential amino acids are those that the human body cannot synthesize and must be obtained from the diet. The standard list of essential amino acids includes: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.

Analyzing each option:

- **Option A**: Leucine, methionine, and threonine. All three are essential amino acids.  
- **Option B**: Leucine (essential), cysteine (semi-essential, as it can be synthesized from methionine), and glycine (non-essential). Not all essential.  
- **Option C**: Proline (non-essential), tyrosine (conditionally essential, synthesized from phenylalanine), and serine (non-essential). Not all essential.  
- **Option D**: Valine (essential), glycine (non-essential), and arginine (conditionally essential). Not all essential.  
- **Option E**: Methionine (essential), serine (non-essential), and tyrosine (conditionally essential). Not all essential.  
- **Option F**: Isoleucine (essential), alanine (non-essential), and glycine (non-essential). Not all essential.  
- **Option G**: Lysine (essential), tyrosine (conditionally essential), and cysteine (semi-essential). Not all essential.  
- **Option H**: Aspartate (non-essential), valine (essential), and threonine (essential). Not all essential.  
- **Option I**: Lysine (essential), proline (non-essential), and arginine (conditionally essential). Not all essential.  

The only option where all three amino acids are essential is **Option A**.  

Answer: A
