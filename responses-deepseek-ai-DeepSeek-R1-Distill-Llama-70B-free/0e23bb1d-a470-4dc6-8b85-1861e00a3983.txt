Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 14 in an undirected graph. The graph is given with a set of edges, so I'll need to map out the connections first.

Let me list out all the edges to get a better picture.

The edges are:
<0,1>, <1,3>, <0,3>, <3,4>, <0,4>, <1,2>, <2,5>, <2,7>, <2,6>, <6,7>, <6,10>, <5,8>, <10,9>, <5,10>, <6,8>, <7,8>, <6,9>, <7,10>, <8,10>, <9,11>, <9,12>, <9,13>, <13,12>, <13,11>, <11,14>.

Hmm, so each node is connected to several others. I think the best approach is to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from node 1. BFS is good for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Let me outline the neighbors for each node as I go.

Starting from node 1. Its neighbors are 0, 2, and 3 because the edges are <1,0>, <1,2>, <1,3> (since the graph is undirected, each edge is bidirectional).

So, level 1 (distance 1 from 1) includes nodes 0, 2, 3.

Now, I'll explore each of these in order, checking their neighbors and adding unvisited nodes to the next level.

Starting with node 0:
Neighbors of 0 are 1, 3, 4. But 1 is already visited, so 3 and 4 are considered. But wait, 3 is already in the first level, so 4 is new. So adding 4 to the next level.

Next, node 2:
Neighbors are 1,5,7,6. 1 is visited, so 5,7,6 are new. So level 2 will include 5,7,6 along with 4.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the levels. Let me structure this better.

BFS proceeds level by level. So, starting from 1 as level 0.

Level 0: [1]

Level 1: 0, 2, 3.

Now, for each node in level 1, find their neighbors.

Processing node 0:
Neighbors are 1 (visited), 3 (in level 1), 4. So 4 is added to level 2.

Processing node 2:
Neighbors are 1 (visited),5,7,6. So 5,7,6 are added to level 2.

Processing node 3:
Neighbors are 1 (visited),0 (visited),4. So 4 is already in level 2.

So level 2 nodes are 4,5,6,7.

Now, for each node in level 2, process their neighbors.

Processing node 4:
Neighbors: 0 (visited),3 (visited), so no new nodes.

Processing node5:
Neighbors are 2 (visited),8,10. So 8 and 10 are new, added to level3.

Processing node6:
Neighbors:2 (visited),7,10,8,9. So 7 is in level2, so 10,8,9 are added to level3.

Wait, but level3 is being built as we process each node in level2. So let me see:

Processing node4: no new nodes.

Processing node5: adds 8 and 10.

Processing node6: adds 10 (already added by node5?), 8 (added?), 9.

Wait, let me track which have been added. So after node5, 8 and 10 are in level3.

Then node6: neighbors are 2 (visited),7 (level2), 10 (already in level3), 8 (already added?), 9 (new). So 9 is added to level3.

Processing node7 (level2 node):
Neighbors:2 (visited),6 (level2),8,10. So 8 and 10 are already in level3.

So level3 nodes are 8,10,9.

Now, process level3 nodes.

Processing node8:
Neighbors:5 (level2),6 (level2),10 (level3), and others. New nodes? Let's see.

Looking at edges, node8 is connected to 5,6,10, and maybe others. Wait, from the edges, node8 is connected to 5,6,10, and perhaps others. Let me check all edges involving 8.

Edges involving 8:
<5,8>, <6,8>, <7,8>, <8,10>.

So node8's neighbors are 5,6,7,10. All of these are in levels 2 or 3, except maybe node10. But node10 is in level3. So no new nodes from processing 8.

Processing node10:
Neighbors:6,5,7,8,9,10? Let me check the edges.

Looking at edges, node10 is connected to 6,5,7,8,9, and others. Wait, let's list them:

From edges:
<6,10>, <5,10>, <7,10>, <8,10>, <10,9>.

So neighbors are 6 (level2),5 (level2),7 (level2),8 (level3),9 (level3).

No new nodes here.

Processing node9:
Neighbors:6 (level2),10 (level3),11,12,13.

So 11,12,13 are new. So level4 adds 11,12,13.

Now, level4 is [11,12,13].

Processing these:

Processing node11:
Neighbors:9 (level3),13,14. So 13 is in level4, and 14 is new. So 14 is added to level5.

Processing node12:
Neighbors:9 (level3),13. Both are in level4.

Processing node13:
Neighbors:9 (level3),12 (level4),11 (level4).

So when processing node11, we find node14. So the path from 1 to 14 is level0:1, then through the path that leads to 11, then to 14.

So the path length is 5 steps (levels 0 to 5), but the number of nodes is 6.

Now, let's track the actual path.

We need to find the shortest path, which is the first time we reach node14.

Looking back, node14 is a neighbor of node11. So the path must go through node11.

So how did we get to node11?

Node11 is in level4. It was added via node9, which is in level3.

So the path is 1 -> ... ->9 ->11 ->14.

Now, how did we get to node9?

Node9 is in level3. It was added via node6, which is in level2.

Because node6's neighbors include 9, so when processing node6 (level2), we added node9 to level3.

So the path so far: 1 ->2 ->6 ->9 ->11 ->14.

Wait, node6 is a level2 node, which is a child of node2, which is level1 (children of node1).

So the path would be 1 ->2 ->6 ->9 ->11 ->14.

That's five steps, so the path length is 5. Let's count the nodes: 1,2,6,9,11,14. That's 6 nodes, 5 edges.

Now, let's look at the options.

Looking at the options given:

Option J: [1,2,6,9,11,14]. That's exactly the path we found.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Is there a shorter path? Let's see other possibilities.

For instance, is there a path that goes through node5 to node10 to node9, etc.?

Looking at another path: 1->2->5->8->10->9->11->14. That's longer, 7 nodes, so longer than option J's 6.

Alternatively, 1->2->5->10->9->11->14: that's 6 nodes as well. Let me see if that's a possible path.

Wait, node5 is connected to 10, and 10 is connected to 9. So yes, that path exists. So that's another path of length 5 edges.

Wait, but option B is [1,2,5,10,6,9,11,14]. Wait, that's longer.

Wait, no, let me check the options again:

Option D is [1,2,5,8,10,14]. Wait, does 10 connect directly to 14? Let me check the edges.

Looking back, the edges involving 10 are: <6,10>, <5,10>, <7,10>, <8,10>, <10,9>. So 10 is connected to 9 and others. Is 10 connected to 14? No, the edges don't show a direct connection between 10 and 14. So option D, which suggests that 10 connects to 14, is incorrect because there's no such edge.

So the path 1->2->5->10->9->11->14 (length 6 nodes, 5 edges) is a valid path. But that's the same length as option J's path, which is 6 nodes.

Wait, but wait, does node10 connect to node9? Yes, via <10,9>. So from 10, you can go to 9, then to 11, then to 14.

So the path through 2,5,10,9,11,14 is another possible shortest path. Let's count the nodes: 1,2,5,10,9,11,14. That's 7 nodes, which is longer than the path in option J which is 6 nodes. So option J is shorter.

Wait, no, wait. The path through 2,6,9,11,14 is 5 steps, 6 nodes. The path through 2,5,10,9,11,14 is 6 steps, 7 nodes. So the former is shorter.

So the shortest path is option J.

Wait, but let me check if there's a way to reach 9 earlier. Like, from node6 to node9 is one step. Are there other nodes that can reach 9 in the same number of steps?

Yes, node6 is level2, and node9 is level3.

Another way: node10 is level3, but 10 connects to 9, which is also level3. So from 10, you can get to 9 in level3, but that would require going through 10, which is level3, so the path would be longer.

So the shortest path is through node6.

Now, looking back at the options, option J is [1,2,6,9,11,14], which matches our findings.

Wait, but let me look at the other options again.

Option G: [1,0,3,2,5,8,9,11,14]. That's longer.

Option H: [1,3,4,0,2,6,9,11,14]. Also longer.

Option D: [1,2,5,8,10,14] - as discussed, 10 doesn't connect to 14.

So the correct answer is option J.

To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 14 in the given undirected graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is suitable for this task as it efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph by exploring all nodes level by level.

### Step 1: Represent the graph
The edges are given as:
- `<0,1>, <1,3>, <0,3>, <3,4>, <0,4>, <1,2>, <2,5>, <2,7>, <2,6>, <6,7>, <6,10>, <5,8>, <10,9>, <5,10>, <6,8>, <7,8>, <6,9>, <7,10>, <8,10>, <9,11>, <9,12>, <9,13>, <13,12>, <13,11>, <11,14>`.

From these edges, we can map the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: [1, 3, 4]
- Node 1: [0, 2, 3]
- Node 2: [1, 5, 6, 7]
- Node 3: [1, 0, 4]
- Node 4: [0, 3]
- Node 5: [2, 8, 10]
- Node 6: [2, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- Node 7: [2, 6, 8, 10]
- Node 8: [5, 6, 7, 10]
- Node 9: [6, 10, 11, 12, 13]
- Node 10: [6, 5, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 11: [9, 13, 14]
- Node 12: [9, 13]
- Node 13: [9, 12, 11]
- Node 14: [11]

### Step 2: Perform BFS starting from node 1
- **Level 0**: [1]
- **Level 1**: [0, 2, 3] (neighbors of 1)
- **Level 2**: [4, 5, 6, 7] (neighbors of 0, 2, 3)
- **Level 3**: [8, 9, 10] (neighbors of 4, 5, 6, 7)
- **Level 4**: [11, 12, 13] (neighbors of 8, 9, 10)
- **Level 5**: [14] (neighbor of 11)

The shortest path from node 1 to node 14 is found when node 14 is first reached at level 5. The path is:  
`[1 → 2 → 6 → 9 → 11 → 14]`.

### Step 3: Verify against the options
- **Option A**: `[1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 9, 11, 14]` — Longer than the shortest path.
- **Option B**: `[1, 2, 5, 10, 6, 9, 11, 14]` — Longer than the shortest path.
- **Option C**: `[1, 3, 0, 4, 2, 6, 9, 11, 14]` — Longer than the shortest path.
- **Option D**: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 14]` — Invalid, as there is no direct edge between 10 and 14.
- **Option E**: `[1, 2, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9, 11, 14]` — Longer than the shortest path.
- **Option F**: `[1, 3, 4, 0, 2, 5, 8, 10, 9, 11, 14]` — Longer than the shortest path.
- **Option G**: `[1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 14]` — Longer than the shortest path.
- **Option H**: `[1, 3, 4, 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 14]` — Longer than the shortest path.
- **Option I**: `[1, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 10, 9, 11, 14]` — Longer than the shortest path.
- **Option J**: `[1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 14]` — Matches the shortest path found.

### Final Answer:
The shortest path from node 1 to node 14 is **[1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 14]**.
