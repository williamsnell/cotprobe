Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about primary prevention and its facets. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Primary prevention is about preventing disease before it occurs, right? I think it's divided into different categories based on the target population. Oh wait, I remember something about universal, selective, and indicative prevention. 

Wait, universal prevention is aimed at the general population, like everyone. For example, campaigns to reduce smoking or promote healthy eating. Selective prevention targets specific groups that are at higher risk. Maybe like providing folic acid supplements to pregnant women to prevent birth defects. Then there's indicative prevention, which is for individuals who have a higher risk based on certain indicators, like family history or genetic factors. So that would be more personalized.

Looking at the options, option E says "Universal, selective, and indicative." That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure. 

Option A: Universal, selective, and preventive. Wait, 'preventive' seems redundant because primary prevention is already a form of prevention. Plus, I don't recall 'preventive' as a category here.

Option B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. No, those are different levels of prevention, not the facets within primary.

Option C: Primary, secondary, and quaternary. Again, these are different levels, not the types within primary prevention.

Option D: General, selective, indicative. 'General' might be similar to universal, but I'm not sure if that's the correct term used.

Option E: Universal, selective, indicative. Yeah, that's what I was thinking earlier.

Option F: Primary, universal, indicative. Wait, primary is the overall category, so the facets would be universal, selective, etc. So F is mixing levels with facets.

Options G, H, I, J: Let me glance. G has specific instead of selective. H is about different levels. I mixes primary with selective and tertiary, which isn't right. J is 'none of the above,' but I think E is correct, so J isn't needed.

So I believe the correct answer is option E.

The question asks about the facets of primary prevention. Primary prevention aims to prevent disease before it occurs and is categorized based on the target population. The correct facets are:

1. **Universal prevention**: Targets the general population (e.g., public health campaigns).  
2. **Selective prevention**: Focuses on high-risk groups (e.g., specific interventions for at-risk individuals).  
3. **Indicative prevention**: Targets individuals with specific risk factors or indicators (e.g., personalized interventions).  

Among the options provided, **Option E: Universal, selective, and indicative** correctly identifies these facets. Other options either mix different levels of prevention or use incorrect terminology.  

Answer: E
