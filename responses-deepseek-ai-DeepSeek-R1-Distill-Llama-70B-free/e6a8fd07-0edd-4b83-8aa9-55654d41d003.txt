Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Ty has 12 weeks to read a certain number of books, and he spends 2 weeks reading each book. The question is asking which expression Ty can use to find the total number of books he'll read. The options are A through J, but I don't need to look at them all right away. Let me think step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. Ty has a limited amount of time—12 weeks—and each book takes him 2 weeks to read. So the problem is about finding out how many books he can finish in that time. 

Hmm, so this sounds like a division problem. Because if each book takes 2 weeks, then the number of books he can read is the total time divided by the time per book. So 12 weeks divided by 2 weeks per book. That makes sense because division helps find out how many groups fit into a larger group.

Wait, let me make sure. If he reads one book in two weeks, then in 12 weeks, how many sets of two weeks are there? That's exactly what division does. So 12 divided by 2 equals 6. That would mean he can read 6 books. But looking at the options, I need to find the expression that represents this calculation.

Let me look at the options now. Option A is 2/12, which would give 1/6. That doesn't make sense because he can read more than one book. Option B is 2 multiplied six times, which is 64. That's way too high. Option C is 2 added six times, which is 12. But 12 is the total weeks, not the number of books. So probably not the right choice.

Option D is 12 minus 2 six times, but wait, if I subtract 2 each time, that would be subtracting a total of 12 (since 2*6=12) from 12, which gives zero. That can't be right because he can read books, so the number shouldn't be zero. Option E is 12 plus 2 seven times. That would be 12 + 14 = 26. That doesn't make sense either because adding time doesn't relate to the number of books.

Option F is 12 minus 2, which is 10. But 10 weeks would still leave time for more books. It doesn't give the total count. Option G is 12 multiplied by 2, which is 24. That's more than the total weeks he has, so that can't be right. Option H is 12 plus 12, which is 24 again. Same problem as G.

Option I is 12 minus 2 six times. Let me calculate that: 12 -2 is 10, minus another 2 is 8, then 6, 4, 2, 0. So that's subtracting 2 six times, which totals subtracting 12. So 12-12=0. Again, zero books? That doesn't make sense because he should be able to read several books.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me go back. The correct approach is 12 divided by 2. Which option represents that? Let's see. None of the options explicitly show 12 divided by 2. Wait, the options are A: 2/12, which is 1/6. That's the inverse. Oh, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Because if I have 12 weeks and each book takes 2 weeks, the number of books is 12/2=6.

Looking again, none of the options directly show 12/2. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each option again.

Option A: 2/12 is 1/6, which is 0.166... Not 6. So no.

Option B: 2^6 is 64, which is too big.

Option C: 2*6=12. No, that's 12, which is the total weeks.

Option D: 12-2-2-2-2-2-2. Wait, that's 12 minus 2 six times. 12 - (2*6) = 12-12=0. No.

Option E: 12 +2 seven times. 12 + 14=26. No.

Option F: 12-2=10. No.

Option G: 12*2=24. No.

Option H: 12+12=24. No.

Option I: 12-2-2-2-2-2-2=0. No.

Wait a minute, maybe the correct answer isn't explicitly listed as 12/2, but perhaps I'm missing an option. Let me check the options again.

Oh, I think I might have missed an option. Let me see the options again as given in the question.

The options are:

A: 2 / 12

B: 2*2*2*2*2*2

C: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

D: 12 – 2 – 2 – 2

E: 12 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

F: 12 – 2

G: 12 * 2

H: 12 + 12

I: 12 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2

Wait, so none of these options are 12 divided by 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to subtract 2 each time until you run out of weeks, which would give the number of books.

Wait, for example, each book takes 2 weeks. So in 12 weeks, how many times can he subtract 2 weeks? That is, he can read a book every 2 weeks. So the number of books is 12 divided by 2, which is 6. But none of the options are 12/2. So perhaps the correct way is to represent it as 12 ÷ 2, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the options represent it as 12 divided by 2 in a different way, but I don't see it.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use division, but the options provided don't include a division symbol. So perhaps I'm looking for an option that represents division through subtraction. Like, how many times can you subtract 2 from 12 until you reach zero.

Looking at option I: 12 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2. Let's compute that. 12 minus 2 is 10, minus another 2 is 8, then 6, 4, 2, 0. So that's six subtractions of 2. So that's 6 books. Because each subtraction represents one book. So if you subtract 2 six times, you get zero, but the number of subtractions is 6, which is the number of books.

So the expression would be 12 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2, which is option I. Because each subtraction of 2 represents reading one book. So the total number of books is 6, which is how many times you subtracted 2.

Wait, but actually, when you subtract 2 six times from 12, you end up with zero, but the count of subtractions is six. So the expression in option I equals zero, but the number of books is six. So perhaps the expression isn't directly giving the number, but the number of subtractions does. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it as the initial number of weeks, 12, and each book takes 2 weeks. So the number of books is 12 divided by 2, which is 6. But looking at the options, none of them directly present 12/2. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, looking again, option A is 2/12. That's 1/6, which is not the same as 12/2. So that's not it.

Option B is 2^6, which is 64. That's not 6.

Option C is 2+2+2+2+2+2, which is 12. That's the total weeks, not the number of books.

Option D is 12-2-2-2. So that's 12-6=6. Wait, wait, 12-2 is 10, then 10-2 is 8, 8-2 is 6. So three subtractions of 2, which equals 6. So 12-2-2-2 equals 6. So that's 3 books, because each subtraction is a book. But the correct number is 6 books, so this can't be right.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Each subtraction of 2 represents one book. So if he subtracts 2 once, that's one book. Subtracting twice is two books, and so on. So if the expression is 12-2-2-2, that's three subtractions, meaning three books, which would take 6 weeks. But Ty has 12 weeks, so he can read six books. So that expression would only account for three books.

So the correct number of subtractions should be six times. So 12-2-2-2-2-2-2, which is option I. Because that's six subtractions, each representing one book, totaling six books. So the expression equals zero, but the number of subtractions is six, which is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of books is 12 divided by 2, which is 6. But none of the options directly show 12/2. So perhaps the answer is not explicitly there. But wait, looking again, option I is 12 minus 2 six times, which represents six books. So even though the result is zero, the count of subtractions is six, which is the number of books.

So among the options given, option I is the correct expression because it represents subtracting 2 six times, each subtraction corresponding to one book. Therefore, the total number of books is six.
</think>

Ty has 12 weeks to read books, and each book takes 2 weeks to complete. To determine how many books he can read, we need to divide the total time (12 weeks) by the time per book (2 weeks). This calculation, \( 12 \div 2 \), equals 6 books. However, none of the options explicitly show \( 12 \div 2 \). 

Instead, option I (\( 12 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 \)) represents subtracting 2 weeks six times, where each subtraction corresponds to reading one book. While the result of this expression is 0, the number of subtractions (6) reflects the total number of books Ty can read. Thus, option I correctly represents the process of determining the number of books.
