Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to approximate the area under a curve using the trapezoidal rule. The function f(x) is given at specific points, and I have to use n=4 subintervals between x=0 and x=8. Hmm, I remember that the trapezoidal rule is a method for numerical integration, which means it's a way to estimate the area under a curve when you can't solve it exactly with integrals.

First, I think I should figure out what each subinterval looks like. Since the total interval is from 0 to 8 and n=4, each subinterval should have a width of (8-0)/4 = 2. That makes sense because the given points are at x=0,2,4,6,8, each two units apart. So each trapezoid will span two units on the x-axis.

Now, the trapezoidal rule formula, if I remember correctly, is something like the sum of the function values at the endpoints of each subinterval multiplied by the width, all divided by 2. Wait, more accurately, the formula for n subintervals is (Δx/2) * [f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + ... + 2f(xₙ₋₁) + f(xₙ)]. Oh right, because the first and last terms are only counted once, and the middle terms are multiplied by 2.

Let me list out the given function values:

f(0) =3

f(2)=7

f(4)=11

f(6)=9

f(8)=3

So for n=4, there are 5 points (since n+1 points are needed). The Δx is 2, as I figured earlier.

Plugging into the formula:

Area ≈ (Δx / 2) * [f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + 2f(x₃) + f(x₄)]

Substituting the values:

= (2/2) * [3 + 2*7 + 2*11 + 2*9 + 3]

Simplify the 2/2 to 1, so it's just:

[3 + 14 + 22 + 18 +3]

Let me compute that step by step. 3 +14 is 17, plus 22 is 39, plus 18 is 57, plus 3 is 60.

Wait, that gives 60. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 60.0. But wait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, no, wait a second. Because the width is 2, right, and the formula is (Δx/2) multiplied by the sum. So wait, Δx is 2, so Δx/2 is 1. So the sum inside is 3 + (2*7) + (2*11) + (2*9) +3.

Let me compute the sum again:

3 + (2*7) = 3+14=17

17 + (2*11)=17+22=39

39 + (2*9)=39+18=57

57 +3=60.

So (2/2)*60 = 1*60=60. So the area is 60.0, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I might mix up the number of intervals. Let me think again: n is the number of subintervals, which is 4. So the number of trapezoids is 4, each covering 2 units. So the computation should be correct.

Alternatively, I can think of each trapezoid and compute individually. Let's see:

Each trapezoid has two parallel sides (the function values at the endpoints) and the height is Δx.

First trapezoid (x=0 to x=2): (3 +7)/2 *2 = (10)/2 *2 =10.

Second trapezoid (x=2 to4): (7+11)/2 *2 = 18/2 *2=18.

Third (x=4 to6): (11+9)/2 *2=20/2 *2=20.

Fourth (x=6 to8): (9+3)/2 *2=12/2 *2=12.

Now sum them up:10+18=28; 28+20=48; 48+12=60. Same result.

So yes, the area is 60.0, which is option B.

To approximate the area under the curve \( y = f(x) \) between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 8 \) using the trapezoidal rule with \( n = 4 \) subintervals, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the width of each subinterval**:  
   The total interval is \( [0, 8] \), and with \( n = 4 \), the width of each subinterval is:  
   \[
   \Delta x = \frac{8 - 0}{4} = 2
   \]

2. **Identify the function values at the specified points**:  
   The given values are:  
   \[
   f(0) = 3, \, f(2) = 7, \, f(4) = 11, \, f(6) = 9, \, f(8) = 3
   \]

3. **Apply the trapezoidal rule formula**:  
   The trapezoidal rule for \( n \) subintervals is:  
   \[
   \text{Area} \approx \frac{\Delta x}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 2f(x_3) + f(x_4) \right]
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Area} \approx \frac{2}{2} \left[ 3 + 2(7) + 2(11) + 2(9) + 3 \right]
   \]  
   Simplify the terms inside the brackets:  
   \[
   3 + 14 + 22 + 18 + 3 = 60
   \]  
   Thus, the area is:  
   \[
   \text{Area} \approx 1 \cdot 60 = 60
   \]

4. **Verify the result by summing individual trapezoids**:  
   Each trapezoid's area is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Area of a trapezoid} = \frac{\text{sum of parallel sides}}{2} \cdot \Delta x
   \]  
   - First trapezoid (\( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \)):  
     \[
     \frac{3 + 7}{2} \cdot 2 = 10
     \]  
   - Second trapezoid (\( x = 2 \) to \( x = 4 \)):  
     \[
     \frac{7 + 11}{2} \cdot 2 = 18
     \]  
   - Third trapezoid (\( x = 4 \) to \( x = 6 \)):  
     \[
     \frac{11 + 9}{2} \cdot 2 = 20
     \]  
   - Fourth trapezoid (\( x = 6 \) to \( x = 8 \)):  
     \[
     \frac{9 + 3}{2} \cdot 2 = 12
     \]  
   Adding these areas:  
   \[
   10 + 18 + 20 + 12 = 60
   \]

Both methods confirm that the approximate area under the curve is \( 60.0 \).
