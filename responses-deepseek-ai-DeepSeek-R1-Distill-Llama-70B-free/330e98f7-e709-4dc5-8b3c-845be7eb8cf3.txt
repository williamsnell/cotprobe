Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about GARCH models and what features of financial asset returns they can capture. Hmm, I remember GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. It's used to model volatility in financial time series, right?

The question lists four features: i) fat tails, ii) leverage effects, iii) volatility clustering, iv) volatility affecting returns. And the options are various combinations of these. I need to figure out which of these a standard GARCH(1,1) model can capture.

Let me think about each feature one by one. 

i) Fat tails in return distribution: GARCH models often assume conditional normal distribution, but the residuals can have leptokurtosis, meaning fat tails. Even if the conditional distribution is normal, the unconditional distribution tends to have fatter tails due to the clustering of volatility. So GARCH can capture fat tails to some extent. So i is probably yes.

ii) Leverage effects: Leverage effect refers to the phenomenon where volatility increases in response to negative returns more than positive ones. The standard GARCH model, though, doesn't account for this because it treats positive and negative shocks symmetrically. To include leverage, you need an asymmetric model like GJR-GARCH. So GARCH(1,1) can't capture leverage effects. So ii is no.

iii) Volatility clustering: Yes, this is exactly what GARCH models are designed for. Volatility clustering means periods of high volatility are followed by more high volatility, and low followed by low. GARCH captures this through the lagged variance terms in the model. So iii is yes.

iv) Volatility affecting returns: This would mean that past volatility influences current returns. But in the standard GARCH model, the mean equation is typically separate from the variance equation. Unless you have a model where variance (volatility) explicitly affects the mean, like adding a term for lagged variance in the mean equation, the standard GARCH doesn't include this. So iv is no.

Wait, but wait. Are there cases where GARCH includes volatility in the mean? Oh, right, sometimes the mean equation might include the lagged variance as a regressor. But the standard GARCH(1,1) model usually refers to the variance equation only, without including volatility terms in the mean. So unless specified, the standard model doesn't capture iv.

So putting it together. The features captured are i and iii. So which options include i and iii but exclude ii and iv?

Looking at the options:

Option C: (i) and (iii) only. That fits.

Wait another thought: in GARCH, the conditional variance is modeled, which leads to the unconditional distribution having fat tails, so i is captured. So yes, C is correct.

Wait, but the question says "features of financial asset return time-series could be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model". So the features are in the data, which GARCH models can capture.

So the correct options are i, iii. So answer C: i and iii only.

A standard GARCH(1,1) model is designed to capture specific features of financial asset return time-series. Here's an analysis of the features listed:

1. **Fat tails in the return distribution (i):** GARCH models can capture fat tails because the unconditional distribution of returns often exhibits leptokurtosis due to volatility clustering. While the conditional distribution is typically assumed to be normal, the clustering effect leads to fatter tails in the unconditional distribution. Thus, GARCH can capture this feature.

2. **Leverage effects (ii):** Leverage effects refer to the asymmetric relationship between negative returns and increased volatility. However, the standard GARCH(1,1) model treats positive and negative shocks symmetrically and does not account for leverage effects. To capture this, an asymmetric model like GJR-GARCH is required. Therefore, GARCH(1,1) cannot capture leverage effects.

3. **Volatility clustering (iii):** Volatility clustering, where periods of high volatility are followed by high volatility and low volatility by low volatility, is a primary feature that GARCH models are designed to capture. The model achieves this through the inclusion of lagged variance terms. Thus, GARCH(1,1) can capture volatility clustering.

4. **Volatility affecting returns (iv):** This feature implies that past volatility influences current returns. However, in the standard GARCH(1,1) model, the mean and variance equations are typically separate, and volatility does not explicitly affect returns unless specified. Therefore, GARCH(1,1) does not capture this feature.

Based on the above analysis, the standard GARCH(1,1) model captures **(i) Fat tails** and **(iii) Volatility clustering**, but not **(ii) Leverage effects** or **(iv) Volatility affecting returns**. The correct answer is:

**C: (i) and (iii) only**
