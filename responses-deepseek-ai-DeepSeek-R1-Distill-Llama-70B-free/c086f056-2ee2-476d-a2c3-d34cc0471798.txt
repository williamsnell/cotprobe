Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about computing a price index, money GNP, and real GNP for several years. The economy only produces one good, product X, and the data is given in a table. Year 1 is the base year for the price index.

Let me first understand what each part requires.

Part a) Compute the price index using Year 1 as the base (Year 1 = 100%). I remember that the price index is calculated by taking the current year's price divided by the base year's price, multiplied by 100. So for each year, it's (Price in that year / Price in Year 1) * 100.

Part b) Compute the unadjusted, or money GNP. Since the economy only produces one good, GNP would just be the quantity produced multiplied by the price. So for each year, Units of Output multiplied by Price of X.

Part c) Compute the adjusted, or real GNP. Real GNP is calculated using the price index. The formula is (Money GNP / Price Index for that year) * 100, but since Year 1 is the base, I think in this case, real GNP for each year would be (Money GNP of that year / Price Index of that year) * (Price Index of Year 1). But since the base is Year 1, the Price Index for Year 1 is 100, so real GNP would be (Money GNP / Price Index) * 100. Wait, but maybe it's simpler because money GNP is nominal, and real is adjusted for inflation. So real GNP = (Nominal GNP) divided by (price index/100). So real GNP = (Nominal GNP) * (100 / Price Index).

Let me jot down the data more clearly. The table is:

Year | Units | Price
-----|-------|------
1   | 5     | $10
2   | 27    | $20
3   | 38    | $25
4   | 41    | $30
5   | 51    | $128

Wait, wait. Wait, looking back, the data in the question is written as:

Year 1: Units 5, Price $10

Year 2: Units 27, Price $20

Year 3: Units 38, Price $25

Year 4: Units 41, Price $30

Year 5: Units 51, Price $128.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because the user wrote the table as:

Year 1: 5, $10

Year 2: 27, $20

Year 3: 38, $25

Year 4: 41, $30

Year 5: 51, $128.

Okay, so for each year, Units and Price are given.

Now, let me compute each part.

Starting with part a: Price index for each year, with Year 1 as base.

The formula is (Price / Base Year Price) * 100.

Year 1: (10 /10)*100 = 100%. But the options might not include this, but the question asks for Year 2,3,4,5.

Year 2: $20. So (20/10)*100 = 200%.

Year 3: $25. (25/10)*100=250%.

Year4: $30. (30/10)*100=300%.

Year5: $128. (128/10)*100=1280%. Wait, that's way higher than any options I'm seeing. Wait, the options provided don't have 1280% for Year 5. Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong. Wait, no, looking at the options, none of them have such a high number for Year 5. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the data.

Wait, looking back at the question, the table is written as:

Year 1: Units of Output 5, Price of X $10.

Year 2: Units 27, Price $20.

Year 3: Units 38, Price $25.

Year 4: Units 41, Price $30.

Year 5: Units 51, Price $128.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if I compute the price index for Year 5, it would be (128/10)*100 = 1280%, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm misreading the table.

Wait, perhaps the prices are not in dollars but some other unit? Or maybe I made a mistake in the price values.

Wait, let me recheck the user's input. The user wrote:

Year 1: 5 $10

Year 2: 27 $20

Year 3: 38 $25

Year 4: 41 $30

Year 5: 51 $128.

Yes, that's correct. So the price in Year 5 is $128, which would make the price index 1280% for that year. But looking at the options, the highest price index in any option for Year 5 is 500% in option F and J, 460% in G, etc. So none of the options seem to have 1280%, which suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the prices are actually in a different way. Maybe the prices are in a different format. Let me re-examine the user's question.

Looking again, the user wrote:

Year 1: 5 $10

Year 2: 27 $20

Year 3: 38 $25

Year 4: 41 $30

Year 5: 51 $128.

Wait, maybe the price for Year 5 is 12.8 instead of 128? Because that would make more sense with the options. But as per the user's input, it's 128. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the price is miswritten, but I don't think I can assume that. So perhaps the options have a typo, but I have to proceed with the given data.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recalculate the price index for each year.

Year 1: (10 /10)*100 = 100%.

Year 2: (20/10)*100=200%.

Year3: (25/10)*100=250%.

Year4: (30/10)*100=300%.

Year5: (128/10)*100=1280%.

So the price indices would be 200, 250, 300, 1280 for Years 2 to 5.

But looking at the options, none of the options have 1280 for Year 5. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option A for part a) shows Year 2:200%, Year3:250%, Year4:300%, Year5:280%. Wait, but according to my calculation, Year5 is 1280%. So that's way off.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the price for Year5 is not $128, but perhaps $12.8, which would make the price index (12.8/10)=128%, which is 1280%, but no, 12.8 is 128% of 10. Wait, wait, 12.8 is 128% of 10. So 12.8/10 *100 = 128%, not 1280. So perhaps I misread the price for Year5 as $128 instead of $12.8.

Wait, let me check the original question again. The user wrote:

Year5: 41030 $128.

Wait, perhaps that's a typo, and the price is 12.8, not 128. Because 128 would make the price index too high, and none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the price is 12.8, and I misread it as 128. Let me re-examine the data.

Looking back, I see: "Year 5: 51 $128". So it's definitely 128, unless perhaps the "$1.28" or something. But no, the user wrote $128. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but I have to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the price index is. Alternatively, perhaps the price index is computed differently, such as using the average or something else, but I don't think so. The standard price index uses the base year.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the price index is computed as (current price / base price) without multiplying by 100. But that would make it a ratio, not a percentage. But the question says to compute in percent, so I think 200%, etc., is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different base year. No, the question says Year1 is the base, so that's correct.

So perhaps the problem is that in the options, the price index for Year5 is 280%, which would imply that the price is 28 dollars. Because 28/10=2.8, 2.8*100=280%.

Wait, Year5's price is $128, so that would make the price index 1280%, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the data.

Wait, perhaps the Units of Output are wrong. Let me check the user's data again.

The user wrote:

Year 1: Units 5, Price $10

Year 2: Units 27, Price $20

Year 3: Units 38, Price $25

Year4: Units 41, Price $30

Year5: Units 51, Price $128.

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps the options are wrong, but I have to go with the options given.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me proceed to compute the other parts and see if any option matches.

Part b: Compute the money GNP. Since it's only one good, GNP is quantity multiplied by price.

Year1: 5 units * $10 = $50.

Year2:27 * $20= $540? Wait, 27*20=540. No, wait, 27*20 is 540, but in the options, the money GNP for Year2 is, for example, option A: $140, which is much lower.

Wait, that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the units are in thousands or something. Let me check the original question again. No, it says Units of Output as numbers: Year1 is 5, Year2 is 27, etc. So I think it's 5 units, 27 units, etc.

Wait, but 5*10=50, which is $50. That's correct. Year2:27 *20=540. But looking at the options, for example, option A's money GNP for Year2 is $140, which is way less than 540. So that's inconsistent.

Wait, am I missing something? Maybe the price is per unit, but perhaps it's per unit in a different way. Or perhaps I've misread the units as, say, thousands, making them 5,000, 27,000, etc. But that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the money GNP is computed as (Units * Price) for each year, but perhaps the units are in different terms. Wait, no, the problem says the economy produces only product X, so GNP is just the total value, which is Units * Price.

So for Year1:5*10=50.

Year2:27*20=540.

Year3:38*25=950.

Year4:41*30=1230.

Year5:51*128=6538.

Wait, but in the options, money GNPs are much lower. For example, option A's money GNP for Year1 is $50, which matches, but Year2 is $140. So 27*20=540, but option A has 140. So that's way off.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data. Maybe the Units are in different terms. Wait, perhaps the Units are in thousands, so 5 units would be 5,000 units. Let me check that.

If that's the case:

Year1:5,000 units * $10 = $50,000.

But that's way higher than the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the prices are in hundreds of dollars. So $10 would be $1, $20 would be $2, etc. But that would make the price index for Year5:12.8 dollars, which would be 128% of $10. Let's explore that.

Wait, if the price is actually in hundreds, so Year1 price is $10 (which is $0.10 in real terms?), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the prices are miswritten. Alternatively, perhaps the data in the table is in different units, but the problem statement doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the Units of Output as the price. No, that doesn't make sense. The Units of Output are the quantity, and Price is the price per unit.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again to see if any of them match the money GNP as I calculated.

Looking at option A: money GNP for Year1 is 50, which matches. Year2 is 140. But my calculation for Year2 is 27*20=540. So that's way off. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data.

Wait, perhaps the Units of Output are in thousands, but the prices are in dollars per unit. Let's try that.

Year1:5,000 units * $10 = 50,000. But that's way higher than any option.

Alternatively, maybe the Units are as given, and the prices are in hundreds. So Year1 price is $10, which would be $0.10 per unit. Then, Year2 price is $20, which is $0.20 per unit.

Let me try that.

So for Year1:5 units * $0.10 = $0.50. But that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the prices are in cents. So $10 is 1000 cents, which is $10, that's same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the data is presented differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the money GNP is computed as (Units)*(Price/100). So for example, Year1:5*(10/100)=0.5, but that would be in dollars, which is $0.50, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the prices are index numbers already, but no, the question says to compute the price index.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to compute all parts correctly and then see which option matches.

So, let me recompute everything carefully.

Price Index (a):

Year1: (10/10)*100 = 100%.

Year2: (20/10)*100=200%.

Year3: (25/10)*100=250%.

Year4: (30/10)*100=300%.

Year5: (128/10)*100=1280%.

But none of the options have 1280%, so perhaps there's a mistake in the data or options.

Money GNP (b):

Year1:5 *10 =50.

Year2:27 *20=540.

Year3:38 *25=950.

Year4:41 *30=1230.

Year5:51 *128=6538.

But the options have much lower money GNPs. For example, option A's money GNP for Year2 is 140, which is 27*20=540, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm missing a decimal point somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the Units are in hundreds. So Year1:5 units = 500 units. Then:

Year1:500 *10=5000.

Year2:2700 *20=54000.

But that's way higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is in thousands of units and dollars are in thousands as well. So for Year1, 5 units (thousands) = 5,000 units, and price $10 (thousand dollars per unit) would be $10,000 per unit. Then 5,000 * $10,000 = $50,000,000, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the prices are in some scaled-down unit. Wait, perhaps the price is in hundreds, so $10 is $0.10. Then:

Year1:5 *0.10 = $0.50.

Year2:27 *0.20 = $5.40.

Year3:38*0.25=9.50.

Year4:41 *0.30=12.30.

Year5:51 *1.28=65.28.

But these numbers are too low and don't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the Units are in some other unit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct approach is to proceed with the data as given, despite the options not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the price in Year5 is 12.8, not 128, which would make the price index 128%, which is 1280% when considering Year1 as 100%.

Wait, if the price in Year5 is 12.8, then the price index would be (12.8/10)*100=128%, which is 1280% as I thought earlier. But none of the options match that.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating something else. Let me try to compute real GNP as well.

Real GNP (c):

Real GNP is computed by dividing the money GNP by the price index (in decimal form).

So for each year:

Year1: Money GNP =50. Price index=100% or 1.0.

Real GNP =50/1=50.

Year2: Money GNP=540. Price index=200% or 2.0.

Real GNP=540/2=270.

Year3: Money GNP=950. Price index=250% or 2.5.

Real GNP=950/2.5=380.

Year4:1230 /3=410.

Year5:6538 /12.8=?

Wait, 6538 divided by 12.8:

12.8 × 512 = 6553.6, which is a bit higher than 6538. So approximately 512.

But none of the real GNPs in the options are anywhere near these numbers. So perhaps the money GNP is computed differently.

Wait, perhaps the money GNP is not Units * Price, but some other measure. Alternatively, maybe the data is misrepresented.

Wait, perhaps the Units are in thousands, and the prices are as given. Let's try that.

Year1:5,000 units * $10=50,000.

Year2:27,000 *20=540,000.

Year3:38,000 *25=950,000.

Year4:41,000 *30=1,230,000.

Year5:51,000 *128=6,528
