Question:

Describe Sherman's and Key's (1932) study of the Hollow Children. What do their findings indicate about the effect of environment on intellectual development?

Options:

A: The study found no significant findings
B: Environment has no effect on intellectual development
C: The study shows that a deprived environment only affects intellectual development until a certain age
D: The study concluded that intellectual development is solely determined by genetics, not environment
E: The findings indicate that a stimulating environment has no impact on intellectual development
F: Sherman and Key's study indicates that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development
G: The research indicates that changes in the environment can reverse any prior intellectual development deficits
H: A deprived environment enhances intellectual development
I: Sherman and Key's research suggests that intellectual development is primarily influenced by peer interactions, not environment
J: Sherman and Key found that intellectual development is equally impacted by both deprived and enriched environments

Okay, so I've got this question about Sherman's and Key's 1932 study on the Hollow Children. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

I remember that the term "Hollow Children" might refer to a group of children studied in terms of their environment and its effects on their development. Sherman and Key's study was probably looking into how environmental factors influence intellectual growth. 

Wait, I think this study was about orphaned children. Or maybe children from deprived backgrounds. The idea was to see if their environment affected their intelligence or development. I'm pretty sure they were comparing children in different settings, maybe those in enriched environments versus those in deprived ones.

So the study must have shown that environment plays a role. But how? Did they find that a stimulating environment helped, while a deprived one hurt? Oh right, I think the conclusion was that a deprived environment can negatively impact intellectual development. Because if kids are in a poor environment with little stimulation, their cognitive abilities might not develop as well as their peers in better environments.

Looking at the options now:

Option F says that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect, which aligns with what I was thinking. Option G suggests that changing environments can reverse deficits, which I'm not sure about; some studies show that early intervention can help, but I'm not certain if Sherman and Key specifically found that. Also, some options like B and D suggest that environment has no effect or that it's all genetics, which doesn't sound right because I remember the study supporting environmental influence.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F: Sherman and Key's study indicates that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development.

The study by Sherman and Key (1932) on the Hollow Children examined the impact of environmental factors on intellectual development. Their findings suggested that children raised in deprived environments experienced negative effects on their intellectual growth compared to those in more stimulating environments. This indicates that environmental conditions play a significant role in shaping intellectual development, particularly highlighting the detrimental effects of deprivation.

F: Sherman and Key's study indicates that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development.

Answer: F
