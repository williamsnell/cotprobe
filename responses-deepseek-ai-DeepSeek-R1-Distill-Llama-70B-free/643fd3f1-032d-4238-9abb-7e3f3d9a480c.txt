Question:

What is meant by the marginal product of aproductive factor?

Options:

A: The total output produced by a single unit of a factor
B: The increase in total cost when one more unit of a factor is employed, holding all other factors constant
C: The cost of producing an additional unit of output
D: The amount by which total output increases due to the addition of one unit of a given factor while the amount used of other factors of production remains unchanged
E: The revenue generated from selling the output produced by an additional unit of a factor
F: The ratio of total output to the number of units of a factor used
G: The added value of a unit of output
H: The average output produced by all units of a factor
I: The decrease in total output when one unit of a factor is removed
J: The profit earned from the production of one more unit of output using an additional unit of a factor

Okay, so I have this question about economics, specifically on the concept of marginal product. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking what the marginal product of a productive factor means. The options are from A to J. I remember that marginal product is related to production factors like labor, capital, etc., and how adding one more unit affects output.

Wait, marginal product, I think it's about the additional output you get when you add one more unit of a factor, keeping others constant. So like, if you have a factory and you add another worker, the extra output that worker produces is their marginal product.

Looking at the options:

Option A says total output by one unit of a factor. No, that sounds more like total product, not marginal. Because marginal is the addition, not the total.

Option B: Increase in total cost when adding a factor. Oh, wait, that's marginal cost, not product. Marginal cost is about the cost increase, so B is probably not the right answer.

Option C: Cost of producing an extra unit of output. That's marginal cost again. Or maybe average cost? No, C is definitely about cost, not output.

Option D: The increase in total output from adding one unit of a factor, others unchanged. That sounds exactly what I was thinking earlier. So D seems correct.

Option E: Revenue from selling extra output. That's more like marginal revenue, which is different. So E is about revenue, not output quantity.

Option F: Ratio of total output to factor units. That's average product, not marginal. Because marginal is about the change, not the average.

Option G: Added value of a unit of output. I'm not too sure, but that sounds like value added, maybe related to marginal utility or something else. Not the same as marginal product.

Option H: Average output per factor unit. Again, that's average product, not marginal.

Option I: Decrease in output when removing a unit. Wait, that's the same as marginal product, but in reverse. Because if adding one gives you MP, removing would decrease by MP. But I think in economics, MP is usually discussed as the addition, so I is just the negative, but the definition is about the addition, so D is the one.

Option J: Profit from producing one more unit using a factor. Profit would involve costs and revenues, so that's more like marginal profit, not just product.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D.

The marginal product of a productive factor refers to the additional output generated by adding one more unit of that factor while keeping all other factors constant. This concept is crucial in understanding production economics, as it helps determine the optimal use of resources.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** refers to total output by one unit of a factor, which is not marginal but total product.
- **B** describes marginal cost, not marginal product.
- **C** is about the cost of producing an additional unit of output, which relates to marginal cost.
- **D** correctly defines marginal product as the increase in total output from adding one unit of a factor, others unchanged.
- **E** refers to marginal revenue, which is about revenue, not output quantity.
- **F** describes average product, not marginal product.
- **G** is unrelated to the concept of marginal product.
- **H** refers to average product, not marginal product.
- **I** describes the decrease in output when removing a unit, which is the inverse of marginal product.
- **J** refers to marginal profit, not marginal product.

The correct answer is **D**, as it accurately captures the definition of marginal product.

Answer: D
