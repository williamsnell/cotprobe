Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the authoritarian personality and how it's measured. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which scale or test is used to measure the authoritarian personality. The options are from A to J, each with different names. I remember that authoritarian personality has something to do with traits like obedience to authority, conservatism, and maybe some aggression towards those who don't conform.

I think the most well-known scale for this is the California F Scale. I've heard of that before. F stands for fascist, right? So that's probably one of the options. Let me check the options. Option B is the California F (fascist) Scale. That sounds right.

Wait, but there are other options too. Option D mentions Authoritarianism Conservatism Traditionalism Scale. That's a mouthful. I'm not sure if that's a real thing or not. I think the more commonly known one is the F Scale.

Option I is the Social Dominance Orientation Scale. I remember that's a different concept, more about how people view social hierarchies and dominance. It's related but not the same as authoritarianism.

Option A, Power Distance Index, sounds familiar too, but I think that's from Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. It's about how different cultures handle inequalities among people, not a personality test.

Option C is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. That's for personality types like introvert or extrovert, not related to authoritarianism.

Option E, Dictatorial Ideation Questionnaire, doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's a made-up option for the test. Option F, Authoritarian Dynamic Scale, sounds plausible, but I'm not sure if that's the one. I think the F Scale is more established.

Option G, Machiavellianism Attitude Inventory, measures manipulativeness and strategy, another of the dark triad traits but not the same as authoritarianism.

Option H, Rorschach Inkblot Test, is a projective psychological test where you interpret inkblots. It's used for assessing personality but not specifically authoritarian traits.

Option J is the Big Five Personality Test, which measures traits like openness, conscientiousness, etc. Not related to authoritarianism directly.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be the California F Scale, which is option B.

The authoritarian personality is typically measured using the California F (fascist) Scale, which assesses traits such as obedience to authority, conservatism, and aggression toward nonconformists. This scale is the most well-known and established tool for this purpose. Other options, while related to personality or social dynamics, do not specifically measure authoritarianism. 

Answer: B
