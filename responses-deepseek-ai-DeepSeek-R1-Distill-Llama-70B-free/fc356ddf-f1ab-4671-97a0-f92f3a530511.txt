Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the temperature rise of the human body. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that an average human produces about 10 MJ of heat each day. If the body were an isolated system with a mass of 65 kg and the heat capacity of water, what temperature rise would occur?

Right, I remember that heat capacity relates to how much the temperature changes when heat is added. Oh yeah, the formula is Q = m * c * ΔT, where Q is the heat, m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Wait, the body's heat capacity is that of water. Water's specific heat is 4.184 J/(g·K), right? But wait, the mass is in kg, so I should convert that to kg. Oh right, 4.184 J/(g·K) is the same as 4184 J/(kg·K) because 1 kg is 1000 grams.

So the given Q is 10 MJ. Let me make sure the units are compatible. Q is 10,000,000 J. Mass m is 65 kg. c is 4184 J/(kg·K). 

I need to solve for ΔT. So rearranging the formula: ΔT = Q / (m * c). 

Plugging in the numbers: Q is 10^7 J, m is 65 kg, c is 4184. So 10e7 / (65 * 4184) = ?

Let me calculate the denominator first. 65 * 4184 equals... let's see, 60*4184=250,  2*4184=8368, wait wait no, wait 65 is 60 +5. So 60 * 4184 = 60 *4000=240,000 and 60*184=11,040. So 240,000 + 11,040 = 251,040. Then 5 *4184=20,920. So 251,040 +20,920 = 271,960. So the denominator is 271,960.

So 10,000,000 / 271,960 ≈ let's see. Let me compute that. 10^7 is 10,000,000. Dividing by 271,960:

Hmm, 271,960 times 36 is about 9,790,560 (because 271,960 * 30 is 8,158,800; 271,960 *6 is 1,631,760; adding gives 9,790,560). So 36 would give us 9,790,560, which is just below 10 million. The difference is 209,440. So 209,440 / 271,960 ≈ 0.77. So approximately 36.77 degrees K.

Wait wait, but the options are in higher numbers. Let me double-check my calculations. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat capacity. Oh wait, wait! Wait, the specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g·K, right? So for 1 kg, it's 4184 J/kg·K. So that part was correct.

Wait, but let me recompute the denominator. 65 kg multiplied by 4184 J/(kg·K) gives J/K. 65 *4184: 60*4184=251,040 and 5*4184=20,920. So 251,040 +20,920= 271,960 J/K. So 10,000,000 / 271,960 = approximately 36.78 K.

Looking at the options, the closest option is not exact. Wait the options are:

A: +55K

B: +65

C: +42

D: +60

E: +37

F: +30

G: +25

H:+50

I:+45

J:+20

Wait, I'm getting about 36.78 K. Oh wait, but let me check my initial computation again.

Wait perhaps the question uses a different specific heat? Maybe the specific heat at a different condition, like for body temperature or something else. But the question says the heat capacity of water, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in another way. Let me recalculate 10^7 divided by (65 *4184).

Compute 65 *4184:

65 *4000 = 260,000

65 *184 = 11, 960? Wait, 184 *60=11,040, 184*5=920 → 11,040 +920=11,960. So 260,000 +11,960= 271,960 J/K.

So 10,000,000 / 271,960 = let me compute it more accurately.

271,960 * 36 = 9,790,560. So 10,000,000 -9,790,560= 209,440.

209,440 /271,960 ≈ 0.77. So 36.77 K.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 36.77. Wait the options don't have that. The closest is option C:42, or option I:45. Wait, am I missing something?

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Oh wait, wait. Wait the heat produced is 10 MJ per day. But the question is about the temperature rise each day. So perhaps the units are correct.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the body's initial temperature is, say, 37 degrees C, but I don't think that's relevant here because the question is about the change, not absolute temperature.

Wait another thought: Did I use the right value for the specific heat of water? Wait, I think the specific heat capacity of water is indeed about 4.184 J/g·K, so 4184 J/kg·K. Another possibility: Maybe the question expects the use of 4.186 instead, which is another common value. Let me try with 4186.

Then 65 *4186 = 65 *4000=260,000; 65 *186=12,090. So 260,000 +12,090=272,090. Then 10^7 /272,090 ≈ 36.76. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different unit for Q. Wait, the problem states 10 MJ. 10 MJ is 10,000,000 J, which is correct.

Wait wait, the options don't have 36. Maybe I made a mistake in the method. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the body is an isolated system, so all the heat produced goes into raising its temperature. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the latent heat or something else, but no, it's about heat capacity, so no phase change.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a miscalculation. Let me compute 10e6 (since 10 MJ is 10^7 J? Wait no, 1 MJ is 1e6 J. So 10 MJ is 10e6 J. Wait wait! Oh my God, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, 1 MJ is 10^6 J. So 10 MJ is 10 *1e6 = 1e7 J. So that's correct. So I was right the first time.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 36.7 K. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute 10^7 / (65*4184) → let me compute that more accurately.

Let me compute 65 *4184:

65 *4000 = 260,000

65 *184 = ?

184 *60 = 11,040

184 *5=920 → 11,040 +920=11,960.

So 260,000 +11,960=271,960.

So 10,000,000 / 271,960 ≈ let's compute this.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 1,000,000 / 27,196 ≈ let me compute 27,196 *36 = 979,056.

So 36 *27,196 = 979,056. Subtract that from 1,000,000 → 20,944.

So 20,944 /27,196 ≈ 0.77.

So 36.77 K. Hmm.

But the options are all higher than that, except E is +37, which is close. Wait, option E is +37 K.

Wait, wait, the calculation gives around 36.77, which is approximately 37 K. So the closest option would be E: +37 K.

Wait, but wait another possibility: perhaps the heat produced is 10 MJ per day, but the time factor doesn't matter here because we're considering the energy as all going into temperature change. So the calculation seems correct, and 37 K is the closest. So the answer would be E.
</think>

To calculate the temperature rise of the human body, we use the formula:

\[
Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the heat produced (\( 10 \, \text{MJ} = 10^7 \, \text{J} \)),
- \( m \) is the mass of the body (\( 65 \, \text{kg} \)),
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity of water (\( 4184 \, \text{J/(kg·K)} \)),
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature change.

Rearranging for \( \Delta T \):

\[
\Delta T = \frac{Q}{m \cdot c}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{10^7}{65 \cdot 4184}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
65 \cdot 4184 = 271,960 \, \text{J/K}
\]

Now divide:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{10^7}{271,960} \approx 36.77 \, \text{K}
\]

This result indicates a temperature rise of approximately \( 36.77 \, \text{K} \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( +37 \, \text{K} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
