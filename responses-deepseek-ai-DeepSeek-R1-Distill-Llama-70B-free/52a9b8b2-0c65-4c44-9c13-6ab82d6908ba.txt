Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the centripetal force required for a car to go around a curve. The car's weight is 3200 pounds, the radius of the curve is 880 feet, and the speed is 60 mph. Hmm, I remember that centripetal force has something to do with circular motion, right?

Wait, centripetal force is the force that makes an object move in a circular path. The formula I think is F = (m*v²)/r, where m is mass, v is velocity, and r is radius. But wait, I need to make sure all the units are correct because the given values are in pounds, feet, and mph. Oh boy, unit conversions might trip me up here.

First, I need to convert the car's weight into mass because the formula uses mass, not weight. Weight is given in pounds, which is a force. I remember that weight (W) equals mass (m) times gravity (g), so m = W/g. But wait, what's gravity in the right units?

Gravity on Earth is about 32 ft/s². Yeah, because in the English system, g is approximately 32.174 ft/s². So, m = 3200 lb / 32.174 ft/s². Let me calculate that. 3200 divided by 32 is 100, but since 32.174 is a bit more than 32, the mass would be a little less than 100. Let's see, 3200 / 32.174. Hmm, 32.174 times 100 is 3217.4, which is just a bit more than 3200. So maybe approximately 99.6 slugs? Because in the English system, mass is in slugs. Oh wait, I always get confused with units. Slugs are the unit of mass, right.

So m ≈ 99.6 slugs. Let me double-check. 32.174 * 100 = 3217.4 lb, which is more than 3200. So 3200 is 3200/3217.4 times 100, which is about 99.6% of 100. So m ≈ 99.6 slugs.

Next, the velocity is given in miles per hour, but I need it in feet per second to match the units. How do I convert 60 mph to ft/s? I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, 60 miles per hour is 60 * 5280 feet per 3600 seconds.

Let me compute that. 60 * 5280 = 316,800. Divided by 3600. Let's see, 316800 / 3600. Let me divide both by 100 first: 3168 / 36. 3168 ÷ 36. 36*88 is 3168 (because 36*90=3240, minus 36*2=72, so 3240-72=3168). So 88. So 60 mph is 88 ft/s. Oh wait, that can't be right. Wait, 60 mph is 88 ft/s? Because I've heard that before. Yeah, I think that's correct. So v = 88 ft/s.

Now, the radius is 880 feet, which is good because the units match (feet). So r = 880 ft.

Putting it all together, F = m*v²/r. Let me plug in the numbers.

m is approximately 99.6 slugs, v is 88 ft/s, r is 880 ft.

So F = (99.6) * (88)^2 / 880.

Wait, let's compute 88 squared first. 88 * 88. Let's see 80*80=6400, 80*8=640, 8*80=640, 8*8=64. So (80+8)^2 = 80² + 2*80*8 +8² = 6400 + 1280 +64 = 6400+1280=7680+64=7744. So 88² is 7744.

So F = (99.6) * 7744 / 880.

Hmm, let's compute 7744 divided by 880 first. Let me see, 880 * 8 is 7040, because 880*8=7040. 7744-7040=704. 704 is exactly 880 * 0.8 because 880*0.8=704. So 8.8 times 880 is 7744. So 7744/880=8.8.

So now F = 99.6 * 8.8.

Hmm, let's compute that. 100 *8.8 is 880, but since it's 99.6, which is 0.4 less than 100. So 0.4 *8.8=3.52. So subtract that from 880: 880 -3.52=876.48 pounds.

Wait, but wait a second. The car's weight is 3200 lb, so the centripetal force is about 876 lb? Let me check the options. Option A is 960, B is 800, C is 1100, D is 850, E is 880, F is 1020, G is 750, H is 950, I is 900, J is 1000.

Hmm, 876 is close to 880, which is option E. But let me think again because I approximated the mass as 99.6, but maybe I should be more precise.

Wait, let me recalculate the mass more accurately. The weight is 3200 lb. Gravity is 32.174 ft/s². So mass m = 3200 /32.174. Let me compute this accurately. 32.174 * 99 = 3185.626. 32.174 *99.5= 32.174*(100-0.5)=3217.4 -16.087=3201.313. Oh wait, 3201.313 is very close to 3200. So 99.5 slugs would be 3201.313 lb. So m is approximately 99.5 slugs, since 3200 is just a tiny bit less than 3201.313. So m ≈ 99.5 slugs.

So let's recalculate F with m=99.5.

F = (99.5) * (88)^2 /880.

88 squared is 7744, so 99.5 *7744= let's compute 100 *7744=774400, minus 0.5 *7744=3872. So 774400-3872=770528.

Then, divide by 880: 770528 /880.

Let me compute 880 * 875 = ?

Wait, maybe a better approach. Let's see: 880 * 875 = 880*(800+75) = 880*800=704000, 880*75=66,000. So total 704000 +66000=770,000. So 880*875=770,000. But our numerator is 770,528. So 770,528-770,000=528. So 528/880=0.6. So total is 875.6.

So F=875.6 lb. But wait, that doesn't match what I got earlier. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculations. Let me try again.

Wait, I think I messed up in computing 99.5 * (88^2 /880). Let me compute it differently.

88^2 is 7744, divided by 880 is 8.8. So 99.5 *8.8 = ?

99 *8.8 is 871.2, and 0.5*8.8=4.4. So 871.2+4.4=875.6 lb.

So that's approximately 875.6 lb. Looking at the options, the closest one is E: 880 lb. But wait, that's only 4.4 lb off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use more precise values without approximating so much.

Let me try to compute m exactly. m = 3200 /32.174.

Let me compute 3200 ÷32.174.

32.174 goes into 3200 how many times?

32.174 * 99 = 3200 - (32.174 * (100-99)) )= 32.174*(99) = 32.174*(100)-32.174.

Wait, 32.174*100=3217.4. So 3217.4 -32.174=3185.226.

So 32.174 *99=3185.226. The difference between 3200 and 3185.226 is 14.774. So how much more is needed beyond 99?

So, 14.774 /32.174 ≈ 0.4588. So m≈99.4588 slugs.

So m≈99.4588.

Now, compute F= m*v²/r.

v=88 ft/s.

v squared is 7744.

So F= (99.4588 *7744 ) /880.

Calculate 99.4588 *7744 first.

Let me compute that. 100 *7744=774400, subtract 0.5412 *7744.

0.5 *7744=3872, 0.0412 *7744= approx 319. So 3872 +319=4191. So subtract 4191 from 774400: 774400-4191=770209.

Now, divide 770209 by 880.

880 *875=770,000 as before. So 770209-770000=209. Now, 209/880= approx 0.2375. So total F≈875.2375 lb.

So approximately 875.24 lb.

Looking at the options, E is 880, which is 4.76 lb higher. But none of the options exactly match, and E is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations somewhere.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Maybe using the formula in terms of pounds-force.

Wait, another formula for centripetal force in the English system is F = (W * v²)/(g*r), where W is weight in pounds, v in ft/s, g in ft/s², r in feet.

Ah, that's a good point! Because when you have W = m*g, then m = W/g. So substituting into F = m*v²/r gives F = (W/g)*v²/r, which is (W*v²)/(g*r). So perhaps using that formula is easier because I can plug in W directly as 3200 lb.

Let me try that.

F = (W * v²) / (g*r)

W=3200 lb, v=88 ft/s, g=32.174 ft/s², r=880 ft.

So plug in the numbers:

F = (3200 * 88²) / (32.174 *880 )

Compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator: 3200 * 88^2.

88^2 is 7744. So 3200 *7744 = ?

Let me compute 3200 *7000=22,400,000. 3200*744= ?

Wait, 3200 *700=2,240,000. 3200 *44=140,800. So 2,240,000 +140,800=2,380,800.

So total numerator is 22,400,000 + 2,380,800 =24,780,800.

Denominator: 32.174 *880.

32 *880=28,160. 0.174 *880= approx 153.12. So total denominator is 28,160 +153.12=28,313.12.

So F=24,780,800 /28,313.12.

Let me compute that division.

Compute 24,780,800 ÷28,313.12.

Well, let's see. 28,313.12 * 875 = ?

28,313.12 *800=22,650,496.

28,313.12 *75=2,123,484.

Total 22,650,496 +2,123,484=24,773,980.

Now, 24,780,800 -24,773,980=6,820.

So 6,820 /28,313.12 ≈0.2408.

So total F≈875.2408 lb.

Same result as before. So approximately 875.24 lb. The closest option is E:880 lb, but that's a difference of about 5 lb. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation or perhaps I should consider more precise values for g.

Wait, perhaps I approximated g as 32.174, but maybe using 32 ft/s² would make the calculation easier and match one of the options better.

Let me try with g=32.

So F=(3200 *88²) / (32 *880 )

Compute numerator: 3200 *7744= same as before, 24,780,800.

Denominator:32*880=28,160.

So F=24,780,800 /28,160.

Divide 24,780,800 ÷28,160.

Well, 28,160 * 880 = ?

Wait, 28,160 * 800=22,528,000.

28,160 *80=2,252,800.

So 28,160 *880=22,528,000 +2,252,800=24,780,800.

So 24,780,800 ÷28,160=880.

Wait, that's exactly 880. So with g=32, the centripetal force is 880 lb, which is option E.

But wait, earlier when I used the precise g=32.174, I got approximately 875 lb, but when using g=32, it's exactly 880 lb. So perhaps the question expects us to use g=32 for simplicity.

So the correct answer would be E:880 lb.
</think>

To determine the centripetal force required for a 3200-pound car to navigate a curve with a radius of 880 feet at a speed of 60 mph, we use the formula for centripetal force:

\[
F = \frac{m v^2}{r}
\]

where \(m\) is the mass, \(v\) is the velocity, and \(r\) is the radius. However, since the car's weight is given in pounds, it is convenient to use the formula in terms of weight:

\[
F = \frac{W v^2}{g r}
\]

where \(W\) is the weight, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \(r\) is the radius. The units must be consistent, so we convert the given values as follows:

1. **Weight (\(W\))**: The car's weight is already given as 3200 lb.
2. **Velocity (\(v\))**: Convert 60 mph to feet per second. Since 1 mile = 5280 feet and 1 hour = 3600 seconds:
   \[
   v = \frac{60 \times 5280}{3600} = 88 \, \text{ft/s}.
   \]
3. **Radius (\(r\))**: The radius is given as 880 feet.
4. **Gravity (\(g\))**: Using \(g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\) for simplicity.

Now, substitute the values into the formula:

\[
F = \frac{3200 \times 88^2}{32 \times 880}.
\]

First, calculate \(88^2\):
\[
88^2 = 7744.
\]

Next, calculate the numerator:
\[
3200 \times 7744 = 24,780,800.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:
\[
32 \times 880 = 28,160.
\]

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[
F = \frac{24,780,800}{28,160} = 880 \, \text{lb}.
\]

Thus, the centripetal force required is **880 lb**, which corresponds to option **E**.
