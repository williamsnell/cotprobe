Question:

Suppose that there are three firms, A, B, and C, in an oligopolistic industry. In analyzing the market, Firm A has come to the conclusion that B and C will follow any price change A initiates. Does the kinked demand curve apply here?

Options:

A: The demand curves for all firms are horizontal, indicating perfect competition
B: The kinked demand curve does not apply to this oligopoly
C: The demand curve is unit elastic across all price ranges
D: The demand curve is perfectly inelastic in this oligopoly
E: The demand curve is perfectly elastic in this oligopoly
F: The kinked demand curve applies to this oligopoly
G: The demand curve for Firm A is upward sloping
H: Each firm faces a different demand curve that is kinked at different prices
I: The demand curves for the firms are vertical, suggesting that quantity demanded does not change with price changes
J: Firm A's demand curve is kinked, but Firms B and C have straight-line demand curves

Okay, so I've got this question about oligopolies and the kinked demand curve. Hmm, I remember that the kinked demand curve is a model used in oligopoly markets. Let me think about what I learned.

So, in an oligopoly, there are few firms, and each firm's decisions affect the others. The kinked demand curve was introduced by Paul Sweezy, right? The idea is that if a firm raises its price, competitors won't follow because they want to capture more market share. But if a firm lowers its price, competitors will match it to prevent losing customers. This creates a kink in the demand curve—steeper below the kink and flatter above.

The question says that there are three firms: A, B, and C. Firm A thinks that B and C will follow any price change it makes. So if A raises the price, B and C also raise theirs, and same if A lowers the price.

Wait, but in the classic kinked demand scenario, the demand curve is kinked because when a firm increases price, others don't follow, so demand is more elastic (steeper) on the upper side. When it decreases price, others do follow, so demand is less elastic (flatter) on the lower side. That's why the demand curve has a kink at the current price level.

But in this question, Firm A believes that B and C will follow any change. So if A changes the price up or down, others follow. So the reaction is the same whether A increases or decreases the price. That seems different from the usual kinked demand setup.

In the standard case, when a firm lowers price, others follow, but when it raises, others don't. So the kink happens because the demand elasticity differs depending on the direction of the price change.

If all firms follow any change, then maybe the demand curve isn't kinked. Because if A expects others to follow any move, then A's demand curve might be more like a standard shape without a kink.

Wait, let me think again. If A raises the price, and others follow, then A's sales might drop by a certain amount. If A lowers the price and others follow, A's sales might not increase as much because others are also lowering. So, the demand curve would have different slopes above and below the current price.

Wait, no. If all firms adjust their prices the same way, then maybe the demand curve doesn't have a kink because the elasticity doesn't change as much. Or perhaps the kinked demand model doesn't apply because the behavior expected by Firm A is different.

Alternatively, maybe the kinked demand model does apply here. Because in the kinked model, when a firm changes price, the competitors' reactions differ based on whether it's an increase or decrease. But in this case, the reaction is the same in both cases—competitors follow. So perhaps the kink isn't there because the demand curve's slope doesn't change in the same way.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down.

In the kinked demand curve, the firm's demand curve has two segments: one where if the firm raises price, quantity demanded drops a lot (elastic), and another where if it lowers price, quantity demanded doesn't increase as much because competitors lower theirs (inelastic). So the curve is kinked at the current price point.

But in this scenario, when A raises price, B and C follow. So if A raises, others do, so the loss in sales for A isn't as bad as in the kinked case because others are also raising. So the demand might be less elastic when raising prices.

Wait, no, because when A raises, and others do too, then the price increase is industry-wide. So the industry demand would determine how sales change. But for individual firm A, if all raise, then perhaps the demand curve A faces is more elastic because higher prices lead to lower quantity.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the kinked demand curve implies. It's a model where the firm's demand curve is kinked because of the different reactions to price changes. Without those different reactions, the kink disappears.

In this question, the reaction is the same whether A raises or lowers prices: B and C follow. So both scenarios (price increase and decrease) would have the same competitor response. Therefore, the demand curve might not have the kink because the elasticity isn't changing in the same way.

Wait, but if all firms adjust equally, maybe the demand curve for A wouldn't have the kink because the reactions are symmetric. Alternatively, maybe the demand curve isn't kinked because the responses are the same, so the usual conditions for a kinked demand don't hold.

So, the kinked demand curve applies when competitors have different reactions to price increases versus decreases. If they react the same in both cases, the kink might not form.

So, in this scenario, since B and C follow any price change, the kinked demand model doesn't apply. Because the kink arises when there's a difference in how competitors respond to price increases vs decreases.

Looking at the options, option B says the kinked demand curve does not apply. Option F says it does apply.

Wait, but I thought the kinked demand arises when competitors don't follow price increases but do follow decreases. So if in this case, they follow both increases and decreases, perhaps the kinked demand isn't present.

So the answer would be that the kinked demand does not apply. So option B.

Alternatively, let me check other options. Option J says only A's is kinked, others are straight. I don't think that's necessarily the case. The question is about whether the kinked demand applies here, given the behavior of B and C.

So the correct answer is B: The kinked demand curve does not apply to this oligopoly.

The kinked demand curve is a model used in oligopoly markets where firms face different demand elasticities depending on whether they raise or lower prices. Specifically, if a firm raises its price, competitors typically do not follow, leading to higher elasticity (steeper demand). Conversely, if a firm lowers its price, competitors usually match the reduction, leading to lower elasticity (flatter demand). This asymmetry creates a "kink" in the demand curve at the current price level.

In the scenario described, Firm A assumes that Firms B and C will follow any price change it initiates, whether an increase or a decrease. This behavior differs from the classic kinked demand setup, where competitors' reactions differ based on the direction of the price change. Since the reactions are symmetric here—competitors follow both increases and decreases—the conditions for a kinked demand curve are not met. The absence of differing elasticities in response to price changes means the demand curve is not kinked.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is that the kinked demand curve does not apply to this oligopoly.
