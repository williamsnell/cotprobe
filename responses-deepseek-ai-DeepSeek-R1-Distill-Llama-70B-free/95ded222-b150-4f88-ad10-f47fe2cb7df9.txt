Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about John Frere's discovery in 1797. I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Hmm, I remember that John Frere was an English antiquary and archaeologist. I think he made some significant discovery related to prehistory. 

Wait, I'm trying to recall. Oh right, John Frere is known for finding stone tools that suggested human antiquity. He found these tools in a gravel pit, and they were at a considerable depth. This was important because it provided evidence that humans had existed much earlier than previously thought, which was a big deal back then.

Looking at the options, I see option I: primitive stone tools excavated at great depth. That sounds right. But let me make sure I'm not mixing up other discoveries. For example, I know that Charles Darwin later contributed to evolution theories, but that's not relevant here. John Frere's findings were more about the tools showing human presence deep in the earth, which supported the idea of an ancient human presence.

So, the correct answer should be I. I don't think any of the other options fit. Option H is about human skulls with ape-like features, which might relate to something like Java Man or Neanderthals, but that's from a later period. Option G mentions cave paintings, which are more associated with places like Lascaux, discovered much later. So yeah, I'm pretty confident it's I.

The correct answer is I: primitive stone tools excavated at great depth.
