Okay, so I've got this problem with two sets, X and Y. I need to figure out which statement is false among the options given. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me write down the sets to make it easier. Set X is {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90} and set Y is {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}. Both sets have seven numbers each, so their medians will be the fourth number when sorted. Let me check if they are the same.

For set X, the numbers are already sorted. The fourth number is 50. For set Y, the sorted order is the same as given except the middle part: 10,30,35,50,65,70,90. So the fourth number is also 50. So their medians are the same. That means option A is true, so it's not the false one.

Next, the means. Mean is the average, so I'll sum all the numbers and divide by 7 for each set.

For X: 10 + 30 is 40, +45 is 85, +50 is 135, +55 is 190, +70 is 260, +90 brings it to 350. So sum is 350. Mean is 350/7 = 50.

For Y: 10 +30 is 40, +35 is 75, +50 is 125, +65 is 190, +70 is 260, +90 brings it to 350. Wait, same sum? So the mean would also be 50. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate Y's sum to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Y elements: 10,30,35,50,65,70,90. Let me add them again step by step.

10 + 30 =40; 40 +35=75; 75+50=125; 125+65=190; 190+70=260; 260+90=350. Oh, same as X! So both have mean 50, so option B says they have identical means, which is true. So B is not the false statement.

Now, the range. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. For both sets, the smallest number is 10 and the largest is 90. So 90-10=80. So both have a range of 80. So option C says they have identical ranges, which is true. So C is not the false one.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false. So if A, B, and C are all true, then the false statement would be none of them, which is option D. So the answer should be D.

Hmm, wait, but let me double-check everything because sometimes I might have miscalculated.

Let me recalculate the sum for Y again. 10 +30 is 40, plus35=75, plus50=125, plus65=190, plus70=260, plus90=350. Yes, same as X. So the means are same. Medians same. Range same.

So all the options A, B, C are true, meaning the false statement is D: None of the above are false. Wait, no. Wait, the question is which is false. Since all A, B, C are true, the statement that is false would be any that claims otherwise. So the question is asking which of the options is false.

Looking at the options:

Option D says "None of the above are false." Wait, no. Let me read the options correctly:

The options are:

A: The sets have identical medians. → True.

B: The sets have identical means. → True.

C: The sets have identical ranges. → True.

D: None of the above are false. → Wait, wait, no, D says "None of the above are false." Wait, no, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me read the question again.

The question is: Which of the following is false?

Options:

A: The sets have identical medians. → True, so A is not the false statement.

B: The sets have identical means. → True, so B is not the false statement.

C: The sets have identical ranges. → True, so C is not the false statement.

If A, B, C are all true, then the only option left is D: None of the above are false. Wait, no, the options are A to J, but in this case, the options are A, B, C, D. So the choices are A, B, C, D where D is "None of the above are false." Wait, wait, the actual option D says: "None of the above are false." Hmm, no, looking back, the options are:

Options:

A: The sets have identical medians.

B: The sets have identical means.

C: The sets have identical ranges.

D: None of the above are false.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased is: Which of the following is false? So if all A, B, C are true, then the statement that is false is the one that claims any of them are false. But the options are A, B, C, which are all true. So the correct answer would be that none of A, B, C are false, so D is correct, meaning the false statement is none of them.

Wait, but the question is which option is false. So if A, B, C are all true, then the false option would be any option that says something incorrect. Since all A, B, C are true statements, then the false option would be any that says otherwise. But the given options are A, B, C as true statements, and D says "None of the above are false." Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me clarify. Each option A, B, C is a statement about the sets. The question asks which of the following is false. So if all A, B, C are true, then the only false option would be if someone claims that A, B, or C is false, but none of the options are stating that. Wait, no, the options are A, B, C, D, where D is "None of the above are false." So if A, B, C are all true, then D is saying that none (as in, none of A, B, C) are false. Which is correct because all are true. But the question is asking which option is false. So if all A, B, C are true, then none of the options A, B, C are false. So the only false option would have to be if one of them were false. But since none are, the false statement doesn't exist among A, B, C. So the correct answer is D: None of the above are false. Wait, but D is stating that none of the above (A, B, C) are false, which is correct because all are true. So the question is which option is false. Since A, B, C are all true, there is no false option among them. So the correct answer is D, because D is saying that none of the above are false, which is correct. Wait, but the question is which statement is false. So if all A, B, C are true, then the statement that is false is any that says they are different. But since none do, the answer is D? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the means. Let me check again.

Set X: 10,30,45,50,55,70,90.

Sum X: 10+30=40; +45=85; +50=135; +55=190; +70=260; +90=350. So 350/7=50.

Set Y:10,30,35,50,65,70,90.

Sum Y:10+30=40; +35=75; +50=125; +65=190; +70=260; +90=350. 350/7=50. So means are same.

So, all three options A, B, C are true. Thus, the false statement would have to be any option that is not true. But since none are, the correct answer is D: None of the above are false.

Wait, but D says "None of the above are false." So if A, B, C are all true, then D is correct. So the question is which option is false. So the false option is the one that is not correct. Since all A, B, C are correct, the only false option would be if someone says one of them is false, but none of the options A, B, C say that. So all options A, B, C are true, making D the correct answer, meaning the false statement is none of them, so the answer is D.

To determine which statement is false, we analyze the given sets \( X = \{10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90\} \) and \( Y = \{10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90\} \) based on the options provided:

### Option A: The sets have identical medians.
- The median of a set is the middle value when the numbers are sorted. Since both sets have 7 elements, the median is the 4th number.
- For \( X \): \( 10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90 \), the median is \( 50 \).
- For \( Y \): \( 10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90 \), the median is also \( 50 \).
- **Conclusion**: The medians are identical. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

### Option B: The sets have identical means.
- The mean is calculated as the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
- For \( X \): \( 10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90 = 350 \). Mean \( = \frac{350}{7} = 50 \).
- For \( Y \): \( 10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90 = 350 \). Mean \( = \frac{350}{7} = 50 \).
- **Conclusion**: The means are identical. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

### Option C: The sets have identical ranges.
- The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- For both \( X \) and \( Y \), the minimum is \( 10 \) and the maximum is \( 90 \). Range \( = 90 - 10 = 80 \).
- **Conclusion**: The ranges are identical. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

### Option D: None of the above are false.
- Since all statements \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are true, this statement is also **true**.

### Final Answer:
Since all options \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are true, the false statement does not exist among them. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D**
