Okay, so I've got this question about Angelman syndrome, and I need to figure it out. I remember that Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to recall what I know.

I think Angelman syndrome is related to chromosome 15. Wait, is it the same as Prader-Willi syndrome? I remember they're both on chromosome 15 but involve different genes or something. Oh right, Prader-Willi is usually due to a deletion on the paternal chromosome, and Angelman is the opposite. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, so Angelman syndrome is caused by problems affecting the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15. If I remember correctly, this gene is imprinted, meaning only the maternal copy is active. So if there's a deletion or mutation in the maternal copy, the person won't have a functioning UBE3A gene. Because the paternal gene is usually silenced.

So the question is asking which option would result in Angelman syndrome. Let's look at the options:

Option A: Paternal UPD 16. UPD stands for Uniparental Disomy, right? So this means both copies of chromosome 16 are from the father. But I thought Angelman is on 15, not 16. So maybe this isn't it.

Option B: Maternal UPD 16. Again, 16, so probably not relevant for Angelman.

Option C: Mutation in SNRPN gene. SNRPN is a gene on chromosome 15, involved in Prader-Willi. Wait, mutations in SNRPN cause PWS, not Angelman. So this might not be right.

Option D: Deletion in maternally derived chromosome 16. Again, 16. Angelman is on 15, so this is probably wrong.

Option E: Deletion in paternally derived chromosome 15. So if the paternal chromosome has a deletion, but the maternal is normal. But wait, the UBE3A gene is maternally inherited. So if the paternal is missing, but the maternal is fine, then the UBE3A would still be functional. So this might not cause Angelman.

Wait, no, wait. Angelman can be caused by a deletion on the maternal chromosome. Because the maternal UBE3A is the active one. So if the maternal has a deletion, then the gene isn't there. But if the paternal has a deletion, the maternal is still active. So option E is a paternal deletion. That might not cause Angelman. So that's probably not it.

Option F: Mutation in SNRPN promoter. SNRPN mutations are related to Prader-Willi, right? Or maybe this could cause Angelman. I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe a mutation in the promoter of UBE3A? Wait, no, the option is about SNRPN.

Option G: Paternal UPD 15. So both copies of 15 are from the father. If the maternal chromosome is missing and replaced by another paternal, then the UBE3A gene (which is maternally expressed) would be missing. Because the person would have two paternal copies, which aren't active for UBE3A. So that would lead to Angelman syndrome. Because the mother's UBE3A is not there.

Wait, let me get this straight. In UPD, you have two chromosomes from one parent. So if it's paternal UPD 15, the person has two paternal copies. The UBE3A gene is only active on the maternal copy. So if both are paternal, the gene isn't active. That would cause Angelman.

Another scenario is a deletion on the maternal chromosome. So if the mother's chromosome 15 is deleted for UBE3A, the child has no active UBE3A. That also causes Angelman.

So looking back at the options, which ones fit.

Option E: Deletion in paternally derived 15. No, that's the wrong parent. Because the paternal's UBE3A isn't active. So that wouldn't cause Angelman.

Wait, actually, if the maternal chromosome is normal, but the paternal is deleted, then the UBE3A from the mother is present. So that's okay.

But if the maternal chromosome has a deletion (so the mother's UBE3A is missing), and the paternal is normal (but its UBE3A is inactive), then the child will have Angelman.

Looking at the options, is there an option about a maternal deletion on 15? Let me check.

Option E: Deletion in paternally derived 15. So the paternal is missing, but the maternal is fine. So no problem.

Wait, so perhaps the correct option is not present, but I must have made a mistake. Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the options are:

A: Paternal UPD 16

B: Maternal UPD 16

C: Mutation in SNRPN

D: Maternal deletion on 16

E: Paternal deletion on 15

F: SNRPN promoter mutation

G: Paternal UPD 15

So, the correct scenarios for Angelman are:

1. Deletion of the maternal chromosome 15 (the UBE3A gene is missing on the mother's copy).

2. Paternal UPD 15 (so both copies are paternal, meaning UBE3A is not active).

3. Mutation in the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome.

Looking at the options, does any of them match that?

Option G is paternal UPD 15, which would cause Angelman.

Option E is a paternal deletion on 15, which would not cause Angelman because the maternal is okay.

So in the options, option G is paternal UPD 15, which would cause Angelman.

Another possibility is a mutation in the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome, but that's not one of the options. So looking at the options, which one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

Option E: Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15. So if the father's chromosome 15 is missing, but the mother's is normal, that should be fine, because the mother's UBE3A is active.

Another scenario: If the mother's chromosome 15 is missing (so the child only has the father's, which has inactive UBE3A), that would cause Angelman. But that's not one of the options.

So, the options given are:

Option G: paternal UPD 15. So both 15s are from the father. Then, the UBE3A is not active, so the child has Angelman.

So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but let me think again. I'm a bit confused because another possible cause is the deletion of the maternal chromosome. But that's not an option here.

Looking back, the options donâ€™t have a maternal deletion on 15. So the only option that leads to Angelman is G: paternal UPD 15.

Another option could be a mutation in the UBE3A gene, but the options don't mention that. Option C is a mutation in SNRPN, which is related to Prader-Willi.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is G: paternal UPD 15.

Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the loss of function of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15. This gene is imprinted, meaning only the maternal copy is active. Therefore, Angelman syndrome occurs when there is no functional UBE3A gene from the mother. This can happen in two main scenarios:

1. **Deletion of the maternal chromosome 15**: If the maternal chromosome 15 is deleted, the UBE3A gene is missing, leading to Angelman syndrome. However, this specific scenario is not listed among the options.

2. **Paternal Uniparental Disomy (UPD) 15**: If both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father (paternal UPD 15), the UBE3A gene is not active because the paternal copy is silenced. This also results in Angelman syndrome.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Paternal UPD 16**: Irrelevant, as Angelman syndrome is related to chromosome 15, not 16.
- **B: Maternal UPD 16**: Also irrelevant for the same reason as option A.
- **C: Mutation in the SNRPN gene**: SNRPN mutations are associated with Prader-Willi syndrome, not Angelman syndrome.
- **D: Deletion in the maternally derived chromosome 16**: Irrelevant, as Angelman syndrome involves chromosome 15.
- **E: Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15**: This would not cause Angelman syndrome because the maternal chromosome is still functional, providing a working UBE3A gene.
- **F: Mutation in the SNRPN promoter**: SNRPN is related to Prader-Willi syndrome, not Angelman syndrome.
- **G: Paternal UPD 15**: This is a correct cause of Angelman syndrome, as both copies of chromosome 15 are paternal, and the UBE3A gene is not active.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: Paternal UPD 15**, as it directly leads to the loss of functional UBE3A, resulting in Angelman syndrome.
