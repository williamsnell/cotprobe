Okay, so I've got this insurance problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about Mr. Laker who bought a one-year insurance policy for $42 on August 15. He canceled it on October 12, and we need to find out how much his refund was. The options are A through J with different amounts.

First, I think I need to figure out how much time the policy was active before he canceled it. Because the refund is probably based on the unused portion of the policy. So, the total coverage is a year, and he used part of it, so the refund would be the remaining part.

Let me break down the timeline:

He purchased it on August 15, and canceled on October 12. So, the period from August 15 to October 12 is the time he had the insurance. Let me calculate how many days that is.

Wait, but wait—insurance policies sometimes calculate refunds based on months rather than days, but maybe in this case, they do it daily. Hmm. The question doesn't specify, but I think for an exam problem like this, it's more likely to be based on the number of days.

So, let's get the number of days between August 15 and October 12.

August has 31 days. So, from August 15 to August 31 is 31 - 15 = 16 days.

Then, September has 30 days, so that's a full month, adding 30 days.

Then, from October 1 to October 12 is 12 days.

So total days would be 16 (Aug) + 30 (Sept) + 12 (Oct) = 58 days.

Wait, wait. Let me recount that. Because August 15 to August 31 is 17 days, including the 15th? Or is it 16 days? Hmm.

Wait, the day he buys it, August 15, would count as day 1. So from August 15 to August 31 is 31 - 15 = 16 days left in August. So that's 16 days.

Then September has 30 days.

Then October 1 to October 12 is 12 days.

So total days the policy was active is 16 +30 +12 = 58 days.

Now, the total policy is for one year, which is 365 days.

So the portion used is 58 days out of 365.

The total premium is $42, so the refund would be based on the unused period.

Wait, but sometimes, companies might prorate the refund, but sometimes they might calculate it monthly. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume daily proration.

So, the total cost per day would be 42 / 365 dollars per day.

He used 58 days, so the amount he's used is 58 * (42/365).

But wait, wait: the refund would be the total premium minus the used amount. So the refund is for the unused days.

So, the unused days are 365 - 58 = 307 days.

So the refund would be (307/365) * 42.

Let me calculate that.

First, let me compute 307 divided by 365.

307 ÷ 365 ≈ 0.8411.

Then, 0.8411 * 42 ≈ Let's see: 42 * 0.8 is 33.6, and 42 * 0.0411 is approximately 1.746. So total is about 35.346.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately:

42 * 307 = ?

Well, 40 * 307 = 12,280, and 2 * 307 = 614, so total is 12,280 + 614 = 12,894.

Then, 12,894 ÷ 365 = ?

Let me compute 365 × 35 = 12,775. Because 365 × 30 is 10,950, 365 ×5 is 1,825, so 10,950 + 1,825=12,775.

Subtract that from 12,894: 12,894 - 12,775 = 119.

Now, 119 ÷ 365 is approximately 0.326.

So total is 35 + 0.326 ≈ 35.326.

So approximately $35.33.

Looking at the options, option D is $35.50, which is close but a bit higher. Option C is $31.08. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 307/365 exactly. Let me see:

307 ÷ 365 = ?

Well, 365 goes into 307 zero times. Let's compute 3070 ÷ 365.

365 ×8 is 2920 (since 365×8=2920). 3070 -2920=150. So 8 with remainder 150.

Bring down a zero: 1500. 365 ×4 is 1460. 1500-1460=40.

So 8.4 so far, with 40 left. Bring down another zero: 400.

365 ×1 is 365. 400-365=35.

So it's approximately 8.411... So 0.8411.

So 0.8411 ×42=?

Let me compute 0.8 ×42=33.6, 0.04 ×42=1.68, 0.0011×42≈0.0462.

So total is 33.6 +1.68=35.28, plus 0.0462 is about 35.326.

So around 35.33. But the options don't have that exact number.

Looking at the options:

A: $7.84

B: $10.92

C: $31.08

D: $35.50

E: $23.40

F: $42

G: $19.68

H: $26

I: $15.75

J: $28.56

So the closest is D: $35.50. But wait, maybe I miscalculated the days.

Wait another thought: perhaps the dates are being calculated differently. Let me recount the days from August 15 to October 12.

August: from 15th to 31st, which is 17 days (including the 15th? Or not? Wait, when you count the days from day 1 to day n, it's n days. So August 15 to August 31: 31-15+1=17 days.

Wait, wait: for example, from August 1 to August 2 is 2 days. So 31-15=16, plus 1 is 17 days in August.

Then September: 30 days.

October: 12 days.

So total is 17+30+12=59 days.

Wait, that changes things. So I had 58 before, but correct is 59 days.

So the used days are 59, and unused is 365-59=306 days.

So the refund is (306/365)*42.

Let me compute 306 ÷ 365 first.

306 ÷ 365 = approximately 0.838.

So 0.838 ×42 = ?

0.8 ×42=33.6

0.03 ×42=1.26

0.008 ×42=0.336

Adding up: 33.6 +1.26=34.86 +0.336=35.196.

So approximately $35.20.

Looking at the options, D is $35.50, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done by exact fractions.

Compute 306 *42 = ?

Well, 300 *42=12,600

6 *42=252

So total is 12,600 + 252 =12,852.

Then, 12,852 ÷365 = ?

Let's compute 365 ×35=12,775.

12,852 -12,775=77.

77 ÷365=0.211.

So total is 35 + 0.211=35.211, so approximately $35.21.

Still, the closest option is D: $35.50. But none of the options exactly match. Wait, maybe I messed up the days again.

Wait, perhaps the way the days are calculated is that the cancellation is on October 12, so the last day is October 12, meaning that the policy was active until that day, so that's 12 days in October. So the total days would be 17 (Aug) +30 (Sept)+12 (Oct)=59 days.

Alternatively, maybe the company calculates the refund based on months, not days. Let's see.

He bought the policy on August 15. So from August 15 to the end of August is 17 days (as before). Then September is a full month, and October 1 to October 12 is 12 days.

If the company refunds based on full months, then he used August (partial month), September (full), and October (partial). Or maybe they consider each month as a separate period.

Wait, but without knowing the exact company's refund policy, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the refund is calculated as a short-rate, which might not be a straight proration.

Wait, in the insurance industry, sometimes when a policy is canceled, the refund is calculated based on the short-rate, which is a method that charges a higher rate for the initial period. But I'm not sure if that applies here. The problem doesn't mention anything about that, so perhaps it's a straight proration.

But let's think again.

If the policy was for 365 days, and he used 59 days, then the refund would be 42 * (306/365) ≈35.21.

So approximately $35.21. But the options don't have that exact amount. The closest is D: $35.50, but that's a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount the days from August 15 to October 12.

August 15 to August 31: 17 days (including 15th and 31st).

September: 30 days.

October 1 to October 12: 12 days.

Total: 17+30+12=59 days.

So 59 days used, 306 days remaining.

So 306/365 = approx 0.8386.

0.8386 *42 = ?

Let me compute 42 ×0.8 =33.6

42 ×0.03=1.26 → total 34.86

42×0.008=0.336 → total 35.196.

Hmm, still around 35.20.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a 360-day year for simplification, which is common in some financial calculations.

If we use 360 days instead of 365:

306/360 = 0.85.

42 ×0.85 =35.70.

Which is not exactly in the options, but D is 35.50, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the refund based on the number of months.

So, he had the policy from August 15 to October 12. Let's count the months:

August: from 15th to end → 1/2 month.

September: full month.

October: 12 days, which is roughly 12/31 ≈0.387 of a month, but perhaps considered as a fraction.

But this approach might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the company calculates refunds on a monthly basis, giving a full refund for full months unused beyond the current month.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the policy is considered active for the entire month of August because he bought it on the 15th. But that's unlikely because the exact date matters.

Alternatively, the company might calculate the refund as follows:

Each month's premium is 42/12 = $3.50 per month.

He bought it on August 15. So:

- August: 16 days (assuming from 15th to 31st, which is 16 days).

Wait, but if the company charges per month, maybe they consider any part of a month as a full month.

So, he used part of August, all of September, and part of October.

But this depends on the company's policy. If they do a monthly proration, maybe they charge for August, September, and October, but only for the days used.

Alternatively, perhaps the refund is calculated as:

Total premium $42.

He used from August 15 to October 12: 59 days.

So the used portion is 59/365 of the premium, so the refund is the rest.

But let me try another angle. Let me compute 42 × (59/365) to find the amount he's used, and subtract from 42 to get the refund.

Wait, wait no: the refund would be the unused portion, which is (365-59)/365 *42.

Which is what I did earlier, getting around $35.21.

But none of the options exactly match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the days.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the policy is from August 15 to August 15 next year, so exactly one year. So the cancellation is on October 12, which is how many days into the policy?

Wait, August 15 to October 12: let me calculate using an alternative method.

August: 15th to 31st is 17 days.

September: 30.

October:12.

Total 59 days.

Yes, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D, $35.50, which is close to $35.21, but maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recalculate 306 days.

306 ÷365 = ?

Well, 365 ×0.84 = 306.6, which is very close to 306. So 0.84 exactly.

So 0.84 ×42 = ?

42 ×0.8 =33.6

42 ×0.04=1.68

So 33.6+1.68=35.28.

So $35.28. Hmm, that's close to $35.30.

Looking at the options, D is $35.50, which is a bit higher. But perhaps the exact calculation is 306/365 = 0.8386.

0.8386 ×42:

Let me compute 42 ×0.8386.

42 ×0.8 =33.6

42 ×0.03=1.26 → total 34.86

42 ×0.008=0.336 → 35.196

42 ×0.0006=0.0252 → total 35.2212.

So approximately $35.22.

Hmm. None of the options match exactly, but the closest is D: $35.50.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to round up, or maybe I overlooked something.

Alternatively, perhaps the policy is considered as 360 days, so 306/360 = 0.85.

0.85 ×42 =35.70.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is $31.08. How would that come about?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of months. Let's try that.

He had the policy for August 15 to October 12.

If the company calculates refunds per month, perhaps each month is considered as 1/12 of the premium, which is $3.50 per month.

So, from August 15 to October 12, how many full months has he used?

August: he bought it on the 15th, so perhaps he's charged for the full month of August.

September: full month.

October: he canceled on the 12th, so perhaps charged for the full month of October.

Wait, that would be 3 months (August, September, October). So he's used 3 months out of 12.

So the used premium is 3 ×3.50= $10.50.

So the refund would be 42 -10.50= $31.50.

Looking at the options, option C is $31.08, which is close but not exact.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the company doesn't charge for the full month if the policy is canceled before the end of the month.

So, August: from 15th to 31st: 17 days, which is part of August. So 17 days in August, then full September, and 12 days in October.

If the company calculates based on the exact days, then:

Total days used:17 +30 +12=59.

So, 59 days out of 365.

So the used amount is (59/365)*42 ≈ (0.1616)*42≈6.787.

So the refund is 42 -6.787≈35.213.

Again, close to $35.21, which is near option D: $35.50.

But perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the policy was purchased on August 15, so the first day is counted as day 1. So from August 15 to October 12 is 59 days, as before.

Wait, perhaps the refund is calculated as (total days - days used) × daily rate.

So daily rate is 42/365 ≈0.1151 per day.

So refund is (365-59)*0.1151 ≈306 *0.1151≈35.20.

So again, about $35.20.

But none of the options exactly match, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes a 30-day month for calculation, which is a common simplification.

So, August has 31 days, but perhaps the company considers each month as 30 days, so 30 ×12=360 days a year.

So, in that case:

August: from 15th to 31st: 16 days (since 31-15=16, but perhaps they count it as 16 days in a 30-day August).

Wait, but if each month is 30 days, then:

August: 16 days.

September:30 days.

October:12 days.

Total days used:16+30+12=58.

 Unused days:360-58=302.

So refund is (302/360)*42.

Compute 302 ÷360 ≈0.8389.

0.8389 ×42≈35.23.

Still about $35.23, which is close to D: $35.50.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method, like the number of months.

Wait, perhaps the refund is calculated based on the number of whole months remaining.

He canceled on October 12, so the policy was in effect for August, September, and part of October.

If the company gives a full refund for each full month remaining after the cancellation.

So, after October 12, the remaining time is November, December, January, etc., up to August 14 next year.

Which is 9 full months remaining (November to July, as August is only up to the 14th, so July is the last full month).

Wait, no. Wait, from October 12
