Okay, so I've got this problem about an air-vapor mixture, and I need to figure out the specific humidity, relative humidity, and the heat added when it's heated. Hmm, let's start by recalling some concepts. 

Alright, the problem says the initial conditions are 60°F and 55% relative humidity. Then it's heated to 85°F, and the pressure is atmospheric, 14.7 psia. 

Part (a) asks for initial and final specific humidities. Wait, specific humidity is the mass of vapor per mass of dry air, right? Oh right, the specific humidity (ω) is given by ω = 0.622 * P_v / P_atm, where P_v is the vapor pressure. But wait, since it's relative humidity, I think P_v is RH multiplied by the saturation pressure at that temperature.

So, first, initial state: T1 is 60°F. I need to find the saturation pressure at 60°F. I remember that the saturation pressure of water can be found using the Antoine equation or from psychrometric charts. Let me think, I think at 60°F, the saturation pressure (P_s1) is about 0.2512 psia. Wait, maybe I should double-check. Oh right, no, wait, let me think again. At 50°F, it's around 0.178 psia, and higher at 60. Maybe around 0.25 something. Let me think of exact values. Alternatively, I can recall standard psychrometric data. 

Wait, let me get exact data. Let's see, 60°F is 15.55°C. The saturation pressure for water at 15.55°C is approximately 1.705 kPa, which converts to about 0.247 psia (since 1 psia is about 6.89476 kPa). So P_s1 ≈ 0.247 psia. 

So the vapor pressure P_v1 is RH * P_s1. RH is 55%, so P_v1 = 0.55 * 0.247 ≈ 0.13585 psia.

Then the specific humidity ω1 = 0.622 * P_v1 / P_atm, and P_atm is 14.7 psia. So ω1 = 0.622 * 0.13585 / 14.7. Let me compute that: 0.622 * 0.13585 ≈ 0.0846. Divide by 14.7: 0.0846 /14.7 ≈ 0.00576 lbm vapor per lbm dry air. Wait, but looking at the options, that's not matching exactly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the P_s calculation. 

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise P_s values. Let me think again. Wait, at 60°F, the saturation pressure is actually around 0.2512 psia. Let me confirm: I think at 70°F, it's about 0.3632 psia. So 60°F would be lower. Let me search my memory for a precise value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation for saturation pressure. The Antoine equation is ln(P) = A - B/(T + C), where P is in bar and T is in °C. For water, A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485. So T in °C is 15.5556 (since 60°F is (60-32)*5/9=15.5556°C). 

So ln(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(15.5556 +244.485) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(260.0406) ≈ 8.14019 - 6.963 ≈ 1.1772. So P = e^1.1772 ≈ 3.245 kPa. Wait, that's 3.245 kPa, which is about 0.470 psia (since 1 kPa ≈ 0.145 psi, 3.245 * 0.145 ≈ 0.470). Wait, that can't be right because at 60°F the saturation pressure shouldn't be that high. Wait, no, maybe I messed up the Antoine equation parameters. Oh wait, perhaps I should use the equation in a different unit, like in terms of °F. Alternatively, maybe I should just use standard psychrometric data.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the saturation table. Let me try to recall: at 50°F, P_sat is 0.178 psia, at 60°F it's around 0.25, 70°F is 0.363. So 0.25 psia seems right. So going back, P_v1 = 0.55 * 0.2512 ≈ 0.13816 psia.

Then ω1 = 0.622 * 0.13816 /14.7 ≈ 0.622 * 0.13816 ≈ 0.0859, divided by 14.7 gives 0.00584 lbm/lbm. So approximately 0.00584, which is about 0.0058. Looking at the options, some have 0.00602, like option B, and 0.00502 in option J. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Wait, let me compute more accurately.

0.622 * 0.13816 = let's compute 0.622 * 0.13816:

0.622 * 0.1 = 0.0622
0.622 * 0.03816 ≈ 0.622 *0.03= 0.01866, 0.622*0.00816≈0.00507. So total 0.0622 +0.01866=0.08086 +0.00507= 0.08593.

So 0.08593 divided by 14.7: 14.7 * 0.0058 is 0.08526, so 0.08593 would be 0.00586 lbm/lbm. So approximately 0.00586, which is 0.00586 lbm vapor per lbm dry air.

Looking at the options, option B says initial specific humidity is 0.00602, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe my P_sat is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise P_sat values.

Wait, perhaps the exact value at 60°F is 0.252 psia. Let's see: exact data from a psychrometric chart would be better. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ASHRAE formula or exact data.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for specific humidity ω = (0.622 * P_v) / P_atm. So P_v is RH * P_sat. So if I have an RH of 55% and T1=60°F, then P_sat at 60°F is 0.2512 psia (I think that's the exact value from the table). So P_v1 = 0.55 * 0.2512 = 0.13816 psia. So ω1 = 0.622 * 0.13816 /14.7 = (0.622 * 0.13816) = 0.0859, then 0.0859/14.7 ≈ 0.00584. So approximately 0.00584 lbm vapor/lbm dry air.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 0.00602, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe I should check if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, 0.622 * 0.13816 = let's compute it precisely. 0.622 * 0.1 is 0.0622, 0.622 * 0.03 is 0.01866, 0.622 * 0.00816: 0.622*0.008=0.004976, 0.622*0.00016≈0.0000995. So 0.004976 +0.0000995≈0.0050755. So total 0.0622 +0.01866=0.08086 +0.0050755=0.0859355. So 0.0859355 lbm/lbm divided by 14.7, which is approximately 0.005845.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B starts with 0.00602, which would be from a slightly higher P_v. Maybe I'm off in the P_sat value. Let me double-check: maybe P_sat at 60°F is actually higher. Let me think: Wait, at 50°F, it's 0.178, at 60°F, 0.251, 70°F, 0.363. So yes, 0.251 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but let's look at the final specific humidity. Wait, when you heat the air, the specific humidity remains the same if you're only adding heat without adding or removing moisture. Because specific humidity is mass of vapor per mass of dry air, which depends on the mass, which doesn't change when heating. So if the air is heated without any addition or removal of moisture, the specific humidity remains the same. So ω1 = ω2.

Wait, that's a key point. So the specific humidity is the same before and after heating, because heating doesn't add or remove mass. So for part (a), the initial and final specific humidities are the same. So in the options, only options A, G, H, I have the same initial and final specific humidities. Let's look at these options.

Option A: 0.00802, same initial and final. But our calculation was about 0.00584.

Option G: 0.00652, same.

Option H: 0.00702, same.

Option I: 0.00652.

Wait, but our calculation was 0.00584, which is approximately 0.0058. So none of the options with same initial and final specific humidity have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when heating, the pressure remains constant, so the specific humidity remains the same. So in that case, only the relative humidity changes because the saturation pressure at the higher temperature is higher.

Wait, let me think again. So the initial specific humidity is ω1 = 0.622 * (RH1 * P_sat1) / P_atm. After heating, since no moisture is added or removed, ω2 = ω1. So the final specific humidity is the same as the initial.

So part (a) initial and final specific humidities are the same.

Looking at the options, the only options where initial and final are same are A, G, H, I, and perhaps others. Let's see:

Option A: 0.00802, same.

Option G: 0.00652 same.

Option H: 0.00702 same.

Option I: 0.00652 same.

But our calculation for ω was approximately 0.00584. None of the options with same initial and final have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in P_sat at 60°F. Let me think again. Maybe it's higher. Let me try looking up a precise value. 

Wait, according to standard psychrometric tables, at 60°F, the saturation pressure is 0.2512 psia. So that's correct.

Wait, so going back, the specific humidity is 0.622 * (0.55 * 0.2512) /14.7.

Compute numerator: 0.55 * 0.2512 = 0.13816.

0.622 * 0.13816 = 0.085935.

Divide by 14.7: 0.005845, approximately 0.005845 lbm/lbm.

Looking at the options, none of the options where initial and final are same have 0.0058. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is 14.7 psia, but in the specific humidity formula, P_atm is in psia. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check whether the options have specific humidity close to 0.0058. Looking at the options:

Option B: initial 0.00602, final same? No, option B says initial and final same? Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: Initial and final specific humidities: 0.00802, etc.

Option B: Initial and final same: 0.00602.

Option C: Initial 0.00602, final 0.00502.

Option D: initial 0.00752, final 0.00702.

Option E: initial 0.00802, final 0.00902.

Option F: initial 0.00702, final 0.00852.

Option G: initial and final 0.00652.

Option H: initial and final 0.00702.

Option I: initial and final 0.00652.

Option J: initial 0.00502, final 0.00602.

Wait, so the options where initial and final are same are A, B, G, H, I.

Our calculated ω is 0.005845, which is approximately 0.0058. So none of the options have that. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me compute P_sat at 60°F exactly.

Using the Antoine equation:

At 60°F, which is 15.5556°C.

 Antoine equation: ln(P_sat) = A - B/(T + C), where for water, A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485.

So T = 15.5556°C.

So denominator is 15.5556 +244.485 = 260.0406.

So ln(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94 / 260.0406.

Compute 1810.94 / 260.0406 ≈ 6.962.

So ln(P) = 8.14019 - 6.962 ≈ 1.17819.

So P = e^1.17819 ≈ 3.245 kPa.

Convert to psia: 3.245 kPa * (1 psia / 6.89476 kPa) ≈ 0.4707 psia.

Wait, that can't be right because at 60°F, P_sat is about 0.25 psia. So perhaps I used the wrong Antoine parameters. Alternatively, maybe the Antoine equation uses different units. Wait, Antoine equation can vary based on the units, perhaps the pressure is in bar?

Wait, I think the Antoine equation I used is for P in bar. Let me check. Because when I calculated at 15.5556°C, I got P=3.245 kPa, which is 0.3245 bar. Wait, 1 bar is 14.5 psia, so 0.3245 bar is about 4.72 psia, which is way too high for 60°F.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Antoine equation where P is in mmHg. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I should use the equation in a different form.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct Antoine equation for water is:

ln(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(T + 244.485), where P is in kPa and T is in °C.

Wait, that would make more sense. Let me compute again.

At T=15.5556°C,

ln(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(15.5556 + 244.485) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/260.0406 ≈ 8.14019 - 6.962 ≈ 1.17819.

So P = e^1.17819 ≈ 3.245 kPa.

Wait, that's still 3.245 kPa, which is 0.4707 psia, which is much higher than expected. Hmm, something's wrong here. Because I know that at 60°F (15.55°C), the saturation pressure is around 0.25 psia, not 0.47.

Wait, maybe the Antoine equation I'm using applies to a different temperature range. Let me check the correct Antoine constants for water. Oh, wait, I think the Antoine equation I'm using is for the temperature range of 1°C to 100°C, but perhaps different sources have different constants. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the Antoine equation in terms of °F.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just refer to standard psychrometric data. Let me think: from a psychrometric chart, at 60°F, the saturation pressure is about 0.2512 psia. So I think I should proceed with that value.

So, ω_initial = 0.622 * (0.55 * 0.2512) /14.7.

So, 0.55 * 0.2512 = 0.13816.

0.622 * 0.13816 = let me compute that accurately: 0.622 * 0.1 = 0.0622, 0.622 * 0.03816 = 0.622 * 0.03 = 0.01866, 0.622 * 0.00816 = ~0.00507. So total 0.0622 + 0.01866 = 0.08086 + 0.00507 = 0.08593.

Then, 0.08593 / 14.7 = approximately 0.005845 lbm vapor/lbm dry air.

Hmm, so that's about 0.005845, which is 0.00585 approximately. Looking at the options, none of the options where initial and final are same have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the specific humidity is calculated differently. Alternatively, maybe I should consider using the ideal gas law for vapor and air.

Wait, another approach: the specific humidity can also be calculated as ω = (P_v * M_v) / (P_atm - P_v) * M_air. Wait, no, the usual formula is ω = (0.622 * P_v) / P_atm, because M_v is 18.015 and M_air is 28.97, so 18.015/28.97 ≈ 0.622.

So, yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake, perhaps the initial specific humidity is higher.

Wait, maybe I should check using another method. Let's compute the initial specific humidity using the formula ω = (0.622 * P_v) / (
