Okay, so I've got this question here about a sporting event held annually on Memorial Day weekend. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I need to remember which events are associated with specific holidays. Memorial Day is a big one in the United States, usually at the end of May. I know that some sports events are tied to certain weekends or holidays because of tradition.

Looking at the options, there are a few that I'm somewhat familiar with. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: FIFA World Cup. That's soccer, right? But I think the World Cup happens every four years, and I don't recall it being on Memorial Day. Plus, it's an international event, not specific to the US.

Option B: Stanley Cup Finals. That's the NHL championship. I believe the Stanley Cup usually happens around June, so maybe it could overlap with Memorial Day, but I'm not sure if it's annually on that weekend.

Option C: Wimbledon. That's a tennis tournament, and I think it's in July, so Memorial Day is way before that. So probably not C.

Option D: World Series. That's baseball's championship. It happens in October, I believe, so no connection to Memorial Day.

Option E: Iditarod. That's the sled dog race in Alaska. It's in March, I think, so not related to Memorial Day.

Option F: Daytona 500. That's a major NASCAR race. I think it's in February, like early in the year, so not on Memorial Day.

Option G: Super Bowl. That's the NFL championship. It's in February, around early part of the year, so not Memorial Day.

Option H: The Masters. That's a golf tournament, one of the majors. I think it's in April, so not on Memorial Day weekend.

Option I: Kentucky Derby. That's a horse race, right? I've heard it's in May, but is it on Memorial Day? I'm not exactly sure. I think the Derby is usually in early May, maybe the first or second Saturday. Memorial Day is the last Monday in May, so maybe the Derby is a bit before that.

Option J: Indianapolis 500. That's the Indy car race. I recall that the Indy 500 is held on Memorial Day weekend. It's a big event, and I think it's traditionally on that Sunday. So that would make sense.

Wait, but I thought the Kentucky Derby is sometimes called the "first leg" of the Triple Crown, and I believe it's in May. Let me double-check. Oh right, the Kentucky Derby is usually the first Saturday in May, so that's earlier than Memorial Day. Memorial Day is the last weekend, so the 500 would be around that time.

So putting it all together, the Indianapolis 500 is the event held on Memorial Day weekend. That would make the correct answer J.
