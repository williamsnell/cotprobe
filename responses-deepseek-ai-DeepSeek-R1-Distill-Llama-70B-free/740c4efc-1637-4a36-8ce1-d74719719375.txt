Okay, so I have this logic question to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying the conclusion of an argument. The argument given is: "It is wrong for society to kill a murderer. This follows for the reason that if a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer. And a murderer is wrong in killing his victim."

The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct conclusion.

Hmm, so first, I remember that in arguments, there's usually a premise and a conclusion. The conclusion is what the argument is trying to prove, while the premises support it. The question says to remove any conclusion indicators, so I need to look for the main point.

Looking at the argument structure: the first sentence is "It is wrong for society to kill a murderer." Then it says "This follows for the reason that..." which introduces the premise. So the first sentence is the conclusion because the rest of the argument supports it.

Wait, but sometimes the conclusion can be in different places. Let me break it down. The argument starts with the claim, then gives the reasoning. So the first part is stating the position, and the next sentences are the premises backing it up.

So the conclusion is "It is wrong for society to kill a murderer." Now I need to match that to the options.

Looking at the options:

A: A murderer is not wrong in killing his victim. — No, the argument says the opposite.

B: If a murderer is right in killing his victim, then society is also right in killing the murderer. — This seems like a hypothetical but not the conclusion.

C: And a murderer is wrong in killing his victim. — This is one of the premises.

D: This does not follow... — This is a counterargument maybe.

E: And a murderer is not wrong... — Opposite of a premise.

F: This follows for the reason... — This is part of the premise structure.

G: If a murderer is wrong, then society is wrong. — This is the conditional premise.

H: Society is not wrong... — Opposite of the conclusion.

I: A murderer is right... — Opposite of a premise.

J: It is wrong for society to kill a murderer. — This matches the first sentence.

So the conclusion is option J.

The conclusion of the argument is "It is wrong for society to kill a murderer," which corresponds to option J.

J
