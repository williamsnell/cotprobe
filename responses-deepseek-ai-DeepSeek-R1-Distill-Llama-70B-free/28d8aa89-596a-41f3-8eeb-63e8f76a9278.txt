Okay, I've got this problem about a rotameter. Hmm, I remember a rotameter is used to measure the flow rate of a fluid. The question gives a bunch of parameters, so I need to figure out how they all connect.

Let me start by listing out what's given. The rotameter has a vertical tapered tube that's 18 inches long. The internal diameters at the top and bottom are 1.5 and 1.0 inches respectively. So the tube tapers from wider to narrower. The floating cork has a diameter of 1.0 inch, a volume of 0.65 cubic inches, and a specific gravity of 4.74. The volumetric flow rate is 1.80 gpm, and the coefficient is 0.74. I need to find the height of the cork from the bottom.

Wait, specific gravity is the ratio of the density of the cork to the density of water. So the cork's density is 4.74 times that of water. Water's density is about 62.4 lb/ft³, so the cork's density is 4.74 * 62.4 lb/ft³. But wait, maybe I'll need this in some other units later.

The flow rate is given in gallons per minute. I might need to convert this to cubic inches per second or something else. Let me think about the formula for flow rate in a rotameter. I recall that the flow rate Q can be related to the area of the annulus around the cork and the velocity of the fluid. The coefficient probably comes into play for the discharge coefficient, similar to an orifice or venturi.

The formula I think is Q = C * A * v, where C is the coefficient, A is the annular area, and v is the velocity. But wait, in a rotameter, the flow rate is based on the area between the cork and the tube. So when the cork floats, the fluid flows around it, creating an annular gap. The area depends on the height of the cork.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the equation for variable area flowmeters, which is:

Q = C * A * sqrt(2gh)

Wait, but no, that's for devices where the head (h) is the driving force, like in a venturi where the height difference creates pressure difference. Hmm. Wait, no, maybe for a rotameter, the flow is dependent on the area around the float and the velocity, which is driven by the pressure difference as the fluid flows up.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the balance of forces. When the cork is floating, the buoyant force equals the weight of the cork minus the upward force from the flowing fluid. But maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that the flow through a rotameter can be described by the equation:

Q = (C * A * sqrt( (2 * (W - F) ) / (ρ * A_v)) )) 

Wait, not sure. Another thought: the volumetric flow rate can be calculated using the area between the float and the tube, multiplied by the velocity of the fluid.

Wait, the formula I think I should use is:

Q = C * A * sqrt( (2 * (G - 1) * g * h) / (1 - (A_r)^2) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up different formulas. Let me think again.

I think the correct approach is to model the rotameter as a variable area meter. The standard equation for a rotameter is:

Q = C * A * sqrt( (2 * g * h (ρ_liquid - ρ_float) ) / (ρ_liquid * A_float) ) )

Wait, not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is based on the pressure difference and flow velocity.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the flow through the annulus around the float. The area of the annulus changes as the float moves up or down.

The area A is the cross-sectional area of the tube at the height of the float minus the cross-sectional area of the float.

Wait, the tube is tapered, so its diameter varies with height. So the diameter at any height h from the bottom can be found using linear interpolation between the bottom and top diameters.

The tube is 18 inches long, with the bottom diameter 1.0 inches and top diameter 1.5 inches. Wait, wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the bottom diameter is 1.0 inches? Or is the top 1.5 and bottom 1.0? Because the tube is tapered, I think the top is larger, so perhaps the bottom is smaller. Wait, the problem says internal diameters of the top and bottom ends are 1.5 and 1.0 inches respectively. So the tube is 18 inches long, top is 1.5 inches diameter, bottom is 1.0 inches. So as you go from bottom to top, the diameter increases.

So the diameter at any height h from the bottom can be calculated using a linear approximation.

So, if h is the height from the bottom, the diameter at that point d(h) = d_bottom + (d_top - d_bottom) * (h / L), where L is the length of the tube (18 in).

So d(h) = 1.0 + (1.5 - 1.0) * (h / 18) = 1.0 + 0.5*(h/18) = 1.0 + h/36 inches.

So the radius at height h is r(h) = d(h)/2 = (1.0 + h/36)/2 = 0.5 + h/(72) inches.

Now, the cross-sectional area of the tube at height h is A_tube(h) = π [r(h)]^2.

The floating cork has a diameter of 1.0 inches, so its radius is 0.5 inches. Its cross-sectional area is A_cork = π (0.5)^2 = π * 0.25 in².

The annular area A around the cork is A_tube(h) - A_cork.

So, A = π [ (0.5 + h/72 )^2 - (0.5)^2 ].

Simplify that:

(0.5 + h/72 )^2 = 0.25 + (h/72)(1) + (h/72)^2.

Wait, more accurately, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

So,

(0.5 + h/(72))^2 = 0.25 + 2*(0.5)*(h/72) + (h/72)^2

= 0.25 + (h/72) + (h²)/(72²).

Then,

A = π [ (0.25 + h/72 + h²/(72^2)) - 0.25 ) ]

= π ( h/72 + h²/(72^2) )

= π h (1/72 + h/(72^2)) )

= π h ( (72 + h) ) / (72^2) )

Wait, perhaps factor it differently, but maybe it's better to just keep it as A = π [ (r_tube)^2 - r_cork^2 ].

Wait, perhaps that's the way to go.

Alternatively, the area can be written as A = π ( (d_tube/2)^2 - (d_cork/2)^2 ) = (π/4)(d_tube² - d_cork²).

Because A = π (r_tube² - r_cork²) and r = d/2, so r² = d²/4.

Thus, A = (π/4)(d_tube² - d_cork²).

So, since d_cork is 1.0 inches, d_cork² is 1.0²=1.

d_tube is 1.0 + h/36 inches, so d_tube squared is (1 + h/36)^2.

So,

A = (π/4) [ (1 + h/36 )^2 - 1 ]

= (π/4) [ 1 + 2*(h/36) + (h/36)^2 - 1 ]

= (π/4) [ (2h/36) + (h^2)/(36^2) )

= (π/4) [ (h/18) + h²/(1296) )

= (π/4) [ h(1/18 + h/(1296)) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as A = (π/4) * (h/18) * [ 1 + (h)/(72) ) ]

Wait, because 1/18 is 72/1296, and h/(1296) is (h/72)/18, but perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to leave A as (π/4)( (1 + h/36)^2 -1 ), and compute it when needed.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the flow equation.

I think the general equation for a variable-area flowmeter (rotameter) is:

Q = C * A * sqrt( (2 (ρ_liquid - ρ_float) g h ) / (ρ_liquid (1 - (A_cork / A_tube) )) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The flow through the annulus creates a pressure drop. The float's weight and buoyancy balance this.

Wait, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of displaced fluid. The weight of the float is V_float * ρ_float * g. Buoyant force is V_submerged * ρ_liquid * g. The difference between these would be the force due to the pressure drop.

Alternatively, perhaps using Torricelli's law, considering the flow through the annulus.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a standard formula for rotameter calculations.

Upon recalling, the formula for a rotameter is often given as:

Q = (C * A) * sqrt( 2 (ρ_liquid (1 - (ρ_float / ρ_liquid )) ) g h )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the equation might involve the area and the density difference.

Wait, let me think of the energy balance. The pressure drop across the rotameter creates a head that drives the flow. The pressure drop Δp is related to the height of the liquid in the manometer, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the head difference (h) in the rotameter relates to the flow rate via the equation:

Q = C * A * sqrt(2 g h ( (ρ_liquid - ρ_float) / ρ_liquid )) )

Wait, that seems plausible. Let me break it down.

The term (ρ_liquid - ρ_float) is the density difference causing buoyancy. So the equation would have a square root of (2 g h (1 - (ρ_float/ρ_liquid)) ), but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let's try to derive it.

The weight of the float is W = V_float * ρ_float * g.

The buoyant force is F_b = V_submerged * ρ_liquid * g.

In equilibrium, the net force is W - F_b = F_drag, where F_drag is the drag force due to the flow. But perhaps that's more mechanical, and maybe not directly helpful.

Alternatively, considering the energy equation, the pressure difference across the annulus would drive the flow. The head loss h is related to the velocity.

Wait, the pressure drop across the annulus would be Δp = (1/2) ρ_liquid v^2 * (1 + β^2 ), where β is the area ratio, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, for an orifice, the pressure drop relates to the velocity via Torricelli's law.

Wait, perhaps using the equation for flow through an orifice. The volumetric flow rate Q = C * A * sqrt(2 g h), where h is the head difference. But in a rotameter, the 'head' would be the height of the float, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the rotameter's operation is such that the height of the float h is directly related to the flow rate. So maybe the equation is Q = C * A(h) * sqrt(2 g h), but I'm not confident about the exact form.

Wait, I think I need to find a better approach. Let me look for the standard formula for a rotameter. From what I remember, the flow rate Q is given by:

Q = (C * A) * sqrt( (2 g h (ρ_liquid - ρ_float) ) / (ρ_liquid) ) )

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Q = C * A * sqrt( 2 g h (1 - (ρ_float/ρ_liquid)) )

Wait, that seems plausible. Let me proceed with that.

So, the formula would be Q = C * A * sqrt( 2 g h (1 - (ρ_float/ρ_liquid)) )

I can solve for h, the height of the float from the bottom.

First, let's compute the various terms.

Given:

Q = 1.80 gpm. I need to convert this into consistent units. Let's convert to cubic inches per second, because the other units are in inches and seconds (gravity in ft/s², but we'll handle that).

1 gallon = 231 cubic inches. 1 minute = 60 seconds.

So Q (in^3/s) = (1.80 gal/min) * (231 in^3/gal) / (60 s/min) = (1.80 * 231) / 60.

Calculate that:

1.80 * 231 = 415.8, divided by 60 is 6.93 in^3/s.

But wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 gpm is 0.00222817 m³/s, but perhaps better to compute it as:

1.80 gpm = 1.80 * 0.00378541 m³/min = but perhaps better to stick with inch units.

Alternatively, 1 gal = 231 in³, 1 min=60 sec.

So,

Q = 1.80 * 231 / 60 = (1.80 * 3.85) in³/s.

Wait, 231 /60 is 3.85. 1.80 * 3.85 ≈ 6.93 in³/s.

Wait, that seems high. Wait, no, 1 gpm is 0.06308 liters per second, but in in³/s, 1 gpm is about 0.3208 in³/s, so 1.80 gpm is 0.577 in³/s. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, correct calculation: 1 gal = 231 in³. 1 min=60 sec.

So, 1 gpm = 231 in³ / 60 s = 3.85 in³/min? No, wait, no. Wait, 231 in³ per 60 seconds is 231/60 = 3.85 in³ per minute, but that's per minute. Wait, no, wait: 3.85 in³ per minute is 3.85 /60 in³/s.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 1 gpm is 231 in³ per minute. So per second, it's 231 / 60 ≈ 3.85 in³ per minute → 3.85 /60 ≈ 0.06417 in³/s.

So 1.80 gpm is 1.80 * 0.06417 ≈ 0.1155 in³/s.

Wait, that makes more sense. So Q ≈ 0.1155 in³/s.

But perhaps I should carry the exact fractions.

Alternatively, calculate Q in in³/s:

Q = 1.80 gpm * (231 in³/gal) / (60 s/min) = (1.80 * 231) / 60 = (393.3) /60 ≈ 6.555 in³/min → wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1.80 *231 = 415.8 in³/min, divided by 60 gives 6.93 in³/min, which is 6.93 /60 ≈ 0.1155 in³/s. So yes, Q ≈ 0.1155 in³/s.

Now, the coefficient C is 0.74.

The area A is a function of h, as derived earlier. So A = (π/4)[ (1 + h/36 )^2 - 1 ].

But let's compute A in terms of h.

Wait, (1 + h/36)^2 = 1 + 2*(h/36) + (h/36)^2. So (1 + h/36)^2 -1 = 2h/36 + h²/(36^2) = h/18 + h²/1296.

So,

A = (π/4) * ( h/18 + h²/(1296) ) 

Simplify:

h/18 = 72 h / (18 *72) = wait, perhaps factor out h:

A = (π/4) * h (1/18 + h/(1296)) )

Alternatively, factor out 1/18:

A = (π/4) * h * [ 1/18 ( 1 + h/(72) ) ]

So,

A = (π/4) * (h/18) * (1 + h/(72)) ) 

= (π h (1 + h/72)) ) / (4 * 18 )

= (π h (1 + h/72)) ) / 72 

So, A = (π h (72 + h) ) / (72 * 72 )

Wait, perhaps that's making it more complicated. Let's just keep A as (π/4)( (1 + h/36)^2 -1 ).

Now, the formula I have is:

Q = C * A * sqrt( 2 g h (1 - (ρ_float/ρ_liquid )) )

Wait, but I'm not completely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Q = C * A * sqrt( 2 ( ρ_liquid - ρ_float ) g h / ( ρ_liquid ) )

Which would be the same as:

Q = C * A * sqrt( 2 g h (1 - (ρ_float/ρ_ liquid )) )

Yes, because (ρ_liquid - ρ_float) / ρ_liquid = 1 - (ρ_float/ρ_liquid )

So, the formula is correct.

Now, the specific gravity of the float is 4.74. So ρ_float = 4.74 * ρ_water.

Assuming the liquid is water, ρ_liquid = ρ_water = 62.4 lb/ft³. Wait, but we need to convert units because in the formula, we have to
