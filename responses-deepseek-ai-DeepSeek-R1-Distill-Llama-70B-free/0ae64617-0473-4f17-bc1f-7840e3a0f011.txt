Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Addison's Act had been conceived in the belief that, unless working-class aspirations were quickly met after the war, Britain might experience a revolution similar to that in Russia. By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, "having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question and the provided text carefully.

The question is about Addison's Act and changes to a housing scheme. The excerpt is from a book by Hermione Hobhouse about public housing in Poplar during the inter-war years. 

Let me break down the information given. Addison's Act was created because there was a fear that if working-class aspirations weren't met after the war, Britain might have a revolution like Russia's. So the government was probably trying to prevent unrest by providing housing. But by 1920, that fear started to go away, and Addison's policies were seen as too extravagant. 

Then, the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme had provisional plans approved in September 1920. But the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, citing the Council's commitments and available money. In May 1921, the Government announced a drastic cut in the housing program, cutting the target by half.

Now, the question is asking which option best describes the change in plans. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Housing was a large part of the British budget. The text doesn't directly say this, but since the government was cutting the housing target by half, it implies that maybe housing was a significant budget item that needed to be reduced. I'm not sure yet.

Option B: The government Housing Board was indifferent towards the housing program. The Board deferred the scheme and later cut the target, which shows more than indifference; it's active reduction, so maybe not B.

Option C: The Borough's scheme was approved without issues. But the text says the Council was surprised when the scheme was deferred, implying that the approval wasn't without issues. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The government wanted to build more houses. No, they cut the target, so D is wrong.

Option E: The government announced an increase in May 1921. No, it was a drastic curtailment, so E is incorrect.

Option F: The government planned to increase the target. No, they cut it, so F is wrong.

Option G: The Council expected the deferment. The text says the Council was surprised, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Workers were threatening communist revolution. The fear of revolution was there initially, but by 1920 it was receding, so maybe this isn't the current situation. So H might not be the best fit.

Option I: Welfare programs were questioned after WWI. The text says that after the war, the fear of revolution was there, but by 1920, the policy was seen as extravagant, so welfare programs like housing were being questioned. I think I is a strong contender.

Option J: Addison's Act was widely appreciated. The text says the policy was regarded as extravagant, implying criticism, so J is incorrect.

Putting it together, the best description is that welfare programs were being questioned after the war, which aligns with Option I.

The correct answer is I: Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.

I

The best answer is I.
