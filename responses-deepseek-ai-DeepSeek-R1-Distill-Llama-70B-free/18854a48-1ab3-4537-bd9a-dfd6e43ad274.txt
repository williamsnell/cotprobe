Question:

Pursuant to a newly enacted statute, Congress created a nine-member agency empowered to promulgate rules governing air quality standards for the nation. In accordance with the statute, the President was authorized to appoint a majority of six members to the agency, and the other three positions were to be filled by the Senate. The nine members were duly appointed to the agency, and all appointees were subsequently approved in confirmation hearings. Thereafter, the agency issued the following regulations:(a) Requiring each motor vehicle operating in the United States to be equipped with a specified air/fuel control device;(b) Requiring each gas or oil furnace located in the United States to be fitted with a specified device to reduce emissions;(c) Requiring each State to establish and maintain a program under which each vehicle and each furnace shall be tested annually for compliance with federal emissions standards. Which of the following arguments would provide the strongest constitutional grounds against the authority of the statute?

Options:

A: The President does not have the constitutional power to appoint members to an administrative agency without the approval of Congress.
B: An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to issue regulations that directly affect the economy without the approval of Congress.
C: The President does not have the constitutional power to appoint a majority of members to an administrative agency.
D: An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to enforce regulations on private property without due process.
E: The statute is unconstitutional because it grants too much power to a single administrative agency.
F: An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).
G: The statute is unconstitutional because it does not provide for judicial review of agency decisions.
H: An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to promulgate regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.
I: Congress does not have the executive authority to appoint members to an administrative agency.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this constitutional law question about an administrative agency's authority. Let me break it down step by step.

The question involves a statute that creates a nine-member agency. The President appoints six, and the Senate appoints three. They all go through confirmation hearings. Then, the agency issues three regulations: one about vehicle devices, another about furnace devices, and a third requiring states to test annually for compliance.

The question is asking which argument would provide the strongest constitutional grounds against the statute's authority. So, I need to find the option that points out a clear constitutional violation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The President can't appoint without Congress's approval. Wait, the President usually appoints with Senate confirmation, right? Like, under the Appointments Clause, the President nominates, and the Senate confirms. But here, the President is appointing six with approval, and the Senate is appointing three. Maybe that's an issue. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest argument here.

Option B: Agency can't issue econ-related regulations without Congress's approval. Well, agencies do that all the time under delegated authority. Congress can delegate rule-making power, so this might not be the best argument. Unless it's a major rule, but the question doesn't specify that.

Option C: President can't appoint a majority. Hmm, I don't recall a constitutional restriction on the President appointing a majority. The structure is set by Congress, so as long as the appointments are made with proper authority, this might not be an issue.

Option D: Agency can't enforce on private property without due process. Well, regulations typically require due process, but if they're following proper procedures, maybe this isn't the problem. The question doesn't say anything about due process violations in enforcement, so I'm not sure.

Option E: The statute grants too much power to one agency. That sounds like a non-delegation doctrine issue. The Supreme Court has been pretty deferential to Congress on delegating powers. Unless the delegation is without any intelligible principle, which it seems here they have a clear mission (air quality), so E might not be the strongest.

Option F: Agency can't require states to supervise federal guidelines. Oh, this sounds like the anti-commandeering doctrine. Under cases like Printz v. United States, Congress can't compel states to implement federal regulations. So if the agency is requiring states to establish and maintain testing programs, that might be unconstitutional commandeering.

Option G: No judicial review. The statute doesn't say anything about judicial review. The general rule is that agency decisions are subject to judicial review unless explicitly exempted, which is rare. So maybe this isn't a strong argument unless the statute specifically precludes it, which it doesn't seem to.

Option H: Agency can't burden interstate commerce. This touches on the commerce clause. If the regulations affect interstate commerce, the agency needs to have authority under the commerce clause. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here; the question is about the agency's authority, not the commerce clause per se.

Option I: Congress can't appoint members. Wait, the appointments are made by the President and the Senate, which is allowed under the Appointments Clause. The Senate can appoint inferior officers if the statute says so. So I don't think I is correct.

So, the strongest argument seems to be F, because requiring states to enforce federal regulations violates the Tenth Amendment. The agency can't commandeer the states to carry out federal programs unless Congress has the power to do so, which it doesn't under the anti-commandeering doctrine.

The strongest constitutional argument against the statute is that it violates the anti-commandeering doctrine. This doctrine, established by cases like *Printz v. United States*, prohibits Congress from requiring states to implement federal regulations. The statute at issue mandates that states establish and maintain programs to test compliance with federal emissions standards, which directly compels state action. This is a clear violation of the Tenth Amendment, as Congress cannot commandeer state governments to enforce federal guidelines. 

Other options, such as challenges to the appointment process or delegation of authority, do not present as strong a constitutional argument. The appointment structure, while unusual, does not violate the Appointments Clause, and Congress is generally allowed to delegate regulatory power to administrative agencies. Therefore, the most compelling constitutional ground is the commandeering of state authority.
