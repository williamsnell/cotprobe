The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Why is the sky blue?

Options:

A: Because the Earth's magnetic field causes the sky to appear blue.
B: Because the human eye is more sensitive to blue light.
C: Because the Earth's atmosphere contains a large amount of blue pigment.
D: Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.
E: Because blue is the most abundant color in the color spectrum.
F: Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.
G: Because the ozone layer reflects blue light.
H: Because the sun emits blue light more than any other color.
I: Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.
J: Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.

Okay, so I need to figure out why the sky is blue. Hmm, I remember learning about this in school, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think. I think it has something to do with how light interacts with the atmosphere.

Wait, light from the sun is white, right? But when it enters Earth's atmosphere, something happens. Oh yeah, Rayleigh scattering! That's the term. So when sunlight travels through the atmosphere, the light scatters. But why does it scatter more in the blue?

Oh right, the scattering depends on the wavelength of the light. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to colors like red or orange. So the shorter wavelengths get scattered more by the molecules in the atmosphere. That's why the sky appears blue during the day because our eyes pick up all that scattered blue light coming from all directions.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D says the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths. That makes sense because short wavelengths are blue and violet. But wait, why isn't the sky violet then? Oh, because our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and the sun emits more blue light than violet. So the combination makes the sky blue.

Option B says the human eye is more sensitive to blue. That's part of the reason, but the main cause is the scattering. So D seems more accurate.

Other options: A talks about Earth's magnetic field, which I don't think affects the color. C says blue pigment, which isn't right because the atmosphere doesn't have pigments. E says blue is most abundant, but that's not accurate because the Sun's spectrum peaks in green, but our eyes perceive blue because of scattering.

F says molecules have blue colorâ€”that's not it. G is ozone reflecting blue; no, ozone absorbs some UV but doesn't reflect blue. H says sun emits more blue, which isn't exactly true. The Sun's emission peaks near yellow. I says atmosphere absorbs others, which is partially true in scattering, but D is more precise.

J says sky reflects oceans. Well, that's a common myth, but the sky's color is due to scattering, not reflection from the oceans. So D is the correct answer.

The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the molecules and small particles present. Sunlight is composed of various colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to colors like red or orange, and shorter wavelengths are scattered more efficiently by the atmosphere. This preferential scattering of shorter wavelengths (blue light) in all directions makes the sky appear blue. While the human eye's sensitivity to blue light and the Sun's emission spectrum play roles, the primary reason is the atmosphere's scattering of shorter wavelengths.

Option D correctly identifies this process, making it the best answer.

Answer: D
