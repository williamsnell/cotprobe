Question:

What features enable the ferns to grow to a much largersize than the mosses?

Options:

A: Ferns grow larger because they can perform photosynthesis more efficiently than mosses
B: Ferns grow larger due to higher nutrient content
C: Ferns grow larger due to a stronger stem
D: Ferns grow larger due to their ability to move to more fertile areas
E: Mosses are limited in size by their shorter life cycle compared to ferns
F: Ferns have a symbiotic relationship with fungi that allows them to grow larger
G: Because of the presence of an elaborate root system and a vascular system, the ferns are able to grow to a much larger size than are the mosses.
H: Ferns grow larger because they have larger leaves
I: Ferns grow larger due to the presence of growth-promoting bacteria in their rhizosphere
J: Ferns grow larger because they are more resistant to pests and diseases

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why ferns can grow much larger than mosses. I remember from biology class that plants have different structures that help them grow. Mosses are those small, non-vascular plants, right? They don't have real roots, stems, or leaves like the more complex plants do. Ferns, on the other hand, are vascular plants, which I think means they have a system inside them for transporting water and nutrients.

Wait, what's the vascular system called? Oh right, xylem and phloem. Xylem transports water and minerals from the roots up to the rest of the plant, while phloem moves sugars produced by photosynthesis. Mosses don't have this, so they rely on diffusion which isn't as efficient, especially for larger plants. Without a vascular system, mosses can't get the necessary water and nutrients to all parts of a larger plant, so they stay small.

Ferns also have true roots, stems, and leaves. Their roots can dig deeper into the soil to get more water and nutrients. The vascular tissues allow them to transport these resources efficiently throughout the plant, supporting larger growth. Mosses, lacking these structures, can't grow as tall or wide because they can't effectively distribute resources beyond a certain size.

Looking at the options, option G says it's because of an elaborate root system and vascular system. That makes sense because those structures support the transport of water and nutrients, enabling larger size. Other options, like A, talk about photosynthesis efficiency, but both plants photosynthesize; the difference is more about transportation. Option C mentions a stronger stem, which is part of it, but the vascular system is the key. Option G seems to cover both the root system and the vascular tissues, which are the main factors.

The ability of ferns to grow much larger than mosses is due to the presence of an elaborate root system and a vascular system. These structures enable efficient transportation of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, allowing ferns to support larger growth. In contrast, mosses lack these systems and rely on diffusion, limiting their size.

G: Because of the presence of an elaborate root system and a vascular system, the ferns are able to grow to a much larger size than are the mosses.

Answer: G
