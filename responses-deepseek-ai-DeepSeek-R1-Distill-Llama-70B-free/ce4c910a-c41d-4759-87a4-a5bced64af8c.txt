Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Kate's coin collection. She keeps 7 coins in a box, and that's only 5% of her entire collection. I need to find out the total number of coins she has.

Hmm, 5% of her collection is 7 coins. So I think I can set up an equation here. Let me call the total number of coins "x". So 5% of x equals 7. 

Wait, how do I write that mathematically? Oh right, 5% is the same as 5 per 100, or 0.05 in decimal. So the equation would be 0.05 * x = 7.

Now I need to solve for x. To get x by itself, I should divide both sides of the equation by 0.05. So x = 7 divided by 0.05. Let me calculate that.

Dividing 7 by 0.05... Hmm, I remember that dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20 because 1/0.05 is 20. So 7 times 20 is 140. So x equals 140.

Wait, let me double-check that. If 5% of 140 is 7, then that makes sense because 10% of 140 is 14, so 5% would be half of that, which is 7. Yep, that checks out.

So looking at the options, option F is 140. So the answer should be F.
