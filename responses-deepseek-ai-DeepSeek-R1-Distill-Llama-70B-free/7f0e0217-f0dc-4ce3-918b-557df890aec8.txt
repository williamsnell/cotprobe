Alright, so I've got this problem here about a random variable R that follows a Rayleigh distribution. The question asks for the expected value E[R], the expected value of R squared E[R²], and the variance σ² of R. Then I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the Rayleigh distribution is often used in statistics, especially in fields like communication and signal processing. The probability density function (pdf) is given by f(r) = (r / α²) e^(-(r²)/(2α²)) for r ≥ 0, and zero otherwise.

So, for part (a), finding E[R]. I think the expected value for a Rayleigh distribution is something involving the square root of π and α. Wait, the formula I remember is E[R] = α * sqrt(π/2). Let me check that. Oh right, because the Rayleigh distribution is a specific case of the chi distribution with two degrees of freedom, and the expectation is sqrt(π/2) times the scale parameter α.

Moving on to part (b), E[R²]. I think for this, it's related to the second moment. I recall that Var(R) = E[R²] - (E[R])². But wait, maybe I should think about the moments of the Rayleigh distribution directly. Another approach: the Rayleigh distribution can be seen as the distribution of the magnitude of a 2D Gaussian vector with both components having variance α². The magnitude squared would then be the sum of squares of two independent Gaussians, which should follow a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, scaled by α². Oh wait, the sum of squares of two standard normals is chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom, which is an exponential distribution. So, for R², since R is the square root of that sum times α, R² would be α² times a chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom divided by 2? Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I think the second moment E[R²] for Rayleigh is 2α². Wait, because if R is Rayleigh with parameter α, then R² has an expectation of 2α². Let me think: The pdf is f(r) = (r/α²) e^(-r²/(2α²)). To find E[R²], I need to integrate r² * f(r) dr from 0 to infinity. That would be ∫0^∞ r² * (r/α²) e^(-r²/(2α²)) dr. Let me make a substitution: let u = r²/(2α²), so du = r dr / α². Hmm, maybe a better substitution is t = r². Or perhaps using gamma functions. Oh wait, the integral becomes ∫0^∞ (r^3 / α²) e^(-r²/(2α²)) dr. Let me make a substitution: let x = r²/(2α²), so r² = 2α² x, and r dr = 2α² dx. Wait, that might not help directly. Alternatively, r^3 dr = r^2 * r dr. Let me set u = r²/(2α²), so du = (2r dr)/(2α²) = (r dr)/α². Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of the gamma function. The integral becomes ∫0^∞ r^3 e^(-r²/(2α²)) dr / α². Let me change variable to t = r²/(2α²), so r = sqrt(2 α² t) = α sqrt(2 t). Then dr = (α sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(t)) dt. Substituting, the integral becomes:

∫0^∞ ( (α sqrt(2 t))^3 ) e^{-t} * (α sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(t))) dt ) / α².

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

r = α sqrt(2 t)
r^3 = (α sqrt(2 t))^3 = α^3 (2t)^(3/2) = α^3 2^(3/2) t^(3/2)
e^{-r²/(2α²)} = e^{- (2 α² t) / (2 α²)} = e^{-t}

dr = (α sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(t)) dt

So the integral becomes:

Integral from 0 to ∞ [ α^3 2^(3/2) t^(3/2) * e^{-t} * (α sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(t))) ) ] / α² dt

Let me simplify the terms:

The numerator has α^3 * α = α^4.

2^(3/2) * sqrt(2) = 2^(3/2 + 1/2) = 2^(2) = 4.

t^(3/2) * 1/sqrt(t) = t^(3/2 - 1/2) = t^1.

So putting it together:

α^4 * 4 / (2) ) * ∫0^∞ t * e^{-t} dt.

Wait, 4/2 is 2, so it's 2 α^4 ∫ t e^{-t} dt from 0 to ∞.

The integral of t e^{-t} dt from 0 to ∞ is Γ(2) = 1! = 1.

So the whole thing becomes 2 α^4 * 1 = 2 α^4.

Wait, but I'm calculating E[R²], which is ∫ r² f(r) dr. Wait, no: I set up the integral as ∫ r^3 f(r) dr, because f(r) is (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}, so r² * f(r) is (r^3)/(α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}.

Wait, but I think I messed up the substitution. Because in the substitution, the integral I did was for ∫ r^3 f(r) dr, which would be E[R^3]? No, wait no: E[R²] is ∫0^∞ r² f(r) dr.

Wait, perhaps I should redo this. Let me compute E[R²] as ∫ r² f(r) dr.

So, f(r) = (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}.

Thus, E[R²] = ∫0^∞ r² * (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr = ∫0^∞ (r^3 / α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr.

Wait, that's what I did earlier, and I ended up with 2 α².

Wait, no, in the calculation above, the result after substitution was 2 α^4, but that can't be right because the units don't match. Let me check the substitution again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the substitution steps. Let me try a different approach. The integral for E[R²] is:

E[R²] = ∫0^∞ r² * (r / α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr
= (1/α²) ∫0^∞ r^3 e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr.

Let me make the substitution u = r²/(2α²), so r = sqrt(2 α² u).

Then, dr = (sqrt(2 α²))/(2 sqrt(u)) ) du = (α sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(u)) ) du.

Wait, let me compute r^3: [sqrt(2 α² u)]^3 = (2 α² u)^(3/2) = (2)^(3/2) (α^3) u^(3/2).

So substituting all into the integral:

(1/α²) ∫0^∞ [ (2)^(3/2) α^3 u^(3/2) ] e^{-u} * [ α sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(u)) ) ] du.

Simplify each term:

(1/α²) * (2^(3/2) α^3) * (α sqrt(2)/2) ) ∫ u^(3/2) e^{-u} * (1/sqrt(u)) du.

Simplify the constants:

2^(3/2) * sqrt(2) = 2^(3/2 + 1/2) )= 2^2 =4.

Denominator: 2.

So 4/2 = 2.

So the constants outside: (1/α²) * α^3 * α * 2 = (1/α²) * α^4 * 2 = 2 α².

The integral becomes ∫ u^(3/2 - 1/2) e^{-u} du = ∫ u^1 e^{-u} du = Γ(2) = 1! = 1.

So E[R²] = 2 α² * 1 = 2 α². Okay, that makes sense.

Wait, but I thought earlier that E[R²] might be 2α², but let me think again. Because I remember that for a Rayleigh distribution, the variance is σ² = Var(R) = E[R²] - (E[R])². So if E[R] is α sqrt(π/2), then (E[R])² is (π/2) α². And if E[R²] is 2 α², then Var(R) would be 2 α² - (π/2) α² = α² (2 - π/2) = α² (4/2 - π/2) = α² (4 - π)/2. Wait, that would give Var(R) = (4 - π) α² / 2. But wait, I thought the variance of Rayleigh is (4 - π) α² / 2, which is approximately (4 - 3.1416)/2 * α² ≈ (0.8584)/2 ≈ 0.4292 α². That matches with some options I see.

Wait, but the options given don't all have that. Let me check the options provided.

Looking back, the options are:

Option A: E[R] = sqrt(π) α/2, E[R²] = π α²/2, σ² = (π-3) α² /2.

Option F: E[R]= sqrt(π/2) α, E[R²]=2 α², σ²= α²(0.43).

Wait, 0.43 is approximately (4 - π)/2, since (4 - 3.1416)/2 ≈ 0.8584/2 ≈ 0.4292 ≈ 0.43. So option F's variance is correct. But wait, E[R] in option F is sqrt(π/2) α, which is what I thought earlier. And E[R²] is 2 α², which I just calculated. So option F seems correct for (a) and (b), and variance as 0.43 α², which matches what I just found.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let's check each part.

Option F:

E[R] = sqrt(π/2) * α,

E[R^2] = 2 α²,

σ_r² = α² (0.43)

Which matches my calculations. So the correct option should be F.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option A has E[R]= sqrt(π) α/2. Is that correct? Let me compute sqrt(π/2). sqrt(pi/2) is approximately 1.2533, while sqrt(pi)/2 is about 0.8862. But I thought the expectation is sqrt(pi/2) * alpha, so option F is correct for E[R].

Looking at option I: E[R] = alpha/sqrt(2), which is about 0.707 alpha, which is less than what I calculated. So I think F is the correct option.

The problem involves determining the expected value \( E[R] \), the expected value of \( R^2 \) (\( E[R^2] \)), and the variance \( \sigma^2 \) of a random variable \( R \) that follows a Rayleigh distribution with the probability density function \( f(r) = \frac{r}{\alpha^2} e^{-r^2 / (2\alpha^2)} \) for \( r \geq 0 \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Expected Value \( E[R] \):**  
   The expected value of \( R \) for a Rayleigh distribution is known to be \( E[R] = \alpha \sqrt{\pi/2} \). This result can also be derived by integrating \( r f(r) \) over the range \( [0, \infty) \).

2. **Expected Value \( E[R^2] \):**  
   The second moment \( E[R^2] \) is calculated by integrating \( r^2 f(r) \) over \( [0, \infty) \). Using substitutions and recognizing the integral as related to the gamma function, it is found that \( E[R^2] = 2\alpha^2 \).

3. **Variance \( \sigma^2 \):**  
   The variance is given by \( \sigma^2 = E[R^2] - (E[R])^2 \). Substituting the values of \( E[R] \) and \( E[R^2] \), we get:  
   \[
   \sigma^2 = 2\alpha^2 - \left(\alpha \sqrt{\pi/2}\right)^2 = 2\alpha^2 - \frac{\pi}{2} \alpha^2 = \alpha^2 \left(2 - \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \alpha^2 \frac{4 - \pi}{2}.
   \]  
   Numerically, \( \frac{4 - \pi}{2} \approx 0.43 \), so \( \sigma^2 \approx 0.43 \alpha^2 \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:**  
  \( E[R] = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \alpha \), \( E[R^2] = \frac{\pi}{2} \alpha^2 \), \( \sigma^2 = \frac{\pi - 3}{2} \alpha^2 \).  
  This is incorrect because \( E[R] \) and \( E[R^2] \) do not match the derived values.

- **Option B:**  
  \( E[R] = 2\alpha^2 \), \( E[R^2] = \sqrt{\pi/2} \alpha \), \( \sigma^2 = 0.43 \alpha^2 \).  
  This is incorrect because \( E[R] \) and \( E[R^2] \) are swapped and do not match the derived values.

- **Option C:**  
  \( E[R] = \alpha (1 - e^{-1/2}) \), \( E[R^2] = \alpha^2 \), \( \sigma^2 = \alpha^2 (e - 2) \).  
  This is incorrect because none of the values match the derived results.

- **Option D:**  
  \( E[R] = 0.43 \alpha^2 \), \( E[R^2] = \sqrt{\pi/2} \alpha \), \( \sigma^2 = 2\alpha^2 \).  
  This is incorrect because \( E[R] \) and \( E[R^2] \) are inconsistent with the derived values.

- **Option E:**  
  \( E[R] = \alpha \sqrt{e} \), \( E[R^2] = \alpha^2 \ln(2) \), \( \sigma^2 = \alpha^2 (2 - e/\pi) \).  
  This is incorrect because none of the values match the derived results.

- **Option F:**  
  \( E[R] = \sqrt{\pi/2} \alpha \), \( E[R^2] = 2\alpha^2 \), \( \sigma^2 = 0.43 \alpha^2 \).  
  This matches the derived values exactly.

- **Option G:**  
  \( E[R] = \sqrt{\pi/2} \alpha \), \( E[R^2] = 0.43 \alpha^2 \), \( \sigma^2 = 2\alpha^2 \).  
  This is incorrect because \( E[R^2] \) and \( \sigma^2 \) are swapped.

- **Option H:**  
  \( E[R] = \alpha^2 \), \( E[R^2] = \frac{2}{3} \alpha^2 \), \( \sigma^2 = \frac{4 - \pi}{2} \alpha^2 \).  
  This is incorrect because \( E[R] \) and \( E[R^2] \) do not match the derived values.

- **Option I:**  
  \( E[R] = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}} \), \( E[R^2] = \alpha^2 \), \( \sigma^2 = \frac{\pi - 2}{2} \alpha^2 \).  
  This is incorrect because \( E[R] \) and \( E[R^2] \) do not match the derived values.

- **Option J:**  
  \( E[R] = \alpha \sqrt{2/\pi} \), \( E[R^2] = \frac{3}{2} \alpha^2 \), \( \sigma^2 = \alpha^2 (1 - 2/\pi) \).  
  This is incorrect because \( E[R] \) and \( E[R^2] \) do not match the derived values.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **F**, as it matches the derived values for \( E[R] \), \( E[R^2] \), and \( \sigma^2 \).

**Answer: F**
