Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay and calculating the energy released. Alright, let's try to approach this step by step.

First, the problem statement says that Uranium-238 decays into Thorium-234 and Helium-4. The reaction is given as:

^238_92U → ^234_90Th + ^4_2He

I remember that in such decay processes, the mass of the products is slightly less than the mass of the reactant. This mass difference gets converted into energy, which is released. So the key here is to find the mass defect and then convert that into energy using Einstein's equation E=mc².

The masses are given in atomic mass units (amu). The exact masses are:

- Uranium (U): 238.0508 amu
- Thorium (Th): 234.0437 amu
- Helium (He): 4.0026 amu

So, the first step is to calculate the total mass of the products and subtract that from the mass of the reactant to find the mass defect.

Let's calculate the total mass of the products. That would be the sum of the masses of Th and He.

Th mass = 234.0437 amu
He mass = 4.0026 amu
Total product mass = 234.0437 + 4.0026 = Let me add those. 234.0437 plus 4 is 238.0437, then plus 0.0026 is 238.0463 amu.

Wait, no wait, wait. Let me check that again. 234.0437 + 4.0026. Hmm, 234 +4 is 238, and the decimals: 0.0437 + 0.0026 = 0.0463. So total is 238.0463 amu.

The mass of the Uranium is 238.0508 amu.

So the mass defect (Δm) is the mass of U minus the total product mass. That's 238.0508 - 238.0463.

Let me compute that: 238.0508 minus 238.0463. Subtracting, the 238 cancels out, so 0.0508 - 0.0463 = 0.0045 amu.

So Δm = 0.0045 amu. That's the mass defect.

Now, I need to convert this mass defect into energy. The formula is E = Δm * c². But wait, the units here are in amu, so I need to convert amu into kilograms or grams to compute the energy in ergs or joules.

The problem gives a conversion factor: 1.00073 amu = 1.673e-24 grams. Wait, let me parse that correctly. It says 1.00073 amu equals 1.673 × 10^-24 grams. So to find the mass in grams, I can multiply the amu by (1.673e-24 g / 1.00073 amu).

So first, let's compute the mass defect in grams.

Δm = 0.0045 amu * (1.673e-24 g / 1.00073 amu) 

Wait, because 1 amu is 1.00073 amu in the given conversion. Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-express the given conversion.

Wait, the exact wording is: (1.00073 amu = 1.673e-24 grams). So 1 amu is actually 1.00073 amu? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's a typo. Oh, perhaps it's 1 amu equals 1.673e-24 grams. But the way it's written is: 1.00073 amu=1.673e-24 g. So probably, 1 amu is approximately 1.673e-24 grams, but perhaps the exact value given is 1.00073 amu = 1.673e-24 g. So then 1 amu would be (1.673e-24 g) / 1.00073.

Wait, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Let's just proceed as per the given numbers.

So, for each amu, it's 1.00073 amu = 1.673e-24 grams. So to convert amu to grams, multiply by (1.673e-24 g) / (1.00073 amu).

So for Δm = 0.0045 amu, the mass in grams is:

Δm_grams = 0.0045 amu * (1.673e-24 g / 1.00073 amu)

The amu units cancel out, so:

Δm_grams = 0.0045 * (1.673e-24 / 1.00073) grams.

Let me compute that. First, compute 1.673e-24 divided by 1.00073.

1.673e-24 / 1.00073 ≈ approx 1.673e-24 / 1.0007 ≈ 1.673e-24 * (1/1.0007) ≈ 1.673e-24 * 0.9993 ≈ approximately 1.6714e-24 grams per amu.

So, 0.0045 * 1.6714e-24 g = ?

0.0045 * 1.6714e-24 = Let's compute 0.0045 * 1.6714 = 0.0075213, then times 1e-24.

So Δm_grams ≈ 7.5213e-27 grams.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

1.673e-24 / 1.00073 = Let me calculate it step by step.

1.00073 is approx 1.00073, so 1 / 1.00073 ≈ 0.99927.

So 1.673e-24 * 0.99927 ≈ 1.673 * 0.99927 = let's compute 1.673 * 1 = 1.673, 1.673 * (-0.00073) ≈ -0.00122.

So approximately 1.673 - 0.00122 = 1.67178e-24.

So 1.67178e-24 grams per amu.

So Δm in grams is 0.0045 amu * 1.67178e-24 g/amu = 0.0045 * 1.67178e-24.

Calculating 0.0045 * 1.67178e-24.

0.0045 is 4.5e-3.

4.5e-3 * 1.67178e-24 = (4.5 * 1.67178) e-27.

4.5 * 1.67178 ≈ Let's compute:

4 * 1.67178 = 6.68712

0.5 * 1.67178 = 0.83589

Total = 6.68712 + 0.83589 =7.52299 ≈ 7.523e-27 grams.

So the mass defect Δm is approximately 7.523e-27 grams.

Now, using E = mc².

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e10 cm/s (since 1 m = 100 cm, so 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s).

So E = (7.523e-27 g) * (3e10 cm/s)^2.

Compute (3e10)^2 first: 9e20 cm²/s².

So E = 7.523e-27 g * 9e20 cm²/s².

Multiply the coefficients: 7.523 * 9 ≈ 67.707.

Exponents: 1e-27 * 1e20 = 1e-7.

So E ≈ 67.707e-7 ergs. Because 1 g·cm²/s² = 1 erg.

Wait, 67.707e-7 ergs is 6.7707e-6 ergs.

Wait, but let me compute the exact numbers to make sure.

Wait, 7.523e-27 *9e20 = 7.523 *9 * 1e(-27+20) = 67.707 * 1e-7 = 6.7707e-6 ergs.

So approximately 6.77e-6 ergs.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.72 × 10^-6 ergs, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation of the mass difference was a bit off. Let me recheck that.

Wait, let me recalculate the mass difference:

Uranium: 238.0508 amu.

Products: Th (234.0437) + He (4.0026) = 238.0463 amu.

So Δm = 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. That's correct.

Then, the conversion factor: 1.00073 amu = 1.673e-24 g.

So 1 amu = (1.673e-24) / 1.00073 g.

So 0.0045 amu * (1.673e-24 / 1.00073) g/amu.

Let me calculate 1.673e-24 / 1.00073 exactly.

1.00073 is close to 1, so 1.673e-24 / 1.00073 ≈ 1.673e-24 * (1 - 0.00073) ≈ 1.673e-24 - (1.673e-24 * 0.00073).

Which is about 1.673e-24 - 1.220e-27 = approx 1.67178e-24 grams per amu.

So 0.0045 amu * 1.67178e-24 g/amu = 0.0045 * 1.67178e-24.

Let me compute 0.0045 * 1.67178:

0.0045 * 1.67178 = (4.5e-3) * 1.67178 = 4.5 * 1.67178 * 1e-3.

4.5 * 1.67178 = let's compute:

4 *1.67178 =6.68712

0.5 *1.67178=0.83589

Total: 6.68712 + 0.83589 =7.52299.

So 7.52299e-3 *1e-24 = 7.52299e-27 g.

So the mass in grams is 7.523e-27 grams.

Now, E=mc².

c =3e10 cm/s.

So E=7.523e-27 g * (3e10 cm/s)^2.

(3e10)^2 =9e20 cm²/s².

So 7.523e-27 *9e20 = (7.523 *9) * 1e-7.

7.523 *9: 7*9=63, 0.523*9≈4.707. So total 63 +4.707=67.707.

So 67.707e-7 ergs.

67.707e-7 is 6.7707e-6 erg.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 6.72e-6 ergs.

But wait, my calculation gives approximately 6.77e-6. The options don't have that exact number. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:3.21e-6

B:2.98e-6

C:6.72e-6

D:5.00e-6

E:5.55e-6

F:4.65e-6

G:7.00e-6

H:8.44e-6

I:9.32e-6

J:7.89e-6

So option C is 6.72e-6, which is close to my calculated 6.77e-6. Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check each step again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass difference calculation. Let me do that again.

238.0508 (U) - (234.0437 +4.0026) = ?

234.0437 +4.0026 = 238.0463.

238.0508 -238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. That's correct.

So Δm =0.0045 amu.

Then, 1.00073 amu =1.673e-24 g.

So 1 amu is 1.673e-24 /1.00073 g.

Compute that exactly:

1.673e-24 /1.00073 = Let's compute 1.673e-24 divided by 1.00073.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.0045 amu * (1.673e-24 g /1.00073 amu).

So:

0.0045 * (1.673e-24 /1.00073) = (0.0045 *1.673e-24 ) /1.00073.

Compute numerator: 0.0045 *1.673e-24 = (4.5e-3) *1.673e-24 = 7.5235e-27 grams.

Then, divide by 1.00073: 7.5235e-27 /1.00073 ≈ approx 7.5235e-27 * (1/1.00073) ≈ 7.5235e-27 * 0.99927 = approx 7.507e-27 grams.

So more accurately, Δm is approximately 7.507e-27 grams.

Now, E= mc².

c=3e10 cm/s.

So E=7.507e-27 g * (3e10 cm/s)^2.

Compute that:

(3e10)^2 =9e20 cm²/s².

7.507e-27 *9e20 = (7.507 *9) * 1e-7.

7.507 *9: 7 *9=63, 0.507*9=4.563. So 63 +4.563=67.563.

So 67.563e-7 ergs =6.7563e-6 ergs.

Approximately 6.756e-6 ergs.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.72e-6, which is close but not exact. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another approach to compute the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass defect more accurately.

Wait, the mass of U is 238.0508 amu.

The mass of Th is 234.0437 amu.

The mass of He is 4.0026 amu.

So total product mass: 234.0437 +4.0026 = 238.0463 amu.

So mass loss Δm = 238.0508 - 238.0463 =0.0045 amu.

Wait, that's correct.

Now, to convert Δm to kg or g.

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated the grams part.

Wait, the conversion is: 1.00073 amu = 1.673e-24 grams.

So 0.0045 amu * (1.673e-24 g /1.00073 amu) = (0.0045 *1.673e-24) /1.00073.

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

0.0045 *1.673e-24 = 0.0045 *1.673 =0.0075215, so 7.5215e-27 grams.

Divide by 1.00073: 7.5215e-27 /1.00073 ≈ let's compute this.

Using calculator-like approach: 7.5215e-27 /1.00073 ≈ 7.5215e-27 * (1/1.00073).

Since 1/1.00073 ≈0.99927 (using approximation 1/(1+x) ≈1 -x for small x), so 7.5215e-27 *0.99927 ≈7.5215e-27 *0.99927.

Multiplying 7.5215 by 0.99927:

7.5215 *0.99927 = let's compute:

7.5215 *1 =7.5215.

Subtract 7.5215 *0.00073.

7.5215 *0.00073: approx 0.0055 (since 7 *0.0007 is 0.0049, and 0.5215 *0.00073 is about 0.00038, so total around 0.00528).

So 7.5215 -0.00528 ≈7.5162.

So Δm ≈7.5162e-27 grams.

Now, compute E=mc².

c is 3e10 cm/s.

E=7.5162e-27 g * (3e10 cm/s)^2.

Compute (3e10)^2 =9e20 cm²/s².

So 7.5162e-27 *9e20 = (7.5162 *9) *1e-7.

7.5162 *9: 7*9=63, 0.5162*9≈4.6458. So total 67.6458.

So E=67.6458e-7 ergs =6.76458e-6 ergs ≈6.7646e-6 ergs.

Wait, so approximately 6.76e-6 ergs.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.72e-6, option J is 7.89e-6, option G is7e-6, but none exactly match 6.76e-6.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck the initial mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the product mass.

Wait, Th is 234.0437, He is 4.0026.

234.0437 +4.0026: Let me add more carefully.

234.0437 +4.0026.

234 +4 =238.

0.0437 +0.0026 =0.0463.

So product mass is 238.0463 amu. Uranium is 238.0508.

Difference is
