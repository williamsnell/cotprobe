Question:

One approach to handling fuzzy logic data might be to design a computer using ternary (base-3) logic so that data could be stored as “true,” “false,” and “unknown.” If each ternary logic element is called a flit, how many flits are required to represent at least 256 different values?

Options:

A: 9
B: 4
C: 2
D: 11
E: 10
F: 5
G: 3
H: 6
I: 8
J: 7

Okay, so I've got this question about fuzzy logic and ternary systems. Hmm, I need to figure out how many flits are required to represent at least 256 different values. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in a ternary (base-3) system, each digit can have one of three values. In this case, the flit can be "true," "false," or "unknown." So each flit represents a digit in base 3.

Now, the question is about how many such flits are needed to get at least 256 different values. I think this is about the total number of unique combinations possible with n flits. Each flit adds a factor of 3 because there are three possibilities.

So, the total number of values is 3 raised to the power of n (number of flits). We need to find the smallest n where 3^n is greater than or equal to 256.

Let me calculate 3^n for different n.

n=1: 3^1 = 3. That's way too small.
n=2: 3^2=9. Still too small.
n=3: 27. Not enough.
n=4: 81. Still less than 256.
n=5: 243. Hmm, 243 is still under 256.
n=6: 729. Oh, that's way more than 256.

Wait, so 3^5 is 243, which is less than 256. So n=5 isn't enough. The next one is n=6, which gives 729, which is more than 256. So we need 6 flits to represent at least 256 different values.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is 5 and H is 6. So the correct answer should be 6 flits.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Because 3^5 is 243, which is less than 256. So 5 flits can't cover 256 possibilities. So yes, 6 is needed.

To determine how many flits (ternary digits) are required to represent at least 256 different values, we calculate the number of unique combinations possible with \( n \) flits in a base-3 system. Each flit can take on 3 values ("true," "false," or "unknown"), so the total number of combinations is \( 3^n \). We need the smallest \( n \) such that \( 3^n \geq 256 \).

- For \( n = 1 \): \( 3^1 = 3 \) (too small)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( 3^2 = 9 \) (too small)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( 3^3 = 27 \) (too small)
- For \( n = 4 \): \( 3^4 = 81 \) (too small)
- For \( n = 5 \): \( 3^5 = 243 \) (still less than 256)
- For \( n = 6 \): \( 3^6 = 729 \) (greater than 256)

Thus, \( n = 6 \) flits are required to represent at least 256 different values. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **H: 6**.
