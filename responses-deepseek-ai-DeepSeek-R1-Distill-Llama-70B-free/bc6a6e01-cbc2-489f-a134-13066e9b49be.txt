Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a grain of sand falling from rest to gain kinetic energy equal to the energy of a quantum of visible light. Hmm, interesting.

Alright, let's break it down. The grain has a mass of 10^-5 grams. Wait, grams? I usually work in kilograms, so I should convert that. Oh right, 1 gram is 0.001 kg, so 10^-5 grams is 10^-8 kg. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 gram is 1e-3 kg, so 1e-5 grams is 1e-5 * 1e-3 kg = 1e-8 kg? Yeah, that's right.

The light has a frequency of 5e14 sec^-1. The energy of a quantum, which is a photon, is given by E = h*f, where h is Planck's constant. I remember h is 6.626e-34 J*s. So let's compute that.

E_photon = 6.626e-34 * 5e14 = let's see, 6.626 *5 is about 33.13, and the exponents 1e-34 *1e14 is 1e-20. So E_photon is approximately 33.13e-20 J, which is 3.313e-19 J.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 6.626e-34 times 5e14. Multiply 6.626 *5 first. 6 *5 is 30, 0.626*5 is 3.13, so total 33.13. Then 1e-34 *1e14 is 1e-20. So yes, 33.13e-20 J is 3.313e-19 J.

Now, the grain of sand needs to have the same kinetic energy when it falls. Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But since it's falling from rest, I can use the formula KE = mgh, where h is the height. So I need to find h such that mgh equals the photon's energy.

So setting mgh = E_photon.

h = E_photon / (m * g)

I know m is 1e-8 kg, and g is 9.8 m/s².

So plugging in the numbers:

h = (3.313e-19 J) / (1e-8 kg * 9.8 m/s²)

Wait, let me compute the denominator first. 1e-8 *9.8 is 9.8e-8.

So h = 3.313e-19 / 9.8e-8 = ?

Let me compute that division. 3.313 / 9.8 is approximately 0.338 (since 9.8 is about 10, 3.313/10 is 0.3313, a bit less). Let's do it accurately: 3.313 divided by 9.8.

9.8 times 0.3 is 2.94. 3.313-2.94 is 0.373. Bring down a zero (since I'm doing decimal division). 9.8 goes into 37.3 about 3 times (9.8 *3=29.4). Subtract 29.4 from 37.3, get 7.9. Bring down another zero: 79. 9.8 goes into 79 about 8 times (9.8*8=78.4). Subtract, get 0.6. So approximately 0.338 cm? Wait, no, units? Wait, no, I'm not done yet.

Wait, no, the calculation is 3.313e-19 / 9.8e-8 = (3.313 /9.8) * 1e-11. Because 1e-19 /1e-8 is 1e-11.

3.313 /9.8 is approx 0.338, so 0.338e-11 meters. Because 1e-11 meters is 1e-8 cm? Wait, no, 1e-11 m is 1e-8 cm? Wait, wait, no. Because 1 m is 1e2 cm, so 1e-11 m is 1e-13 cm. Wait, wait, no. Let me think:

Wait, 1 m = 100 cm. So 1e-11 m = 1e-11 * 100 cm = 1e-9 cm. Oh wait, no. Because 1 m = 100 cm. So 1e-11 m = (1e-11) * (100 cm) ) = 1e-9 cm. Oh, right, because 1e-11 *1e2 is 1e-9.

So 0.338e-11 meters is 0.338e-9 cm, which is 3.38e-10 cm.

Wait, let me redo the exponent calculation. Because 3.313e-19 /9.8e-8 = (3.313/9.8) * (1e-19 /1e-8) ) = 0.338 * 1e-11.

Wait, 1e-19 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-27? No, wait, no. Wait, 1e-19 /1e-8 is 1e(-19 - (-8)) )= 1e-11.

So yes, 0.338 *1e-11 m is 3.38e-12 m? Wait, no. Wait, 0.338e-11 m is 3.38e-12 m? No, 0.338e-11 is the same as 3.38e-12 m. Because 0.338 is 3.38e-1. So 3.38e-1 * 1e-11 = 3.38e-12 m.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because I thought earlier about 1e-11 m being 1e-9 cm. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1e-11 meters is equal to (1e-11 m) * (100 cm/m) )= 1e-9 cm. Because 1e-11 *1e2 is 1e-9. So 0.338e-11 meters is 3.38e-12 meters. Oh wait, no, 0.338e-11 m is 3.38e-12 m? No, that can't be right. Wait, 0.338 is 3.38 times 10^-1. So 0.338e-11 is 3.38e-12. So that's correct.

Wait, but then 3.38e-12 meters is 3.38e-12 * 100 cm/m = 3.38e-10 cm. Oh, because 1e-12 m is 1e-14 cm? Wait, no. Wait, 1 m is 1e2 cm, so 1e-12 m is 1e-12 *1e2 cm = 1e-10 cm. So 3.38e-12 m is 3.38e-10 cm. Oh, that's the answer.

So the height is approximately 3.38e-10 cm.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.38e-10 cm. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure. Because sometimes I get mixed up with exponents.

Let me recalculate the energy of the photon. E = h*f. h=6.626e-34, f=5e14. So 6.626e-34 *5e14 = (6.626 *5 )e(-34+14) = 33.13e-20 = 3.313e-19 J. Correct.

Then, KE = mgh = (1e-8 kg) * g * h. So h = KE/(m*g) = (3.313e-19) / (1e-8 *9.8). 1e-8 *9.8 is 9.8e-8. So h = 3.313e-19 /9.8e-8 = (3.313 /9.8) *1e-11.

3.313 /9.8 is approximately 0.338. So 0.338e-11 m. Wait, 0.338e-11 m is 3.38e-12 m, which is 3.38e-10 cm. So yes, that's correct.

So option E is the right answer.

To determine the height through which a grain of sand must fall to acquire a kinetic energy equal to the energy of a quantum of visible light, we proceed as follows:

1. **Energy of the photon**: The energy of a photon is given by \( E = h \cdot f \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant and \( f = 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}^{-1} \) is the frequency of the light.  
   \[
   E = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 5 \times 10^{14} = 3.313 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Kinetic energy of the grain of sand**: The kinetic energy of the grain is related to the height \( h \) through which it falls by \( KE = mgh \), where \( m = 10^{-5} \, \text{g} = 10^{-8} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the grain and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Setting \( KE = E \), we solve for \( h \):  
   \[
   h = \frac{E}{m \cdot g} = \frac{3.313 \times 10^{-19}}{10^{-8} \cdot 9.8}.
   \]

3. **Simplifying the expression**:  
   \[
   h = \frac{3.313 \times 10^{-19}}{9.8 \times 10^{-8}} = \frac{3.313}{9.8} \cdot 10^{-11}.
   \]  
   Performing the division \( \frac{3.313}{9.8} \approx 0.338 \), we find:  
   \[
   h = 0.338 \cdot 10^{-11} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Converting to centimeters**: Since \( 1 \, \text{m} = 10^2 \, \text{cm} \), \( 10^{-11} \, \text{m} = 10^{-9} \, \text{cm} \). Thus:  
   \[
   h = 0.338 \cdot 10^{-9} \, \text{cm} = 3.38 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{cm}.
   \]

5. **Matching with the options**: The calculated height \( h = 3.38 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{cm} \) corresponds to option **E**.
