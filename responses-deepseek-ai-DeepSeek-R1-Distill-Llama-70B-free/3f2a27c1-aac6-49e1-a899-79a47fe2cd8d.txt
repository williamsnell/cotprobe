The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Walter, a widower, died in 1997 leaving $1,000,000 to Trend Trust Company in trust to pay the income to his son, Stan, for life. Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. "Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?

Options:

A: No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.
B: Yes, because Grace is the only surviving child of Harriet and therefore is entitled to the income from the trust.
C: Yes, because the death of Stan and Morgana in an airplane crash in 2009 triggered the provision for the income to be paid to the living children of Harriet.
D: Yes, because that was Walter's intent.
E: No, because the trust was to be paid to Grace only after the death of any widow of Stan, and Morgana's death nullified this provision.
F: Yes, because there is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income from the trust.
G: Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.
H: No, because the trust explicitly states that the income is to be paid to the living children of Harriet only after the death of Stan's widow.
I: No, because the Rule against Perpetuities prevents the trust from being held indefinitely.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about trusts and the Rule against Perpetuities. I'm a bit rusty on my trust law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Let me start by reading the question carefully. Walter set up a trust for his son Stan, giving the income to Stan for life. After Stan's death, the income goes to Stan's widow. Then, upon the widow's death, the income goes to the living children of Walter's sister, Harriet, in equal shares. 

Now, Harriet's only surviving child is Grace, born in 2001. Stan and his wife Morgana died in 2009. The question is whether Harriet can get the income distributed to Grace now.

Wait, so what's the timeline here? Walter died in 1997. The trust was created then. Stan was alive, so he started getting the income. The trust says that upon Stan's death, the income goes to his widow. But both Stan and Morgana died in 2009. So, after Stan's death, the widow would have been Morgana, but she also died. So what happens next? Does the income go to Harriet's children immediately?

But wait, the trust says upon Stan's death, the income is paid to Stan's widow. Upon her death, then it goes to Harriet's children. So if both Stan and Morgana die, does the next beneficiary take effect? Because the widow (Morgana) died, so the next step is to pay to Harriet's living children.

But here's the catch: when was Grace born? 2001. So she was born after Walter created the trust in 1997. Does that affect anything? Hmm.

The options bring up the Rule against Perpetuities. I remember that the Rule says that any contingent interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time the interest was created. Otherwise, it's void.

So when was the interest created? The trust was created in 1997 when Walter died. The interest in question is Grace's right to the income after both Stan and his widow die.

Wait, Grace wasn't even born until 2001. So when the trust was created, she wasn't in existence yet. So does the Rule against Perpetuities apply here?

Let me think about the possible beneficiaries. The trust's income after Stan's widow's death is to go to Harriet's living children. At the time the trust was created (1997), Harriet's children could have been alive or not. But in this case, Harriet's only surviving child is Grace, born in 2001. So at the creation of the trust, Grace wasn't alive yet.

So the interest for Harriet's children is a contingent remainder. It's contingent on them being alive when the prior interests (Stan's life estate and the widow's interest) end.

Under the Rule against Perpetuities, we have to determine if the interest must vest within the perpetuity period. The measuring life would be someone alive at the creation of the trust. Let's see, who are the lives in being? Walter died in 1997, so perhaps Stan was alive then. So Stan is a life in being.

The interest here is that upon the death of Stan's widow, the income goes to Harriet's children. But the problem is that Harriet's children (like Grace) could be born after the trust's creation. So when the trust was created, Grace wasn't alive. So the possibility exists that Grace's interest vests outside the period.

Wait, the Rule against Perpetuities applies to contingent future interests. Grace's interest is contingent on her being alive when the income is to be distributed, which is after the death of Stan and his widow.

So let me break it down. The trust's structure is:

1. Income to Stan for life.
2. Upon Stan's death, income to Stan's widow (Morgana) for her life.
3. Upon Morgana's death, income to Harriet's living children.

But in this scenario, Stan and Morgana died at the same time. So after their deaths, the income should go to Harriet's living children. But Harriet's child, Grace, was born in 2001. So at the time of the trust's creation (1997), Grace wasn't alive.

So the question is whether Grace's interest is valid under the Rule against Perpetuities. Because Grace could have been born after the trust was created, and thus her interest might vest beyond the perpetuity period.

Wait, the Rule against Perpetuities looks at the possibility that the interest vests beyond 21 years after a life in being. So when the trust was created, the possible measuring lives would be people alive at that time. Let's see, Walter was dead, so the lives in being would be people like Stan, Harriet, etc.

The interest to Harriet's children is to take effect after the death of Stan and his widow. So the latest possible time for the interest to vest is after the death of the widow. But the widow could be Morgana, who was Stan's wife. So when the trust was created, Morgana was alive because Stan was married to her. So she was a life in being.

Wait, but Morgana's life is a life in being at the creation of the trust. So the interest to Harriet's children is contingent on surviving until after Morgana's death. But the problem is that Harriet's children, like Grace, could be born after the trust was made. So their interest is contingent on being alive when Morgana dies.

But wait, the Rule against Perpetuities requires that the interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years after a life in being. So if the interest vests upon Morgana's death, which is a life in being, then any children born to Harriet after the trust's creation would still be covered, right? Because their interest would vest at Morgana's death, which is within the perpetuity period (since Morgana is a life in being).

Wait, no. Because the interest is to the living children of Harriet at the time when the prior interests end. So, if the prior interests end when Morgana dies, then at that point, Harriet's children who are alive would take. But if Harriet has a child born after the trust was created, that child's interest would only vest when Morgana dies, which is within the perpetuity period because Morgana was a life in being.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The possible issue is that the interest might vest too remotely. But since the interest vests (if at all) upon the death of Morgana, who was alive when the trust was created, it's within the period. So Grace's interest, even though she was born after the trust, would vest upon Morgana's death, which is within the perpetuity period.

Wait, but what if Morgana had died, say, in 2020, and Grace was born in 2010? Then Grace's interest would vest in 2020, which is within 21 years after Morgana's death (but Morgana is the measuring life, so the 21 years would start at her death). Wait, no, the Rule against Perpetuities says that the interest must vest within 21 years after some life in being at the creation. So if the interest vests at Morgana's death, which is a life in being, then it's okay, regardless of when Grace was born.

So in this case, the interest to Harriet's children vests upon Morgana's death, which is a life in being. Therefore, it's within the Rule against Perpetuities. So Grace's interest is valid.

But wait, in this scenario, both Stan and Morgana died in 2009. So the income is supposed to go to Harriet's children upon Morgana's death. Since Morgana died, it should go to Harriet's living children, which is Grace. So Harriet brings the action to get the income for Grace.

Looking at the options, option B says yes because Grace is the only surviving child. Option C says yes because the deaths triggered the provision. Option A says no because of the Rule against Perpetuities.

Wait, but earlier I thought the Rule against Perpetuities wouldn't apply because the vesting happens at Morgana's death, a life in being. So Grace's interest is okay, so the answer would be yes. So options B, C, D, F, or G could be possible.

Option B says Grace is only surviving child, so she's entitled. That seems correct. The trust says to pay to the living children of Harriet in equal shares. Since Grace is the only child, she gets it all.

But wait, what about the timing? The trust only directs the income to Harriet's children after the death of Stan's widow. In this case, both Stan and Morgana died, so the widow's interest ended, so the next distribution is to Harriet's children.

So the correct answer should be that yes, Grace is entitled. So the options would be B, C, D, F, etc.

But let's look again. The Rule against Perpetuities might not be a problem because the interest vests at Morgana's death, who was a life in being. So option A is incorrect.

But wait, another angle: the class gift to Harriet's children. At the time the trust was created, the class was not yet closed. So any children born after would be included. But the Rule against Perpetuities requires that the interest must vest within the period. So if the class could include children born after, that could be a problem only if their interest might vest beyond the period.

Wait, but since the interest vests at the death of Morgana, a life in being, any child of Harriet alive at that time would take. So even if a child was born after the trust, as long as they are alive when Morgana dies, their interest vests. Since Morgana is a life in being, her death is within the period, so any such child's interest is valid.

So the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't prevent Grace from taking. Therefore, the answer is yes. So looking at the options, option B says yes because she is the only surviving child. So that would be correct.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option C says yes because the deaths in 2009 triggered the provision. That's also correct because upon Morgana's death, the income goes to Harriet's children.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let's see, the key issue is whether the interest violates the Rule against Perpetuities. The answer likely hinges on that.

If the trust's third provision (to Harriet's children) is valid, then Grace gets it. But if it's invalid under the Rule, then she doesn't.

So in this case, I think the trust's interest is valid because it vests upon Morgana's death, a life in being. So Grace's interest is okay. Therefore, the correct answer would be B, C, or another option that says yes.

Wait, option B says she's the only surviving child. That's a correct statement, but the real issue is whether the interest is valid under the Rule. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the question is whether Harriet will prevail. So the reason would be that Grace is the only child and the interest is valid. So the answer would be B.

Alternatively, option C says yes because the deaths triggered the provision. That's also correct, but the legal reason is the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't apply, so the interest is valid, and Grace is the only child.

Wait, but the options don't all give the same reason. So the correct reasoning is that the interest is valid, so the answer is yes. So looking at the options, option B is a reason why she's entitled, but the key legal issue is the Rule against Perpetuities, which option A brings up.

So if the answer is that the interest doesn't violate the Rule, then option A is incorrect. So the correct answer is that Harriet will prevail because the interest is valid, and Grace is the only child. So option B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest does violate the Rule against Perpetuities. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused now. Let me think again.

The interest given to Harriet's children is a contingent remainder. The contingency is that they survive until after the death of Stan's widow.

At the creation of the trust in 1997, the possible beneficiaries (Harriet's children) could include after-born children, like Grace, born in 2001. The Rule against Perpetuities looks at whether any possible scenario could cause the interest to vest beyond the period.

So, could it be possible that Harriet has a child born after 1997, and that child's interest vests more than 21 years after the death of all lives in being at the creation?

Wait, the lives in being would include Stan and Morgana, as they were alive in 1997. So the interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years after the death of the last survivor of Stan and Morgana.

So if, for example, Morgana dies in 2009, then the interest vests in 2009. Any child of Harriet alive in 2009 would take. Since Grace was born in 2001, she was alive in 2009. So her interest vests at Morgana's death, which is within the period.

But what if Harriet had a child born in, say, 2030, and Morgana died in 2009, that child wouldn't be born yet. Wait, no, because the interest would vest at Morgana's death in 2009. So any child born after that wouldn't be alive yet, so they wouldn't take. Wait, no, the child has to be alive at the time of vesting. So if a child is born after 2009, they couldn't be alive when the interest vests in 2009. So only children born before 2009 could possibly take.

Wait, but the Rule against Perpetuities isn't concerned with whether a child is born after the trust; it's concerned with whether the interest could vest beyond the period. Since the interest vests at Morgana's death, which is a life in being, any children of Harriet alive at that time would take. So the interest is certain to vest or fail by Morgana's death plus 21 years, but actually, it vests at her death, so it's within the period.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The Rule against Perpetuities says that the interest must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time the interest was created. So in this case, the interest is to vest upon the death of Morgana, who was a life in being. So the vesting occurs at her death, which is within the perpetuity period. Therefore, the interest is valid, and Grace can take.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, and the reason is that the Rule against Perpetuities is satisfied because the interest vests upon Morgana's death, a life in being. So looking at the options, option B says yes because Grace is the only surviving child. But I'm not sure if the option addresses the Rule against Perpetuities issue.

Wait, option A says no because the provisions violate the Rule. But if the Rule isn't violated, then A is incorrect. So the correct answer would be that Harriet prevails, so the answer is B, C, D, etc.

But let's look again. The only possible issue is the Rule against Perpetuities. Since the interest vests at Morgana's death, which is a life in being, the Rule is satisfied. So the trust's third provision is valid. Therefore, upon Morgana's death in 2009, the income is to be paid to Harriet's living children, which is Grace. So Harriet can collect for Grace.

So the correct answer is B: Yes, because Grace is the only surviving child. Alternatively, option C says yes because the deaths triggered the provision. But the key legal point is that the interest doesn't violate the Rule against Perpetuities, making option A incorrect.

Wait, but the question says there's no statute modifying the common law, so the Rule is in full effect. So the answer is yes, and the reason is that the interest is valid under the Rule because it vests upon Morgana's death, a life in being. So Grace can take.

So among the options, option B is correct, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option C is about the trigger, which is correct, but the main legal issue is the Rule against Perpetuities. So if the answer hinges on that, then the correct choice would be that the Rule doesn't apply, making option A incorrect.

Wait, but let me think again. The trust says that upon Stan's death, income goes to his widow. Then upon her death, to Harriet's children. So the interest of Harriet's children is a contingent remainder subject to the prior estates.

At the creation of the trust, the only possible measuring lives would be Stan and Morgana. The interest to Harriet's children must vest, if at all, at the death of Morgana. Since Morgana is a life in being, the interest vests at her death, which is within the perpetuity period. Therefore, the interest is valid.

So the answer is yes, Harriet will prevail. So the correct option is B or C.

But looking at the options, option B is about Grace being the only child, which is a fact, but the legal reason is the Rule against Perpetuities. So if the question's answer is based on the Rule, then option A is incorrect, and the correct answer is yes.

So in conclusion, the correct answer is B, but I'm a bit torn because the key legal issue is the Rule against Perpetuities, but the option doesn't explicitly mention it. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that the Rule isn't violated, so the answer is yes, making option B correct.

The question revolves around the distribution of trust income created by Walter in 1997. The trust provides income to Stan for life, then to Stan's widow, and finally to Harriet's living children upon the widow's death. Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001, and both Stan and his widow, Morgana, died in 2009. The legal issue is whether Grace is entitled to the income and whether the trust's provisions violate the Rule against Perpetuities.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Trust Structure and Beneficiaries**:
   - The trust income is to be paid to Stan for life, then to his widow (Morgana) for her life, and finally to Harriet's living children upon Morgana's death.
   - Grace, born in 2001, is Harriet's only surviving child and would be the sole beneficiary of the trust income after Morgana's death.

2. **Rule against Perpetuities**:
   - The Rule against Perpetuities requires that any contingent interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years after the death of a life
