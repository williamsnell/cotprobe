Okay, so I've got this problem here about hiking boots and calculating the manufacturer's increase over the cost. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that a pair of hiking boots costs $25 to produce. The company, Sure-grip Shoe Co., wants to sell them for 15% more than the production cost. I need to find out what the manufacturer's increase is over the cost. 

Hmm, so the cost is $25. They're adding 15% on top of that. I think I need to calculate 15% of $25 because that's the increase they want. 

Wait, percentage calculations can sometimes trip me up, but I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you multiply the percentage (in decimal form) by that number. So 15% as a decimal is 0.15. 

So let me do that math. 0.15 multiplied by $25. Let's see, 0.15 times 25. Well, 0.1 times 25 is 2.5, and 0.05 times 25 is 1.25. So adding those together, 2.5 + 1.25 equals 3.75. 

So the increase is $3.75. Now looking at the options, option J is $3.75. That should be the correct answer. 

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check. 15% of 25 is indeed 3.75. Yep, that makes sense. So the selling price would be 25 + 3.75 = 28.75, but the question specifically asks for the increase, which is 3.75. 

So yeah, option J is the right choice.

The problem involves calculating the manufacturer's increase over the production cost of hiking boots. The production cost is $25, and the selling price is set at 15% above the production cost. To find the increase, we calculate 15% of $25:

\[
\text{Increase} = 0.15 \times 25 = 3.75
\]

The manufacturer's increase over the cost is $3.75. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

J: $3.75

Answer: J
