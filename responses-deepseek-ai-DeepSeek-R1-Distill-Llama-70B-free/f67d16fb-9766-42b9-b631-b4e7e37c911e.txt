Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Path-Goal Theory of Leadership. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Path-Goal Theory was developed by Robert House, right? It's about how leaders can motivate their subordinates by helping them achieve their goals.

The question is asking about the Instrumental leadership style. Wait, I think the Path-Goal Theory has different types of leader behaviors. Let me recall. There's directive leadership, supportive leadership, participative leadership, and achievement-oriented leadership. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing terms here.

So, the question says that subordinate satisfaction and motivation are maximized when they believe the leader is helping. The Path-Goal Theory suggests that leaders should help subordinates by clarifying the paths to their goals, removing obstacles, and providing support.

Now, the Instrumental leadership style—I think that's another term for directive leadership. Directive leaders set clear expectations, provide specific instructions, and make decisions for their subordinates. They focus on the tasks and the goals, ensuring that everyone knows what's expected of them.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches the Instrumental style. Let's go through each option:

A: Creating a positive work environment – that sounds more like supportive leadership, which focuses on being friendly and approachable.

B: Including subordinates in decision-making – that's participative leadership, where the leader involves the team in decisions.

C: Providing feedback and recognition – this could be part of several styles, maybe supportive or achievement-oriented, which focuses on encouraging high performance.

D: Encouraging independent work – that might be more of a delegative style, but I'm not sure if that's part of the Path-Goal Theory.

E: Setting challenging goals and encouraging higher performance – that sounds like achievement-oriented leadership, which is about pushing for excellence.

F: Establishing supportive relationships – again, that's supportive leadership.

G: Emphasizing team building – maybe more of a transformational leadership aspect, but not sure.

H: Valuing employee engagement – perhaps related to supportive or participative styles.

I: Encouraging subordinates to set their own goals – again, possibly achievement-oriented.

J: Providing specific guidelines and clear rules – this seems like directive leadership, which is the same as instrumental. So this would be the correct answer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the terms can blend. But I think instrumental leadership is about providing clear instructions and structure, which matches option J.

The Path-Goal Theory, developed by Robert House, suggests that leaders can enhance subordinate motivation by clarifying paths to goal achievement and providing necessary support. The Instrumental leadership style, synonymous with directive leadership, focuses on setting clear expectations, providing specific instructions, and ensuring subordinates understand their tasks and goals. 

Among the options, option J aligns with this style as it emphasizes providing specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures.

Answer: J
