Question:

What are the implications of the Hardy-Weinberg Law?

Options:

A: The Hardy-Weinberg Law only applies to small, isolated populations
B: The Hardy-Weinberg Law assumes that mating is non-random and typically assortative based on genotype.
C: The Hardy-Weinberg Law predicts that all alleles will eventually reach an equal frequency in a stable population.
D: The Hardy-Weinberg Law indicates that natural selection cannot occur in real populations.
E: The Hardy-Weinberg Law suggests that mutation rates are the primary driver of evolution in large populations.
F: The Hardy-Weinberg Law implies that genetic drift has a negligible effect on allele frequencies.
G: The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that gene frequencies change from generation to generation
H: The Hardy-Weinberg Law applies strictly to populations with a high rate of gene flow and migration.
I: The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that in a population at equilibrium, both gene and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation.
J: The Hardy-Weinberg Law predicts the extinction of recessive genes over time

Okay, so I have this question about the Hardy-Weinberg Law and its implications. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Hardy-Weinberg Law is a model that describes how genetic variation will remain stable in a population over time under certain conditions. It's used in population genetics, right? So the law makes several assumptions to hold true. Let me try to recall those assumptions.

The law assumes a few things: no mutation, random mating, large population size (so genetic drift is negligible), no gene flow (migration), and no natural selection. If all these conditions are met, the allele and genotype frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next.

Now, the question is about the implications of the Hardy-Weinberg Law. So what does it imply? Well, if all the conditions are met, then the frequencies don't change. That means the population is in genetic equilibrium. So the law states that under these specific conditions, both gene and genotype frequencies remain constant.

Looking at the options:

Option I says, "The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that in a population at equilibrium, both gene and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation." That sounds exactly right based on what I remember. So I would think option I is correct.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing anything up.

Option A: The law applies only to small, isolated populations. No, that's wrong. The law assumes a large population to avoid genetic drift, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Assumes non-random mating and assortative. No, the law requires random mating, so B is wrong.

Option C: Predicts all alleles reach equal frequency. Hmm, no. The law doesn't make them equal; it just keeps frequencies stable. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Indicates no natural selection. Wait, the law assumes no selection, but in reality, selection can still happen. The law just shows what happens when it doesn't. So D is incorrect because it says selection cannot occur, which is too absolute.

Option E: Mutation rates drive evolution. No, the law assumes no mutation, so E is wrong.

Option F: Genetic drift has negligible effect. Well, the law assumes a large population, so drift is negligible. But is that an implication of the law itself? The law's model shows that under these conditions, frequencies are stable. So F says it implies drift has negligible effect. But wait, the implication is that without other factors, allele frequencies remain stable. I'm not sure if F is correct or not. Let me think again.

Option G: Gene frequencies change. No, the law says they remain the same if all conditions are met, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Applies to populations with high gene flow. No, the law assumes no migration, so H is wrong.

Option J: Predicts extinction of recessive genes. No, that's not right. In H-W equilibrium, recessive alleles can persist, especially in heterozygotes. So J is incorrect.

So, going back, the correct answer seems to be I. It correctly states that in a population at equilibrium, both gene and genotype frequencies remain constant.

The Hardy-Weinberg Law describes a model of genetic equilibrium, where allele and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation under specific conditions: no mutation, random mating, a large population size (negligible genetic drift), no gene flow, and no natural selection. Among the options provided:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the law applies to large populations, not small ones.  
- **Option B** is incorrect because the law assumes random mating, not assortative mating.  
- **Option C** is incorrect because the law does not predict equal allele frequencies, only stability.  
- **Option D** is incorrect because the law assumes no natural selection but does not preclude its occurrence in real populations.  
- **Option E** is incorrect because the law assumes no mutation, not that mutation drives evolution.  
- **Option F** is incorrect because, while the law assumes negligible genetic drift due to large population size, this is not its primary implication.  
- **Option G** is incorrect because the law states that gene frequencies remain constant, not that they change.  
- **Option H** is incorrect because the law assumes no gene flow, not high gene flow.  
- **Option J** is incorrect because the law does not predict the extinction of recessive genes; they can persist in heterozygotes.  

The correct answer is **Option I**, as it accurately states that in a population at equilibrium, both gene and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation.
