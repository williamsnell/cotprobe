Okay, so I've got this problem about artificial seawater, and I'm supposed to find the chlorinity and salinity. Hmm, I remember that chlorinity and salinity are related but not the same. Let me think through this step by step.

The recipe gives the amounts of various salts in grams per kilogram of solution. So each salt is added to 1000g of water, making the total solution 1000g plus the salts? Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. The way the question is phrased, it's all the salts together dissolved in water to make 1000g total. So the total mass of the solution is 1000g. So the sum of all the salts plus the water equals 1000g.

Wait, but the way it's written, the salts are per 1000g (kg) of solution. So for example, NaCl is 26.518 grams per kg solution, meaning in 1000g solution, you have 26.518g NaCl. Same for the others. So the sum of all these salts will give the total mass of dissolved solids, and the rest is water.

So first, let me calculate the total mass of all the salts. Let me add them up:

NaCl: 26.518 g
MgCl2: 2.447 g
MgSO4: 3.305 g
CaCl2: 1.141 g
KCl: 0.725 g
NaHCO3: 0.202 g
NaBr: 0.083 g

Adding these:

26.518 + 2.447 = 28.965
28.965 + 3.305 = 32.27
32.27 + 1.141 = 33.411
33.411 + 0.725 = 34.136
34.136 + 0.202 = 34.338
34.338 + 0.083 = 34.421 g total salts.

So the total mass of salts is 34.421 grams in 1000g solution. Salinity is the total mass of dissolved salts per 1000g of seawater, so that would be 34.421 g/kg, which is 3.4421%. So looking at the options, the salinity is around 3.4% or similar.

Wait, but I thought sometimes salinity is expressed in parts per thousand, which is grams per kilogram. So that's 34.421 g/kg, which is 34.421‰, which is 3.4421% when expressed as a percentage (since 1‰ is 0.1%).

Now, chlorinity is a bit different. Chlorinity is the mass of chlorine ions in seawater, but traditionally, it's calculated based on the chloride ion concentration. Oh wait, but wait, chlorinity is defined as the mass of chlorine (as Cl-) per 1000g of seawater. But sometimes, it's calculated from the amount of Cl- in all the salts, but wait, in the past, chlorinity was determined by titrating chloride ions, but since some salts contribute Cl- more than others, I need to calculate the total Cl- from each salt.

Alternatively, I think there's a formula that relates chlorinity to salinity, but maybe that's when you don't have all the individual components. Since here, I know all the salts, I can calculate the exact Cl- contribution.

So each salt contributes Cl- in various amounts. Let's calculate how much Cl- each salt contributes.

Let me go through each salt:

1. NaCl: formula weight NaCl is 58.44 g/mol. Each NaCl gives one Cl- ion. So moles of NaCl = 26.518 g / 58.44 g/mol ≈ 0.4536 mol. So Cl- from NaCl is 0.4536 mol.

But wait, wait, for the purpose of calculating chlorinity, it's the mass of Cl- in grams. So molar mass of Cl is about 35.45 g/mol. So mass of Cl- from NaCl is 0.4536 mol * 35.45 g/mol ≈ 16.07 g.

2. MgCl2: formula weight is 95.21 g/mol (Mg is ~24.305, Cl2 is ~70.9). Each MgCl2 gives 2 Cl- ions. So moles of MgCl2 = 2.447 g / 95.21 ≈ 0.02571 mol. So Cl- is 2 * 0.02571 = 0.05142 mol. Mass is 0.05142 * 35.45 ≈ 1.824 g.

3. MgSO4: SO4^2-, doesn't contribute Cl, so no Cl here.

4. CaCl2: formula weight is 110.98 g/mol (Ca ~40.078, Cl2 ~70.9). Each CaCl2 gives 2 Cl-. Moles of CaCl2 = 1.141 g / 110.98 ≈ 0.01028 mol. Cl- is 2 * 0.01028 = 0.02056 mol. Mass is 0.02056 * 35.45 ≈ 0.729 g.

5. KCl: formula weight 74.55 g/mol (K ~39.1, Cl ~35.45). Each KCl gives 1 Cl-. Moles of KCl = 0.725 g /74.55 ≈ 0.00972 mol. Cl- mass: 0.00972 *35.45 ≈ 0.345 g.

6. NaHCO3: doesn't contribute Cl-.

7. NaBr: Br- is a halogen, but chlorinity is only about Cl-.

So now, sum all the Cl- contributions:

NaCl: ~16.07g
MgCl2: ~1.824g
CaCl2: ~0.729g
KCl: ~0.345g

Adding these together: 16.07 + 1.824 = 17.894; 17.894 + 0.729 = 18.623; 18.623 + 0.345 = 18.968 g.

So total Cl- is approximately 18.968 grams in 1000 grams of solution. So chlorinity is 18.968 grams per 1000 grams, which is 1.8968% chlorinity.

Wait, but wait, the options have chlorinity as 1.7, 1.8, etc. So 1.8968% would be about 1.9%, right? Let me see:

18.968 g/kg is 18.968‰, which is 1.8968% as chlorinity.

So chlorinity is approximately 1.9%, and salinity was 3.4421%, which rounds to 3.44% or so.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 1.9% chlorinity, 3.433% salinity. That's very close. Wait, our salinity was 34.421%, which is 34.421‰. 34.421 grams per kg is 3.4421% as a percentage.

But let me double-check the salinity calculation. The total mass of salts is 34.421g. So 34.421g/1000g solution = 3.4421% salinity. So option E has 3.433%, which is a bit lower than our calculation. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in adding up the salts?

Wait, let me re-add the salts:

NaCl: 26.518

MgCl2: 2.447 → so 26.518 + 2.447 = 28.965

Plus MgSO4: 3.305 → 28.965 +3.305 =32.27

Plus CaCl2:1.141 → 32.27 +1.141=33.411

Plus KCl:0.725 →33.411+0.725=34.136

Plus NaHCO3:0.202 →34.136 +0.202=34.338

Plus NaBr:0.083 → 34.338 +0.083=34.421g. So that's correct.

So salinity is 34.421 g/kg → 3.4421% as a percentage.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.433% salinity. That's very close, but a bit off. Let me check if I miscalculated something. Alternatively, perhaps in the problem statement, the sum is correct, but maybe I should recount.

Wait, maybe the order of the salts? Let me check the given data again:

NaCl: 26.518 g/kg

MgCl2: 2.447

MgSO4:3.305

CaCl2:1.141

KCl:0.725

NaHCO3:0.202

NaBr:0.083

Yes, that's correct. So 26.518+2.447 is 28.965.

But wait, wait, perhaps the problem says 'all of these salts are dissolved in water to make a total weight of 1000g'. So perhaps 'make up to 1000g solution', but in that case, the sum of the salts plus the water is 1000g. But the way the problem is written, the salts are added per 1000g of solution. So perhaps the salts are in 1000g of solution, meaning the water is 1000g minus the total salts. Wait, that complicates things. Wait, no, because the problem says "all of these salts are dissolved in water to make a total weight of 1000 g." So the solution is 1000g total, which is the sum of the salts and the water. So in that case, the mass of the salts is the sum of all the given grams, 34.421g, and the mass of water is 1000 - 34.421 = 965.579g.

But when calculating salinity, it's the mass of salts per 1000g solution. So 34.421g /1000g solution = 3.4421% salinity. So that part is correct.

Wait, so perhaps some of the options round to 3.4%, but looking at the options, option E is 3.433%, which is about 3.43%, which is very close to 3.44% when rounded to three decimal places. So perhaps it's a calculation error, or perhaps I need to double-check the Cl- calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the Cl- more accurately.

Let me recalculate each Cl contribution with more precise numbers.

1. NaCl: 26.518g.

Molar mass NaCl = 58.443 g/mol.

Moles NaCl = 26.518 / 58.443 ≈ 0.4536 moles.

Cl- per mole: 1 per NaCl.

Mass Cl- = 0.4536 * 35.453 g/mol = let's compute that.

35.453 * 0.4536 = ?

35 * 0.4536 = 15.876

0.453 * 0.4536 = wait, perhaps better to compute 35.453 * 0.4536.

Compute 35.453 * 0.4536.

35 * 0.4536 = 15.876

0.453 * 0.4536: 0.453 * 0.4 is 0.1812, 0.453 *0.05=0.02265, 0.453*0.0036=0.0016328 → total approx 0.2054928.

Wait, alternatively, just compute 35.453 * 0.4536.

Compute 35.453 * 0.4 = 14.1812

35.453 *0.05=1.77265

35.453 *0.0036=0.127629

Adding:14.1812 +1.77265=15.95385 +0.127629=16.081479 → approximately 16.0815g.

2. MgCl2: 2.447g.

Molar mass MgCl2 = 24.305 + 2*35.453 = 24.305 +70.906=95.211 g/mol.

Moles MgCl2 = 2.447 /95.211 ≈ 0.02571 moles.

Cl- ions per mole: 2.

Cl- mass: 0.02571 * 2 *35.453 = 0.05142 *35.453 ≈ let's compute.

0.05 *35.453 =1.77265

0.00142 *35.453≈0.0503.

So total ≈1.77265 +0.0503=1.82295g.

3. CaCl2:1.141g.

Molar mass CaCl2 =40.078 + 2*35.453=40.078 +70.906=110.984 g/mol.

Moles CaCl2=1.141/110.984≈0.01028 moles.

Cl- per mole:2.

Mass Cl-: 0.01028 *2 *35.453=0.02056 *35.453.

Compute 0.02 *35.453=0.70906.

0.00056*35.453≈0.01985.

Total ≈0.70906 +0.01985=0.72891g.

4. KCl:0.725g.

Molar mass KCl=39.10 +35.453=74.553 g/mol.

Moles KCl=0.725/74.553≈0.009721 moles.

Cl- per mole:1.

Mass Cl-:0.009721 *35.453≈0.3445g.

Adding all Cl- masses:

NaCl: ~16.0815g

MgCl2: ~1.82295g

CaCl2: ~0.72891g

KCl: ~0.3445g

Total Cl-:16.0815 +1.82295 =17.90445 → +0.72891=18.63336 → +0.3445=18.97786g.

So approximately 18.978g Cl- in 1000g solution. So chlorinity is 18.978g/kg → 1.8978% chlorinity, which is approximately 1.9%.

So chlorinity is about 1.9%, salinity 3.44%.

Looking back at the options, option E is 1.9% chlorinity, 3.433% salinity. That's very close. The slight difference in salinity could be due to rounding during intermediate steps, or perhaps I miscalculated something.

Wait, let me check the sum of all salts again.

26.518 +2.447=28.965

+3.305=32.27 → +1.141=33.411 → +0.725=34.136 → +0.202=34.338 → +0.083=34.421g.

Yes, so 34.421g salts in 1000g solution → 3.4421% salinity.

Option E: 3.433% is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects rounding to three significant figures. 34.421 is 34.4 when rounded to three sig figs, so 3.44%. But the option E is 3.433%, which is about 3.43%. Maybe the problem rounds differently, but it's close.

Looking at the options, option E is the closest to our calculated values. So I think the correct answer is E: 1.9% chlorinity, 3.433% salinity.

To determine the chlorinity and salinity of the artificial seawater, the following steps were taken:

### Salinity Calculation
Salinity is defined as the total mass of dissolved salts in grams per kilogram of solution, expressed as a percentage. The recipe provides the masses of the salts in grams per kilogram of solution:

- **NaCl**: 26.518 g  
- **MgCl₂**: 2.447 g  
- **MgSO₄**: 3.305 g  
- **CaCl₂**: 1.141 g  
- **KCl**: 0.725 g  
- **NaHCO₃**: 0.202 g  
- **NaBr**: 0.083 g  

The total mass of the salts is calculated as:  
\[
26.518 + 2.447 + 3.305 + 1.141 + 0.725 + 0.202 + 0.083 = 34.421 \, \text{g}
\]

Since the total solution mass is 1000 g, the salinity is:  
\[
\text{Salinity} = \frac{34.421}{1000} \times 100 = 3.4421\% \, \text{(rounded to 3.44%)}.
\]

### Chlorinity Calculation
Chlorinity is the mass of chlorine ions (Cl⁻) in grams per kilogram of solution, expressed as a percentage. The contribution of Cl⁻ from each salt is calculated based on its molar mass and the number of Cl⁻ ions per formula unit:

1. **NaCl**:  
   - Molar mass = 58.443 g/mol  
   - Moles of NaCl = \(\frac{26.518}{58.443} \approx 0.4536 \, \text{mol}\)  
   - Cl⁻ mass = \(0.4536 \times 35.453 \approx 16.0815 \, \text{g}\)

2. **MgCl₂**:  
   - Molar mass = 95.211 g/mol  
   - Moles of MgCl₂ = \(\frac{2.447}{95.211} \approx 0.02571 \, \text{mol}\)  
   - Cl⁻ mass = \(0.02571 \times 2 \times 35.453 \approx 1.82295 \, \text{g}\)

3. **CaCl₂**:  
   - Molar mass = 110.984 g/mol  
   - Moles of CaCl₂ = \(\frac{1.141}{110.984} \approx 0.01028 \, \text{mol}\)  
   - Cl⁻ mass = \(0.01028 \times 2 \times 35.453 \approx 0.72891 \, \text{g}\)

4. **KCl**:  
   - Molar mass = 74.553 g/mol  
   - Moles of KCl = \(\frac{0.725}{74.553} \approx 0.009721 \, \text{mol}\)  
   - Cl⁻ mass = \(0
