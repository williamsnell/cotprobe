The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

At a defendant's trial for burglary, the defendant has called a witness who has testified without objection that the defendant said shortly after his arrest, "They've got the wrong person for this, because I have an alibi." The prosecutor seeks to cross- examine the witness about why she did not mention that statement when the police asked her whether the defendant had said anything to her about having an alibi. Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?

Options:

A: Yes, as a way to establish the witness's relationship with the defendant.
B: No, because the prosecutor cannot introduce evidence that contradicts the defendant's statement.
C: Yes, as a method to challenge the witness's credibility.
D: No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is not relevant.
E: Yes, as a way to question the witness's memory.
F: No, because the prosecutor cannot cross-examine the defendant's witness.
G: Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.
H: No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.
I: Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.
J: No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination in a criminal trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a burglary trial. The defendant has called a witness who testified that the defendant said, after his arrest, "They've got the wrong person for this, because I have an alibi." The prosecutor wants to cross-examine the witness about why she didn't mention that statement when the police asked her if the defendant had said anything about an alibi.

Hmm, so the issue here is about the propriety of the prosecutor's cross-examination. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I need to recall the rules of evidence regarding cross-examination, particularly impeachment. I remember that witnesses can be impeached for prior inconsistent statements. Also, the credibility of a witness is a key aspect of cross-examination.

In this case, the witness testified about the defendant's statement. The prosecutor wants to ask why she didn't mention it to the police. So, the prosecutor is trying to show that the witness's current testimony is inconsistent with her prior statement (or lack thereof) to the police.

Wait, but wait. The prior statement to the police would be relevant if it's inconsistent. However, the question is about whether the failure to mention it can be used for impeachment. I think that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior inconsistent statement can be used to impeach a witness's credibility if it's material.

So, the witness's testimony now is that the defendant made a statement. But she didn't mention it to the police before. That inconsistency could be used to challenge her credibility. Because if she didn't tell the police about it earlier, maybe she's making it up now, or maybe her memory is faulty.

Looking at the options, option C says it's a method to challenge credibility. Option G says it's impeachment for prior inconsistency. Option E is about questioning memory.

Wait, prior inconsistent statements are a specific way to impeach. So, the prosecutor can ask about the prior statement to show inconsistency. But there's a rule about extrinsic evidence, right? Like, you can't bring in extrinsic evidence to prove a prior inconsistent statement unless it's for impeachment and certain conditions are met.

Wait, no, during cross-examination, you can ask the witness about prior inconsistent statements without introducing extrinsic evidence. So, the prosecutor can ask the witness, "Didn't you tell the police you didn't hear the defendant say anything about an alibi?" to impeach her credibility.

So, the question is about whether this line of questioning is proper. The correct reason would be that it's impeachment for prior inconsistency, which is option G.

Wait, but another point: whether the prior statement is material. The defendant's alibi is certainly material because it goes to the heart of his defense. So, the inconsistency would matter.

So, the prosecutor's cross-examination is proper because she's trying to impeach the witness's credibility by showing a prior inconsistent statement. So the answer should be option C or G.

Wait, option C says it's a method to challenge credibility. Option G says it's impeachment for prior inconsistency, which is a specific method. So, both C and G are somewhat correct, but which one is the better answer.

I think the more precise answer would be G, because prior inconsistent statements are a specific ground for impeachment. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes, the rules allow for cross-examination on prior inconsistent statements without needing extrinsic evidence. So, yes, the prosecutor can ask about it to impeach.

Looking at the options again. Option C is a broader categoryâ€”challenging credibility. G is more specific.

Alternatively, another angle: the witness's failure to mention the statement could be considered a prior inconsistent statement if the context is such that she should have mentioned it if it were true.

So, the prosecutor's cross-examination is proper as impeachment for prior inconsistency. So, the answer should be G.

Wait, but another thought: the witness didn't make a statement inconsistent with her current testimony. She didn't say anything to the police, which could mean she omitted it. So, the question is whether her silence can be used as a prior inconsistent statement.

I think that under the law, a prior inconsistent statement can include the omission of a statement when it would have been natural to make it. So, the witness was asked by the police if the defendant said anything about an alibi, and she didn't mention it then. Now she's testifying about it. So, that's an inconsistency because her prior statement (by omission) is inconsistent with her current testimony.

Therefore, the prosecutor can impeach her on that basis.

So, the answer is G: Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.

The question revolves around whether the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination of the witness is proper. The witness testified that the defendant made a statement about having an alibi, but she did not mention this statement when questioned by the police. The prosecutor seeks to cross-examine her about this omission.

Under the rules of evidence, witnesses can be impeached for prior inconsistent statements. A prior inconsistent statement includes not only affirmative statements but also omissions when it would have been natural to disclose the information. Here, the witness's failure to mention the defendant's alibi statement to the police, despite being asked about it, constitutes a prior inconsistent statement. This inconsistency can be used to challenge the witness's credibility.

The prosecutor's cross-examination is proper because it aims to impeach the witness's credibility by highlighting this inconsistency. This falls under the specific category of impeachment for prior inconsistency, making option G the most precise answer.

**Answer: G**
