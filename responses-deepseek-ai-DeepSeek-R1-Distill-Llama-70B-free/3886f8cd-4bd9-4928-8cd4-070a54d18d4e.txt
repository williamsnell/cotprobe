Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the marginal propensity to consume and how it affects GDP. Hmm, I remember that the MPC is the fraction of additional income that a household consumes rather than saves. So if the MPC is 0.8, that means for every extra dollar people earn, they spend 80 cents and save 20 cents.

The question is asking about the largest total increase in GDP from $500 of new spending. I think this relates to the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect is when an initial increase in spending leads to a larger increase in GDP because the money gets spent and respent in the economy.

Wait, how does the multiplier formula work again? Oh right, the formula is 1/(1 - MPC). So the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 minus the MPC). Let me plug in the numbers here. The MPC is 0.8, so 1 - 0.8 equals 0.2. Then 1 divided by 0.2 is 5. So the multiplier is 5.

But wait, the initial spending is $500. So to find the total increase in GDP, I multiply the initial amount by the multiplier. That would be $500 * 5 = $2,500. So the total increase is $2,500.

Looking back at the options, option A is $2,500. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes I get confused between the government spending multiplier and the tax multiplier. The government spending multiplier is indeed 1/(1 - MPC), which in this case gives 5. So yes, $500 times 5 is correct. So the largest total increase is A.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8, meaning that for every additional dollar earned, $0.80 is spent and $0.20 is saved. To determine the largest total increase in GDP resulting from $500 of new spending, we use the multiplier effect formula:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}}
\]

Substituting the given MPC:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \frac{1}{0.2} = 5
\]

The total increase in GDP is then calculated by multiplying the initial spending by the multiplier:

\[
\text{Total Increase in GDP} = \$500 \times 5 = \$2,500
\]

Thus, the largest total increase in GDP is **$2,500**, corresponding to option A.
