Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to gas laws, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a sealed glass bulb containing helium. The initial conditions are a pressure of 750 mm Hg at 27°C. Then, the bulb is packed in dry ice at -73°C. I need to find the resultant pressure of the helium. The options are from A to J, each with different pressures.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with gases, especially in sealed containers, the combined gas law might apply here. The combined gas law is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2, right? But wait, since the bulb is sealed, the volume of the gas doesn't change. So maybe I can simplify this.

Oh wait, if the volume is constant, then the equation simplifies to P1/T1 = P2/T2. That makes sense because, with V being the same, it cancels out. So I can use this proportion to find the new pressure.

But wait, temperatures in gas laws must be in Kelvin. Oh right, I forgot that part. So I need to convert both temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.

The initial temperature is 27°C. To convert to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 27 + 273 = 300 K, approximately. Okay, got that.

The final temperature is -73°C. Let me convert that too. So -73 + 273 is 200 K. Right, 200 K.

So initial pressure P1 is 750 mm Hg. Initial temp T1 is 300 K, final temp T2 is 200 K. We're looking for P2.

Using the formula P1/T1 = P2/T2, I can rearrange it to P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1).

Wait, no. Wait, if the volume is constant, then P is directly proportional to T. So when temperature decreases, pressure should decrease as well, right? Since we're cooling the gas, the pressure should go down.

Wait, but the formula is P1/T1 = P2/T2. So solving for P2: P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1). Let me plug in the numbers.

P1 is 750 mm Hg. T1 is 300 K, T2 is 200 K.

So P2 = 750 * (200 / 300) = 750 * (2/3) = 500 mm Hg.

Wait, that's 500 mm Hg. Looking at the options, option D is 500 mm Hg. So that should be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check. If the temperature is dropping from 300K to 200K, that's a decrease. So pressure should decrease. 750 to 500 is a decrease, so that makes sense.

Alternatively, I could think about the ratio. The temperature ratio is T2/T1 = 200/300 = 2/3. So the new pressure is 2/3 of the initial pressure. 750 * (2/3) is 500. Yep, that's consistent.

I don't see any other factors here. The bulb is sealed, so the number of moles doesn't change. Helium is a noble gas and is monoatomic, but that doesn't affect the ideal gas law here. So I think the calculation holds.

To solve the problem, we use the gas law relationship for a sealed container where the volume remains constant. In such cases, the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to its temperature in Kelvin. The relevant formula is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 27^\circ \text{C} = 27 + 273 = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = -73^\circ \text{C} = -73 + 273 = 200 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Solve for the final pressure \( P_2 \)
Rearranging the formula:

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
P_2 = 750 \, \text{mm Hg} \cdot \frac{200 \, \text{K}}{300 \, \text{K}} = 750 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 500 \, \text{mm Hg}
\]

### Step 3: Verify the result
The temperature decreases from 300 K to 200 K, so the pressure should also decrease proportionally. The calculation confirms that the final pressure is \( 500 \, \text{mm Hg} \), which matches option D.
