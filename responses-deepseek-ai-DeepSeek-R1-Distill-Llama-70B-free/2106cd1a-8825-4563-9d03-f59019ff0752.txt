Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical, which is (CH3)3C•. Hmm, I remember that EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectroscopy is used to study species with unpaired electrons, like free radicals. The t-Bu radical is a tri-substituted carbon-centered radical, right?

The question is asking about the ratio of line intensities in its EPR spectrum. I think the line intensities depend on the hyperfine splitting caused by neighboring nuclei. Since the t-Bu radical has three equivalent methyl groups attached to the central carbon, each methyl has three protons. But wait, how does that affect the hyperfine structure?

Wait, the t-Bu radical has a structure where the unpaired electron is on the central carbon, and each of the three methyl groups is attached to this carbon. So each methyl group has three equivalent protons. But in terms of hyperfine splitting, the equivalent nuclei will contribute to the splitting pattern.

I remember that when you have equivalent nuclei, the number of possible combinations for their spin states determines the number of lines. For n equivalent nuclei with spin I, the number of lines is n + 1 if all have the same coupling. But wait, in this case, each methyl group is a CH3, so each methyl has three protons. But the central carbon is attached to three CH3 groups. So the total number of equivalent protons is 3 groups × 3 protons each = 9 protons? Or wait, no, because each CH3 is a separate group, but are their protons equivalent?

Wait no, the coupling in such radicals... I think in the t-Bu radical, the unpaired electron is on the central carbon, and each of the three methyl groups is attached to it. Each methyl group's protons are equivalent among themselves, but are all the protons from all three groups equivalent to each other? Hmm. Because the three methyl groups are all attached to the same central carbon and are equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule, so all nine protons are equivalent. So in that case, the hyperfine interaction would be with nine equivalent protons.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting a bit confused. The t-Bu radical is (CH3)3C•. So the central carbon has three CH3 groups. Each of these CH3 groups has three protons. Are all nine protons equivalent? Because the molecule is symmetrical, yes, I think so. So the spin system is all nine protons are equivalent.

In EPR, when you have a spin system with n equivalent nuclei each with spin I=1/2, the number of lines observed is n + 1, but wait, no, that's for each nucleus. But for multiple nuclei, it's a bit different.

Wait, no, for n equivalent nuclei, each with spin I, the multiplicity is (n * (2I) + 1). Wait, no, that's for identical nuclei. Let me think again. For one proton, you have two lines (splitting into a doublet). For two equivalent protons, you have a triplet, etc. So for n equivalent protons, you get n+1 lines. But wait, that's the case when each nucleus is coupled to the electron. So if all nine protons are equivalent, then the number of lines would be 9 + 1 = 10 lines. So the EPR spectrum would have 10 lines.

Wait, but looking at the options, for example, option B has 10 lines (the 1:19:...:1), which is 1 through 10 elements. Option E has 8 lines, etc. So the question is, does the t-Bu radical produce an EPR signal with 10 lines?

But wait, I might be mixing up something. Because sometimes, when the hyperfine coupling is small, the lines can be more complicated. Wait, no, if all nine protons are equivalent and coupled equally, then it's a single multiplet with 10 lines.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. The t-Bu radical actually has three equivalent methyl groups, each with three protons. But each methyl group is attached to the central carbon. So the way the coupling works is that each methyl group's protons are equivalent among themselves, but the coupling from different methyl groups might be considered as separate. Or are they all the same?

Wait no, all the protons are equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. So the radical is symmetric, so all nine protons are equivalent. Therefore, the EPR spectrum would be a single septet, nonet, or whatever. Wait, for n equivalent protons, you have a multiplet of n+1 lines. So for nine protons, that would be ten lines. So the line intensities would follow the binomial coefficients for n=9.

Wait, the binomial coefficients for (1 + x)^9 expansion. The coefficients are 1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1. So the ratio would be 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1. Looking at the options, option F is 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1. So that would match.

But wait, is that correct? Because sometimes, when there are multiple equivalent groups, the coupling might be treated as multiple smaller groups. For example, in the case of a CH3 group with three protons, for each group, but when there are three such groups, the splitting would be more complex. Wait, no, if all nine protons are equivalent, then it's a single coupling with n=9. So the number of lines is 10, and the intensities are the binomial coefficients.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember that the t-Bu radical's EPR spectrum isn't a single 10-line pattern. Alternatively, perhaps it's a septet or something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the t-Bu radical, (CH3)3C•, has a planar structure with three equivalent methyl groups around the central carbon. The unpaired electron is in a p orbital. Each methyl group has three equivalent protons, but the three methyl groups are equivalent to each other. So all nine protons are equivalent. So the hyperfine interaction would be with nine equivalent protons, each with I=1/2.

In that case, the EPR spectrum would be a single multiplet with 10 lines. The relative intensities would be given by the binomial coefficients for n=9, as I thought earlier. So the ratios are 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1.

Looking back at the options, option F is exactly that: 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because I thought that sometimes when you have multiple groups, the coupling constants might differ, but in t-Bu, all the protons are equivalent. So it must be that all nine are equivalent, leading to 10 lines with those binomial coefficients.

So the correct option is F.

The t-Bu radical, (CH3)3C•, is a symmetric molecule with three equivalent methyl groups attached to a central carbon. The unpaired electron resides in a p orbital on the central carbon, and all nine protons (three from each methyl group) are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. In EPR spectroscopy, the hyperfine splitting pattern arises from the interaction of the unpaired electron with these nine equivalent protons.

For a system with n equivalent nuclei, each with spin I = 1/2, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum is given by n + 1. Here, n = 9, so the spectrum will have 10 lines. The relative intensities of these lines follow the binomial coefficients from the expansion of (1 + x)^9, which are 1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1. Therefore, the ratio of line intensities in the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical is 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1.

Among the given options, the correct match for this ratio is:

**F: 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1**

This corresponds to the binomial coefficients for n = 9, confirming that all nine protons are equivalent and contribute to the observed hyperfine splitting pattern.
