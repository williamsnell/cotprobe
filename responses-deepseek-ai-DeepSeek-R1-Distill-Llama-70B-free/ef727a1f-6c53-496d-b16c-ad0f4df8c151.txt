Alright, so I've got this problem here about coordinate vectors in a basis. Okay, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might need to think carefully.

The question says that the basis B of R² consists of vectors v₁ = [3,1] and v₂ = [-1,3]. We're given the vector x = [10,10], and we need to find its B-coordinate vector. The options are A through J, so I need to figure out which one it is.

Hmm, okay, I remember that the coordinate vector of x with respect to basis B is a vector [a, b] such that x = a*v₁ + b*v₂. So I need to find scalars a and b where:

10 = 3a + (-1)b  ...(1)
10 = 1a + 3b    ...(2)

Wait, let me write that out properly. So equation (1) is 3a - b = 10, and equation (2) is a + 3b = 10.

I can solve this system of equations. Let's write them again:

3a - b = 10  
a + 3b = 10

I think I'll solve using substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's multiply the second equation by 3 so that the coefficients of 'a' in both equations are the same.

Multiplying equation (2) by 3: 3a + 9b = 30 ...(2a)

Now, subtract equation (1) from this new equation (2a).

(3a +9b) - (3a -b) = 30 -10  
3a +9b -3a +b = 20  
10b =20  
So b= 20 /10 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the subtraction. (3a +9b) - (3a -b) is 3a -3a +9b +b = 10b. And 30-10 is 20. So 10b=20 => b=2. Okay, that makes sense.

Now that I have b=2, I can substitute back into one of the equations to find 'a'. Let's use equation (2): a +3b =10. Substituting b=2:

a + 3*(2) = 10  
a +6 =10  
a=10-6=4.

So a=4 and b=2. That means the coordinate vector is [4,2]. Let me check the options. Option G is [4,2], so that should be the answer.

Wait, let me verify the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I mix up the equations.

From equation (1): 3a -b=10. If a=4, then 3*4=12, so 12 -b=10 → b=2. Correct.

Equation (2): a=4, 3b=6, 4+6=10. Correct again.

So yes, the coordinate vector is [4,2], which is option G.

To find the B-coordinate vector of \( x = [10, 10] \) with respect to the basis \( B = \{v_1 = [3, 1], v_2 = [-1, 3]\} \), we need to determine scalars \( a \) and \( b \) such that:

\[
x = a \cdot v_1 + b \cdot v_2
\]

This gives the system of equations:

\[
3a - b = 10 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
a + 3b = 10 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

To solve, multiply equation (2) by 3:

\[
3a + 9b = 30 \quad \text{(2a)}
\]

Subtract equation (1) from (2a):

\[
(3a + 9b) - (3a - b) = 30 - 10
\]
\[
10b = 20 \implies b = 2
\]

Substitute \( b = 2 \) into equation (2):

\[
a + 3(2) = 10 \implies a + 6 = 10 \implies a = 4
\]

Thus, the B-coordinate vector of \( x \) is \( [4, 2] \), which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
