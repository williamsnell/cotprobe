Question:

Statistical regression is a potential threat to a study’s internal validity when:

Options:

A: the researcher is unable to randomly assign participants to the different treatment groups.
B: there is a statistically significant difference in the gender distribution among the study's treatment groups.
C: participants are selected for inclusion in the study because of their extremely high or low scores on the pretest.
D: participants are selected for inclusion in the study based on their availability.
E: there is a statistically different number of participants in the study’s treatment groups.
F: the researcher has a personal bias towards a certain result.
G: the study is conducted in a controlled laboratory setting.
H: there is a statistically significant difference in the number of participants who drop out of the different treatment groups during the course of the study.
I: the researcher does not use a control group in the study.
J: the study's data is not normally distributed.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistical regression and internal validity in studies. Hmm, I remember that internal validity has to do with whether the study's results are due to the variables being tested, not other things. So the question is asking when statistical regression becomes a threat.

The options are A through J. Let me think through each one.

Option A: If the researcher can't randomly assign participants to treatment groups. I think this relates more to selection bias. Without random assignment, pre-existing differences might affect the results. But is that directly about statistical regression? Maybe not. Regression is more about extreme scores reverting to the mean.

Option B: Significant difference in gender distribution. That's a confounding variable, maybe. If one group has more males or females, that could affect results, but not sure if it's regression.

Option C: Participants selected for extremely high or low pretest scores. Oh wait, that sounds familiar. If you select people based on extreme scores, then on a post-test, their scores might naturally regress toward the mean. So this could lead to a situation where the changes are due to regression, not the treatment. That seems like a case where regression is a threat.

Option D: Selected based on availability. That's more about convenience sampling, which can introduce selection bias but isn't directly about regression.

Option E: Different number of participants. Unequal group sizes might affect statistical power but not sure about regression.

Option F: Researcher bias. That's more about experimenter effects or maybe confirmation bias, not directly related to statistical regression.

Option G: Controlled lab setting. That usually helps internal validity by controlling variables, so probably not a threat.

Option H: Dropout differences. That's attrition bias. If more people drop out from a group, it can affect the results, but is that regression? Maybe not directly.

Option I: No control group. That's a problem because you can't compare, but again, not specifically about regression.

Option J: Data not normally distributed. That affects statistical tests' assumptions but isn't directly a regression threat to validity.

Wait, so the key here is when participants are selected because of extreme scores. Statistical regression would mean that those extremes are likely to move toward the mean on retesting. So if you only include people with very high or very low pretest scores, any changes could be due to regression, making it seem like the treatment had an effect when it's just natural fluctuation.

So the answer should be option C.

Statistical regression poses a threat to internal validity when participants are selected for a study because of their extremely high or low scores on a pretest. This is because such extreme scores tend to regress toward the mean on subsequent measurements, potentially creating the illusion of an effect where none exists. This scenario directly relates to the concept of statistical regression as a threat to internal validity.

Answer: C
