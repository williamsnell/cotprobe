Okay, so I have this question about FM signals and percentage modulation. Hmm, I remember from my notes that FM modulation involves the frequency of the carrier wave changing in line with the audio signal. The question gives me a frequency range for a commercial FM broadcast, which is 88 to 108 MHz. Wait, but I think the carrier swing is given as 125 kHz. Oh right, carrier swing is the maximum deviation from the carrier frequency.

Percentage modulation, in FM terms, is calculated by the formula: (Maximum Deviation / Carrier Frequency) × 100%. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, I might be getting this mixed up with AM modulation. Oh wait, in AM, percentage modulation is (modulation index) × 100%, where modulation index is (E_m / E_c), the ratio of the maximum modulator voltage to the carrier voltage.

But for FM, the modulation index is different. Oh right, for FM, the modulation index (m) is the ratio of the frequency deviation to the carrier frequency. So m = Δf / f_c. And then percentage modulation would be m × 100%?

Wait, but wait. The carrier swing is the total deviation, right? So if the carrier can swing ±Δf, then the maximum deviation is Δf. So in this case, the maximum deviation is 125 kHz, which is 0.125 MHz. Oh wait, no, the carrier swing is 125 kHz. So the question is, is that the total swing (from -Δf to +Δf), or is it the maximum from the center? I think the carrier swing is the total deviation, meaning that Δf is 125 kHz. So from the center frequency, it goes up and down by 125 kHz, making the total swing 250 kHz. But wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Oh wait, no. The carrier swing is the total deviation from the center frequency. So if the carrier swings 125 kHz, that's from the center. So the maximum deviation is 125 kHz, not 250. So Δf is 125 kHz.

But wait, let me clarify. For example, if the carrier is at 95 MHz, and the maximum deviation is 125 kHz, then the frequency goes up to 95.125 MHz and down to 94.875 MHz. So the total swing is 250 kHz, but the maximum deviation from the carrier is 125 kHz on either side.

So the formula for percentage modulation in FM is (Δf / f_c) × 100%. So let's plug in the numbers.

Δf is 125 kHz, which is 0.125 MHz. The carrier frequency, f_c, is the center frequency of the FM band. Wait, the FM band runs from 88 to 108 MHz, so the center is (88 + 108)/2 = 98 MHz. So f_c is 98 MHz.

So Δf is 125 kHz = 0.125 MHz.

So m = (0.125) / 98. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.125 divided by 98 is approximately 0.0012755. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 0.12755%, which is about 0.128%. That's way too small, and none of the options match that.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Oh wait, no, maybe the percentage modulation in FM is usually given as (Δf / f_carrier) × 100%. But 0.125 / 98 is indeed about 0.127%. But looking at the options, the highest is 125%, the lowest is around 50%. So my approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Wait, perhaps in FM, the modulation index is based on the highest frequency deviation relative to the highest audio frequency, but I think that's more about the bandwidth.

Wait, another approach. Oh wait, I think FM percentage modulation is sometimes referred to as the modulation index, which is Δf divided by the audio frequency. But that's not the same as percentage modulation. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the question is using the maximum frequency deviation and the carrier swing to find the modulation percentage. Wait, carrier swing is the total deviation allowed, so the maximum deviation is 125 kHz. So the percentage modulation would be (max deviation / carrier frequency) × 100.

So using the same numbers: 0.125 MHz / 98 MHz.

Wait, 0.125 /98 is approximately 0.0012755, which is 0.12755%, which is about 0.13%. That's still way too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the maximum deviation over the base frequency of the carrier, but perhaps I should be using the maximum deviation divided by the frequency range or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The total frequency range of the FM signal is from 88 to 108 MHz, which is 20 MHz wide. The carrier is somewhere in the middle, say 98 MHz as before. The maximum deviation allowed is 125 kHz, which is much smaller than 20 MHz. So perhaps the percentage modulation is (2Δf)/(f_max - f_min), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is calculated as (2Δf)/(f_max - f_min) × 100%, where 2Δf is the total swing (250 kHz) and the bandwidth is 20 MHz.

So 250,000 Hz / 20,000,000 Hz = 0.0125, which is 1.25%. Also not matching any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the question is actually referring to AM modulation instead of FM? Because in AM, the percentage modulation is (E_m / E_c) × 100%, but the question is about FM.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing terms. Let me read it again: "carrier swing of 125 kHz." So in FM, the carrier swing is the maximum deviation. So the maximum frequency change. So the percentage modulation is (Δf / f_c) × 100.

But as I calculated earlier, that comes out to about 0.13%, which isn't any of the options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the carrier swing is the total variation, so the maximum deviation is 62.5 kHz, making Δf 62.5 kHz. Let me try that.

So 62.5 kHz is 0.0625 MHz. Then 0.0625 /98 = approx 0.000637, which is 0.0637%. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Δf / (f_max - f_min) × 100. So 125 kHz / (108 -88) MHz. 20 MHz is 20,000,000 Hz. So 125,000 / 20,000,000 = 0.00625, which is 0.625%. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the percentage is (Δf / (f_c)) × 100. So 125,000 Hz / 98,000,000 Hz = 0.0012755, 0.12755%. No.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the question is using a different approach. Oh wait, perhaps it's considering the total swing as 2Δf, so 250 kHz. So (250,000)/(98,000,000) = 0.00255, so 0.255%, still not matching.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 62.5%, which is 0.625. Ah, 125 kHz is 0.125 MHz. If I take 0.125 / 0.2 = 0.625, which is 62.5%. Wait, where did 0.2 come from? Oh, because 20 MHz? Wait, 108-88 is 20 MHz, but why would that be the denominator?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula they're using is (Δf / (f_max - f_min)) ) × 100. So 125 kHz / (20,000 kHz) × 100 = (125/20,000) × 100 = (0.00625) ×100 = 0.625%. No, that's 0.625%, not 62.5%.

Wait, maybe the formula is (2Δf)/(f_max - f_min) ×100. So 250 kHz / 20,000 kHz = 0.0125 ×100 = 1.25%. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Δf / (f_c/2)) ×100. Because 98 MHz is the center, so half of that is 49 MHz. So 0.125 /49 = approx 0.00255, 0.255%, still no.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (Δf / (f_max)) ×100. So 0.125 /108 = 0.001157, 0.1157%, nope.

Wait, perhaps I've got the formula wrong. Let me try to think of it another way. In FM, the modulation index is Δf / f_m, where f_m is the modulating frequency. But in this question, we don't have the modulating frequency, so that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the percentage modulation is (2Δf)/(f_c) ×100. So 250 kHz /98,000 kHz = 250/98,000 = approx 0.00255, 0.255%, still nothing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the parameters. Alternatively, maybe the carrier swing is 125 kHz, but that's the maximum deviation, and the formula uses that. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: 110%

B:125%

C:50%

D:62.5%

E:75%

F:83.3%

G:93.8%

H:57.1%

I:100%

J:90%

Wait, none of these are near 0.13%, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the carrier swing is the maximum total swing, so the deviation is 125 kHz on either side. So 2*(125 kHz) = 250 kHz. But that's the total frequency range used by the signal. So from 88 to 108 is 20 MHz, which is 20,000 kHz. But 250 kHz is much smaller than that, so that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula: percentage = (Δf / (f_c / 2)) ×100. So 0.125 MHz / (98 MHz /2) = 0.125 /49 ≈ 0.00255, which is about 0.255%, still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (Δf / (f_c)) ×100, but using a different value for f_c. Wait, 88 MHz is the lower end. So 0.125 /88 ≈ 0.00142, so 0.142%, no.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the modulation index as (Δf / f_c), then multiply by 100 to get percentage. So 0.125 /98 is 0.0012755, 0.1275%, which is about 0.13%. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question intended to use a different approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the percentage modulation is (100 * Δf) / (f_max - f_min). So (100 * 125 kHz) / (108 -88 MHz). Wait, 108-88 is 20 MHz = 20,000 kHz. So 125 /20,000 = 0.00625, 0.625%, which is 0.625%, but that's not any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Δf / (f_c)) *100%, but using the maximum frequency (108 MHz) as f_c. So 0.125 /108 ≈ 0.001157, 0.1157%, no.

Alternatively, maybe I've got the wrong formula. Let me think again. Maybe in FM, the percentage modulation is (Δf / B) ×100, where B is the bandwidth. But the bandwidth for FM is 2(β +1)W, where β is the modulation index and W is the message bandwidth. But without knowing the message bandwidth, I can't compute that.

Wait, maybe the percentage is (Δf / (f_c)) ×100, but perhaps the carrier frequency is 100 MHz for simplicity? Then 0.125 /100 would be 0.125%, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the term 'carrier swing'. Maybe 'carrier swing' refers to the total frequency swing, meaning 2Δf. So if the carrier swing is 125 kHz, that would mean Δf is 62.5 kHz.

So then, using Δf=62.5 kHz = 0.0625 MHz.

f_c is 98 MHz.

So (0.0625 /98) *100 = approx 0.0637%. Still not any of the options.

Hmm, maybe the question is using a different definition. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage modulation is (Δf / (f_max - f_min)) *100. So 125 kHz / (108-88 MHz) = 125 /20,000 = 0.00625, which is 0.625%, but that's not an option.

Wait, let me think of the options. Option D is 62.5%. That's 125/2 =62.5. So maybe the formula is (Δf / (Δf + f_c)) *100, but that would be 0.125 /98.125 ≈ 0.00127, 0.127%, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (2Δf)/f_c. So 250 /98 ≈ 2.55%, which is about 2.5%, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is actually about AM modulation, but it says FM. Because in AM, percentage modulation is E_m / E_c *100. But if the question is mistakenly using AM formula for FM, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach. Let me look up the formula for FM percentage modulation. Wait, I'm just trying to remember, but I think FM doesn't have 'percentage modulation' the same way as AM. Instead, it's the modulation index, which is Δf divided by the modulating frequency. But since the question is asking for percentage modulation, maybe it's using a different approach, perhaps considering the maximum possible deviation. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the ratio of the deviation to the carrier frequency in MHz.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Δf in kHz / (f_c in MHz)) ×100. So 125 kHz is 0.125 MHz. So 0.125 / 98 ×100 ≈ 0.127%. No, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the percentage modulation is (Δf / (f_c)) × 100. So let's compute 0.125 /98 *100.

0.125 /98 = approx 0.0012755. Multiply by 100 gives approx 0.12755%, which is 0.13%. None of the options are close to this.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the maximum possible frequency deviation for the FM band. Wait, I thought the maximum allowed deviation for commercial FM is ±75 kHz, but perhaps the question states 125 kHz. So that's given, so I have to use that.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is (Δf / (maximum possible deviation)) ×100. But that would require knowing the maximum allowed, which is given as 125 kHz. But that seems circular.

Wait, perhaps the question is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentage modulation in FM is given by (Δf / (f_c)) ×100, but using f_c as the center frequency of the channel, not the entire band.

For example, each FM channel is 200 kHz wide. So perhaps f_c is the center of the channel, say, 95 MHz, but that doesn't change much.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Δf / (f_c)) × 100, and Δf is 125 kHz, f_c is 98 MHz.

So 0.125 /98 = 0.0012755 → 0.12755%. Still nothing.

Wait, maybe the question is using the formula (Δf / (f_c / 1000)) × 100. Because 125 kHz is 0.125 MHz, and 98 MHz is 98,000 kHz. So 0.125 /98 = 0.0012755 → 0.12755%. No.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum frequency deviation over the carrier frequency. So 125 kHz / 98 MHz = 125e3 / 98e6 = approx 0.0012755, which is 0.12755%, as before.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to provide the total swing as 250 kHz, making Δf 125 kHz. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: 110% 

B: 125% 

C:50% 

D:62.5% 

E:75% 

F:83.3% 

G:93.8% 

H:57.1% 

I:100% 

J:90%

Looking at option D, 62.5%, which is 5/8 as a percentage. If the carrier swing is 125 kHz, which is 1/8 of a MHz (since 1 MHz is 1000 kHz), but 125 is 1/8 of 1000. Hmm, perhaps the formula is (Δf in kHz)/ (f_c in MHz) ×100.

So 125 /98 ≈1.2755 → 127.55%, which is more than 100%. That's option A, which is 110%. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (Δf in kHz) / (f_c in MHz) → 125 / 98 ≈1.2755. 127.55% is higher than any options except A (110) and B (125). So perhaps the intended answer is 125%, but that's option B. But 125 doesn't match 125/98.

Wait, 125/98 is approximately 1.2755, so 127.55%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 125%, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (2Δf) / f_c × 100. So 250 /98 ≈2.55%, which is option F? No, F is 83.3%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula is (Δf / (f_c / 1000)) ×100. So Δf is 125 kHz, which is
