Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates and kinetics. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about the reaction 2NO + O2 → 2NO2. The problem gives me some information about how the initial reaction rate changes when the concentrations of the reactants are varied. My job is to figure out the rate expression for this reaction.

Alright, so the rate expression generally looks like rate = k [NO]^m [O2]^n, where m and n are the orders of reaction with respect to NO and O2, respectively. My goal is to find m and n.

The problem states two scenarios:

1. When the initial concentration of O2 is doubled while keeping NO constant, the reaction rate doubles.
2. When the initial concentration of NO is doubled while keeping O2 constant, the reaction rate quadruples.

I remember from my studies that the rate dependence on each reactant is determined by how the rate changes when that reactant's concentration changes, assuming others are held constant. So I'll analyze each scenario to find the orders m and n.

Let's start with the first scenario: doubling O2 concentration. The rate goes from some initial rate (let's say rate1) to double (2 rate1). The change in NO concentration isn't a factor here because it's held constant.

In terms of the rate equation, if [O2] is doubled, the rate becomes 2 times what it was before. So mathematically, if [O2] is doubled (multiplied by 2), the rate becomes 2 * rate_initial. So I can write this as:

rate2 = 2 * rate1 = k [NO]^m (2[O2])^n.

But since [NO] is constant, let's call [NO]^m as a constant C for this scenario. So,

rate2 = C * (2)^n * [O2]^n.

Wait, no, because [O2] was initially [O2], and now it's 2[O2]. So actually, the original rate is k [NO]^m [O2]^n = C [O2]^n (since [NO] is constant). When [O2] doubles, the new rate is C (2[O2])^n. But the rate becomes 2 times the original, so:

2 * rate_initial = C (2)^n ( [O2]^n ) = C (2^n) [O2]^n.

But rate_initial is C [O2]^n, so 2 * rate_initial = 2 C [O2]^n.

Comparing both sides:

C (2^n) [O2]^n = 2 C [O2]^n.

Divide both sides by C [O2]^n:

2^n = 2 => n=1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if n=1, then doubling [O2] would double the rate, which is exactly what the first scenario says. So n is 1.

Wait, let me double-check. If the rate is proportional to [O2]^n, and when [O2] is doubled, the rate doubles, that implies n=1 because 2^1=2.

So n=1.

Now the second scenario: doubling [NO] leads to the rate quadrupling. Let's apply the same logic.

The rate expression when [NO] is doubled is:

rate2 = k (2[NO])^m [O2]^n.

Since [O2] is constant, let's call [O2]^n as another constant D. So,

rate2 = k D (2^m) [NO]^m.

But the original rate was k [NO]^m [O2]^n = D [NO]^m.

When [NO] is doubled, the rate becomes 4 times the original, so:

rate2 = 4 * rate_initial = 4 D [NO]^m.

But according to the rate expression,

rate2 = k D (2^m) [NO]^m = D 2^m [NO]^m.

So,

D 2^m [NO]^m = 4 D [NO]^m.

Divide both sides by D [NO]^m:

2^m = 4.

What's m here? 2^m=4 → m=2 because 2^2=4.

So m=2.

Putting it all together, the rate expression is rate = k [NO]^2 [O2]^1, which can also be written as rate = k [NO]^2 [O2].

Looking at the options:

Option G is rate = k [NO]^2 [O2].

Option E is rate = k [NO]^2 [O2]^2. No, because O2's exponent is 1, not 2.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: [NO]^4 [O2]^2
B: [NO]^2 [O2]^3
C: [NO][O2]^2
D: [NO]^3 [O2]^2
E: [NO]^2 [O2]^2
F: [NO]^4 [O2]
G: [NO]^2 [O2]
H: [NO]^3 [O2]
I: [NO][O2]^3
J: [NO][O2]

Yes, option G matches rate = k [NO]^2 [O2], which is what I found. So the correct answer should be G.

To determine the rate expression for the reaction \( 2\text{NO} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{NO}_2 \), we analyze how the reaction rate changes with variations in the concentrations of NO and O\(_2\). The general rate expression is assumed to be of the form:

\[
\text{rate} = k [\text{NO}]^m [\text{O}_2]^n
\]

where \( m \) and \( n \) are the orders of reaction with respect to NO and O\(_2\), respectively.

### Scenario 1: Doubling [O\(_2\)] with [NO] constant
When the concentration of O\(_2\) is doubled, the reaction rate also doubles. This implies that the rate is directly proportional to [O\(_2\)], meaning:

\[
n = 1
\]

### Scenario 2: Doubling [NO] with [O\(_2\)] constant
When the concentration of NO is doubled, the reaction rate quadruples. This indicates that the rate depends on the square of [NO], meaning:

\[
m = 2
\]

### Final Rate Expression
Substituting \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 1 \) into the general rate expression gives:

\[
\text{rate} = k [\text{NO}]^2 [\text{O}_2]
\]

### Matching with the Options
From the given options, the correct match is:

**G: rate = k [NO]\(^2\) [O\(_2\)]**

This is consistent with the derived rate expression.
