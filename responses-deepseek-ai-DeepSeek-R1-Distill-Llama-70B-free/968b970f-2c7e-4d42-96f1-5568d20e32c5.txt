Okay, so I have this question about sensory memory and how long images and sounds are stored there. Hmm, I remember that sensory memory is the first stage of memory processing. From what I learned before, there are different types of sensory memory for different senses. Like, iconic memory for visual stuff and echoic for auditory.

Wait, I think iconic memory lasts just a few seconds, maybe less than a second even. But wait, isn't that for very brief storage? Or was it longer? I'm a bit confused. Oh right, I think sensory memory holds information for a very short period, so that the brain can process it into short-term memory if needed.

The options are given as A to J. The question is about images and sounds, so both visual and auditory. So I should consider both types. I remember that iconic memory (visual) is very brief, maybe a fraction of a second, but echoic (auditory) can last a few seconds longer, like up to a few seconds.

Wait, but the question is asking about images and sounds maintained in sensory memory. So which one is longer? Oh, maybe the longer duration applies here. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the general duration of sensory memory, which is usually a few seconds.

Looking at the options, option A is less than 5 seconds. Option C says only while the sensory input is present. That makes sense because sensory memory is about the immediate input. But wait, no, because I think sensory memory holds the info for a brief moment even after the stimulus is gone. So for example, you can still see an image for a split second after you close your eyes.

So option C can't be right because it's only while the input is present. So the correct duration must be a bit longer, but not too long.

Option D is 10 to 15 seconds. That feels a bit long for sensory memory. I thought it's shorter than that. Short-term memory is the one that can last up to about 30 seconds if you don't rehearse it.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the different memory types. Let me think again. Sensory memory is the first step, and it's really brief. So images (iconic) might last up to half a second, sounds (echoic) up to a few seconds. So overall, the duration isn't more than a few seconds, maybe less than 5.

So looking back, option A is less than 5 seconds. That seems to fit better. But wait, some sources say that echoic memory can last up to 4 seconds. So images less than a second, sounds up to 4. So the maximum for sounds would be around 4 seconds, which is less than 5. So the overall maximum for either is under 5, making option A correct.

So the answer should be A, less than 5 seconds.

Images and sounds are briefly stored in sensory memory, which acts as the initial stage of memory processing. Sensory memory is divided into iconic memory (visual) and echoic memory (auditory). Iconic memory lasts for a fraction of a second, while echoic memory can persist for a few seconds, up to approximately 4 seconds. The question asks about the general duration for both images and sounds in sensory memory, and the maximum duration does not exceed 5 seconds. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: less than 5 seconds.
