Question:

Define and describe incidental memory and subliminal perception(subception).

Options:

A: Incidental memory and subliminal perception are both processes that involve a high level of conscious effort and attention in order to encode and retrieve stimuli.
B: Incidental memory is the conscious recall of stimuli
C: Incidental memory is the intentional memorization of stimuli for later retrieval, while subliminal perception refers to stimuli that are too weak to be noticed but still influence behavior.
D: Subliminal perception is the ability to perceive and recall stimuli that are presented at high speeds, whereas incidental memory is a type of memory that is used for routine tasks.
E: Incidental memory and subliminal perception both require the subject's awareness
F: Incidental memory is the retrieval of information that was encoded during a state of distraction, whereas subliminal perception refers to the perception of stimuli that have been consciously ignored.
G: Subliminal perception is consciously perceiving high intensity stimuli
H: Incidental memory involves the unconscious retention of information from daily experiences, while subliminal perception is the perception of stimuli that are presented above the conscious threshold but not remembered.
I: Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness. Subliminal perception, also called subception, is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold at which it can be consciously perceived.
J: Incidental memory is the deliberate memorization of information using mnemonic devices, and subliminal perception is the conscious perception of low intensity stimuli.

Okay, so I have this question about incidental memory and subliminal perception, also called subception. Hmm, I need to figure out what each of these terms means and then match them to the correct options given.

Let me start by recalling what I know about memory types. I remember that there are different ways information is stored, like explicit and implicit memory. Explicit is when you consciously remember something, like facts or events. Implicit is more about skills and stuff you do without thinking.

Wait, incidental memory... I think that's when you remember something without having made a deliberate effort to do so. Like when you're doing something else and information just gets stored without you trying. For example, if someone tells you their name while you're distracted, you might remember it later without having specifically tried to memorize it.

Now, subliminal perception or subception. From what I remember, subliminal refers to stimuli that are below the threshold of conscious awareness. So, like messages or images flashed so quickly that you don't consciously notice them, but they might still influence your behavior or thoughts. It's like those ads that supposedly embed messages in videos or images that you don't consciously see but might affect you.

So, putting that together: incidental memory is about unintentional recall, and subliminal perception is about perceiving without conscious awareness.

Looking at the options now.

Option A says both require high conscious effort. No, that doesn't fit. Incidental is without effort, and subliminal is without awareness.

Option B says incidental is conscious recall. Well, maybe, but I think it's more about the encoding being incidental, not necessarily the recall. So maybe not the best choice.

Option C: Incidental is intentional memorization. Wait, no, because incidental is when you don't intend to memorize. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Subliminal perception is high speeds, but I thought it's more about being below the threshold, not necessarily speed. So D might not be right.

Option E: Both require awareness. No, because subliminal is below awareness, so E is wrong.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval from distraction. That sounds about right. And subliminal is perception of consciously ignored stimuli. Wait, but subliminal is when it's below the threshold, so maybe not about ignoring. Hmm, not sure.

Option G: Subliminal is high intensity. No, it's the opposite, low intensity or brief.

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences. That sounds right because it's about not trying to remember. Subliminal perception is above threshold but not remembered. Wait, no, subliminal is below the threshold. So H seems incorrect on the second part.

Option I: Incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. Wait, no, because incidental is about encoding without intention, but the stimuli were probably perceived consciously at the time. Subliminal is when the stimulus was below the threshold. So I might have it reversed.

Option J: Incidental is deliberate with mnemonics. No, that's the opposite. So J is wrong.

Wait, let me reconsider. Subliminal perception is when a stimulus is presented below the conscious threshold, so the person doesn't consciously perceive it, but it might still influence them. So the definition should mention that.

Looking again. Option I says: Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. That can't be right because I thought incidental memory is when you were aware but not paying attention to remember. Like, you were focused on something else and picked up info incidentally.

So maybe the correct option is F. Let me read F again.

Option F: Incidental memory is the retrieval of info encoded during distraction. That fits. And subliminal perception is perception of stimuli consciously ignored. Wait, but subliminal is when the stimuli are below the threshold, not ignored. So maybe F isn't correct either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again.

Incidental memory is when you learn without intending to. For example, when you're reading a book for pleasure and later remember some facts from it without trying to study them. So it's about the encoding being incidental, not the retrieval.

Subliminal perception is about stimuli that you don't consciously notice, but they still affect you. Like in advertising, where a brand logo flashes so quickly you don't see it, but it might influence your choices.

Looking back at the options, which one correctly describes both.

Option I: Incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. No, because the stimuli were probably perceived, just not the intent to remember.

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences, and subliminal is above threshold but not remembered. Wait, subliminal is below threshold. So H is incorrect.

Option C: Incidental is intentional, which is wrong.

Option B: Incidental is conscious recall, but that doesn't explain the encoding part.

Wait, maybe I missed the correct option. Let me go through each again.

Option I: Incidental memory is recall that never reached awareness. No, that's more like subliminal.

Wait, no, subliminal is about perception, not memory. So subliminal is about the perception, and incidental is about the encoding without intention.

Looking for an option where incidental is unintentional memory, and subliminal is perception without awareness.

Looking at option I: It says incidental is recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. That's not right because incidental stimuli were probably perceived consciously but without the intention to remember.

So perhaps the correct option is F. Let me re-examine F.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval from distraction (so encoding during distraction), and subliminal is perception that was consciously ignored. Hmm, I'm not sure if "consciously ignored" is the same as being below the threshold. Maybe not. Subliminal is when the stimulus is too weak or brief to be noticed, not that you choose to ignore it.

Wait, maybe option I is the reverse of what it should be. Let me read it again.

Option I: Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness. Subliminal perception is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold.

Wait, no. That would mean that in incidental memory, the stimuli were never consciously perceived, which isn't correct. Because in incidental memory, you did perceive them, just weren't paying attention to remember.

So perhaps the correct option is H.

Option H: Incidental memory involves the unconscious retention from daily experiences, while subliminal is perception above threshold but not remembered.

No, because subliminal is below threshold. So H is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps option I is incorrect, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the terms. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F.

Wait, maybe I should look for the option where incidental is about encoding without intention, and subliminal is about perception without awareness.

Looking again, the correct option would be where incidental memory is unintentional encoding and subliminal is sub-threshold perception.

Looking at the options, which one matches that?

Option I says: Incidental is recall that never reached awareness. No, that's not right because the stimuli were perceived.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is F. Let me check F again.

Option F: Incidental memory is retrieval from distraction. So that implies that during encoding, the person was distracted. Subliminal perception refers to stimuli that were consciously ignored. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's accurate for subliminal.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each term's definitions.

- Incidental memory: occurs when information is acquired without conscious intent; the person wasn't trying to remember it. It's part of implicit memory.

- Subliminal perception: refers to the perception of stimuli that are below the threshold of conscious awareness. So the person doesn't consciously perceive the stimulus, but it might still affect their behavior.

So looking for an option where:

- Incidental memory is about unintentional encoding.

- Subliminal perception is about stimuli that are not consciously perceived.

Looking through the options again.

Option I: Incidental is recall that never reached awareness (so the stimuli were never perceived consciously). No, that's not right because in incidental memory, the stimuli were perceived, just not the intent to remember.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval from distraction (so during encoding, the person was distracted). Subliminal is perception of consciously ignored stimuli. Hmm, but subliminal isn't about ignoring; it's about not perceiving due to being below threshold.

Option H: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences. Wait, that might fit. And subliminal is perception above threshold but not remembered. No, because subliminal is below threshold.

Wait, perhaps option F is the closest. Incidental memory is about encoding during distraction, and subliminal is about perceiving without awareness. But F says subliminal is about "consciously ignored", which might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is none of the above except one that correctly describes both.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for an option that correctly defines both terms.

Looking at option I again: it says incidental is recall that never reached awareness, which I think is wrong. Subliminal is about a stimulus just below the threshold, which is correct. So perhaps the first part is wrong but the second part is correct. So I can't choose I.

Looking at option H again: Incidental is unconscious retention from daily experiences (so no conscious intent, which fits). Subliminal is perception above threshold but not remembered. No, subliminal is below threshold.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each option again.

Option F: Incidental memory is retrieval from distraction (so encoding was during distraction, which fits). Subliminal perception refers to the perception of stimuli that were consciously ignored. No, because subliminal is about being below the threshold, not about being ignored.

Option B: Incidental is conscious recall. That's only about the retrieval, not the encoding.

Option C: Incidental is intentional memorization. No, that's wrong.

Option D: Subliminal is high speed presentation. Not necessarily, it's about the threshold.

Option E: Both require awareness. No.

Option G: Subliminal is high intensity. No, it's low.

Option J: Incidental is deliberate with mnemonics. No.

So the only option that comes close is F, but the subliminal part is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option I is the correct one. Let me read it again.

Option I: Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness. Subliminal perception, also called subception, is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold at which it can be consciously perceived.

Wait, that can't be right because in incidental memory, the stimuli were perceived; the subject was just distracted. So the first part of option I is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C: Incidental memory is the intentional memorization of stimuli for later retrieval, while subliminal perception refers to stimuli that are too weak to be noticed but still influence behavior.

No, that's incorrect because incidental is not intentional. So option C is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me think of the definitions again.

Incidental memory is memory that occurs without conscious intention. For example, remembering a conversation you overheard without trying to.

Subliminal perception is when a stimulus is presented below the conscious threshold, so you don't perceive it consciously, but it might affect your behavior.

Looking at the options, the only one that correctly describes both is option I? No, because option I says incidental is recall that never reached awareness, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is F. Let me reread F.

Option F: Incidental memory is the retrieval of information that was encoded during a state of distraction, whereas subliminal perception refers to the perception of stimuli that have been consciously ignored.

So, for incidental, the encoding was during distraction, which fits. Subliminal is about perceiving stimuli that were ignored, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Subliminal is more about the stimuli being below the threshold, not about the person ignoring them.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at each option again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, considering that during distraction, the encoding was incidental. And subliminal is about not perceiving. But F says subliminal is perception of consciously ignored stimuli, which might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I. Let me think again.

Option I says:

Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness.

No, that's incorrect because in incidental memory, the stimuli were perceived but not the intent to remember.

Subliminal perception is when the stimulus is below the threshold.

So perhaps the correct option is the one where:

- Incidental memory: unintentional encoding.

- Subliminal perception: below threshold perception.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct one is option F, but I'm not sure because the subliminal part may not be accurate.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option H.

Option H: Incidental memory involves the unconscious retention of information from daily experiences, while subliminal perception is the perception of stimuli that are presented above the conscious threshold but not remembered.

No, because subliminal is below threshold, not above.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should go through each option systematically.

Option A: Both require high conscious effort. Incorrect.

Option B: Incidental is conscious recall. Partially correct but doesn't explain encoding.

Option C: Incidental is intentional. Wrong.

Option D: Subliminal is high speed. Not necessarily; it's about threshold.

Option E: Both require awareness. No.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval from distraction (encoding during distraction). Subliminal is perception of consciously ignored. Maybe subliminal isn't about ignoring but about not being perceived.

Option G: Subliminal is high intensity. No.

Option H: Subliminal is above threshold. No.

Option I: Incidental is recall that never reached awareness. No, because stimuli were perceived.

Option J: Incidental is deliberate. No.

So perhaps the correct answer is option F, accepting that subliminal is about perception that was ignored, even though that's not entirely accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is none of them, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the correct definitions again.

Another approach: incidental learning is a type of learning that happens without a deliberate intention to learn. It's unintentional.

Subliminal perception is perception that occurs below the threshold of consciousness.

So looking for an option where:

- Incidental memory: unintentional, without conscious effort to remember.

- Subliminal perception: stimuli not consciously perceived.

Looking again, perhaps the correct option is F.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval from distraction (so encoding was without intention), and subliminal is perception of consciously ignored stimuli.

Wait, but I'm not sure if "consciously ignored" is the same as subliminal. Subliminal is more about the stimulus being below the threshold, not the person's action of ignoring.

Alternatively, maybe option I is correct, but I think it misdefines incidental.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option F.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to match each term.

The correct answer should be:

Incidental memory: unconscious retention, no intention to remember.

Subliminal perception: stimuli below conscious threshold.

Looking for an option that says this.

Looking at option F again, it seems to describe incidental correctly but perhaps not subliminal.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

Wait, I'm going to make a choice. I think the correct answer is option F.

No, wait, I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Another thought: subliminal perception is also known as subception. So which option mentions subception correctly?

Option I mentions subception as subliminal perception.

Option I's definition of subliminal is correct, but its definition of incidental is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

I think I'm going to have to go with option I being incorrect and perhaps option F being the best fit, even though it's not perfect.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we need to evaluate the definitions of incidental memory and subliminal perception (subception) and match them to the options provided.

### Definitions:
1. **Incidental Memory**: This refers to the unintentional encoding and retrieval of information without conscious effort or intent. For example, remembering a conversation overheard while distracted. The stimuli are perceived consciously, but the act of remembering is not deliberate.

2. **Subliminal Perception (Subception)**: This involves the perception of stimuli that are presented below the threshold of conscious awareness. These stimuli are not consciously noticed but may still influence behavior or thought.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Both processes do not require high conscious effort. Incidental memory involves no deliberate effort, and subliminal perception occurs below conscious awareness.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While incidental memory may involve conscious recall, this option does not address the unintentional nature of encoding.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Incidental memory is not intentional; it occurs without deliberate effort.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Subliminal perception is not about high-speed presentation but about stimuli below the conscious threshold.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Subliminal perception does not require awareness, so this option is invalid.
- **Option F**: Partially correct. Incidental memory is described as retrieval of information encoded during distraction, which aligns with its unintentional nature. However, subliminal perception is described as the perception of "consciously ignored" stimuli, which is inaccurate. Subliminal perception refers to stimuli below the threshold of awareness, not consciously ignored ones.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Subliminal perception involves low-intensity stimuli, not high-intensity ones.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Subliminal perception is not about stimuli presented above the threshold but below it.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Incidental memory is misdefined as the recall of stimuli that never reached awareness. In reality, incidental memory involves stimuli that were consciously perceived but not deliberately encoded.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Incidental memory is not deliberate, and subliminal perception is not about conscious perception of low-intensity stimuli.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, none perfectly describe both incidental memory and subliminal perception. However, **Option F** comes closest, as it correctly describes incidental memory but inaccurately describes subliminal perception. Despite its imperfections, it is the best available choice.
