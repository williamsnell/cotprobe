Okay, so I've got this problem about naphthalene evaporating, and I need to find the rate at which it's evaporating. Hmm, let's see. The problem gives me some data, and I need to calculate the evaporation rate. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me jot down the given information:

- The solid sphere has a radius of 2.5 mm, which is 0.0025 meters.
- The surrounding air is still, at 300 K and 1 atm.
- The surface temperature of naphthalene is also 300 K.
- The vapor pressure of naphthalene at this temperature is 0.104 mm Hg.
- The diffusivity of naphthalene in air at 318 K is 6.92e-6 m²/s.

Wait, but the temperature here is 300 K, and the diffusivity is given at 318 K. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the diffusivity for the correct temperature. Or perhaps the problem expects me to use it as is? Not sure yet. I'll come back to that.

The question asks for the rate of evaporation. I think this relates to mass transfer, so maybe I should use Fick's Law of diffusion. Fick's Law is something like the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient. The formula I remember is:

Flux (J) = -D * (dC/dx)

But since the medium is air and the naphthalene is evaporating into it, I might need to model this as a spherical system. Oh wait, the sphere is solid, so maybe the concentration gradient is from the surface of the sphere outwards into the air.

Wait, but in a solid, the concentration of the substance diffusing (naphthalene) would be zero, right? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the evaporation is from the surface into the surrounding air, which is quiescent.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should consider the mass transfer from the sphere's surface to the surrounding air. Since the air is still, it's probably under a condition of natural convection, but if it's still, maybe it's a pure diffusion problem.

Alternatively, for a sphere, the mass transfer coefficient might be used. But I'm not too sure. Let me think about the formula.

Wait, perhaps the solution involves the concept of molar flux, which is the rate of moles per area per time. So, the evaporation rate would be the molar flux multiplied by the surface area of the sphere.

The formula for molar flux (N_A) in the case of evaporation into a surrounding gas (like air) can be given by:

N_A = (D * P) / (R * T * L)

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. I think the general approach for mass transfer in a stationary medium is to use the diffusion equation for a sphere.

Wait, perhaps the evaporation rate can be found using the formula:

m_dot = (2π D M r) * (C_s - C_inf) / (1)

Wait, no, perhaps that's for a different scenario. Alternatively, for a sphere in a quiescent fluid, the Sherwood number might be relevant. The Sherwood number (Sh) relates the convective mass transfer to the diffusion. But since the air is still, maybe it's just pure diffusion, so Sh would have a certain value.

Wait, I recall that for a sphere, in the case of pure diffusion (no convection), the Sherwood number can be approximated as Sh = 2π r/D * ... Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula for steady-state diffusion from a sphere.

Alternatively, I think the flux for a sphere in a stationary medium can be determined using a concentration gradient. But perhaps it's easier to think about it in terms of partial pressures.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the molar flux from the surface of the sphere into the air. Since the vapor pressure of naphthalene at the surface is given, and assuming the surrounding air is at atmospheric pressure, with negligible naphthalene concentration, the concentration gradient would be from the surface (high concentration) to the air (low, effectively zero).

Wait, the vapor pressure is given as 0.104 mm Hg, which is much lower than atmospheric pressure (1 atm). So the partial pressure of naphthalene in the surrounding air is negligible, so we can approximate it as zero. Thus, the concentration at the surface is based on the vapor pressure, and in the bulk, it's zero.

So, the molar flux (N_A) would be given by:

N_A = (D * P_s) / (R * T * L)

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Alternatively, the molar flux can be determined by considering the concentration difference. The concentration (C) is moles per volume, which can be found from the ideal gas law: C = P/(R T).

So, the concentration of naphthalene at the surface would be C_s = P_vapor / (R T), and the concentration in the bulk air is C_inf = 0 (since the surrounding air has negligible naphthalene). So, the concentration difference is ΔC = C_s - C_inf = C_s.

Now, for steady-state diffusion from a sphere, the molar flux would be determined by Fick's law integrated over the sphere's surface. Wait, but Fick's law in spherical coordinates for a sphere would involve the radius and the surface area.

Alternatively, the mass transfer rate (m_dot) can be found by:

m_dot = (2π D r) * (C_s - C_inf) * M

Where M is the molar mass of naphthalene.

Wait, let me make sure. I think the formula for the rate of evaporation from a sphere is:

m_dot = (2π D M r) * (P_s)/(R T) 

Wait, because C_s = P_s/(R T), and since C_inf is zero, (C_s - C_inf) = P_s/(R T). So substituting that into the equation, the m_dot becomes:

m_dot = (2π D r) * (P_s/(R T)) * M

But wait, perhaps I should think in terms of molar flux. The molar flux N_A would be (D * (C_s - C_inf))/ (distance), but for a sphere, the effective distance is the radius. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for mass transfer from a sphere is:

m_dot = 2π r D (ρ_s - ρ_inf) 

Where ρ is the density. But since the surrounding air's density of naphthalene is zero, ρ_inf = 0. So m_dot = 2π r D ρ_s.

But then I need ρ_s, the density of naphthalene vapor at the surface. Which would be (P_s M)/(R T), because for an ideal gas, density is (P M)/(R T).

So putting it all together:

m_dot = 2π r D (P_s M)/(R T)

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the molar flux. Let me think again.

The molar flux N_A is in units of mol/(m² s). So, N_A = (D * (C_s - C_inf)) / (characteristic length). Wait, but for a sphere, perhaps it's better to use the formula involving the surface area.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look for another approach.

Another approach is to model the evaporation using the concept of diffusion. The rate of evaporation (m_dot) is the product of the diffusion coefficient (D), the concentration gradient, and the surface area.

The surface area of the sphere is 4π r². The concentration gradient is (C_s - C_inf) / (distance). But in a sphere with radius r, the distance over which the concentration drops is from r to infinity, but that's complicated. Wait, perhaps for a sphere in a quiescent fluid, the concentration gradient at the surface can be approximated, and the molar flux is determined as N_A = D (C_s - C_inf)/ (r). But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for mass flux as:

N_A = (D * C_s) / r

Because the gradient is over the radius. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should refer to a standard formula. Oh wait, I remember that for a sphere in a quiescent fluid, the molar flux can be calculated using:

N_A = (2π D C_s r) / (distance), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the Sherwood number, Sh, which for a sphere in pure diffusion (Pe << 1) is Sh = 2.

The Sherwood number is defined as Sh = (k_L r)/D, where k_L is the mass transfer coefficient. So if Sh = 2, then k_L = 2 D / r.

Then, the molar flux N_A would be k_L (C_s - C_inf) = (2 D / r) * C_s.

But then, the total molar transfer rate would be N_A multiplied by the surface area (4 π r²). So:

m_dot (mol/s) = N_A * A = (2 D C_s / r) * 4 π r² = 8 π D C_s r.

Wait, but C_s is P_s/(R T), so substituting that in:

m_dot = 8 π D (P_s/(R T)) r.

Wait, but that would give a molar rate, and then I can multiply by the molar mass to get kg/s.

Alternatively, the formula I derived earlier was m_dot = 2π r D (P_s M)/(R T).

Wait, but according to the Sherwood approach, I get m_dot = 8 π D (P_s/(R T)) r. Wait, but that would be molar rate multiplied by surface area. Let me check the units.

Wait, let's get the units right. Let's see:

D is m²/s.

r is in meters.

P_s is in Pa (or mmHg converted to Pa).

R is J/(mol K) = (m² kg)/(s² mol K).

T is in K.

M is kg/mol.

So, let's see what the units would be.

In the formula m_dot = 2π r D (P_s M)/(R T):

Each part's units:

r: m

D: m²/s

P_s: Pa = kg/(m s²)

M: kg/mol

R: (m² kg)/(s² mol K)

T: K

So putting it together:

(m) * (m²/s) * (kg/(m s²)) * (kg/mol) ) / ( (m² kg)/(s² mol K) * K )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: m * m²/s * kg/(m s²) * kg/mol = (m^3 * kg^2) ) / (s^3 mol)

Denominator: (m² kg)/(s² mol K) ) * K = (m² kg)/(s² mol)

So overall: [m^3 kg^2 / (s^3 mol)] / [m² kg/(s² mol)] ] = (m^3 kg^2 s² mol) ) / (s^3 mol m² kg) ) 

Simplify:

m^(3-2) = m

kg^(2-1) = kg

s^(2-3) = 1/s

mol cancels out.

So units are kg/(m s).

Wait, but m_dot should be in kg/s. Hmm, but according to this, the formula gives kg/(m s), which is flux, not the total rate. So perhaps I missed the surface area term.

Wait, right! Because in the formula m_dot = 2π r D (P_s M)/(R T), that would be the flux multiplied by the circumference (2π r), but not the entire surface area. So perhaps the correct formula should include the surface area.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try another approach.

The general equation for diffusion is:

m_dot = -D * A * (dC/dx)

But for a sphere, the area A is 4π r², and the concentration gradient at the surface is (C_s - C_inf)/(dr), where dr is the thickness of the boundary layer. Hmm, but I'm not sure about dr.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula to use is:

m_dot = (D * A * (C_s)) / (r)

Because the concentration drops from C_s at r to 0 at infinity, so the average gradient is C_s / r.

Wait, that might not be accurate, but let's try it. So m_dot = (D * 4π r² * C_s) / r = 4π r D C_s.

But C_s is P_s/(R T), so substituting:

m_dot = 4π r D (P_s/(R T)).

This would be the molar rate, in mol/s. To get kg/s, multiply by molar mass M.

So total mass rate is:

m_dot (kg/s) = 4π r D (P_s M) / (R T).

Hmm, that seems plausible. But wait, earlier when I considered the Sherwood number approach, I got a different coefficient. Let me check that again.

In the Sherwood approach, for a sphere in pure diffusion, Sh = 2. So Sh = (k_L r)/D = 2 → k_L = 2 D / r.

Then, the molar flux N_A = k_L (C_s - C_inf) = (2 D/r) * C_s.

The total molar rate is N_A * A = (2 D C_s / r) * 4 π r² = 8 π D C_s r.

Which is twice the formula I just got earlier. So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Sherwood approach. Let me think again.

Sherwood number is the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient, defined as Sh = (k_L L)/D, where L is the characteristic length. For a sphere, L is typically the diameter, but some sources use radius. Wait, I think for a sphere, the characteristic length is the diameter, so L = 2r. So Sh = (k_L * 2r)/D.

If Sh = 2 for pure diffusion in a sphere, then 2 = (k_L * 2r)/D → k_L = D/(r).

Thus, molar flux N_A = k_L (C_s - C_inf) = (D/r) C_s.

Then, total molar rate is N_A * A = (D C_s / r) * 4 π r² = 4 π D C_s r.

Which matches the earlier formula I derived without considering Sherwood.

So the m_dot (molar) is 4 π D r C_s.

But wait, if Sh = 2, then k_L = Sh D / L. Since L is diameter (2r), then k_L = 2 D / (2r) ) = D/(r).

So indeed, N_A = (D/(r)) C_s.

Thus, m_dot (molar) = 4 π r² * (D C_s)/(r) ) = 4 π D r C_s.

Which is the same as before.

So, the formula is m_dot (mol/s) = 4 π D r (P_s)/(R T).

Then, to convert to kg/s, multiply by molar mass M.

So, m_dot (kg/s) = 4 π D r (P_s M)/(R T).

Wait, but let me check the units again.

P_s in Pa = kg/(m s²)

R in J/(mol K) = (m² kg)/(s² mol K)

So, (P_s M)/(R T) = (kg/(m s²) * kg/mol) ) / ( (m² kg)/(s² mol K) * K ) )

Wait, let me compute that:

(kg/(m s²)) * (kg/mol) ) → kg²/(m s² mol)

Denominator: (m² kg)/(s² mol K) * K → (m² kg)/(s² mol)

So overall, (kg²/(m s² mol)) ) / (m² kg/(s² mol)) ) = (kg² * s² mol * m²) ) / (m s² mol * m² kg) )

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Numerator: P_s * M = (kg/(m s²)) * (kg/mol) ) = kg²/(m s² mol)

Denominator: R * T = ( (m² kg)/(s² mol K) ) * K ) = m² kg/(s² mol)

So, (P_s M) / (R T) ) = [kg²/(m s² mol)] / [m² kg/(s² mol) ] 

= (kg²) / (m s² mol) * (s² mol) / (m² kg) )

= kg / (m^3 )

So kg/m^3, which is density (kg/m³). So that makes sense because (P_s M)/(R T) is the molar concentration, which when multiplied by molar mass gives mass concentration.

Wait, no. Wait, C_s is P_s/(R T), which is in mol/m³. Then, when multiplied by M (kg/mol), it gives kg/m³, which is mass concentration. So, (P_s M)/(R T) is the mass concentration, kg/m³.

So, m_dot (kg/s) = 4 π D r (P_s M)/(R T).

Wait, but wait, let's think about this.

Because Fick's law is in terms of molar concentration, but when we multiply by molar mass, we get mass flux.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's proceed.

So, the formula I think I should use is:

m_dot = (4 π r^2) * (D) * (C_s) * (M)

Wait, no, because C_s is in mol/m³, and M is kg/mol, so C_s * M is kg/m³.

Then, m_dot = (surface area) * (D) * (C_s * M) / (characteristic length), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is m_dot = (2 π r D) (C_s * M).

But I'm getting stuck. Let me just proceed with the formula I derived, which is:

m_dot (kg/s) = 4 π D r (P_s M)/(R T)

Now, I need to calculate each component.

First, let's list all the constants and given values.

Given:

r = 2.5 mm = 0.0025 m
