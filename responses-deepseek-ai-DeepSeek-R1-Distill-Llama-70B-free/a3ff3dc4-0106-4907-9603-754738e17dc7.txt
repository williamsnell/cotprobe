Okay, so I've got this problem here with two parts, (a) and (b), and I need to calculate the power wasted and the heat developed. Hmm, let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): A transmission line made of two No. 0 copper wires, 5 miles long. Current is 75 amperes. I need to find the power wasted. Wait, power wasted usually refers to the power lost as heat in the transmission line. Oh right, that's due to the resistance of the wires.

I remember that the formula for power loss is P = I²R, where I is current and R is resistance. So I need to find the resistance of the wires first.

But wait, what's the resistance of a copper wire? Oh right, the resistance R is given by R = ρ * (L/A), where ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area. But wait, wait, the formula might be R = (resistivity * length) / area. Yeah, that's right.

Wait, wait, but I'm dealing with two wires, right? Because a transmission line has two conductors. So each wire is 5 miles long, but since there are two, the total length is 2*5 miles = 10 miles. Oh wait, no, wait. When calculating the resistance for each wire, each is 5 miles long. So each has a resistance R, and the total for the loop (since it's two wires) would be R_total = R + R = 2R. Or wait, no. Wait, each wire is 5 miles. So each has resistance R = ρ*(5 miles) / area. Then for the entire loop, the resistance is R = 2 * (each wire's R). So R_total = 2R.

Wait, but wait, another approach: The total length of the loop is 10 miles (each wire 5 miles). So R = ρ * (10 miles) / area.

Wait, maybe it's easier if I just remember the formula for resistance for each wire and then double it.

Wait, but I need to know the resistivity of copper. From what I remember, the resistivity of copper is about 1.68 × 10^-8 ohm-meters. But wait, the units here are in miles, so I need to convert that.

Wait, the wires are 5 miles long each. So the total loop is 10 miles. Let me convert that into meters because the resistivity is in ohm-meters. 1 mile is 1609.34 meters, so 10 miles is 10 * 1609.34 = 16093.4 meters.

Wait, no, each wire is 5 miles, so each is 5 * 1609.34 = 8046.7 meters. So each wire's resistance is R = ρ*(L)/A.

But wait, I also need the cross-sectional area of a No. 0 copper wire. I think the American Wire Gauge (AWG) tells us that. So No. 0 AWG has a diameter of about 8.255 millimeters or 0.325 inches. Let me confirm. Oh yes, No. 0 AWG is 0.325 inches in diameter, which is 8.255 mm. So radius is half that, so 4.1275 mm. But wait, cross-sectional area is πr². Let me compute that.

The area in square meters. So radius r is 4.1275 mm, which is 0.0041275 meters. Area A = π * (0.0041275)^2. Let me compute that. 0.0041275 squared is about (approx) 1.7e-5. Multiply by π, so around 5.34e-5 m².

Wait, but I can get the exact value. Wait, let me compute r: 8.255 mm is 0.008255 meters. So radius is 0.0041275 m. Then A = π * (0.0041275)^2.

Calculating that, 0.0041275 squared is (0.0041275)^2 = approx 1.703e-5. Multiply by π gives about 5.35e-5 m².

So each wire has a resistance R = (resistivity) * (length) / (area). So resistivity ρ for copper is 1.68e-8 ohm·m.

So R for one wire is (1.68e-8 ohm·m) * (8046.7 m) / (5.35e-5 m²).

Let me compute that numerator first. 1.68e-8 * 8046.7 = 1.68e-8 * 8.0467e3 = let's compute 1.68 * 8.0467 is approximately 13.53, so 13.53e-5 (since 1e-8 *1e3 is 1e-5). So 1.353e-4. Then divide by 5.35e-5 m².

So 1.353e-4 / 5.35e-5 = approximately 2.527 ohms per wire. Wait, that seems high. Wait, 1.353e-4 divided by 5.35e-5 is about 2.527. So each wire has a resistance of about 2.527 ohms. So for the loop (two wires), the total resistance is 2 * 2.527 = 5.054 ohms.

Wait, but is that correct? So each wire is 5 miles, 8046.7 meters. Let's redo the calculation perhaps more accurately.

Compute R for one wire:

R = (1.68e-8) * 8046.7 / (5.35e-5)

Let me compute numerator: 1.68e-8 * 8046.7 = 1.68 * 8046.7 = let's compute 1.68 * 8000 = 13440, 1.68 *46.7 ≈ 78.5, so total approx 13518.5, so 13518.5e-8 = 0.000135185 ohms? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1.68e-8 is 0.0000000168. Multiply by 8046.7 meters: 0.0000000168 * 8046.7 ≈ 0.0001352 ohms. Then divide by area 5.35e-5 m².

So 0.0001352 / 0.0000535 = approx 2.525 ohms. So yes, each wire is about 2.525 ohms, so two wires would be 5.05 ohms total.

Wait, but that seems low for 5 miles, but maybe copper is a good conductor.

Now, the current I is 75 A. So power lost is I² R. So P = 75² * 5.05.

75 squared is 5625. So 5625 *5.05 = let's compute 5625 *5 =28125, 5625 *0.05=281.25. So total is 28125 + 281.25 = 28406.25 watts, which is 28.406 kilowatts. So around 28.4 kW.

Wait, but let me check if my calculation of resistance is correct. Because 5 miles for each wire. Let me think again.

Another approach: Use the formula for resistance in terms of AWG. I think the standard formula for resistance per 1000 feet can be used. Because sometimes people use that for wire calculations.

Wait, AWG No. 0 has a certain resistance per 1000 feet. I think for copper, No. 0 AWG is about 0.1 ohms per 1000 feet. Wait, is that right? Because I recall that for 12 AWG, it's around 5 amps for 12 volts over 100 feet or something, but that's a different matter. Let me confirm: No. 0 AWG is about 0.1 ohms per 1000 feet.

Wait, if that's the case, then for 5280 feet in a mile, 5 miles is 5 *5280 = 26400 feet. So each wire is 26400 feet.

So resistance per wire would be (0.1 ohms per 1000 ft) * (26400 ft) / 1000 = 0.1 * 26.4 = 2.64 ohms. So each wire is 2.64 ohms, so the loop is 5.28 ohms. Then power would be 75^2 *5.28.

Wait, 75^2 is 5625. 5625 *5.28 = let's compute 5625 *5 =28125, 5625 *0.28=1575. So total 28125 + 1575 = 29700 watts, which is 29.7 kW.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. So which one is right?

Hmm, perhaps I should cross-check. Because using the AWG table, No. 0 AWG has a resistance of approximately 0.1 ohm per 1000 feet at 20°C. So let me confirm with that.

So 5 miles is 5*5280 = 26400 feet. So for each wire, R = 0.1 ohm/1000 ft * 26400 ft = 2.64 ohms. So loop resistance is 5.28 ohms.

Power loss P=I² R=75² *5.28=5625 *5.28.

Let me compute 5625 *5 =28125, 5625 *0.28= 5625*(0.2+0.08) = 1125 + 450 = 1575. So 28125 +1575= 29700 W =29.7 kW.

So that would be 29.7 kW wasted. Hmm, but earlier calculation using resistivity gave me about 28.4 kW. So why the discrepancy? Oh, perhaps the resistivity value I used was incorrect, or perhaps the AWG table is at a different temperature or something. But the options have 29.7 kW as option A, and 28.5, etc.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A for part (a) is 29.7 kW, and part (b) is 712,800 calories.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the resistivity calculation. Let me recalculate using the resistivity approach.

So resistivity of copper, rho = 1.68e-8 ohm·m.

Length of each wire: 5 miles = 5 *1609.34 meters = 8046.7 m.

Area of No. 0 wire: diameter is 0.325 inches. So radius r = 0.325/2 = 0.1625 inches. Convert to meters: 0.1625 *0.0254 = 0.0041275 m.

Area A = π r² = π (0.0041275)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * (1.703e-5) ≈ 5.35e-5 m².

So R for one wire: rho * L / A = (1.68e-8 ohm·m) * 8046.7 m / 5.35e-5 m².

Compute numerator: 1.68e-8 * 8046.7 = 1.68 *8046.7 *1e-8.

1.68 *8046.7 = let me compute 1.68 *8000= 13440, 1.68*46.7= approx 78.5. So total ≈ 13518.5. So 13518.5e-8 = 0.000135185 ohms.

Divide by area 5.35e-5 m²: 0.000135185 / 0.0000535 ≈ 2.525 ohms per wire.

So loop resistance is 5.05 ohms.

Thus, P =75^2 *5.05 =5625 *5.05.

Let me compute that: 5625 *5 =28125, 5625 *0.05=281.25, so total 28406.25 W, which is 28.406 kW, approximately 28.4 kW.

But according to the AWG method, it's 29.7 kW. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the AWG resistance. Another source says that for No. 0 AWG, the resistance is approximately 0.1 ohms per 1000 feet. So 5 miles is 26400 feet, so 26.4 * 0.1 =2.64 ohms per wire. Thus, loop is 5.28 ohms, P=75^2 *5.28=5625 *5.28= 5625*5=28125, 5625*0.28=1575, total 29700 W=29.7 kW.

But why is there a difference between the two methods? Oh, perhaps because the resistivity approach used a slightly different value for resistivity or area.

Wait, let me recalculate the resistivity approach with more precise numbers.

Area calculation: diameter is 0.325 inches, so 0.325 * 2.54 cm/inch = 0.826 cm? Wait, no, 0.325 inches is 8.255 mm. So radius is 4.1275 mm, or 0.0041275 meters.

Area A = π*(0.0041275)^2 = π*(0.0041275 *0.0041275).

Compute 0.0041275^2: 0.0041275 *0.0041275.

Let me compute 4.1275e-3 squared: (4.1275)^2 = approx 17.03, so 17.03e-6, which is 1.703e-5 m². Multiply by π: 5.351e-5 m².

So R per wire = (1.68e-8) *8046.7 /5.351e-5.

Compute denominator 5.351e-5 is 0.00005351.

So 1.68e-8 *8046.7 = let's compute 1.68 *8046.7 = 1.68 *8000=13440, 1.68*46.7≈78.5, total 13518.5. So 13518.5e-8 = 0.000135185.

Then 0.000135185 / 0.00005351 ≈ 2.525 ohms.

So loop is 5.05 ohms. Power is 75^2 *5.05=5625 *5.05=5625*(5 +0.05)=28125+281.25=28406.25 W=28.406 kW, which is 28.4 kW.

But the AWG method gave me 29.7 kW. So which one is correct? I think perhaps I should go with the AWG method because it's a standard value, and perhaps the resistivity approach is correct but maybe the area calculation was slightly off.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach using the AWG is more accurate because it's a standard reference. So 29.7 kW is the power wasted.

So part (a) is 29.7 kW.

Now part (b): How many calories of heat per hour are developed in an electric heater which takes 7.5 amperes at 110 volts.

The heater operates at 7.5 A and 110 V. So the power consumed is P=V*I=110 *7.5 =825 watts.

Now, power is energy per time, so in one hour, the energy is 825 W *3600 s=2,970,000 joules.

But wait, the question is about calories. I remember that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So to convert joules to calories, we divide by 4.184.

So 2,970,000 J /4.184 J/cal ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 2,970,000 /4.184.

Approximately 2,970,000 /4.184 ≈ 710,000 calories.

Wait, let me compute it precisely.

First, 4.184 × 710,000 = ?

4 *710,000=2,840,000.

0.184 *710,000= approx 0.184 *700,000=128,800; 0.184*10,000=1,840 → total 130,640.

So 2,840,000 +130,640 =2,970,640, which is a bit over. So 710,000 cal would be about 2,970,640 joules, but our initial is 2,970,000 J, which is slightly less. So perhaps approximately 709,700 cal.

But looking at the options, for part (b), the options are in the 700,000s. So for example, option A has 712,800, option J has 710,000, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute 2,970,000 /4.184 = ?

Let me compute 4.184 × 710,000 = 2,970,640 J as above. But our value is 2,970,000 J, which is 640 J less. So 710,000 cal corresponds to 2,970,640 J, but we have 2,970,000, which is 640 J less. So how much less in calories?

Since 1 cal =4.184 J, so 640 J is 640/4.184 ≈ 153 cal. So 710,000 -153=709,847 cal. Approximately 709,800 cal.

Looking at the options, none have exactly 709,800. But the closest is option J:710,000, and option A:712,800. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using a different calorie value, like 1 cal =4.1868 J.

Let me recalculate with 4.1868.

Energy E =825 W *3600 s=2,970,000 J.

Calories =2,970,000 /4.1868 ≈ let's compute.

4.1868 × 710,000 = ?

4 ×710,000=2,840,000.

0.1868 ×710,000= approx 0.1*710,000=71,000; 0.08*710,000=56,800; 0.0068 *710,000≈4,828. So
