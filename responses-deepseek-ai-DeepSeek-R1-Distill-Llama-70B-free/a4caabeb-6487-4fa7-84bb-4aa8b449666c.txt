Question:

An owner-retailer in a small shopping center entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement with an investor. The retailer stayed in possession and became the lessee for the next 25 years with monthly payments and various obligations regarding maintaining the property. The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?

Options:

A: Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.
B: No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.
C: No, because the investor can deny any changes that they think will devalue the property.
D: Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.
E: Yes, because the lessee has the right to make alterations to improve business operations.
F: Yes, since the lessee's business is growing and needs expansion, the investor should comply.
G: Yes, because the lessee has the right to make changes as he is the one paying for the property.
H: No, the investor has the final say in any changes to the property since they are the legal owner.
I: No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a sale-leaseback arrangement. Let me start by understanding the scenario. 

The situation is that an owner-retailer sold their property to an investor and then leased it back for 25 years. The retailer is now the lessee and has to make monthly payments and maintain the property. They also have options to extend the lease but can't buy the property back. Now, the lessee wants to tear down one building and attach a new one to their store, but the investor refuses. The lessee is suing to force the investor to agree.

I remember that in lease agreements, there are usually terms about making alterations or improvements. The key here is to determine who has the right to make changes to the property. 

In a typical lease, the lessee might have some rights to make improvements, especially if it's a long-term lease. But the lease would often require the lessor's consent for major changes. If the lease includes a clause that prohibits alterations without consent, then the lessee can't just go ahead without the investor's approval.

So looking at the options:

A: Says the lessee can make improvements without consent, but they belong to the investor. That doesn't seem right because usually, the lessor would need to consent, especially for major changes like tearing down a building.

B: Claims every sale-leaseback has a clause preventing improvements without consent. I don't think that's necessarily true. It depends on the specific lease terms.

C: Suggests the investor can deny changes that devalue the property. That makes sense because as the owner, the investor would want to protect their asset's value.

D: Lessee's equity surpasses the investor's. I don't think equity works that way in a lease. The investor is the legal owner, so their interest is superior.

E: Lessee can make alterations to improve business. This might be the case if the lease allows it, but if the lease requires consent, then no.

F: The business growth justifies the change, but legally, it's about the lease terms, not just the business need.

G: Lessee pays for the property, so they can make changes. But they're paying rent, not owning it, so that's not correct.

H: Investor has final say as legal owner. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

I: Without consent, lessee can't make drastic changes. This also seems correct because the lease likely requires consent.

So the court would probably side with the investor because they own the property and the lease likely requires their consent for major alterations. Therefore, the answer should be either H or I. 

Looking back, H says the investor has the final say as owner, which is correct. I says the lessee can't make drastic changes without consent, which is also correct. But the question is about whether the court compels the investor to comply. So if the lease requires consent, the court won't force the investor unless the lease allows it.

So the correct answer is H or I. Wait, the options are H and I. Which one is more accurate?

Option H states that the investor has the final say because they're the legal owner. Option I says the lessee can't make drastic changes without consent. Both are correct, but which is the better answer.

In property law, the owner (investor) typically has the right to approve or deny changes. So the court would likely side with the investor, meaning the answer is no, the court won't compel the investor. So the options are H and I. Both are 'no' answers.

Wait, the question is whether the court will order the investor to comply. So the answer is no, they won't. So looking at the options, H and I are both 'no's.

But I need to pick between H and I. Option H says the investor has the final say as the legal owner. Option I says it's because the lease precludes drastic changes without consent.

I think the more accurate reasoning is that the lease likely includes a clause requiring the lessee to get consent for such changes. So the court would look at the lease terms. Therefore, option I might be more precise because it's about the lease terms, not just ownership.

Wait, but option H is about the investor being the legal owner, which also gives them the right to control the property. So both are valid, but which is more directly applicable.

In a sale-leaseback, the investor owns the property, so they have the right to dictate changes. So H might be the better answer.

Alternatively, the lease probably has a specific clause about alterations, so I might be better.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think in most cases, the lease will explicitly state that the lessee cannot make structural changes without the lessor's consent. So the court would enforce that lease term, making option I the correct choice.

Wait, but the options are phrased differently. Option I says it will preclude the lessee from making drastic changes without consent. So that's about the lease terms, not just ownership.

So I think the answer is I. No, the court won't compel because the lease likely prohibits such changes without consent.

Wait, but earlier I thought H was correct because ownership gives the right. But the question is about the lease terms. So the court's decision would be based on the lease. So if the lease requires consent, the lessee can't proceed without it. Therefore, the answer is I.

The question revolves around a sale-leaseback arrangement where the lessee (retailer) seeks to make significant alterations to the property without the lessor's (investor's) consent. The key issue is whether the court will compel the investor to allow the changes. 

In a sale-leaseback arrangement, the investor becomes the legal owner of the property, and the lessee's rights are governed by the terms of the lease. Typically, leases include clauses requiring the lessor's consent for major alterations or improvements. Without such consent, the lessee generally cannot make drastic changes, especially those that could alter the property's structure or value. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H** states that the investor, as the legal owner, has the final say in changes to the property. This is a valid point, as ownership typically confers the right to control the property.  
- **Option I** emphasizes that the lease terms likely preclude the lessee from making drastic changes without the investor's consent. This is also accurate, as courts generally enforce lease terms requiring consent for significant alterations.

While both H and I are plausible, the court's decision would primarily hinge on the specific terms of the lease. Since the lease likely includes a clause requiring consent for major changes, the court would enforce this provision, making **Option I** the more precise answer.

Answer: I
