Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about two groups of women. Group 1 consists of women who spend less than $500 annually on clothes, and Group 2 is those who spend over $1000. There's a parameter p1 and p2, which are the proportions of women in each group who believe clothes are too expensive. 

The data given is that 1009 out of a random sample of 1230 women from Group 1 believe clothes are too expensive. For Group 2, 207 out of 340 sampled women feel the same way. 

The question asks for a point estimate of p1 - p2. So I think that means I need to calculate the difference between the two sample proportions and use that as the estimate for the difference in the population proportions.

Alright, so point estimates for p1 and p2 would be the sample proportions. So for Group 1, p1 hat is 1009 divided by 1230. And for Group 2, p2 hat is 207 divided by 340. Then, subtracting the two will give the estimate for p1 - p2.

Let me do the calculations step by step.

First, calculate p1 hat:
1009 divided by 1230. Let me compute that. Hmm, 1009 ÷ 1230. I might use a calculator for this, but since I'm just thinking, I'll approximate. Let's see, 1230 times 0.8 is 984, because 1230 *0.8 = 984. So 1009 is a bit more than 0.8. 1009 -984 is 25. So 25/1230 is about 0.0203 (since 1230 *0.02 is 24.6, which is close). So p1 hat is approximately 0.8 + 0.02 = 0.8203. Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me recalculate that because I think I messed up the division.

Wait, 1230 * 0.8 is indeed 984. So 1009 is 25 more than 984. So 25/1230 is approximately 0.0203. So 0.8 + 0.0203 is 0.8203. So p1 hat ≈ 0.8203.

Now, p2 hat is 207 divided by 340. Let's compute that. 340 * 0.6 is 204, so 207 is 3 more. So 3/340 is about 0.0088. So p2 hat is approximately 0.6 + 0.0088 = 0.6088.

Wait, wait, let me do that again. 340 times 0.6 is 204. So 207 is 3 more, so 3/340 = 0.0088235. So p2 hat is 0.6 + 0.0088235 = 0.6088235. So approximately 0.6088.

So now, p1 hat - p2 hat is 0.8203 - 0.6088 = 0.2115. That would be the point estimate of p1 - p2.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.2115. So that's the answer.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me compute the exact values more precisely.

Calculating p1 hat: 1009 / 1230. Let's do this division more accurately.

Well, 1230 goes into 1009 how many times? Wait, no, 1009 is less than 1230, so it's 0. Let's compute 1009 ÷ 1230.

Let me think in terms of decimal division. 1230 * 0.8 = 984 as before. 1009 - 984 = 25. So 25/1230 = 0.0203. So 0.8 + 0.0203 = 0.8203.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

1009 ÷ 1230.

Compute 1009 ÷ 1230.

Let me compute 1009 ÷ 1230.

= (1009 * 10000) ÷ 1230 ≈ Let me compute 1009 ÷ 1230 step by step.

Alternatively, I can write it as 1009/1230. Let me divide 1009 by 1230.

We can compute this as 1009 ÷ 1230 ≈ 0.8203.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me try:

1230 ) 1009.0000

Wait, since 1230 is larger than 1009, we write it as 0. and proceed.

So 1230 goes into 10090 how many times?

1230 *8 = 9840. So 8 times. 10090 - 9840 = 250.

Bring down a zero: 2500.

1230 *2 = 2460. So 2 times. 2500 - 2460 = 40.

Bring down a zero: 400.

1230 goes into 400 zero times. Next digit is 0.

Bring down another zero: 4000.

1230 *3 = 3690. So 3 times. 4000 - 3690 = 310.

Bring down a zero: 3100.

1230 *2 = 2460. 3100 - 2460 = 640.

Bring down a zero: 6400.

1230 *5=6150. So 5 times. 6400-6150=250.

Wait, this is starting to repeat. So the division gives 0.820325... So p1 hat is approximately 0.8203.

Now for p2 hat: 207 / 340.

Compute 207 ÷ 340.

340 ) 207.0000

340 goes into 2070 6 times because 340*6=2040. 2070 - 2040 =30.

Bring down a zero: 300.

340 goes into 300 zero times. Next digit is 0.

Bring down a zero: 3000.

340 *8=2720. 3000-2720=280.

Bring down a zero: 2800.

340 *8=2720. 2800-2720=80.

Bring down a zero: 800.

340 *2=680. 800-680=120.

Bring down a zero: 1200.

340 *3=1020. 1200-1020=180.

Bring down a zero: 1800.

340 *5=1700. 1800-1700=100.

Bring down a zero: 1000.

340 *2=680. 1000-680=320.

Bring down a zero: 3200.

340 *9=3060. 3200-3060=140.

So putting it all together, 207 ÷340 ≈ 0.608823529... So approximately 0.6088.

Now, subtracting the two: 0.8203 - 0.6088 = 0.2115.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.2115. So the answer should be A.

To find the point estimate of \( p_1 - p_2 \), we first calculate the sample proportions for Group 1 and Group 2:

- For Group 1:  
  \[
  \hat{p}_1 = \frac{1009}{1230} \approx 0.8203
  \]

- For Group 2:  
  \[
  \hat{p}_2 = \frac{207}{340} \approx 0.6088
  \]

The point estimate of \( p_1 - p_2 \) is then:  
\[
\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 = 0.8203 - 0.6088 = 0.2115
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 0.2115**.
