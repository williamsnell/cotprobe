Okay, so I have this question about connective tissue, and I need to figure out which option is NOT an example of it. Let me think about what I remember from biology class.

Connective tissue, if I remember right, is one of the four main types of tissue in the body. The others are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Connective tissue's main job is to support, connect, and bind other tissues and organs. It's kind of like the glue that holds everything together.

Looking at the options:

A: Tendons. Tendons connect muscles to bones, right? They're made of dense connective tissue. So A is connective.

B: Skin. Skin is actually considered a type of connective tissue because it's made up of various layers and structures, including connective tissue components like collagen and elastin. Or wait, no, I think skin is an organ with multiple layers, and the dermis is connective tissue. So maybe the skin as a whole isn't just connective, but parts of it are. Hmm, maybe this is the exception.

C: Muscle. No, muscle is a separate category. There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. So C is muscle tissue, not connective. So this could be the answer.

Wait, but the question is asking for the exception, which is NOT connective tissue. So if C is muscle, that's the correct answer. But let me go through all the options to make sure.

D: Blood. Blood is considered a type of connective tissue. It's a liquid tissue, but yeah, it's classified under connective because it connects various parts and transports substances. So D is connective.

E: Cartilage. Definitely connective. It's a type of connective tissue that provides support and cushioning, like in joints.

F: Lymph. Lymph is a connective tissue fluid that's part of the lymphatic system. So F is connective.

G: Adipose tissue. That's fat tissue, which is a type of connective tissue. It's the body's main energy storage.

H: Bone. Bone is a type of connective tissue. It's more solid and rigid, but it's connective.

I: Ligaments. Ligaments connect bones to other bones and are made of dense connective tissue. So I is connective.

So looking back, the options that are not connective are B, C, and I? Wait no. Wait, option B is skin. Is skin a connective tissue? I'm a bit confused. I think the dermis (the layer under the epidermis) is connective, but the skin as a whole is an organ, not just connective tissue. But the question is about examples of connective tissue. So if one of the options is an organ rather than a tissue, that could be the exception.

Wait, but the other options like tendons and ligaments are specific tissues, not organs. So skin is an organ, made up of various tissues, including connective. So skin as a whole isn't a connective tissue, it's an organ. So if the question is about examples of connective tissue, then B (skin) is not an example. Or is it?

Wait, but I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me clarify: connective tissue types include:

- Loose connective tissue (like in the dermis)
- Dense connective (tendons, ligaments, bone matrix)
- Cartilage
- Bone
- Adipose
- Blood.

So, skin is made of multiple layers, including the epidermis (epithelial) and dermis (connective). But the skin itself is an organ, not a tissue. So if the question is asking which is NOT a connective tissue, then B (skin) would be the answer because it's an organ, not a tissue. Alternatively, if the option was the dermis, then it's connective.

But the question is about connective tissue examples, and all the options are tissues except one. Wait, no—let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are: tendons, skin, muscle, blood, cartilage, lymph, adipose, bone, ligaments.

Wait, skin is an organ, not a tissue. So in the list, all others are specific tissues except B, which is an organ. Therefore, the exception is B.

Wait, but earlier I thought C was muscle, which is a different category. So I'm a bit torn. Let me think again.

The question is asking which is NOT a connective tissue. So:

A: Tendon – connective.

B: Skin – an organ, not a tissue.

C: Muscle – a different primary tissue.

D: Blood – connective.

E: Cartilage – connective.

F: Lymph – connective.

G: Adipose – connective.

H: Bone – connective.

I: Ligament – connective.

So the options that are not connective tissue would be B (skin, an organ) and C (muscle, different tissue). But the question says 'the following are examples of connective tissue EXCEPT one'.

Wait, but the options include 'skin' as one of the choices. So the correct answer is either B or C.

Wait, but the question is about connective tissue. So muscle is a different type of tissue, not connective. So option C is muscle, which is not connective. So the exception is C.

Wait, but wait: the question says "examples of connective tissue EXCEPT". So all the options are connective except one. So if option C is muscle, which is a different category, then the answer is C.

Alternatively, if the option was about tissues, then skin would not be a connective tissue as it's an organ. But I'm not sure; perhaps the question is considering skin as connective because the dermis is part of it.

Wait, no. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recall: connective tissue includes blood, bone, cartilage, adipose, tendons, ligaments. Skin is an organ, so it's not a connective tissue.

So looking at the options, the answer would be either B (skin) or C (muscle). But the question is which is NOT a connective tissue.

Wait, but the question gives options, and I need to choose which is NOT connective.

So:

- A: Tendons – connective.

- B: Skin – organ, not tissue.

- C: Muscle – muscle tissue.

- D: Blood – connective.

- E: Cartilage – connective.

- F: Lymph – connective.

- G: Adipose – connective.

- H: Bone – connective.

- I: Ligaments – connective.

So the options that are not connective are B (skin, an organ) and C (muscle, a different tissue type). But the question says 'examples of connective tissue except', so which one is the exception. So the answer would be C: muscle.

Because muscle is a different type of tissue, not connective. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, I thought earlier that skin is an organ. So the answer could be B. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should think of the four primary tissues. They are:

1. Epithelial.

2. Connective.

3. Muscle.

4. Nervous.

So the connective tissues include structures like tendons, cartilage, bone, blood, etc.

Muscle is a separate category, so option C is muscle, which is not connective.

Skin is an organ made of multiple tissues, so it's not a connective tissue itself.

Wait, but the question is asking which is NOT an example of connective tissue. So if all the options are tissues except B (skin is an organ), then B is not a connective tissue. But the other option is C, which is muscle tissue.

Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Let's approach it differently. Are any of the options not a tissue at all? For example, skin is an organ, so it's not a tissue. So the question is about connective tissue examples, so B is not a connective tissue because it's an organ, and the other options are all tissues except B and C.

But the options are presented as things, not specifying whether they are tissues or organs. So perhaps the question expects the answer to be C, because muscle is a different type of tissue, whereas skin is an organ, which is a separate category altogether.

Wait, but the question asks for which is NOT a connective tissue. So if B is an organ, it's not a tissue, so it's not a connective tissue. Similarly, C is a muscle tissue, which is a different type.

Hmm, but the question gives options, and I have to choose among A to I. So perhaps the intended answer is C: muscle.

Because the question is about connective tissue, and muscle is a distinct category, while skin is an organ but the other options are tissues. So the exception is C.

Wait, but the question could be tricky. Let me think again: connective tissue includes structures like tendons, ligaments, bone, cartilage, blood, lymph, adipose. So all the options except C (muscle) and B (skin) are connective.

But the options are given as examples of connective tissue, except one. So the correct answer is either B or C.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it this way: skin is an organ, not a tissue. So it's not an example of connective tissue. But the options are A: tendons, which is a connective tissue, and so on.

So the question is, which option is NOT a connective tissue. So the answer is either B or C.

If I have to choose between B and C, I think the intended answer is C: muscle, because muscle is a different type of tissue, whereas skin's dermis is connective tissue, but skin as a whole isn't considered a connective tissue.

Wait, but if the question is about the options being connective tissues, then B (skin) is not a connective tissue because it's an organ, not a tissue. So the exception is B.

But I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. Maybe I should look up what counts as connective tissue.

Connective tissue supports and binds other tissues and organs. It is the most abundant tissue type. Examples include:

- Loose connective tissue (areolar tissue)
- Dense connective (tendons, ligaments)
- Cartilage
- Bone
- Adipose
- Blood.

So, from the options, A (tendons) – yes. B (skin) – no, it's an organ. C (muscle) – no, different type. D (blood) – yes. E (cartilage) – yes. F (lymph) – yes, because it's a component. G (adipose) – yes. H (bone) – yes. I (ligaments) – yes.

So the options that are NOT connective tissues are B and C. But the question asks for which is the exception, so one of them.

So the options are:

Which is NOT connective tissue?

So, if I have to choose between B and C, which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question gives options, and I have to choose among A to I. So perhaps the intended answer is C: muscle, because it's a different type of tissue.

Alternatively, if the question is about connective tissue, and one of the options is an organ (skin), then the answer is B.

Hmm, but the question says 'examples of connective tissue', so skin is not a connective tissue because it's an organ.

But then, the other option is C: muscle, which is a different tissue.

So which one is the correct exception.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 'skin', which is an organ, so it's not a connective tissue. Option C is 'muscle', which is a different tissue. So both are correct in being exceptions, but the question expects only one correct answer.

But in the given options, all except one are connective tissues. So perhaps the intended answer is C: muscle, because it's a different type of tissue, while skin is an organ, which is a different category.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: skin, because it's an organ, not a tissue, but the question is about connective tissue examples, and the others are tissues.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach it differently.

The question is phrased as 'examples of connective tissue EXCEPT'.

So, all the options are connective tissues except one.

Looking again:

A: Tendons – yes.

B: Skin – no, it's an organ.

C: Muscle – no, it's a different tissue.

D: Blood – yes.

E: Cartilage – yes.

F: Lymph – yes, as it's a connective tissue fluid.

G: Adipose – yes.

H: Bone – yes.

I: Ligaments – yes.

So the two exceptions are B and C. But the options only allow one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is C: muscle, because it's a different tissue type, while skin is an organ.

But the question gives multiple options, so perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers 'skin' as a connective tissue because the dermis is, but I think that's incorrect because skin is an organ composed of multiple tissues.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: connective tissue is a type of tissue, while skin is an organ made up of tissues, including connective. So 'skin' isn't a connective tissue itself.

So, in the options, the only one that's not a connective tissue is C: muscle.

Because all others (A, D, E, F, G, H, I) are connective tissues, B is an organ, but the question is about connective tissue examples, so B is an exception as it's not a tissue but an organ. But the question might consider B as an exception, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question asks for which is NOT an example of connective tissue. So if B is an organ, it's not a connective tissue, so it's the exception. Alternatively, C is a different tissue, so it's the exception.

I think I'm getting stuck because both B and C are exceptions, but the question expects one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is C: muscle.

Looking back at the question, it's multiple-choice, so only one correct option. So I think the intended answer is C: muscle, because it's a different type of tissue, whereas skin is an organ, which is a different category altogether.

Wait, but the options are given as examples of connective tissue, so perhaps the intended answer is B: skin, because it's an organ, not a connective tissue.

No, wait, that can't be because the question is about connective tissue, so if skin is an organ, it's not a connective tissue. So the exception is B.

But earlier, I thought that muscle is a different type of tissue, so it's also an exception.

This is confusing because both B and C are exceptions, but the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: muscle, because it's a different type of tissue, while the other option (B: skin) is an organ, which is not a tissue at all, so it's not a connective tissue either.

Hmm, but the question is about connective tissue, so perhaps the intended answer is C: muscle.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the answer in my notes. Oh well, I don't have my notes right now. Let me think of other examples.

When I think of connective tissue, I remember that blood is a connective tissue because it's a liquid tissue. Cartilage and bone are connective. Adipose is connective. Tendons and ligaments are connective. So options A, D, E, F, G, H, I are connective.

So the exceptions are B and C. But the question is about which is NOT an example.

So the options are:

A: Tendon – yes.

B: Skin – no.

C: Muscle – no.

D: Blood – yes.

E: Cartilage – yes.

F: Lymph – yes.

G: Adipose – yes.

H: Bone – yes.

I: Ligament – yes.

So the answer is either B or C.

But the question is which is NOT a connective tissue. So perhaps the intended answer is C: muscle, because it's a different type of tissue, whereas skin is an organ, which is a different category.

Wait, but the question is about connective tissue, so perhaps the exception is C: muscle.

So I'm going to go with C: muscle as the answer.

To determine which option is NOT an example of connective tissue, it is important to identify the characteristics of connective tissue and analyze each option accordingly. Connective tissue is one of the four primary tissue types in the body, along with epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Its main functions include supporting, connecting, and binding other tissues and organs. Examples of connective tissue include blood, bone, cartilage, adipose tissue, tendons, and ligaments.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A: Tendons**  
  Tendons are composed of dense connective tissue and connect muscles to bones. They are examples of connective tissue.

- **B: Skin**  
  Skin is an organ, not a tissue. While it contains connective tissue components (e.g., the dermis), skin as a whole is not classified as a connective tissue.

- **C: Muscle**  
  Muscle is a separate category of tissue (muscle tissue) and is not classified as connective tissue.

- **D: Blood**  
  Blood is a liquid connective tissue responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste products. It is an example of connective tissue.

- **E: Cartilage**  
  Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides cushioning and support, such as in joints.

- **F: Lymph**  
  Lymph is a connective tissue fluid that circulates through the lymphatic system. It is an example of connective tissue.

- **G: Adipose Tissue**  
  Adipose tissue, also known as fat tissue, is a type of connective tissue that stores energy.

- **H: Bone**  
  Bone is a rigid type of connective tissue that forms the skeleton.

- **I: Ligaments**  
  Ligaments are composed of dense connective tissue and connect bones to other bones. They are examples of connective tissue.

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, both **B (skin)** and **C (muscle)** are not examples of connective tissue. However, the question asks for a single exception. Since the question focuses on connective tissue and muscle is a distinct tissue type, the intended answer is **C: Muscle**.
