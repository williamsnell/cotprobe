Okay, so I've got this question about penile or clitoral erection and which system is activated for that. Hmm, I remember from biology that erection has to do with the nervous system. Let me think... There are two main parts of the autonomic nervous system: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic.

The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions, right? So when it comes to sexual arousal, like an erection, it's not something you consciously control. I think the parasympathetic system is involved in 'rest and digest' activities, while the sympathetic is 'fight or flight'. But wait, which one causes blood vessels to dilate?

Oh wait, during sexual arousal, the blood flow to the genitals increases. The parasympathetic system is responsible for promoting that. It causes the arteries to dilate, allowing more blood to flow into the erectile tissues, which leads to an erection. On the other hand, the sympathetic system is more about the 'fight or flight' response, which usually causes vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow. But I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another angle: I remember that the parasympathetic system is involved in erection, especially in the context of sexual stimulation. So when the parasympathetic nerves are activated, they release neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and nitric oxide, which cause smooth muscle relaxation. This relaxation allows increased blood flow into the penis or clitoris, leading to an erection.

But wait, isn't there a role for the sympathetic system as well? Maybe in ejaculation, which is more under sympathetic control. So the initial erection is parasympathetic, and the ejaculation part is sympathetic.

So the question is asking about the activation of which system causes the erection. So the answer should be the parasympathetic system. Looking at the options, option G is parasympathetic. So the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: parasympathetic.

The parasympathetic system is responsible for promoting sexual arousal, including penile or clitoral erection. It does so by causing blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the erectile tissues. This is facilitated by neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and nitric oxide, which relax smooth muscles. In contrast, the sympathetic system is more involved in 'fight or flight' responses and processes like ejaculation. Therefore, the activation of the parasympathetic system leads to erection.
