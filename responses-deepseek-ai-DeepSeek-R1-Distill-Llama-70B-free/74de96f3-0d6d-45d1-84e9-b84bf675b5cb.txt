Question:

A woman was hit in the right eye by a shard of glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?

Options:

A: Yes, because the damages awarded are excessive and not substantiated by concrete proof of earning capacity.
B: Yes, because the plaintiff failed to prove that she would have definitely become a successful professional ballet dancer.
C: Yes, because the defendant has the right to challenge the amount of the award given by the jury.
D: Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.
E: No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.
F: Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.
G: No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

So the scenario is about a woman who was in a car accident. She got hit in the right eye by a shard of glass, which caused her to lose her eye. She was hospitalized, had several operations over the years, and couldn't return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer. The reasons were loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She's considered totally disabled. 

At the trial against the person who caused the accident (the tortfeasor), she provided evidence that she was a bright and upcoming student in ballet, having trained for many years. The defendant argued that it's too speculative whether she would have been successful, but the trial court allowed evidence on her lost earning capacity as a ballet dancer. The jury then awarded her $3 million. The question is whether the appellate court will reverse this verdict because of the lost earning capacity issue.

The options are from A to G. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. So the key issue here is about the admissibility of evidence regarding lost earning capacity when the plaintiff's future success in a particular career is uncertain. The defendant claims it's too speculative, but the court allowed it, and the jury awarded a significant amount.

I remember that in tort law, when calculating damages for lost earning capacity, the plaintiff doesn't have to prove that they would definitely have succeeded in a particular career, but they do need to provide sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable estimate. The standard is that the damages shouldn't be based on mere speculation, but some degree of uncertainty is acceptable, especially when the plaintiff was young and had shown potential.

In this case, the woman was an apprentice ballet dancer with many years of training and was considered a bright upcoming student. This suggests that she had a plausible chance of succeeding in her career. While it's impossible to know for sure, juries are allowed to make reasonable inferences based on the evidence presented.

The defendant's argument is that it's too speculative, but the trial court allowed the evidence. So the appellate court would likely defer to the trial court's decision unless there was an abuse of discretion. Appellate courts usually don't overturn jury verdicts on damages unless they're clearly against the weight of the evidence or based on improper calculations.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the damages are excessive and not substantiated. But the question is more about the speculative nature, not the amount being excessive per se.

Option B says the plaintiff failed to prove she'd definitely become successful. But the law doesn't require definite proof, just a reasonable basis for estimating loss.

Option C says the defendant can challenge the award amount. While true that defendants can challenge, appellate courts usually don't reverse unless there's a clear error, like allowing improper evidence.

Option D claims the evidence didn't guarantee success. Again, the law doesn't require a guarantee, just sufficient evidence to support the claim.

Option E says the jury's award is discretionary and can't be disturbed. That's not entirely accurate because appellate courts can reverse if the damages are based on improper considerations or lack of evidence.

Option F suggests she can only collect for past work, not future as an apprentice. But lost earning capacity does include future losses, so this seems incorrect.

Option G states that some imprecision is expected and isn't grounds for excluding evidence. This aligns with the idea that while the future isn't certain, some estimation is permissible.

So the correct answer would be G because the court allows for some uncertainty in proving future earning capacity. The evidence provided about her being a promising student supports a reasonable estimate, so the appellate court wouldn't reverse the verdict on those grounds.

The appellate court is unlikely to reverse the verdict because the evidence presented about the plaintiff's potential as a ballet dancer provided a sufficient basis for estimating lost earning capacity. While future success can't be guaranteed, the law allows for reasonable inferences and some degree of uncertainty. The trial court properly allowed the evidence, and the jury's award was based on a reasonable estimation rather than mere speculation. Therefore, the appellate court would likely affirm the verdict.

G: No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.

Answer: G
