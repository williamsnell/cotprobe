Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about a gorilla climbing a tree and calculating the work done. Hmm, I remember that work has to do with force and distance. Right, the formula for work is Work = Force × Distance, as long as the force is applied in the direction of the distance. 

So the gorilla weighs 360 pounds, and it climbs to a height of 20 feet. Wait, weight is a force, so that must be the force here. So the force is 360 lb, and the distance is 20 feet. 

Wait a second, the problem also mentions that the gorilla reaches that height in 5 seconds. Oh, right, but work doesn't depend on time, does it? Because work is just force times distance. Power would be work done over time, but the question is asking for work, not power. So the 5 seconds might be a red herring here. Or maybe I'm missing something. 

Let me think. Work done against gravity when you lift something is mgh, right? But wait, here we're using pounds for weight, which is already a force (since 1 lb is the force due to gravity on a mass of 1 slug). So the formula would actually be Work = weight × height. So in this case, it's 360 lb * 20 ft. 

So 360 multiplied by 20. Let me calculate that. 360 * 20 is 7200. So the work done would be 7200 foot-pounds. 

Looking at the options, option F is 7200 ft-lb. So that's probably the correct answer. 

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes when problems mention time, they might be trying to trick you into using power. But no, the question clearly asks for work done, not power. So time isn't a factor here. 

Alternatively, if the problem had asked for average power, then we would calculate work done and divide by time. For example, 7200 ft-lb over 5 seconds would give 1440 ft-lb/s, but that's not what's being asked here. 

So yeah, I think the correct answer is F: 7200 ft-lb.

To determine the work done by the gorilla, we use the formula for work: 

\[
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
\]

Here, the force is the gorilla's weight, which is \(360 \, \mathrm{lb}\), and the distance is the height climbed, \(20 \, \mathrm{ft}\). Thus, the work done is:

\[
\text{Work} = 360 \, \mathrm{lb} \times 20 \, \mathrm{ft} = 7200 \, \mathrm{ft-lb}
\]

The time taken (5 seconds) is not relevant to the calculation of work, as work depends only on force and distance, not on the time taken to perform the work. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: 7200 ft-lb**

Answer: F
