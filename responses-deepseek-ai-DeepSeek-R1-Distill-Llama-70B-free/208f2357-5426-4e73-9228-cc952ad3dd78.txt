Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the UK Constitution, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about the UK's constitutional setup.

First, I remember that the UK doesn't have a single, written constitution like the United States. Instead, its constitution is made up of various documents, laws, and conventions. So it's uncodified, meaning it's not all in one place. That probably relates to one of the options.

Looking at the options, option B says the UK Constitution is codified and in a single document. That doesn't sound right because I remember the UK's is uncodified. So B is probably incorrect.

Option H says it's uncodified and found in multiple sources. That aligns with what I was thinking. So H might be the correct answer.

Let me go through the other options to make sure. Option A says it's a copy of the US Constitution. No, the US has a written constitution with separation of powers, while the UK's is different, so A is wrong.

Option C claims it can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. Wait, the UK's constitution is flexible, so most changes can be done by a simple majority. But are there exceptions? Like maybe some things require a supermajority or referendums? I'm not entirely sure, but I think generally, it's a simple majority, so C could be a contender.

Option D states the judiciary can overturn acts of Parliament. That's not right because the UK follows parliamentary sovereignty. The courts can't overturn laws passed by Parliament, unless it's related to EU law, but even then, that's more about interpretation. So D is incorrect.

Option E mentions a Bill of Rights. The UK does have the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights, but the Constitution itself isn't based on a Bill of Rights like the US. So E is not correct.

Option F: Power derived solely from Parliament. Hmm, the UK's constitution is based on the sovereignty of Parliament, so that's a key feature. But option H is about the structure being uncodified, which is more about form than derivation of power. So F might be correct, but I think the question is about the nature of the constitution, not the source of power.

Option G says based on EU law. Now that the UK has Brexit, this is less relevant, and even before, the EU law was part of the legal system but not the basis of the constitution. So G is wrong.

Option I: Power only from the sovereign. No, the UK's system has the sovereign (monarch) as a part, but the actual power comes from Parliament through the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Based solely on common law. While common law is a significant part, the constitution also includes statutes and conventions, so J is too narrow.

So the main contenders are options C, F, and H. The question is about describing the UK Constitution best. Option H describes the form (uncodified, multiple sources), which is a fundamental aspect. Option C talks about how it's changed, which is a characteristic but perhaps not the best overall description. Option F is about the source of power, which is also important but again, the question is asking for a description of the constitution itself.

So I think the best answer is H: The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.

The UK Constitution is best described as uncodified and can be found in a variety of sources, including statutes, conventions, and legal precedents. This reflects its flexible and evolving nature, unlike a codified constitution that exists in a single document.

Answer: H
