Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the dollar markup for a stereo system. Hmm, let me think about what I remember regarding markup. I think markup is the amount added to the cost price to get the selling price. So the formula should probably be something like selling price minus cost price equals markup. 

Wait, the question says the stereo sells for $200 and the cost to the store is $120. So the selling price is 200 and cost is 120. So to find the markup, I subtract the cost from the selling price. That would be 200 minus 120, which equals 80. So the markup is $80.

Let me double-check that. Markup is the difference between what the store sells it for and what they bought it for. So yes, 200 - 120 = 80. So the dollar markup is $80.

Looking at the options, option A is $80, so that must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward subtraction problem.

The dollar markup is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price. 

- Selling price = $200
- Cost price = $120
- Markup = $200 - $120 = $80

The correct answer is option A.
