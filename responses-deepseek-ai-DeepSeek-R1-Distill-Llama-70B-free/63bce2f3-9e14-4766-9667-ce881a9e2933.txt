Okay, so I've got this problem about methyl alcohol, CH3OH. The question is asking me to calculate the number of kilocalories required to convert one mole of methyl alcohol from a solid at -98°C to vapor at 65°C. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a substance changes state, like from solid to liquid or liquid to gas, it involves heat. So, this process probably has a few steps. Let me think about the phase changes involved.

Starting with solid methyl alcohol at -98°C. I need to heat it up to its freezing point, which is also -98°C. Wait, no, wait. The freezing point is the temperature where it solidifies, so if it's already a solid at -98, maybe I don't need to do anything there. Or wait, maybe I do. Oh, right, the process is heating the solid from its current temperature to the melting point, then melting it, then heating the liquid to the boiling point, then vaporizing it.

So the steps are:
1. Heating the solid from -98°C to the freezing point (which is also -98°C). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, the solid is already at the freezing point. So perhaps there's no temperature change needed here. So step 1 might be zero.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The solid is at -98°C, which is its freezing point. So to melt it, it's already at the melting point. So step 1 is just melting, step 2 is heating the liquid from the melting point to the boiling point, and step 3 is vaporizing it.

Wait, but no, wait. The solid is at its freezing point, so when you start, it's at the same temp as the freezing point. So you don't need to heat it to get to the melting point; it's already there. So the first step after that is melting, then heating the liquid, then vaporizing.

Wait, no, another approach: phase changes require heat even if the temperature isn't changing. So to convert solid to liquid, you add heat of fusion, and for liquid to gas, heat of vaporization. But also, when heating through the liquid phase, you need to account for the temperature change there.

So the process is:

1. Melt the solid at -98°C: this uses the heat of fusion.
2. Heat the liquid from -98°C to the boiling point of 65°C. So delta T is 65 - (-98) = 163°C.
3. Vaporize the liquid at 65°C: uses the heat of vaporization.

Now, I need to calculate the heat for each step and sum them up.

But wait, I need to remember that all the values given are per gram. And the question is about one mole. So I need to find the molar values, which means I have to multiply by the molar mass of methyl alcohol.

First, find the molar mass of CH3OH. Let's calculate that. Carbon is 12 g/mol, hydrogen is 1, oxygen 16.

CH3OH: C=12, H3=3*1=3, O=16, H=1. So total is 12 + 3 + 16 + 1 = 32 g/mol.

So the molar mass is 32 g/mol.

Now, the specific heat is given as 0.570 cal/g°C for the liquid. Heat of fusion is 22.0 cal/g, and heat of vaporization is 263 cal/g.

So let's compute each step.

Step 1: Melt the solid (heat of fusion).
Heat = moles * molar mass * heat of fusion.
Wait, no. Heat of fusion is in cal per gram. So for one mole, which is 32 grams, the heat is 32 g * 22 cal/g = 704 cal.

Step 2: Heat the liquid from -98°C to 65°C.
Delta T is 65 - (-98) = 163°C.
Heat = mass * specific heat * delta T.
Again, mass is 32 g. Specific heat is 0.570 cal/g°C.
So 32 g * 0.570 cal/g°C * 163°C.
Let me compute that.

32 * 0.570 = 18.24.
18.24 * 163 = Let's see. 18 * 160 is 2880. 18 *3=54. 0.24 * 160=38.4, 0.24*3=0.72. So 2880 +54=2934, +38.4=2972.4, +0.72=2973.12 cal.

Wait, wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, 32 * 0.570 = 18.24 cal/°C.

18.24 * 163 = ?

18.24 * 160 = 2918.4
18.24 * 3 = 54.72
Total = 2918.4 + 54.72 = 2973.12 cal.

Step 3: Vaporize the liquid.
Heat = mass * heat of vaporization.
32 g * 263 cal/g = 84096 cal? Wait, wait, 32 *263.

Wait, 263 *30 is 7890, and 263 *2 is 526. So 7890 +526 = 8416 cal.

Wait, 263 *32: 263*30=7890, 263*2=526, total 8416.

So total heat is sum of steps 1,2,3.

Step 1: 704 cal.

Step 2: 2973.12 cal.

Step 3: 8416 cal.

Total = 704 + 2973.12 + 8416 = ?

704 + 2973.12 = 3677.12.

3677.12 + 8416 = 12093.12 cal.

Convert to kilocalories: 12093.12 cal = 12.09312 Kcal.

Wait, but the options don't have 12.09 exactly. Let me check the options:

Options are A:15.22, B:14.09, etc.

Wait, option C is 12.09, E is 11.09, J is 13.00.

So 12.09 is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistake in the calculations? Let me double-check.

Molar mass calculation: CH3OH. C=12, H3=3, O=16, H=1. Total = 12+3+16+1=32 g/mol. Correct.

Step 1: 32g *22 cal/g = 704 cal. Correct.

Step 2: 32 *0.570 =18.24; 18.24 *163.

Wait, 18.24 *160 = 2918.4, 18.24 *3=54.72; total 2973.12. Correct.

Step3:32 *263=8416. Correct.

Total: 704 + 2973.12 = 3677.12; +8416 = 12093.12 cal.

1 kcal = 1000 cal, so 12093.12 cal = 12.09312 kcal, which rounds to approximately 12.09 kcal. So that's option C.

But wait, let me look at the options again. Option C is 12.09 Kcal.

Wait, but wait. Did I forget to account for heating the solid from its initial temperature to the melting point? Oh wait, in this case, the initial temperature is the same as the freezing point. So the solid is already at -98°C. So no, that step (heating the solid) isn't needed because the temperature doesn't change. So the first step is just the heat of fusion.

Wait, but another thought: the heat of fusion is the amount of heat per gram to melt the solid at its melting point. Since the solid is at the melting point, you don't need to heat it to get to the melting point. So only the heat of fusion is needed for that step.

So I think the calculation is correct.

To calculate the number of kilocalories required to convert one mole of methyl alcohol (CH₃OH) solid at -98°C to vapor at 65°C, the process involves three steps:

1. **Melting the solid (heat of fusion):**  
   The heat required to melt the solid is calculated using the heat of fusion (22.0 cal/g). For one mole of CH₃OH (molar mass = 32 g/mol):  
   \[
   \text{Heat} = 32 \, \text{g} \times 22.0 \, \text{cal/g} = 704 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

2. **Heating the liquid from -98°C to 65°C:**  
   The temperature change is \( \Delta T = 65 - (-98) = 163^\circ \text{C} \). Using the specific heat of the liquid (0.570 cal/g°C):  
   \[
   \text{Heat} = 32 \, \text{g} \times 0.570 \, \text{cal/g°C} \times 163^\circ \text{C} = 2973.12 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

3. **Vaporizing the liquid (heat of vaporization):**  
   The heat required to vaporize the liquid is calculated using the heat of vaporization (263 cal/g). For one mole of CH₃OH:  
   \[
   \text{Heat} = 32 \, \text{g} \times 263 \, \text{cal/g} = 8416 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

**Total heat required:**  
\[
\text{Total Heat} = 704 \, \text{cal} + 2973.12 \, \text{cal} + 8416 \, \text{cal} = 12093.12 \, \text{cal}.
\]

Convert to kilocalories:  
\[
12093.12 \, \text{cal} = 12.09312 \, \text{kcal} \approx 12.09 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

From the given options, the closest match is **12.09 Kcal**, which corresponds to option **C**.
