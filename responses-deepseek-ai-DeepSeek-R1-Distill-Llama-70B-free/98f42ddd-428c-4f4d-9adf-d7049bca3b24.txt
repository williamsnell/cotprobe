Okay, so I have this question about calculating the Boyle temperature of chlorine using the van der Waals parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Wait, I remember that the Boyle temperature is the temperature at which a real gas behaves like an ideal gas over a considerable range of pressures. And it's calculated using the van der Waals constants for the gas, right?

The formula for the Boyle temperature, T_B, is T_B = (a) / (R*b), where a and b are the van der Waals constants. Oh wait, R is the gas constant. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So I need the values of a and b for chlorine. I'm not exactly sure what they are off the top of my head, but I think they're tabulated somewhere. Oh wait, I might have come across them before. Let me try to recall.

I remember that for chlorine, the van der Waals 'a' is something like 6.579 atm·L²/mol², and 'b' is around 0.05622 L/mol. I'm not 100% confident about these numbers, but let's go with them for now.

Wait, wait, R is the gas constant, which is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), if I'm not mistaken. Right, because when using units with atmosphere, that's the value to use.

So plugging into the formula: T_B = a/(R*b) = (6.579) / (0.0821 * 0.05622).

Let me compute the denominator first. 0.0821 multiplied by 0.05622. Let me calculate that.

0.0821 * 0.05 is 0.004105. And 0.0821 * 0.00622 would be about 0.000510. Adding those, approximately 0.004615. So the denominator is about 0.004615.

Now, the numerator is 6.579. So T_B = 6.579 / 0.004615 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division. 6.579 divided by 0.004615.

Hmm, let's see. Let me approximate this. 0.004615 times 1000 is 4.615. So 6.579 divided by 0.004615 is about 6.579 / 0.004615 ≈ 1425 K?

Wait, that seems high. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 0.0821 * 0.05622. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.0821 * 0.05622:

Let me compute 0.08 * 0.05622 = 0.0044976. Then 0.0021 * 0.05622 = 0.000118062. Add them together: 0.0044976 + 0.000118062 = 0.004615662.

So the denominator is approximately 0.0046157.

Now, 6.579 divided by 0.0046157.

Let me think, 0.0046157 times 1420 is about 6.551. Because 1420 * 0.0046157 = (1400 * 0.0046157) + (20 * 0.0046157). Let's compute 1400 * 0.0046157: 1400 * 0.004 is 5.6, and 1400 * 0.0006157 is approximately 0.8618. So total around 6.4618. Then 20 * 0.0046157 is 0.0923. So 6.4618 + 0.0923 = ~6.5541. So 1420 * denominator is approximately 6.5541, which is close to the numerator 6.579. So the approximate T_B is around 1420 K.

Wait, but chlorine is a diatomic gas, right? But I don't think that affects the calculation here. The van der Waals constants are already for Cl2, I suppose.

Wait, looking at the answer options, the options are all around 1.0e3 to 1.75e3 K. Oh wait, wait, 1420 K is 1.42e3 K. So looking at the options, option C is 1.41e3 K, which is very close to my calculation.

So the correct answer should be C. But let me just make sure I didn't mix up a and b. Wait, the formula is a/(R*b). Oh yes, a is in atm L²/mol², R is in L atm/(mol K), and b is in L/mol. So when you multiply R and b, the units are (L atm/mol K) * (L/mol) )= L² atm / (mol² K). Then a/(Rb) becomes (atm L²/mol²) / (L² atm/mol² K) )= K. So the units are correct.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I should double-check the van der Waals constants for Cl2. Let me think: Oh, another way to get the values is to look up the critical temperature. Because I remember that for van der Waals, the critical temperature T_c is (8a)/(27Rb). So if I can find the critical temperature, I can maybe find a relation.

But I don't remember the critical temperature of Cl2 off the top of my head. Alternatively, I can think about whether I swapped a and b. Wait, no, because a is associated with the attraction parameter, and b with the volume exclusion. So no, the formula is correct.

Wait, just to be absolutely sure, let me recheck the calculation numerically.

a = 6.579 atm L²/mol²
b = 0.05622 L/mol
R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

Denominator: R*b = 0.0821 * 0.05622 = ?

0.08 * 0.05622 = 0.0044976
0.0021 * 0.05622 = 0.000118062
Adding gives 0.004615662 L²·atm/(mol²·K)

So T_B = 6.579 / 0.004615662 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division precisely.

Compute 6.579 / 0.004615662.

Hmm, 0.004615662 * 1420 = ?

0.004615662 * 1400 = let's compute 0.004615662 *1000 =4.615662, times 1.4 gives 6.461529.

0.004615662 * 20 = 0.09231324.

Adding those, 6.461529 +0.09231324=6.553842.

Which is just a bit less than 6.579. So 1420 K gives 6.5538, which is 6.579-6.5538=0.0252 less.

So how much more do I need?

The difference is 0.0252, so I can compute how much more to add to 1420.

Each additional 1 K would add 0.004615662 to the product.

So 0.0252 / 0.004615662 ≈ 5.46.

So approximately 1420 +5.46=1425.46 K.

Wait, wait, no. Because T_B = a/(Rb) = numerator / denominator. So if denominator * T_B = a, then if denominator * 1420 is 6.5538, which is less than a=6.579, the actual T_B is a bit higher than 1420.

So 1420 gives 6.5538, which is 6.579 -6.5538=0.0252 less than a.

So how much more T do we need?

Each 1 K increase in T adds 0.004615662 per T. So to get 0.0252 more, we need 0.0252 / 0.004615662 = approx 5.46.

So T_B = 1420 +5.46 ≈ 1425.46 K. So about 1.425e3 K.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1.41e3 K, which is 1410 K. Hmm, that's a bit lower than my calculation. But wait, perhaps my initial a and b values are slightly off.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise values for a and b. Let me check my initial values.

Wait, I think the van der Waals constants for Cl2 are a=6.579 atm L²/mol² and b=0.05622 L/mol. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise multiplication for R*b.

Let me compute R*b more accurately.

R=0.082057 (exact value, but I'll use more decimals).

b=0.05622 L/mol.

So 0.082057 * 0.05622.

Compute 0.08 * 0.05622 = 0.0044976.

0.002057 * 0.05622.

Wait, 0.002 * 0.05622 is 0.00011244.

0.000057 * 0.05622 ≈ 0.000003204.

Adding: 0.00011244 +0.000003204 = 0.000115644.

So total R*b is 0.0044976 + 0.000115644=0.004613244.

So using this more precise R*b, T_B = 6.579 / 0.004613244.

Compute 6.579 ÷ 0.004613244.

Well, let me compute 6.579 / 0.004613244.

We can write this as 6579 ÷ 4.613244 (after multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000).

Compute 6579 ÷ 4.613244.

Hmm, 4.613244 * 1425 = let's see.

Well, 4.613244 * 1400=6468.9416.

4.613244 *25=115.3311.

So 6468.9416 + 115.3311=6584.2727.

Wait, that's higher than 6579. So 4.613244 *1425=approx 6584.27, which is higher than 6579.

So let's try 1420: 4.613244 *1420=?

4.613244 *1400=6468.9416.

4.613244 *20=92.26488.

Total 6468.9416 +92.26488=6561.2065.

So 4.613244 *1420=6561.2065.

But our numerator is 6579, which is 6579-6561.2065=17.7935 higher.

So how much more T is needed beyond 1420?

Each 1 T gives 4.613244. So 17.7935 /4.613244≈3.855.

So T_B =1420+3.855≈1423.855 K.

So approximately 1424 K, which is 1.424e3 K.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.41e3 (1410), and option G is 1.33e3 (1330), which is lower. Option J is 1.50e3. So the closest option is C:1.41e3, but our calculation is about 1424 K, which is 1.424e3, which is close to 1.42e3, but the options don't have that exact. So perhaps the given options rounded differently.

Wait, perhaps using more precise a and b values would yield a slightly different result. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I used the correct R value.

Wait, R is 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K), which I used as approximately 0.0821. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, van der Waals constants are given in different units, like (dm³)² instead of L². Oh wait, 1 dm³ is 1 L, so that's the same. So no issue there.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Boyle temperature. Wait, yes, the formula is indeed T_B = a/(R*b). I think that's correct.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Boyle temperature is when the second virial coefficient B = 0. The second virial coefficient is B = b - a/(RT). Setting B=0 gives (b) = a/(RT_B), so T_B = a/(R b).

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So my calculation is about 1424 K. The closest option is C:1.41e3, which is 1410 K, a bit lower than what I calculated. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck my a and b values.

Wait, maybe I misremembered the van der Waals constants for Cl2. Let me think: for example, another source I recall, the a for Cl2 is about 6.579 atm L²/mol², and b is 0.05622 L/mol. Wait, but perhaps I should cross-verify.

Alternatively, perhaps the a is in units of Pa m³/mol² or something else, but no, in the van der Waals equation, when using R as 0.0821 L atm/mol K, the a would be in L² atm/mol², which I think is correct.

Wait, another approach: the critical temperature T_c for Cl2 is known, and T_c = (8a)/(27 R b). So if I can find T_c, I can find the ratio a/(R b) because T_B = (a)/(R b) = 3 T_c / 8. Because T_c = (8a)/(27 R b) => a/(R b) = (27 T_c)/(8 *8) )? Wait, wait, let me compute.

Wait, T_c = (8a)/(27 R b). So a/(R b) = (27 T_c)/(8 *8) ? No, wait:

Wait, T_c = (8a) / (27 R b)

So solving for a/(R b):

a/(R b) = (27 T_c R b) )/(8 R b) )? Hmm, perhaps a better approach.

Wait, from T_c = (8a)/(27 R b), we can write a/(R b) = (27 T_c)/(8 * R) * R? Wait, maybe it's easier to relate T_B and T_c.

We have T_B = a/(R b).

And T_c = (8a)/(27 R b) = (8/27) * (a/(R b)) = (8/27) T_B.

So T_B = (27/8) T_c.

So if I know the critical temperature of Cl2, I can compute T_B.

What's the critical temperature of chlorine? I think it's around 416.9 K. Let me see, I think Cl2 has a critical temperature of about 416.9 K.

So if T_c is 416.9 K, then T_B = (27/8) * 416.9 = ?

Compute 416.9 *27 = let's see: 400 *27=10,800, 16.9 *27≈456.3. So total ≈10,800 +456.3=11,256.3.

Divide by 8: 11,256.3 /8≈1,407 K.

Hmm, so using this method, T_B would be approximately 1,407 K, which is 1.407e3 K, close to option C:1.41e3 K.

Ah, so that makes sense. So earlier when I computed about 1424 K, perhaps the correct T_c is 416.9 K, leading to T_B=1407 K, which aligns with option C.

So I think the correct answer is option C: 1.41e3 K.
</think>

To calculate the Boyle temperature ($T_B$) of chlorine using the van der Waals parameters, the formula is:

\[
T_B = \frac{a}{R \cdot b}
\]

where:
- $a$ is the van der Waals attraction parameter,
- $b$ is the van der Waals volume exclusion parameter,
- $R$ is the gas constant.

### Given Values:
- $a = 6.579 \, \mathrm{atm \cdot L^2 / mol^2}$,
- $b = 0.05622 \, \mathrm{L / mol}$,
- $R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm / (mol \cdot K)}$.

### Calculation:
1. Compute the denominator $R \cdot b$:
   \[
   R \cdot b = 0.0821 \cdot 0.05622 = 0.004615662 \, \mathrm{L^2 \cdot atm / (mol^2 \cdot K)}.
   \]

2. Compute $T_B$:
   \[
   T_B = \frac{a}{R \cdot b} = \frac{6.579}{0.004615662} \approx 1424 \, \mathrm{K}.
   \]

### Refinement Using Critical Temperature:
The critical temperature ($T_c$) of chlorine is known to be approximately $416.9 \, \mathrm{K}$. The relationship between $T_B$ and $T_c$ is:

\[
T_B = \frac{27}{8} T_c.
\]

Substituting $T_c = 416.9 \, \mathrm{K}$:

\[
T_B = \frac{27}{8} \cdot 416.9 \approx 1407 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated Boyle temperature is approximately $1.41 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{K}$, which matches option **C**.
