Question:

A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.
B: inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.
C: admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.
D: admissible, because the original contract was lost.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's see... The scenario is about a buyer suing a seller over a contract related to a hot dog stand. The contract says the seller can't open another stand within two miles for two years. The buyer claims the seller violated this by opening one half a mile away. Now, the original contract is lost, and the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy. The seller objects, questioning the original's authenticity.

Hmm, I remember that when a document is lost, there are rules about using copies. The best evidence rule, right? I think the best evidence rule says that the original document is preferred, especially for contracts. But wait, are there exceptions when the original is lost or destroyed?

So, the best evidence rule, which is FRE 1002, states that to prove the content of a writing, you need the original unless reasons are shown why it's unavailable or unnecessary. But there's another rule, FRE 1004, which lists exceptions. One of those exceptions is if the original was lost or destroyed, provided it's not due to bad faith.

In this case, the original was lost before trial. So maybe the duplicate can be used under the lost document exception. But wait, the seller is objecting to the authenticity of the original. How does that affect things?

I think the buyer would need to provide some evidence that the original existed and was lost. Like, testifying that they had the contract, it was lost, and the copy is a true copy. If the seller objects, perhaps they don't believe the original ever existed or was genuine.

But the question is about admissibility. Even if the seller contests authenticity, the duplicate can still be admitted under the exception for lost originals. The duplicate's admissibility doesn't depend on the seller's agreement about the original's authenticity. The court can let the jury decide whether to believe the copy is authentic.

So, looking at the options:

A: Inadmissible because the seller contests authenticity. I don't think so. The objection to authenticity goes to the weight, not admissibility. The court allows the evidence, and then the jury decides if they believe it.

B: Inadmissible because best evidence requires original. No, because the original was lost, so the exception applies. Best evidence allows for a copy in this case.

C: Admissible because it's a carbon copy. Well, being a carbon copy might not be enough if the original isn't available. But if the loss is established, then it's okay.

D: Admissible because the original was lost. Yes, that aligns with the exception under FRE 1004.

Wait, but both C and D are about admissibility. The key is that the original was lost, making the duplicate admissible. So D would be the correct reason.

So the correct answer should be D.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a duplicate carbon copy of a lost contract under the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule generally requires the original document to prove the content of a writing. However, when the original is lost, Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 1004 provides an exception, allowing the use of a copy if the loss is not due to bad faith. 

In this scenario, the original contract was lost before trial, and the buyer seeks to introduce a duplicate carbon copy. The seller's objection pertains to the authenticity of the original contract, but this objection goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. The lost document exception applies here, making the duplicate admissible. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The seller's objection to authenticity does not render the evidence inadmissible; it affects the weight, not the admissibility.
- **B**: Incorrect. The best evidence rule allows for the use of a copy when the original is lost, as provided in FRE 1004.
- **C**: Incorrect. While the duplicate is a carbon copy, mere duplication does not guarantee admissibility without addressing the loss of the original.
- **D**: Correct. The duplicate is admissible because the original was lost, satisfying the exception under FRE 1004.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D
