Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the likelihood ratio test in the context of GARCH models. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

The question is about testing whether a GARCH(2,2) model can be restricted to a process with constant conditional variance. I remember that a GARCH(p,q) model has p lagged variance terms and q lagged squared return terms. So, a GARCH(2,2) would have two of each.

The null hypothesis here is that the model can be restricted. Restricting it to constant conditional variance would imply that the coefficients on the lagged variance and squared returns are zero. So, the unrestricted model is GARCH(2,2), and the restricted model is essentially a model where the variance is constant (like in the case of i.i.d. returns, where past variances don't affect the current one).

The question asks which statements are true. The options are A to D.

Starting with option A: The test statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom under the null. Wait, the likelihood ratio test statistic is usually chi-squared with degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions. In GARCH(2,2), the variance equation is:

σ²_t = α0 + α1 r_{t-1}^2 + α2 r_{t-2}^2 + β1 σ²_{t-1} + β2 σ²_{t-2}

The restricted model (constant variance) would set α1=α2=0 and β1=β2=0. So that's four restrictions. But wait, the constant variance model would have σ²_t = α0, so the only parameter is α0. The unrestricted model has more parameters: α0, α1, α2, β1, β2. So that's five parameters in the unrestricted, and one in the restricted. So the number of restrictions is 5-1=4. So the degrees of freedom for the chi-squared would be 4. But option A says 2. So A is incorrect.

Option B: The log-likelihood of the restricted model is bigger than the unrestricted. Wait, no. The log-likelihood function measures how well the model fits the data. The unrestricted model is more flexible and should fit better, meaning a higher log-likelihood (since it's more likely). But wait, the log-likelihood can be higher (less negative) or lower depending on the model. Oh wait, the unrestricted model has more parameters, so it should have a higher log-likelihood (less negative) than the restricted. So the restricted model's log-likelihood is lower (more negative). So option B says the restricted is bigger, which would mean less negative. That's not correct. So B is false.

Option C: The log-likelihood values are given as -112.3 (unrestricted) and -118.4 (restricted). The test statistic is 2*(L_unrestricted - L_restricted). Wait, no, the formula for the likelihood ratio test is usually 2*(log-likelihood of unrestricted - log-likelihood of restricted). Because the unrestricted model is more general. So with the numbers given: 2*(-112.3 - (-118.4)) = 2*(6.1) = 12.2. So option C says the test statistic is 12.2, which matches. So C is correct.

Option D: The test compares the slopes at the maximum and restricted parameters. Hmm, I'm not too sure. The likelihood ratio test is about the difference in log-likelihoods evaluated at the maximum of each model. So it's not about the slopes; it's about the log-likelihood values. So D is incorrect.

So the correct statements are option C. Are there any other correct ones? Let's double-check.

Wait, how many restrictions are there? The GARCH(2,2) has parameters alpha0, alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2. The restricted model (constant variance) only has alpha0. So the number of restrictions is 4 (setting alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2 to zero). So the degrees of freedom for the chi-square should be 4. So option A, which says df=2, is incorrect.

So the only correct option is C.

To determine which statements are true regarding the likelihood ratio test for restricting a GARCH(2,2) model to a process with constant conditional variance, let us analyze each option:

### Option A:
The test statistic for the likelihood ratio test follows a chi-squared distribution under the null hypothesis. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of restrictions imposed by the null hypothesis. In this case, the unrestricted GARCH(2,2) model has five parameters (α₀, α₁, α₂, β₁, β₂), while the restricted model (constant variance) has only one parameter (α₀). Thus, there are 4 restrictions, and the test statistic should follow a chi-squared distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. Since the option states 2 degrees of freedom, this is incorrect.

### Option B:
The log-likelihood function measures how well a model fits the data. The unrestricted model, being more flexible, should generally have a higher log-likelihood (less negative) than the restricted model. Therefore, the statement that the restricted model's log-likelihood is "almost always bigger" is false.

### Option C:
The likelihood ratio test statistic is calculated as:

\[
\text{Test Statistic} = 2 \cdot (\text{Log-Likelihood of Unrestricted Model} - \text{Log-Likelihood of Restricted Model})
\]

Given the log-likelihood values of -112.3 (unrestricted) and -118.4 (restricted), the test statistic is:

\[
2 \cdot (-112.3 - (-118.4)) = 2 \cdot 6.1 = 12.2
\]

This matches the value provided in the option, so this statement is correct.

### Option D:
The likelihood ratio test compares the log-likelihood values of the unrestricted and restricted models, not the slopes of the log-likelihood function. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only correct statement is **C**.
