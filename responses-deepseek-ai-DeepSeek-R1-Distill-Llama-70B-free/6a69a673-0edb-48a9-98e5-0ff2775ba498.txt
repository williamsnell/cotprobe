Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve. The question is asking for the limit as x approaches 1 of (x - 1) multiplied by sin(π divided by (x - 1)). Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially those that result in indeterminate forms like 0/0 or infinity times zero, L'Hospital's Rule might come in handy. But wait, let me see what happens when I substitute x = 1 directly. 

If x approaches 1, then (x-1) approaches zero. So the first part of the product is going to zero. But what about the sine part? Let's look at sin(π/(x-1)). As x approaches 1, the denominator (x-1) approaches zero, so π/(x-1) becomes very large in magnitude. That means the argument inside the sine function is oscillating wildly between large positive and negative values. So the sine of that would oscillate between -1 and 1. 

So putting it together, we have a term approaching zero multiplied by a term that's oscillating between -1 and 1. This makes me think of the classic "0 times infinity" indeterminate form, but in this case, it's more like 0 times bounded oscillation. I remember that when you have something like 0 multiplied by a bounded function, the limit might be zero, but I need to be careful here.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can rewrite the expression to make it easier to analyze. Let me set t = x - 1. Then as x approaches 1, t approaches 0. So substituting, the limit becomes the limit as t approaches 0 of t * sin(π/t).

So now the expression is t * sin(π/t). Now, I know that as t approaches zero, sin(π/t) oscillates rapidly between -1 and 1. The factor t is approaching zero. So the product is a small number (approaching zero) times a bounded oscillating function. 

I recall that if you have a function that's bounded multiplied by a function approaching zero, the product approaches zero. Because the oscillations become negligible as the factor t goes to zero. So in this case, t * sin(π/t) should approach zero.

Wait, but am I sure about that? Let me think about the squeeze theorem. The sine function is always between -1 and 1. So sin(π/t) is between -1 and 1. So t*sin(π/t) is between -t and t. As t approaches zero, both -t and t approach zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit must be zero.

So that should mean the limit is zero, which is option B. Let me double-check to see if I missed anything. Another thought: sometimes oscillatory functions can lead to the limit not existing, especially if they don't dampen out. But in this case, the amplitude is controlled by t, which is going to zero. So the oscillations are getting smaller and smaller in amplitude. So yeah, the limit should be zero.

I don't think I need to apply L'Hospital's Rule here because the expression isn't in a 0/0 or infinity/infinity form. It's more of a direct evaluation once I substitute t = x -1.

So I think the correct answer is B, 0.

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{x \to 1} ((x - 1) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x - 1}\right))\), we begin by analyzing the behavior of the function as \(x\) approaches 1.

1. **Substitution**: Let \(t = x - 1\). As \(x \to 1\), \(t \to 0\). The limit becomes:
   \[
   \lim_{t \to 0} t \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{t}\right).
   \]

2. **Behavior of Components**:
   - The term \(t\) approaches 0.
   - The argument of the sine function, \(\frac{\pi}{t}\), becomes very large in magnitude as \(t \to 0\), causing \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{t}\right)\) to oscillate rapidly between \(-1\) and \(1\).

3. **Bounded Oscillation**: Since \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{t}\right)\) is bounded between \(-1\) and \(1\), the product \(t \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{t}\right)\) is bounded between \(-t\) and \(t\). As \(t \to 0\), both \(-t\) and \(t\) approach 0.

4. **Squeeze Theorem**: By the squeeze theorem, the limit of \(t \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{t}\right)\) as \(t \to 0\) is 0.

Thus, the limit is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
