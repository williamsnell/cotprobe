Question:

The capital structure of Merritt Co. is 20% common equity and debt equal to 80%. The cost of common equity is 10% and the pretax cost of debt is 5%. Merritt's tax rate is 21%. What is Merritt's weighted-average cost of capital?

B: 8.00%
C: 7.50%
D: 7.80%
E: 6.00%
F: 6.50%
G: 7.20%
H: 5.80%
I: 4.50%
J: 6.98%

Okay, so I have this question about calculating the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) for Merritt Co. Hmm, I remember that WACC is the average rate a company is expected to pay to all its security holders to finance its assets. It's calculated by weighting the cost of each capital component (like equity and debt) by its proportionate value in the total capital structure.

So, the capital structure given is 20% common equity and 80% debt. That means for every dollar Merritt has, 20 cents are from equity and 80 cents from debt.

Wait, but wait. I think the cost of debt is given as a pretax figure, right? Because interest on debt is tax-deductible. So I need to account for the tax shield here. Oh right, the formula for WACC considers the after-tax cost of debt. So the cost of debt is (pretax cost) * (1 - tax rate).

Given values:
- Cost of common equity (Re) = 10% or 0.10
- Pretax cost of debt (Rd) = 5% or 0.05
- Tax rate (Tc) = 21% or 0.21

So the after-tax cost of debt would be Rd*(1 - Tc) = 0.05*(1 - 0.21) = 0.05 * 0.79 = 0.0395 or 3.95%.

Now, the weights are 20% equity and 80% debt. So the WACC is (weight of equity * Re) + (weight of debt * after-tax Rd).

Let me compute each part:
- Equity part: 0.20 * 0.10 = 0.02
- Debt part: 0.80 * 0.0395 = 0.0316

Adding them together: 0.02 + 0.0316 = 0.0516, which is 5.16%.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.16%. So the answer should be A.

To calculate Merritt Co.'s weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), we use the formula:

\[
\text{WACC} = (w_e \times R_e) + (w_d \times R_d \times (1 - T_c))
\]

Where:
- \( w_e \) = weight of equity = 20% = 0.20
- \( R_e \) = cost of equity = 10% = 0.10
- \( w_d \) = weight of debt = 80% = 0.80
- \( R_d \) = pretax cost of debt = 5% = 0.05
- \( T_c \) = tax rate = 21% = 0.21

First, calculate the after-tax cost of debt:

\[
\text{After-tax cost of debt} = R_d \times (1 - T_c) = 0.05 \times (1 - 0.21) = 0.05 \times 0.79 = 0.0395 \, \text{or} \, 3.95\%.
\]

Next, compute the WACC:

\[
\text{WACC} = (0.20 \times 0.10) + (0.80 \times 0.0395) = 0.02 + 0.0316 = 0.0516 \, \text{or} \, 5.16\%.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: 5.16%**
