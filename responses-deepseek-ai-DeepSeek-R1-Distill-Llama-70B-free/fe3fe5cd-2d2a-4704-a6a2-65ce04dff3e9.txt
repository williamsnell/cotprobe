Okay, so I've got this Laplace transform problem here. The question is asking me to find the Laplace transform of f(t) = t squared. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

I remember that the Laplace transform of a function f(t) is given by the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) f(t) dt. So for f(t) = t², the Laplace transform F(s) should be the integral from 0 to ∞ of e^(-st) t² dt.

Wait, what's the general formula for the Laplace transform of t^n? Oh right, I think it's something like n! divided by s raised to (n+1). Or wait, maybe it's (n factorial) times s to the negative (n+1) power. Let me think. So for n=0, it's 1/s. For n=1, like t, it's 1/s squared. For n=2, t squared, it should be 2! over s cubed. Oh wait, 2 factorial is 2, so 2/s³.

But wait, I'm getting confused because sometimes I see it written in different ways. Let me make sure. The Laplace transform of t^n is n! s^(-n-1), right? So yes, for n=2, t², that becomes 2! s^(-3), which is 2/s³.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2/s⁴, which doesn't fit. Option B is 1/s³, which is less than what I have. Option E is 2/s³—oh wait, that matches what I calculated. So the answer should be E.

But wait, just to double-check, maybe I should compute the integral manually. Let's see. The integral of e^(-st) t² dt from 0 to infinity.

I can use integration by parts. Let me set u = t², dv = e^(-st) dt. Then du = 2t dt, and v = (-1/s) e^(-st).

Integration by parts formula is uv - ∫ v du. So that's (-t² e^(-st))/s evaluated from 0 to ∞ minus ∫ (-1/s) e^(-st) * 2t dt.

At t approaching infinity, e^(-st) tends to zero, assuming s is positive, so the first term becomes 0 minus 0. Then the second term becomes (2/s) ∫ t e^(-st) dt.

Now I have another integral: ∫ t e^(-st) dt from 0 to ∞. I can apply integration by parts again. Let u = t, dv = e^(-st) dt. Then du = dt, v = (-1/s) e^(-st).

So this integral becomes (-t e^(-st))/s evaluated from 0 to ∞ minus ∫ (-1/s) e^(-st) dt.

Again, the first term evaluates to 0 at both limits. The integral becomes (1/s) ∫ e^(-st) dt, which is (1/s)(-1/s) e^(-st) evaluated from 0 to ∞. At t=∞, it's 0; at t=0, it's -1/s². So the integral becomes (1/s)(0 - (-1/s²)) )= 1/s³.

Wait, so putting it all together: the original integral was (2/s) times this new integral, which is 1/s³. So (2/s) * (1/s³) = 2/s⁴? Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait no, let me retrace.

Wait, no, the first step after the first integration by parts gave (2/s) times the integral of t e^(-st) dt, which we found to be 1/s². So wait, (2/s) * (1/s²) = 2/s³. Oh, right, so that gives 2/s³. So F(s) is 2/s³. That matches option E.

Okay, so I think I confused myself a bit, but in the end, it's 2/s³. So the correct answer is E.

To find the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = t^2 \), we use the definition of the Laplace transform:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) \, dt.
\]

For \( f(t) = t^2 \), this becomes:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t^2\} = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} t^2 \, dt.
\]

The Laplace transform of \( t^n \) is given by the formula:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t^n\} = \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}.
\]

Here, \( n = 2 \), so:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t^2\} = \frac{2!}{s^{2+1}} = \frac{2}{s^3}.
\]

This matches option **E**. To confirm, the integral was computed manually using integration by parts, and the result was consistent with the formula. Therefore, the Laplace transform of \( t^2 \) is \( \frac{2}{s^3} \).
