Alright, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these truth tables and argument validity. Let's take it step by step.

The problem is to construct a complete truth table for the given argument and then determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.

The argument given is:
P ⊃ Q
Q · R
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~P · R

Wait, no, looking again, the premises are P implies Q, and Q and R. The conclusion is ~P and R. Hmm, no, actually, looking closely, the second premise is written as Q · R, which is Q and R. And the conclusion is ~P · R, which is not P and R. So the argument is:

Premise 1: P → Q
Premise 2: Q ∧ R
Conclusion: ~P ∧ R

I think I should represent this in logical terms. The argument is:

1. P → Q
2. Q ∧ R
∴ ~P ∧ R

Wait, but how can that be? Let me make sure I parse it correctly. The original problem says: P ⊃ Q, Q · R, so maybe the premises are P→Q and Q∧R, and the conclusion is ~P ∧ R. That makes sense.

So, the first step is to construct a truth table that includes all possible truth values for P, Q, R, and then compute the truth values for each premise and the conclusion.

There are three variables, so 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

Let me list them out:

1. P=T, Q=T, R=T
2. P=T, Q=T, R=F
3. P=T, Q=F, R=T
4. P=T, Q=F, R=F
5. P=F, Q=T, R=T
6. P=F, Q=T, R=F
7. P=F, Q=F, R=T
8. P=F, Q=F, R=F

Now, for each row, I'll compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

Let's start with row 1: P=T, Q=T, R=T

- P→Q: T→T is T
- Q∧R: T∧T is T
- So both premises are true.
- Now, conclusion: ~P ∧ R → F ∧ T → F. So conclusion is F.

Row 2: P=T, Q=T, R=F

- P→Q: T→T → T
- Q∧R: T∧F → F
- So premise 2 is false, so the argument's premises are not both true here. Since in a valid argument, whenever all premises are true, the conclusion must be true. So if any premise is false, it doesn't affect the validity check for that row. So the conclusion here is ~P ∧ R → F ∧ F → F.

Row3: P=T, Q=F, R=T

- P→Q: T→F → F. So premise 1 is false. So this row doesn't satisfy all premises being true, so we can ignore it for validity.

Row4: P=T, Q=F, R=F

- P→Q: T→F → F. So premise 1 is false. Ignore.

Row5: P=F, Q=T, R=T

- P→Q: F→T → T
- Q∧R: T∧T → T
- Both premises are true. Now, conclusion: ~P ∧ R → T ∧ T → T.

Row6: P=F, Q=T, R=F

- P→Q: T
- Q∧R: F
- So premise 2 is false. Ignore.

Row7: P=F, Q=F, R=T

- P→Q: F→F → T (Wait, no, F→F is T. Because the only time an implication is false is when the antecedent is T and consequent is F. So F→F is T.
- Q∧R: F∧T → F. So premise 2 is F. So ignore.

Row8: P=F, Q=F, R=F

- P→Q: F→F → T
- Q∧R: F∧F → F. So premise 2 is F. Ignore.

So from the truth table, the only rows where both premises are true are rows 1,2,5.

Wait, no, row 1: premises are T and T. Row2: premise1 T, premise2 F. Row5: premise1 T, premise2 T.

Wait, no, let me re-examine:

Row1: P=T, Q=T, R=T → premises P→Q is T, Q∧R is T. So both premises are T.

Row2: P=T, Q=T, R=F → premise1 T, premise2 F.

Row5: P=F, Q=T, R=T → premise1 T (because F implies anything is T), premise2 T.

So in rows 1 and 5, both premises are true.

In row1, conclusion is F.

In row5, conclusion is T.

So, in row1, both premises are true, and conclusion is false. So this would make the argument invalid because there's a case where premises are true but conclusion is false.

Wait, but let me double-check: in row1, P is T, Q is T, R is T.

Conclusion is ~P ∧ R → F ∧ T → F.

So yes, in row1, both premises are true, but conclusion is false. So that's a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

Therefore, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when P is true, Q is true, R is true. Because that makes both premises true, but the conclusion false.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: Valid

B: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false, R true, Q false.

C: Invalid. When P and R are true, Q false.

D: P false, Q true, R false.

E: All false.

F: R and Q true, P false.

G: P and Q true, R false.

H: P, R, Q all true.

I: P true, R false, Q true.

J: Valid.

So the counterexample I found is when P is T, Q T, R T. That's row1.

Looking at the options, option H says when P, R, Q are all true. So that's exactly the case I found.

So the correct answer would be option H, which states that the argument is invalid with a counterexample when P, R, and Q are all true.

Wait, but let me double-check my analysis.

In row1: P=T, Q=T, R=T.

Premise1: T→T is T.

Premise2: Q∧R is T.

Conclusion: ~P ∧ R → F ∧ T is F.

So yes, the premises are true, conclusion is false. So the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when all P, Q, R are true.

Looking at the options, option H says: "Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and Q are true."

So the answer should be option H.

Wait, but let me look at the options again to make sure.

Option H says: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and Q are true. Yes.

But wait, let me check if there are any other counterexamples. Because sometimes there might be more than one.

Looking at row5: P=F, Q=T, R=T.

Premise1: T.

Premise2: T.

Conclusion: ~P ∧ R → T ∧ T → T. So here, conclusion is true. So that's fine.

Any other rows where premises are true? Let's see.

Wait, in row5, the premises are true and the conclusion is true. So that's good.

In row1, premises true, conclusion false. So that's the only counterexample.

So the answer is option H.

To determine the validity of the argument:

**Argument:**
1. \( P \rightarrow Q \)
2. \( Q \land R \)
\[
\therefore \neg P \land R
\]

### Truth Table Analysis

We construct a truth table for all possible combinations of \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) (8 rows). For each row, we evaluate the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

| Row | \( P \) | \( Q \) | \( R \) | \( P \rightarrow Q \) | \( Q \land R \) | \( \neg P \land R \) |
|-----|---------|---------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| 1   | T       | T       | T       | T                     | T               | F                     |
| 2   | T       | T       | F       | T                     | F               | F                     |
| 3   | T       | F       | T       | F                     | F               | F                     |
| 4   | T       | F       | F       | F                     | F               | F                     |
| 5   | F       | T       | T       | T                     | T               | T                     |
| 6   | F       | T       | F       | T                     | F               | F                     |
| 7   | F       | F       | T       | T                     | F               | F                     |
| 8   | F       | F       | F       | T                     | F               | F                     |

### Key Observations
- The argument is valid if, in all rows where both premises (\( P \rightarrow Q \) and \( Q \land R \)) are true, the conclusion (\( \neg P \land R \)) is also true.
- From the truth table:
  - **Row 1**: \( P = T \), \( Q = T \), \( R = T \). Both premises are true, but the conclusion is false (\( \neg P \land R = F \)). This is a counterexample.
  - **Row 5**: \( P = F \), \( Q = T \), \( R = T \). Both premises are true, and the conclusion is true (\( \neg P \land R = T \)). This row does not invalidate the argument.

### Conclusion
The argument is **invalid** because there is at least one counterexample (Row 1) where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Specifically, the counterexample occurs when \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) are all true.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**H: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and Q are true.**

Answer: H
