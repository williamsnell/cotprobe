Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about chili peppers, and I need to figure out which one isn't a type. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I'll list out all the options provided: A to J, each being a different name. The question is asking which one is NOT a chili pepper. So I need to go through each option and see if I recognize them as actual chili peppers.

Starting with option A: Cheyenne. I'm pretty sure Cheyenne is a type of chili pepper. I remember hearing it's a medium-hot variety, sometimes used in sauces.

Option B: Habanero. Oh yeah, habaneros are definitely chili peppers. They're known for being very hot, one of the spicier ones, often used in hot sauces.

Option C: Guajillo. Guajillo peppers are a type of chili pepper commonly used in Mexican cuisine, especially for making sauces. They have a mild to medium heat.

Option D: Ghost pepper. Ghost peppers, also known as Bhut Jolokia, are infamous for their intense heat. They're definitely a type of chili pepper, one of the hottest.

Option E: Serrano. Serrano peppers are a common type, used fresh in salsas and other dishes. They're hotter than jalapeños but not as hot as habaneros.

Option F: Pimiento. Hmm, pimientos are sweet peppers, right? They're not spicy. Wait, but are they considered chili peppers? I think technically they belong to the same family, but they're sweet and not hot. So maybe this is the one that's not a chili pepper in the traditional sense.

Option G: Poinsettia. Wait, poinsettia is a plant, but it's a flower, isn't it? It's the plant with red leaves around Christmas. I don't think it's a type of chili pepper. That's probably the answer.

Option H: Apache. Apache is a type of chili pepper, I believe. It's a hot variety, maybe similar to the Thai chili.

Option I: Poblano. Poblanos are definitely chili peppers. They're the ones used to make chile rellenos when stuffed, and when dried, they're called ancho or mulato.

Option J: Jalapero. Wait, isn't it jalapeño? Maybe that's a typo. Jalapeño is definitely a common chili pepper. So if the option is spelled Jalapero, perhaps it's a typo, but I think it's still referring to the same thing.

Wait, looking back, the options are: 

A: cheyenne
B: habanero
C: guajillo
D: ghost pepper
E: serrano
F: pimiento
G: poinsettia
H: apache
I: poblano
J: jalapero

So J is jalapero, which I believe is a misspelling of jalapeño. But regardless, whether it's a typo or not, jalapeño is a chili pepper, so J is a type.

So the options that are not chili peppers would be either F or G. Because pimiento is a sweet pepper, but still a type of Capsicum, so technically a chili pepper. Wait, but the question is which is NOT a type of chili pepper.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing. So, poinsettia is not a pepper at all. It's a different plant, Euphorbia pulcherrima, known for its red leaves. So G: poinsettia is definitely not a chili pepper. 

Pimiento is a sweet pepper, but it's part of the Capsicum genus, which includes all chili peppers and sweet peppers. So while it's not spicy, it's still a type of chili pepper in the broader sense.

So the answer should be G: poinsettia.

The question asks which of the listed options is not a type of chili pepper. Let’s analyze each option:

- **A: Cheyenne** - This is a type of chili pepper, known for its medium heat.
- **B: Habanero** - A well-known, very hot chili pepper.
- **C: Guajillo** - A mild to medium-hot chili pepper commonly used in Mexican cuisine.
- **D: Ghost pepper** - One of the hottest chili peppers, also known as Bhut Jolokia.
- **E: Serrano** - A common, hot chili pepper used in salsas.
- **F: Pimiento** - While not spicy, pimientos are technically a type of sweet pepper under the Capsicum genus, which includes chili peppers.
- **G: Poinsettia** - This is not a chili pepper; it’s a flowering plant (Euphorbia pulcherrima), often associated with Christmas decorations.
- **H: Apache** - A hot chili pepper variety.
- **I: Poblano** - A mild chili pepper, often used in dishes like chile rellenos.
- **J: Jalapero** - Likely a misspelling of "jalapeño," which is a common chili pepper.

The only option that is not a chili pepper is **G: Poinsettia**, as it belongs to a completely different plant genus and is not related to chili peppers.

**Answer: G**
