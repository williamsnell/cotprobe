Okay, so I've got this problem here about estimating the maximum percentage error in the surface area calculation using differentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differentials, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The formula given is S = 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^0.725. So S is the surface area, w is weight in pounds, and h is height in inches. The errors in measuring w and h are at most 2%, and I need to find the max percentage error in S using differentials.

Right, so I remember that when using differentials to estimate errors, we take the partial derivatives of S with respect to each variable, multiply each by the error in that variable, and then combine them. Since the question is about percentage error, I think I'll need to express everything in terms of relative errors.

Wait, percentage error in S would be (delta S / S) * 100%. So first, I need to find delta S, which is the differential dS.

The formula for dS should be the sum of the partial derivatives multiplied by the changes in each variable. So:

dS = (∂S/∂w) * dw + (∂S/∂h) * dh

But since we're dealing with relative errors, maybe it's easier to express each term as a fraction of the variable itself. Like, (dw/w) is the relative error in w, and similarly for h.

So, let's compute the partial derivatives first. Let me think.

The partial derivative of S with respect to w is:

∂S/∂w = 0.1091 * 0.425 * w^(0.425 - 1) * h^0.725
= 0.1091 * 0.425 * w^(-0.575) * h^0.725

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to h is:

∂S/∂h = 0.1091 * 0.725 * w^0.425 * h^(0.725 - 1)
= 0.1091 * 0.725 * w^0.425 * h^(-0.275)

But wait, when calculating the relative error, maybe it's better to find (dS/S) which would be the sum of (∂S/∂w * dw)/S and (∂S/∂h * dh)/S. So each term is (∂S/∂w * dw)/S and (∂S/∂h * dh)/S.

Alternatively, since S = 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^0.725, I can factor out S from the expressions for the partial derivatives.

Let's compute (∂S/∂w)/S:

(∂S/∂w) = 0.425 * 0.1091 * w^(-0.575) * h^0.725
But S is 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^0.725, so when I divide (∂S/∂w) by S, the 0.1091 and h^0.725 terms cancel out. So:

(∂S/∂w)/S = 0.425 / w^(0.575 + 0.425) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, let's compute it properly.

Wait, (∂S/∂w) = 0.425 * S / w. Because let me see:

S = 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^0.725
Take the partial derivative with respect to w: that's 0.1091 * 0.425 * w^(0.425-1) * h^0.725 = 0.425 * (0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^0.725) / w ) = 0.425 * S / w.

Similarly, (∂S/∂h) = 0.725 * S / h.

Oh, that's much simpler! So (∂S/∂w) = 0.425 S / w, and (∂S/∂h) = 0.725 S / h.

So then, (dS)/S = (0.425/w) * dw + (0.725/h) * dh.

Wait, but (dS)/S is the relative error in S, right? So the percentage error would be 100% times (dS/S).

But the errors in w and h are given as 2%, so the maximum possible (dw/w) is 0.02, and similarly for dh/h.

So substituting, the maximum (dS/S) would be 0.425 * 0.02 + 0.725 * 0.02.

Let me compute that:

0.425 * 0.02 = 0.0085

0.725 * 0.02 = 0.0145

Adding them together: 0.0085 + 0.0145 = 0.023.

So 0.023 is 2.3%, right?

Wait, but wait. The question says "maximum percentage error". So does this mean I should consider the absolute value, or are there any other factors? Hmm, I don't think signs matter because errors are absolute, so we're adding the magnitudes.

So the maximum percentage error should be 2.3%, which would correspond to option C.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula I used: (dS/S) = (∂S/S)(∂w/w) + (∂S/S)(∂h/h) * (dh/h). Since each term is 0.425 and 0.725, multiplied by 0.02 each. So yes, the sum is 0.02*(0.425 + 0.725) = 0.02*(1.15) = 0.023, which is 2.3%.

Looking back at the options, option C is 2.3%. So that should be the correct answer.

To estimate the maximum percentage error in the calculated surface area \( S \), we use the formula for differentials:

\[
\frac{dS}{S} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial w} \cdot \frac{dw}{S} + \frac{\partial S}{\partial h} \cdot \frac{dh}{S}.
\]

The given model is:

\[
S = 0.1091 \cdot w^{0.425} \cdot h^{0.725}.
\]

First, we compute the partial derivatives:

\[
\frac{\partial S}{\partial w} = 0.425 \cdot S / w, \quad \frac{\partial S}{\partial h} = 0.725 \cdot S / h.
\]

Substituting these into the expression for \(\frac{dS}{S}\), we get:

\[
\frac{dS}{S} = 0.425 \cdot \frac{dw}{w} + 0.725 \cdot \frac{dh}{h}.
\]

The maximum relative errors in \( w \) and \( h \) are given as 2%, so:

\[
\frac{dw}{w} = 0.02, \quad \frac{dh}{h} = 0.02.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{dS}{S} = 0.425 \cdot 0.02 + 0.725 \cdot 0.02 = 0.02 \cdot (0.425 + 0.725) = 0.02 \cdot 1.15 = 0.023.
\]

Thus, the maximum percentage error in \( S \) is:

\[
0.023 \cdot 100\% = 2.3\%.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: 2.3%**
