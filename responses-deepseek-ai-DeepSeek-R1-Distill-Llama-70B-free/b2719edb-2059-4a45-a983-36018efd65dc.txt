Okay, so I've got this question here about who wrote the lyrics to Frank Sinatra's famous song "My Way." Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I know that "My Way" is one of Sinatra's signature tunes. It's that really iconic song where he talks about doing things his way, right? But I'm not sure who actually wrote it. I remember that a lot of Sinatra's songs were written by other people, not him. So the question is about the lyricist.

Looking at the options:

A: Frank Sinatra. Wait, did he write it? I don't think so. I believe Sinatra was more of a performer. He might have co-written some songs, but I'm not sure about "My Way."

B: Johnny Cash. No, that doesn't sound right. Johnny Cash wrote a lot of his own stuff, like "I Walk the Line" or "Folsom Prison Blues," but "My Way" isn't his style, I don't think.

C: Leonard Cohen. Oh, Leonard wrote "Hallelujah" and other deep songs. Doesn't seem like "My Way" would be his style.

D: Carole King. She's more known for her own hits like "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" or "I Feel the Earth Move." She wrote a lot with Gerry Goffin, but "My Way" doesn't ring a bell.

E: Bob Dylan. Definitely not. Dylan's style is more poetic and protest-like, not the kind of song Sinatra would sing.

F: Kris Kristofferson. He wrote "Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down" and others, but again, not "My Way."

G: Paul Anka. Wait, I think I've heard that name before in relation to this song. Wasn't "My Way" actually written by someone else, maybe a French composer, and then adapted by Paul Anka?

H: Elton John. No, he's more into his own hits like "Rocket Man" or "Crocodile Rock."

I: Tom Waits. His voice is so distinctive, and his songs have a different vibe, so probably not.

J: Neil Diamond. He's written a lot of his own songs, but "My Way" doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, I think "My Way" was actually an adaptation of a French song called "Comme d'habitude" by Claude Fran√ßois and Jacques Revaux. Paul Anka is the one who adapted it into English for Sinatra. So the lyrics were written by Paul Anka.

So the correct answer should be G: Paul Anka.

The lyrics to Frank Sinatra's "My Way" were written by Paul Anka, who adapted the song from the French original "Comme d'habitude."
