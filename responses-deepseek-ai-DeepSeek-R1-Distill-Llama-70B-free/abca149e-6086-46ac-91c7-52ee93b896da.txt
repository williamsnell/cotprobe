Question:

Define behaviorism and social learning theory.

Options:

A: Behaviorism focuses on the analysis of human emotions as the primary factor in behavior, whereas social learning theory emphasizes the role of instinctual drives.
B: Behaviorism refers to a theory that considers only observable behavior. Social learning theory is based on the fact that children imitate and includes the importance of dependency as the major factor that brings about socialization.
C: Social learning theory is a subset of behaviorism that deals exclusively with verbal learning and linguistics.
D: Social learning theory is solely about children's aggression.
E: Behaviorism is a theory that emphasizes the importance of supernatural influences on behavior, while social learning theory focuses on the impact of societal norms only.
F: Behaviorism is concerned with unobservable mental processes.
G: Social learning theory suggests that behavior is entirely shaped by peer pressure, while behaviorism states that behavior is a result of conscious decision-making.
H: Behaviorism and social learning theory both argue that behavior is a direct consequence of divine will, without the influence of the environment or cognition.
I: Behaviorism is based on the idea that behavior is determined by past life experiences, while social learning theory asserts that behavior is solely a result of genetic inheritance.
J: Behaviorism believes in the major role of intrinsic factors in behavior.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about behaviorism and social learning theory. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking me to define both behaviorism and social learning theory and choose the correct option from A to J. I remember that behaviorism is one of the older schools of thought in psychology. From what I recall, behaviorists focus on observable behaviors rather than internal mental processes. So they're all about what you can see and measure, like actions and responses, rather than thoughts or emotions.

Now, social learning theory. I think this is more about how people learn new behaviors by observing others. I remember something about Albert Bandura and his Bobo doll experiment. He showed that kids would imitate adults' aggressive behavior towards the doll, which suggests that learning happens through observation and imitation. So social learning theory is about how observing others influences our behavior, and it includes concepts like modeling and reinforcement.

Looking at the options, I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: Behaviorism focuses on human emotions, social learning on instincts. No, that doesn't sound right. Behaviorism isn't about emotions; it's more about observable behavior. So A is wrong.

Option B: Behaviorism considers only observable behavior. Social learning theory involves imitation and dependency. Hmm, the first part about behaviorism sounds correct. The second part mentions children imitating, which aligns with social learning. But wait, dependency as a major factor? I thought social learning was more about observation and modeling, not just dependency. Not sure yet, but maybe B is a contender.

Option C: Social learning is a subset of behaviorism dealing with verbal learning. No, I don't think social learning is just a subset. It's its own theory, and it's broader than just verbal stuff.

Option D: Social learning is solely about children's aggression. No, that's too narrow. Social learning applies to all kinds of behaviors, not just aggression.

Option E: Behaviorism emphasizes supernatural influences. No, behaviorism is about observable behavior, not supernatural stuff. So E is wrong.

Option F: Behaviorism is about unobservable mental processes. Wait, no, behaviorism is the oppositeâ€”it focuses only on what's observable. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Social learning is entirely peer pressure; behaviorism is conscious decisions. No, social learning is about observation and imitation, not just peer pressure. And behaviorism doesn't focus on conscious decisions, it's more about external stimuli and responses.

Option H: Both blame divine will. No, that's not right. Both theories are about environmental factors, not divine.

Option I: Behaviorism is past experiences; social learning is genetics. No, behaviorism is about environment and learning, not past lives. And social learning isn't about genetics either.

Option J: Behaviorism is about intrinsic factors. No, behaviorism is more about external factors like environment and stimuli.

So the correct option must be B. Behaviorism is about observable behavior, and social learning involves imitation, though I'm a bit unsure about the dependency part. Wait, maybe dependency is part of social learning? Or is that more about attachment theory? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh well, I think B is the best fit.

The correct answer is:

B: Behaviorism refers to a theory that considers only observable behavior. Social learning theory is based on the fact that children imitate and includes the importance of dependency as the major factor that brings about socialization.

Answer: B
