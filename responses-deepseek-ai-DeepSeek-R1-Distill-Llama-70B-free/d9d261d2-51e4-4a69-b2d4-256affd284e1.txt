Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Carnot refrigerator problem. Hmm, I remember that Carnot refrigerators are idealized models, so their efficiency is based on the Carnot cycle, but for refrigeration instead of heat engines.

The question says the temperature inside the refrigerator was initially at 5°C, and the ambient temperature is 27°C. Later, the inside temperature is decreased to -13°C, while the ambient stays the same. I need to find the percent increase in work input for the same amount of heat removed.

Wait, I think the key here is the Coefficient of Performance (COP) for a refrigerator. The COP tells us how efficient the refrigerator is. A higher COP means it's more efficient, so less work input is needed to remove the same amount of heat.

The COP for a Carnot refrigerator is given by COP = Tc / (Th - Tc), where Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir (inside the fridge) and Th is the hot reservoir (ambient). But wait, temperatures need to be in Kelvin for these calculations. So I should convert those Celsius temperatures to Kelvin.

First, initial state:
Tc1 = 5°C + 273.15 = 278.15 K
Th1 = 27°C + 273.15 = 300.15 K
So COP1 = Tc1 / (Th1 - Tc1) = 278.15 / (300.15 - 278.15) 

Let me compute the denominator: 300.15 - 278.15 = 22 K. So COP1 = 278.15 / 22 ≈ 12.6418.

Wait, that seems high, but I think it's correct for a Carnot refrigerator.

Now the new state:
Tc2 = -13°C + 273.15 = 260.15 K
Th2 is still 300.15 K.
COP2 = 260.15 / (300.15 - 260.15) → denominator is 40 K.

So COP2 = 260.15 / 40 ≈ 6.50375.

Wait, so the COP has decreased. That makes sense because when you make the inside colder, it's harder to remove heat, so you need more work input for the same Q.

But the question is about the percent increase in work input. Since COP is the ratio of heat removed (Qc) to work input (W), COP = Qc/W. So W = Qc / COP. If COP goes down, W goes up for the same Qc.

So initially, W1 = Qc / COP1. After, W2 = Qc / COP2. The percent increase is ((W2 - W1)/W1)*100.

Substituting W in terms of COP:
(W2/W1) = (COP1 / COP2). So the ratio is (12.6418)/(6.50375) ≈ 1.944.

Wait, so W2 is about 1.944 times W1. That means the work input almost doubles. So the increase is 94.4%. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate COP1 and COP2 more accurately.

COP1 = 278.15 / (300.15 - 278.15) → denominator is 22, as before. 278.15 /22 = let's compute that. 22 *12=264, 278.15-264=14.15. 14.15/22 = 0.6436. So total is 12.6436.

COP2: 260.15 / (300.15-260.15) → 260.15 /40 = 6.50375.

So W2/W1 = 12.6436 /6.50375 ≈ let me calculate that.

12.6436 /6.50375 → 6.50375 *1.94=?

6.5 *1.94= 12.61. Which is close to 12.64. So approximately 1.944.

So the work input increases by about 94.4%. Looking at the options, option G is 94.5%, which is very close. So probably G is the answer.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

12.6436 / 6.50375 = ?

Let me do the division:

6.50375 × 1.94 = 6.50375 *1 =6.50375; 6.50375 *0.9=5.853375; 6.50375 *0.04=0.26015. So total 6.50375 +5.853375=12.357, plus 0.26015=12.617. Which is very close to 12.6436. So the ratio is approximately 1.94. So 1.94 times the original work.

Percent increase is (1.94 -1 ) *100= 0.94*100=94%. So the answer is 94.5% which is option G.

To determine the percent increase in work input for the Carnot refrigerator, we use the Coefficient of Performance (COP) for a refrigerator, which is given by:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c}
\]

where \(T_c\) is the temperature of the cold reservoir (inside the refrigerator) and \(T_h\) is the temperature of the hot reservoir (ambient). Temperatures must be in Kelvin, so we convert the given Celsius temperatures:

1. **Initial State**:
   - \(T_{c1} = 5^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 278.15 \, \text{K}\)
   - \(T_{h1} = 27^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K}\)
   - \(\text{COP}_1 = \frac{278.15}{300.15 - 278.15} = \frac{278.15}{22} \approx 12.6418\)

2. **New State**:
   - \(T_{c2} = -13^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 260.15 \, \text{K}\)
   - \(T_{h2} = 27^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K}\)
   - \(\text{COP}_2 = \frac{260.15}{300.15 - 260.15} = \frac{260.15}{40} \approx 6.50375\)

The work input \(W\) is related to the COP by \(W = \frac{Q_c}{\text{COP}}\), where \(Q_c\) is the heat removed. For the same \(Q_c\), the ratio of work inputs is:

\[
\frac{W_2}{W_1} = \frac{\text{COP}_1}{\text{COP}_2} = \frac{12.6418}{6.50375} \approx 1.944
\]

This means the work input increases by a factor of approximately 1.944. The percent increase in work input is:

\[
\text{Percent Increase} = \left(1.944 - 1\right) \times 100 = 0.944 \times 100 \approx 94.4\%
\]

The closest option to this value is **94.5%**, which corresponds to **Option G**.
