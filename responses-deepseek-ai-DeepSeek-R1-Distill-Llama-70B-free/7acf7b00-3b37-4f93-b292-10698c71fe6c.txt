Question:

An investor is looking to purchase a security for $100 with an initial margin of 50% (meaning the investor is using $50 of his money to purchase the security and borrowing the remaining $50 from a broker).

Okay, so I've got this question about margin calls in investing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the scenario is an investor buying a security for $100 with an initial margin of 50%. That means the investor puts up half the money, right? So if the price is $100, the investor pays $50, and borrows the other $50 from the broker. So the total investment is $100, split equally between the investor's money and the loan.

Now, the question is about the maintenance margin, which is 25%. I remember that maintenance margin is the minimum amount of equity the investor must maintain in their account. If the value of the security drops below this, the broker issues a margin call, asking the investor to deposit more funds or sell some assets.

So, the key here is to find out at what price the investor's equity falls below the maintenance margin level, triggering the call.

Let me think about the formula. I think the formula to find the price at which a margin call occurs is based on the initial margin and maintenance margin. Oh right, the formula involves the initial margin, the maintenance margin, and the purchase price.

Wait, okay, the formula I remember is: 

Price = (Maintenance Margin) * (Initial Investment) / (1 - Initial Margin + Maintenance Margin)

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's break it down.

The initial investment is $100, with 50% margin, so the investor's equity is $50, and the broker's loan is $50. If the price of the security drops, the value of the investment decreases. The equity in the investment is the current value minus the broker's loan.

So, at any point, the equity (E) is equal to the current value of the security (P) times the number of shares minus the loan. But wait, since the number of shares is the initial $100 divided by $100, that's 1 share. So the current value is P * 1 = P.

So, equity E = P - $50.

The maintenance margin is 25%, which is 25% of the current value of the security. So the required equity is 0.25 * P.

When the equity falls below this required maintenance, the margin call happens. So we set E = 0.25 * P.

But E is also P - 50. So:

P - 50 = 0.25 * P

Let me solve for P.

P - 0.25 P = 50

0.75 P = 50

P = 50 / 0.75

Hmm, 50 divided by 0.75. Let me calculate that.

0.75 is three-fourths, so 50 divided by (3/4) is 50 * (4/3) = 200/3 ≈ 66.666... So about $66.67.

Looking at the options, option H is 66.67, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way I've heard this explained is that the price drop to the point where the loan equals the maintenance margin. So the formula might also be presented as:

Maintenance Margin = (Loan) / (Current Value)

So 25% = 50 / P

Solving for P: P = 50 / 0.25 = 200. That can't be right because that's higher than the purchase price. So I must have messed that up.

Wait no, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me think again. The maintenance margin is the ratio of equity to the current value. So when the equity (which is P - 50) is equal to 25% of P.

So (P - 50) = 0.25 P → same equation as before, leading to P=66.67.

That makes sense. So the correct answer is H, 66.67.

To determine the price at which the investor will receive a margin call, we analyze the given conditions:

1. **Initial Investment**: The investor purchases a security for $100 with an initial margin of 50%. This means the investor contributes $50 of their own money, and the broker loans the remaining $50.

2. **Maintenance Margin**: The maintenance margin is 25%. This represents the minimum equity the investor must maintain in the account relative to the current value of the security. If the equity falls below this threshold, a margin call is triggered.

3. **Equity Calculation**: The investor's equity (E) in the investment is the current value of the security (P) minus the broker's loan ($50). Thus, \( E = P - 50 \).

4. **Maintenance Margin Requirement**: The required equity is 25% of the current value of the security, or \( 0.25 \times P \).

5. **Triggering the Margin Call**: A margin call occurs when the investor's equity equals the maintenance margin. Setting \( E = 0.25 \times P \), we solve for \( P \):
   \[
   P - 50 = 0.25P
   \]
   \[
   P - 0.25P = 50
   \]
   \[
   0.75P = 50
   \]
   \[
   P = \frac{50}{0.75} = 66.67
   \]

Thus, the investor will receive a margin call when the price of the security drops to $66.67. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 66.67**

Answer: H
