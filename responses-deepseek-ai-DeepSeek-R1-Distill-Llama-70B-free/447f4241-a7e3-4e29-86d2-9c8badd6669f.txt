Okay, so I've got this economics question here about how increased corporate optimism affects the market for loanable funds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that the market for loanable funds involves the supply of savings and the demand for borrowing. The interest rate is determined where these two meet. So, when something changes, either supply or demand shifts, which affects the interest rate.

Corporate optimism... I think that's about businesses feeling more confident about the future. So if companies are more optimistic, they probably expect better returns on their investments. That makes them want to borrow more to invest in expansion, new projects, etc. 

Wait, so if businesses want to borrow more, that's an increase in demand for loanable funds. Because demand in this context is firms borrowing to invest. So the demand curve should shift to the right.

What about the supply side? Supply comes from households saving. Does corporate optimism affect how much people save? I'm not so sure. Corporate optimism might lead to increased investment, but does that influence savings? I don't think so directly. People's savings decisions are more about their income, interest rates, and maybe consumer confidence, not so much corporate optimism. So maybe the supply of loanable funds doesn't change much.

So putting it together: increased demand (because firms want to borrow more) with supply staying the same. When demand increases, the demand curve shifts right. At the equilibrium point, with higher demand and same supply, the interest rate should rise because more people are wanting to borrow than before.

So looking at the options, which one fits this scenario. Let's see:

Option D says an increase in demand increasing the interest rate. That matches what I was thinking.

Option B says supply increases, which I don't think is the case. Option E is about supply decreasing, which also doesn't fit. Option C is a decrease in demand, which is the opposite. 

Wait, but what if I'm mixing up supply and demand? Wait, no, in the loanable funds market, the demand is for investment (firms borrowing), and the supply is savings. So when firms are more optimistic, they increase their demand for funds to invest. So yes, demand increases.

So the correct effect is demand increases, leading to higher interest rates. So the answer should be D.

When corporate optimism increases, businesses anticipate higher returns on investments, leading them to borrow more to expand or undertake new projects. This increases the demand for loanable funds. The supply of loanable funds, which comes from household savings, is not directly affected by corporate optimism. As a result, the demand curve for loanable funds shifts to the right, while the supply curve remains unchanged. This shift leads to an increase in the equilibrium interest rate.

Analyzing the options:

- **D**: Correct. An increase in demand increases the interest rate.
- Other options either incorrectly describe the direction of the shift or misattribute the cause of the change.

The correct answer is:

D
