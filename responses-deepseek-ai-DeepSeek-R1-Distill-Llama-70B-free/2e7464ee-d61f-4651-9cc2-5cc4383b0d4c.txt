Question:

A 55-year-old man has had crushing substernal chest pain on exertion over the past 6 weeks. He had a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a β-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?

Options:

A: Decreasing myocardial contractility
B: Dilating the coronary arteries
C: Peripheral vasodilation
D: Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a 55-year-old man who's been having crushing substernal chest pain when he exerts himself for the past six weeks. He had a myocardial infarction two months ago. His medications include nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He's a heavy smoker—two packs a day for 30 years. On exam, his heart sounds are normal, and there are no carotid or femoral bruits. The question is about why a beta-adrenergic blocker would help his symptoms.

Hmm, so the patient has a history of heart attack and now has chest pain on exertion. That makes me think he might have angina pectoris, probably stable angina since it's been going on for weeks and occurs with exertion. He's already on nitroglycerin, which is commonly used for angina, and aspirin, which is an antiplatelet agent. 

The question is specifically about beta blockers. I remember that beta blockers are used in various cardiac conditions. Beta-adrenergic blockers work by blocking the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine on the heart. So what do they do exactly?

I think beta blockers decrease the heart rate and the contractility of the heart. By doing so, they reduce the oxygen demand of the heart muscle, which can help in cases where the heart isn't getting enough oxygen, like in angina. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Decreasing myocardial contractility. That sounds right because beta blockers reduce the force of the heart's contractions, which lowers the oxygen demand.

Option B: Dilating the coronary arteries. I thought that nitroglycerin is a vasodilator, especially for the coronary arteries. Beta blockers might not directly cause significant coronary dilation. So B might not be the main mechanism here.

Option C: Peripheral vasodilation. Wait, beta blockers can cause vasoconstriction because they block beta-2 receptors which cause vasodilation. Or wait, some beta blockers are non-selective, others are selective. But in any case, I don't think peripheral vasodilation is the main way beta blockers help in angina. Maybe it's more about reducing the heart's workload.

Option D: Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs. That sounds more like the role of aspirin, which inhibits platelet aggregation. Beta blockers don't directly affect clotting much, so D is probably not the right answer.

So the main mechanism should be reducing the heart's oxygen demand by decreasing contractility and heart rate. Therefore, the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but let me make sure. Beta blockers also reduce afterload? Or is that more related to ACE inhibitors? Hmm, afterload is the resistance the heart has to pump against. Beta blockers might not lower afterload as much as other drugs. Their main effects are on heart rate and contractility.

So yes, the primary mechanism in this scenario is decreasing myocardial contractility, which reduces the oxygen demand of the heart and helps alleviate angina symptoms.

The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction and current symptoms of angina pectoris. He is being treated with nitroglycerin and aspirin, and the question focuses on the mechanism by which β-adrenergic blocking agents would improve his symptoms.

β-adrenergic blockers work by inhibiting the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on the heart, leading to decreased heart rate and myocardial contractility. This reduction in contractility lowers the heart's oxygen demand, which is beneficial in angina pectoris, as it helps reduce the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand in the myocardium.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Decreasing myocardial contractility** is correct because this is the primary mechanism by which β-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand and alleviate angina symptoms.
- **B: Dilating the coronary arteries** is not the main mechanism of β-blockers; this is more characteristic of nitroglycerin.
- **C: Peripheral vasodilation** is not a significant effect of β-blockers, which may even cause vasoconstriction due to β₂ receptor blockade.
- **D: Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs** is the role of aspirin, not β-blockers.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
