Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric dipoles. Hmm, I remember that an electric dipole is like two charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign separated by a small distance. Oh right, the dipole moment is the product of the charge and the separation distance.

Wait, the question is asking for the magnitude of the electric dipole moment. Oh, right, the formula for that is p equals q times d, where q is the charge and d is the distance between them. So I need to plug in the given values.

The charges are 1.50 nC each. Oh wait, nC is nano Coulombs, which is 1e-9 C. And the separation is 6.20 micrometers. Oh, micrometers are 1e-6 meters.

So let me convert those into base units. The charge q is 1.50e-9 C. The distance d is 6.20e-6 m.

Now, dipole moment p = q * d. So p = 1.50e-9 C * 6.20e-6 m.

Let me multiply those numbers. 1.5 times 6.2 is... let's see, 1.5 * 6 is 9, and 1.5 * 0.2 is 0.3, so total 9.3. So 9.3e-15 C·m.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 9.30e-15, which looks right. But wait, wait a second—am I missing anything here?

Wait, the problem mentions that the dipole is in an electric field. Oh wait, does that affect the dipole moment? Hmm, I think the electric field affects the torque or the potential energy, but the dipole moment itself is just based on the charge and separation. So the electric field strength given might be a distractor here. So I don't think I need to use it for calculating the dipole moment.

So yeah, I think the correct answer is option I, which is 9.30e-15 C·m.

The electric dipole moment is calculated using the formula:

\[
p = q \cdot d
\]

where \( q \) is the charge magnitude and \( d \) is the separation distance. The given values are:

- \( q = 1.50 \, \mathrm{nC} = 1.50 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} \)
- \( d = 6.20 \, \mu \mathrm{m} = 6.20 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m} \)

Substituting these into the formula:

\[
p = (1.50 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot (6.20 \times 10^{-6}) = 9.30 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m}
\]

The electric field strength provided in the problem does not affect the calculation of the dipole moment, as the dipole moment depends only on the charge and separation distance. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: \( 9.30 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \)**
