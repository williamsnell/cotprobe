Question:

A defendant was on the first day of her new secretarial job when her boss called her into his office. The boss directly suggested that if the defendant did not go out on a date with him, she would be fired in one week. Every day during the remainder of the week, the boss approached the defendant with his demand, and the defendant refused to cooperate. At the end of the week, when the boss called the defendant into his office and again tried to pressure her to go out on a date with him, the defendant knocked him unconscious with a giant stapler and choked him to death. The defendant is tried for murder. In accordance with the following statute, the state relies at trial on the presumption of malice:"When the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought shall be presumed, and the burden shall rest upon the party who committed the killing to show that malice did not exist. "If the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and challenges her conviction on the grounds of the above statute, on appeal she will

Options:

A: lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.
B: win, because the statute violates due process.
C: lose, because the presumption of malice aforethought is constitutional.
D: win, because she acted in self-defense.
E: lose, because her actions were premeditated.
F: win, because the statute is unjust.
G: lose, because she did not show that malice did not exist.
H: win, because the statute is discriminatory.
I: lose, because she failed to overcome the presumption.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with murder and the presumption of malice. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. 

Alright, the scenario is that a defendant is on her first day of a new job. Her boss immediately starts making demands that she go out on a date with him, threatening to fire her if she doesn't comply. Every day that week, he keeps pressuring her, and she keeps refusing. Finally, at the end of the week, when he brings it up again, she reacts violently—knocking him unconscious with a stapler and choking him to death. Now, she's being tried for murder.

The state is relying on a statute that presumes malice aforethought once the act of killing is proven. The burden then shifts to the defendant to show that malice didn't exist. The question is about whether this statute is constitutional, particularly when the defendant challenges it on appeal after being convicted of first-degree murder.

I remember that in criminal law, malice aforethought is a key element for murder. It refers to the intentional, deliberate, or premeditated killing. But sometimes, when certain circumstances are present, the law presumes malice. For instance, if the killing occurs during the commission of a felony like robbery, malice is presumed—this is the felony murder rule.

Now, the statute in question here says that when a killing happens, malice is presumed, and the defendant has to prove it didn't exist. That shifts the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense. But wait, isn't the burden of proof usually on the prosecution to prove all elements beyond a reasonable doubt? Shifting the burden like this could have constitutional implications.

I recall the case of Mullaney v. Wilbur, where the Supreme Court dealt with a similar issue. In that case, Maine had a statute that presumed malice from the act of killing, and the defendant had to prove that he acted in the heat of passion to reduce the charge to manslaughter. The Court held that this violated due process because it shifted the burden of proof on an element of the crime (malice) to the defendant. The state must prove all elements beyond a reasonable doubt, and such presumptions can infringe on that.

So in this question, the statute does the same thing—it presumes malice and makes the defendant show it wasn't present. That would likely be unconstitutional under Mullaney. If the defendant challenges this on appeal, the court would have to consider whether the statute violates due process by shifting the burden improperly.

Looking at the options, option B says she'll win because the statute violates due process. Option C says she'll lose because the presumption is constitutional. Others talk about self-defense or other factors, but the main issue here is the constitutionality of the statute.

Wait, but what about the facts of the case? She was being threatened and harassed repeatedly, but does that relate to malice? Malice is about the state of mind at the time of the killing. She might argue that she acted in self-defense or under provocation, but the question is about the statute's constitutionality.

So if the statute is unconstitutional because it improperly shifts the burden, then the defendant's conviction based on that statute would be overturned on appeal. Therefore, the correct answer would be that she wins because the statute violates due process.

Let me double-check the options. Option B is "win because the statute violates due process." That aligns with what I thought about Mullaney v. Wilbur. So yes, I think the answer is B.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a statute that presumes malice aforethought in a murder case, shifting the burden of proof to the defendant. The defendant, who killed her boss after repeated threats and harassment, challenges her conviction on the grounds that the statute violates due process.

Under the statute, once the act of killing is proven, malice is presumed, and the defendant must show that malice did not exist. This raises concerns about the allocation of the burden of proof, as the Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in *Mullaney v. Wilbur*, where it held that shifting the burden of proof on an element of the crime (malice) to the defendant violates due process.

In this case, the statute at issue improperly shifts the burden of proof, making it unconstitutional. Therefore, the defendant’s conviction, which relied on this statute, would likely be overturned on appeal. Among the options provided, the correct answer is that the defendant will win because the statute violates due process.
