Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is: By how much must investment rise to bring about a $300M change in income if the MPC (marginal propensity to consume) is 0.75. The options are A through J, with various amounts.

Hmm, I remember that in economics, when we talk about changes in income due to investment changes, we're probably dealing with the concept of the multiplier. The multiplier effect explains how an initial change in spending leads to a larger change in overall economic output.

Wait, right, the multiplier formula. I think the formula is something like 1 divided by (1 minus MPC). So the multiplier (let's call it 'k') equals 1/(1 - MPC). The MPC here is 0.75, so plugging that in would be 1/(1 - 0.75) which is 1/0.25 = 4. So the multiplier is 4.

But wait, the question is asking by how much investment should rise to get a $300M change in income. So the initial change in investment is the trigger. Since the multiplier is 4, each dollar of investment increases income by 4 dollars.

So if the desired change in income is $300M, then the required change in investment would be 300M divided by the multiplier. Let me write this down: ΔIncome = k * ΔInvestment. So ΔInvestment = ΔIncome / k.

Plugging in the numbers, 300M divided by 4 equals 75M. So the investment needs to rise by $75 million.

Looking at the options, E is $75M. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Sometimes, the formula is written as the change in income being equal to the multiplier times the change in investment. So if the multiplier is 4, then a $75M increase in investment would lead to a $300M increase in income. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if the MPC was different, like 0.8, the multiplier would be 5. But in this case, it's 0.75, so 4 is correct. Yeah, I think I got this right. So the correct answer is E.

To determine how much investment must rise to bring about a $300M change in income with an MPC of 0.75, we use the multiplier formula. The multiplier \( k \) is calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}}
\]

Substituting the given MPC of 0.75:

\[
k = \frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4
\]

The relationship between the change in income (\( \Delta \text{Income} \)) and the change in investment (\( \Delta \text{Investment} \)) is:

\[
\Delta \text{Income} = k \cdot \Delta \text{Investment}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \Delta \text{Investment} \):

\[
\Delta \text{Investment} = \frac{\Delta \text{Income}}{k}
\]

Substituting the desired \( \Delta \text{Income} \) of $300M and \( k = 4 \):

\[
\Delta \text{Investment} = \frac{300M}{4} = 75M
\]

Thus, investment must rise by $75M. The correct answer is:

E: $75M
