Question:

What is meant by income elasticity of demand?

Options:

A: Income elasticity of demand is the change in demand for a good in response to a change in the price level of all other goods.
B: Income elasticity of demand is the degree to which the demand for a good changes in relation to changes in population demographics.
C: Income elasticity of demand is the ratio of the change in the quantity of a good supplied to the change in consumer's income.
D: Income elasticity of demand is the proportion of income spent on a good to the total income.
E: Income elasticity of demand is the measure of how much the quantity of a good demanded fluctuates with changes in the prices of complementary goods.
F: Income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the price of a good divided by the percentage change in a consumer's income.
G: Income elasticity of demand is the measure of a consumer's willingness to buy more as income increases.
H: Income elasticity of demand is the correlation between a consumer's income and the price of a good.
I: Income elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage change in quantity of a good demanded divided by the percentage change in a consumer's income.
J: Income elasticity of demand is the change in the quantity of a good demanded in response to a one percent increase in the market interest rate.

Okay, so I've got this question about income elasticity of demand, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see... I remember from my economics class that elasticity measures how responsive one variable is to another. There are different types like price elasticity, income elasticity, etc.

The question is specifically about income elasticity of demand. I think it's about how the quantity demanded changes when income changes. So, the formula I recall is something like the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. Oh wait, or was it the other way around? No, I think it's the change in quantity over the change in income because it's about demand responding to income.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Change in demand in response to price level of other goods. That sounds more like cross-price elasticity, not income. So A is probably not right.

Option B: Degree to which demand changes with population demographics. Hmm, I'm not sure. Demographics might influence demand, but I don't think that's what income elasticity measures. It's more about income changes rather than population changes.

Option C: Ratio of change in quantity supplied to change in income. Wait, no. Elasticity of demand relates to quantity demanded, not supplied. So C is about supply, which isn't what we're looking for.

Option D: Proportion of income spent on a good. That sounds like the average expenditure or something, but not elasticity. Elasticity is about responsiveness, not just proportion.

Option E: Quantity demanded fluctuating with prices of complementary goods. That's cross-price elasticity again, so E is not it.

Option F: Percentage change in price over change in income. Wait, income elasticity is about quantity demanded changing with income, not price. So F might be mixing up variables. It mentions price change, which doesn't fit.

Option G: Measure of willingness to buy more as income increases. That sounds right conceptually. Income elasticity would show if a good is normal (demand increases with income) or inferior (demand decreases). So G is a possibility.

Option H: Correlation between income and price. That doesn't sound right. Income elasticity is about quantity demanded, not the price of the good.

Option I: Percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in income. Oh yeah, this matches what I was thinking earlier. So I is looking correct.

Option J: Change in quantity demanded with a one percent increase in interest rate. That's not related to income elasticity. It might relate to investment or something else, but not income.

So now, comparing G and I. G is a description about willingness, which is correct but not the precise definition. I is the actual formula. The question is asking for the definition, so I think I is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The formula for income elasticity is (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔI/I), which is exactly what option I says. So I is definitely the correct choice.

Another thought: sometimes the formula is written as the percentage change in quantity divided by percentage change in income. Yes, that's exactly what option I states. So I is correct. Option G is more of a description of what it implies, but the question is about what income elasticity of demand is, so the precise measure is I.

The correct answer is I.

Answer: I
