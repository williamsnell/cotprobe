Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ring theory, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question presents two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1: Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.

Hmm. I remember that a quotient ring is formed by taking a ring R and an ideal I, then considering the set of cosets R/I. Now, if R is commutative, does that property carry over to R/I?

I think so. Because in R, for any a and b, ab = ba. So in the quotient ring, when you have two cosets a+I and b+I, their product is ab + I. And since ab = ba in R, then (a+I)(b+I) = ab + I = ba + I = (b+I)(a+I). So the multiplication in the quotient ring should also be commutative. Therefore, Statement 1 should be true.

Wait, but wait a second. Are all ideals in a commutative ring such that the quotient remains commutative? Well, yes, because even if the ideal is not prime or something, the commutativity comes from the original ring. So yeah, I'm confident that Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 is in N.

Okay, let's think about this. If an ideal N contains 1, can we say N is R? 

I remember that in a ring with unity, if an ideal contains 1, then the ideal must be the entire ring. Because you can take any element r in R and write it as r*1, which is in the ideal. So yes, if 1 is in N, then N=R.

Conversely, if N is all of R, then obviously 1 is in N because R contains all elements, including 1. So the 'if and only if' condition holds. Which means Statement 2 is also true.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure. Does this hold in any ring, like without commutativity? Oh, the question says 'a ring R with unity', but doesn't specify commutative. But the statement is about an ideal, and in any ring (even non-commutative), if an ideal contains 1, it must be the entire ring. Because for any element r in R, you can multiply 1 by r on the left, which is r, and since the ideal is closed under addition and multiplication by ring elements, r would be in the ideal. So yes, N must be R. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait a moment. What if R is non-unital? Oh, but the statement says R has unity, so that's covered.

So both statements are true. Now, looking at the options:

Options are A-J. Let's look. The first part is Statement1, second is Statement2.

Option F: True, True. So that would be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check Statement1. Is every quotient ring of a commutative ring commutative? Suppose R is commutative, I is an ideal. Then R/I should be commutative because the operation is component-wise. Because (a+I)(b+I) = ab + I = ba + I = (b+I)(a+I). So yes, commutative. So Statement1 is definitely true.

So both statements are true. So the answer should be F: True, True.

Statement 1: Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.

To evaluate this, consider a commutative ring \( R \) and an ideal \( I \). The quotient ring \( R/I \) consists of cosets of the form \( a + I \). Since \( R \) is commutative, for any \( a, b \in R \), \( ab = ba \). In \( R/I \), the product of two cosets \( (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I \), and because \( ab = ba \) in \( R \), it follows that \( ab + I = ba + I \), so \( (a + I)(b + I) = (b + I)(a + I) \). Thus, \( R/I \) is commutative. Therefore, **Statement 1 is true**.

Statement 2: An ideal \( N \) in a ring \( R \) with unity \( 1 \) is all of \( R \) if and only if \( 1 \in N \).

If \( N \) is an ideal containing \( 1 \), then for any \( r \in R \), \( r = r \cdot 1 \in N \), implying \( N = R \). Conversely, if \( N = R \), then \( 1 \in N \) because \( 1 \in R \). Thus, the "if and only if" condition holds. **Statement 2 is true**.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is:

**F: True, True**
