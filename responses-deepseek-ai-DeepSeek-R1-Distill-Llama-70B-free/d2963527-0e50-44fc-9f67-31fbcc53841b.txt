Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about superimposing six simple harmonic motions. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that six SHMs, each with the same amplitude and period, are acting along the same straight line. They are superimposed, which means we add them up. The phase difference between each successive pair is the same. We need to find the phase difference that makes the resultant amplitude zero.

Wait, I remember that when you superimpose waves with the same amplitude and frequency but different phases, their resultant amplitude depends on the phase differences. If they're all in phase, the amplitude adds up, but if their phases are such that they cancel each other out, the resultant could be zero.

So, for N such waves with equal phase differences, the condition for zero resultant amplitude might relate to how their vectors sum up. Since each is a sine wave with the same amplitude, I can model each as a vector in the complex plane, rotating with the same frequency.

Let me think, each wave would have a phase of (n-1)*θ, where θ is the phase difference between each successive pair, and n ranges from 1 to 6. So the total sum would be the sum of these vectors.

Mathematically, the sum S of these six can be written as:

S = A [sin(ωt) + sin(ωt + θ) + sin(ωt + 2θ) + ... + sin(ωt +5θ)]

Wait, no, that's the sum of the displacements. Alternatively, using complex exponentials might be easier. Because in complex form, each wave is A e^{i(ωt + (n-1)θ) }, so the sum is A e^{iωt} multiplied by the sum of e^{i(n-1)θ} from n=1 to 6.

The sum of a geometric series comes to mind. The sum of e^{i0θ} + e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ} + ... + e^{i5θ} is a geometric series with ratio e^{iθ} and six terms. The formula for the sum S is (1 - r^N)/(1 - r), where r is the common ratio.

So substituting, the sum becomes (1 - e^{i6θ}) / (1 - e^{iθ} ). For the resultant amplitude to be zero, this sum must be zero. So setting the sum to zero:

(1 - e^{i6θ}) = 0 → e^{i6θ} = 1.

Which implies that 6θ must be an integer multiple of 2π. So 6θ = 2πk, where k is an integer. Then θ = (2πk)/6 = πk/3 radians.

Wait, but θ is a phase difference, so it's in the range of 0 to 2π. Let's find θ values within this range.

Let me compute for different k.

k must be such that θ is between 0 and 2π. Let's see:

For k=1: θ = π/3 radians = 60 degrees.
k=2: 2π/3 = 120 degrees.
k=3: π radians = 180 degrees.
k=4: 4π/3 ≈ 240 degrees.
k=5: 5π/3 ≈ 300 degrees.
k=6: 2π, same as 0, which would make all phase differences zero, so no cancellation.

But wait, if all phase differences are 60 degrees, what happens when we sum them?

Wait, let me think again. The sum is zero when the vectors are equally spaced around a circle. For example, if you have six vectors each at 60-degree increments, their sum would be zero because they form a regular hexagon, right? Like, each vector cancels out with the opposite one.

So for θ = 60 degrees, the sum is zero. So that's a possible answer. Looking at the options, option F is 60 degrees.

But wait, the question asks for one possible value. Are there others?

Well, considering θ = π/3 (60 degrees) is one solution. What about θ = 180 degrees? For six waves with phase differences of 180, each pair is out of phase. But wait, let me think: adding six such waves would each alternate between positive and negative. Let's see: the sum would be A*(1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1) = 0. Oh, wait, that's also zero!

So both 60 and 180 degrees would give a zero resultant amplitude. Hmm, but wait, the problem says that the phase difference between each successive pair is the same. So for six waves, the phase difference θ must be such that when you add all six, their vectors sum to zero.

Wait, wait a second. Let me reconsider the approach. When summing the vectors, each with a phase increment θ, the condition is 6θ = 2πk, but with the sum being zero. So 6θ must be 2πk, meaning θ = (2πk)/6 = πk/3.

So for k=1: π/3 (60 degrees), k=2: 2π/3 (120), k=3: π (180), which would be θ=180 degrees.

Wait, but when θ is 180 degrees, each successive wave is 180 degrees out of phase. So the first is at 0, the next at 180, next at 360 (which is 0 again), then 540 (180), etc. So in that case, we have three waves at 0 degrees and three at 180, which would sum to zero because (3A -3A) = 0. So yes, θ=180 degrees also works.

But looking back at the options, both 60 and 180 are present. Wait, but the question is to select one value. So which of these is an option given?

Looking at the options, F is 60 degrees, D is 180.

But wait, the question says six SHMs. Let me think about the condition when the sum is zero. The sum is zero when the vectors are symmetrically placed. For θ=60 degrees, the six vectors are spaced at 60 degrees each, forming a hexagon, so their sum is zero.

For θ=180, as I said, each alternate wave is opposite. So for six waves, they would be: 0, 180, 360 (0), 180, 0, 180 degrees. So sum is (1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1)A = 0. So yes, that works.

So both θ=60 and θ=180 are possible answers. But looking at the options, both F (60) and D (180) are present.

Wait, but wait, the question says the resultant amplitude is zero. So which of these options are correct.

Wait, another thought. The general condition for N waves with equal phase difference θ is sum zero when Nθ = 2π m, where m is an integer. Or when θ = 2π m / N. So for N=6, θ = 2π m/6 = π m/3.

So possible θ's are m=1: 60 degrees, m=2: 120, m=3: 180, m=4: 240, m=5: 300, m=6: 360 (same as 0).

So each of these θ's would make the sum zero. So in the options, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, etc. are possible.

Looking at the options, the given options include 60 (F), 120 (A), 180 (D), and 150 (J), etc.

Wait, the question asks for one possible value. So which of the options is a multiple that satisfies θ = π m/3.

Looking at the options:

Option F is 60 degrees (π/3). So that's a possible correct answer.

Option J is 150 degrees, which is 5π/6. Hmm, 5π/6 is not a multiple of π/3, because π/3 is 60, 2π/3 is 120, etc.

Wait, wait, wait, let me compute 150 degrees in terms of π. 150 degrees is 5π/6. So that's not an integer multiple of π/3 (which is 60 degrees). So it's not one of the solutions.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see: for six vectors, the condition is that 6θ is an integer multiple of 2π. So θ must be 2π k /6 = π k/3.

So θ must be 0, π/3 (60), 2π/3 (120), π (180), 4π/3 (240), 5π/3 (300), and 2π (360), but 360 is same as 0.

So the possible θ's are multiples of 60 degrees within 0 to 360.

So from the options, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 degrees are possible. But in the given options, 60 is F, 120 is A, 180 is D, 240 isn't listed, 300 isn't listed.

So the correct answers from the options are F, A, D.

Wait, but the question states that the phase difference between each successive pair is the same. So it's the same θ between each pair.

Looking back at the options, the problem is to select one value. So the correct answer could be any of F, A, D.

Wait, but the question says "one value", so any of these would work. But let's look at the options given.

Wait the options are:

A: 120

F:60

D:180

So all three of these are possible.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I thought θ = 60 degrees would make each phase differ by 60, so the vectors point in directions 0,60,120,180,240,300. Their sum would be zero because they're equally spaced. Similarly, when θ is 180, each wave alternates between 0 and 180, as I thought earlier.

So all three (60, 120, 180) would make the sum zero. Wait, wait, no. Because when θ is 120, let's see. θ=120 degrees.

Wait, for θ=120 degrees, the phases are 0,120,240,360 (0), 480 (which is 120), 600 (which is 240). So that's 0,120,240,0,120,240. So the sum would be [1 + e^{i120} + e^{i240} + 1 + e^{i120} + e^{i240} ] * A.

Which is 2*(1 + e^{i120} + e^{i240} ). But 1 + e^{i120} + e^{i240} is zero, because it's a sum of three vectors at 120 degrees apart. So 2*0 = 0. So sum is zero. Oh wait, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, each term is added twice? Let me compute 1 + e^{i120} + e^{i240} = 0. So 2*(0) is zero. So yes, θ=120 degrees also gives a zero sum.

Hmm, so in that case, all options A, F, D are correct. But the question only gives one correct answer. So perhaps I need to re-examine the possible solutions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all θ that are multiples of 60 degrees would work, but actually, in reality, only certain θ's would cause the sum to be zero.

Wait, let me think again. The condition for the sum to be zero is that the sum of the vectors is zero. So, for six vectors with equal phase increments, the sum is zero only when θ is 60 degrees (so vectors are at every 60 degrees, summing to zero as a regular hexagon), or when θ is 180 degrees (so they alternate between two directions, leading to cancellation), or perhaps in other cases.

Wait, but for θ=120 degrees, each wave increases the phase by 120, so the phases would be 0, 120, 240, 360 (0), 480 (120), 600 (240). So in effect, we have two cycles of 0,120,240. So the sum is 2*(each term) = 2*(0) =0. So yes, θ=120 would also make the sum zero.

So, the possible θ's are multiples of 60 degrees, but not all of them. Wait, but 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, etc., but in this case, N=6, so θ must be such that 6θ is a multiple of 360 degrees.

So 6θ = 360*k → θ=60*k degrees, where k is integer.

So θ can be 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, etc. So all multiples of 60 degrees within 0 to 360 would work.

Looking at the options, 60 (F), 120 (A), 180 (D) are all present. So which one is correct?

Hmm, the question asks for one value. So any of these would be correct, but the options probably have only one correct choice. Wait, but the options given are A to J, and the possible correct answers are among them.

Wait, perhaps I should check the sum in another way. Let's model the sum using vectors.

Each wave can be represented as a vector with magnitude A and angle (n-1)*θ for n=1 to 6.

The resultant is the vector sum of these six vectors.

For the resultant to be zero, the vectors must be equally spaced in angle such that their vector sum cancels out.

In the case of six vectors, this happens when they are spaced 60 degrees apart because 360/6=60. So θ=60 degrees gives each vector at 60-degree increments, leading to a symmetrical arrangement and zero sum.

Similarly, when θ is 180 degrees, the vectors alternate between 0 and 180 degrees. But with six vectors, that's three at 0 and three at 180. So 3A -3A =0.

Wait, but wait, let's count: n=1 to 6.

n=1: 0 degrees.

n=2: 180.

n=3: 360 → 0.

n=4: 540 → 180.

n=5: 720 → 0.

n=6: 900 → 180.

So the phases are 0, 180, 0, 180, 0, 180. So sum is (3A) - (3A) =0.

So both θ=60 and θ=180 degrees work.

So in the options, both F and D are possible correct answers.

But the question gives only one correct option. So perhaps only one is among the choices.

Looking at the options provided: F is 60, D is 180. So both are correct.

Wait, but the problem states that the phase difference between each successive pair is the same. So for θ=60, each consecutive pair differs by 60 degrees. For θ=180, each consecutive pair differs by 180 degrees. Both are possible.

So why is the answer only one of them?

Wait, perhaps I should look for the smallest possible phase difference. Or perhaps the question expects one particular answer.

Wait, another approach: the condition for zero resultant is that the sum of the exponentials equals zero. So the sum is (e^{i0} + e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ} + ... + e^{i5θ}) =0.

This sum can be written as (e^{i6θ} - 1)/(e^{iθ} -1) )=0. So numerator must be zero, denominator not zero.

So e^{i6θ}=1 → 6θ = 2πk → θ= (2πk)/6= πk/3.

So θ must be π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3, 5π/3, etc. So in degrees: 60, 120, 180, 240, 300.

So any of these are possible.

Looking at the options, 60, 120, 180 are present.

So all three are correct.

But the problem asks for one value, so any of these would do. The options include all three.

Wait, but the user is providing options A to J, and the correct answer is one of them. So perhaps the intended answer is 60 degrees, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the maximum possible phase difference. No, that's not correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 60 degrees because that's the first possible solution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another way to think: when you have an even number of waves, having them alternate 180 degrees apart can lead to cancellation. But in this case, six is even, so that's why 180 works. But 60 also works because of the symmetric distribution.

But looking at the options, 60 is option F, 180 is D.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F:60 degrees, because that gives the minimal phase difference for which the sum is zero.

So I'll go with F:60 degrees.

To solve the problem, we consider six simple harmonic motions (SHMs) with the same amplitude and period, superimposed along the same straight line. The phase difference between each successive pair is the same, and we are tasked with finding one value of this phase difference that results in a zero resultant amplitude.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Representation of SHMs**: Each SHM can be represented as a vector in the complex plane, with a phase difference of $\theta$ between successive waves. The total sum of these vectors determines the resultant amplitude.

2. **Condition for Zero Resultant Amplitude**: For the resultant amplitude to be zero, the sum of the vectors must cancel out. This happens when the vectors are symmetrically distributed around a circle. Mathematically, the sum of the vectors is zero if the phase difference $\theta$ satisfies the condition:
   \[
   6\theta = 2\pi k \quad \text{where } k \text{ is an integer.}
   \]
   Solving for $\theta$, we get:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{2\pi k}{6} = \frac{\pi k}{3}.
   \]
   In degrees, this corresponds to:
   \[
   \theta = 60k \quad \text{degrees, where } k = 1, 2, 3, \dots
   \]

3. **Possible Values of $\theta$**: Within the range $0 \leq \theta < 360^\circ$,
