Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about comparing investment projects, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is asking about when comparing investment projects, which of the options A through J is correct. The options are all statements about NPV, IRR, and how they compare projects.

Hmm, I remember that NPV stands for Net Present Value and IRR is the Internal Rate of Return. Both are methods used to evaluate the profitability of investments. But I think they don't always give the same results, especially when projects are of different sizes or timelines.

Let me go through each option one by one to see which one is correct.

Option A: The NPV will always agree with IRR metric. Wait, I don't think that's right. I remember that sometimes NPV and IRR can conflict, especially in cases where there's a conflict between two projects. For example, one project might have a higher NPV but a lower IRR, or vice versa. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: The ranking of projects by NPV is invariant to changes in the market rate. Hmm, the market rate is the discount rate used in NPV calculations. If the market rate changes, the NPV of each project would change, right? Because NPV is calculated by discounting cash flows. So if the discount rate changes, the NPV would change, which could affect the ranking. So B doesn't sound correct either.

Option C: We should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison. I'm not sure. I think using just one metric might not capture everything. I've heard that using both can be better because they show different aspects. For instance, NPV shows the dollar value, while IRR shows the rate. So maybe C isn't the right approach. But I'm not certain.

Option D: The IRR is always superior to the NPV for comparing projects. No, I don't think that's true. IRR has its own issues, like the possibility of multiple IRRs in some cases, which can be confusing. NPV is more straightforward in some ways, especially when comparing projects of different sizes. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: The IRR never changes the ranking of the projects. Wait, I thought that IRR can sometimes change the ranking compared to NPV, especially in cases where projects have different scales. Like, if one project is much bigger than another, the NPV might suggest one is better, but the IRR could suggest the other. So E says IRR never changes the ranking, which I don't think is correct. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The ranking of projects by NPV and IRR is always consistent regardless of the market rate. That doesn't sound right. The market rate affects NPV because it's the discount rate. So if the market rate changes, NPVs change, which could change rankings. Also, IRR is a rate, so maybe it's less affected, but I think under different rates, the rankings can change. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: The NPV and IRR will always provide the same project ranking. No, that's not true. There are cases where they conflict. For example, in some cases, Project A might have a higher NPV but a lower IRR than Project B. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The IRR will always agree with NPV metric. That's similar to A and G. Since A and G are wrong, H must be wrong too.

Option I: The ranking of projects by IRR is invariant to changes in the market rate. Wait, IRR is calculated as the rate that makes NPV zero. So if the market rate changes, how does that affect IRR? Let me think. The IRR is a function of the project's cash flows and isn't directly dependent on the market rate. So changing the market rate doesn't change the IRR itself, but it might change how projects are ranked when using IRR versus NPV. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. The IRR of a project is a fixed number based on its cash flows. So if you calculate the IRR for each project, that number doesn't change with the market rate. So the ranking based on IRR (which projects have higher IRRs) wouldn't change if the market rate changes. But wait, the market rate is the discount rate used for NPV. So IRR is kind of competing against the market rate when deciding project selection. So the ranking by IRR is independent of the market rate. So I think I is correct. Because whether you use a high or low market rate, the IRR of each project doesn't change, so their ranking based on IRR doesn't change.

Option J: The market rate doesn't affect the ranking of the projects. No, that's not true. The market rate is used to calculate NPV, so if the market rate changes, the NPV of projects change, which can affect their ranking when using NPV. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option I. Because the IRR of a project doesn't change when the market rate changes, so the ranking based on IRR remains the same, regardless of the market rate.

When comparing investment projects, it's important to evaluate the given options carefully:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. NPV and IRR do not always agree, especially in cases where projects differ in size or timeline.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The ranking of projects by NPV can change with the market rate because NPV is calculated using the discount rate.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While using a single metric might simplify comparisons, it doesn't provide a complete picture. Both NPV and IRR offer different insights.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. IRR is not always superior to NPV. IRR has limitations, such as the possibility of multiple IRRs for a single project.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. IRR can change the ranking of projects compared to NPV, particularly when projects differ in scale.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The market rate affects NPV, which can alter rankings. Thus, NPV and IRR rankings are not always consistent regardless of the market rate.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. NPV and IRR do not always provide the same project ranking, as they can conflict in certain scenarios.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Similar to A and G, IRR does not always agree with NPV.
- **Option I**: Correct. The IRR of a project is independent of the market rate, so the ranking of projects based on IRR remains unchanged when the market rate changes.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The market rate affects NPV, which can alter project rankings based on NPV.

The correct answer is **I**, as the ranking of projects by IRR is invariant to changes in the market rate.
