Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about behavior disorders that can be genetically inherited. The options are A through D: Hemiplegia, Anxiety Disorders, PTSD, and Adjustment Disorders. I need to figure out which ones are correct.

First, I should understand what each term means. Hemiplegia is a condition where one side of the body is paralyzed, usually after a stroke. It's more of a physical condition rather than a behavior disorder, so I don't think A is the right answer here.

Behavior disorders are more about psychological issues. Anxiety Disorders definitely fit because they include conditions like generalized anxiety, panic disorders, etc. I've read that there's a genetic component to anxiety disorders. People with a family history are more likely to develop them, so B seems correct.

PTSD, option C, is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. It's triggered by a traumatic event. While there might be some genetic predisposition to how people respond to stress, PTSD itself is more about the environment and experiences. So I'm not sure if it's inherited in the same way as anxiety disorders.

Adjustment Disorders, option D, are about how someone reacts to significant life changes or stress. These seem more situational and less likely to have a strong genetic link. It's more about coping mechanisms learned or environmental factors.

So putting it together, the question asks for behavior disorders that can be genetically inherited. Anxiety Disorders (B) fit because they have a known genetic component. The others either aren't behavior disorders (A) or are more environmentally triggered (C and D).
