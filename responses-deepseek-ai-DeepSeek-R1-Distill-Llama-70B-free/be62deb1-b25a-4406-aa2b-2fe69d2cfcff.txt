Okay, so I have this problem here about horizontal asymptotes of a function. Let me try to figure it out.

The function given is f(x) = (3^x)/(1 + 3^{-x}). I need to find the horizontal asymptote g(x), and then evaluate g(2023). Hmm, horizontal asymptotes usually depend on the behavior of the function as x approaches positive or negative infinity. 

Wait, horizontal asymptotes are about where the function tends to as x goes to infinity or negative infinity. So for f(x), I should consider the limits as x approaches both infinities.

Let me tackle each case separately. 

First, as x approaches positive infinity. Let's see, 3^x grows exponentially because 3 is greater than 1. What about 3^{-x}? Oh, right, 3^{-x} is 1/(3^x), so as x grows large, 3^{-x} approaches zero. 

So the denominator becomes 1 + something very small, which is approximately 1. Therefore, f(x) becomes (3^x)/1, which is just 3^x. But wait, 3^x as x approaches infinity is infinity. So the function tends to infinity. But wait, that can't be right because I'm looking for a horizontal asymptote, which is a finite value. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the horizontal asymptote is the value that the function approaches. But if it's going to infinity, that means there's no horizontal asymptote in that direction. So maybe I should look at the limit as x approaches negative infinity instead.

As x approaches negative infinity, 3^x becomes 3^(-|x|), which is 1/(3^|x|), so it approaches zero. What about 3^{-x}? When x is negative, -x is positive, so 3^{-x} becomes 3^|x|, which grows without bound. So the denominator is 1 + something very large, which is approximately 3^{-x}.

So f(x) becomes (something approaching zero) divided by (something approaching infinity). Let me write it out:

f(x) = (3^x) / (1 + 3^{-x}) 

As x approaches negative infinity, 3^x approaches 0, and 3^{-x} approaches infinity. So the denominator is 1 + a huge number, which is approximately 3^{-x}. So f(x) ≈ 0 / (3^{-x}) ) = 0 / (something very large) → 0. 

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me re-express the function to make it easier. Let's write 3^{-x} as (1/3^x). So the denominator is 1 + (1/3^x). 

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out 3^x from numerator and denominator. Let me try manipulating the function.

f(x) = (3^x) / (1 + 3^{-x}) 

Multiply numerator and denominator by 3^x to eliminate the negative exponent in the denominator:

Numerator becomes (3^x)*(3^x) = 3^{2x}
Denominator becomes (1)(3^x) + (3^{-x})(3^x) ) = 3^x + 1

So f(x) = 3^{2x}/(3^x + 1)

Hmm, that might not help much. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should rewrite the original function differently. Let me write 3^{-x} as 1/(3^x). So the denominator is 1 + 1/(3^x), which can be written as (3^x + 1)/3^x.

So f(x) = (3^x) / [ (3^x + 1)/3^x ) ] 

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so this becomes 3^x * (3^x)/(3^x + 1) ) = (3^{2x})/(3^x + 1)

Hmm, same as before. Now, as x approaches positive infinity, 3^{2x} grows much faster than 3^x, so the function behaves like 3^{2x}/3^x = 3^x, which goes to infinity. So no horizontal asymptote as x approaches positive infinity.

As x approaches negative infinity, 3^x approaches 0, so the denominator 3^x +1 approaches 1. The numerator is 3^{2x}, which is (3^x)^2, so (something approaching 0) squared is 0. So f(x) approaches 0/(1) → 0. 

So in this case, the horizontal asymptote as x approaches negative infinity is y=0. 

Wait, but the question says that g(x) is the horizontal asymptote of f(x). Wait, horizontal asymptotes are usually constants, not functions of x. Oh wait, perhaps the way the question is phrased is that g(x) is the horizontal asymptote function, but that doesn't make much sense because horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines, i.e., constants. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the horizontal asymptote of f(x), which is a constant, and then to evaluate g at 2023, which would be the same value because it's a constant function.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

If the horizontal asymptote is y = L, then g(x) would be a constant function equal to L. So g(2023) would just be L.

So from earlier, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches 0. As x approaches positive infinity, f(x) approaches infinity, so no horizontal asymptote there. So the only horizontal asymptote is y=0, as x approaches negative infinity. So g(x) = 0, which would make g(2023) equal to 0.

Wait, but let's double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra earlier.

Let me try another approach. Let's write f(x) as:

f(x) = 3^x / (1 + 3^{-x}) 

We can factor out 3^{-x} in the denominator:

Denominator: 3^{-x}(3^x + 1)

So f(x) = 3^x / [3^{-x}(3^x + 1) ) ] 

Which simplifies to (3^x) * (3^x)/(3^x +1) ) = 3^{2x}/(3^x +1)

Wait, same as before. Now, let's consider the behavior as x approaches positive infinity.

As x → ∞, 3^{2x} grows much faster than 3^x, so the function behaves like 3^{2x}/3^x = 3^x → ∞.

As x → -∞, 3^{2x} approaches 0, and 3^x approaches 0, so denominator approaches 1. So f(x) approaches 0.

So yes, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. Therefore, g(x) is 0 for all x, so g(2023) is 0.

The function given is \( f(x) = \frac{3^x}{1 + 3^{-x}} \). To determine the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \) and \( x \to -\infty \).

1. **As \( x \to \infty \):**
   - \( 3^x \) grows exponentially.
   - \( 3^{-x} = \frac{1}{3^x} \) approaches 0.
   - The denominator \( 1 + 3^{-x} \) approaches 1.
   - Thus, \( f(x) \approx \frac{3^x}{1} = 3^x \), which grows without bound.
   - Therefore, \( f(x) \to \infty \), and there is no horizontal asymptote in this direction.

2. **As \( x \to -\infty \):**
   - \( 3^x = \frac{1}{3^{|x|}} \) approaches 0.
   - \( 3^{-x} = 3^{|x|} \) grows exponentially.
   - The denominator \( 1 + 3^{-x} \) is dominated by \( 3^{-x} \), so it approaches \( 3^{-x} \).
   - Thus, \( f(x) \approx \frac{3^x}{3^{-x}} = \frac{3^x}{3^{|x|}} = \frac{1}{3^{|x|}} \), which approaches 0.
   - Therefore, \( f(x) \to 0 \), and the horizontal asymptote in this direction is \( y = 0 \).

Since the horizontal asymptote is a constant value, \( g(x) \) must be a constant function. From the analysis, \( g(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \), including \( g(2023) \).

Thus, the value of \( g(2023) \) is **0**.
