Okay, so I have this quadratic equation here: 2x² + 5x + 12 = 19 - 7x. And I'm supposed to find the positive difference between the two solutions. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.

First, I remember that to solve a quadratic equation, I need to have it in the standard form, which is ax² + bx + c = 0. So I should rearrange this equation to that form. Let me subtract 19 and add 7x to both sides to move those terms over.

So, starting with 2x² +5x +12 =19 -7x. Subtract 19 from both sides and add 7x to both sides. That would give me 2x² +5x +7x +12 -19 =0. Let me compute that.

5x +7x is 12x. 12-19 is -7. So the equation becomes 2x² +12x -7 =0. Okay, that's simpler.

Now, the standard form is 2x² +12x -7 =0. So here, a is 2, b is 12, and c is -7.

I need to find the solutions of this quadratic equation. I know there are a couple of methods: factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Factoring might be tricky here because the coefficients don't look very factorable, especially with a leading coefficient of 2 and a constant term of -7. So maybe the quadratic formula is the way to go.

The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Let me plug the values into this formula.

So, a=2, b=12, c=-7.

Discriminant D is b² -4ac. Let me calculate that. 12 squared is 144. 4*a*c is 4*2*(-7) = 8*(-7) = -56. So D = 144 - (-56) = 144 +56 = 200. Oh wait, no: wait, the formula is b² minus 4ac. So 144 minus (4 *2*(-7)) is 144 minus (-56) which is 144 +56=200. So discriminant is 200.

Wait, 200 is a positive number, so there are two real roots. That's good.

So the solutions are [-12 ± sqrt(200)]/(2*2) = [-12 ± sqrt(200)]/4.

Wait, sqrt(200) can be simplified. Let me factor 200. 200 is 100 *2, so sqrt(200) is sqrt(100*2)=10*sqrt(2). So sqrt(200)=10√2.

So substituting back, the solutions are [-12 ±10√2]/4. Let me simplify this fraction.

I can factor out a 2 in the numerator. So numerator is 2*(-6 ±5√2). So it becomes 2*(-6 ±5√2)/4. The 2 in the numerator and denominator can be reduced. 2/4 is 1/2. So the solutions are (-6 ±5√2)/2.

Wait, actually, let me check that: ( -12 ±10√2 ) /4. Each term in the numerator can be divided by 2. So -12/4 is -3, and 10√2/4 is (5√2)/2. So the solutions are (-3 ± (5√2)/2 ). Alternatively, I can write them as (-6 ±5√2)/2, but perhaps that's not necessary.

But the question is about the positive difference between the two solutions. Hmm. So what does that mean? Let me think. The two solutions are x1 = [-12 + sqrt(200)]/(4) and x2 = [-12 - sqrt(200)]/(4). Or wait, in the simplified form, x1 = (-3 + (5√2)/2 ) and x2 = (-3 - (5√2)/2 ). Wait, no, in the previous step, sqrt(200)=10√2, so when plugging back in, it's (-12 +10√2)/4 and (-12-10√2)/4. Let me think about those.

Alternatively, let me think of the two solutions as x1 and x2. The positive difference between them is |x1 - x2|. Because regardless of which is bigger, the positive difference is the absolute value of their difference.

So x1 = (-12 + sqrt(200))/4, x2 = (-12 - sqrt(200))/4.

So x1 -x2 = [(-12 + sqrt(200))/4 ] - [ (-12 - sqrt(200))/4 ]

Let me compute this. The denominators are same, so numerator is (-12 + sqrt(200)) - (-12 - sqrt(200)).

= (-12 + sqrt(200) +12 + sqrt(200)) /4.

The -12 and +12 cancel, and we have 2*sqrt(200) in the numerator.

So x1 -x2 = [2*sqrt(200)]/4 = sqrt(200)/2.

But sqrt(200)=10√2, so sqrt(200)/2 =10√2/2=5√2.

Wait, that's the difference. So the positive difference between the two solutions is 5√2. Hmm.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Because another way to think about it is, in a quadratic equation ax²+bx+c=0, the difference between the roots can be found using the formula sqrt(D)/a, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the sum of the roots is -b/a, and the product is c/a. But the difference, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the roots are [ -b + sqrt(D) ]/(2a) and [ -b - sqrt(D) ]/(2a). So their difference is [ (-b + sqrt(D))/(2a) ) ] - [ (-b - sqrt(D))/(2a) ) ].

That's equal to [ (-b + sqrt(D)) - (-b - sqrt(D)) ]/(2a) )

Which simplifies to [ (-b + sqrt(D) + b + sqrt(D)) ]/(2a) )

The -b and +b cancel, so we have (2*sqrt(D))/(2a) ) = sqrt(D)/a.

So in this case, D is 200, and a is 2. So sqrt(200)/2.

Which is (10√2)/2 =5√2.

Yes, that matches the earlier calculation.

So the positive difference is 5√2. Looking at the options, option D is 5√2. So the correct answer is D.

To solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 5x + 12 = 19 - 7x\) and find the positive difference between its solutions, we first rearrange it into standard form:

\[
2x^2 + 5x + 12 - 19 + 7x = 0 \implies 2x^2 + 12x - 7 = 0.
\]

Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = 12\), and \(c = -7\). Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

we calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 12^2 - 4(2)(-7) = 144 + 56 = 200.
\]

The solutions are:

\[
x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{200}}{4}.
\]

Simplifying \(\sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}\), the solutions become:

\[
x = \frac{-12 + 10\sqrt{2}}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-12 - 10\sqrt{2}}{4}.
\]

The positive difference between the two solutions is:

\[
\left| x_1 - x_2 \right| = \left| \frac{-12 + 10\sqrt{2}}{4} - \frac{-12 - 10\sqrt{2}}{4} \right| = \left| \frac{20\sqrt{2}}{4} \right| = 5\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the positive difference between the solutions is \(5\sqrt{2}\).

The correct answer is:

**D: \(5\sqrt{2}\)**
