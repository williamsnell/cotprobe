Okay, so I've got this question about the Pleiades star cluster. I remember the Pleiades is also called the Seven Sisters, right? But wait, how many bright stars does it actually have?

Hmm, I think in the night sky, with the naked eye, you can see about six or seven stars. But maybe it's more when you use telescopes. So the question is asking how many bright stars it's well-known for containing.

I've heard that in many cultures, the Pleiades are associated with seven stars, which is where the Seven Sisters myth comes from. So maybe the answer is seven. But wait, sometimes people say you can see six with the naked eye. Does that mean the total is seven including a fainter one?

Wait, the Pleiades is an open star cluster. Open clusters can have many stars, but the number of bright ones that are easily visible is usually around seven. So the options are A:5, B:7, C:9, D:12. I'm leaning towards B:7 because of the Seven Sisters reference.

But I'm a bit confused because I think there are more stars in the cluster, just not all bright. So the question specifies "bright stars," so it's probably the main seven that are noticeable. Yeah, I think the answer is B:7.

The Pleiades, often referred to as the Seven Sisters, is famously known for containing seven bright stars that are easily visible to the naked eye. This aligns with the cultural and mythological references to the cluster. While the cluster contains more stars, the question specifically asks about the number of bright stars it is well-known for, which is seven.

Answer: B
