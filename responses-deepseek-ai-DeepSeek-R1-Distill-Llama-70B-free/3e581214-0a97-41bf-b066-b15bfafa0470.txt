Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again.

Katie is going on vacation for 3 weeks. She finds the number of days of work she will miss by multiplying 5 × 3. The question is asking which expression shows another way she can find the number of days of work she'll miss.

Hmm, so the original calculation is 5 multiplied by 3. That makes sense because if she's missing work for 3 weeks and each week has 5 workdays, then 5 times 3 gives the total days missed. So 5×3 is 15 days.

Now, the question is asking for another way to express this calculation. So I need to look through the options and find an expression that also equals 15.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 5+3+3. Let's calculate that. 5 plus 3 is 8, plus another 3 is 11. Oh, that's 11. Not 15. So A is incorrect.

Option B: 3+3+3. That's 9. No, too low. So B is out.

Option C: 5×5. That's 25. Way too high. So C isn't right.

Option D: 5×3×3. Let's see, 5 times 3 is 15, times another 3 is 45. That's way more than needed. So D is wrong.

Option E: 5×2×3. 5 times 2 is 10, times 3 is 30. Nope, too big. E is incorrect.

Option F: 5+5+5+5+5. Let me add these up. Each addition is 5, and there are five terms. So 5×5 is 25. Again, too high. So F is out.

Option G: 5+5+5. That's 15. Oh, wait, that's correct. Because 5+5+5 equals 15, which is the same as 5×3. So G is a possible answer.

Option H: 3×4+5. Let's compute that. 3×4 is 12, plus 5 is 17. Not 15, so H isn't right.

Option I: 3+5. That's 8. Nope. I is incorrect.

Option J: 3×3×3. That's 27. Too high. So J isn't the answer.

Wait, so the correct alternative expression is option G: 5+5+5. Because that's adding 5 three times, which is the same as multiplying 5×3. So that makes sense.

I think that's right. The original method is multiplication, and the alternative is repeated addition. So G is the correct choice.

The correct answer is G because 5+5+5 equals 15, which is the same as 5×3. This represents adding the number of workdays (5) for each of the 3 weeks.

G
