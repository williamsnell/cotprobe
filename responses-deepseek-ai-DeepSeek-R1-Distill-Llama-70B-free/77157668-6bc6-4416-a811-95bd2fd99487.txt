Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the multiplicity of the root ξ=1 for the polynomial P(x) = x^5 - 2x^4 + 4x^3 - x^2 -7x +5. Then, using synthetic division, I guess I have to figure out something about the derivatives, because the question asks for P'(2) + P''(2). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the multiplicity part. I remember that the multiplicity of a root is how many times it occurs as a root of the polynomial. So, if ξ=1 is a root, I need to see how many times (x-1) divides into P(x). To find that, I can perform synthetic division multiple times. Each time I divide by (x-1), if the remainder is zero, it means (x-1) is a factor, and I can do it again on the resulting polynomial until it's no longer possible.

So, let's start with P(x). I'll set up synthetic division with root 1.

The coefficients of P(x) are: 1 (x^5), -2 (x^4), 4 (x^3), -1 (x^2), -7 (x), 5 (constant term).

Setting up synthetic division:

1 | 1  -2   4   -1   -7    5
    |      1    -1    3     2    -5
    ----------------------------
      1   -1   3     2    -5    0

Oh, so the remainder is zero. That means (x-1) is a factor once. Now, the resulting polynomial after division is x^4 -x^3 +3x^2 +2x -5.

Let me write that down: Q1(x) = x^4 -x^3 +3x^2 +2x -5.

Now, let's do synthetic division on Q1 with root 1 again.

1 | 1  -1   3    2   -5
    |      1    0    3     5
    ------------------------
      1   0    3    5    0

The remainder is zero again, so (x-1) is a factor a second time. Now, the new polynomial Q2(x) is x^3 +0x^2 +3x +5, which simplifies to x^3 +3x +5.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me check the synthetic division steps again. The coefficients after division for Q2 should be 1 (x^3), 0 (x^2), 3 (x), and 5 (constant). So, yes, correct.

Now, let's try synthetic division on Q2 with root 1.

1 | 1  0   3   5
    |      1    1    4
    --------------------
      1  1   4   9

Wait, the remainder here is 9, which isn't zero. So, (x-1) isn't a factor of Q2, meaning the multiplicity of ξ=1 is 2. So, that's the first part done.

Now, the next part is to find P'(2) + P''(2). I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Do I need to find the first and second derivatives of P(x), evaluate them at x=2, and add them together?

Wait, but P(x) is a fifth-degree polynomial. Calculating its derivatives directly might be tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I've already broken down P(x) into (x-1)^2 times Q2(x), where Q2 is x^3 +3x +5. Because I know that P(x) = (x-1)^2 * (x^3 +3x +5). So maybe I can find P'(x) and P''(x) using this factorization, which might be easier.

Let me think. If P(x) = (x-1)^2 * Q(x), where Q(x) = x^3 +3x +5, then I can use the product rule for differentiation.

First, find P'(x):
P'(x) = 2(x-1) * Q(x) + (x-1)^2 * Q'(x)

Then, P''(x) would be the derivative of P'(x), so applying the product rule again for each term.

But wait, maybe it's easier to just compute P'(x) and P''(x) the standard way.

Let me try that. Let's compute the derivatives directly.

P(x) = x^5 - 2x^4 +4x^3 -x^2 -7x +5.

First derivative P'(x):
5x^4 - 8x^3 +12x^2 -2x -7.

Second derivative P''(x):
20x^3 -24x^2 +24x -2.

Now, evaluate both at x=2.

Compute P'(2):
5*(2)^4 -8*(2)^3 +12*(2)^2 -2*(2) -7.

Let's compute each term:

2^4 = 16, so 5*16 = 80.
2^3=8, 8*8=64, so -8*8= -64.
2^2=4, 12*4=48, so 12*4=48.
-2*2= -4.
-7.

Add them up: 80 -64 = 16; 16 +48=64; 64-4=60; 60-7=53. So P'(2) is 53.

Now P''(2):
20*(2)^3 -24*(2)^2 +24*(2) -2.

Compute each term:

2^3=8, 20*8=160.
2^2=4, 24*4=96, so -24*4= -96.
24*2=48.
-2.

Add them: 160-96=64; 64+48=112; 112-2=110. So P''(2)=110.

Now, P'(2)+P''(2)=53+110=163.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is 163. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.

Let me recalculate P'(2):

5*(2)^4 =5*16=80
-8*(2)^3= -8*8= -64
12*(2)^2=12*4=48
-2*(2) = -4
-7.

So 80 -64 is 16. 16 +48=64. 64-4=60. 60-7=53. That's correct.

P''(2):

20*(8)=160
-24*(4)= -96
24*(2)=48
-2.

So 160-96=64. 64+48=112. 112-2=110. Correct.

53 +110=163. So the answer is H:163.

To determine the multiplicity of the root ξ = 1 for the polynomial \( P(x) = x^5 - 2x^4 + 4x^3 - x^2 - 7x + 5 \), synthetic division is performed. Dividing \( P(x) \) by \( (x-1) \) yields a remainder of zero, indicating that \( (x-1) \) is a factor. Repeating the process on the resulting polynomial \( Q_1(x) = x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 5 \) again gives a remainder of zero, showing that \( (x-1) \) is a factor a second time. The resulting polynomial is \( Q_2(x) = x^3 + 3x + 5 \). Performing synthetic division on \( Q_2(x) \) with \( (x-1) \) results in a non-zero remainder, so the multiplicity of \( \xi = 1 \) is 2.

Next, to compute \( P'(2) + P''(2) \), the first and second derivatives of \( P(x) \) are calculated:

\[
P'(x) = 5x^4 - 8x^3 + 12x^2 - 2x - 7
\]
\[
P''(x) = 20x^3 - 24x^2 + 24x - 2
\]

Evaluating \( P'(x) \) and \( P''(x) \) at \( x = 2 \):

\[
P'(2) = 5(2^4) - 8(2^3) + 12(2^2) - 2(2) - 7 = 80 - 64 + 48 - 4 - 7 = 53
\]
\[
P''(2) = 20(2^3) - 24(2^2) + 24(2) - 2 = 160 - 96 + 48 - 2 = 110
\]

Adding these results:

\[
P'(2) + P''(2) = 53 + 110 = 163
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

**H: 163**
