Question:

Trace the path that visual information takes on its way to the brain. Begin with the retinal receptor cells.

Options:

A: Retina's receptor cells -> optic nerve -> optic tracts -> optic chiasm -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> visual center of the thalamus (lateral geniculate body) -> visual cortex
B: Retina's receptor cells -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> optic nerve -> optic tracts -> optic chiasm -> visual cortex -> visual center of the thalamus (lateral geniculate body)
C: Retina's receptor cells -> optic chiasm -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> optic nerve -> optic tracts -> visual center of the thalamus (lateral geniculate body) -> visual cortex
D: Retina's receptor cells -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> optic nerve -> optic chiasm -> optic tracts -> visual center of the thalamus (lateralgeniculate body) -> visual cortex
E: Retina's receptor cells -> optic nerve -> optic chiasm -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> optic tracts -> visual center of the thalamus (lateralgeniculate body) -> visual cortex
F: Retina's receptor cells -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> optic nerve -> visual center of the thalamus (lateral geniculate body) -> optic tracts -> optic chiasm -> visual cortex
G: Retina's receptor cells -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> optic tracts -> optic nerve -> optic chiasm -> visual center of the thalamus (lateral geniculate body) -> visual cortex
H: Retina's receptor cells -> optic chiasm -> optic nerve -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> visual center of the thalamus (lateral geniculate body) -> optic tracts -> visual cortex
I: Retina's receptor cells -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> optic chiasm -> optic nerve -> optic tracts -> visual center of the thalamus (lateralgeniculate body) -> visual cortex
J: Retina's receptor cells -> optic nerve -> bipolar and ganglion cell layers -> optic chiasm -> optic tracts -> visual center of the thalamus (lateralgeniculate body) -> visual cortex

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the path visual information takes to the brain, starting from the retinal receptor cells. Hmm, I remember that the eye has several layers, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact order. Let me try to think this through.

First, I recall that when light hits the eye, it goes through the cornea and lens to focus on the retina. The retina has photoreceptor cells, which are rods and cones. These receptor cells convert light into electrical signals. So the starting point is definitely the retinal receptor cells.

Next, I think these signals are transmitted to another layer in the retina. I remember that the retina has bipolar cells and ganglion cells. The photoreceptors send signals to the bipolar cells, which then pass them on to the ganglion cells. So after the receptor cells, it goes to the bipolar and ganglion cell layers.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have optic nerve after the receptors. Oh right, because the ganglion cells' axons form the optic nerve. So after the bipolar and ganglion cells, the signals go into the optic nerve. So the path so far is: retinal receptors → bipolar and ganglion → optic nerve.

Then, what happens next? I remember that each eye sends signals via the optic nerve. But there's something about the optic chiasm. At the optic chiasm, the optic nerves from each eye cross over partially. So after the optic nerve comes the optic chiasm.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The optic nerve carries information from one eye. When the two optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, they split. Fibers from the nasal halves cross over, while the temporal halves don't. So after the optic nerve, the pathway goes through the optic chiasm.

Wait, but I think the optic nerve is before the optic chiasm. So the order is optic nerve → optic chiasm. After that, the combined signals form the optic tracts. So after the chiasm, it's optic tracts.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap. The visual pathway starts at the photoreceptors (receptor cells). They send signals to bipolar cells, then to ganglion cells. The axons of the ganglion cells form the optic nerve. So the order is receptor → bipolar/ganglion → optic nerve. Then, the optic nerves from both eyes meet at the optic chiasm, where the fibers cross. After the chiasm, the fibers form the optic tracts. These tracts then go to the thalamus, specifically the lateral geniculate body. From there, the signals go to the visual cortex.

So putting it all together, the correct path should be: receptor cells → bipolar and ganglion layers → optic nerve → optic chiasm → optic tracts → thalamus (lateral geniculate body) → visual cortex.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says: receptor → bipolar and ganglion → optic nerve → optic chiasm → optic tracts → thalamus → visual cortex. That matches what I just thought.

Let me check the other options just to be sure. Option A starts with receptor → optic nerve, which skips the bipolar and ganglion layers, so that's wrong. Option B has receptor → bipolar → optic nerve, but then goes to optic tracts and chiasm in a different order. Option D is the only one that follows the correct sequence.

The visual pathway begins with retinal receptor cells (rods and cones), which convert light into electrical signals. These signals are transmitted to bipolar cells and then to ganglion cells within the retina. The axons of the ganglion cells form the optic nerve, which carries the visual information. At the optic chiasm, the optic nerves from both eyes partially cross, allowing for binocular vision. After the optic chiasm, the fibers form the optic tracts, which relay the signals to the visual center of the thalamus (lateral geniculate body). From there, the information is sent to the visual cortex for processing.

Among the options, only **Option D** correctly follows this sequence:  
**Retina's receptor cells → bipolar and ganglion cell layers → optic nerve → optic chiasm → optic tracts → visual center of the thalamus (lateral geniculate body) → visual cortex.**

Answer: D
