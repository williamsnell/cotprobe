Question:

During spring break, a private boarding school was deserted while students and teachers were away on vacation. A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The student's attorney has filed a motion to suppress the heroin from evidence. The motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.
B: denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.
C: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to test the substance.
D: granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.
E: granted, because the student was not present during the search.
F: granted, because the student's room is considered private property.
G: denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.
H: denied, because the discovery of the substance was incidental to the counselor's actions.
I: denied, because the school has a policy allowing searches of student rooms.
J: denied, because the counselor had a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about evidence suppression, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. 

So, the scenario is that a guidance counselor at a boarding school stayed on campus during spring break. He went into a student's room, looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he found an expensive suitcase. Inside the suitcase was an express mail envelope. He opened it, saw white powder, suspected heroin, and called the police. The officer came, took the envelope to the station, opened it, sent a sample to the lab, which confirmed it was heroin. No warrant was obtained. Now the student is charged, and his attorney is moving to suppress the evidence. The question is whether the motion will be granted or denied.

I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. But there are exceptions, like when a private citizen does the search, not the police. So, the key here is who did the searching. The counselor is a school employee, not a law enforcement officer. So, if the counselor conducted the search, the police didn't need a warrant because the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply to private searches.

Wait, but the counselor was acting on his own, right? He was looking to steal, so he's not acting in his official capacity as a school employee. But even so, as a school employee, he might have some authority. But I think the general rule is that if a private citizen conducts a search, the evidence can be used even without a warrant. So, the police can use the evidence because they didn't conduct the illegal search.

So, in this case, the counselor was the one who opened the suitcase and envelope. The police didn't search it; they just took what the counselor found. So, the evidence wouldn't be suppressed because the police didn't violate the Fourth Amendment. The counselor's actions, even if illegal or unethical, don't implicate the state action needed for Fourth Amendment violations. 

Looking at the options, I think option G says the motion is denied because the search was conducted by a private party. That makes sense. The police didn't do the search, so no warrant was needed from them. 

Wait, but could there be another angle? Like, did the counselor have authority to search the student's room? Maybe as a school employee, he might have some kind of in loco parentis role. But in loco parentis usually allows school officials to search students' property under certain circumstances, like for school rules violations. But in this case, the counselor wasn't searching for that reason; he was searching to steal. So his actions were outside his official duties. But does that matter for the Fourth Amendment? Because if he's not acting as a state actor, then it doesn't. So, even if he's a school employee, if he's acting on his own illegal purposes, he's a private individual for Fourth Amendment purposes.

So the police didn't need a warrant because they were just receiving evidence from a private search. Therefore, the motion to suppress would be denied. So the correct answer is G: denied because the search was conducted by a private party.

I think that's it. The other options don't fit as well. Option B talks about in loco parentis, but since the counselor was acting outside his official role, that doesn't apply. Option J mentions reasonable suspicion, but the police didn't have any prior to the counselor's search. So, G seems right.

The motion to suppress the evidence will most likely be denied because the search was conducted by a private party. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by state actors, but it does not apply to searches conducted by private individuals. In this case, the guidance counselor, although a school employee, was acting outside his official duties and for personal gain when he searched the student's room and opened the envelope. His actions constituted a private search, and the police did not need a warrant to seize the evidence he provided. Therefore, the motion to suppress the evidence is denied.
