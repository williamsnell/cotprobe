Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see... The question is about flipping a balanced coin five times and finding the probability of getting exactly three heads. Hmm, I remember that probability questions often involve combinations and calculating the number of favorable outcomes over the total possible outcomes.

Wait, a balanced coin means each flip has a 50% chance of heads and 50% tails, right? So each flip is independent. Since the coin is fair, each outcome is equally likely.

I think this is a binomial probability problem because each trial (coin flip) has two possible outcomes, and we're looking for the number of successes (heads) in a certain number of trials (flips).

The formula for binomial probability is: P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Here, n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success on a single trial.

In this case, n=5 (five flips), k=3 (three heads), and p=0.5.

So first, I need to calculate the combination C(5,3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 successes out of 5 trials. The combination formula is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).

Calculating C(5,3): 5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. 3! is 6, and (5-3)! = 2! = 2. So C(5,3) = 120/(6*2) = 120/12 = 10. So there are 10 ways to get three heads in five flips.

Next, p^k is (0.5)^3. 0.5 cubed is 0.125.

Then, (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.5)^(5-3)= (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

Now, multiply all these together: 10 * 0.125 * 0.25.

Let me compute that step by step. 0.125 * 0.25 is 0.03125. Then, 10 * 0.03125 is 0.3125.

So the probability is 0.3125, which is 31.25%.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 5 choose 3 is 10, that's correct. Each head has a probability of 0.5, and each tail as well. So for each specific sequence with three heads and two tails, the probability is (0.5)^5, which is 1/32 or 0.03125. Since there are 10 such sequences, 10 * 0.03125 equals 0.3125, which is 31.25%.

Looking at the options, option G is 31.25 percent. So the correct answer should be G.

The probability of getting exactly three heads in five flips of a balanced coin is calculated using the binomial probability formula:

\[
P(k) = C(n, k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Here, \( n = 5 \) (flips), \( k = 3 \) (heads), and \( p = 0.5 \) (probability of heads). 

1. **Calculate the combination \( C(5, 3) \):**
   \[
   C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{120}{6 \cdot 2} = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate \( p^k \):**
   \[
   (0.5)^3 = 0.125
   \]

3. **Calculate \( (1-p)^{n-k} \):**
   \[
   (0.5)^2 = 0.25
   \]

4. **Multiply these values together:**
   \[
   P(3) = 10 \cdot 0.125 \cdot 0.25 = 0.3125
   \]

Thus, the probability is \( 31.25\% \), which corresponds to option **G**.
