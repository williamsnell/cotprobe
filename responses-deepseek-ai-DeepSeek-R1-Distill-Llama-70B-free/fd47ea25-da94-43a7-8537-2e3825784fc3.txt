Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let's see what I can do. The problem is about finding y0 such that the solution remains finite as t approaches infinity. The equation given is y' - y = 1 + 3 sin t, with the initial condition y(0) = y0.

Hmm, right. So I remember that linear differential equations like this can be solved using integrating factors. The standard form is y' + P(t) y = Q(t). In this case, though, it's y' - y = 1 + 3 sin t. So I can rewrite it as y' + (-1)y = 1 + 3 sin t. So P(t) is -1 and Q(t) is 1 + 3 sin t.

The integrating factor, mu(t), is usually e^(∫P(t) dt). So here, that would be e^(∫-1 dt) which is e^(-t). Multiplying both sides of the equation by this integrating factor would make the left side the derivative of (mu(t) y).

So let's do that. Multiply through by e^(-t):

e^(-t) y' - e^(-t) y = (1 + 3 sin t) e^(-t).

The left side should now be the derivative of (e^(-t) y) with respect to t. So we can write:

d/dt [e^(-t) y] = e^(-t) (1 + 3 sin t).

Now, to find y, I need to integrate both sides with respect to t. So integrating the left side from 0 to t gives e^(-t) y(t) - e^(0) y(0) = integral from 0 to t of e^(-tau) (1 + 3 sin tau) d tau.

Wait, but actually, integrating both sides over t would give:

∫ d/dt [e^(-t) y] dt = ∫ e^(-t) (1 + 3 sin t) dt.

So the left side is just e^(-t) y(t) + C. But since we're dealing with an initial condition, maybe I should consider definite integrals from 0 to t.

So, integrating from 0 to t:

e^(-t) y(t) - e^(0) y(0) = ∫ from 0 to t of e^(-tau) (1 + 3 sin tau) d tau.

So that's:

y(t) e^(-t) - y0 = ∫0^t e^(-tau) (1 + 3 sin tau) d tau.

To solve for y(t), multiply both sides by e^(t):

y(t) = y0 e^(t) + e^(t) ∫0^t e^(-tau) (1 + 3 sin tau) d tau.

Simplify the integral part:

e^(t) ∫0^t e^(-tau) (1 + 3 sin tau) d tau = ∫0^t e^(t - tau) (1 + 3 sin tau) d tau.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the integral first before proceeding. Let's compute the integral I(t) = ∫ e^(-tau) (1 + 3 sin tau) d tau.

I can split this into two parts: ∫e^(-tau) d tau + 3 ∫e^(-tau) sin tau d tau.

The first integral is straightforward. The integral of e^(-tau) d tau is -e^(-tau) + C.

The second integral, ∫e^(-tau) sin tau d tau, I remember there's a standard technique for integrating products of exponentials and trigonometric functions. Let me recall the formula.

I think the integral of e^{a tau} sin(b tau) d tau is e^{a tau} (a sin(b tau) - b cos(b tau)) / (a² + b²) ) + C.

In this case, a is -1 and b is 1. So substituting, the integral becomes:

e^{-tau} [ (-1) sin tau - (1) cos tau ] / ( (-1)^2 + 1^2 ) + C.

Simplify denominator: 1 + 1 = 2.

So the integral is e^{-tau} (-sin tau - cos tau) / 2 + C.

Putting it all together, the integral I(t) is:

- e^{-tau} + 3 * [ e^{-tau} (-sin tau - cos tau) ] / 2 + C.

Wait, let me make sure. The first integral was ∫e^{-tau} d tau, which is -e^{-tau} + C. The second integral is 3 times ∫e^{-tau} sin tau d tau, which is 3 times [ e^{-tau} (-sin tau - cos tau) / 2 ].

So putting it all together, I(t) is:

- e^{-tau} + (3/2) e^{-tau} (-sin tau - cos tau) + C.

Combine the terms:

Factor out e^{-tau}:

e^{-tau} [ -1 + (3/2)(-sin tau - cos tau) ] + C.

Simplify inside the brackets:

-1 - (3/2) sin tau - (3/2) cos tau.

So I(t) = e^{-tau} [ -1 - (3/2) sin tau - (3/2) cos tau ] + C.

Now, the definite integral from 0 to t:

I = [ e^{-t} ( -1 - (3/2) sin t - (3/2) cos t ) ] - [ e^{0} ( -1 - 0 - (3/2)(1) ) ].

Wait, because at tau=0, sin 0 is 0, cos 0 is 1. So plugging tau=0:

e^0 [ -1 - 0 - (3/2)(1) ] = 1*(-1 - 3/2 ) = -5/2.

So the integral from 0 to t is:

e^{-t} [ -1 - (3/2) sin t - (3/2) cos t ] - ( -5/2 ).

Which simplifies to:

- e^{-t} [ 1 + (3/2) sin t + (3/2) cos t ] + 5/2.

So going back to the expression for y(t):

y(t) = y0 e^{t} + e^{t} * [ I(t) ]

But wait, I think I might have made a miscalculation earlier. Wait, the integral I(t) is from 0 to t of e^{-tau}(1 + 3 sin tau) d tau, which we computed as:

I(t) = [ -e^{-tau} - (3/2)e^{-tau}(sin tau + cos tau) ] evaluated from 0 to t.

So at upper limit t:

- e^{-t} - (3/2)e^{-t}(sin t + cos t )

At lower limit 0:

- e^{0} - (3/2)e^0 (0 + 1) = -1 - 3/2 = -5/2.

So the definite integral is [ -e^{-t} - (3/2)e^{-t}(sin t + cos t) ] - [ -5/2 ].

Which is -e^{-t} [1 + (3/2)(sin t + cos t) ] + 5/2.

So then, the expression for y(t):

y(t) = y0 e^{t} + e^{t} * [ -e^{-t} (1 + (3/2)(sin t + cos t)) + 5/2 ]

Simplify this:

e^{t} multiplied by each term inside the brackets.

First term: e^{t} * (-e^{-t} ( ... )) becomes - (1 + (3/2)(sin t + cos t) )

Second term: e^{t} * (5/2) = (5/2) e^{t}.

So y(t) = y0 e^{t} - (1 + (3/2)(sin t + cos t )) + (5/2) e^{t}.

Combine like terms:

y(t) = [ y0 + 5/2 ] e^{t} - 1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t )

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Because:

y(t) = y0 e^t + [ - (1 + (3/2)(sin t + cos t) ) + (5/2) e^t ]

Because the integral part was that whole expression, and when multiplied by e^t, gives those two terms.

So y(t) = y0 e^t -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t) + (5/2) e^t.

So combining the e^t terms:

(y0 + 5/2) e^t -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t )

Wait, but I think I might have missed a negative sign in the integral expression. Let me recheck:

Wait, the integral I(t) was:

I(t) = [ -e^{-t} [1 + (3/2)(sin t + cos t) ] ] + 5/2.

Then, when you multiply I(t) by e^t, you get:

e^t * I(t) = - [1 + (3/2)(sin t + cos t) ] + (5/2) e^t.

Yes, that's correct.

So y(t) = y0 e^t + e^t I(t) becomes:

y(t) = y0 e^t + [ - (1 + (3/2)(sin t + cos t )) + (5/2) e^t ]

Thus,

y(t) = y0 e^t + (5/2) e^t -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t )

Combine the e^t terms: (y0 + 5/2) e^t.

So,

y(t) = (y0 + 5/2) e^t -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t )

Wait, but the problem states that the solution remains finite as t approaches infinity. So as t→∞, we need y(t) to be finite.

Now, let's look at each term in y(t):

The first term is (y0 + 5/2) e^t. As t→∞, e^t grows without bound unless the coefficient is zero. So for y(t) to remain finite, the coefficient of e^t must be zero. Otherwise, y(t) will blow up to infinity or negative infinity, depending on the sign.

So set (y0 + 5/2) = 0.

Solving for y0: y0 = -5/2.

Wait, wait. 5/2 is 2.5, so negative of that is -2.5.

Looking at the options, option F is -2.5.

So that's the value of y0 which ensures that the exponential term doesn't cause y(t) to blow up. The other terms are either constants or oscillatory (sin t and cos t), which are bounded as t→∞.

So the answer should be F: -2.5.

To solve the initial value problem 

\[
y' - y = 1 + 3 \sin t, \quad y(0) = y_0,
\]

we first rewrite it in standard linear form:

\[
y' + (-1)y = 1 + 3 \sin t.
\]

The integrating factor is 

\[
\mu(t) = e^{\int -1 \, dt} = e^{-t}.
\]

Multiplying through by \( e^{-t} \), the equation becomes:

\[
e^{-t} y' - e^{-t} y = e^{-t} (1 + 3 \sin t).
\]

The left-hand side is the derivative of \( e^{-t} y \), so we integrate both sides:

\[
\int_0^t \frac{d}{d\tau} \left( e^{-\tau} y(\tau) \right) d\tau = \int_0^t e^{-\tau} (1 + 3 \sin \tau) d\tau.
\]

This gives:

\[
e^{-t} y(t) - y(0) = \int_0^t e^{-\tau} (1 + 3 \sin \tau) d\tau.
\]

Multiplying through by \( e^t \):

\[
y(t) = y_0 e^t + e^t \int_0^t e^{-\tau} (1 + 3 \sin \tau) d\tau.
\]

The integral \( \int e^{-\tau} (1 + 3 \sin \tau) d\tau \) is computed as:

\[
\int e^{-\tau} d\tau + 3 \int e^{-\tau} \sin \tau d\tau.
\]

The first term is:

\[
\int e^{-\tau} d\tau = -e^{-\tau}.
\]

The second term is:

\[
\int e^{-\tau} \sin \tau d\tau = \frac{e^{-\tau}}{2} \left( -\sin \tau - \cos \tau \right).
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
-e^{-\tau} - \frac{3}{2} e^{-\tau} (\sin \tau + \cos \tau).
\]

Evaluating from \( 0 \) to \( t \), we get:

\[
\int_0^t e^{-\tau} (1 + 3 \sin \tau) d\tau = -e^{-t} \left( 1 + \frac{3}{2} (\sin t + \cos t) \right) + \frac{5}{2}.
\]

Substituting this back into the expression for \( y(t) \):

\[
y(t) = y_0 e^t + e^t \left[ -e^{-t} \left( 1 + \frac{3}{2} (\sin t + \cos t) \right) + \frac{5}{2} \right].
\]

Simplifying:

\[
y(t) = (y_0 + \frac{5}{2}) e^t - 1 - \frac{3}{2} (\sin t + \cos t).
\]

For \( y(t) \) to remain finite as \( t \to \infty \), the coefficient of the exponentially growing term \( e^t \) must be zero. This requires:

\[
y_0 + \frac{5}{2} = 0 \quad \implies \quad y_0 = -\frac{5}{2} = -2.5.
\]

Thus, the value of \( y_0 \) is \( -2.5 \), corresponding to option **F**.
