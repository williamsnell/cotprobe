Question:

John's Lawn Mowing Service is a small business that acts as a price-taker (i.e., MR = P). The prevailing market price of lawn mowing is $20 per acre. John's costs are given by total cost = 0.1q^2 + 10q + 50, where q = the number of acres John chooses to cut a day. Calculate John's maximum daily profit.

Options:

A: 200
B: 100
C: 175
D: 120
E: 150
F: 225
G: 300
H: 250
I: 130
J: 160

Okay, so I have this economics problem here about John's Lawn Mowing Service. He's a price-taker, which I think means he can't influence the market price, so his marginal revenue equals the market price. The market price is $20 per acre. His costs are given by the equation total cost = 0.1q² +10q +50, where q is the number of acres he mows each day. I need to find his maximum daily profit.

Alright, let's start by recalling what profit is. Profit is total revenue minus total cost. Since John is a price-taker, the price (P) is $20. So, total revenue (TR) would be P times q, which is 20*q.

Total revenue TR = 20q.

Total cost (TC) is given as 0.1q² +10q +50. So, to find profit, I subtract TC from TR.

Profit (π) = TR - TC = 20q - (0.1q² +10q +50).

Let me simplify that equation. 20q - 0.1q² -10q -50. Combining like terms: (20q-10q)=10q, so π = -0.1q² +10q -50.

Wait, that's a quadratic equation in terms of q. Because it's a quadratic, and the coefficient of q² is negative (-0.1), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex will be the maximum point. So, the vertex will give me the q that maximizes profit.

The vertex of a parabola given by ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a is -0.1 and b is 10.

So q = - (10) / [2*(-0.1)] = -10 / (-0.2) = 50. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2a would be 2*(-0.1) = -0.2. So -10 divided by -0.2 is 50? Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.

Wait, the equation for profit is π = -0.1q² +10q -50.

So a is -0.1, b is 10.

q = -b/(2a) = -(10)/(2*(-0.1)) = (-10)/(-0.2) = 50.

Hmm, 50 acres. That seems like a lot, but maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, I could have taken the derivative of the profit function with respect to q, set it to zero, and solve for q to find the maximum.

Let's try that. The derivative of π with respect to q is dπ/dq = -0.2q +10. Setting this equal to zero:

-0.2q +10 = 0 → -0.2q = -10 → q = (-10)/(-0.2) = 50. So same result. So q=50 acres.

Now, let's compute the profit at q=50.

π = -0.1*(50)^2 +10*(50) -50.

Calculating each term:

-0.1*(2500) = -250.

10*50=500.

So π = -250 +500 -50 = 200.

So profit is $200. Looking at the options, option A is 200. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the profit.

Wait, let's compute each term again.

At q=50:

Total revenue TR =20 *50 =1000.

Total cost TC =0.1*(50)^2 +10*(50) +50.

Calculating TC: 0.1*2500=250, 10*50=500. So 250 +500=750, plus 50 is 800.

So TC is $800.

Profit is TR - TC =1000 -800=200. Yes, same result.

So the maximum daily profit is $200, which is option A.
</think>

John's Lawn Mowing Service operates as a price-taker, meaning the market price per acre is $20, and marginal revenue (MR) equals price (P). The total cost (TC) is given by the equation:

\[
TC = 0.1q^2 + 10q + 50
\]

where \( q \) is the number of acres mowed per day. Total revenue (TR) is calculated as:

\[
TR = P \cdot q = 20q
\]

Profit (\( \pi \)) is defined as:

\[
\pi = TR - TC = 20q - (0.1q^2 + 10q + 50)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\pi = -0.1q^2 + 10q - 50
\]

This is a quadratic equation, and since the coefficient of \( q^2 \) is negative (\(-0.1\)), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex represents the maximum profit. The vertex of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at:

\[
q = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = -0.1 \) and \( b = 10 \), so:

\[
q = -\frac{10}{2(-0.1)} = \frac{-10}{-0.2} = 50
\]

Thus, \( q = 50 \) acres maximizes profit. Substituting \( q = 50 \) into the profit equation:

\[
\pi = -0.1(50)^2 + 10(50) - 50
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
-0.1(2500) = -250, \quad 10(50) = 500, \quad \text{and the constant term is } -50
\]

So:

\[
\pi = -250 + 500 - 50 = 200
\]

Therefore, John's maximum daily profit is $200. This corresponds to option A.
