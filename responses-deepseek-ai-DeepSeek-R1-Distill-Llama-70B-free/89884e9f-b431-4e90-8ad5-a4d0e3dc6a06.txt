Alright, so I've got this question about inventory valuation methods, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question gives data for the Bears Company's inventory in 19X8. They have beginning inventory and six purchases, each with a different number of units and costs. Then, they sold 34 units. I need to find the ending inventory under three different methods: weighted average, LIFO, and FIFO. The answer options are given from A to J, each with three values corresponding to each method.

Okay, so I think the first thing I should do is calculate the total units available for sale and then determine how many units remain in ending inventory. Let's add up all the units they had.

Beginning inventory is 10 units. Then the purchases are 7, 5, 8, 4, 10, 6. Let me add those up: 7+5=12, +8=20, +4=24, +10=34, +6=40. So total purchases add up to 40 units. Adding the beginning inventory, that's 10 + 40 = 50 units available.

They sold 34 units, so ending inventory is 50 -34 = 16 units. So regardless of the method, we're looking at 16 units remaining.

Now, I need to calculate the value of these 16 units under each method.

Starting with weighted average. I think the weighted average cost is calculated by taking the total cost of all units available divided by the total number of units.

Let me calculate the total cost. The beginning inventory is 10 units at $8, so that's 10 * 8 = $80.

First purchase: 7 units at $9 → 7 *9=63
Second purchase:5 *9=45
Third purchase:8*11=88
Fourth:4*10=40
Fifth:10*12=120
Sixth:6*12.50=75.

Adding all these up: 80 +63=143, +45=188, +88=276, +40=316, +120=436, +75=511. So total cost is $511.

Total units are 50. So weighted average cost per unit is 511 /50. Let me compute that. 50*10=500, so 511/50=10.22. So approximately $10.22 per unit.

So ending inventory under weighted average would be 16 *10.22. Let's compute that. 16 *10=160, 16*0.22=3.52, so total is 163.52. Wait, but looking at the options, some have exact decimals. So maybe it's exactly 16*(511/50). 511/50 is 10.22, so 16*10.22=163.52. So option H is $163.84, which is close but not exact. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 511 divided by 50 exactly. 50 * 10 = 500, remainder 11. So 11/50 is 0.22. So 10.22 exactly. So 16 *10.22 is 163.52. None of the options have 163.52 except possibly H, which is 163.84. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the total cost?

Let me recheck the total cost:

Beginning: 10 *8 = 80

1st purchase:7*9=63 → 80+63=143

2nd:5*9=45 → 143+45=188

3rd:8*11=88 → 188+88=276

4th:4*10=40 → 276+40=316

5th:10*12=120 → 316+120=436

6th:6*12.50=75 →436+75=511. So that's correct.

So 16 * 10.22 = 163.52. Looking at the options, none of the options have exactly 163.52. Wait, option H is 163.84, which is a bit higher. Did I calculate the average wrong?

Wait, maybe the weighted average is calculated differently. Oh wait, perhaps in some cases, the beginning inventory is treated as part of the first purchase? Or maybe I'm confusing the methods. Alternatively, perhaps the total units or total cost is wrong.

Wait, let me double-check the units. Beginning inventory is 10. Then the six purchases:7,5,8,4,10,6. 7+5=12, +8=20, +4=24, +10=34, +6=40. So 10+40=50 units. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps in the weighted average, the beginning inventory is considered as part of the average, which I did include. So 10 units are part of the 50. So 16 units at 10.22 each is 163.52. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Option H is $163.84, which is 16 * 10.24. Wait, maybe I computed the total cost wrong. Did I add correctly?

Wait, 10*8=80, 7*9=63 (80+63=143), 5*9=45 (143+45=188), 8*11=88 (188+88=276), 4*10=40 (276+40=316), 10*12=120 (316+120=436), 6*12.5=75 (436+75=511). That seems right. So 511/50=10.22. So 16*10.22=163.52.

Hmm, now looking at the options, option H is (a) $163.84, (b) $134, (c) $195. So (a) is 163.84, which is close to my 163.52. Maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is precise. 511 divided by 50 is 10.22, but perhaps it's 10.22 exactly, which when multiplied by 16 gives 163.52. But none of the options have this. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects rounding to the nearest cent, but that still doesn't give 163.84.

Alternatively, perhaps the beginning inventory is treated differently. Wait, perhaps in some methods, the beginning inventory is treated as a separate layer. But no, in weighted average, all units are pooled.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of units. Let me check again: 10 beginning, 7,5,8,4,10,6. 7+5=12, +8=20, +4=24, +10=34, +6=40. 10+40=50. Correct.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, the units sold are 34, so maybe in FIFO, the earliest units are sold first. But that's for FIFO and LIFO. Weighted average is just total cost over total units.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the other methods and see if any option matches. Let me try FIFO.

In FIFO, the oldest units are sold first. So to find the ending inventory, I need to see which units remain after selling 34.

The sequence of units is: beginning 10, then first purchase 7, second 5, third 8, fourth 4, fifth 10, sixth 6.

So the order of units available for sale is: 10 (beginning), then 7,5,8,4,10,6.

They sold 34 units. So we take from the earliest units first.

So first, the beginning 10 are sold. Then, the first purchase of 7, then 5, etc.

Let's track how many are sold:

- Sold 10 from beginning, 34 left to sell.
- Then 7 from first purchase: 10+7=17 sold, 34-17=17 left.
- Then 5 from second purchase: 17+5=22, 34-22=12 left.
- Then 8 from third purchase: 12 taken from here, so 8-12? Wait, no, we take all 8 from third purchase, which brings total sold to 22+8=30. Now, 34-30=4 left to sell.
- Next is the fourth purchase of 4 units. So take all 4, which brings total sold to 34.

So the units sold are: 10 (beginning) +7+5+8+4=34.

So the remaining units are from the fifth and sixth purchases.

Fifth purchase:10 units, sixth:6 units.

After selling 34, the remaining are: the fifth purchase's entire 10 units and the sixth purchase's 6 units. Wait, no, because after selling 34, which includes 10+7+5+8+4=34, so the remaining units are the fifth purchase (10) and sixth (6). So 16 units in ending inventory, which matches our earlier calculation.

But in FIFO, the ending inventory is made up of the latest purchases. So the cost of ending inventory is the cost of the most recent units.

So to find the value, we take the fifth purchase and sixth purchase.

Wait, no. Wait, the units remaining after FIFO would be the fifth purchase's 10 units and the sixth's 6 units, because after selling 34, which took all of the earlier units up to the fourth purchase. So the remaining 16 are the fifth (10 units at $12 each) and sixth (6 units at $12.50 each).

So their costs are:

10 *12 = 120

6 *12.50 = 75

Total FIFO ending inventory cost: 120 +75 = 195.

Wait, looking at the options, part (c) is FIFO. So in option H, (c) is 195. So that's a match.

Now, the other parts: (a) is weighted average which I thought was 163.52, but option H has (a) 163.84. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the total cost precisely. Let me add all the costs again.

10 units at 8: 80.

7*9=63 → 80+63=143.

5*9=45 → 143+45=188.

8*11=88 → 188+88=276.

4*10=40 → 276+40=316.

10*12=120 → 316+120=436.

6*12.50=75 → 436+75=511. So total is 511.

So 511 /50 = 10.22. So 16 *10.22 = 163.52.

So option H's (a) is 163.84, which is 16 * 10.24. Hmm, maybe I should check if I missed some cost somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the beginning inventory is considered as a separate item. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses periodic inventory system, so beginning inventory plus purchases are all part of the average. That's what I did, though.

Alternatively, maybe the question uses a different method, like excluding beginning inventory, but that doesn't make sense. Weighted average should include all units.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in adding. Let me check each step again.

10 units at 8: 80.

7*9=63 → correct.

5*9=45 → correct.

8*11=88 → correct.

4*10=40 → correct.

10*12=120 → correct.

6*12.50=75 → correct.

Summing them: 80 +63 =143; +45=188; +88=276; +40=316; +120=436; +75=511. Yes, 511.

So 511/50=10.22 exactly. So 16 *10.22=163.52. So perhaps the options rounded differently, but none match exactly. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option H: (a)163.84, (b)134, (c)195.

So (c) is 195, which matches FIFO. (b) is 134, which I need to calculate for LIFO.

Wait, LIFO is the opposite of FIFO. In LIFO, the most recent units are sold first. So when they sold 34 units, the latest units are sold first.

So let's track which units are sold and which remain.

The order of units available is beginning, then 1st purchase, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th.

In LIFO, when selling, you take from the most recent first.

So the units available are:

6th purchase:6 units,

5th:10,

4th:4,

3rd:8,

2nd:5,

1st:7,

beginning:10.

But in LIFO, you sell the latest units first. So the first units sold would be from the sixth purchase (6 units), then fifth (10), then fourth (4), etc., until 34 are sold.

So let's see:

Total to sell:34.

First, take all from sixth purchase:6 → sold 6, remaining to sell:34-6=28.

Then fifth purchase:10 → sold 10, total sold 16, remaining 34-16=18.

Then fourth purchase:4 → sold 4, total 20, remaining 14.

Third purchase:8 → sold 8, total 28, remaining 6.

Second purchase:5 → can't take all, take 5? Wait, no, remaining to sell is 6. So take 5 from second purchase, but that would leave 1 more to sell. Wait, no, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, let me list the units in reverse order (since LIFO sells the most recent first):

6th:6,

5th:10,

4th:4,

3rd:8,

2nd:5,

1st:7,

beginning:10.

Now, selling 34:

Take 6 from 6th → sold 6, left 34-6=28.

Take 10 from 5th → sold 16, left 28-10=18.

Take 4 from 4th → sold 20, left 18-4=14.

Take 8 from 3rd → sold 28, left 14-8=6.

Now, take 5 from 2nd → but we only need 6-5=1 more unit. So from the 2nd purchase, we take 5 units, but wait, that would be 5 units, making total sold 28+5=33. Then we need 1 more unit, which comes from the 1st purchase of 7 units.

So from 1st purchase, take 1 unit, leaving 7-1=6 units in 1st purchase.

So the units sold are 6 (6th) +10 (5th)+4 (4th)+8 (3rd)+5 (2nd)+1 (1st) = 6+10=16+4=20+8=28+5=33+1=34.

So the remaining units are:

beginning:10,

1st purchase:7-1=6,

2nd purchase:5-5=0,

3rd:8-8=0,

4th:4-4=0,

5th:10-10=0,

6th:6-6=0.

Wait no, in LIFO, the remaining units are the earliest ones. Because the latest units are sold first, so what's left is the beginning and the first purchase's remaining.

Wait, in this case, the beginning inventory of 10 units and the 1st purchase's 6 units (since 1 was sold) would remain. So ending inventory is 10 +6=16 units, which matches.

So the cost of ending inventory under LIFO would be:

beginning:10 units at $8 each → 10*8=80.

1st purchase:6 units remaining at $9 each →6*9=54.

So total is 80+54=134. So LIFO ending inventory is $134.

Now, looking back at the options, option H's (b) is 134. So that matches.

So summarizing:

(a) Weighted average: 163.52 → but option H says 163.84.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the math again.

Wait, 16 * (511/50) = 16*(10.22) = 163.52. So perhaps the correct option is H, but the (a) value is 163.84. Wait, that's a discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different calculation for weighted average, such as not including the beginning inventory in the average. Let me try that.

If I exclude the beginning inventory from the average, then the total cost would be only the purchases: 7+5+8+4+10+6=40 units. Let's calculate their cost.

7*9=63, 5*9=45, 8*11=88, 4*10=40, 10*12=120, 6*12.5=75.

Adding these: 63+45=108, +88=196, +40=236, +120=356, +75=431.

So total cost of purchases is 431.

Total units purchased:40.

Average cost:431/40=10.775.

Then, the beginning inventory is 10 units at $8, so their cost is 80.

So the total cost for all units would be 80 (beginning) +431 (purchases) =511, same as before.

Wait, but if we use the weighted average including beginning inventory, it's 511/50=10.22, which gives 163.52. So I'm not sure why option H has 163.84.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like computing the average without the beginning inventory and then applying it to all units. But that doesn't make sense because beginning inventory is part of the total.

Wait, maybe I should check if any option has (a)=163.52. Looking at the options, none do except perhaps none. Wait, option H has (a) 163.84, which is 16 * 10.24.

Hmm, perhaps the total cost is 512 instead of 511. Let me check again.

Wait, 6*12.50=75. 75 is correct.

Wait, 5*9=45, 7*9=63. 8*11=88. 4*10=40. 10*12=120.

80 (beginning) +63=143, +45=188, +88=276, +40=316, +120=436, +75=511. So 511 is correct
