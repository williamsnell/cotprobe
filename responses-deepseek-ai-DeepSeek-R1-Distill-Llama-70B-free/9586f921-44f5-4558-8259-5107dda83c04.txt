Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diffraction grating. The setup is that a light source's spectrum has lines and bands stretching from a wavelength of 5.0e-5 cm to 7.5e-5 cm. When this light illuminates a diffraction grating normally, two adjacent spectra just overlap, and the junction is at 45 degrees. I need to find the number of lines per centimeter on the grating.

Hmm, right. I remember that diffraction gratings produce multiple spectra due to interference. The overlapping of adjacent spectra implies that at a certain angle, the maxima from one order meet the maxima from another order.

Wait, the key here is that when the two adjacent spectra just overlap, the highest order maximum of the shorter wavelength overlaps with the next order maximum of the longer wavelength. Or something like that. Let me think.

The diffraction grating equation is d sinθ = mλ, where d is the distance between grating lines (so 1/d is the lines per cm), θ is the angle, m is the order, and λ is the wavelength.

In this case, the two adjacent spectra overlapping would mean that for one wavelength (like the shortest, λ1), the maximum order m1, and for another wavelength (the longest, λ2), the maximum order m2, such that at the same angle θ, they coincide.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the junction occurs at 45 degrees. So at θ=45°, the maximum of one order for the lower wavelength equals the maximum of the next order for the higher wavelength.

Wait, let me clarify. The shortest wavelength is λ_min = 5e-5 cm, and the longest is λ_max =7.5e-5 cm. So when the light is diffracted, each wavelength will have its own set of maxima.

The problem states that two adjacent spectra overlap. So, perhaps the highest order (m) of the shortest wavelength equals the next order (m+1) of the longest wavelength at that angle. Because if m_max for λ_min is the same as (m+1) for λ_max, then at that angle, the two maxima coincide, leading to the spectra overlapping.

So, setting up the equations:

For λ_min: d sinθ = m λ_min
For λ_max: d sinθ = (m+1) λ_max

Because at the same angle θ, both equations must hold. So, substituting:

m λ_min = (m+1) λ_max

Wait, but wait, no, because both are equal to d sinθ. So:

m λ_min = (m+1) λ_max

So let's write that equation:

m * λ_min = (m + 1) * λ_max

We can solve for m here.

λ_min = 5e-5 cm
λ_max = 7.5e-5 cm

So substituting in:

m * 5e-5 = (m +1)*7.5e-5

Divide both sides by e-5 to simplify:

m *5 = (m+1)*7.5

Expand the right side:

5m = 7.5m + 7.5

Bring terms together:

5m -7.5m = 7.5

-2.5m =7.5 → m= 7.5 / (-2.5) → m= -3.

Wait, that can't be right. m must be a positive integer. Hmm. Did I set up the equation correctly?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the orders. Maybe the highest order of λ_max is m, and the next order of λ_min is m+1. Or is it the other way around?

Let me think again. When the two spectra just overlap, the maximum order for the longer wavelength (λ_max) would be when m_max is such that d sinθ = m_max λ_max.

Similarly, the maximum order for the shorter wavelength (λ_min) would be m_max' such that d sinθ = m_max' λ_min.

But at the point where the two spectra just overlap, the maximum order for the longer wavelength occurs at the same angle as the (m_max' +1) order for the shorter wavelength.

Wait no, perhaps the maximum order of the longer wavelength is m, and the next order (m+1) of the shorter wavelength is beyond, but they are overlapping. So perhaps at the point where the overlap happens, the maximum order of the longer wavelength (m) is equal to the (m+1)th order of the shorter wavelength.

So, setting m λ_max = (m+1) λ_min.

Wait, let me try that.

So m λ_max = (m+1) λ_min

Plugging in the numbers:

m * 7.5e-5 = (m +1) *5e-5

Divide both sides by e-5:

7.5 m =5(m+1)

7.5m =5m +5 → 2.5m=5 → m=2.

Ah, that makes sense. So m=2.

So substituting back, for the longer wavelength (7.5e-5 cm), the maximum order is m=2. For the shorter wavelength, the order is m+1=3.

So now, we can use the diffraction equation to find d.

Using the longer wavelength at m=2:

d sinθ = m λ_max

θ is 45 degrees. So sin(45) is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

So,

d = (m λ_max) / sinθ

Plugging numbers in:

m=2, λ_max=7.5e-5 cm.

So d = (2 *7.5e-5) / (√2/2) → 15e-5 / (√2/2) = 15e-5 * 2 /√2 = (30e-5) / 1.4142 ≈ 21.213e-5 cm.

Wait, let's compute that accurately.

Wait, 7.5e-5 cm is 7.5 x 10^-5 cm. So,

d = (2 * 7.5e-5) / (sin45) = (15e-5) / (√2/2) )= 15e-5 * 2 / √2 = 30e-5 / 1.4142.

Compute 30e-5: that's 3e-4 cm.

3e-4 / 1.4142 ≈ 2.1213e-4 cm.

Wait, 3e-4 is 0.0003 cm. Divided by 1.4142 gives approx 0.00021213 cm.

So d ≈ 2.1213e-4 cm per line.

But the question asks for lines per centimeter, which is 1/d, so 1/d in cm^-1.

1 / (2.1213e-4 cm) = approximately 4715.6 lines per cm.

Looking at the options, option J is 4715 per cm. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the setup. Because I considered that m λ_max = (m+1) λ_min, which led me to m=2, and then using that to find d. Then, 1/d is the lines per cm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the maximum order for the longer wavelength and the next order for the shorter wavelength, but perhaps I got that right.

Another way: for the same angle, the two wavelengths are at their respective maximum orders. So,

d sinθ = m λ_min
d sinθ = (m+1) λ_max

Wait, earlier I thought that m λ_min = (m+1) λ_max, but that led to a negative m, which didn't make sense. So perhaps the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have:

d sinθ = (m) λ_min   --> (1)
d sinθ = (m+1) λ_max --> (2)

So from (1) and (2):

m λ_min = (m+1) λ_max.

So, same as before, which led to m=2.

Yes, same result. So that's correct.

So, calculating d = (m λ_min) / sinθ.

Wait, wait, because equation (1) is d sinθ = m λ_min.

Wait, but no, in equation (2), d sinθ = (m+1) λ_max.

Wait, no, because equation (1) is m λ_min, equation (2) is (m+1) lambda_max. So,

m lambda_min = (m+1) lambda_max.

Which gives m=2.

So, using equation (2): d sinθ = (m+1) lambda_max.

m+1 is 3.

So d sinθ = 3 * 7.5e-5 cm.

sinθ is sin45 = sqrt(2)/2.

So d = (3 *7.5e-5) / (sqrt(2)/2 )

= 22.5e-5 * 2 / 1.4142

= 45e-5 / 1.4142 ≈ 31.83e-5 cm.

Wait, but earlier I got d=2.1213e-4 cm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation steps.

Wait, let's recompute.

Using equation (2): d sinθ = (m+1) λ_max.

m=2, so (m+1)=3.

So,

d = [3 * 7.5e-5 cm ] / sin(45)

Sin(45)=sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071.

So,

3 *7.5e-5 = 22.5e-5 cm.

Divide that by 0.7071:

22.5e-5 / 0.7071 ≈ 31.82e-5 cm.

So d≈3.182e-4 cm.

Wait, but earlier when I used equation (1), m=2, lambda_min=5e-5, so:

d = (2 *5e-5) / 0.7071 ≈10e-5 /0.7071≈1.4142e-4 cm.

Wait, that's a discrepancy. That can't be. Which one is correct?

Wait, I'm getting mixed results because perhaps I messed up the equations.

Wait, perhaps I should equate the two expressions of d from both equations.

From equation (1): d = m lambda_min / sin theta.

From equation (2): d = (m+1) lambda_max / sin theta.

So, both equal to d, so:

m lambda_min = (m+1) lambda_max.

Which gives m=2 as before.

Now, computing d from equation (1):

d = (m lambda_min)/ sin theta = (2 *5e-5 cm) / (sqrt(2)/2 )

So, 10e-5 / (0.7071) = approx 14.142e-5 cm.

Wait, 10e-5 is 1e-4, so 1e-4 /0.7071 is approx 1.414e-4 cm.

Wait, that's 1.414e-4 cm per line.

So lines per cm is 1/d = 1 / 1.414e-4 cm = approx 7071 lines/cm.

But that's not one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

Wait, let's compute d correctly.

From equation (1): d = (m lambda_min) / sin(theta).

m=2, lambda_min=5e-5 cm.

sin(theta)=sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071.

So,

d = (2 *5e-5) / 0.7071 = (1e-4) / 0.7071.

1e-4 is 0.0001.

So 0.0001 / 0.7071 ≈ 0.00014142 cm.

Which is 1.4142e-4 cm.

So 1/d is 1 / (1.4142e-4) cm^-1.

1 / 1.4142e-4 = approx 7070.7 cm^-1. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option B:5000, option J:4715, option D:4500.

Wait, but earlier I got a different answer when using equation (2). Let's see:

Using equation (2): d = (3 *7.5e-5) / 0.7071.

3 *7.5e-5 =22.5e-5 = 2.25e-4.

2.25e-4 / 0.7071 ≈3.182e-4 cm.

So 1/d is 1/(3.182e-4) ≈ 3145.9 cm^-1, which is about 3146 lines/cm, which isn't any of the options either.

Wait, this is confusing. I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me recall that when two adjacent spectra just overlap, the maximum angle for the lower wavelength (lambda_min) is equal to the first order maximum (m=1) of the longer wavelength (lambda_max). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the overlapping occurs when the highest order of the longer wavelength coincides with the next order of the shorter. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition for two adjacent spectra to just overlap is that the (m_max +1) order for one wavelength equals the m_max order for another.

Wait, perhaps the maximum order of the longer wavelength is m, and the next order (m+1) of the shorter wavelength would be beyond that, but at the overlapping point, (m+1)lambda_short = m lambda_long.

Which brings us back to the same equation as before: (m+1) lambda_min = m lambda_max.

So, (m+1)/m = lambda_max/lambda_min.

So,

(m+1)/m = (7.5e-5)/(5e-5) = 1.5.

So,

1 + 1/m = 1.5 → 1/m = 0.5 → m=2.

So, m=2.

Then, using the longer wavelength's equation, lambda_max = 7.5e-5 cm, m=2.

So, d sinθ = 2 * 7.5e-5 cm.

sinθ is sin45 ≈0.7071.

So,

d = (2 *7.5e-5) / 0.7071 = (15e-5) / 0.7071 ≈21.213e-5 cm.

Wait, 15e-5 is 1.5e-4 cm. Dividing by 0.7071 gives approximately 2.1213e-4 cm.

So d ≈2.1213e-4 cm per line.

Thus, lines per cm is 1/d = 1/(2.1213e-4 cm) ≈4715.5 cm^-1.

Looking at the options, option J is 4715 per cm, which matches.

So, the correct answer is J.
</think>

To determine the number of lines per centimeter on the diffraction grating, we use the diffraction grating equation:

\[
d \sin\theta = m \lambda
\]

where:
- \(d\) is the distance between adjacent grating lines,
- \(\theta\) is the angle of diffraction,
- \(m\) is the order of the diffraction maximum,
- \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light.

### Key Information:
1. The spectrum ranges from \(\lambda_{\text{min}} = 5.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\) to \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = 7.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\).
2. Two adjacent spectra overlap at \(\theta = 45^\circ\), meaning the highest order maximum of \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) coincides with the next order maximum of \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\).

### Step 1: Relating the Orders and Wavelengths
At the overlap, we have:
\[
m \lambda_{\text{max}} = (m+1) \lambda_{\text{min}}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = 7.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\) and \(\lambda_{\text{min}} = 5.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\):
\[
m (7.5 \times 10^{-5}) = (m+1) (5.0 \times 10^{-5})
\]

Simplify:
\[
7.5m = 5.0(m+1)
\]

\[
7.5m = 5.0m + 5.0
\]

\[
2.5m = 5.0
\]

\[
m = 2
\]

Thus, the highest order for \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) is \(m = 2\), and the next order for \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) is \(m+1 = 3\).

### Step 2: Calculate \(d\) Using the Diffraction Grating Equation
Using the equation for \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) at \(m = 2\):
\[
d \sin\theta = m \lambda_{\text{max}}
\]

Substitute \(\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.7071\), \(m = 2\), and \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = 7.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\):
\[
d (0.7071) = 2 (7.5 \times 10^{-5})
\]

\[
d = \frac{2 (7.5 \times 10^{-5})}{0.7071}
\]

\[
d = \frac{15.0 \times 10^{-5}}{0.7071}
\]

\[
d \approx 21.213 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Lines Per Centimeter
The number of lines per centimeter is the reciprocal of \(d\):
\[
\text{Lines per cm} = \frac{1}{d}
\]

\[
\text{Lines per cm} = \frac{1}{21.213 \times 10^{-5}}
\]

\[
\text{Lines
