Okay, so I've got this question about a cumulative compound motor, and I'm a bit rusty on my motor theory, but let's try to work through this. Hmm, cumulative compound motors have both series and shunt windings, right? And in cumulative compounding, the series and shunt fields are connected so that their fluxes add up. That means when the armature current increases, the series field current increases, which in turn increases the flux.

The question says that the armature current varies from 50 amps to 100 amps. For each 10 amps change in armature current, the air-gap flux changes by 3%. Wait, so the series field current is causing the flux to change. Since the flux is proportional to the series current, right? So for each 10 A increase in armature current, the flux increases by 3%. 

Wait, but in a compound motor, the series field current is the same as the armature current, right? Because the series field is in series with the armature. So when the armature current increases, the series current increases. So each 10 A increase in armature current leads to a 3% increase in flux. 

So the problem is asking for the ratio of the torques at 100 A and 50 A. Torque in a motor is generally proportional to the armature current multiplied by the flux. But wait, for a compound motor, the torque equation would be a bit more involved because the flux isn't constant—it depends on the series current.

So, torque T is proportional to I_a * φ, where I_a is armature current and φ is the flux. But wait, in a compound motor, the flux isn't just from the shunt field; the series field contributes as well. But in cumulative compounding, the total flux is the sum of shunt and series flux.

Wait, but the problem says that the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10 A change in armature current. So let me think. Let's model the flux as a function of armature current. 

Let me denote I as the armature current. The flux φ is proportional to the series field current, which is the same as the armature current. So φ = k * I, but wait, in cumulative compounding, the flux is sum of shunt and series. Oh wait, no—wait, perhaps the shunt field provides a base flux, and the series adds to it. So maybe the total flux is φ = φ_shunt + φ_series. But the problem states that the series-field current causes the flux to change by 3% per 10 A. So perhaps the base flux is provided by the shunt field, and the series field adds an incremental flux on top of that.

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous on that. Alternatively, perhaps for a cumulative compound motor, the flux is the sum of the shunt flux and the series flux. Since the shunt flux is constant (because shunt current is from a constant voltage source), and the series flux varies with armature current. But wait, the way the question is phrased, it's the series-field current that causes the flux to change. So perhaps the shunt flux is negligible, or perhaps it's a different setup. Hmm, maybe for simplicity, we can model the flux as proportional to the series current, which is the same as the armature current.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model how flux changes with current. Let's say that when the armature current is I_a, the series current is I_a (since it's a series field). The flux increases by 3% for each 10 A increase in I_a. So for each 10 A, flux goes up by 3% of its current value, or is the 3% of the initial flux?

Wait, the way it's phrased: "the air-gap flux changes by 3 percent for each 10 amp of armature current". So for each 10 A increase, flux increases by 3% from its previous value. So it's a multiplicative change. So it's exponential growth in flux with armature current.

Wait, let me think. For example, if I_a increases by 10 A, flux increases by 3%. So the flux becomes 103% of its previous value. So if I_a goes from 50 to 60 to 70, etc., each step increases flux by 3%.

So let's model the flux at each I_a. Let's say φ1 is the flux when I_a = 50 A, and φ2 is the flux at 100 A.

The change from 50 to 100 A is 50 A. So in steps of 10 A each, that's 5 steps: 50→60→70→80→90→100. For each step, flux increases by 3%, so after each step, flux is multiplied by 1.03.

So the flux at 100 A would be φ1 * (1.03)^5.

Similarly, the flux at 50 A is just φ1.

Now, torque is proportional to I_a * φ. So torque T is proportional to I_a * φ.

So at I_a1 = 50 A, T1 ∝ 50 * φ1.

At I_a2 = 100 A, T2 ∝ 100 * φ2 = 100 * φ1*(1.03)^5.

So the ratio T2/T1 is [100 * φ1 * (1.03)^5] / [50 * φ1] ] = (100/50) * (1.03)^5 = 2 * (1.03)^5.

Now compute (1.03)^5. Let's see:

(1.03)^1 = 1.03

(1.03)^2 = 1.03 * 1.03 = approx 1.0609

(1.03)^3 = 1.0609 * 1.03 ≈ 1.0927

(1.03)^4 ≈ 1.0927 * 1.03 ≈ 1.1255

(1.03)^5 ≈ 1.1255 * 1.03 ≈ 1.1593

So (1.03)^5 ≈ 1.1593.

So T2/T1 ≈ 2 * 1.1593 ≈ 2.3186.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options:

A: 2.26

B: 0.66

C: 3.95

D:1.00

E:2.89

F:1.75

G:4.12

H:1.15

I:0.87

J:3.40

Wait, my calculation is about 2.3186, which is closest to 2.26 (option A). But let me check my math again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of steps. From 50 to 100 is 5 steps (each 10 A), so exponents 5, that's correct.

Wait, but what if the flux change is 3% per 10 A of the original flux, not multiplicative each time? That would be different. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: perhaps the flux changes by 3% of the initial value for each 10 A. So for 50 A, initial flux is φ. Then each 10 A adds 0.03φ.

Wait, but that would be a linear change. Let me see.

If I_a =50 A, flux φ1 = φ0 + (50 A /10 A) * 0.03φ0? That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the flux at any current I is φ = φ0 (1 + 0.03*(I/10)).

Wait, but the question says the flux changes by 3% for each 10 A. So for each 10 A increase, flux increases by 3% of its current value, which would be exponential.

Wait, perhaps the correct assumption is that each 10 A increase in armature current causes a 3% increase in flux from its current value. So, for each 10 A, it's a 3% multiplicative increase.

So, going from 50 to 60A, flux becomes 1.03 times higher than at 50. From 60 to70, another 3% increase, so 1.03^2 times 50A flux, etc.

So, for 100 A, it's 5 steps of 10 A above 50 A, so flux is (1.03)^5 times the flux at 50 A.

So torque is I_a * flux.

So torque at 50 A is T1 = 50 * φ.

Torque at 100 A is T2 =100 * φ*(1.03)^5.

So ratio T2/T1 = (100/50) * (1.03)^5 = 2 * approx 1.159.

Which is 2.318.

Looking at the options, the closest is A: 2.26. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.03)^5 more accurately.

Let me compute (1.03)^5 more precisely.

1.03^1 = 1.03

1.03^2 = 1.03 * 1.03 = 1.0609

1.03^3 = 1.0609 * 1.03. Let's compute 1.0609 *1.03.

1.0609 * 1 =1.0609

1.0609 *0.03 =0.031827

Sum: 1.0609 + 0.031827=1.092727.

1.03^3=1.092727.

1.03^4 = 1.092727 *1.03.

Compute 1.092727 *1.03:

1 *1.092727 =1.092727

0.03 *1.092727=0.03278181.

Sum: 1.092727 +0.03278181=1.12550881.

So 1.03^4≈1.12550881.

1.03^5=1.12550881 *1.03.

Compute 1.12550881 *1.03.

1 *1.12550881 =1.12550881

0.03 *1.12550881=0.033765.

Sum: 1.12550881 +0.033765≈1.15927381.

So (1.03)^5≈1.15927.

So T2/T1 = 2 *1.15927 ≈2.3185.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2.26, which is close but not exact. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the torque is proportional to I_a^2 times flux? Because I recall that in some motor calculations, torque is proportional to I_a times flux, but in series motors, torque is proportional to I_a^2, since flux is proportional to I_a. But wait, in this case, flux isn't proportional to I_a. Because the flux is changing by 3% per 10 A, which is a different relationship.

Wait, let me think again. In a series motor, flux is proportional to I_a, so torque T = k * I_a^2. But in a shunt motor, flux is constant, so T =k * I_a. But this is a compound motor, so it's a mix.

Wait, in a cumulative compound motor, the flux is the sum of the shunt flux and the series flux. So, φ_total = φ_shunt + φ_series. φ_shunt is approximately constant (since shunt current is constant), and φ_series is proportional to I_a (since series current is I_a).

So, T is proportional to I_a * φ_total.

So, T = k * I_a (φ_shunt + k1 * I_a).

But wait, the problem states that the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10 amp of armature current. So perhaps the base flux (when I_a =0?) is from the shunt field, and the series adds to it. Let me denote:

φ_total = φ_shunt + Δφ.

Where Δφ is the change due to series current. Each 10 A increase in I_a causes a 3% increase in Δφ? Or in the total flux?

Wait, the problem says, "the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10 amp of armature current." So for each 10 A, the flux increases by 3% of its current value. So it's a percentage change relative to the current value, implying exponential growth.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 3% increase in the flux per 10 A. So, for I_a1 =50 A and I_a2=100 A, the flux change would be calculated based on the number of 10 A increments.

But perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think of it another way: maybe the flux is proportional to the series current, which is I_a. Because in a series motor, flux is proportional to I_a.

Wait, but in that case, φ = k * I_a, so torque T = I_a * φ = k * I_a^2. So T is proportional to I_a squared. So if I_a doubles from 50 to 100 A, torque would increase by a factor of (100/50)^2 =4.

But wait, that's not considering the change in flux. Because in this problem, the flux changes by 3% for each 10 A, which suggests that the flux isn't linearly proportional to I_a.

Wait, maybe the flux is proportional to the logarithm of I_a. Because a 3% increase per 10 A step suggests continuous exponential growth.

Let me think: if for each 10 A increase, flux increases by 3%, then flux as a function of I_a is φ(I_a) = φ_0 * (1.03)^(I_a/10).

Assuming that at I_a=0, φ=φ_0. But in reality, at I_a=0, the series field contributes nothing, so φ=φ_shunt. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things again.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the flux as increasing by 3% for each 10 A, starting from a base flux. Let's say at I_a =50 A, the flux is φ1. Then, each 10 A increase leads to a 3% increase in flux from the previous value. So at I_a =60 A, flux is 1.03 * φ1; at 70 A, it's (1.03)^2 φ1; and so on until 100 A, which is (1.03)^5 φ1.

So torque at I_a is proportional to I_a * φ(I_a).

At 50 A: T1 ∝ 50 * φ1.

At 100 A: T2 ∝100 * (1.03)^5 * φ1.

So the ratio T2/T1 is (100/50) * (1.03)^5 = 2 * (approx 1.15927) ≈2.3185.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:2.26, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.03)^5.

Wait, let me compute (1.03)^5 more accurately using a calculator approach.

1.03^1 = 1.03

1.03^2 = 1.03 *1.03 = 1.0609

1.03^3 =1.0609 *1.03. Let's compute:

1.0609 *1.03:

1.0609 *1 =1.0609

1.0609 *0.03 =0.031827

Sum is 1.092727.

1.03^3 =1.092727.

1.03^4 =1.092727 *1.03.

Compute:

1.092727 *1.03:

1.092727 *1=1.092727

1.092727 *0.03=0.0327818

Sum: 1.1255088.

1.03^4=1.1255088.

1.03^5=1.1255088 *1.03.

Compute:

1.1255088 *1.03:

1.1255088 *1 =1.1255088

1.1255088 *0.03 =0.033765.

Sum: 1.1255088 +0.033765 =1.1592738.

So (1.03)^5=1.1592738.

Thus, T2/T1=2 *1.1592738≈2.3185.

But none of the options exactly match this. The closest option is A:2.26, which is about 2.26, but that's lower than 2.3185. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the torque is proportional to I_a * (I_a), because flux is proportional to I_a. No, that's only in series motors. Wait, no, in a series motor, torque is I_a^2, because flux is proportional to I_a. But in this case, the flux isn't directly proportional to I_a; it's increasing by 3% for each 10 A. So flux is a function of I_a, but not linear.

Wait, perhaps I should model flux as a function. Let me think: the flux increases by 3% per 10 A. So for every 10 A increment, flux is multiplied by 1.03. So from 50 A to 100 A, that's 5 steps, each 10 A. So flux at 100 A is 1.03^5 times the flux at 50 A.

So, T is proportional to I_a * flux.

So T1 =50 * φ_50

T2=100 * φ_100 =100 * (1.03^5 φ_50)

Thus, T2/T1= (100/50) *1.03^5=2 *1.15927≈2.3185.

But the options don't have this exact value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the flux is proportional to the series current, so flux is proportional to I_a. Then torque is proportional to I_a * flux ∝ I_a^2. But with the flux increasing by 3% per 10 A, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the torque is proportional to I_a times (I_a), but with the flux increasing in a certain way. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flux is proportional to I_a, but with a 3% increase per 10 A. So flux φ = k * I_a, but k increases by 3% for each 10 A. So maybe the flux is φ = I
