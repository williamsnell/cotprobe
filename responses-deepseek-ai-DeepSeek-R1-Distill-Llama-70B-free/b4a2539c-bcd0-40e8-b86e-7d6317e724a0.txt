Okay, so I've got this problem here about Palmyra Co.'s comprehensive income. Hmm, I remember that comprehensive income includes more than just net income. Let me think... Oh right, it's net income plus other comprehensive income items.

The question gives me a few numbers. Let me list them out:

- Net income: $11,000
- Positive $1,000 net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
- $3,000 unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities
- Positive $2,000 foreign currency translation adjustment
- $6,000 increase in common stock

Wait, what's included in comprehensive income? I think other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. The change in accounting principle adjustment is also part of other comprehensive income, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that part.

Oh wait, the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is actually treated as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of change. So that $1,000 is not part of comprehensive income for this period. Or does it get included? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Comprehensive income is calculated by starting with net income and then adding other comprehensive income items. The change in accounting principle affects the beginning balance of retained earnings, so it's not part of comprehensive income for the current period. So I shouldn't include that $1,000 in the calculation.

The $6,000 increase in common stock is probably from issuing new shares, but that's a financing activity and doesn't affect comprehensive income. So I can ignore that too.

So the other comprehensive income items here are the $3,000 unrealized loss and the $2,000 foreign translation gain. Wait, the loss is a negative, and the gain is positive. So adding those together: (-3,000) + 2,000 = -1,000.

So comprehensive income is net income plus other comprehensive income. That would be 11,000 + (-1,000) = $10,000. But wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, the problem says a positive $1,000 for the accounting change. Oh right, because when you have a change in accounting principle, you adjust retained earnings, so it's not part of the current period's comprehensive income. So I was right to exclude it.

Wait, another thought: some sources say that the cumulative effect adjustment is included in the income statement as a separate line item, but comprehensive income includes net income plus other items. So the cumulative effect is part of net income, right? Or is it added after net income?

Wait no, the net income is $11,000. The cumulative effect is a one-time adjustment, which I think is part of net income. Or is it separate? I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the $1,000 is part of other comprehensive income. No, I think the cumulative effect adjustment is treated as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings, so it's not part of comprehensive income for the period. Because comprehensive income includes only the changes during the period, not prior period adjustments.

So again, the other comprehensive items are the $3k loss and $2k gain. So total OCI is -1k.

So comprehensive income would be 11,000 -1,000 = $10,000. Let me check the options. Option E is $10,000. But wait, looking back, the options given are A through J, with E being $10,000.

Wait another thing: sometimes the change in accounting principle is presented in the financial statements as part of the comprehensive income. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the statement of comprehensive income, the structure is:

Comprehensive income = Net income + Other comprehensive income (OCI)

OCI includes unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is not part of OCI; instead, it's a direct adjustment to retained earnings. So it's excluded from comprehensive income.

So the calculation would be: 11,000 (net income) + (-3,000 + 2,000) OCI = 11,000 -1,000 = 10,000.

Looking at the options, option E is $10,000. But wait, looking back at the question, the net income is $11,000, and the change is $1,000 positive. Oh wait, does that change affect net income? Or is net income stated after the adjustment?

Wait, no. The net income is given as $11,000. So the change in accounting principle probably affects the beginning retained earnings, so it's not part of this period's net income. So net income is just $11,000.

Thus, comprehensive income is 11,000 plus (-1,000) = 10,000. So the answer should be E: $10,000.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, the cumulative effect is included as a separate component in comprehensive income. Let me think. Oh, the Codification might say that the cumulative effect adjustment is included in other comprehensive income. Or wait, no, because when you change accounting principles, it's a retrospective adjustment, which affects prior periods. So for the current period, it's not part of comprehensive income.

So I'm confident it's $10,000, option E.

To determine Palmyra Co.'s comprehensive income, we start with net income and add other comprehensive income (OCI) items. The given data includes:

- **Net income**: $11,000  
- **Net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle**: $1,000 (positive)  
- **Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities**: $3,000  
- **Foreign currency translation adjustment**: $2,000 (positive)  
- **Increase in common stock**: $6,000  

Comprehensive income is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Comprehensive Income} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)}
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Net Income**: The given net income is $11,000. This is the starting point for calculating comprehensive income.  
2. **Net Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle**: This adjustment ($1,000) affects the beginning balance of retained earnings and is not part of the current period's comprehensive income. Therefore, it is excluded from the calculation.  
3. **Unrealized Loss on Available-for-Sale Securities**: This is an OCI item and is subtracted from net income.  
4. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment**: This is also an OCI item and is added to net income.  
5. **Increase in Common Stock**: This is a financing activity and does not affect comprehensive income.  

### Calculation of OCI:
\[
\text{OCI} = (\text{Unrealized Loss on Available-for-Sale Securities}) + (\text{Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment})
\]
\[
\text{OCI} = (-\$3,000) + (\$2,000) = -\$1,000
\]

### Calculation of Comprehensive Income:
\[
\text{Comprehensive Income} = \$11,000 + (-\$1,000) = \$10,000
\]

### Final Answer:
The comprehensive income for Palmyra Co. is **$10,000**, which corresponds to option **E**.
