Question:

A female psychologist provides a 2-month course of brief behavior therapy for a driving phobia to a male client. Six months after termination they meet at an art opening reception and begin to date. Over the next few months, the relationship progresses and they become sexual. In this situation, the psychologist has acted:

Options:

A: Ethically, as long as she does not provide therapy to the client again in the future
B: Ethically, because she waited an appropriate amount of time after termination before starting a relationship
C: Ethically because it had been 6 months since termination
D: Ethically, because the client initiated the relationship
E: Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment
F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances
G: Probably ethically since there was no coercion involved and the relationship was consensual
H: Unethically, because she should have referred the client to another psychologist before starting a relationship

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ethics in psychology, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is about a female psychologist who provided a 2-month course of brief behavior therapy for a male client's driving phobia. Six months after termination, they meet again at an art opening and start dating. Then, over the next few months, they become sexual. The question is about whether the psychologist acted ethically.

The options are A through H, each giving a different stance. I remember that ethical guidelines in psychology, especially regarding therapist-client relationships, are pretty strict to prevent exploitation and maintain professional boundaries.

From what I recall, the American Psychological Association (APA) has specific rules about this. I think it's in the APA Ethics Code, specifically Standard 10, which deals with therapy and confidentiality, but maybe more relevant is Standard 3 about professional relationships, or perhaps Standard 10.07 regarding sexual relationships with clients. Wait, no, I think Standard 10.07 is about sexual relationships with current clients, which is strictly prohibited.

But this situation is about a former client. I believe the rules for former clients are a bit different. I remember that some codes have a waiting period. Oh right, the APA used to have a two-year waiting period after therapy ended before a therapist could engage in a sexual relationship with a former client. But I think that might have changed, or perhaps the exact rule varies.

Wait, maybe I should think about the key points here. The therapy was brief, only two months. Then, six months after termination, they meet again and start dating, leading to a sexual relationship. So the total time since the last session is six months.

I think the ethical issue is whether the psychologist can ever have a sexual relationship with a former client, regardless of the time passed, or if there's a specific waiting period. I'm pretty sure that the APA's stance is that even after termination, engaging in a sexual relationship is unethical because of the potential for exploitation and the power imbalance that might still exist.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's not an absolute prohibition but more about the circumstances. Like, if the client was highly dependent or if the therapist used their position to influence the client. But in this case, the client initiated the relationship, which might make it seem more consensual, but I don't think that matters ethically because the power dynamic can still be present.

Looking at the options, option F says it's unethical because it's prohibited under any circumstances. But I'm not sure if that's the case. I think some codes allow it after a certain time, but perhaps others prohibit it entirely.

Wait, no, I think the general rule is that it's unethical for a psychologist to engage in a sexual relationship with a former client under any circumstances, because it can still exploit the therapeutic relationship. So in this case, the psychologist would be acting unethically.

Looking at the options again, F says it's unethically prohibited under any circumstances. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the rules might allow it after a certain period, but maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, option E says it's ethical according to professional standards but poor judgment. But if the standards prohibit it, then E wouldn't apply. So if the APA's standards prohibit it regardless of time, then F would be correct.

Wait, I think the APA's stance is that sexual relationships with former clients are prohibited because the power imbalance can still exist. So even after termination, it's considered unethical.

So the correct answer would be F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances.

Wait, but some sources I've read mention that while sexual relationships with current clients are strictly prohibited, for former clients, it's not allowed for a certain period, like two years. So maybe in this case, six months isn't enough, but if it were two years, it might be permissible. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the APA's Ethics Code 10.07 says that psychologists do not engage in sexual relationships with a current patient or client. For former clients, Standard 3.05 says that psychologists do not engage in sexual relationships with anyone they know to be a former patient or client for whom they have had a professional relationship within the past two years. So if it's been two years, perhaps it's allowed, but if it's less, it's prohibited.

In this case, it's been six months, so it's less than two years. Therefore, engaging in the relationship would be unethical. So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but option F says it's prohibited under any circumstances. If the rule allows it after two years, then F would be incorrect because it's not prohibited under any circumstances, just within two years.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. So let's re-examine the options.

Option F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances.

But according to what I just thought, it's prohibited only if it's within two years. So if the waiting period is two years, then six months is too soon, but after two years, it's allowed. So F's statement that it's prohibited under any circumstances is incorrect because after two years, it's permissible.

So then, the correct answer would be that she acted unethically because she didn't wait the required two years. Looking at the options, option F is too absolute, so maybe it's not F.

Wait, let's look at the options again. Option F says it's prohibited under any circumstances. But if the rule allows it after two years, then F is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is another option.

Looking at the options, option C says ethically because it's been six months. But six months is less than two years, so that would be unethical. So option C is incorrect.

Option B says ethically because she waited an appropriate amount of time, but six months isn't enough. So B is incorrect.

Option A says ethically as long as she doesn't provide therapy again. But the issue isn't about providing therapy again; it's about the sexual relationship. So A is incorrect.

Option D says ethically because the client initiated it. But initiation doesn't make it ethical; the power dynamic still exists. So D is incorrect.

Option G says probably ethical since no coercion and consensual. But even if consensual, the ethical guidelines prohibit it within two years. So G is incorrect.

Option H says unethically because she should have referred the client to another psychologist before starting the relationship. I'm not sure about this one. I think the issue is the sexual relationship itself, not the referral. So H might not be the best answer.

Option E says ethically according to professional standards but poor judgment. But if it's within two years, it's not ethical according to standards, so E is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to clarify the APA's stance. From what I remember, the APA Ethics Code 10.07 prohibits sexual relationships with current clients. For former clients, Standard 3.05 prohibits such relationships for at least two years after termination. So if it's been six months, it's less than two years, making it unethical.

So the psychologist engaged in a sexual relationship before the two-year period, which is a violation. Therefore, the action is unethical.

Looking back at the options, F says it's prohibited under any circumstances, which isn't accurate because after two years, it's allowed. So F is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I'm misremembering the exact standard. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the standard is that it's prohibited regardless of time, but I'm not sure. Another thought: some professional organizations have different rules. For example, the APA might have a two-year rule, but others might have different policies.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because the relationship is with a former client, and it's considered unethical regardless of time, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the key here is that the APA prohibits sexual relationships with former clients for at least two years after termination. So in this case, since it's only six months, it's a violation. Therefore, the psychologist acted unethically.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state the two-year rule. Option C says it's ethical because it's been six months, which would be wrong. Option F says it's prohibited under any circumstances, which might not be correct because after two years it's allowed.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option F is "Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances." So if it's prohibited under any circumstances, that would be incorrect because after two years it's allowed. Therefore, F is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is F because some codes prohibit it regardless of time, while others have the two-year rule. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about what the question is testing.

The question is about a sexual relationship starting six months after termination. The options suggest that the issue is whether the time elapsed is sufficient.

Wait, another approach: the question is about whether the psychologist's actions were ethical. The key point is that even if the therapy ended, engaging in a sexual relationship with a former client is unethical because of the potential for exploitation, regardless of the time passed.

But I'm not sure. Some sources say that after a certain time, it's permissible, but others say it's always prohibited. I think the APA allows it after two years, but maybe some other organizations prohibit it entirely.

In the absence of specific knowledge, I think the best approach is to consider that the APA has a two-year rule. Therefore, six months is too short, making the action unethical. So the correct answer would be F if it's prohibited under any circumstances, but if it's only prohibited within two years, then F is incorrect.

Wait, but the options don't mention the two-year rule. So perhaps the intended answer is F, considering that it's always prohibited, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: Ethical according to professional standards, but poor judgment. But I don't think so because if it's within two years, it's not ethical.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is F. Because even if it's allowed after two years, the question is about six months, which is less than two years, making it a violation. So F would be correct in stating it's prohibited, but perhaps F's wording is too absolute.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because the relationship is with a former client, and the APA prohibits it regardless of time. But I thought the APA allows it after two years.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall: the APA Ethics Code 10.07 says that psychologists do not engage in sexual relationships with current clients. For former clients, I think it's Standard 3.05, which says that psychologists do not engage in sexual relationships with former clients for at least two years after termination.

So in this case, six months is less than two years, so it's a violation. Therefore, the psychologist acted unethically. So the correct answer should reflect that.

Looking at the options again, F says it's prohibited under any circumstances. But according to the standard, it's prohibited for two years, not forever. So F is incorrect because it's not prohibited under any circumstances.

So then, the correct answer must be another option. Let's see.

Option F is incorrect. So the remaining option that indicates unethical behavior is perhaps option something else.

Wait, the options are:

A: Ethically, as long as she does not provide therapy to the client again in the future

B: Ethically, because she waited an appropriate amount of time after termination before starting a relationship

C: Ethically because it had been 6 months since termination

D: Ethically because the client initiated the relationship

E: Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment

F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances

G: Probably ethically since there was no coercion involved and the relationship was consensual

H: Unethically, because she should have referred the client to another psychologist before starting a relationship

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: Unethically, because she should have referred the client to another psychologist before starting a relationship. But I'm not sure that's the case. The issue is more about the sexual relationship itself rather than referral.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the closest is F, but F's wording is incorrect because it's not any circumstances, just within two years.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is F, assuming that the prohibition is absolute. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but E says it's ethical according to standards, which wouldn't be the case if it's within two years.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, considering that the relationship is with a former client, which is prohibited, regardless of time. But I thought the APA allows it after two years. Hmm.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on the information, the correct answer is F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances. Wait, no, because after two years it's allowed. So F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that it's unethical because she didn't wait the required two years, but none of the options say that. So perhaps the intended answer is F, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E: Ethically according to professional standards, but poor judgment. But if it's within two years, it's not ethical, so E is incorrect.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

- Sexual relationship with current client: always unethical.

- Sexual relationship with former client: unethical if within two years of termination.

In this case, six months have passed, so it's within two years → unethical.

Looking at the options, F says it's prohibited under any circumstances, which is incorrect because after two years it's allowed. So F is incorrect.

The correct answer should indicate that it's unethical because it's within the two-year period. But none of the options state that. So perhaps the closest is option F, but it's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because the question doesn't specify the two-year rule, and it's generally considered unethical regardless of time. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F because the psychologist engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited. But according to the APA, it's only prohibited for two years, not forever. So F is incorrect.

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is F, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the answer is F because it's always prohibited. But I think that's not the case. I'm going to go with F as the answer, but I'm not 100% sure.
</think>

The question revolves around the ethical implications of a psychologist engaging in a sexual relationship with a former client six months after termination. According to the APA Ethics Code, sexual relationships with current clients are strictly prohibited (Standard 10.07). For former clients, Standard 3.05 prohibits such relationships for at least two years after termination. In this scenario, the relationship began six months after termination, which falls within the prohibited two-year period. Therefore, the psychologist's actions are unethical.

Option F states that such relationships are prohibited under any circumstances, which is incorrect because the APA allows them after two years. However, since six months is within the prohibited period, the psychologist acted unethically. None of the other options accurately reflect the ethical violation based on the two-year rule. Thus, the best answer is:

F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances.

Answer: F
