Okay, so I've got this problem here about partners in a delicatessen, Matthews and Green. They've agreed on a profit-sharing ratio, and I need to figure out each partner's share of the profits for the year. Let's see... The profits were $10,200. 

Alright, I remember from my accounting class that when partners agree on a percentage split, each partner takes their percentage of the total profit. So here, Matthews is supposed to get 60%, and Green gets 40%. That seems straightforward.

Wait, let me make sure I'm thinking right. So the total profit is $10,200. I just need to calculate 60% of that for Matthews and 40% for Green. 

Calculating 60% of 10,200... Hmm, 10% of 10,200 is 1,020, right? So 60% would be 6 times that, which is 6,120. So Matthews gets 6,120. Then Green gets 40%, which is 4,080. Wait, that adds up to 10,200, so that makes sense.

Wait a second, looking at the options, I need to match these numbers. Let me check the options again. 

Option A: Matthews 6k, Green 4.2k. Wait, 6k is 6,000 and 4.2k is 4,200. But wait, my calculation said 6,120 and 4,080. So that doesn't match. So option A isn't correct.

Option E: Matthews 7,140 and Green 3,060. That's way higher for Matthews and lower for Green. No, that's 70% and 30%, which isn't the case here.

Option I: Matthews 6,120, Green 4,080. Oh wait, that's exactly what I calculated. So that's probably the correct option. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, 60% of 10,200. Let me compute it differently. 10,200 times 0.6. 10,200 * 0.6 is 6,120. Yes. And 10,200 * 0.4 is 4,080. So yes, that's correct.

Looking back at the options, option I says Matthews gets 6,120 and Green 4,080. So that's the right answer. 

I think I got this right. So the answer should be option I.

To determine each partner's share of the profits, we start with the total profit of $10,200 and apply the agreed-upon percentages: 60% for Matthews and 40% for Green.

1. **Calculating Matthews' share**:  
   Matthews receives 60% of $10,200.  
   \[
   0.60 \times 10,200 = 6,120
   \]

2. **Calculating Green's share**:  
   Green receives 40% of $10,200.  
   \[
   0.40 \times 10,200 = 4,080
   \]

3. **Matching the results to the options**:  
   The calculations show that Matthews' share is $6,120, and Green's share is $4,080. This corresponds to **Option I**.

Answer: I
