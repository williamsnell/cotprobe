Okay, so I've got this question about half-life, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says. It's asking for the half-life of an unstable substance where 75% of it decomposes in one hour. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. So if 75% decomposes, that means 25% remains after one hour. Oh right, because 100% minus 75% is 25%. So if 25% is left, how does that relate to half-life?

Let me think about the decay formula. The formula for radioactive decay is usually N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where T is the half-life and t is the time. So N(t) is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial amount.

In this case, after t=1 hour, N(t)/N0 = 25% or 0.25. So plugging into the formula: 0.25 = (1/2)^(1 / T). I need to solve for T.

Hmm, let's rewrite that. Taking natural logs on both sides might help. The equation is 0.25 = (1/2)^(1/T). Taking ln of both sides: ln(0.25) = (1/T) * ln(1/2).

Wait, ln(1/2) is negative, because 1/2 is less than 1. So let me compute that. ln(0.5) is approximately -0.6931. And ln(0.25) is about -1.3863.

So substituting: -1.3863 = (1/T) * (-0.6931). Dividing both sides by -0.6931 gives ( -1.3863 ) / ( -0.6931 ) = 1/T. Let's compute that. 1.3863 / 0.6931 is approximately 2. So 2 = 1/T, which means T=0.5 hours.

Wait, wait a second. If T is 0.5 hours, that means the half-life is half an hour. So every half hour, half the substance decays. But wait, in the problem, after one hour, 75% has decomposed. So in one hour, 25% remains. Let's check if that makes sense with a half-life of 0.5 hours.

So after one hour, which is two half-lives (since each half-life is 0.5 hours), starting from 100%, after first 0.5 hours, it's 50%. Then another 0.5 hours, it's 25% left. Yes, that matches. Because 25% is what's left after 1 hour. So the half-life is 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes. Wait, but looking at the options, 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours) isn't one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 1/2 hour (which is 0.5, 30 minutes)

Wait, option A is 1/2 hour. Oh, right. So that's 0.5 hours. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait a minute, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. Because 75% decayed in one hour means 25% remains. So the formula gives T=0.5 hours as the half-life. So yeah, the answer is A.

But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes I might mix up the concepts. Another approach: If the half-life is the time for half the substance to decay, then if I start with 100%, after one half-life (T), 50% remains. So if T is 1 hour, then after 1 hour, 50% is left, and after 2 hours, 25% is left. But in this problem, 25% is left after 1 hour. So that would mean that two half-lives have passed. So each half-life is 0.5 hours. Because two half-lives (T each) would be 1 hour. So yes, T is 0.5 hours.

So the correct answer is option A: 1/2 hour.
</think>

To determine the half-life of the unstable substance, we start by recognizing that half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The problem states that 75% of the substance decomposes in one hour, which means 25% of the substance remains after one hour. This indicates that two half-lives have passed because:

1. After the first half-life, 50% of the substance remains.
2. After the second half-life, 25% of the substance remains.

Since two half-lives correspond to one hour, each half-life is:

\[
T = \frac{1 \, \text{hour}}{2} = 0.5 \, \text{hours} = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hour}.
\]

Thus, the half-life of the substance is \( \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hour} \), which corresponds to option A.
