Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about finding an expression equivalent to (6 × 8) × 12. Hmm, okay, I remember from math class that multiplication is associative, which means the way you group the numbers doesn't change the result. So, (a × b) × c is the same as a × (b × c). 

But wait, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches that structure. Let me look through each option one by one.

Option A is 12 × (6 + 8). Oh, that's addition inside the parentheses. Since the original problem uses multiplication, this might not be the same. Let me compute both to check. The original is (6×8)×12 = 48×12 = 576. Option A would be 12×14 = 168. Not the same, so A is out.

Option B: (6 + 8 +12)×6. That adds all three numbers and then multiplies by 6. The sum is 26, 26×6=156. Original is 576, so B isn't it.

Option C: 6 + (8×12). That's 6 + 96 = 102. Not 576, so no.

Option D: 6 + (8+12) = 6+20=26. Nope.

Option E: 6 × (8 +12). 8+12 is 20, 6×20=120. Not matching.

Option F: 8 × (6 +12). 6+12=18, 8×18=144. Still not 576.

Option G: (6 +8) ×12. 6+8=14, 14×12=168. Again, not the same as 576.

Option H: 6×8 +12. 48 +12=60. No.

Option I: 6 × (8×12). Let's calculate that. 8×12=96, 6×96=576. Oh, that's the same as the original problem's result. So I is a candidate.

Option J: (6×8) +12. 48 +12=60. Not matching.

Wait, but the original expression is (6×8)×12, which is 576. Option I is 6×(8×12), which is the same by the associative property. So I is equal.

But wait, let me double-check. The original is (6×8)×12. If we rearrange the grouping, it's the same as 6×(8×12) because multiplication is associative. So yes, option I is correct.

The original expression is \((6 \times 8) \times 12\), which equals 576. Using the associative property of multiplication, this is equivalent to \(6 \times (8 \times 12)\). Evaluating the options:

- **A:** \(12 \times (6 + 8) = 12 \times 14 = 168\) (not equal to 576)  
- **B:** \((6 + 8 + 12) \times 6 = 26 \times 6 = 156\) (not equal to 576)  
- **C:** \(6 + (8 \times 12) = 6 + 96 = 102\) (not equal to 576)  
- **D:** \(6 + (8 + 12) = 6 + 20 = 26\) (not equal to 576)  
- **E:** \(6 \times (8 + 12) = 6 \times 20 = 120\) (not equal to 576)  
- **F:** \(8 \times (6 + 12) = 8 \times 18 = 144\) (not equal to 576)  
- **G:** \((6 + 8) \times 12 = 14 \times 12 = 168\) (not equal to 576)  
- **H:** \(6 \times 8 + 12 = 48 + 12 = 60\) (not equal to 576)  
- **I:** \(6 \times (8 \times 12) = 6 \times 96 = 576\) (equal to 576)  
- **J:** \((6 \times 8) + 12 = 48 + 12 = 60\) (not equal to 576)  

The correct answer is **I**, as it is the only expression equivalent to the original.
