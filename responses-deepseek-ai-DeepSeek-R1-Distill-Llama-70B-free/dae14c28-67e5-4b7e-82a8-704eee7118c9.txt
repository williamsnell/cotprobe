Okay, so I've got this question about Symbolic Interactionist theory and George Herbert Mead's concept of the 'generalized other'. Hmm, I remember that Symbolic Interactionism is a sociological perspective that focuses on how individuals interact and create meaning through symbols and interactions. Mead was a key figure here.

The question asks what the 'generalized other' is defined as. The options are A through H. Let me think about what I learned. I think the generalized other isn't just about specific individuals but more about society's perspective. 

Wait, Mead talked about the self as having two parts: the 'I' and the 'me'. The 'me' is the social self, which is the incorporation of others' perspectives. So the generalized other must be related to that. It's not just one person's viewpoint but society at large.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Collection of individual roles and expectations. That sounds like it could be part of it, but I think it's broader than that. Like, roles are more specific, maybe.

Option B: Viewpoint of a specific other. No, that's more like the 'significant others' in our lives, not the generalized.

Option C: Imaginary audience judging us. Wait, that's from Charles Cooley's looking-glass self, I think. So not Mead's generalized other.

Option D: Overall impression we give off. That's Goffman's dramaturgy, not Mead.

Option E: Image of how wider society perceives our behavior. This seems right. Because the generalized other is about taking the perspective of society as a whole.

Option F: Significant figure teaching values. That's more like a primary caregiver or significant other, not the generalized.

Option G: Structural theories Mead reacted against. I don't think so. The generalized other is a concept he developed, not a reaction.

Option H: Human tendency to seek acceptance. That's more of a general statement, not specifically the definition.

So putting it together, the generalized other is the perspective of the wider society, which we internalize. So the correct answer should be E.

The concept of the 'generalized other' in Symbolic Interactionist theory, as defined by George Herbert Mead, refers to the internalized perspective of the wider society. It represents how individuals imagine society as a whole might view their behavior. This is distinct from specific others or roles, as it encompasses a broader societal viewpoint. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** refers to specific roles and expectations, which is too narrow.
- **B** is about a specific individual's viewpoint, not societal.
- **C** describes an imaginary audience, which is from Cooley's theory.
- **D** pertains to impression management, a concept from Goffman.
- **E** correctly captures the idea of societal perception.
- **F** refers to significant figures, not the generalized other.
- **G** and **H** are unrelated to Mead's concept.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.

Answer: E
