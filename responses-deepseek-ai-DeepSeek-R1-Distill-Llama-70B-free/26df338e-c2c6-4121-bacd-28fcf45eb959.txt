Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about electrochemistry. Hmm, it's about finding out how many coulombs are needed to deposit a certain amount of zinc. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question states that I need to deposit 0.10 grams of zinc. The atomic mass of zinc is 65.38, and its valence is 2. I remember that in electrochemistry, the amount of substance deposited is related to the electric charge through Faraday's laws.

Wait, Faraday's first law says that the amount of substance deposited is proportional to the quantity of electricity used. The formula I remember is something like Q = n * F, where Q is the charge in coulombs, n is the number of moles, and F is Faraday's constant, which is about 96,485 C/mol.

So first, I think I need to find the number of moles of zinc deposited. Since the mass is given, I can use the atomic mass to find moles. Moles = mass (g) / atomic mass. The mass is 0.10 grams, and the atomic mass is 65.38 g/mol. So that would be 0.10 / 65.38. Let me calculate that.

0.10 divided by 65.38 is approximately... let me see, 65.38 times 0.001526 is about 0.10, so about 0.001526 moles. Wait, let me do it more accurately. 65.38 * 0.0015 is 0.09807, which is close to 0.10. So maybe approximately 0.001526 moles.

But wait, zinc has a valence of 2. Oh right, because each zinc atom has a charge of +2 when it loses electrons. So in the electrochemical cell, each zinc atom releases 2 electrons. So the number of moles of electrons (which relates to the charge) would be moles of Zn multiplied by the valence, which is 2.

So the moles of electrons = 0.001526 * 2 = 0.003052 moles of electrons.

Now, each mole of electrons has a charge of 96,485 coulombs (Faraday's constant). So the total charge Q is moles of electrons multiplied by 96,485.

So Q = 0.003052 * 96,485. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 0.003 times 96,485 is 289.455, and 0.000052 times 96,485 is roughly 5.016. So adding them together gives approximately 294.47 coulombs.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 0.003052 * 96,485. Let me do the multiplication:

96,485 * 0.003 = 289.455

96,485 * 0.000052 = Let's see, 96,485 * 5.2e-5. 96,485 * 5e-5 is 4.82425, and 96,485 * 2e-5 is 1.9297. So 4.82425 + 1.9297 = 6.75395. Wait, no, wait, 0.000052 is 5.2e-5, so 0.00005 is 5e-5, and 0.000002 is 2e-5. So 96,485 * 5e-5 is 4.82425, and 96,485 * 2e-5 is 1.9297. Adding them gives 6.75395. Wait, no, that can't be right because 0.000052 is 5.2e-5, so 96,485 * 0.000052 = 5.016 (since 96,485 * 5.2e-5 = 96,485 * 0.000052 = 5.016). So then 0.003052 = 0.003 + 0.000052. So 0.003*96,485=289.455, 0.000052*96,485=5.016. So total Q is 289.455 +5.016=294.471 coulombs.

Looking at the options, option E is 295 coulombs, which is very close. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Molar mass of Zn is about 65.38 g/mol. So 0.10 g /65.38 g/mol = approximately 0.0015267 mol Zn.

Each Zn atom has a +2 charge, so for each mole of Zn, 2 moles of electrons are transferred. So 0.0015267 mol Zn * 2 = 0.0030534 mol e-.

Charge Q = moles e- * Faraday's constant.

Faraday's is 96,485 C/mol e-.

So Q = 0.0030534 * 96,485 = let's compute this precisely.

0.0030534 * 96,485.

Well, 0.003 * 96,485 is 289.455.

0.0000534 * 96,485 = 0.0534 * 96,485 / 1000.

Calculate 0.0534 *96,485: 96,485 * 0.05 is 4,824.25, 96,485 *0.0034 is approx 328.25. So total is about 4,824.25 + 328.25 = 5,152.5. Then divide by 1000: 5.1525.

So 0.0030534 *96,485 is 289.455 +5.1525 = 294.6075 C.

So approximately 294.6 coulombs. The closest option is E:295 coulombs.

So the correct answer should be E.

To determine how many coulombs are required to deposit 0.10 grams of zinc, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the moles of zinc deposited**:  
   The atomic mass of zinc is 65.38 g/mol, so the number of moles of zinc is:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Zn} = \frac{\text{Mass of Zn}}{\text{Atomic Mass of Zn}} = \frac{0.10}{65.38} \approx 0.001526 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Relate moles of zinc to moles of electrons**:  
   Zinc has a valence of 2, meaning each zinc atom releases 2 electrons. Therefore, the moles of electrons transferred are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of electrons} = \text{Moles of Zn} \times \text{Valence} = 0.001526 \times 2 = 0.003052 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the total charge (Q)**:  
   The charge is related to the moles of electrons by Faraday's constant (\(F = 96,485 \, \text{C/mol}\)):  
   \[
   Q = \text{Moles of electrons} \times F = 0.003052 \times 96,485 \approx 294.47 \, \text{C}.
   \]

4. **Match the closest option**:  
   The calculated value of \(Q \approx 294.47 \, \text{C}\) is closest to option **E: 295 coulombs**.

Thus, the correct answer is **E: 295 coulombs**.
