Okay, so I've got this question about the vibrational frequency of I2 and the temperature at which the population in the first excited state is half that of the ground state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can work through it.

Alright, the vibrational frequency is given as 208 cm^-1. I remember that the energy of a vibrational mode is quantized, and each level is spaced by this frequency. So the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, and so on.

The question asks when the population of the first excited state (n=1) is half that of the ground state (n=0). I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of energy states at thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations between two states is proportional to the exponential of their energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

So the formula I'm thinking of is:

n1 / n0 = exp( -ΔE / (k*T) )

But wait, since the vibrational energy levels are quantized and equally spaced, the energy difference between n=1 and n=0 is hc times the frequency, right? So ΔE = h*c*ν, where ν is the wavenumber.

Wait, the units might be tricky here. The vibrational frequency is given in cm^-1, which I think is the wavenumber. So ν = 208 cm^-1. I need to make sure all the units match.

So substituting into the ratio:

n1/n0 = exp( - (h c ν) / (k T) )

We want n1/n0 = 1/2. So,

1/2 = exp( - (h c ν) / (k T) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/2) = - (h c ν) / (k T)

ln(1/2) is -ln(2), so:

- ln(2) = - (h c ν) / (k T)

The negatives cancel out:

ln(2) = (h c ν) / (k T)

Now, I can solve for T:

T = (h c ν) / (k ln(2))

I remember the values of the constants. Let me jot them down:

h = Planck's constant = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
c = speed of light = 3.0 x 10^10 cm/s (since 1 cm is 1e-2 m, but wait, cm^-1 to energy... let me make sure the units work out.

Wait a second, the units for h*c*ν would need to be in energy. Let's see: ν is in cm^-1, which is 1/wavenumber, but when you multiply by h and c, it gives energy.

But let me check the units:

h (J·s) * c (cm/s) * ν (cm^-1) = J·s * cm/s * cm^-1 = J. Because cm/s times cm^-1 is 1/s, and J·s * 1/s gives J. So yes, that works.

So the constants:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3.0e10 cm/s
ν = 208 cm^-1
k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K
ln(2) ≈ 0.693

Plugging these into the equation:

T = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e10 * 208) / (1.38e-23 * 0.693)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, numerator:

6.626e-34 * 3.0e10 = (6.626 * 3) * (1e-34 * 1e10) ) = 19.878e-24 = 1.9878e-23

Then multiply by 208:

1.9878e-23 * 208 = approx 4.13e-21 J·cm? Wait, no, the units are correct as energy in J.

Wait, no, sorry, 1.9878e-23 * 208 = let's compute 1.9878 * 208 = approx 413. So 413e-23, which is 4.13e-21 J.

Wait, no, 1.9878e-23 is 1.9878 x 10^-23. Multiply by 208 gives 1.9878 *208 = 413. So 413 x 10^-23 = 4.13 x 10^-21 J.

Now the denominator:

1.38e-23 * 0.693 = 1.38 * 0.693 = approx 0.955, so 0.955e-23 = 9.55e-24.

So T = (4.13e-21) / (9.55e-24) )

Compute 4.13e-21 / 9.55e-24 = (4.13 / 9.55) * 1e3 = (approx 0.4327) * 1e3 = 432.7 K.

Looking at the options, option J is 432 K. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I miss a decimal point anywhere?

Let me recalculate the numerator:

h*c*ν = 6.626e-34 *3e10 *208.

Compute 6.626e-34 *3e10 = 1.9878e-23.

1.9878e-23 * 208 = 4.13e-21 J.

Denominator: k * ln(2) =1.38e-23 *0.693= approx 9.55e-24.

So 4.13e-21 /9.55e-24 = approx 432.6 K.

Yes, so 432 K is the temperature. Option J.

To determine the temperature at which the population in the first excited state of $I_2$ is half that of the ground state, we use the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_0} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

Here, $\Delta E = h c \nu$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\nu$ is the vibrational wavenumber. The ratio $\frac{n_1}{n_0}$ is given as $\frac{1}{2}$, so:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \exp\left(-\frac{h c \nu}{k T}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{h c \nu}{k T}
\]

Since $\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\ln(2)$, we have:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{h c \nu}{k T}
\]

Rearranging for $T$:

\[
T = \frac{h c \nu}{k \ln(2)}
\]

Substituting the constants:
- $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}$
- $c = 3.0 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cm/s}$
- $\nu = 208 \, \mathrm{cm^{-1}}$
- $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K}$
- $\ln(2) \approx 0.693$

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
h c \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3.0 \times 10^{10}) (208) = 4.13 \times 10^{-21} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
k \ln(2) = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) (0.693) = 9.55 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J/K}
\]

Now, divide the two:

\[
T = \frac{4.13 \times 10^{-21}}{9.55 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 432.7 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

Thus, the temperature at which the population in the first excited state is half that of the ground state is approximately **432 K**. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**J: 432 K**
