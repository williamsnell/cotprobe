Question:

An auditor decides to use the blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation. The auditor should be aware that the blank form may be ineffective because

Options:

A: The auditor may have selected the wrong accounts to send the blank form to.
B: The blank form might be too complicated for the recipient to understand.
C: Accounts actually confirmed may not be representative of the population.
D: Accounts unconfirmed may have already been written off as uncollectible.
E: The blank form might be lost in the mail, resulting in no response.
F: All accounts do not have an equal opportunity to be selected for confirmation.
G: The recipient may not have the necessary information to fill the blank form.
H: Few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients.
I: The blank form may be mistaken for junk mail and discarded.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing, specifically dealing with accounts receivable confirmation. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation and why it might be ineffective. The options are A through I. Let me try to recall what I know about this.

First, I remember that in auditing, accounts receivable confirmations are a way to verify the existence and accuracy of accounts receivable. There are two types of confirmations: positive and negative. Positive confirmation requires the recipient (like the customer) to respond whether they agree with the information or not. Negative confirmation is when the recipient only responds if they disagree.

The question is about the blank form of positive confirmation. From what I remember, a blank form doesn't include any pre-printed information about the account. So the auditor sends a blank, and the customer has to fill in all the details, like the balance, etc. 

Wait, but why would that be ineffective? Let me think about the possible reasons. One issue might be that the customer has to do more work. If the form is blank, the recipient has to look up the information and fill it out, which takes more effort. People might not bother responding because it's too much trouble. So that could lead to fewer responses.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The auditor may have selected the wrong accounts to send the blank form to. Hmm, this is about selecting the wrong accounts. But the problem with the blank form isn't necessarily about selection; it's more about the response rate. So maybe not the main issue here.

Option B: The form might be too complicated for the recipient. That's possible, but the question is more about the blank form's ineffectiveness. If the form is complicated, but if it's blank, maybe the design is an issue. But I'm not sure if this is the primary reason.

Option C: Accounts confirmed may not be representative. I think this relates more to sampling methods. Like, if the auditor selects a non-representative sample, but the question is about the form type. So maybe not this.

Option D: Unconfirmed accounts may have been written off. That's a possibility, but I'm not sure how it directly relates to the blank form being ineffective. It could be a consequence, but not the reason the form is ineffective.

Option E: The form might get lost in the mail. That's a risk with any mail, but again, not specific to the blank form. Unless it's about response rates, but the question is about why the blank form is ineffective.

Option F: All accounts don't have equal chance of being selected. This sounds like a sampling issue again, maybe about random selection. Not directly about the form's effectiveness.

Option G: The recipient may not have the necessary info. Hmm, if the form is blank, the recipient would need to have the information readily available. If they don't, they can't fill it out. That could cause problems, but is that the main issue?

Option H: Few responses because more effort is required. Oh, this makes sense. Because the blank form requires the recipient to fill in all the details, it's more work, so they might not respond as much. So the auditor might not get enough confirmations.

Option I: The form might be mistaken for junk mail. That's a possibility. If the form looks like junk, people might throw it away without responding. So that could also lead to low response rates.

Wait, so which one is the correct answer? The question is about why the blank form may be ineffective. Both H and I seem plausible. But which is more directly related.

I think H is about the effort required leading to fewer responses, which directly makes the blank form ineffective. I is about the form not being taken seriously, also leading to lower response.

I'm trying to remember what I learned. The blank form typically results in lower response rates because it's more work for the recipient. So the main issue is that fewer people will respond because they have to put in more effort. So that points to option H.

But wait, another thought: maybe the blank form is sent without any information, so the recipient might not even know what it's about. They might be confused or not have the info, leading to non-response. That would be option G or H.

Alternatively, if the form is blank, the recipient might not recognize its importance and just throw it away, thinking it's junk (option I). So which is more likely the reason.

I think both H and I are possible, but the more common reason is H. Because the effort required is a bigger factor in response rates. People might ignore it because it's too much work, not necessarily because they think it's junk. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me recall. In auditing, positive confirmation can be in two forms: blank or tailored. The tailored form includes the balance and other details, so the recipient just has to agree or disagree. The blank form requires them to provide the balance. Tailored forms usually get higher response rates because they're easier to complete. So the blank form's ineffectiveness is because of lower response rates due to more effort required. So option H is correct.

Alternatively, another angle: the blank form might be mistaken for junk. But I think the main reason is the effort, so H is the answer.

The question asks why the blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation may be ineffective. The blank form requires recipients to provide all necessary information, which can lead to lower response rates because it demands more effort from the recipient. This increased effort is a significant factor in the ineffectiveness of the blank form, as people are less likely to respond when it requires additional work. While other options like the form being mistaken for junk mail (I) or recipients lacking necessary information (G) are plausible, the primary issue is the higher effort required, making option H the most appropriate answer.

Answer: H
