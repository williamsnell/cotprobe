Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a barge in a dock, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

So, the barge has a mass of 15,000 kg, and it's made of metal with a density of 7500 kg/m³. It's in a closed dock with a surface area of 6633 m². They're loading ore onto the barge, and the ore has a density of 3 g/cm³. When they load 80,000 kg of ore, the barge sinks. The question is about how the water level in the dock changes. Oh, and the area of the barge is negligible compared to the dock area.

Hmm. I think this has to do with buoyancy and displacement. When the barge floats, it displaces a certain volume of water, and when it sinks, it displaces a different volume. The change in water level would be based on the difference in displaced water before and after the barge sinks, right?

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The barge is initially floating, then when loaded with ore, it sinks. So before, when it's floating, it displaces a volume of water equal to its weight. But when it sinks, it displaces a volume equal to its own volume, because it's fully submerged.

So the change in water level would be the difference between the volume of water displaced when it's floating (which is its mass times gravity) and when it's submerged (its actual volume).

Wait, but the dock is closed, so the water level rises due to the submerged volume. Or maybe the change is when the barge sinks, whether the water level goes up or down. Because when it's afloat, it's displacing less water than its own volume, but when it sinks, it displaces its full volume. So the water level would rise by the difference between the submerged volume and the displaced volume when afloat.

Alternatively, perhaps the barge was displacing a certain volume before, and when it sinks, it displaces a different volume. The difference would cause the water level to change.

Wait, wait. Let's break it down step by step.

First, when the barge is floating without the ore, it displaces water equal to its weight. The barge's mass is 15,000 kg, so its weight is 15,000 kg * g (g is 9.8 m/s², but since we're dealing with ratios, maybe it cancels out). So the displaced volume is mass_barge / density_water.

But wait, the barge's mass is 15,000 kg, so the displaced water's mass is also 15,000 kg. So volume displaced is 15,000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 15 m³.

Then, when the ore is added, the total mass becomes 15,000 + 80,000 = 95,000 kg. So the displaced water's mass would be 95,000 kg, so volume displaced would be 95 m³. But the barge's own volume is based on its mass and density. Let me calculate that.

The barge's volume is mass / density. So 15,000 kg / 7500 kg/m³ = 2 m³. So when the barge is floating, it displaces 15 m³, but when it's loaded with ore, the displaced volume would be 95 m³. But wait, the barge's own volume is only 2 m³, so when it's loaded, it's submerged beyond its own volume? That doesn't make sense, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, when the barge is floating, it's displacing 15 m³. When it's loaded with ore, the total displaced would be 95 m³. But the barge's own volume is 2 m³. So the total displaced volume when it's loaded is 95 m³, which is much larger than the barge's volume. So the barge would sink, displacing its own volume (2 m³) plus the ore's volume? Or is it that when the barge sinks, the total displaced water is the sum of the barge's volume and the ore's volume?

Wait, no. When the barge is floating, it displaces a volume of water equal to the mass of the barge plus the ore divided by water's density. When it's submerged, the displaced volume is the volume of the barge itself, which is less than the mass/(density_water). So that can't be right because the barge would sink only if the mass exceeds the buoyant force.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the initial situation, before adding ore. The barge floats, displacing a volume V1 = mass_barge / density_water.

Then, when ore is added, the total mass is mass_barge + mass_ore = 95000 kg. If the barge sinks, it means that the buoyant force (which is density_water * g * V_barge) is less than the total weight (95000 kg * g).

Wait, but the barge's volume is fixed, based on its mass and metal density. So V_barge = 15,000 kg / 7500 kg/m³ = 2 m³. So, when the barge is submerged, it displaces V_barge = 2 m³ of water. The buoyant force in this case is 2 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ * g = 2000 kg * g.

But the total weight of barge + ore is 95000 kg * g, which is way more than 2000 kg *g. So I'm confused. That would mean the barge can't float even without the ore. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. The barge is made of metal, so its density is higher than water. So by default, if you just put the barge in water without any cargo, it would sink because its density is higher than water. But in reality, barges float because they're hollow, right? So perhaps the problem is considering the barge's average density when loaded.

Wait, but the problem says the barge is made from metal of density 7500 kg/m³. So the barge's average density is 7500 kg/m³, which is higher than water's 1000 kg/m³. So without any cargo, the barge would sink. But the problem says it's being loaded in a dock, implying it's afloat. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial barge (without ore) is floating because it's displacing enough water. But if the barge's average density is higher than water, that can't happen. Unless the barge is hollow and the actual average density is lower.

Wait, maybe the problem treats the barge as a solid object. So a solid block of metal with mass 15,000 kg and density 7500 kg/m³. So volume is 2 m³. That's a small barge, but okay.

So when you try to float it on water, since it's denser than water, it would sink. But in the problem, it's in a dock and is being loaded, which suggests it's floating. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the barge's density is 7500 kg/m³, but when it's hollow, the average density is less. But the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the barge floats, displacing V1 = mass_barge / density_water = 15,000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 15 m³.

Then, when the ore is loaded, the total mass is 95,000 kg, so the displaced volume would be 95 m³ (if it's floating). But the barge's own volume is 2 m³, so when you add the ore, perhaps the ore's volume is added to the displaced volume.

Wait, but the ore has its own density. Ore density is 3 g/cm³, which is 3000 kg/m³. So 80,000 kg of ore would have a volume of 80,000 kg / 3000 kg/m³ = approximately 26.6667 m³.

Wait, but when the ore is placed on the barge, if the barge is floating, the displaced water would be equal to the total mass (95,000 kg) divided by water's density (1000 kg/m³), so 95 m³ displaced.

But the barge's own volume is 2 m³, and the ore's volume is about 26.6667 m³. So the total volume of the barge and ore is 28.6667 m³, which is less than the displaced volume of 95 m³. That doesn't add up, because the displaced water can't be more than the actual volume of objects submerged.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When the barge is loaded with ore, if it's still floating, the displaced water's volume equals the total mass divided by water's density. But when the barge sinks, the displaced water is just the volume of the barge plus the ore.

Wait, no. When the barge sinks, the displaced water is equal to the volume of the submerged object. So if the barge and ore together have a volume greater than what the water can support, the barge sinks, displacing its own volume.

But wait, the barge's volume is 2 m³, and the ore's volume is 26.6667 m³, so total is 28.6667 m³. So when the barge is loaded, if it's floating, it would displace 95 m³. But since that's impossible, the barge sinks, displacing only 28.6667 m³.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 28.6667 m³ is way less than 95 m³. So the initial displacement was 15 m³ when empty, and after adding ore, the displacement would be 95 m³, but since the barge can't displace that much (because it would sink), perhaps the water level doesn't rise by the full 95 m³, but only by the volume of the barge plus ore?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. The problem says that when 80,000 kg of ore are aboard, the barge sinks. So before that, the barge was floating, displacing a certain volume, and after, it's sunk, displacing a different volume. The change in water level would be based on the difference between these two displaced volumes.

So initial displaced volume when floating: V1 = mass_barge / density_water = 15,000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 15 m³.

After adding ore, the total mass is 95,000 kg. If the barge could float, it would displace V2 = 95,000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 95 m³. But since it's sinking, the displaced volume is V3 = volume of barge (2 m³) + volume of ore.

Wait no, when the barge sinks, it displaces its own volume (2 m³) plus the ore's volume, but the ore is denser than water, so it would displace more? Or is it just the submerged volume of the barge and ore?

Wait, no. When an object sinks, the displaced water is equal to the volume of the object submerged. So the barge's volume is 2 m³, and the ore's volume is 80,000 kg / 3000 kg/m³ ≈ 26.6667 m³. So the total displaced volume when sunk is 2 + 26.6667 = 28.6667 m³.

Wait, but that's less than when it was floating, which was 15 m³. No, wait, 28.6667 is more than 15. So the displaced volume increases from 15 m³ to 28.6667 m³, so the water level would rise by the difference.

Wait, but that can't be right because when the barge is floating, it's displacing 15 m³. When it sinks, it's displacing 28.6667 m³, so the water level would rise by (28.6667 - 15) = 13.6667 m³.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the dock's surface area is 6633 m², so a change in volume would lead to a change in height. So the increase in water level would be (28.6667 -15) m³ divided by 6633 m².

Wait, but wait, when the barge is floating, the displaced volume is 15 m³. When it's sunk, it's displacing 28.6667 m³. So the water level would rise by (28.6667 -15)/(6633) meters.

But wait, that's 13.6667 m³ / 6633 m² = 0.00206 meters, which is 2.06 mm, or about 0.2 cm. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 0.2 cm.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me go through the calculations again.

The key is that when the barge is floating, the displaced water is equal to the mass of the barge, so 15,000 kg → 15 m³.

When the barge sinks, the displaced water is the volume of the barge plus the volume of the ore, because both are submerged.

Wait, but the ore is loaded onto the barge, so when the barge sinks, the ore is part of the barge's structure? Or is it loose and would displace water based on its own volume?

Wait, the ore is aboard, so when the barge sinks, the ore is inside the barge. So the total submerged volume is the barge's volume (2 m³) plus the ore's volume (26.6667 m³) → 28.6667 m³.

So the displaced water increases from 15 m³ to 28.6667 m³. So the change is 13.6667 m³.

The dock's area is 6633 m², so the change in water level is 13.6667 / 6633 meters.

13.6667 / 6633 ≈ 0.00206 meters → 0.206 cm, which is about 0.2 cm. So option C is 0.2 cm.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because initially, the barge was displacing 15 m³, and after sinking, it's displacing more, so water level rises.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire mass in water.

Wait, another approach: the total mass added to the dock is the barge (15,000 kg) plus ore (80,000 kg) = 95,000 kg.

But in the dock, the water level is determined by the total mass of water displaced. Wait, no, the dock is closed, so the water is already there. Adding the barge and ore would displace water, causing the level to rise.

Wait, but when the barge is floating, it's displacing 15 m³. Then, when loaded with ore, it's sinking, displacing 28.6667 m³. So the increase in displaced volume is 28.6667 -15 = 13.6667 m³.

So the water level increases by 13.6667 m³ / 6633 m² = approx 0.00206 m → 0.206 cm → 0.2 cm. So option C.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that when 80,000 kg of ore are aboard, the barge sinks. So the initial situation is the barge floating with some ore, and then with 80,000 kg, it sinks. Or is it that before loading, the barge was already in the dock, displacing 15 m³, and when 80,000 kg of ore is added, it now displaces 28.6667 m³, causing the water level to rise by the difference.

Yes, that's correct. So the change is an increase of 13.6667 m³, leading to a 0.2 cm rise in water level. So the answer would be option C: 0.2 cm.
</think>

To determine how the water level in the dock changes when the barge sinks after being loaded with 80,000 kg of ore, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Initial Displacement (Barge Floating):**  
   The barge has a mass of 15,000 kg. When floating, it displaces a volume of water equal to its mass divided by the density of water:  
   \[
   V_1 = \frac{\text{mass of barge}}{\text{density of water}} = \frac{15,000 \, \text{kg}}{1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3} = 15 \, \text{m}^3
   \]

2. **Final Displacement (Barge Sunk):**  
   When the barge sinks after being loaded with 80,000 kg of ore, the total displaced water is equal to the combined volume of the barge and the ore.  
   - The barge's volume is calculated from its mass and density:  
     \[
     V_{\text{barge}} = \frac{\text{mass of barge}}{\text{density of metal}} = \frac{15,000 \, \text{kg}}{7500 \, \text{kg/m}^3} = 2 \, \text{m}^3
     \]
   - The ore's volume is calculated from its mass and density:  
     \[
     V_{\text{ore}} = \frac{\text{mass of ore}}{\text{density of ore}} = \frac{80,000 \, \text{kg}}{3000 \, \text{kg/m}^3} \approx 26.67 \, \text{m}^3
     \]
   - The total displaced volume when the barge sinks is:  
     \[
     V_2 = V_{\text{barge}} + V_{\text{ore}} = 2 \, \text{m}^3 + 26.67 \, \text{m}^3 = 28.67 \, \text{m}^3
     \]

3. **Change in Water Level:**  
   The change in water level is determined by the difference in displaced volumes before and after the barge sinks. The dock has a surface area of 6633 m², so the change in water level is:  
   \[
   \Delta h = \frac{\Delta V}{\text{dock area}} = \frac{V_2 - V_1}{6633} = \frac{28
