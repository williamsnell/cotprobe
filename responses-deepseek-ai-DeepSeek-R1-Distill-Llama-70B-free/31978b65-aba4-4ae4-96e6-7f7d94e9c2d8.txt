Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of days in a loan period from September 2 to December 3. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on date calculations, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

First, I remember that when counting days between two dates, you usually include both the start and end dates. But wait, sometimes people might get confused whether to include the end date or not. But in this case, since it's a loan, I think each day counts, including both the start and the end.

Let me break it down month by month. So starting from September 2, I'll go through each month until December 3.

September: It starts on the 2nd, so I need to find how many days are left in September. September has 30 days, right? So from the 2nd to the 30th, that's 30 - 2 + 1 days. Wait, wait, wait. Because if I subtract 2 from 30, that gives me 28, but then I have to add 1 to include the 2nd. So 29 days in September.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. If I start on the 2nd, then the days in September would be from the 2nd to the 30th, inclusive. So that's 30 minus 2 plus 1 equals 29 days. Yeah, that makes sense because 30 (total) minus 2 gives 28 days after the 2nd, but including the 2nd makes it 29.

Next is October. October has 31 days. So that's a full month. So 31 days.

Then November has 30 days. Another full month, so 30 days.

Now December. The loan ends on December 3rd. So that's 3 days in December.

Wait, but wait, does that include the 3rd? Because the loan is until December 3rd, so yes, that day is included. So 3 days.

Now, adding them all up:

September: 29 days

October: 31

November: 30

December: 3

So total days = 29 + 31 + 30 + 3.

Let me add them step by step.

29 + 31 is 60.

60 + 30 is 90.

90 +3 is 93.

So that gives me 93 days in total.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the September calculation.

Wait, from September 2nd to September 30th, inclusive. So the number of days is 30 (total in Sept) minus 1 (since starting on the 2nd), because the first day is day 1, so 30-1=29. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that from day 1 to day 2 is 2 days, so from day 2 to day 30 is 29 days.

So, the total is 93 days.

Looking at the options, option J is 93 days.

To calculate the number of days in a loan period from September 2 to December 3, we break it down month by month:

1. **September**: From September 2 to September 30, inclusive. September has 30 days, so the calculation is \(30 - 2 + 1 = 29\) days.
2. **October**: A full month with 31 days.
3. **November**: A full month with 30 days.
4. **December**: From December 1 to December 3, inclusive, which is 3 days.

Adding these together:  
\(29 \, (\text{September}) + 31 \, (\text{October}) + 30 \, (\text{November}) + 3 \, (\text{December}) = 93 \, \text{days}\).

Thus, the total number of days in the loan period is **93 days**.

J: 93 days
