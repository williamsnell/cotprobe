Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a steam pipe connected to an empty cylinder. The pipe has saturated steam at 100 psia, and when connected, the cylinder fills with steam at the same pressure. I need to determine the final state of the steam in the cylinder.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that saturated steam is at its boiling point for a given pressure. So, at 100 psia, the steam is saturated vapor, right? Because saturated steam can exist as a mixture of liquid and vapor, but if it's just steam, maybe it's all vapor.

Wait, the cylinder is initially empty. So when we connect it to the steam pipe, steam will rush in. Since the pipe is at 100 psia, which is a higher pressure than a vacuum (which is what the cylinder was), the steam will flow until the pressure in the cylinder matches the pipe's pressure. But what about the temperature?

At 100 psia, the saturation temperature is higher than 100째C because, at atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia), water boils at 100째C. So higher pressure increases the boiling point. I think at 100 psia, the saturation temperature is around 327.8째F or something like that. So the steam from the pipe is at this higher temperature.

Now, the cylinder is initially empty, meaning it's at vacuum, so zero pressure. When the valve is opened, steam flows in. The steam entering the cylinder will expand into the empty space. Wait, but the pressure in the cylinder will rise until it's the same as the pipe's pressure.

I'm a bit confused about the process here. Is the steam expanding into the cylinder? If it's expanding, maybe it's doing work, which could cause a temperature drop. Or perhaps the steam is just filling the cylinder without any significant expansion work because the volume isn't changing much.

Wait, no, the cylinder was empty, so as steam enters, its volume expands. But since the pipe is at a constant pressure, steam keeps flowing until the cylinder's pressure matches. So the process is probably at constant pressure.

In that case, the steam in the cylinder will be at 100 psia. Since it's saturated steam, it should be at the saturation temperature for that pressure. But wait, when steam enters the cylinder, it's expanding into a vacuum. Does that mean it's going through throttling? Or is it a constant-pressure process?

Wait, throttling is a constant-pressure process where the enthalpy remains the same. So if the steam is expanding into the cylinder, perhaps it's a throttling process. But I'm not sure because the cylinder is being filled from a reservoir (the pipe) at the same pressure.

Wait, another approach: the cylinder is being filled with steam from the pipe, which is at 100 psia. So the steam in the pipe is saturated vapor at 100 psia. When this steam enters the cylinder, which is initially empty, the pressure inside the cylinder will rise until it equals the pipe's pressure. Assuming the cylinder is insulated or the process is quick, the steam's state might change as it enters.

But wait, if the pipe and cylinder are both at the same pressure, the steam in the cylinder should be the same as in the pipe. So the cylinder's steam would also be saturated vapor at 100 psia. But wait, does the process cause any cooling?

Ah, during expansion, like when steam rushes into a vacuum, the steam does work on the surrounding, but in this case, since it's connected to a pipe, maybe the process is more like filling without significant expansion work, so the steam remains at the same temperature and pressure.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that when the steam enters the cylinder, it's expanding into a larger volume. So the steam from the pipe is at 100 psia and, say, temperature T_sat at 100 psia. When it enters the cylinder, the pressure drops momentarily, but then the cylinder's pressure rises to match the pipe. So perhaps the process is isobaric (constant pressure) for the cylinder, but the steam inside undergoes some change.

Alternatively, maybe the steam in the cylinder ends up being saturated because it's at the same pressure as the pipe. So the final state is saturated vapor.

Wait, but another thought: when the cylinder is being filled with steam from the pipe, the steam in the cylinder might not have reached saturation. Because maybe the steam is expanding and cooling, causing some of it to condense. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the specific process. The cylinder is initially empty, so when connected, the steam flows in, and the pressure increases. The steam entering is at 100 psia and saturated. As the cylinder fills, the steam inside will be at the same pressure. Since it's saturated steam, it can't be superheated. But could it be subcooled?

Wait, no. If the pressure is 100 psia, the saturation temperature is fixed. If the steam is at that pressure and temperature, it's saturated. But if it's below that temperature, it's subcooled (liquid), and above, it's superheated.

In the filling process, the steam from the pipe is at the saturation temperature. So when it enters the cylinder, if the cylinder is at a lower temperature, the steam might cool, but the pressure would remain the same. So maybe the steam would condense, but wait, the cylinder is being filled to the same pressure as the pipe, so maybe the steam in the cylinder is also saturated.

Alternatively, suppose the cylinder is perfectly insulated. Then, the steam would enter without any heat exchange. If the process is quick, the steam's temperature wouldn't have time to change. But wait, when the steam enters the cylinder, it's expanding into a vacuum, which could cause it to do work, leading to a temperature drop. If the steam was saturated vapor, a temperature drop would cause it to condense. So maybe the final state is a mixture of liquid and vapor, meaning it's saturated.

Wait, but the pipe is an infinite source, so the steam in the cylinder would end up being saturated vapor at 100 psia. Because the pipe keeps supplying steam until the pressure in the cylinder is the same as the pipe's, and the steam in the cylinder has the same properties as the pipe's.

Alternatively, if there's any cooling, like if the cylinder is at ambient temperature, the steam might condense, but the question says the steam is filled at the same pressure as the pipe. So maybe it's still saturated.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the steam is saturated. Option F says partially condensed with liquid present. Option G says slightly superheated.

If the steam is at the same pressure as the pipe and is saturated, then B would be correct.

Wait, but when steam expands into the cylinder, could it become superheated? Or maybe it's just at the same state as the pipe.

Another angle: when you have a cylinder connected to a steam pipe at the same pressure, the steam in the cylinder is the same as in the pipe. So if the pipe's steam is saturated, the cylinder's is also saturated.

Alternatively, if the pipe is a source of saturated steam, then yes, the cylinder would contain saturated steam.

So looking at the options, B: The steam in the container is saturated.

Another possibility is that the steam in the cylinder is at the same temperature as the pipe (since pressure is same), so option C. But option C says same as reservoir (pipe), so that could also be correct. Wait, but the question is about the phase.

Wait, the pipe is at 100 psia with saturated steam. So the temperature of the pipe is the saturation temperature at 100 psia. The cylinder, when filled, will have steam at the same pressure, so same temperature. So the steam is saturated.

So option B is correct, I think.

When saturated steam at 100 psia from a steam pipe is connected to an empty cylinder, the steam flows into the cylinder until the pressure in the cylinder matches the pipe's pressure (100 psia). Saturated steam at a given pressure has a fixed saturation temperature, which is higher than 100째C due to the elevated pressure. 

As the steam fills the cylinder, the final state of the steam in the cylinder will be at the same pressure (100 psia) as the pipe. Since the steam in the pipe is saturated vapor, the steam in the cylinder will also be saturated vapor at the saturation temperature corresponding to 100 psia. There is no indication of subcooling, superheating, or partial condensation in this process. Therefore, the steam in the cylinder remains saturated.

Option B correctly describes the final state of the steam in the cylinder.
