Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about the effect of the presence of others on an individual's performance. Hmm, I remember something about social psychology from my studies. Let me think about this.

The question is asking what studies show about how being around others affects performance. The options are from A to J, each suggesting different outcomes. I need to figure out the correct one.

I think this is related to something called social facilitation. From what I remember, social facilitation is when the presence of others enhances performance. But wait, does it apply to all tasks, or only certain ones? Oh right, I think it depends on the difficulty of the task.

So if a task is easy, having others around might make you do better. But for difficult tasks, the presence of others might actually make performance worse. Why is that? Maybe because when the task is hard, the added pressure or distraction from others increases anxiety, which then impairs performance.

Wait, but I also recall something about the "audience effect." When people are being watched, they might perform better on simple tasks because they're motivated, but worse on complex tasks because the stress hinders their ability to concentrate.

So looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A says no significant effect. I don't think that's right because there's definitely an effect, whether positive or negative.

Option B says it facilitates both easy and difficult. That doesn't sound correct because I thought difficult tasks are hindered.

Option C says hinders all tasks. No, that's not right either since easy tasks are helped.

Option D: Hinder difficult tasks. That's part of it, but the option doesn't mention easy tasks. So maybe D is only half the story.

Option E: Hinder easy tasks. No, the opposite is true. Easy tasks are facilitated.

Option F: Increase difficult, decrease easy. Wait, no. I think it's the opposite. Easy tasks are increased, difficult decreased.

Option G: Increase novel, decrease difficult. Not sure about novel tasks. I'm more certain about the easy vs difficult.

Option H: Facilitate easy tasks. That's correct but what about the other part?

Option I: Increase all tasks. No, because difficult are hindered.

Option J: Facilitate novel and difficult. Doesn't sound right.

Wait, so the correct pattern is that easy tasks are performed better, and difficult ones worse. So the effect is that presence facilitates easy tasks and hinders difficult ones.

Looking back at the options, let's see. The question is about what the effect is.

Option H says facilitates performance of easy tasks. That's correct, but what about the difficult ones? The question is about the overall effect. Or perhaps the answer is H because it's the correct part, but wait.

Wait, the question is phrased as 'the effect... is to', and the options might present the correct combined effect. So looking for an option that describes both easy and difficult.

Wait, option D says "hinder the performance of difficult tasks." But it doesn't say anything about easy tasks, so maybe it's incomplete. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The social facilitation theory, as I remember, says that when a task is simple, the presence of others (co-action or audience) improves performance. But when the task is complex, their presence can impair performance because of increased arousal leading to anxiety which disrupts the performance.

So the effect is that others facilitate easy tasks and hinder difficult ones.

Looking at the options, the correct one should reflect that. Let me check each option again.

Option D: Hinder difficult. So that's part of it, but the question is about the overall effect. The question's wording is: the effect is to... So it's looking for the overall impact.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H because it says facilitates easy tasks, but that alone doesn't cover the difficult ones.

Alternatively, looking at the options again:

Which option says that easy tasks are facilitated and difficult hindered? Let me check the options.

Wait, looking at option D: Hinder the performance of difficult tasks. So that's only the hindrance part. Option H is about facilitating easy. So none of the options directly state both, except perhaps option B and I, which say all tasks are facilitated, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is what the effect is. So perhaps the correct answer is H because in the presence of others, easy tasks are done better, but the question is about the effect in general.

Wait, no, the options don't combine both. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because difficult tasks are hindered, but that's only part of the effect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the classic study by Triplett in 1898 showed that cyclists performed better when in competition (presence of others) than when alone. That's an easy task perhaps? Or maybe any task. But I think the differentiation came later.

Wait, I think the correct answer is H because it's about easy tasks being facilitated. But I'm getting stuck because I'm not sure if the options cover both aspects.

Wait, looking back, the correct answer is H: facilitate the performance of easy tasks. However, another thought: I remember that in some cases, for well-practiced tasks, social presence helps, but for new ones, it might not. So perhaps it's about task difficulty.

So in summary, the presence of others facilitates performance on easy tasks and hinders on difficult ones. So looking for the option that says presence of others hinders difficult tasks. That's option D. But the question is about the overall effect. Wait, the question is phrased as: the presence of others on an individual's performance is to... So perhaps the correct option is H and D together, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is D? Or perhaps the answer is H because it's only about easy tasks.

Wait, no. The question is about the effect, which has two parts. But the options don't cover both. So perhaps the correct answer is H because it's one correct aspect, but that's not the full picture.

Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact terminology. Social facilitation refers to the enhancement of performance in the presence of an audience, but only for well-learned tasks. For tasks that are not well-learned, performance decreases.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify if the tasks are well-learned or not. It just refers to easy and difficult.

Assuming that easy tasks are well-learned, so social facilitation applies. So in that case, easy tasks are facilitated, difficult hindered.

So the correct answer should be that the presence of others facilitates easy tasks and hinders difficult ones. So which option reflects that?

Looking back, option D says hinder difficult, but doesn't address easy. Option H says facilitate easy, but doesn't address difficult.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the effect... is to" and the options are each possible effects. So perhaps the correct answer is that the presence of others hinders difficult tasks, which is option D.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is H because social facilitation refers to the improvement in easy tasks. Alternatively, the correct answer might be D because it's about the negative effect on difficult tasks.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options again. The question is about what the effect is. So the effect is that others can either help or hinder, depending on task difficulty.

But the options don't capture both. So perhaps the correct option is H: facilitate the performance of easy tasks.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: hinder difficult tasks.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

In social psychology, the presence of others can have different effects based on the task's difficulty. For simple tasks, people perform better (social facilitation). For complex tasks, performance may decline due to increased anxiety or pressure.

So the effect is that others facilitate easy tasks and hinder difficult ones.

Looking at the options, is there an option that says that? Let me check:

Option D: Hinder the performance of difficult tasks.

Option H: Facilitate the performance of easy tasks.

So the correct answer is both H and D, but the options don't have a combined choice. So the question is about the overall effect. Wait, the question is phrased as what the effect is in general.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, because the question is about the effect, which includes facilitating easy tasks, but also possibly hindering difficult ones. But the options don't capture both.

Wait, looking again, perhaps the correct answer is H because it's the correct part, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts.

Another approach: the correct answer is H. Because social facilitation refers to the presence of others improving performance on simple tasks. So H says facilitate easy tasks.

Wait, but the question is about the effect in general. So perhaps the answer is H because it's the correct part. Alternatively, the answer is D because it's the negative effect.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is H, as the presence of others does facilitate performance on easy tasks.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is D. Because when the task is difficult, the presence of others hinders, but the question is about the effect in general.

Wait, no, the question is about what the effect is in general, not specifying easy or difficult. So perhaps the answer is that presence of others hinders difficult tasks, which would be D. But I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct answer is H because the question is about the effect, and in many cases, the presence of others does facilitate performance, especially on easy tasks. But for difficult, it's the opposite. However, the question is asking about the effect, which could be either depending on task, but the options don't have that nuance.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the options again.

Option H: facilitate performance of easy tasks.

Option D: hinder performance of difficult tasks.

The question is asking "the effect... is to", so perhaps the correct answer is that it hinders difficult tasks, which is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct answer is H. Because when others are present, easy tasks are done better. So the effect is to facilitate easy tasks.

I think I'll go with H as the answer.

The question asks about the effect of the presence of others on an individual's performance, and the correct answer must be selected from the given options. The analysis revolves around the concept of social facilitation, which suggests that the presence of others can enhance performance on simple or easy tasks but may hinder performance on complex or difficult tasks due to increased anxiety or pressure.

Key points considered:

1. **Option A**: "Have no significant effect on the performance of tasks" is incorrect because studies show that the presence of others does have an effect.
2. **Option B**: "Facilitate the performance of both easy and difficult tasks" is incorrect because difficult tasks are hindered, not facilitated.
3. **Option C**: "Hinder the performance of all tasks" is incorrect because easy tasks are facilitated, not hindered.
4. **Option D**: "Hinder the performance of difficult tasks" is partially correct but does not address the facilitation of easy tasks.
5. **Option E**: "Hinder the performance of easy tasks" is incorrect because easy tasks are facilitated.
6. **Option F**: "Increase the performance of difficult tasks but decrease the performance of easy tasks" is incorrect because it reverses the actual effects.
7. **Option G**: "Increase the performance of novel tasks but decrease the performance of difficult tasks" is incorrect because the question focuses on task difficulty, not novelty.
8. **Option H**: "Facilitate the performance of easy tasks" is correct because social facilitation enhances performance on easy tasks.
9. **Option I**: "Increase the performance of all tasks regardless of difficulty" is incorrect because difficult tasks are hindered.
10. **Option J**: "Facilitate the performance of novel and difficult tasks" is incorrect because difficult tasks are hindered.

The correct answer is **H** because the presence of others facilitates the performance of easy tasks, which aligns with the concept of social facilitation. While the presence of others may hinder difficult tasks, the question asks for the overall effect, and facilitating easy tasks is the most accurate and relevant response.

Answer: H
