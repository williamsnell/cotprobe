Okay, so I have this question about waveguides and the modes they can transmit. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a rectangular waveguide with a cross-section of 0.04m by 0.07m. It's being excited at two frequencies: 3e9 cps (that's 3 GHz) and 6e9 cps (6 GHz). I need to figure out which modes can propagate and then select the correct option from the given choices.

Wait, waveguide modes depend on the cutoff frequency, right? Each mode (like TE and TM) has a cutoff frequency below which it can't propagate. So I need to calculate the cutoff frequencies for various modes and see which are below the given frequencies.

First, I should remember the formulas for cutoff frequency. For a rectangular waveguide, the cutoff frequency for a particular mode (let's say TE_mn or TM_mn) is given by:

fc = (1/2√(με)) * sqrt( (mπ/a)^2 + (nπ/b)^2 )

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is 1/√(μ0 ε0) = c ≈ 3e8 m/s. But since the actual speed depends on the medium inside the waveguide, which I assume is air, so μ and ε are μ0 and ε0. So the formula simplifies to:

fc = c/(2) * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 )

But wait, actually, the exact formula for cutoff frequency is:

fc_{mn} = (1/2π√(μ ε)) * sqrt( (m π/a)^2 + (n π/b)^2 )

So if μ and ε are those of free space, then:

fc = (c)/(2) * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 )

But wait, no, because a and b are the dimensions. Let me get this right. The cutoff frequency formula is:

fc = (1/2π) * sqrt( (mπ/a)^2 + (nπ/b)^2 ) ) / sqrt(μ ε)

So if μ=μ0 and ε=ε0, then sqrt(μ ε) = sqrt(μ0 ε0) = 1/c. So substituting that:

fc = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (mπ/a)^2 + (nπ/b)^2 ) * c

Simplify:

sqrt( (m^2 π^2)/(a^2) + (n^2 π^2)/(b^2) ) = π sqrt( m²/a² + n²/b² )

So:

fc = (1/(2π)) * π sqrt( m²/a² + n²/b² ) * c

The π cancels out:

fc = (1/2) * sqrt( (m²/a²) + (n²/b²) ) * c

Yes, that's correct.

So, the cutoff frequency for any mode TE_mn or TM_mn is (c/2) * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 )

Now, the waveguide will support a mode if the operating frequency is higher than the cutoff frequency. So for each mode, I need to compute fc and check if it's less than both 3 GHz and 6 GHz? Wait, no, wait. The waveguide is excited at these frequencies, but I think each mode is considered at each frequency. Wait, no. Wait, the question is about which modes can be transmitted when the guide is excited at these frequencies. So for each frequency, determine which modes have cutoff frequencies less than that frequency.

Wait, but the question says "the guide excited at 3e9 cps and at 6e9 cps." Hmm, maybe it's for both? Or perhaps the modes that can propagate at either of these frequencies.

Wait, perhaps the modes must be able to propagate at both frequencies. Or maybe the question is considering each frequency separately, but the way it's written isn't entirely clear. Let me read the question again.

"Determine all the modes that can be transmitted in a rectangular waveguide with a cross-section of 0.04 × 0.07m. Assume the guide excited at 3(10^9) cps and at 6(10^9) cps."

Hmm, perhaps the guide is being operated at both frequencies. So for each frequency, the modes that can propagate are those with fc < f. But since the waveguide is a single structure, the modes that can exist are determined by the cutoff frequencies relative to the operating frequency. So perhaps the modes that can be supported at either 3 GHz or 6 GHz.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the waveguide is excited at both frequencies, but each mode has its own cutoff, so the modes that can propagate are those with cutoff below either 3 GHz or 6 GHz. But I think the question is asking for all modes that can be transmitted when the guide is operated at either of these frequencies. So for each frequency, determine which modes are allowed, and then the union of all those modes.

Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the modes that can propagate at each of these frequencies. So for each mode, if its cutoff is less than 3 GHz, it can propagate at 3 GHz. If its cutoff is less than 6 GHz, it can propagate at 6 GHz.

But the question is asking to determine "all the modes that can be transmitted", given that the guide is excited at these two frequencies. So perhaps the modes that can be transmitted at either of these frequencies.

So perhaps the approach is: for each mode, compute fc. If fc is less than 3 GHz, then it can propagate at 3 GHz. Similarly, if fc < 6 GHz, it can propagate at 6 GHz. But the question says both. So maybe the modes that can be transmitted at either frequency.

Wait, but the options present a list of modes. So perhaps the correct answer is all modes that have fc < 6 GHz, because 6 GHz is higher than 3 GHz, so any mode that can propagate at 6 GHz would have a lower cutoff than that. But some modes may have cutoff between 3 and 6 GHz, so they can't propagate at 3 GHz but can at 6.

But the way the question is phrased, perhaps the modes that can propagate at both frequencies would be those with fc <3 GHz. Because at 3 GHz, the modes must have lower cutoff. At 6 GHz, more modes are possible.

Wait, no. The question says "excited at 3e9 and 6e9 cps." So perhaps the waveguide is used at both frequencies. So for each mode, it must be able to propagate at both frequencies. So the cutoff must be less than 3 GHz. Because if a mode's cutoff is, say, 4 GHz, then at 3 GHz, it wouldn't propagate, so that mode wouldn't be transmitted when the guide is excited at 3 GHz. So perhaps the modes must have cutoff <3 GHz to be transmitted at both frequencies.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for all modes that can be transmitted at either frequency, regardless of the other. So the total modes would be the union of modes with fc <3 GHz and modes with fc <6 GHz.

But the question isn't entirely clear. But perhaps the intended approach is to find all modes that can propagate at either frequency.

So, let's proceed.

First, I'll compute the cutoff frequencies for different TE and TM modes.

The waveguide dimensions are a=0.07 m and b=0.04 m. Let me note that a is the longer side (7 cm) and b is shorter (4 cm), but actually, in waveguide terminology, a is usually the longer dimension, but I'm not sure if that's a rule. Wait, no, the TE modes are TE_mn where m and n are the number of half-wavelength variations along the a and b directions, respectively. So a is the length in the x-direction, and b is the length in the y-direction.

So, for a mode TE_mn, the cutoff frequency is given by:

fc_{mn} = (c/2) * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 )

Similarly for TM modes.

So let's compute fc for various m and n. Let's list the possible modes and their cutoff frequencies.

We'll calculate for m and n starting from 0 upwards, but remember that for TE modes, m and n can be zero (but not both zero). For TM modes, m and n can't be zero simultaneously either, but each can be zero as long as the other isn't.

Wait no: For TE modes, at least one of m or n must be non-zero. Similarly for TM.

So, possible modes are TE_mn and TM_mn with m and n integers ≥0, but not both zero.

Let me list the possible modes and compute their cutoff frequencies.

Compute a and b in meters:

a = 0.07 m

b = 0.04 m

c = speed of light = approx 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute for TE and TM modes.

First, TE modes:

TE_10: m=1, n=0

fc = (3e8 / 2) * sqrt( (1/0.07)^2 + (0/0.04)^2 )

= (1.5e8) * (1/0.07) )

1/0.07 is approx 14.2857.

So 1.5e8 *14.2857 ≈ 2.14285e9 Hz, which is about 2.14 GHz.

Wait, that's higher than 3 GHz? No, 2.14 GHz is less than 3 GHz. So cutoff is 2.14 GHz.

So at 3 GHz, TE_10 can propagate.

Similarly, at 6 GHz, of course, it can propagate.

TE_01: m=0, n=1

fc = (3e8/2) * sqrt( (0/0.07)^2 + (1/0.04)^2 )

= 1.5e8 * (1/0.04)

1/0.04 =25, so 1.5e8 *25 = 3.75e9 Hz, which is 3.75 GHz.

So cutoff is 3.75 GHz.

So TE_01 can't propagate at 3 GHz (since 3 <3.75), but can at 6 GHz.

TE_20: m=2, n=0

fc = (3e8/2) * sqrt( (2/0.07)^2 +0 )

= 1.5e8 * (2/0.07 )

2/0.07 ≈28.5714

1.5e8 *28.5714≈4.2857e9 Hz ≈4.29 GHz.

So cutoff is 4.29 GHz. So at 3 GHz, it's below cutoff; cannot propagate. At 6 GHz, yes.

TE_11: m=1, n=1

fc =1.5e8 * sqrt( (1/0.07)^2 + (1/0.04)^2 )

Compute each term:

1/0.07 ≈14.2857 → (14.2857)^2≈204.08

1/0.04=25 → 25^2=625

Sum: 204.08 +625 = 829.08

sqrt(829.08)= approx 28.8

So 1.5e8 *28.8 ≈4.32e9 Hz →4.32 GHz.

So cutoff is 4.32 GHz. So at 3 GHz, no; at 6 GHz, yes.

TE_21: m=2, n=1

fc=1.5e8 * sqrt( (2/0.07)^2 + (1/0.04)^2 )

Compute:

2/0.07≈28.571→ (28.571)^2≈816.3

1/0.04=25→625

Total: 816.3+625=1441.3

sqrt(1441.3)= approx 37.96

1.5e8 *37.96≈5.694e9 Hz →5.69 GHz.

So cutoff is 5.69 GHz. So at 3 GHz, no; at 6 GHz, yes.

TE_02: m=0, n=2

fc=1.5e8 * sqrt(0 + (2/0.04)^2 )

2/0.04=50 →50^2=2500.

sqrt(2500)=50.

So fc=1.5e8 *50=7.5e9 Hz →7.5 GHz.

Which is higher than 6 GHz, so can't propagate at 6 GHz.

TE_12: m=1, n=2

fc=1.5e8 * sqrt( (1/0.07)^2 + (2/0.04)^2 )

1/0.07≈14.2857→204.08

2/0.04=50→2500.

Sum: 2704.08 →sqrt≈51.99.

1.5e8 *51.99 ≈7.8e9 →7.8 GHz. Above 6 GHz, so can't propagate.

So TE modes:

TE_10: fc=2.14 GHz → can propagate at both 3 and 6 GHz.

TE_01: fc=3.75 GHz → can't propagate at 3 GHz, but can at 6 GHz.

TE_20: fc=4.29 GHz → can't propagate at 3 GHz, can at 6.

TE_11: 4.32 GHz → same as TE_20.

TE_21:5.69 GHz →can't at 3, can at 6.

TE_02:7.5 GHz → can't at both.

TE_12:7.8 GHz → same.

So for TE modes, the modes that can propagate at 3 GHz are those with fc <3 GHz.

Looking at the TE modes:

TE_10 →2.14 GHz → yes.

Others (TE_01, 20, 11, etc.) have higher cutoff.

So at 3 GHz, only TE_10 can propagate.

At 6 GHz, any TE mode with fc <6 GHz can propagate. TE_10 (2.14), TE_01 (3.75), TE_20 (4.29), TE_11 (4.32), TE_21 (5.69), but TE_02 and TE_12 are above 6 GHz.

So for TE modes at 6 GHz: TE_10, TE_01, TE_20, TE_11, TE_21.

Now, let's compute the cutoff frequencies for TM modes.

TM modes have the same cutoff formula as TE modes.

TM_10: m=1, n=0.

fc= (3e8/2) * sqrt( (1/0.07)^2 + 0 )

Same as TE_10.

So fc=2.14 GHz.

So same as TE_10. So can propagate at both frequencies.

TM_01: m=0, n=1.

fc=3.75 GHz. Same as TE_01.

So can propagate at 6 GHz, but not at 3 GHz.

TM_20: m=2, n=0.

fc=4.29 GHz.

Same as TE_20.

So can't at 3 GHz, can at 6.

TM_11: m=1, n=1.

fc=4.32 GHz.

Same as TE_11.

Can't propagate at 3 GHz, can at 6.

TM_21: m=2, n=1.

fc=5.69 GHz.

Same as TE_21.

Can propagate at 6 GHz, not at 3.

TM_02: m=0, n=2.

fc=7.5 GHz. Same as TE_02.

Can't propagate at either frequency.

TM_12: m=1, n=2.

fc=7.8 GHz. Same as TE_12.

Can't propagate at 6 GHz.

So for TM modes:

At 3 GHz: only TM_10 (fc=2.14 GHz) can propagate.

At 6 GHz: TM_10, TM_01, TM_20, TM_11, TM_21.

So now, compiling all possible modes that can propagate at either 3 GHz or 6 GHz.

At 3 GHz:

TE_10 and TM_10 can propagate.

At 6 GHz:

TE_10, TE_01, TE_20, TE_11, TE_21, TM_10, TM_01, TM_20, TM_11, TM_21.

Wait, but wait, TE_01 has cutoff 3.75 GHz, which is less than 6 GHz, so can propagate.

So the total modes that can be transmitted are all the modes that can propagate at either 3 GHz or 6 GHz.

So the combined list includes:

From 3 GHz: TE_10, TM_10.

From 6 GHz: TE_01, TE_20, TE_11, TE_21, TM_01, TM_20, TM_11, TM_21.

So all together, the modes are:

TE_10, TE_01, TE_20, TE_11, TE_21, TM_10, TM_01, TM_20, TM_11, TM_21.

Wait, are there any other modes that I might have missed?

Wait, let me check higher modes. For example, TE_30 would have a higher cutoff, which would be 3* (1/0.07) → higher than 6 GHz.

Similarly, TM_30 would have same.

So, I think the list is as above.

But looking at the options, let's check each option to see which includes these modes.

Option A: TE_01, TE_02, TE_11, TE_21, TM_10, TM_20.

Hmm, in our list, TE_02 is cutoff at 7.5 GHz, which can't propagate at 6 GHz. So option A includes TE_02, which shouldn't be included. So A is not correct.

Option B: TE_10, TE_01, TM_11, TM_20.

Our list includes more modes than this. So B is incomplete.

Option C: TE_10, TE_11, TE_12, TM_10, TM_11, TM_12.

Wait, TE_12's cutoff is 7.8 GHz, which is above 6 GHz, so it can't propagate. So option C includes TE_12 and TM_12 which shouldn't be. So C is incorrect.

Option D: TE_10, TE_20, TE_01, TM_01, TM_11, TM_21.

Wait, our list includes TE_10, TE_01, TE_20, TE_
