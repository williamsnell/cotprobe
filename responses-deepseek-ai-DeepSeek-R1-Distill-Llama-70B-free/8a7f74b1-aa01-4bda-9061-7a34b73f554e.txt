Okay, so I have this insurance question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the premium for a 15-day policy on a piece of furniture valued at $1,500. The annual premium rate is $1.25 per $100. Hmm, I think I remember that insurance premiums can be calculated based on the value of the item and the time period the policy is active.

Wait, so the annual rate is $1.25 for each $100 of value. That means if I have something worth $100, I pay $1.25 per year. But here, the furniture is $1,500, and the policy is only for 15 days, not a whole year.

First, I should probably figure out how much the annual premium would be for $1,500. Since the rate is per $100, I can calculate how many $100s are in $1,500. Let me do that: 1500 divided by 100 is 15. So there are 15 units of $100 in $1,500.

Each unit costs $1.25 per year, so 15 times $1.25. Let me calculate that. 15 * 1.25... Well, 10 * 1.25 is $12.50, and 5 * 1.25 is $6.25. So adding those together, 12.50 + 6.25 = $18.75. So the annual premium would be $18.75.

But wait, the policy is only for 15 days, not the whole year. I think I need to find out what fraction of a year 15 days is. A year has 365 days, right? So 15 divided by 365. Let me compute that. 15/365 equals approximately 0.0411. So that's about 4.11% of a year.

Now, to find the 15-day premium, I should multiply the annual premium by this fraction. So $18.75 multiplied by 0.0411. Let me do that calculation. 18.75 * 0.0411. Hmm, 18 * 0.0411 is about 0.741, and 0.75 * 0.0411 is about 0.0308. Adding those together gives roughly 0.7718. So the total would be approximately $0.7718.

Wait, that seems really low. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the time fraction.

Wait another thought: Alternatively, sometimes insurance might be calculated on a daily basis, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Or perhaps the rate is given per $100 annually, so the daily rate would be the annual rate divided by 365, then multiplied by the number of days.

Let me try that approach. The annual premium per $100 is $1.25. So per day, that's 1.25 / 365. Let me compute that. 1.25 / 365 is approximately 0.00342 per day per $100.

Then, the furniture is $1,500, which is 15 times $100. So per day, the premium would be 15 * 0.00342. Let's calculate that: 15 * 0.00342 = 0.0513 per day. 

Now, for 15 days, multiply 0.0513 by 15. 0.0513 * 15 = 0.7695, which is approximately $0.77. Hmm, same as before. But looking at the options, I don't see $0.77. The closest option is G: $0.31, but that's lower. Did I do something wrong?

Wait a minute, perhaps I misunderstood the rate. Maybe the $1.25 is for each $100 of value per year. So for $1,500, the annual premium is 15 * 1.25 = $18.75 as I thought earlier. Then, since the policy is for 15 days, I take 15/365 of that annual premium.

So 18.75 * (15/365) = ?

Let me compute that. 15/365 is 3/73 approximately. 18.75 * 3 = 56.25. Then 56.25 divided by 73. Let's see: 73 * 0.77 is 56.21, which is close. So approximately $0.77.

But the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again: A is 3.75, B is 1.25, C is 15, D is 18.75, E is 2.44, F is 6.25, G is 0.31, H is 5, I is 12.50, J is 22.50.

Hmm, none of these are $0.77. Did I make a mistake in calculating the time period?

Wait another angle: Maybe the 15-day period is a fraction of a month or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different time base. Let me think. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as (15 days / 365 days) * annual premium.

So 15/365 is approx 0.0411, as before. So 18.75 * 0.0411 = approximately 0.77, which is still not an option.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of monthly premiums? No, the question says annual premium. So that approach shouldn't change.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for 15 days as 15/365 of the annual rate, but maybe I miscalculated that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as 1.25 per 100 annually. So for 15 days, it's (1.25 / 365) * 15 = 1.25 * (15/365) = 1.25 * 0.0411 ≈ 0.0513 per $100. Then, since the value is $1,500, which is 15 * $100, so 15 * 0.0513 = 0.7695, so about $0.77. But again, not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the question expects the premium to be calculated per day, so 1.25 per $100 annually is 1.25 / 365 = approx 0.00342 per day per $100. Then, for 15 days, that's 0.00342 * 15 = 0.0513 per $100. Multiply by 15 (since 1500 is 15*100), so 0.0513 *15 = 0.7695, same as before.

I'm getting the same result, but none of the options match. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the annual premium is $1.25 per $100, so for 15 days, the rate would be (15/365) * 1.25 per $100. So for each $100, it's 1.25 * (15/365) ≈ 0.0513. Then, for $1,500, which is 15 times that, so 15 * 0.0513 ≈ 0.7695, so about $0.77. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let me think again. Maybe the premium is calculated as (value / 100) * rate * time. So value is 1500, divided by 100 is 15. Annual rate is 1.25, so per day rate is 1.25 / 365 ≈ 0.00342. Multiply by 15 days: 15 * 0.00342 ≈ 0.0513. Then multiply by the value factor (15): 0.0513 *15 ≈ 0.77.

Same result again. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me try another angle.

Wait, another way: Let's compute how much the daily rate is. The annual rate is 1.25 per 100. So per day, it's 1.25 / 365 ≈ 0.003425 per $100. Then, for 15 days, it's 0.003425 *15 ≈ 0.05138 per $100. So for $1,500, which is 15 * $100, it's 15 * 0.05138 ≈ $0.77.

I'm getting the same answer each time, but the closest option is G: $0.31, which is about 0.31, but that's lower. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the 15-day policy is being treated as a fraction of a month instead of a year. Like, perhaps 15 days is half a month, so 0.5 months. If the annual rate is $1.25 per $100, then the monthly rate would be 1.25 /12 ≈ 0.10417 per month per $100. Then, 0.5 months would be 0.05208 per $100. Then, for $1,500, which is 15 * $100, the premium is 15 * 0.05208 ≈ 0.7812, which is about $0.78. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different method. Let me see the answer options again. The options are A:3.75, B:1.25, C:15, D:18.75, E:2.44, F:6.25, G:0.31, H:5, I:12.50, J:22.50.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute it as 15 days is 1/24 of a year (since 365/15 ≈24.3). So 1.25 * (15/365) = 1.25 * (3/73) ≈ 0.0513 per $100. Then, for $1,500, which is 15 * $100, so 15 * 0.0513 ≈ $0.77. Again, same result.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of 15 days being 1/24 of a year, but that's not exact. 365/15 is about 24.33. So 1/24.33 is approximately 0.0411, which is what I used earlier. So I'm back to the same figure.

Wait, perhaps the question is using 360 days in a year for simplification. Let me try that. 15/360 = 1/24 ≈ 0.04167. So 1.25 * (15/360) = 1.25 * 0.04167 ≈ 0.05208 per $100. Then, for $1,500, it's 15 * 0.05208 ≈ $0.78.

Still not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me consider the options again.

Wait, option E is $2.44, which is higher than what I calculated. Option F is $6.25, which is much higher. Option D is $18.75, which is the annual premium I calculated. So perhaps the question is asking for something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the premium without considering the time factor. But that doesn't make sense because the policy is only for 15 days.

Alternatively, maybe the rate is per $100 per month, not per year. Let me check that. If the annual rate is $1.25 per $100, then per month it's 1.25/12 ≈ 0.104 per month. Then 15 days is half a month, so 0.104/2 ≈ 0.052 per $100. Then, for $1,500, it's 15 * 0.052 ≈ $0.78. Still same.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the premium per day, but then the answer would be around $0.05 per day, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the annual premium. The furniture is $1,500, so 1500 / 100 =15. So 15 * 1.25 =18.75 annually. That seems correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 15-day period is being considered as 15/365 of the annual premium. So 18.75 * (15/365) = ?

Let me compute that. 18.75 *15 = 281.25. Then 281.25 /365 ≈ 0.77. So same as before.

But none of the options match that. Hmm, perhaps the question had a typo? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the rate. Let me read the question again.

"What is the premium for a 15-day policy on a piece of furniture valued at $1,500 if the annual premium is $1.25 per $100?"

So, yes, the annual premium is $1.25 per $100. So for $1,500, it's 15 *1.25 =18.75 annually. Then, for 15 days, it's 18.75 * (15/365) ≈ 0.77.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a 30-day month, so 15 days is half a month. Then, the monthly premium would be 18.75 /12 =1.5625 per month. Half a month would be 0.78125, which is about $0.78. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should check what the options are again. Let me see: The options are A:3.75, B:1.25, C:15, D:18.75, E:2.44, F:6.25, G:0.31, H:5, I:12.50, J:22.50.

Hmm, perhaps I missed an option or there's a miscalculation. Wait, another approach: Maybe the premium is calculated per $100 daily, so 1.25 per year per $100 is 1.25/365 ≈0.00342 per day per $100. Then, for 15 days, it's 0.00342 *15 =0.0513 per $100. Then, for $1,500, which is 15 * $100, the premium is 15 * 0.0513 ≈0.77. So again, same result. But no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the premium per $100, but that would be 0.0513, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to multiply by the value as a whole, but that would be 1,500 * (1.25/365)*15, which is 1,500*(0.0513) =77. So that's $77. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is using 1.25 per $100 per annum, but the time is 15 days. So the fraction is 15/365. So the premium is (1.25 * 1500/100) * (15/365).

Wait, 1.25 * (1500/100) is 1.25 *15=18.75. Then 18.75 * (15/365)=0.77. So same as before.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is different. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value calculation. Let me see: 1500 divided by 100 is 15. So 15 times 1.25 is 18.75 annually. Then, 15 days is 15/365 of that, which is 18.75 * (15/365)=0.77. So perhaps the intended answer is $0.77, but it's not among the options. So maybe the question has a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the annual premium is $1.25 per $100, so the daily rate is 1.25 /365 ≈0.003425. Then, for 15 days, it's 0.003425 *15=0.05138 per $100. Then, for $1,500, which is 15 * $100, the premium is 15 * 0.05138≈0.77.

Still the same. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again to see if any are close. The closest is E: $2.44, which is about three times higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using 360 days instead of 365. Let's try that: 15/360 =1/24≈0.04167. So 18.75 * 0.04167≈0.78125. Still around $0.78.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer to be $2.44. How would I get that? Let me see: 1.25 per $100 annually. So for 15 days, the rate per $100 is 1.25*(15/365)=approx 0.0513. For $1,500, which is 15*100, 15*0.0513≈0.77. So no, that doesn't get to 2.44.

Wait, perhaps the furniture is $1,500, so 1500/100=15. So the annual premium is 15*1.25=18.75. Then, 15 days is 15/365 of a year, so 18.75*(15/365)=0.77. So I keep getting the same number.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for 15 times the daily rate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is per $100 per month, not per year. If that were the case, then the annual rate would be 1.25*12=15 per $100 annually, which doesn't make sense because the question says the annual rate is 1.25 per $100.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that perhaps the intended answer is $0.77, but since it's not an option, perhaps the closest is G: $0.31. But that's lower than what I calculated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the premium is calculated as (value/100) * (time in years) * rate. So (1500/100) * (15/365) *1.25. Let me compute that: 15*(15/365)*1.25. 15*15=225. 225/365≈0.6168. 0.6168 *1.25=0.771, same as before.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe the intended answer is E: $2.44, but I don't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait
