Question:

Upon graduation from high school, a student enrolled in a college close to where he lived. However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, "If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. " The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Six months later, the son defaulted on the payment plan, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, the court would most likely

Options:

A: relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.
B: relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.
C: not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.
D: not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step.

The scenario is about a father and son buying a car. The son didn't have enough money, so the father made a promise to the finance manager. The key point is the father's promise: he said if the son defaults, he'll pay the balance. Now, the son stopped paying after six months, and the car lot is going after the father without suing the son first. The question is whether the father is still liable.

First, I remember that when someone guarantees a debt, like a surety, the general rule is that the creditor must first try to collect from the primary debtor (here, the son) before going after the surety (the father). This is called the "right of subrogation." So, if the creditor doesn't do that, the surety might be off the hook.

But wait, there's an exception. If the surety's promise was made with the main purpose of the surety himself benefiting, then the creditor doesn't have to exhaust remedies against the primary debtor first. Oh right, that's the main purpose exception. So, when the surety is the primary beneficiary of the transaction, the rules change.

Looking at the facts, the son wanted the car to get to college, which presumably is for his education and future. The father's promise was to help his son buy the car. So, the main purpose here is the son's benefit, but waitâ€”does that make the father the primary beneficiary? Or is the son the main one benefiting?

Wait, no. The main purpose exception applies when the surety (father) is the one who will primarily benefit. Like if the father was co-benefitting, maybe. But in this case, the son is the buyer, using the car for his education. So the father's role is more of a surety to help the son, not for the father's own benefit. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Another angle: the father's promise was to pay if the son defaults. Generally, as a surety, the father can be held liable, but the creditor (car lot) needs to first try to get the money from the son. If they don't, the father might not be liable. But if the main purpose exception applies, the creditor doesn't have to.

Wait, the main purpose exception is when the surety's agreement is made for the surety's own benefit, making the surety primarily liable. For example, if the father was buying the car for himself but putting it in the son's name, then the main purpose would be the father's benefit. But here, the son is buying the car for his own use, so the father is just a surety, not the main beneficiary.

So, normally, the creditor should first go after the son, and if they don't, the father isn't liable. Looking at the options, option A says the father is relieved because the car lot didn't sue the son first. That would be the case unless the main purpose exception applies.

Wait, but the main purpose here: the father's promise was to enable his son to buy a car. The son is the primary obligor. So the main purpose exception doesn't apply because the father isn't the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the creditor should have sued the son first, and since they didn't, the father isn't liable. So option A would be the answer.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Option C says the court would not relieve the father because of the main purpose exception. So if the main purpose exception applies, the creditor doesn't need to sue the son first, making the father liable regardless.

Wait, perhaps I had it wrong. Let me think again. The main purpose doctrine says that if the surety's agreement is intended for the surety's own benefit, then the surety is primarily liable. So, when would that apply here?

If the father was the one who wanted the car, maybe. But in this case, the son needed it for college. So the father's role was to help the son, not himself. So the main purpose exception wouldn't apply. Therefore, the car lot should have sued the son first, making option A correct.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes family member guarantees are treated under the main purpose exception. Wait, no, the main purpose is about the surety's intent. If the father's main purpose was to help his son, then it's not for his own benefit. So the exception doesn't apply.

So the correct answer would be that the father is not liable because the creditor didn't sue the son first. So option A: relieve the father of liability because the car lot failed to first sue the son.

Wait, but option C says "not relieve... because of the main purpose exception." So if the main purpose exception applies, the creditor doesn't have to sue the son first, and the father is liable.

So which is it? Did the father's promise fall under the main purpose exception?

I think the main purpose exception applies when the surety is the primary beneficiary. In this case, the son is the primary beneficiary, so the exception doesn't apply. Therefore, the creditor should have sued the son first. Since they didn't, the father isn't liable. So the answer would be A.

But wait, another angle. The father's statement was, "If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults, I'll pay." This sounds like a suretyship agreement, but under the main purpose rule, when the surety is a parent, sometimes courts find that the main purpose is the parent's own benefit, perhaps to further the child's education, which indirectly benefits the parent. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the main purpose is the son's education, so the father's promise was to enable that, making the father a surety without falling under the main purpose exception. So the creditor should have sued the son first.

So I'm leaning towards option A being correct. Thus, the court would relieve the father because the car lot didn't sue the son first.

The question revolves around the father's liability under his promise to the finance manager. The father agreed to pay the balance if his son defaulted on the car loan. The son defaulted, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. The key issue is whether the father can be held liable under these circumstances.

Generally, when a surety (the father) guarantees a debt, the creditor (the car lot) must first attempt to collect from the primary debtor (the son) before pursuing the surety. This is known as the "right of subrogation." However, there is an exception to this rule: the "main purpose exception." Under this exception, if the surety's promise was made primarily for the surety's own benefit, the creditor is not required to exhaust remedies against the primary debtor first.

In this case, the son needed the car for transportation to college, and the father's promise was intended to help his son, not for the father's own benefit. Therefore, the main purpose exception does not apply. As a result, the car lot should have first sued the son before seeking recovery from the father. Since the car lot failed to do so, the father cannot be held liable.

Option A correctly reflects this reasoning: the father is relieved of liability because the car lot failed to first sue the son. Other options are incorrect because they either misapply the main purpose exception or rely on irrelevant legal principles.
