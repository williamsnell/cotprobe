Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electric motor lifting a block. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that an electric motor is lifting a 1600-pound block at a rate of 10 feet per minute. I need to find out how much electric power in watts must be supplied to the motor, considering it's 60% efficient. Oh right, efficiency plays a role here because not all the input power is converted into useful work.

Wait, so first, I think I should calculate the power needed to lift the block without considering efficiency, and then factor in the efficiency to find the required input power. Because if the motor is only 60% efficient, that means for every watt of power supplied, only 0.6 watts go into actual work lifting the block. So the motor needs more power than the actual work done.

Power is related to work done over time, right? And work is force times distance. So I'll need to find the force (which is the weight here), the distance, and the time.

The weight W is given as 1600 pounds. But wait, in physics, weight is a force, so that's the force due to gravity. So the force F here is 1600 lb.

The lifting rate is 10 feet per minute. So the velocity is 10 ft/min. I need to convert that into meters per second or something more standard because the SI unit for power is watts, which uses meters and seconds. But wait, maybe I can work in imperial units and then convert at the end. Let me think.

Alternatively, it might be easier to calculate the power in horsepower and then convert to watts. Because I remember that 1 horsepower is about 746 watts. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, let's stick with SI units.

Wait, but pounds are a force unit, so to get the work done, I can calculate it in foot-pounds. Then, knowing that 1 watt is 1 joule per second, and 1 joule is approximately 0.7376 foot-pounds. Hmm, maybe that's a way.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the work done per unit time (power) in imperial units.
2. Convert that power into watts.
3. Then, account for the efficiency to find the input power.

Wait, but perhaps a more straightforward approach is to calculate the mechanical power needed first, then divide by efficiency to get the electrical power input.

So first, find the mechanical power. The formula for power is P = (Force × distance) / time. But since the force is in pounds, which is a force unit, and the distance per time is in feet per minute, I can calculate this.

So the force F is 1600 lb. The rate is 10 feet per minute, so distance per second is not necessary; perhaps I can calculate power in foot-pounds per minute, then convert to watts.

Wait, foot-pounds per minute? I'm not sure. Let me try to convert units step by step.

First, find the power in horsepower maybe. Because 1 horsepower (HP) is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second, or about 745.7 watts. But since our rate is per minute, let's see.

Wait, power is work done over time. So if the block is lifted at 10 feet per minute, then in one minute, the work done is F × distance. F is 1600 lb, distance is 10 ft. So work done per minute is 1600 lb * 10 ft = 16,000 foot-pounds per minute.

But power is work per unit time. So in one minute, 16,000 ft-lb of work is done, so the power is 16,000 ft-lb/min.

But wait, I need to convert that into watts. Let me think about unit conversions.

First, I can convert foot-pounds to joules. 1 foot-pound is approximately 1.3558 joules. So 16,000 ft-lb is 16,000 * 1.3558 ≈ 21,692.8 joules per minute.

But power is in joules per second (watts). So to get watts, I divide by the time in seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 21,692.8 J/min is 21,692.8 / 60 ≈ 361.55 joules per second, which is about 361.55 watts.

Wait, but that's the mechanical power output. Because the motor is only 60% efficient, the electrical power input must be higher. So the electrical power P_elec would be P_mech / efficiency.

So P_elec = 361.55 W / 0.6 ≈ 602.58 watts.

Looking at the options, option I is 605 watts, which is close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Let me recalculate because maybe I messed up the unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the power in watts directly without dealing with joules and foot-pounds.

Wait, another approach: The weight is 1600 lb. To find the force in Newtons, since pounds are a unit of force (in imperial), but in SI, weight is mass times g. Wait, no, pounds can be a unit of mass (pound mass) or force (pound force). Oh wait, no, in this context, 1600 lb is the weight, which is a force. So 1 pound-force is approximately 4.44822 Newtons. So 1600 lb is 1600 * 4.44822 N ≈ 7128 N.

Then, the lifting rate is 10 feet per minute. Let's convert that to meters per second. 10 feet per minute is 10 * 0.3048 m ≈ 3.048 m per minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, that's 3.048 / 60 ≈ 0.0508 m/s.

Now, power is force times velocity. So P = F * v.

So P = 7128 N * 0.0508 m/s ≈ 7128 * 0.0508 ≈ let me calculate that.

7128 * 0.05 is 356.4, and 7128 * 0.0008 is about 5.70. So total ≈ 356.4 +5.70 = 362.1 watts. That's the mechanical power output.

But the motor is only 60% efficient, so the electrical input power must be higher. So P_input = P_output / efficiency = 362.1 / 0.6 ≈ 603.5 watts.

So that's approximately 604 watts. Looking at the options, option I is 605 watts, which is very close. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes.

First, 10 fpm: converting to m/s.

10 ft = 10 * 0.3048 = 3.048 meters. Per minute, which is 60 seconds. So 3.048 /60 = 0.0508 m/s. That's correct.

1600 lb to Newtons: 1600 * 4.44822 = let's compute that exactly.

1600 *4=6400, 1600 *0.44822= 1600 * 0.4 is 640, 1600 *0.04822 is approx 1600*0.05=80, minus 1600*(0.00178)= ~2.848, so 80-2.848=77.152. So 640 +77.152=717.152. So total F=6400 +717.152=7117.152 N. So approximately 7117 N.

Then, P=Fv=7117 *0.0508. Let me calculate that more accurately.

7117 * 0.05 = 355.85, and 7117 * 0.0008=5.6936. So total is 355.85 +5.6936≈361.5436 W.

Then, divide by 0.6 efficiency: 361.5436 /0.6 ≈ 602.5727 W, which is about 602.57 W. So the closest option is I: 605.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for power. Let me think again.

Alternatively, another approach: compute the power in horsepower and then convert to watts.

Power (mechanical) can be calculated as (weight in lb) * (speed in ft/min) / (550). Wait, I think that formula gives horsepower.

Because 1 HP is 550 ft-lbf per second. So for per minute, it's 550 * 60 = 33,000 ft-lbf per minute per HP.

So, power in HP would be (1600 lb *10 ft/min) / (33,000 ft-lbf/min per HP).

So that's (16,000) /33,000 ≈ 0.4848 HP.

Convert that to watts: 0.4848 HP * 745.7 W/HP ≈ 0.4848 *745.7 ≈ let me calculate.

0.4 *745.7= 298.28, 0.08 *745.7≈59.656, 0.0048 *745.7≈3.579. So total ≈298.28 +59.656=357.936 +3.579≈361.515 W. Which is the same as before.

So again, 361.5 W mechanical output. Then, input is 361.5/0.6≈602.5 W.

So the answer is 605, option I.

To determine the electric power required to lift a 1600-pound block at a rate of 10 feet per minute with a motor that is 60% efficient, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the mechanical power output**:  
   - The weight of the block is 1600 lb, which is a force.  
   - The lifting rate is 10 ft/min, which is converted to meters per second:  
     \[
     10 \, \text{ft/min} = 10 \times 0.3048 \, \text{m/min} = 3.048 \, \text{m/min} \quad \text{and} \quad 3.048 \, \text{m/min} / 60 \, \text{s/min} = 0.0508 \, \text{m/s}.
     \]  
   - The mechanical power is calculated as:  
     \[
     P_{\text{mechanical}} = F \times v,
     \]  
     where \( F = 1600 \, \text{lb} \) is converted to Newtons:  
     \[
     F = 1600 \times 4.44822 \, \text{N} \approx 7117 \, \text{N}.
     \]  
     Substituting \( F = 7117 \, \text{N} \) and \( v = 0.0508 \, \text{m/s} \):  
     \[
     P_{\text{mechanical}} = 7117 \times 0.0508 \approx 361.5 \, \text{W}.
     \]

2. **Account for the motor's efficiency**:  
   The motor is 60% efficient, meaning only 60% of the input electrical power is converted into mechanical power. Therefore, the input electrical power is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{electrical}} = \frac{P_{\text{mechanical}}}{\text{efficiency}} = \frac{361.5}{0.6} \approx 602.5 \, \text{W}.
   \]

3. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest value to \( 602.5 \, \text{W} \) is \( 605 \, \text{W} \), which corresponds to option I.

Thus, the electric power that must be supplied to the motor is **605 watts**.
