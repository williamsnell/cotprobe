Okay, so I have this problem about determining the dimensions of a flat key used to prevent a cast-iron gear from slipping on a shaft. The shaft is 2 inches in diameter. The gear delivers 125 horsepower at 250 rpm. The design stresses allowed are 19,000 psi for shear and 37,000 psi for bearing. I need to choose the correct dimensions from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that keys are used to transmit torque between a shaft and a gear or pulley. The key is usually a flat piece of metal that fits into a keyseat on both the shaft and the gear. The torque is transmitted through shear in the key and bearing pressure against the sides of the keyseat.

First, I think I should calculate the required torque. Torque is power divided by angular velocity. Wait, no, the formula is torque (T) equals power (P) times 60 divided by 2π times the speed (N), but I might be mixing up the units. Let me think: Power is in horsepower, so the formula in English units would be T (inch-pounds) = (P * 60) / (2π * N). Or wait, maybe it's T = (P * 5252) / N, because 1 hp = 5252 ft-lb/min, so for rpm, which is per minute, so yes: T = (125 hp * 5252 ft-lb/hp-min) / 250 rpm.

Wait, but I need the torque in inch-pounds because the shaft diameter is given in inches. Let me convert the units properly.

So, 125 hp * 5252 ft-lb/(hp·min) = 125 * 5252 = let's calculate that. 5252 * 100 is 525,200, so 125 is 525,200 * 1.25? Wait no, 125 is 100 + 25, so 525200 + (525200 * 0.25) = 525200 + 131300 = 656500 ft-lb/min. Then divide by 250 rpm: 656500 / 250 = 2626 ft-lb per rpm, but since it's per minute, that's 2626 ft-lb.

Wait, no, no. Because when you have rpm, it's per minute. So the torque T is in ft-lb. But wait, 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s, so for 1 minute (60 seconds), it's 550 * 60 = 33,000 ft-lb/min. So 1 hp = 33,000 ft-lb/min. So 125 hp would be 125 * 33,000 = 4,125,000 ft-lb per minute. Then torque T is 4,125,000 divided by the rpm, which is 250. So T = 4,125,000 / 250 = 16,500 ft-lb.

Wait, wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify. The correct formula is T (inch-pounds) = (P * 63,025) / N, where P is horsepower and N is rpm. Because 1 hp = 63,025 inch-pounds per minute, so 63,025 divided by rpm gives the torque per revolution, but since torque is per revolution, wait, no, actually, T = (P * 63,025) / N gives torque in inch-pounds. Let me check that: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbs per second. Since 1 ft = 12 inches, 1 ft-lb = 12 inch-lbs. So 550 ft-lb/s = 550 * 12 = 6600 inch-lb/s. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 6600 * 60 = 396,000 inch-lb per minute. So 1 hp = 396,000 inch-lb per minute. Therefore, T (inch-lb) = (P * 396,000) / N.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So for 125 hp at 250 rpm:

T = (125 * 396,000) / 250. Let's compute that.

125 * 396,000 = 49,500,000. Then divide by 250: 49,500,000 / 250 = 198,000 inch-pounds. So the torque is 198,000 inch-lbs.

Now, the shaft is 2 inches in diameter, so the radius is 1 inch. The key is on the shaft, so the key will be subjected to shear stress and bearing stress.

The key has a thickness t, width w, and length L. I think that for a flat key, the torque is transmitted by the shear of the key and the bearing pressure on the key.

The shear stress (τ) is given by τ = (T * 2) / (L * t^2). Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Shear stress in the key would be based on the area that's being sheared. The key is a rectangle, and it's sheared along its length. So the shearing force is T divided by the polar moment of inertia? Wait no, perhaps I should model it as a beam in torsion, but maybe it's simpler than that.

Alternatively, the key is in double shear because both ends are fixed. Wait, no, perhaps the key is in single shear. Let me think: the key is between the shaft and the gear. When torque is applied, the key is sheared along its length. So the shearing area is (length * thickness), and the shearing force is T/r, where r is the radius.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T = (τ * area) * r. Area is the cross-sectional area of the key that is in shear. So if the key has length L and thickness t, then the area is L * t. So T = τ * L * t * r.

Wait, that makes sense. So T = τ * L * t * r, where r is the radius of the shaft. So solving for L:

L = T / (τ * t * r)

But wait, I also have to consider the bearing stress. The bearing stress (σ) is the force exerted on the key divided by the area supporting it. The force here is the torque divided by the radius, so F = T / r. The area supporting this force is the width of the key (w) multiplied by the length (L). So σ = (T / r) / (w * L) )

So σ = T / (r * w * L )

We have two equations:

1) T = τ * L * t * r
2) σ = T / (r * w * L )

We can solve these equations to find the required dimensions.

Given that τ is 19,000 psi and σ is 37,000 psi.

So from equation 1: L = T / (τ * t * r )

From equation 2: L = T / (σ * r * w )

Wait, no, wait. Equation 2 says σ = T/(r * w * L ), so rearranged, L = T / (σ * r * w )

So both expressions for L must be equal, so:

T/(τ * t * r) = T/(σ * r * w )

Canceling T and r from both sides:

1/(τ * t) = 1/(σ * w )

So τ * t = σ * w

So t = (σ / τ) * w

Given σ = 37,000 psi and τ = 19,000 psi, so t = (37000 / 19000) * w = approx 1.947 * w

So the thickness is about 1.947 times the width.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what the ratios of t to w are.

Looking at the options:

Option A: t=3/8, w=1/2. So t/w = 0.75 / 0.5 = 1.5, which is close to 1.947.

Option B: t=1/4, w=3/8. t/w = 0.25/0.375 = 0.666.

Option C: t=3/8, w=1/2. Same as A, 1.5.

E: t=3/8, w=5/8. t/w = 0.375 / 0.625 = 0.6.

H: t=1/2, w=1/2. Ratio 1.

J: t=1/2, w=3/8. t/w = 0.5 / 0.375 = 1.333.

Hmm, none of the options have a ratio of nearly 2, but the closest is option A and C, which are 1.5. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula for the shear stress in the key: I think I might have it wrong. Another approach is that the key is in double shear because both the shaft and the gear are clamped tightly on either side. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

I think the key is in single shear. The torque is transmitted by the shear of the key. So the shear force on the key is F = T / r, where r is the radius. The shear stress is F divided by the area of the key that's being sheared. So for a rectangular key, the area is t * L. Because the key is sheared along its length and thickness.

So τ = F / (A) = (T/r) / (t * L )

So τ = T / (r * t * L )

Similarly, the bearing stress σ is the same force F = T/r, but it's distributed over the area (w * L ), so σ = F / (w * L ) = (T/r) / (w * L ) = T / (r * w * L )

So we have two equations:

τ = T / (r * t * L ) → Eqn 1

σ = T / (r * w * L ) → Eqn 2

We can take the ratio of τ/σ to eliminate T, r, and L.

τ/σ = [ T / (r t L) ] / [ T / (r w L) ) ] → τ/σ = (w)/(t)

So τ/σ = w/t → w = (τ/σ) * t

Given τ = 19,000 psi, σ=37,000 psi.

So w = (19000/37000) * t ≈ 0.5135 * t → t = w / 0.5135 ≈ 1.947 * w.

Wait, same as before. So the thickness is about twice the width.

Looking back, none of the options have t ≈ 2w. But perhaps the options have some standard sizes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it by finding the required length and then see which option matches.

Let me proceed step by step.

Given:

Power P = 125 hp

Speed N = 250 rpm

Shaft diameter D = 2 inches → radius r = 1 inch

Design shear stress τ = 19,000 psi

Design bearing stress σ = 37,000 psi

First, calculate torque T.

T (inch-pounds) = (P * 63,025) / N

Wait, let me confirm the conversion.

1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s → 550 ft-lb/s * 12 in/ft = 6600 in-lb/s.

Multiply by 60 seconds to get per minute: 6600 *60 = 396,000 in-lb/min.

So T = (P * 396,000) / N.

So T = (125 * 396000) / 250 = (49,500,000) / 250 = 198,000 inch-pounds.

So T = 198,000 in-lb.

Now, from Eqn 1:

τ = T / (r * t * L )

So 19,000 = 198,000 / (1 * t * L )

→ t * L = 198,000 / 19,000 ≈ 10.421 in².

Similarly, from Eqn 2:

σ = T / (r * w * L )

37,000 = 198,000 / (1 * w * L )

→ w * L = 198,000 /37,000 ≈5.351 in².

So now we have two equations:

1) t * L = 10.421

2) w * L =5.351

We also have the relation from the ratio: t ≈1.947 * w.

So, from equation 2: w = 5.351 / L.

From equation 1: t = 10.421 / L.

So t = (10.421/L ), w = (5.351/L )

Then, t ≈1.947 * w → (10.421/L ) ≈1.947 * (5.351/L )

Multiply both sides by L and calculate:

10.421 ≈1.947 *5.351 → 10.421 ≈ 10.421.

Yes, that checks out, so the ratio holds.

So our variables are related, and we can express everything in terms of L.

But to find L, we need another equation or to find integer values.

Wait, perhaps the key's width and thickness are standard sizes. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options, let's list t, w, L for each and compute t * L and w * L to see which meets the 10.421 and 5.351.

Option A: t=3/8=0.375, w=0.5, L=3.32.

t * L = 0.375 *3.32 ≈ 1.245

But our required t*L is 10.421, so this is way too small. So A is out.

Option B: t=0.25, w=0.375, L=6.0

t*L=0.25*6=1.5 → No.

Option C: t=0.375, w=0.5, L=4.6.

t*L=0.375*4.6≈1.725 → No.

Option D: t=0.5, w=0.25, L=4.0.

t*L=2.0 → No.

Option E: t=0.375, w=0.625, L=5.0.

t*L=1.875 → No.

Option F: t=0.625, w=0.375, L=3.32.

t*L=2.0625 → No.

Option G: t=0.25, w=0.625, L=3.5.

t*L=0.875 → No.

Option H: t=0.5, w=0.5, L=4.6.

t * L=2.3 → No.

Option I: t=0.375, w=0.375, L=2.5.

t*L=0.9375 → No.

Option J: t=0.5, w=0.375, L=4.6.

t*L=2.3 → No.

Wait, none of these options have t*L of ~10.42. That's confusing. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the key is in double shear, so the shear stress is actually half. Because the key is sheared along two planes.

Wait, wait, no, the key is a single piece, so when the torque is applied, the key is sheared once, not twice. So I think my initial assumption was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the key's width is the length in the direction of the shaft, and the thickness is the side. Wait, perhaps the dimensions in the options are key width (w) and key thickness (t). Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equations.

We have:

From shear stress: τ = T / (r * t * L )

From bearing stress: σ = T / (r * w * L )

So solving for L from both:

L = T/(r τ t )

and L = T/(r σ w )

Setting them equal: T/(r τ t) = T/(r σ w )

Cancel T and r: 1/(τ t) )= 1/(σ w )

So τ t = σ w → t = (σ/τ) w ≈ (37000/19000) w ≈ 1.947 w.

So t is about twice the width.

Looking at the options again, which options have t ≈2w?

Looking at each option:

Option A: t=0.375", w=0.5". So t=0.75 w → 0.75. No.

Option B: t=0.25", w=0.375". t=0.666w → No.

Option C: same as A, t=0.375, w=0.5 → 0.75.

Option D: t=0.5, w=0.25 → t=2w (since 0.5 is 2 times 0.25). Oh, wait, here t=2w. That fits.

So for option D, t=0.5", w=0.25".

Then, from equation 1, L = T/(r τ t )

T=198000, r=1, τ=19000, t=0.5.

So L=198000/(1 * 19000 * 0.5 )= 198000/(9500)= approx 20.842 inches.

Wait, but option D says L=4". That's way too short. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute L for option D.

Option D: t=0.5, w=0.25, L=4.0.

Compute t*L = 0.5*4=2.0. Earlier, we found t*L should be ~10.42 in². So 2.0 is way too small.

So option D is not correct.

Looking for which option has t*w*L in the right proportions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute for each option the values of t*L and w*L and see if they meet the required 10.42 and 5.35.

Let me make a table:

Option | t (in) | w (in) | L (in) | t*L | w*L | t/w ratio
A | 0.375 | 0.5 | 3.32 | 1.245 | 1.66 | 0.75
B | 0.25 | 0.375 |6.0 |1.5 |2.25 | 0.666
C |0.375 |0.5 |4.6 |1.725 |2.3 |0.75
D
