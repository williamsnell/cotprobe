Question:

A plantiff sued a defendant for injuries suffered m a fall on the sidewalk of the defendant's home. The plaintiff's complaint alleged that the walk was covered by a thick sheet of ice, which had been negligently left there for several days by the defendant. In his answer, the defendant set forth that the ice formed overnight and that the plaintiff fell before the defendant had a chance to remove it. During the trial, a physician, whose office was next door to the defendant's home, testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice, which had been there for several days was at least two inches thick. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked the physician the following question: "During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?"Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, the physician's testimony will be ruled

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay evidence.
B: admissible, because the physician had personal knowledge of the plaintiff's injuries.
C: admissible, because it provides additional information about the plaintiff's condition.
D: admissible, because it sheds light on the plaintiff's physical condition at the time of the fall.
E: inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is not relevant to prove that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated.
F: inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is biased.
G: inadmissible, because the defendant's counsel failed to lay a proper foundation.
H: inadmissible, because it contradicts the defendant's statement.
I: admissible, because it is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.
J: admissible, because it helps to establish the timeline of events.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this evidence question here. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a trial where the plaintiff sued the defendant for injuries from a fall on the defendant's icy sidewalk. The plaintiff claims the ice was negligently left there for days, while the defendant says the ice formed overnight and the fall happened before he could remove it. 

Now, a physician who saw the plaintiff fall testifies. On cross-examination, the defense attorney asks the physician if the plaintiff told him during treatment that the fall was due to dizziness causing loss of equilibrium. The plaintiff's attorney objects, and we need to determine if the testimony is admissible.

Hmm. I remember that in evidence law, statements made by a patient to a physician can be admissible under certain circumstances. I think there's an exception to the hearsay rule for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment. But wait, how does that apply here?

So, the question is about the admissibility of the physician's testimony regarding what the plaintiff said. The defense is trying to show that the plaintiff's fall wasn't due to the ice but perhaps due to dizziness, which would negate the defendant's liability. 

I recall that under FRE 803(4), statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment are admissible as an exception to hearsay. But in this case, the statement is about the cause of the fall, which relates to the plaintiff's condition at the time. 

Wait, but the plaintiff's statement about losing equilibrium because of dizziness would be a statement about the cause of his fall. Is that considered relevant to his medical condition? Or is it beyond the scope of what's allowed under the medical treatment exception?

I think the medical treatment exception allows for statements that are reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. So, if the plaintiff told the doctor that he fell because of dizziness, that could be relevant to the doctor's diagnosis, like whether the dizziness was a symptom of something else. 

But wait, the defense is using this statement to challenge the plaintiff's claim about the cause of the fall. So, the statement is being used for a purpose other than the patient's treatment. Does that matter? Or does the exception still apply because it was made during treatment?

Oh, right! The statement's admissibility doesn't depend on why the opposing party is using it. The exception is about the nature of the statement when it was made. So even if the defense is using it to impeach the plaintiff, as long as it was a statement made for medical purposes, it's admissible.

So, in this case, the physician's testimony about the plaintiff's statement would be admissible because it's a statement made for diagnosis or treatment. Therefore, the objection would be overruled, and the testimony is admissible.

Looking at the options, option I says it's admissible because it's reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. That seems correct. Option D says it sheds light on the plaintiff's condition, which is true but more general. Option I is more specific about the hearsay exception.

So, I think the correct answer is I.

The physician's testimony regarding the plaintiff's statement about the cause of the fall is admissible under the hearsay exception for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment. The statement was made during treatment and is reasonably pertinent to the physician's diagnosis, even though it is used by the defense to challenge the plaintiff's claim. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

I
