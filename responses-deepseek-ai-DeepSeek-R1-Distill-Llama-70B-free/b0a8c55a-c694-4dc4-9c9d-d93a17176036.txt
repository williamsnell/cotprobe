Question:

Which of the following statements about the correlation coefficient is true?

Options:

A: A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.
B: A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.
C: The correlation coefficient is always less than 0.

E: The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line are always equal.
F: The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the correlation coefficient. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I'll try to think this through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking which statement about the correlation coefficient is true. The options are A through H. I remember that the correlation coefficient, often denoted as r, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Its value ranges from -1 to +1.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables. Hmm, wait. I thought correlation doesn't imply causation. So even if r is 1, it just means a perfect linear relationship, not necessarily cause and effect. So A is probably false.

Option B: A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship. Similar to A, a -1 would mean a perfect negative linear relationship, but again, not necessarily causation. So B is also likely false.

Option C: The correlation coefficient is always less than 0. No way, because r can be positive or negative. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Correlation applies equally well to quantitative and categorical data. Wait, correlation is typically used for quantitative (numerical) data. Categorical data might use other measures, like chi-square or something else. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line are always equal. I don't think so. I remember that the slope (b) is related to r, but it's scaled by the standard deviations of the variables. Specifically, b = r*(sy/sx), so unless the standard deviations are 1, they won't be equal. So E is false.

Option F: The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs. Hmm, can that happen? Let me think. Since the slope is calculated using r and the standard deviations, the sign of the slope depends on r and the ratio of standard deviations. Wait, no. Because if r is positive, then (sy/sx) is positive (since standard deviations are positive), so b would be positive. If r is negative, then b would be negative. So the signs should match. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line. Oh right, the correlation coefficient's absolute value tells us the strength. So 0.87 and -0.87 have the same magnitude, meaning the same degree of clustering, just opposite directions. So G sounds true.

Option H: A correlation of 0 indicates a strong positive relationship. No, zero means no linear relationship. So H is wrong.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G. Here's why:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship, not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, not causation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The correlation coefficient can range from -1 to +1, so it's not always less than 0.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Correlation is primarily used for quantitative data, not categorical data.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The correlation coefficient (r) and the slope of the regression line (b) are related but not always equal, as b depends on the standard deviations of the variables.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The signs of r and the slope (b) align because b is calculated as \( r \times \frac{s_y}{s_x} \), and standard deviations are positive.
- **Option G**: Correct. The absolute values of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same strength of relationship, differing only in direction.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. A correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship, not a strong positive one.

Answer: G
