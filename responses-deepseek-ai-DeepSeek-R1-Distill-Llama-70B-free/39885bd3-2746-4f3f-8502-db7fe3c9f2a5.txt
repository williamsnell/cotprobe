Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Young's experiment. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup: a student is using a sodium vapor lamp in a Young's double-slit experiment. The slits are 1 meter away from the screen. He's adjusting the slit separation and notices that when the slits are too far apart, the interference pattern disappears. The question is asking how far apart the slits are when he can just not see the fringes anymore. The angular resolution of his eye is given as 1 minute of arc.

Hmm, I remember that for interference to be visible, the distance between the slits (d) and the wavelength of the light (λ) must be such that the interference maxima and minima are within the resolving power of the eye. When the slits are too far apart, the fringes become too close together, and the eye can't distinguish them anymore.

So, the key here is the angular resolution of the eye. I think the formula connects this angular limit to the slit separation and wavelength. Let me recall: the condition for the minimum resolvable angle is when the first minimum of the diffraction pattern falls within the central maximum of the other slit's diffraction pattern. Or was it the other way around? Wait, no, maybe it's when the spacing between fringes is equal to the resolving power of the eye.

Wait, let me think about the formula. I remember that for the limit of resolution, the Rayleigh criterion says that when the central maximum of one slit's diffraction pattern coincides with the first minimum of the other slit's pattern. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the minimum angle θ (in radians) is given by λ/(d), where d is the slit separation. Because when θ is larger than this, the fringes are too close.

Wait, yes, the angle between adjacent fringes in Young's experiment is given by θ = λ/d, where d is the slit separation. But wait, wait, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight. The distance between the slits is d, and the distance to the screen is L. So the fringe separation on the screen is given by Δy = (λ L)/d. But that's the linear distance between maxima. But the angular size would be Δy/L, which is λ/d. So θ = λ/d.

But the eye's angular resolution is θ_min = 1 minute of arc. So when the angular fringe separation θ equals θ_min, that's the limit beyond which fringes can't be seen. So we set θ = λ/d = θ_min. Solving for d would give d = λ / θ_min.

Wait, but θ is in radians. So I need to convert the angular resolution from minutes to radians. One minute is 1/60 of a degree. So 1 minute = (1/60) degrees. To convert degrees to radians: multiply by π/180. So 1 minute is (π/(60*180)) radians. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 60 minutes in a degree, right? So 1 minute is 1/(60) degrees. So in radians, that's (1/60) * (π/180) = π/(60*180) = π/(10800) radians. Let me compute that value numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute it as θ_min = (1/60) degrees converted to radians. Let me compute that. 1 degree is π/180 radians, so 1 minute is π/(60*180) = π/(10800) ≈ (3.1416)/(10800) ≈ 0.0002909 radians. Approximately 2.91e-4 radians.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's recap: the angular resolution of the eye is θ_min = 1 minute of arc, which is the smallest angle that can be resolved. The condition is when the angle between adjacent maxima (θ) is equal to θ_min. So θ = λ/d = θ_min.

Wait, but wait a second, in Young's experiment, the angle between adjacent maxima is given by λ/(d). So if the slit separation is d, then the angle between adjacent bright fringes is λ/d. So when this angle equals the eye's resolving power (θ_min), then you can't see the fringes anymore. So the maximum d where fringes just disappear is when d = λ / θ_min.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because in the double-slit experiment, the formula for the position of bright fringes is y = (m λ L)/d, where m is the order. The angle θ from the center is y/L = m λ/(d). So the angular separation between adjacent maxima is λ/d. So when θ_min = λ/d, the fringes can't be resolved.

So solving for d: d = λ / θ_min.

Now, what is λ for sodium light? Sodium emits at several wavelengths, but I think the most common one used in such experiments is the D-line, which is about 589 nm, or 589e-9 meters. So λ = 589 nm.

Wait, let me check. Sodium's D line is actually two lines, D1 and D2, at approximately 589.59 nm and 589.0 nm, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use 589 nm as the average.

So, λ = 589e-9 m.

θ_min is 1 minute of arc, which we've established is π/(10800) radians, approximately 0.0002909 radians.

So, d = λ / θ_min.

Wait, let me compute that.

d = (589e-9 m) / (π/(10800)) )

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

First, compute θ_min in radians: 1 minute = (1/60) degrees. So θ_min = (1/60) * (π/180) = π/(60*180) = π/10800.

So, θ_min = π/(10800) ≈ 3.1416 / 10800 ≈ 0.0002909 radians.

So, d = λ / θ_min = (589e-9 m) / (0.0002909).

Let me compute that.

Compute 589e-9 / 0.0002909.

Wait, 589e-9 is 5.89e-7.

Wait no, 589e-9 is 5.89e-7? No, wait: 589e-9 is 589 * 1e-9 = 5.89 * 1e-7 meters. So 5.89e-7 m.

So 5.89e-7 / 0.0002909.

Wait, 0.0002909 is 2.909e-4.

So 5.89e-7 / 2.909e-4 = (5.89 / 2.909) * 1e-3.

Calculate 5.89 / 2.909.

Well, 2.909 times 2 is about 5.818, which is close to 5.89. So 5.89 /2.909 ≈ 2.025 approximately.

So 2.025e-3 meters, which is 2.025 mm.

Wait, so d is approximately 2.025 mm.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Compute 5.89e-7 divided by 2.909e-4.

Expressed as (5.89 / 2.909) * (1e-7 / 1e-4) = (approx 2.025) * (1e-3) = 2.025e-3 m, which is 2.025 mm.

So the slit separation is approximately 2.025 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.025 mm.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Alternatively, let me compute it more precisely.

Compute 589e-9 / (π/(10800)).

So d = (589e-9) * (10800/π).

Compute 10800 / π: π is approximately 3.14159265.

10800 / 3.14159265 ≈ 10800 /3.1416 ≈ Let me compute that.

3.1416 * 3440 ≈ 10800, because 3.1416 * 3000 is 9424.8, 3.1416*3440 = 3.1416*(3000+440)= 9424.8 + (3.1416*440). 3.1416*440= 3.1416*400=1256.64, 3.1416*40=125.664, so 1256.64+125.664=1382.304. So 9424.8 + 1382.304=10807.104. So 3440 is approximately 10807, which is a bit over 10800. So 3440 gives 10807, so 3440 - (7/3.1416) ≈ 3440 - 2.23 ≈ 3437.77.

Wait maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 10800 ÷ 3.14159265.

3.14159265 × 3437.7 ≈ 3.14159265 × 3437 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 10800 ÷ 3.14159265.

Let me do this division: 10800 / 3.14159265.

3.14159265 × 3437 = ?

But perhaps I can compute 10800 ÷ 3.14159265 ≈ 3437.75.

So approximately 3437.75.

So d = 589e-9 * 3437.75.

Compute 589e-9 * 3437.75.

589 * 3437.75 = Let me compute that.

Wait, 589 * 3437.75.

Compute 589 * 3438 ≈ 589 * 3000 = 1,767,000; 589 * 438 = ?

Compute 589 * 400 = 235,600.

589 * 38 = let's compute 589 * 30 = 17,670; 589 * 8=4,712. So 17,670+4,712=22,382.

So 235,600 +22,382=257,982.

So total 1,767,000 + 257,982=2,024,982.

Wait, but wait, 3437.75 is 3437.75, so 3437.75 is 3437 + 0.75.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 589 *3437.75 = 589*(3437 + 0.75) = 589*3437 +589*0.75.

But maybe it's easier to compute 589 *3437.75 = 589 * (3437 + 3/4) = 589*3437 + 589*(3/4).

589 *3437: Let me compute 589 * 3437.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 589 ×3437.75.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute 589e-9 m * 3437.75.

So 589e-9 ×3437.75 = ?

589 × 3437.75 = let's compute 589 ×3437.75.

Wait, 3437.75 = 3437 + 0.75.

So 589 ×3437 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can approximate:

3437 × 589.

Compute 3000 ×589 = 1,767,000.

400 ×589 = 235,600.

37 ×589: 30×589=17,670; 7×589=4,123. So 17,670 +4,123=21,793.

So 1,767,000 +235,600=2,002,600 +21,793=2,024,393.

Then 589 ×0.75 = 441.75.

So total 2,024,393 +441.75=2,024,834.75.

So 589e-9 ×3437.75 = 2,024,834.75e-9 meters.

Which is 2,024,834.75e-9 m = 2,024,834.75 × 1e-9 = 2.02483475e-3 meters, which is 2.02483475 mm.

Approximately 2.025 mm. So that's 2.025 mm.

So the slit separation d is approximately 2.025 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.025 mm.

But wait, let me double-check the formula I used.

The formula I used was d = λ / θ_min.

Wait, another thought: in Young's experiment, the condition for the first minimum (destructive interference) is when d sinθ = (m + 1/2)λ, but for the maxima, it's d sinθ = m λ.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the resolving limit here. The Rayleigh criterion says that two sources are just resolvable when the angular separation is such that the maximum of one falls on the first minimum of the other. So the angle between them is θ = 1.22 λ/(d), but in this case, perhaps the angular separation between adjacent fringes is λ/d, so when this is equal to the eye's resolution, it's the limit.

Wait, maybe I should be using θ = λ/d, which is the spacing between adjacent maxima. So when θ = θ_min (eye's resolution), that's when the fringes can't be seen.

Thus, d = λ / θ_min.

So I think my initial approach was correct.

So the calculation gives d ≈ 2.025 mm, which is option C.
</think>

To determine the slit separation \( d \) when the interference fringes just disappear, we use the condition that the angular separation between adjacent fringes equals the angular resolution of the eye. The angular resolution is given as \( \theta_{\text{min}} = 1 \, \text{minute of arc} \), which is equivalent to \( \theta_{\text{min}} = \frac{\pi}{10800} \, \text{radians} \).

The angular separation between adjacent fringes in Young's double-slit experiment is given by:

\[
\theta = \frac{\lambda}{d}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light. For sodium light, \( \lambda = 589 \, \text{nm} = 589 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \). Setting \( \theta = \theta_{\text{min}} \), we solve for \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{\lambda}{\theta_{\text{min}}}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 589 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) and \( \theta_{\text{min}} = \frac{\pi}{10800} \):

\[
d = \frac{589 \times 10^{-9}}{\frac{\pi}{10800}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
d = 589 \times 10^{-9} \times \frac{10800}{\pi}
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \), compute:

\[
d \approx 589 \times 10^{-9} \times 3437.75 \, \text{m}
\]

\[
d \approx 2.025 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the slit separation when the interference fringes just cannot be seen is approximately \( 2.025 \, \text{mm} \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 2.025 mm**
