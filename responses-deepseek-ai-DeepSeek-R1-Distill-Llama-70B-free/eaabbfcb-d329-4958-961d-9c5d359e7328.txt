Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about two connected containers. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, so there are two 1-liter containers connected by a valve that's initially closed. In one container, there's liquid water in equilibrium with its vapor at 25°C. The other container is a vacuum, so it's empty—no air, no vapor, nothing.

The question is about what happens when we open the valve. And we need to consider three things: the vapor pressure, the concentration of water molecules in the vapor, and the number of molecules in the vapor state.

Alright, let's break this down. So, before opening the valve, the first container has water and its vapor. The vapor is at the vapor pressure for water at 25°C. I remember that vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor when it's in equilibrium with its liquid (or solid) phase. At 25°C, that's around 23.8 mmHg, but the exact number might not matter here—it's the concept that counts.

The second container is a vacuum, so no pressure there. When we open the valve, the system will try to reach a new equilibrium. But wait, the temperature is constant, so the vapor pressure should remain the same, right? Because vapor pressure depends only on temperature when the system is at equilibrium. Oh wait, but when the valve opens, the volume increases. How does that affect things?

Wait, the combined volume after opening the valve doubles because each container is 1 liter. So the total volume becomes 2 liters. But the vapor will expand into this new volume. But since the temperature is constant, the vapor pressure shouldn't change because it's a property of the temperature. So the vapor pressure remains the same as before.

So part (a) of the question is about vapor pressure. Since it's unchanged, that means any option where vapor pressure changes is out. Let's look at the options. Option C says vapor pressure is unchanged, which fits. Option B says it's unchanged as well. Option H also says unchanged. So we can keep those in mind.

Now, part (b) is the concentration of the water molecules in the vapor. Concentration here probably refers to the number of molecules per unit volume. Initially, the vapor was in 1 liter. After opening, it's 2 liters. So the concentration should decrease by half because the same number of molecules is now spread over double the volume. Wait, but wait—what about the fact that the vapor might condense or evaporate?

Wait, in the initial state, the container has liquid and vapor in equilibrium. When we open the valve, the vapor can expand into the vacuum. But since the temperature is held constant, the system will re-establish equilibrium. So the vapor pressure remains the same. So the total number of vapor molecules might remain the same? Or does it change?

Wait, this is where I might get confused. Let me think again. The initial state has a certain number of vapor molecules in 1L. When we open the valve, the volume doubles. If the vapor expands into the vacuum, the concentration (molecules per liter) would drop. But the system is at the same temperature, so the vapor pressure should remain the same. So the system must adjust the number of molecules to maintain the same vapor pressure at the new volume.

Wait, wait a second. Vapor pressure is independent of volume because it's a function of temperature. So when the volume increases, the system will allow more molecules into the vapor phase to maintain the same pressure. No, that doesn't sound right. Because vapor pressure is the pressure when the vapor is in equilibrium with the liquid. So if the volume increases, the system can't support more vapor unless more liquid evaporates.

Ah, so when the valve is opened, the vapor pressure in the larger volume (2L) will initially be lower than the equilibrium vapor pressure. Because the same amount of vapor is now spread over a larger volume, so the pressure drops. But since the temperature is the same, the system will try to reach the original vapor pressure again. So some of the liquid will evaporate to increase the vapor pressure back to the equilibrium value. So the number of vapor molecules will increase to fill the larger volume while maintaining the same pressure.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in a larger volume, to keep the same pressure (vapor pressure), you need more molecules. So the number of vapor molecules should increase.

Wait, but wait, the concentration is number per volume. So if the number of molecules increases by a factor of 2 (because volume doubles and pressure is same), then the concentration (n/V) would remain the same. Because n doubles and V doubles, so n/V is the same.

Wait, that's getting a bit tangled. Let me think in terms of ideal gas law. PV = nRT. Since T is constant, P should remain the same. So when V doubles, n must also double for P to stay the same (since P = nRT / V). So n doubles when V doubles. So the number of molecules (n) doubles.

But what about concentration? Concentration is n/V. So if n doubles and V doubles, n/V remains the same. So concentration doesn't change. So in part (b), the concentration remains the same.

Wait, but initially, the concentration was n/V = P/(RT). When you double V, if the system adjusts so that n doubles, then n/V remains P/(RT). So yes, concentration doesn't change.

So for part (b), concentration remains unchanged.

So let's recap:

(a) Vapor pressure: unchanged.

(b) Concentration: unchanged.

(c) Number of molecules: doubles.

So looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option C says all three are unchanged. But according to this analysis, (c) should double. So that's not correct.

Looking at the options:

Option H: Vapor pressure unchanged, concentration unchanged, number of molecules doubled. That fits.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: All unchanged. No, because number of molecules doubles.

Option H: "Vapor pressure and the concentration of the gaseous molecules remain unchanged, the number of molecules is doubled." Yes, that's exactly what I thought.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial state is 1L with vapor. When the valve opens, the volume becomes 2L. The vapor expands, so the pressure would drop, but since the system is at a fixed temperature, more liquid evaporates to restore the vapor pressure. So the number of molecules increases.

So yes, number of molecules doubles. So part (c) is number of molecules doubles.

So the correct answer should be option H.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me re-examine each part:

(a) Vapor pressure: Since temperature is constant, the vapor pressure doesn't change. So it's unchanged. So any option where (a) is unchanged is possible.

(b) Concentration: Since concentration is n/V, and n doubles while V doubles, it's n/V = same as before. So concentration is unchanged.

(c) Number of molecules: Since the volume doubles and vapor pressure is same, n must double. So in (c), number of molecules doubles.

So, the correct option is H: Vapor pressure and concentration unchanged, number of molecules doubled.

When two 1-liter containers are connected by a valve, one containing liquid water and water vapor in equilibrium at 25°C, and the other a vacuum, opening the valve allows the vapor to expand into the vacuum. The temperature is constant, so the vapor pressure remains unchanged because vapor pressure depends only on temperature at equilibrium. 

Initially, the vapor occupies 1 liter, but after the valve is opened, the total volume becomes 2 liters. The concentration of water molecules in the vapor, defined as the number of molecules per unit volume, remains unchanged because the number of molecules doubles to maintain the same vapor pressure in the doubled volume. 

Thus, the vapor pressure and concentration of water molecules in the vapor remain unchanged, while the number of molecules in the vapor state doubles. This matches the description in option H.

H: Vapor pressure and the concentration of the gaseous molecules remain unchanged, the number of molecules is doubled.

Answer: H
