Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry can be a little tricky for me. But I'll try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about neutralizing acids with calcium hydroxide. First, I need to find out how much Ca(OH)₂ is needed to neutralize 28.0 grams of HCl. Then, using that amount of Ca(OH)₂, determine how much H₃PO₄ it can neutralize. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, let's start with the first part. Neutralizing HCl with Ca(OH)₂. I remember that the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is a neutralization reaction where they form a salt and water. So Ca(OH)₂ reacting with HCl would produce CaCl₂ and H₂O. But wait, I should write the balanced equation to make sure.

The formula for calcium hydroxide is Ca(OH)₂, and HCl is hydrochloric acid. So the reaction would be:

Ca(OH)₂ + 2 HCl → CaCl₂ + 2 H₂O

Yes, that's right. So one mole of Ca(OH)₂ reacts with two moles of HCl. Got it.

Now, I need to calculate the moles of HCl first. The molar mass of HCl is H (1.008) + Cl (35.45) = 36.458 g/mol. So 28.0 grams of HCl divided by 36.458 g/mol gives moles.

Let me calculate that. 28.0 / 36.458 ≈ 0.768 moles of HCl.

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of HCl react with 1 mole of Ca(OH)₂. So the moles of Ca(OH)₂ needed would be 0.768 / 2 = 0.384 moles.

Now, finding the mass of Ca(OH)₂. The molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ is Ca (40.078) + 2*(O (16.00) + H (1.008)) = 40.078 + 2*(17.008) = 40.078 + 34.016 = 74.094 g/mol.

So 0.384 moles * 74.094 g/mol ≈ let's calculate that. 0.384 * 74 is about 28.416 grams. Hmm, looking at the options, some have around 28, 29.5, 30, etc. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 28.0 grams of HCl is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the molar masses. HCl: H is 1.008, Cl is 35.45, so 36.458 g/mol. Correct. 28.0 / 36.458 is approximately 0.768 moles. Divided by 2, since each Ca(OH)₂ reacts with 2 HCl, gives 0.384 moles of Ca(OH)₂. 

Molar mass of Ca(OH)₂: Ca is 40.08, each OH is 17.007 (16.00 for O and 1.007 for H). So 40.08 + 2*(17.007) = 40.08 + 34.014 = 74.094 g/mol. So 0.384 * 74.094 = let's compute this more accurately. 

0.384 * 70 = 26.88. 0.384 * 4.094 ≈ approx 0.384 *4 is 1.536, plus 0.384 * 0.094≈0.036. So total around 1.572. So 26.88 +1.572 is about 28.45 grams. So approximately 28.45 grams of Ca(OH)₂.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.4 grams, which is close. Option H is 29.5, which is a bit higher, and others are higher or lower. So perhaps the first part is 28.4 grams, so the first part of the answer is 28.4 g Ca(OH)₂.

Now, the second part: what weight of H3PO4 would this weight of Ca(OH)₂ neutralize. So same amount of Ca(OH)₂, which is 0.384 moles, but now reacting with phosphoric acid.

Phosphoric acid is H3PO4. So I need to find the reaction between Ca(OH)₂ and H3PO4. Let me write the balanced equation.

Calcium hydroxide is a base, and H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. So each H3PO4 can donate three H+ ions. The reaction would produce calcium phosphate and water. Let me think: Ca(OH)₂ reacting with H3PO4.

The general reaction would be:

Ca(OH)₂ + H3PO4 → Ca3(PO4)₂ + H2O? Wait, no, wait. Let me get the correct stoichiometry. Or perhaps it's:

H3PO4 can donate three protons. Each OH- from Ca(OH)₂ can accept one proton. So for each H3PO4, it would need 3 OH- to neutralize. Since each Ca(OH)₂ gives 2 OH- (because formula is Ca(OH)₂ → Ca²+ + 2 OH⁻), so for each Ca(OH)₂, 2 OH⁻ are available.

So for each H3PO4 (which has 3 H+), we need 3 OH⁻. Since each Ca(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻, the ratio would be:

H3PO4 + 3/2 Ca(OH)₂ → ... ?

Wait, maybe writing the balanced equation:

The reaction between Ca(OH)₂ and H3PO4 would be:

2 H3PO4 + 3 Ca(OH)₂ → Ca3(PO4)2 + 6 H2O

Let me check. On the left: 2 H3PO4 → 2*(H3PO4) = 6 H, 2 P, 8 O. On the right: Ca3(PO4)2 has 3 Ca, 2 PO4^3- → 2 P, 8 O. Water is H2O, 6 H2O → 12 H, 6 O. 

Wait, let's balance the equation properly. 

H3PO4 has H, P, O. Ca(OH)₂ has Ca, O, H.

The products would be calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2) and water.

Let me count each element.

Left side: H3PO4 has 3 H, 1 P, 4 O. Ca(OH)₂ has Ca, 2 OH- (so 2 O and 2 H).

Right side: Ca3(PO4)2 → 3 Ca, 2 P, 8 O. Water is H2O.

So let's balance each element.

First, balance P. On left, from H3PO4: suppose we have 'a' moles of H3PO4 and 'b' moles of Ca(OH)₂.

So P: a = 2 in Ca3(PO4)2. So a = 2 (since each H3PO4 has 1 P, so 2 H3PO4 → 2 P). So a=2.

Then, Ca: on the left, b moles of Ca(OH)₂ → b moles of Ca. On the right, 3 moles. So b must be 3?

Wait, no, because Ca(OH)₂ is a reactant. So to get Ca3(PO4)2, which is 3 Ca per molecule, so we need 3 Ca from Ca(OH)₂. So each mole of Ca(OH)₂ gives 1 mole of Ca²+ → so b = 3.

Wait, but that would mean:

Left side: Ca from b moles Ca(OH)₂ → b moles. Right side: 3 moles. So b=3.

So now, we have:

2 H3PO4 + 3 Ca(OH)₂ → Ca3(PO4)2 + H2O

Now, balance O and H.

Left O: from H3PO4: each has 4 O, 2 *4=8 O. Ca(OH)₂: each has 2 OH → 2 O per mole. So 3 Ca(OH)₂ → 3 * 2 =6 O. Total O: 8+6=14 O.

Right side: Ca3(PO4)2 has 8 O (each PO4^3- has 4 O, 2 of them → 8). Water has 1 O per molecule; let's say 'c' moles, so O is 8 + c =14 → c=6. So 6 H2O.

Now, H: left side: H3PO4 → 2 *3 =6 H. Ca(OH)₂ → 3 *2=6 H. Total H: 6+6=12 H.

Right side: H2O has 2 H per mole, 6 moles → 12 H. Perfect, so H is balanced.

So the balanced equation is 2 H3PO4 + 3 Ca(OH)₂ → Ca3(PO4)2 + 6 H2O.

Wait, that makes sense. So the mole ratio is 2 H3PO4 : 3 Ca(OH)₂. So for every 3 moles of Ca(OH)₂, 2 moles of H3PO4 are neutralized.

Alternatively, the mole ratio of Ca(OH)₂ to H3PO4 is 3:2. So for each mole of Ca(OH)₂, (2/3) mole of H3PO4 is neutralized.

Wait, no, let me think again. From the equation, 3 moles of Ca(OH)₂ react with 2 moles of H3PO4. So for each mole of Ca(OH)₂, it reacts with (2/3) mole of H3PO4. Or, in terms of neutralization, how much H3PO4 can 1 mole of Ca(OH)₂ neutralize?

Wait, each mole of Ca(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH- (because Ca(OH)₂ → Ca²+ + 2 OH⁻). Each mole of H3PO4 can donate 3 H+ (since it's triprotic). So to neutralize 3 moles of H+ (from one mole of H3PO4), you need 3 moles of OH-.

Each mole of Ca(OH)₂ gives 2 moles of OH-. So for each H3PO4, you need (3 OH-) per H3PO4 → so moles of Ca(OH)₂ needed per mole of H3PO4 is 3/2.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of equivalents. Because neutralization is about H+ and OH-.

H3PO4 has 3 acidic protons (if we consider it fully ionizes, which might not be the case, but in stoichiometry, we treat it as such). So each mole of H3PO4 provides 3 equivalents of acid.

Similarly, each mole of Ca(OH)₂ provides 2 equivalents of base (since each OH- is one equivalent).

So to neutralize one mole of H3PO4 (3 equivalents), you need 3 equivalents of base. Each mole of Ca(OH)₂ is 2 equivalents, so you need (3/2) moles Ca(OH)₂ per mole of H3PO4.

Alternatively, per equivalent of base, you can neutralize an equivalent of acid.

So, the equivalent concept is:

Equivalents of base (from Ca(OH)₂) = moles of Ca(OH)₂ * 2.

Equivalents of acid (from H3PO4) = moles of H3PO4 * 3.

At neutralization, equivalents are equal.

So, 2 * n(Ca(OH)₂) = 3 * n(H3PO4).

So, n(H3PO4) = (2/3) * n(Ca(OH)₂).

Wait, that makes sense. So for each mole of Ca(OH)₂, you can neutralize (2/3) moles of H3PO4.

Wait, no, wait, let me clarify. Let's say you have x moles of H3PO4. Each provides 3x equivalents. You have y moles of Ca(OH)₂, providing 2y equivalents. So 3x = 2y → x = (2/3) y.

So, for y moles of Ca(OH)₂, you can neutralize (2/3)y moles of H3PO4.

So in our problem, we have 0.384 moles of Ca(OH)₂. So, the moles of H3PO4 that can be neutralized would be (2/3) * 0.384 = 0.256 moles.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because each mole of Ca(OH)₂ gives 2 OH- (so 2 equivalents), and each H3PO4 needs 3 equivalents (since it has 3 H+). So the ratio is 2:3.

So for every 2 equivalents of base, you need 3 equivalents of acid. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of equivalents.

The amount of Ca(OH)₂ is 0.384 moles, each providing 2 equivalents, so total equivalents = 0.384 * 2 = 0.768 equivalents.

Each mole of H3PO4 requires 3 equivalents to neutralize, so moles of H3PO4 = 0.768 / 3 = 0.256 moles.

Yes, that's correct. So 0.256 moles of H3PO4.

Now, to find the mass, I need the molar mass of H3PO4. H is 1.008, P is 30.974, O is 16.00.

So H3PO4: 3*(1.008) + 30.974 + 4*(16.00) = 3.024 + 30.974 + 64 = 98.0 g/mol approximately.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately.

H: 3 * 1.008 = 3.024

P: 30.974

O: 4 * 16.00 = 64.00

Total: 3.024 +30.974=34.0 (approx) +64=98.0 g/mol.

So 0.256 moles * 98.0 g/mol = ?

0.256 * 98 → let's compute this.

0.25 *98=24.5, 0.006 *98=0.588 → total 25.088 grams.

So approximately 25.1 grams.

Looking at the options, the first part was approximately 28.4 grams of Ca(OH)₂, which is option C. The second part is about 25.1 grams of H3PO4. 

So looking at option C: 28.4 g of Ca(OH)₂, 25.1 g of H3PO4. That matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)₂, required to neutralize 28.0 g of hydrochloric acid (HCl), and then calculate how much phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) this amount of Ca(OH)₂ can neutralize.

### Part 1: Neutralizing HCl with Ca(OH)₂

The reaction between Ca(OH)₂ and HCl is:

\[
\text{Ca(OH)}_2 + 2 \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{CaCl}_2 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

1. **Moles of HCl**:  
   The molar mass of HCl is \( 36.458 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = \frac{\text{Mass of HCl}}{\text{Molar Mass of HCl}} = \frac{28.0}{36.458} \approx 0.768 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Moles of Ca(OH)₂**:  
   From the balanced equation, 2 moles of HCl react with 1 mole of Ca(OH)₂.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ca(OH)}_2 = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{2} = \frac{0.768}{2} = 0.384 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Mass of Ca(OH)₂**:  
   The molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ is \( 74.094 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   \[
   \text{Mass of Ca(OH)}_2 = \text{Moles of Ca(OH)}_2 \times \text{Molar Mass of Ca(OH)}_2 = 0.384 \times 74.094 \approx 28.4 \, \text{g}
   \]

Thus, the weight of Ca(OH)₂ required to neutralize 28.0 g of HCl is approximately **28.4 g**.

### Part 2: Neutralizing H₃PO₄ with Ca(OH)₂

The reaction between Ca(OH)₂ and H₃PO₄ is:

\[
2 \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 + 3 \text{Ca(OH)}_2 \rightarrow \text{Ca}_3\text{(PO}_4\text{)}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

1. **Moles of H₃PO₄ Neutralized**:  
   From the balanced equation, 3 moles of Ca(OH)₂ neutralize 2 moles of H₃PO₄.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_3\text{PO}_4 = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Moles of Ca(OH)}_2 = \frac{2}{3} \times 0.384 \approx 0.256 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Mass of H₃PO₄**:  
   The molar mass of H₃PO₄ is \( 98.
