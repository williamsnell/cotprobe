Okay, so I have this question about Utilitarianism, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by recalling what I know about Utilitarianism. 

From what I remember, Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that suggests an action is right if it benefits the majority. The main idea is the greatest good for the greatest number. The philosophy was developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. So the core principle is maximizing overall happiness or utility.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that matches this description. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: It says the action is right if it promotes the greatest good for the decision maker. Hmm, that sounds more like egoism, where the focus is on self-interest, not the majority. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: It talks about a balanced distribution of good and bad outcomes. That doesn't quite fit Utilitarianism, which is more about maximizing good rather than balancing. So B might not be it.

Option C: Promotes the greatest good for the fewest people. That seems opposite because Utilitarianism is about the majority, not the minority. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Promotes the least harm for the greatest number. Wait, that sounds more like the principle of doing no harm, maybe related to other theories like the Harm Principle, but Utilitarianism is about maximizing good, not just minimizing harm. Though I'm a bit confused here because sometimes people conflate minimizing harm with maximizing good. I'll come back to this.

Option E: The action is wrong if it promotes the greatest good for the majority. That's the opposite of Utilitarianism. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The action is incorrect if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number. Again, opposite of Utilitarianism's stance, so F is wrong.

Option G: The action is right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number. This matches exactly what I remember about Utilitarianism. So G looks correct.

Option H: Promotes the greatest harm for the smallest number. That's the opposite; Utilitarianism is about good, not harm. So H is out.

Option I: Greatest good for the individual performing the action. That's more like ethical egoism again, not Utilitarianism. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Greatest good for the smallest number. Again, opposite of Utilitarianism, which focuses on the majority. So J is wrong.

Wait, let me double-check about Option D. It says "the least harm for the greatest number." While Utilitarianism does aim for the overall good, which could involve minimizing harm, the primary focus is on maximizing good outcomes, not just minimizing harm. So D might be a part of it but not the defining characteristic. So G is still the better choice.

So the correct answer should be G.

The correct description of Utilitarianism is that it is a theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.

Answer: G
