Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: the sum of two square roots equals another square root. The equation is sqrt(x² + x +1) + sqrt(2x² +x +5) = sqrt(x² -3x +13). Hmm, I'm a bit nervous because square roots can be tricky, especially when they're all in an equation like this. But I'll give it a shot.

First, I remember that when dealing with square roots in equations, sometimes squaring both sides can help eliminate them. But I also know that squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'd have to check any solutions I get at the end.

Let me write down the equation again to make it clearer:

sqrt(x² + x +1) + sqrt(2x² +x +5) = sqrt(x² -3x +13)

I think I'll call the left side A and the right side B for simplicity. So, A = B. If I square both sides, I get A² = B². Let's compute both A² and B².

A is sqrt(x² +x +1) + sqrt(2x² +x +5). So, A² would be (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))², which is a + b + 2*sqrt(a*b). So, A² = (x² +x +1) + (2x² +x +5) + 2*sqrt((x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)).

Let me compute that: (x² + 2x²) is 3x², (x +x) is 2x, (1+5) is 6. So, A² = 3x² + 2x +6 + 2*sqrt[(x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)].

On the right side, B is sqrt(x² -3x +13), so B² is x² -3x +13.

So after squaring, the equation becomes:

3x² + 2x +6 + 2*sqrt[(x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)] = x² -3x +13.

Let me move all terms except the square root to one side. Subtract (x² -3x +13) from both sides:

(3x² +2x +6) - (x² -3x +13) + 2*sqrt[...] = 0.

Calculating that:

3x² - x² = 2x²
2x - (-3x) = 5x
6 -13 = -7

So, 2x² +5x -7 + 2*sqrt[(x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)] = 0.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me rearrange it:

2*sqrt[(x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)] = - (2x² +5x -7).

Wait, the left side is 2 times a square root, which is always non-negative (assuming the expressions inside are non-negative). The right side is negative of (2x² +5x -7). So, for this equation to hold, the right side must also be non-negative because the left is non-negative. Therefore, -(2x² +5x -7) ≥ 0 → 2x² +5x -7 ≤ 0.

So I can find the interval where 2x² +5x -7 ≤0. Let me find the roots of 2x² +5x -7 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-5 ± sqrt(25 + 56)] /4 = [-5 ± sqrt(81)]/4 = [-5 ±9]/4.

So, x = (4)/4=1, or x=(-14)/4=-3.5. So the quadratic is ≤0 between x=-3.5 and x=1. So any solution must lie in this interval.

Now, going back to the equation: 2*sqrt[...] = - (2x² +5x -7).

Let me divide both sides by 2:

sqrt[(x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)] = (-2x² -5x +7)/2.

Now, I'll square both sides again to eliminate the square root. But before I do that, I should make sure that the right side is non-negative because sqrt is always non-negative. So (-2x² -5x +7)/2 ≥0 → -2x² -5x +7 ≥0 → 2x² +5x -7 ≤0, which is the same condition as before. So we're okay in the interval x ∈ [-3.5, 1].

Squaring both sides:

[(x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)] = [(-2x² -5x +7)/2]^2.

Let me compute both sides.

Left side: (x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5).

I'll multiply these two quadratics.

Let me expand term by term.

First term: x²*(2x²) = 2x⁴
x²*(x) = x^3
x²*(5) =5x²
x*(2x²)=2x^3
x*(x)=x²
x*(5)=5x
1*(2x²)=2x²
1*(x)=x
1*(5)=5.

Now, add all these together:

2x⁴ + x³ +5x² +2x³ +x² +5x +2x² +x +5.

Combine like terms:

2x⁴
x³ +2x³ =3x³
5x² +x² +2x² =8x²
5x +x =6x
+5.

So left side is 2x⁴ +3x³ +8x² +6x +5.

Right side: [(-2x² -5x +7)/2]^2.

Let me compute numerator squared first: (-2x² -5x +7)^2.

Expanding this, let a = -2x², b = -5x, c=7.

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² +2ab +2ac +2bc.

a² = ( -2x² )^2 =4x⁴
b²=25x²
c²=49
2ab = 2*(-2x²)*(-5x) = 20x³
2ac = 2*(-2x²)*7 = -28x²
2bc =2*(-5x)*7 = -70x.

So, putting it together:

4x⁴ +25x² +49 +20x³ -28x² -70x.

Combine like terms:

4x⁴
20x³
25x² -28x² = -3x²
-70x
+49.

So, numerator squared is 4x⁴ +20x³ -3x² -70x +49.

Now, the right side is [numerator]/(2^2)=4, so (4x⁴ +20x³ -3x² -70x +49)/4.

So, the equation becomes:

Left side = right side → 2x⁴ +3x³ +8x² +6x +5 = (4x⁴ +20x³ -3x² -70x +49)/4.

To eliminate the denominator, multiply both sides by 4:

4*(2x⁴ +3x³ +8x² +6x +5) =4x⁴ +20x³ -3x² -70x +49.

Compute left side:

4*2x⁴=8x⁴
4*3x³=12x³
4*8x²=32x²
4*6x=24x
4*5=20.

So, left side is 8x⁴ +12x³ +32x² +24x +20.

Set equal to right side:

8x⁴ +12x³ +32x² +24x +20 =4x⁴ +20x³ -3x² -70x +49.

Bring all terms to left side:

8x⁴ -4x⁴ =4x⁴
12x³ -20x³= -8x³
32x² - (-3x²)=35x²
24x - (-70x)=94x
20 -49= -29.

So, the equation becomes:

4x⁴ -8x³ +35x² +94x -29 =0.

Now I have a quartic equation, which is a fourth-degree polynomial. Solving quartic equations can be tough, but maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.

Let me try using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (29) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (4). So possible roots: ±1, ±29, ±1/2, ±29/2, ±1/4, ±29/4.

I'll test x=1: 4(1)^4 -8(1)^3 +35(1)^2 +94(1) -29 =4 -8 +35 +94 -29= (4-8)= -4; (-4 +35)=31; 31+94=125; 125-29=96 ≠0. So not a root.

x= -1: 4(-1)^4=4; -8(-1)^3=8; 35(-1)^2=35; 94*(-1)=-94; -29. So 4+8=12; 12+35=47; 47-94=-47; -47-29= -76 ≠0.

x=29: That's a big number; probably not a root. Let me try x=1/2.

x=1/2:

4*(1/2)^4 =4*(1/16)=1/4
-8*(1/2)^3= -8*(1/8)= -1
35*(1/2)^2=35*(1/4)=35/4=8.75
94*(1/2)=47
-29.

Adding them up: 0.25 -1 = -0.75; -0.75 +8.75=8; 8+47=55; 55-29=26≠0.

x= -1/2:

4*(-1/2)^4=4*(1/16)=0.25
-8*(-1/2)^3= -8*(-1/8)=1
35*(-1/2)^2=35*(1/4)=8.75
94*(-1/2)= -47
-29.

Adding up: 0.25 +1=1.25; +8.75=10; -47= -37; -37-29= -66≠0.

x=29/2: That's 14.5, which seems too big. Let me try x=1/4.

x=1/4:

4*(1/4)^4=4*(1/256)=1/64≈0.0156
-8*(1/4)^3= -8*(1/64)= -0.125
35*(1/4)^2=35*(1/16)=≈2.1875
94*(1/4)=23.5
-29.

Adding up: 0.0156 -0.125= -0.1094; +2.1875=2.0781; +23.5=25.5781; -29≈-3.4219≠0.

x= -1/4:

4*(-1/4)^4=4*(1/256)=1/64≈0.0156
-8*(-1/4)^3= -8*(-1/64)=0.125
35*(-1/4)^2=35*(1/16)=≈2.1875
94*(-1/4)= -23.5
-29.

Sum: 0.0156 +0.125=0.1406; +2.1875≈2.3281; -23.5= -21.1719; -29≈-50.1719≠0.

x=29/4=7.25, which seems way too big. Maybe x= -29/4, which is -7.25. That's probably not a root either.

Hmm, none of the rational roots seem to work. Maybe I made a mistake in expanding earlier. Let me double-check the expansion steps.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Maybe graphing the original functions to see where they intersect could help. Alternatively, since the equation is complicated, perhaps substitution might help.

Alternatively, maybe I can plug in the options given to see which ones satisfy the equation. Since the options are given as multiple choice, perhaps that's easier.

Looking at the options, they all have two roots, except option D which is empty, and J which is [0,2]. Let me check each option.

But wait, I should first check if the expressions under the square roots are non-negative for the x-values in the options.

Let me check the domains:

For sqrt(x² +x +1), the expression inside is x² +x +1. The discriminant is 1 -4 = -3 <0, so it's always positive. So no problem here.

For sqrt(2x² +x +5): discriminant is 1 -40= -39 <0, so always positive.

For sqrt(x² -3x +13): discriminant 9 -52= -43 <0, always positive.

So all square roots are defined for all real x. So any real x is allowed.

Now, perhaps I can test the options given. Let me look at option A: [0.2807764064, -1.7807764064]. Let me take x=0.2807764064 and see if it satisfies the equation.

Compute each sqrt:

sqrt(x² +x +1): x≈0.28

x²≈0.078, x=0.28

So 0.078 +0.28 +1≈1.358. sqrt≈1.165.

sqrt(2x² +x +5): 2*(0.078)=0.156, +0.28=0.436, +5=5.436. sqrt≈2.33.

Sum of left side: 1.165 +2.33≈3.495.

Right side sqrt(x² -3x +13): x²≈0.078, -3x≈-0.84. So 0.078 -0.84 +13≈12.238. sqrt≈3.496.

Hmm, that's very close. So x≈0.28 seems to satisfy the equation. Now let's check x≈-1.7807764064.

x≈-1.78.

Compute left side:

x²≈3.17, x=-1.78.

sqrt(x² +x +1): 3.17 + (-1.78) +1≈2.39. sqrt≈1.546.

sqrt(2x² +x +5): 2*(3.17)=6.34, + (-1.78)=4.56, +5=9.56. sqrt≈3.092.

Sum≈1.546 +3.092≈4.638.

Right side: sqrt(x² -3x +13). x²≈3.17, -3x≈5.34. So 3.17 +5.34 +13≈21.51. sqrt≈4.639.

Again, very close, so x≈-1.78 is also a solution.

Wait, but earlier when I squared the equation, I might have introduced extraneous roots, so I need to make sure these solutions actually satisfy the original equation.

But since both x≈0.28 and x≈-1.78 are close, and in the interval [-3.5, 1], they might be valid.

Looking at the options, option A is [0.2807764064, -1.7807764064]. But wait, in ascending order, it should be [-1.78..., 0.28...]. So option A is [0.28, -1.78], which is not in order. Looking at the options, option I is [-1.780..., 0.280...], which is in order. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, looking back, option A is [0.2807..., -1.7807...], and option I is [-1.7807..., 0.2807...].

Hmm, but the correct list should be in ascending order, so the smaller number comes first. So the correct list would be [-1.7807..., 0.2807...]. Looking at the options, option I is that. Option A is the reverse.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: [0.2807764064, -1.7807764064]

I: [-1.7807764064, 0.2807764064]

So if the correct roots are approximately -1.78 and 0.28, then the correct list is I, since it's in ascending order.

Wait, but earlier when I tested x=0.28, it worked, and x=-1.78 worked as well. So the solutions are x≈-1.78 and x≈0.28. So the correct answer should be option I.

But wait, let me check if any other options could have these roots. Or perhaps I should see if any other options have these values.

Looking at the options, option I is [-1.780..., 0.280...], which matches our findings.

But earlier when I was solving, I obtained a quartic equation which didn't factor nicely, so perhaps the solutions are indeed these two roots. Therefore, the correct option is I.
</think>

To solve the equation 

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + \sqrt{2x^2 + x + 5} = \sqrt{x^2 - 3x + 13},
\]

we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots. Let \( A = \sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + \sqrt{2x^2 + x + 5} \) and \( B = \sqrt{x^2 - 3x + 13} \). Then \( A = B \), and squaring both sides gives:

\[
A^2 = B^2.
\]

Expanding \( A^2 \) as \( (\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b
