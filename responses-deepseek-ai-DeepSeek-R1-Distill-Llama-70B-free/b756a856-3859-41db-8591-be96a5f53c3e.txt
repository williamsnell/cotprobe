Alright, so I've got this question about Kohlberg’s cognitive-developmental theory and the initial stage of gender-role acquisition. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I remember that Kohlberg's theory has to do with how children develop their understanding of gender.

I think his theory is a bit different from others like Freud or Social Learning Theory. Kohlberg's approach is more about cognitive development, so it's about how children think and understand concepts. I recall that he proposed that children go through stages in understanding gender roles.

Wait, the question is about the initial stage. So the first stage must be when children start to become aware of gender. I think the first stage is something like knowing whether they're a boy or a girl. But I'm not sure about the exact term he used.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is gender identity. That sounds familiar. I think gender identity is the first stage where the child labels themselves as male or female. But I'm not entirely certain because sometimes people confuse stages.

Option J is gender constancy. I remember that term being a later stage. That's when children understand that their gender doesn't change despite superficial changes, like cutting their hair or wearing different clothes. So that's probably not the first stage.

Option G is gender awareness. That sounds like it could be the initial stage because it's about becoming aware of gender. But I thought Kohlberg's first stage was about identity, not just awareness.

Wait, maybe I should break down the stages. From what I remember, the stages are something like:

1. Gender Identity: The child can label themselves and others as male or female.
2. Gender Stability: The child understands that gender remains the same over time, but might think it's based on superficial things.
3. Gender Constancy: The child realizes that gender is a constant despite changes in appearance or activities.

So the initial stage would be Gender Identity, which is option A. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the first stage was just about basic awareness of gender, like knowing you're a boy or girl, which is gender identity.

Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another theory. For example, in Social Learning Theory, the first step is also labeling, so maybe it's similar here.

So I think the answer is A: gender identity. But wait, I'm second-guessing because sometimes the initial stage is called something else. Another thought: I've heard of the term "gender awareness" as the first step, which would be option G. But I'm not sure if that's Kohlberg's term.

Wait, no, I think Kohlberg's stages are more about the child's reasoning. So the first stage is when the child can identify their own gender, which is gender identity. So the answer should be A.

The initial stage of gender-role acquisition in Kohlberg’s cognitive-developmental theory is **gender identity**, where children begin to label themselves and others as male or female. This stage is the foundation for further development in understanding gender roles.
