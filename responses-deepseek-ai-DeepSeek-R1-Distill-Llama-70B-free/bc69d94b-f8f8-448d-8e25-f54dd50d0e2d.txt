Question:

On his 21st birthday, a son enlisted in the army. As he was about to leave for eight weeks of basic training, his father said, "I will buy you a new car at the end of basic training if you promise me not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol while at basic training. " The son replied, "You can order the new car right away. I promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol, as you requested. "At the end of basic training, the son was given a leave and returned home. His father asked, "Did you abide by your promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol?" The son replied, "Yes, Father. " The father then told the son that he had already ordered the new car and that it would be available for delivery within one month. One week later, the son received the tragic news that his father had died suddenly. At the funeral, the executor of the father's estate told the son that he did not feel compelled to give the son the newly arrived car. In a suit against the executor of the father's estate to recover the new car, the son will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the father's death nullifies his promise.
B: not succeed, because the father's promise was void.
C: not succeed, because the executor of the estate has the final say.
D: not succeed, because the son's promise did not constitute a legal contract.
E: succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.
F: not succeed, because the father's promise was only a conditional gift.

Okay, so I have this legal question to tackle, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The scenario is about a son and his father. On the son's 21st birthday, he enlists in the army. As he's about to leave for basic training, his father makes a promise: he'll buy the son a new car if he promises not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol during training. The son agrees and promises. At the end of training, the father says he's already ordered the car, which will be delivered in a month. But then, the father dies suddenly, and the executor of the estate refuses to give the son the car. The son sues to get the car, and we need to determine if he'll succeed.

Hmm. So the main issue here is about contracts and whether a valid contract was formed between the father and son. I remember that for a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, both parties must have the capacity to contract, and the contract must be legal.

Let me break it down. The father's offer was to buy a car in exchange for the son's promise not to drink or do drugs during training. The son accepted by promising, and he kept that promise. So there's an offer and acceptance. But what about consideration?

Consideration is something of value given in exchange for a promise. The son's promise to abstain from alcohol and drugs would typically count as consideration because it's a detriment to him—he's restricting his own behavior. So that should satisfy the consideration requirement.

Wait, but sometimes promises to do something you're already supposed to do don't count. Like, if someone promises not to commit illegal acts, is that sufficient consideration? Because not taking illegal drugs is something he's legally obligated to do anyway. Does that affect the consideration?

I think the rule is that if you're already under a legal duty to do something, promising to do it isn't sufficient consideration. So, for example, if a police officer promises not to take a bribe, that's not consideration because it's their job. But in this case, the son is an adult, 21, so maybe the legal duty is different.

Wait, but the son is in basic training. Are there specific rules in the military about drinking or drug use that he's already bound by? If he's in the army, perhaps he's under a duty to follow those rules regardless of his father's promise. If that's the case, then his promise might not be sufficient consideration because he's not giving up anything extra—he's just adhering to his existing obligations.

So, if the son's promise was to do something he was already required to do (like following military rules against substance abuse), then there's no consideration. Without consideration, there's no enforceable contract. That would mean the father's promise to buy the car wasn't supported by consideration, making the agreement unenforceable.

Looking at the options, option E says the son will succeed because his promise provided consideration. But if my analysis is correct, that's not the case. So E would be wrong.

Option D says the son won't succeed because his promise didn't constitute a legal contract. That would align with the no-consideration argument. But wait, what about the pre-existing duty rule? If he was already supposed to not take drugs or drink (as per military rules), then his promise to do so isn't consideration.

Alternatively, maybe the father's promise was a gift, not a contract. Gifts don't require consideration. But the father's statement was conditional—he said he'd buy the car if the son promised not to drink or do drugs. So it sounds more like an offer for a contract than a gift.

Wait, but contracts require mutuality of consideration. If the son's promise wasn't sufficient, then the contract isn't valid. So the father's promise was conditional on the son's performance, but without consideration, the condition isn't met. So the father's estate might not be obligated.

Another angle: even if there wasn't consideration, if the father has already ordered the car, maybe there's promissory estoppel. The son relied on the promise to his detriment. But promissory estoppel is usually when there's a clear promise, reliance, and injustice if the promise isn't kept. However, in this case, the son didn't incur any detriment beyond keeping his promise, which may not count as a detriment for reliance purposes.

Alternatively, if the father had already ordered the car, perhaps there's an argument that the contract was already fulfilled, but the son didn't receive it because the father died. But the delivery was supposed to be in a month, so the father died before delivery, and the executor is refusing to deliver.

Wait, but the father had already ordered the car. So maybe the contract was fully performed on the son's side—he completed the training and kept his promise. So the father's obligation was to deliver the car, but he died before that. So the executor would have to fulfill the contract, right?

Unless the contract wasn't valid in the first place. So going back, the key issue is whether the son's promise was sufficient consideration.

I think the answer hinges on whether the son's promise was a legal detriment. If he was already required by law (or military rules) to not take drugs or drink, then his promise doesn't add anything. So no consideration, no contract. Therefore, the son can't enforce it.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: not succeed because the son's promise didn't constitute a legal contract.

Option E: succeed because the promise provided consideration.

If consideration is lacking, D would be the right choice. But wait, another thought: sometimes, a promise to forbear from a legal right can be consideration. For example, if the son had a right to drink, and he agreed not to, that could be consideration. But if he didn't have a legal right to drink (maybe because of military rules), then it's not a detriment.

Alternatively, if the son was 21 and could legally drink, but in the military, perhaps there are rules against it. So his forbearance could be a detriment.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the case of Hamer v. Sidway, where consideration was discussed. In that case, the uncle promised the nephew money if he didn't drink, smoke, or gamble until he was 21. The court held that the nephew's forbearance was sufficient consideration because he was giving up his legal right to engage in those activities. So even though he was under a moral duty, the law didn't prohibit them, so his promise was a legal detriment.

In this case, the son is in the military. If the military prohibits drinking or taking drugs, then the son is under a legal duty not to do so. So promising to do something he's already required to do wouldn't add any consideration. Therefore, no contract.

So based on that, the son can't enforce the contract because there's no consideration. Thus, the executor doesn't have to give him the car.

Looking at the options, option E says he'll succeed because his promise provided consideration. But according to the analysis, that's not the case, so E is incorrect.

Option D says the son won't succeed because his promise didn't constitute a legal contract. That seems correct because without consideration, there's no contract.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option F says he won't succeed because the father's promise was a conditional gift. A conditional gift would require consideration, but if it's a gift, it's not based on consideration. But the father's promise was in exchange for the son's promise, so it's more of a contract than a gift.

Option A says the father's death nullifies the promise. But contracts can be enforceable against estates, so that's not the issue.

Option B says the father's promise was void. I don't see why it would be void; the issue is whether it's enforceable.

Option C says the executor has the final say, but executors must carry out the estate's obligations, including contracts.

So, the correct answer seems to be D.

Wait, but in the Hamer case, the nephew was giving up a legal right, so it was consideration. Here, the son is in the military, where he's prohibited from drinking or drugs. So he's giving up nothing because he can't do it anyway. Therefore, no consideration.

Thus, the son can't enforce the contract, so he won't succeed.

So the answer should be D: not succeed, because the son's promise did not constitute a legal contract.

The question revolves around whether a valid contract was formed between the father and the son. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. The father's promise to buy a car was conditioned on the son's promise not to drink alcohol or take illegal drugs during basic training. The son accepted and fulfilled this condition. However, the critical issue is whether the son's promise constituted sufficient consideration.

Consideration requires a legal detriment or the surrender of a legal right. If the son was already under a legal or military obligation to refrain from drinking or taking drugs, his promise to do so does not constitute a legal detriment, as he was not giving up anything beyond his existing obligations. Without sufficient consideration, no enforceable contract was formed.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The father's death does not nullify the promise; the issue is whether the promise was enforceable in the first place.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The father's promise was not void; it lacked enforceability due to insufficient consideration.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Executors are obligated to fulfill the estate's contractual obligations, provided a valid contract exists.
- **Option D**: Correct. The son's promise did not constitute a legal contract because it lacked sufficient consideration.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The son's promise was not sufficient consideration if it involved only complying with pre-existing obligations.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The father's promise was not a conditional gift but rather an offer for a contract, which failed due to lack of consideration.

Thus, the son will not succeed because his promise did not constitute a legal contract.
