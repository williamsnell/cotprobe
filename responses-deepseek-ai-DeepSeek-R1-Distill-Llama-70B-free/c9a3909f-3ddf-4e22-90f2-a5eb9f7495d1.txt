Source 1
If then by the Use of Machines, the Manufacture of Cotton, an Article which we import, and are supplied with from other Countries, and which can everywhere be procured on equal Terms, has met with such amazing Success, may not greater Advantages be reasonably expected from cultivating to the utmost the Manufacture of Wool, the Produce of our own Island, an Article in Demand in all Countries, almost the universal Clothing of Mankind?
In the Manufacture of Woollens, the Scribbling Mill, the Spinning Frame, and the Fly Shuttle, have reduced manual Labour nearly One third, and each of them at its-first Introduction carried an Alarm to the Work People, yet each has contributed to advance the Wages and to increase the Trade, so that if an Attempt was now made to deprive us of the Use of them, there is no Doubt, but every Person engaged in the Business, would exert himself to defend them.
—Statement by the Cloth Merchants of Leeds, 1791

Come, cropper lads of high renown,
Who love to drink good ale that's brown,
And strike each haughty tyrant down,
With hatchet, pike, and gun!
Oh, the cropper lads for me,
The gallant lads for me,
Who with lusty stroke,
The shear frames broke,
The cropper lads for me!
What though the specials still advance,
And soldiers nightly round us prance;
The cropper lads still lead the dance,
With hatchet, pike, and gun!
Oh, the cropper lads for me,
The gallant lads for me,
Who with lusty stroke
The shear frames broke,
The cropper lads for me!
—Luddite Song, The Cropper's Song, c. 1812

Answer:

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which economic theory Source 1 is referencing. Let's read the question again. It's about the expansion and use of machines, so I need to connect that to one of the given options.

Looking at Source 1, it's talking about the success of machines in manufacturing cotton, which they import, and suggests that wool, which is their own produce, could bring even greater advantages. They mention specific inventions like the scribbling mill, spinning frame, and fly shuttle reducing manual labor by a third. Each invention initially caused alarm among workers but ended up increasing wages and trade. So, the cloth merchants are arguing that using machinery benefits the economy by increasing trade and wages, despite initial resistance from workers.

Now, the question is asking which economic theory this supports. The options are A to J, each a different theory.

Let me go through the options:

A: Laissez-faire capitalism - This is about minimal government intervention, letting the market regulate itself. Source 1 doesn't mention government intervention, so maybe not directly related.

B: Protectionism - This involves protecting domestic industries with tariffs, etc. Source 1 talks about manufacturing their own wool, which could relate, but it's more about using machinery than protecting from foreign competition.

C: Bullionism - Focuses on accumulating precious metals, not directly relevant here.

D: Socialism - Advocates for collective ownership, which doesn't fit with the merchants' argument.

E: Monetarism - Relates to money supply and inflation, not the use of machinery.

F: Marxism - Focuses on class struggle, but Source 1 is more about the positive impact of machinery, not class conflict.

G: Industrialization - This is more of a process than an economic theory. The source is about the benefits of machines, which is part of industrialization, but the theory behind it might be different.

H: Mercantilism - Emphasizes exports and state control. The source talks about increasing trade, which mercantilism supports, but it's more about using machinery than state policies.

I: Free Trade - Advocates for unrestricted trade. The source mentions imports and that cotton can be procured on equal terms, suggesting they're open to trade. Also, increasing domestic manufacturing could tie into expanding trade opportunities.

J: Keynesian economics - Focuses on government spending and demand, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, the source is promoting the use of machinery to increase production and trade. They're suggesting that by manufacturing wool, which is their own product, they can expand their trade. This sounds like they're supporting free trade because they're not suggesting protecting their industry but rather increasing their own production to compete and export.

Alternatively, mercantilism focuses on maximizing exports to get more gold, but the source doesn't mention anything about gold or bullion. It's more about the efficiency and expansion through machinery.

Another angle: The cloth merchants are using the example of cotton manufacturing (which they import) to argue that wool (their own) can be even better. They're talking about increasing their own manufacturing to meet demand, which would increase their exports. So this aligns with free trade because they are producing for the international market without protectionist measures.

So the answer is probably I: Free Trade.

Wait, but another thought. The merchants are from Leeds, which was a center for wool production. They're emphasizing using their own resources to produce more, which could tie into mercantilist ideas of increasing domestic industry for export. But mercantilism is more about state policies, like subsidies or monopolies, whereas the source is talking about technological advancement.

Hmm. Alternatively, the idea that they're promoting manufacturing to increase trade and wealth aligns with mercantilism, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's industrialization, but that's not a theory.

Wait, the question is about which economic theory is being referenced. The source is arguing that using machinery increases productivity, which in turn increases trade and wages. This sounds like the benefits of industrialization and perhaps the idea that free trade allows for specializing in what you're good at, which is a part of free trade theory.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The source says that wool is in demand everywhere, so by manufacturing more wool, they can export more. This is about producing for foreign markets, which is a key aspect of mercantilism, which seeks to maximize exports to gain wealth. But mercantilism is more state-driven, whereas the source is from merchants advocating for their own industry's expansion.

Alternatively, classical economics, which includes free trade ideas, would support the use of machinery to increase efficiency and production, leading to greater trade. Adam Smith's ideas about the division of labor and machinery increasing productivity would support this. So the merchants are aligning with the idea that increasing production through machinery will lead to greater trade and prosperity, which is part of free trade and classical economics.

So I think the correct answer is I: Free Trade.

The source emphasizes the benefits of using machinery to increase productivity and expand trade, particularly in manufacturing wool, which is the produce of their own island. It highlights how inventions like the scribbling mill and spinning frame reduced manual labor and ultimately increased wages and trade. This aligns with the idea that increasing domestic production through technological advancements can lead to greater trade and prosperity. 

Among the options, free trade is the most fitting economic theory because it advocates for the unrestricted exchange of goods and services, allowing nations to specialize in producing what they are most efficient at. The source suggests that by expanding wool production, they can meet international demand, which reflects the principles of free trade. While mercantilism also focuses on increasing exports, it typically involves state intervention, which is not mentioned here. Instead, the focus is on the natural expansion of trade through technological progress and efficiency.
