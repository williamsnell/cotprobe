Question:

Find the determinate of matrix A A =\vert23\vert \vert12\vert.

Options:

A: 0
B: 2
C: 5
D: -3
E: -1
F: 3
G: 1
H: 4
I: -2
J: 6

Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the determinant of a matrix A. The matrix is given as A equals the absolute value of 23 and 12. Wait, no, that's probably not right. Let me read the question again. Oh, right, the matrix A is written with vertical bars, which I think represents a 2x2 matrix.

So the matrix A is:

|23|
|12|

Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh, wait, maybe the matrix is:

[2  3]
[1  2]

Because the vertical bars are surrounding the numbers, like |23| might mean the first row is 2 and 3, and |12| as the second row is 1 and 2. So the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix with entries [2,3] in the first row and [1,2] in the second row.

To find the determinant of a 2x2 matrix, the formula is (a*d) - (b*c), where the matrix is [[a, b], [c, d]]. So applying that here, a is 2, b is 3, c is 1, d is 2.

So the determinant would be (2*2) - (3*1) = 4 - 3 = 1.

Looking at the options, option G is 1. So the answer should be G.

The matrix \( A \) is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant of a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \(\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}\) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{det}(A) = ad - bc.
\]

Substituting the values from matrix \( A \):

\[
\text{det}(A) = (2)(2) - (3)(1) = 4 - 3 = 1.
\]

Thus, the determinant of matrix \( A \) is 1.

The correct answer is:

G: 1

Answer: G
