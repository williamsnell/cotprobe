Okay, so I need to figure out how Freudian theory accounts for homosexuality. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Freud, but I'll try to remember. I know Freud was a psychoanalyst and his theories are about the unconscious mind and early life experiences.

Wait, Freud talked about the Oedipus complex, right? That's when a child has unconscious sexual desires for the opposite-sex parent. So maybe homosexuality has something to do with that. Oh right, I think in his theory, if someone doesn't resolve the Oedipal conflict properly, it might lead to certain behaviors or fixations.

I remember something about the Electra complex for girls, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. So for boys, the Oedipus complex involves desiring the mother and feeling rivalry with the father. If this isn't resolved, what happens? Maybe the individual doesn't develop heterosexual feelings properly.

I think Freud believed that homosexuality could result from an unresolved Oedipal conflict. Like, if a boy doesn't overcome his desire for his mother and fear of his father, he might turn to same-sex relationships because he's afraid of the opposite sex. So it's not about choice but about early psychological development.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: Overbearing mother. I'm not sure if that's the main point. It might be a factor, but I think it's more about the conflict and fear.

Option B: Latent desires from childhood. Maybe, but I think it's more specific than that.

Option C: Trauma in adolescence. I don't recall Freud linking it to trauma specifically in adolescence.

Option D: Unresolved Oedipal conflict and fear of opposite sex. That sounds right. This aligns with what I was thinking.

Option E: Lack of same-sex role models. I think that's more from other theories, maybe social learning, not Freudian.

Option F: Hormone imbalance. Freud was more about psychology, not biology, so probably not.

Option G: Choice. No, Freud didn't see it as a choice but as a result of unconscious conflicts.

Option H: Innate from birth. I don't think Freud believed it was innate; he saw it as developmental.

Option I: Genetic. Again, Freud's theory wasn't biological, so unlikely.

Option J: Learned behavior. Maybe some behavioral aspects, but Freud's approach is more psychosexual stages and unconscious drives.

So the correct answer should be D.

Freudian theory attributes homosexuality to unresolved psychological conflicts, particularly the Oedipal conflict, where fear of sexual contact with the opposite sex arises from early life events. This aligns with option D, which correctly captures Freud's perspective on the matter.

Answer: D
