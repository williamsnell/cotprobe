Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the minimum vertex cover of a graph. Hmm, I remember that a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. And the goal is to find the smallest such set.

The graph given has edges E = {<2,1>, <2,0>, <2,3>, <1,4>, <4,3>}. Wait, actually, the edges are undirected, so each edge is between two nodes. Let me try to visualize this. Maybe I should draw the graph to get a better idea.

So the nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's list the edges again:

- 2 connected to 1
- 2 connected to 0
- 2 connected to 3
- 1 connected to 4
- 4 connected to 3

So node 2 is connected to 0,1,3. Node 1 is connected to 2 and 4. Node 4 is connected to 1 and 3. Node 3 is connected to 2,4. Node 0 is only connected to 2.

Wait, so the graph looks something like this:

2 is the central node connected to 0,1,3. 1 is connected to 4, and 4 is connected to 3. So 1-4-3 forms a chain connected to 2.

I need to find the smallest set of nodes such that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set.

I think I can approach this using Konig's theorem, which relates the size of the maximum matching to the minimum vertex cover in bipartite graphs. But wait, is this graph bipartite? Let me check.

Looking at the graph, I can try to color it with two colors. Let's assign color A to node 0. Then node 2, connected to 0, must be color B. Node 1 is connected to 2 (B) so it's color A. Node 4 is connected to 1 (A), so color B. Node 3 is connected to 2 (B) and 4 (B), so it can be color A. So the coloring is possible, so it's bipartite.

So Konig's applies. The minimum vertex cover equals the maximum matching's size.

Wait, but to find the maximum matching, maybe I can do that. Or perhaps I can find a matching and see.

Alternatively, since the graph is small, maybe I can find the vertex cover manually.

Another approach is to look for all possible edges and see which nodes can cover them with minimal selection.

Let me list all edges and see which nodes cover them:

Edges:
- (0,2) → covered by 0 or 2
- (1,2) → covered by 1 or 2
- (2,3) → covered by 2 or 3
- (1,4) → covered by 1 or 4
- (3,4) → covered by 3 or 4

I need to choose a set of nodes so that each edge is covered.

Let me think of possible options.

Option 1: Choose 2 and 3.

Covering:
- (0,2): 2 covers it.
- (1,2): 2 covers it.
- (2,3): 2 or 3, both are in set.
- (1,4): Neither 2 nor 3 is here. So this edge isn't covered. Oh wait, so this option is invalid because it leaves (1,4) uncovered.

So that can't be right. So [2,3] isn't a valid vertex cover.

Looking at the options, option A is [2,3], which must be incorrect because of the (1,4) edge.

Option 2: Choose 2 and 4.

Let's see:
- (0,2): 2 → covered.
- (1,2): 2 → covered.
- (2,3): 2 → covered.
- (1,4): 4 → covered.
- (3,4): 4 → covered.

So yes, all edges are covered. So [2,4] is a vertex cover. Are there any smaller options? Because the size here is 2.

Wait, the question is about the minimum. So is there a vertex cover of size 2?

If yes, then that's our answer. Let's see.

Wait, another option: what if I choose 2 and 1.

Then:

- (0,2) → 2.
- (1,2) → 1 or 2.
- (2,3) → 2.
- (1,4) → 1.
- (3,4) → neither, so not covered. So this set [1,2] isn't sufficient.

So that's invalid.

Another option: choose 2 and 4. As before, that works.

Wait, so [2,4] is a vertex cover of size 2. Are there any covers with just one node? Let me think.

If I choose node 2 alone: covers edges (0,2), (1,2), (2,3). But doesn't cover (1,4) and (3,4). So that's not enough.

Similarly, choosing node 1 would cover (1,2) and (1,4), but not the others.

So the minimum size is 2. Now, let's see if [2,4] is an option.

Looking at the options, option G is [2,4]. So that's a possible correct answer.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. Are there other vertex covers of size 2?

What about [2,3,4], which is option J. That's size 3, which is larger than 2, so [2,4] is better.

Alternatively, what about [3,4] as a cover? Let's check:

- (0,2) → neither 3 nor 4 → not covered. So no.

Another option: [1,4]. Check:

- (0,2): not covered.
So no.

Another option: [2,1,4]. That would be size 3, which is larger than [2,4], so not needed.

So the minimal vertex cover is [2,4], which is option G.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Because sometimes Konig's theorem would give maximum matching, but perhaps I should think in terms of maximum matching.

Wait, in bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum matching equals the size of the minimum vertex cover. So if I can find a maximum matching of size 2, then the minimum vertex cover is size 2.

Looking at the graph, what's a maximum matching? A matching is a set of edges with no shared vertices.

Possible matchings:

Option 1: (0,2) and (1,4). That's two edges, and they don't share any nodes. So maximum matching size is 2.

So according to Konig's, the minimum vertex cover should have 2 nodes.

Which matches our earlier finding that [2,4] is a valid vertex cover of size 2.

So the correct answer is option G: [2,4], right.

To determine the minimum vertex cover of the given undirected graph \( G \) with edges \( E = \{<2,1>, <2,0>, <2,3>, <1,4>, <4,3>\} \), we need a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest such set.

### Key Observations:
1. **Graph Structure**: The graph is bipartite, as it can be colored with two colors without conflicts. This allows the use of Konig's theorem, which states that in bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum matching equals the size of the minimum vertex cover.

2. **Edges and Coverage**:
   - \( (0,2) \): Covered by 0 or 2.
   - \( (1,2) \): Covered by 1 or 2.
   - \( (2,3) \): Covered by 2 or 3.
   - \( (1,4) \): Covered by 1 or 4.
   - \( (3,4) \): Covered by 3 or 4.

3. **Finding the Minimum Vertex Cover**:
   - A vertex cover must cover all edges. Testing smaller sets:
     - \( [2,3] \): Fails to cover \( (1,4) \).
     - \( [2,1] \): Fails to cover \( (3,4) \).
     - \( [2,4] \): Covers all edges:
       - \( (0,2) \): 2.
       - \( (1,2) \): 2.
       - \( (2,3) \): 2.
       - \( (1,4) \): 4.
       - \( (3,4) \): 4.
     - Larger sets, such as \( [2,3,4] \), are valid but not minimal since \( [2,4] \) suffices.

4. **Maximum Matching**:
   - A maximum matching of size 2 exists (e.g., \( (0,2) \) and \( (1,4) \)), confirming that the minimum vertex cover size is 2.

### Conclusion:
The smallest vertex cover is \( [2,4] \), which covers all edges and has the minimum size of 2.
