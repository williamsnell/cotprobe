Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the molar heat capacity at constant pressure for argon gas. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that when 229 J of heat is supplied to 3.0 moles of Ar gas at constant pressure, the temperature increases by 2.55 K. I need to find the molar heat capacity (Cp) for Ar under these conditions.

Wait, molar heat capacity at constant pressure... right, that's the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one mole of a gas by one Kelvin when pressure is constant. The formula I remember is Cp = (q) / (nΔT), where q is the heat added, n is the number of moles, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

So let's plug in the numbers. q is 229 J, n is 3.0 mol, and ΔT is 2.55 K. So Cp equals 229 divided by (3.0 times 2.55). Let me calculate that denominator first. 3.0 multiplied by 2.55 is 7.65. Then 229 divided by 7.65... Hmm, what's that?

Wait, 7.65 times 30 is 229.5, which is just a bit more than 229. So 229 / 7.65 is approximately 30 J/(mol·K). Oh, but wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let me do the division: 229 ÷ 7.65.

Let me see, 7.65 goes into 229 how many times? 7.65 * 30 is 229.5, which is just 0.5 more than 229. So maybe 30 - (0.5/7.65). 0.5 divided by 7.65 is approximately 0.065. So 30 - 0.065 is about 29.935 J/(mol·K). So roughly 30 J/(mol·K).

Looking at the options, option E is 30 J/(mol·K). So that's the answer, right? But wait, I should double-check if I used the right formula.

Wait, another thought: is argon a monatomic gas? Yes, Ar is monoatomic. For monoatomic ideal gases, the molar heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) is (5/2)R, where R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K). Let me compute that: (5/2)*8.314 = 5 *4.157 = 20.785 J/(mol·K). Wait, that's around 20.8, which doesn't match 30. So what's going on here?

Hmm, this is confusing. Did I get the formula wrong? Because the calculation from the problem gives me around 30, but the theoretical value for a monoatomic gas is around 20.8. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers. The heat q is 229 J, n is 3.0 mol, ΔT is 2.55 K. So 3 * 2.55 is 7.65. 229 divided by 7.65 is 30, right? Because 7.65 * 30 = 229.5, which is just a half a joule more than 229. So maybe the correct Cp is 30 J/(K·mol). But that's inconsistent with the expected value for Ar.

Wait a second, maybe the problem isn't considering Ar as a monoatomic gas, but that can't be right. Or perhaps the question is asking for the molar heat capacity in a different context. Alternatively, maybe I forgot to account for something in the formula.

Wait, another thought: the formula for heat at constant pressure is q = n Cp ΔT. So yes, I used that correctly. So according to the given data, Cp is approximately 30 J/K·mol. But that's higher than the theoretical value. So perhaps the question is correct, and the right answer is 30, which is option E.

So why is there a discrepancy with the theoretical value? Oh, maybe the problem assumes the gas is not ideal, but the question does state to assume all gases are perfect, so ideal gas behavior is expected. That makes it more confusing.

Wait, another thing: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 229 /7.65 accurately. Let's do it step by step.

7.65 times 29 is 7.65 *30 is 229.5, minus 7.65 gives 221.85. But 7.65 *29= 221.85, which is less than 229. The difference is 229 - 221.85=7.15. Now, 7.15 divided by 7.65 is approximately 0.934. So 29 + 0.934 = 29.934, so approximately 29.93 J/(mol·K). So about 30.

So regardless of the theory, according to the given data, the Cp is 30. So the correct answer must be option E, which is 30 J/(K·mol).

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because for monoatomic gases, the Cp is (5/2) R, which is about 20.785 J/(mol·K). So why does the calculation here give me 30? That's way off.

Is there any chance that the gas is diatomic? No, Ar is noble gas, monoatomic. Did I mess up the formula? No, the formula is correct. So perhaps the question has a typo or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps the heat was supplied at constant volume, not pressure. No, the problem says constant pressure, so Cp. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question gives the total heat capacity, not molar.

Wait, no, the question specifically asks for molar heat capacity. So this is confusing. Unless perhaps I should re-derive the formula.

Wait, the relation is Cp = (q)/(nΔT). So that should be correct. So with the given numbers, it's 229/(3*2.55) = 229/(7.65) = ~30.

So according to the data given, the Cp is about 30, which would be option E.

But that's not matching the expected value for monoatomic gas. So perhaps the problem is not considering monoatomic gas? But that doesn't make sense because Ar is monoatomic.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is trying to test the formula, not the actual Cp value of Ar. So regardless of what I know about Ar, just compute based on the data.

So the answer would be 30, option E.

To calculate the molar heat capacity at constant pressure ($C_p$) of argon gas, we use the formula:

\[
C_p = \frac{q}{n \Delta T}
\]

where:
- \( q = 229 \, \mathrm{J} \) (heat supplied),
- \( n = 3.0 \, \mathrm{mol} \) (number of moles),
- \( \Delta T = 2.55 \, \mathrm{K} \) (temperature change).

Substituting the values:

\[
C_p = \frac{229}{3.0 \times 2.55} = \frac{229}{7.65} \approx 30 \, \mathrm{J~K^{-1}~mol^{-1}}
\]

This calculation gives a value of approximately \( 30 \, \mathrm{J~K^{-1}~mol^{-1}} \). However, for a monoatomic ideal gas like argon, the theoretical value of \( C_p \) is \( \frac{5}{2}R \), where \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J~K^{-1}~mol^{-1}} \), resulting in:

\[
C_p = \frac{5}{2} \times 8.314 = 20.785 \, \mathrm{J~K^{-1}~mol^{-1}}
\]

This discrepancy suggests that the problem may not align with the theoretical value of \( C_p \) for monoatomic argon. Nevertheless, based on the given data, the calculated value of \( C_p \) is \( 30 \, \mathrm{J~K^{-1}~mol^{-1}} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
