Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a symmetric random walk on a three-dimensional cubic lattice, like Z³, is transient or persistent. Hmm, I remember that in probability theory, a random walk can be classified based on whether it returns to the origin infinitely often or not. But wait, what's the difference between transient and persistent again?

Oh right, a persistent (or recurrent) walk is one where the walker almost surely returns to the starting point infinitely many times. On the other hand, a transient walk means that the walker will eventually move away and not return, so the probability of returning is less than one.

Now, thinking about different dimensions. I recall that in one dimension, a symmetric random walk is persistent. Like, the simple ±1 on a line, the walker will come back to the origin with probability 1. But wait, is that right? Or is it that in 1D and 2D it's recurrent, and in higher dimensions like 3D it's transient?

Wait, let me think. For a 2D lattice, I think the symmetric random walk is also recurrent. I remember something about the Gambler's Ruin problem and how in 2D, the walker has a certain probability to return. So in 2D, it's persistent.

But what about 3D? I think in three dimensions, the situation changes. Because each step has more directions to move away, the likelihood of returning decreases. So the walk becomes transient. Oh yeah, I remember reading that in three or more dimensions, the random walk is transient. The walker has a higher chance to 'get lost' and not come back.

So for this question, symmetric random walk on Z³ is transient. The question asks to return 1 for persistent and 0 for transient. So the answer should be 0.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.0. So the correct choice is A.

A symmetric random walk on a three-dimensional cubic lattice (Z³) is transient. This is because in three or more dimensions, the walker has a higher likelihood of moving away from the origin without returning, making the walk transient. In contrast, in one and two dimensions, symmetric random walks are recurrent, meaning the walker almost surely returns to the origin infinitely often. Since the question asks to return 1 for persistent and 0 for transient, the correct answer is 0. 

The correct option is A: 0.0.
