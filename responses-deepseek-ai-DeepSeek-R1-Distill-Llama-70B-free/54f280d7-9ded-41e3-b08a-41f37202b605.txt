Question:

A man kidnapped a victim in State A and transported the victim across the state border into State B. These actions violated the kidnapping laws of both states, which are identical. A jury convicted the man in a State A court, but the trial judge gave what prosecutors in State B deemed an unduly lenient sentence. The state prosecutor in State B then commenced a kidnapping case against the man for violating State B's kidnapping statute. The man's lawyer has filed a motion in State B to dismiss the charge based on the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the man's single act of kidnapping. Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?

Options:

A: No, because the man committed two separate acts of kidnapping, one in each state.
B: Yes, because the man was already tried and convicted for the same crime in State A.
C: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection applies to both state and federal laws.
D: No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws. right to enforce its laws.
E: No, because the double jeopardy protection only applies to federal law.
F: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection applies even when laws of different states are identical.
G: No, because the man's sentence in State A was deemed unduly lenient in State B.
H: Yes, because the government is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy protection from prosecuting a defendant a second time for the same conduct that led to an earlier conviction.
I: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.
J: No, because the double jeopardy protection only prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.

Okay, so I have this question about double jeopardy, and I'm a bit new to the concept, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, a man kidnaps a victim in State A and takes them to State B. Both states have the same kidnapping laws. He was tried and convicted in State A, but the sentence was too lenient for State B's taste. Now, State B is prosecuting him for the same kidnapping under their own statute. His lawyer is saying this is double jeopardy.

I remember that double jeopardy is in the Fifth Amendment, right? Something about not being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But wait, I think there's a distinction between state and federal prosecutions. Oh right, the dual sovereignty doctrine! That's the one where state and federal governments can each prosecute someone for the same act because they're separate sovereigns. So, if someone is tried in state court, the federal government can try them again for the same conduct under federal law.

But in this case, both states have identical laws. So, if he was convicted in State A, can State B prosecute him again? Well, the question is about two states prosecuting, so are they considered the same sovereign? I think each state is a separate sovereign, so under dual sovereignty, each can prosecute. So State B can prosecute him even after State A did.

Wait, but the options. Let's look at the options. The correct answer would be that double jeopardy doesn't apply because each state can prosecute. So looking at the options:

Option A says he committed two separate acts, but that doesn't sound right because it's one continuous act of kidnapping, just crossing the state line. So maybe that's incorrect.

Option B says yes, because he was tried in State A. But if dual sovereignty applies, that's not correct.

Option C says yes because double jeopardy applies to state and federal. But I think the opposite; state and federal can each prosecute. So C is wrong.

Option D says no because each state can enforce their own laws. That sounds right because each is a separate sovereign.

Option E says double jeopardy only applies to federal, which is incorrect because it applies within the same sovereign.

Option F says yes because the laws are identical. No, because same sovereign? No, different states.

Option G says no because the sentence was lenient, but that's not about double jeopardy. So G is about why State B is prosecuting, not whether they can.

Option H talks about collateral estoppel, which is a different concept. Collateral estoppel is about issues already decided, not double jeopardy. So H is incorrect.

Option I says yes because same offense. But again, if it's different sovereigns, then no.

Option J says no because it only applies after acquittal. No, double jeopardy applies after conviction as well. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be D: No, because each state can enforce their own laws. But wait, let me think again. The dual sovereignty doctrine applies when two different sovereigns prosecute. So if State A and State B are separate sovereigns, then each can prosecute. So the court should not grant the motion to dismiss.

So the answer would be D.

The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment protects against being tried twice for the same offense by the same sovereign. However, under the dual sovereignty doctrine, separate sovereigns—such as two different states—can each prosecute an individual for the same conduct. In this case, State A and State B are distinct sovereigns, even though their kidnapping laws are identical. Therefore, State B has the right to prosecute the man for violating its own kidnapping statute, despite his prior conviction in State A.

Answer: D
