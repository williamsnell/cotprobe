Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about contracts, specifically in the context of attorney-client relationships. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says: "Where a client accepts the services of an attorney without an agreement concerning the amount of the fee, there is..." And then it gives options from A to J.

First, I need to remember what each of these contract types means. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. So, when two parties make a contract, if they don't specify certain terms, like the fee here, the law might imply some terms based on the circumstances.

I remember that contracts can be express or implied. Express contracts are where the terms are explicitly stated, either orally or in writing. Implied contracts are where the agreement is shown by the actions of the parties, not necessarily stated outright.

Wait, so if an attorney provides services and the client accepts them without discussing the fee, the law probably assumes that the client will pay a reasonable amount. This sounds like an implied contract because the agreement is inferred from their actions rather than explicit terms.

Now, looking at the options. Option A is an express contract. That can't be right because there's no agreement on the fee. Option B is a unilateral contract, which is where one party makes a promise in exchange for an action, like a reward. Doesn't fit here because both parties are doing something—attorney providing service, client accepting it.

Option C is an executory contract. I'm not too sure about this one. I think executory contracts are those that are still to be performed, not fully executed. But I'm not certain if that's the right category here.

Option D is a quasi contract. Quasi contracts are more about when the law imposes an obligation as if there was a contract, but when there wasn't really an agreement. Like in cases of unjust enrichment. But in this case, the client did accept the services, so maybe it's not quasi.

Option E is an implied-in-law contract. I think this is similar to quasi contracts. Implied-in-law contracts are created by the law to enforce justice, not based on the parties' actual intent. So again, maybe not the case here because the client did accept the services, implying some form of agreement.

Option F is an oral contract. Well, the question doesn't specify whether there was an oral agreement or not. It just says there's no agreement on the fee. So maybe the overall contract isn't oral; perhaps it's a mix.

Option G says there's no contract. That doesn't seem right because the client is accepting services, so there's some form of agreement.

Option H is an implied-in-fact contract. Implied-in-fact contracts are based on the parties' conduct, suggesting mutual agreement. So if the attorney provides services and the client accepts, the law would imply the terms, like a reasonable fee. This sounds likely.

Option I is a written contract. The question doesn't say anything about it being written, so this is probably not it.

Option J is a void contract. No, a void contract is one that's unenforceable from the start, but here the services were accepted, so the contract exists in some form.

So putting it together: the attorney and client have an implied contract based on their actions—services rendered and accepted. So the correct term would be an implied-in-fact contract, which is option H. Wait, but another thought—some might confuse this with quasi contract. But quasi contract (option D) is more about when there's no actual agreement, but the law imposes one. Here, there's an implied agreement, so H makes more sense.

Also, I remember that implied-in-fact contracts are based on the circumstances, like when a doctor treats a patient and expects to be paid. Similarly, an attorney providing services without a fee agreement would fall into this category.

So the answer should be H.

When a client accepts an attorney's services without an agreement on the fee, the situation involves an implied contract. Specifically, the law infers the terms of the agreement based on the parties' conduct—here, the attorney providing services and the client accepting them. This type of contract is called an implied-in-fact contract, as it is based on the parties' actions rather than explicit terms. Other options like quasi contract or express contract do not fit because the client's acceptance of services implies mutual agreement, and the law enforces a reasonable fee. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: H
