Okay, so I've got this question about Mani and what name he used to refer to God. I'm not too familiar with Mani, but I remember that he's the founder of Manichaeism. I think Manichaeism is a religious movement that was quite influential historically, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Let me try to recall. Mani lived in the 3rd century AD, in Persia, I believe. His teachings were a mix of different religions, perhaps blending elements from Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

The question is asking about the specific name Mani used for God. The options are A through J, each with different titles. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Looking at the options:

A: Eternal Spirit
B: Divine Guardian
C: Light Bringer
D: Heavenly Guide
E: Mother of Light
F: Infinite Wisdom
G: Ineffable Lover
H: Grand Architect
I: Father of Goodness
J: Supreme Creator

I remember that Manichaeism has a strong dualistic view, where the universe is divided into good and evil, light and darkness. So, the name for God would probably relate to light since light often symbolizes good in such dualistic systems.

Option C is "Light Bringer." That sounds familiar. I think in some contexts, Mani referred to God as the Bringer of Light. Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, I think the term "Father of Greatness" or something similar is used, but I don't see that here.

Wait, another angle: Mani's theology might personify God as the source of light, opposing the darkness. So Light Bringer makes sense because it's someone who brings light into the world, fighting against darkness.

Looking at other options, "Father of Goodness" (I) is a possibility, but I'm not sure that's the specific term Mani used. "Supreme Creator" (J) is a common term in many religions, but I think Manichaeism might have a more specific title.

I'm trying to remember if there's a specific term. Oh, wait, I think in Manichaeism, the primary deity is the "Father of Greatness" or "Father of Lights." But "Light Bringer" isn't exactly that. Alternatively, "Light Bringer" is more of a role, like someone bringing light, which fits the dualistic theme.

Alternatively, I recall that in some Gnostic traditions, similar terms are used, and Manichaeism has Gnostic elements. So perhaps "Light Bringer" is correct.

I'm going to go with option C: Light Bringer.

Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, referred to God using a name that aligns with the religion's dualistic view of the universe, emphasizing the struggle between light and darkness. Among the options provided, "Light Bringer" (option C) is the most appropriate, as it reflects the deity's role in bringing light to combat darkness, a central theme in Manichaeism.

Answer: C
