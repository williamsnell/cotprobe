Okay, so I've got this problem here about Keiko bird watching. Let me try to understand what it's asking. So, Keiko counted more birds in the morning than in the afternoon. The difference is 34 birds. And the total she counted in both sessions is 76 birds. I need to find out how many she saw in the afternoon.

Hmm, right. So let's break it down. Let's say the number of birds she saw in the afternoon is A. And the morning count is M. According to the problem, M is 34 more than A. So M = A + 34.

And together, the total is M + A = 76. Oh, wait, that's right. So substituting M from the first equation into the second, we get (A + 34) + A = 76. Let's compute that.

So that's 2A + 34 = 76. Subtract 34 from both sides: 2A = 42. Then divide both sides by 2: A = 21. So she saw 21 birds in the afternoon.

Wait, but let me double-check. If she saw 21 in the afternoon, then the morning would be 21 +34 =55. 55 +21 is 76. Yep, that adds up. So the answer must be 21 birds.

Looking at the options, option C is 21. So the answer should be C.

The problem involves determining how many birds Keiko counted in the afternoon. Let \( A \) represent the number of birds counted in the afternoon, and \( M \) the number in the morning. According to the problem:

1. \( M = A + 34 \) (she counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon).
2. \( M + A = 76 \) (the total number of birds counted).

Substituting \( M \) from the first equation into the second:

\[
(A + 34) + A = 76
\]

Simplifying:

\[
2A + 34 = 76
\]

Subtract 34 from both sides:

\[
2A = 42
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
A = 21
\]

Thus, Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon. Verifying, if \( A = 21 \), then \( M = 21 + 34 = 55 \), and \( 21 + 55 = 76 \), which matches the total given.

The correct answer is **C: 21 birds**.
