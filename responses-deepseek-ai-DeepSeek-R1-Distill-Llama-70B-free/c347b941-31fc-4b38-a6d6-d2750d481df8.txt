Question:

We are interested in the capacity of photographic film. The film consists of silver iodide crystals, Poisson distributed, with a density of 100 particles per unit area. The film is illuminated without knowledge of the position of the silver iodide particles. It is then developed and the receiver sees only the silver iodide particles that have been illuminated. It is assumed that light incident on a cell exposes the grain if it is there and otherwise results in a blank response. Silver iodide particles that are not illuminated and vacant portions of the film remain blank. We make the following assumptions: We grid the film very finely into cells of area $dA$. It is assumed that there is at most one silver iodide particle per cell and that no silver iodide particle is intersected by the cell boundaries. Thus, the film can be considered to be a large number of parallel binary asymmetric channels with crossover probability $1 - 100dA$. What is the capacity of a 0.1 unit area film?

Okay, so I've got this question about the capacity of photographic film modeled as a binary asymmetric channel. Hmm, I remember that channel capacity is a concept from information theory, right? So the film has silver iodide particles that are Poisson distributed. The density is 100 particles per unit area. So in a unit area, there are on average 100 particles.

The film is divided into very small cells, each of area dA. Each cell can have at most one particle, I think. And the particles don't cross cell boundaries. So each cell is like a binary state: either it has a particle (1) or it doesn't (0). The crossover probability is given as 1 - 100dA. Wait, what's a crossover here? Oh right, in binary asymmetric channels, the crossover probability is the probability that a transmitted 0 is received as 1, or vice versa. But here, the model is a bit different. The setup is that when light hits a cell, if there's a particle, it's exposed. If not, it's blank. But the particles are randomly placed, so their presence is a Poisson process.

Wait, no, the problem says that when the film is illuminated, each cell's particle is exposed if it's there. So the channel here is modeling the probability that a particle is in a cell (and thus affects the exposure) versus not. But I'm a bit confused about how this translates into the binary asymmetric channel.

So each cell is a binary asymmetric channel. The input is whether the particle is present (1) or not (0). The output is whether it's exposed (1) or not (0). The crossover probabilities are given: for a channel with input X and output Y, the crossover probabilities are P(Y=1|X=0)=ε, and P(Y=0|X=1)=δ. But wait, the question says the crossover probability is 1 - 100dA. Hmm, I might need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem states that the crossover probability is 1 - 100dA. So does that mean that the probability that a particle is not present but appears as present (or vice versa)? Wait, no, the way the channel is set up: when a particle is present in a cell, it is illuminated; otherwise, it's blank. But perhaps the problem is considering the process where the presence of a particle is the input, and the exposure is the output. But the particles are Poisson distributed, so the probability that a cell has a particle is, say, p.

Wait, the Poisson distribution with parameter λ, where λ is the average number of particles per cell. The density is 100 per unit area, so for a cell of area dA, λ = 100 * dA. Since dA is very small, λ is a small number. For a Poisson distribution, the probability that there's exactly one particle in the cell is approximately λ, because for small λ, P(k=1) ≈ λ * e^(-λ) ≈ λ. And P(k=0) ≈ e^(-λ) ≈ 1 - λ.

But the setup says that each cell is considered as a binary asymmetric channel with crossover probability 1 - 100dA. Wait, so the crossover is when a particle isn't there, but the light makes it seem like it is. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, perhaps I've got to model the channel correctly.

Wait, the film has silver iodide particles. The light illuminates, and if a particle is present, it's exposed. So the presence of a particle (input 1) leads to exposure (output 1). But the problem is considering that the particles are Poisson distributed, so each cell's state is random. I think the channel model here is a bit different. Maybe the input is whether the cell is illuminated or not, but that's not quite right.

Wait, the problem statement says: It is assumed that light incident on a cell exposes the grain if it is there and otherwise results in a blank response. So, if the cell has a grain (particle), light will expose it (so output 1). If there's no grain, the light doesn't expose it (output 0). But the grains are randomly placed, so the presence of the grain is a random variable. So the process is: for each cell, X (input) is 1 if the grain is present, 0 otherwise. But wait, the input is not being transmitted; the grain's presence is the source. So the received signal is Y, which is 1 if X=1 (because the grain is there and exposed), and 0 if X=0 (no grain, no exposure). But the problem says that the film is a collection of these channels. So each cell is a channel use.

Wait, but the question is about the capacity of the entire film of area 0.1 unit area. So the film is divided into N cells, each of area dA, and N*dA = 0.1, since the total area is 0.1. But the problem says the film is divided into a large number of cells, so N is very large, and dA is very small.

Wait, but each cell is a binary asymmetric channel with crossover probability 1 - 100 dA. Hmm, perhaps the crossover probability is the probability that a cell without a grain appears as having one, or vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps the crossover is the probability that a grain isn't present but the exposure happened, or something else.

Wait, maybe I should model it more accurately. The problem says that the film is a large number of parallel binary asymmetric channels. Each channel has a crossover probability of 1 - 100 dA. So I think that the parameter 1 - 100 dA is the probability that a grain is not present but the exposure occurs, which would be a crossover from 0 to 1. But that doesn't make sense because the exposure only occurs if the grain is present. Alternatively, perhaps the crossover is from 1 to 0, meaning that even though a grain is present, it's not exposed. But the problem says that when a grain is illuminated, it's exposed, so perhaps the crossover is in the other direction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is modeling the situation where a grain is present (with probability p) and the exposure is reliable, but the problem is that the channel could have errors. Alternatively, perhaps the way the problem is set up is that the channel's input is the presence of a grain, and the output is whether the exposure happened, but there's a small probability that a grain isn't present but the exposure occurs, or vice versa. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the problem states that the film is modeled as binary asymmetric channels with crossover probability 1 - 100 dA. So maybe each channel represents a cell. For each cell, the input is whether a grain is present (X=1) or not (X=0). The output is Y=1 (exposed) or Y=0 (not exposed). The crossover probability would then be either the probability that Y=1 when X=0, or Y=0 when X=1. So which one is it?

The problem says the crossover probability is 1 - 100 dA. Let me think about the Poisson process. The probability that a cell has no grain is P(X=0) = e^(-λ) ≈ 1 - λ, since λ is small (as dA is small). So λ = 100 dA, which is small. So P(X=0) ≈ 1 - 100 dA. Wait, so if X=0 (no grain), Y must be 0 because no exposure. So in that case, the probability of a crossover (say, Y=1 given X=0) would be zero. That can't be right because the problem says there is a crossover probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the grain's presence as a random variable, and the exposure is the output. So the channel is such that when X=1 (grain present), Y=1 with probability 1, because the light will expose it. When X=0 (no grain), Y=1 with some small probability, perhaps due to noise or other factors. But the problem doesn't mention any such noise. Alternatively, perhaps the model is that the grain's presence is the input, and the output is whether it's exposed. So if a grain is present, it's always exposed (Y=1), so P(Y=1|X=1)=1. If a grain isn't present, Y=0, so P(Y=0|X=0)=1. But that would make the channel a noiseless channel, which can't be right because the capacity would be 1 per channel, which doesn't make sense with the options given.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is about the opposite. Maybe the crossover is the probability that when a grain is present, it isn't exposed. Or perhaps the problem is considering something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is modeling the situation where the grain is present but the light doesn't hit it. Wait, but the problem says the film is illuminated without knowledge of the position of the grains. So the light is incident on the entire film, including all the cells. So every cell is illuminated. So if a grain is present in a cell, it is exposed; otherwise, it's not. So in this case, the output Y is a deterministic function of X. So when X=1, Y=1; when X=0, Y=0. So the channel is noiseless. But that can't be, because then the capacity would be 1 bit per channel, which would make the total capacity N, where N is the number of cells. But wait, given that each cell is area dA, and the total area is 0.1, N is 0.1 / dA. So if each channel has capacity 1, then the total capacity would be N * 1 = 0.1/dA * 1, which would be very large, but none of the options match that. So I must have misunderstood the setup.

Wait, perhaps the model is that the illumination isn't perfect. Maybe there's a probability that a grain is not exposed even when it's present. Or perhaps the problem is considering that the exposure is the output, but the presence of the grain is the input, but there's a probability of error. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the light doesn't hit every part of the cell, so even if a grain is present, it might not be exposed. That would introduce a crossover probability.

Wait, the problem says that the crossover probability is 1 - 100 dA. Let me think: for a cell of area dA, the probability that a grain is present is approximately 100 dA (since the density is 100 per unit area, and for small dA, the Poisson probability P(k=1) ≈ 100 dA). So P(X=1) = 100 dA, and P(X=0) ≈ 1 - 100 dA.

If the crossover is the probability that Y=1 given X=0, then that's ε. So the channel would have ε = 0, because if X=0, Y=0. But the problem states that the crossover probability is 1 - 100 dA. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the crossover is in the reverse direction, where Y=0 given X=1, which would be δ. So δ = 1 - 100 dA. But that would imply that when a grain is present, it's not exposed with probability 1 - 100 dA. But wait, earlier reasoning suggests that when a grain is present, it's always exposed, so δ should be 0. But the problem says the crossover is 1 - 100 dA, which is approximately 1 for small dA, which can't be right. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition. Maybe the crossover refers to the probability that a cell is not empty but is read as empty, or vice versa. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the opposite: the probability that a cell without a grain is read as having one, which would be ε, and the probability that a cell with a grain is read as not having one, δ.

But in the given scenario, when X=1 (grain present), Y=1 (exposed). So δ=0. When X=0 (no grain), Y=0, so ε=0. But the problem says the crossover probability is 1 - 100 dA, which suggests that either ε or δ is 1 - 100 dA. But that would require that, say, when X=1, Y=0 with probability 1 - 100 dA, which would be a crossover. But that doesn't make sense because the grain is supposed to be exposed when present.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The film is being used as a communication channel. The transmitter encodes information by deciding for each cell whether to place a grain or not. The receiver observes whether each cell is exposed or not. However, due to the Poisson process, the actual grain placement is probabilistic. But wait, the problem states that the film is illuminated without knowledge of the grain positions, so the transmitter doesn't choose where the grains are; they are random. So the channel might be modeling the fact that the receiver sees the grains based on their presence, but perhaps there's some noise in the process. But the problem says that the grains are either exposed or not, so maybe there's no noise, making the channel deterministic. That doesn't fit with the idea of a crossover probability, though.

Wait, perhaps the crossover probability is the probability that a grain is present but not exposed, or the other way around. But the problem says that when a grain is present, it's exposed, implying that the crossover from 1 to 0 is zero. But the problem states that the crossover is 1 - 100 dA. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the film's exposure is the output, but the grain's presence is the input. So the channel is from the grain's presence (input) to the exposure (output). If a grain is present (X=1), then Y=1. If not (X=0), Y=0. So the channel is noiseless. But again, that would make the capacity per channel 1, which seems off.

Wait, maybe the problem is modeling the fact that when the light is shone, each grain has a certain probability of being exposed. So even if a grain is present, it might not be exposed. So the crossover would be the probability that Y=0 given X=1, which is δ. Then, the problem states that 1 - 100 dA is the crossover probability. So δ = 1 - 100 dA. But that would mean that when a grain is present, it's not exposed with probability 1 - 100 dA, which for small dA would approach 1. That doesn't make much sense because as the cell area decreases, the probability of a grain being present (100 dA) also decreases, so the exposure probability (1 - δ) would be 100 dA. Wait, if δ = 1 - 100 dA, then 1 - δ = 100 dA. So when X=1, Y=1 happens with probability 100 dA, which aligns with the Poisson probability of a grain being present. That seems more plausible.

Wait, let's model this. For each cell:

- X=1 (grain present) occurs with probability p = 100 dA.

- When X=1, Y=1 occurs with probability (1 - δ) = 100 dA?

Wait, maybe not. Let me re-express this.

The problem says that each cell is a binary asymmetric channel with crossover probability 1 - 100 dA. I think the standard binary asymmetric channel has two crossover probabilities: ε = P(Y=1|X=0) and δ = P(Y=0|X=1). But the problem gives a single value, 1 - 100 dA, as the crossover probability. So perhaps only one of ε or δ is non-zero. Maybe in this case, δ is the crossover probability, so δ = 1 - 100 dA. But that would mean that when X=1, Y=0 with probability δ = 1 - 100 dA. But for small dA, 100 dA is very small, so δ ≈ 1. That would imply that when a grain is present, it's usually not exposed, which contradicts the problem statement that grains are exposed when illuminated. So perhaps I'm getting something wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe the crossover is ε, the probability that Y=1 when X=0. So ε = 1 - 100 dA. But that would mean that when X=0, Y=1 with probability ε = 1 - 100 dA. But when X=0, there's no grain, so Y should be 0. So this would imply that even when X=0, Y=1 happens with probability ~1, which is not possible. So I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the problem is considering that the probability that a cell is occupied by a grain is 100 dA, and when it's occupied, it's correctly received as 1. When it's not occupied, it's received as 0. So the channel is noiseless, and each cell's output is a Bernoulli trial with p=100 dA. Then, the capacity would be the mutual information between input and output. But if the channel is noiseless, then the capacity is H(p), where H is the binary entropy function.

Wait, but in a noiseless channel, the capacity is 1 bit per channel use if it's a binary symmetric channel with no errors. But in our case, the output is a deterministic function of the input. For a noiseless channel, the capacity is indeed 1 bit per channel use because each output perfectly determines the input. But that doesn't make sense here because the input isn't being chosen by the transmitter; the grains are randomly placed. So perhaps the problem is considering the grains as the information source, and the exposure as the output. But then the capacity would relate to how much information can be transmitted about the grain positions, which is a source coding problem, not a channel coding problem.

Wait, the problem says the film is a collection of binary asymmetric channels. So each channel is a cell, and the cells are independent. The capacity of each channel would be the mutual information between the input (X) and the output (Y), maximized over the input distribution.

So for each cell, the capacity C is:

C = H(Y) - H(Y|X)

But Y depends on X through the channel.

Alternatively, the capacity of a binary asymmetric channel is given by:

C = H(ε, δ) = H(b) - H(ε, δ)

Wait, no, the standard formula for the capacity of a binary asymmetric channel with crossover probabilities ε and δ is:

C = H( (ε + δ)/2 ) - H(ε, δ )

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that
