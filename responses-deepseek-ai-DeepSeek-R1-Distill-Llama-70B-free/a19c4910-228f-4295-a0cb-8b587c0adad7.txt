Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to convert the weight of a silver dollar from ounces to grams, kilograms, and milligrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my unit conversions, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says a silver dollar weighs about 0.943 ounces. Wait, ounces... I remember that there are two kinds of ounces—fluid ounces and avoirdupois ounces. I think in this context, since we're talking about weight, it's avoirdupois ounces. Right, because fluid ounces are for volume, like liquids.

Now, I need to convert ounces to grams. I remember that 1 ounce is equal to approximately 28.35 grams. Oh wait, let me make sure. I think the exact conversion is 1 oz = 28.3495 grams. So for 0.943 ounces, I should multiply that by 28.3495 grams per ounce.

Let me do the math. So 0.943 * 28.3495. Hmm, let's see. 0.943 is almost 1, so maybe around 26.8 grams? Wait, let me calculate more accurately. Let's break it down.

First, 0.943 * 28 = 26.404. Then 0.943 * 0.3495. Let's calculate 0.943 * 0.3 = 0.2829, and 0.943 * 0.0495 is approximately 0.0467. So adding those, 0.2829 + 0.0467 = 0.3296. Now add that to the 26.404: 26.404 + 0.3296 = 26.7336 grams. So approximately 26.73 grams.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. Maybe I should do it more precisely. Alternatively, I can use a calculator method. 0.943 * 28.3495.

Let me compute 0.943 * 28 = 26.404. Then 0.943 * 0.3495. Let's compute 0.943 * 0.3 = 0.2829 and 0.943 * 0.0495.

Wait, 0.0495 is approximately 0.05, so 0.943 * 0.05 is 0.04715. So adding 0.2829 and 0.04715 gives 0.32995. So total grams is 26.404 + 0.32995 = 26.73395 grams, which I can round to 26.73 grams.

So the grams part is about 26.73 grams. Now, looking at the options, let's see which option starts with around 26.73 g. Looking at the options:

Option C is 26.73 g, then 0.02673 kg, 26,730 mg. Option J is 25.73 g. So option C is a possible candidate.

Wait, wait, let's make sure. Next, kilograms. Since 1 kilogram is 1000 grams, so grams to kilograms, I divide by 1000. So 26.73 grams is 0.02673 kg. That matches option C's second value, 0.02673 kg.

Then, milligrams. 1 gram is 1000 milligrams, so 26.73 grams is 26.73 * 1000 = 26,730 mg. So option C's third value is 26,730 mg. That all lines up.

So the correct option should be C. Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Option A is 32 something, that's higher than 26. Option B is 31, too high. D is 24, lower. So no, C seems right.

To convert the weight of a silver dollar from ounces to grams, kilograms, and milligrams:

1. **Ounces to Grams**:  
   Since 1 ounce ≈ 28.3495 grams, multiplying 0.943 ounces by 28.3495 gives:  
   \[
   0.943 \times 28.3495 \approx 26.73 \, \text{g}.
   \]

2. **Grams to Kilograms**:  
   To convert grams to kilograms, divide by 1,000:  
   \[
   26.73 \, \text{g} \div 1,000 = 0.02673 \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. **Grams to Milligrams**:  
   To convert grams to milligrams, multiply by 1,000:  
   \[
   26.73 \, \text{g} \times 1,000 = 26,730 \, \text{mg}.
   \]

Thus, the weight of the silver dollar is approximately **26.73 g, 0.02673 kg, and 26,730 mg**. Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C: 26.73 g, 0.02673 kg, 26,730 mg.**
