H: Huntington's disease.
I: Down syndrome.

Okay, so I have this question about enzyme assays and genetic disorders. Hmm, I remember that enzyme assays are used to detect certain diseases, especially those related to enzyme deficiencies. The question is asking which of these conditions can be identified in carriers using an enzyme assay.

Let me think about each option:

A: Turner syndrome. I think that's a chromosomal abnormality, where females have only one X chromosome. I don't recall it being related to enzyme levels. Probably not the right answer.

B: Fragile X syndrome. That's an X-linked condition caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. I don't think it's diagnosed through enzyme assays. It's usually through DNA tests, like checking for CGG repeats.

C: Cystic fibrosis. This is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. I remember that sweat chloride tests are used for diagnosis, which isn't exactly an enzyme assay. So maybe not this one.

D: Autism. I don't think autism is detected through enzyme assays. It's more of a behavioral/neurological diagnosis.

E: Muscular dystrophy. I know some forms are due to dystrophin deficiency, like Duchenne. But again, I'm not sure if enzyme assays are used to identify carriers. Maybe they look for muscle enzyme levels like CPK, but I'm not certain if that's for carriers specifically.

F: Sickle cell anemia. This is a hemoglobinopathy. I think it's diagnosed with blood tests looking at hemoglobin, not enzyme levels.

G: Tay-Sachs disease. Oh right, Tay-Sachs is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. Carriers have lower levels of this enzyme. So enzyme assays can detect carriers because their enzyme activity is about 50% of normal. That sounds right.

H: Huntington's disease. That's an autosomal dominant disorder, diagnosed through genetic testing for the huntingtin gene expansion. Enzyme assays don't come into play here.

I: Down syndrome. Caused by an extra chromosome 21. Diagnosed via karyotype or other chromosomal tests, not enzyme assays.

So the correct answer should be G: Tay-Sachs disease.

Enzyme assays are used to identify carriers of Tay-Sachs disease because the condition is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. Carriers typically have reduced enzyme activity, which can be detected through such assays. Other options like Turner syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, cystic fibrosis, autism, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, and Down syndrome are not identified using enzyme assays but rather through other methods such as chromosomal analysis, DNA testing, or other biochemical tests.

Answer: G
