Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an ideal battery and power dissipation in a circuit. Hmm, let me think. The question says the battery has a constant voltage V, and it's supplying current to a circuit with total resistance R. Then, if R is doubled, what happens to the total power dissipated?

Wait, I remember that power in a circuit can be calculated in a couple of ways. Oh right, one of the formulas is P equals V squared over R, because P = V * I, and Ohm's law says I = V/R, so substituting gives P = V²/R. Right, that makes sense.

So initially, the power is P1 = V² / R. Then, the resistance R is doubled, so the new resistance is 2R. Plugging that into the formula, the new power P2 would be V squared divided by (2R), which is P2 = V²/(2R). 

Comparing P2 to P1: P2 is half of P1 because when you double R, the denominator becomes twice as big, making the whole fraction half as much as before. So the power dissipated would decrease by half. 

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, I could think in terms of current. The initial current I1 is V/R. When R is doubled, I2 is V/(2R), so I2 is I1/2. Power is also I squared times R, right? So initial power is I1² R. After R doubles, the new power is I2² * (2R). Let me compute that: I2 is I1/2, so (I1/2)^2 is I1²/4, multiplied by 2R gives (I1²/4) * 2R = (I1² R)/2. Which is again half of the initial power (since initial P was I1² R). So both methods give the same result.

So the total power dissipated is halved when the resistance is doubled. Looking back at the options, option D says it will be halved. Option H says it reduces to one-fourth, which doesn't fit. So the correct answer should be D.

The power dissipated in a circuit with a constant voltage source can be calculated using the formula \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \). Initially, the power is \( P_1 = \frac{V^2}{R} \). When the resistance \( R \) is doubled, the new power becomes \( P_2 = \frac{V^2}{2R} \), which is half of the initial power \( P_1 \). This result can also be verified by considering the relationship between power, current, and resistance: \( P = I^2 R \). Doubling \( R \) reduces the current \( I \) by a factor of 2, and since power depends on the square of the current, the power is reduced by a factor of 4 when \( R \) is doubled, but the doubling of \( R \) in the formula \( P = I^2 R \) results in an overall reduction by a factor of 2. Thus, the total power dissipated is halved when \( R \) is doubled.

The correct answer is **D: It will be halved.**
