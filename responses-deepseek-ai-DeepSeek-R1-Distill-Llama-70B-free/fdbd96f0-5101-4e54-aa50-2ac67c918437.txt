Okay, so I have this question about menarche and when it occurs. Hmm, I remember that menarche is the first menstrual cycle, or the first period, that a female experiences. It's a sign of puberty. But wait, the question is about the age it happens, right?

I think the average age for menarche is around 12 years old. But I'm not entirely sure. I've heard that it can vary, maybe from like 10 to 15 years old or something. But the question is asking specifically when it occurs, so I guess the average is what's being tested here.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option F says 12 in females only. That makes sense because menarche is for females; males don't have menstrual cycles. So I can cross out any options that mention males. Like option A talks about males only, which is wrong. Option C says 12 in females and 14 in malesâ€”wait, no, menarche isn't about males. So C is probably incorrect because it includes males.

Option B says 10 in both sexes, but again, males don't have menarche. So B is out. Option D says 12 in both, which is wrong for the same reason. E is 14 for both, also incorrect. G is 10 in females only, which is a possibility, but I think the average is a bit higher. Option H has 12 in males and 14 in females, which is incorrect because males don't have menarche. I is 14 in females only, which is a bit older than the average I remember. J is 12 in males and 10 in females, which again, males don't have it, and 10 might be on the younger side but possible.

Wait, so the options are about when menarche occurs. Menarche is specifically for females, so any option that mentions males is incorrect. So the correct answer should be one that talks only about females.

So the options left are F, G, I. So between 10, 12, 14.

I'm pretty sure the average is around 12, so F would be the right choice. Menarche occurs at about age 12 in females only.

Let me double-check. Menarche is the first menstrual period, so it's a female-only thing. The average age is typically around 12, though it can vary. So yes, F makes sense.

Menarche refers to the first menstrual period in females and is a key indicator of puberty. It typically occurs around the age of 12, though it can vary. Since menarche is specific to females, any option mentioning males is incorrect. Among the remaining choices, the average age of 12 in females aligns with the correct answer.

Answer: F
