Okay, so I have this physics problem here about quarter wave plates and crystalline quartz. Hmm, I remember wave plates are used to alter the polarization of light, right? A quarter wave plate is used to create circularly polarized light from linearly polarized light, or vice versa.

The question is asking for the minimum thickness of a crystalline quartz quarter wave plate. The indices of refraction given are n_E = 1.553 and n_O = 1.544 for light with a wavelength of 589 nm. Wait, 589 nanometers? Oh yeah, that's the sodium D-line, I think.

So, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that a quarter wave plate works by introducing a phase difference of 90 degrees (which is a quarter wavelength) between the ordinary and extraordinary rays. The phase difference is related to the thickness of the crystal and the difference in the indices of refraction.

The formula I think is d = (λ/4) / (n_e - n_o), but wait, wait. Because I'm not sure if it's (n_e - n_o) or divided by something else. Oh wait, no, the general formula for the thickness of a quarter wave plate is d = λ/(4*(n_e - n_o)) ), but wait, is that correct? Or is it divided by (n_e - n_o) multiplied by something?

Wait, no, let me think again. The phase difference is (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d. And for a quarter wave plate, we want a phase difference of π/2, which is quarter of 2π. So setting that up: π/2 = (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d.

So solving for d: d = (π/2) * (λ/(2π*(n_e - n_o)) )) → wait, let me do the math carefully.

Let's write the equation step by step.

The phase difference Δφ is given by:

Δφ = (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d

We want Δφ = π/2 (since a quarter wave is λ/4, which is 2π*(λ/4)/λ = π/2 radians).

So,

π/2 = (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d

Now, solve for d:

d = (π/2) * (λ) / (2π*(n_e - n_o)) )

Simplify:

The 2π in numerator and denominator cancels, and π cancels with numerator π/2.

So,

d = (λ) / (4*(n_e - n_o)) )

Wait, that seems right. Because 2π cancels with π/2, leaving 1/4.

So, d = λ/(4*(n_e - n_o)).

But wait, let me double-check. Another way: The optical path difference (OPD) should be λ/4. OPD = (n_e - n_o) * d. So,

OPD = (n_e - n_o) * d = λ/4

So solving for d: d = λ/(4*(n_e - n_o))

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, the wavelength given is 589 nm. But wait, is this the wavelength in vacuum or in the medium? Because the indices of refraction are given for quartz, so the wavelength inside the medium would be λ_medium = λ_vacuum / n. But wait, in this formula, does the wavelength used have to be in vacuum or in the medium?

Hmmm, wait. Let me think. The phase difference depends on the physical path in the medium times the difference in refractive indices. So, the formula uses the wavelength in vacuum? Or the wavelength in the medium?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The phase difference is 2π times the number of wavelengths in the medium, which is (physical thickness) / (wavelength in medium). The wavelength in the medium is λ/n, where n is the refractive index. But since the two rays (ordinary and extraordinary) have different refractive indices, the calculation is a bit more involved.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The condition for a quarter wave plate is that the difference in optical path length is λ/4. The optical path length is n multiplied by the physical thickness. So for the extraordinary and ordinary rays, the OPLs are n_e * d and n_o * d, respectively. The difference is (n_e - n_o)*d. This should equal λ/4.

So, (n_e - n_o) * d = λ/4.

Wait, but no, because that would suggest that the OPL difference is λ/4. But wait, the standard formula is d = λ/(4*(n_e - n_o)) ). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: the wavelength inside the medium is λ/n, so perhaps the formula should use the wavelength in the medium?

Wait, perhaps not, because the formula depends on the difference in the optical paths, which is (n_e - n_o) * d. So regardless of the medium, the OPL is (n_e - n_o) * d, and that's set to λ/4. So the actual wavelength in the medium might matter, but perhaps in this setup, the formula uses the vacuum wavelength.

Alternatively, maybe the formula assumes that d is the thickness in the medium, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's proceed with the formula as I have it: d = λ/(4*(n_e - n_o)).

Given that λ is 589 nm, which is 589e-9 meters, or 589e-6 mm. Wait, no: 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 589 nm is 589e-9 m, which is 0.589 micrometers or 589e-6 mm.

Wait, let me convert 589 nm to mm: 589 nm = 589 x 1e-9 m = 589 x 1e-6 mm. So 589e-6 mm is 0.000589 mm.

Wait, but let me compute the denominator: n_e - n_o = 1.553 - 1.544 = 0.009.

So, d = λ/(4*(n_e - n_o)) ) = (589e-9 m) / (4 * 0.009 )

Wait, but units: 589e-9 m is 589 nm, which is 589e-9 m. Let's compute the denominator: 4 * 0.009 = 0.036.

So, d = 589e-9 m / 0.036.

Compute that: 589e-9 / 0.036 = let me calculate that.

589e-9 is 5.89e-7, so 5.89e-7 / 0.036.

Wait, 5.89e-7 divided by 3.6e-2 is approximately (5.89 / 3.6) * 1e-5.

Wait, 5.89 / 3.6 is about 1.636.

So 1.636e-5 meters. Convert meters to mm: 1.636e-5 m = 1.636e-2 mm, which is 0.01636 mm.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.016 mm. So that's close.

Wait, but wait a second, what about the wavelength? Oh wait, I used 589e-9 meters, which is correct because the formula uses the wavelength in vacuum, I think. Because the formula (n_e - n_o)*d = λ/4 is based on the vacuum wavelength. Or is it the wavelength in the medium?

Wait, that's the key point. Let me think again. If the phase difference depends on the path difference in terms of wavelength, but the wavelength inside the medium is λ/n.

So perhaps the correct approach is Δ = (n_e - n_o) * d = λ_medium /4.

Wait, but λ_medium is λ_vacuum / n. Hmm, but which n to use? Because ordinary and extraordinary have different n. So perhaps the average? Or perhaps it's better to model it differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be d = λ/(4(n_e - n_o)).

Wait, another approach: the phase for each wave is (2πn * d ) / λ_vacuum.

So the phase difference is (2π (n_e - n_o) d ) / λ.

We want this to be π/2, so:

(2π (n_e - n_o) d ) / λ = π/2

Divide both sides by π: 2 (n_e -n_o) d / λ = 1/2

Multiply both sides by λ: 2(n_e -n_o) d = λ/2

Divide by 2: (n_e -n_o) d = λ/4

So d = λ/(4 (n_e -n_o) )

Yes, so that's the correct formula. So the wavelength used is indeed the vacuum wavelength.

So going back, with λ = 589e-9 m, n_e -n_o = 0.009.

So d = (589e-9) / (4 * 0.009) = (589e-9) / 0.036.

Compute 589e-9 divided by 0.036.

589e-9 = 5.89e-7.

5.89e-7 / 0.036 = (5.89 / 0.036) * 1e-7 = 163.611e-7 → Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute 589 / 36 = approx 16.361.

Wait, 36 * 16 = 576, so 589-576=13 → 16 + 13/36 ≈ 16.361.

So 589 /36 ≈16.361. So 589e-9 /0.036 is 16.361e-9 /1e-3? Wait, no.

Wait, 589e-9 m is 5.89e-7 m, and 0.036 is 3.6e-2.

So 5.89e-7 /3.6e-2 = (5.89/3.6) * (1e-7 / 1e-2) ) → 5.89/3.6 is about 1.636, and 1e-5.

So 1.636e-5 meters is 1.636e-2 mm, which is 0.01636 mm.

So that's approximately 0.016 mm. Looking at the options, option B is 0.016 mm.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the minimum thickness of a crystalline quartz quarter wave plate, we use the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\lambda}{4 \cdot (n_e - n_o)}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda = 589 \, \text{nm} = 589 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),
- \( n_e = 1.553 \),
- \( n_o = 1.544 \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( n_e - n_o \)
\[
n_e - n_o = 1.553 - 1.544 = 0.009
\]

### Step 2: Substitute into the formula
\[
d = \frac{589 \times 10^{-9}}{4 \cdot 0.009}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:
\[
4 \cdot 0.009 = 0.036
\]

Now, divide:
\[
d = \frac{589 \times 10^{-9}}{0.036} = \frac{5.89 \times 10^{-7}}{0.036}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
d \approx 1.636 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} = 0.01636 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated thickness \( d \approx 0.01636 \, \text{mm} \) is closest to option **B: 0.016 mm**.

### Final Answer:
**B**
