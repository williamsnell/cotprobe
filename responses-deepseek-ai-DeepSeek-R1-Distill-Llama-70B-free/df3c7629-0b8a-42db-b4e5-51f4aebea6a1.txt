Okay, so I have this problem here: What is the value of log 0.0148? And there are several options to choose from. Hmm, I remember that log usually refers to the base 10 logarithm, right? So log base 10 of 0.0148.

Wait, let me think about how to approach this. I know that logarithms of numbers less than 1 are negative because 10 raised to a negative power gives a fraction. So the log of 0.0148 should definitely be a negative number. Looking at the options, some are negative and some are positive. So I can eliminate the positive ones first. Let's see the options: A is 3, B is -0.1703, C is -2.1703, D is -0.8297, E is -1.1703, F is -1.8297, G is 0.0148, H is 1.8297, I is 0.1703, J is 2. So the possible answers are B, C, D, E, F.

Now, how do I calculate log(0.0148)? Maybe I can express 0.0148 as a fraction that's easier to work with. Wait, 0.0148 is the same as 1.48 x 10^-2. Because moving the decimal point two places to the right gives 1.48, so it's 1.48 times 10 to the -2 power.

So log(0.0148) = log(1.48 x 10^-2). Using logarithm properties, log(ab) = log a + log b. So that's log(1.48) + log(10^-2). Log(10^-2) is -2 because 10^-2 is 0.01, and log(0.01) is -2. So the total is log(1.48) minus 2.

Now I need to find log(1.48). I remember that log(1) is 0, and log(1.48) is somewhere between 0 and 0.2, I think. Let me recall some log values. Log(1.4) is approximately 0.1461, and log(1.5) is about 0.1761. So 1.48 is a bit less than 1.5. So log(1.48) should be a little less than 0.1761, maybe around 0.17 or so.

Wait, if log(1.48) is approximately 0.17, then the total log(0.0148) would be 0.17 - 2 = -1.83. Let me check the options. Option F is -1.8297, which is very close to -1.83. Hmm, that seems to fit.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let me think. Let's use the logarithm table method or some approximation. Alternatively, I can use natural logarithm and convert, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can use the Taylor series expansion, but perhaps that's overkill.

Alternatively, I can remember that log(1.48) is approximately 0.1703? Wait, because I think sometimes log tables have more precise values. Let me think. Log(1.4) is 0.1461, log(1.41)=0.1491, log(1.42)=0.1520, and so on. Wait, maybe I should use linear approximation between 1.4 and 1.5.

Wait, 1.48 is 0.08 above 1.4. The difference between log(1.4) and log(1.5) is 0.1761 - 0.1461 = 0.03 over 0.1 increase in x. So per 0.01 increase in x, the log increases by 0.003. So 0.08 would be 0.24 increase. So 0.1461 + 0.24*(0.03) = wait, no, wait: 0.08/0.1 = 0.8 of the interval. So 0.1461 + 0.8*(0.03) = 0.1461 + 0.024 = 0.1701. So that's approximately 0.1701.

So log(1.48) â‰ˆ 0.1701. Then adding that to -2 gives -1.8299. Looking at the options, option F is -1.8297, which is very close. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to think about this is using a calculator. Oh wait, I don't have a calculator, but perhaps I can remember that 10^(-1.83) is about 0.0148. Let me check: 10^(-1) is 0.1, 10^(-2) is 0.01. So 10^(-1.83) is between 0.01 and 0.015, maybe? Let me compute 10^(-1.83) as 10^(-2 + 0.17) = 10^(-2) * 10^(0.17). 10^0.17 is approximately 1.48 (since 10^0.1761 is about 1.5). So 0.01 * 1.48 is 0.0148. Exactly what we started with. So yes, that confirms that log(0.0148) is -1.83, which matches option F: -1.8297.

To determine the value of \( \log(0.0148) \), we start by expressing \( 0.0148 \) in scientific notation:  
\[
0.0148 = 1.48 \times 10^{-2}.
\]  
Using the logarithm property \( \log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b) \), we can rewrite \( \log(0.0148) \) as:  
\[
\log(1.48) + \log(10^{-2}).
\]  
Since \( \log(10^{-2}) = -2 \), the expression simplifies to:  
\[
\log(1.48) - 2.
\]  

Next, we approximate \( \log(1.48) \). From known logarithm values:  
- \( \log(1.4) \approx 0.1461 \),  
- \( \log(1.5) \approx 0.1761 \).  

Using linear interpolation between these values, \( 1.48 \) is 0.08 above 1.4. The difference in logarithms between 1.4 and 1.5 is \( 0.1761 - 0.1461 = 0.03 \), which corresponds to an increase of 0.1 in \( x \). Thus, for an increase of 0.08 in \( x \), the logarithm increases by:  
\[
0.03 \times \frac{0.08}{0.1} = 0.024.
\]  
Adding this to \( \log(1.4) \), we find:  
\[
\log(1.48) \approx 0.1461 + 0.024 = 0.1701.
\]  

Substituting this back into the earlier expression:  
\[
\log(0.0148) = \log(1.48) - 2 \approx 0.1701 - 2 = -1.8299.
\]  

Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is \( -1.8297 \), which corresponds to option **F**.
