Okay, so I've got this question about blackbody radiation and how the energy radiated changes when the temperature increases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Let me think.

Alright, the question says the absolute temperature is increased by a factor of 3. So if the original temperature is T, the new one is 3T. And the question is about the energy radiated per second per unit area—right, that's the power per unit area.

I recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the power radiated per unit area (let's call it P) is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. So the formula is P = σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, right, so if T increases, P increases by the fourth power of the factor by which T was multiplied.

So if the temperature becomes 3 times higher, the new power P' would be σ*(3T)⁴. Let's compute that. (3T)^4 is 3^4 * T^4. 3^4 is 81, so P' = 81 * σT⁴. So P' is 81 times the original P.

Looking back at the options, E is "Increases by a factor of 81." So that should be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any exponents. Oh wait, another thought—does the question ask for per unit area? Yes, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is per unit area, so that part is correct. 

So the answer should be E.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the energy radiated per second per unit area by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature, expressed as \( P = \sigma T^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. If the temperature increases by a factor of 3, the new temperature is \( 3T \), and the new power radiated becomes:

\[
P' = \sigma (3T)^4 = \sigma 3^4 T^4 = 81 \sigma T^4
\]

This shows that the energy radiated increases by a factor of 81. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: Increases by a factor of 81.
