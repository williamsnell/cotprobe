Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem is about heat transfer between alcohol, water, and a glass container. Hmm, I remember that when two substances are mixed, heat is transferred from the hotter to the cooler until they reach thermal equilibrium. Oh wait, and the glass container might also absorb or release heat because it's part of the system.

The given data: 500 grams of alcohol at 75°C is poured into 500 grams of water at 30°C in a 300g glass container. The final temperature is 46°C. We need to find the specific heat of alcohol. The specific heat of water is probably 1 cal/g°C, right? And the glass's specific heat is given as 0.14 cal/g°C.

Wait, wait. So the initial temps are 75 (alcohol) and 30 (water). The final is 46. So, alcohol is hotter, so it will lose heat, and water and glass will gain heat. Right.

The formula I think is that heat lost = heat gained. So, the heat lost by alcohol equals the heat gained by water plus the heat gained by the glass.

But wait, I have to be careful with signs. Since the alcohol is losing heat, its change will be negative, and the others positive. But when setting up the equation, it's easier to write as the sum of the heat gained equals the heat lost.

So the equation would be:

m_alcohol * c_alcohol * (T_final - T_initial_alcohol) = - [m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water) + m_glass * c_glass * (T_final - T_initial_glass)]

Wait, no. Because the alcohol is losing heat, the left side will be negative. Alternatively, the equation could be:

Heat lost by alcohol = Heat gained by water + Heat gained by glass.

So:

m_alc * c_alc * (T_initial_alc - T_final) = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water) + m_glass * c_glass * (T_final - T_initial_glass)

Yes, that's correct. Because T_initial_alc is higher than T_final, so the left side is positive. The right side is the sum of the heat gains, which are positive.

Let me plug in the numbers.

m_alc = 500g, T_initial_alc =75°C, T_final=46°C. So the change for alcohol is 75-46=29°C.

c_alc is what we're solving for.

On the right side:

m_water=500g, c_water=1 cal/g°C, T_initial_water=30°C. T_final=46, so change is 16°C.

m_glass=300g, c_glass=0.14 cal/g°C. Change is also 16°C.

So putting it all together:

500 * c_alc * 29 = 500 * 1 *16 + 300 * 0.14 *16.

Let me compute the right-hand side first.

500 *1 *16 = 8000 cal.

300 *0.14=42. 42 *16=672. So total is 8000+672=8672.

So left side is 500 * c_alc *29 = 500 *29 * c_alc = 14500 * c_alc.

Set equal:

14500 * c_alc = 8672.

So c_alc = 8672 / 14500.

Let me calculate that.

8672 divided by 14500.

Hmm, let's see. 14500 is about 14.5 thousand. 8672/14.5e3.

Well, 14.5e3 is 14500.

So 8672 ÷ 14500 ≈ 0.598.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 8672/8=1084, 14500/8=1812.5.

So 1084 / 1812.5 = ?

Hmm, 1812.5 * 0.6 = 1087.5. Oh wait, that's close to 1084.

So 0.6 * 1812.5 =1087.5. But we have 1084. So 0.6 is a bit higher than the actual value. Let's see the difference: 1087.5 -1084=3.5.

So, 3.5 /1812.5 ≈ 0.00193. So the value is 0.6 -0.00193≈ 0.59807.

So approximately 0.598 cal/(g°C). Looking at the options:

Option E is 0.598, Option B is 0.590, Option H is 0.560, etc.

So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 8672/14500. Let me compute it step by step.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal:

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute 8672 ÷14500.

Let me write it as 8672 divided by 14500.

Let me compute 8672 ÷14500.

So 14500 goes into 86720 how many times?

14500 *5=72500, which is less than 86720. 14500 *6=87000, which is more than 86720. So 5 times, with a remainder.

5 *14500=72500. Subtract from 86720: 86720-72500=14220.

Bring down a zero: 142200.

How many times does 14500 go into 142200? Let's compute 14500*9=130500, 14500*10=145000. 142200 is between 9 and 10 times.

Wait, 9 times is 130500. Subtract from 142200: 11700.

Bring down another zero: 117000.

14500 goes into 117000 8 times, because 14500*8=116000. So subtract: 117000-116000=1000.

Bring down a zero: 10000.

14500 goes into 10000 zero times. Bring down another zero: 100000.

14500 *6=87000, 14500*7=101500. So 6 times. 6*14500=87000. Subtract: 100000-87000=13000.

Bring down zero:130000.

14500 *8=116000. 116000 <130000. 14500*9=130500, which is more. So 8 times. 8*14500=116000. Subtract: 130000-116000=14000.

Bring down zero:140000.

14500 *9=130500. 140000-130500=9500.

Hmm, maybe I should stop here. So the division is approximately 0.598... So about 0.598.

Looking back at the options, E is 0.598. So the correct answer is E.

To determine the specific heat of alcohol, we analyze the heat transfer between the alcohol, water, and glass container. The heat lost by the alcohol equals the heat gained by the water and the glass. Using the formula:

\[
m_{\text{alcohol}} \cdot c_{\text{alcohol}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial, alcohol}}) = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial, water}}) + m_{\text{glass}} \cdot c_{\text{glass}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial, glass}})
\]

### Given Data:
- **Alcohol**: \( m_{\text{alcohol}} = 500 \, \text{g}, T_{\text{initial, alcohol}} = 75^\circ \text{C}, T_{\text{final}} = 46^\circ \text{C} \)
- **Water**: \( m_{\text{water}} = 500 \, \text{g}, c_{\text{water}} = 1 \, \text{cal/g}^\circ \text{C}, T_{\text{initial, water}} = 30^\circ \text{C}, T_{\text{final}} = 46^\circ \text{C} \)
- **Glass**: \( m_{\text{glass}} = 300 \, \text{g}, c_{\text{glass}} = 0.14 \, \text{cal/g}^\circ \text{C}, T_{\text{final}} = 46^\circ \text{C} \)

### Heat Transfer Calculations:
1. **Heat lost by alcohol**:
   \[
   Q_{\text{alcohol}} = m_{\text{alcohol}} \cdot c_{\text{alcohol}} \cdot (T_{\text{initial, alcohol}} - T_{\text{final}})
   \]
   \[
   Q_{\text{alcohol}} = 500 \cdot c_{\text{alcohol}} \cdot (75 - 46) = 500 \cdot c_{\text{alcohol}} \cdot 29
   \]

2. **Heat gained by water**:
   \[
   Q_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial, water}})
   \]
   \[
   Q_{\text{water}} = 500 \cdot 1 \cdot (46 - 30) = 500 \cdot 16 = 8000 \, \text{cal}
   \]

3. **Heat gained by glass**:
   \[
   Q_{\text{glass}} = m_{\text{glass}} \cdot c_{\text{glass}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial, glass}})
   \]
   \[
   Q_{\text{glass}} = 300 \cdot 0.14 \cdot (46 - 30) = 300 \cdot 0.14 \cdot 16 = 672 \, \text{cal}
   \]

4. **Total heat gained**:
   \[
   Q_{\text{total, gained}} = Q_{\text{water}} + Q_{\text{glass}} = 8000 + 672 = 8672 \, \text{cal}
   \]

5. **Equating heat lost and heat gained**:
   \[
   Q_{\text{alcohol}} = Q_{\text{total, gained}}
   \]
   \[
   500 \cdot c_{\text{alcohol}} \cdot 29 = 8672
   \]

6. **Solve for \( c_{\text{alcohol}} \)**:
   \[
   c_{\text{alcohol}} = \frac{8672}{500 \cdot 29} = \frac{8672}{14500} \approx 0.598 \, \text{cal/g}^\circ \text{C}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The specific heat of alcohol is approximately **0.598 cal/g°C**, which corresponds to **Option E**.
