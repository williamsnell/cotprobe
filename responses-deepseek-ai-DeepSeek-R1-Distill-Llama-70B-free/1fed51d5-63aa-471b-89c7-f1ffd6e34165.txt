Question:

Margaret's Toyland can sell x bags of marbles at a price of p cents per bag where p = 20 - 0.03x. If the cost of x bags is C = 3 + 0.02x, then how many bags will the store have to sell to maximize the profit?

Options:

A: 250 bags
B: 500 bags
C: 425 bags
D: 450 bags
E: 275 bags
F: 333 bags
G: 300 bags
H: 350 bags
I: 200 bags
J: 400 bags

Okay, so I have this problem about Margaret's Toyland selling bags of marbles. The question is asking how many bags they need to sell to maximize profit. Hmm, I think I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. Right, so I'll need to find expressions for both revenue and cost, then find where profit is maximized. 

The problem gives me the price per bag as p = 20 - 0.03x, where x is the number of bags sold. So, the price depends on how many bags they sell. That makes sense because if they sell more, the price per bag drops a bit. 

Wait, the revenue would be price times quantity, so R = p * x. Since p is given, I can substitute that in. So R = (20 - 0.03x) * x. Let me write that out: R = 20x - 0.03x². Yeah, that's a quadratic equation, and it should open downward because of the negative coefficient on x squared. So the maximum revenue is at the vertex of this parabola.

But the question is about maximizing profit, not revenue. Profit is revenue minus cost. The cost function is given as C = 3 + 0.02x. So the cost increases with x, but not as a fixed rate. So the total cost is a linear function.

So the profit function P is R - C. Let me plug those in. P = (20x - 0.03x²) - (3 + 0.02x). Simplify that: 20x - 0.03x² -3 -0.02x. Combine like terms: (20x -0.02x) is 19.98x. So P = -0.03x² +19.98x -3.

Now, to find the maximum profit, I need to find the vertex of this quadratic function. Since the coefficient of x squared is negative (-0.03), the parabola opens downward, so the vertex is the maximum point.

The x-coordinate of the vertex in a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Let me apply that here. So a is -0.03 and b is 19.98. 

So x = -(19.98) / (2 * -0.03). Let's compute this. The negatives cancel out, so it's 19.98 divided by 0.06. Hmm, 19.98 / 0.06. Let me see, 0.06 times 333 is 19.98 because 0.06 * 300 is 18, and 0.06*33 is about 1.98. So 300+33=333. So x is approximately 333 bags.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. 19.98 divided by 0.06 equals... well, 0.06 is 6 hundredths, so 19.98 / 0.06. Hmm, 19.98 divided by 6 is 3.33, and since 0.06 is 6 * 0.01, so 3.33 / 0.01 is 333. So yeah, that's 333.

Looking at the options, option F is 333 bags. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations earlier. Let me recheck the profit function. Revenue R is (20 - 0.03x) * x = 20x - 0.03x². Cost C is 3 + 0.02x. So profit P = R - C = 20x -0.03x² -3 -0.02x = (20x -0.02x) is 19.98x, so P = -0.03x² +19.98x -3. That's correct.

Then, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = -19.98/(2*(-0.03)) = 19.98/(0.06) = 333. Yep, that's right. So the maximum profit is at 333 bags sold. So the answer is F.

To determine how many bags Margaret's Toyland needs to sell to maximize profit, we start by calculating the profit function. The price per bag is given as \( p = 20 - 0.03x \), and the revenue \( R \) is the product of price and quantity sold: 

\[
R = p \cdot x = (20 - 0.03x) \cdot x = 20x - 0.03x^2
\]

The cost function is \( C = 3 + 0.02x \). Profit \( P \) is then revenue minus cost:

\[
P = R - C = (20x - 0.03x^2) - (3 + 0.02x)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
P = -0.03x^2 + 19.98x - 3
\]

This is a quadratic function, and since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative (\(-0.03\)), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex represents the maximum profit. The x-coordinate of the vertex for a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by:

\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = -0.03 \) and \( b = 19.98 \). Substituting these values:

\[
x = -\frac{19.98}{2 \cdot -0.03} = \frac{19.98}{0.06} = 333
\]

Thus, the store must sell 333 bags to maximize profit. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 333 bags**
