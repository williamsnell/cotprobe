Okay, so I've got this economics question here about aggregate demand and its effects on GDP and the price level in both the short run and long run. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. Let's break it down.

The question says the economy is currently at full employment, and we're assuming flexible wages and prices. Wait, no, actually the question says "assuming flexible wages and prices." Oh wait, no, wait—the initial condition is full employment, but the question is about a decline in aggregate demand. So I think I should model this using the AS-AD framework.

So when aggregate demand (AD) decreases, what happens? In the short run, I remember that a decrease in AD shifts the AD curve to the left. If the economy was at full employment, which is the long-run equilibrium where AD meets the vertical long-run AS curve. So in the short run, when AD falls, the economy moves to a new equilibrium somewhere along the short-run AS curve.

In the short run, the AS curve is upward sloping, so a decrease in AD will cause the price level to fall, and real GDP to also fall because we're moving along the AS curve. So in the short run, both GDP and price level decrease.

Now, what about the long run? In the long run, prices and wages are flexible. So if AD decreases, the economy will adjust. In the long run, the AS curve is vertical at the full employment level (or potential GDP). So when AD falls in the long run, the economy adjusts such that GDP returns to its long-run potential. But how does the price level adjust?

In the short run, the price level fell. But in the long run, since the economy is back to full employment, the price level will adjust to a new lower level. Wait, no. Let me think again. When AD decreases, the short-run effect is lower GDP and lower prices. But in the long run, the economy can't stay below full employment because prices and wages adjust. So if AD is lower, the price level must decrease further to bring the economy back to full employment.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me picture the AS-AD graph. At full employment, AD=AS. If AD shifts left (down), in the short run, the intersection point moves left along the AS curve, so lower price level and lower GDP. But in the long run, the AS curve is vertical. So if AD is lower, the price level must drop enough so that the lower AD brings the economy back to full employment. So the price level in the long run is lower than before the AD shift. Wait, but the initial state was full employment, so the long run AS is at that point. If AD decreases, but we're in the long run, so the price level adjusts to bring the economy back to full employment, so the price level will be lower than before, but the GDP remains the same as full employment.

Wait, that can't be right because if AD decreases, and AS is vertical, then AD must intersect AS at the same point, so the price level would have to decrease to bring AD in line with the long-run AS. So in the long run, GDP doesn't change (stays at full employment), but the price level decreases.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on GDP and price level in both the short and long run. So the initial situation is full employment. Then AD decreases.

Short run: GDP falls, price level falls.

Long run: GDP returns to full employment (no change from original), but price level is lower than before.

Wait, but the question is about how a decline in AD affects these variables. So in the short run, both fall. In the long run, GDP goes back to original (so no change from original), but price level is lower. So comparing to the situation before the AD decline, in the short run, both variables fall. In the long run, GDP is back to original, and price is lower.

Wait, but in the very long run, when the economy adjusts, if AD is lower, the price level adjusts to a new lower level, but real GDP remains at the original full employment level. So in the long run, GDP is unchanged (no change), but the price level is lower (falls).

Wait, but in the initial state, the economy was at full employment, so if AD falls, in the short run, GDP and prices fall. But in the long run, because of flexible prices, the economy returns to full employment, so GDP doesn't change (stays at full employment level, same as before AD fell), but the price level is lower than before AD fell.

So the changes are:

Short Run GDP: Falls

Short Run Price Level: Falls

Long Run GDP: No change

Long Run Price Level: Falls

Looking at the options, let me check each.

Option C says: Falls, Falls, No change, Falls. That matches.

Wait, checking the options:

Option C: Falls, Falls, No change, Falls.

Yes, that's what I concluded.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps in the long run, the GDP remains at the original level, but the price level is lower than before the AD shock. So the long-run GDP doesn't change, so it goes back to original. So the change in GDP in the long run is no change.

But the question is about how the decline in AD affects GDP and price level in the short run and the long run.

So, the correct answer would have:

Short Run GDP: Falls

Short Run Price Level: Falls

Long Run GDP: No change

Long Run Price Level: Falls

Which is option C.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: Falls, No change, No change, Falls

B: No change, Falls, No change, No change

C: Falls, Falls, No change, Falls

D: No change, No change, Falls, Falls

E: Falls, Falls, Falls, Falls

F: Falls, Falls, No change, No change

G: Falls, Falls, Falls, No change

H: No change, Falls, Falls, No change

I: Falls, No change, Falls, Falls

J: No change, No change, No change, Falls

So the correct answer is option C, right?

When aggregate demand (AD) decreases, the economy's response can be analyzed using the AS-AD framework. Initially, the economy is at full employment, where AD intersects the vertical long-run aggregate supply (AS) curve. A decline in AD shifts the AD curve to the left.

**Short Run:**
- The economy moves along the upward-sloping short-run AS curve. As a result, both GDP and the price level fall.

**Long Run:**
- Wages and prices are flexible, allowing the economy to adjust. The long-run AS curve is vertical at the full employment level, meaning GDP returns to its original level (no change). However, the price level decreases to align with the lower AD.

Thus, the effects of a decline in AD are:
- **Short Run:** GDP falls, and the price level falls.
- **Long Run:** GDP remains unchanged, and the price level falls.

The correct answer is:

C: Falls, Falls, No change, Falls

**Answer: C**
