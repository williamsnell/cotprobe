Okay, so I've got this problem here about refrigerators and freezers, and I'm supposed to figure out by what factor it's more expensive to extract the same amount of heat from the freezer compared to the refrigerator. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but let's see if I can work through this.

Alright, the question gives me temperatures. The refrigerator is at 36°F, the freezer at 0°F, and the room is at 65°F. Wait, but wait—when dealing with thermodynamics formulas, especially ones involving temperatures, I think I need to convert these Fahrenheit temperatures to Kelvin or maybe Celsius because the formulas usually use absolute temperatures. Oh right, the Kelvin scale is based on the Celsius scale, so each degree Celsius is the same as a Kelvin, but shifted by 273.15.

So first, let's convert all these temperatures to Celsius. I remember that to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, the formula is (°F - 32) * 5/9 = °C.

Calculating each:

Refrigerator: 36°F. So (36-32)=4. 4*(5/9) = 20/9 ≈ 2.222°C. So about 2.22°C.

Freezer: 0°F. (0-32)= -32. -32*(5/9)= -160/9 ≈ -17.78°C.

Room temperature: 65°F. (65-32)=33. 33*(5/9)= 165/9≈18.333°C. So about 18.33°C.

Wait, but wait. The temperatures for the refrigerator and freezer are inside temperatures. So, the refrigerator's inside is colder than the room, which makes sense because it's extracting heat from the inside to the outside (the room). Same with the freezer.

Now, the problem is about the cost of extracting the same amount of heat. I'm assuming that "more expensive" refers to the amount of work required. Because in refrigerators, you need to do work (like electricity) to pump the heat from the cold inside to the warmer outside.

The question says to use the theoretical limit for the performance of a reversible refrigerator. That makes me think of the Carnot cycle, specifically the coefficient of performance (COP) for a refrigerator.

Right, the COP for a refrigerator is the heat removed (Q_cold) divided by the work input (W). So COP = Q_cold / W. And for a Carnot refrigerator, the maximum COP is given by COP = T_cold / (T_hot - T_cold), where T_cold and T_hot are the absolute temperatures of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively.

Wait, wait. So for each case—refrigerator and freezer—the COP would be calculated using their respective T_cold, and the same T_hot (room temperature).

But the question is about the factor by which it's more expensive to extract the same amount of heat. So, for the same Q (amount of heat extracted), the cost is higher when the COP is lower because you'd need more work (W) for the same Q. Because W = Q / COP. So if COP is lower, W is higher, meaning more expensive.

So I need to compute the COP for both the refrigerator and the freezer, then find the ratio of their work inputs (since Q is the same, the ratio of W would be the inverse of the ratio of COPs).

Wait, yes. Because if Q is the same, then W = Q / COP. So the work for the refrigerator is W_refrig = Q / COP_refrig. Similarly for the freezer, W_freezer = Q / COP_freezer. The ratio W_freezer / W_refrig would be (COP_refrig / COP_freezer). Because Q cancels out.

So the factor by which it's more expensive is (COP_refrig / COP_freezer).

So first, let's compute COP for each.

But wait, I need to use absolute temperatures for T_cold and T_hot.

So converting the earlier temperatures to Kelvin.

Refrigerator inside: T_cold_refrig = 2.222°C + 273.15 ≈ 275.37 K.

Freezer inside: T_cold_freezer = -17.78°C + 273.15 ≈ 255.37 K.

Room temperature: T_hot = 18.33°C + 273.15 ≈ 291.48 K.

So now, compute COP for refrigerator:

COP_refrig = T_cold_refrig / (T_hot - T_cold_refrig) = 275.37 / (291.48 - 275.37).

Let me calculate the denominator: 291.48 - 275.37 = 16.11 K.

So COP_refrig = 275.37 / 16.11 ≈ let's see, 275 /16 is about 17.1875. Let me do more accurately:

275.37 ÷ 16.11.

Hmm, 16.11 * 17 = 273.87. Oh, that's close to 275.37.

So 17 *16.11=273.87. The difference is 275.37 -273.87=1.5.

So 1.5 /16.11≈0.0931.

So total COP_refrig≈17.0931.

Wait, wait. Let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, 275.37 divided by 16.11.

Another way: Let's compute 275.37 / 16.11.

16.11 *17 = 273.87. So 275.37 -273.87=1.5.

So 1.5 /16.11=approx 0.0931.

So 17.0931.

So approximately 17.09.

Similarly, COP_freezer = T_cold_freezer / (T_hot - T_cold_freezer) = 255.37 / (291.48 - 255.37).

Compute denominator: 291.48 -255.37 =36.11 K.

So COP_freezer=255.37 /36.11 ≈ let's compute.

36.11 *7=252.77.

255.37-252.77=2.6.

So 2.6 /36.11≈0.072.

So total COP_freezer≈7.072.

Wait, let me check:

36.11 *7=252.77. 255.37-252.77=2.6.

2.6/36.11 = approximately 0.072.

So 7.072.

So now, the ratio COP_refrig / COP_freezer is 17.09 /7.072 ≈ let's compute.

17.09 /7 is about 2.441. But since it's 7.072, it would be a little less.

Compute 7.072 * 2.4 = let's see, 7 *2.4=16.8, 0.072*2.4=0.1728. So 16.9728.

But 17.09 is a bit more than that. The difference is 17.09 -16.9728=0.1172.

So 0.1172 /7.072 ≈0.0166.

So 2.4 +0.0166≈2.4166.

So approximately 2.4166.

Wait, but another approach: 7.072 × 2.4 = 17. (exactly 7.072 × 2.4 = 17. (7 *2.4=16.8, 0.072*2.4=0.1728; total 16.9728). So 17.09 is 0.1172 more than 16.9728.

So 0.1172 /7.072 ≈ let's calculate:

7.072 × 0.0166 ≈ 0.1172.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 17.09 /7.072.

Let me do this as a division:

7.072 ) 17.09

7.072 × 2 =14.144.

17.09 -14.144 =2.946.

Bring down a zero: 29.46.

7.072 ×0.4=2.8288.

29.46 -28.288=1.172.

Bring down another zero: 11.720.

7.072 ×0.016≈0.113.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps I can just approximate 17.09 /7.072 ≈ 2.416.

So the ratio is approximately 2.416.

Looking at the options, option F is 2.4, which is close.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the exact COP calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the COP_refrig.

Wait, T_cold_refrig = 275.37 K.

T_hot =291.48 K.

T_hot - T_cold_refrig =16.11 K.

So COP_refrig=275.37/16.11.

Let me compute 275.37 ÷16.11.

Let me calculate 16.11 ×17=273.87.

So 275.37-273.87=1.5.

So 1.5/16.11=0.09313.

So 17.09313.

So yes, that's correct.

COP_refrig ≈17.093.

COP_freezer =255.37/(291.48-255.37)=255.37/36.11.

Let me compute 255.37 ÷36.11.

36.11 ×7=252.77.

255.37-252.77=2.6.

2.6 ÷36.11≈0.072.

So 7.072.

So the ratio is 17.093 /7.072 ≈2.416.

So approximately 2.416, which is about 2.4. So the factor is 2.4.

Looking at options: option F is 2.4.

So the answer should be F.

To determine the factor by which it is more expensive to extract the same amount of heat from the freezer compared to the refrigerator, we use the coefficient of performance (COP) for a reversible refrigerator. The COP is given by:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{T_{\text{cold}}}{T_{\text{hot}} - T_{\text{cold}}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{cold}}\) and \(T_{\text{hot}}\) are the absolute temperatures of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively. The cost of extracting heat is inversely proportional to the COP, so the factor by which it is more expensive is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\text{COP}_{\text{refrigerator}}}{\text{COP}_{\text{freezer}}}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- Refrigerator interior: \(36^\circ \mathrm{F} = 2.22^\circ \mathrm{C} + 273.15 = 275.37 \, \mathrm{K}\)
- Freezer interior: \(0^\circ \mathrm{F} = -17.78^\circ \mathrm{C} + 273.15 = 255.37 \, \mathrm{K}\)
- Room temperature: \(65^\circ \mathrm{F} = 18.33^\circ \mathrm{C} + 273.15 = 291.48 \, \mathrm{K}\)

### Step 2: Calculate COP for the refrigerator
\[
\text{COP}_{\text{refrigerator}} = \frac{T_{\text{cold, refrigerator}}}{T_{\text{hot}} - T_{\text{cold, refrigerator}}}
\]
\[
\text{COP}_{\text{refrigerator}} = \frac{275.37}{291.48 - 275.37} = \frac{275.37}{16.11} \approx 17.09
\]

### Step 3: Calculate COP for the freezer
\[
\text{COP}_{\text{freezer}} = \frac{T_{\text{cold, freezer}}}{T_{\text{hot}} - T_{\text{cold, freezer}}}
\]
\[
\text{COP}_{\text{freezer}} = \frac{255.37}{291.48 - 255.37} = \frac{255.37}{36.11} \approx 7.07
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the factor
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\text{COP}_{\text{refrigerator}}}{\text{COP}_{\text{freezer}}} = \frac{17.09}{7.07} \approx 2.416
\]

### Final Answer
The factor by which it is more expensive to extract the same amount of heat from the freezer than from the refrigerator is approximately **2.4**, which corresponds to option **F**.
