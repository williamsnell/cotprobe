Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a nuclear reaction, and I'm supposed to find the Q value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the problem says that the reaction is initiated by 5.5 MeV alpha particles. The outgoing particles have kinetic energies of 1.1 MeV and 8.4 MeV. I need to find the Q value of the reaction in MeV.

Wait, what's the Q value again? I remember that Q is the difference between the total initial kinetic energy and the total final kinetic energy. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, Q is the energy released or absorbed in the reaction. So if the reaction is exothermic, Q is positive, and if it's endothermic, Q is negative.

The formula, I think, is Q equals the sum of the kinetic energies of the outgoing particles minus the kinetic energy of the incoming particle. Or wait, no, because the initial particle is the projectile, and the target is probably at rest. So the initial kinetic energy is just from the alpha particle, and the final is the sum of the two outgoing particles.

So the formula should be Q = (K1 + K2) - K_initial, where K1 and K2 are the kinetic energies of the two products. Or maybe the other way around? Wait, sometimes the Q value is calculated as the sum of the rest mass energies and then subtracting the kinetic energies. No, wait, that's more for determining whether a reaction is possible. But in this case, since we're given the kinetic energies, I think the approach is to sum the final kinetic energies and subtract the initial kinetic energy.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: the Q value is the energy released. So if the outgoing particles have more kinetic energy than the incoming, then Q is positive. So the formula should be Q = (E1 + E2) - E_initial, where E1 and E2 are the kinetic energies of the products.

So let me plug in the numbers. The incoming alpha has 5.5 MeV. The outgoing particles have 1.1 and 8.4 MeV. So sum of outgoing is 1.1 + 8.4 = 9.5 MeV. Initial is 5.5. So Q = 9.5 -5.5 = 4.0 MeV. So the Q value is 4.0 MeV, which would be option D.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: in reactions, sometimes the target nucleus is initially at rest. So the initial kinetic energy is just the alpha's. The final kinetic energy is the sum of the two products. So the total energy available is the initial kinetic plus the Q value (if positive, energy is released). So the sum of the final kinetic energies equals the initial kinetic energy plus Q. So rearranged, Q = (sum of final KE) - (initial KE).

So that's the same as I did before. So 1.1 + 8.4 =9.5. 9.5-5.5=4.0. So Q is 4.0, which is option D.

Alternatively, maybe I have it backwards. Let me think about conservation of energy. The total energy before the reaction is the kinetic energy of the alpha and the rest mass of the target nucleus. After the reaction, it's the kinetic energies of the products plus their rest mass. But wait, the Q value accounts for the rest mass differences. Hmm, maybe I confused the concepts.

Wait, the Q value is calculated as (mass of initial nuclei) c² minus (mass of final nuclei) c². But that's the intrinsic Q value. But when given kinetic energies, perhaps we can approximate using kinetic energies if the masses are not given. Or maybe the problem assumes that the initial target is at rest, so the reaction's Q is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products minus the projectile's kinetic energy.

Yes, so I think my initial approach is correct. So the answer should be D:4.0.

To determine the Q value of the nuclear reaction, we use the relationship:

\[
Q = (E_{\text{final}}) - (E_{\text{initial}})
\]

where \(E_{\text{final}}\) is the total kinetic energy of the outgoing particles, and \(E_{\text{initial}}\) is the kinetic energy of the incoming particle. 

From the problem:
- The incoming alpha particle has a kinetic energy of \(5.5 \, \text{MeV}\).
- The outgoing particles have kinetic energies of \(1.1 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(8.4 \, \text{MeV}\).

First, calculate the total kinetic energy of the outgoing particles:

\[
E_{\text{final}} = 1.1 + 8.4 = 9.5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Next, subtract the initial kinetic energy:

\[
Q = E_{\text{final}} - E_{\text{initial}} = 9.5 - 5.5 = 4.0 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the Q value of the reaction is \(4.0 \, \text{MeV}\), which corresponds to option D.
