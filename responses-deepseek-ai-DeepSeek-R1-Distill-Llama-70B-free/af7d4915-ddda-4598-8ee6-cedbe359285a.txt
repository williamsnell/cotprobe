Question:

A stroke that affects the posterior region of the corpus callosum, thus disconnecting the visual centers of the brain from the language centers of the brain, may result in this syndrome:

D: Alexia without agraphia
E: Apraxia
F: Agraphia without alexia
G: Dysarthria
H: Prosopagnosia
I: Wernicke's aphasia
J: Agnosia

Okay, so I have this question about a stroke affecting the posterior part of the corpus callosum and which syndrome it causes. Hmm, I remember that the corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres of the brain, right? So if there's damage, the hemispheres can't communicate as they should.

The question says the posterior part is affected. Wait, the posterior part of the corpus callosum is connected to the visual areas, I think. So if that part is damaged, maybe the visual information can't get to the language centers. That sounds familiar.

I remember something about alexia without agraphia. Alexia is when you can't read, and agraphia is not being able to write. So if it's alexia without agraphia, the person can write but can't read. But why would that happen?

Oh right, the visual information from the occipital lobe (which is in the posterior) is processed, and then it needs to get to the language centers, like Wernicke's area, which is in the left hemisphere. If the connection is broken, the visual words can't reach the language areas, so the person can't read. But they can still write because that's a different pathway, maybe through the angular gyrus or something else.

Wait, there's a condition called alexia without agraphia, also known as pure alexia or word blindness. It's caused by damage to the left occipito-temporal region or the splenium of the corpus callosum. Since the corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres, damage to the posterior part would block the transfer of visual info from the right occipital lobe to the left hemisphere's language centers.

So if the stroke is in the posterior corpus callosum, the visual information can't reach the language areas. So the person can't read (alexia), but since the areas responsible for writing are still functional, they can write (no agraphia). Thus, alexia without agraphia would be the result.

Looking at the options, option D is Alexia without agraphia. So the answer should be D.

A stroke affecting the posterior region of the corpus callosum disrupts communication between the visual centers and language centers of the brain. This disconnection prevents visual information from reaching the language processing areas, leading to an inability to read (alexia) while preserving the ability to write (agraphia). This condition is known as alexia without agraphia.

The correct answer is **D: Alexia without agraphia**.
