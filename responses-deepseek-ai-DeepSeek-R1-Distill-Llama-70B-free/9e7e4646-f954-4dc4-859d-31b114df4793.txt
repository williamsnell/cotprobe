Okay, so I've got this question here about an ethical dilemma for a psychologist. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is that Mrs. Wang's 14-year-old daughter witnessed an assault on her best friend three days ago. The girl is really distraught—she hasn't slept, won't eat, and can't stop crying. The psychologist in question has limited experience with adolescents and crisis intervention, but there's no one else in the community more experienced. So, the question is, what should the psychologist do?

First, I need to think about the ethical principles involved here. Psychologists have a duty to provide competent care. If they don't have the necessary skills or experience, they might not be able to help effectively and could potentially cause harm. But on the other hand, there's the principle of beneficence, which is about doing good and helping those in need. Also, there's non-maleficence, which means do no harm.

The psychologist doesn't have a lot of experience, but they do have some. The situation is urgent because the girl is in crisis. If the psychologist doesn't help, the girl might not get any help at all, which could make her condition worse. So, the psychologist has to decide whether to take the case despite their limited experience or to refer elsewhere, but in this case, there's no one else more experienced.

Looking at the options:

Option A: See the girl until the crisis ends or until alternative services are found. That seems responsible because it's temporary and the psychologist is acknowledging their limitations by planning to find better help later. But is it ethical to start therapy if they're not fully competent?

Option B: Train Mrs. Wang to provide crisis intervention. That doesn't seem right. Parents aren't trained professionals, and the situation is too serious for a layperson to handle without guidance.

Option C: Suggest waiting a few days. That's probably not good because the girl is in immediate distress. Delaying help could worsen her condition.

Option D: Agree to see her without disclosing lack of experience. That's unethical because informed consent requires the client to know about the therapist's qualifications. Not disclosing could be deceptive.

Option E: Refuse because of lack of experience. This might be the ethical choice if the psychologist genuinely believes they can't help. But if there's no one else, refusing might leave the girl without any support, which could be harmful.

Option F: Suggest forgetting the incident. That's bad advice. It's not a healthy way to cope, and could lead to more psychological issues.

Option G: Recommend group therapy. There's no info on whether group therapy is available or suitable, especially in a crisis situation. It might not be the immediate help needed.

Option H: Agree to see her because they've had some crisis experience. This is tricky. If they have some experience, even if limited, they might be better than nothing. But is it ethical to take on a case beyond their competence?

So, considering all this, the best options seem to be A and H. Option H is agreeing to see her based on some experience. Option A is seeing her temporarily until better help is found.

But wait, the question says the psychologist has limited experience but no one else is more experienced. So, perhaps the best they can do is to provide some help, even if not optimal, to prevent harm. Option A says they'll see her until the crisis ends or until they find alternative services. That way, they're not committing long-term but are providing immediate support.

Alternatively, Option H says they agree to see her because they have some experience. That might be better because it's a commitment to help, but without the caveat of seeking alternative services.

Wait, but ethically, psychologists are supposed to practice within their competence. If they don't feel competent enough, they shouldn't take the case. But in this case, there's no one else, so maybe they have to step in, even if it's not ideal.

So, the correct approach would be to offer help while being honest about their limitations and seeking to refer when possible. So, Option A seems better because it includes a plan to find better help.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question states that the psychologist has "limited" experience but is the most experienced in the community. So, perhaps they can provide some help, but they should be honest with Mrs. Wang about their limitations. Option A is about seeing her temporarily, which implies that they'll stop once the crisis is over or when they find someone better. That sounds ethical because they're not overstepping their capabilities long-term.

Alternatively, Option E is refusing to help, which might leave the girl without any help, which could be worse. So, the psychologist should try to help, even if not perfectly.

I think the correct answer is either A or H. Option H says they agree to see her because they've had some experience. That might be acceptable if they can provide some level of care. Option A is more about temporary help, which might be better ethically.

Wait, but Option H doesn't mention anything about their limitations. It's just agreeing to see her. Whereas Option A is agreeing to see her until the crisis ends or until alternative services are found, which is more responsible.

So, the most ethical choice would be Option A, because it's a temporary measure and acknowledges the need to find better help when possible.

The situation involves a psychologist with limited experience in working with adolescents and crisis intervention, yet they are the most experienced professional available in the community. Mrs. Wang’s 14-year-old daughter is in acute distress after witnessing an assault, and the psychologist must decide how to proceed ethically.

Key ethical principles include beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), and practicing within one’s competence. The psychologist must balance these principles: refusing to help (Option E) could leave the girl without support, potentially worsening her condition, while agreeing to help without proper disclosure (Option D) would violate informed consent. Suggesting the girl wait (Option C) or forget the incident (Option F) is inappropriate and potentially harmful. Training Mrs. Wang (Option B) or recommending group therapy (Option G) are not suitable immediate solutions.

Option A involves seeing the girl temporarily until the crisis resolves or alternative services are found, which is ethical as it provides immediate support while acknowledging the psychologist’s limitations and planning for better help. Option H involves agreeing to see her based on some experience but lacks the caveat of seeking alternative services, making it less ideal.

The most ethical choice is Option A, as it offers temporary support while responsibly planning for the girl’s long-term care.

Answer: A
