Okay, so I've got this question about how psychologists' views of infants have changed over the years. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think about what I remember from my psychology classes.

I remember that historically, people didn't think infants were very capable. Like, maybe they thought babies couldn't really think or learn much. But I think that's changed. Oh right, I think there was a shift where psychologists started seeing infants as more competent than previously believed.

Wait, so earlier views might have been that infants are passive and not really doing much thinking. But now, research shows that infants are actually capable of a lot. Like, they can recognize faces, understand some language, and even do some problem-solving, though not as complex as adults.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Psychologists now emphasize the functions that an infant can perform considering his lack of development. Hmm, that sounds a bit conflicting. I mean, if they have a lack of development, but can perform functions. Not sure if that's the main shift.

Option B: Infants can do complex reasoning like adults. No, that doesn't seem right. Adults have developed abstract thinking, infants don't have that yet.

Option C: Behavior is random. That seems outdated. I think current views are that behavior reflects cognitive processes, so this is probably not the answer.

Option D: No learning until toddler age. That's old school thinking. I remember that infants start learning immediately, like learning language sounds from birth.

Option E: Communicate like adults. No, infants can't talk or understand like adults do.

Option F: Miniature adults with all capacities. That's probably an old view, like from hundreds of years ago when people thought children were just small adults. Now we know development is a process.

Option G: Viewed as inadequate and passive. That sounds like the old view, not the current one. So this isn't the change.

Option H: No longer study infant behavior. That's not true. There's a lot of research on infants.

Option I: Only genetics, no environment. That's a nature vs nurture thing. I think the current understanding is that both influence development, so this isn't right.

Option J: Viewed as fully developed. No, that can't be right. Infants are just starting to develop.

Wait, the question is about how the view has changed. So earlier, psychologists might have thought infants were passive and not capable of much. Now, they recognize that infants are active learners, capable of more than previously thought. So which option reflects that?

Looking again, option A says psychologists emphasize functions considering lack of development. Hmm, maybe that's not the best fit. Or perhaps option G is the old view, so the change is that they no longer see infants as inadequate.

Wait, I think the change is from seeing infants as passive and not capable to seeing them as active and capable. So the correct answer would be that psychologists now view infants as more capable.

Looking back at the options, I don't see an option that says that directly. Wait, maybe option A is the right one. It says they emphasize functions the infant can perform despite lack of development. That could mean they recognize the abilities they do have, even though they're still developing.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite is true. Maybe the initial view was that infants couldn't do much, and the change is that now they are seen as having more abilities.

So the correct answer would be that psychologists now see infants as more capable, so the answer that reflects that is option A.

The way psychologists view infants has shifted significantly over time. Historically, infants were often seen as passive and lacking in cognitive abilities. However, contemporary research has led psychologists to recognize that infants are active learners with notable capabilities, such as recognizing faces, understanding language sounds, and demonstrating problem-solving skills, even if these abilities are not as advanced as those of adults. 

Among the given options, the best reflection of this change is Option A, which highlights that psychologists now emphasize the functions infants can perform, despite their ongoing development. This perspective underscores the recognition of infants' capabilities and active engagement in learning, marking a departure from earlier views that underestimated their abilities.

Answer: A
