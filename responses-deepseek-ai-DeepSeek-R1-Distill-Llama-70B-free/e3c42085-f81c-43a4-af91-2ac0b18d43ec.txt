Okay, so I have this question about converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. Hmm, I remember that the formula involves multiplying by 9/5 and then adding 32. Let me think. The question says the Celsius temperature is 36.6°C, and I need to find out what that is in Fahrenheit.

Wait, right, the formula is F = (C × 9/5) + 32. So let's plug in 36.6 for C. First, I should calculate 36.6 multiplied by 9/5. Let me do that step by step.

36.6 times 9 is... let's see, 36 times 9 is 324, and 0.6 times 9 is 5.4, so together that's 329.4. Then, divide that by 5 because it's 9/5. So 329.4 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 goes into 329 how many times? 5 times 65 is 325, so 65.8. Oh wait, 329.4 /5 = 65.88. So that's after multiplying by 9/5.

Then I add 32 to that. So 65.88 plus 32 is 97.88. Wait, but looking at the options, which one is closest to that? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: Option G is 97.9°, which would match 97.88, right? So the answer should be G. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

Another way: Maybe I can calculate 36.6°C. I know that 37°C is the normal body temperature, which is about 98.6°F. So 36.6 is a bit less than 37, so a bit less than 98.6. So 97.9 sounds about right. Yeah, that makes sense.

I think I did the steps correctly. So the answer should be option G.

To convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, the formula used is:

\[ F = \left( C \times \frac{9}{5} \right) + 32 \]

Given \( C = 36.6^\circ \mathrm{C} \), the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Multiply \( 36.6 \) by \( \frac{9}{5} \):  
   \[ 36.6 \times \frac{9}{5} = 65.88 \]

2. Add \( 32 \) to the result:  
   \[ 65.88 + 32 = 97.88 \]

Thus, \( 36.6^\circ \mathrm{C} \) is approximately \( 97.88^\circ \mathrm{F} \), which corresponds to option \( G \) (\( 97.9^\circ \mathrm{F} \)).

Additionally, knowing that \( 37^\circ \mathrm{C} \) is equivalent to \( 98.6^\circ \mathrm{F} \), \( 36.6^\circ \mathrm{C} \) being slightly less than \( 37^\circ \mathrm{C} \) aligns with the result of \( 97.9^\circ \mathrm{F} \).

The final answer is **G**.
