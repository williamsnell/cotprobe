Okay, so I have this question about the photoelectron spectrum of carbon, and I need to figure out which peak is at the lowest energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in photoelectron spectroscopy, the electrons are ejected from their orbitals when a photon hits them. The energy of the ejected electrons corresponds to the binding energy of the electrons in those orbitals. So, the lower the energy of the peak, the lower the binding energy—wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, the lower the energy of the peak, the higher the binding energy because higher binding energy means the electrons are more tightly held, so they require higher energy photons to eject them. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, photoelectron spectrum measures the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. The kinetic energy (KE) is related to the photon energy (hv) and the binding energy (BE) by the equation KE = hv - BE. So, if the photon energy is fixed, a higher binding energy means lower kinetic energy. So the peak with the lowest energy (meaning the lowest kinetic energy) would correspond to the highest binding energy.

In the case of carbon, which has atomic number 6, its electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p². So the orbitals present are 1s, 2s, and 2p. Wait, but wait, the question says the spectrum has three equally sized peaks. So that must correspond to electrons being ejected from the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals.

Wait, but wait, the 1s is lower in energy than 2s, which is lower than 2p. Or wait, no, the order is 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, etc., but when considering binding energies, the lower the principal quantum number (n), the higher the binding energy. So for carbon, the 1s electrons have the highest binding energy, then 2s, then 2p.

Wait, but according to the Aufbau principle, electrons fill lower energy levels first. But when it comes to binding energy, lower energy levels (like 1s) have higher binding energy because they're closer to the nucleus, so the nucleus holds them more tightly.

So in the photoelectron spectrum, the electrons with higher binding energy will have lower kinetic energy. So the 1s peak would be the one with the lowest kinetic energy. Because when you subtract a larger BE from the photon energy, you get a smaller KE.

Wait, let's think about an example. Suppose the photon energy is, say, 100 eV. If an electron in 1s has a BE of 90 eV, then KE is 10 eV. Another electron in 2s has BE of 80 eV, so KE is 20 eV. And 2p with BE 70 eV, KE is 30 eV. So the 1s peak would have the lowest energy (10 eV), 2s next (20), and 2p highest (30). So the lowest energy peak is from 1s.

Wait, but the question is about the peaks in the spectrum. So the peaks are arranged from low to high energy as 1s, 2s, 2p. Because their kinetic energies are in that order. So the lowest energy peak is 1s. So the correct answer should be J: The 1s peak has the lowest energy.

Looking back at the options:

A: 2p → Higher than 2s and 1s, so not the lowest.

B: 3d → Not present in carbon.

C: 2d → Not filled in carbon.

D: 1d → Doesn't exist for n=1.

E: 1p → Carbon has 2p filled, but 1p is not filled.

F: 3s → Not filled in carbon.

G:4s → Not filled.

H:3p → Not filled.

I:2s → Middle energy.

J:1s → Correct, as discussed.

So the answer is J.

The photoelectron spectrum of carbon has three peaks corresponding to electrons being ejected from the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals. The energy of these peaks is related to the binding energy of the electrons, with higher binding energy resulting in lower kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. 

In carbon, the 1s orbital has the highest binding energy, followed by the 2s orbital, and then the 2p orbital. Since the 1s electrons are most tightly bound to the nucleus, they require the most energy to eject, resulting in the lowest kinetic energy peak in the spectrum. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (2p)**: This peak has the highest energy due to the lowest binding energy among the three orbitals.  
- **B (3d)**, **C (2d)**, **D (1d)**, **E (1p)**, **F (3s)**, **G (4s)**, **H (3p)**: These orbitals are not occupied in carbon and are irrelevant.  
- **I (2s)**: This peak has a higher energy than 1s but lower than 2p.  
- **J (1s)**: This peak has the lowest energy due to the highest binding energy.  

Thus, the peak at the lowest energy corresponds to the 1s orbital. 

Answer: J
