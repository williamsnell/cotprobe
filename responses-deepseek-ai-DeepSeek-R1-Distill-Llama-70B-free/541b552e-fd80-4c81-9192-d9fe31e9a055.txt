Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate how much interest Jerry will pay on his loan. Let me read it again: he borrowed $400 for 60 days at a 6% annual interest rate. Hmm, I think I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

First, I remember that interest is usually calculated using the formula I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period. But wait, I need to make sure that all the units match here. The rate is given per year, so I think the time should also be in years, not days.

So the principal P is $400. The rate r is 6%, which I think I should convert to a decimal. Oh right, 6% as a decimal is 0.06. Now the time t is 60 days, but that's in days, and I need it in years. How do I convert days to years? Well, I know there are 365 days in a year, so I can divide 60 by 365 to get the time in years.

Let me calculate that: 60 divided by 365. Let me get that value. 60/365 is approximately 0.1644 years. Okay, so t is about 0.1644 years.

Now plug all the numbers into the formula. I = 400 * 0.06 * 0.1644. Let me calculate that step by step. First, 400 multiplied by 0.06. 400 times 0.06 is 24. That makes sense because 6% of 400 is 24. Then, I multiply that by 0.1644. So 24 times 0.1644. Let me do that multiplication.

I can approximate that 24 * 0.16 would be 3.84, and 24 * 0.0044 is about 0.1056. Adding those together gives roughly 3.84 + 0.1056 = 3.9456. So approximately $3.95 in interest. But wait, the options don't have that exact amount. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is $2, which seems too low. B is $9, that's higher. C is $4, which is close to my calculation. D is $1.50, too low. E is $10, too high. F is $8, still higher. G is $3, which is close to my $3.95. H is $5, I is $7, J is $6.

Wait, my calculation was about $3.95, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, maybe it's simple interest, and perhaps I should calculate it differently. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact fraction.

Let me try the exact calculation. 60 days is 60/365 years. So, 60/365 is approximately 0.16438356. So, I = 400 * 0.06 * (60/365). Let me compute 400 * 0.06 first, which is 24, as before. Then 24 * (60/365) = (24*60)/365. 24*60 is 1440. 1440 divided by 365. Let me do that division.

365 goes into 1440 how many times? Well, 365*3 is 1095, subtract that from 1440 gives 345. 365 goes into 345 zero times, so 3. So 3 times 365 is 1095, and 1440 - 1095 is 345. Now, 345 divided by 365 is 0.945. So the total is 3.945, which is $3.945. So approximately $3.95, which isn't an option exactly.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculation. Maybe I should compute it more accurately. So 1440 divided by 365. Let me try long division. 365 into 1440.

365 * 3 is 1095, as before. Subtract 1095 from 1440: 1440 - 1095 = 345. Bring down a zero (since we're dealing with decimals), making it 3450. 365 goes into 3450 how many times? 365*9=3285. 9 times. 3450 - 3285 = 165. Bring down another zero to make it 1650. 365 goes into 1650 four times (365*4=1460). Subtract 1460 from 1650: 190. Bring down another zero to make 1900. 365*5=1825. So 5 times. 1900-1825=75. So so far, it's 3.945... So yeah, about 3.945, so $3.95.

Looking back at the options, the closest one is G: $3.00 or C: $4.00. Hmm, but wait, perhaps the question is using a different method of calculation. Maybe it's using simple interest but with a different time consideration. Or perhaps it's using the exact 60 days without approximating.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated as (400 * 6%) for 60 days, which is 1/6 of a year because 60 is roughly 1/6 of 365 (wait, 365/6 is about 60.8, so 60 days is just a bit less than 1/6 of a year).

So 6% per year, so 1% per month roughly (since 12 months, 6/12=0.5% per month). Wait, 6% per year is 0.5% per month. So 60 days is about 2 months. So 0.5% *2 months = 1% of the principal. 1% of $400 is $4. So that would make the interest $4.00, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, 60 days isn't exactly 2 months. It's roughly 2 months, but depending on how the months are counted, maybe. But using this approximation, the interest would be $4.00, which is option C.

Alternatively, let's compute it exactly. The exact time in years is 60/365 = approximately 0.16438356 years. So the interest would be 400 * 0.06 * 0.16438356. Let me compute 400 * 0.06 first, which is 24. Then, 24 * 0.16438356 is approximately 24 * 0.16438.

Calculating 24 * 0.16 is 3.84, 24 * 0.00438 is approximately 0.10512. So adding them gives 3.84 + 0.10512 = 3.94512, which is about $3.95. So that's approximately $3.95. But the options don't have that exact amount.

Wait, perhaps the interest is being calculated using simple interest with the exact fraction, which would give $3.945, but when rounded to the nearest dollar, that's $4.00, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the options are using a different approximation, perhaps rounding down to the nearest dollar. But $3.95 is closer to $4 than $3, so it would round up to $4.00.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. Let me calculate it precisely.

I = P * r * t.

P = 400, r = 6% per annum, t = 60 days.

So t in years is 60 / 365.

So I = 400 * 0.06 * (60 / 365).

Let me compute 60/365 first. 60 ÷ 365 is approximately 0.16438356.

So I = 400 * 0.06 * 0.16438356.

Compute 400 * 0.06: that's 24.

24 * 0.16438356: let's compute this step.

24 * 0.1 = 2.4

24 * 0.06438356: let's compute 0.06 *24=1.44, 0.00438356 *24≈0.1052.

So 1.44 + 0.1052 = 1.5452.

So total is 2.4 + 1.5452 = 3.9452.

So approximately $3.95. But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated with 60 days as 1/6 of a year, which is approximately 0.1666667 years.

So let me compute 400 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 400 * 0.01 = $4.00.

Ah, that's exactly $4.00, which is option C. So perhaps the question assumes that 60 days is 1/6 of a year. Because 60 days is approximately 1/6 of 365 days (365/6 is about 60.8), so it's roughly 1/6. So using t=1/6, the calculation becomes simpler and the interest is exactly $4.00.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C: $4.00.

Wait, but which approach is correct? Using the exact time (60/365) or approximating 60 days as 1/6 of a year. Because 60 days is exactly 1/6 of 360 days, but a year is 365, so it's an approximation. But perhaps the question expects us to use 60 days as 1/6 of a year, making the calculation straightforward.

So in that case, the interest would be 400 * 6% * (60/360). Wait, wait, no, wait: 60 days is 1/6 of a year when considering 360 days in a year for some financial calculations, but that's a different approach. Let me clarify.

Wait, I think the standard approach is to use 365 days a year for simple interest calculations unless stated otherwise. So the exact calculation would be 60/365, leading to about $3.95. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects us to use 60 days as 1/6 of a year, leading to $4.00, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's using simple interest for the exact days, but without converting to years. Wait, no, the rate is annual, so time must be in years.

Wait another approach: maybe the interest is calculated using the simple interest formula, but sometimes the formula is expressed as I = (P * R * T) / 100. So substituting, it would be I = (400 * 6 * 60) / (100 * 365). Let me compute that.

So 400 *6 = 2400, 2400 *60=144000. Then, 100 *365=36500. So 144000 / 36500 = let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 1440 / 365.

As before, 1440 ÷ 365 is approximately 3.945, which is about $3.95.

Hmm, but again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is $4.00, option C, assuming 60 days as 1/6 of a year. Maybe the question expects that approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are rounded to the nearest dollar. So $3.95 rounds up to $4.00, making option C correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option G is $3.00, which is $3, and option C is $4. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck.

I = P * R * T, where R is in decimal and T is in years.

So P=$400, R=6% per year, T=60 days.

So T in years is 60/365 = 0.16438356.

So I = 400 * 0.06 * 0.16438356.

Compute 400 * 0.06 first: 400 * 0.06 = 24.

Then 24 * 0.16438356 = approximately 3.945.

So around $3.95. But the options are A:2, B:9, C:4, D:1.5, E:10, F:8, G:3, H:5, I:7, J:6.

So the closest is $4.00, option C.

Therefore, the correct answer should be C: $4.00.

To calculate the interest Jerry will pay on his loan of $400 for 60 days at an annual interest rate of 6%, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$400 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t = \frac{60}{365} \) (time in years).

### Step 1: Convert time to years
\[
t = \frac{60}{365} \approx 0.1644 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the interest
\[
I = 400 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.1644.
\]

First, calculate \( 400 \cdot 0.06 \):
\[
400 \cdot 0.06 = 24.
\]

Then, multiply by \( 0.1644 \):
\[
24 \cdot 0.1644 \approx 3.945.
\]

Thus, the interest is approximately \( \$3.95 \).

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated interest (\$3.95) is closest to \$4.00, which corresponds to **option C**. It appears the question assumes 60 days as approximately \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a year for simplicity, leading to a round interest amount of \$4.00.

### Final Answer:
C: \$4.00

The answer is **C**.
