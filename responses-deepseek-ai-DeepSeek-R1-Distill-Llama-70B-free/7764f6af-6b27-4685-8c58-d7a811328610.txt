Okay, so I have this problem here about a double star and an interference pattern from a double slit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is that a large telescope is looking at a double star, and there's an adjustable double slit in front of the objective. The distance between the centers of the two slits is being increased until the fringes disappear. The distance given is 57.5 cm. I need to find the angular separation of the two stars, and the options are in seconds of arc.

Wait, I remember something about the Rayleigh criterion here. The idea is that when two point sources (like the double star) are just barely resolvable, the first minimum of one falls on the maximum of the other. Or wait, is it when the fringes disappear? Maybe that's a different scenario. Oh right, when the fringes disappear, it's because the angular separation is such that the diffraction patterns start to overlap enough that you can't distinguish them anymore. So maybe that's the point where the separation is equal to the resolving power of the instrument.

The formula I think is θ = 1.22 λ / D, but wait, that's for the resolving power of a telescope with aperture D. But wait, in this problem, the setup is a bit different because it's using a double slit. Oh wait, no, the double slit is placed in front of the telescope's objective. So maybe the double slit acts as a way to measure the angular separation.

Wait, when the fringes disappear, perhaps the slit separation is such that the angle θ is equal to the angle between the two stars. So the condition is that the slit separation d causes the light from each star to interfere in such a way that when θ is just right, the fringes disappear.

I recall that in a double slit setup, the condition for constructive interference is d sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. But when the fringes disappear, perhaps the separation is such that the angle θ causes the diffraction patterns to no longer form distinct fringes. Hmm, alternatively, when the distance between the slits is increased beyond a certain point, the interference fringes (like Young's fringes) disappear because the angle θ is too large for the interference to be effective.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the telescope with the double slit in front. The double slit's separation d is being increased until the interference fringes disappear. So, the point where fringes disappear is when the path difference from the two slits for the two stars' light causes destructive interference across the field. Or perhaps, the angle θ is such that the two sources are so far apart that their diffraction patterns don't overlap, making the fringes disappear.

Wait, I think the correct approach here is using the resolving power based on the double slit. The condition for the fringes to disappear is when the angular separation θ is such that the first minimum of one source coincides with the maximum of the other, which is the Rayleigh criterion. But wait, how does that apply here?

Wait, Rayleigh's criterion says that two sources are just resolvable when the first diffraction minimum of one overlaps the central maximum of the other. The formula for the resolving angle is θ = 1.22 λ / (D), where D is the diameter of the aperture. But in this case, the setup uses a double slit in front of the telescope's objective. So maybe the relevant parameter here is the separation between the two slits, which is d.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between the slits, d, relates to the resolving power in a different way. Let me think. When the two slits are too far apart, the interference pattern (fringes) become too fine and may disappear beyond the resolving capability of the system.

Wait, perhaps when the path difference between the two slits for light coming from the two stars causes destructive interference, leading to the disappearance of fringes. So the condition is that the path difference is λ/2, leading to destructive interference, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the maximum angle θ is when the two sources are just resolvable, so the formula would relate θ, d, and λ.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ = λ / (d). But wait, that's the condition for the first minimum in a single slit diffraction, but here it's a double slit. Wait, no. For double slit, the fringe spacing is given by (λ L)/d, where L is the distance to the screen.

But in this scenario, the screen is perhaps the image plane of the telescope. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again. The problem involves the angular separation of two stars, which causes an interference pattern when a double slit is placed in front of the telescope. As d increases, the fringes get closer together. When d is too large, the fringes disappear.

Wait, when the separation d is such that the angle θ between the two stars is sufficient that the interference pattern's period is smaller than the resolving power of the instrument. So maybe θ is equal to the fringe spacing, which would be λ/(d), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when d is such that the angle θ equals λ/(d), the fringes just disappear.

Wait, no. The formula for the angular size when the fringes disappear might be θ = λ/(d). Because when the angular separation is larger than λ/d, the interference patterns from each slit would not overlap, causing the fringes to disappear. So when the two stars are separated by θ, if θ > λ/d, you can't get interference anymore.

Wait, but in this problem, the distance between the slits is increased until the fringes disappear. So when d is such that θ = λ/(d), that's the maximum angle that can cause interference. So the angular separation of the two stars is θ = λ/d.

Wait, let's check the units. λ is in angstroms (convert to meters), and d is in centimeters (convert to meters). So θ would be in radians, but we need to convert it to seconds of arc.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The formula I'm recalling is that the resolving power of a lens is given by θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the lens. But this is for a circular aperture. In this problem, though, it's a double slit, so the formula might be different.

Alternatively, for a double slit, the condition for the disappearance of fringes is when the angular separation θ is greater than λ/d, where d is the slit separation. So when θ > λ/d, the fringes disappear because the path difference from the two slits to the two sources is too large for constructive interference.

Wait, but in this problem, when d is increased until the fringes disappear, that implies that θ is equal to λ/d. So θ = λ/d.

Let me calculate that. Given:

λ = 5550 Å = 5550e-10 m = 5.55e-7 m

d = 57.5 cm = 0.575 m

So θ = λ/d = (5.55e-7 m) / (0.575 m) = approx 9.65e-7 radians.

Now, to convert radians to seconds of arc. I remember that 1 radian is approximately 206265 seconds of arc. So:

θ (seconds) = 9.65e-7 rad * (206265 arcsec/rad) ≈

Let me compute that. 9.65e-7 * 2.06265e5 = 

9.65e-7 * 2e5 = approx 0.193 seconds of arc.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

9.65e-7 * 206265 = ?

206265 * 9.65e-7 = 206265 * 0.000000965.

Let me compute 206265 * 0.000000965:

Multiply 206265 by 965e-9.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 206265 * 9.65e-7.

206265 * 9.65e-7 = ?

206265 * 9.65 = ?

Let me compute 206265 * 9 = 1,856,385

206265 * 0.65 = approx 134,072.25

So total is approx 1,856,385 + 134,072.25 = 1,990,457.25

Then multiply by 1e-7: 1,990,457.25e-7 = approx 0.199045725 seconds.

So about 0.199 seconds of arc, which is approximately 0.2 seconds. Looking at the options, option J is 0.2 seconds.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Wait, I used θ = λ / d, but is that correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is θ = 1.22 λ / d. Because in the Rayleigh criterion, it's 1.22 λ / D for a circular aperture. But here, it's a double slit, so maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps for a double slit, the resolving limit is θ = λ/(2d), or some other factor. Because the double slit's resolving power is different. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the maximum angle θ that can be resolved by a double slit of separation d is given by the condition that the path difference from the two slits to the two sources leads to destructive interference, which would be when d sinθ = λ/2. So θ = arcsin(λ/(2d)).

Wait, that might be the case. Because for destructive interference, the path difference would be λ/2. So, in that case, the angular separation θ would be when d sinθ = λ/2. So sinθ = λ/(2d).

Given that θ is very small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ in radians.

So θ ≈ λ/(2d).

Let me compute that:

λ = 5550 Å = 5.55e-7 m

d = 0.575 m

So sinθ ≈ (5.55e-7) / (2 * 0.575) = (5.55e-7) / 1.15 ≈ 4.826e-7 radians.

Convert to seconds of arc: 4.826e-7 rad * 206265 ≈ 

4.826e-7 * 2.06265e5 = 

Multiply 4.826 * 206.265 ≈ let's compute 4.826 * 206.265.

4 * 200 = 800.

0.826 * 200 = 165.2.

4 * 6.265 = 25.06.

0.826 * 6.265 ≈ around 5.18.

So adding up: 800 + 165.2 = 965.2 +25.06=990.26 +5.18≈995.44.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, 4.826 * 206.265 ≈ 

Well, 4 * 200 = 800, 0.826*200=165.2, 4*6.265=25.06, 0.826*6.265≈5.18.

So 800 + 165.2=965.2, +25.06=990.26, +5.18≈995.44.

Wait, but wait, the actual calculation is 4.826 * 206.265 = let me compute:

4.826 * 200 = 965.2

4.826 * 6.265 = 

4 * 6.265 = 25.06

0.826 * 6.265 = approx 5.18

So total 25.06 +5.18 = 30.24

So total is 965.2 +30.24 = 995.44.

But since it's 4.826e-7 * 2.06265e5 = (4.826 * 1e-7) * (2.06265e5) = 4.826 * 2.06265e-2.

Wait, no: 1e-7 * 1e5 = 1e-2. So it's (4.826 * 2.06265) * 1e-2.

So 4.826 * 2.06265 ≈ let's compute this:

Approx 4 * 2 = 8.

0.826 * 2 = 1.652.

4 * 0.06265 ≈ 0.2506.

0.826 * 0.06265 ≈ approx 0.0518.

Adding all together: 8 + 1.652 =9.652 + 0.2506=9.9026 +0.0518≈9.9544.

So 9.9544 * 1e-2 = 0.099544 seconds of arc.

Hmm, that's about 0.1 seconds, which would correspond to option E.

Wait, but earlier when I used θ = λ/d, I got about 0.199 seconds, which is 0.2, option J. Now, using θ = λ/(2d), I get 0.0995, about 0.1, option E.

I'm getting conflicting results based on which formula I use. So which is the correct approach?

I think I need to clarify the condition under which the fringes disappear. When the double slit is used, the interference pattern is formed because light from both slits interferes. If the two sources (the double star) are too far apart, then the interference patterns from each source don't overlap, causing the fringes to disappear.

The condition for the disappearance of fringes is when the angular separation is large enough that the path difference from each slit to the two sources causes the interference to average out. So the maximum angle where fringes are still visible is when the path difference is λ/2, leading to destructive interference, meaning that for angles larger than this, the fringes disappear.

So the formula would be d sinθ = λ/2 → sinθ = λ/(2d) → θ ≈ λ/(2d) since θ is small.

So in this calculation, the angle would be approximately λ/(2d) → 5.55e-7 m / (2 * 0.575 m) = 5.55e-7 / 1.15 ≈ 4.826e-7 radians.

Convert that to seconds of arc: multiply by 206265, which gives approx 0.0995 seconds, so 0.1 seconds of arc, which is option E.

But wait, in the first approach, I used θ = λ/d and got 0.199, which is 0.2. But using this new condition, it's 0.0995.

I think the correct formula here is the second one, because when the separation is such that d sinθ = λ/2, that's the point where the fringes disappear. So the angle would be about 0.1 seconds, option E.

To determine the angular separation of the two components of the double star, we analyze the situation where the interference fringes disappear when the distance between the centers of the double slit, \( d \), is increased to 57.5 cm. The disappearance of fringes occurs when the angular separation of the two stars, \( \theta \), satisfies the condition for destructive interference. Specifically, the path difference between the two slits for light from the two stars becomes \( \lambda / 2 \), leading to the disappearance of the fringes.

The formula for the angular separation is derived from the condition \( d \sin\theta = \lambda / 2 \). For small angles, \( \sin\theta \approx \theta \), so:

\[
\theta = \frac{\lambda}{2d}
\]

### Given:
- Wavelength of light, \( \lambda = 5550 \, \text{Å} = 5.55 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \)
- Slit separation, \( d = 57.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.575 \, \text{m} \)

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\theta = \frac{5.55 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 0.575} = \frac{5.55 \times 10^{-7}}{1.15} \approx 4.826 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{radians}
\]

To convert radians to seconds of arc, use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{radian} = 206265 \, \text{arcseconds} \):

\[
\theta = 4.826 \times 10^{-7} \times 206265 \approx 0.0995 \, \text{arcseconds}
\]

Thus, the angular separation of the two components of the double star is approximately \( 0.1 \, \text{arcseconds} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **E: 0.1 second of arc**.
