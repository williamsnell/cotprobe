Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the answer using the Müller method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The equation given is log base 10 of x minus x plus 3 equals zero. So, it's log₁₀(x) - x + 3 = 0. And they've given me initial guesses: x₀ = 1/4, x₁ = 1/2, and x₂ = 1. I need to find x₃ after two iterations of the Müller method.

Wait, what's the Müller method again? From what I remember, it's a numerical method for finding roots, kind of like the secant method but using quadratic interpolation. Oh right, it uses the last three points to fit a quadratic equation and then finds the next approximation by evaluating where that quadratic would cross the x-axis.

So the formula for the Müller method is something like this, right? The next point x₃ is calculated using the previous three points (x₀, x₁, x₂) and their function values (f(x₀), f(x₁), f(x₂)). The formula involves some determinants or solving a system, maybe using divided differences.

Let me jot down the formula. I think the next x, x₃, is given by:

x₃ = x₂ - ( (f[x₂] * (x₂ - x₁) * (x₂ - x₀)) ) / ( (f[x₂] - f[x₁])*(x₂ - x₁) - (f[x₁] - f[x₀])*(x₂ - x₀) ) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll try to recall. Alternatively, I remember that the method uses the concept of finite differences and sets up a quadratic equation. The quadratic equation is in the form f(x) = a(x - x₂)(x - x₁) + b(x - x₂) + c, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's based on fitting a parabola through the three points, then finding where that parabola crosses the x-axis.

Wait, maybe I should first compute the function values at x₀, x₁, and x₂.

The function is f(x) = log₁₀(x) - x + 3.

So let me calculate each f(x):

Starting with x₀ = 1/4 = 0.25.

f(x₀) = log₁₀(0.25) - 0.25 + 3.

Log base 10 of 0.25 is log10(1/4) = log10(4^-1) = -log10(4). Since log10(2)=0.3010, log10(4)=0.6020, so log10(0.25) is approximately -0.6020.

So f(x₀) = (-0.6020) - 0.25 + 3 = (-0.852) +3 = 2.148.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation: -0.602 minus 0.25 is -0.852, plus 3 is 2.148. Yes.

Next, x₁ = 1/2 = 0.5.

f(x₁) = log10(0.5) - 0.5 + 3.

Log10(0.5) is same as log10(1/2) = -log10(2) ≈ -0.3010.

So f(x₁) = (-0.3010) - 0.5 +3 = (-0.801) +3 = 2.199. Hmm, wait, 3 - 0.801 is 2.199, yes.

Wait, wait, 3 - 0.5 is 2.5, minus 0.301 is 2.199. Correct.

Now x₂ = 1.

f(x₂) = log10(1) -1 +3.

Log10(1)=0, so 0 -1 +3 = 2.

So now I have:

x₀ = 0.25, f(x₀)=2.148

x₁ = 0.5, f(x₁)=2.199

x₂ = 1, f(x₂)=2.0

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if I'm using the Müller method, which is for finding roots, and the function is f(x)=0, but all these f(x) values are positive. So we're looking for the root where f(x)=0, but right now all the points are above zero. So the function must cross zero somewhere beyond x=1, perhaps.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes calculating f(x).

Wait, f(x) = log₁₀(x) - x +3.

At x=1: log10(1)=0. 0 -1 +3 =2. Correct.

At x=0.5: log10(0.5)= -0.3010. So 0.5's f(x) is -0.3010 -0.5 +3 = 2.199.

x=0.25: log10(0.25)= -0.602, so f(x)= -0.602 -0.25 +3 =2.148.

Wait, but that's strange. So all three points have positive function values. So the function is positive at x=0.25, 0.5, and 1. So the root must be somewhere beyond x=1, because as x increases, log10(x) increases, but x is increasing linearly, so perhaps the function starts to decrease beyond x=1.

Wait, but let's think about the behavior of f(x) as x increases beyond 1. Let's try x=10: log10(10)=1. So 1 -10 +3= -6. So f(10) is -6, which is negative.

So somewhere between x=1 and x=10, the function crosses from positive to negative, so the root is there. So that's where the next iteration will probably go, beyond x=1.

But the question is to perform two iterations starting from x₀, x₁, x₂, and find x₃. So perhaps after two iterations, we get x₃, which is the next guess.

Wait, but wait, the question says to perform two iterations. So the first iteration would give x₃, and the second would give x₄, but maybe the question is only asking for x₃, which is after the first iteration beyond x₂.

Wait, let me clarify: The problem says "perform 2 iterations" with the given x₀, x₁, x₂. So starting from x₀, x₁, x₂, the first iteration would compute x₃, and the second iteration would compute x₄. But the question is asking for x₃, which is after one iteration beyond the initial points.

Wait, no, perhaps the initial points are x₀, x₁, x₂, and the first iteration (n=2) gives x₃, and the second iteration (n=3) would give x₄. So in this problem, they're asking for x₃ after two iterations. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the iterations count. Let me think again.

Wait, in the Müller method, you start with three initial points, x₀, x₁, x₂. Then, each iteration uses the last three points to compute the next x. So the first iteration after x₂ would compute x₃, using x₀, x₁, x₂. Then, the next iteration would compute x₄, using x₁, x₂, x₃. So if the problem states that we perform two iterations starting from x₀, x₁, x₂, then x₃ is the result after the first iteration, and x₄ after the second. But the question is asking for x₃, which is after the first iteration beyond the initial points.

So I need to compute x₃ using the three initial points.

So let me proceed to compute x₃.

The formula for the Müller method is:

x₃ = x₂ - ( (f(x₂) * (x₂ - x₁) * (x₂ - x₀)) ) / D

Where D is the determinant of a certain matrix, or perhaps I should think in terms of divided differences. Alternatively, another approach is to set up a quadratic equation that passes through the three points (x₀, f(x₀)), (x₁, f(x₁)), (x₂, f(x₂))), find the quadratic equation, and then find where it crosses zero.

Wait, maybe the approach is to model f(x) as a quadratic function in the form:

f(x) ≈ a (x - x₁)(x - x₀) + b (x - x₁) + c

But perhaps another way is to use the method of finite differences. Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

x₃ = x₂ - f(x₂) * [ (x₂ - x₁) / (f(x₂) - f(x₁)) + (x₂ - x₀) / (f(x₂) - f(x₀)) ) ]^{-1}

Wait, I'm not confident about that. Perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, I found a resource once that said the Müller iteration formula is:

x_{n+1} = x_n - ( (f(x_n) * (x_n - x_{n-1}) * (x_n - x_{n-2})) ) / ( (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}))*(x_n - x_{n-1}) - (f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2}) ))*(x_n - x_{n-2}) ) )

Wait, maybe that's the correct formula. Let me try to parse this.

So, substituting x₀, x₁, x₂ as the previous three points, f(x₀)=2.148, f(x₁)=2.199, f(x₂)=2.0.

Plugging into the formula:

x₃ = x₂ - [ f(x₂) * (x₂ - x₁) * (x₂ - x₀) ] / [ (f(x₂)-f(x₁))*(x₂ - x₁) - (f(x₁)-f(x₀))*(x₂ - x₀) ) ]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the numerator: f(x₂) * (x₂ - x₁) * (x₂ - x₀).

f(x₂)=2.0

x₂ - x₁ = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

x₂ - x₀ = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75

So numerator = 2.0 * 0.5 * 0.75 = 2.0 * 0.375 = 0.75

Now, the denominator is (f(x₂)-f(x₁))*(x₂ - x₁) - (f(x₁)-f(x₀))*(x₂ - x₀)

Compute each term:

(f(x₂) - f(x₁)) = 2.0 - 2.199 = -0.199

Multiply by (x₂ - x₁) = 0.5: (-0.199)*0.5 = -0.0995

Next term: (f(x₁)-f(x₀)) = 2.199 - 2.148 = 0.051

Multiply by (x₂ - x₀) = 0.75: 0.051 * 0.75 = 0.03825

Now, subtract the second product from the first: (-0.0995) - 0.03825 = -0.13775

So denominator = -0.13775

Putting it all together, the fraction is numerator/denominator = 0.75 / (-0.13775) ≈ -5.444 (approximately).

So x₃ = x₂ - ( -5.444 ) = x₂ + 5.444.

x₂ is 1, so x₃ = 1 + 5.444 = 6.444.

Wait, that can't be right because the options given are all between 1.5 and 4.6. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the formula again. I think I might have messed up the denominator's sign. Let me double-check the denominator computation.

Denominator = [ (f₂ - f₁)(x₂ - x₁) ] - [ (f₁ - f₀)(x₂ - x₀) ]

Which is ( (2.0 - 2.199) * 0.5 ) - ( (2.199 - 2.148) * 0.75 )

So ( -0.199 * 0.5 ) - ( 0.051 * 0.75 )

Which is (-0.0995) - (0.03825) = -0.13775. So denominator is negative, as I had before.

So numerator is 0.75, so 0.75 / (-0.13775) ≈ -5.444

So x₃ = x₂ - (-5.444) = 1 + 5.444 = 6.444.

Wait, but that's way beyond any of the options given, which max out at 4.6. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me rethink.

Wait, maybe the formula for the Müller method is different. Perhaps it's better to model the quadratic equation and find its root.

So, assuming f(x) can be approximated by a quadratic function passing through (x₀, f(x₀)), (x₁, f(x₁)), (x₂, f(x₂)). So let's model f(x) = a x² + b x + c.

We can set up a system of equations:

At x = x₀: a x₀² + b x₀ + c = f(x₀)

At x = x₁: a x₁² + b x₁ + c = f(x₁)

At x = x₂: a x₂² + b x₂ + c = f(x₂)

Solving this system will give a, b, c, and then the root of the quadratic equation a x² + b x + c = 0 will give the next approximation x₃.

Wait, but since the function is being approximated by a quadratic, the root of the quadratic would be the next estimate. So let's set up the equations.

Given x₀ = 0.25, f(x₀)=2.148

x₁ = 0.5, f(x₁)=2.199

x₂ =1, f(x₂)=2.0

So, writing the system:

1) a*(0.25)^2 + b*(0.25) + c = 2.148 → 0.0625 a + 0.25 b + c = 2.148

2) a*(0.5)^2 + b*(0.5) + c = 2.199 → 0.25 a + 0.5 b + c = 2.199

3) a*(1)^2 + b*(1) + c = 2.0 → a + b + c = 2.0

Now, we can solve this system of three equations.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(0.25a + 0.5b + c) - (0.0625a + 0.25b + c) = 2.199 - 2.148

0.1875a + 0.25b = 0.051 → equation 4.

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

(a + b + c) - (0.25a + 0.5b + c) = 2.0 - 2.199 → 0.75a + 0.5b = -0.199 → equation 5.

Now, we have two equations: equation 4 and equation 5.

Equation 4: 0.1875a + 0.25b = 0.051

Equation 5: 0.75a + 0.5b = -0.199

Let me express equation 4 as:

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate decimals: 3a + 4b = 0.816 → equation 4a.

Equation 5: Multiply by 2 to eliminate decimals: 1.5a + b = -0.398 → equation 5a.

Wait, perhaps better to solve equation 4 and 5 using substitution or elimination.

From equation 4: 0.1875a + 0.25b = 0.051.

Let me solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b.

0.25b = 0.051 - 0.1875a → b = (0.051 - 0.1875a)/0.25 → b = 0.204 - 0.75a.

Now plug this into equation 5:

0.75a + 0.5*(0.204 - 0.75a) = -0.199

Expand:

0.75a + 0.102 - 0.375a = -0.199

Combine like terms:

(0.75a - 0.375a) + 0.102 = -0.199 → 0.375a + 0.102 = -0.199 → 0.375a = -0.199 - 0.102 → 0.375a = -0.301 → a = -0.301 / 0.375 → a ≈ -0.8033.

Now, substitute a back into equation 4a: 3a +4b =0.816.

Wait, alternatively, using the expression for b in terms of a: b=0.204 - 0.75a.

So with a≈-0.8033, then:

b= 0.204 - 0.75*(-0.8033) → 0.204 + 0.6025 ≈ 0.8065.

Now, from equation 3: a + b + c = 2.0 → c = 2.0 -a -b → 2.0 - (-0.8033) - 0.8065 → 2.0 +0.8033 -0.8065 ≈ 2.0 -0.0032 ≈ 1.9968.

So now, the quadratic is approximately f(x) ≈ a x² + b x + c → -0.8033 x² + 0.8065 x + 1.9968.

Now, find the root of this quadratic equation: -0.8033 x² + 0.8065 x + 1.9968 = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier: 0.8033 x² -0.8065 x -1.9968 =0.
