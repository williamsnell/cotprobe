Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. Shodi earned 389 points in the first level of her video game, and then she got an additional 116 points in the bonus round. The question is asking how many points she earned in total from both the first level and the bonus round. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Alright, so I think I need to add the two numbers together. The first level is 389 points, and the bonus is 116. So, 389 plus 116. Let me do that step by step because I sometimes make mistakes with addition.

Let me write it down:

  389
+116
------
?

Starting from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place. 9 plus 6 is 15. So I write down 5 and carry over 1 to the tens place.

Next, the tens place. 8 plus 1 (from the carryover) is 9, and then add the 1 from 116's tens place, which is 1. So 8 + 1 +1 = 10? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the 116 has a 1 in the tens place, right? So 8 (from 389's tens) plus 1 (from 116's tens) plus the carryover 1 makes 10? Hmm, wait that can't be right because 8+1 is 9, plus 1 is 10. Oh yeah, right. So that's 0 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.

Now the hundreds place. 3 plus 1 (from 116's hundreds place, which is 1) plus any carryover. Wait, 389's hundreds digit is 3, 116's is 1. So 3 + 1 is 4, and we have a carryover of 1 from the tens. So 4 + 1 is 5. So the hundreds place is 5.

Putting it all together, the sum would be 505. So the total points Shodi earned is 505.

Looking at the options, option J is 505. So the answer should be J.

Wait, let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when adding, it's easy to slip up with the carryovers.

So 389 + 116: 

- 9 +6=15 → 5 with carryover 1.
- 8 +1=9 plus carryover 1 makes 10 → 0 with carryover 1.
- 3 +1=4 plus carryover 1 makes 5.

Yes, that's correct. So 389 +116 equals 505. So option J is correct.

The total points Shodi earned is calculated by adding 389 and 116, resulting in 505.

Answer: J
