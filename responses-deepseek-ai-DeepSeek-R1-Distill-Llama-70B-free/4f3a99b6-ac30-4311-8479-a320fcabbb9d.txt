Okay, so I've got these two linear algebra statements to evaluate, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what each statement is saying.

Statement 1: If T: V → W is a linear transformation and dim(V) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective.

Wait, dim(W) is less than 1? Hmm, dimensions are non-negative integers, right? So the only possibility for dim(W) < 1 is that dim(W) is 0. But if dim(W) is zero, that means W is the trivial vector space containing only the zero vector. So any linear transformation from V to W would send every vector in V to the zero vector in W. But then what about injectivity?

An injective (one-to-one) transformation requires that each vector in V maps to a distinct vector in W. But if W is {0}, then every vector in V is mapped to 0. So, unless V is also {0}, the transformation can't be injective because multiple vectors in V would map to the same 0 in W. So for T to be injective, V would also have to be the zero vector space. But Statement 1 says dim(V) < dim(W), which would mean 0 < 0 if W is zero-dimensional, which isn't possible. So maybe I'm misunderstanding, or perhaps the statement has a typo.

Wait, maybe the original statement meant dim(W) < some other number, but as written, it's dim(W) < 1. So dim(W) must be 0. But then dim(V) must be less than 0, which isn't possible because dimensions are at least 0. So this seems contradictory. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the statement.

Wait, perhaps the statement is supposed to say something else, like dim(V) < dim(W), but then it also says dim(W) < 1, which would imply dim(W) is 0. So if both V and W are zero-dimensional, but dim(V) < dim(W) would require 0 < 0, which isn't possible. So perhaps the statement's premise is impossible. So in that case, the implication is vacuously true because there's no such transformation where dim(V) < dim(W) < 1, except when both are zero, which can't satisfy the inequality. So maybe Statement 1 is vacuously true.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. If dim(W) < 1, then dim(W) must be 0. So W is {0}. So V must have a dimension less than 0? No, because dimensions are non-negative. So the premise of Statement 1 is impossible because there's no V and W where dim(V) < dim(W) and dim(W) < 1. So in logic, an implication with a false premise is considered true. So Statement 1 would be true because the condition can't be met. But then, T would have to be injective, but since the premise can't be satisfied, it's vacuous. So Statement 1 is True.

Wait, but that feels off because if W is zero-dimensional, then the only transformation is the zero map, which is not injective unless V is also zero-dimensional. But in this case, the premise requires dim(V) < dim(W), which would be 0 < 0, which is impossible. So the condition can never be met, making the statement vacuously true. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V → V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection.

I remember something about square matrices and injectivity implying surjectivity. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, if a linear transformation is injective, it must also be surjective, hence bijective. Because the dimension of the domain and codomain are the same. So if T is injective, the image must span V, so it's also surjective. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm that. The Rank-Nullity Theorem says that dim(V) = dim(Im(T)) + dim(Kernel(T)). If T is injective, then the kernel only contains the zero vector, so dim(Kernel(T)) is 0. Therefore, dim(Im(T)) = dim(V), which means Im(T) = V, so T is surjective. Therefore, T is bijective.

So Statement 2 is definitely True.

So both statements are True. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Neither, Neither

B: Neither, False

C: True, False

D: False, True

E: True, True but not always

F: Neither, True

G: True, Neither

H: False, Neither

I: False, False

J: True, True

So since both statements are True, the correct option would be J: True, True.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check Statement 1 again because I might have messed up.

Statement 1 says dim(V) < dim(W) <1. So dim(W) must be 0. Then dim(V) < 0, which is impossible because dimensions can't be negative. So the premise is impossible. So the implication is vacuously true. So Statement 1 is True.

So yes, both are True, so the answer is J.

Statement 1: If \( T: V \to W \) is a linear transformation and \( \dim(V) < \dim(W) < 1 \), then \( T \) must be injective.

- Dimensions of vector spaces are non-negative integers. If \( \dim(W) < 1 \), then \( \dim(W) = 0 \), meaning \( W \) is the trivial vector space containing only the zero vector. For \( T \) to be injective, each vector in \( V \) must map to a distinct vector in \( W \). However, if \( W \) is trivial, every vector in \( V \) maps to the zero vector in \( W \), which is not injective unless \( V \) is also trivial. 
- The condition \( \dim(V) < \dim(W) \) becomes \( \dim(V) < 0 \), which is impossible since dimensions are non-negative. Thus, the premise of the statement is impossible, making the implication vacuously true. Therefore, **Statement 1 is True**.

Statement 2: Let \( \dim(V) = n \) and suppose \( T: V \to V \) is linear. If \( T \) is injective, then it is a bijection.

- For finite-dimensional vector spaces, if \( T \) is injective, the Rank-Nullity Theorem implies that \( \dim(V) = \dim(\text{Im}(T)) + \dim(\text{Kernel}(T)) \). Since \( T \) is injective, \( \dim(\text{Kernel}(T)) = 0 \), so \( \dim(\text{Im}(T)) = \dim(V) \). This means \( \text{Im}(T) = V \), making \( T \) surjective as well. Hence, \( T \) is bijective.
- Therefore, **Statement 2 is True**.

Both statements are true, so the correct answer is:

**J: True, True**
