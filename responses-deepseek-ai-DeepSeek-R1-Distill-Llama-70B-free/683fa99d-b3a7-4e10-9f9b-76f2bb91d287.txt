Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the wavelength of a 10-eV electron. Hmm, I remember that electrons have wave-like properties, right? Oh wait, that's from quantum mechanics. So the question is asking about the wavelength corresponding to an electron with 10 eV of energy. 

I think the formula I need here is the de Broglie wavelength equation. De Broglie's equation relates the wavelength of a particle to its momentum. The formula is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle. 

Wait, but how do I find the momentum when I have the energy? Oh right, the kinetic energy (KE) of the electron is given, and I can relate KE to momentum. The kinetic energy for a non-relativistic particle is (p^2)/(2m), where m is the mass. So maybe I should solve for p in terms of KE.

Let me write that down. KE = p²/(2m), so rearranging gives p = sqrt(2m*KE). But wait, what units are we using here? The energy is given in electron volts, and I need to convert that to joules because the standard unit for Planck's constant is in J·s.

Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 10 eV would be 10 times that, which is 1.602e-18 J.

Now, the mass of an electron is approximately 9.109 x 10^-31 kg. Plugging those into the equation for p: p = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-18 J). Let me calculate that.

First, multiply 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30. Then multiply by 1.602e-18: 1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-18 = approximately 2.9207e-48 kg²·m²/s². Taking the square root gives p ≈ sqrt(2.9207e-48) ≈ 5.406e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So lambda = h / p = 6.626e-34 / 5.406e-24. Let's compute that. Dividing 6.626e-34 by 5.406e-24 gives roughly 1.226e-10 meters. 

Wait, wait a second. 1e-10 meters is 0.1 nanometers, but wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 1.226e-10 m is 1.226 Angstroms. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly 1.226. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: 2.5 Å
B: 3.86 Å
C:4.5
D:1.5
E:1.24
F:3.5
G:4.0
H:3.9
I:2.8
J:5.0

So option E is 1.24 Å, which is very close to what I calculated. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Sometimes, for electrons, people use a shortcut formula when the energy is in eV and the wavelength is in Angstroms. I think the shortcut formula is lambda (in Å) ≈ sqrt(150 / E), where E is in eV. Let me try that.

So E is 10 eV. So 150 divided by 10 is 15. The square root of 15 is approximately 3.872 Å. Oh wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Which one is correct?

Wait a minute, maybe I messed up the initial approach. Because I think the non-relativistic calculation is applicable when the electron's speed is much less than the speed of light. For 10 eV electrons, their speed is non-relativistic, so the initial method should hold. But why the discrepancy here?

Alternatively, perhaps the shortcut formula is an approximation that includes some constants. Let me think about where that formula comes from. The de Broglie wavelength formula with KE in eV.

Another approach: Let's write down all the steps with proper unit conversions.

The de Broglie wavelength is lambda = h / p.

But p can be found from KE = (p²)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2m KE).

But KE is in eV, so I need to convert it to joules. 

So KE = 10 eV = 10 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-18 J.

Mass m = 9.109e-31 kg.

So p = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-18 J) = sqrt(2.9195e-48 kg²·m²/s²) = 5.406e-24 kg·m/s.

Then, h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So lambda = 6.626e-34 / 5.406e-24 ≈ 1.226e-10 meters, which is 1.226 Å. So that's answer E.

But wait, earlier I thought the shortcut formula gives 3.87 Å. Which one is right? Oh wait, the shortcut formula must be using a different value or perhaps it's applicable under different conditions. Let me see.

The shortcut formula: lambda (Å) = sqrt(150 / E(eV)).

For E=10, it's sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87 Å. But that's conflicting with the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the shortcut formula is derived using a different value for Planck's constant or the mass. Let me rederive the shortcut.

Let me try to express lambda in terms of E in eV.

We have lambda = h / p.

And p = sqrt(2mE), but E needs to be in joules.

So let's express E as E = E_eV * e, where e is the elementary charge (1.602e-19 C).

So p = sqrt(2m E_eV e).

Substituting into lambda:

lambda = h / (sqrt(2m E_eV e)) )

Squaring both sides:

lambda^2 = h^2 / (2m E_eV e)

Rearranging:

lambda = h / sqrt(2 m e E_eV )

But we can plug in the numbers to get lambda in meters, then convert to Angstroms.

Alternatively, let's compute the numerical factor.

Compute h^2/(2 m e):

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
m = 9.109e-31 kg
e = 1.602e-19 C

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

2 m e = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-19 C ≈ 2.919e-49 kg·C.

So h²/(2me) = 4.39e-67 / 2.919e-49 = approx 1.504e-18 J·s²/(kg·C).

Wait, but I'm not sure I'm getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to plug in the numbers into the formula.

Wait, another approach: let me convert the energy to joules as I did before. But perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recompute p.

KE = 10 eV = 10 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-18 J.

p = sqrt(2 * m * KE) = sqrt( 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-18 J )

Compute 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

Multiply by 1.602e-18: 1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-18 = (1.8218 * 1.602) * 1e-48 = approx 2.9207e-48.

Square root of 2.9207e-48 is sqrt(2.9207) * 1e-24. sqrt(2.9207) is about 1.709, so p ≈ 1.709e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, earlier I had 5.4e-24. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait 2.9207e-48 under the square root is (2.9207e-48)^(1/2) = sqrt(2.9207) * 1e-24. Because (1e-48)^(1/2) is 1e-24.

Wait, sqrt(2.9207) is about 1.709, so p is 1.709e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of p. Let me recalculate p correctly.

Wait, 2mKE = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-18 J.

So 2*9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

Multiply by 1.602e-18: (1.8218e-30) * (1.602e-18) = 

Multiply 1.8218 * 1.602 = approx 2.9207.

And 1e-30 * 1e-18 = 1e-48.

So 2mKE = 2.9207e-48 kg·m²/s².

So p = sqrt(2.9207e-48) = sqrt(2.9207) * 1e-24.

Which is approx 1.7098e-24 kg·m/s.

Then, h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So lambda = h / p = (6.626e-34) / (1.7098e-24) ≈ 3.876e-10 meters.

Wait, that's 3.876 Angstroms. So that's about 3.88 Å, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I got 1.226e-10 m, which is 1.226 Å. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, I think I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let me recheck the p calculation.

Wait, 2mKE is 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-18 J.

2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

Multiply by 1.602e-18 J: 1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-18 = (1.8218 * 1.602) * 1e-48.

1.8218 * 1.602 is approximately 2.9207.

So 2mKE = 2.9207e-48 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so kg·J is kg²·m²/s².

So p^2 is 2.9207e-48 kg²·m²/s².

Thus, p = sqrt(2.9207e-48) kg·m/s.

Which is sqrt(2.9207) * 1e-24 kg·m/s.

sqrt(2.9207) is about 1.7098, so p ≈ 1.7098e-24 kg·m/s.

Then, lambda is h/p = 6.626e-34 / 1.7098e-24.

Compute that: 6.626e-34 / 1.7098e-24 = (6.626 / 1.7098) * 1e-10.

6.626 / 1.7098 is approximately 3.876.

So lambda ≈ 3.876e-10 m, which is 3.876 Angstroms. 

Looking back at the options, option B is 3.86 Å, which matches this result.

Wait, but earlier, when I did the first calculation, I had 5.4e-24 for p, which led to lambda of ~1.226 Å. So where did I go wrong there?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating p. Let's see.

Wait, in the first calculation, I wrote p as 5.406e-24, but that must be wrong because 1.7098e-24 is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B, 3.86 Å. But wait, why did I get a different result when I used the shortcut formula?

Wait, the shortcut formula gives lambda ≈ sqrt(150/E) Å.

So for E=10 eV, lambda = sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872 Å, which matches the 3.876 from the detailed calculation.

So that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option B:3.86 Å.

But wait, what about relativistic effects? At 10 eV, the electron's speed is non-relativistic, so the calculation should be accurate. So the earlier lambda of ~3.86 Å is correct, which is option B.

So I think I made a mistake in my first calculation, perhaps miscalculating p. The correct answer should be option B.

To determine the wavelength of a 10-eV electron, we use the de Broglie wavelength formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( p \) is the momentum of the electron. The momentum can be derived from the kinetic energy (\( KE \)) using the relationship:

\[
p = \sqrt{2m \cdot KE}
\]

Here, \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)) and \( KE \) is the kinetic energy in joules. Since the energy is given in electron volts (eV), we convert it to joules using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). For \( KE = 10 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
KE = 10 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 1.602 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Substituting into the formula for \( p \):

\[
p = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-18}}.
\]

First, calculate \( 2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} = 1.8218 \times 10^{-30} \). Then multiply by \( 1.602 \times 10^{-18} \):

\[
1.8218 \times 10^{-30} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-18} = 2.9207 \times 10^{-48}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{2.9207 \times 10^{-48}} = 1.7098 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Now, calculate the wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.7098 \times 10^{-24}}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\lambda = 3.876 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 3.876 \, \text{Å}.
\]

This result matches the shortcut formula for electron wavelengths:

\[
\lambda \, (\text{Å}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{150}{E \, (\text{eV})}}.
\]

For \( E = 10 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\lambda \approx \sqrt{\frac{150}{10}} = \sqrt{15} \approx 3.87 \, \text{Å}.
\]

Thus, the wavelength of the 10-eV electron is approximately \( 3.86 \, \text{Å} \), which corresponds to **option B**.
