Question:

A defendant, a nurse at a nursing home, is charged with murdering a resident at the home by adding an allegedly lethal substance to the resident's food. At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?

Options:

A: Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.
B: Yes, because the treatise is a public document and therefore exempt from the hearsay rule.
C: No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.
D: Yes, because the prosecutor is allowed to introduce evidence without calling witnesses.
E: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.
F: Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.
G: Yes, because the prosecution is merely providing evidence that supports their claim.
H: No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.
I: No, because the substance's lethal nature is not relevant to the case.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant, a nurse, who's charged with murder. The prosecutor wants to introduce excerpts from a standard medical treatise to show that the substance added to the food could cause death. They didn't call any witnesses first; they just offered to read these pages into evidence.

I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the treatise is a statement by someone else (the author) that's being used to show the substance is lethal. That sounds like hearsay.

But wait, there's an exception for learned treatises. Right, under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(17), learned treatises are admissible if they're called to the attention of the expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert during testimony, and they're established as reliable authority. Oh, but here the prosecutor is just reading them without an expert on the stand. 

So, the key here is that the treatise can't be admitted on its own without being tied to expert testimony. The exception requires that the treatise be used in connection with an expert's testimony, either during direct or cross-examination. If the prosecutor hasn't called an expert and just tries to read the treatise, it's hearsay and not exempt under the learned treatise exception.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the treatise excerpts are hearsay and don't qualify for an exception. If the treatise isn't introduced via an expert, then E might be correct. 

Option F says yes under the learned treatise exception. But I think F is incorrect because the exception requires the treatise to be used with an expert. Since the prosecutor didn't call any witnesses, F isn't applicable.

Option H says no because the excerpts weren't offered during a qualified expert's examination. That seems right because the treatise needs to be connected to an expert's testimony.

Wait, but let me make sure. The learned treatise exception is an exception to the hearsay rule, so without it, the treatise is inadmissible. Since the prosecutor isn't using an expert, the exception doesn't apply. So the evidence is hearsay and inadmissible.

So the correct answer should be E or H. Let me see the options again.

Option E: No, because they're hearsay and no exception. Option H: No because not offered during expert's examination.

Which one is correct? Because the treatise is hearsay, and the learned treatise exception (which would make it admissible) requires that it's used in connection with an expert. So without that, the hearsay isn't exempt. So the reason is both: because it's hearsay and the exception isn't met.

Looking at the options, E and H both say No. But which reason is correct?

The question is whether the evidence is admissible. If it's hearsay and no exception applies, then it's inadmissible. The reason in E is that it's hearsay without exception. The reason in H is about not being offered during expert's examination.

Wait, but the learned treatise exception under 803(17) says that the treatise must be called to the attention of the expert witness or relied upon by the expert. So if the prosecutor just reads the treatise without an expert, then it doesn't qualify under the exception. So the correct reason is that the treatise excerpts are hearsay and don't meet the exception. So E would be correct. Alternatively, if H is the reason, that it's not presented through an expert, then H is correct.

Wait, the question is asking whether the evidence is admissible. So, without the treatise being tied to an expert, it's inadmissible as hearsay. So the reason is that it's hearsay and doesn't qualify for the learned treatise exception.

Looking back at the options, option E says the treatise is hearsay and doesn't qualify for an exception. Option F says yes under the learned treatise exception, but that's not applicable here because the exception requires the treatise to be used with an expert.

So the correct answer is E? Or is it H?

Wait, another approach: The learned treatise exception doesn't require that the treatise be introduced as an exhibit, but it must be used in connection with expert testimony. So in this scenario, the prosecutor isn't presenting any expert. So the treatise can't come in under 803(17). Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible because it's hearsay without an applicable exception.

So the answer would be E: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.

Alternatively, H says it's because the excerpts weren't offered during the examination of a qualified expert. That's also correct, but perhaps the broader reasoning is E.

Wait, the options are E and H. Let me read the rule again:

Federal Rule of Evidence 803(17): "Statements... in treatises... can be read into evidence by any party, whether or not relied upon by the expert... but only if the treatise is called to the attention of the expert upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert... and is established as a reliable authority."

Wait, no, I might be misremembering. Actually, the treatise itself isn't admissible as substantive evidence unless it's used in conjunction with an expert. Wait, no, that's not correct. The rule allows the treatise to be read into evidence by any party if it's a reliable authority, but without an expert, can it be admitted?

Wait, I might have confused this. Let me clarify: Under FRE 803(17), learned treatises are an exception to the hearsay rule. They can be admitted substantively if they are called to the attention of the expert witness on cross-examination or if they are relied upon by the expert during direct examination. So the treatise can be admitted as evidence even if it's not introduced through an expert, but only if it's a reliable authority. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no. The way it works is that the treatise can be used by an expert to refresh their memory or to support their opinion. When that happens, the contents can be read into evidence. But if the party wants to admit the treatise itself as substantive evidence, they have to do so through the expert. Alternatively, the treatise can be admitted substantively without an expert if it's a reliable authority, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: The learned treatise exception allows the treatise to be used as substantive evidence, meaning the jury can consider it as true, but only if it's first identified as a reliable authority. However, typically, the treatise is introduced through an expert witness. So if the prosecutor is trying to read the treatise into evidence without any expert testimony, then it's inadmissible because the exception requires the treatise to be used in conjunction with an expert's testimony.

So in this case, since the prosecutor isn't calling an expert, the treatise can't be admitted. Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible because it's hearsay and doesn't qualify for the learned treatise exception since there's no expert testimony involved.

So looking at the options, option E says the treatise is hearsay and doesn't qualify for an exception. Option H says it's not admissible because it wasn't offered during an expert's examination.

Wait, but the learned treatise exception doesn't require the treatise to be offered during an expert's testimony. It can be admitted as substantive evidence if it's a reliable authority, but I think the rule is that the treatise can be admitted without an expert, as long as it's established as a reliable authority. So perhaps the answer is F, because it's admissible under the learned treatise exception.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the rule again.

FRE 803(17): 

"Statement. - A statement in a treatise, periodical, book, or other publication is admissible as evidence of a reliable authority if the statement is:

(a) on a subject of science, technology, or art;

(b) made for the purpose of explaining the underlying principles, theoriess, or techniques; and

(c) not excluded under Rule 403. The scope of the subject, the author's qualifications, the methodology or theory, the degree of acceptance, and coverage in other authoritative publications are relevant factors in determining reliability."

Moreover, the note to the rule states that the treatise can be read into evidence but the court must determine reliability.

Wait, but the rule says that the treatise is admissible as evidence of a reliable authority. So, perhaps the treatise can be admitted substantively without an expert, provided it's a reliable authority. So in that case, the fact that the prosecutor is reading it without a witness could be permissible.

Wait, but I thought that the treatise was only admissible in connection with expert testimony. But according to FRE 803(17), it's an exception to the hearsay rule, so the treatise can be admitted without an expert, as long as it's a reliable authority. So in that case, the answer would be F: Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception.

But wait, in practice, I think that the treatise is usually introduced through an expert, but the rule doesn't require it. So perhaps the prosecutor can read the treatise into evidence without calling an expert, provided it's a standard and reliable treatise.

So in that case, option F would be correct. But earlier I thought it wasn't allowed without an expert. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think that the treatise can be admitted without an expert because it's a hearsay exception under 803(17). So the answer would be F.

Wait, but the question says the prosecutor offers to read several pages from the treatise. So, is that allowed? Because the rule allows the content to be read into evidence if it's a reliable authority.

So perhaps the correct answer is F: Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception.

But wait, let me think again. I've heard that in some jurisdictions, the treatise must be introduced through an expert, but under the federal rule, it's not necessary. So perhaps the treatise can be admitted without an expert.

So the answer would be F. Therefore, the evidence is admissible under the learned treatise exception.

Wait, but let me make sure. For example, in the Federal Rules, the treatise is admissible as substantive evidence if it's a reliable authority. So the prosecutor can read it into evidence without calling an expert. So option F is correct.

But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes the treatise is used to impeach an expert, but in this case, the prosecutor is using it to prove a fact.

So, after reevaluating, I think the correct answer is F: Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception.

The question revolves around the admissibility of excerpts from a standard medical treatise that the prosecutor seeks to read into evidence to prove the lethal nature of a substance. The key issue is whether this evidence qualifies under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(17), learned treatises are admissible as substantive evidence if they are established as reliable authorities on subjects like science, technology, or art. The rule does not explicitly require the treatise to be introduced through an expert witness, though it is commonly associated with expert testimony. The treatise itself can be admitted if it meets the criteria for reliability, such as being a standard and authoritative work in its field.

In this scenario, the prosecutor is offering the treatise excerpts directly, without calling an expert witness. While the treatise is hearsay, it qualifies under the learned treatise exception if it is a reliable authority. The fact that the prosecutor is reading the excerpts does not preclude their admissibility, as the rule allows for the treatise to be read into evidence as long as it is reliable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The relevance of the substance's lethal nature to the defendant's intent does not address the hearsay issue.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The treatise is not exempt from the hearsay rule simply because it is a public document.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The treatise does not need to be introduced as an exhibit to be admissible.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The admissibility of evidence does not depend on whether witnesses are called.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the treatise is hearsay, it qualifies for the learned treatise exception.
- **Option F**: Correct. The treatise is admissible under the learned treatise exception, even though it is hearsay.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. This option is too vague and does not address the hearsay issue.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The treatise does not need to be offered during the examination of an expert to be admissible.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The lethal nature of the substance is clearly relevant to the case.

Thus, the treatise excerpts are admissible under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule, as they are a reliable authority on the subject.
