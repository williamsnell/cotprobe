Question:

A widow owned an apartment building. Several years ago, a student, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the widow. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that

Options:

A: the student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years.
B: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.
C: the student had made improvements to the property, thus extending the leasehold.
D: the student had a verbal agreement with the widow to extend the lease.
E: the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.
F: the widow had accepted rent for the following month before the three-year period ended.
G: the student was protected from eviction due to his status as a student.
H: the widow had not clearly communicated the end of the lease term.
I: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.
J: the leasehold contract was void ab initio.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about landlord-tenant law, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

So, there's a widow who owns an apartment building. A student entered into a three-year lease agreement with her. They both signed a written lease. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment. The three-year term has expired, but the student kept paying rent, and the widow accepted it. Now, the question is, if the widow decides to evict the student right after the three-year period ends and before she accepts the next rent check, what's the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction?

The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let's break this down. The lease was for three years, and it's expired. After the lease ended, the student stayed and kept paying rent, and the widow accepted it. So, what happens when a lease ends, and the tenant continues to stay with the landlord's consent?

From what I remember, when a lease for a specific term ends and the tenant continues to occupy the property with the landlord's consent, the tenancy becomes a periodic tenancy. The type of periodic tenancy (like month-to-month or year-to-year) depends on how the rent is paid and the circumstances.

In this case, the rent is monthly, so after the three-year lease, it likely becomes a month-to-month tenancy. Now, the key point is that the landlord can terminate a periodic tenancy by giving proper notice. If the landlord doesn't give notice and just accepts rent after the lease term, it could be seen as continuing the tenancy.

But wait, the question says the widow wanted to evict immediately upon the end of the three-year period, before accepting the next rent check. So, she's trying to evict right at the end of the lease without giving notice for termination of a periodic tenancy.

So, the student's argument would be that the widow didn't follow the proper procedure to terminate the periodic tenancy. Let me look at the options.

Option I says: the widow hadn't given requisite notice for terminating a periodic tenancy. That sounds right because, in a month-to-month tenancy, the landlord needs to provide notice (like 30 days in many places) before terminating.

Option B says the widow didn't give notice for terminating a term of years. But the term ended naturally, so notice isn't needed for that. The lease was up, but the tenancy continued as periodic.

Option F says the widow accepted rent before the three-year period ended. If she accepted rent after the lease ended, that could create a new periodic tenancy, but the question states she's evicting before accepting the next check. So F might not apply here.

Option D is about a verbal agreement. There's no mention of that in the facts, so D is probably not the strongest argument.

Option E says the terms were binding, but the lease term was up, so unless there's another agreement, E isn't the right approach.

So, the correct answer should be I, right? Because the widow didn't give notice to end the periodic tenancy that arose after the lease expired.

The correct answer is I. After the three-year lease ended, the student's continued payment of rent, accepted by the widow, created a month-to-month periodic tenancy. To terminate such a tenancy, the landlord must provide proper notice. Since the widow attempted to evict the student without giving the requisite notice, the student's strongest argument is that the widow failed to provide the necessary notice for terminating a periodic tenancy.

I
