Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about psychological procedures. The question is asking about a procedure where a stimulus is repeatedly presented to reduce its attractiveness. Hmm, I need to figure out which term fits this description.

Let me go through the options one by one. 

Option A is implosion. From what I remember, implosion is a technique where the client is exposed to their fear in a very intense way, but I think it's more about imagining the worst-case scenario rather than repeated presentation. So maybe not this one.

Option B is systematic desensitization. I recall this is a method used to treat phobias. It involves gradually exposing the client to the feared stimulus, starting from low anxiety situations. It doesn't sound like it's about repeated exposure to reduce attractiveness, though. It's more about reducing anxiety through gradual exposure.

Option C is aversion therapy. Aversion therapy pairs an unwanted behavior with an unpleasant stimulus to reduce the behavior. For example, using a foul taste to stop nail biting. But the question is about reducing attractiveness through repetition, which doesn't quite fit aversion therapy's method.

Option D is stimulus satiation. I'm not too familiar with this term, but the word 'satiation' makes me think of something being overdone until it's less appealing. So if you present a stimulus repeatedly, the client might get tired of it, reducing its appeal. This sounds like a possible match.

Option E is exposure therapy. Exposure therapy involves confronting the feared object or situation to reduce anxiety. It's similar to systematic desensitization but maybe more direct. But again, it's about reducing fear, not specifically about attractiveness through repetition.

Option F is counterconditioning. This involves replacing an unwanted response with a more desirable one. Like pairing something unpleasant with something pleasant. Doesn't directly relate to repeated exposure reducing attractiveness.

Option G is response-prevention. I think this is used in the context of OCD, where after exposure to a trigger, the person is prevented from performing their usual compulsive response. Not about reducing attractiveness via repetition.

Option H is extinction. Extinction in psychology refers to the process of eliminating a conditioned response by withholding the unconditioned stimulus. For example, if a bell rings without presenting food, salivation stops. But extinction is more about stopping a response, not necessarily about attractiveness.

Option I is habituation. Habituation is when a response decreases because of repeated presentation of a stimulus. Like how you stop noticing a clock's ticking after a while. So if you present a stimulus repeatedly, the client would become less responsive to it. This seems related to reducing attractiveness because the stimulus isn't as appealing anymore.

Option J is flooding. Flooding is an intense form of exposure therapy where the client is exposed to the feared stimulus all at once until the anxiety reduces. It's about overwhelming the client to reduce the fear response, not about attractiveness through repetition.

Wait, so the question is about reducing attractiveness. So maybe habituation (I) is about making the stimulus less noticeable or less strong in its effect, which could include attractiveness. Alternatively, stimulus satiation (D) is about overexposure leading to a decrease in appeal.

I'm a bit confused between D and I. Let me think again. Habituation is a broader concept where any response (like fear, interest) diminishes with repeated exposure. Satiation, on the other hand, is more specific to decreasing attractiveness or preference because of overexposure. So if the procedure's goal is to reduce how attractive the stimulus is, satiation (D) would be the specific term for that.

So the correct answer should be D: stimulus satiation.

The question asks about a procedure involving repeated presentation of a stimulus to reduce its attractiveness. After analyzing the options:

- **A: Implosion** involves intense exposure to feared scenarios, not repetition to reduce attractiveness.
- **B: Systematic desensitization** uses gradual exposure to reduce anxiety, not specifically about attractiveness.
- **C: Aversion therapy** pairs stimuli to reduce unwanted behaviors, unrelated to attractiveness reduction through repetition.
- **D: Stimulus satiation** refers to overexposure leading to decreased appeal, fitting the description.
- **E: Exposure therapy** focuses on reducing fear, not attractiveness through repetition.
- **F: Counterconditioning** replaces responses, not related to reducing attractiveness.
- **G: Response-prevention** prevents compulsive behaviors, not about attractiveness.
- **H: Extinction** stops conditioned responses, not about reducing attractiveness.
- **I: Habituation** reduces responses through repetition but is broader than attractiveness reduction.
- **J: Flooding** involves intense exposure to reduce anxiety, not attractiveness.

The best fit is **D: stimulus satiation**, as it specifically describes reducing attractiveness through repeated exposure.

Answer: D
