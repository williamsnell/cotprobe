Okay, so I've got this question about a Fabry-Perot interferometer and He-Ne laser mode structure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that the interferometer is being used to resolve the mode structure of a He-Ne laser at 6328 Å. The frequency separation between the modes is 150 MHz. We need to find the plate spacing required for two cases: when the mirror reflectance R is 0.9 and 0.999.

Wait, what do I remember about Fabry-Perot interferometers? Oh right, they're used for high-resolution spectroscopy because they can measure very small wavelength differences. The interferometer consists of two mirrors placed parallel to each other, and the spacing between them affects the resolution.

The key thing here is the mode structure of the laser. The laser emits in a series of modes with specific frequency separations. The interferometer needs to resolve these modes, which means its resolution must be good enough to distinguish between adjacent modes.

I think the formula I need is the one that relates the frequency separation (Δf) to the plate spacing (d) of the Fabry-Perot. The finesse of the interferometer also comes into play. Oh right, the finesse (F) depends on the reflectance R of the mirrors.

Wait, what's the formula again? I think the finesse F is approximately (1 + sqrt(R)) / (1 - sqrt(R)) for high-reflectivity mirrors. Or was it something else... Oh wait, no, maybe Finesse is F = π sqrt(R) / (1 - R), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the resolution (Δλ) of the Fabry-Perot is related to the wavelength and the finesse. And the free spectral range (FSR) is the frequency range after which the interference pattern repeats.

Wait, let's get this straight. The free spectral range (FSR) of the Fabry-Perot is the frequency difference between two successive transmitted (or reflected) maxima. The FSR is given by c/(2d), where c is the speed of light and d is the spacing between the mirrors. But I'm not sure if it's c/(2d) or c/(d), or something else. Oh wait, no, wait, another thought: the FSR is the inverse of the time it takes for light to make a round trip in the cavity. So for a round trip, the light travels 2d, so the time is 2d/c. The frequency would be 1 over that time, so the FSR is c/(2d). So FSR = c/(2d). So then, the spacing d can be found by d = c/(2 FSR).

But wait, in this question, the frequency separation between the modes is 150 MHz. So does that mean that the FSR of the Fabry-Perot needs to be at least twice this, or just equal to it, or something else? Wait, no. The Fabry-Perot's FSR is the range of frequencies it can measure without overlapping. So if the laser has modes at 150 MHz apart, the FSR must be larger than that so that each mode is within the FSR and can be resolved.

Wait, but I think the question is asking about the resolving power. The Fabry-Perot should be able to resolve the modes, so maybe the FSR must be greater than the mode spacing. Or maybe the finesse affects the resolution. Oh right, the finesse determines the width of each peak in the interferometer's transmission. So the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is FSR divided by the finesse F. So FWHM = FSR / F.

To resolve two adjacent modes separated by Δf, the FWHM must be less than Δf. So, FWHM < Δf. Which gives FSR/F < Δf. Since FSR is c/(2d), substituting that in:

(c/(2d)) / F < Δf.

Wait, but wait: FSR is the frequency range between successive peaks. So the distance between adjacent maxima is FSR. So if the frequency separation between the modes is Δf, then the interferometer must be able to distinguish them. So the condition is that the FWHM is less than Δf.

So FWHM = FSR / F. So FSR is c/(2d), so FWHM = (c/(2d))/F < Δf.

Rearranging, (c/(2d)) / F < Δf → d > c/(2 Δf F).

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. The wavelength of the laser is 6328 Angstroms, which is 6328e-10 meters or 632.8 nm. But maybe we don't need the wavelength directly because the frequency separation is given. Hmm.

Wait, the frequency of the laser can be calculated from the wavelength. The relation is c = λ f → f = c / λ. But wait, the modes are separated by 150 MHz. So the frequency is in the hundreds of THz. For 6328 Å, which is 632.8 nm, the frequency is c/(632.8e-9 m) → approx 3e8 / 6.328e-7 = roughly 474 THz. But the modes are 150 MHz apart, which is much smaller than the carrier frequency. So the FSR needs to be bigger than the mode spacing.

Wait, no. Wait, the FSR is the range between consecutive transmission peaks. So for the Fabry-Perot to resolve the modes, the FSR must be larger than the mode spacing, right? Or wait, perhaps the FSR should be larger than the mode spacing, so that you can fit multiple modes within the FSR, and each can be resolved if the finesse is high enough.

Alternatively, maybe the FSR must be equal to the mode spacing. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think carefully.

The He-Ne laser's mode structure has modes separated by a certain frequency. The Fabry-Perot's FSR determines how much frequency range you can observe without the pattern repeating. The finesse F determines how narrow each peak is. So to resolve adjacent modes, the distance between them (Δf) must be larger than the width of each peak (FWHM).

So FWHM = FSR / F. So FSR is the spacing between peaks, and FWHM is the width of each peak. For the Fabry-Perot to resolve two modes separated by Δf, the FWHM should be less than Δf. So FSR/F < Δf.

Wait, but FSR is c/(2d), as I thought earlier. So substituting:

(c/(2d)) / F < Δf → d > c/(2 F Δf).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

The condition is FWHM < Δf. And FWHM is FSR/F. So (FSR)/F < Δf → FSR < F Δf.

But FSR is c/(2d) → c/(2d) < F Δf → d > c/(2 F Δf).

So d must be greater than c/(2 F Δf). Hmm.

Now, what's the finesse F in terms of the mirror reflectance R?

I think the formula for finesse when the mirrors have reflectance R is F = (π sqrt(R)) / (1 - R). Or wait, another approach: the finesse is approximately F ≈ (4 R) / (1 - R)^2 when R is close to 1. Wait, no, another formula comes to mind. I think the finesse is given by F = π R^(1/2) / (1 - R) when R is high. So when R approaches 1, the denominator becomes small, making F large.

Wait, let me confirm. For a Fabry-Perot etalon, the finesse is given by F = π sqrt(R) / (1 - R) for each surface's reflectance R. So for R = 0.9, sqrt(R) is sqrt(0.9) ≈ 0.9487. So F ≈ π * 0.9487 / (1 - 0.9) → π * 0.9487 / 0.1 → approximately 29.8. So about 30.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's compute that more accurately. For R = 0.9 → sqrt(R)=~0.94868. Then (1 - R) is 0.1. So F = π * 0.94868 / 0.1 = π * 9.4868 ≈ 29.78. So ~30.

For R = 0.999, sqrt(R) is about 0.9995, and (1 - R) = 0.001. So F = π * 0.9995 / 0.001 ≈ π * 999.5 ≈ 3141.6. So about 3142.

So now, for each case, R=0.9 and R=0.999, we can compute F and then find the required d.

Given that, let's plug into the formula d > c/(2 F Δf).

Wait, but since the condition is FWHM < Δf, which leads to d > c/(2 F Δf). So let's compute for each R.

But wait, let's compute the required d in each case.

First, case (a): R=0.9 → F≈30.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

Δf is 150 MHz = 150e6 Hz.

So d > (3e8 m/s) / (2 * 30 * 150e6 Hz ).

Calculate denominator: 2 * 30 =60, 60 * 150e6 =9e9.

So numerator: 3e8 / 9e9 = (3e8)/(9e9) = 1/30 ≈0.03333 meters → 3.333 cm. Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 3 cm for R=0.9.

Wait, no, because I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me think again. Because in the formula, FSR is c/(2d). So when FSR is larger, d is smaller. Wait, but in our condition, we have FSR < F Δf. So c/(2d) < F Δf → d > c/(2 F Δf).

Wait, but according to our calculation, when R=0.9, F=30.

So d > (3e8) / (2 *30 *150e6) → calculate denominator: 2*30=60, 60 *150e6 = 9e9. So 3e8 / 9e9 = 1/30 m → ~0.0333 m → 3.33 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, for part (a), which R=0.9, the options have 3.18 cm in option D, 0.335 cm in C, 3.35 cm in option I, etc.

Wait, but according to this calculation, for R=0.9, d must be greater than 3.33 cm. But looking at the options, option D says 3.18 cm. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use the wavelength. Because perhaps the mode spacing is related to the cavity length, but wait, the question is about the interferometer's plate spacing.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the relation between the mode spacing and the FSR of the laser. Wait, the laser's mode spacing is given as 150 MHz. The laser's own cavity determines that. But the interferometer must resolve this.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the formula for the resolving power of the Fabry-Perot. The resolving power is the ability to distinguish two close frequencies, which is given by the finesse multiplied by the FSR.

Wait, no, resolving power is usually λ/Δλ, but for Fabry-Perot, it's related to F and the FSR. Hmm, perhaps the condition is that the mode separation is equal to the FWHM. So FWHM = Δf. Because if it's smaller, the interferometer can resolve them.

Wait, but if FWHM < Δf, then the modes are just resolvable. So perhaps I should set FWHM = Δf and solve for d.

So FWHM = FSR / F = (c/(2d)) / F.

Set this equal to Δf → (c/(2d F)) = Δf → d = c/(2 F Δf).

So d = c/(2 F Δf).

Ah, that's the formula. So for each R, compute F, then compute d.

So let's do that.

For R=0.9:

F = π sqrt(R)/(1 - R) = π * sqrt(0.9)/(0.1). Compute sqrt(0.9)= approx 0.94868. So F= π * 0.94868 / 0.1 ≈ 29.8, as before.

So d = (3e8 m/s) / (2 * 29.8 * 150e6 Hz)

Compute denominator: 2 *29.8 =59.6, 59.6 *150e6 =8.94e9.

So numerator: 3e8 / 8.94e9 → 3e8 /8.94e9 ≈ 0.03356 meters → 3.356 cm.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option I is 4.24 cm and 0.424 mm. Option D is 3.18 cm and 0.335 mm. Hmm, 3.356 cm is close to 3.35 cm, but option D is 3.18 cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's compute more precisely.

F for R=0.9:

sqrt(0.9)=0.948683298. So F= pi * 0.948683298 / 0.1 → pi * 9.48683298 → approx 29.8.

So denominator: 2 * 29.8 * 150e6 → 59.6 * 150e6 =8.94e9.

d= 3e8 /8.94e9 = (3/8.94) * 1e-1 → 3/8.94 ≈0.3356 → 0.3356 * 0.1 m? Wait wait, no.

Wait, 3e8 / 8.94e9 → 3e8 /8.94e9 = 3/(89.4) → 0.03356 m → 3.356 cm.

So approximately 3.36 cm. Looking at the options, option I has 4.24 cm for part (a), which doesn't match. Option D is 3.18 cm for (a). Hmm, maybe I need to check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, maybe I should have used the wavelength in the formula. Because sometimes, the FSR is expressed in terms of wavelength. Oh wait, another approach: the mode spacing in a laser is given by c/(2L), where L is the laser cavity length. But I don't think that's directly relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Another way: the mode spacing of the laser is 150 MHz. The Fabry-Perot must have a FSR larger than this to resolve the modes, and the finesse determines the resolution.

Wait, another formula: the minimum frequency difference resolvable by the Fabry-Perot is FWHM = FSR / F. So for the modes to be resolved, their separation (Δf=150 MHz) should be greater than FWHM. So 150e6 > FSR/F → FSR < F *150e6 → c/(2d) < F *150e6 → d > c/(2 F *150e6).

Wait, but that's the same as our earlier approach, which gives d> c/(2 F Δf).

So same calculation applies. So for R=0.9, d ≈3.356 cm. But looking at the options, none have 3.356 cm for part (a). Hmm.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option D: (a) 3.18 cm, (b) 0.335 mm. So part (a) is 3.18 cm.

Option I: (a)4.24 cm, (b)0.424 mm.

Option C: (a)0.335 cm, (b)3.18 mm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating F. Let me recheck.

F for R=0.9:

F = π * sqrt(R) / (1 - R) → R=0.9 → sqrt(R)=0.948683.

So F= π * 0.948683 / 0.1 → 0.948683 * π ≈ 2.9845 → 29.845.

So F≈29.845.

So d = c/(2 F Δf) → 3e8 / (2 *29.845 *150e6) → denominator is 2 *29.845=59.69 → 59.69 * 150e6 = 8.9535e9.

3e8 /8.9535e9 → 0.0335 meters → 3.35 cm. So 3.35 cm.

Looking at the options, Option I has 4.24 cm for part (a). Hmm. None of the options say 3.35 cm for part (a). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the correct finesse formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the finesse formula is different. I've heard another formula where F = 4 R/(1-R)^2. But I'm not sure. Let me check.

Wait, no, I think that formula is for something else, like the contrast ratio. Alternatively, the finesse for a Fabry-Perot cavity is given by F = (π * sqrt(R)) / (1 - R), as I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Alternatively, maybe the finesse is defined differently. For example, some sources say F = (2 F')/(1 + F'), where F' is the coefficient of finesse. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the finesse is given by F = (4 R)/( (1 - R)^2 ). Let me test that.

For R=0.9, F = (4 *0.9 )/( (1-0.9)^2 ) → 3.6 / (0.01) → 360. That can't be right because when R is 0.9, F around 30
