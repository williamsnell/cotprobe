Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting problem about the manufacturer and the minimum selling price for the saw. Let me read the question again carefully.

The manufacturer has two types of costs: direct and overhead. Direct costs are $13 per saw, and overhead or indirect costs are $10. He needs to set a minimum price to avoid a short-term loss. The question is asking what price he must sell each saw for.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that to determine the minimum selling price without incurring a loss, you need to cover all the costs. But wait, when considering fixed and variable costs, sometimes only variable costs are considered for certain decisions. But since the question is about not incurring a loss in the short term, I think we need to cover both variable and fixed costs.

Wait, but the question says "direct costs" and "overhead or indirect costs." Direct costs are usually variable costs, like materials and direct labor, which vary with the number of units produced. Overhead or indirect costs, on the other hand, are typically fixed costs, like rent, salaries, etc., which don't change with production volume in the short term.

But wait, the way the question is phrased might be a bit tricky. It says the manufacturer can produce a saw for $13 in direct costs and $10 in overhead. So per unit, direct is $13, and overhead is $10? Or is the overhead a fixed cost per period, not per unit?

Oh wait, the question says "produce a saw" so it's per unit. So each saw costs $13 in direct and $10 in overhead per unit? Or is the $10 a total overhead, not per unit?

No, the question says "$10 in overhead or indirect costs" per saw? That can't be right because usually, overhead is allocated per unit, but maybe in this case, it's given as a per-unit figure. So perhaps the total cost per saw is direct + overhead, which would be $13 + $10 = $23 per saw.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the selling price must be at least equal to the total cost per unit to break even. So the minimum price would be $23 to cover both direct and overhead costs. Otherwise, he would make a loss.

Looking at the options, option F is $23. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, in cost accounting, for pricing decisions, fixed costs are considered sunk and not part of the variable costs. But in this case, the question is about not incurring a short-term loss, which means covering all costs, both variable and fixed. So adding both makes sense.

So the total cost per saw is $13 + $10 = $23. Therefore, the minimum selling price is $23, which is option F.

To determine the minimum price the manufacturer must sell the saw for to avoid a short-term loss, we need to ensure that the selling price covers all costs, both direct and overhead. 

- **Direct costs** are $13 per saw, which are variable costs that vary with the number of units produced.
- **Overhead or indirect costs** are $10 per saw, which are allocated per unit in this context.

Adding these together, the total cost per saw is:
\[
\$13 \, (\text{direct}) + \$10 \, (\text{overhead}) = \$23
\]

To avoid a short-term loss, the selling price must at least equal the total cost per unit. Therefore, the minimum selling price is **\$23**, which corresponds to **option F**.
