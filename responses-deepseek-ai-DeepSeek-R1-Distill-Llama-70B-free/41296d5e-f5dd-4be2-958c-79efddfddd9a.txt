Question:

A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain. She describes the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 9 days, she has had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She does not smoke. Her husband and children have had no recent illness. Her temperature is 38.5째C (101.3째F). Examination shows congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. There is tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. The tympanic membranes are normal, and there is no erythema of the throat. Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?

Options:

A: Escherichia coli
B: Staphylococcus aureus
C: Haemophilus influenzae type b
D: Mycoplasma pneumoniae
E: Neisseria meningitidis
F: Pseudomonas aeruginosa
G: Bordetella pertussis
H: Streptococcus pneumoniae

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a one-day history of throbbing facial pain, rated 7/10. Over the past 9 days, she's had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She doesn't smoke, and her family hasn't been sick recently. Her temp is 38.5째C (101.3째F). On exam, congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. Tenderness over the left cheek, no transillumination of the left maxillary sinus. Normal tympanic membranes, no throat erythema, no cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear.

I think this sounds like sinusitis, specifically maxillary sinusitis. The symptoms point to that: facial pain, purulent discharge, and the physical exam findings like tenderness over the cheek and lack of transillumination (which suggests the sinus is filled with fluid or pus, so light doesn't pass through).

Now, the question is about the causal organism. The options are A-J, but let me list them again: A is E. coli, B is Staph aureus, C is H. influenzae type b, D is Mycoplasma pneumoniae, E is Neisseria meningitidis, F is Pseudomonas, G is Bordetella pertussis, H is Streptococcus pneumoniae.

I remember that acute sinusitis is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. These are the typical community-acquired pathogens.

Looking at the options, H is S. pneumoniae, and C is H. influenzae type b. So which one is more likely here?

The patient's symptoms started 9 days ago, so it's been almost a week and a half. The initial symptoms were more like a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) with congestion, sore throat, cough. But then she developed facial pain, which suggests secondary bacterial sinusitis. Viral URIs often precede bacterial sinusitis, which typically occurs after 7-10 days.

In adults, the most common cause of bacterial sinusitis is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae. Moraxella is another cause but isn't listed here as an option.

So in this case, the likely culprit is either S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Let me think: what differentiates them? H. influenzae can cause infections like otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. But in adults, S. pneumoniae is more common for sinusitis.

Wait, but Haemophilus is also a possibility. I recall that in some cases, especially if the patient doesn't improve with initial treatment, it's H. influenzae or Moraxella.

The patient doesn't smoke and has no other major risk factors mentioned. She's 37, so not particularly elderly, which might make S. pneumoniae more common.

Another thing to consider is the presence of purulent discharge and the duration. Typically, bacterial sinusitis presents after a viral infection, so the history fits.

Alternatively, could it be something else? Let's see the other options.

E. coli is more of a urinary tract pathogen, less likely for sinusitis. Staph aureus can cause sinusitis, but it's more common in chronic cases or after a viral infection, but maybe less likely than S. pneumoniae.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is more known for causing atypical pneumonia, often with a sore throat and other systemic symptoms. It's less likely to cause sinusitis.

Neisseria meningitidis is more associated with meningitis or septicemia, not sinusitis.

Pseudomonas is more in cystic fibrosis patients or immunocompromised, which isn't indicated here.

Bordetella pertussis is for whooping cough, which presents with severe cough, which she has, but the facial pain and sinus findings point more to sinusitis than pertussis.

So narrowing it down, the main options are S. pneumoniae (H) and H. influenzae (C). Between these, I think S. pneumoniae is more likely the cause in an adult with community-acquired sinusitis after a URI.

So the answer should be H: Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman presenting with symptoms consistent with acute bacterial sinusitis, specifically maxillary sinusitis. Her symptoms include facial pain, purulent nasal discharge, and physical exam findings such as tenderness over the left cheek and lack of transillumination of the left maxillary sinus. These findings suggest a bacterial infection following a viral upper respiratory infection (URI), as her initial symptoms of nasal congestion, sore throat, and cough began 9 days prior.

The most common causative organisms in community-acquired bacterial sinusitis are **Streptococcus pneumoniae**, **Haemophilus influenzae**, and **Moraxella catarrhalis**. Among the options provided, **Streptococcus pneumoniae (H)** and **Haemophilus influenzae type b (C)** are the most relevant. 

While both pathogens are possible, **Streptococcus pneumoniae** is the most likely cause in this case. It is the leading cause of bacterial sinusitis in adults, particularly in the absence of specific risk factors or complications. Other options, such as **Staphylococcus aureus**, **Escherichia coli**, **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**, and others, are less likely based on the clinical presentation and typical microbiology of acute sinusitis.

Thus, the most likely causal organism is **Streptococcus pneumoniae**.
