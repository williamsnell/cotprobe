Question:

A woman who was three months pregnant enrolled in a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program at the local gymnasium. The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500?

Options:

A: It would not be excused, because the woman did not negotiate a clause in the contract that would allow for cancellation in the event of a health emergency.
B: It would not be excused, because the woman voluntarily entered into the contract knowing that it was non-refundable.
C: It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.
D: It would not be excused, because the woman's inability to attend the classes does not affect the gymnasium's ability to provide them.
E: It would be excused, because the accident was an unforeseen event that made it impossible for her to continue the classes.
F: It would be excused, because the woman's health conditions changed due to no fault of her own.
G: It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.
H: It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.
I: It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.
J: It would not be excused, as the gymnasium offered services that the woman could no longer use due to personal reasons.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The situation is about a pregnant woman who signed a one-year contract with a gym for prenatal and postnatal exercise classes. The contract says she has to pay $2000 in four installments of $500 each. All fees are non-refundable. She made the first payment and attended classes for three months. Then she got into a car accident, wasn't seriously hurt, but her doctor told her to rest and stop the classes. A week later, the gym sent her a notice that the second payment was overdue. She called them and said she wouldn't attend anymore and didn't feel she had to pay more.

The question is about her duty to pay the second $500 installment. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason why she would or wouldn't have to pay.

So I need to think about the legal principles here. Contracts can be tricky, especially when it comes to situations where someone can't fulfill their obligations. Let's recall some concepts.

First, the contract is for a year, and she's paid one installment. The contract says all fees are non-refundable. So the gym's position is probably that she owes the rest regardless of whether she uses the service.

But she stopped attending because of medical reasons. So what are the possible doctrines that could apply here?

I remember that impossibility of performance and frustration of purpose are two possible defenses when a contract can't be performed. Also, there's the concept of impracticability, but I think that's more about commercial impracticability, like when it becomes much harder or more expensive to perform, not necessarily impossible.

Impossibility of performance would apply if fulfilling the contract becomes impossible due to unforeseen circumstances. But in this case, the service (the classes) are still available; she just can't attend them. So the gym can still provide the classes, even if she can't come. So impossibility might not apply because the gym isn't being asked to do something impossible.

Then there's frustration of purpose. This is when the main purpose of the contract is frustrated by an unforeseen event, making it pointless for one party to continue. The classic example is like renting a space for a parade, and then the parade is canceled. The purpose is frustrated, so the contract can be terminated.

In this case, the purpose of the contract for the woman was to attend prenatal exercise classes. Her doctor's orders make attending impossible, so the purpose is frustrated. But wait, the contract is for a year, including postnatal classes. So after the baby is born, she might be able to attend again. But she was forced to stop at three months, which might be part of the prenatal period.

Alternatively, the fact that the contract includes postnatal classes could mean that the purpose isn't entirely frustrated. But her situation is that she can't attend any more classes, including postnatal ones if she's on bedrest or needs to rest for a longer period.

Wait, but she's three months pregnant, so she has six more months until the baby is born. If she's on complete rest, maybe she can't attend postnatal classes either. So the entire purpose of the contract is defeated.

Another point is that the payments are non-refundable. So the gym is keeping the money regardless. If the woman can't perform because of the doctor's orders, can she still be held to pay?

Looking at the options:

Option A says no excuse because she didn't negotiate a cancellation clause. But that's not a reason in contract law; absence of a clause doesn't necessarily mean she can't be excused if a legal doctrine applies.

Option B says no excuse because she knew it was non-refundable. But non-refundable doesn't automatically mean she can't be excused for non-payment. It depends on whether she's legally obligated despite the non-refundable clause.

Option C says it would be excused because the essential purpose was frustrated. That aligns with the frustration of purpose doctrine. If the main reason she entered the contract is now impossible, this could apply.

Option D says no excuse because the gym can still provide the classes. That's about impossibility from the gym's side, which doesn't apply here.

Option E says excused because the accident was unforeseen. This is more about impossibility, but as I thought earlier, the gym can still provide the service.

Option F says excused because her health changed through no fault of her own. This sounds like frustration of purpose, perhaps, but it's more about the reason for the frustration.

Option G says no excuse because the contract says no refunds. But again, non-refundable doesn't necessarily mean she has to pay if a legal doctrine applies.

Option H says no excuse because her payment is a condition precedent. I'm not sure about this one, but condition precedent usually refers to an event that must occur before an obligation arises. If she's unable to perform, maybe that doesn't apply here.

Option I says excused because of impossibility. But as I thought, the gym can still provide the service, so it's not impossible for her to pay, it's just that she can't use the service. So impossibility might not apply.

Option J says no excuse because she couldn't use the service for personal reasons. That doesn't sound like a strong legal argument.

So, putting it together: The key is whether the purpose of the contract is frustrated. She can't attend the classes because her doctor says she can't, which frustrates the purpose. So the doctrine of frustration of purpose would apply, excusing her obligation to pay the remaining installments.

Looking at the options, option C says it would be excused because the essential purpose was frustrated. Option F also talks about her health changing, but that's more about the reason than the doctrine. So C is the better choice.

Wait, but what about the fact that the contract is for a year, including postnatal? If she can't attend any classes for the rest of the year, then the entire purpose is gone. So that would support option C.

Alternatively, if she could attend postnatal classes after giving birth, maybe the frustration isn't total. But if she's on complete rest for the entire pregnancy and perhaps beyond, maybe she can't attend any. But the question says her doctor told her to discontinue the classes, implying that she can't attend any more. So the entire purpose is frustrated.

So I think option C is correct. Her duty would be excused because the purpose of the contract was frustrated.

The woman's situation involves a contract for prenatal and postnatal exercise classes, with a total fee of $2,000 paid in quarterly installments. After attending classes for three months, she was involved in an automobile accident, and her doctor advised her to discontinue the classes due to the need for complete rest. The gym then demanded the second installment of $500, which she refused to pay, arguing that she should not be obligated to continue payments.

The key issue is whether the woman is excused from paying the second installment. Under contract law, the doctrine of frustration of purpose may apply when an unforeseen event undermines the principal purpose of the contract, making it impossible to fulfill the intended goal. In this case, the woman's inability to attend classes due to medical reasons frustrates the essential purpose of the contract, which was to participate in prenatal and postnatal exercise classes. Since her doctor's orders render the purpose of the contract impossible to achieve, her obligation to pay the remaining installments may be excused.

Option C correctly identifies that the woman's duty to pay would be excused because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated. Other options either misapply legal doctrines or fail to address the specific circumstances of the case.

Answer: C
