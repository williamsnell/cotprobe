Okay, so I've got this problem here about similar polygons. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says polygon ABCDE is similar to polygon PQRST. So, similar polygons have their corresponding sides in proportion. That's the key here. I remember that when two polygons are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant.

Now, let's look at the given information. For polygon ABCDE, we have AB = BC = 8 units each. Then, AE and CD are 4 units each. Also, ED is 6 units. On the other side, for polygon PQRST, QR = QP and RS = PT = 3 units each.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me list out all the sides for each polygon to make it clearer. 

Polygon ABCDE has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA. So, from the given data:
AB = 8
BC = 8
CD = 4
DE = 6
EA = 4

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says AE = CD =4. So AE is 4, CD is 4. So the sides are AB=8, BC=8, CD=4, DE=6, and EA=4. So that's five sides, making it a pentagon.

Similarly, polygon PQRST is also a pentagon, with sides PQ, QR, RS, ST, and TP. The given for PQRST is QR = QP, and RS = PT =3. Hmm, wait. Let me parse that again.

The problem states: QR = QP, and RS = PT = 3. So, for PQRST:

- QR = QP (so two sides are equal)
- RS = PT =3 (so two sides are 3 each)

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the sides correctly. Let me list them:

PQRST: the sides are PQ, QR, RS, ST, and TP.

Given that QR = QP. So QP is the same as QR. Also, RS and PT are both 3. So RS = 3, PT =3.

Wait, QP is a side? Oh, because the polygon is PQRST, so the sides are PQ, QR, RS, ST, and TP. So TP is another side. So in PQRST, sides are PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP.

Given that QR = QP. Wait, QP is the same as PQ? Because in the polygon PQRST, the sides are sequential. So maybe the notation can be tricky here. Let me think: QP is the same as PQ? Because in the polygon, moving from P to Q to R, etc., so PQ is the same side as QP, just direction is different. So maybe QR = PQ.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because QR is the next side after Q, so QR would be from Q to R. Whereas QP would be from Q back to P, but that's the same as PQ in reverse. So perhaps the notation is that QR = QP in length, meaning QR = PQ.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that QR = QP as in the same side, but I think it's more likely that QR and QP are separate sides. Wait, no, the sides are PQ, QR, RS, ST, and TP. So QP isn't a side; the sides are PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP. Wait, but TP is a side. So perhaps the problem intended QR = PQ, and RS = PT =3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the given:

For polygon PQRST:
- QR = QP → So QR equals QP. But QP isn't a side of the polygon. Wait, maybe the sides are PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP. So QP isn't a side; perhaps it's a typo and should be PQ? Or maybe it's referring to another side.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that in polygon PQRST, the side QR is equal in length to QP, but QP isn't a side of the polygon. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and they meant QR = PQ. Because PQ is a side, QR is another. So perhaps QR = PQ.

Similarly, RS = PT =3. So RS is 3, PT is 3. Since PT is a side (the last side, TP), so that would mean TP is 3.

So, putting it all together, for polygon PQRST:

PQ = QR (since QR=QP, and perhaps QP is the same as PQ?), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem means that QR and QP are sides, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the correspondence of the sides between the two polygons. Since ABCDE ~ PQRST, the order of the vertices matters. So each vertex in ABCDE corresponds to a vertex in PQRST in order. So A corresponds to P, B to Q, C to R, D to S, E to T.

Wait, that might be important. So the sides AB in ABCDE correspond to PQ in PQRST. BC corresponds to QR. CD corresponds to RS. DE corresponds to ST. And EA corresponds to TP.

So now, the sides of ABCDE are AB=8, BC=8, CD=4, DE=6, EA=4.

The corresponding sides in PQRST would be PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP. So the ratio of corresponding sides would be consistent across all.

Now, the problem gives us some of the sides in PQRST. Let's list what we know about PQRST:

- QR = QP → Hmm, but QP isn't a side; perhaps it's PQ? If so, then QR = PQ. Let's assume that's correct for now.

- RS = PT = 3. So RS is 3, and PT is 3. But PT is the side from P to T, which is the same as TP (since TP is a side). So TP =3.

So, the sides of PQRST are:

PQ: let's call this 'a'
QR: since QR = QP, and QP is the same as PQ, then QR = PQ = a
RS: 3
ST: let's call this 'b' for now
TP: 3

Wait, but DE corresponds to ST. So DE is 6, and ST is 'b'. So the ratio would be DE/ST = 6/b. But we might not know 'b' yet.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the scale factor between the two polygons first. Since they are similar, the ratio between corresponding sides should be the same.

Looking at the corresponding sides:

AB corresponds to PQ: AB=8, so PQ=?
BC corresponds to QR: BC=8, QR=?
CD corresponds to RS: CD=4, RS=3. So the ratio here is RS/CD = 3/4.

Wait, but if the scale factor is consistent, then all corresponding sides should have the same ratio. So let's check that.

If CD is 4 and RS is 3, then the scale factor from ABCDE to PQRST is 3/4 (since RS is in PQRST, which is the smaller side if 3<4).

Wait, no, actually, the scale factor could be either way depending on which is larger. Wait, ABCDE's CD is 4, and PQRST's RS is 3, so PQRST's RS is smaller. So the scale factor from ABCDE to PQRST would be 3/4.

So then, each side in PQRST is 3/4 of the corresponding side in ABCDE.

Wait, but let me confirm. So the ratio is (PQRST side) / (ABCDE side) = scale factor.

So for RS and CD: RS/CD =3/4. So the scale factor is 3/4.

So now, we can find all the sides of PQRST by multiplying each corresponding side in ABCDE by 3/4.

Wait, but let's check if that's consistent with other given information. Let's take another corresponding pair.

Looking at DE and ST: DE is 6, so ST should be 6*(3/4)=4.5.

Similarly, EA corresponds to TP. EA is 4, so TP should be 4*(3/4) =3. Which matches the given information that TP=3. So that's consistent.

Similarly, AB corresponds to PQ: AB=8, so PQ=8*(3/4)=6.

BC corresponds to QR: BC=8, so QR=8*(3/4)=6.

Wait, but the problem states that QR = QP, which in our case, QR is 6. So QP should also be 6. But wait, QP is the same as PQ, right? Because PQ is the side from P to Q, and QP is the same as PQ in reverse. So if QR=6, then PQ should also be 6, which matches our calculation. So that's consistent.

So, putting it all together, the sides of PQRST are:

PQ =6

QR =6

RS=3

ST=4.5 (since DE=6 → ST=6*(3/4)=4.5)

TP=3

Wait, but earlier I thought ST was 'b' and DE corresponds to ST. So ST is 4.5.

So now, to find the perimeter of PQRST, we sum all its sides.

Perimeter = PQ + QR + RS + ST + TP

Which is 6 +6 +3 +4.5 +3.

Adding those up: 6+6=12; 12+3=15; 15+4.5=19.5; 19.5+3=22.5.

So the perimeter would be 22.5.

Looking at the options, option F is 22.5. So the answer should be F.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by noting that polygons ABCDE and PQRST are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional. The sides of ABCDE are given as AB = 8, BC = 8, CD = 4, DE = 6, and EA = 4. For PQRST, we know QR = QP, RS = PT = 3, and we need to determine the perimeter of PQRST.

### Step 1: Identify the correspondence of sides
Since the polygons are similar, the sides of ABCDE correspond to the sides of PQRST in the following order:
- AB corresponds to PQ
- BC corresponds to QR
- CD corresponds to RS
- DE corresponds to ST
- EA corresponds to TP

### Step 2: Determine the scale factor
The scale factor between the polygons can be calculated using the ratio of corresponding sides. For example:
\[
\text{Scale factor} = \frac{\text{RS}}{\text{CD}} = \frac{3}{4}
\]
This means that each side of PQRST is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the corresponding side in ABCDE.

### Step 3: Calculate the sides of PQRST
Using the scale factor, we calculate the sides of PQRST:
- \(PQ = AB \times \frac{3}{4} = 8 \times \frac{3}{4} = 6\)
- \(QR = BC \times \frac{3}{4} = 8 \times \frac{3}{4} = 6\)
- \(RS = 3\) (given)
- \(ST = DE \times \frac{3}{4} = 6 \times \frac{3}{4} = 4.5\)
- \(TP = EA \times \frac{3}{4} = 4 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3\)

### Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of PQRST
The perimeter of PQRST is the sum of its sides:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = PQ + QR + RS + ST + TP = 6 + 6 + 3 + 4.5 + 3 = 22.5
\]

### Final Answer
The perimeter of polygon PQRST is 22.5, which corresponds to option **F**.
