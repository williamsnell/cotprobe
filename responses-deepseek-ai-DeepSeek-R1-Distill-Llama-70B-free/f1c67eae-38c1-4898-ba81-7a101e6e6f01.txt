Okay, so I've got this optics question here about prisms and their power. Hmm, I remember that prisms are used to bend light, and the amount they bend it is related to something called prism diopters. But wait, what's the exact formula again?

I think the power of a prism is calculated using the refractive index of the material and the angle of the prism. Oh right, the formula is something like Power (in prism diopters) equals (n - 1) multiplied by the tangent of half the refracting angle, right? Or wait, maybe it's just (n - 1) times the angle in degrees? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, prism power is measured in prism diopters, which is a unit of refractive power. The formula I remember is that the power of the prism (in prism diopters) is equal to (n - 1) multiplied by the angle of the prism (in degrees). Because the angle here is the refracting angle, which is the angle between the two faces of the prism.

So the question says the glass prism has a refractive index of 1.5 and a refracting angle of 2 degrees. Plugging into the formula, it's (1.5 - 1) * 2. That would be 0.5 * 2 equals 1 prism diopter. So the answer should be option A, which is 1 prism-diopter.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm trying to recall if the angle is in radians or degrees. Oh, right, in the formula, the angle is in degrees because prism diopters use degrees. So when the formula uses (n-1) * angle (degrees), that gives the prism power. So yeah, 0.5 * 2 degrees is 1. So option A is correct.

The power of a prism in prism-diopters is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Power (prism-diopters)} = (n - 1) \times \text{Refracting Angle (degrees)}
\]

Here, the refractive index \( n \) is 1.5, and the refracting angle is \( 2^\circ \). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{Power} = (1.5 - 1) \times 2 = 0.5 \times 2 = 1 \, \text{prism-diopter}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 1 prism-diopter**.
