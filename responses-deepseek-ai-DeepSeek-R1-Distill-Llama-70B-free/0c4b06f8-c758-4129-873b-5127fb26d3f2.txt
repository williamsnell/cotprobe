Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about bubbles of air escaping from a cylinder of compressed air at the bottom of a pond that's 34 feet deep. As the bubbles rise to the surface, they expand. We're supposed to find out approximately how much they increase in volume, assuming no temperature change.

Hmm, so I remember that when a gas expands, its volume and pressure are related, especially when temperature is constant. Oh wait, that's Boyle's Law! Boyle's Law states that for a given mass of gas at constant temperature, the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure. So, P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.

Right, so the pressure changes as the bubbles rise because the water pressure decreases with depth. At the bottom of the pond, the pressure is higher than at the surface. So I need to calculate the pressure at the bottom and compare it to the pressure at the surface.

Wait, but pressure underwater increases with depth. The formula for pressure underwater is P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of water, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the depth. But wait, also, the pressure at the bottom is the sum of the atmospheric pressure and the pressure from the water column.

Oh right, so the total pressure at the bottom is atmospheric pressure plus ρgh. At the surface, the pressure is just atmospheric.

So, let's denote the pressure at the bottom as P1 and at the surface as P2. Then, P1 = atmospheric pressure (Patm) + ρgh, and P2 = Patm.

But wait, when the bubbles are at the bottom, the pressure inside the cylinder must balance the surrounding pressure, so the air in the cylinder is at pressure P1. As the bubbles rise, they expand because the surrounding pressure decreases.

Wait, but in the cylinder, the air is compressed, so when the bubbles escape, they start at the higher pressure (P1) and expand as they rise. So, the initial volume of the bubble is V1, and when it reaches the surface, it's V2. Since the temperature is constant, we can apply Boyle's Law.

So, according to Boyle's Law, P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. We can rearrange this to find the volume change. So V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1. Therefore, the expansion factor is P1/P2.

But wait, let's make sure I get the pressures right. At the bottom, the pressure is higher, so P1 is greater than P2. So, P1/P2 will be greater than 1, which means the volume increases.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out the actual pressure values. Let's think about the units. The depth h is given in feet, so I might need to use the appropriate units for everything.

I remember that the density of water (ρ) is about 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. The acceleration due to gravity, g, is approximately 32 ft/s². Wait, but pressure in what units? Let's think in terms of pounds per square inch (PSI), perhaps.

So, let's compute the pressure due to the water column. The formula is P = ρgh.

Plugging in the numbers: ρ is 62.4 lb/ft³, g is 32 ft/s², h is 34 ft.

So P = 62.4 * 32 * 34.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, 62.4 multiplied by 32. Let me calculate 62 *32: 60*32=1920, 2*32=64, so 1984. Then 0.4*32=12.8, so total is 1984 +12.8 = 1996.8 lb/ft² (since ρ is lb/ft³, g is ft/s², so when multiplied by h (ft), the units become lb/ft², which is equivalent to psf (pounds per square foot)).

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the units here. Because pressure is force per unit area. So, the formula P = ρgh gives pressure in pascals when SI units are used, but with imperial units, it's in pounds per square foot? Or wait, perhaps I should convert to pounds per square inch because atmospheric pressure is often in psi.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the pressure in psi. Let me think about how to calculate that.

1 atmosphere is about 14.7 psi. The pressure from the water column at depth h would be ρgh, but we need to convert the units correctly.

Alternatively, since 1 foot of water is about 0.433 psi. So, for each foot of depth, the pressure increases by 0.433 psi. So, for 34 feet, the water pressure would be 34 * 0.433 psi.

Let me calculate that. 34 * 0.433. Let's see, 30 * 0.433 is 12.99, and 4 * 0.433 is about 1.732. So total is 12.99 + 1.732 = approximately 14.722 psi.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the water pressure at 34 feet deep is about 14.7 psi. Which is almost exactly 1 atmosphere (since 1 atm is ~14.7 psi). So, the pressure at the bottom is atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi) plus the water pressure (14.7 psi) for a total of 29.4 psi.

Wait, wait, wait. Actually, that can't be right. Let me think again. Because when you're underwater, the pressure you experience is the sum of the atmospheric pressure and the pressure from the water column.

So, at the surface, the pressure is 14.7 psi. At 34 ft depth, the pressure is 14.7 psi (atmospheric) plus the pressure from the 34 ft of water.

But wait, why did I get 14.7 psi for 34 ft of water? Because 34 ft * 0.433 psi/ft = 14.722 psi, which is approximately 14.7 psi. So that's correct.

So, total pressure at the bottom is 14.7 + 14.7 = 29.4 psi.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the 0.433 psi per foot is actually for freshwater. So, 34 ft of water would exert 34 * 0.433 psi. Wait, but wait, the total pressure at depth h in water is Patm plus ρgh. So, yes, that's correct.

So, P1 (bottom) = 14.7 psi (atmospheric) + 14.7 psi (water) = 29.4 psi.

Wait no, no. Wait, no: 34 ft of water exerts 14.7 psi, so the total pressure is atmospheric (14.7 psi) plus that, so 29.4 psi. So, P1 is 29.4 psi, and P2 is 14.7 psi at the surface.

So, applying Boyle's Law: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

We can rearrange this to find V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1.

So, P1 is 29.4, P2 is 14.7. So, 29.4 /14.7 is approximately 2. So, V2 = 2 * V1. So, the volume doubles.

Wait, but wait, that would mean the volume increases by a factor of 2. So, the volume increases from V1 to 2 V1, which is an increase factor of 2/1, so the volume doubles. So, the increase is 2 times. So, the answer would be option E: 2/1.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any unit errors. Let me double-check the calculation for the water pressure.

Each foot of water is about 0.433 psi. So 34 ft would be 34 * 0.433 = let's compute that more accurately.

34 * 0.4 is 13.6.

34 * 0.033 is approximately 1.122.

So total is approximately 13.6 + 1.122 = 14.722 psi.

Which is about 14.7 psi, so the total pressure at 34 ft deep is 14.7 (atm) + 14.7 (water) = 29.4 psi. So that's correct.

So, P1 = 29.4 psi, P2 = 14.7 psi.

So, the ratio P1/P2 is 29.4 /14.7 = 2. So, the volume increases by a factor of 2.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because when the bubbles are at the bottom, the pressure inside the bubble is P1, which is 29.4 psi. When they rise, the surrounding pressure decreases. So, the bubbles expand until the internal pressure equals the surrounding pressure.

So, yes, the expansion factor is P1/P2, which is 2, so the volume doubles.

Looking back at the options, option E is 2/1, which would mean the volume increases by a factor of 2, so the answer would be E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, people use absolute pressure. Let me make sure that I'm considering absolute pressure here, which I am. Because when the bubble is at the bottom, the pressure inside is absolute (including atmospheric), and same when it's at the surface.

So, I think my calculation is correct. So the volume increases by a factor of 2, so the answer is E: 2/1.

To determine how much the volume of air bubbles increases as they rise from the bottom of a 34 ft deep pond to the surface, we apply Boyle's Law, which states that for a gas at constant temperature, \( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \). Here, \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) are the pressures at the bottom and surface, respectively, and \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \) are the corresponding volumes.

### Step 1: Calculate the pressure at the bottom (\( P_1 \))
The total pressure at the bottom of the pond is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the water column. Atmospheric pressure is approximately \( 14.7 \, \text{psi} \). The pressure from the water column is calculated using the formula:

\[
P_{\text{water}} = \rho g h
\]

where:
- \( \rho = 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \) (density of water),
- \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( h = 34 \, \text{ft} \) (depth of the pond).

However, a simpler approximation is that 1 foot of water exerts about \( 0.433 \, \text{psi} \). Thus, the pressure from the water column is:

\[
P_{\text{water}} = 34 \times 0.433 \approx 14.7 \, \text{psi}.
\]

Adding this to atmospheric pressure, the total pressure at the bottom is:

\[
P_1 = P_{\text{atm}} + P_{\text{water}} = 14.7 \, \text{psi} + 14.7 \, \text{psi} = 29.4 \, \text{psi}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the pressure at the surface (\( P_2 \))
At the surface, the pressure is simply atmospheric pressure:

\[
P_2 = 14.7 \, \text{psi}.
\]

### Step 3: Apply Boyle's Law
Using Boyle's Law, \( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \), we can find the ratio of the final volume to the initial volume:

\[
\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{29.4}{14.7} \approx 2.
\]

This means the volume of the bubbles increases by a factor of 2 as they rise to the surface.

### Final Answer:
The volume of the bubbles increases by a factor of \( 2/1 \), so the correct answer is:

**E: 2/1**
