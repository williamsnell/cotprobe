Okay, so I've got this DNA sequence here: 5′-C-A-T-3′. Hmm, I remember that DNA is read in the 5' to 3' direction, right? So the sequence given is C, A, T in that order.

Wait, but when DNA is transcribed into mRNA, it's complementary and antiparallel. Oh wait, DNA has two strands, the coding and the template. The mRNA is made from the template strand. So the DNA strand that's being used as the template must be complementary to the mRNA.

Wait, the DNA given is 5' CAT 3'. So if that's the coding strand, the mRNA would be made from the complementary strand. Or is the given strand the template?

Wait, no. Wait, DNA strands are complementary. So let me think: the DNA double helix has two strands. One is 5' to 3' and the other is 3' to 5'. The mRNA is synthesized using the template strand, which is complementary to the coding strand.

So, the given DNA sequence is 5'-CAT-3'. If that's the coding strand, then the template strand would be 3'-GTA-5', because DNA is antiparallel. So when mRNA is made, it's complementary to the template strand, so it would read 5'-CUA-3' because mRNA is synthesized 5' to 3'.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. DNA has two strands: one is the sense (coding) strand and the other is the antisense (template) strand. The mRNA is synthesized based on the template strand, so the mRNA sequence is the same as the coding strand, except T becomes U.

Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. The DNA strand that's complementary to the mRNA is the template strand. So the mRNA is made by pairing with the template DNA strand.

So if the given DNA is 5' CAT 3', that's the coding strand. The template strand would be 3' GTA 5'. So the mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, so it would be 5' CUA 3' because it's complementary to the template strand (G becomes C, T becomes A, A becomes U? Wait wait, wait.

Wait, DNA is double stranded. Let's say the coding strand is 5' CAT 3' (so the top strand). The complementary (template) strand would run 3' GTA 5'. When mRNA is made, it's synthesized using the template strand as a guide, so the mRNA will be 5' CUA 3', right? Because mRNA is built in the 5' to 3' direction, so the first base in mRNA corresponds to the first base of the coding strand.

Wait no, the template strand is 3' GTA 5', so the mRNA is built complementary to that, so starting from the G which is at the 3' end of the template. So the mRNA's 5' end would start with C (complementary to G), then U (complementary to T), then A (complementary to A). So mRNA is 5' C U A 3'.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The DNA has two strands: one is 5' CAT 3' (coding), the other is 3' GTA 5' (template). When mRNA is made, it's synthesized complementary to the template strand, so the mRNA sequence is CAT, but with T replaced by U. So mRNA would be 5' CAU 3'?

Wait, no. Because the template strand is 3' GTA 5', so mRNA is synthesized as complementary to that, so starting from the 5' end: first, the mRNA adds a C (complementary to G), then a U (complementary to T), then an A (complementary to A). So the mRNA would be 5' CUA 3'.

Wait, but wait, the DNA strand that's being read is the template, which is 3' GTA 5'. So the mRNA is built in the 5' to 3' direction, so the mRNA sequence is complementary to the template. So the DNA's G becomes C in mRNA, T becomes A, A becomes U. So mRNA is 5' C A U 3'?

Wait, wait, no. DNA template is 3' G T A 5'. So the mRNA is built in the 5'→3' direction, so the first base added is complementary to G, which is C, then complementary to T is A, then complementary to A is U. So mRNA is 5' CAU 3'.

Wait, but wait, the given DNA sequence is 5' CAT 3'. So the complementary strand is 3' GTA 5'. So mRNA is synthesized as 5' CUA 3'? Or is it 5' CAU 3'?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The DNA's coding strand is 5' CAT 3', so the mRNA is synthesized using the template strand (3' GTA 5'), so the mRNA must pair with the template, so mRNA is 5' CUA 3' because DNA's G becomes mRNA's C, T becomes A, A becomes U.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing the direction. Let me draw it out.

DNA strands:

Coding (sense) strand: 5' C A T 3'
Template (antisense) strand: 3' G T A 5'

mRNA is synthesized from the template strand. So the mRNA sequence is complementary to the template, so:

DNA template: G T A (from 3' to 5')
mRNA is synthesized 5' to 3', so the mRNA will be C A U.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the mRNA is built based on the template strand, which is G T A in the 3' to 5' direction. So mRNA starts adding nucleotides from the 5' end, so the first nucleotide is complementary to G (so C), then T becomes A, A becomes U. So mRNA is 5' C A U 3'.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: DNA's mRNA is complementary to the template strand. So the mRNA is the same as the coding strand, but with U instead of T.

So the coding strand is 5' CAT 3', so the mRNA would be 5' CAU 3'.

Oh wait, that makes sense. Because the coding and mRNA are similar except for T→U. So the mRNA is 5' CAU 3'.

So the mRNA codon is CAU.

Now, the tRNA anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon. But wait, tRNA anticodon is complementary to the mRNA codon, and it's written in the same direction as the mRNA.

Wait, mRNA codon is 5' CAU 3'. So the anticodon on tRNA would be 3' GUA 5', but wait, tRNA is written as 5' to 3' in its anticodon. So the anticodon would be the reverse complement.

Wait, no. Let me think. mRNA is 5' CAU 3'. The tRNA anticodon is complementary and antiparallel. So the anticodon would be 3' GUA 5', but when written in the 5' to 3' direction, it becomes 5' A U G 3'.

Wait, no. Wait, tRNA anticodon is written 5' to 3', so the anticodon is the complement of the mRNA codon, but in reverse order.

Wait, if mRNA is 5' C A U 3', then the anticodon is the complement in reverse. So the anticodon would be 5' A U G 3'.

Wait, let's see: mRNA is 5' C A U 3'. So the complementary bases would be G, U, A. But since the anticodon is antiparallel, the order is reversed. So the anticodon is A U G in the 5'→3' direction.

Wait, wait. Let me think of it as base pairing: mRNA is 5' C A U 3', so anticodon is 3' G U A 5'. But since the anticodon is written 5'→3', it's 5' A U G 3'.

So the tRNA anticodon is 5' A U G 3'.

Looking at the options, option H is 5'-AUG-3', which is 5' A U G 3'.

Wait, but wait, I thought the mRNA codon was CAU, which codes for histidine. The tRNA anticodon would be AUG, but wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused because sometimes the genetic code is read as mRNA codon to amino acid. So let me check.

Wait, the genetic code is based on the mRNA codon. So mRNA codon is CAU, which corresponds to Histidine (His). The tRNA anticodon that pairs with CAU would be GUA, but wait, wait.

Wait, no. Let's think about it: mRNA codon is 5' CAU 3'. The tRNA anticodon is complementary and antiparallel. So each base in the anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon.

So the first base of mRNA (C) pairs with G in the tRNA. Second base (A) pairs with U. Third base (U) pairs with A.

Wait, no. Wait, tRNA pairs with mRNA in an antiparallel way. So mRNA's 5' C would pair with tRNA's 3' G, mRNA's A would pair with tRNA's U, and mRNA's U would pair with tRNA's A.

So the tRNA anticodon would be 3' GUA 5', but when written in the 5'→3' direction, it's 5' A U G 3'.

So the anticodon is A U G.

Looking at the options, option H is 5'-AUG-3'.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The DNA sequence provided is 5′-C-A-T-3′. During transcription, mRNA is synthesized complementary to the template strand of DNA. The template strand complementary to 5′-C-A-T-3′ is 3′-G-T-A-5′. Therefore, the mRNA sequence is 5′-C-A-U-3′ (since RNA uses uracil instead of thymine).

tRNA anticodons are complementary to mRNA codons and are written in the 5′ to 3′ direction. To determine the anticodon for the mRNA codon 5′-C-A-U-3′:

1. The first base of the mRNA codon (C) pairs with G in the tRNA anticodon.
2. The second base (A) pairs with U.
3. The third base (U) pairs with A.

Thus, the tRNA anticodon is 5′-A-U-G-3′.

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

H: 5′-A-U-G-3′.

Answer: H
