Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A manager's competitor sent a defamatory letter to the manager accusing him of professional incompetence and calling him one of the worst businessmen in town. It was addressed to the manager. He read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. Later, he tried to sue the competitor for defamation as a result of the letter. Will the court likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds? Base your answer on the common law definition of defamation.

Options:

A: No, it will not dismiss because a plaintiff in a defamatory action has an absolute right to a jury trial to prove defamation.
B: Yes, it will dismiss on the grounds that the manager did not suffer any actual harm or damage as a result of the letter.
C: No, it will not dismiss because the manager has the right to sue for emotional damages.
D: No, it will not dismiss because the letter constitutes malicious intent.
E: Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.
F: Yes, it will dismiss because the competitor has freedom of speech.
G: No, it will not dismiss because the competitor intentionally sent the letter to harm the manager's reputation.
H: Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.
I: No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.
J: Yes, it will dismiss on the grounds that the letter does not specifically mention the manager's profession.

Okay, so I need to figure out this defamation question. Let me start by recalling what I know about defamation under common law. From what I remember, defamation involves a false statement that harms someone's reputation, communicated to a third party, and the speaker must have been at least negligent in making the statement.

The question is about a manager who received a defamatory letter from a competitor. The letter calls him incompetent and one of the worst businessmen. The manager read it, put it away, and didn't show it to anyone else. Now he's suing for defamation.

Wait, but under common law, isn't there a requirement that the defamatory statement be published to a third party? Publication here means communication to someone else, not just the person being defamed. So if the letter was only sent to the manager and he didn't show it to anyone else, then maybe there's no publication. Because if it's just between the sender and the receiver without anyone else knowing, that might not meet the publication element required for defamation.

Looking at the options, option H says the court will dismiss because the publication was made to the manager alone. That seems to align with what I was thinking. If the statement wasn't shared with others, there's no publication, so no defamation claim.

Other options: Option B says no harm, but I think at common law, general damages for harm are presumed in some cases, especially libel. But wait, maybe if it's just sent to the plaintiff, and no third party, then maybe the harm is minimal. Hmm, I'm not sure. But I think the key issue is publication.

Option E talks about the language not being damaging. The language here does seem damagingâ€”calling someone incompetent and a bad businessman would harm their reputation. So E might not be correct.

Option F is about free speech, but that's more of a defense if the statement is true or an opinion, but here it's defamatory, so F doesn't apply.

Option G says it's intentional, which is about malice, but again, the main issue is whether the statement was published.

So I think the main reason the court would dismiss is that the letter was only published to the manager himself, so no third party. That would make option H the correct answer.

The court would likely dismiss the case because the defamatory letter was only sent to the manager and not shared with any third party. Under common law, defamation requires publication to a third party, which did not occur here.
