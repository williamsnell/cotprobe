Okay, so I have this problem here where each story of a building is 14.3 feet tall, and the total height of the building is 185.9 feet. I need to find out how many floors the building has. Hmm, let's see. 

Wait, I remember that each floor is a story, right? So if each story is 14.3 feet, then the total number of stories would be the total height divided by the height per story. That makes sense because if you multiply the number of floors by the height per floor, you get the total height.

So the calculation would be 185.9 divided by 14.3. Let me do that. Hmm, let's see. I can write it out as 185.9 รท 14.3. Let me try to calculate that.

Wait, maybe I can approximate this. 14.3 times 10 is 143. 14.3 times 12 is 171.6 because 10 times is 143, 2 times is 28.6, so adding those gives 171.6. Then 14.3 times 13 is 185.9 because 14.3*10=143, 14.3*3=42.9, so 143+42.9=185.9. Oh wait, that's exactly the total height given! So 14.3 multiplied by 13 equals 185.9. So the number of floors is 13.

Wait, but the options are from A to J. Let me check the options again. The options are A:10, B:15, C:17, D:9, E:11, F:16, G:12, H:13, I:18, J:14. So option H is 13, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 14.3 times 13: 14 *13 is 182, and 0.3*13 is 3.9, so 182+3.9 is 185.9. Yep, that's correct. So the building has 13 floors.

To determine the number of floors in the building, divide the total height by the height per floor:

\[
\text{Number of floors} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Height per floor}} = \frac{185.9}{14.3} = 13
\]

Thus, the building has 13 floors. The correct answer is:

H: 13
