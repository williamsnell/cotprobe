Okay, so I have this problem about a simple random walk. Let me try to break it down. The setup is that S₀ is 0, and each step, the probability of going up by 1 is 1/4, and down by 1 is 3/4. We're looking to find the probability that the maximum value M of the walk ever reaches at least 5. So, M is the maximum of S_n for all n ≥ 0, and we want P(M ≥5).

I remember that for random walks, especially asymmetric ones, there are methods to calculate probabilities like this. Since the walk is asymmetric (probabilities not equal for up and down), the approach might involve some recursive relations or generating functions. But I'm not too sure about the exact method here.

Wait, I think the generating function approach is useful for first passage probabilities. Alternatively, I remember something about Gambler's Ruin problems, where you calculate the probability of reaching a certain wealth before going bankrupt. Maybe this is similar.

In the Gambler's Ruin problem, the probability of reaching a certain target before going broke can be found using a formula involving the probabilities p and q, where p is the probability of moving up and q down (p + q =1). In this case, p is 1/4 and q is 3/4.

The formula for the probability of reaching N before 0, starting from k, is [(1 - (q/p)^k) / (1 - (q/p)^N)] if p ≠ q. But wait, in our case, our starting point is 0, and we're looking for the probability that the maximum ever reaches 5. Hmm, that's a bit different. Because starting at 0, the first step has to go to 1, or can it go negative?

Wait, no. Because the walk starts at S₀=0. The first step, S₁ can be +1 with probability 1/4 or -1 with 3/4. But wait, if it goes to -1, then the maximum M would be 0, since it never went above 0. So, for M to be at least 5, the walk must reach 5 at some point before going to negative infinity, I suppose.

Wait, but the walk is on integers, right? So, the maximum M is the highest value the walker ever attains. So, to have M ≥5, the walker must reach 5 before going to, say, negative values. But since the walk can go to negative infinity, the question is about the probability that it ever reaches 5, regardless of what happens after.

Wait, but in the Gambler's Ruin problem, the probability of reaching N before 0 is known. So maybe that's the same as the probability that M >= N, starting from 0. Because if you reach N, the maximum will certainly be N. But in our case, the starting point is 0, so the first step is either +1 or -1.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this. Let me consider the probability that starting from 0, the walk ever reaches 5. Because if it reaches 5, then M is at least 5.

But wait, the walk starts at 0. The first step is to 1 with probability 1/4, or to -1 with 3/4. If it goes to -1, then the maximum M is 0, which is less than 5. So, only the paths where the first step is +1 can potentially reach 5. So, the probability is (1/4) multiplied by the probability that, starting from 1, the walk reaches 5 before going to -infinity.

Wait, no. Because if it goes to 1, then from 1, it can either go to 2 or 0. If it goes back to 0, then the maximum is still 1, so it hasn't reached 5. So, the question is about the probability that starting from 0, the walk ever reaches 5 before going to -infinity. Alternatively, it's the same as the probability that the walk reaches 5 before it reaches a lower boundary, say, negative values.

Wait, but in the Gambler's Ruin problem, the ruin state is 0, and the target is N. So, starting from k, the probability of reaching N before 0 is [(1 - (q/p)^k) / (1 - (q/p)^N)] when p ≠ q.

Wait, in our case, p is 1/4, q is 3/4. So q/p = (3/4)/(1/4) = 3. So, the formula would be [1 - 3^k] / [1 - 3^N], but wait, that can't be right because if N is 5 and k is 0, then [1-3^0]/[1-3^5] = (1-1)/(1-243) = 0. So that suggests the probability is 0, but that can't be right because there's a chance, albeit small, that the walk could reach 5.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the starting point. Because in the Gambler's Ruin problem, if you start at k, the probability of reaching N before 0 is [1 - (q/p)^k] / [1 - (q/p)^N]. But when starting from 0, this gives 0, which makes sense because you've already hit 0.

Wait, but in our problem, the walk starts at 0. So the first step is either to 1 or -1. So the probability we want is the probability that, starting from 1, the walk reaches 5 before reaching -infinity. Because if the first step is -1, then M remains 0, which is less than 5. So the overall probability is (1/4) * P(reach 5 before -infty starting from 1).

Wait, but does this Gambler's Ruin formula apply here? Let's think. In the standard problem, the walk continues until it reaches either 0 or N. Here, perhaps the walk can go to negative infinity, so the ruin state is 0, but the walk can go on forever in the negative direction.

Wait, but in our case, the walk is only interested in whether it ever reaches 5. So, the problem becomes, starting from 1, what's the probability that the walk reaches 5 before it goes to negative infinity. Because once it reaches 5, M would have been at least 5.

Wait, but in reality, from 1, the walk could go to 2 or 0. If it goes to 0, then M is 1, but if it goes to 2, it has a chance to go higher. Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a Markov chain where each state is the current position, and we want the probability of ever reaching state 5.

In that case, for each state k (where k is an integer), the probability of eventually reaching 5 starting from k is f(k). We have f(5)=1, since we're already there. For k <5, f(k) = p*f(k+1) + q*f(k-1). For k=0, since it's the starting point, we can think about whether the walk can reach 5 before going to negative infinity. Wait, but in our problem, the walk can't go beyond negative infinity, but in practice, the process would either reach 5 or drift to -infty.

So, for states k <5, the recurrence is f(k) = p f(k+1) + q f(k-1).

But for the states beyond 5, perhaps f(k) =1 for k ≥5, since once you reach 5, you've succeeded. Wait, no: actually, once you reach 5, you've succeeded, but for k >5, maybe the maximum is higher than 5, but in our case, since we're only concerned with M ≥5, any path that reaches 5 or higher will count. So, perhaps f(k) =1 for k ≥5, and f(k) is less for k <5.

Wait, but the walk could go above 5, but since we're only interested in whether it ever reaches 5, once it does, it's counted. So f(5)=1, and for k>5, f(k)=1 as well because you've already passed 5.

Wait, but maybe that's not correct. Because if you're starting at k>5, you've already achieved M ≥5. So yes, f(k)=1 for all k ≥5.

Now, for k=0, f(0) is the probability that starting from 0, the walk ever reaches 5. But wait, starting from 0, the first step is to 1 or -1. So f(0) = (1/4) f(1) + (3/4) f(-1). But f(-1) is the probability of reaching 5 starting from -1. But starting from -1, can the walk reach 5? It's possible, but the further you start below 0, the harder it is.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as an infinite set of equations. Let me consider for each k, f(k) = p f(k+1) + q f(k-1), with boundary conditions f(5)=1, and as k approaches -infty, f(k) approaches 0, because the further down you start, the less likely you are to reach 5.

But solving this for all k <5 would require setting up a system of equations. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a known solution for this kind of asymmetric walk.

Wait, I remember that in asymmetric walks, the probability of reaching a certain point can be found using the formula involving (q/p)^k. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach.

Let me think. For an asymmetric random walk on integers with p ≠ q, the probability of ever reaching N starting from k is [1 - (q/p)^k] / [1 - (q/p)^N], provided that q/p <1. Wait, but in our case, q=3/4, p=1/4, so q/p =3. So q/p >1.

In that case, the formula would be different. Let me recall: when the walk is biased towards the left (since p=1/4 < q=3/4), the probability of reaching N starting from k is [ (q/p)^k -1 ] / [ (q/p)^N -1 ].

Wait, let me check: in the Gambler's Ruin problem, when p < q, the probability of ruin is higher. The formula for the probability of reaching N before 0 when starting from k is [1 - (q/p)^k] / [1 - (q/p)^N] when p < q and k ≥0.

Wait, no, I might have that inverted. Let me think again.

In the Gambler's Ruin problem, the probability of reaching N before 0 starting from k is:

If p ≠ q: [1 - (q/p)^k] / [1 - (q/p)^N].

But this is valid when p < q, which is our case. So, in our problem, starting from k=1, the probability of reaching 5 before 0 is [1 - (q/p)^1] / [1 - (q/p)^5].

Wait, but q/p =3, so (q/p)^k =3^k.

So f(1) = [1 - 3^1] / [1 - 3^5] = (1-3)/(1-243) = (-2)/(-242) = 2/242 = 1/121 ≈ 0.0082644628.

Wait, but does that make sense? Because starting from 1, with p=1/4, it's less likely to reach 5, so the probability should be low.

Wait, but then the overall probability we’re looking for is f(0) = (1/4) f(1) + (3/4) f(-1).

But what's f(-1)? Starting from -1, the probability of reaching 5 is even lower. Wait, but in the Gambler's Ruin problem, the ruin state is 0. So if you start at -1, does that mean you've already been ruined? Or does the process continue? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the walk starting from 0. The maximum M is at least 5 only if the walk reaches 5 before going to negative infinity. So, perhaps the probability is the same as starting from 0, the walk reaches 5 before it goes to negative infinity.

Wait, but in the Gambler's Ruin problem, the states are typically from 0 to N, and the walk stops when it reaches either. In our case, the walk can go to negative infinity, so perhaps the problem is a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum M is at least 5 if and only if the walk ever reaches 5. Because once it reaches 5, M is 5 or higher, regardless of what happens after.

So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that the walk ever reaches 5, starting from 0.

But starting from 0, the first step is to 1 with probability 1/4, or to -1 with 3/4. So, the probability we want is (1/4) * f(1), where f(1) is the probability that starting from 1, the walk ever reaches 5.

Now, for f(1), using the Gambler's Ruin formula: f(1) = [1 - (q/p)^1] / [1 - (q/p)^5].

Plugging in q/p=3: f(1) = (1-3)/(1-3^5) = (-2)/(1-243) = (-2)/(-242) = 1/121.

So, f(0) = (1/4) * (1/121) = 1/(4*121) = 1/484 ≈ 0.0020661157.

Wait, but that seems really small. Let me think again. Because starting from 1, the probability of reaching 5 is 1/121, which is about 0.00826, and then f(0) is 1/4 of that, which is about 0.00206. So, the probability that M≥5 is about 0.00206, which is 0.206%.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.01234567, which is about 1.23%. Option C is 0.00987654, around 0.987%. None of them match 0.00206. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should model the problem differently. Because when the walk is at 0, it can only go to 1 or -1. But if it goes to -1, the maximum M is 0, so the probability of M≥5 is only possible if the walk reaches 5 before going to -infty.

Wait, but in the Gambler's Ruin problem, I think the formula gives the probability of reaching N before 0. So, for our case, starting from 1, the probability of reaching 5 before 0 is f(1) = [1 - (q/p)] / [1 - (q/p)^5] when q/p >1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify the formula. The standard Gambler's Ruin probability for reaching N before 0, starting from k, is:

If p ≠ q,

P(k) = [1 - (q/p)^k] / [1 - (q/p)^N]

In our case, q/p =3, and N=5, k=1.

So,

P(1) = [1 - 3^1] / [1 - 3^5] = (1-3)/(1-243) = (-2)/(-242) = 1/121 ≈0.00826446.

So, starting from 1, the probability to reach 5 before 0 is 1/121.

Then, the overall probability starting from 0 is f(0)= (1/4)*P(1) + (3/4)*P(-1).

But what is P(-1)? Because starting from -1, can the walk reach 5 before 0? Or is 0 an absorbing state?

Wait, in the Gambler's Ruin, 0 is an absorbing state (you're ruined), so starting from -1, you can't reach 5 because you've already been ruined. So P(-1)=0.

Wait, but that can't be right because in our problem, the walk starts at 0, and if it goes to -1, it's not necessarily ruined in the sense that the maximum M is only 0. So, perhaps P(-1) is the probability of reaching 5 starting from -1, which would require the walk to go from -1 to 0, then to 1, then to 2, etc., up to 5.

So, in that case, starting from -1, the probability to reach 5 is P(-1) = [1 - (q/p)^{-1}] / [1 - (q/p)^5} ].

Wait, but (q/p)^{-1} is (1/3).

So,

P(-1) = [1 - (1/3)] / [1 - 3^5] = (2/3) / (1-243) = (2/3)/(-242) = -2/(3*242) ≈-0.00272.

But probability can't be negative. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the formula doesn't apply for k<0.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's define f(k) as the probability of ever reaching 5 starting from position k.

We know f(5)=1, and for k <5, f(k) = p f(k+1) + q f(k-1).

Wait, but this is an infinite set of equations because k can go to negative infinity. But maybe we can find a general solution.

The homogeneous recurrence equation is f(k) - p f(k+1) - q f(k-1) = 0.

The characteristic equation is r^2 - (1/p) r - (q/p) = 0.

Wait, let's rearrange. Let me write the recurrence as:

p f(k+1) - f(k) + q f(k-1) =0.

So the characteristic equation would be p r^2 - r + q =0.

Solving for r: r = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4 p q)] / (2 p).

Wait, but p=1/4, q=3/4. So,

sqrt(1 - 4*(1/4)*(3/4)) = sqrt(1 - 3
