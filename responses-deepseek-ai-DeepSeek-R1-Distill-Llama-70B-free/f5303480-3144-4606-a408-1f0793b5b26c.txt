Question:

A grocery store is sued by a customer for damages for injuries allegedly suffered to the face and forearms, which resulted from his collision with the store's automatic doors. The customer contended that at the time of the mishap, the doors were programmed to swing outward, taking would-be customers entering the store, by surprise. At trial, the customer testified to both the nature of his injuries and the events leading up to their occurrence. The grocery store denied that the doors to its store were in any way unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by his encounter with the doors. The customer's sister testified at trial that she accompanied her brother to the store the day of the accident and witnessed the outward swinging doors, which struck him. She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, due to the possibility of bias.
B: admissible, as a first-hand witness account of the event.
C: inadmissible, as it lacks direct connection to the case.
D: admissible, as evidence of the store's negligence.
E: inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.
F: inadmissible, as it is hearsay evidence.
G: admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.
H: inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.
I: admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. So the situation is a customer sued a grocery store for injuries from automatic doors swinging outward. The customer and his sister testified. The sister said she saw the doors swing outward on the day of the accident and that a week later, they were reprogrammed to swing inward.

The question is about whether the sister's testimony is admissible. The options are A through J, each with different reasons.

First, I need to break down what the sister testified to. She was present during the accident and saw the doors, so she's a first-hand witness. That part seems relevant. She also testified about the doors being changed a week later.

Now, the issue is the admissibility of her testimony, especially the part about the doors being reprogrammed. I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, subsequent remedial measures are generally inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. That's FRE 407. So if the store changed the doors after the accident, that's a remedial measure and can't be used to show they were negligent before.

But wait, the sister's testimony about the doors swinging outward on the day of the accidentâ€” that's direct evidence of the event. That should be admissible as she's a witness to the fact. The problem comes with her testimony about the doors being changed later. That part might be inadmissible under FRE 407.

Looking at the options:

A: Inadmissible due to bias. The sister is related, so she might be biased, but that goes to the weight of the evidence, not admissibility. The judge doesn't exclude testimony just because of possible bias; it's for the jury to consider.

B: Admissible as a firsthand account. Yes, her presence makes her a firsthand witness, so that part is admissible.

C: Inadmissible, lacks direct connection. No, her testimony directly relates to the accident and the doors, so it's connected.

D: Admissible as evidence of negligence. Wait, if she testifies the doors were changed, that's a remedial measure. So that part would be inadmissible under 407. But the earlier part about the doors swinging out is admissible.

E: Public policy. Not sure, but I don't think public policy would make her entire testimony inadmissible.

F: Hearsay. No, she's testifying to what she saw, so it's not hearsay.

G: Tacit admission. That's when a party's silence is an adoptive admission. Doesn't apply here.

H: Irrelevant. No, her testimony is relevant to the case.

I: Lay opinion. She's testifying to facts, not opinions, so I don't think this applies.

Wait, the sister's testimony includes two parts: the accident and the subsequent change. The first part is admissible. The second part about the doors being changed is inadmissible under 407.

But the question is about the trial judge's ruling on her testimony. Is the entire testimony inadmissible, or just part of it?

If the question is about the entire testimony, then part of it is admissible (the accident) and part is not (the change). But the options don't split it that way. So perhaps the issue is whether the sister's testimony as a whole is admissible.

Alternatively, maybe the sister's testimony about the doors being reprogrammed is being offered to show negligence, which would be barred by 407. So that part would be inadmissible, but the rest is okay.

Looking at the options again, option D says it's admissible as evidence of negligence. But the problem is that the subsequent change is inadmissible for that purpose. So if the sister's testimony includes that, then that part is inadmissible. But the question is whether the sister's testimony as a whole is admissible.

Wait, the sister's testimony about the doors being reprogrammed a week later is a subsequent remedial measure. So that part is inadmissible to prove negligence. But her testimony about the doors on the day of the accident is admissible.

So the sister is a firsthand witness, so the first part is admissible. But the part about the doors changing is inadmissible under 407 if it's being used to show negligence.

So the question is about the admissibility of her testimony. The options don't specify which part, so I think the answer hinges on whether her testimony about the subsequent change is admissible.

Option D says admissible as evidence of negligence. But under 407, that's not allowed. So if the sister's testimony includes that, it's inadmissible for that purpose. But the first part is admissible.

Hmm, but maybe the sister's testimony about the doors being changed is admissible for another purpose, like to show the doors were dangerous, not just to prove negligence. Wait, but 407 says it's inadmissible for negligence or culpable conduct, but admissible for other purposes, like to show ownership or control.

Wait, no. 407 says that evidence of subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence, but it can be admitted for other purposes. So, perhaps the sister's testimony about the doors being reprogrammed is admissible to show that the store had notice or that the doors were defective, but not to prove negligence.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the testimony about the doors being changed could be excluded under 407 if the only purpose is to show negligence.

So, the sister's testimony about the doors on the day is admissible, but the part about the change is inadmissible if offered to prove negligence.

The question is whether the sister's testimony is admissible. It's possible that the judge would allow the testimony about the accident but exclude the part about the doors being changed.

But the options don't present this; they present the entire testimony as admissible or not.

Wait, looking at option D again: "admissible as evidence of the store's negligence." So if the sister's testimony about the reprogramming is being used to show negligence, it's inadmissible under 407. So the trial judge should rule that part inadmissible. But the rest is admissible.

If the sister's testimony includes both parts, the judge would have to make a ruling on each part. But the question is about the sister's testimony as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the sister's testimony about the subsequent change is admissible as a lay witness's observation, not for the purpose of showing negligence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The sister's testimony about the doors at the time of the accident is admissible as a firsthand account. Her testimony about the doors being changed later is inadmissible under 407 if used to prove negligence, but admissible for other purposes, like control.

But if the store's negligence is the issue, then the subsequent change can't be used to prove that. So if the sister's testimony about the change is being offered to show the store was negligent, it's inadmissible. But if it's offered to show that the store had control over the doors, then it's admissible.

But the question is whether the sister's testimony is admissible at all. So the part about the accident is admissible, and the part about the change is inadmissible for certain purposes.

But the trial judge's ruling would likely allow the sister to testify about the accident but exclude her testimony about the change if it's being used to prove negligence.

However, the question is phrased, "the sister's testimony" as a whole. So if any part is inadmissible, the entire testimony isn't necessarily excluded. But more likely, the judge would allow the relevant parts and exclude the others.

Looking at the options, option D says it's admissible as evidence of negligence. But the part about the change isn't admissible for that. So option D would be incorrect.

Option B says it's admissible as a firsthand account. That's correct for the part about the accident. So the sister can testify about the doors swinging outward, which is a firsthand account, making that part admissible.

But the question is about the entire testimony. If the sister's testimony includes both the accident and the change, then part is admissible and part isn't. But the options don't allow for that.

Alternatively, maybe the sister's testimony about the change is admissible for another purpose, such as to show that the store had knowledge of the problem. But 407 still applies if it's to show negligence.

Wait, perhaps the sister's testimony about the change is not hearsay and is admissible under another rule. But it's still covered by 407.

I think the correct answer is D: admissible as evidence of the store's negligence. Wait no, because the change is inadmissible under 407 for that purpose.

Wait, no. The sister's testimony about the doors at the time of the accident is admissible as a firsthand account, which is relevant to the store's negligence. Her testimony about the change is inadmissible for that purpose.

So the sister's testimony is partially admissible and partially inadmissible. But the question is about the entire testimony.

Wait, perhaps the sister's testimony about the doors being changed is not for the purpose of showing negligence but to show that the doors were defective. But 407 would still block it if the purpose is to show negligence.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says admissible as a firsthand account. That's correct for the accident part. So the sister can testify about what she saw on the day, which is admissible.

The part about the doors being reprogrammed a week later is inadmissible under 407 if used to prove negligence. But the sister's presence and testimony about the doors at the time are admissible.

So the sister's testimony as a whole is admissible in part. But the question is whether the judge should rule her testimony admissible or not.

If the question is about the entire testimony, the answer would depend on whether any part is inadmissible. But I think the sister's testimony about the accident is admissible, and the part about the change is inadmissible for certain purposes.

But looking at the options, option B says it's admissible as a firsthand account, which is correct for the accident. So the judge should allow that part, making option B correct.

Wait, but the question is about the sister's testimony in its entirety. If part is admissible and part isn't, but the question is about whether the testimony is admissible, the judge would allow the admissible parts and exclude the others. So the sister would be allowed to testify about the accident, but not about the change (for negligence purposes).

But the options don't present that. So perhaps the correct answer is B, because the sister is a firsthand witness, and her testimony about the accident is admissible.

So the answer is B. But wait, the options don't address the subsequent part. So the sister's testimony about the doors on the day is admissible, making the answer B.

Alternatively, if the sister's testimony includes the change, and that part is inadmissible, then the judge would have to decide whether to admit the testimony in part.

But the question is phrased as whether the judge should rule the sister's testimony as a whole.

I think the sister's testimony about the accident is admissible, so the judge allows it. So option B is correct.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of the sister's testimony in a case where a customer sued a grocery store for injuries caused by automatic doors swinging outward. The sister testified about two key points: (1) witnessing the doors swing outward on the day of the accident and (2) observing that the doors had been reprogrammed to swing inward when she returned the following week. The analysis focuses on the admissibility of these two parts of her testimony under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

1. **Testimony about the doors on the day of the accident**: The sister was a firsthand witness to the event and testified about what she directly observed. This part of her testimony is relevant and admissible as it pertains to the facts of the case.

2. **Testimony about the doors being reprogrammed a week later**: Under Federal Rule of Evidence 407, evidence of subsequent remedial measures (such as reprogramming the doors) is generally inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. If the sister's testimony about the reprogramming is being used to show the store's negligence, it would be inadmissible for that purpose. However, it could potentially be admissible for other purposes, such as to show the store's control over the doors or awareness of a potential issue.

Given the options provided, the sister's testimony about the doors on the day of the accident is admissible as a firsthand account. While the testimony about the subsequent reprogramming is inadmissible under Rule 407 if used to prove negligence, the question does not specify the purpose of that part of her testimony. Therefore, the judge should rule that the sister's testimony is admissible as a firsthand witness account of the event.
