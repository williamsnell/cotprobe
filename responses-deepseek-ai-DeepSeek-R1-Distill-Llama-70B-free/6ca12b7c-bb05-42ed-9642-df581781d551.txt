Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about a particle moving in a circle. The radius is 10 meters. At a certain instant, the particle's speed is 10 m/s, and it's increasing at a rate of 10 m/s². I need to find the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors. Hmm, velocity and acceleration vectors... I remember that in circular motion, there are two components of acceleration: one tangential and one centripetal.

Wait, right! When an object moves in a circle, its acceleration has two parts. One part is due to the change in speed, which is the tangential acceleration. The other is due to the change in direction, which is the centripetal acceleration. So the total acceleration is the vector sum of these two.

So the velocity vector is tangential to the circle at that point, right? And the acceleration vector has both tangential and centripetal components. So the angle between velocity and acceleration would be determined by these components.

Let me think about the formulas. The tangential acceleration, a_t, is the rate of change of speed, which is given as 10 m/s². The centripetal acceleration, a_c, is given by v²/r. Oh wait, here v is 10 m/s, and r is 10 meters. So a_c = (10)^2 / 10 = 10 m/s². Oh wait, that's neat, both a_t and a_c are 10 m/s².

So the acceleration vector has two perpendicular components: a_t in the same direction as the velocity (since speed is increasing), and a_c pointing towards the center of the circle, which is perpendicular to the velocity.

So the acceleration vector would have a tangential part a_t = 10 m/s² and a centripetal part a_c = 10 m/s². Since these are perpendicular, I can think of them as the legs of a right triangle, with the acceleration vector as the hypotenuse.

Wait, no, the tangential acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity vector, right? Because when you speed up, the acceleration is in the direction of motion. The centripetal is perpendicular to that, towards the center. So the angle between velocity and acceleration would be the angle between the velocity vector and the vector sum of a_t and a_c.

Alternatively, since I know the two components of acceleration, I can model this as a vector addition. Let's say the velocity is along the positive x-axis. Then the tangential acceleration a_t is also along the x-axis, and the centripetal acceleration a_c is along the negative y-axis (if the motion is circular, the centripetal is towards the center, which would be in the negative y direction if moving along positive x).

Wait, no, that's not right. The centripetal acceleration is always towards the center of the circle. So if the particle is moving along the circumference, and the circle is in the xy-plane, the centripetal acceleration points towards the center. So the direction depends on the position, but perhaps for the angle calculation, the exact direction (left or right) doesn't matter because we're looking for the angle between vectors.

Wait, maybe it's better to represent the acceleration in terms of components relative to the velocity. So, the velocity vector has a direction, and the acceleration has two components: one in the same direction (a_t), and one perpendicular (a_c). So the acceleration vector would form a right triangle with these two components. 

Since the velocity is in one direction, and the acceleration has a component in that direction and another perpendicular, the angle θ between velocity and acceleration can be found using the dot product formula. Or perhaps using trigonometry because we have the components.

Wait, the angle between the velocity and the acceleration vector. The acceleration vector is the sum of a_t and a_c. So the acceleration vector is a_t along velocity's direction and a_c perpendicular. So the angle between velocity and acceleration would be the angle between the velocity vector and the vector (a_t, a_c). Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Let me visualize this. The velocity vector is pointing tangentially. The tangential acceleration is in the same direction as velocity, so that's a_t = 10 m/s². The centripetal acceleration is a_c = 10 m/s², pointing towards the center, which is perpendicular to the velocity vector. So the acceleration vector is the vector sum of a_t (same direction as v) and a_c (perpendicular to v). 

So the acceleration vector will have a component in the direction of v and a component perpendicular. The angle between v and a is therefore determined by the ratio of a_c to the total acceleration. Or wait, no, because the angle is between v and a. Since a has two components (a_t and a_c), both of which are known, I can compute the angle.

Alternatively, the angle between them can be found using the dot product. The dot product of v and a is |v||a| cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. So I can compute the dot product in terms of their components.

Wait, but I don't know the magnitude of a. Let me compute |a| first. Since a has components a_t and a_c, which are perpendicular, the magnitude is sqrt(a_t² + a_c²) = sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(200) = 10√2 m/s².

Now, the dot product v · a is (v_x a_x + v_y a_y). But since velocity is entirely in the x-direction (for simplicity), then v_y = 0. The acceleration has a_x = a_t (10 m/s²) and a_y = a_c (10 m/s², but direction depends on the position; perhaps negative if towards center when moving along positive x).

Wait, no, the direction matters for the dot product. Let's say the velocity is in the positive x-direction. Then, the centripetal acceleration is towards the center. If the particle is moving along the positive x-direction, the center is at (0,0) assuming the particle is at (r, 0), then the centripetal acceleration would be towards (0,0), which is in the negative x-direction? No, wait, that's not right. Because if the particle is moving in a circle, say, in the xy-plane, moving along positive x, the centripetal acceleration would be towards the center of the circle, which is at (0,0). So if the particle is at (r,0), the acceleration is towards (0,0), which is along the negative x-axis. But wait, that would mean that the centripetal acceleration is opposite to the direction of velocity. But that can't be right because the velocity is tangential, so the acceleration towards the center would be perpendicular to the velocity.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If the particle is moving in a circle of radius r, at a particular instant, the position is (r,0). The velocity is tangential, so in the positive y-direction. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if the particle is moving along the circle in the positive x-direction at that point, then the velocity is along the positive x, and the centripetal acceleration is towards the center, which is at (0,0), so the centripetal acceleration would be in the negative x-direction. But that's not perpendicular; that's opposite. That can't be right because centripetal acceleration is always perpendicular to velocity. Hmmm, maybe I'm getting the direction wrong.

Wait a second. Maybe I should model the circle such that at the point in question, the velocity is in the positive x-direction, and the position is at (r, 0). Then, the centripetal acceleration is towards the center, which is at (0,0), so the acceleration vector points in the negative x-direction. But that's opposite to the velocity, which is in positive x. But that's not perpendicular. That can't be right because centripetal acceleration is supposed to be perpendicular to velocity. Oh wait, I must have messed up the position and velocity directions.

Wait no, no. If the particle is moving in a circle, the velocity is tangential, so if the position is (r,0), the velocity would be upward, in the positive y-direction, not x. Because the tangent at (r,0) is vertical. Oh right! So I think I got the velocity direction wrong earlier. Let me correct this.

So, the particle is moving in a circle, radius 10m. Let's fix the position at (r, 0) at that instant. Then the velocity is upward, in the positive y-direction. The centripetal acceleration is towards the center, which is at (0,0), so from (r,0) to (0,0) is along the negative x-axis. Wait, but that can't be right because the velocity is along y, and centripetal is along x. So they are perpendicular. Oh! That makes sense.

So, in this case, the velocity vector is along positive y, and the centripetal acceleration is along negative x. The tangential acceleration is along the same direction as velocity, so positive y.

So, the acceleration vector a has two components: a_t (10 m/s²) in the positive y-direction, and a_c (10 m/s²) in the negative x-direction. So the acceleration vector is pointing in the second quadrant, with components (-10, 10) in x and y, respectively.

Now, the velocity vector is along positive y, so it's (0, v), where v is 10 m/s. The acceleration vector is (-10, 10) m/s².

Wait, no, the magnitude. Let me clarify: a_t is 10 m/s² in the positive y-direction, a_c is 10 m/s² in the negative x-direction. So a = (-10, 10) m/s².

The velocity vector v is (0, 10) m/s.

Wait, no, the speed is 10 m/s, so the velocity's magnitude is 10. So v is (0,10), and a is (-10,10).

Now, the angle between v and a can be found using the dot product. The dot product of v and a is (0)(-10) + (10)(10) = 0 + 100 = 100.

The magnitude of v is sqrt(0^2 +10^2)=10 m/s. The magnitude of a is sqrt( (-10)^2 +10^2 )=sqrt(200) =10√2 m/s².

So the dot product v·a = |v||a| cosθ => 100 = 10 * 10√2 * cosθ.

Simplify: 100 = 100√2 cosθ => cosθ = 100/(100√2) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071.

So the angle θ is arccos(1/√2) which is 45 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. Hmm, because the acceleration vector has a component in the y-direction (same as velocity) and a component in the x-direction (opposite to the position vector). So when I calculated the angle between v and a, I got 45 degrees. But looking at the components, a is (-10,10), so it's in the second quadrant. The velocity is (0,10), pointing straight up.

So the angle between them would be measured from the positive y-axis towards the acceleration vector, which is in the second quadrant. So the angle between them is 45 degrees, but wait, because the acceleration is at 135 degrees from the positive x-axis, and the velocity is at 90 degrees. The angle between them is 45 degrees.

Alternatively, using the dot product, the angle is 45 degrees. So the angle between velocity and acceleration is 45 degrees. But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the dot product is 100, which is |v||a| cosθ => 100 = 10 * 10√2 cosθ => 100 = 100√2 cosθ => cosθ = 1/√2, so θ=45 degrees.

So the answer should be F:45°, but wait, wait a minute. Because the acceleration vector is in the second quadrant, and the velocity is along positive y. So the angle between them is measured from the velocity vector towards the acceleration vector, which is 45 degrees west of up. So the angle is 45 degrees. So the correct answer should be F:45°.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the direction of the acceleration. Because the centripetal acceleration is towards the center, which is at (0,0), so if the particle is at (r,0), the centripetal acceleration is towards the center, which is along negative x. So a_c is (-10, 0)? No, wait, no. Wait, the centripetal acceleration is v²/r. So at the position (r,0), the velocity is upward (0, v), so the centripetal acceleration is towards the center, which is (0,0) from (r,0) is along (-r, 0), so a_c is (-v²/r, 0) => a_c is (-10, 0). Wait, that can't be, because earlier I thought it was in the x-direction. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no, that's not right. The centripetal acceleration is a vector pointing towards the center of the circle. So, at point (r, 0), it's pointing in the direction of (-1, 0), so only x-component. But velocity at that point is (0, v). So the centripetal acceleration is (-a_c, 0), and the tangential acceleration is (0, a_t). So the total acceleration is (-a_c, a_t). So that would be a vector pointing in the second quadrant, as I had before.

So, the acceleration vector is (-10, 10), and the velocity vector is (0,10). So when I take the dot product, I get 0*(-10) +10*10 =100. The magnitudes are 10 and 10√2, so cosθ=100/(10*10√2)=1/√2, so θ=45°. So the angle is 45 degrees.

So looking at the options, F is 45°, which should be the correct answer. 

Wait, but wait another thing. The angle between velocity and acceleration is 45°, but in the options, E is 90°. Is that the case? Because I thought if a_c and a_t are perpendicular, the angle between v and a would be 45°, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, because the acceleration has two perpendicular components. So the angle between v and a is determined by the ratio of a_c to the magnitude of a. Alternatively, the angle can be found using tanθ = a_c / a_t.

Wait, because if I imagine the acceleration vector as having components a_t along v and a_c perpendicular, then the angle θ between v and a is given by tanθ = (a_c) / (a_t). Since a_c and a_t are both 10, tanθ=1, so θ=45°, which matches our earlier calculation.

So yes, the angle is 45 degrees. So the correct option is F:45°.

The problem involves a particle moving in a circle with a radius of 10 meters. At a given instant, the particle's speed is 10 m/s, and its tangential acceleration is 10 m/s². The goal is to determine the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors.

In circular motion, the acceleration has two components:
1. **Tangential acceleration** (\(a_t\)): This is the rate of change of speed and is given as 10 m/s². It is directed along the velocity vector.
2. **Centripetal acceleration** (\(a_c\)): This is due to the change in direction of motion and is given by \(a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}\). Substituting \(v = 10 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(r = 10 \, \text{m}\), we find \(a_c = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2\). It is directed perpendicular to the velocity vector, towards the center of the circle.

The total acceleration vector is the vector sum of \(a_t\) and \(a_c\). Since \(a_t\) and \(a_c\) are perpendicular, the magnitude of the total acceleration is:
\[
|a| = \sqrt{a_t^2 + a_c^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) between the velocity vector and the acceleration vector can be determined using the relationship:
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{a_t}{|a|}.
\]
Substituting \(a_t = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2\) and \(|a| = 10\sqrt{2} \, \text{m/s}^2\):
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{10}{10\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Thus, \(\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 45^\circ\).

This calculation confirms that the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors is \(45^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: 45°**
