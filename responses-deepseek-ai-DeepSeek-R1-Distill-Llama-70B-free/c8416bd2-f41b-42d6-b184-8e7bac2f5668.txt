Question:

Late one evening, a police department received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who reported hearing loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Before his scheduled appearance, the husband files a motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison, contending that the evidence was illegally obtained. His motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the cereal box was not in plain sight during the search.
B: denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.
C: granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.
D: granted, because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.
E: denied, because the landlord gave the police permission to enter the apartment.
F: granted, because the police had no proof of the husband's involvement at the time of the search.
G: denied, because the fingerprint evidence was crucial to the investigation.
H: granted, because the police did not have the husband's consent to search his apartment.
I: denied, because the husband was not present during the search of his apartment.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is a murder investigation. A woman calls the police about hearing screams, and they find the homeowner dead. The murder weapon is a baseball bat with blood. The investigation points to the husband as a prime suspect. The police go to his apartment, get the landlord to let them in, search the place, and take a cereal box for fingerprints. The prints match those on the bat. Now, the husband is subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. He files a motion to suppress the fingerprint evidence, saying it was illegally obtained. The question is whether his motion should be granted or denied.

The options are A through J, but the choices given are A to I. So, I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, let's break down the legal issues here. The main issue seems to be whether the evidence (the cereal box and fingerprint comparison) was obtained legally. If it was obtained illegally, then the evidence might be suppressed.

The key points to consider are:

1. Was the search of the husband's apartment legal?
2. Can the evidence obtained from that search be used in the grand jury proceedings?
3. What about the exclusionary rule and whether it applies here?

Let's tackle each point.

1. Search of the Apartment:
   The police entered the apartment with the landlord's permission. But wait, the landlord giving permission to enter a tenant's apartmentâ€”does that make the search legal? I remember that a landlord can't give consent for a search of a tenant's premises unless the landlord has common authority over the area. Typically, once a tenant takes possession, the landlord can't consent to a search unless there's some sort of emergency or they have a right to enter (like for repairs or showing the property, but that's more about tenancy than giving consent for police searches).

   So, if the police entered without a warrant and without the husband's consent, but with the landlord's consent, was that legal? I think the Supreme Court case of Chapman v. United States (1991) might be relevant here, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, cases like Stoner v. California might come into play. In Stoner, the court held that a hotel manager couldn't consent to a search of a guest's room because the guest has exclusive control. So, similarly, a landlord can't give consent for the tenant's apartment if the tenant has exclusive control.

   So, the warrantless search without the tenant's consent, even with the landlord's permission, is probably unconstitutional. That would make the search illegal.

2. Exclusionary Rule and Grand Juries:
   Next, the evidence was presented to the grand jury. The question is whether the exclusionary rule applies in grand jury proceedings. The exclusionary rule generally applies in criminal trials to exclude evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. But does it apply to grand jury proceedings?

   From what I remember, the Supreme Court case United States v. Calandra (1974) held that the exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings in the same way as it does at trial. The grand jury's role is to determine whether there's enough evidence to indict, and it's more of an investigative body. So even if evidence was obtained illegally, it can still be presented to the grand jury. However, if the grand jury indicts based on that evidence and it's used at trial, then the defendant can move to suppress it at trial.

   So, in this case, the husband is trying to suppress the evidence during the grand jury phase. But under Calandra, the exclusionary rule doesn't bar the use of such evidence before the grand jury. Therefore, the grand jury can consider the evidence, even if it was obtained illegally.

Putting it together: The search was likely illegal because the landlord couldn't consent, so the evidence was obtained unconstitutionally. But in the grand jury context, the exclusionary rule doesn't apply, so the evidence isn't suppressed there. Therefore, the husband's motion to suppress would be denied in the grand jury proceeding.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the motion should be denied because the exclusionary rule hasn't been extended to grand jury hearings. That aligns with Calandra.

Option D suggests the motion should be granted because the warrantless search was unconstitutional. While the search was indeed unconstitutional, the evidence can still be used before the grand jury because the exclusionary rule doesn't apply there. So the motion wouldn't be granted on those grounds in this context.

Option E says it's denied because the landlord gave permission. But as I thought earlier, the landlord's consent doesn't make it legal if the tenant has exclusive control. So E is incorrect.

Option H says granted because no consent from husband. But again, even if the search was illegal, the evidence can still be used in grand jury, so the motion wouldn't be granted.

So the correct answer is B: denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.

The question revolves around whether the husband's motion to suppress evidence obtained from a warrantless search of his apartment should be granted. The key legal issues are the legality of the search and the applicability of the exclusionary rule in grand jury proceedings.

1. **Legality of the Search**:  
   The police entered the husband's apartment with the landlord's consent but without a warrant or the husband's permission. Under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, a landlord generally cannot consent to a search of a tenant's apartment if the tenant has exclusive control over the premises. This makes the search likely unconstitutional.

2. **Exclusionary Rule and Grand Jury Proceedings**:  
   While the exclusionary rule excludes illegally obtained evidence in criminal trials, the Supreme Court has held in *United States v. Calandra* (1974) that the exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings. The grand jury's role is investigative, and it may consider evidence even if obtained unlawfully. Therefore, the husband's motion to suppress the evidence in this context would be denied.

Analyzing the options:  
- **Option B** correctly states that the motion should be denied because the exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury hearings.  
- Other options, such as **D** and **H**, focus on the illegality of the search but fail to account for the inapplicability of the exclusionary rule in this specific context.  
- **Option E** incorrectly assumes the landlord's consent made the search legal, which is not the case when the tenant has exclusive control.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.**

Answer: B
