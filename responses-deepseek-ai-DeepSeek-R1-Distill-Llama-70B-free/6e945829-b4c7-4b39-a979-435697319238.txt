Okay, so I've got this question about Buddhism and the "Flower Sermon." I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what I remember from my studies.

First, I remember that Buddhism has several different schools or traditions. The options given are Nichiren, Jodo Shinshu, Theravada, Chan-Zen, Pure Land, Tibetan, Shingon, Vajrayana, Yogicara, Tendai, and Madhyamaka. Wait, no, looking back, the options are A to J, so I think the last one is Tendai.

The question is about the "Flower Sermon." I'm trying to recall what I know about this. I think the Flower Sermon is a significant event in Buddhist history. From what I remember, it's associated with a particular school that emphasizes meditation and direct transmission of teachings without relying on scriptures.

Wait, wasn't the Flower Sermon when the Buddha held up a flower and smiled, and only Mahakashyapa understood? That story is often linked to the beginning of Zen Buddhism. So, if that's the case, the Flower Sermon would be associated with Zen, which is known as Chan in Chinese and Zen in Japanese.

Looking at the options, option D is Chan-Zen. So that would make sense because Chan is the Chinese term and Zen is the Japanese version of the same school. So the answer should be D.

But wait, another thought. The Tendai school, option J, is another major school. I think Tendai is more about the Lotus Sutra and the idea that all beings can attain Buddhahood. But I don't think the Flower Sermon is specifically tied to Tendai. It's more of a Zen thing.

So putting it together, the Flower Sermon is a Zen/Chan tradition event, so the answer is D: Chan-Zen.

The "Flower Sermon" is associated with the Chan-Zen school of Buddhism. This event, where the Buddha held up a flower and smiled, symbolizing direct transmission of teachings, is central to Zen tradition.
