Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following governmental report.
Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.
—Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651
Which of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?

Options:

A: The development of a welfare system to support those in need
B: The increase in population during the seventeenth century leading to more workers in the field
C: The discovery of new trade routes that brought in more food
D: The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century
E: The introduction of new crops from the New World during the Columbian Exchange
F: The implementation of a universal basic income
G: The elimination of the Black Plague in Europe during the seventeenth century
H: The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work
I: A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized

Okay, so I have this history question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The report is from the Estates of Normandy in 1651 and describes a severe famine situation. People are dying, eating mice, roots, and even the bodies of diseased animals. The problem is about hunger and starvation in this region at that time.

The question asks which option would be most responsible for ending the hunger problems mentioned. The options are A through I, each suggesting a different historical factor.

I need to think about what causes famines and what solutions could alleviate such situations. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Development of a welfare system. Welfare systems can provide immediate relief, like food distribution, which might help in the short term. But the report mentions that the inhabitants couldn't relieve the 450 sick, so maybe a welfare system could help, but would it solve the underlying issue? Maybe not the root cause, but it could reduce the immediate suffering.

Option B: Increase in population leading to more workers. Wait, more people might mean more labor, but if there's a famine, having more mouths to feed could worsen the problem. Also, in the 17th century, population increases could strain resources, so I don't think this would help. In fact, it might make things worse.

Option C: Discovery of new trade routes bringing in more food. That sounds plausible. If new trade routes can import food, it could alleviate shortages. But in 1651, how feasible was that? Europe was still recovering from the Thirty Years' War, and global trade wasn't as extensive. Maybe, but perhaps not the most direct solution.

Option D: Elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution. Fallow fields were part of the crop rotation system. The agricultural revolution, which I think happened more in the 18th century, introduced new farming techniques. If they stopped leaving fields fallow, that could increase crop yields. But the agricultural revolution in the 17th century? I think the big changes came later, so maybe this isn't the right time period.

Option E: Introduction of new crops from the New World during the Columbian Exchange. Oh, right! The Columbian Exchange brought crops like potatoes, maize, and beans to Europe. These crops are high-yield and can grow in different conditions. They contributed to population growth and better nutrition. If these crops were introduced, they would increase food production, which could prevent famines. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option F: Implementation of universal basic income. That's a modern concept. In 1651, such policies didn't exist, so this isn't relevant to the historical context here.

Option G: Elimination of the Black Plague. The Black Death was in the 14th century, way before 1651. By the 17th century, the plague still occurred but wasn't as widespread. Eliminating it would reduce disease deaths but wouldn't directly solve hunger unless it's causing labor shortages. I'm not sure if this is the main solution here.

Option H: Creation of a strong putting-out system. The putting-out system was part of the early stages of industrialization, where merchants provided materials to cottage workers. This relates to industry, not agriculture or food production. So it might not directly address the famine.

Option I: Declining population leading to better yields. If the population decreases, there's less demand for food, but in the 17th century, Europe was actually starting to recover from the plague and wars. A declining population might help in the short term, but if the population is too low, labor for farming might decrease, reducing yields. Plus, the report doesn't indicate that the population is declining; it's more about the current suffering.

So, putting it all together. The problem is severe hunger and famine. The options that address increasing food availability are C, D, E. Option E, introducing new crops, seems like a solid long-term solution. New crops would increase yields and make food more abundant, thus preventing such famines.

Wait, but when did the Columbian Exchange happen? It started in the late 15th century, so by 1651, some of these crops might have been already integrated. But their full impact on population and food security probably took time. So introducing these crops would have been an ongoing process, and by the 17th century, they could have significantly improved food production.

Alternatively, option A, a welfare system, would help in the short term but doesn't solve the underlying food shortage. The question asks what would be most responsible for ending the problems, implying a more permanent solution.

So, the best answer would be E: The introduction of new crops from the New World during the Columbian Exchange.

The question refers to a governmental report from 1651 describing a severe famine in Normandy, where people are starving and resorting to eating mice, roots, and even diseased animal bodies. The task is to determine which option would most effectively end the hunger problems described.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Development of a welfare system** could provide immediate relief but does not address the root cause of food scarcity.
- **B: Increase in population** would likely worsen the problem by increasing the number of mouths to feed.
- **C: Discovery of new trade routes** could bring in more food, but the feasibility of this in 1651 is questionable due to limited global trade infrastructure.
- **D: Elimination of fallow fields** might increase crop yields, but the agricultural revolution that introduced such changes occurred later, primarily in the 18th century.
- **E: Introduction of new crops from the New World** is a strong candidate. Crops like potatoes, maize, and beans, introduced during the Columbian Exchange, significantly increased food production and nutrition in Europe over time, making this a long-term solution.
- **F: Universal basic income** is a modern concept and irrelevant to the 17th-century context.
- **G: Elimination of the Black Plague** occurred earlier and would not directly solve hunger.
- **H: Putting-out system** relates to industry, not agriculture, and does not address food production.
- **I: Declining population** might reduce demand but could also lower labor for farming, and the report does not indicate a population decline.

The most effective solution is **E**, as the introduction of high-yield crops from the New World would permanently increase food availability and prevent future famines.

Answer: E
