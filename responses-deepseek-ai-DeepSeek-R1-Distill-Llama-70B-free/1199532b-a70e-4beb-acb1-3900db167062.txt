Alright, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically personal injury in a movie theater. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the situation is that a seat in the theater collapsed, causing the customer to fall and hurt their back. The customer is suing the theater for personal injury. The question is about whether the customer will recover damages and under what circumstances.

First, I need to recall the legal principles involved here. This sounds like a premises liability case. Premises liability holds property owners responsible for injuries caused by unsafe conditions on their property. The duty of care that the property owner owes depends on the status of the person entering the property.

In this case, the customer is an invitee because they entered the theater for a business purpose—movie theaters make money from ticket sales, so customers are invitees. As an invitee, the theater has a duty to ensure the premises are reasonably safe, correct any known dangers, and conduct regular inspections to uncover any hidden dangers.

So, the theater's duty includes inspecting the premises to find any unsafe conditions and either fixing them or warning customers about them. If the theater knew or should have known about a dangerous condition (like a broken seat) and failed to address it, they could be liable for negligence.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the customer can't recover because they assumed the risk by sitting. But I don't think assumption of risk applies here unless the customer was aware of the danger and chose to sit anyway, which isn't indicated in the question. So A is probably not correct.

Option B suggests the customer must have informed the theater about the faulty seat before. I don't think prior notification is necessary. The theater's duty is to inspect and find such issues, not rely on customers to report them. So B seems incorrect.

Option C says recovery is only possible if there were previous complaints. That's too narrow. The theater could be liable even without prior complaints if they failed to inspect properly. So C might not be the right answer.

Option D mentions failing to put up a warning sign. If the theater knew about the faulty seat, they should warn, but the question doesn't specify whether they knew. It might be part of negligence, but the option seems to present it as a condition, which might not be the only factor. So D could be a contender, but I'm not sure.

Option E states that prior knowledge by the theater is needed. That's one possibility, but the theater could also be liable for failing to discover the issue through reasonable inspection, even without prior knowledge. So E might be too restrictive.

Option F says recovery is possible only if the customer proves the theater's negligence in maintenance. That sounds right because premises liability often hinges on showing the owner was negligent—failing to inspect or repair. So F seems correct.

Option G suggests the customer can recover if the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection. This aligns with the duty to inspect, so G could also be correct. But wait, the question is about what's needed for the customer to recover. If the theater didn't inspect reasonably, that's negligence, so G is a condition for recovery. Hmm, so F and G are both about negligence, but phrased differently.

Option H says no recovery without permanent injury, but I don't think that's the case. Even if the injury isn't permanent, the customer can recover for pain, medical expenses, etc. So H is incorrect.

Option I states the theater had no obligation to inspect. That's wrong because, as an invitee, the theater does have a duty to inspect for unknown dangers. So I is incorrect.

Wait, so back to F and G. Option F says the customer must prove the theater's negligence in maintaining. Option G says the customer recovers unless the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection, which is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Premises liability for invitees requires the plaintiff to show that the owner (1) knew or should have known about the danger, (2) failed to take reasonable steps to fix it or warn, and (3) that this failure caused the injury.

In this case, the seat collapsing indicates a dangerous condition. The theater's duty includes regular inspections. If they didn't inspect and a dangerous condition existed, that's negligence. So the customer must prove that the theater was negligent, which would involve showing that a reasonable inspection would have found the problem and that the theater failed to do so.

Option F says the customer must prove the theater's negligence in maintaining, which would include inspection and repair. Option G says the customer can recover unless the theater did a reasonable inspection. So if the theater didn't inspect reasonably, then the customer can recover. But if the theater did a reasonable inspection and still missed it, then maybe not.

Wait, but in G, the wording is "not recover, unless the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection." So if the theater failed to inspect reasonably, the customer can recover. That makes sense because the theater's duty is to inspect reasonably. So if they didn't, that's a breach of duty, leading to liability.

But then, the question is whether the customer can recover. So the correct answer would be that the customer can recover if the theater failed to inspect reasonably, which is negligence.

Option F says the customer recovers if the theater was negligent in maintaining. So both F and G are about negligence, but phrased differently.

Wait, perhaps F is more accurate because it's about proving negligence in maintenance, which could include inspection. But G is about the failure to inspect. So which one is the correct standard?

I think the key is that the theater has a duty to inspect. If they fail to inspect, that's a breach. So the customer can recover if the theater failed to inspect (G). Alternatively, the customer must prove the theater was negligent in maintaining, which would include failing to inspect.

Hmm, but the options are about what the customer needs to do. So F says the customer must prove negligence in maintenance, which would require showing that the theater didn't maintain properly, which could include not inspecting.

But perhaps the more accurate answer is F because it's about the theater's negligence, which includes failing to inspect. Alternatively, G is about whether the theater inspected, which is a part of negligence.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the customer will most likely..." So which option aligns with the necessary elements.

In a premises liability case, the plaintiff must show that the defendant breached their duty, which in this case would involve failing to inspect or maintain the premises properly.

So, the correct answer would be F: recover if the customer can prove the theater's negligence in maintaining the seat.

Wait, but another angle: if the theater had no actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition, can they still be liable? Under premises liability, the owner can be liable for failing to discover the condition through reasonable inspection, which is a form of negligence.

So, the customer doesn't need to prove that the theater knew about the specific seat being broken, but rather that a reasonable inspection would have found it, and the theater failed to do so.

So, that's negligence, which is what option F is about. Therefore, the customer must prove the theater's negligence in maintaining, which includes inspecting.

So the correct answer is F.

In this case, the customer is suing the movie theater for injuries caused by a collapsing seat. This is a premises liability issue, where the theater, as the property owner, owes a duty of care to its customers, who are considered invitees. The theater's duty includes ensuring the premises are reasonably safe, correcting known dangers, and conducting regular inspections to uncover hidden dangers.

The customer does not need to prove that the theater had prior knowledge of the faulty seat. Instead, the theater can be held liable for failing to discover the dangerous condition through reasonable inspection, which constitutes negligence. The customer must show that the theater breached its duty by failing to maintain the premises properly, which includes inspecting for and addressing unsafe conditions.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Assumption of risk does not apply unless the customer was aware of the danger and chose to sit anyway, which is not indicated.
- **B**: Incorrect. Prior notification by the customer is not required; the theater's duty includes inspecting for dangers.
- **C**: Incorrect. Recovery is not limited to cases where there were previous complaints; the theater can be liable for failing to inspect.
- **D**: Incorrect. While failing to warn could be part of negligence, it is not the sole condition for liability.
- **E**: Incorrect. The theater can be liable even without prior knowledge if it failed to discover the danger through reasonable inspection.
- **F**: Correct. The customer must prove the theater's negligence in maintaining the seat, which includes failing to inspect or repair.
- **G**: Incorrect. While failing to inspect is part of negligence, the customer must still prove the theater's breach of duty, which goes beyond just inspection.
- **H**: Incorrect. Recovery does not depend on the injury being permanent; damages can include pain and medical expenses.
- **I**: Incorrect. The theater has a duty to inspect for unknown dangers as part of premises liability.

The correct answer is **F**, as the customer must prove the theater's negligence in maintaining the seat, which includes failing to inspect or repair the dangerous condition.

Answer: F
