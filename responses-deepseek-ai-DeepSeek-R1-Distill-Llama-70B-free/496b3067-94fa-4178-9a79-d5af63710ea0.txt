Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because equilibrium constants aren't my strongest area. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the equilibrium constant for the reaction CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 at 77°F. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium constant, K, depends on the temperature. So first, I should probably convert that temperature into Kelvin because most standard data is in Kelvin.

Wait, how do I convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin? Oh right, first convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and then to Kelvin. The formula is K = (°F - 32) × 5/9 + 273.15. Let me calculate that. So 77°F minus 32 is 45. Multiply by 5/9, which is 25. Then add 273.15, so 25 + 273.15 is 298.15 K. Oh, that's room temperature, around 25°C. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, I need to find the standard equilibrium constant K at this temperature. I remember that K is related to the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) by the equation ΔG° = -RT ln K. But wait, I think I might need the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) for each substance involved.

So I should look up the ΔGf° values for each reactant and product. Let me try to recall or imagine some standard tables. 

The reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

So the ΔG° for the reaction is the sum of the products' ΔGf° minus the sum of the reactants' ΔGf°.

Wait, what are the standard ΔGf° values? I think:

- CO(g): I recall it's about -110 kJ/mol. Or wait, no, maybe -110 is the enthalpy of formation. Hmm. Or wait, maybe CO is around -110 kJ for ΔGf°. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the ΔGf° for CO is actually positive. Because CO is less stable than its elements. Oh wait, the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for CO is about -110,000 J/mol? No, wait, no. Let me think. For elements in their standard state, ΔGf° is zero. So for CO, which is a compound, it's not zero.

Wait, I might have this mixed up. Let me try to think of specific values. For example, the ΔGf° for CO is about -110,000 J/mol? No, wait, I think it's -110,000 J/mol would be -110 kJ/mol. But wait, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the enthalpy of formation.

Maybe I should list the known ΔGf° values:

- CO(g): I think it's around -110 kJ/mol (but I'm not 100% sure).
- H2O(l): I remember this is about -237 kJ/mol.
- CO2(g): That's definitely a more stable molecule, so I think it's around -394 kJ/mol.
- H2(g): As an element, it's zero.

Wait, but wait, the state matters. In the reaction, H2O is a reactant, but is it liquid or gas? The problem says to assume ideal gas behavior, so maybe H2O is in the gas phase. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, the reaction as written is CO (g) + H2O (l?) → CO2 (g) + H2 (g). Or perhaps H2O is gas? Because in the problem statement, it's written as H2O without (g), but that's not standard. Oh wait, perhaps in this reaction, H2O is in the gas phase. Because if it's liquid, the calculation would be different.

Wait, let me clarify. For the reaction, are all the reactants and products gases? Because the problem says to assume ideal gas behavior, which suggests that all are gases. So H2O would be in the gas phase here. So I need the ΔGf° for H2O(g).

Wait, what's the ΔGf° for H2O(g)? I think it's about -229 kJ/mol. Because the liquid is about -237, and the gas would be a bit higher (less negative) since going from liquid to gas requires energy (endothermic). So, perhaps H2O(g) is around -229 kJ/mol.

Wait, let me make a table:

Substance | ΔGf° (kJ/mol)
--- | ---
CO(g) | -110
H2O(g) | -229
CO2(g) | -394
H2(g) | 0

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely confident about the CO value. Maybe I should double-check mentally. CO is formed from C(graphite) and O2(g). The reaction is C(s) + ½ O2(g) → CO(g). What's the ΔGf° for CO? I think it's around -110 kJ/mol. Or wait, no, maybe it's positive. Because CO is a stable compound but perhaps its formation is endothermic? Hmm, I'm not sure, but I'll proceed with -110 for now.

So the reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

The ΔG° for the reaction is [CO2 + H2] - [CO + H2O] = [(-394) + 0] - [(-110) + (-229)].

Calculating that: (-394 + 0) = -394. The reactants sum is (-110) + (-229) = -339. So ΔG° = (-394) - (-339) = -394 + 339 = -55 kJ.

Wait, that's a negative ΔG°, which means the reaction is spontaneous at standard conditions, which makes sense because CO and H2O form more stable CO2 and H2.

Wait, but wait, wait—am I doing the calculation correctly? The formula is ΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants). So for products, CO2 and H2. CO2 is -394, H2 is 0. So sum is -394. Reactants: CO (-110) and H2O (-229). Sum is -339. So ΔG° = (-394) - (-339) = -55 kJ. Yes, that's correct.

So ΔG° is -55,000 J (since it's -55 kJ). Now, the formula relating ΔG° to K is ΔG° = -RT ln K. We can rearrange to solve for K: ln K = -ΔG°/(RT).

Wait, but wait, I have ΔG° as -55,000 J/mol. So plug into the equation:

ΔG° = -RT ln K → ln K = -ΔG°/(RT) = -(-55000) / (R T).

R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/mol·K. T is 298 K (from earlier). So:

ln K = 55000 / (8.314 * 298).

Let me calculate the denominator first: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.772.

So 55000 / 2477.772 ≈ let's see: 2477.772 × 22 is approx 54,500 (since 2477.77 *20=49555.4; 2477.77*2=4955.54 → total 54510.98). So 22 gives around 54,510. So 55000 would be 22.23 approximately.

So ln K ≈ 22.23. To find K, we exponentiate both sides: K = e^22.23.

Wait, e^22 is a huge number. Let me think, e^10 is about 22026, e^20 is approx 4.85e8, e^22 is e^20 * e^2 → 4.85e8 * 7.389 ≈ 3.58e9. But wait, let me calculate e^22.23 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated ΔG°. Let me re-express the reaction. The reaction is CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g).

Wait, I took ΔGf° for H2O as -229 kJ/mol. Is that correct? Because if H2O is a gas, yes, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again: standard ΔGf° for H2O(l) is -237, and H2O(g) is about -229. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recompute ΔG°. So for the reaction:

CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g)

ΔG° = [ΔGf°(CO2) + ΔGf°(H2)] - [ΔGf°(CO) + ΔGf°(H2O)]

So plugging numbers:

ΔG° = [(-394) + 0] - [(-110) + (-229)] = (-394) - (-339) = (-394) + 339 = -55 kJ.

Yes, that's correct. So ΔG° is -55,000 J.

Thus, ln K = 55000 / (8.314 * 298) ≈ 55000 / 2477.77 ≈ 22.21.

Wait, but 8.314 * 298 = let me compute exactly.

8 * 298 = 2384, 0.314 * 298 ≈ 93.772 → total 2384 +93.772=2477.772 J/mol.

So 55000 / 2477.772 = let's compute that.

2477.772 × 22 = 54,511.04.

55000 -54511.04 = 488.96.

So 22 + (488.96 / 2477.772) → 488.96 / 2477.772 ≈ 0.1974.

So ln K ≈ 22.1974 → approximately 22.20.

So K = e^22.20.

Now, e^22 is about 3,584,913,384 (since e^10 ≈ 22026, e^20 = (e^10)^2 ≈ 22026^2 ≈ 4.8e8, but exact value is about 4.851652e8. So e^22 = e^20 * e^2 ≈ 4.851652e8 * 7.38906 ≈ 3.586e9.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute e^22.197 more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use natural logs to find K.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that ln K ≈ 22.2, so K ≈ e^22.2 ≈ 3.6e9. But wait, that seems way too high, and the options given are all in the thousands, up to 130,000.

Wait, this can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait a minute, maybe I messed up the reaction direction. Because if K is 3.6e9, that's a huge number, but the options are all around 1e5. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for ΔG°.

Wait, the reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

So, the products are CO2 and H2. Their ΔGf° are -394 and 0.

The reactants are CO and H2O. Their ΔGf° are -110 and -229.

So ΔG° = (-394 + 0) - (-110 -229) = (-394) - (-339) = (-394) + 339 = -55 kJ. So that's correct.

Hmm. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction is written in reverse? Because when I think about the equilibrium constant for CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, perhaps it's more likely that the K is around 1e5 or less.

Wait, but the calculation suggests a very large K. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the sign in the ΔG° equation. Because ΔG° = -RT ln K.

So ln K = -ΔG°/(RT). Wait, ΔG° is negative, so -ΔG° is positive. So ln K is positive, which makes K greater than 1.

Wait, but in my calculation, I had ΔG° as -55,000 J, so ln K = 55000/(8.314*298) ≈ 22.2, so K ≈ e^22.2 ≈ 3.6e9, which is not among the options. So that can't be right.

But the options are all between 45,000 and 130,000. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have used ΔG° in kJ instead of J. Let me check that.

ΔG° is -55,000 J, which is -55 kJ. So when plugging into the equation, perhaps I should have used -55,000 J, but R is in J/mol·K, so the units are correct.

Wait, but perhaps I used the wrong value for ΔG°. Maybe I should have considered the reverse reaction, which would make ΔG° positive 55,000 J.

Wait, because if the reaction as written has a ΔG° of -55,000 J, that means it's spontaneous, so K would be large. But if I had the reverse reaction, then ΔG° would be +55,000 J, and K would be small. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔGf° values. Let me try to look up the correct standard Gibbs free energies of formation.

Wait, from memory, the correct values are:

CO(g): ΔGf° = -110.5 kJ/mol
H2O(l): ΔGf° = -237.1 kJ/mol
H2O(g): ΔGf° = -228.6 kJ/mol
CO2(g): ΔGf° = -394.4 kJ/mol
H2(g): 0

Wait, so in the reaction, if H2O is a gas, then I should use -228.6 kJ/mol.

So let's recalculate ΔG°:

ΔG° = [CO2 + H2] - [CO + H2O(g)].

So that's (-394.4 + 0) - [(-110.5) + (-228.6)] = (-394.4) - (-339.1) = (-394.4) + 339.1 = (-55.3) kJ.

So ΔG° ≈ -55,300 J.

So ln K = (-ΔG°)/(RT) = 55300 / (8.314 * 298).

Compute denominator: 8.314 * 298 = 2477.772 J/mol.

So 55300 / 2477.772 ≈ let's compute this.

2477.772 × 22 = 54,511. So 55300 -54511 = 789.

So 22 + (789 / 2477.772) ≈ 22 + 0.3188 ≈ 22.3188.

So ln K ≈ 22.32.

So K = e^22.32 ≈ e^22 * e^0.32.

We know e^22 is about 3,584,913,384 as before, and e^0.32 ≈ 1.377.

So K ≈ 3.584e9 * 1.377 ≈ 4.93e9.

Wait, that's even bigger. But the options are much smaller. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I have the reaction reversed. Because in some cases, the reaction is written as CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O. Let me check what the standard reaction is.

Wait, the reaction CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 is known as the water gas shift reaction. And I think that at lower temperatures, the equilibrium favors CO2 and H2, so K is large. But according to my calculation, K is about 5e9, but the options are way lower.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔGf° values. Maybe I should double-check them.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the units. Let me confirm the standard ΔGf° values.

Upon checking (hypothetically, since I can't look it up right now), the correct ΔGf° values are:

CO(g): -110.5 kJ/mol
H2O(g): -228.6 kJ/mol
CO2(g): -394.4 kJ/mol
H2(g): 0

So the calculation seems correct, which gives a very large K. But the options don't go that high. The highest option is D:130,000. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the reaction in the reverse direction. Let me consider that.

If the reaction is written as CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O, then the ΔG° would be +55,300 J. Then, ln K would be -55,300/(8.314*298) ≈ -55,300/2477.77 ≈ -22.32. So K would be e^(-22.32) ≈ 1.7e-10, which is a very small number, but again, not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong units for R. Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but sometimes, it's written as 8.314 kJ/mol·K when using kJ. Wait, no, 8.314 J/mol·K is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me recheck the reaction equation.

The problem says CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. So the stoichiometry is correct as 1 mole each.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2O is in the liquid state. Let's try that.

If H2O is liquid, then ΔGf° for H2O(l) is -237.1 kJ/mol.

So recomputing ΔG°:

ΔG° = [CO2 (g) + H2 (g)] - [CO(g) + H2O(l)] → [(-394.4) + 0] - [(-110.5) + (-237.1)] = (-394.4) -
