Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that one gram of an unknown gaseous compound of boron and hydrogen occupies 0.820 liters at 1.00 atm and 276 K. I need to find the molecular formula from the given options.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should calculate the number of moles of this compound. Since it's a gas, maybe I can use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So I can solve for n, which is moles. Got it.

Given:
Pressure P = 1.00 atm
Volume V = 0.820 L
Temperature T = 276 K
The gas is one gram, so mass m = 1.0 g. But to find moles, I'll need the molar mass later.

First, let's plug in the values into the ideal gas equation. R is the gas constant. I think the value of R that fits these units is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), because when using atm, liters, and Kelvin, R is 0.0821.

So rearranging the ideal gas law to solve for n:
n = (P V) / (R T)

Plugging in the numbers:
n = (1.00 atm * 0.820 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 276 K)

Let me calculate the denominator first. 0.0821 * 276. Let's see:

Calculating 0.0821 * 276:
276 * 0.08 is 22.08, and 276 * 0.0021 is approximately 0.5796. So together, about 22.08 + 0.5796 = 22.6596.

So the denominator is approximately 22.66.

Then numerator is 1.00 * 0.820 = 0.820.

So n ≈ 0.820 / 22.66 = Let's see, maybe around 0.0362 moles? Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

0.820 / 22.66 ≈ 0.0362 mol. So n is approximately 0.0362 moles.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation.

Alternatively, 22.66 times 0.036 is about 0.817, which is close to 0.820. So 0.0362 is a good approximation.

So n ≈ 0.0362 moles.

But wait, that's the number of moles of the gaseous compound. Now, the mass of this compound is 1.0 gram. So the molar mass (M) is mass divided by moles.

M = mass / n = 1.0 g / 0.0362 mol ≈ 27.62 g/mol.

So the molar mass of the compound is approximately 27.62 grams per mole.

Now, I need to find out the molecular formula of the compound made of boron (B) and hydrogen (H) that has this molar mass.

Let me think about the possible formulas given in the options. Let's list the options and their molar masses.

Option C: BH3. Boron is 10.8, H is 1.0 each. So 10.8 + 3*1.0 = 13.8 g/mol. That's much lower than 27.6.

Option E: B2H4. Molar mass would be 2*10.8 + 4*1 = 21.6 +4=25.6 g/mol. Closer, but still lower than 27.6.

Option B: B3H6. Molar mass is 3*10.8 +6*1= 32.4 +6=38.4 g/mol. That's higher than 27.6.

Option F: B2H6. 2*10.8=21.6, 6*1=6. Total is 27.6 g/mol. Oh, that's exactly what we need.

Wait, but let me check all the options to be sure.

Option A: B6H6. 6*10.8=64.8 +6=70.8. Way too high.

Option D: B4H10. 4*10.8=43.2 +10=53.2. No.

Option G: B10H14. 10*10.8=108 +14=122. Way too high.

Option H: B2H2. 2*10.8=21.6 +2=23.6. Lower than needed.

Option I: BH. 10.8 +1=11.8. Too low.

Option J: B5H9.5*10.8=54 +9=63. No.

Wait, looking back, option F is B2H6. Its molar mass is 2*(10.8) +6*(1.0) =21.6+6=27.6 g/mol, which matches our calculated value of 27.62. So that's the one.

But wait, I thought diborane was B2H6, which is option F. So the answer should be F.

But looking back at the options, another thought: Option E is B2H4 (molar mass 25.6), which is close but not matching. Option F is B2H6, which fits.

So the molecular formula is B2H6, which is option F.

To determine the molecular formula of the unknown gaseous compound of boron (B) and hydrogen (H), we start by calculating the number of moles of the compound using the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

Given:
- \( P = 1.00 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( V = 0.820 \, \text{L} \)
- \( T = 276 \, \text{K} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{(1.00)(0.820)}{(0.0821)(276)} \approx \frac{0.820}{22.66} \approx 0.0362 \, \text{mol}
\]

Next, the molar mass (\( M \)) of the compound is calculated using the mass (\( m = 1.0 \, \text{g} \)) and the number of moles (\( n \)):

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{moles}} = \frac{1.0}{0.0362} \approx 27.62 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Now, we evaluate the molar masses of the given options to identify the compound with a molar mass close to \( 27.62 \, \text{g/mol} \):

- **Option A: \( \text{B}_6\text{H}_6 \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 6(10.8) + 6(1.0) = 70.8 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Too high.

- **Option B: \( \text{B}_3\text{H}_6 \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 3(10.8) + 6(1.0) = 38.4 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Too high.

- **Option C: \( \text{BH}_3 \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 10.8 + 3(1.0) = 13.8 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Too low.

- **Option D: \( \text{B}_4\text{H}_{10} \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 4(10.8) + 10(1.0) = 53.2 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Too high.

- **Option E: \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_4 \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 2(10.8) + 4(1.0) = 25.6 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Close but slightly lower.

- **Option F: \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_6 \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 2(10.8) + 6(1.0) = 27.6 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Matches the calculated molar mass.

- **Option G: \( \text{B}_{10}\text{H}_{14} \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 10(10.8) + 14(1.0) = 122.0 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Too high.

- **Option H: \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_2 \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 2(10.8) + 2(1.0) = 23.6 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Too low.

- **Option I: \( \text{BH} \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 10.8 + 1.0 = 11.8 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Too low.

- **Option J: \( \text{B}_5\text{H}_9 \)**  
  Molar mass: \( 5(10.8) + 9(1.0) = 63.0 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
  Too high.

The compound with a molar mass of \( 27.6 \, \text{g/mol} \), matching the calculated value, is \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_6 \) (diborane).
