Question:

If the cost of the basket of goods and services the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to calculate the consumer price index rises from $200 in the base period to $400 in the current period then the consumer price index

Options:

A: has risen 5 percent from the base to the current period.
B: equals 100 in the current period.
C: equals 50 in the current period.
D: equals 0.5 in the current period.
E: has risen 200 percent from the base to the current period.
F: equals 200 in the current period.
G: equals 300 in the current period.
H: has fallen 50 percent from the base to the current period.
I: equals 400 in the current period.

Okay, so I've got this question about the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about CPI.

From what I remember, the CPI is a measure used to assess the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services that a typical household might purchase. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) puts this together. The base period is a reference point, usually a specific year, and the CPI for that base year is set at 100.

So the question here is about how the CPI changes when the cost of the basket increases. The setup is that in the base period, the basket costs $200, and in the current period, it's $400. The question is asking what the CPI would be in the current period.

Wait, how is the CPI calculated again? I think the formula involves comparing the current period's basket cost to the base period's. Specifically, the CPI is calculated as (Cost of Basket in Current Period / Cost in Base Period) multiplied by 100. So it's (Current / Base) * 100.

In this case, the base period's cost is $200, which is why the base CPI is 100. Now, the current period's cost is $400. Plugging these into the formula: (400 / 200) * 100. Let's calculate that—400 divided by 200 is 2, multiplied by 100 gives 200. So the CPI in the current period is 200.

Looking at the options, option F says "equals 200 in the current period." That must be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything.

Another thing I should consider: sometimes people confuse CPI with inflation rates. So, for example, if the CPI goes from 100 to 200, that means there's been a 100% increase in prices, right? But the question isn't asking about the percentage increase; it's asking for the CPI value itself. So the right answer is F.

Let me quickly go through the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Option A says a 5% rise, which would be way too low. Option E says a 200% rise, which would actually be correct in terms of percentage increase (since 200 is triple the base, which is 100, so 100% increase, wait wait, no—wait, base is 100, so going to 200 is a 100% increase, not 200%. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong earlier. Oh wait, no, the base is 100, so if it's 200 now, the increase is 100 points, which is 100% of the base. So a 100% increase. So option E says 200%, which would be incorrect. So E is wrong.

Option I says equals 400. Wait, but the CPI isn't the actual price, it's an index. So 400 would be the actual cost, but the index is 200. So I is incorrect.

Option F is 200, which matches our calculation. So yeah, I think F is correct.
</think>

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{CPI} = \left( \frac{\text{Cost of Basket in Current Period}}{\text{Cost of Basket in Base Period}} \right) \times 100
\]

In this scenario, the base period cost is $200, and the current period cost is $400. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[
\text{CPI} = \left( \frac{400}{200} \right) \times 100 = 200
\]

Thus, the CPI in the current period is 200. This matches option F, which states "equals 200 in the current period." Other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the CPI value or confuse it with percentage changes in prices.

Answer: F
