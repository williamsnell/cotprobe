Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral from 0 to π/2 of 1 divided by (1 plus (tan x) raised to the power of sqrt(2)) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I remember some techniques that might help here.

Let me think. The integral is ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + (tan x)^{√2}) dx. I've heard that sometimes, for integrals involving tan x, a substitution can simplify things. Oh right, like using substitution where you let x' = π/2 - x. That might be useful here because tan(π/2 - x) is cot x, which is 1/tan x.

So if I set u = π/2 - x, then when x is 0, u is π/2, and when x is π/2, u is 0. So the limits would switch, but I can reverse them and add a negative sign. Let me write that down.

Let u = π/2 - x. Then, du = -dx, so dx = -du. The integral becomes ∫_{π/2}^{0} 1/(1 + (tan(π/2 - u))^{√2}) (-du). Flipping the limits back to 0 to π/2 removes the negative sign, so it's ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + (cot u)^{√2}) du.

But cot u is (1/tan u), so (cot u)^{√2} is (tan u)^{-√2}. So substituting that in, the denominator becomes 1 + (tan u)^{-√2}.

Hmm, let me rewrite that. So 1 + (tan u)^{-√2} is the same as [ (tan u)^{√2} + 1 ] / (tan u)^{√2} }. So taking the reciprocal, the integrand becomes (tan u)^{√2} / (1 + (tan u)^{√2}).

Wait, so the integral after substitution is ∫₀^{π/2} (tan u)^{√2} / (1 + (tan u)^{√2}) du.

But wait, that's the same as the original integral but with tan u instead of tan x. Let me call the original integral I. So I = ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + (tan x)^{√2}) dx.

After substitution, I have I = ∫₀^{π/2} (tan u)^{√2} / (1 + (tan u)^{√2}) du.

So if I add the two expressions for I, I get:

I + I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1/(1 + (tan x)^{√2}) + (tan x)^{√2}/(1 + (tan x)^{√2})] dx.

Because the variable of integration is just a dummy variable, so I can replace u with x in the substitution result. So adding them together:

2I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1 + (tan x)^{√2}] / [1 + (tan x)^{√2}] dx.

The numerator and denominator are the same, so this simplifies to 2I = ∫₀^{π/2} 1 dx. Integrating 1 from 0 to π/2 is just π/2. So 2I = π/2, which means I = π/4.

Wait, but looking at the options, π/4 is approximately 0.78539815. Let me check the options: option F is 0.78539815.

So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a moment. Did I make a mistake in the substitution? Let me double-check.

The substitution was u = π/2 - x. Then tan(π/2 - x) is cot x, correct. So (tan(π/2 -x))^{√2} is (cot x)^{√2} = (1/tan x)^{√2} = (tan x)^{-√2}.

So the denominator becomes 1 + (tan x)^{-√2} = [1 + (tan x)^{-√2}].

So when I take the reciprocal, 1 over that is [ (tan x)^{√2} ] / [1 + (tan x)^{√2} ].

Yes, that seems right. So then adding the two integrals, I get 2I = π/2. So I must be π/4, which is about 0.7854.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.78539815, which matches π/4.

So the correct answer should be F.

To evaluate the integral 

\[
\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + (\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}} \, dx,
\]

we use the substitution \( u = \frac{\pi}{2} - x \). This transforms the integral as follows:

1. When \( x = 0 \), \( u = \frac{\pi}{2} \), and when \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( u = 0 \). Thus, \( dx = -du \), and the limits of integration are reversed.
2. The integral becomes:

\[
\int_{\pi/2}^0 \frac{1}{1 + (\tan(\frac{\pi}{2} - u))^{\sqrt{2}}} (-du) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + (\cot u)^{\sqrt{2}}} \, du.
\]

3. Since \( \cot u = \frac{1}{\tan u} \), we have \( (\cot u)^{\sqrt{2}} = (\tan u)^{-\sqrt{2}} \). Substituting this into the denominator:

\[
\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + (\tan u)^{-\sqrt{2}}} \, du = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{(\tan u)^{\sqrt{2}}}{1 + (\tan u)^{\sqrt{2}}} \, du.
\]

Now, let the original integral be denoted as \( I \). After substitution, we have:

\[
I = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + (\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}} \, dx,
\]

and the transformed integral is:

\[
I = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{(\tan u)^{\sqrt{2}}}{1 + (\tan u)^{\sqrt{2}}} \, du.
\]

Adding these two expressions for \( I \):

\[
I + I = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + (\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}} \, dx + \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{(\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}}{1 + (\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}} \, dx.
\]

The integrands add up to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + (\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}} + \frac{(\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}}{1 + (\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}} = 1.
\]

Thus:

\[
2I = \int_0^{\pi/2} 1 \, dx = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Solving for \( I \), we find:

\[
I = \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]

The numerical value of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) is approximately \( 0.78539815 \), which corresponds to option F.
