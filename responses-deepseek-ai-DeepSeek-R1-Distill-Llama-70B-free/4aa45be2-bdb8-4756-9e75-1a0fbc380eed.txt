Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the magnitude of the spin angular momentum of a proton. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that protons, along with electrons and other particles, have intrinsic angular momentum called spin. Angular momentum in quantum mechanics is quantized, right? Oh wait, the formula for spin angular momentum is something like S = ħ * sqrt(s(s+1)), where s is the spin quantum number. But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right.

Oh wait, protons are spin-1/2 particles, so s = 1/2. Right, because electrons are spin-1/2 and protons are too. So plugging that into the formula, s(s+1) would be (1/2)(1/2 + 1) = (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4. Then the square root of that is sqrt(3/4) which is sqrt(3)/2. So S = ħ * (sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, but what is ħ? Oh yes, the reduced Planck constant. I think ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. So I can plug that in.

So S = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (sqrt(3)/2). Let me calculate that. sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 1.732 divided by 2 is about 0.866. Then 1.0545718e-34 * 0.866 equals... let me compute that.

1.0545718e-34 * 0.866 ≈ 0.913e-34 J·s. Wait, 1.0545718 * 0.866 is approximately 0.913. So 0.913e-34 is the same as 9.13e-35 J·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 9.13 ×10^-35 J·s. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are there any other factors I might be missing? Like, for orbital angular momentum, it's different, but this is spin. Spin is an intrinsic property, so I think the same formula applies. So yeah, I think I did it right.

To calculate the magnitude of the spin angular momentum of a proton, we use the formula for intrinsic spin angular momentum:

\[
S = \hbar \sqrt{s(s+1)}
\]

Here, \( s \) is the spin quantum number. For a proton, \( s = \frac{1}{2} \). Substituting this value:

\[
S = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2} + 1\right)} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \hbar \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \). Substituting this value:

\[
S = \left(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}\right) \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Since \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we have:

\[
S = \left(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}\right) \times \frac{1.732}{2} = \left(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}\right) \times 0.866 \approx 9.13 \times 10^{-35} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the closest match is:

**D: \( 9.13 \times 10^{-35} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \)**.

Answer: D
