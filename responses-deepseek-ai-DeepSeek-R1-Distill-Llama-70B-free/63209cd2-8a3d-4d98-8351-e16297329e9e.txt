Okay, so I have this problem where Mr. Howard owns a house worth $16,500, and it's assessed at a rate of 22%. I need to calculate how much tax he pays for each of the specified needs and then find the total tax. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to find the assessed value of the house. The assessed value is calculated by multiplying the actual value by the assessment rate. So the actual value is $16,500, and the assessment rate is 22%, which is 0.22 in decimal form. So assessed value = 16,500 * 0.22. Let me compute that.

16,500 times 0.22... Let me see. 16,500 * 0.2 is 3,300, and 16,500 * 0.02 is 330. So adding those together, 3,300 + 330 equals 3,630. So the assessed value is $3,630. That's the amount on which the taxes are calculated.

Now, I need to calculate each tax rate. The tax rates are given per $100, so for each, I'll calculate how many $100 are in $3,630 and then apply the respective tax rate.

Starting with the local college fund: it's $0.41 per $100. So first, I find how many hundreds are in 3,630. That would be 3,630 divided by 100, which is 36.3. Now, multiply that by 0.41. So 36.3 * 0.41. Let me compute that. 36 * 0.41 is 14.76, and 0.3 * 0.41 is 0.123. Adding them together gives 14.76 + 0.123 = 14.883. Wait, but money is to two decimal places, so that's approximately $14.88 for the local college fund.

Next is the special education tax at $0.02 per $100. Again, using the 36.3 from before. 36.3 * 0.02 is... 0.726. So that's $0.73 when rounded to two decimal places.

Then, the health and welfare tax is $0.001 per $100. Hmm, wait, $0.001 is like a tenth of a cent, so per $100 it's a tenth of a cent. So 36.3 * 0.001 is 0.0363 dollars, which is 3.63 cents. So $0.0363, which is approximately $0.04 when rounded up, but maybe it's just kept as is. Wait, but perhaps we should keep more decimals to sum them up correctly at the end.

Wait, maybe I should calculate each tax precisely and then sum them all for the total. Let me approach each one carefully.

Wait, let me list all the tax rates again to make sure I don't miss any:

1. Local college fund: $0.41 per $100
2. Special education: $0.02 per $100
3. Health and welfare: $0.001 per $100
4. Community construction: $0.089 per $100

Wait, the community construction rate is $0.089 per $100. So that's 8.9 cents per hundred. Let me compute each.

So, for each tax:

1. College: 36.3 * 0.41 = ?
Let me compute 36 * 0.41 = 14.76, and 0.3 * 0.41 = 0.123. So total is 14.76 + 0.123 = 14.883 → $14.88.

2. Special education: 36.3 * 0.02 = 0.726 → $0.73.

3. Health and welfare: 36.3 * 0.001 = 0.0363 → $0.0363, which is about $0.04 when rounded.

4. Community construction: 36.3 * 0.089. Hmm, let me compute that. 36 times 0.089 is... 36 * 0.08 is 2.88, 36 * 0.009 is 0.324. So 2.88 + 0.324 = 3.204. Now, 0.3 * 0.089 is 0.0267. So total is 3.204 + 0.0267 = 3.2307. So approximately $3.23.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, 36.3 * 0.089 could be calculated as:

36.3 * 0.08 = 2.904
36.3 * 0.009 = 0.3267
So adding them, 2.904 + 0.3267 = 3.2307 → $3.23.

So now, each tax is as follows:

- College: $14.88
- Special Education: $0.73
- Health and Welfare: $0.0363 → let's keep it as $0.0363 for now
- Community Construction: $3.23

Now, let's sum all these to get the total tax.

Adding them up:

14.88 + 0.73 = 15.61

15.61 + 0.0363 = 15.6463

15.6463 + 3.23 = 18.8763 → approximately $18.88 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but when dealing with multiple taxes, sometimes each is calculated separately and then summed. So, the total would be 14.88 + 0.73 = 15.61, plus 0.0363 is 15.6463, plus 3.23 gives 18.8763, which is about $18.88.

Looking at the options, option C is $18.88. So the total tax would be option C.

Wait, but let me check again each calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Assessed value: 16,500 * 0.22 = 3,630. Correct.

College: 3,630 * 0.41 / 100: Wait, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Wait, because the tax is per $100, so the formula is (assessed value / 100) * tax rate.

So, for the college, it's (3,630 / 100) * 0.41 = 36.3 * 0.41 = 14.883 → $14.88 correct.

Special education: 36.3 * 0.02 = 0.726 → $0.73 correct.

Health and welfare: 36.3 * 0.001 = 0.0363 → $0.0363 correct.

Community construction: 36.3 * 0.089 = 3.23 (as before).

So adding all four: 14.88 + 0.73 = 15.61, plus 0.0363 → 15.6463, plus 3.23 → 18.8763, which rounds to 18.88.

So the total tax is $18.88, which is option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: $3.23
B: $21.43
C: $18.88
D: $20.00
E: $17.65
F: $22.50
G: $19.76
H: $16.34
I: $15.47
J: $14.88

So the total is option C: $18.88.

Wait, but the question asks "How much tax does Mr. Howard pay for each of these needs? What was the total tax?" So the options might be individual taxes, but the way the question is phrased, it's more likely the options are for the total tax. Wait, no, the question asks "How much tax... for each...? What was the total tax?" So perhaps each tax is calculated, but the options are for the total. So the correct answer would be the total tax, which is $18.88, option C.

But wait, perhaps I should check if the question is asking for each individual tax, but the way the options are labeled, they don't list multiple values. So it's more likely that the options are for the total tax. Therefore, the correct answer is C: $18.88.

To determine how much tax Mr. Howard pays, we first calculate the assessed value of his house. The house is worth $16,500 and is assessed at a rate of 22%. The assessed value is:

\[
\text{Assessed Value} = 16,500 \times 0.22 = 3,630.
\]

Next, we calculate the tax for each need based on the given rates per $100 of assessed value:

1. **Local College Fund**:  
   Tax rate = $0.41 per $100.  
   \[
   \text{Tax} = \left(\frac{3,630}{100}\right) \times 0.41 = 36.3 \times 0.41 = 14.883 \approx 14.88.
   \]

2. **Special Education**:  
   Tax rate = $0.02 per $100.  
   \[
   \text{Tax} = \left(\frac{3,630}{100}\right) \times 0.02 = 36.3 \times 0.02 = 0.726 \approx 0.73.
   \]

3. **Health and Welfare**:  
   Tax rate = $0.001 per $100.  
   \[
   \text{Tax} = \left(\frac{3,630}{100}\right) \times 0.001 = 36.3 \times 0.001 = 0.0363 \approx 0.04.
   \]

4. **Community Construction**:  
   Tax rate = $0.089 per $100.  
   \[
   \text{Tax} = \left(\frac{3,630}{100}\right) \times 0.089 = 36.3 \times 0.089 = 3.2307 \approx 3.23.
   \]

Finally, we sum all the taxes to find the total tax:

\[
\text{Total Tax} = 14.88 + 0.73 + 0.0363 + 3.23 = 18.8763 \approx 18.88.
\]

Thus, the total tax Mr. Howard pays is **$18.88**, which corresponds to option **C**.
