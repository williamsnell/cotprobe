Okay, so I have this problem here about ABC Corporation's net income and taxes. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question says that ABC had a net income of $1,000,000 in 1976 and that they pay 50% in taxes. I need to find out what their income was before taxes. Hmm, right, net income is after taxes, so I need to backtrack from that.

Alright, let's think about this. So, net income equals total revenue minus all expenses, including taxes. But wait, in this context, I think when they say net income, they mean after subtracting taxes. So the formula I remember is:

Net Income = (Gross Income) - (Taxes)

Or sometimes, Net Income = Gross Income * (1 - Tax Rate). Yeah, that sounds right. So if the tax rate is 50%, that means the company pays half of their gross income in taxes and keeps the other half as net income.

So in this case, the net income is $1,000,000. The tax rate is 50%, which is 0.5 in decimal form. Let me plug those into the formula.

So rearranging the formula to solve for Gross Income (which is income before taxes), I get:

Gross Income = Net Income / (1 - Tax Rate)

Plugging in the numbers:

Gross Income = $1,000,000 / (1 - 0.5) = $1,000,000 / 0.5 = $2,000,000.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the company makes $2 million before taxes, and pays 50% tax, that would be $1 million in taxes. So net income is $2 million - $1 million = $1 million, which matches the given. So that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option C is $2,000,000. So the correct answer should be C.

I think that's straightforward. I don't see any complications here. Just applying the basic formula correctly. No need to worry about other factors since the question is pretty direct.

To determine ABC Corporation's income before taxes, we use the relationship between net income, gross income, and tax rate. The formula is:

\[
\text{Net Income} = \text{Gross Income} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})
\]

Rearranging to solve for Gross Income:

\[
\text{Gross Income} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{1 - \text{Tax Rate}}
\]

Given:
- Net Income = $1,000,000
- Tax Rate = 50\% = 0.5

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Gross Income} = \frac{1,000,000}{1 - 0.5} = \frac{1,000,000}{0.5} = 2,000,000
\]

Thus, ABC Corporation's income before taxes is $2,000,000. The correct answer is:

C: $2,000,000
