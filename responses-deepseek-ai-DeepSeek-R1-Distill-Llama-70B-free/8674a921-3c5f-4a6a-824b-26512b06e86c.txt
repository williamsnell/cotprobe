The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The superintendent of a large school district asks the school psychologist to predict students' grade point averages (GPAs) for the first year of high school. The school psychologist has included achievement and aptitude scores as predictor variables for firstyear high school GPA in a regression analysis and is considering whether to also administer a school interest inventory and include those scores. The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?

Options:

A: The cost of administering the school interest inventory to all students
B: The correlation between the school interest inventory scores and the achievement test scores
C: The similarity between the school interest inventory scores and the aptitude test scores
D: The effect of the school interest inventory score on the students' second-year high school GPA
E: The correlation between the school interest inventory score and the students' middle school GPA
F: The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA
G: The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score
H: The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA
I: The time required to administer the school interest inventory
J: The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about a school psychologist using regression analysis to predict students' GPAs. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The scenario is that the superintendent wants to predict first-year high school GPAs. The psychologist is already using achievement and aptitude scores as predictors. Now, they're thinking about adding a school interest inventory. The question is about the major concern the psychologist should have when deciding to include this new variable.

Hmm, I remember that in regression analysis, when you add a new predictor variable, you want to know if it significantly improves the model. Like, does it explain additional variance in the outcome variable beyond what's already accounted for by the existing predictors?

So the key here is whether adding the interest inventory will increase the multiple correlation coefficient. The multiple correlation (R) measures how well all the predictors together explain the outcome. If adding the new variable (interest inventory) raises R significantly, then it's worth including. But if it doesn't add much, maybe the cost or effort isn't worth it.

Looking at the options:

Option F says, "The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA." That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. The psychologist should care about whether adding this variable improves the prediction model.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure. Option A is about cost. That's a practical concern, but the question is about the major concern when making the decision. It's more of a statistical concern here.

Option B talks about the correlation between interest and achievement. That's about multicollinearity, maybe. If the new variable is too correlated with existing ones, it doesn't add much. But the main point is whether it adds to the prediction, not just its relation to other variables.

Option E is about middle school GPA. But the regression is for first-year high school, so maybe that's not as directly relevant. Plus, the question is about including another variable in the model, not about prior grades.

Option G is the zero-order correlation between GPA and interest. That's just one part, but in regression, it's about the incremental contribution when other variables are already in the model.

Option H is comparing correlations, but again, it's about whether the new variable adds to the model's predictive power beyond what's already there.

So yes, the main concern is whether the interest inventory improves the multiple correlation. So the answer should be F.

The school psychologist's primary concern when deciding whether to include the school interest inventory in the regression model should be whether adding this variable significantly improves the model's predictive power. Specifically, the focus should be on whether the interest inventory raises the multiple correlation coefficient, which measures the extent to which the predictors collectively explain the variance in the outcome variable (first-year high school GPA). This is because the goal of regression analysis in this context is to enhance the accuracy of GPA predictions. 

Among the options provided, Option F directly addresses this concern by focusing on the degree to which the interest inventory score increases the multiple correlation when included as a predictor. While other options touch on related issues, such as cost, correlations with other variables, or practicality, they do not align as closely with the primary statistical concern in this decision-making process.

Answer: F
