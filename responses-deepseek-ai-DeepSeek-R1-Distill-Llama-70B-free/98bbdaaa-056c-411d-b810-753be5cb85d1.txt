Question:

Two atoms of scandium are to combine with three atoms of oxygen. If you start with 1 gram of scandium, how much oxygen is required? Scandium has an atomic weight of 44.96 g/mole. The at. wt. of oxygen is 15.999 g/mole.

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that two atoms of scandium combine with three atoms of oxygen. I'm starting with 1 gram of scandium, and I need to find out how much oxygen is required. The atomic weights given are scandium at 44.96 g/mole and oxygen at 15.999 g/mole. The options are from A to J, each with different gram amounts for oxygen.

Hmm, so first, I remember that when elements combine, they form compounds, and the ratio of atoms is important. The problem mentions two scandium atoms and three oxygen atoms, so the formula of the compound would be Sc2O3. That makes sense because scandium typically has a +3 oxidation state, so each oxygen is -2. So two Sc³+ would balance three O²-: 2*(+3) = 3*(-2) → 6=6. Yep, that checks out.

Now, I need to find out how much oxygen is needed for 1 gram of scandium. I think I should start by finding moles of scandium. Moles are calculated by mass divided by molar mass. So for scandium, that's 1 gram divided by 44.96 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

1 / 44.96 ≈ 0.02224 moles of Sc. 

But wait, the ratio is 2 Sc atoms to 3 O atoms. So for every 2 moles of Sc, we need 3 moles of O. So I should find the moles of O needed based on the moles of Sc.

So the moles of O would be (3/2) times the moles of Sc. Let me calculate that.

0.02224 mol Sc * (3/2) = 0.03336 mol O.

Now, convert moles of O to grams. Oxygen's molar mass is 15.999 g/mol, so:

0.03336 mol * 15.999 g/mol ≈ 0.533 grams of O.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.533 g of oxygen. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I handle the ratios correctly? Yes, 2 Sc to 3 O, so for each mole of Sc, 1.5 moles of O are needed. Oh wait no, 2 moles Sc require 3 moles O, so per mole of Sc, it's 3/2 moles O. So for 0.02224 moles Sc, 0.02224 * (3/2) is indeed 0.03336 moles O. Multiply by 16 (since oxygen's molar mass is about 16), 0.03336 *16= 0.533. Yeah, that looks correct. So I think J is the right choice.

To determine how much oxygen is required when 1 gram of scandium reacts with oxygen, we start by calculating the moles of scandium:

\[
\text{Moles of Sc} = \frac{\text{Mass of Sc}}{\text{Molar Mass of Sc}} = \frac{1 \, \text{g}}{44.96 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.02224 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction forms the compound \( \text{Sc}_2\text{O}_3 \), where 2 moles of scandium react with 3 moles of oxygen. Thus, the ratio of oxygen to scandium is \( \frac{3}{2} \). The moles of oxygen required are:

\[
\text{Moles of O} = 0.02224 \, \text{mol Sc} \times \frac{3}{2} = 0.03336 \, \text{mol O}.
\]

Next, convert moles of oxygen to grams using its molar mass (\( 15.999 \, \text{g/mol} \)):

\[
\text{Mass of O} = 0.03336 \, \text{mol O} \times 15.999 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 0.533 \, \text{g}.
\]

Thus, the amount of oxygen required is **0.533 g**, corresponding to option J.
