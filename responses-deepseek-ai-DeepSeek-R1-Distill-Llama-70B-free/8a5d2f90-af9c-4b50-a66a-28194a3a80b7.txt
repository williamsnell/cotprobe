Question:

Describe each of the following situations in terms of de-mand elasticity. a) You have a cold and the only medicine that can help you used to cost $1.50 per bottle but now costs $20.00 a bottle. You buy it anyway. b) At $80 per ticket you would buy 2 tickets, but scalpers want $100 a seat for the Stanley cup finals, so you stay at home and watch the games on television. c) Chocolate bars double in price overnight from 10$ to 20C, yet you buy the same number as before.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about demand elasticity, and I'm trying to figure it out. I remember that demand elasticity has to do with how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The basic idea is whether the quantity changes a lot or a little when the price changes. 

The question has three parts, a, b, and c. I need to determine for each situation whether the demand is elastic or inelastic. Let's break them down one by one.

Starting with part a: You have a cold and the only medicine that can help you used to cost $1.50 per bottle but now costs $20.00 a bottle. You buy it anyway. Hmm, so the price increased a lot, from $1.50 to $20. That's like a huge jump. But despite the price increase, you still buy it. So, your quantity demanded didn't change much even though the price went up a lot. 

I think that's inelastic demand. Because inelastic means that the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price. So if the price goes up by a lot, but you still buy the same amount, that's inelastic. Like, when you really need something and there's no substitute, you'll pay whatever the price is.

Moving on to part b: At $80 per ticket, you'd buy 2 tickets. But scalpers are now charging $100 each, and you decide to stay home and watch on TV instead. So here, the price went up from $80 to $100. What's your response? You were going to buy 2 tickets, but now you're buying zero. That's a big change in quantity demanded when the price increased. 

This sounds like elastic demand. Because a small change in price leads to a big change in quantity. Elastic demand means that the percentage change in quantity is greater than the percentage change in price. So when the price went up, you decided not to buy any, which is a significant drop in quantity.

Wait, but wait, the price increased by 25% (from 80 to 100 is a 25% increase). But the quantity went from 2 to 0, which is a 100% decrease. So the percentage change in quantity is much larger than the percentage change in price, which fits the definition of elastic demand. So part b is elastic.

Now part c: Chocolate bars double in price overnight, from 10 cents to 20 cents. Yet you buy the same number as before. So the price doubled, but quantity didn't change. That suggests inelastic demand. Because even though the price increased by 100%, the quantity you buy remains the same. So the percentage change in quantity is zero, which is less than the percentage change in price. So inelastic.

Wait, but wait again. If the price doubles, but you keep buying the same amount, that must be a necessity or something you can't do without. But chocolate bars are more of a luxury, so I'm a bit confused. But in this scenario, the person is buying the same number despite the price doubling, so regardless of the type of good, the situation is inelastic.

Putting it all together:

a) Inelastic demand.

b) Elastic demand.

c) Inelastic demand.

Looking at the answer options, the options are A through D.

Option C says a) Inelastic, b) Elastic, c) Inelastic. So that matches what I just thought.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me make sure I didn't mix up elastic and inelastic. Elastic is when a price change leads to a larger percentage change in quantity. Inelastic is when it leads to a smaller percentage change.

In part a, price went up a lot, but quantity didn't change. So inelastic.

In part b, price went up a bit, but quantity dropped a lot. So elastic.

In part c, price doubled, but quantity didn't change. So inelastic.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the elasticity of demand in each scenario, we analyze how the quantity demanded responds to changes in price:

- **Part (a):** The price of medicine increases significantly (from $1.50 to $20), but the quantity demanded remains the same. This indicates **inelastic demand**, as the percentage change in quantity is much smaller than the percentage change in price.

- **Part (b):** The price of tickets increases from $80 to $100, and the quantity demanded drops from 2 to 0. This shows **elastic demand**, as the percentage change in quantity (100% decrease) is much larger than the percentage change in price (25% increase).

- **Part (c):** The price of chocolate bars doubles (from 10¢ to 20¢), but the quantity demanded remains unchanged. This indicates **inelastic demand**, as the percentage change in quantity is zero, which is smaller than the percentage change in price (100% increase).

Thus, the correct classification is:

**a) Inelastic demand, b) Elastic demand, c) Inelastic demand.**

The correct answer is **C**.
