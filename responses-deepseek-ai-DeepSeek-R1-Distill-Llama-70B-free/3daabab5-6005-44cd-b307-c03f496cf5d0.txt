D: not guilty, because he didn't specifically target the woman.
E: guilty, because he should have stopped when he lost control of the car.
F: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman.
G: not guilty, because the defendant had no control over the car at the time of the accident.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question here. Let's see, the defendant was driving recklessly at a high speed, over 100 mph in a residential area. He lost control, jumped the curb, and hit a woman walking on the sidewalk. She got really hurtâ€”severe injuries, fractured legs, hospitalized for 11 months, and permanently disabled.

The question is about whether he should be found guilty of attempted murder. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, so I remember that for a crime like attempted murder, the prosecution has to prove both the act (actus reus) and the intent (mens rea). Specifically, the intent for murder is the deliberate intention to kill someone. So, attempted murder would require that the defendant intended to kill the victim and took a substantial step towards that goal.

But wait, in this case, the defendant was driving recklessly. Reckless driving usually involves a lower level of intent than purposeful intent. Recklessness is more about disregarding a known risk, not necessarily intending the harmful outcome.

So, if the defendant didn't specifically target the woman, like he wasn't aiming for her or trying to hit her, then he might not have the specific intent required for attempted murder. Instead, he could be charged with something like reckless endangerment or vehicular assault, which don't require the same level of intent.

Looking at the options, option D says not guilty because he didn't target the woman. That makes sense because attempted murder needs intent to kill a specific person. If he wasn't aiming for her, he didn't have that intent.

Option F says not guilty because he didn't intend to kill her. That also seems relevant because without intent, he can't be guilty of attempted murder.

Option I says guilty because a person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of their acts. Hmm, that's about the doctrine of transferred intent, but I think that applies more when the intent is there but the target is different. Like if you aim at A but hit B, the intent transfers. But here, the question is whether the initial intent was there at all.

Wait, another angle: some jurisdictions might consider that when someone acts with reckless disregard for human life, they could be considered to have acted with a "depraved heart," which might support a murder charge in some cases. But attempted murder is different. Attempted murder requires specific intent to kill, whereas depraved heart is more about extreme recklessness leading to murder, not attempt.

So, the key here is whether the defendant had the specific intent to kill. If he was just driving recklessly and lost control, he probably didn't have that intent. Therefore, he couldn't be convicted of attempted murder.

Looking back at the options, F says not guilty because he didn't intend to kill her. D says because he didn't target her. Both seem possible, but I think F is more accurate because it's about the absence of intent to kill, which is the key element.

Alternatively, option C says guilty because of willful and wanton disregard. That's about recklessness, which might support a different charge but not attempted murder.

So, the answer should be either D or F. Wait, but the question is about whether he should be found guilty of attempted murder. So, the correct answer hinges on the intent.

Since he was driving recklessly but didn't intend to kill anyone, he lacks the specific intent. So, the answer should be F: not guilty because he didn't intend to kill her.

The defendant was driving recklessly at a high speed, lost control, and injured a pedestrian. For attempted murder, specific intent to kill is required. The defendant's actions were reckless but lacked the deliberate intention to kill, which is necessary for attempted murder. Therefore, he should be found not guilty.

Answer: F
