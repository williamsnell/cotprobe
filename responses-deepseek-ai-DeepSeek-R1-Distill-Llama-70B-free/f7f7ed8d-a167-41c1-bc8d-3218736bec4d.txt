Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are two electrochemical cells connected in series. Both use inert platinum electrodes. The first cell has a metal nitrate solution, and the second has a metal sulfate solution. After some time, 675 mg of the metal is deposited in the first cell, and 76.3 ml of hydrogen gas is evolved in the second. I need to find the equivalent weight of the metal.

Hmm, okay. So both cells are connected in series, which probably means they're sharing the same current. The current through each cell should be the same because they're in series, right?

Let me think about each cell's reaction. In the first cell, since it's a metal nitrate solution, during electrolysis, the metal should be deposited at the cathode. The reaction for the cathode would be the reduction of metal ions. For the anode, since it's nitrate, maybe oxygen is evolved from water? Or perhaps the nitrate ions are oxidized. Wait, but in nitrate solution, the anode reaction can be a bit tricky. But wait, the question says the electrodes are inert, so it's likely that oxygen is evolved from water at the anode, or maybe nitrate is involved in a redox reaction. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly needed for this calculation.

The second cell has a metal sulfate solution, and hydrogen gas is evolved. So that's probably the cathode reaction in the second cell. Wait, no, wait. In electrolysis, hydrogen would be produced at the cathode if the solution is acidic, but sulfate solutions... Well, the standard is usually that in the electrolysis of sulfate solutions with an inert anode and cathode, the reactions are as follows: At the cathode, 2H+ + 2e- → H2(g). At the anode, 2SO4^2- - 4e- → 2SO4^2- + O2(g) (but that might not be right). Wait, sulfate isn't usually oxidized; more likely, the anode reaction would involve water splitting, producing O2. So, 4OH- → O2 + 2H2O + 4e-.

Wait, but in the second cell, hydrogen is being evolved. So that must be at the cathode. So the cathode reaction is 2H+ + 2e- → H2(g). Oh wait, but in sulfate solution, it's possible that the metal ions are discharged instead, but here the question says hydrogen is evolved, so that suggests that the metal's ions aren't being discharged. So perhaps the solution is such that H+ is getting reduced instead, meaning the concentration of metal ions is low, so H+ is preferentially discharged. 

Wait, but if the first cell is depositing metal, then the second cell is producing hydrogen. Both are connected in series, so the same current is flowing through both. So the amount of charge passed through each cell is the same.

So, to find the equivalent weight of the metal, which is the molar mass divided by the valency, I need to relate the masses of metal deposited and the hydrogen gas evolved.

Let me think about the charge involved in each case. 

In the first cell, the mass of metal deposited is 675 mg, which is 0.675 grams. Let me denote the equivalent weight as E, so the moles of electrons (charge) involved in depositing this metal would be mass divided by equivalent weight. Because the equivalent weight is molar mass divided by valency, so moles of electrons (equivalents) would be mass / E. Because for each equivalent of metal, one mole of electrons is transferred (assuming the metal has a +1 charge). Wait, but metals can have different valencies, so perhaps I should let the valency be n.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the charge from each cell and set them equal.

For the first cell, the mass deposited is 0.675 grams. Let’s say the metal has a molar mass M and a valency n. So the number of moles of metal deposited is 0.675 g / M. Each mole of metal deposits n moles of electrons. So the total charge Q is n * (0.675/M) * F, where F is Faraday's constant.

In the second cell, hydrogen is evolved. The volume is 76.3 mL at 25°C and 1 atm. I need to convert that to moles. At 25°C, which is 298 K, and 1 atm, the volume is 76.3 ml, which is 0.0763 L. Using PV = nRT, so n = PV/(RT). R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So n = (1 atm * 0.0763 L) / (0.0821 * 298). Let me compute that.

Calculating the denominator: 0.0821 * 298 ≈ 24.46. So n ≈ 0.0763 / 24.46 ≈ 0.00312 mol of H2. Since each mole of H2 has 2 moles of electrons (because 2 H+ + 2e- → H2), the total charge Q is 2 * 0.00312 mol * F = 0.00624 F·mol.

Wait, but in the second cell, the charge comes from the electrons used to produce H2. So the charge Q is 2 * n(H2) * F.

Now, since the cells are in series, the same charge passes through both. So Q1 = Q2.

So, for the first cell, the charge Q1 is n1 * F, where n1 is the number of moles of electrons. For the metal, each mole deposits n electrons, so n1 = (0.675 g / M) * n.

So Q1 = (0.675 n / M) * F.

In the second cell, Q2 = 2 * n(H2) * F.

Setting Q1 = Q2:

(0.675 n / M) * F = 2 * n(H2) * F.

The F cancels out:

0.675 n / M = 2 * n(H2).

I can plug in n(H2) as 0.00312 mol.

Wait, let me recompute n(H2) precisely.

n(H2) = (P V) / (R T) = (1 atm * 0.0763 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298 K).

Calculate denominator: 0.0821 * 298 ≈ 24.4658.

So n(H2) = 0.0763 / 24.4658 ≈ 0.00312 moles.

So, 0.675 n / M = 2 * 0.00312.

Simplify right side: 0.00624.

So,

0.675 n / M = 0.00624.

We can write this as:

n/M = 0.00624 / 0.675.

Wait, 0.00624 / 0.675 = let me compute that. 0.00624 ÷ 0.675.

Well, 0.675 is 675/1000, so 0.675 = 27/40.

So 0.00624 ÷ 0.675 = (6.24 × 10^-3) ÷ (6.75 × 10^-1) ) = (6.24 / 6.75) × 10^-2.

6.24 / 6.75 = 0.924 approx.

So 0.924 × 10^-2 = 0.00924.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should just compute it numerically.

0.00624 ÷ 0.675.

Compute 0.675 × 0.00924 = 0.00624. So yes, it's 0.00924.

So n/M = 0.00924.

But the equivalent weight E is M / n, because equivalent weight is molar mass divided by valency.

So E = M/n = 1 / (n/M) ) = 1 / 0.00924 ≈ 108.23 g/equiv.

Looking at the options, option F is 108.2 g/equiv, which matches.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn’t make a mistake.

Wait, let's redo the calculation.

n(H2) = (1 atm * 0.0763 L) / (0.0821 * 298).

Let me compute denominator: 0.0821 * 298 = 24.4658.

So n(H2) = 0.0763 / 24.4658 = approximately 0.00312 moles. Correct.

Each mole of H2 is 2 electrons, so total electrons: 0.00624 moles. So Q = 0.00624 F.

In the first cell, the mass is 0.675 g. Moles of metal = 0.675 / M. Each mole of metal gives n electrons, so total electrons is (0.675/M)*n.

So (0.675 n)/M = 0.00624.

So n/M = 0.00624 * M / (0.675 n) ? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the equation is (0.675 n)/M = 0.00624.

So rearranging, (n/M) = 0.00624 / 0.675.

Which is 0.00924.

So, equivalent weight E is M/n = 1/(n/M) = 1/0.00924 ≈ 108.2 g/equiv.

Yes, so the answer is F: 108.2 g/equiv.

To determine the equivalent weight of the metal, we analyze the two electrochemical cells connected in series. The first cell deposits 675 mg (0.675 g) of the metal, while the second cell evolves 76.3 mL of hydrogen gas at 25°C and 1 atm. Since the cells are in series, the same charge flows through both cells.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of hydrogen gas
Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), the moles of hydrogen gas are calculated as:

\[
n(\text{H}_2) = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(1 \, \text{atm})(0.0763 \, \text{L})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K})(298 \, \text{K})} \approx 0.00312 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Relate charge in both cells
In the second cell, each mole of hydrogen gas involves 2 moles of electrons, so the total charge is:

\[
Q_2 = 2 \cdot n(\text{H}_2) \cdot F = 2 \cdot 0.00312 \cdot F = 0.00624 \cdot F \, \text{mol}.
\]

In the first cell, the charge is related to the mass of the metal deposited. Let the molar mass of the metal be \( M \) and its valency be \( n \). The number of moles of metal deposited is:

\[
\text{Moles of metal} = \frac{0.675}{M}.
\]

Each mole of metal deposits \( n \) moles of electrons, so the total charge is:

\[
Q_1 = \frac{0.675 \cdot n}{M} \cdot F.
\]

Since the cells are in series, \( Q_1 = Q_2 \), so:

\[
\frac{0.675 \cdot n}{M} \cdot F = 0.00624 \cdot F.
\]

Canceling \( F \) and rearranging:

\[
\frac{n}{M} = \frac{0.00624}{0.675} \approx 0.00924.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate equivalent weight
The equivalent weight of the metal is given by:

\[
E = \frac{M}{n} = \frac{1}{\frac{n}{M}} = \frac{1}{0.00924} \approx 108.2 \, \text{g/equiv}.
\]

### Final Answer:
F: 108.2 g/equiv.
