Okay, so I've got this problem here about ethanol diffusing out of a porous solid. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The solid is rectangular, 0.5 inches thick. It's submerged in 100% ethanol, so I guess the voids get filled with ethanol. The voids make up 50% of the volume, which probably affects the diffusion. Then, the solid is placed in agitated water at 80°F. The key here is that only molecular diffusion occurs in the pores, and the diffusivity inside the pores is one-tenth of its value outside. 

The question asks for the time it takes for the mass fraction of ethanol at the center of the solid to drop to 0.008. And the concentration in the water is zero. So, it's a diffusion problem where ethanol is leaving the solid into the water.

Wait, I remember that when something is placed in a well-agitated bath, it's often modeled as a situation where the surface concentration is zero. So the ethanol diffuses out, and the surface of the solid quickly reaches zero concentration, I think. 

I think this is similar to the problem of drying or desorption. The solid is releasing ethanol into the surrounding water. Since the ethanol is only moving by molecular diffusion in the pores, and the diffusivity is lower inside, I need to adjust for that.

The solid's thickness is 0.5 inches. Wait, but usually in diffusion problems, the thickness is the length over which diffusion happens. Oh wait, for a rectangular solid, the center is at half the thickness. So the center is 0.25 inches from each face.

The mass fraction at the center being 0.008 means that most of the ethanol has diffused out. So I need to model this using Fick's laws, probably in a transient diffusion scenario.

I think the appropriate model here is for a plane sheet (since it's rectangular and we're considering one dimension, the thickness). The solution for the concentration distribution in a plane sheet with surface concentration zero and initial uniform concentration is given by some series solution or maybe an approximate equation for short times.

Wait, the equation for the concentration at a particular point in a plane sheet is a function of time. The formula I remember is something like:

C(x,t)/C0 = (4/π²) * Σ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1) ) * exp( -( (2n+1)^2 π² D t ) / (4 L²) ) ) ] * cos( (2n+1) π x/(2L) )

But wait, for the center of the sheet, x is L/2. So substituting x=L/2, the cosine terms become cos( (2n+1) π / 2 ), which is zero for all n except when (2n+1) is 1, because cos(π/2) is zero, cos(3π/2) is zero, etc. Wait, no, wait: cos(k π/2) where k is odd. For n=0: k=1 → π/2 → cos is 0. n=1: k=3 → 3π/2 → cos is 0. So all terms would be zero except for n such that (2n+1) is even, but that can't be because 2n is always even, so 2n+1 is always odd. So wait, that suggests that the concentration at the center is... wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I should think again. For a plane sheet of thickness 2L, the center is at x=0. So perhaps the solution is different. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is for a sheet of thickness L, so the center is at L/2.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact solution. Oh wait, I can't, I'm just thinking. Alternatively, I remember that for a semi-infinite medium, the concentration at a depth x after time t is given by a Gaussian-like function, but for a finite sheet, it's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe I can use an approximate solution for the center of the sheet. I recall that for short times, the concentration at the center drops very slowly, but for longer times, it's more rapid.

Wait, another approach: the problem involves diffusion inside the pores, but the diffusivity inside is 1/10th that outside. Hmm. So the effective diffusivity in the solid's pores would be D_pore = D_liquid / 10. So if the bulk diffusion coefficient for ethanol in water is D, the effective diffusivity in the pores is D/10.

Wait, but the ethanol is diffusing through the pores. So the overall diffusion would be influenced by the porosity as well. Oh wait, but the problem says that the voids compose 50% of the volume, but does that affect the diffusion? Hmm. Wait, in some models, the effective diffusion coefficient is the product of the porosity and the intrinsic diffusivity. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the solid is porous and only the voids allow diffusion, then the effective diffusivity might be D_eff = ε * D, where ε is the porosity. But in this case, it says the diffusivity inside the pores is one-tenth, so perhaps D_pore = D_water / 10.

Wait, the problem says "the diffusivity inside the pores is approximately one-tenth of its value outside the solid." Oh, so D_inside = D_outside /10. So if the ethanol is diffusing through the solid's pores into the surrounding water, the D inside is 1/10th of the D in water.

Wait, but when the solid is placed in the water, the ethanol has to diffuse through the pores of the solid to get out. So the rate of diffusion is limited by how fast ethanol can move through the solid's pores. So the effective D would be D_eff = D_water /10. So the ethanol's diffusion through the solid is governed by D_eff.

Wait, but the time constant for diffusion would depend on this D_eff. So the characteristic time for diffusion is L²/(D_eff), where L is the distance from the surface to the center, which is 0.25 inches.

Wait, but let me think about the setup again. We have a solid slab of thickness 0.5 inches, so from one face to the center is 0.25 inches. The ethanol needs to diffuse out from the center to the surface and then into the water. But the surface is in contact with water, which is agitated, so the concentration there is zero.

So the problem reduces to one-dimensional diffusion through the solid, with the surface at zero concentration.

The governing equation would be the same as Fick's second law for a solid with D = D_eff.

Wait, but what's the initial condition? Initially, the entire solid is saturated with ethanol, so the concentration is uniform. So the initial concentration C0 is the same throughout.

The boundary conditions are C(±L, t) = 0 for a slab of thickness 2L. Wait, but in this case, the slab is 0.5 inches thick, so L is 0.25 inches. So the solution for concentration at position x and time t would be a function of these variables.

The solution is:

C(x,t)/C0 = (4/π²) Σ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1) ) * exp( -( (2n+1)^2 π² D_eff t ) / (4 L²) ) ) * cos( (2n+1) π x/(2L) ) ]

At the center, x = 0. So cos(0) is 1 for all terms. So the equation becomes:

C(0,t)/C0 = (4/π²) Σ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1) ) * exp( -( (2n+1)^2 π² D_eff t ) / (4 L²) ) ) ]

We need this to equal 0.008.

So:

(4/π²) Σ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1) ) * exp( -( (2n+1)^2 π² D_eff t ) / (4 L²) ) ) ] = 0.008

Hmm, this series converges, and for small values of the left-hand side, perhaps only the first term is significant. Because each subsequent term is multiplied by a decaying exponential. So maybe we can approximate the sum by just the first term (n=0).

So approx:

C(0,t)/C0 ≈ (4/π²) * [ (-1)^0 / (1) ) * exp( - π² D_eff t / (4 L²) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

C/C0 ≈ (4/π²) * exp( - π² D_eff t / (4 L²) )

Set this equal to 0.008.

So:

(4/π²) exp( - π² D_eff t / (4 L²) ) = 0.008

Multiply both sides by π²/4:

exp( - π² D_eff t / (4 L²) ) = 0.008 * π² /4

Calculate 0.008 * π² /4.

π² is about 9.8696, so 0.008 * 9.8696 ≈ 0.078956. Divided by 4: 0.078956 /4 ≈ 0.019739.

So:

exp(- π² D_eff t/(4 L²) ) ≈ 0.019739

Take natural log:

- π² D_eff t/(4 L²) ) = ln(0.019739) ≈ -3.922

So:

π² D_eff t/(4 L²) ) = 3.922

Solve for t:

t = (3.922 *4 L²) / (π² D_eff )

Now, what is D_eff? The problem states that the diffusivity inside the pores is 1/10th that outside. So D_eff = D_water /10.

But wait, do we know D_water? Hmm, wait, the problem doesn't give any specific values for ethanol's diffusivity. Oh wait, maybe the ethanol is the same as water? Or perhaps we can assume a typical value. Hmm, this is a problem because without knowing D, we can't compute t.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is about the mass fraction, not concentration. Hmm, but I think the approach remains similar. Wait, maybe the porosity affects the effective diffusivity. But the problem says that the voids are 50% of the volume. So perhaps the effective diffusivity is D_eff = (porosity) * (D_water /10). Wait, because the ethanol can only diffuse through the void volume.

Wait, no, the problem says that the diffusivity inside the pores is 1/10th that outside. So perhaps D_eff = D_water /10, regardless of porosity. Because the porosity affects the overall path but the diffusivity in the pores is given as 1/10 of the outside.

Wait, but the ethanol has to move through the pores, which have lower diffusivity. So D_eff would be D_water /10.

But without knowing D_water, how can we proceed? Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to know or assume a value for the diffusion coefficient of ethanol in water. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of a typical value.

Wait, ethanol in water at 80°F (which is about 27°C). The diffusion coefficient for ethanol in water is around 1.2 x10^-5 cm²/s at 25°C, I think. Let me think: 25°C is about 77°F, so 80°F is a bit higher, so maybe the D is a bit higher, say around 1.3 x10^-5 cm²/s. But this is a guess.

Wait, but the answer choices are in minutes, which suggests that the time isn't extremely long. Let's proceed.

So, D_water = 1.3e-5 cm²/s. Then, D_eff = D_water /10 = 1.3e-6 cm²/s.

Wait, but the thickness of the solid is given in inches. Let me convert that to cm. 0.5 inches is 0.5 * 2.54 cm ≈ 1.27 cm. So L is half that, 0.635 cm.

So L is 0.635 cm.

Plugging into the equation for t:

t = (3.922 *4 * (0.635 cm)^2 ) / ( π² * D_eff )

Compute numerator: 3.922 *4 = 15.688; 0.635^2 ≈ 0.4032 cm².

So numerator: 15.688 * 0.4032 ≈ 6.33 cm².

Denominator: π² ≈ 9.8696; D_eff = 1.3e-6 cm²/s.

So denominator: 9.8696 * 1.3e-6 ≈ 1.283e-5 cm²/s.

t = 6.33 / 1.283e-5 s ≈ 6.33 / 1.283e-5.

Calculate that: 6.33 / 1.283e-5 ≈ 493,000 seconds.

Wait, that's way too big. 493,000 seconds is about 137 hours. But looking at the options, the maximum is 4 minutes, so this can't be right. I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with units. Let me check.

Wait, D_eff is in cm²/s, L is in cm, so the term (D_eff * t) has units cm². So the units in t would be seconds. So that part is correct.

Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, L is 0.25 inches. Oh wait, wait! Wait the solid is 0.5 inches thick, so each half is 0.25 inches. But I converted 0.5 inches to cm as 1.27 cm, so 0.25 inches would be 0.635 cm? No, wait, wait, 0.5 inches is 1.27 cm. So 0.25 inches is 0.635 cm. So that part was correct.

Hmm, but getting to 493,000 seconds is way too long. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the model.

Wait, perhaps the approach should be different. Maybe I should consider that the ethanol is leaving the solid into the water, and the solid's pores have a certain effective diffusivity. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a drying process where the rate is controlled by internal diffusion.

Wait, another thought: the problem is about the mass fraction at the center. The initial mass fraction is 1 (since it's 100% ethanol), and it drops to 0.008. So perhaps the solution involves the Fourier number for diffusion.

Wait, the Fourier number Fo = D_eff * t / L².

In the earlier equation, we have:

Fo = (π² * t * D_eff )/(4 L²) ) = 3.922

Wait, no, from earlier:

π² D_eff t / (4 L²) ) = 3.922

So:

Fo = (D_eff t) / L² = (3.922 *4 ) / π² ≈ (15.688) / 9.8696 ≈ 1.587.

So Fo ≈ 1.587.

But Fourier number Fo is dimensionless.

Wait, but to get t, we have t = Fo * L² / D_eff.

If Fo is about 1.587, then t = 1.587 * L² / D_eff.

Wait, but let me plug the numbers again.

L is 0.25 inches, which is 0.635 cm.

So L² = (0.635)^2 ≈ 0.403 cm².

D_eff is 1.3e-6 cm²/s.

t = 1.587 * 0.403 / 1.3e-6.

Compute numerator: 1.587 * 0.403 ≈ 0.639.

So t = 0.639 / 1.3e-6 ≈ 491,500 seconds.

Again, same result. But this can't be right because the options are in minutes, like 4 minutes.

So clearly, something's wrong here. Maybe I used the wrong D_eff.

Wait, another approach. Perhaps the effective diffusivity isn't D_water/10, but perhaps it's the product of porosity and the pore diffusivity.

Wait, the problem says the voids are 50% of volume. So porosity ε = 0.5. So D_eff = ε * (D_water /10) = 0.5 * D_water /10 = D_water /20.

So if D_eff was 1.3e-5 cm²/s /20 → 6.5e-7 cm²/s.

Wait, then let's recalculate.

t = 3.922 *4 * L² / ( π² D_eff )

L=0.635 cm, L²=0.403 cm².

So numerator: 3.922 *4 *0.403 = let's compute 3.922*4=15.688; 15.688*0.403≈6.326.

Denominator: π² * D_eff ≈9.8696 *6.5e-7 ≈6.416e-6.

So t=6.326 / 6.416e-6 ≈985,000 seconds → which is even worse.

Hmm, that's even longer. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the diffusion occurs from the solid into the water, and in the water, the ethanol's concentration is zero. So the overall process is limited by the solid's diffusion. So perhaps the effective D is just D_pore, without considering porosity. Because the ethanol has to go through the pores, but once it's out of the solid, it's in the water which is well-agitated.

Wait, perhaps the effective D is D_water/10, but I'm not considering any overall mass transfer coefficient. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the concentration gradient is such that the ethanol diffuses from the solid into the water, and the rate is controlled by the solid's diffusion. So perhaps the model is similar to a slab with one face at zero concentration, and the other face insulated (since it's symmetric). But no, because the solid is 0.5 inches thick, so both faces are exposed to water.

Wait, no, the ethanol is diffusing out from both faces. So the center is at 0.25 inches from each face. So the time for the center's concentration to drop is the same as for a slab of thickness 0.5 inches with both ends at zero concentration.

So perhaps I should model it as such.

Wait, another approach: the equation
