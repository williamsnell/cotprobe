Okay, so I've got this question about the Pleistocene era and landmasses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my geography, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about two landmasses. The first part says that the islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Borneo formed one. The second part is about a landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania, and it's called something else.

Wait, I remember something about Sundaland or Sunda. Oh right, during the Pleistocene ice age, when sea levels were lower because a lot of water was locked up in ice, the islands in Southeast Asia were connected by land bridges. So Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Borneo were all part of a larger landmass. I think that one's called Sunda. So the first blank is Sunda.

Now the second part. Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania were connected when the sea levels were lower. I've heard the term Sahul before. Sahul refers to the continent that includes Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania when the sea levels were low. So the second part should be Sahul.

Looking at the options, option A is Sunda and Sahul. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Option B has Wallacea, which I think is a different region. Wallacea is between Sunda and Sahul, like the area that includes Sulawesi and the Philippines maybe. So Wallacea isn't the one connecting Australia and New Guinea.

Option C mentions Gondwana, which is the old supercontinent that included Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia, and India. But Gondwana broke up way before the Pleistocene era, so that's not right for this time period.

Beringia is the land bridge between Asia and North America across the Bering Strait. That's unrelated to Australia and the others, so options with Beringia (like E and I) are out.

So putting it all together, the first blank is Sunda, the second is Sahul. So the correct answer should be option A.

The correct answer is based on understanding the landmasses during the Pleistocene era. The islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Borneo were part of a landmass called Sunda due to lower sea levels. Meanwhile, Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania were connected by a landmass known as Sahul. 

A: Sunda; Sahul  
B: Sunda; Wallacea  
C: Gondwana; Beringia  
D: Sunda; Gondwana  
E: Beringia; Sunda  
F: Wallacea; Sunda  
G: Wallacea; Beringia  
H: Gondwana; Sahul  
I: Beringia; Sahul  
J: Sahul; Wallacea  

The correct option is **A: Sunda; Sahul**.
