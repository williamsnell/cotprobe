Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about vapor pressure and boiling points of a benzene-toluene solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that at 90°C, benzene has a vapor pressure of 1022 Torr and toluene has 406 Torr. We need to find the composition of a solution that boils at 1 atm (which is 760 Torr) at the same temperature. Oh wait, and the solution is ideal, so Raoult's Law applies here.

Raoult's Law states that the partial vapor pressure of each component in the solution is equal to the mole fraction of that component multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. So for a solution with two components, benzene (A) and toluene (B), the total vapor pressure would be the sum of each partial pressure.

Let me write that down. The total vapor pressure P_total = (X_A * P_A^0) + (X_B * P_B^0), where X_A and X_B are mole fractions, and P_A^0 and P_B^0 are pure component vapor pressures.

Wait, but we know that the solution boils when the total vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, which is 760 Torr here. So 760 = (X_A * 1022) + (X_B * 406).

Also, since it's a solution of two components, the mole fractions must add up to 1. So X_A + X_B = 1, which means X_B = 1 - X_A.

Let me substitute that into the equation. So 760 = X_A * 1022 + (1 - X_A) * 406.

Hmm, let's distribute the 406: 760 = 1022 X_A + 406 - 406 X_A.

Combine like terms: 760 - 406 = (1022 - 406) X_A. Let me compute that.

760 - 406 is 354. 1022 - 406 is 616. So 354 = 616 X_A.

Wait, solving for X_A: X_A = 354 / 616. Let me calculate that. 354 divided by 616. Hmm, let's see. 616 goes into 354 zero times. Let me add a decimal. 616 into 3540. 616 * 5 is 3080, which is less than 3540. 616*5=3080, 3540-3080=460. Bring down next 0: 4600. 616*7=4312, which is less than 4600. 616*7=4312, 4600-4312=288. Next, 616 goes into 288 about 0.466 times? Wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, 354/616. Let's simplify the fraction. Both numbers are even, so divide numerator and denominator by 2: 177/308. Not sure if they can be reduced further. Let me try dividing 177 by 3: 5+7=12, which is divisible by 3. So 177/3=59. 308 divided by 3 is not a whole number. So the fraction is 59/308.

Wait, no, 308 divided by 4 is 77, perhaps. So 59/308 is approximately 0.191. Wait, wait, no, let me compute 59 divided by 308. 308 goes into 59 zero times. 308*0.19 is 58.52 (because 308*0.1=30.8, 308*0.09=27.72; 30.8+27.72=58.52). So 0.19 gives 58.52, which is close to 59. So 59/308 ≈ 0.191, or about 0.1918.

Wait wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach. Let's see, 354 divided by 616.

Let me compute 354 ÷ 616. Let's see, 616 * 0.5 is 308. 354 is 46 more than 308. So 0.5 + (46/616). 46 divided by 616 is approximately 0.0747 (since 46*2=92, 92/616=0.1494, wait no: 46/616 = 0.07466). So total is 0.5 + 0.07466 ≈ 0.57466. Oh wait, so X_A is approximately 0.5747, and X_B is 1 - 0.5747 = 0.4253.

So the solution would have a mole fraction of benzene around 0.574 and toluene around 0.426. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Benzene 0.574, Toluene 0.426. That's exactly what I got.

Option G is Benzene 0.426, Toluene 0.574, which is the opposite.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the total vapor pressure of an ideal solution is the sum of the partial vapor pressures of its components. For a benzene-toluene solution, the total vapor pressure is given by:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = X_A \cdot P_A^0 + X_B \cdot P_B^0
\]

where \(X_A\) and \(X_B\) are the mole fractions of benzene and toluene, respectively, and \(P_A^0\) and \(P_B^0\) are their pure vapor pressures. At 90°C, \(P_A^0 = 1022 \, \text{Torr}\) and \(P_B^0 = 406 \, \text{Torr}\). The solution boils when \(P_{\text{total}} = 1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{Torr}\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
760 = X_A \cdot 1022 + X_B \cdot 406
\]

Since the solution is binary, \(X_A + X_B = 1\), so \(X_B = 1 - X_A\). Substituting \(X_B\) into the equation:

\[
760 = X_A \cdot 1022 + (1 - X_A) \cdot 406
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
760 = 1022X_A + 406 - 406X_A
\]

\[
760 - 406 = (1022 - 406)X_A
\]

\[
354 = 616X_A
\]

Solving for \(X_A\):

\[
X_A = \frac{354}{616} \approx 0.5747
\]

Thus, \(X_B = 1 - X_A \approx 0.4253\). The composition of the solution is approximately 57.47% benzene and 42.53% toluene.

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: Benzene: 0.574, Toluene: 0.426**
