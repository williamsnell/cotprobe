Okay, so I've got this question about camera lenses and diffraction. Hmm, I remember that when a lens is stopped down too much, diffraction can limit the image quality. The question is about finding out how far you can stop down before this happens.

The given parameters are: focal length is 50 mm, diameter is 25 mm, and the resolution is 200 lines per millimeter. I think the key here is to calculate the point where the aperture causes diffraction to degrade the image beyond the lens's resolving power.

Wait, I remember something about the resolving power of a lens. The formula for resolving power is usually R = 2 * N * A, but wait no, that's not exactly it. Oh right, the resolving power (in lines per millimeter) is given by the formula R = (2 * N) / λ, where N is the numerical aperture. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the resolution is related to the wavelength of light and the aperture.

Wait, another approach is the Rayleigh criterion. The resolving limit is when the diffraction limit equals the system's resolution. The formula for the diffraction limit is θ = 1.22 * λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. The resolution R is related to this angle θ, since R is the number of lines per millimeter that can be resolved. 

The formula I think I need is R = (2 / θ) / (f), but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. Oh wait, the resolving power R is given by R = (2 * D) / (λ * f). Or maybe R = (2 * D) / (λ) * (1/f), which would make sense because larger D, higher resolution.

Wait, another formula comes to mind. The maximum number of lines per millimeter that a lens can resolve is given by R = (2 * D) / (λ * f). Or wait, maybe R = (2 * D) / (λ) * (1/f), which is the same thing. Let me check the units: D is in mm, λ in mm, f in mm. So R would be lines per mm, which matches the question.

So rearranging that formula, R = (2 * D) / (λ * f). Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe another approach: the minimum resolvable distance (x) on the film is given by x = λ * f / D. And the number of lines per mm is R = 1/x, so R = D/(λ f). But wait, that would be R = D/(λ f), but I think I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere because I remember the Rayleigh formula involves 1.22 λ.

Wait, the Rayleigh formula for the resolving limit is θ = 1.22 λ / D. Then, the angle θ relates to the resolution on the film plane. The maximum number of lines per mm you can resolve is R = (1/(x)) * (1/θ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (2 D) / (λ f). Let me think: D is the diameter, f is the focal length. So if R is given as 200 lines/mm, then we can solve for the minimum D where the diffraction limit equals the system's resolution.

Wait, let's try this. The diffraction limit is R = 2 * (1.22) * (λ) / (D) * (f). Or wait, perhaps R = (2 D) / (λ f) is the correct formula?

Wait, let me find the correct formula. The resolving power R (lines per millimeter) of a lens is given by R = (2 D) / (λ f). So, solving for D: D = (R λ f) / 2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula, so maybe I should think differently. Let's model it this way: the maximum number of lines a lens can resolve is determined by the diffraction limit. So when the aperture is such that the diffraction limit equals the system's capability, that's the point beyond which stopping down causes issues.

So the formula for the maximum number of lines per mm is R = (2 D) / (λ f), where D is the diameter, λ is the wavelength of light, and f is the focal length.

Assuming we're using green light, λ is about 550 nm, which is 0.00055 mm.

Given R = 200 lines/mm, f = 50 mm.

Plugging into R = (2 D) / (λ f):

200 = (2 * D) / (0.00055 * 50)

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.00055 *50 = 0.0275 mm.

So 2D / 0.0275 = 200.

Multiply both sides by 0.0275: 2D = 200 * 0.0275.

200 * 0.0275 = 5.5.

So 2D =5.5 → D=2.75 mm.

Wait, but the options given don't have 2.75. The closest is option F:2 mm, or H:6 mm, I:3 mm, etc. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (2 f) ?

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Because the resolving power is R = (2 D) / (λ f). Or is it R = (D) / (λ f) * something.

Wait, another approach. The resolving power formula I've seen is R = (2 D) / (λ f), but perhaps I should double-check. Let me think about the units: R is lines/mm, D is mm, λ is mm, f is mm.

So (2 D) / (λ f) would have units (mm) / (mm * mm) ) = 1/mm², which doesn't make sense. Oh wait, that can't be right. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is R = (2 D) / (λ) * (1/f). Because then the units would be (mm) / (mm) * (1/mm) ) → 1/mm², which still doesn't give lines/mm. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the formula with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (D) / (λ f) * 2, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, the Rayleigh criterion says that the minimum resolvable distance x is x = 1.22 λ f / D. Then, the number of lines per millimeter R is 1/x, so R = D/(1.22 λ f).

So R = D/(1.22 λ f).

Yes, this makes sense. Because if D increases, R increases, which is correct. So R is proportional to D.

So rearranging to find D: D = R * 1.22 λ f.

Given R is 200 lines/mm, λ is 550 nm (0.00055 mm), f is 50 mm.

So D = 200 * 1.22 * 0.00055 * 50.

Let me compute this.

First, compute 200 * 1.22 = 244.

Then, 244 * 0.00055 = let's see, 244 * 0.0005 is 0.122, and 244 * 0.00005 is 0.0122. So total is 0.1342.

Then multiply by 50: 0.1342 * 50 = 6.71 mm.

Wait, so D is about 6.71 mm. But the lens's maximum aperture is 25 mm diameter, so stopping down to 6.71 mm would be when diffraction starts to limit the resolution.

So the question is, how far can it be stopped down before this happens. So the maximum aperture without hitting the diffraction limit is 6.71 mm. So if the current aperture is 25 mm, you can stop it down to 6.71 mm, beyond which image quality degrades.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:6 mm. But wait, 6.71 is about 6.7, which is closer to 7 mm. Option E is 7 mm. Or perhaps 6.71 is approximately 6.7, so maybe 7 is the intended answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Let me compute D again:

D = R * 1.22 * λ * f.

R is 200, λ is 0.00055 mm, f is 50 mm.

So 200 * 1.22 = 244.

244 * 0.00055 = let's compute 244 * 0.0005 = 0.122, 244 *0.00005=0.0122, so sum is 0.1342.

0.1342 *50 = 6.71 mm.

So about 6.71 mm, so 6.7 mm. The options are H:6, E:7.

Hmm. But perhaps we should round to the nearest mm, which would be 7 mm, so option E.

Wait, but the question is, how far can it be stopped down before diffraction effects begin to limit image quality. So when the aperture is smaller than this D, then diffraction becomes limiting.

Wait, but the formula gives when the resolution is equal to the diffraction limit. So when you stop down beyond that diameter, the resolution is worse than the system's capability.

Wait, no. Wait, the lens's maximum resolution without diffraction is 200 lines/mm. When you stop down to D=6.71 mm, the diffraction limit allows 200 lines/mm. So if you stop down to a smaller D (i.e., larger f-stop), the diffraction limit would be worse than 200, so the actual resolution would drop below 200.

So the maximum D where diffraction doesn't limit is 6.71 mm. So you can stop down to D=6.71 mm, beyond which (smaller apertures) the image quality is limited.

So the stopping down is reducing the aperture. So the maximum allowable aperture (minimum f-stop) is when D is 6.71 mm. So the answer should be approximately 7 mm.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:7 mm. But wait, the options have H as 6 mm and E as7 mm. So perhaps the correct answer is E:7 mm.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I should use the formula R = (2 D)/(λ f). Let me try that approach.

So with R=200, λ=0.00055, f=50.

200 = (2 D) / (0.00055 *50)

Compute denominator: 0.00055 *50 = 0.0275.

So 200 = (2 D) / 0.0275 → 2 D = 200 *0.0275 → 2D =5.5 → D=2.75 mm. That's way smaller, so 2.75 mm. But that's much smaller than the options. So maybe this formula is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct approach is the first one, leading to D≈6.7 mm. So the answer is E:7 mm.

But wait, the options have H as 6 mm and E as7 mm. So perhaps the intended answer is H:6 mm, but my calculation says 6.7. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different wavelength or formula.

Wait, maybe the formula uses R = (D) / (λ f) * something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (2 D)/(λ f), but without the 1.22 factor. Because sometimes the factor is omitted and just 2 is used instead of 1.22.

In that case, let's recalculate.

R = (2 D) / (λ f)

200 = (2 D)/(0.00055 *50)

Denominator: 0.0275.

So 2 D = 200 *0.0275 →5.5 → D=2.75 mm.

Again, that's way too small, which doesn't match the options.

So perhaps the correct formula is R = D/(1.22 λ f), which gives 6.71 mm.

So the answer is approximately 7 mm, which is option E.

But looking back at the options, E is7 mm, which is the closest to 6.71 mm. So I think the correct answer is E.

To determine how far the lens can be stopped down before diffraction effects limit image quality, we use the formula for the resolving power of a lens, which is given by:

\[
R = \frac{D}{1.22 \lambda f}
\]

Where:
- \( R \) is the resolution in lines per millimeter (200 lines/mm in this case),
- \( D \) is the diameter of the aperture in mm,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light (assumed to be 550 nm or \( 0.00055 \, \text{mm} \)),
- \( f \) is the focal length of the lens in mm (50 mm in this case).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( D \):

\[
D = R \cdot 1.22 \cdot \lambda \cdot f
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
D = 200 \cdot 1.22 \cdot 0.00055 \cdot 50
\]

First, calculate \( 200 \cdot 1.22 = 244 \). Then, \( 244 \cdot 0.00055 = 0.1342 \). Finally, \( 0.1342 \cdot 50 = 6.71 \, \text{mm} \).

This means the lens can be stopped down to approximately \( 6.71 \, \text{mm} \) before diffraction effects begin to limit the image quality. Among the provided options, the closest value is \( 7 \, \text{mm} \), which corresponds to option E.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E**
