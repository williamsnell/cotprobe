Question:

Two brothers owned a parcel of real estate as joint tenants. Both brothers signed a deed as grantors conveying the land to the buyer. The first brother handed the deed to the second brother with instructions to take the deed to their lawyer for approval prior to delivery. Brother two, without his brother's permission, took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price. Is this a good deed as to partner one?

Options:

A: Yes, the deed was signed by both partners, which proved their intent to sell to buyer, and it was delivered at the time of signing by the fact of affixing their signatures to the document.
B: Yes, the deed is valid as the buyer was not aware of the internal agreement between the two brothers.
C: No, the deed is invalid as partner one did not give explicit permission for partner two to deliver the deed.
D: Yes, the deed is valid as partner two had the authority to finalize the deal.
E: No, the deed is invalid because partner two collected the sale price without partner one's consent.
F: Yes, the deed is valid as both brothers had signed it, signifying their agreement to the sale.
G: Yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because partner two was partner one's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.
H: No, the deed was invalid as to both grantors because partner two stepped outside his scope of authority.
I: No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.
J: No, the deed is not valid as the lawyer did not approve it before delivery.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about joint tenants and deeds. Hmm, I remember that joint tenants own property together, and typically, when they transfer property, both need to agree. The question is about whether a deed is valid in a specific scenario.

So the setup is two brothers owning a parcel as joint tenants. Both signed a deed as grantors to convey the land to a buyer. Brother one gave the deed to brother two with instructions to take it to their lawyer for approval before delivery. But brother two didn't do that. Instead, he took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price without his brother's permission. The question is whether this deed is good as to partner one.

I need to figure out if the deed is valid. I think about the elements of a valid deed. A deed must be delivered with the intent to transfer ownership. Delivery is a key element. So even if the grantor signs the deed, if it's not delivered, it's not valid.

In this case, both brothers signed the deed. But brother one only handed it to brother two for a specific purpose: to get the lawyer's approval before delivery. So brother one didn't intend for the deed to be delivered yet. Brother two went ahead and delivered it anyway.

So the issue is whether the delivery by brother two counts as valid delivery for both. Since they are joint tenants, each has an interest, but I think each needs to deliver the deed for their own interest. Alternatively, maybe brother two had authority to deliver on behalf of brother one.

Wait, in joint tenancy, each owns the whole, but for a transfer, each must convey their own interest. So if brother one didn't intend to deliver the deed, then brother two's delivery might not bind brother one.

Another point: when brother one gave the deed to brother two, was that considered a conditional delivery? Like, only to the lawyer for approval. So maybe the delivery wasn't effective until the lawyer approved. Brother two delivering it directly might not count because it wasn't in accordance with the instructions.

So in terms of delivery, if brother one didn't intend for the deed to become effective until after the lawyer approved, then brother two's actions might not constitute a valid delivery. Therefore, the deed wouldn't be effective as to brother one.

Looking at the options, option C says the deed is invalid because partner one didn't give permission to deliver. Option I says it's not valid because partner one didn't participate in delivery and didn't intend to deliver at that time.

Option A says it's valid because both signed and delivery was at signing. But I think delivery isn't just signing; it's the act of transferring the deed with the intent to pass title. So just signing it and handing it to brother two for a limited purpose doesn't count as delivery.

Option F says yes because both signed, showing agreement. But I think the delivery is the issue, not the signature.

Option G talks about apparent agency. If brother two was acting as brother one's agent, maybe. But was there any indication that brother two had authority to deliver the deed? Brother one told him to take it to the lawyer, not to deliver. So maybe he wasn't acting as an agent for delivery.

So option I seems correct. Brother one didn't intend to deliver the deed when he gave it to brother two, so the delivery by brother two doesn't count for him. So the deed isn't valid as to partner one.

Another angle: could brother two's delivery bind both? In joint tenancy, I think each must deliver their own interest. So if brother one didn't deliver, his interest isn't transferred.

So the answer should be that the deed isn't valid as to partner one because he didn't intend for the deed to be delivered yet. So looking at the options, I think option C or I.

Option C: No, invalid because no explicit permission to deliver. Option I: No, because partner one didn't participate in delivery and didn't intend to deliver at that time.

I think option I is more precise because it's about the intent to deliver. The key issue is that the delivery requires the grantor's intent to transfer. So when brother one gave the deed to brother two, his intent was for it to go to the lawyer, not for delivery. So when brother two delivered it, he acted without the necessary intent from brother one.

So the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around the validity of a deed where two brothers, as joint tenants, signed a deed but one brother (Brother Two) delivered it to the buyer without the other's (Brother One) permission. The key issue is whether the deed was effectively delivered, as delivery requires the grantor's intent to transfer ownership.

When Brother One handed the deed to Brother Two, it was with the specific instruction to take it to their lawyer for approval before delivery. This indicates that Brother One did not intend for the deed to be delivered at that time. Delivery of a deed requires more than just signing; it requires the grantor's intent to transfer title. Brother Two's act of delivering the deed directly to the buyer, without Brother One's consent, does not constitute valid delivery as to Brother One because it was outside the scope of the instructions given.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because signing the deed does not automatically constitute delivery; intent to deliver is required.
- **Option C** is partially correct but less precise, as the issue is not just lack of permission but the absence of intent to deliver.
- **Option I** is the most accurate because it directly addresses the lack of intent by Brother One to deliver the deed at the time Brother Two acted.

Thus, the deed is not valid as to Brother One because he did not intend for the deed to be delivered when he handed it to Brother Two, and Brother Two's actions exceeded the scope of his instructions.

Answer: I
