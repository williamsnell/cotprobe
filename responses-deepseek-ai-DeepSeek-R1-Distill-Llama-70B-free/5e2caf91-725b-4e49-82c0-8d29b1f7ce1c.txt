Okay, so I've got this physics problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Uranium-238 decays into Thorium-234 and Helium-4. The reaction is given as ^238_92U → ^234_90Th + ^4_2He. I need to calculate the energy released in this reaction. They've given me the exact masses of each isotope: U-238 is 238.0508 amu, Th-234 is 234.0437 amu, and He-4 is 4.0026 amu. Also, there's a conversion factor: 1.0073 amu equals 1.673 × 10^-24 grams. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, the energy released comes from the mass defect. Mass defect is the difference between the mass of the reactants and the products. Because according to Einstein's equation, E=mc², so the mass lost is converted into energy. So I think I should calculate the mass before and after the reaction and then find the difference.

Wait, but wait. In this decay, the Uranium is splitting into Thorium and Helium. So the reactant is just U-238, and the products are Th-234 and He-4. So the total mass before is just the mass of U-238. The total mass after is the sum of the masses of Th-234 and He-4.

So mass before = 238.0508 amu.

Mass after = 234.0437 + 4.0026 = let me calculate that. 234.0437 +4 is 238.0437, plus 0.0026 gives 238.0463 amu.

So the mass defect Δm is mass before minus mass after. So 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. Wait, that's a small number, but amu is a small unit, so maybe that's correct.

Wait, let me double-check the addition. 234.0437 +4.0026: 234 +4 is 238, 0.0437 + 0.0026 is 0.0463. So 238.0463 amu. So the mass defect is 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. So that's 4.5 ×10^-3 amu.

But wait, I think I need to make sure about the exact calculation. Let me recalculate:

234.0437 + 4.0026 = 234.0437 +4 = 238.0437, then +0.0026 makes it 238.0463. So yes, mass defect is 0.0045 amu.

Now, I need to convert this mass defect into energy. The formula is E = Δm × c², but since Δm is in amu, I need to convert amu to kg or grams first, then apply the conversion.

Wait, the given conversion is 1.0073 amu = 1.673e-24 grams. So 1 amu is (1.673e-24 g) / 1.0073. Let me calculate that.

So 1 amu = 1.673e-24 / 1.0073 ≈ let's compute that. 1.673e-24 divided by approximately 1.0073.

Let me approximate 1.0073 as about 1. So 1 amu ≈ 1.673e-24 g. But maybe I should be precise here.

Let me compute 1.673e-24 / 1.0073.

Compute 1.673 / 1.0073 first. Let's see, 1.0073 times 1.66 is about 1.673, because 1.0073 * 1.66 ≈ 1.673. So 1.673 / 1.0073 ≈ 1.66.

So 1 amu ≈ 1.66e-24 grams.

Wait, maybe a more accurate calculation is better. Let me compute 1.673 / 1.0073.

1.0073 * 1.66 = 1.0073 * 1.6 is 1.61168, plus 1.0073*0.06 = 0.060438. So total 1.61168 + 0.060438 = 1.672118. Which is very close to 1.673, so 1.66 is a good approximation. So 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-24 grams.

So, the mass defect is 0.0045 amu. So Δm = 0.0045 amu × (1.66e-24 g/amu) = let's compute that.

0.0045 * 1.66e-24 = 0.00747e-24 grams? No, wait, 0.0045 * 1.66 is 0.00747, so it's 7.47e-3 * 1e-24 → 7.47e-27 grams.

Wait, 0.0045 * 1.66 = 0.00747. So 0.00747 × 1e-24 → 7.47 × 10^-27 grams.

Wait, no, 1.66e-24 × 0.0045 → 0.0045 * 1.66 = 0.00747. So 7.47e-3 * 1e-24 → 7.47e-27 grams. So that's Δm.

Now, using E=Δm c². But what's the value of c in cm/s? Because I think the unit erg is g cm²/s². So let's make sure.

c is speed of light, approximately 3e10 cm/s.

So E = (7.47e-27 g) * (3e10 cm/s)^2.

Compute (3e10)^2 = 9e20 cm²/s².

So E = 7.47e-27 g * 9e20 cm²/s² = (7.47 *9) * 1e-27+20 = 67.23 * 1e-7.

Wait, 7.47 *9 is 67.23? Let me check: 7 *9=63, 0.47*9=4.23 → 63+4.23=67.23. Right.

So 67.23e-7 ergs.

Wait, because 1e-27 * 1e20 is 1e-7.

So 67.23e-7 ergs is 6.723e-6 ergs.

But wait, let me calculate this again.

Wait, 7.47e-27 g * 9e20 (cm²/s²) → 7.47 *9 = 67.23, times 1e(-27+20) → 1e-7. So yes, 67.23e-7 ergs is 6.723e-6 ergs.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.72 ×10^-6 ergs. Option E is 5.49e-6, and option I is 5.22e-6. So 6.72e-6 is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check each step.

First, the mass defect calculation:

Uranium mass: 238.0508 amu.

Thorium: 234.0437, He:4.0026. Sum is 234.0437 +4.0026 = 238.0463 amu.

Mass defect is 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. Correct.

Convert amu to grams: 1 amu = 1.673e-24 /1.0073 ≈ 1.66e-24 g.

So 0.0045 amu * 1.66e-24 g/amu = 0.00747e-24 g → 7.47e-27 g.

E=mc²: c=3e10 cm/s.

E=7.47e-27 g * (3e10 cm/s)^2.

Calculate 3e10 squared: 9e20 cm²/s².

Multiply 7.47e-27 *9e20= (7.47 *9) *1e(-27+20)=67.23 *1e-7 → 6.723e-6 ergs.

Yes, which matches option C: 6.72 ×10^-6 ergs.

Wait, but let me make sure about the mass conversion again. Because the given conversion is 1.0073 amu = 1.673e-24 grams.

Wait, wait! I think I made a mistake here. Because 1 amu is actually 1.6605e-24 grams, but the problem gives 1.0073 amu = 1.673e-24 grams. So perhaps I should calculate 1 amu as (1.673e-24 g) /1.0073.

So let's compute that precisely.

1.673e-24 /1.0073 = approximately 1.66e-24 grams per amu.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.0073 times 1.66 is approximately 1.673.

Wait, 1.0073 × 1.66 = ?

1.0073 ×1.6 = 1.61168.

1.0073 ×0.06 = 0.060438.

So 1.61168 + 0.060438 = 1.672118, which is just under 1.673. So the exact value would be slightly higher than 1.66, but maybe around 1.6605 as the standard value.

Wait, but perhaps for the problem, using 1.0073 amu =1.673e-24 grams, so 1 amu = (1.673e-24) / 1.0073 ≈ 1.66e-24 grams.

So my previous calculation of 1 amu as 1.66e-24 grams is correct.

So the rest follows, leading to 6.72e-6 ergs, option C.

But let me check the options again. The options are:

A:3.36e-6

B:1.01e-5

C:6.72e-6

D:8.96e-6

E:5.49e-6

F:2.54e-6

G:7.85e-6

H:4.11e-6

I:5.22e-6

J:9.08e-6

So 6.72e-6 is option C. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The mass defect is 0.0045 amu, right? Which is 4.5e-3 amu. Then multiplied by 1.66e-24 grams per amu gives 4.5e-3 *1.66e-24= 7.47e-27 grams.

Then E= m c² =7.47e-27 * (3e10)^2.

Wait, let's compute this more accurately.

(3e10)^2 =9e20.

So 7.47e-27 *9e20 = (7.47 *9) *1e(-27 +20) = 67.23 *1e-7.

67.23e-7 ergs is 6.723e-6 ergs, which is 6.72 when rounded to three significant figures.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be option C.

To calculate the energy released in the radioactive decay of Uranium-238 into Thorium-234 and Helium-4, we use the mass defect and Einstein's equation \( E = \Delta m c^2 \). The given masses are:

- \( ^{238}_{92}\text{U} = 238.0508 \, \text{amu} \),
- \( ^{234}_{90}\text{Th} = 234.0437 \, \text{amu} \),
- \( ^{4}_{2}\text{He} = 4.0026 \, \text{amu} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the mass defect
The mass before the reaction is the mass of Uranium-238:
\[
\text{Mass before} = 238.0508 \, \text{amu}.
\]
The mass after the reaction is the sum of the masses of Thorium-234 and Helium-4:
\[
\text{Mass after} = 234.0437 + 4.0026 = 238.0463 \, \text{amu}.
\]
The mass defect is the difference between the mass before and after:
\[
\Delta m = 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 \, \text{amu}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert the mass defect to grams
Using the conversion factor \( 1.0073 \, \text{amu} = 1.673 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g} \), we find:
\[
1 \, \text{amu} = \frac{1.673 \times 10^{-24}}{1.0073} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g}.
\]
Thus, the mass defect in grams is:
\[
\Delta m = 0.0045 \, \text{amu} \times 1.66 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g/amu} = 7.47 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{g}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the energy released
Using \( E = \Delta m c^2 \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \), we compute:
\[
E = (7.47 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{g}) \times (3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s})^2.
\]
First, calculate \( c^2 \):
\[
c^2 = (3 \times 10^{10})^2 = 9 \times 10^{20} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]
Now, calculate \( E \):
\[
E = 7.47 \times 10^{-27} \times 9 \times 10^{20} = 67.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{ergs}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
E = 6.723 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{ergs}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated energy is approximately \( 6.72 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{ergs} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
