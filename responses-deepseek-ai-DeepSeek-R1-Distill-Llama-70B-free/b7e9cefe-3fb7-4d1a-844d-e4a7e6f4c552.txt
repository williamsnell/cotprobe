Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again: "Two related species evolve in a way that makes them less similar." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my evolutionary terms, but let's think it through.

Alright, the key here is that two species are becoming less similar. Wait, when I learned about evolution, I remember that when species diverge, they become more different over time. Oh, right, that's called divergent evolution. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Wait, coevolution is when two species influence each other's evolution, like a predator and prey. That doesn't necessarily make them less similar; it's more about how they evolve together. So A is probably not the right choice.

Punctuated equilibrium, B, I think that's about the rate of evolution. It suggests that species remain stable for a long time and then rapidly evolve. Not directly related to similarity between two species.

Directional selection, C, is a type of natural selection where one extreme of a trait is favored, causing the population to shift. But that's about a single species' change, not two becoming less similar.

Divergent evolution, D, yes, that sounds right. It's when two species become more dissimilar because they're adapting to different environments or ecological niches. Like how different birds might evolve from a common ancestor to live in different habitats.

Convergent evolution, E, is the opposite. That's when unrelated species become more similar because they're adapting to similar environments. Like dolphins and sharks both having fins for swimming.

Gradualism, F, refers to the idea that evolution occurs slowly and steadily over time, as opposed to in quick bursts. Not about similarity between species.

Speciation, G, is the formation of new species. While that can lead to divergence, the question is specifically about becoming less similar, which is more about the process than the result. So maybe not G.

Adaptive radiation, H, is when a single species splits into multiple species that adapt to different ecological roles. Like the finches in the Gal√°pagos. But again, that's more about speciation and diversification, not necessarily two species becoming less similar.

Parallel evolution, I, is when similar traits evolve in different species because they faced similar environments. So they become more similar in some aspects, not less.

Stabilizing selection, J, selects against extreme traits, keeping the population more uniform. So that's about maintaining similarity, not increasing difference.

Putting it all together, the correct term should be divergent evolution. So the answer must be D.

The correct answer is D: Divergent evolution. This term describes the process where two related species become more dissimilar over time due to different environmental pressures or ecological niches.
