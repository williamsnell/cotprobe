Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Doppler effect and calculating the speed of a car. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that a researcher hears the frequency of a car horn drop from 284 Hz to 266 Hz as the car passes by. The speed of sound in air is given as 1100 ft/s. I need to find the speed of the car in mph. The options are from A to J, but I'll focus on the calculations first.

Wait, the Doppler effect... right. When a source of sound moves relative to an observer, the observed frequency changes. If the source is moving towards the observer, the frequency increases (like a higher pitch), and when moving away, the frequency decreases (lower pitch). So in this case, the car is moving away because the frequency drops from 284 to 266.

The formula for the Doppler effect when the source is moving away is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v + vs), but wait, no, I might be mixing this up. Let me think again. Oh right, when the source is moving away, the observed frequency is f' = f * v / (v + vs), where v is the speed of sound, vs is the speed of the source (car), and vo is the speed of the observer. Since the observer is stationary, vo is zero. So the formula simplifies to f' = f * v / (v + vs).

Wait, but wait. Because the car is moving towards the observer first, causing the frequency to be higher, and then moves away, causing it to be lower. But in this problem, the observer hears the change from a higher to a lower frequency as the car passes. So the initial frequency when approaching is 284, and after passing, it's 266. But actually, the problem states that the frequency appears to drop from 284 to 266 as the automobile passes him. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify whether the 284 is when approaching and 266 when moving away. That makes sense.

So the two observed frequencies are for when the car is approaching (f1 = 284 Hz) and when it's moving away (f2 = 266 Hz). Wait, but how do I use these two frequencies to find the speed of the car?

Alternatively, perhaps each frequency corresponds to when the car is approaching and then moving away. But I think the problem gives the two frequencies as the car passes, so maybe we can find the speed using the beat frequency or something else. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The Doppler effect causes a shift in frequency. When the car is approaching, the observed frequency is higher, and when it's moving away, it's lower. So the two frequencies are consecutive observations as the car passes. But how do I get the speed from that? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the frequency shifts from 284 Hz to 266 Hz as the car passes, and the difference between these is used in some way. Or maybe each frequency is measured as the car approaches and then as it moves away, allowing us to set up two equations.

Wait, let me write down what I know. The speed of sound v is 1100 ft/s. The source emits a frequency f. When the car is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is f_approach = f * v / (v - vs), because the source is moving towards the observer, so vs is subtracted in the denominator. When the car is moving away, the observed frequency is f_recede = f * v / (v + vs).

But wait, in this scenario, the observer hears the frequency change from 284 Hz to 266 Hz as the car passes. So when the car is approaching, f_approach is 284, and when it's moving away, f_recede is 266. But wait, that doesn't seem right because when moving away, the frequency would be lower than the actual emitted frequency f. So perhaps the emitted frequency is in between these two. Or maybe the emitted frequency f is what the observer would hear if the car were stationary.

Wait, that's an important point. The emitted frequency f is the frequency when the car is not moving relative to the observer. So when the car is moving towards, the observed frequency f_approach = f * v/(v - vs), and when moving away, f_recede = f * v/(v + vs). So perhaps the problem is giving f_approach as 284 and f_recede as 266. So I can set up two equations and solve for vs.

So the equations would be:

284 = f * (1100) / (1100 - vs)  ...(1)

266 = f * (1100) / (1100 + vs)  ...(2)

I can divide equation (1) by equation (2) to eliminate f.

So (284)/(266) = [ (1100) / (1100 - vs) ] / [ (1100)/(1100 + vs) ) ]

Simplify the right side: (1100 + vs) / (1100 - vs)

So (284/266) = (1100 + vs)/(1100 - vs)

Let me compute 284/266. Let me see, 266 is about 266, 284 is 284. Let me calculate it as a division.

284 ÷ 266 ≈ 1.0679. Let me check: 266 * 1 = 266, 266*1.0679= 266 + (266*0.0679). 0.0679 *266 ≈ 18.05, so 266+18.05=284.05. Close enough. So 284/266 ≈ 1.0679.

So 1.0679 = (1100 + vs)/(1100 - vs)

Let me let x = vs. So:

1.0679 = (1100 + x)/(1100 - x)

Cross-multiplying:

1.0679*(1100 - x) = 1100 + x

Expand left side:

1.0679 * 1100 - 1.0679 x = 1100 + x

Calculate 1.0679 * 1100:

Well, 1 * 1100 = 1100, 0.0679*1100=74.69, so total 1174.69.

So 1174.69 - 1.0679 x = 1100 + x

Bring variables to one side and constants to the other:

1174.69 - 1100 = x + 1.0679 x

74.69 = x (1 + 1.0679) → x (2.0679) ≈74.69

So x = 74.69 / 2.0679 ≈ let me compute that.

74.69 ÷ 2.0679 ≈ let's see, 2.0679 * 36 = around 74. Let me compute 2.0679 * 36 = 2 *36=72, 0.0679*36≈2.444, so 72+2.444=74.444. So 36 gives approximately 74.444, which is close to 74.69. So x ≈36 ft/s.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the speed of the car would be 36 ft/s. But the options are in mph, so let me convert that.

Wait, 1 ft/s is approximately 0.6818 mph. So 36 ft/s * 0.6818 ≈ 24.565 mph. Hmm, that's about 24.5 mph. Looking at the options, option I is 24.5 mph. So would that be the answer?

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So let's check the steps again.

We had 284/266 ≈1.0679 = (1100 + x)/(1100 -x)

Then cross-multiplied: 1.0679*(1100 -x)=1100 +x

Which expands to 1174.69 -1.0679x = 1100 +x

Subtract 1100 from both sides: 74.69 -1.0679x =x

Add 1.0679x to both sides: 74.69 = 2.0679x → x=74.69 /2.0679.

Compute 74.69 /2.0679. Let me do this division more accurately.

2.0679 * 36 = 74.4444 as before.

74.69 -74.4444 = 0.2456.

Now, 0.2456 /2.0679 ≈ 0.1186.

So x=36.1186 ft/s. Let's approximate it as 36.12 ft/s.

Now, converting to mph: 36.12 ft/s * 0.681818 (since 1 ft/s = 0.681818 mph).

Compute 36 *0.681818 = 24.545 mph.

0.12 ft/s is 0.12 *0.681818≈0.0818 mph.

So total is 24.545 +0.0818≈24.626 mph. So approximately 24.6 mph.

Looking back at the options, option I is 24.5 mph. So that's very close. So the correct answer should be I:24.5 mph.

But wait, let me think again. Because when the car is moving towards the observer, the formula is f_approach = f * v/(v - vs), and when moving away, f_recede = f *v/(v + vs). So the emitted frequency f would be when the car is stationary. So perhaps I should find f first, but in this case, the two frequencies observed are f_approach and f_recede, so the method of dividing the two equations to eliminate f is correct.

Wait, but what if the problem is only considering the change in frequency as the car passes, perhaps using the beat frequency? Hmm, no, I don't think that's applicable here. The beat frequency is when two frequencies interfere, but in this case, it's a change in observed frequency as the car moves from approaching to moving away.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the average of the two frequencies. Wait, but I don't think that's the approach. The method I used seems correct, using the two Doppler-shifted frequencies to solve for vs.

Wait, but let me check the initial assumption. I assumed that f_approach is 284 and f_recede is 266. But perhaps the problem presents the situation where the car is moving away, and the frequency drops from 284 to 266. Wait, that's not possible because when the car is moving away, the frequency should be lower than the emitted frequency. So perhaps I have the equations reversed.

Wait, perhaps when the car is moving towards, the observed frequency is higher than f, and when moving away, it's lower. So if the car passes the observer, the frequency would drop from a higher value (when approaching) to a lower value (when moving away). So the 284 Hz would be when approaching, and 266 when moving away. So my initial approach was correct.

So the calculation leads to vs≈36.12 ft/s, which is about 24.6 mph. The closest option is I:24.5 mph.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the numbers again.

Calculate 284/266: 284 ÷ 266 ≈ 1.0679.

Set up equation: 1.0679 = (1100 + vs)/(1100 - vs)

Cross-multiplied:

1.0679*(1100 - vs) = 1100 + vs

Compute 1.0679 * 1100: 1.0679 * 1100.

1.0679 * 1000 = 1067.9, 1.0679 * 100 = 106.79 → 1067.9 + 106.79 = 1174.69.

So 1174.69 -1.0679 vs = 1100 + vs → 1174.69 -1100 = vs +1.0679 vs →74.69= vs (1 +1.0679)= vs * 2.0679 → vs=74.69 /2.0679≈36.12 ft/s.

Convert to mph: 36.12 ft/s * 0.681818 mph/(ft/s) → 36 *0.681818 = 24.545, 0.12 *0.681818≈0.0818 → total ≈24.626 mph. So about 24.6 mph, which is closest to option I:24.5 mph.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations for 284/266.

Compute 284 ÷ 266:

266 × 1 =266 → 284 -266=18. So 1 + 18/266 =1.06764...

So 1.067647.

Then, 1.067647 = (1100 + vs)/(1100 - vs)

Multiply both sides by (1100 - vs)(1100 + vs) denominator.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to let’s solve for vs algebraically.

We have:

(284/266) = (v + vs)/(v - vs)

Cross-multiplying:

284*(v - vs) =266*(v + vs)

Expand:

284v -284 vs =266v +266 vs

Bring like terms together:

284v -266v = 284 vs +266 vs → 18v = 550 vs

So vs = (18v)/550

Wait, wait, that seems a different approach, perhaps a miscalculation. Let me see.

Wait, 284v -284 vs =266v +266 vs → 284v -266v = 284 vs +266 vs → 18v = (284 +266) vs → 18v =550 vs → vs= (18v)/(550)

Wait, that's a different way to approach it. Let me plug in v=1100 ft/s.

So vs= (18*1100)/550 = (19800)/550. Let's compute that.

19800 ÷550. Let me compute 550 ×36=19800. Because 550 ×30=16500, 550×6=3300 → 16500+3300=19800. So 36.

So vs=36 ft/s.

Wait, this is a much cleaner approach. Then, 36 ft/s is the speed of the car.

Wait, but earlier I got approximately 36.12 ft/s. So this method gives exactly 36 ft/s. So perhaps I made an error in the earlier approach, maybe due to rounding. Let me check.

Wait, I think I messed up the cross-multiplication step earlier. Let me try it again.

Given 284/266 = (v + vs)/(v - vs)

So 284*(v - vs) =266*(v + vs)

Expand:

284v -284 vs =266v +266 vs

Bring all terms to one side:

284v -266v -284 vs -266 vs =0 → 18v -550 vs =0 → 18v =550 vs → vs= (18v)/(550)

v is 1100 ft/s. So vs= (18*1100)/550 = (18*2)/1 → because 1100/550=2 → 18*2=36.

So vs=36 ft/s exactly.

This is a more precise calculation, without rounding errors, leading to vs=36 ft/s.

Now, convert 36 ft/s to mph.

We know that 1 ft/s = 0.681818 mph.

So 36 *0.681818 = ?

Compute 36 *0.681818:

Compute 30 *0.681818 =20.45454.

Compute 6 *0.681818=4.090908.

Add them: 20.45454 +4.090908=24.545448 mph.

So approximately 24.545 mph, which is very close to 24.5 mph, option I.

But wait, looking at the options given:

Options:

A: 30

B:20

C:32

D:28.5

E:26

F:22

G:18

H:17

I:24.5

J:35

So the correct answer would be I:24.5 mph.

Wait, but earlier I thought the car's speed came out to be approximately 24.5 mph. So yeah, that's the answer.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the Doppler effect formula for a moving source and a stationary observer. The observed frequency when the source is moving towards the observer is given by:

\[
f_{\text{approach}} = f \cdot \frac{v}{v - v_s}
\]

And when the source is moving away:

\[
f_{\text{recede}} = f \cdot \frac{v}{v + v_s}
\]

Here:
- \( f_{\text{approach}} = 284 \, \text{Hz} \) (frequency when the car is approaching),
- \( f_{\text{recede}} = 266 \, \text{Hz} \) (frequency when the car is moving away),
- \( v = 1100 \, \text{ft/s} \) (speed of sound in air),
- \( v_s \) is the speed of the car (to be determined).

Dividing the two equations eliminates \( f \), giving:

\[
\frac{f_{\text{approach}}}{f_{\text{recede}}} = \frac{v + v_s}{v - v_s}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{284}{266} = \frac{1100 + v_s}{1100 - v_s}
\]

Simplify \( \frac{284}{266} \approx 1.0679 \), so:

\[
1.0679 = \frac{1100 + v_s}{1100 - v_s}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
1.0679 \cdot (1100 - v_s) = 1100 + v_s
\]

Expanding:

\[
1174.69 - 1.0679v_s = 1100 + v_s
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
1174.69 - 1100 = v_s + 1.0679v_s
\]

\[
74.69 = 2.0679v_s
\]

Solving for \( v_s \):

\[
v_s = \frac{74.69}{2.0679} \approx 36 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Convert \( v_s \) from ft/s to mph using \( 1 \, \text{ft/s} = 0.681818 \, \text{mph} \):

\[
v_s = 36 \cdot
