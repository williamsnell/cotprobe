Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ethical psychology, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the situation.

The question says that a colleague, who's a licensed psychologist, tells me he's just ended a sexual relationship with one of his clients. And when he describes the client, I realize that I referred her to him about 18 months ago. So, the question is, as an ethical psychologist, what should I do?

The options are A through J. I'm supposed to pick the correct one based on ethical guidelines.

Hmm, I remember that psychologists have strict ethical codes, especially regarding client relationships. Sexual relationships with clients are a big no-no because they create a power imbalance and can exploit the client's vulnerability. So, this colleague has definitely crossed an ethical boundary.

Now, what's the appropriate action? Let me think about the steps a psychologist should take in such a situation.

First, I should consider whether I have a duty to report this. I think most ethical guidelines require psychologists to report unethical behavior by colleagues if it's serious enough. But how exactly should that be done?

Option A says to advise the colleague to inform the Ethics Committee himself. That might be a good first step because it gives the colleague a chance to self-report. But wait, if he doesn't take action, then what? Also, if the behavior is ongoing or severe, maybe I shouldn't just rely on him to do it.

Option B suggests contacting local authorities. I'm not sure if this situation would involve legal issues beyond the ethical code. Unless the relationship was non-consensual or involved some kind of abuse, maybe the authorities don't need to be involved right away. So, this might not be the first step.

Option C is advising the colleague to apologize. While an apology might be appropriate, it doesn't address the ethical violation. The colleague still needs to face professional consequences, so this alone isn't sufficient.

Option D is filing a complaint immediately with the Ethics Committee. That seems like a direct approach, but perhaps I should first talk to the colleague to understand the situation better. Or maybe not, because the violation is clear.

Option E is ignoring the matter. That's definitely wrong because ignoring unethical behavior can allow harm to continue and goes against the responsibility to uphold ethical standards.

Option F is informing the Ethics Committee without telling the colleague. That might be necessary if the colleague doesn't take action, but maybe I should give him a chance first.

Option G involves contacting the client. I'm not sure if that's appropriate. It could interfere with the client's privacy or the therapeutic relationship, especially if she's not my client anymore. Plus, I don't know her side of the story.

Option H suggests discussing with other colleagues. That could be helpful for getting advice, but it's not a direct action. It might also breach confidentiality if I share details without the colleague's consent.

Option I is discussing the matter further with the colleague to see his plan. That makes sense because maybe he's aware of the issue and is taking steps to correct it. It's important to approach the situation supportively but firmly.

So, thinking through, I believe the first step is to talk to the colleague. I should express concern and find out what he's planning to do. This approach respects the colleague's autonomy while ensuring that the issue is addressed. If he doesn't take appropriate action, then reporting to the Ethics Committee would be necessary.

Looking back at the options, option I is about discussing further with the colleague. That seems like the right initial step. If the colleague doesn't plan to take responsibility, then I would proceed to file a complaint, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is about what I should do as an ethical psychologist. The first step is usually to address the issue directly with the colleague, especially if it's a minor infraction, but here it's a serious one. So maybe I should report it immediately.

But then again, maybe the colleague isn't aware of the ethical implications, although that's unlikely. He's a licensed psychologist, so he should know better. So perhaps the correct action is to file a complaint, which would be option D.

Hmm, but I think the ethical guidelines suggest that you should first try to resolve the issue informally if possible. So discussing with the colleague might be the first step, and if that doesn't lead to action, then reporting.

So the immediate step would be option I: discuss the matter further to see what he plans to do. If he takes responsibility, that's good. If not, then proceed to reporting.

Therefore, the correct answer is I.

The situation involves a colleague who has engaged in a serious ethical violation by ending a sexual relationship with a client. As an ethical psychologist, it is important to address this issue appropriately. Sexual relationships with clients are strictly prohibited due to the power imbalance and potential harm to the client. 

The first step is to discuss the matter further with the colleague to understand their perspective and determine what course of action they plan to take. This approach respects the colleague's autonomy while ensuring the issue is addressed. If the colleague does not take appropriate responsibility, further action, such as filing a complaint with the Ethics Committee, would be necessary. 

Among the options provided, option I aligns with this approach as it involves discussing the matter further with the colleague before taking more formal steps.
