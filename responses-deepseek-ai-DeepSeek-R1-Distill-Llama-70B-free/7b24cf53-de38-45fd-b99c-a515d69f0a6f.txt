Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer between two materials, brass and steel. Hmm, I remember that when two objects are in contact, heat transfers between them until they reach thermal equilibrium. But wait, in this case, the outer surfaces are kept at different temperatures. So the question is about finding the temperature at the interface where they touch.

Alright, the setup: both sheets are 1 cm thick. Brass on one side, steel on the other. The outer surface of brass is at 100°C, and steel's outer surface is at 0°C. The thermal conductivities are in a 2:1 ratio. I think thermal conductivity (usually denoted as k) is a measure of how well a material conducts heat.

So I need to find the temperature at the common interface. I guess the idea is that the heat flowing through each material must be the same because they're in contact. Oh wait, right, because the heat can't accumulate at the interface; otherwise, the temperature would change until it balances out.

The formula for heat transfer is Q = (k * A * ΔT) / d, where Q is the heat, k is conductivity, A is area, ΔT is temperature difference, and d is thickness. Since the area is the same for both materials, and the thickness is the same (1 cm each), those might cancel out.

Let me denote the interface temperature as T. For brass, the temperature difference would be 100°C - T, because the outer surface is hotter than the interface. For steel, the temperature difference is T - 0°C, since the steel's outer surface is colder.

So the heat conducted through brass (Q_brass) is (k_brass * A * (100 - T)) / 1 cm. Similarly, Q_steel is (k_steel * A * (T - 0)) / 1 cm. Since the heat must be equal in steady state, Q_brass = Q_steel.

Wait, but the problem says the thermal conductivities are in a ratio of 2:1. Let me assume k_brass is 2 and k_steel is 1 for simplicity. So substituting, we have 2*(100-T) = 1*(T). Because the denominators are same and A is same, so they cancel out.

So 2*(100 - T) = T => 200 - 2T = T. Adding 2T to both sides: 200 = 3T. So T = 200/3 ≈ 66.666...°C. Oh wait, that's about 66.7°C.

Looking at the options, option D is 66.7°C. So the answer should be D.

To determine the temperature at the interface between the brass and steel sheets, we start by recognizing that the heat flowing through each material must be equal in steady state. The heat transfer formula is:

\[
Q = \frac{k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T}{d}
\]

where \(k\) is the thermal conductivity, \(A\) is the area, \(\Delta T\) is the temperature difference, and \(d\) is the thickness. Since the thickness \(d\) and area \(A\) are the same for both materials, they cancel out, leaving:

\[
Q_{\text{brass}} = Q_{\text{steel}}
\]

Let the temperature at the interface be \(T\). For brass, the temperature difference is \(100 - T\), and for steel, it is \(T - 0\). The thermal conductivities are in the ratio \(k_{\text{brass}} : k_{\text{steel}} = 2 : 1\). Substituting these into the heat transfer equation:

\[
k_{\text{brass}} \cdot (100 - T) = k_{\text{steel}} \cdot T
\]

Using \(k_{\text{brass}} = 2\) and \(k_{\text{steel}} = 1\):

\[
2 \cdot (100 - T) = T
\]

Expanding and solving for \(T\):

\[
200 - 2T = T \quad \Rightarrow \quad 200 = 3T \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.7^\circ \text{C}
\]

Thus, the temperature at the interface is approximately \(66.7^\circ \text{C}\), which corresponds to option D.
