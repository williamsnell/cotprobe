Okay, so I have this question about the characteristics of arteries, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the given options. Let me start by recalling what I know about blood vessels. 

Arteries are one of the three main types of blood vessels, the others being veins and capillaries. I remember that arteries carry blood away from the heart. Wait, isn't that right? Because the heart pumps blood out into arteries which then distribute it throughout the body. So option C says they carry blood away from the heart. That sounds correct, but I should check the other options too.

Option A says they carry blood towards the heart. No, that's what veins do, right? Veins return blood to the heart. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: They always carry deoxygenated blood. Hmm. Well, not always. I think pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, but the aorta and other systemic arteries carry oxygenated blood. So B is incorrect because it's not always true.

Option D: They contain valves. Wait, I thought valves are more common in veins, especially in the lower limbs to prevent backflow when standing. Arteries usually don't have valves because the blood is under higher pressure, so it moves in one direction without backflow. So D might not be correct.

Option E: They always carry oxygenated blood. No, like I thought earlier, pulmonary arteries don't. So E is wrong.

Option F: They have a large lumen compared to veins. Arteries usually have thicker walls because they handle higher pressure. But I'm not sure about the lumen size. I think veins have larger lumens. Wait, no, maybe arteries have smaller because the blood is under higher pressure, so maybe the lumen is smaller. Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: arteries have thick walls, but what about the diameter? Oh, wait, in general, veins have larger lumens than arteries because they can hold more blood. So F says arteries have a larger lumen than veins, which might not be right. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Responsible for gas exchange. No, that's capillaries. Capillaries are where the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients happens. So G is wrong.

Option H: They form capillaries. No, arteries branch into arterioles, which then lead to capillaries. But the arteries themselves don't form the capillaries. So H is incorrect.

Option I: They are thin-walled. No, I remember that arteries are thick-walled because they need to handle the high pressure from the heart's pumping. Veins are the thin-walled ones. So I is wrong.

Option J: They contain no muscle. No, arteries have smooth muscle in their walls, which helps regulate blood pressure. So J is incorrect.

Wait, going back, option C says they carry blood away from the heart. That sounds right. Let me confirm. Arteries are efferent vessels; they carry blood away. So C is correct.

But wait, the question is asking for the correct characteristic. So the correct answer must be C. Let me make sure there isn't another correct option. Let me go through each again.

Option F: Arteries have larger lumen than veins? I'm a bit unsure. Arteries have thick walls but I think their diameter is actually smaller than veins. Veins can expand more. So F is incorrect.

So the correct answer is C.

Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. This is a key characteristic that distinguishes them from veins, which return blood to the heart. While some options, such as carrying oxygenated blood or having large lumens, may apply in certain contexts, they are not universally true for all arteries. For example, pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood, and veins generally have larger lumens than arteries. Additionally, arteries do not contain valves, as these are more commonly found in veins to prevent backflow. Therefore, the most accurate and universally correct characteristic of arteries is that they carry blood away from the heart.

Answer: C
