Okay, I have this problem here where I'm given three equations involving a, b, and c. The problem states that a + b + c equals 1. Then, ab + ac + bc equals -4, and abc is also -4. I need to find the value of a³ + b³ + c³. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for the sum of cubes in terms of the sums of the variables, their products, etc.

Wait, the formula for a³ + b³ + c³... I think it's something like (a + b + c)³ minus three times (a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) plus three times abc. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. Oh right, the correct formula is a³ + b³ + c³ equals (a + b + c)³ minus three times (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) plus three times abc. Or maybe I have the signs wrong. Let me try to recall: I think it's a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc. No, wait, maybe there's a minus somewhere else.

Wait another approach, I remember that the sum a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed using the identity that involves the sum of the variables, sum of their products, and the product. Let me check. Oh, right, the formula is: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc. Oh wait, no, that can't be right because the dimensions don't match. Wait, let me think carefully.

The formula is actually a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Or wait, maybe it's minus 3abc. No, I think it's plus 3abc. Let me check with a simple case. Suppose a=1, b=1, c=1. Then a + b + c =3, ab + ac + bc=3, abc=1. Then a³ + b³ + c³=3. According to the formula, (3)^3 -3*(3)*(3) +3*(1) = 27 -27 +3=3, which matches. So the formula seems correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try another test. Let's take a=2, b=0, c=0. Then a³ + b³ + c³=8. According to the formula, (2+0+0)^3 -3*(2)*(0+0+0) +3*(0) =8 -0 +0=8. Correct again.

Another example: a=1, b=2, c=3. Sum is 6, sum of products is 1*2 +1*3 + 2*3=2+3+6=11. Product is 6. Then a³ +b³ +c³=1+8+27=36. According to the formula, (6)^3 -3*(6)*(11) +3*6 = 216 - 198 +18= 36. Yes, correct. So the formula is right.

So the formula is: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Now, plugging in the values given in the problem. We have a + b + c = 1. ab + ac + bc = -4. And abc = -4. Wait, wait, the problem says ab + ac + bc = abc = -4. Oh, that's interesting. So ab + bc + ac is equal to -4, and abc is also -4. So all three terms are given.

So substituting into the formula:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (1)^3 -3*(1)*(-4) +3*(-4).

Let me compute each term step by step. 

First term: (1)^3 = 1.

Second term: -3*(1)*(-4) = -3 * (-4) = 12. Because multiplying 1 and -4 gives -4, and then -3 * (-4) is +12.

Third term: 3*(-4) = -12.

Now, adding them all together: 1 +12 + (-12) = 1 +0 =1. So the sum a³ +b³ +c³ would be 1.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula again because sometimes I might confuse the signs. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

The formula is (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

So substituting the given values:

(1)^3 = 1.

Then, subtract 3*(1)*(-4): 1 - [3*(1)*(-4)].

Wait no, the formula is 1 minus 3*(1)*(-4) plus 3*(-4). So 1 +12 -12 =1. Yes, so the result is 1.

Looking at the options, option I is 1. So the answer should be I.

To find \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\), we use the identity:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc
\]

From the problem, we are given:
- \(a + b + c = 1\)
- \(ab + ac + bc = -4\)
- \(abc = -4\)

Substituting these values into the formula:

1. Compute \((a + b + c)^3\):  
   \[
   (1)^3 = 1
   \]

2. Compute \(-3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc)\):  
   \[
   -3(1)(-4) = 12
   \]

3. Compute \(3abc\):  
   \[
   3(-4) = -12
   \]

Now, add these results together:  
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 1 + 12 - 12 = 1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\) is **1**.

The correct answer is **I**.
