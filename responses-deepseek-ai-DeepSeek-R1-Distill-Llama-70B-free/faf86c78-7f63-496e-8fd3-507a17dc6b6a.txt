Okay, so I've got this question about deriving the ideal gas equation. Hmm, I remember the ideal gas law is something like PV equals nRT, right? But wait, the question says it's for 1 mole of gas, so n would be 1. That simplifies things because then the equation becomes PV = RT. 

Wait, the question is giving me V equals f(P, T). I think that's V as a function of P and T. So I need to find how V relates to P and T. 

The options are A to J. Let me think about each option. 

Option A is (PV)/(RT) = 1. If I rearrange that, it would be PV = RT. Since n is 1, that fits. But wait, the ideal gas equation is PV = nRT, so for n=1, yes, this is correct. So A looks good. 

Option B: (V/T) = P/R. Let me see. Rearranging that, V = (P R T)/R? Wait, no, if I solve for V, it's V = (P/R) * T. That would make V proportional to T and P, which doesn't seem right. Because from PV = RT, solving for V gives V = RT/(P), so V is proportional to T and inversely proportional to P. So B can't be right. 

Option C: (VT)/P = R. Rearranged, VT = PR → V = PR/(T). Wait, that's not matching. Because from PV = RT, solving for V gives V = RT/P. So option C would have V proportional to P, which is opposite of what it should be. So C is incorrect.

Option D: (VP)/T = R. So VP = RT → V = RT/(P). Oh wait, that's exactly what I have from the ideal gas law. Because with n=1, V = RT/(P). So D is also correct. Wait, what about A? A is (PV)/(RT) =1 → PV=RT. So A is correct as well. Or am I missing something here?

Wait, maybe I should look again. The question is to derive the ideal gas equation. So what's the correct form. Let's see:

The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT. For n=1 mole, it's PV = RT. So any equation that simplifies to that is correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: (PV)/(RT)=1 → PV=RT. So that's correct.

Option D: (VP)/T = R → VP = RT → V = RT/(P). So PV = RT again. So both A and D express the same equation.

Wait, but wait, the options might not all be the same. Let me think again. Are A and D the same?

Let me re-express option D: VP/T = R → VP = RT → P = RT/V → which is the same as PV=RT. So yes, D also represents the same equation. So are both A and D correct? But that can't be because the question gives only one correct answer.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "derive the ideal gas equation" given V = f(P, T). So which of the options is the correct ideal gas equation.

Wait, the correct ideal gas equation is PV = nRT. For n=1, PV=RT. So in terms of the variables, the equation can be expressed as PV = RT, or as V = RT/P, etc.

Looking at the options, which one matches any of these forms.

Option A: (PV)/(RT) =1 → PV=RT. Correct.

Option D: (VP)/T = R → same as PV=RT. So also correct.

Wait, but that would mean both A and D are correct. But in the options, each is a different option, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, option D is (V P)/T = R, which is VP = RT → rearranged as PV=RT. So D is the same as A.

Hmm, but the options are A to J, each unique. So perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the form of the equation as it's written. The ideal gas equation is often written as PV = nRT. For one mole, it's PV=RT. So perhaps the correct form is PV=RT, which is option A when you multiply both sides by RT and divide.

Wait option A is (PV)/(RT) =1 → which is the same as PV=RT. So A is correct.

Option D: (V P)/T = R → which is also correct.

So do both A and D represent the same equation? Let me check:

Equation A: PV = RT.

Equation D: VP = RT → which is PV=RT. So yes, same equation.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see the exact wording.

Option A is (PV) / (RT) = 1 → which is PV=RT.

Option D is (VP) / T = R → VP = RT → same as PV=RT.

So both A and D are correct? But that's impossible because each option is a separate choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option A: (PV)/(RT) =1 → correct.

Option D: (V P)/T = R → same as option A.

So why are they both present? Maybe I made a mistake. Or perhaps I'm missing something in the way the options are written.

Wait another thought: the question gives V = f(P, T). So perhaps they expect solving for V. Let's see.

If I solve the ideal gas law for V: V = RT/(P). So looking for which option gives V in terms of P, T, and R.

Option G is V = PT/R → which is incorrect because that would imply V increases with P, which isn't right. So G is wrong.

Option I is V=(R P)/T → that's V proportional to P, which is also wrong.

Option F is P = RT/V → which is the same as PV=RT. Correct, but the question is about expressing V in terms of P and T.

Hmm, but the question is to derive the ideal gas equation. So any form that correctly represents PV = RT is acceptable.

So the correct options would be A, D, F, and maybe others.

Wait, let's look at all the options.

Option F: P = RT/V → Multiply both sides by V: PV=RT. So F is correct.

So options A, D, F all are correct forms of the ideal gas equation when n=1.

Wait, that can't be, since each option is a separate choice.

But the question is to select the correct equation. So perhaps the ideal gas equation is traditionally written as PV = nRT, so when n=1, PV=RT. So the standard form is PV=RT, which can be written as (PV)/(RT)=1 (option A) or PV=RT.

Looking at the options, option G is V=PT/R → which would be V= (P T)/R. Wait, that's correct because V=(n R T)/P, and n=1, so V=(R T)/P → so V= (R T)/P. Option G is V= (P T)/R → which would be incorrect because it's P multiplied by T, divided by R. So that's wrong.

Wait, no, option G is V=PT/R → which is V=(P T)/R. That can't be, because from ideal gas law, V=RT/P. So option G is incorrect.

Option F is P=RT/V → that simplifies to PV=RT, which is correct.

So now I'm getting confused because multiple options seem correct. But the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the original question again. It says to derive the ideal gas equation when V is a function of P and T. So the equation is expressed in terms of V, P, and T.

Wait, perhaps the way it's written matters. The ideal gas equation for 1 mole is PV=RT. So any form that directly represents this is correct.

Looking again:

Option A: (PV)/(RT) =1 → correct.

Option D: (V P)/T = R → correct.

Option F: P= RT/V → correct.

So perhaps all three are correct? But that's not possible because each is a different option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me reevaluate.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. For 1 mole, n=1, so PV=RT.

Now, the question is to choose the correct equation from the options.

Looking at each option:

A: (PV)/(RT) =1 → yes, correct.

D: (VP)/T = R → VP = RT → PV=RT → correct.

F: P = RT/V → correct.

So all three are correct. But that can't be, as each option is separate.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the layout of the options. Let me read them again.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each with an equation.

So, looking for which equation represents the ideal gas equation for 1 mole.

So, perhaps more than one option is correct, but the question expects the most standard form.

The standard form is PV=RT, which is option A when rearranged.

Wait, no, option A is (PV)/(RT)=1, which is equivalent to PV=RT.

Option D is (VP)/T = R → which is VP=RT → same as PV=RT.

So both A and D are correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check.

Is option D (VP)/T = R? Let's see, the way it's written, with V and P adjacent, does that imply multiplication? Yes, because (V*P)/T = R.

So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the question gives 10 options, and the correct answer is among them. Since both A and D are correct, but the options don't have multiple correct, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is to derive the equation, which may involve combining Boyle's and Charles's laws. Boyle's law is PV = k (at constant T), and Charles's law is V/T = k (at constant P). Combining them would give PV/T = constant = R.

Wait, so combining the two gives PV = RT. So the equation can be written as PV = RT, which is option A when you rearrange (PV)/(RT) =1.

Alternatively, when you combine the two laws, you get PV/T = R → which is option D: (VP)/T = R.

Wait, because PV/T is same as VP/T.

So, option D is correct.

But then again, option A is also correct.

Hmm. Maybe the intended answer is option A because it's in the form (PV)/(RT) =1, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the units. R has units of (pressure × volume)/(temperature × moles). So for option D, (V P)/T would have units (volume × pressure)/temperature. Which matches R's units. So option D could make sense.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here because both A and D are correct expressions of the same equation.

Wait, maybe I should consider the other options. Let's go through all of them.

Option E: (PT)/V = R → PT = R V. That would imply P = (R V)/T. But from ideal gas, P = RT/V. So this is incorrect because V is in the numerator instead of denominator.

Option B: (V/T) = P/R → V = (P T)/R → which is incorrect because V should be RT/P.

Option C: (VT)/P = R → V = (R P)/T → again, incorrect because V should be RT/P.

Option G: V = PT/R → same as option B and C, incorrect.

Option H: (VP)/T =k → this is the same as D, but using k instead of R. So if k is a constant, but R is the specific gas constant, H is a more general form, but since the question is about the ideal gas equation, R is the correct constant. So H is incorrect.

Option I: V = (R P)/T → same issue as others, V proportional to P, which isn't right.

Option J: (P + V)/(T + R) = constant → doesn't make sense dimensionally or in terms of the gas laws.

So from all this, the correct options are A, D, and F. But since the question must have one correct answer, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is to derive the ideal gas equation, which is PV = RT for 1 mole.

Looking at the options, which one directly represents this.

Option A is (PV)/(RT) =1 → equivalent to PV=RT.

Option D is (VP)/T=R → equivalent to PV=RT.

Option F is P=RT/V → equivalent to PV=RT.

So all three are correct, but that can't be because each is a separate option. So perhaps the intended answer is A because it's often written as (PV)/(RT) =1 for the ideal gas law.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to remember the standard ideal gas equation is written as PV = nRT, so for n=1, it's PV=RT. So the equation that matches this is option A when rearranged. Alternatively, option D is (VP)/T = R → which is the same as PV=RT.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because when you combine Boyle's and Charles's laws, you get (P1 V1)/T1 = (P2 V2)/T2 = nR. So for one mole, (PV)/T = R → which is option D.

Wait, yes! That makes sense. Because when you derive the ideal gas law by combining Boyle's and Charles's laws, you get PV/T = nR. So for n=1, it's PV/T = R → which is option D.

So then option D is correct. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought option A is correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, the standard equation is written as PV = nRT, so when you divide both sides by RT, you get PV/(RT)=n. For n=1, it's PV/(RT)=1 → which is option A.

So now I'm torn between options A and D.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the form of the equation. If the question states that V is a function of P and T, perhaps solving for V gives V=RT/P. So looking for which option expresses V in terms of P and T.

Option D is (VP)/T = R → solving for V gives V = RT/P, which is correct.

So if the question is to express V as a function of P and T, then option D would be correct because it's written in terms that allow solving for V.

Alternatively, option A is a correct equation but doesn't directly express V as a function.

Wait, but the question says "derive the ideal gas equation." So it's not specifically solving for V, but rather writing the equation in terms of P, V, and T.

In that case, both A and D are correct because they both represent the same equation. So perhaps the intended answer is A because it's the more familiar form.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. I think I'll have to choose the option that matches the standard form of the ideal gas equation, which is PV = RT. So looking for that.

Option A is (PV)/(RT)=1 → which is equivalent to PV=RT.

Option D is (VP)/T=R → which is equivalent to PV=RT.

So both are correct. But since only one option is correct, perhaps the intended answer is option D because it's written as (VP)/T=R, which is the form derived from combining the gas laws.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. So I think the answer is D.

The ideal gas law is given by \( PV = nRT \). For 1 mole of gas (\( n = 1 \)), this simplifies to \( PV = RT \). The question asks to derive the ideal gas equation and select the correct form from the given options.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: \( \frac{PV}{RT} = 1 \)**  
   Rearranging this gives \( PV = RT \), which is the correct form of the ideal gas equation for 1 mole. This matches the derived equation.

2. **Option B: \( \frac{V}{T} = \frac{P}{R} \)**  
   Rearranging this gives \( V = \frac{PT}{R} \), which implies \( V \) is proportional to \( P \). This is incorrect because, from the ideal gas law, \( V \) is inversely proportional to \( P \).

3. **Option C: \( \frac{VT}{P} = R \)**  
   Rearranging this gives \( V = \frac{PR}{T} \), which implies \( V \) is proportional to \( P \). This is also incorrect because \( V \) should be inversely proportional to \( P \).

4. **Option D: \( \frac{VP}{T} = R \)**  
   Rearranging this gives \( VP = RT \), or \( PV = RT \), which is the correct form of the ideal gas equation for 1 mole. This matches the derived equation.

5. **Option E: \( \frac{PT}{V} = R \)**  
   Rearranging this gives \( PT = RV \), which implies \( P \) is proportional to \( V \). This is incorrect because \( P \) is inversely proportional to \( V \).

6. **Option F: \( P = \frac{RT}{V} \)**  
   Rearranging this gives \( PV = RT \), which is the correct form of the ideal gas equation for 1 mole. This matches the derived equation.

7. **Option G: \( V = \frac{PT}{R} \)**  
   This implies \( V \) is proportional to \( P \), which is incorrect because \( V \) is inversely proportional to \( P \).

8. **Option H: \( \frac{VP}{T} = k \)**  
   This is a more general form where \( k \) is a constant. However, the question specifies the ideal gas equation, where the constant is \( R \). Thus, this is incorrect.

9. **Option I: \( V = \frac{RP}{T} \)**  
   This implies \( V \) is proportional to \( P \), which is incorrect because \( V \) is inversely proportional to \( P \).

10. **Option J: \( \frac{P + V}{T + R} = \text{constant} \
