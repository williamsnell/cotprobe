Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the power needed for an air pump to lift a liquid. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

Alright, the question says that 12 gallons per minute of a liquid with a specific gravity of 1.3 is being lifted. The air is available at 55 psig, and the liquid needs to be raised 75 feet. The pump has an efficiency of 30%. I need to find the power required using isentropic air compression.

Wait, specific gravity is the ratio of the liquid's density to water's, right? So specific gravity of 1.3 means the liquid is denser than water. That makes sense because water has a specific gravity of 1. So the weight of the liquid would be 1.3 times the weight of water. 

First, I think I need to calculate the weight of the liquid being pumped. The flow rate is 12 gallons per minute. I remember that 1 gallon of water weighs about 8.34 pounds, so for this liquid, it would be 8.34 lb/gal * 1.3 = let's calculate that. 8.34 * 1.3 is approximately 10.842 pounds per gallon.

So per minute, the pump is moving 12 gallons. So the total weight per minute is 12 gal/min * 10.842 lb/gal. Let me do that math: 12 * 10.842 = 130.104 pounds per minute. But wait, power is usually in horsepower, and in such calculations, we often convert to pounds per second or something else. Oh right, because horsepower relates to power over time, so I should probably convert this to pounds lifted per second.

Wait, no, maybe per second isn't the way to go. Let me think about units. Power is work done over time. The work here is lifting the liquid against gravity. So the work per unit time is the rate of doing work, which is power.

The formula I'm thinking of is Power = (Weight lifted per minute * Height) / (33,000 * efficiency). Because I remember that 1 horsepower is about 33,000 foot-pounds per minute. So if I can find the work done per minute, I can divide by 33,000 to get horsepower, and then account for efficiency.

So the weight lifted per minute is 130.104 lb. The height is 75 feet. So the work done per minute is 130.104 lb * 75 ft. Let me calculate that: 130 * 75 is 9750, but more accurately, 130.104 *75 = let's see, 130 *75 =9750, and 0.104 *75=7.8, so total 9757.8 foot-pounds per minute.

Now, to find the power without considering efficiency, it would be 9757.8 / 33,000 ≈ 0.2956 horsepower. But wait, this is the power output. But pumps have efficiency, so the actual power required would be higher. Since the efficiency is 30% (or 0.3), the required power input is output divided by efficiency. So 0.2956 / 0.3 ≈ 0.985 horsepower. Hmm, that's close to 1.0. But let me double-check.

Wait, but I think I'm missing something about the air compression part. Oh, right, the problem says it's using isentropic air compression. So perhaps I need to approach this using the thermodynamics of air compression.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The air is supplied at 55 psig. So the pump uses compressed air to push the liquid up. So maybe the calculation involves determining the amount of air needed and the work done during compression.

Alternatively, perhaps the power is related to the energy required to compress the air. Let me think. The compressed air does work on the liquid, lifting it. But the pump efficiency would relate to how efficiently the compressed air's energy is used.

Wait, maybe I should model this as an air-lift pump problem. In an airlift pump, compressed air is injected into the liquid, which reduces the density of the liquid-air mixture, causing it to rise. The power required involves the energy to compress the air, considering the pressure and the flow rate.

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula for the power in an airlift pump. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the energy needed to compress the air to 55 psig, and then relate that to the work done in lifting the liquid.

Let's consider the energy required to compress the air. The specific work (work per unit mass) done in isentropic compression of air can be calculated using the formula:

W = P1 * V1 * [ (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ) - 1 ] / (η * (γ - 1) * P2 )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the work done per unit of air. Let me recall the formula for work done in compressing air isentropically. For an isentropic process, the work done (per unit mass) is:

W = (P1 * V1) / (η * (γ - 1)) * [ (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/γ ) - 1 ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the power required for the compressor. The power is related to the mass flow rate of the air and the specific work done on it.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should start by calculating the mass flow rate of the air and the energy required to compress it, then use the pump efficiency to find the needed power.

Wait, but the question is about the power needed to lift the liquid, considering the efficiency of the pump. So perhaps the initial approach I took was correct, but I need to factor in the air compression work.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a straightforward application of the power required to lift the liquid, using the given efficiency. Let me recap:

The liquid's flow rate is 12 gal/min. Specific gravity 1.3, so density is 1.3 times water. Water is 62.4 lb/ft³, so the liquid is 62.4 *1.3 = 81.12 lb/ft³.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the weight flow rate correctly. The volume flow rate is 12 gal/min. Since 1 gallon is 0.1337 ft³, the volume flow rate is 12 * 0.1337 ≈ 1.604 ft³/min.

So, mass flow rate (weight) is 1.604 ft³/min * 81.12 lb/ft³ ≈ 130.104 lb/min. Which matches what I calculated earlier.

So the weight lifted is 130.104 lb per minute, to 75 ft. So the work done per minute is 130.104 *75 = 9757.8 ft-lb/min.

Since 1 horsepower is 33,000 ft-lb/min, the power without efficiency is 9757.8 / 33,000 ≈ 0.2956 hp. But the pump is only 30% efficient, so the actual power needed is 0.2956 / 0.3 ≈ 0.985 hp. So approximately 1.0 hp. Looking at the options, J is 1.0 hp. But wait, I'm not considering the air compression here. So maybe I'm oversimplifying.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach doesn't account for the fact that the air is being compressed and doing work on the liquid. So perhaps the problem requires calculating the power based on the air compression work, not just the liquid lifting work.

Hmm. So perhaps I should compute the energy required to compress the air, and then relate that to the work done in lifting the liquid, considering the pump's efficiency.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach.

In an airlift pump, the power required is the power to compress the air. The amount of air needed depends on the pressure and the volume flow of the liquid.

Wait, but I'm not exactly familiar with the exact formula for this scenario. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the power required to lift a liquid using compressed air.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the pump as a device that uses compressed air to do work on the liquid, so the energy input is the energy of the compressed air, and the output is the work done lifting the liquid.

But I'm not exactly sure how to model that. Let me think about energy conservation. The work done by the compressed air on the liquid is W. But the pump's efficiency is 30%, so W = 0.3 * W_air, where W_air is the work done on the air (compressing it).

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused with the definitions. The pump's efficiency (η) is the ratio of useful work output to the energy input. So the useful work is lifting the liquid, and the input is the compressed air's energy. So:

η = Work_out / Work_in

So Work_in = Work_out / η

So if the work done in lifting the liquid is W_lift = 9757.8 ft-lb per minute, then the work input (to compress the air) is W_lift / η.

But then, how does the compressed air's pressure and the liquid's height relate to the work done?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of pressure and volume. The air is compressed to 55 psig, which is 55 psi above atmospheric pressure. Let's convert that to absolute pressure: 55 + 14.7 = 69.7 psia.

The work done in compressing the air is the energy provided to the pump. So the power required would be based on how much air is needed to lift the liquid.

Wait, but how much air is needed? The volume flow rate of the air would determine the mass flow, which relates to the power needed for compression.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. If the pump's efficiency is 30%, and the work done to lift the liquid is 9757.8 ft-lb/min, then the power input required is that work divided by efficiency and converted into horsepower.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to approximately 0.985 hp, which would round to 1.0 hp (option J). But the options include 0.8, 1.0, etc. So perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but I'm not considering the air's compression work. Maybe the approach is incorrect. So perhaps the initial method only accounts for the liquid's lift, but the actual power needed is higher because the air must be compressed.

Wait, another approach: the power required is the work done to compress the air plus the work done to lift the liquid. But I'm not sure about that, as the pump's efficiency combines both aspects.

Alternatively, perhaps the pump's efficiency is the ratio of the work done lifting the liquid to the work done compressing the air. So the efficiency η is:

η = (Work lifting liquid) / (Work compressing air)

So Work compressing air = Work lifting / η.

Then, the power required would be Work compressing air per unit time, converted to horsepower.

So, the work done lifting the liquid per minute is 9757.8 ft-lb. The work done compressing the air per minute would be 9757.8 / 0.3 ≈ 32526 ft-lb per minute.

Now, to find the power, convert this to horsepower. Since 1 hp = 33000 ft-lb/min, so 32526 / 33000 ≈ 0.985 hp. Again, about 1.0 hp.

Hmm, that still gives me the same answer as before. So perhaps the correct answer is 1.0 hp, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident because I might be missing some aspect of the air compression. Maybe I should think about the amount of air needed and its compression.

Let me try that. The pressure is 55 psig, so 55 psi gauge, which is 69.7 psia. Let's assume atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia. The specific gravity of air is 1, so the density is calculated based on that.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to find the volume flow rate of the air.

Wait, the power required would be the work done compressing the air, which depends on the mass flow rate and the pressure ratio.

But I'm not sure how to relate the liquid flow rate to the air flow rate. Maybe in an airlift pump, the air is bubbled into the liquid, reducing its density and causing it to rise. The amount of air needed would depend on the pressure and the height.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the liquid's lift work and the efficiency to compute the required power without delving into the air flow calculations. Since in my earlier approaches, I'm getting approximately 1.0 hp, which is option J.

But wait, looking at the answer options, option J is 1.0 hp, but some other options are close. Let me just go through the calculations again to make sure.

Calculating the liquid's weight per minute:

12 gal/min * 8.34 lb/gal (water) = 100.08 lb/min. But specific gravity is 1.3, so 100.08 *1.3=130.104 lb/min.

Work per minute: 130.104 lb *75 ft =9757.8 ft-lb/min.

Convert to horsepower: 9757.8 /33,000 ≈0.2956 hp. Then, considering efficiency of 30%, 0.2956 /0.3 ≈0.985 hp.

So approximately 1.0 hp, which is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is lower. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the specific weight of the liquid. Specific weight is weight per unit volume. So 62.4 lb/ft³ for water. So 62.4 *1.3 =81.12 lb/ft³. So the volume flow rate is 12 gal/min *0.1337 ft³/gal≈1.6044 ft³/min.

So mass flow rate is 1.6044 ft³/min *81.12 lb/ft³=130.104 lb/min. Same as before.

So the same calculation applies, leading to 0.985 hp. So option J.

To determine the power needed to lift 12 gal/min of a liquid with a specific gravity of 1.3 to a height of 75 ft using an air pump with an efficiency of 30%, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate the weight flow rate of the liquid**:  
   - Specific gravity of the liquid = 1.3 (relative to water).  
   - Density of water = 62.4 lb/ft³, so the liquid's density = \( 62.4 \times 1.3 = 81.12 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \).  
   - Volume flow rate = \( 12 \, \text{gal/min} \times 0.1337 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{gal} = 1.604 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{min} \).  
   - Weight flow rate = \( 1.604 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{min} \times 81.12 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 = 130.104 \, \text{lb/min} \).

2. **Calculate the work done per minute to lift the liquid**:  
   - Work = Force × Distance = \( 130.104 \, \text{lb} \times 75 \, \text{ft} = 9757.8 \, \text{ft-lb/min} \).

3. **Convert work to horsepower (hp)**:  
   - 1 hp = 33,000 ft-lb/min.  
   - Power without efficiency = \( \frac{9757.8}{33,000} \approx 0.2956 \, \text{hp} \).

4. **Account for pump efficiency**:  
   - Efficiency = 30% = 0.3.  
   - Actual power required = \( \frac{0.2956}{0.3} \approx 0.985 \, \text{hp} \).

5. **Final result**:  
   - The calculated power is approximately \( 1.0 \, \text{hp} \), which corresponds to option J.

Thus, the power needed is **1.0 hp**.
