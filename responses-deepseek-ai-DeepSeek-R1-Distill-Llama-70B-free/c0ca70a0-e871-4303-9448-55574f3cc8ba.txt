Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about molecular shapes, and I'm a bit rusty on my VSEPR theory, but let me try to work through it.

The question is asking which molecule has a tetrahedral shape. The options are A through I, each being a different molecule. I remember that molecular geometry is determined by the number of electron domains around the central atom, which includes both bonding pairs and lone pairs. The basic shapes are linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, and octahedral.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: SO2. I think SO2 has a central sulfur atom with double bonds to two oxygen atoms. Sulfur has six valence electrons. Each O is bonded with a double bond, so that's two regions. But wait, sulfur in SO2 also has a lone pair. So the domains around S are three: two bonding and one lone pair. That would make a trigonal planar arrangement, but the shape would be bent or V-shaped, like ozone. So SO2 is bent, not tetrahedral.

Option B: BeCl2. Be has two electrons, each Cl brings seven, but BeCl2 is a linear molecule. Beryllium has a charge of +2 usually, so in BeCl2, each Cl is bonded with a single bond. Be has two bonding domains and no lone pairs, so it's linear. So not tetrahedral.

Option C: SF6. Sulfur hexafluoride. Sulfur has six bonding pairs here. Each F is bonded with a single bond. So six domains around S. That makes an octahedral geometry. So SF6 is octahedral, not tetrahedral.

Option D: CBr4. Carbon tetrabromide. Carbon has four bonds, each to a Br. So four bonding domains and no lone pairs. That's a tetrahedral shape. I'm pretty sure this is one of the correct answers, but let me check the others just in case.

Option E: PCl4F. Hmm. Phosphorus here. Let's see, phosphorus in group VA, so five valence electrons. Each Cl and F brings seven. So PCl4F has four Cls and one F? Wait, no: PCl4F would have four Cl and one F attached. So that's five bonding pairs. Wait, phosphorus can have expanded octets because it's in period 3. So five regions. So the geometry would be trigonal bipyramidal. Wait, but wait: the molecule is PCl4F. So four Cl and one F. So five bonds. So the electron domains are five. So the shape would be trigonal bipyramidal, but depending on lone pairs. Wait, how many lone pairs does P have here? Let's calculate the formal charges. Phosphorus has 5 valence electrons. Each bond contributes one electron from P. So five bonds: so 5×2 =10 electrons used. P's valence is 5, so formal charge is 5 - (5 + 0) = 0. Wait, wait, each bond is single, so each uses one electron from P. So P is making five single bonds, so using five electrons, but P has five valence electrons. So no lone pairs. So five domains, no lone pairs. So trigonal bipyramidal. So the shape is trigonal bipyramidal. So E is not tetrahedral.

Option F: NH3. Ammonia. Nitrogen has five valence electrons. In NH3, it forms three bonds, each with a hydrogen. So three bonding domains and one lone pair (since 5 - 3×2 = -1, but wait: NH3 has a lone pair. Let me think: each N-H bond is single, so three bonds, so 6 electrons used (3×2). Nitrogen has five valence electrons, so five minus three (since each bond is one pair from N) → wait, no, each bond is two electrons, but each bond is contributed one by N and one by H. So N contributes three electrons for bonding, so five minus three equals two electrons, which is one lone pair. So four regions: three bonds and one lone pair. So the electron domain geometry is tetrahedral, but the molecular shape is trigonal pyramidal. So NH3 is trigonal pyramidal, not tetrahedral.

Option G: BF3. Boron trifluoride. Boron has three valence electrons. Each F brings seven. So three single bonds, no lone pairs on B. So three bonding domains. So the geometry is trigonal planar. So BF3 is trigonal planar, not tetrahedral.

Option H: CO2. Carbon dioxide. Each O is double bonded to C. So two domains, both double bonds. So the shape is linear.

Option I: H2O. Water. Oxygen has six valence electrons. Two bonds, each to H. So two bonding domains and two lone pairs (since 6 - 2×2 = 2). So four regions: two bonds and two lone pairs. So the electron domain is tetrahedral, but the molecular shape is bent or V-shaped. So H2O is bent, not tetrahedral.

So looking back at the options, the one that's definitely tetrahedral is D: CBr4.

Wait, but what about option E: PCl4F? Wait, no, that's trigonal bipyramidal. And option F, NH3, is trigonal pyramidal. So the only tetrahedral is D, CBr4. But wait, another thought: option E is PCl4F. So is that five regions? So the shape would be trigonal bipyramidal with five regions, no lone pairs. So no, that's not tetrahedral.

So the correct answer is D: CBr4. So I think the answer is D.

To determine which molecule has a tetrahedral shape, we analyze the molecular geometry of each option using VSEPR theory. Molecular geometry is determined by the number of electron domains (bonding pairs and lone pairs) around the central atom.

- **A: SO₂**  
  Sulfur has three electron domains (two bonding pairs and one lone pair), resulting in a trigonal planar electron domain geometry. However, the molecular shape is bent or V-shaped, not tetrahedral.

- **B: BeCl₂**  
  Beryllium has two bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in a linear geometry.

- **C: SF₆**  
  Sulfur has six bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in an octahedral geometry.

- **D: CBr₄**  
  Carbon has four bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry. This is a tetrahedral molecule.

- **E: PCl₄F**  
  Phosphorus has five bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry.

- **F: NH₃**  
  Nitrogen has three bonding pairs and one lone pair, resulting in a trigonal pyramidal molecular shape. The electron domain geometry is tetrahedral, but the molecular shape is not tetrahedral.

- **G: BF₃**  
  Boron has three bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in a trigonal planar geometry.

- **H: CO₂**  
  Carbon has two double bonds and no lone pairs, resulting in a linear geometry.

- **I: H₂O**  
  Oxygen has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, resulting in a bent or V-shaped molecular geometry. The electron domain geometry is tetrahedral, but the molecular shape is not tetrahedral.

The only molecule with a tetrahedral shape is **CBr₄**.
