Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about Polaris when traveling north from the US into Canada. Hmm, I remember that Polaris is the North Star, right? It's used for navigation because it's positioned almost exactly in line with Earth's axis of rotation. That means it appears stationary in the sky, while the other stars rotate around it.

Wait, the question is about what happens when you go north. I think that as you move towards the North Pole, Polaris should get higher in the sky. Because when you're at the equator, Polaris is just on the horizon. But as you go north, it rises higher. Oh, right, the altitude of Polaris in the sky corresponds to your latitude. So if you're in the US, say around 40 degrees north latitude, Polaris is about 40 degrees above the horizon. When you go into Canada, which is further north, say 50 degrees, Polaris would be at 50 degrees. So it should appear higher.

Wait, but what if you're already in northern parts of the US? Like if someone is in Maine, which is pretty far north, maybe moving into Canada wouldn't make a huge difference. But the general trend is that going north increases Polaris's altitude.

Looking at the options, option A is 'Higher in the sky', which seems correct. Option H is 'Lower', which would be the opposite. So I think the answer is A.

Wait, but could there be any other factors? Like atmospheric conditions or the time of year? No, the question is about the position, not visibility due to other factors. So yeah, moving north makes Polaris higher. Therefore, the correct answer should be A.

When traveling north from the United States into Canada, Polaris (the North Star) appears higher in the sky because its altitude increases with latitude. As you move closer to the North Pole, Polaris rises higher above the horizon. This is due to Earth's axial tilt, which positions Polaris nearly in line with the Earth's rotational axis. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Higher in the sky

Answer: A
