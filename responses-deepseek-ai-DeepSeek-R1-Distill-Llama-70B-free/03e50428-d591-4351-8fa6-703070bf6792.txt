Options:

A: Range
B: Variance

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about a listener-sponsored radio station that wants to estimate the typical contribution from supporters during a fund drive. They took a sample of 30 supporters. Breaking it down, 22 gave $60, 6 gave $1,000, and 2 gave $10,000. The question is asking which measure of central tendency would be most useful for them.

Hmm. The options are from A to J, which include various statistical measures like mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation, etc.

So, the key here is understanding what each measure tells us and which one is most appropriate for this scenario.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means.

The mean is the average, right? You sum all the values and divide by the number of values. The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. The mode is the most frequent value. Range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. Variance and standard deviation measure the spread of the data. Frequency distribution shows how often each value occurs. Histogram is a graphical representation of frequency distribution. Quartiles divide the data into four parts. ANOVA is used to compare means across groups.

The question is about estimating the "typical" contribution. So they're looking for a central tendency measure that best represents what a typical supporter contributes.

Looking at the data: 22 people gave $60, which is a lot more than the others. 6 gave $1,000, and 2 gave $10,000. So the data is probably skewed because there are some very high values (like $10,000) compared to the majority.

Wait, let me think about the distribution. Since most of the data points are at $60, the mode is $60, which appears most frequently. The mean, however, might be higher because those two $10,000 contributions could pull the average up a lot. Let's do a quick calculation to see.

Calculating the mean: (22*60 + 6*1000 + 2*10000) /30.

22*60 is 1320. 6*1000 is 6000. 2*10,000 is 20,000. So total is 1320+6000=7320 +20,000=27,320. Divide by 30: 27,320 /30 is approximately 910.67.

So the mean is around $910, but the median would be different. Let me think about the median. Since there are 30 data points, the median would be the average of the 15th and 16th values when sorted.

If we sort the data, the first 22 are 60, then next 6 are 1000, then 2 are 10,000.

So the 15th and 16th are both 60. So median is 60.

So mean is about $910, median is $60, and mode is $60.

Now, which of these would be more useful for the radio station? They want to estimate the typical contribution. The mean is influenced by the high values, making it higher than what most people contribute. The median represents the middle value, which in this case is $60, which is the same as the mode.

So if the station is looking to understand what a typical supporter gives, the median or mode might be more appropriate than the mean because the mean is skewed by the large donations from a few people.

Wait, the options are the measures of central tendency. So the mean is there (option J), median (D), mode (H), etc.

So which one is more useful? The radio station probably wants to know what amount they can expect from a typical supporter. If most supporters give $60, then the median and mode both point to that. But the mean suggests a higher average, which might not reflect the typical supporter's contribution.

Therefore, the median would be a better measure here because it's less affected by the outliers (the two $10,000 donations). It better represents the middle of the data, which in this case is $60, same as the mode.

Wait, but the mode is also $60 because it's the most frequent. So in this case, both median and mode are $60. But the question is which measure would be most useful. The median gives the middle point, which in this case aligns with the mode, but perhaps the median is a more robust measure of central tendency when there are outliers.

Alternatively, the mean is not a good representation because it's skewed upwards, making it look like the average is higher than what most people contribute.

So the radio station would be better off using the median because it's more representative of the typical contribution, not skewed by the high outliers.

Wait, but let me consider the options again. The options given include median (D) and mode (H). So which one is more appropriate?

In this case, the mode is $60 because it's the most common. The median is also $60. So both are the same. But the question is about the most useful measure.

Wait, but the mode only tells you the most frequent value, which might not necessarily represent the central tendency as the median does. But in this case, both point to the same value.

However, in cases where the data is skewed, the median is generally a better measure of central tendency than the mean. So perhaps the median is the better choice here.

Alternatively, the radio station might be more interested in the mean because it's the total divided by the number of supporters, but that's not the case here because the mean is higher due to the high values.

Wait, the question is about the "typical" supporter. So the median better represents the typical value because it's the middle point. The mean can be misleading due to skewing.

So the correct answer here would be the median, which is option D.

The question involves a listener-sponsored radio station aiming to estimate the "typical" contribution from supporters during a fund drive. A sample of 30 supporters shows that 22 contributed $60, 6 contributed $1,000, and 2 contributed $10,000. The goal is to determine which measure of central tendency would be most useful for this purpose.

To analyze this, it is important to understand the characteristics of each measure of central tendency:

- **Mean**: The average value, calculated by summing all contributions and dividing by the number of supporters. However, it is heavily influenced by outliers, such as the two $10,000 contributions, which skew the mean higher than the typical contribution.
- **Median**: The middle value when the data is ordered. With 30 data points, the median is the average of the 15th and 16th values. In this case, both are $60, making the median $60.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value, which is $60 in this dataset.

Given the data, the mean is calculated to be approximately $910, which is misleading due to the influence of the high outliers. The median, on the other hand, is $60, which aligns with the mode and better represents the typical contribution. The median is less affected by outliers and provides a more accurate reflection of the central tendency in this skewed distribution.

While both the median and mode are $60, the median is generally a more robust measure of central tendency, especially in the presence of outliers. Therefore, the median is the most useful measure for the radio station to estimate the typical contribution.
