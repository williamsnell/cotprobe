Question:

In Osman v UK (1998), the European Court laid down a test, which can be used to apply a general positive obligation on a state. Which of the following statements is not part of the Osman test?

Options:

A: The risk must be immediate and unavoidable
B: If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm)
C: The state should take unreasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring
D: The risk must have been previously reported to the state
E: A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring
F: The state has a duty to inform the individual of the risk
G: The state has a responsibility to eliminate all risk
H: The state must provide financial compensation for any potential harm
I: The risk must emanate from a state agent
J: A state knows or ought to have known

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which statement is not part of the Osman test. I remember that the Osman case was about the European Court of Human Rights dealing with a positive obligation on states to protect life under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The test they laid down sets certain criteria when a state can be held responsible for failing to protect someone from a risk.

So the question is asking which of the options (A to J) is not part of that test. Let me try to recall what the Osman test entails.

From what I remember, the test has a few key points. First, the risk must be real and imminent. That means it's not just a hypothetical threat but something that's actually going to happen soon. So any option talking about real and imminent risk would be part of the test.

Another point is that the state must know or ought to have known about the risk. So if the state had no knowledge and couldn't have reasonably known, they might not be liable. So an option mentioning that the state knows or ought to have known is part of the test.

Also, the state is expected to take reasonable steps to prevent the harm. It's not about taking every possible step, just what's reasonable. So options talking about reasonable steps would be included.

I think the test also says that the risk must be identifiable. That is, the authorities should have been aware of it, perhaps because it was reported to them. So an option stating that the risk must have been previously reported might be part of it, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe it's more about the state's knowledge rather than the source of the report. So perhaps the state having knowledge, even if the risk wasn't explicitly reported, is sufficient.

Looking at the options:

A: The risk must be immediate and unavoidable. That sounds like the real and imminent part, so it's part of the test.

B: If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm). Yeah, that's definitely part of the test.

C: The state should take unreasonable steps. Wait, no, the test says reasonable steps. So if an option says the state should take unreasonable steps, that's incorrect. Because taking unreasonable steps would be beyond what's required. So C is probably not part of the test.

D: Risk must have been previously reported. I'm not too sure. I think the test is more about the state's knowledge, which could come from any source, not necessarily a formal report. So maybe D isn't a required part, but I'm not certain.

E: A state should take reasonable steps. That's definitely part of the test.

F: The state has a duty to inform the individual. I don't recall that being part of the Osman test. The test is about taking steps to prevent harm, not necessarily informing the person. So F might not be part of it.

G: The state must eliminate all risk. That doesn't sound right. The state only needs to take reasonable steps, not eliminate all risks, which is impossible. So G is not part of the test.

H: Provide financial compensation. I don't think the test requires compensation; it's more about prevention. So H is not part of it.

I: The risk must come from a state agent. No, the risk can come from any source, like a third party. Osman's case involved a teacher, not a state agent. So I is not correct and thus not part of the test.

J: State knows or ought to have known. Definitely part of the test.

So looking back at the question, which asks which is NOT part of the test. The options I think are incorrect (those not part of the test) are C, D, F, G, H, I.

Wait, the question is which is NOT part of the test. So the correct answer would be the option that's not included in the Osman test.

Let me re-express the Osman test. The test requires that:

1. The risk must be real and imminent (so B and A are part of it; A says immediate and unavoidable, which is similar to real and imminent).

2. The state knew or ought to have known of the risk (so J is part of it).

3. The state failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the risk (so E is part, and C is the opposite, so C is not part).

4. The risk doesn't necessarily have to come from state agents (so I is not part, making I incorrect as part of the test).

Wait, so which options are not part of the test. The question is which statement is not part of the Osman test.

Looking again:

Option C says the state should take unreasonable steps. Osman test requires reasonable steps, so C is incorrect.

Option G says eliminate all risk, which is impossible; the test requires taking reasonable steps, not eliminating all, so G is not part.

Option I says the risk must emanate from a state agent. But in Osman, the risk was from a third party (a teacher), so I is not a requirement, hence I is not part of the test.

So the question is to find which option is NOT part of the test. The possible answers are C, G, I, etc.

Wait, but let me think about each option.

The question lists 10 options; I need to pick the one not part of the test.

Looking back, the Osman test is: 

- There must be a real and immediate risk to life (so B and A are part).

- The authorities must have known or ought to have known of the risk (J is part).

- The authorities must have failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the risk (so E is part, and C is opposite, so C is not part).

- The risk can come from any source, not necessarily state agents (so I is not required; hence I is not part of the test).

Wait, but I thought the test doesn't require the risk to come from state agents. So option I is not part of the test.

But looking at the options, the question is what is NOT part of the test.

So the incorrect statements are the ones that the test does not include.

Which of these options is not part of the test.

Option C: The state should take unreasonable steps. No, the test requires reasonable steps, so C is not part.

Option G: Eliminate all risk. No, test requires reasonable steps, so G is incorrect.

Option I: Risk from state agent. No, test allows risk from any source, so I is not part.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check each option.

The correct test includes:

1. Real and imminent risk (so A and B are correct parts).

2. State knew or ought to have known (J is correct).

3. State failed to take reasonable steps (E is correct; C is wrong).

4. The risk must have been something the state was aware of, perhaps through reports, but not necessarily. So D might be part of it, but I'm not sure. Wait, in Osman, the risk was known to the authorities through police reports, so D is part of the test. So D is correct.

F: State's duty to inform. I don't think that's part of the test. The test is about taking measures, not informing.

H: Provide financial compensation. No, that's not part of the test; the test is about preventive measures, not compensation.

So which options are not part of the test.

The question is which is not part of the test, so the incorrect options.

Looking at the options again:

The question lists:

A: Immediate and unavoidable → part of test.

B: real and imminent → part.

C: take unreasonable → not part (since it's 'reasonable').

D: must have been reported → maybe part because in Osman, the police had reports, but I'm not sure if it's a required element. The test might not require that the risk was reported, only that the state knew or should have known, regardless of the source.

E: take reasonable → part.

F: inform individual → not part.

G: eliminate all → no.

H: financial compensation → no.

I: from state agent → no.

J: knew or ought → yes.

So the options that are not part of the test are C, F, G, H, I, and possibly D.

The question is which option is not part of the test.

Looking back at the original question, the options are:

The options are:

A: Immediate and unavoidable.

B: Real and imminent.

C: Take unreasonable steps.

D: Risk must have been reported.

E: Take reasonable steps.

F: Duty to inform.

G: Eliminate all risk.

H: Financial compensation.

I: Risk from state agent.

J: Knew or ought.

So the test includes:

- Real and imminent (B).

- Knew or ought (J).

- Take reasonable steps (E).

The other points are:

A is similar to B, but perhaps A is part, as it's about imminence.

D says risk must have been reported. In Osman, the police had been informed, but I don't think the test requires the risk to have been reported. It's more about the state's knowledge, regardless of the source. So D is not a necessary part, but perhaps it's part of the test as a factor.

Wait, in the Osman case, the court said that the authorities had a duty to take measures only if they knew or ought to have known of the risk. So if the risk wasn't reported to them, but they should have known through other means, it's still their responsibility. So D (must have been reported) is not a required element. Therefore, D is not part of the test.

So which of the options is not part of the test?

The question is asking which is not part.

So the possible answers:

C: Take unreasonable steps → not part (test requires reasonable).

D: Risk must have been reported → not part (test doesn't require this).

F: Duty to inform → not part.

G: Eliminate all → not part.

H: Financial compensation → not part.

I: From state agent → not part.

So the options that are not part are C, D, F, G, H, I.

But the question provides 10 options, and we need to pick the one that is not part.

Wait, the question is which statement is NOT part of the test.

The correct answer is the option that is false regarding the test.

Let me go back to the Osman test.

The test as per Osman v UK (1998) is:

For a positive obligation under Article 2, three elements must be satisfied:

1. The risk to the individual’s life must be real and imminent.

2. The authorities must have known or ought to have known of that risk.

3. Having regard to the particular circumstances, the authorities failed to take reasonable steps which they could have taken to prevent that risk from materializing.

Additionally, the risk doesn’t have to emanate from a state agent; it can come from a third party.

So the test includes:

- Real and imminent risk (B, A).

- State knew or ought to have known (J).

- Failed to take reasonable steps (E).

So looking at the options, which are NOT part of the test.

Option C: The state should take unreasonable steps → No, because the test requires reasonable steps. So C is not part.

Option D: The risk must have been previously reported → No, the test doesn't require the risk to have been reported, only that the state knew or should have known.

Option F: State has a duty to inform → No, the test is about taking steps, not informing.

Option G: Eliminate all risk → No, it's about taking reasonable steps.

Option H: Provide financial compensation → No, it's about prevention, not compensation.

Option I: Risk from state agent → No, it can be from any source.

So the question is which of the options is NOT part of the test. The question asks which is not part, so the correct answer would be the statement that is not part of the test.

Looking at the options, the incorrect statements are C, D, F, G, H, I.

Wait, but the correct answer is one of them, and the options are A to J.

The question is which is NOT part of the test.

So, for example, option C is incorrect because the test requires reasonable steps, not unreasonable.

Option G is incorrect because you can't eliminate all risk.

Option I is incorrect because the risk doesn't have to come from state agents.

But the question is about which is NOT part of the test, so any of these could be the answer, but let's see which one is in the options.

The question lists option C as: The state should take unreasonable steps. Since the test requires reasonable steps, C is not part of the test, making it the correct answer to this question.

Wait, but let me double-check. The test requires the state to take reasonable steps. So if an option says 'unreasonable', that's not part of the test.

So the statement that is not part of the Osman test is option C.
</think>

The Osman test, established in Osman v UK (1998), sets out criteria for determining when a state has a positive obligation to protect life under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The test includes the following key elements:

1. **Real and Imminent Risk**: The risk to life must be real and immediate (e.g., options A and B are part of the test).
2. **State Knowledge**: The state must know or ought to have known about the risk (option J is part of the test).
3. **Reasonable Steps**: The state must take reasonable steps to prevent the risk from materializing (option E is part of the test).

The following options are **not part of the test**:
- **Option C**: The test requires the state to take **reasonable steps**, not **unreasonable steps**. This is directly contrary to the test's requirements.
- **Option D**: The risk does not need to have been previously reported to the state; the test only requires that the state knew or ought to have known about the risk.
- **Option F**: There is no duty to inform the individual of the risk; the focus is on taking preventive measures.
- **Option G**: The state is not required to eliminate all risk, only to take reasonable steps to prevent harm.
- **Option H**: Financial compensation is not part of the test, which focuses on prevention rather than compensation.
- **Option I**: The risk does not need to emanate from a state agent; it can come from any source, including third parties.

Among these, **Option C** stands out as the correct answer because it explicitly contradicts the test's requirement of taking **reasonable steps** by stating that the state should take **unreasonable steps**. This is not part of the Osman test.

Answer: C
