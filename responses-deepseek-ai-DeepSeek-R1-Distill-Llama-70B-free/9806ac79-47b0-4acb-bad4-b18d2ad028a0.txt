Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the mass of the Martian atmosphere. Hmm, I remember that the mass of the atmosphere can be found using some basic principles. Let me think about what I know.

The problem gives me the atmospheric pressure on Mars, which is 600 pascals. Oh right, pressure is force per unit area. So maybe I can use that. Also, they give the acceleration due to gravity on Mars as roughly 4 m/s². And the surface area is about 145,000,000 square kilometers. Wait, I should convert that to square meters because the other units are in meters and seconds.

So first, I'll convert the surface area. One square kilometer is (1000 meters)^2, which is 1,000,000 square meters. So 145 million square kilometers is 145,000,000 * 1,000,000 = 1.45e14 m². Wait, let me double-check that. 145e6 km² * (1e3 m)^2/km² = 145e6 * 1e6 m² = 145e12 m². Oh yeah, 1.45e14 m².

Next, I remember that atmospheric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere divided by the area. So pressure P equals mass m times gravity g, divided by area A. The formula rearranged for mass would be m = (P * A) / g.

Plugging in the numbers: P is 600 Pa, A is 1.45e14 m², g is 4 m/s². So m = (600 * 1.45e14) / 4.

Let me compute that step by step. 600 times 1.45e14 is... 600 is 6e2, so 6e2 * 1.45e14 = 6 * 1.45 = 8.7, so 8.7e16. Then divide by 4: 8.7e16 /4 is 2.175e16 kg.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.2e16 kg. That seems right. Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate:

600 * 1.45e14 = 600 * 1.45 = 870, so 870e14 (which is 8.7e16). Divided by 4 gives 2.175e16, which rounds to 2.2e16. Yep, so option C.

Wait a minute, another thought: pressure is force per area, and force is mass times gravity. So the equation is P = (m * g)/A, so m = (P * A)/g. Yeah, that's what I did. So the calculation should be correct.

I think that's the right approach. So the answer should be option C.

To calculate the mass of the Martian atmosphere, we start with the given values:

- **Pressure (P):** 600 Pa  
- **Acceleration due to gravity (g):** 4 m/s²  
- **Surface area (A):** 145,000,000 km² = \(1.45 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2\) (after converting square kilometers to square meters).

The relationship between pressure, mass, and gravity is given by the formula:  
\[
P = \frac{m \cdot g}{A}
\]  
Rearranging for mass:  
\[
m = \frac{P \cdot A}{g}
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
m = \frac{600 \cdot 1.45 \times 10^{14}}{4}
\]  
First, calculate \(600 \cdot 1.45 \times 10^{14}\):  
\[
600 \cdot 1.45 = 870 \quad \text{so} \quad 870 \times 10^{14} = 8.7 \times 10^{16}
\]  
Now divide by 4:  
\[
\frac{8.7 \times 10^{16}}{4} = 2.175 \times 10^{16} \, \text{kg}
\]  
Rounding to one decimal place gives:  
\[
m \approx 2.2 \times 10^{16} \, \text{kg}
\]

From the given options, the closest match is **C: \(2.2 \times 10^{16} \, \text{kg}\)**.

Answer: C
