Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question involves these functions F_n(x) defined recursively. Let's see what the setup is.

So, F_0(x) is log(x). Then, for each n ≥ 0 and x > 0, F_{n+1}(x) is the integral from 0 to x of F_n(t) dt. And the problem is to find the limit as n approaches infinity of (n! F_n(1)) divided by log(n). The options are A to J, with various constants and possibilities.

Hmm. I remember that integrating functions repeatedly tends to relate to Taylor series or something about smoothness. Also, factorials in the denominator or numerator often point towards some sort of series expansion or maybe using Stirling's approximation. But I'm not sure yet.

Let me start by computing the first few F_n(1) to see if I can spot a pattern. Maybe that'll help.

F_0(x) = log(x). So F_0(1) is log(1) which is 0. But since integrating from 0 might require some care. Wait, log(x) has a singularity at 0, but the integral from 0 might still converge for certain functions.

Wait, let's compute F_1(x): it's the integral from 0 to x of F_0(t) dt, which is ∫₀^x log(t) dt.

I remember that the integral of log(t) dt is t log(t) - t, evaluated from 0 to x. But as t approaches 0, t log(t) approaches 0 because log(t) approaches -infinity, but t approaches 0. The limit is 0. So F_1(x) = x log(x) - x. So F_1(1) is 1*log(1) -1 = 0 -1 = -1.

Hmm, okay. Now F_2(x) is the integral from 0 to x of F_1(t) dt. Let's compute that.

F_1(t) = t log(t) - t. So the integral is ∫ (t log(t) - t) dt from 0 to x.

Let's split this into two integrals: ∫ t log(t) dt minus ∫ t dt.

The integral of t log(t) dt: Use integration by parts. Let u = log(t), dv = t dt. Then du = (1/t) dt, v = t² / 2.

So ∫ t log(t) dt = (t²/2) log(t) - ∫ (t²/2)(1/t) dt = (t²/2) log(t) - (1/2) ∫ t dt = (t²/2) log(t) - (1/2)(t²/2) ) + C.

So that's (t²/2) log(t) - t²/4.

Then subtract ∫ t dt, which is t²/2.

So putting it all together: F_2(x) = [ (x²/2 log x - x²/4 ) ] - (x²/2) evaluated from 0 to x.

Wait, let me double-check. The integral of F_1(t) is ∫ (t log t - t) dt = [ (t²/2 log t - t²/4 ) ] - [t²/2 ] + C.

So F_2(x) = [ (x²/2 log x - x²/4 ) - x²/2 ] - [ same terms at 0 ].

At t=0, each term: t² log t is 0 (as t approaches 0, t² approaches 0, log t approaches -infty, but the product approaches 0). Similarly, t²/4 and t²/2 are zero at 0. So F_2(x) = (x²/2 log x - x²/4) - x²/2 = x²/2 log x - 3x²/4.

So F_2(1) is (1/2 log 1) - 3/4. Log 1 is 0, so F_2(1) = -3/4.

Hmm. Now let's compute F_3(1). F_3(x) is the integral from 0 to x of F_2(t) dt. F_2(t) is t²/2 log t - 3 t²/4.

So the integral becomes ∫ (t²/2 log t - 3 t²/4 ) dt from 0 to x.

Let's split the integral: (1/2) ∫ t² log t dt - (3/4) ∫ t² dt.

Compute each part.

First, (1/2) ∫ t² log t dt. Again, integration by parts. Let u = log t, dv = t² dt. Then du = (1/t) dt, v = t^3 /3.

So ∫ t^2 log t dt = (t^3/3) log t - ∫ (t^3/3)(1/t) dt = (t^3/3) log t - (1/3) ∫ t^2 dt = (t^3/3) log t - (1/3)(t^3/3) ) + C.

So (1/2) times [ (t^3/3) log t - t^3/(9) ) ].

Then subtract (3/4) ∫ t^2 dt, which is (3/4)(t^3/3) ) = (t^3/4).

Putting it all together: F_3(x) = (1/2)[ (x^3/3 log x - x^3/9) ] - (x^3/4 ) evaluated from 0 to x.

Again, at t=0, each term goes to 0, so F_3(x) = (x^3/(6)) log x - x^3/(18) - x^3/4.

Combine like terms: Let's see, x^3/(6) log x - [ 1/18 + 1/4 ] x^3.

Compute 1/18 + 1/4: 1/18 is 2/36, 1/4 is 9/36. So 11/36. So F_3(x) = (x^3/6) log x - (11 x^3)/36.

So F_3(1) is (1/6)*0 - 11/36 = -11/36.

Wait, let me see: each F_n(1) is getting smaller in absolute value. F_1(1) is -1, F_2(1) is -3/4, F_3(1) is -11/36. Hmm. Not sure the pattern yet.

But the question is about the limit as n approaches infinity of (n! F_n(1)) / log n.

So perhaps each F_n(1) can be expressed as (-1)^n times some coefficient divided by n! ?

Wait, looking at the values:

F_0(1)=0 (but let's ignore that for a moment).

F_1(1)= -1 = (-1)^1 * 1! / 1! ?

Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

F_1(1) = -1 = (-1)^1 * 1 / 1!.

F_2(1) = -3/4 = (-1)^2 * (3/4) / 2! ?

Wait, 3/4 divided by 2! is 3/(4*2)= 3/8. Hmm, not matching. Or maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps each F_n(1) is (-1)^n * (something) / n!.

Wait, if that's the case, then n! F_n(1) would be (-1)^n times that something, and when we take the limit, we can analyze whether that something over log n converges.

Wait, let me think about the general form. Each time we integrate, it's like adding another layer of division by a factorial term, perhaps.

Wait, I'm trying to recall if repeatedly integrating log(x) leads to expressions involving inverse factorials. Let me think about the general case.

In general, each time we integrate F_n(t), we get F_{n+1}(x) = ∫₀^x F_n(t) dt.

So perhaps F_n(x) is related to (log x)^{something} divided by some factorial term.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recursive relation. Let's denote a_n = F_n(1).

So a_0 = F_0(1) = log(1) = 0.

a_1 = F_1(1) = -1.

a_2 = F_2(1) = -3/4.

a_3 = F_3(1) = -11/36.

Wait, let's compute another term to see the pattern.

Compute F_4(1).

F_4(x) is the integral from 0 to x of F_3(t) dt. F_3(t) is (t^3/6) log t - 11 t^3 / 36.

So F_4(x) = ∫₀^x [ (t^3/6) log t - 11 t^3 /36 ] dt.

Split into two integrals: (1/6) ∫ t^3 log t dt - (11/36) ∫ t^3 dt.

Compute ∫ t^3 log t dt. Integration by parts: u = log t, dv = t^3 dt. du = (1/t) dt, v = t^4/4.

So ∫ t^3 log t dt = (t^4/4) log t - ∫ (t^4/4)(1/t) dt = (t^4/4 log t) - (1/4) ∫ t^3 dt = (t^4/4 log t) - (1/4)(t^4/4) ) + C.

So (1/6) times [ (t^4/4 log t) - t^4/(16) ) ].

Then subtract (11/36) times ∫ t^3 dt, which is (11/36)(t^4/4) ) = 11 t^4 / 144.

So F_4(x) = (1/6)[ (x^4/4 log x - x^4/16 ) ] - 11 x^4 / 144.

Simplify each term:

(1/6)(x^4/4 log x) = x^4/24 log x.

(1/6)(-x^4/16 )= -x^4/(96).

So F_4(x) = x^4/24 log x - x^4/96 - 11 x^4 /144.

Combine the constants:

- x^4 [ 1/96 + 11/144 ].

Find a common denominator, which is 288.

1/96 = 3/288.

11/144 = 22/288.

So total is 25/288.

So F_4(x) = (x^4/24) log x - (25 x^4 ) / 288.

Thus, F_4(1) = 0 - 25/288 ≈ -0.0868.

Wait, let me list the a_n's:

a_1 = -1 = -1/1.

a_2 = -3/4 = -0.75.

a_3 = -11/36 ≈ -0.3056.

a_4 = -25/288 ≈ -0.0868.

Hmm, each a_n is getting smaller in magnitude. So perhaps for each n, a_n = F_n(1) is (-1)^n * c_n, where c_n is positive and decreasing?

Wait, but for a_1, n=1: c_1=1.

a_2: c_2=3/4=0.75.

a_3: c_3=11/36≈0.3056.

a_4: 25/288≈0.0868.

Looking at the denominators: 1, 4, 36, 288. Hmm, 1=1!, 4=2×2, 36= (3!) × 2, 288= (4! ) × 2. Wait, 4! is 24, 288=24×12. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, 1 = 1, 4=4, 36= 36, 288=288.

Alternatively, perhaps n! is a factor in the denominator.

Looking at a_1: 1=1! → denominator 1! =1, numerator 1.

a_2: 3/4 → 3/(2×2) → denominator 2², but 2! is 2.

Hmm, not obvious. Let's see:

Another approach: perhaps each a_n can be written as (-1)^n * (H_n) / n!, where H_n is the nth harmonic number? Because harmonic numbers often show up in integrals involving logarithms.

Wait, let's test that. For a_1: H_1 =1. So (-1)^1 * H_1 /1! = -1, which matches.

a_2: H_2 = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. So (-1)^2 * (3/2)/2! = (3/2)/2 = 3/4. Which matches a_2= -3/4? Wait, no, a_2 is -3/4, but according to this, it would be positive 3/4. Hmm, but the sign is positive, but a_2 is negative. So maybe it's (-1)^{n+1} H_n /n! ?

Wait, let's try that.

For a_1: (-1)^{2} H_1 /1! = (1)(1)/1=1 → but a_1 is -1, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (-1)^n (H_n) /n!.

So for n=1: (-1)^1 H_1 /1! = (-1)(1)/1 = -1, which matches a_1.

n=2: (-1)^2 H_2 /2! = (1)(3/2)/2 = (3/2)/2=3/4, but a_2 is -3/4. So that would mean it's negative, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the sign wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different pattern. Let's see:

Looking at the a_n's:

n | a_n
1 | -1
2 | -3/4
3 | -11/36
4 | -25/288

Wait, perhaps the numerators are following a pattern similar to the denominators. Let me compute the numerators:

a_1: -1 → numerator 1.

a_2: -3/4 → numerator 3.

a_3: -11/36 → numerator 11.

a_4: -25/288 → numerator 25.

Hmm, 1,3,11,25...

Looking at differences: 3-1=2, 11-3=8, 25-11=14. Not obvious. Alternatively, 1=1^2, 3= not square, 11 is prime, 25=5^2. Not a clear pattern.

Wait, 1=1, 3=1+2, 11=3+8, 25=11+14. The increments are 2,8,14, which are 2=2×1, 8=2×4, 14=2×7. Not seeing a pattern.

Alternatively, think of these numerators as related to factorials. 1=1!, 3=3, 11= no, 25= no. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I can model a_n recursively. Since each F_{n+1}(x) is the integral of F_n(t) dt from 0 to x, then a_{n+1} = F_{n+1}(1) = ∫₀^1 F_n(t) dt.

So a_{n+1} = ∫₀^1 F_n(t) dt.

But F_n(t) is the (n)th integral of log(t). So perhaps each a_n is related to integrating log(t) n times from 0 to 1. So maybe a_n = (-1)^{n} ∫₀^1 (log t) (t)^{n-1} / (n-1)! dt or something. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each a_n can be expressed in terms of a_n = (-1)^n c_n / n!, but I'm not sure. Let's test this with the known values.

If a_n = (-1)^n c_n /n! , then:

For n=1: a_1= -1 → (-1)^1 c_1 /1! = -c_1 → so c_1=1.

n=2: a_2= -3/4 → (-1)^2 c_2 /2! = c_2/(2) → c_2= ( -3/4 ) *2 = -3/2. Wait, but this would give a negative c_2, which might not make sense if c_n is supposed to be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps c_n is positive, and the sign is included. So a_n = (-1)^n c_n /n!.

Then for n=1: a_1= -1 = (-1)^1 c_1 /1! → c_1=1.

n=2: a_2= -3/4 = (-1)^2 c_2 /2! → c_2 /2 = -3/4 → c_2= -3/2. Hmm, negative again. This doesn't seem helpful.

Alternative approach: perhaps integrate by parts each time and find a recursive formula for a_n.

Since a_{n+1} = ∫₀^1 F_n(t) dt.

And F_n(t) is the integral of F_{n-1}(t) from 0 to t.

Wait, maybe integrating F_n(t) from 0 to 1 can be expressed in terms of a_n.

Wait, another thought: Each time we integrate, we're adding another division by a factorial term, perhaps leading to something involving 1/n!.

So perhaps a_n is on the order of (-1)^n /n!.

But in our examples:

a_1= -1 = (-1)^1 /1! → yes.

a_2=
