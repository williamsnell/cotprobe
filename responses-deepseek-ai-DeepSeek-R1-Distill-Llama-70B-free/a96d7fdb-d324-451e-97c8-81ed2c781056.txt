Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. A boy is bailing a boat, lifting 2.0 kg of water to a height of 1.2 meters above the bilge. Then he pours the water over the side. There are two parts: (a) how much work does he perform, and (b) how much work is done by the force of gravity.

Hmm, I remember that work done by a force is calculated by the formula W = force × distance × cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the force and the displacement. So for part (a), the boy is lifting the water against gravity, so the force he's applying is in the same direction as the displacement (since he's lifting it upwards). So the angle theta is 0 degrees, and cos(0) is 1, so the work is just force times distance.

What's the force here? Oh right, the force is the weight of the water, which is mass times gravity. The mass is 2.0 kg, and I think g is 9.8 m/s². So force = 2.0 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 19.6 Newtons. The distance is 1.2 meters. So the work done by the boy is 19.6 N * 1.2 m = let's calculate that.

19.6 times 1.2. Hmm, 20 times 1.2 is 24, so 19.6 is 0.4 less than 20. So 24 minus (0.4 * 1.2) = 24 - 0.48 = 23.52 joules. Wait, but wait—am I calculating that right? Alternatively, 19.6 * 1.2. Let me compute 1.2 * 20 is 24, subtract 1.2 * 0.4 (which is 0.48) from that, so yes, 23.52 J.

But looking at the options, none of them list 23.5 J as an option for part a. Let me check the options again. Option G is 23.5 J and -23.5 J. Option J is 25 and -25. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses g=10 m/s² for simplicity. If that's the case, then the weight would be 2.0 kg * 10 = 20 N. Then work is 20 * 1.2 = 24 J. So part (a) would be 24 J.

Wait, but why would they use 10 instead of 9.8? Maybe the question expects that. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options, option H is 24, -24. So if part (a) is 24 J, then part (b) would be the work done by gravity, which would be negative, because gravity is opposing the motion. So when the boy lifts the water up, gravity does negative work.

Wait, but when the boy lifts the water, he's doing work against gravity. So the work done by gravity would be negative of the boy's work. So if the boy's work is 24 J, gravity does -24 J.

So part (a) is 24 J, part (b) is -24 J. So option H is 24, -24.

Wait, but wait again. Alternatively, let me think about the work done by gravity. The formula for gravitational potential energy is mgh. So when the boy lifts the water, the potential energy increases, which means the work done by gravity is negative because gravity is trying to pull it down. So the change in potential energy is positive (since the water is lifted), but the work done by gravity is equal to the negative of that change.

So change in potential energy is mgh = 2.0 * 9.8 * 1.2. Let me calculate that: 2 *9.8 is 19.6, times 1.2 is 23.52 J. So the work done by gravity is -23.52 J. So if the boy does 23.52 J of work, the work done by gravity is -23.52 J.

But the options don't have 23.5 as part (a) except for option G, which is 23.5 and -23.5. But if we use g=9.8, that would make sense. So if the boy does 23.5 J, and gravity does -23.5 J, then option G. But in the options, part (a) is the boy's work, which is positive, and part (b) is gravity's work, which is negative.

So perhaps the correct answer is option G, 23.5 and -23.5. But why in the options, option H is 24 and -24.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Maybe the problem is using g=10 for simplicity. So m=2 kg, g=10, h=1.2 m. So the boy's work is 2*10*1.2=24 J. Then gravity does -24 J. So that would be option H.

But wait, the question doesn't specify the value of g to use. In real exams, sometimes they take g as 9.8, sometimes 10. So I need to see which value gives an answer in the options.

Looking at the options, option G is 23.5 and -23.5, which would correspond to using g=9.8. Option H is 24 and -24, which uses g=10.

So which one is correct? Let me see. I think in this case, the options include both possibilities, so I need to pick between them.

But perhaps the problem expects us to use g=9.8. Let me do the exact calculation with 9.8.

Work done by the boy: W = mgh = 2.0 *9.8 *1.2.

Calculate 2 *9.8 = 19.6. 19.6 *1.2 is 23.52 J. So approximately 23.5 J. So option G is 23.5 and -23.5.

But wait, the options for part (a) and (b) are different. Let me see each option:

Option A: 18, -18 → 2.0 *9.8 * something? 18/19.6 would be less than 1 m.

Option B: 20, -20 → 20=2*10*1→ h=1m, but our h is 1.2.

Option C: 27 and -25 → not matching.

Option D: 21 and -19 → no.

Option E: 26, -26 → 26=2*13*1, but not sure.

Option F: 22 and -22 → 22=2*11*1, not matching.

Option G: 23.5 and -23.5 → fits with g=9.8.

Option H:24 and -24 →g=10.

Option I:19 and -21 → not.

Option J:25 and -25 → 25=5*5*1, not.

So if the question uses g=9.8, answer is G. If g=10, H.

Which one is more likely in this problem? Well, since it's a multiple-choice question, the options have both possibilities. So perhaps the intended answer is H, 24, -24. Maybe the problem expects g=10.

Alternatively, I should consider that the work done by the boy is the same as the gravitational potential energy gained, which is mgh. So the boy does positive work, and gravity does negative work of the same magnitude.

So if m=2 kg, h=1.2 m, g=9.8 m/s², then W_boy=+23.52 J, W_gravity=-23.52 J. So the closest option is G.

But looking at the options, option G says 23.5, -23.5. So that would be the correct choice.

Wait but earlier I thought that option H is 24, -24, which would be if g=10. So which is correct? I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question states g=9.8, but in the options, it's rounded to 23.5.

So the correct calculation is 2 *9.8*1.2 =23.52, which rounds to 23.5. So part (a) is 23.5 J, part (b) is -23.5 J.

So the correct answer would be option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is 23.5 and -23.5. So that's the correct one.

To solve the problem, we calculate the work done by the boy and the work done by gravity using the formula for work, \( W = mgh \), where \( m \) is the mass, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height.

### Part (a): Work done by the boy
The boy lifts 2.0 kg of water to a height of 1.2 m. Assuming \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):
\[
W_{\text{boy}} = mgh = 2.0 \times 9.8 \times 1.2 = 23.52 \, \text{J}
\]
This rounds to \( 23.5 \, \text{J} \).

### Part (b): Work done by gravity
Gravity acts in the opposite direction of the displacement, so the work done by gravity is:
\[
W_{\text{gravity}} = -mgh = -2.0 \times 9.8 \times 1.2 = -23.52 \, \text{J}
\]
This rounds to \( -23.5 \, \text{J} \).

### Final Answer
The work done by the boy is \( +23.5 \, \text{J} \), and the work done by gravity is \( -23.5 \, \text{J} \). Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is **G: 23.5 joules, -23.5 joules**.
