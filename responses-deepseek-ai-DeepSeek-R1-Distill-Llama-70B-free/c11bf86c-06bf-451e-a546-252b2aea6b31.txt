Question:

Late one night, co-defendants broke into a warehouse and proceeded to load the large crates of appliances onto their truck. As they were leaving, one of the co-defendants inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the co-defendants had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, neither did so. Instead, they climbed into the truck and fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. At common law, the co-defendants should be found guilty of

Options:

A: burglary and larceny.
B: burglary only.
C: burglary and arson.
D: larceny and arson.
E: burglary, arson, and criminal negligence.
F: burglary, larceny, and arson.
G: arson only.
H: larceny only.
I: larceny, arson, and criminal negligence.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically common law. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it carefully.

The question describes a scenario where two co-defendants broke into a warehouse at night. They loaded large crates of appliances onto their truck. As they were leaving, one of them tossed a cigarette butt into a pile of refuse—old cardboard boxes and papers. The refuse caught fire, but instead of putting it out, they just left. The fire spread and engulfed the warehouse. The question is asking what they should be guilty of under common law.

The options are A through I, each combining different crimes. Let's break down the possible crimes here.

First, let's recall the common law definitions. Common law crimes include burglary, larceny, arson, etc.

Burglary at common law is the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. So, breaking into the warehouse with the intent to steal (which is a felony) would make it burglary. They broke in, so the act is there, and their intent was to steal the appliances. So burglary seems applicable.

Next, larceny. Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of another's personal property with intent to permanently deprive. Here, they loaded crates onto their truck, which is taking and carrying away. So larceny would apply as well. But wait, in some jurisdictions, burglary and larceny are considered separate crimes, but they often go together. So they might both apply.

Now, what about arson? Arson at common law is the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. So, the key elements are maliciously burning a dwelling. Let's see. They threw a cigarette butt into a refuse pile, which ignited. They didn't try to put it out and left. The fire spread and destroyed the warehouse.

But wait, the warehouse is a building, so that's a structure. The intent here is crucial. Did they intend to burn the warehouse, or was it an accident? They threw a cigarette butt into a pile of flammable materials, but was that an intentional act to cause a fire? Or was it careless?

At common law, the mens rea for arson is malice, which can be express or implied. Express malice would be intentionally setting fire to the building. Implied malice could be acting with reckless disregard for human life or with the knowledge that the act would naturally result in such a burning.

But in this case, they didn't intentionally set the warehouse on fire. It was an accident from the cigarette. However, they saw the fire start and chose not to put it out, just leaving. So, their initial act was throwing the butt, which caused the fire. But did they have the intent to burn the building?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps they could be guilty of arson under a different theory, like reckless burning. But wait, at common law, I think arson required a malicious intent, so recklessness might not suffice. So maybe they aren't guilty of arson because they didn't intend to burn the building.

Alternatively, maybe they could be guilty of criminal negligence, but that's a different offense. But the question is about common law crimes. Criminal negligence might not be a traditional common law offense; perhaps it's more of a statutory crime.

So, considering the elements, did their action constitute arson? They didn't intend to set the warehouse on fire. The fire started accidentally. So perhaps they aren't guilty of arson. But wait, what about the concept of transferred intent? No, transferred intent applies when the intent is directed at a different target, leading to unintended harm. But in this case, the intent was to commit burglary and larceny. The fire was an unintended consequence, but without intent to burn, I don't think it's arson.

Wait, but another point: if they created a fire and then failed to extinguish it, could that be seen as reckless endangerment or something else? But again, under common law, arson requires malice, so unless they intended to burn the building, they might not be guilty of arson. So perhaps they aren't guilty of arson.

So, putting it together, they broke into the building (burglary) and stole the goods (larceny). So the crimes would be burglary and larceny.

Looking at the options:

A: burglary and larceny. That seems right.

Option F is burglary, larceny, and arson. But if arson isn't applicable, then F is out.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about arson. Arson requires the malicious burning of a dwelling. If the warehouse is a dwelling? Wait, no, a warehouse is not a dwelling. At common law, I think arson applied to the burning of a dwelling, not other structures. So a warehouse might not count as a dwelling. Therefore, arson might not apply here.

Wait, but maybe at common law, arson could apply to any building, not just dwellings. I'm a bit unsure about that. Some sources say that at common law, arson was limited to dwellings, while other structures could be considered under different offenses, like "burning with intent to defraud" (like burning your own warehouse for insurance). But in this case, it's a third-party warehouse, and the fire was accidental.

So, if the warehouse isn't a dwelling, then arson wouldn't apply. So no arson.

So the crimes would be burglary and larceny. So option A.

But wait, another thought: some jurisdictions might have broader definitions of arson. Maybe the common law has expanded beyond dwellings. But traditionally, I think it's dwellings only.

Therefore, the answer should be A: burglary and larceny.

Wait, but let me confirm the elements again. Burglary requires breaking and entering a dwelling at night with intent to commit a felony. But a warehouse is a commercial building, not a dwelling. So does burglary apply to non-dwellings?

Oh, wait, that's a crucial point! At common law, burglary was specifically for the dwelling of another. So if the building isn't a dwelling, like a warehouse, then it wouldn't be burglary. Oh, that changes everything.

So, rethinking: if the warehouse is a commercial building and not a dwelling, then the entry doesn't constitute burglary under common law. So the initial assumption that it's burglary might be wrong.

Wait, but sometimes "dwelling" can include any building where people live, but a warehouse is used for storage, not as a dwelling. So breaking into a warehouse at night with intent to commit larceny would not be burglary because it's not a dwelling. So no burglary. Then what?

In that case, the crimes would be larceny (since they took the goods) and perhaps something else. But without burglary, what else applies?

Wait, when they broke into the warehouse, that's unlawful entry, which is a trespass. But without the intent to commit a felony inside, which is larceny, but if it's not a dwelling, then it's not burglary. So maybe they're guilty of breaking and entering (which is a separate crime, but perhaps not called burglary) and larceny.

But the options don't include breaking and entering; they only include burglary. So in the options, if the building isn't a dwelling, burglary doesn't apply. So the crimes would be larceny, and perhaps other charges.

But then, what about the fire? If it's not a dwelling, but the fire caused damage to the warehouse, which is a building, perhaps under a different arson statute. But I thought common law arson requires a dwelling. So if the warehouse isn't a dwelling, then no arson.

Wait, but maybe there's another angle. If the fire was caused by their criminal negligence, perhaps that's a different offense, but under common law, I'm not sure if criminal negligence is a recognized crime in this context. It's possible that they could be charged with arson if the fire was a natural and probable consequence of their actions, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe they're guilty of arson regardless of intent, but I think under common law, intent is required.

Wait, perhaps the initial entry isn't burglary because it's not a dwelling. So they committed larceny when they took the goods. Then, their act of throwing the cigarette and causing the fire—could that be considered arson?

But again, without intent to burn the building, it's probably not arson. So maybe they're guilty of larceny and perhaps some other offense related to the fire, but not arson.

But the options don't include anything about negligence, only the listed crimes. So perhaps the answer is larceny only.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial entry was trespassory. They broke in, which is breaking and entering, but without it being a dwelling, it's not burglary. So if breaking and entering a non-dwelling is a crime, but the question is about common law. At common law, I think breaking and entering a non-dwelling with intent to commit a felony is still a crime, but it's not called burglary. Burglary specifically applies to dwellings.

So, perhaps they are guilty of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, which is a felony, making it a form of burglary? Wait, no, because the building isn't a dwelling. So, it's not burglary.

So, they are guilty of larceny (since they took the goods) and perhaps of arson if the fire meets the elements.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to outline:

1. Entry into warehouse: Not a dwelling, so no burglary. But breaking and entering could be a crime, but perhaps not one of the options here.

2. Took goods: Larceny applies.

3. Caused a fire: If it's a dwelling, then arson. If not, maybe not.

But the warehouse is not a dwelling, so no arson.

So the crimes would be larceny and perhaps breaking and entering, but the options don't include that combination. The options have combinations like burglary, larceny, arson, etc.

Wait, the question says "co-defendants broke into a warehouse", so the entry is there, but if it's not a dwelling, no burglary. So perhaps they are guilty of larceny, but what about the fire?

Wait, another angle: If the fire was a direct result of their actions, could they be guilty of arson under the theory of reckless burning? But under common law, I think malice was required, which implies intent, so recklessness might not suffice.

Alternatively, perhaps they can be convicted of arson because they created a fire that spread, even if they didn't intend it. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the act of throwing the cigarette butt into a pile of flammable materials could be seen as an intentional act that a reasonable person would know could cause a fire. If the co-defendants had the intent to create a fire, even a small one, then it could be arson. But they were just carelessly discarding the butt, not intending to start a fire. So, perhaps it's not arson.

So, putting it all together, they committed larceny by taking the goods. They broke into the warehouse, but since it's not a dwelling, no burglary. The fire may not constitute arson because of lack of intent. So, the only crime is larceny.

Looking at the options, option H is larceny only. Option A is burglary and larceny, but since it's not a dwelling, no burglary.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about whether a warehouse is considered a dwelling. That's a key point. At common law, burglary required the breaking into a dwelling. So if the warehouse isn't a dwelling, then no burglary.

So, the answer would be H: larceny only.

But wait, another point: perhaps the initial entry was for a felonious intent, but the building isn't a dwelling. So, perhaps they are guilty of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, but that's not one of the options. The options don't include that; they only include burglary, which requires a dwelling.

So, with that, I think the answer is A: burglary and larceny only if the warehouse is a dwelling, but if it's not, then H: larceny only.

Wait, but the question says "warehouse", which is a business structure, not a dwelling. So, no burglary. So only larceny applies. So the correct answer would be H.

But wait, the initial act of breaking into the warehouse to commit larceny would make them guilty of breaking and entering, but I'm not sure if that's a separate offense in the options. The options don't list it, so perhaps the answer is H.

But I'm a bit torn because if the fire is considered arson, but without intent, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the original scenario meant that the warehouse was someone's dwelling, which seems unlikely. But the question says warehouse, so probably not a dwelling.

So, the conclusion is that the co-defendants are guilty of larceny only. So the answer is H.

Wait, but let's look again at the options:

Option A: burglary and larceny.

Option H: larceny only.

So if the building isn't a dwelling, no burglary. So H.

But wait, wait, some sources say that at common law, burglary could also apply to other structures if they were within the curtilage of a dwelling, but that's probably not the case here. So, no burglary.

So, the answer is H: larceny only.

But wait, another possibility: when they committed the arson, perhaps that's a separate felony. But I don't think so because of the intent issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial intent to commit larceny (which is a felony) makes the breaking and entering a burglary, but that's only if the structure is a dwelling. Since it's a warehouse, no.

So, after considering all this, the answer should be H.

The question involves determining the crimes for which the co-defendants should be guilty under common law. The scenario describes co-defendants breaking into a warehouse, committing larceny by stealing appliances, and accidentally starting a fire by discarding a cigarette butt. The fire spread and destroyed the warehouse. The analysis focuses on the common law definitions of burglary, larceny, and arson.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Burglary**:  
   At common law, burglary requires unlawful entry into a **dwelling** with the intent to commit a felony inside. A warehouse is a commercial structure, not a dwelling, so burglary does not apply. Without the dwelling element, the breaking and entering does not constitute burglary.

2. **Larceny**:  
   Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of another's personal property with intent to permanently deprive. The co-defendants took the appliances, satisfying the elements of larceny. Thus, they are guilty of larceny.

3. **Arson**:  
   Arson at common law requires the malicious burning of a **dwelling**. A warehouse is not a dwelling, so arson does not apply. Additionally, the fire was accidental, and there is no evidence of intent or malice to burn the building. Therefore, arson is not applicable.

4. **Other Considerations**:  
   The co-defendants' failure to extinguish the fire might raise questions about negligence or recklessness, but these are not traditional common law crimes in this context. The question focuses on burglary, larceny, and arson, so these other considerations are irrelevant to the answer.

### Conclusion:  
The co-defendants are guilty of **larceny only**, as burglary and arson do not apply under the given circumstances. The correct answer is:

**H: larceny only.**

H
