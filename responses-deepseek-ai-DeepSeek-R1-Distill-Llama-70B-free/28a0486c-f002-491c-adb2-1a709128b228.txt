Okay, so I have this problem here where Ramanujan and Hardy each picked a complex number. The product of their numbers is given as 32 - 8i. Hardy picked 5 + 3i, and I need to find out what Ramanujan's number was. The options are from A to J, so I have to figure it out.

First, I remember that when you multiply two complex numbers, you get another complex number. So if I have two complex numbers, let's say z1 and z2, their product is z1 * z2. Here, z1 is Hardy's number, which is 5 + 3i, and z2 is Ramanujan's number, which I need to find. The product is given as 32 -8i.

So the equation is (5 + 3i) * (a + bi) = 32 -8i. I need to find a and b, which are the real and imaginary parts of Ramanujan's number.

Wait, maybe a better way is to divide the product by Hardy's number to get Ramanujan's number. Because if (5 + 3i) * z = 32 -8i, then z = (32 -8i) / (5 + 3i). That makes sense.

So I need to compute (32 -8i) divided by (5 + 3i). Dividing complex numbers can be done by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.

The conjugate of 5 + 3i is 5 - 3i. So I'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by that.

Let's compute the numerator first:

(32 -8i) * (5 -3i)
= 32*5 + 32*(-3i) + (-8i)*5 + (-8i)*(-3i)
= 160 -96i -40i +24i²

Wait, i squared is -1, so 24i² is 24*(-1) = -24.

So combine like terms:

Real parts: 160 -24 = 136
Imaginary parts: (-96i -40i) = -136i
So numerator becomes 136 -136i.

Denominator is (5 +3i)*(5-3i) = 5² - (3i)^2. Because (a+b)(a-b) = a² -b².

So 25 - 9i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 25 -9*(-1) = 25 +9 =34.

So denominator is 34.

Therefore, the division is (136 -136i)/34. Let's compute that:

136/34 =4, and -136i/34= -4i.

So the result is 4 -4i.

Looking at the options, option G is 4-4i. So Ramanujan's number must be option G.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me multiply Hardy's number (5+3i) by 4-4i and see if I get 32-8i.

(5+3i)(4-4i) = 5*4 +5*(-4i) +3i*4 +3i*(-4i)
=20 -20i +12i -12i²

Again, i² is -1, so -12i² is +12.

Combine real parts: 20 +12=32
Imaginary parts: (-20i +12i)= -8i
So product is 32-8i, which matches. So yes, option G is correct.

To determine the complex number Ramanujan picked, we know that the product of Hardy's and Ramanujan's numbers is \( 32 - 8i \), and Hardy picked \( 5 + 3i \). Let Ramanujan's number be \( z = a + bi \). The equation becomes:

\[
(5 + 3i)(a + bi) = 32 - 8i
\]

To find \( z \), divide \( 32 - 8i \) by \( 5 + 3i \):

\[
z = \frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i}
\]

Dividing complex numbers involves multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \( 5 + 3i \) is \( 5 - 3i \). Thus:

\[
z = \frac{(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i)}{(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i)}
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) = 32 \cdot 5 + 32 \cdot (-3i) + (-8i) \cdot 5 + (-8i) \cdot (-3i)
\]
\[
= 160 - 96i - 40i + 24i^2
\]
\[
= 160 - 136i + 24(-1) \quad (\text{since } i^2 = -1)
\]
\[
= 160 - 136i - 24
\]
\[
= 136 - 136i
\]

Next, compute the denominator:

\[
(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 5^2 - (3i)^2 = 25 - 9i^2
\]
\[
= 25 - 9(-1) \quad (\text{since } i^2 = -1)
\]
\[
= 25 + 9 = 34
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
z = \frac{136 - 136i}{34} = 4 - 4i
\]

Thus, Ramanujan's number is \( 4 - 4i \), which corresponds to option **G**.

To verify, multiply Hardy's number \( 5 + 3i \) by \( 4 - 4i \):

\[
(5 + 3i)(4 - 4i) = 5 \cdot 4 + 5 \cdot (-4i) + 3i \cdot 4 + 3i \cdot (-4i)
\]
\[
= 20 - 20i + 12i - 12i^2
\]
\[
= 20 - 8i + 12 \quad (\text{since } i^2 = -1)
\]
\[
= 32 - 8i
\]

The product matches the given value, confirming that the correct answer is **G**.
