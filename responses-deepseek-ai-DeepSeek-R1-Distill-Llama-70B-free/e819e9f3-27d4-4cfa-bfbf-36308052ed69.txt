Question:

Data were collected on two variables X and Y and a least squares regression line was fitted to the data. The estimated equation for this data is y = –2.29 + 1.70x. One point has x = 5, y = 6. What is the residual for this point?

Options:

A: 1.70
B: –0.21
C: -6.21
D: -5.00
E: –1.70
F: -7.91
G: 5.00
H: 7.91
I: 0.21
J: 6.21

Okay, so I've got this question about residuals in a regression analysis. Hmm, I remember that residuals are the differences between the observed y-values and the predicted y-values from the regression line. Right, so the formula should be residual = observed y - predicted y.

The given regression equation is y = –2.29 + 1.70x. Oh wait, so for any x value, I can plug it into this equation to get the predicted y. Then, subtract that from the actual y to find the residual.

The point given is x=5, y=6. So first, I need to calculate the predicted y when x is 5. Let me do that. So plug x=5 into the equation: y = -2.29 + 1.70*(5). Let's compute 1.70 times 5. 1.7 *5 is 8.5. Then subtract 2.29 from that. Wait, no, the equation is negative 2.29 plus 8.5. So 8.5 - 2.29 equals... let me calculate that. 8.5 minus 2 is 6.5, and then minus 0.29, which is 6.21. So the predicted y is 6.21.

Now the observed y is 6. So the residual is observed y minus predicted y. That would be 6 - 6.21. Let me subtract that: 6 is 6.00, so 6.00 minus 6.21 is -0.21. So the residual should be -0.21.

Looking at the options, option B is -0.21. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait wait, did I compute that right? Let me double-check the calculations. 1.70 *5 is indeed 8.5. Then 8.5 - 2.29: 8.5 minus 2 is 6.5, then minus 0.29 gives 6.21. Observed y is 6, so 6 minus 6.21 is -0.21. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is B.

The residual is calculated as the difference between the observed y-value and the predicted y-value from the regression equation. Given the regression equation \( y = -2.29 + 1.70x \) and the point \( (x = 5, y = 6) \):

1. **Predicted y-value**: Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the regression equation:
   \[
   \hat{y} = -2.29 + 1.70(5) = -2.29 + 8.5 = 6.21
   \]

2. **Residual**: Subtract the predicted y-value from the observed y-value:
   \[
   \text{Residual} = y - \hat{y} = 6 - 6.21 = -0.21
   \]

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: -0.21**.
