Okay, so I have this problem about a family with eight children and their ages. I need to find the measures of central tendency and the range. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but let me think step by step.

First, the data given is the ages: 9, 11, 8, 15, 14, 12, 17, 14. So, there are eight numbers here. 

For part (a), I need the mean, median, and mode. Let's tackle each one.

Mean is the average, right? So I sum all the ages and divide by the number of children. Let me add them up.

9 + 11 is 20. Plus 8 is 28. 28 +15 is 43. Plus 14 is 57. Add another 12: 69. Then 17: 86. And the last 14 makes it 100. Oh wait, wait, no, let me recount. Wait, 9+11=20, plus 8 is 28, plus15 is 43, plus14 is 57, plus12 is 69, plus17 is 86, plus14 is 100. So the total is 100. There are 8 children, so mean is 100/8 = 12.5 years.

Wait, is that right? Let me check the addition again. 9+11=20, +8=28; 28+15=43; 43+14=57; 57+12=69; 69+17=86; 86+14=100. Yep, correct. So mean is 12.5.

Next, the median. Since there are 8 numbers, which is even, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th numbers when sorted. So first, I need to sort the ages.

Let me arrange them in order: 8,9,11,12,14,14,15,17.

So the fourth number is 12 and the fifth is 14. The average of 12 and 14 is (12+14)/2 = 26/2 =13. So median is 13.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 8 numbers: positions 1 to 8. So for even count, it's (n/2) and (n/2 +1) terms. So positions 4 and 5. Let me count: 8 is 1, 9 is 2, 11 is 3, 12 is 4, 14 is 5, 14 is 6, 15 is7, 17 is8. So fourth is 12, fifth is14. So yes, average is 13. So median is 13.

Now the mode. Mode is the most frequent number. Looking at the sorted list: 8,9,11,12,14,14,15,17. 14 appears twice, others once. So mode is 14.

So for part (a), mean is 12.5, median 13, mode 14.

Part (b) is the range. Range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. Highest age is 17, lowest is 8. So 17-8=9. So range is 9.

Now let's look at the options to find which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option I: Mean 12.5, median 13, mode 14, range 9.

Wait, let me check each option.

Option C: Mean 13.5, median 12.5, mode14, range8. No, because mean was 12.5.

Option I: Mean 12.5, median13, mode14, range9. Yes, that fits.

Wait, checking the options:

Option I says:

Mean: 12.5 years,

Median:13,

Mode:14,

Range:9.

Yes, that's exactly what I calculated.

The ages of the children are: 9, 11, 8, 15, 14, 12, 17, 14. To solve the problem:

1. **Mean**: The mean is calculated by summing all the ages and dividing by the number of children.  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 9 + 11 + 8 + 15 + 14 + 12 + 17 + 14 = 100
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Median**: The median is the average of the 4th and 5th values in the sorted list. Sorting the ages:  
   \[
   8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 14, 15, 17
   \]  
   The 4th value is 12, and the 5th value is 14.  
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{12 + 14}{2} = 13.
   \]

3. **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently occurring value. In the sorted list, the number 14 appears twice, more than any other number.  
   \[
   \text{Mode} = 14.
   \]

4. **Range**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.  
   \[
   \text{Range} = 17 - 8 = 9.
   \]

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**I: Mean: 12.5 years, Median: 13, Mode: 14, Range: 9.**
