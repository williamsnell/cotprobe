Okay, so I've got this question here about solar flux and a solar collector in Regina, Saskatchewan. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question asks for the fraction of the standard solar flux (which is about 1000 W/m²) that's available to a solar collector lying flat on the Earth's surface at noon on the summer solstice in Regina. Regina's latitude is 50°N. 

Wait, solar flux... I remember that the amount of solar energy reaching a surface depends on the angle at which the sun's rays hit the surface. When the sun is directly overhead, the flux is maximum. But when it's at an angle, like in higher latitudes, the same amount of energy is spread out over a larger area, so the flux decreases.

Oh right, the formula for the solar flux at a certain latitude is something like S = S0 * cos(latitude), but wait, is it just the cosine of the latitude? Or is there more to it because of the Earth's tilt and the time of year?

Wait, the summer solstice is when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so the sun is as high in the sky as it gets for that latitude. So for a location at latitude φ, the solar zenith angle at noon on the summer solstice would be... I think the solar zenith angle θ is 90 degrees minus the sum of the latitude and the Earth's axial tilt. Wait no, wait. Earth's axial tilt is about 23.5 degrees. So when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the declination δ is +23.5°. 

The solar altitude angle (the angle above the horizon) at solar noon on the summer solstice would be higher than on other days. The formula for the solar elevation angle at solar noon on the summer solstice is: altitude = 90° - (latitude - declination). So, for Regina, latitude φ is 50°N, declination δ is +23.5°. So altitude angle θ is 90 - (50 - 23.5) = 90 - 26.5 = 63.5 degrees above the horizon. So the sun's rays make an angle θ from the vertical of 63.5 degrees. No wait, wait, the solar zenith angle is the angle from the vertical (so 90° would be at the horizon, 0° directly overhead). So when the sun is at an altitude of 63.5 degrees, the zenith angle is 90 - 63.5 = 26.5 degrees. 

Wait, no, maybe I got that reversed. The solar elevation angle (altitude) is measured from the horizon. So if the sun is at 63.5 degrees above the horizon, the zenith angle is 90 - 63.5 = 26.5 degrees from straight up. So the angle between the sun's rays and the vertical is 26.5 degrees. 

The solar flux S on a horizontal surface would be S0 multiplied by the cosine of the zenith angle. Because when the sun is directly overhead (zenith angle 0), S = S0 * cos(0) = S0. When the sun is at horizon, it's S0 * cos(90) = 0. 

Wait, but wait, the standard solar flux is 1000 W/m² when the sun is at the zenith (so S0 is 1000 W/m²). So the actual flux on a horizontal surface would be S = S0 * cos(θ), where θ is the zenith angle. 

So in this case, θ is 26.5 degrees. So the flux is 1000 * cos(26.5°). Let me calculate that. 

What's cos(26.5)? Let me think. Cos(30) is about 0.866. Cos(25) is about 0.9063. 26.5 is between 25 and 30. Let me approximate. At 26 degrees, cos is approximately 0.8988. At 26.5, maybe around 0.895? Let me check (but since I don't have a calculator, I'll have to approximate).

Alternatively, using a calculator approach—though I can't do that here—I recall that cos(26.5) is approximately 0.891. So S would be about 1000 * 0.891 = 891 W/m². 

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, the question is about the fraction available. So the fraction is 0.891. So looking at the options, option B is 0.891. Hmm, but wait another thought: Is there any correction for the atmosphere? Because the 1000 W/m² is the flux outside the atmosphere, but at the Earth's surface, it's less due to absorption. But the question says the standard solar flux is about 1000 W/m², so I think that's measured at the surface under standard conditions, so we don't need to adjust for atmosphere in this calculation. 

Another point: The collector is lying flat on the Earth's surface. So it's a horizontal surface, and the calculation is correct as S = S0 * cos(theta). 

So the fraction is 0.891. So the correct answer would be option B.

To determine the fraction of the standard solar flux reaching a solar collector lying flat on the Earth’s surface at Regina, Saskatchewan (latitude 50°N) at noon on the summer solstice, we need to account for the solar zenith angle and its effect on the flux.

The standard solar flux is given as 1000 W/m², which corresponds to the flux when the sun is directly overhead (zenith angle = 0°). At noon on the summer solstice, the solar elevation angle (altitude) for Regina is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Altitude} = 90^\circ - (\text{latitude} - \text{declination})
\]

Here, the latitude \(\phi = 50^\circ\)N, and the declination \(\delta = +23.5^\circ\) (since it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{Altitude} = 90^\circ - (50^\circ - 23.5^\circ) = 90^\circ - 26.5^\circ = 63.5^\circ
\]

The solar zenith angle \(\theta\) is the complement of the elevation angle:

\[
\theta = 90^\circ - \text{Altitude} = 90^\circ - 63.5^\circ = 26.5^\circ
\]

The solar flux \(S\) on a horizontal surface is given by:

\[
S = S_0 \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]

where \(S_0 = 1000 \, \text{W/m}^2\) is the standard solar flux. Substituting \(\theta = 26.5^\circ\):

\[
S = 1000 \cdot \cos(26.5^\circ)
\]

Using \(\cos(26.5^\circ) \approx 0.891\):

\[
S = 1000 \cdot 0.891 = 891 \, \text{W/m}^2
\]

The fraction of the standard solar flux available to the collector is therefore:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{S}{S_0} = 0.891
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: 0.891**
