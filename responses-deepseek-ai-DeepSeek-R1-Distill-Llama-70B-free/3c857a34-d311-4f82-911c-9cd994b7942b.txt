Okay, so I've got this Supreme Court question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that older workers no longer need to prove something to win a job discrimination suit. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in the past, for discrimination cases, especially under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), plaintiffs usually had to prove that age was the "but-for" cause of the adverse action. That means they had to show that age was the determining factor. But I think there was a recent Supreme Court case that changed this.

Wait, the case I'm thinking of is Babb v. Wilkie, right? It was a case where the court ruled on the standard for proving age discrimination. In that case, the court held that federal employees only need to show that age was a contributing factor, not the sole reason, to prove discrimination. So, the burden of proof is lower now.

The question is asking what older workers no longer need to prove. Before the ruling, they had to prove that age was the main or primary reason. So the correct answer would be the option that refers to proving that age was the determining factor or the main cause.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D is "Intention." I think intention refers to proving that the employer intentionally discriminated, which might relate to the "but-for" standard. Option F is "Age bias," but that seems more like the general discrimination itself, not the standard of proof. Option I is "Negative impact," which is more about disparate impact cases, not necessarily the same as proving the employer's intent.

Wait, another thought: The "but-for" standard requires showing that the action would not have occurred but for the protected characteristic. So the old standard was higher. If the Supreme Court now says they don't need to prove that, then the missing word is probably "intention" or "discrimination." But wait, discrimination is the overall claim, not the standard.

Alternatively, maybe the correct term is "intent" or "discriminatory intent." So older workers don't need to prove that the employer intended to discriminate based on age as the main cause. They just need to show it was a contributing factor.

Looking at the options again, option D is "Intention." So the answer would be D. They no longer need to prove intention, meaning they don't have to show that age was the sole reason, just a contributing factor.

Wait, but another option: Option B is "Discrimination" itself, but that doesn't make sense because the suit is about discrimination. They still have to prove discrimination, just not under the stricter standard.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F: Age bias, but I think that's not the correct term here. The standard is about the burden of proof regarding the employer's intent or the causation.

So I'm leaning towards D: Intention because the court lowered the standard from "but-for" to "contributing factor," meaning they don't need to prove that age was the intention behind the action, just that it was a factor.

The correct answer is D: Intention. The Supreme Court ruled that older workers no longer need to prove that age was the sole or primary intention behind the adverse action, only that it was a contributing factor.

Answer: D
