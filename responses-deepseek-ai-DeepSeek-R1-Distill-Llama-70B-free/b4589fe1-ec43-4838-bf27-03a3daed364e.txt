Okay, so I've got this problem here about a factory with a lagging load and they're using a synchronous capacitor to improve the power factor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on power factor correction, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The problem gives me that the factory is drawing 2000 kW at a power factor of 0.6 from a 6000 V supply. They're adding a synchronous capacitor to raise the power factor to unity. The losses in the capacitor are 275 kW. I need to find three things: the original kvars of the lagging load, the kvars needed for correction, and the kVAR rating of the capacitor along with its power factor.

Let me break this down. First, I remember that power factor (pf) is the ratio of real power (P) to apparent power (S). So, P = pf * S. But also, in terms of reactive power (Q), we have Q = P * tan(theta), where theta is the angle whose cosine is the power factor. Since the load is lagging, the reactive power is positive in the lagging direction.

Wait, actually, wait. So for the original load, the real power P is 2000 kW. The power factor is 0.6 lagging. So the reactive power Q can be calculated using P and pf.

Right, the formula for reactive power Q is P / pf * sqrt(1 - pf²), but wait, maybe it's better to calculate it using the relation between P, Q, and S.

The original load has a power factor of 0.6. So P = 2000 kW, and the apparent power S is P / pf = 2000 / 0.6 ≈ 3333.33 kVA. Then, the reactive power Q is sqrt(S² - P²). So Q = sqrt( (3333.33)^2 - (2000)^2 ). Let me compute that:

3333.33 squared is about 11,111,111 (since 3333^2 is approx 11,108,889). 2000 squared is 4,000,000. So Q squared is 11,111,111 - 4,000,000 = 7,111,111. The square root of that is around 2666.67 kvars. So that's the original reactive power. So part (a) is 2667 kvars, I think.

Wait, but let me make sure: the original load is lagging, so the reactive power is positive in the lagging direction. So the original kvars are 2667, and it's lagging.

Now, part (b): the kvars needed to bring the power factor to unity. When the power factor is unity, the reactive power should be zero. So the synchronous capacitor will supply the necessary leading reactive power to cancel out the lagging Q of the load.

Wait, but wait a second. The total reactive power after correction should be zero. So the capacitor needs to supply the same magnitude but opposite sign of the original load's reactive power. So the required correction is 2667 kvars leading.

But wait, the problem mentions that the synchronous capacitor has losses of 275 kW. Hmm, so I need to account for those losses. Because when the capacitor is running, it consumes some real power (the losses), which affects the overall real power. So I might need to adjust my calculations.

Wait, let me think again. The real power drawn from the mains is the sum of the load's real power plus the capacitor's losses. Because the capacitor's losses are real power that's being consumed.

Wait, the original load takes 2000 kW real power. The capacitor has losses of 275 kW, so the total real power drawn from the mains becomes 2000 + 275 = 2275 kW. But the problem states that the factory draws 2000 kW. Or wait, no, the factory's load is 2000 kW, but the capacitor adds its own losses. So after adding the capacitor, the total real power is load's P plus capacitor's losses.

But wait, the goal is to have the total power factor be unity. So the total real power P_total is 2000 kW plus 275 kW = 2275 kW. And the total reactive power Q_total should be zero for unity pf.

So the apparent power S_total after correction is P_total / pf. Since pf is 1, S_total is 2275 kVA.

But before correction, the load's apparent power was 3333.33 kVA. So the capacitor must supply the necessary reactive power and account for the loss.

Wait, maybe I should model this as the system after adding the capacitor. So the original load has S1 = 3333.33 kVA, P1 = 2000 kW, Q1 = 2667 kvar (lagging). The capacitor has losses P_loss = 275 kW, and it also has some Q2 which is leading (since it's a capacitor).

So the total real power is P1 + P_loss = 2275 kW. The total Q is Q1 + Q2 = 0 (for unity pf), so Q2 = -Q1 = -2667 kvar. But since the capacitor provides leading Q, it's positive in the leading direction, so perhaps I should write it as Q2 = 2667 kvar leading.

Wait, but the capacitor's losses are real power, so the capacitor itself has a certain apparent power, which includes both its real and reactive power. So for the capacitor, S_cap = sqrt( (P_loss)^2 + (Q2)^2 ). So S_cap = sqrt(275^2 + 2667^2 ). Let me compute that.

275 squared is 75625. 2667 squared is approximately 7,111,889. So sum is 75625 + 7,111,889 = 7,187,514. Square root of that: let's see. 2679^2 is 7,181, 241 (since 2679*2679 is (approx 2680^2=7,182,400) minus some). Wait, alternatively, let me compute sqrt(7,187,514). Let's see:

2679^2 = 7,181, 241 (since 2679 = 2600 +79; 2600²=6,760,000, 2*2600*79= 2*205,400=410,800; 79²=6241. So 6,760,000 +410,800 =7,170,800 +6,241=7,177,041). Hmm, no, that's 2679²=7,177,041. My target is 7,187,514, which is higher.

So 2679^2 =7,177,041. 7,187,514 - 7,177,041=10,473. So 2679 + x)^2=7,187,514. Let's approximate x.

(2679 + x)^2 ≈ 2679² + 2*2679*x = 7,177,041 + 5358 x. Set equal to 7,187,514 → 5358 x = 10,473 → x≈10,473 /5358 ≈ 1.954. So approx 2679 +1.95≈2680.95. So about 2681 kVA. So the capacitor's apparent power S_cap is approximately 2681 kVA.

But wait, looking at the options, I don't see an exact match. Let me see the options. Option J is 2667 kvars, 2755 kVA, 0.103 leading. Option C is 2667 kvars, 3300 kVA, 0.09 leading.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the real power. Because the capacitor's losses are part of the real power, but when calculating the power factor, the total real power is the sum of the load's real power and the capacitor's losses. Let me think again.

The system after adding the capacitor must have a power factor of 1. That means Q_total is zero. So the capacitor must supply exactly the Q that cancels the load's Q. So Q_cap = - Q_load. So Q_cap is 2667 kvar leading.

But the capacitor has losses, which are real power. So the capacitor itself consumes 275 kW. Therefore, the total real power drawn from the mains is 2000 + 275 = 2275 kW.

The capacitor's apparent power is the vector sum of its real and reactive power. So S_cap = sqrt( (275)^2 + (2667)^2 ). Let me compute that more accurately.

275^2 = 75625, 2667^2 = (2667)^2.

Wait, 2667 * 2667: Let me compute 2667^2.

I can compute 2667 * 2667:

Break it down: (2000 + 600 + 67)², but maybe easier to compute:

2667 × 2667:

Compute 2667 × 2000 = 5,334,000.

2667 × 600 = 1,600,200.

2667 × 67 = let's compute that.

2667 × 60 = 160,020.

2667 ×7= 18,669.

Total 160,020 +18,669=178,689.

Adding all together: 5,334,000 +1,600,200 =6,934,200 +178,689=7,112,889.

So 2667² =7,112,889.

So S_cap² = 7,112,889 +75,625 =7,188,514.

Square root of 7,188,514. Let me see, 2680² = 7,182,400. 2681² = (2680+1)^2=2680² +2*2680 +1=7,182,400 +5360 +1=7,187,761.

Wait, 2681²=7,187,761. But our sum is 7,188,514. So difference is 7,188,514 -7,187,761=753. So x=2681 + y, where y is small.

(2681 + y)^2 =7,187,761 + 2*2681*y + y² ≈7,187,761 +5362 y.

Set equal to 7,188,514 → 5362 y ≈753 → y≈753/5362≈0.1404.

So S_cap ≈2681.14 kVA, approximately 2681 kVA. But looking at the options, none have exactly that. Let me look again.

Option J: 2667kvars, 2755kVA, 0.103 leading.

Hmm, 2755 is higher than our calculated 2681. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the capacitor's reactive power is larger than the load's because it has to account for the losses. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the capacitor's losses affect the real power, but the reactive power must cancel the load's.

Wait another approach: The total real power after adding the capacitor is P_total =2000 + 275=2275 kW.

The total reactive power must be zero, so Q_cap =2667 kvar leading.

The capacitor's apparent power S_cap =sqrt(275² +2667²)≈ sqrt(75625 +7,112,889)= sqrt(7,188,514)= approx 2681 kVA as before.

So looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J: 2667kvars, 2755kVA, 0.103 leading.

Hmm, the 2755 kVA is a bit higher than our calculated 2681. What's 2755 squared?

2755² = (2700+55)^2 =2700² +2*2700*55 +55²=7,290,000 +297,000 +3,025=7,590,025.

Compare that to our S_cap² of 7,188,514. So 2755 is larger than needed. So perhaps my approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think of the power factor of the capacitor. The capacitor's power factor is its real power over its apparent power. Wait, the capacitor is a source of reactive power, but it also consumes real power (the losses). So the capacitor's power factor is P_loss / S_cap, which would be 275 / S_cap. But since P_loss is consuming real power and Q is leading, the capacitor's power factor is lagging? No, wait: in normal operation, a capacitor supplies leading reactive power, but if it has losses, it's consuming real power, so the overall power factor is leading or lagging?

Wait, for the capacitor, Q is positive (leading), P is positive (since it's consuming real power as loss). So the power factor angle phi is arctan(Q/P). So phi = arctan(2667/275). Let me compute that.

2667 /275 is approximately 9.7. So arctan(9.7) is around 84 degrees. So the power factor is cos(84) ≈ 0.1045, which is leading.

So the capacitor's power factor is about 0.1045 leading. So looking at the options, which one has 2667 kvars, around 2681 kVA, and pf around 0.104.

Looking at the options:

Option J: 2667kvars, 2755kVA, 0.103 leading.

Hmm, the kVA is 2755, which is higher than our calculated 2681. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Alternatively, maybe I didn't account for something else.

Wait, perhaps the capacitor's kvar is not exactly equal to the load's because the losses affect the real power, which changes the apparent power. Or maybe the total system's apparent power is S_total = P_total / pf = 2275 / 1 = 2275 kVA.

But the total apparent power is also the vector sum of the load's and the capacitor's.

Wait, the load's S1 is 3333.33 kVA, and the capacitor's S2 is sqrt(275² + Q2²). But the total S is 2275 kVA. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the options don't have the exact calculated value, but perhaps I made a mistake in the load's Q. Let me double-check the original Q.

Given P = 2000 kW, pf =0.6. So S = 2000 /0.6 ≈3333.33 kVA. Then Q = sqrt(S² - P²) = sqrt(3333.33² -2000²) = sqrt(11,111,111 -4,000,000) = sqrt(7,111,111) ≈2666.67 kvar. So that's correct.

Now, for the capacitor, Q_cap must be 2666.67 leading to cancel the load's Q. So Q_cap =2666.67.

Capacitor's real power is 275 kW (losses). So the capacitor's apparent power S_cap = sqrt(275² +2666.67²) = sqrt(75625 +7,111,111.11) = sqrt(7,186,736.11) ≈2680.6 kVA.

So approximately 2681 kVA, and power factor is 275/2680.6 ≈0.1026, so about 0.103 leading.

Looking at the options, option J says 2667kvars, 2755kVA, 0.103 leading. The kvar matches, but the kVA is higher than our calculation. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate S_cap.

Compute 275^2 =75625.

2667^2=7,112,889.

Sum is 75625 +7,112,889=7,188,514.

Square root: 2680.95 kVA. So approximately 2681 kVA.

But option J's kVA is 2755, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I assumed Q_cap is exactly 2667 kvar, but perhaps due to the losses, the required Q is slightly higher. Maybe I need to model the system more accurately.

Wait, the total real power is 2000 +275=2275 kW.

The total reactive power is zero.

The system's apparent power S_total = 2275 kVA, since pf=1.

But the sum of the load's apparent power and the capacitor's apparent power isn't simply additive because they're vectors. So perhaps I should model the system as:

S_total² = (S_load + S_cap) in vector terms, but it's probably better to think in terms of real and reactive components.

Wait, considering that the load has S1 =3333.33 kVA, P1=2000, Q1=2667 (lagging).

The capacitor has S2, P2=275 (real, as loss), Q2=2667 (leading).

So the total real power P_total =2000 +275=2275 kW.

The total reactive power Q_total=2667 (load's Q) -2667 (capacitor's Q) =0.

So the total apparent power S_total = sqrt( (2275)^2 +0^2 )=2275 kVA.

But the total apparent power should also be the vector sum of the load and capacitor's apparent powers. So:

S_total² = (S1² + S2² + 2 * S1 * S2 * cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between them.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that approach. Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the squares minus twice the product times cos(theta_diff) would give the square of the resultant.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the capacitor's kvar is 2667, and its kVA is sqrt(275² +2667²)≈2681, leading to a pf of 275/2681≈0.1026, which is approximately 0.103.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 2667kvars, 2755kVA, 0.103 leading.

But wait, why is the kVA 2755? That's 74 kVA higher than our calculation. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(275^2 +2667^2) more accurately.

Compute 275^2: 75625.

2667^2: 2667 *2667.

Let me compute 2667*2667 step by step:

2667 × 2000 = 5,334,000.

2667 × 600 = 1,600,200.

2667 ×67: let's compute 2667 ×
