Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about steel and some gas mixtures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the activity of carbon in the steel and the equilibrium volume percentages of a CO and CO2 mixture. The steel has 0.7 weight-percent carbon, and it's in equilibrium with a methane-hydrogen gas mixture that's 99% H2 and 1% CH4 by volume. The conditions are 1173 K and 1 atm.

Alright, let's look at the data provided. There are two reactions given with their standard Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG°):

1. C(s, graphite) + 2 H2(g) ⇌ CH4(g), ΔG° = -21,600 + 26.2T cal.
2. CO2(g) + C(s, graphite) ⇌ 2 CO(g), ΔG° = 40,800 - 41.7T cal.

I think the first reaction is for the methane-hydrogen system, and the second is for the CO-CO2 system. So, I'll probably need to use both reactions to find the two parts of the question.

Starting with the first reaction because it involves the given gas mixture. The activity of carbon in the steel is what we're after. Let's call this activity a_C. Since the steel is in equilibrium with the methane and hydrogen, the reaction quotient Q should be equal to the equilibrium constant K.

The reaction is C + 2 H2 ⇌ CH4. The equilibrium expression for K is:

K = (P_CH4) / (P_H2^2 * a_C)

Wait, because the activity of pure graphite is 1, but in the steel, carbon is dissolved and has an activity less than 1. So, a_C is the activity we need to find.

The gas mixture is 99% H2 and 1% CH4. Since it's at 1 atm, the partial pressures are same as their volume percentages. So P_H2 = 0.99 atm, P_CH4 = 0.01 atm.

So plugging into K:

K = (0.01) / ( (0.99)^2 * a_C )

But wait, I need to calculate K first. The ΔG° for the reaction is given as -21,600 + 26.2T cal. Since T is 1173 K, plugging that in:

ΔG° = -21600 + 26.2 * 1173. Let me calculate that.

26.2 * 1000 is 26200, 26.2 * 173 is approx 26.2 *170=4440 + 26.2*3=78.6 → 4518.6. So total is 26200 +4518.6=30718.6 → 30,718.6 cal. So ΔG° = -21600 + 30718.6 = 9118.6 cal. Wait, no—wait a second, no, because the T is in Kelvin, but the calculation uses it directly. So 26.2 * 1173 = let me compute exactly.

26 * 1173 = let's see, 25*1173=29,325; 1*1173=1,173 → total 30,498. Then 0.2 *1173=234.6. So total 30,498 + 234.6=30732.6. So ΔG° = -21,600 + 30,732.6 = 9,132.6 cal. So ΔG° is positive 9,132.6 cal.

Wait, but ΔG° is used in the equation ΔG° = -RT ln K. So rearranging to find K:

ln K = -ΔG° / (RT)

But wait, R is the gas constant. Usually, R is 1.987 cal/mol·K. So T is 1173 K.

So ln K = -(9132.6 cal) / (1.987 * 1173). Let me compute the denominator first.

1.987 * 1000 = 1987. 1.987 * 173 = let's see. 1.987 *170=337.79, 1.987*3=5.961 → 337.79+5.961=343.75. So total denominator is 1987 +343.75=2330.75 cal/mol.

So ln K = -9132.6 / 2330.75 ≈ let's compute:

Divide 9132.6 by 2330.75. 2330.75 *3=6992.25. 2330.75 *3.9= 2330.75*3=6992.25, 2330.75*0.9=2097.68 → total 9089.93. 9132.6 -9089.93≈42.67. So 3.9 + (42.67/2330.75)≈3.9 + 0.0183≈3.9183.

So ln K ≈ -3.9183 → K = e^(-3.9183) ≈ e^-3.9 ≈ around 0.015. Let me compute it more accurately.

e^3.9 is about 50.5 (since e^3=20.085, e^4=54.598; 3.9 is closer to 4, so say 50.5). So e^-3.9 is 1/50.5≈0.0198. So K≈0.0198.

Wait a second, but earlier I thought K was (0.01)/(0.99² a_C) → K= (0.01)/(0.9801 a_C) → 0.01/(0.9801 a_C) ≈ 0.0102/a_C.

We have K≈0.0198, so 0.0102/a_C =0.0198 → a_C=0.0102/0.0198 ≈ 0.515. So around 0.515. Hmm, looking at the options, option E is 0.51, option A is 0.47, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the K right? Because the reaction is forming CH4, so K is [CH4]/([H2]^2 [C]). Wait, but in my calculation, I used the equation correctly.

So a_C is approximately 0.51. So looking at the options, E is activity 0.51. Now, the first part of the question is the activity, so E's first part matches. But wait, let's double-check the K calculation because that's a crucial step.

Wait, let me recalculate ΔG°. The original data for reaction 1 is ΔG° = -21,600 + 26.2 T. At T=1173 K, so 26.2 *1173 = Let me compute 26 * 1173 = 30,498, 0.2*1173=234.6 → total 30,732.6 cal. So ΔG° = -21,600 +30,732.6 = 9,132.6 cal. Correct.

Then, ln K = -ΔG°/(RT) = -9132.6 / (1.987*1173).

Compute denominator: 1.987 *1173 → let me compute 2000 *1.987 is 3974, but 1173 is 2000 - 827. So 1.987 * 1173 = 1.987*(1000 + 173) = 1.987*1000 + 1.987*173.

1.987*1000=1987. 1.987 *173: 1.987 *170= 338.  1.987 *3=5.961 → 338 +5.961=343.961. So total is 1987 +343.961=2330.961 cal/(mol·K) * K → cal/mol.

So ln K = -9132.6 / 2330.961 → 9132.6 / 2330.961 ≈ let's divide 9132.6 by 2330.961.

2330.961 *3 = 6992.883 → 9132.6-6992.883=2139.717.

Now, 2330.961 → 2330.961 *0.9=2097.865 → 2139.717 -2097.865=41.852.

So 3.9 + (41.852 /2330.961) → 3.9 + approx 0.01796 → 3.91796.

So ln K ≈ -3.91796 → K = e^(-3.91796) → let me compute that. e^3.91796 ≈ e^3 is 20.085, e^0.91796 is approx e^0.9=2.4596, e^0.01796≈1.0182 → 2.4596 *1.0182≈2.504. So e^3.91796≈20.085 *2.504 ≈ 50.34. So K=1/50.34≈0.01986.

So K ≈ 0.01986.

Now, plugging into K expression:

K = P_CH4/(P_H2^2 a_C) → 0.01986 = 0.01/( (0.99)^2 a_C )

Compute 0.99 squared: 0.9801.

So 0.01986 = 0.01/(0.9801 a_C) → 0.01986 = (0.010203)/(a_C).

Wait, because 0.01 /0.9801 = 0.010203.

So 0.01986 = 0.010203 / a_C → a_C = 0.010203 / 0.01986 → let's compute that.

0.010203 ÷ 0.01986 → approximately 0.514.

So a_C ≈ 0.514. Looking at the options, option E is 0.51, which is very close. So the activity of carbon is approximately 0.51, which suggests the first part of the answer is option E.

Now, the second part is finding the equilibrium volume percentages of CO and CO2 in a CO-CO2 mixture that's in equilibrium with the steel under the same conditions.

The second reaction is CO2(g) + C(s) ⇌ 2 CO(g). The ΔG° for this reaction is 40,800 -41.7 T cal.

We'll need to find the equilibrium constant for this reaction, then find the ratio of CO to CO2.

So, first calculate K for the second reaction.

ΔG° = 40,800 -41.7 * 1173 → let's compute 41.7 *1173.

41 *1000=41,000. 41*173=41*(170+3)= 41*170=6970 + 41*3=123 → 7093. So 41.7 *1000=41,700. 41.7*173: 0.7 *173=121.1; 41*173=7093. So 41.7 *173=7093 + 121.1=7214.1.

So 41.7 *1173 = 41,700 + 7,214.1 = 48,914.1 cal.

So ΔG° = 40,800 -48,914.1 = -8,114.1 cal.

So ΔG° is -8,114.1 cal. Now, using ΔG° = -RT ln K → ln K = -ΔG°/(RT) → but wait, wait, the formula is ΔG° = -RT ln K → so ln K = -ΔG°/(RT).

Wait no, ΔG° is negative, so ln K = - (ΔG°)/(RT) → but since ΔG° is negative, it'll be positive.

So ΔG° = -8,114.1 cal → ln K = (8,114.1) / (1.987 * 1173).

Compute denominator again: 1.987 *1173 = 2330.961 cal/mol.

So ln K = 8,114.1 / 2330.961 ≈ let's compute.

2330.961 *3=6992.883 → 8,114.1-7,000=1,114.1? Wait, 8,114.1 is 8,000 + 114.1.

Wait, 2330.961 * 3 is 6,992.883. Subtracting from 8,114.1: 8,114.1 -6,992.883 =1,121.217.

Now, 2330.961 *0.48 → 0.4*2330.961=932.38; 0.08*2330.961≈186.477; total ≈ 1,118.86. Close to 1,121.217.

So 3.48 → 3 +0.48.

So ln K ≈3.48 → K = e^3.48 ≈ ?

e^3 is 20.0855, e^0.48 → e^0.4=1.4918, e^0.08=1.0833 → approx 1.4918 *1.0833≈1.616. So e^3.48 ≈20.0855 *1.616≈32.44.

So K≈32.44.

Now, the reaction is CO2 + C ⇌ 2 CO.

The equilibrium expression is K = (P_CO^2) / (P_CO2 * a_C).

We know a_C is approximately 0.514 from the first part. So plugging in:

32.44 = (P_CO^2) / (P_CO2 * 0.514).

We can assume that the total pressure is 1 atm, and let’s let the volume percentages be x for CO and (1-x) for CO2. But since the reaction is 2 moles of CO produced for each mole of CO2 consumed, the changes would be in a certain ratio. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express in terms of partial pressures.

But perhaps it's easier to assume that the total pressure is 1 atm, so P_total = P_CO + P_CO2 =1 atm.

Let me define P_CO = p, P_CO2 = q.

So p + q =1 atm.

The expression for K is:

K = (p^2) / (q * a_C).

We have K=32.44, a_C=0.514.

So,

32.44 = (p^2) / (q * 0.514).

And p + q =1 → q=1-p.

Substituting:

32.44 = (p^2) / ( (1-p) * 0.514 )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

32.44 * (1-p) * 0.514 = p^2.

Compute 32.44 *0.514 → let's see, 32 *0.5=16, 0.44*0.5=0.22 → approx 16.22. But more accurately:

32.44 * 0.514 = ?

32 *0.5=16, 32 *0.014=0.448 → 16.448.

0.44 *0.5=0.22, 0.44 *0.014=0.00616 → 0.22616.

So total approx 16.448 +0.226=16.674.

So 16.674 * (1-p) = p^2.

Expanding:

16.674 -16.674 p = p^2.

Rearranging:

p^2 +16.674 p -16.674 =0.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, from 16.674(1-p)=p² → 16.674 -16.674 p =p² → p² +16.674 p -16.674 =0.

Wait, that would give a positive solution, but let's compute using quadratic formula.

Quadratic equation: p² +16.674 p -16.674 =0.

Using quadratic formula, p = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ]/(2a). Here a=1, b=16.674, c=-16.674.

Discriminant D= (16.674)^2 -4*1*(-16.674) = 16.674^2 +4*16.674.

16.674^2 → approx (16.67)^2 = (250/15)^2 → Well, 16.67^2 = 278. (Because 16^2=256, 17^2=289, 16.67 is 1/6 of the way from 16 to17, so 256 + (2*16 +1)*(1/6) ) → no, perhaps better to compute 16.674 *16.674:

16 *16=256.

16 *0.674=10.784 → 0.674*16=10.784.

0.674 *16= same.

0.674 * 0.674≈0.454.

So 16.674^2 = (16 +0.674)^2 = 16² + 2*16*0.674 +0.674² =256 +21.616 + 0.454≈278.07.

So D= 278.07 +4*16.674 →4*16.674=66.696 → D=278.07 +66.696≈344.766.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(344.766) ≈ 18.57.

So p = [ -16.674 ±18.57 ] /2. We take positive root.

( -16.674 +18.57 ) /2 → (1.896)/2=0.948.

So p≈0.948 atm. So P_CO ≈0.948 atm, which is 94.8% by volume. P_CO2 is 1 -0.948=0.052 atm, which is 5.2% by volume.

Looking at the options, option E says 94.6% CO and 5.4% CO2. Hmmm, our calculation gives 94.8% CO and 5.2% CO2. Close, but not exactly matching. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I approximated too much. Let me recompute the K for the second reaction more accurately.

ΔG° for reaction 2 is 40,800 -41.7 T cal. T=1173 K.

Compute 41.7 *1173:
