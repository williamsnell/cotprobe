Okay, so I've got this question here about organizational structures and their features. The question is asking which structure specializes. The options are A through J, each representing a different structure. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that organizational structures determine how tasks, responsibilities, and authority are allocated. Different structures have different characteristics. I'm a bit fuzzy on all the details, but I'll try to recall.

The question is about specialization. Specialization refers to how employees are grouped based on their specific skills or expertise. So, the structure that emphasizes this would be one where people work in departments according to their functions.

Looking at the options, option C is Functional. I think functional structure organizes employees by their functions or expertise. Like marketing, finance, HR each as separate departments. That makes sense because each group specializes in their area.

Let me go through the other options to make sure. Option A is Hierarchical. That's more about layers of management and chains of command. Not directly about specialization.

Option B is Network. I believe network structures involve a lot of outsourcing and partnerships, relying on external resources. Not sure about specialization being the key here.

Option D is Flat. Flat structures have fewer levels of management, which affects communication and decision-making but not necessarily the specialization aspect.

Option E is Decentralized. This is about decision-making being spread out rather than centralized. Doesn't directly tie to specialization.

Option F is Divisional. Divisional structures are based on products or markets. Each division handles a specific product line or market. While there's some specialization, it's more about dividing the company into self-contained units rather than functional expertise.

Option G is Matrix. Matrix structures combine functional and project-based teams. Employees report to both functional managers and project managers. This is more about dual reporting than specialization per se.

Option H is Horizontal. Not too familiar, but I think it's similar to flat structures, focusing on lateral communication rather than hierarchy.

Option I is Multi-divisional. This is similar to divisional but on a larger scale, maybe with more divisions. Again, it's about dividing based on products or regions, not functional expertise.

Option J is Centralized. This is about decision-making being concentrated at the top. Doesn't directly relate to how employees are grouped based on skills.

Wait, so functional structure (option C) is the one where employees are grouped by their functions. That makes each department a specialized unit. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: Functional. Functional organizational structures group employees based on their specific skills or expertise, making specialization a key feature.

Answer: C
