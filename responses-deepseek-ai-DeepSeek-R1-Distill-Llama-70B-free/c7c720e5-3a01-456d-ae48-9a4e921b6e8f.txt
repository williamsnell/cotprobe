Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about heat loss through an insulated steel tube. Hmm, right, I remember that heat transfer through cylindrical walls involves some specific calculations. Let me think about what I learned.

The tube is 12 feet long, which I guess is the length we'll use. The diameter is 4 inches, so the radius would be half of that, which is 2 inches. But wait, the insulation is 1 inch thick, so that would mean the outer radius is bigger than the inner radius. Oh right, the inner radius of the insulation would be the same as the tube's radius, and the outer radius is inner radius plus the insulation thickness.

Wait, let me get this straight. The tube itself has a diameter of 4 inches, so radius r1 is 2 inches. The insulation is 1 inch thick, so the outer radius r2 is 3 inches. But wait, units—since the length is in feet, maybe I should convert inches to feet. Oh right, because the formula uses feet units for everything.

So converting inches to feet: 1 inch is 1/12 feet. So r1 is 2/12 = 1/6 feet, and r2 is 3/12 = 1/4 feet. Got it.

The thermal conductivity k is given as 0.05 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The temperatures are 500°F inner surface and 100°F outer surface. So the temperature difference ΔT is 500 - 100 = 400°F.

I think the formula for the radial heat loss in a cylindrical insulation is Q = (2πkLΔT) / ln(r2/r1). Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the formula is Q = (2πkL (T_in - T_out)) / ln(r2/r1). Because for cylinders, it's the natural log of the radius ratio.

So plugging in the numbers: k is 0.05, L is 12 ft. ΔT is 400°F. r2 is 0.25 ft, r1 is 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 ft.

So let me compute the denominator first: ln(r2/r1) = ln((0.25)/(1/6)) = ln(1.5) because 0.25 divided by (1/6) is 1.5. Wait, 0.25 is 1/4, and 1/6 is approximately 0.1667. So 1/4 divided by 1/6 is (1/4)*(6/1) )= 6/4 = 1.5. So ln(1.5) is approximately 0.4055. I remember that ln(1)=0, ln(e)=1, so ln(1.5) is about 0.405.

Then, the numerator is 2 * π * 0.05 * 12 * 400. Let me calculate that:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832

6.2832 * 0.05 = 0.31416

0.31416 * 12 = let's see, 0.31416 *10 is 3.1416, plus 0.31416*2=0.62832. So total 3.1416 + 0.62832 = 3.76992.

Then multiply by 400: 3.76992 *400 = 1,507.968.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Oh wait, the numerator is 2πkLΔT, which is 2 * π * 0.05 * 12 * 400.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

2π ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 0.05 = 0.31416.

0.31416 * 12 = 3.76992.

3.76992 * 400 = 3.76992 *4 = 15.07968, and then multiply by 100, so 1,507.968 Btu/hr.

Wait, but then we have to divide that by the ln(r2/r1), which is 0.4055.

So Q = 1507.968 / 0.4055 ≈ let me compute that.

Dividing 1508 by 0.4055. Let's see, 0.4055 * 3700 = 0.4055 * 3000=1216.5, 0.4055 * 700=283.85 → total 1500.35. Close to 1508.

Wait, 0.4055 * 3720 = ?

Let me compute 0.4055 *3720. 0.4055 *3000=1216.5, 0.4055*720= (0.4055*700=283.85, 0.4055*20=8.11) → 283.85+8.11=291.96. So total 1216.5 + 291.96=1508.46. Oh, that's really close to 1507.968.

So Q ≈ 3720 Btu/hr? But wait, that's one of the options, option J.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps in case I messed up somewhere.

Wait, the formula is Q = (2πkL (T1 - T2)) / ln(r2/r1). Oh wait, wait, T1 is the inner surface temperature, T2 is outer. So yes, T1-T2 is 400, correct.

r2 is the outer radius, which is 3 inches = 0.25 ft.

r1 is inner radius of insulation, which is 2 inches = 1/6 ft ≈ 0.1666667 ft.

So the ratio r2/r1 is (0.25)/(1/6) = 1.5. So ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So the calculation: numerator is (2π * 0.05 * 12 * 400) = numerator = 2 * π * 0.05 * 12 * 400.

Wait, let me compute this again:

2 * π = 6.2832.

6.2832 * 0.05 = 0.31416.

0.31416 * 12 = 3.76992.

3.76992 *400 = 1507.968.

Then divide by ln(1.5)=0.4055.

1507.968 / 0.4055 ≈ 3720.

So the answer would be option J: 3720 Btu/hr.

But let me check the options again. The options are:

A:4400

B:1500

C:5000

D:4100

E:2200

F:3350

G:2500

H:2900

I:3150

J:3720

So option J is 3720, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but let me think once more. Did I mix up r1 and r2? Because sometimes I get confused which is which. The formula is ln(r2/r1), right? So if the inner radius is smaller than the outer, the ratio is greater than 1, so the ln is positive.

Yes, so I think the calculation is correct. So the answer should be J.

To determine the radial rate of heat loss over the total length of the insulated steel tube, we use the formula for heat transfer through cylindrical walls:

\[
Q = \frac{2 \pi k L \Delta T}{\ln\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)}
\]

### Given Data:
- **Length of the tube**: \( L = 12 \, \text{ft} \)
- **Inner radius of insulation**: \( r_1 = \frac{2}{12} = 0.1667 \, \text{ft} \)
- **Outer radius of insulation**: \( r_2 = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25 \, \text{ft} \)
- **Thermal conductivity**: \( k = 0.05 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-°F} \)
- **Temperature difference**: \( \Delta T = T_{\text{inner}} - T_{\text{outer}} = 500 - 100 = 400 \, \text{°F} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the natural logarithm of the radius ratio
\[
\ln\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{0.25}{0.1667}\right) = \ln(1.5) \approx 0.4055
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the numerator
\[
2 \pi k L \Delta T = 2 \cdot \pi \cdot 0.05 \cdot 12 \cdot 400
\]
\[
2 \pi \approx 6.2832, \quad 6.2832 \cdot 0.05 = 0.31416, \quad 0.31416 \cdot 12 = 3.76992, \quad 3.76992 \cdot 400 = 1507.968
\]

### Step 3: Divide the numerator by the logarithm
\[
Q = \frac{1507.968}{0.4055} \approx 3720 \, \text{Btu/hr}
\]

### Final Answer:
The radial rate of heat loss over the total length of the rod is approximately **3720 Btu/hr**, which corresponds to **option J**.
