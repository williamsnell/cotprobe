Okay, so I've got this accounting question about cash flow statements and how different investments are classified. Hmm, I remember from my studies that companies can classify their investments in different categories, and each category affects the financial statements differently, especially the cash flow statement.

The question is about Verity Co. They bought two types of securities: $200,000 of Otra Co. bonds at par, which they classified as available-for-sale, and $50,000 of U.S. Treasury bills, classified as cash equivalents. The question is asking what amount Verity should report as net cash used in investing activities in their statement of cash flows.

Wait, so I need to figure out how these purchases are treated in terms of cash flows. Let me think. 

First, available-for-sale securities. I recall that when a company purchases available-for-sale securities, the cash outflow is considered an investing activity. So the $200,000 spent on Otra bonds would be reported under investing activities as a cash outflow.

Now, the Treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are treated similarly to cash; they're liquid, short-term investments. Purchases of cash equivalents are not reported on the cash flow statement because they're part of the cash and cash equivalents line. So when you buy or sell cash equivalents, it's not shown as an investing activity. Instead, it's considered part of the company's cash management and is included in the net change in cash.

So the $50,000 purchase of Treasury bills doesn't affect the investing activities section because it's a cash equivalent. Therefore, only the $200,000 for the Otra bonds is relevant here.

Wait, but waitâ€”sometimes there's a nuance. For example, when you sell a cash equivalent, does it affect cash flow? Or is it just that the purchase doesn't show up as a cash flow from investing because it's part of cash. Let me think again. Cash and cash equivalents are combined for the statement of cash flows. So when a company buys a cash equivalent, it's just moving money within the cash and cash equivalents account, so it doesn't get reported as an investing activity. Similarly, selling a cash equivalent would adjust the overall cash balance but not be an investing or financing activity.

So in this case, since the Treasury bills are cash equivalents, buying them doesn't count as an outflow in investing activities. Only the Otra bonds count. So the net cash used in investing activities is $200,000.

Looking back at the options, option D is $200,000. Option H is 250000 but without the comma, maybe a typo, but perhaps it's the same as A: $250,000. No, wait, the options are A to J, with H being 250000, but I think the correct answer is D: $200,000.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. So in the statement of cash flows, investing activities include purchases of long-term assets and investments, like available-for-sale securities. Cash equivalents are not considered investing activities. So yes, only the $200,000 is reported as cash used in investing activities.

In the statement of cash flows, investing activities include cash outflows for purchases of long-term assets or investments, such as available-for-sale securities. Cash equivalents, however, are treated as part of cash and cash equivalents, and their purchase or sale does not appear in the investing activities section.

Verity Co. purchased $200,000 of Otra Co. bonds classified as available-for-sale securities, which is an investing activity. The $50,000 purchase of U.S. Treasury bills, classified as cash equivalents, does not qualify as an investing activity. Therefore, only the $200,000 spent on the Otra bonds is reported as net cash used in investing activities.

The correct answer is:

D: $200,000

Answer: D
