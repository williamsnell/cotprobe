Okay, so I have this physics problem here about magnetic flux in a bar. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: A bar with a cross-sectional area of 6 square centimeters and a permeability of 1000 units is placed in a magnetic field of intensity 5 oersteds. I need to find the total number of lines of magnetic flux in the iron.

Wait, wait. I remember that magnetic flux is related to the magnetic field, area, and permeability. But wait, isn't the formula Φ = B * A * μ? Or is it something else? Oh wait, no, wait. Oh right, the magnetic flux Φ is given by Φ = B * A * μ, where B is the magnetic field strength, A is the area, and μ is the permeability.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, sometimes I get confused between the formulas for flux and for flux density. Oh right, flux density B is in tesla (or gauss), and flux Φ is in webers. But in this problem, they're giving the permeability, so I think I need to use Φ = B * A * μ. Or is there a different formula when permeability is involved?

Wait, another thought: Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Oh right, the magnetic flux Φ is equal to the product of the magnetic flux density B and the area A. But wait, what is B in terms of H and μ? Oh right, B = μ * H, where H is the magnetic field strength (in oersteds), and μ is the permeability. So putting it all together, Φ = B * A = (μ * H) * A. So Φ = μ * H * A.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the units to make sure. H is in oersteds, μ is in some unit, area is in cm². Let's see. Oh wait, in the cgs system, the unit of B (in gauss) is equal to oersteds multiplied by the permeability (unit is in G/Oe). Oh right, because B = μ H.

So in this problem, the H is given as 5 oersteds. The permeability μ is 1000 units. Area is 6 cm². So the flux Φ would be μ * H * A.

So plugging the numbers: μ is 1000, H is 5, A is 6. So 1000 * 5 = 5000, multiplied by 6 gives 30,000. So Φ = 30,000 lines of flux.

Wait, but what are the units here? Because in cgs units, flux Φ is measured in maxwells, but each line of flux is a maxwell. So the total number of lines would be 30,000 maxwells.

Looking at the options, option J is 30,000 lines of flux. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, another way: If H = 5 Oe, μ = 1000, so B = 5 * 1000 = 5000 G. Then Φ = B * A = 5000 G * 6 cm². Since 1 Wb = 1 G·cm², so Φ = 5000 *6 = 30,000. So yeah, same result.

So the correct answer is J.

To determine the total number of lines of magnetic flux in the bar, we use the formula for magnetic flux:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A
\]

where \( B \) is the magnetic flux density and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area. The magnetic flux density \( B \) is related to the magnetic field intensity \( H \) and the permeability \( \mu \) by:

\[
B = \mu \cdot H
\]

Substituting \( B = \mu \cdot H \) into the flux equation gives:

\[
\Phi = \mu \cdot H \cdot A
\]

Given:
- \( \mu = 1000 \, \text{units} \),
- \( H = 5 \, \text{oersteds} \),
- \( A = 6 \, \text{cm}^2 \),

we calculate:

\[
\Phi = 1000 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 30,000 \, \text{lines of flux}.
\]

Thus, the total number of lines of magnetic flux in the bar is **30,000**.

The correct answer is **J**.
