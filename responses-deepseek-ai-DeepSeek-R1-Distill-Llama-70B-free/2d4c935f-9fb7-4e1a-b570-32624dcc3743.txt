Question:

The police received a report that women dressed as superheroes had robbed a man in his house and stolen many of his valuables. The only way onto or off the island where he lived was a ferry. The last ferry was getting ready to leave for the night when the report came in to the police. Without attempting to get a warrant, the police stopped all the cars waiting for the ferry. In one vehicle, the police noticed three women fidgeting rather nervously. Upon searching their auto, the police found the victim's stolen property hidden under the front seat. The defendants were immediately placed under arrest. At their trial for armed robbery, the defendants move to suppress the use of the property confiscated by the police as evidence. Their motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the police did not have specific evidence linking the women to the crime before searching their car.
B: denied, because the police had probable cause to search their car and, under the circumstances, no warrant was required.
C: granted, because the police violated the women's Fourth Amendment rights by searching their car without a warrant.
D: denied, because the police had the right to search any vehicle in the vicinity of a reported crime.
E: denied, because the situation constituted an exception to the warrant requirement due to exigent circumstances.
F: granted, because the police did not have a warrant and also did not have reasonable suspicion to search their car.
G: granted, because the police did not have a warrant to search their car.
H: denied, because the police had the right to stop and search vehicles at the ferry terminal due to the public safety risk.
I: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to suspect that their car contained evidence of the crime.
J: denied, because even though the detention was unlawful, the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that their car contained evidence of the crime since they observed the women fidgeting nervously.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the police's actions were lawful, which affects whether the evidence can be used in court. Let's break it down step by step.

The situation is that a man was robbed by women dressed as superheroes. The only way off the island is by ferry, and the last ferry is about to leave. The police get the report and stop all cars waiting for the ferry without getting a warrant. In one car, they see three women fidgeting nervously, search the car, find stolen property, and arrest them.

The defendants are moving to suppress the evidence, meaning they don't want the stolen property used against them. The question is whether their motion should be granted or denied.

I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Generally, the police need a warrant to search, but there are exceptions. One big exception is when there's probable cause and exigent circumstances, meaning they can't get a warrant in time without risking the destruction of evidence or something like that.

So, looking at the facts: the police stopped all cars because the ferry was the only way off the island, and the robbery was just reported. They didn't have a warrant. They noticed the women were nervous, then searched the car and found the stolen goods.

Wait, but stopping the cars—does that require reasonable suspicion? In this case, the police had a report of a robbery and the only exit is the ferry, so stopping all cars might be a bit broad. But maybe the situation is urgent enough to justify it without individualized suspicion. I'm not too sure about that part.

But let's focus on the search of the car. The police saw the women fidgeting. Is that enough for probable cause? Probable cause requires more than a hunch; it needs specific, articulable facts. Nervousness alone might not be enough, but in the context of a recent robbery and the suspects' matching the description (dressed as superheroes), maybe it adds up.

But wait, the police didn't have a warrant. So the search would need to fall under an exception. One exception is a search incident to arrest, but that doesn't apply here because they weren't arrested yet. Another is probable cause with exigent circumstances. Exigent circumstances might apply if the police believed evidence was about to be destroyed or that the suspects would flee, especially since the ferry was about to leave. Plus, the car was about to leave the island, making it difficult to get a warrant in time.

Alternatively, the automobile exception says that if police have probable cause to believe a car contains evidence, they can search it without a warrant. So, if the police had probable cause, they could search the car under this exception.

So, putting it together: The police had a report of a robbery, the suspects were described as women dressed as superheroes, and the only way off was the ferry that was about to leave. They stopped the car, observed nervous behavior, which might contribute to probable cause. The situation is time-sensitive because the ferry is leaving, so exigent circumstances might apply.

Wait, but the women's nervousness—does that add to probable cause? Maybe. The fact that they were on the ferry line after a robbery was reported, the description matched (if the women were dressed as superheroes), and their nervous behavior could give the police probable cause. So under the automobile exception, they can search without a warrant.

Therefore, the police might have had probable cause and exigent circumstances, so the search was legal, and the evidence shouldn't be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the motion should be denied because police had probable cause and no warrant was needed. Option E says denied due to exigent circumstances exception. Option I says granted because no probable cause.

I think the key is whether probable cause existed. If the police had probable cause based on the situation, then the search under the automobile exception is valid. So the answer would be B or E. 

Wait, but the automobile exception doesn't require exigent circumstances necessarily—it just requires probable cause. Exigent circumstances are another exception. So if they had probable cause, they can search the car under the automobile exception without a warrant. So the correct reasoning would be that they had probable cause, making option B correct.

Alternatively, if the situation was that they couldn't get a warrant in time (exigent circumstances), then E would apply. But the automobile exception is more about the mobility of the vehicle, which is a form of exigent circumstance.

Hmm, maybe both apply. But the primary reason here is the automobile exception—probable cause to search the car without a warrant. So the answer is B: denied because probable cause and no warrant needed.

Wait, but in the scenario, the police stopped all cars without a warrant. Does stopping the cars require reasonable suspicion? Or is that a separate issue? The question is about the search, not the stop. So the stop might be a separate issue, but the question is about the suppression of the evidence found in the search.

So focusing on the search: probable cause to search the car? If yes, then the search is okay under the automobile exception.

I think the correct answer is B: denied, because the police had probable cause to search their car and no warrant was required.

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, generally requiring a warrant. However, exceptions exist, such as the automobile exception, which allows police to search a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe it contains evidence of a crime. In this case, the police received a report of a robbery by women dressed as superheroes, and the only exit from the island was via a ferry about to depart. The police stopped all cars, including the defendants', and observed the women fidgeting nervously. Given the time-sensitive nature of the situation and the matching description of the suspects, the police likely had probable cause to search the vehicle under the automobile exception. Additionally, the urgency of the ferry's departure could be considered exigent circumstances, further justifying the warrantless search. Therefore, the defendants' motion to suppress the evidence should be denied.
