Okay, so I've got this question about SCRs, which I remember stands for Silicon-Controlled Rectifiers. The question is asking about the latching current and the holding current. Hmm, I need to figure out what each of these terms means.

Alright, from what I remember in my electronics class, an SCR has some key characteristics. Once it's triggered, it conducts current. There's this thing about latching current and holding current. I think the latching current is the minimum current needed to turn the SCR on and keep it conducting. But wait, isn't the holding current different? Oh right, the holding current is the minimum current needed to keep the SCR conducting once it's already latched.

So the question says the latching current is 20 mA. I'm trying to recall if the holding current is usually lower than the latching current. Because once the SCR is conducting, it doesn't need as much current to stay on. So the holding current should be less than the latching current.

Looking at the options, the latching is 20 mA. The options are A:5, B:23, C:25, D:20, E:30, F:40, G:50, H:10, I:60, J:15. So the possible answers for holding current would be lower than 20 mA. The options that are lower than 20 are A, H, and J. 

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship. I think the holding current is typically around 5-50 mA, but it's usually less than the latching current. So if the latching is 20, the holding is probably lower. So from the options, the only ones below 20 are A (5), H (10), and J (15). 

But I also remember that the holding current is usually in the same range as the latching, maybe a bit lower. So maybe 10-20 mA. Let me think, I've seen examples where the holding current is around 10 mA when the latching is 20. So option H is 10 mA. Or option J is 15.

Wait, another thought. Sometimes the holding current is about half of the latching current. So 20mA latching would mean 10mA holding. So that would point to option H. But I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly half or just a lower value.

Alternatively, I might be mixing things up. Maybe the holding current is the same as the latching current. No, that doesn't make sense because the device needs less current to hold once it's conducting. So D is 20, which is same as the latching, that's probably not it.

So the correct answer would be a value lower than 20. So among the options, A is 5, H is 10, J is 15. Which is it?

I think the holding current is often around 10 mA as a typical value when the latching is 20. So I'm leaning towards option H, 10 mA. But wait, another possibility is that the holding current is a specific fraction. Like, maybe 1/4th or something. So 20mA latching, holding would be 5mA? That would be option A.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to remember. In my notes, I think I wrote that the holding current is less than the latching current, but I don't remember the exact proportion. If the latching is 20, the holding could be about 10 or 15.

Wait, perhaps the question is a standard one. Maybe the holding current is typically half of the latching. So if latching is 20, holding is 10. So answer H.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the options given. The options don't have 12.5, so the closest lower would be 10 or 15.

Wait, I'm not 100% certain, but I think the holding current is usually lower than the latching. So the correct answer would be one of the lower values.

Wait, another approach. The latching current is the minimum current needed to trigger the SCR into conduction. Once it's conducting, the holding current is the minimum needed to maintain that conduction. So the holding current is lower than the latching.

So the question gives latching as 20 mA. The holding current must be less than 20. So from the options, possible answers are A, H, J.

But which one? Since the problem doesn't give more context, maybe I should think about typical values. For an SCR, I think the holding current is often in the 5-20 mA range. So 10 mA is a common value.

So I think the answer is H:10 mA.

The question asks about the holding current of an SCR when the latching current is given as 20 mA. The latching current is the minimum current required to trigger the SCR into conduction, while the holding current is the minimum current needed to maintain conduction once the SCR is latched. Typically, the holding current is less than the latching current.

Given the options, the holding current must be lower than 20 mA. The possible values are 5 mA (A), 10 mA (H), and 15 mA (J). Based on typical values for SCRs, the holding current is often around half of the latching current. Therefore, if the latching current is 20 mA, the holding current is likely 10 mA.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: 10 mA**.
