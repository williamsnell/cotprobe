Question:

The McDougall Company produces and sells two qualities of carpet. The better quality carpeting sells for $6.00 per yard and has variable costs of 70 percent of sales. The other type costs $3.00 per yard and has variable costs of 60 percent of sales. Total fixed costs of both types of carpet combined are $122,200. If both carpets have the same dollar sales, how many yards of each must be sold to earn a profit of $50,000?

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The McDougall Company makes two types of carpet. One is better quality, selling at $6 per yard with variable costs of 70% of sales. The other is cheaper, selling at $3 per yard with variable costs of 60% of sales. The total fixed costs for both are $122,200. The question says that both carpets have the same dollar sales. We need to find out how many yards of each must be sold to make a profit of $50,000.

Hmm, so the key points are:

1. Two products: High quality (HQ) at $6, variable cost 70% of sale. Lower quality (LQ) at $3, variable cost 60% of sale.

2. Fixed costs total $122,200.

3. Dollar sales are the same for both products. So if HQ sales are S dollars, LQ sales are also S dollars.

4. Total profit needs to be $50,000. Profit is total sales minus total variable costs minus fixed costs.

Wait, profit equation is: Profit = (Sales - Variable Costs) - Fixed Costs. Or, Profit = Contribution Margin - Fixed Costs.

Since both products have the same dollar sales, let's call that S for each. So total sales would be 2S.

But wait, actually, each product's sales are S. So the total sales are S (HQ) + S (LQ) = 2S.

But I think the key is that each product's sales in dollars are equal. So for each, S_HQ = S_LQ = S.

Each product's contribution margin (sales minus variable costs) would be:

For HQ: Each yard sells for $6, variable cost is 70% of that, so 0.7*6 = $4.20. So contribution per yard is 6 - 4.2 = $1.80.

For LQ: Each yard sells for $3, variable cost is 60% of 3, which is 0.6*3 = $1.80. So contribution per yard is 3 - 1.8 = $1.20.

Wait, that's interesting. So each yard of HQ gives a $1.80 contribution, and each yard of LQ gives $1.20.

But wait, the dollar sales are the same for each product. So if each product's dollar sales are S, then the number of yards for HQ is S/6, and for LQ is S/3.

Because yards = sales dollars / price per yard.

So total contribution from both products would be:

HQ: (S/6) yards * $1.80 per yard = (S/6)*1.80 = 0.3 S.

LQ: (S/3) yards * $1.20 per yard = (S/3)*1.2 = 0.4 S.

Wait, wait:

(S/6)*1.8 = (1.8/6) S = 0.3 S.

(S/3)*1.2 = (1.2/3) S = 0.4 S.

So total contribution is 0.3 S + 0.4 S = 0.7 S.

Then, total fixed costs are $122,200. Profit is given as $50,000.

So the equation would be:

Total Contribution - Fixed Costs = Profit.

So 0.7 S - 122,200 = 50,000.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Profit is total contribution from both products minus fixed costs.

Yes. So 0.7 S - 122,200 = 50,000.

So 0.7 S = 50,000 + 122,200 = 172,200.

Then, S = 172,200 / 0.7.

Let me compute that: 172200 divided by 0.7.

Hmm, 172200 ÷ 0.7 = 246,000. Because 0.7 times 246,000 is 172,200.

So each product's dollar sales S is $246,000.

So for HQ: each yard is $6, so yards sold are 246,000 / 6 = 41,000 yards.

For LQ: each yard is $3, so yards sold are 246,000 / 3 = 82,000 yards.

Wait, but wait, the answer options don't have 41,000 and 82,000. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 45000 and 75000. Hmm, that's not matching. Option D: 47833(1/3) and 71750. Option E: 50000 and 60000. Option H: 35000 and 70000.

Wait, my calculation gives 41,000 and 82,000, but none of the options have that. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the contribution margins.

Let me recheck the contributions.

HQ: price $6, variable cost 70% of sales. So variable cost per yard is 0.7 * 6 = $4.20. Contribution per yard is 6 - 4.2 = $1.80. Correct.

LQ: price $3, variable cost 60% of 3 = $1.80. So contribution per yard is 3 - 1.8 = $1.20. Correct.

If each product's dollar sales are S, then units sold are S/6 for HQ and S/3 for LQ.

So contribution for HQ: (S/6) * 1.80 = (1.8/6) S = 0.3 S.

Contribution for LQ: (S/3) * 1.20 = (1.2/3) S = 0.4 S.

Total contribution: 0.7 S. That's correct.

Then, 0.7 S = 50,000 + 122,200 = 172,200.

So S = 172,200 / 0.7 = 246,000.

Thus, HQ yards: 246,000 /6 = 41,000 yards.

LQ yards: 246,000 /3 = 82,000 yards.

Hmm, none of the options have 41k and 82k. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read again.

Wait, the problem says both carpets have the same dollar sales. So equal dollar amounts. So each contributes S dollars in sales, so total sales are 2S. But the way I calculated seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the yards sold are the same, but the question says dollar sales are the same. So my approach is correct.

Wait, looking at the answer options, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Let me think differently. Maybe the total profit is equal to the sum of the contributions minus fixed costs. So let's let x be the number of yards for HQ, and y be the yards for LQ.

But the dollar sales for HQ would be 6x, and for LQ would be 3y. Since they are equal, 6x = 3y. So 2x = y. So y = 2x.

So for each x yards of HQ sold, y would be 2x yards of LQ.

Now, the contribution per yard for HQ is 6 - (0.7*6) = 6-4.2 = 1.8.

For LQ, contribution is 3 - (0.6*3) = 3 - 1.8 = 1.2.

So total contribution is 1.8x + 1.2y.

But since y=2x, substitute:

1.8x + 1.2*(2x) = 1.8x + 2.4x = 4.2x.

Total fixed costs are 122,200. Profit is 50,000.

So 4.2x - 122,200 = 50,000.

4.2x = 172,200.

x = 172200 / 4.2.

Compute that: 172200 ÷ 4.2.

Well, 4.2 times 40,000 is 168,000. So 172200 - 168000 = 4200.

4200 /4.2 = 1000. So x=40,000 +1,000=41,000 yards.

So x=41,000 yards of HQ, y=2x=82,000 yards of LQ.

Again, same result as before, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the way fixed costs are considered. Or perhaps the question meant that total sales (in yards) are the same, but that doesn't make sense because the prices are different. The question states same dollar sales.

Wait, could it be that I messed up the calculation for the contribution? Let me double-check.

HQ: price $6, variable cost 70% of 6 is 4.2, so contribution per yard is 1.8. Correct.

LQ: price $3, variable cost 60% of 3 is 1.8, so contribution is 1.2. Correct.

So if they have same dollar sales, then HQ units are S/6, LQ units S/3.

Total contribution is 1.8*(S/6) + 1.2*(S/3) = 0.3 S + 0.4 S = 0.7 S.

So 0.7 S = 172,200 → S=246,000.

Which leads to 41k and 82k yards, but no option matches. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the profit is computed differently. Wait, profit is total sales minus all costs (variable and fixed). So perhaps the equation should be:

Total Sales - Total Variable Costs - Fixed Costs = Profit.

Total Sales would be 6x + 3y (where x and y are yards of HQ and LQ, respectively). But since dollar sales are equal for both products, 6x = 3y → y=2x.

So total sales = 6x + 3y = 6x +3*(2x) =6x +6x=12x.

Total Variable Costs: for HQ, 0.7*(6x) =4.2x. For LQ, 0.6*(3y)= 0.6*(6x) =3.6x. So total variable costs =4.2x +3.6x=7.8x.

So Profit = (12x) -7.8x -122200 =4.2x -122200 =50,000.

So 4.2x =172200 → x=41000 yards of HQ, y=82000 yards of LQ.

Same result again. So why isn't this among the options?

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the numbers are in different order. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 45000 and 75000. So 45k and 75k. Let's compute what that would give.

For option C: x=45,000, y=75,000.

Check if 6x =3y → 6*45=270, 3*75=225. No, they are not equal. So this option doesn't satisfy the same dollar sales condition. So it's not correct.

Option D: 47833(1/3) yards and 71750 yards. Let's compute 6x and 3y.

6*(47833.333) = 287,000 (approx). 3*71750=215,250. Not equal. So no.

Option E: 50000 and 60000. 6*5e4=3e5; 3*6e4=1.8e5. Not equal.

Option H: 35000 and 70000. 6*35e3=210,000; 3*7e4=210,000. Oh, these are equal. So in this case, same dollar sales.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the correct answer should be 41k and 82k, which isn't among the options. But option H has 35k and 70k, which do have same dollar sales. Let's compute the profit for option H.

HQ units:35,000 yards → sales 35,000 *6=210,000. LQ units:70,000 yards → sales 70,000 *3=210,000. So same dollar sales.

Compute profit.

Total Sales: 210,000 + 210,000=420,000.

Variable costs: HQ:70% of 210,000=147,000. LQ:60% of 210,000=126,000. Total variable costs=147k+126k=273,000.

Contribution: 420,000 -273,000=147,000.

Fixed costs:122,200.

Profit:147,000 -122,200=24,800. But the desired profit is 50,000. So this option doesn't give enough profit.

Hmm, so option H isn't correct.

Another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try another way.

Let me denote S as the dollar sales for each product. So each contributes S dollars.

HQ: S =6 * x → x= S/6 yards.

LQ: S=3 * y → y= S/3 yards.

Contribution from HQ: (6 - 4.2) * x =1.8x =1.8*(S/6)=0.3 S.

Contribution from LQ: (3 -1.8)* y=1.2y=1.2*(S/3)=0.4 S.

Total contribution: 0.7 S.

Fixed costs:122,200.

Profit=0.7 S -122,200=50,000 → 0.7 S=172,200 → S=246,000.

So for HQ: x=246,000 /6=41,000 yards.

For LQ: y=246,000 /3=82,000 yards.

So the correct answer should be 41k and 82k. But none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps the question intended that the number of yards sold are the same, not the dollar sales. Because the way the question is phrased could be ambiguous.

Wait the question says, "both carpets have the same dollar sales." So my initial approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the fixed costs are considered differently. Let me reread the question.

"Total fixed costs of both types of carpet combined are $122,200." So that's correct, I included that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total profit differently. Let me try another approach.

Let me assume that the number of yards sold for HQ is x, and for LQ is y.

Given that their dollar sales are equal: 6x =3y → y=2x.

Total variable costs: 0.7*6x (for HQ) +0.6*3y (for LQ) =4.2x + 1.8y.

But since y=2x, variable costs=4.2x +1.8*(2x)=4.2x+3.6x=7.8x.

Total sales:6x +3y=6x +6x=12x.

Profit= Total Sales - Variable Costs - Fixed Costs.

So 12x -7.8x -122200=50,000.

So 4.2x=50,000+122200=172200.

x=172200/4.2=41000 yards.

y=2x=82000.

So same as before. So the correct answer isn't in the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the total yards to be same, but the question says same dollar sales.

Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps option D is 47833.333 yards and 71750 yards.

Let me compute 6*47833.333=287,000. 3*71750=215,250. Not equal, so that's not possible.

Option I: 40000 and 80000. 6*4e4=240,000; 3*8e4=240,000. So same dollar sales.

Compute profit.

HQ:4e4 yards → sales 240,000. LQ:8e4 yards → sales 240,000.

Variable costs: HQ:70% of 240,000=168,000. LQ:60% of 240,000=144,000. Total variable=312,000.

Total sales: 480,000.

Contribution:480,000-312,000=168,000.

Fixed costs:122,200.

Profit=168,000-122,200=45,800. But we need 50,000. So that's less than required.

Hmm, not enough. So option I gives a profit of 45,800, which is less than 50k.

Another option: let's see option E:50000 and 60000 yards.

Dollar sales:6*5e4=300,000; 3*6e4=180,000. Not same. So not acceptable.

Option C:45,000 and 75,000 yards. 6*45e3=270,000; 3*75e3=225,000. Not same.

Option G:55,000 and 65,000. 6*55=330k; 3*65=195k. Not same.

Option J:60,000 each. 6*6e4=360k; 3*6e4=180k. Not same.

Option A:30k and 90k. 6*3e4=180k; 3*9e4=270k. Not same.

Option B:48500 and 72750. 6*48500=291,000; 3*72750=218,250. Not same.

Option F:52,000 and 78,000. 6*52e3=312k; 3*78e3=234k. Not same.

Only options H and I have same dollar sales. Option H:35k and70k. Wait, earlier calculation showed that gives 24,800 profit, which is less than 50k. Option I gives 45,800, still less than 50k.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for option D.

Option D says 47833(1/3) yards and 71750
