Okay, so I've got this question about Milgram's obedience study and the ethical criticisms it faced. I remember that Milgram's study was pretty controversial, but I need to think through exactly why.

First, I'll try to recall what the study involved. Milgram wanted to see how far ordinary people would go in obeying orders, even if it involved harming someone else. The setup was that participants were the "teachers" and had to give electric shocks to "learners" whenever they answered questions wrong. The shocks increased in intensity each time. But in reality, the learners were actors, and there were no real shocks. The point was to see when the teacher would stop, defying the authority figure.

Now, the question is about the ethical grounds on which this study was criticized. I remember that ethical issues in experiments often relate to informed consent, potential harm, deception, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Lack of debriefing after the experiment. Debriefing is important because it explains the true nature of the study to participants, especially if they were deceived. But I'm not sure if Milgram didn't debrief; I think he did, but maybe not thoroughly enough. Or maybe the issue was more about psychological harm during the study.

Option B: Lack of compensation. I don't think this was a major criticism. Payment isn't always the main ethical concern unless it's coercion, but I don't recall that being the case here.

Option C: Violation of anonymity. The study didn't involve revealing personal information, so anonymity might not be the main issue. Unless participants felt their actions were exposed, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Nonrandom sampling. This relates more to the methodology's validity rather than ethics. The sample might have been mostly male, which is a critique, but I'm not sure if it's the main ethical issue.

Option E: Physical harm. Since the shocks weren't real, there was no actual physical harm. So this might not be the right choice.

Option F: Bias in data analysis. Again, more of a methodological issue than an ethical one. Unless the data was misrepresented, but the main ethical concerns were about the treatment of participants.

Option G: Risk of psychological harm. This rings a bell. Participants were put in a stressful situation where they thought they were causing pain. Some might have experienced anxiety, guilt, or other psychological distress. Critics argued that the study put participants through significant emotional stress without proper consideration of the potential long-term effects.

So putting it together, the main ethical criticism was the risk of psychological harm to the participants because they were deceived into believing they were causing harm, leading to emotional distress.

Milgram's obedience study was criticized primarily on the ethical grounds of the risk of psychological harm to participants. The study involved deception, where participants believed they were administering electric shocks to others, leading to significant emotional distress such as anxiety and guilt. Critics argued that the study exposed participants to psychological stress without adequate consideration of potential long-term effects.

Answer: G
