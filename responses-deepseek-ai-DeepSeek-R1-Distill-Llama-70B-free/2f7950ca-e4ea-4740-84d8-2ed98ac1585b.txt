Okay, so I've got this question about electromagnetic waves and their penetration depths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says that the amplitude of the wave is given by E_y = E0 * e^(-x/δ). And we need to find the 10% and 60% depth of penetration. Right, depth of penetration usually refers to the distance x at which the amplitude of the wave drops to a certain percentage of its initial value E0.

Wait, wait. So the general formula for the amplitude as a function of x is E = E0 * e^(-x/δ). So the amplitude decreases exponentially with x. The depth of penetration, sometimes called the penetration depth, is the distance where the amplitude has decreased to 1/e of its initial value. Oh right, because when x = δ, e^(-1) is about 0.37, which is roughly 37% of E0 left. But this question is about 10% and 60%, so I guess I need to find the x where E is 10% and 60% of E0.

So let's break it down. For each percentage, I'll set up the equation and solve for x.

Starting with the 10% depth. So I want E_y to be 0.10 * E0.

So 0.10 E0 = E0 * e^(-x/δ)

Divide both sides by E0: 0.10 = e^(-x/δ)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides. ln(0.10) = (-x/δ)

So x/δ = -ln(0.10)

Wait, ln(0.10) is negative because 0.10 is less than 1. Let me calculate that. ln(1/10)= -ln(10). Since ln(10) is approximately 2.3026. So x/δ = 2.3026.

So x = 2.3026 * δ. Oh, wait, that's the 10% point. Because at x=2.3δ, the amplitude is 10% of E0.

Wait, no, wait. Because the amplitude decreases as x increases, so 10% is a deeper penetration than 60%. Wait no, 10% is less than 60%—so wait, no, 10% is when the amplitude is lower, so that's when x is larger. Because the amplitude drops as x increases. So yeah, 10% is a deeper penetration than 60%—wait, no, 60% is higher than 10%, so 60% is a smaller x, shallower depth. Oh right.

So for 60% (0.6 E0):

0.6 E0 = E0 e^(-x/δ)

Divide both sides by E0: 0.6 = e^(-x/δ)

Take ln: ln(0.6) = -x/δ

ln(0.6) is about -0.5108. So x/δ = 0.5108 → x≈0.5108 δ.

So the 60% depth is about 0.51 δ.

So the 10% depth is about 2.3 δ, and the 60% is about 0.51 δ.

Now I look at the options. Let's see.

Option H: 10% is 0.51 δ, 60% is 2.3 δ. No, that's the reverse.

Option C: 10% is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ. Yes, that's what I got.

Wait, wait no, let me check. Let me read the options again.

Option H says 10% is 0.51 δ, 60% is 2.3 δ. That's the opposite of what I calculated. So our correct 10% is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ. So option C matches that.

Wait, looking at option C: 10% is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ. Yes.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's go through the calculations again.

For 10%:

E/E0 = 0.1 = e^(-x/δ)

ln(0.1) = -x/δ → x = δ * ln(10) ≈ 2.3026 δ.

For 60%:

E/E0 = 0.6 = e^(-x/δ)

ln(0.6)= -x/δ → x = -δ * ln(0.6) → but ln(0.6)= -0.5108 → x=0.5108 δ.

So yes, 10% is about 2.3 δ, 60% about 0.51 δ. So option C says exactly that. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure. Option F is 1.23δ and 0.56δ. That's not matching. Option H is 0.51 and 2.3, but the other way around.

So the correct option is C.

To determine the 10% and 60% depth of penetration of the electromagnetic wave, we start with the given amplitude equation:

\[
E_y = E_0 e^{-x/\delta}
\]

The depth of penetration corresponds to the distance \(x\) at which the amplitude \(E_y\) drops to a specified percentage of the initial amplitude \(E_0\). For each percentage, we solve for \(x\):

### 1. For 10% depth of penetration:
\[
E_y = 0.10 E_0
\]
Substituting into the amplitude equation:
\[
0.10 E_0 = E_0 e^{-x/\delta}
\]
Divide through by \(E_0\):
\[
0.10 = e^{-x/\delta}
\]
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(0.10) = -x/\delta
\]
Since \(\ln(0.10) = -\ln(10) \approx -2.3026\), we find:
\[
x = 2.3026 \delta
\]

### 2. For 60% depth of penetration:
\[
E_y = 0.60 E_0
\]
Substituting into the amplitude equation:
\[
0.60 E_0 = E_0 e^{-x/\delta}
\]
Divide through by \(E_0\):
\[
0.60 = e^{-x/\delta}
\]
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(0.60) = -x/\delta
\]
Since \(\ln(0.60) \approx -0.5108\), we find:
\[
x = 0.5108 \delta
\]

### Final Results:
- The 10% depth of penetration is approximately \(2.3 \delta\).
- The 60% depth of penetration is approximately \(0.51 \delta\).

### Matching with the Options:
From the given options, **Option C** states:
- 10% depth of penetration: \(2.3 \delta\)
- 60% depth of penetration: \(0.51 \delta\)

This matches the calculated results. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C**
