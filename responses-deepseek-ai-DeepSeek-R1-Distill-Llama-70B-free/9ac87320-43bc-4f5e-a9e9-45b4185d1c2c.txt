Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Kelsen's theory of law. The question is asking why Kelsen’s theory is called the "pure theory." The options are from A to D, and I need to figure out the correct one.

First, I remember that Kelsen was a legal philosopher. His pure theory of law is a key concept in jurisprudence. The term "pure" probably means that he tried to isolate law from other influences. But I'm not exactly sure what he excluded.

I think he wanted law to be seen as a separate system, not mixed with other fields. So maybe he separated law from things like morality, religion, or social factors. That makes sense because sometimes legal theories get mixed up with what's morally right or wrong, but Kelsen probably wanted a more objective approach.

Looking at the options:

Option A says he only discussed jurisprudence. That doesn't seem right because the question is about why it's called "pure." It's more about the approach than the scope of his discussion.

Option B mentions defining law according to morality and purity. That doesn't fit because if he included morality, it wouldn't be pure. I think he actually tried to separate law from morality.

Option C states he separated law from religion, ethics, sociology, and history. That sounds familiar because I recall Kelsen emphasizing law as a distinct normative system, independent of other disciplines. This would make his theory "pure" because it's not contaminated by other areas.

Option D talks about discussing law purely in terms of justice. Justice is a big concept, but I'm not sure if that's why his theory is called pure. It might be more about isolating law from other influences rather than focusing solely on justice.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be C because Kelsen's pure theory is about separating law from other fields like religion, ethics, etc.

The correct answer is C because Kelsen's pure theory of law emphasizes separating law from other disciplines such as religion, ethics, sociology, and history to maintain its independence and objectivity.
