Question:

Universal Fur is located in Clyde, Baffin Island, and sells high-quality fur bow ties throughout the world at a price of $5 each. The production function for fur bow ties (q) is given by q = 240x - 2x^2, where x is the quantity of pelts used each week. Pelts are supplied only by Dan's Trading Post, which obtains them by hiring Eskimo trappers at a rate of $10 per day. Dan's weekly production function for pelts is given by x = \sqrt{l}, where l represents the number of days of Eskimo time used each week. For a quasi-competitive case in which both Universal Fur and Dan's Trading Post act as price-takers for pelts, what will be the equilibrium price (p_x) for pelt?

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

So, the setup is about two companies: Universal Fur and Dan's Trading Post. Universal Fur sells fur bow ties, and they get the pelts from Dan's. Both are acting as price-takers in a quasi-competitive market. The question is asking for the equilibrium price of pelts (p_x). 

First, let me outline the information given.

Universal Fur's production function for bow ties (q) is q = 240x - 2x², where x is the number of pelts used each week. They sell each bow tie for $5. 

Dan's Trading Post supplies the pelts. Their production function is x = sqrt(l), where l is the number of days of Eskimo trapper time used each week. Each trapper is paid $10 per day.

Wait, so Dan's Trading Post uses labor (l) to produce pelts (x). So Dan's supply of pelts depends on how much labor they hire. Since they're price-takers, the price of pelts (p_x) is determined by the market, so both firms take p_x as given.

I think I need to model both the supply and demand for pelts. The equilibrium price is where the supply of pelts equals the demand for pelts.

Let me think about the demand side first. Universal Fur is the buyer of pelts. Their demand for pelts will be based on their profit maximization. Since they're selling bow ties at $5 each, their revenue is 5*q. But q is a function of x, which is the number of pelts used.

So, q = 240x - 2x². Therefore, revenue (R) is R = 5*(240x - 2x²) = 1200x - 10x².

Their cost is the cost of pelts, which is p_x * x, because they buy x pelts at price p_x each. So, their profit (π) is R - cost = (1200x -10x²) - p_x x.

To maximize profit, take the derivative of π with respect to x and set to zero.

dπ/dx = 1200 - 20x - p_x = 0.

So, 1200 -20x = p_x.

This gives the demand for pelts (x) as a function of p_x. Wait, actually, rearranging for x: 20x = 1200 - p_x → x = (1200 - p_x)/20 = 60 - (p_x/20).

Hmm, wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 

Profit π = (1200x -10x²) - p_x x.
So, dπ/dx = 1200 -20x - p_x = 0 → p_x = 1200 -20x.

So, if I solve for x, it would be x = (1200 - p_x)/20 → x = 60 - (p_x)/20. Yeah that's correct.

Now, the supply side. Dan's Trading Post produces pelts (x) using labor (l). Their production function is x = sqrt(l). So, l is the input, and x is output.

They pay trappers $10 per day, so their cost is 10*l. They sell pelts at p_x each, so their revenue is p_x * x = p_x * sqrt(l).

Profit for Dan's is revenue minus cost: π = p_x sqrt(l) -10 l.

To find the supply of pelts, we need to find how much l they will hire. So, we take the derivative of π with respect to l, set to zero.

dπ/dl = (p_x * (1/(2 sqrt(l)))) ) -10 = 0.

Wait, let me compute that correctly. The derivative of sqrt(l) is (1/(2 sqrt(l))). So, d/dl [p_x sqrt(l)] = p_x/(2 sqrt(l)). 

So, setting derivative to zero: p_x/(2 sqrt(l)) ) -10 = 0 → p_x/(2 sqrt(l)) =10 → sqrt(l) = p_x/(20) → l = (p_x/20)^2.

So, since x = sqrt(l), substituting l gives x = sqrt( (p_x/20)^2 ) = p_x/(20).

Wait, because sqrt(l) = sqrt( (p_x^2)/(20^2) ) )= p_x/20.

So, x = p_x/20.

Wait, that can't be. Because x equals p_x/20. So, the supply of pelts is x = p_x /20.

Wait, but let me think again. Dan's Trading Post's supply function: for each p_x, how much x do they produce.

Wait, when they choose l optimally, then x = sqrt(l) becomes x = p_x/(20), as we found.

So, the supply function is x^s = p_x /20.

Now, the demand for pelts is x^d = (1200 - p_x)/20.

In equilibrium, x^s = x^d.

So, set (p_x/20) = (1200 - p_x)/20.

Multiply both sides by 20: p_x = 1200 - p_x → 2 p_x = 1200 → p_x = 600.

So, the equilibrium price is $600 per pelt.

Looking at the options, option J is 600.

To determine the equilibrium price of pelts (\(p_x\)) in the quasi-competitive market, we analyze the demand and supply of pelts.

### Demand for Pelts
Universal Fur produces bow ties using the production function \(q = 240x - 2x^2\), where \(x\) is the number of pelts used. They sell each bow tie for $5, so their revenue is:

\[
R = 5q = 5(240x - 2x^2) = 1200x - 10x^2
\]

The cost of producing bow ties is the cost of pelts, which is \(p_x x\). Therefore, the profit function is:

\[
\pi = R - \text{cost} = (1200x - 10x^2) - p_x x
\]

To maximize profit, we take the derivative of \(\pi\) with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d\pi}{dx} = 1200 - 20x - p_x = 0
\]

Rearranging gives the demand for pelts:

\[
p_x = 1200 - 20x \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{1200 - p_x}{20} = 60 - \frac{p_x}{20}
\]

### Supply of Pelts
Dan's Trading Post produces pelts using the production function \(x = \sqrt{l}\), where \(l\) is the number of days of Eskimo trapper time. The cost of hiring trappers is $10 per day, so the total cost is \(10l\). The revenue from selling pelts is \(p_x x = p_x \sqrt{l}\). The profit function is:

\[
\pi = p_x \sqrt{l} - 10l
\]

To maximize profit, we take the derivative of \(\pi\) with respect to \(l\) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d\pi}{dl} = \frac{p_x}{2\sqrt{l}} - 10 = 0
\]

Solving for \(l\):

\[
\frac{p_x}{2\sqrt{l}} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{l} = \frac{p_x}{20} \quad \Rightarrow \quad l = \left(\frac{p_x}{20}\right)^2
\]

Since \(x = \sqrt{l}\), substituting \(l\) gives:

\[
x = \sqrt{\left(\frac{p_x}{20}\right)^2} = \frac{p_x}{20}
\]

Thus, the supply of pelts is:

\[
x^s = \frac{p_x}{20}
\]

### Equilibrium
In equilibrium, the demand for pelts equals the supply of pelts:

\[
x^d = x^s \quad \Rightarrow \quad 60 - \frac{p_x}{20} = \frac{p_x}{20}
\]

Solving for \(p_x\):

\[
60 = \frac{p_x}{20} + \frac{p_x}{20} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 60 = \frac{2p_x}{20} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2p_x = 1200 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_x = 600
\]

Thus, the equilibrium price of pelts is **$600**.

The correct answer is **J: 600**.
