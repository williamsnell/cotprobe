Question:

A 42-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after he passed a renal calculus. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitor
B: Alpha-adrenergic blocker
C: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
D: Osmotic diuretic
E: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
F: Na+ –Cl− symport inhibitor
G: Potassium-sparing diuretic
H: Beta-adrenergic blocker
I: Aldosterone antagonist
J: Calcium channel blocker

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again.

The patient is a 42-year-old man who came in for a follow-up after passing a renal calculus—so that's a kidney stone. The analysis of the stone showed calcium as the primary cation. So it's a calcium-based stone. His physical exam is normal today, but a 24-hour urine collection shows increased calcium excretion. The question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for him.

Hmm. I remember that kidney stones can be caused by various factors, and the treatment often depends on the type of stone. Since this is calcium-based, I think the main types are calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones.

The increased calcium in the urine suggests hypercalciuria. So he's excreting too much calcium. I recall that hypercalciuria can lead to the formation of calcium stones because there's more calcium available to precipitate and form stones.

Now, the treatment options for hypercalciuria usually involve reducing the amount of calcium in the urine. I think diuretics might be used here. Wait, there are different types of diuretics. Let me think about which ones affect calcium excretion.

Loop diuretics increase calcium excretion, so they wouldn't be good here. Thiazide diuretics, on the other hand, decrease urinary calcium. Oh right, thiazides are used to treat hypercalciuria because they promote calcium retention in the bones and reduce excretion.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one corresponds to a thiazide diuretic. Let me see the options again.

Option F is Na+ -Cl− symport inhibitor. Thiazides work by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule. So that would be option F.

Wait, what about other options? Let me check others to make sure.

Option A: Na+–K+–2Cl− symport inhibitor. That's a loop diuretic like furosemide. They increase Ca excretion, which is bad in this case, so not A.

Option C: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Those are like acetazolamide. They can increase excretion of bicarbonate but I'm not sure about calcium. Maybe they increase calcium excretion too, but I'm not certain. Either way, probably not the first choice here.

Option G: Potassium-sparing diuretic. These include spironolactone or amiloride. They might help with hypokalemia, but I don't think they directly reduce calcium excretion much. So maybe not the best option.

Option I: Aldosterone antagonist. That's similar to potassium-sparing. Also probably not the main treatment here.

Option E: ACE inhibitors. They usually affect blood pressure and proteinuria but not sure about calcium excretion. Maybe not directly relevant.

Option H: Beta-blockers. They're for blood pressure or heart conditions, not directly related to calcium in urine.

Option J: Calcium channel blockers. They affect calcium entry into cells, but in this context, maybe in the kidney? Wait, some calcium channel blockers can reduce urinary calcium excretion. Like, I think there are studies where certain dihydropyridines might help, but I'm not sure if that's the first line.

Wait, thiazides are more commonly used for this. So option F is a thiazide diuretic, which is the standard treatment for hypercalciuria to prevent stones.

So the correct answer should be F.

The patient is a 42-year-old man with a history of passing a calcium-based renal calculus and increased urinary calcium excretion (hypercalciuria). The goal of treatment is to reduce urinary calcium to prevent future stone formation. Thiazide diuretics are the standard treatment for hypercalciuria because they decrease urinary calcium excretion by promoting calcium retention in the body. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (Na+–K+–2Cl− symport inhibitor):** This is a loop diuretic, which increases calcium excretion and is contraindicated in this case.  
- **Option B (Alpha-adrenergic blocker):** Not relevant to calcium excretion.  
- **Option C (Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor):** May increase calcium excretion and is not a first-line treatment.  
- **Option D (Osmotic diuretic):** Does not specifically reduce calcium excretion.  
- **Option E (Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor):** Primarily used for blood pressure control and not directly relevant to hypercalciuria.  
- **Option F (Na+–Cl− symport inhibitor):** This is a thiazide diuretic, which is the standard treatment for hypercalciuria.  
- **Option G (Potassium-sparing diuretic):** Does not significantly reduce urinary calcium.  
- **Option H (Beta-adrenergic blocker):** Used for blood pressure control and not relevant to calcium excretion.  
- **Option I (Aldosterone antagonist):** Similar to potassium-sparing diuretics and not a first-line treatment for hypercalciuria.  
- **Option J (Calcium channel blocker):** While some calcium channel blockers may reduce urinary calcium, thiazides are the preferred first-line treatment.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is **Option F**, a thiazide diuretic, as it effectively reduces urinary calcium excretion and is the standard treatment for hypercalciuria. 

Answer: F
