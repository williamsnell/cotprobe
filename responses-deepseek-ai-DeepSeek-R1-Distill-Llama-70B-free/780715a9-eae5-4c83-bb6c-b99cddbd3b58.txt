Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electromotive force (emf) and equilibrium constants. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking what the emf of a system is when the equilibrium constant K equals the concentration quotient Q. I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but I'll try to work through it.

Wait, I remember that the emf of a cell is related to the concentrations of the reactants and products. There's this Nernst equation that comes into play here. The Nernst equation relates the cell potential to the standard cell potential and the reaction quotient Q.

The Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q, right? Or sometimes it's written with a natural log or base 10 log, but I think it's natural log. Oh wait, another version I've seen is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q at 25°C. But since the question is general, I'll go with the natural log version.

At equilibrium, the system is at its equilibrium point, so Q equals K. Because when Q equals K, the reaction is at equilibrium and no longer driving the cell. So when Q=K, the cell isn't producing any emf because the system is at equilibrium—there's no net movement of electrons. Or wait, is it that the emf is zero?

Wait, no. The emf is the force that drives the reaction. At equilibrium, the system is in a state where there's no net reaction occurring. So the cell can't do any work, meaning the emf should be zero. Or am I mixing things up?

Oh wait, the Nernst equation when Q=K: let me plug that in. E = E° - (RT/nF) ln K. But wait, what's E°? E° is the standard cell potential, which is the emf when all concentrations are at standard conditions (usually 1M). Oh wait, but the standard cell potential is also related to the equilibrium constant K. Because at equilibrium, the cell potential E is zero. So when Q=K, E becomes zero.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when the system is at equilibrium, there's no tendency for the reaction to proceed in either direction, so the emf is zero. So the answer would be I: 0.

Let me double-check this. The Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q. At equilibrium, Q=K, so substituting K gives E = E° - (RT/nF) ln K. But E° is (RT/nF) ln K by the relation E° = (RT/nF) ln K. So substituting that, E becomes (RT/nF) ln K - (RT/nF) ln K = 0. So yes, E is zero when Q=K.

So the correct answer must be option I, which is 0.

When the equilibrium constant \( K \) equals the concentration quotient \( Q \), the system is at equilibrium. At equilibrium, there is no net reaction occurring, and the electromotive force (emf) of the cell becomes zero. This is derived from the Nernst equation:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q
\]

At equilibrium, \( Q = K \), so substituting this into the equation gives:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln K
\]

The standard cell potential \( E^\circ \) is related to \( K \) by the equation:

\[
E^\circ = \frac{RT}{nF} \ln K
\]

Substituting \( E^\circ \) into the Nernst equation results in:

\[
E = \frac{RT}{nF} \ln K - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln K = 0
\]

Thus, the emf of the system is zero when \( K = Q \). The correct answer is:

I: 0
