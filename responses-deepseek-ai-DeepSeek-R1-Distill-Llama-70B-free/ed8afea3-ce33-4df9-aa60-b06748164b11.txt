Okay, so I've got this problem about a six-pole generator with a lap winding. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem gives me that there are 300 inductors on the armature. Wait, I think inductors here probably mean the number of armature coils. So 300 coils in total. The flux is 900,000 lines per pole. Oh wait, lines per pole, right. And the speed is 1500 revolutions per minute.

The question has two parts, a and b. Part a is about the voltage between the brushes when it's lap wound, and part b is if it were wave wound. So I'll need to calculate both.

I remember that for generators, the generated voltage (EMF) can be calculated using the formula E = (PφZN)/(60A), where P is the number of poles, φ is the flux per pole, Z is the number of conductors (which I think is twice the number of coils since each coil has two ends), N is the speed in rpm, and A is the number of parallel paths.

Wait, wait. So in a lap winding, the number of parallel paths A equals the number of poles P. Because in lap windings, each pole has its own parallel path. So for a six-pole machine, A is 6.

In wave windings, the number of parallel paths is 2, regardless of the number of poles. Because the wave winding connects all the poles in a single circuit, so there are two parallel paths (since current goes in and out in two paths).

So let's tackle part a first.

Given:
- P = 6 poles
- Number of coils, let's say C =300
- Flux per pole, φ =900,000 lines (I think this is in maxwell units)
- Speed, N =1500 rpm

Wait, Z, the number of conductors, is twice the number of coils because each coil has two sides. So Z = 2*C = 600 conductors.

So for part a, since it's lap wound, A = P =6.

Plugging into the formula:

E = (P * φ * Z * N) / (60 * A)

Wait, let me double-check that formula. Yeah, E is the generated voltage. The formula accounts for all these factors.

So substituting the numbers:

E = (6 * 900,000 * 600 * 1500) / (60 *6 )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, numerator: 6 * 900,000 = 5,400,000.

Then, 5,400,000 * 600 = 3,240,000,000.

Then, multiply by 1500: 3,240,000,000 *1500 = let's see, 3.24e9 * 1.5e3 = 4.86e12.

Denominator: 60 *6=360.

So E =4.86e12 / 360.

Let me compute that. 4,860,000,000,000 divided by 360.

Well, 4.86e12 / 360 = (4.86 / 0.36) *1e12 /1e2? Wait, maybe I'll compute it numerically.

4,860,000,000,000 divided by 360.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 486,000,000,000 / 36.

36 times 13.5 is 486, so 486 divided by 36 is 13.5.

Wait, 36 * 13.5 = 486. So 486,000,000,000 divided by 36 is 13.5 * 1e9 =13,500,000,000 volts? Wait, that can't be right. I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait a minute, that's way too high. I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses φ in webers, but since flux is given as lines, which is maxwells. Because 1 weber is 1e8 maxwells. Oh wait no, 1 maxwell is 1e-8 webers. So 900,000 lines per pole would be 900,000 * 1e-8 = 0.009 webers per pole. Oh, right, I forgot to convert maxwells to webers because the standard formula uses webers.

Oh man, that's a crucial point. So the flux per pole is 900,000 maxwells. Since 1 Wb = 1e8 maxwells, so φ = 900,000 / 1e8 = 0.009 Wb per pole.

So let's correct that in the formula.

So E = (P * φ * Z * N) / (60 * A)

φ is 0.009 Wb.

So substituting the correct φ:

E = (6 * 0.009 * 600 * 1500) / (60 *6 )

Compute numerator:

6 *0.009=0.054.

0.054 *600=32.4.

32.4 *1500=48,600.

Denominator:60 *6=360.

So E =48,600 / 360 = ?

48,600 ÷ 360.

Well, 360 x 135 =48,600 (because 360 x 100=36,000; 360x35=12,600; 36,000+12,600=48,600).

So 48,600 /360 =135 volts.

Wait, but wait a minute, the options don't have 135 as an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of conductors Z. Because the number of conductors is twice the number of coils, right? Because each coil has two ends. So 300 coils would give 600 conductors. That part I think is correct.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, 6 poles, 300 coils, 900,000 maxwells per pole.

Convert to webers: 900,000 / 1e8 = 0.009 webers per pole.

Z is 600.

So E = (6 * 0.009 *600 *1500)/(60 *6 )

Let me compute step by step.

Multiply 6 *0.009: 0.054.

Multiply by 600: 0.054 *600 =32.4.

Multiply by 1500: 32.4 *1500 =48,600.

Divide by (60*6)=360: 48,600 /360=135 volts.

Hmm, but the options don't have 135 volts for part a. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is E = (P * φ * Z * N) / (60 * A * C), where C is the number of coils? Or wait, perhaps I'm confusing something else.

Wait, the formula I remember is E = (φ Z N P) / (60 A), but perhaps I missed a factor. Let me quickly check the generator voltage formula.

Wait, the standard formula is E = (φ Z N P) / (60 A), but considering that Z is the number of conductors, which is 2*C, where C is the number of coils. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the calculation for part a, I got 135 volts. Now, looking at the options, the first parts of the options are around 60-80 volts. So I must have a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of parallel paths A. In lap winding, A equals the number of poles. So for 6 poles, A=6, which I used correctly.

Wait, another thing: Maybe the speed is 1500 rpm, but for the formula, we need it in revolutions per second. No, the formula uses rpm, as it's multiplied by (1/60) to get per second, but the formula E= (PφZN)/(60A) uses N in rpm. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the flux. Let me recheck.

900,000 lines per pole. 1 Wb is 1e8 lines, so 900,000 lines is 900,000 /1e8 = 0.009 Wb. Correct.

So if the calculation gives 135 volts, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of conductors.

Wait, the number of conductors Z is 2*C. So C=300, Z=600. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is using Z as the number of armature conductors, which is twice the number of coils. So that's right.

Wait, another possibility: Did I mix up the poles and something else? Let's see the problem says it's a lap winding. So A is 6.

Wait, perhaps I should compute voltage for part a and part b.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute:

6 *0.009= 0.054.

0.054 *600 =32.4.

32.4 *1500 =48,600.

Divide by (60*6) =360.

48,600 /360 =135 volts.

So part a is 135 volts.

But looking at the options, none of the first parts of the options match 135. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the number of poles. Wait, the generator has 6 poles, which for a lap winding gives A=6, correct.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the formula is E = (φ Z N P) / (60 * A) ?

Wait, no, that's what I used.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Alternative sources say:

The generated voltage E is given by E = (φ Z N P)/(60 A).

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that in a lap winding, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles P. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a computational error. Let me recalculate:

6 *0.009=0.054.

0.054 *600=32.4.

32.4 *1500=48,600.

48,600 /360=135.

Yes, 135 volts.

But the options don't have 135. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the armature has 300 conductors, not 300 coils. Wait, the question says 300 inductors, which I'm assuming are coils. Because each inductor is a coil. So 300 coils, which gives 600 conductors.

Wait, but perhaps inductors here mean conductors. No, that doesn't make sense. Because inductors are coils, which are made of conductors.

Alternatively, perhaps the question says 300 armature conductors. Then Z would be 300.

Wait, the question says "300 inductors on the surface of the armature." So perhaps each inductor is a conductor, meaning Z=300. Then each conductor is a single loop, which doesn't make sense because then it would be a wave winding with one turn per conductor. Hmm, that's probably not the case. So I think my initial approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the number of coils differently. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The number of coils is C=300.

In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths A = P=6.

The number of conductors per path is C/A =300/6=50 coils per path. Since each coil has two conductors, each path has 50 *2=100 conductors.

Wait, but in the formula, Z is the total number of conductors, which is 600, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula, and the correct formula is E = (φ Z N P) / (60 A).

Wait, perhaps I should try calculating again.

So:

φ =0.009 Wb.

Z=600.

N=1500.

P=6.

A=6.

So E = (6 * 0.009 *600 *1500 )/(60 *6).

Compute numerator: 6 *0.009=0.054.

0.054 *600=32.4.

32.4 *1500=48,600.

Denominator:60 *6=360.

So 48,600 /360 =135.

So 135 volts for part a.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in part b.

Wait, the question has part a as lap and part b as wave. So perhaps for part b, when it's wave wound, A=2.

So part b would be E = (6 *0.009 *600 *1500) / (60*2).

Compute that:

Same numerator as before:48,600.

Denominator:60 *2=120.

48,600 /120=405 volts.

But again, the options don't have 405.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial approach. Maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, another formula I remember is E = (k * Z * φ * N * P) / (60 * A * a), where a is the number of current paths per pair of poles, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, maybe the formula requires considering the number of coils in series.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of coils per pole and paths.

Wait, let me think about the number of coils per pole. Since it's a lap winding, the number of coils per pole is C/P =300/6=50 coils per pole.

In a lap winding, each pole has A paths, where A=P=6.

Wait, so each path has C/(A) =300/6=50 coils.

Each coil has two conductors, so each path has 50*2=100 conductors.

So the generated EMF would be E = (φ * Z * N * P) / (60 * A) ?

Wait, but that's the same formula I used earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E = (φ * Z * N * P) / (60 * A), which is what I did.

Wait, maybe the speed is in rpm, but perhaps I should convert it to revolutions per second, but the formula uses rpm already, so N is 1500 rpm.

So I'm confident my calculation for part a is 135 volts and part b is 405 volts, but the options don't have these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the number of conductors Z is 300, not 600. Because perhaps the question refers to 300 inductors as conductors, not coils. So let's try that.

So Z=300.

Then for part a:

E = (6 *0.009 *300 *1500) / (60*6).

Compute numerator:6 *0.009=0.054.

0.054 *300=16.2.

16.2 *1500=24,300.

Denominator:60*6=360.

24,300 /360 =67.5 volts.

Oh, this matches one of the options. So perhaps I misinterpreted Z as 600 when it's actually 300.

Wait, but why would that be the case? The question says 300 inductors, which I thought were coils, so Z=600. But perhaps the inductors are conductors, so Z=300.

Ah, this might be the confusion. So perhaps the 300 inductors mean 300 conductors, so Z=300.

So let me recalculate with Z=300.

Part a:

E = (6 * 0.009 *300 *1500) / (60 *6).

Compute:

6 *0.009=0.054.

0.054 *300=16.2.

16.2 *1500=24,300.

24,300 / (60*6)= 24,300/360=67.5 volts.

Part b: wave winding, A=2.

E = (6 *0.009 *300 *1500) / (60 *2).

6*0.009=0.054.

0.054 *300=16.2.

16.2 *1500=24,300.

Denominator:60 *2=120.

24,300/120=202.5 volts.

So part a is 67.5 V, part b is 202.5 V.

Looking at the options:

Option F: 67.5 V and 202.5 V.

So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but why did I get 67.5 when I considered Z as 300 instead of 600?

Because perhaps the question states that there are 300 conductors, not 300 coils. So I think I initially misread that. So in the problem statement, it's 300 inductors on the surface of the armature. If inductors are conductors, then Z=300.

So that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is option F: 67.5 and 202.5 volts.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the generated voltage for both lap and wave windings using the formula:

\[
E = \frac{P \cdot \phi \cdot Z \cdot N}{60 \cdot A}
\]

### Given Data:
- Number of poles, \(P = 6\)
- Number of inductors (conductors), \(Z = 300\)
- Flux per pole, \(\phi = 900,000\) maxwells \(= 0.009\) Wb (since \(1 \, \text{Wb} = 10^8 \, \text{maxwells}\))
- Speed, \(N = 1500 \, \text{rpm}\)

### Part (a): Lap Winding
In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths \(A\) equals the number of poles \(P\), so \(A = 6\).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
E = \frac{6 \cdot 0.009 \cdot 300 \cdot 1500}{60 \cdot 6}
\]

1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   6 \cdot 0.009 = 0.054
   \]
   \[
   0.054 \cdot 300 = 16.2
   \]
   \[
   16.2 \cdot 1500 = 24,300
   \]

2. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   60 \cdot 6 = 360
   \]

3. Divide:
   \[
   E = \frac{24,300}{360} = 67.5 \, \text{V}
   \]

### Part (b): Wave Winding
In a wave winding, the number of parallel paths \(A = 2\), regardless of the number of poles.

Substituting into the formula:

\
