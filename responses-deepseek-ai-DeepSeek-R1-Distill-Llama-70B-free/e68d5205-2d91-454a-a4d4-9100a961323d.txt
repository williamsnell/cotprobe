Question:

Carmen spends her entire weekly income on two goods: X and Y. At her current consumption level of the two goods, the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good X is 5 and the marginal utility of the last dollar she spent on good Y is 10. To maximize her utility, Carmen should

Options:

A: stop buying Y and only buy X
B: buy fewer units of X and more units of Y
C: maintain her current consumption level but seek cheaper prices
D: buy fewer units of both X and Y
E: buy more units of both X and Y
F: buy more units of X and less units of Y
G: buy equal amounts of X and Y
H: maintain her current consumption level of the two goods
I: stop buying X and only buy Y
J: buy fewer units of Y and more units of X

Okay, so I have this economics question here about Carmen and her utility maximization. Hmm, I remember from my class that when trying to maximize utility, the consumer should allocate their income in a way that the marginal utilities per dollar are equal for all goods they're buying. So the main idea is that the last dollar spent on each good should give the same amount of utility. 

The question says that Carmen spends her entire weekly income on two goods, X and Y. Right now, the marginal utility of the last dollar she spent on X is 5, and on Y it's 10. So, I think the marginal utilities aren't equal here. That probably means she's not maximizing her utility yet.

Wait, what's marginal utility per dollar exactly? Oh right, it's the utility she gets from the last dollar spent on each good. So if MU per dollar for X is 5 and for Y is 10, that means each dollar spent on Y gives her more utility than the same dollar spent on X. 

So, to maximize utility, she should try to equalize these marginal utilities. How? By adjusting her purchases. Since Y gives higher marginal utility per dollar, she should buy more Y and less X. Because if she buys more Y, the marginal utility of Y might decrease (due to diminishing returns), and if she buys less X, the marginal utility of X might increase. This adjustment should continue until both reach the same level.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B says buy fewer units of X and more of Y. That sounds right because she's moving money from X to Y, which has a higher MU per dollar. Option J says buy fewer Y and more X, which would be the opposite, so that can't be right. 

Wait, let me double-check. If Y's MU per dollar is higher, she should spend more on Y. So buying more Y and less X would shift her spending towards Y, which has higher marginal utility. So the correct action is to buy more Y and less X. That's option B. 

Other options: Option I says stop buying X and only buy Y. That might be too extreme unless the MU per dollar can't be equalized otherwise, but the question doesn't say that. She should just adjust, not completely stop. Similarly, option A is the opposite. Option F is more X, less Y, which is wrong. Option J is also wrong. 

So the answer should be B: buy fewer units of X and more units of Y.

To maximize her utility, Carmen should allocate her income such that the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good is equal. Currently, the marginal utility per dollar for good X is 5, while for good Y it is 10. Since Y provides higher marginal utility per dollar, Carmen should shift her spending by buying more units of Y and fewer units of X. This adjustment will help equalize the marginal utilities, thereby maximizing her overall utility.

Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**B: buy fewer units of X and more units of Y.**

Answer: B
