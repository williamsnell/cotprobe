Okay, so I've got this problem here about the partition function and population ratios of singlet and triplet states. Hmm, I need to tackle part a) first, and then part b). Let me think this through.

Alright, part a) asks for the electronic factor in the partition function. I remember that the partition function is a sum over all the states, each weighted by their Boltzmann factor, which includes their degeneracy and energy. Oh right, the electronic partition function q_electronic is the sum of g_i * exp(-ε_i/(k_B T)), where g_i is the degeneracy and ε_i is the energy of each state.

Wait, the molecule has singlet and triplet levels. Singlet has degeneracy 1, triplet 3. The singlet's energy is higher than the triplet by a factor ε. So the triplet is lower in energy. So the singlet energy is ε higher than triplet. Or wait, the problem says the energy of the singlet is greater than the triplet by a factor ε. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. So, let's say the triplet has energy ε_t and singlet ε_s = ε_t + ε. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, the way it's worded: "the energy of the singlet state is greater than that of the triplet by a factor ε." So I think ε represents the energy difference. So ε = ε_s - ε_t, which is positive.

So for the triplet state, the energy is lower. So when calculating the Boltzmann factors, the triplet will have a lower exponent because it's lower in energy. So the triplet has energy 0 (I can set ε_t = 0 for simplicity), and the singlet has energy ε.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the triplet is at some energy and the singlet is higher by ε. So let's model them as such.

So the partition function q would be the sum of each state's contribution. The triplet has degeneracy 3 and energy ε_t. Let's say triplet is at energy 0, so ε_t = 0. Then singlet is at ε_s = ε. So their contributions would be:

Triplet: g_triplet * exp( -ε_t/(k_B T) ) = 3 * exp(0) = 3 * 1 = 3.

Singlet: g_singlet * exp( -ε_s/(k_B T) ) = 1 * exp( -ε/(k_B T) ).

So the total partition function q is 3 + exp( -ε/(k_B T) ). 

Wait, but wait, what about the zero point of energy? If we set the triplet energy as zero, then the singlet is at ε. So the Boltzmann factors are as I wrote.

So part a)'s answer is q = 3 + exp(-ε/(k_B T)). The approximation made here is that the energy levels are sufficiently separated that other states are not thermally accessible, so we only consider these two. Also, maybe that the electronic states are non-degenerate except for their spin multiplicities, and that vibrational and rotational states are not considered—so it's just the electronic contribution.

Wait, the question says "the electronic factor in the partition function", so maybe they consider only the electronic part. So yes, that makes sense.

Now part b) asks for the ratio of the population of the singlet to triplet levels, given ε = 1.38e-14 erg and T=100 K.

The population ratio is (n_singlet) / (n_triplet). The population of each state is given by (g_i exp(-ε_i/(k_B T))) / q, where q is the partition function.

So the ratio would be [g_singlet exp(-ε_s/(k_B T)) / q ] / [g_triplet exp(-ε_t/(k_B T)) / q ]

The q's cancel out. So it's [g_singlet exp(-ε_s/(k_B T))] / [g_triplet exp(-ε_t/(k_B T))].

But ε_t is zero for the triplet, so exp(0)=1. And ε_s is ε. So this ratio becomes [1 * exp(-ε/(k_B T))] / [3 * 1] = (1/3) exp(-ε/(k_B T)).

So I need to compute this value.

Given ε = 1.38e-14 erg, T=100 K. The Boltzmann constant k_B is 1.38e-16 erg/K (since 1 eV is about 1.6e-12 erg, and k_B is about 8.617e-5 eV/K, so 8.617e-5 * 1.6e-12 = 1.38e-16 erg/K). Wait, let me double-check that. Oh yes, because 1 J = 10^7 erg, and k_B is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K, so 1.38e-23 J/K * 1e7 erg/J = 1.38e-16 erg/K. So that's correct.

So, the exponent is -ε/(k_B T) = -(1.38e-14 erg) / (1.38e-16 erg/K * 100 K) ).

Let's compute denominator first: 1.38e-16 * 100 = 1.38e-14.

So exponent becomes -(1.38e-14) / (1.38e-14) )= -1. So the exponent is exp(-1) ≈ 0.3679.

So the ratio is (1/3) * 0.3679 ≈ 0.1226.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.123, which matches this number. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me confirm all the steps again. Did I mix up the energies? The singlet is higher in energy, so when T is higher, the population would be less in the higher energy state. So the ratio singlet/triplet should be small. The calculation gave about 0.123, which is small, so that makes sense.

Also, in the exponent, I used ε = 1.38e-14 erg. Let me make sure the calculation is correct.

Yes, (1.38e-14) / (1.38e-16 * 100) = (1.38e-14) / (1.38e-14) )= 1. So exp(-1) is correct.

Thus, the answer is B: 0.123.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the electronic partition function for part (a). The partition function is given by:

\[
q = \sum_i g_i e^{-\epsilon_i / (k_B T)}
\]

Here, the singlet state has degeneracy \(g_{\text{singlet}} = 1\) and energy \(\epsilon_{\text{singlet}} = \epsilon\), while the triplet state has degeneracy \(g_{\text{triplet}} = 3\) and energy \(\epsilon_{\text{triplet}} = 0\). Substituting these values:

\[
q = 3 + e^{-\epsilon / (k_B T)}
\]

The approximations made are that only the electronic states are considered, and the energy levels are sufficiently separated that other states are not thermally accessible.

For part (b), the ratio of the population of the singlet level to the triplet level is calculated using the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{singlet}}}{n_{\text{triplet}}} = \frac{g_{\text{singlet}} e^{-\epsilon_{\text{singlet}} / (k_B T)}}{g_{\text{triplet}} e^{-\epsilon_{\text{triplet}} / (k_B T)}}
\]

Since \(\epsilon_{\text{triplet}} = 0\), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{singlet}}}{n_{\text{triplet}}} = \frac{1 \cdot e^{-\epsilon / (k_B T)}}{3 \cdot 1} = \frac{1}{3} e^{-\epsilon / (k_B T)}
\]

Given \(\epsilon = 1.38 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{erg}\), \(T = 100 \, \text{K}\), and \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{erg/K}\), the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\epsilon}{k_B T} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-14}}{1.38 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 100} = 1
\]

Thus, \(e^{-\epsilon / (k_B T)} = e^{-1} \approx 0.3679\). Substituting this into the population ratio:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{singlet}}}{n_{\text{triplet}}} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 0.3679 \approx 0.1226
\]

This matches option **B** (0.123). Therefore, the final answer is:

B
