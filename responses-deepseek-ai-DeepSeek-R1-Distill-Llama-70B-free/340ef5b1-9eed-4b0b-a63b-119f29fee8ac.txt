Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the vector that spans the kernel of a given matrix A. The matrix is a 4x4 matrix, and the options are provided from A to J. I'm a bit rusty on my linear algebra, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the kernel (or null space) of a matrix A is the set of all vectors x such that Ax = 0. So I need to solve this equation for x. The kernel is a subspace, and if it's one-dimensional, it can be spanned by a single vector, which is what the question is asking for.

The matrix A is:
[1, 0, 2, 4]
[0, 1, -3, -1]
[3, 4, -6, 8]
[0, -1, 3, 4]

I think the best approach is to perform row reduction to get A into its reduced row echelon form (RREF). This will help me find the solutions to Ax=0.

Let me write down the matrix and start the row operations.

Original matrix:
Row 1: 1 0 2 4
Row 2: 0 1 -3 -1
Row 3: 3 4 -6 8
Row 4: 0 -1 3 4

I'll start by eliminating the entries below the first pivot. The first element is 1, so I can use that.

Row 3 has a 3 in the first position. So I'll subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 3.

Row3 = Row3 - 3*Row1
Row3: 3-3*1=0, 4-3*0=4, -6 -3*2= -6-6= -12, 8-3*4=8-12=-4

So new Row3 is [0,4,-12,-4]

Next, Row 4 has a 0 in the first position, so I don't need to do anything for the first column beyond Row 3.

Now, moving to the second column. The pivot is 1 in Row 2.

Looking at Row3, the second element is 4. So I can eliminate that by subtracting 4*Row2 from Row3.

Row3 = Row3 -4*Row2

Row2 is [0,1,-3,-1]

4*Row2: [0,4,-12,-4]

Row3: [0,4,-12,-4] - [0,4,-12,-4] = [0,0,0,0]

So Row3 becomes all zeros. Hmm, interesting.

Moving to Row4. It's [0,-1,3,4]. I can eliminate the -1 in the second column by adding Row2 to Row4.

Row4 = Row4 + Row2

Row2 is [0,1,-3,-1]

Adding: 0+0=0, -1+1=0, 3 + (-3)=0, 4 + (-1)=3

So Row4 becomes [0,0,0,3]

Wait, that's [0,0,0,3]. So now the matrix after these operations looks like:

Row1: 1 0 2 4
Row2: 0 1 -3 -1
Row3: 0 0 0 0
Row4: 0 0 0 3

Wait, but there's a problem here. Because in Row4, the last element is 3. Let me check my calculations again. Did I make a mistake in Row4?

Wait, let me go through Row4's calculation again.

Original Row4: [0, -1, 3, 4]

Row2 is [0,1,-3,-1]

So Row4 + Row2 would be:

0+0=0,

-1 +1= 0,

3 + (-3) = 0,

4 + (-1)=3.

So Row4 becomes [0,0,0,3]. But that's inconsistent because in the augmented matrix for Ax=0, it's [0 0 0 | 0], but here the last element is 3, which would imply 0x + 0y + 0z +0w =3, which is impossible. That suggests I made a mistake in the row operations.

Wait, no. Because I'm just doing row operations on A, not an augmented matrix. Wait, but if the original matrix is A, then when I perform row operations, I'm transforming A. So perhaps I should consider that the last row becomes [0,0,0,3], which would mean that 3w =0? Or wait, no. Because in the equation Ax=0, each row represents an equation. So Row4 would be 0x +0y +0z +3w =0 → 3w=0 → w=0.

Wait, but how did that happen. Let me recount my steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.

After Row3 was modified to [0,4,-12,-4], then I used Row2 to eliminate the 4 in Row3.

So Row3 becomes Row3 -4*Row2.

Row3: 0,4-4*1=0, -12-4*(-3)= -12 +12=0, -4 -4*(-1)= -4 +4=0.

So Row3 becomes [0,0,0,0]. That's correct.

Then, Row4 is [0,-1,3,4].

I want to eliminate the -1 in the second column, so I'll add Row2 to Row4.

Row4 = Row4 + Row2.

Row2 is [0,1,-3,-1].

Adding:

0+0=0,

-1 +1=0,

3 + (-3)=0,

4 + (-1)=3.

So Row4 becomes [0,0,0,3].

Wait, that's a problem. Because in the system Ax=0, the last equation would be 0x + 0y +0z +3w=0 → 3w=0 → w=0.

So now, let's write down the equations:

From Row1: x + 2z +4w =0 → x = -2z -4w.

From Row2: y -3z -w =0 → y=3z +w.

From Row4: 3w=0 → w=0.

So substituting w=0 into the above equations:

x= -2z

y=3z.

So the solution is x= -2z, y=3z, w=0, and z is a free variable.

So the general solution is:

x = -2z

y=3z

z = z

w=0

So we can write this as a vector:

[x, y, z, w] = z[-2, 3, 1, 0]

So the kernel is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [-2,3,1,0].

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that vector. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: [1, 2, 3,4]

B: [-1,2,0,3]

C: [0,3,-3,1]

D: [3,-1,0,4]

E: [5,-2,1,4]

F: [1,-1,2,0]

G: [2,1,3,-1]

H: [4,0,-2,1]

I: [0,1,-1,2]

J: [-2,3,1,0].

Oh wait, option J is [-2,3,1,0], which matches what I found. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check my row operations because I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, after Row3 became [0,0,0,0], and Row4 became [0,0,0,3], which gives w=0.

So the solution is x = -2z, y=3z, w=0, and z is free. So the vector is [-2,3,1,0], which is option J.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the vector that spans the kernel of the matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & -1 \\ 3 & 4 & -6 & 8 \\ 0 & -1 & 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \), we need to solve \( A\mathbf{x} = 0 \). This involves performing row reduction to transform \( A \) into its reduced row echelon form (RREF) and identifying the solutions.

### Step 1: Row Reduction
1. Start with the original matrix:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
   0 & 1 & -3 & -1 \\
   3 & 4 & -6 & 8 \\
   0 & -1 & 3 & 4
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. Eliminate the entry in the first column of Row 3 by subtracting \( 3 \times \text{Row 1} \) from Row 3:
   \[
   \text{Row 3} = \text{Row 3} - 3 \times \text{Row 1} \implies \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 & -12 & -4 \end{bmatrix}
   \]

3. Eliminate the entry in the second column of Row 3 by subtracting \( 4 \times \text{Row 2} \) from Row 3:
   \[
   \text{Row 3} = \text{Row 3} - 4 \times \text{Row 2} \implies \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
   \]

4. Eliminate the entry in the second column of Row 4 by adding Row 2 to Row 4:
   \[
   \text{Row 4} = \text{Row 4} + \text{Row 2} \implies \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}
   \]

The matrix now looks like:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 1 & -3 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve \( A\mathbf{x} = 0 \)
From the reduced matrix, the equations are:
1. \( x + 2z + 4w = 0 \)
2. \( y - 3z - w = 0 \)
3. \( 3w = 0 \)

From \( 3w = 0 \), we get \( w = 0 \). Substituting \( w = 0 \) into the other equations:
- \( x = -2z \)
- \( y = 3z \)

Thus, the general solution is:
\[
\mathbf{x} = z \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad z \in \mathbb{R}
\]

This means the kernel is spanned by the vector \( \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 3: Match with Options
The vector \( \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) matches option **J**.
