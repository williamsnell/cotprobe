Question:

Suppose that the four firms in an oligopoly are getting togetherto collude. How might ease of entry into their industryaffect how high they set their prices?

Options:

A: Prices should be set based on the average industry price, regardless of entry difficulty.
B: Prices should not be set so high as to attract too many new entrants.
C: High entry barriers will allow firms to set lower prices.
D: Prices can be set arbitrarily as new entrants will always be matched in price.
E: More firms entering the market will strengthen the oligopoly.
F: Prices should be lowered to the cost of production to deter new entrants.
G: Prices should be set extremely high to earn large profits.
H: Firms should focus on increasing market share instead of setting prices.
I: The ease of entry is directly proportional to the level of price increase.
J: Ease of entry doesn't affect price setting.

Okay, so I've got this economics question about oligopolies and how the ease of entry into an industry affects the prices set by colluding firms. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that an oligopoly is a market structure where a few firms dominate the industry. When these firms collude, they're essentially acting like a monopoly, trying to maximize their joint profits. But unlike a monopoly, oligopolies face the challenge of maintaining their collusion because each firm might be tempted to cheat to increase its own profit.

Now, the question is about how easy it is for new firms to enter the industry. Ease of entry would mean that there are low barriers to entry, like no significant start-up costs, no patents, or no other restrictions that prevent new companies from joining the market.

If entry is easy, what does that mean for the existing firms? Well, if the colluding firms set their prices too high, they might attract new entrants. New firms would see the high profits and decide to enter the market to get a share of those profits. This is a problem because more firms entering the market would increase competition. That could drive prices down and reduce the profits each firm makes.

So, the colluding firms need to be careful about setting their prices. They want to maximize their profits, but if they set prices too high, new firms will come in, undermining their collusion. Therefore, the firms should set prices at a level that's profitable but not so high that it encourages new entry. This balance is crucial for maintaining their oligopolistic profits without attracting competition.

Looking at the options:

Option B says prices shouldn't be set so high to attract too many new entrants. That makes sense because high prices would encourage entry, which would break the collusion.

Option G suggests setting prices extremely high, which would definitely attract entrants, so that's not good.

Option I talks about ease of entry being proportional to price increases. I'm not sure about that. It might be the case, but I think the key point is that high prices attract entry, so the firms would limit their price increases to avoid that.

Option F says lower prices to deter entry, but lower prices would mean less profit, which isn't ideal for the colluding firms. They might aim for a middle ground.

Option J says ease of entry doesn't affect price setting, which doesn't seem right because entry barriers are a key factor in oligopoly behavior.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be B. The firms should avoid setting prices too high to prevent new entrants from joining the market.

In an oligopoly where firms collude, the ease of entry into the industry plays a crucial role in determining the prices set by the firms. If entry is easy, new firms can quickly join the market in response to high prices, increasing competition and reducing profits for the existing firms. Therefore, colluding firms must balance their pricing to maximize profits while avoiding levels that attract new entrants. 

Option B correctly captures this dynamic, as it emphasizes that prices should not be set so high that they encourage too many new entrants, which would undermine the oligopoly's profitability. Other options either misrepresent the relationship between entry and pricing or fail to address the strategic balance required.

Answer: B
