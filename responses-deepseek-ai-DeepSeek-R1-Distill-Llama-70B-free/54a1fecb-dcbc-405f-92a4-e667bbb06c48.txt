The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

You are in your laboratory late one night, working with eight separate containers holding the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Three of the containers hold beetles homozygous for ebony bodies. The remaining five containers hold beetles homozygous for red bodies. Suddenly, the lights in your lab go out. You decide to remove your beetles to another lab so you can continue your work. If you can carry only one container at a time, what is the probability that the first container you select in the darkness contains homozygous ebony beetles and the second container contains homozygous red?

Options:

A: 0.438
B: 0.178
C: 0.358
D: 0.125
E: 0.375
F: 0.268
G: 0.525
H: 0.488
I: 0.225
J: 0.625

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

So, there are eight containers in the lab. Three of them have beetles that are homozygous for ebony bodies, and five have homozygous red bodies. The lights go out, so I can't see what I'm doing. I need to carry one container at a time, and I want to find the probability that the first container I pick has the ebony beetles, and the second one has the red beetles.

Hmm, right. So the problem is about probability without replacement because once I take the first container, it's not going back before I take the second. So the two events are dependent. 

Let me break it down. The first part is the probability that the first container is ebony. There are 3 ebony containers out of 8 total. So the probability for that is 3/8. 

Now the second part is the probability that the second container is red. But wait, since I already took one container (the first one), there are now 7 left. But I have to consider what the first container was. Oh wait, the first was ebony, so the number of red containers remains 5, but the total is 7 now. So the second probability would be 5/7.

So the total probability is the product of these two probabilities. That would be (3/8) multiplied by (5/7). Let me calculate that. 3 times 5 is 15, and 8 times 7 is 56. So 15/56. What's 15 divided by 56? Let me do that division. 

56 goes into 15 zero times. So 0. and then 56 into 150. 56*2=112, so 2, subtract 112 from 150, get 38. Bring down the next 0: 380. 56*6=336, subtract gives 44. Bring down 0: 440. 56*7=392. 440-392=48. Bring down 0: 480. 56*8=448. 480-448=32. Hmm, this is getting a bit long, but I think it's around 0.2678... So approximately 0.268.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.268. So I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another way to think about it: the total number of ways to pick two containers where the first is ebony and the second is red. The number of favorable outcomes is 3 (ebony) multiplied by 5 (red), which is 15. The total possible outcomes for picking two containers in order is 8 *7 =56. So 15/56 is indeed the probability. Yep, that's 0.2678, which rounds to 0.268. So the correct answer is F.

To determine the probability that the first container selected contains homozygous ebony beetles and the second contains homozygous red beetles, we start by noting that there are 3 ebony containers and 5 red containers out of a total of 8 containers. Since the selection is without replacement, the two events are dependent.

1. **Probability of selecting an ebony container first**:  
   There are 3 ebony containers out of 8, so the probability is:  
   \[
   P(\text{first is ebony}) = \frac{3}{8}
   \]

2. **Probability of selecting a red container second**:  
   After removing one ebony container, there are 7 containers left, with 5 still being red. Thus, the probability is:  
   \[
   P(\text{second is red}) = \frac{5}{7}
   \]

3. **Total probability**:  
   Since the events are dependent, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities:  
   \[
   P(\text{first ebony and second red}) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{56}
   \]

4. **Numerical value**:  
   Converting \(\frac{15}{56}\) to a decimal gives approximately \(0.2678\), which rounds to \(0.268\).

From the given options, the closest match is **F: 0.268**.
