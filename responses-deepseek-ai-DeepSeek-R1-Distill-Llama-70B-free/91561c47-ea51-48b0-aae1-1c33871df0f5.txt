Okay, so I've got this question about how the United States government defines poverty. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option best describes the government's definition of poverty. The options are A through J. I remember that the way poverty is measured can be either absolute or relative. Absolute poverty is like a fixed standard, while relative is based on what others have.

Wait, the U.S. uses something called the poverty threshold, right? I think it was developed in the 1960s by Mollie Orshansky. She based it on the cost of a minimum food diet and multiplied by three because food was about a third of a family's budget back then. So that sounds like an absolute measure because it's a fixed standard, not relative to others' income.

So looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Relative deprivation based on income distribution changes. No, I think that's more of a relative measure. The U.S. doesn't use relative; it's an absolute measure.

Option B: Absolute level set in the 1960s, adjusted for inflation. That fits what I was thinking. The original threshold was set in the 60s and each year it's updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). So this seems correct.

Option C: Fixed income unchanged since 1960s. No, because each year it's adjusted for inflation, so it's not unchanged. So C is wrong.

Option D: Government services index. Doesn't sound right. Poverty is about income, not services provided.

Option E: Fluctuates based on economic health. I don't think so. It's based on inflation, not the overall economy's health like GDP or recession.

Option F: Set in 80s, adjusted by stock market. No, the base was 1960s, and adjustments are for inflation, not stock market.

Option G: Inability to afford basics regardless of income. That's more of a description of poverty in general, but the official measure is based on income levels. So G is not the best fit.

Option H: Based on lifestyle and sliding scale. No, the U.S. measure is a set threshold, not varying by individual lifestyle needs.

Option I: Varies by state and local. While cost of living varies, the federal poverty level is a national standard, though some programs adjust it for local costs. But the definition itself is national.

Option J: Based on national average income. That would be a relative measure. The U.S. uses an absolute measure, not relative to average income.

So the best answer should be option B.

The United States government defines poverty using an absolute measure based on a threshold set in the 1960s, which is annually adjusted for inflation. This approach, developed by Mollie Orshansky, calculates the poverty line as three times the cost of a minimum food diet. While the threshold is updated each year to reflect inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), it remains an absolute standard rather than a relative measure tied to income distribution or economic conditions.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. This describes relative deprivation, not the U.S. definition.
- **B**: Correct. The poverty threshold is set in the 1960s and adjusted for inflation annually.
- **C**: Incorrect. The threshold is updated for inflation, so it's not unchanged.
- **D**: Incorrect. Poverty is defined by income, not government services.
- **E**: Incorrect. Adjustments are based on inflation, not overall economic health.
- **F**: Incorrect. The base year is the 1960s, and adjustments are for inflation, not the stock market.
- **G**: Incorrect. While describing poverty, it doesn't match the official income-based definition.
- **H**: Incorrect. The U.S. measure is a fixed threshold, not based on lifestyle.
- **I**: Incorrect. The federal poverty level is national, though some programs adjust it locally.
- **J**: Incorrect. This refers to relative poverty, not the U.S. absolute measure.

The best answer is **B**.

Answer: B
