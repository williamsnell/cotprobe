Okay, so I have this problem here about markup and finding the cost of stock. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Find the cost in dollars of $200,000 worth of stock at retail if the markup is 30% of selling price. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, markup can be a bit tricky because it's based on either the cost price or the selling price. I remember that sometimes markup is calculated on cost, and sometimes on selling price. So I need to clarify that first.

The problem states that the markup is 30% of the selling price. So, that's important. So the markup is based on SP, not cost. 

Let me think about what that means. The markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So, if the markup is 30% of SP, then:

Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Markup.

And Markup here is 30% of SP. So:

SP = CP + (0.30 * SP)

Hmm, I can rearrange this equation to solve for CP. Let's try that.

SP = CP + 0.30 * SP

Subtract 0.30 SP from both sides:

SP - 0.30 SP = CP

Which simplifies to:

0.70 SP = CP

So, CP = 0.70 * SP

Wait, but in the problem, the SP is $200,000. Because the question says "$200,000 worth of stock at retail", so that's the selling price. So SP is $200,000.

So substituting:

CP = 0.70 * 200,000 = 140,000.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is $140,000. So that's the cost price.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up markup based on cost or selling price.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: If the markup is 30% of SP, then the markup is 0.3 * SP. So SP is CP plus this markup.

So SP = CP + 0.3 SP → which again leads to CP = 0.7 SP.

Yes, that seems correct. So the cost is 70% of the selling price.

So for SP being $200,000, CP is 0.7 * 200,000 = 140,000. So the cost is $140,000.

Looking at the options, option C is $140,000. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to approach it is to express everything in terms of CP.

If the markup is 30% of SP, then markup = 0.3 SP. But markup can also be expressed as SP - CP. So:

SP - CP = 0.3 SP → CP = SP - 0.3 SP = 0.7 SP. Yep, same result.

So the cost is 70% of $200,000, which is $140,000. So option C is correct.

The problem involves determining the cost price (CP) of $200,000 worth of stock at retail, given that the markup is 30% of the selling price (SP). 

Markup is defined as the amount added to the cost price to arrive at the selling price. Since the markup is based on the selling price, it can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Markup} = 0.30 \times \text{SP}
\]

The relationship between the selling price, cost price, and markup is:

\[
\text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Markup}
\]

Substituting the expression for markup:

\[
\text{SP} = \text{CP} + 0.30 \times \text{SP}
\]

Rearranging to solve for CP:

\[
\text{SP} - 0.30 \times \text{SP} = \text{CP}
\]

\[
0.70 \times \text{SP} = \text{CP}
\]

Given that the selling price (SP) is $200,000, the cost price (CP) can be calculated as:

\[
\text{CP} = 0.70 \times 200,000 = 140,000
\]

Thus, the cost price is $140,000. Among the provided options, the correct answer is:

**C: $140,000**

Answer: C
