Okay, so I've got this nozzle problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem states that we have a nozzle with an efficiency of 90%. The initial conditions are a pressure of 60 psia and a temperature of 1500°R. The mass flow rate is 0.6 lb/sec, and the exit pressure is 14.696 psia, which I think is standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. So this is probably a nozzle expanding air from a higher pressure to atmospheric pressure.

I remember that nozzles can be converging, diverging, or converging-diverging, depending on the application. Since the exit pressure is lower than the throat pressure in this case, I think it's a converging-diverging nozzle. Wait, no, wait. The throat is the point where the Mach number is 1 in a CD nozzle. If the exit pressure is less than the critical pressure (which is at the throat), then it's a CD nozzle. Otherwise, it's just a converging nozzle.

But first, I need to figure out what the throat area and exit area are, and the exit Mach number. The options give me various possibilities, so I'll need to compute these values.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Nozzle efficiency (η) = 90% or 0.9. I think this relates the actual nozzle performance to the ideal isentropic case. So η would be the ratio of actual kinetic energy to the ideal kinetic energy, which affects the exit velocity.

Wait, or is it based on the specific impulse or something else? Hmm. I think for nozzles, efficiency is often used in terms of the velocity coefficient, which is the ratio of actual exit velocity to the ideal exit velocity. So maybe η is the velocity coefficient here.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, sometimes nozzle efficiency is defined based on the comparison of the actual and ideal specific impulse. I'll need to clarify that. For now, I'll assume that the efficiency affects the exit velocity, so the actual velocity is η times the ideal velocity.

Wait, but in the isentropic case, the exit velocity can be calculated using the Stagnation Pressure and Temperature. Since the efficiency is less than 100%, the actual exit velocity will be less than the isentropic value. So I need to compute the ideal exit state and then adjust it with the efficiency.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Determine whether the flow is subsonic or supersonic at the exit. This will depend on the exit pressure and the pressure at the throat (which is the critical pressure for a CD nozzle).

2. Calculate the throat area using the mass flow rate and the stagnation conditions.

3. Calculate the exit area based on the exit pressure and the isentropic relations, considering the efficiency.

Wait, but maybe I should first compute the stagnation properties. The stagnation temperature is given as 1500 R, and the stagnation pressure is 60 psia.

I'll need to compute the mass flow parameter at the throat, which for choked flow (M=1) is given by:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / (sqrt(T0)) ) * sqrt(γ/(R)) * (1/( (1 + (γ-1)/2 * M^2 )^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) )) )) 

Wait, no, that's for isentropic flow. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for mass flow through a choked throat, which is:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / sqrt(T0) ) * sqrt( γ/(R) ) * ( sqrt( 2/(γ+1) ) )

Wait, maybe I should recall the mass flow rate equation for a nozzle. For a choked nozzle (M=1 at throat), the mass flow rate is:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / sqrt(T0) ) * ( sqrt( γ/(R) ) ) * sqrt( (2)/(γ+1) ) )

Wait, let me think more carefully. The general isentropic mass flow equation is:

m_dot = (P0 * A) / sqrt(T0) ) * sqrt( γ/(R) ) * ( M / ( 1 + ( (γ-1)/2 ) M^2 )^((γ+1)/(2(γ-1))) ) )

At the throat, M=1, so substituting that gives:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / sqrt(T0) ) * sqrt( γ/(R) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 + (γ-1)/2 )^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) ) )

But (γ-1)/2 + 1 is (γ+1)/2, so the denominator becomes ( (γ+1)/2 )^( (γ+1)/(γ-1) * 1/2 ) )

Wait, because (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) is the exponent. Let me compute that denominator term.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the mass flow parameter as:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / (sqrt(T0)) ) * ( sqrt( γ/(R) ) ) * (1 / ( ( (γ+1)/2 )^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) )) )

Wait, perhaps I can look up the expression for the choked mass flow rate.

Alternatively, I remember that for an ideal gas, the mass flow rate through a choked nozzle (M=1 at throat) can be written as:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / (sqrt(T0)) ) * ( sqrt( γ/(R) ) ) * ( sqrt(2/(γ+1)) )

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the mass flow rate can be expressed as:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / sqrt(T0) ) * sqrt( (γ)/(R) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (γ-1)/2 )^((γ+1)/(2(γ-1))) )) )

Wait, another approach is to compute the stagnation sound speed, and then use the equation m_dot = P0 * A_throat / (a0) ) * (sqrt( γ/(2*(γ+1)) )) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the stagnation sound speed a0 first.

The sound speed a is sqrt( γ R T ). So, for stagnation conditions, a0 = sqrt( γ R T0 )

Given T0 is 1500 R.

Wait, what is the value of γ (gamma) for air? I think γ for air is approximately 1.4.

R, the specific gas constant for air, is 1716 ft·lbf/(lb·R) or something like that. Wait, but I think when using units consistently, R is 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R). Hmm, but I might need to be careful with units here.

Wait, the units given are in psia, lb/sec, etc. So I probably need to use the correct value for R in consistent units.

Wait, let me list the constants:

γ = 1.4 for air.

R = 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R). Wait, but wait, 1 slug is 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So R = 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R) = 1716 / 32.174 lb·ft/(lb·R) → approx 53.35 ft·lb/(lb·R). Wait, but perhaps I'm complicating things. Another approach is to use R = 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R) and then convert mass flow rate from lb/sec to slugs/sec.

Wait, 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, so to convert lb to slugs, you divide by 32.174 lb·s²/ft. But when dealing with mass flow rate, which is lb/sec, converting to slugs/sec would be (lb/sec) / 32.174 lb·s²/ft → slug/(s²·ft). Hmm, perhaps that's getting a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should use R in different units.

Wait, another approach: when using the mass flow rate in lb/sec, pressure in psia, and area in square feet, the units can be handled with R in (ft·lbf)/(lb·R). Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on units here. Maybe I can find the formula in terms that I can manage without getting too bogged down in unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps I can use the following approach:

The mass flow rate for a choked nozzle is given by:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / (sqrt(T0)) ) * (sqrt( γ/(R) )) * (1 / ( (1 + (γ-1)/2 )^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) )) )

But let me compute that denominator term. For γ=1.4:

(γ-1)/2 = 0.2; (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) = (2.4)/(0.4) )=6. So denominator is (1.2)^6.

Wait, 1.2^6: 1.2^2=1.44; 1.2^4= (1.44)^2≈2.0736; 1.2^6= 1.44 * 2.0736 ≈ 2.985984.

So denominator term is 2.985984.

So sqrt(γ/R) would be sqrt(1.4/R). But what is R? For air, R is 1716 ft·lb/(slug·R). But I'm trying to get the units right.

Wait, perhaps I can use the mass flow rate equation with the stagnation conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the mass flow parameter as:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / sqrt(T0) ) * (1 / (sqrt(R*T0)) ) * (sqrt(γ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (γ-1)/2 )^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) )) )

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should instead compute the throat area first.

Wait, the mass flow rate is 0.6 lb/sec. So m_dot = 0.6 lb/s.

Let me write the formula for m_dot in terms of the stagnation conditions and the throat area.

At the throat, M=1, so the mass flow per unit area is m_dot/A = (P0 / (sqrt(T0))) * (sqrt(γ/(R)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (γ-1)/2 )^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) )) )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the throat area as:

A_throat = m_dot * sqrt(T0) / ( P0 * C ), where C is the constant involving gamma and R.

Hmm. Alternatively, another formula I recall is:

m_dot = (P0 * A_throat) / (sqrt(T0)) ) * ( sqrt( γ/(R) ) ) * ( sqrt( 2/(γ+1) ) )

Wait, perhaps that's the formula. Let me check the dimensions. If P0 is in psia, A in ft², T0 in °R, R in ft·lb/(slug·°R), then the units might not match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula in terms of the stagnation sound speed a0.

The mass flow rate for a choked nozzle is m_dot = (A_throat * P0) / (a0) ) * (1 / sqrt(γ) ) * ( sqrt(2/(γ+1)) )

Wait, perhaps that's another version. Alternatively, the mass flow rate can be written as:

m_dot = (A_throat * P0) / sqrt(γ R T0) ) * sqrt( 2/(γ+1) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should think about the ideal case first, then adjust for efficiency.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the ideal mass flow rate (assuming 100% efficiency) and then see how efficiency affects it, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency affects the exit velocity, so the actual exit velocity is η times the ideal velocity. But the mass flow rate is based on the actual velocity.

But I think the mass flow rate is given as 0.6 lb/sec, which is the actual mass flow rate. So perhaps I should compute the throat area based on the actual conditions.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the throat area using the ideal (isentropic) conditions and then adjust for efficiency. Or maybe the efficiency affects the exit velocity but not the throat area, since the throat is at M=1 and that's an isentropic point.

Wait, no. The efficiency would affect the actual exit velocity, but the throat area is determined by the mass flow rate and the stagnation conditions. So perhaps the throat area can be found using the isentropic relations.

So, to find the throat area A*, I'll use the isentropic mass flow formula.

The formula is:

m_dot = (P0 * A*) / sqrt(T0) ) * sqrt( γ/(R) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (γ-1)/2 )^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) ) )

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

Given:
- m_dot = 0.6 lb/s
- P0 = 60 psia
- T0 = 1500 R
- γ = 1.4
- R for air is 1716 ft·lb/(slug·°R)

Wait, but the units here are tricky. Because m_dot is in lb/s, R is in ft·lb/(slug·°R). So I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert the mass flow rate to slug/s. Since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, then 1 lb/s = 1/(32.174) slug/(s·ft). Wait, no, I think 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, so 1 lb = 1/(32.174) slugs·ft/s². So to convert lb/s to slug/s, you divide by 32.174 lb·s²/ft. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value without worrying too much about units, but that's risky. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the value in terms of units that cancel out.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in consistent units. Let's try.

First, let's compute the mass flow rate in slugs per second.

1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft → so 1 lb = 1/(32.174) slug·s²/ft. Therefore, 1 lb/s = (1 slug·s²/ft) ) / 32.174 s → slug/(ft·s). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the mass flow rate in lb/s as is and use R in appropriate units.

Wait, R is 1716 ft·lb/(slug·°R). So, when using m_dot in lb/s, perhaps we need to convert it to slug/s. Because 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, so 1 lb/s = (1 lb/s) / (32.174 lb·s²/ft) ) → 1/(32.174 s) slugs/ft.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the mass flow rate in slugs per second is m_dot (lb/s) divided by 32.174 lb·s²/ft → which would give m_dot (slug/s²/ft). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed by plugging in the numbers as they are and see if the units work out.

Let me compute the denominator term first. For γ=1.4, the denominator is (1 + (γ-1)/2 )^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) )

As computed earlier, that's (1.2)^6 ≈ 2.985984.

Now, the sqrt(γ/R) term:

sqrt(1.4 / 1716) → let me compute 1.4 / 1716 ≈ 0.000816. The square root of that is approx 0.02856.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.4 ÷ 1716 = approx 0.000816. So sqrt(0.000816) ≈ 0.02856 s·ft^(1/2)·lb^{-1}·slug^{-1}·°R^{-1/2} or something? I'm not sure about the units here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this without worrying about units, but I'm not confident. Maybe I can proceed numerically.

So, sqrt(γ/R) = sqrt(1.4/1716) ≈ sqrt(0.000816) ≈ 0.02856.

So, putting it all together:

m_dot = (P0 * A*) / sqrt(T0) ) * (sqrt(γ/R)) / (denominator term)

Wait, no, the formula is:

m_dot = (P0 * A*) / sqrt(T0) ) * [ sqrt(γ/R) / denominator ]

So, rearranged, A* = [ m_dot * sqrt(T0) * denominator ] / [ P0 * sqrt(γ/R) ) ]

Plugging the numbers:

m_dot = 0.6 lb/s

sqrt(T0) = sqrt(1500) ≈ 38.7298 °R^0.5

denominator ≈ 2.985984

P0 = 60 psia

sqrt(γ/R) ≈ 0.02856 (as computed)

So,

A* = (0.6 * 38.7298 * 2.985984) / (60 * 0.02856 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 0.6 * 38.7298 ≈ 23.2379; 23.2379 * 2.985984 ≈ let's compute 23 * 3 ≈69, but more accurately: 23.2379 * 3 ≈69.7137, but since it's 2.986, 69.7137 - (0.014 *23.2379) ≈ 69.7137 - 0.3253 ≈69.3884.

Denominator: 60 * 0.02856 ≈1.7136.

So A* ≈ 69.3884 / 1.7136 ≈ approx 40.52.

Wait, but
