Okay, so I'm trying to solve this shunt motor problem. Hmm, I remember that shunt motors have the armature and field windings connected in parallel. So the field current is separate from the armature current.

The problem gives me a 115-volt shunt motor. The armature resistance is 0.22 ohms. There's a voltage of 2 volts across the brush contacts. I need to find the armature current in two cases: when the counteremf is 108 volts and when it drops to 106 volts.

Wait, counteremf is the back EMF in the armature, right? So the armature current can be found using the formula I = (V - E)/R, where V is the applied voltage across the armature, E is the counteremf, and R is the armature resistance.

But wait, the motor's terminal voltage is 115 volts. But the brush contacts have 2 volts across them. Oh, I think that means the voltage applied to the armature is less than the terminal voltage. Because in a shunt motor, the field windings are across the terminal voltage, and the armature is also across the same voltage. But wait, the brush voltage is 2 volts? Or is it the drop in the brush?

Wait, maybe the voltage across the brush contacts is the voltage drop, so that the armature voltage is less than the supply voltage. So the armature voltage would be 115V minus 2V, which is 113V? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. I think that when current passes through the brushes, there's a voltage drop. So the voltage available at the armature terminals (the brush contacts) is 2 volts less than the supply. So the armature voltage V would be 115V - 2V = 113V. So V = 113 volts.

Alternatively, if the supply is 115V, but the brush contacts have a 2V drop, then the armature's applied voltage is 115 - 2 = 113V.

So for part (a) where the counteremf E is 108V, the armature current Ia is (V - E) / R. So that's (113 - 108) / 0.22.

Let me calculate that. 113-108 is 5. 5 divided by 0.22 is approximately 22.727 Amps. Wait, but looking at the options, that's not one of the first numbers. Hmm, because the options have two different currents for each part.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The applied voltage to the armature is 115 volts? Or is it 115 volts minus the brush drop?

Wait, shunt motors have the field and armature connected in parallel. So the field is across the supply voltage, which is 115V. But the armature is also across the same supply. However, the brushes have a voltage drop, so the effective voltage on the armature is 115V minus the drop. So V_armature = 115V - 2V = 113V.

So yes, that's correct. So in part (a), E = 108 V.

Ia = (113 - 108) / 0.22 = 5 / 0.22 ≈ 22.727 A.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option G is 22.7 and 31.8. Option E is 23.5 and 32.5. Hmm. So part (a) would be 22.7 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option has two values. So part (a) is the first value, part (b) the second. So looking for an option where the first value is approximately 22.7.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 22.7 amp and 31.8 amp.

Option I: 24.8 and 33.9.

So G is a candidate.

Wait, but let's proceed to part (b) to see. In part (b), the counteremf drops to 106 volts. So E is 106 V.

Ia = (113 - 106) / 0.22 = 7 / 0.22 ≈ 31.818 A.

So approximately 31.8 Amps, which is the second value in option G.

So that would make option G the correct choice, with (a) 22.7 and (b)31.8.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait another thing: Oh, wait a second. The problem says the armature resistance is 0.22 ohms, and the voltage across the brush contacts is 2 volts. Does that mean the brush drop is 2 volts, so the armature voltage is 115 - 2 = 113 V?

Yes, that's correct. So armature voltage is 113 V.

So for part (a), Ia = (113-108)/0.22 = 5/0.22 ≈ 22.727 A.

For part (b), Ia = (113-106)/0.22 = 7/0.22 ≈ 31.818 A.

Looking at the options, option G matches these exactly. So the answer should be option G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the shunt motor's armature current in two scenarios using the formula:

\[
I_a = \frac{V - E}{R}
\]

where:  
- \( V \) is the effective voltage across the armature,  
- \( E \) is the counteremf (back EMF),  
- \( R \) is the armature resistance.

### Given Data:
- Terminal voltage = 115 V  
- Voltage drop across brush contacts = 2 V  
- Armature resistance (\( R \)) = 0.22 \( \Omega \)  
- Counteremf (\( E \)) for part (a) = 108 V  
- Counteremf (\( E \)) for part (b) = 106 V  

The effective voltage across the armature is reduced by the brush drop, so:

\[
V_{\text{armature}} = 115 - 2 = 113 \, \text{V}
\]

### Part (a):  
Using \( E = 108 \, \text{V} \):  

\[
I_a = \frac{113 - 108}{0.22} = \frac{5}{0.22} \approx 22.7 \, \text{A}
\]

### Part (b):  
Using \( E = 106 \, \text{V} \):  

\[
I_a = \frac{113 - 106}{0.22} = \frac{7}{0.22} \approx 31.8 \, \text{A}
\]

### Matching with Options:
The calculated currents for part (a) and part (b) are approximately **22.7 A** and **31.8 A**, respectively. These values match **Option G**.
