Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the derivative of the inverse function g'(1), and the function given is f(x) = x + cos(x). Hmm, I remember that when dealing with inverse functions, there's a specific rule for differentiation. Let me think... Oh right, the derivative of the inverse function g at a point y is 1 divided by the derivative of f at the corresponding x point. So, g'(y) = 1 / f'(x), where x is g(y).

Wait, so in this case, since we're looking for g'(1), that means y is 1. So I need to find f'(x) evaluated at x = g(1). But wait, what's g(1)? Oh right, because g is the inverse of f, g(1) is the x such that f(x) = 1. So f(x) = x + cos(x) = 1. I need to solve for x here.

Solving x + cos(x) = 1... Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I can make an educated guess. Let's try plugging in x = 0: 0 + cos(0) = 0 + 1 = 1. Oh, perfect! So x=0 is the solution. So g(1) = 0.

Now, I need to find f'(x) at x=0. Let's compute f'(x). The derivative of x is 1, and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). So f'(x) = 1 - sin(x). Plugging in x=0: 1 - sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1.

So f'(0) = 1. Then, g'(1) is 1 divided by f'(0), which is 1/1 = 1. Wait, but let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is g'(y) = 1 / f'(g(y)), right? So since y is 1, and g(1) is 0, it's 1 over f'(0), which is 1. So yes, g'(1) is 1.

Looking at the options, option C is 1. So the answer should be C.

To find \( g'(1) \), where \( g(x) \) is the inverse of \( f(x) = x + \cos(x) \), we use the inverse function theorem. The theorem states that \( g'(y) = \frac{1}{f'(x)} \), where \( x = g(y) \).

1. **Find \( g(1) \):** Since \( g \) is the inverse of \( f \), \( g(1) \) is the value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 1 \). Solving \( x + \cos(x) = 1 \), we test \( x = 0 \):  
   \[
   f(0) = 0 + \cos(0) = 1.
   \]  
   Thus, \( g(1) = 0 \).

2. **Compute \( f'(x) \):** The derivative of \( f(x) = x + \cos(x) \) is:  
   \[
   f'(x) = 1 - \sin(x).
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f'(x) \) at \( x = g(1) = 0 \):**  
   \[
   f'(0) = 1 - \sin(0) = 1.
   \]

4. **Find \( g'(1) \):** Using the inverse function theorem,  
   \[
   g'(1) = \frac{1}{f'(0)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
   \]

Thus, the answer is \( 1 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
