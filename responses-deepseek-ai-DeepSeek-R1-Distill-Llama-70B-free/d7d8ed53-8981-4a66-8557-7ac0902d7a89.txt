Okay, let me try to figure out Mary's earnings for the week. So, from what I understand, Mary has a sales quota of $900, and she sold $1,200. Her earnings come from a base salary plus commission.

First, I know she gets a weekly salary of $80. That's straightforward. Then, there's the commission part. The commission is 5% on all her sales. But wait, there's also an additional 2.5% on the sales that are over her quota. Hmm, I need to break this down.

So, her total sales are $1,200, which is more than her quota of $900. That means she has two parts to her commission: the regular 5% on the first $900 and then an extra 2.5% on the amount she exceeded the quota.

Let me calculate each part step by step. 

First, the regular commission on $900. 5% of 900 is 0.05 * 900. Let me compute that: 0.05 times 900 is $45. So that's the first part of the commission.

Next, the amount she sold over the quota is $1,200 - $900 = $300. On this $300, she gets an additional 2.5% commission. Wait, the question says 2(1/2)%, which is 2.5%. So, 2.5% of 300 is 0.025 * 300. Let's see: 0.025 times 300 is $7.50.

So, adding those two commission parts together: $45 + $7.50 = $52.50.

Now, add her base salary of $80 to the total commission. So, $80 + $52.50 equals $132.50. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see $132.50. Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait a second, let me double-check the commission structure. Oh, wait, perhaps I misunderstood. Maybe the commission is 5% on all sales, including those over the quota, and then an additional 2.5% on the amount over the quota. So that would mean she gets 5% on the entire $1,200 plus 2.5% on the $300 over.

Wait, that changes things. Let me recalculate that way.

So first, 5% of $1,200 is 0.05 * 1200 = $60. Then, 2.5% on the $300 over the quota: 0.025 * 300 = $7.50. So total commission is $60 + $7.50 = $67.50. Then add the base salary: $80 + $67.50 = $147.50.

Looking at the options, option J is $147.50. So that must be the correct answer.

Mary Rogers' earnings for the week are calculated as follows:

1. **Base Salary**: $80 (fixed weekly salary).

2. **Commission on total sales**: 5% of $1,200 = $60.

3. **Additional commission on sales over quota**: 2.5% of ($1,200 - $900) = 2.5% of $300 = $7.50.

Adding these together:  
$80 (salary) + $60 (commission) + $7.50 (additional commission) = **$147.50**.

The correct answer is **J: $147.50**.
