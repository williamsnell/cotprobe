Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Hendricks borrowing money from the bank. Let me try to understand what's being asked. He borrowed $5,000 with a fixed mortgage. The interest rate is 5% yearly, and he's paying in semiannual installments. The mortgage is due in twenty years. The question is, how much interest is due every six months?

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with loans and interest, there are different ways to calculate payments. Since he's paying semiannually, that means every six months. The interest is probably calculated each period.

Wait, the annual interest rate is 5%. So each year, the interest would be 5% of $5,000. Let me calculate that. 5% of 5000 is 0.05 * 5000, which is $250. But wait, he's paying every six months, so would that mean the interest is half of that each time? Because the payments are semiannual. 

So if the annual interest is $250, then every six months, he would pay half, which is $125. But wait, is it that simple? Or is there something else I'm missing because the mortgage is over twenty years?

Wait, no, the mortgage term is twenty years, but the question is just about the interest due every six months. Oh, because the interest is calculated each period. So if the interest is 5% per annum, then each semiannual period would have a rate of 5% divided by 2, which is 2.5%. 

So the interest each six months would be 2.5% of the principal. The principal is $5,000. So 0.025 * 5000 equals $125. 

Wait, but I should make sure if the interest is simple or compounded. Typically, mortgages can be either. But since this is a fixed mortgage and the payment is semiannual, I think it's more likely that each payment includes interest for the period. So each payment would have the same interest amount, right?

Alternatively, if the interest were compounded, the calculation might be a bit different, but I think in this case, since it's a fixed payment plan, each installment's interest is calculated on the outstanding principal. But wait, wait. If he's paying every six months, the principal would decrease each time, so the interest would also decrease over time. But the question is asking how much interest is due every six months. Does it mean the first payment's interest, or an average?

Wait, the question says, "how much interest is due every six months?" So perhaps it's asking for the interest portion of each installment. But in an amortizing loan, each payment includes both principal and interest, and the interest part decreases each period as the principal is paid down. But the question might be simplifying it by asking for each payment's interest, but perhaps under the fixed mortgage, each payment is the same, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating it as simple interest, where each six months, the interest is just 5% divided by 2 on the initial principal. So that would be 2.5% of $5,000, which is $125. So each payment's interest is $125, but wait, that's only the interest part. But the installments would include both principal and interest.

Wait wait, the question is asking specifically "how much interest is due every six months?" So it's just the interest portion each time. If it's simple interest, then yes, each six months it's 2.5% of 5,000, which is $125. So the answer would be $125, which is option I.

But let me think again. Sometimes, with mortgages, each payment is calculated based on the remaining principal, so the interest would decrease each period. But that would require knowing the exact payment structure, like whether it's an amortizing loan with equal payments. In that case, the first payment's interest would be higher, but subsequent ones would be lower. But the question isn't asking about the first payment; it's just asking in general.

Wait, no, the question is about each installment. So perhaps each payment includes the same amount of interest. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the formula for installment payments. The formula for the fixed monthly payment (or in this case, semiannual) is:

P = r * PV / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Where P is the payment, r is the periodic interest rate, PV is the present value (loan amount), and n is the number of periods.

But wait, the question is only asking about the interest part, not the principal. So perhaps each payment's interest is calculated on the outstanding principal at that time.

Wait, but if the payment is split into principal and interest, the interest part would be based on the remaining balance. So the first payment's interest would be higher, and each subsequent payment's interest part would be less as the principal decreases.

But the question is asking generally, how much interest is due every six months. So perhaps it's the initial interest, or the average. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering simple interest each period on the original principal.

Let me think about the total interest. The total amount paid over 20 years at 5% annually. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, another approach: The interest each period is (annual rate / number of periods) * principal. So that's 5% / 2 = 2.5% per period. So 0.025 * 5000 = $125. So the interest each six months is $125, which is option I.

Alternatively, if it's compounded semiannually, but the payment is each period, the interest each period would be calculated on the current principal. But in that case, the interest would decrease as the principal is paid down. But the question isn't asking about the varying amounts, just the per-period interest due. So perhaps it's considering each period's interest as 2.5% of the current principal.

Wait, but if it's a fixed mortgage, perhaps each payment is the same, comprising part principal and part interest. The interest part would decrease each time. But the question is about the interest due each six months, which would vary.

But the options given are fixed amounts, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute 5% annual, so each six months it's 2.5% of the principal. So $125. So the answer would be I: $125.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach is considering the annual interest as $250, and each payment is half, so $125. That seems straightforward.

So I think the correct answer is I: $125.

To determine how much interest is due every six months, we start by noting that Mr. Hendricks borrowed $5,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%. Since payments are made semiannually, the interest rate per period is half of the annual rate, which is:

\[
\text{Periodic Interest Rate} = \frac{5\%}{2} = 2.5\%
\]

The interest due every six months is calculated as 2.5% of the principal amount ($5,000):

\[
\text{Interest per Period} = 0.025 \times 5,000 = 125
\]

Thus, the interest due every six months is $125. This calculation assumes simple interest applied to the original principal for each period, as the question does not specify a need to account for changes in the principal over time due to amortization.

The correct answer is:

**I: $125**
