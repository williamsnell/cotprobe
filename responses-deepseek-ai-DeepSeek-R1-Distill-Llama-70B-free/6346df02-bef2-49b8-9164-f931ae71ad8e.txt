Question:

A defendant was angry at his friend for marrying the defendant's former girlfriend. As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?

Options:

A: The gun discharged accidentally.
B: The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.
C: He was under the influence of alcohol at the time.
D: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target.
E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention.
F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend.
G: He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.
H: He did not know the daughter was present.
I: He intended only to wound the friend.
J: He was unaware of the elements of malice.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it carefully. The question is about murder charges, specifically first-degree murder. The defendant shot at his friend but missed and killed the friend's daughter. He's charged with first-degree murder of the daughter. The statutes given are Section 169 and 170. 

Section 169 says that first-degree murder is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170 defines malice as expressed when there's a deliberate intention to take away the life of another.

The question is asking which fact, if established, would provide the defendant's best defense. The options are A through J.

So, I need to understand the elements of first-degree murder here. It's intentional killing with malice aforethought. Malice can be expressed or implied. Expressed malice is when there's a deliberate intent to kill, like in this case, if he intended to kill the friend, that's expressed malice. 

But the defendant didn't intend to kill the daughter; he was aiming at the friend. So, does that affect the malice? I know that in some jurisdictions, if you intend to kill one person and accidentally kill another, that's still murder under the doctrine of transferred intent. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, the question is about the best defense. So, what could negate the elements required for first-degree murder?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The gun discharged accidentally. If it was an accident, that might mean he didn't intend to shoot, so no malice. But the question says he fired a shot, so it's intentional. Accidental discharge might not fit.

Option B: Killing due to negligence. Negligence might be more relevant for manslaughter, not first-degree murder. But murder requires malice, so if the killing was just negligence, maybe it's not murder. But I'm not sure if that's the best defense here.

Option C: Under influence of alcohol. I don't think that's a defense to murder. Voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent, but murder might not require specific intent beyond intent to kill. Plus, the question is about first-degree murder, which requires deliberate intention.

Option D: Bullet deflected. So the bullet didn't hit the intended target. But under transferred intent, the intent to kill the friend would transfer to the daughter, making him guilty of murder. So this fact might not help.

Option E: Acting out of anger, not deliberate. But the statute says malice is when there's a deliberate intention. If he acted in anger without deliberation, maybe it's not first-degree. But I'm not sure if anger without deliberation negates malice. Some jurisdictions require premeditation for first-degree, but the question doesn't specify that. The statute here just requires intentional killing with malice, which is deliberate intent.

Option F: Intended to scare, not kill. So he didn't intend to kill anyone. If that's the case, then there's no expressed malice. But if he fired a gun at someone, that could be considered an intent to kill or at least an act with reckless disregard, which might imply malice. But if he only intended to scare, maybe he lacked the deliberate intent to kill, which would negate the malice required for first-degree murder.

Option G: Intended to kill friend, not daughter. But under transferred intent doctrine, the intent transfers, so the killing of the daughter would still be murder. This might not help as a defense.

Option H: Didn't know daughter was present. Similar to G, if he didn't know she was there, but he intended to kill the friend, the transferred intent would still apply. So this might not be a good defense.

Option I: Intended only to wound the friend. If he intended to wound, not kill, then maybe the malice isn't expressed. Because expressed malice requires intent to kill. So if he only intended to wound, perhaps it's not first-degree murder. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Some jurisdictions might still find malice if the act is inherently dangerous, leading to murder. But the statute here defines malice as deliberate intention to take life. So if he only intended to wound, maybe there's no expressed malice, so first-degree murder doesn't apply.

Option J: Unaware of malice elements. Ignorance of the law isn't a defense, so this probably doesn't help.

So, the key is to find a fact that negates the element of malice aforethought, specifically the deliberate intention to kill. The defendant's best defense would be to show that he didn't have the deliberate intent to kill anyone. 

Looking back at the options, option F says he didn't intend to kill, only to scare. If he didn't intend to kill, then there's no expressed malice. Alternatively, option I says he intended only to wound, which also would negate the intent to kill.

Wait, but the statutes say that malice is expressed when there's a deliberate intention to take away the life. So if he intended to wound, not kill, then perhaps he didn't have expressed malice. But if the act of shooting was so dangerous that it shows a depraved heart, maybe malice could be implied. But the statute defines malice as expressed or...? Wait, Section 170 only defines expressed malice. What about implied malice? The question doesn't provide that, so perhaps in this jurisdiction, malice is only when it's expressed. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, Section 170 says "Malice is expressed when..." but doesn't mention implied malice. So perhaps in this jurisdiction, malice can only be express, not implied. So if the defendant didn't have an intent to kill, then there's no malice. So if he only intended to wound, that would negate the malice.

So which option is better between F and I? Option F says he didn't intend to kill, only to scare. Option I says intended only to wound. Either way, he didn't intend to kill, so no expressed malice. But firing a gun at someone might still be considered an intent to kill. But if he only intended to scare, perhaps he didn't have the intent. Alternatively, if he intended to wound, that still shows an intent to cause harm but not kill.

Wait, but under common law, assault with intent to kill is different. If he intended to kill, that's murder. If he intended to cause serious bodily harm, that's also murder under the felony murder rule or under depraved heart. But if the statute only requires deliberate intent to kill for first-degree murder, then perhaps any lesser intent would not suffice.

So, the best defense would be to show that he didn't have the deliberate intent to kill anyone. So option F and I both suggest that. But which one is more applicable? If he intended to wound, that's still an intent to cause harm, but not kill. So perhaps that would negate the malice.

Wait, the question is about the best defense. So which option, if true, would provide the best chance of avoiding first-degree murder.

Alternatively, if the killing was accidental, then maybe it's manslaughter. But the question says he fired a shot, so it's intentional, but perhaps in option A, the discharge was accidental. But that might be a stretch because he was aiming.

Wait, maybe option A isn't about accidental discharge but that the gun went off by accident. But the question says he fired a shot, implying intent. So A might not apply.

So, the best options are F and I. Between them, which is better? If he intended to scare, that might not involve firing a gun. Because firing a gun at someone usually shows intent to kill or harm. But if he intended only to wound, that might still be seen as intent to cause harm but not kill.

Wait, but in the scenario, he fired a shot that missed the friend but killed the daughter. So, he intended to shoot the friend. If he intended to kill the friend, then under transferred intent, the daughter's killing would be murder. But if he didn't intend to kill, only to wound, then perhaps there's no malice.

So, the best defense would be to show that he didn't have the intent to kill, which would negate the malice. So option I says he intended only to wound the friend. Alternatively, option F says he intended to scare, not kill.

Which is more plausible? If he intended to wound, that's a specific intent, but perhaps the act of firing a gun could still imply an intent to kill, depending on where he aimed. But if he only intended to scare, that's less likely when firing a gun. So perhaps option I is better because it's a specific intent that negates the deliberate intent to kill.

Wait, but the problem is that the defendant was angry and fired a shot. So, if he intended to kill the friend, then it's murder. But if he only intended to wound, maybe it's not. But under transferred intent, his intent to wound the friend would transfer to the daughter, making him guilty of murder. Wait, no, transferred intent applies when the intent is to kill. If the intent is to wound, then maybe it's a different story.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The key is whether the defendant had the deliberate intention to kill. If he didn't, then there's no expressed malice, so first-degree murder doesn't apply.

Option F: He didn't intend to kill, only to scare. So, if he fired the gun to scare, perhaps he didn't have the intent to kill. But firing a gun can be considered an act likely to cause death, so maybe it's still murder, but perhaps not first-degree.

Option I: He intended to wound, not kill. So, he had the intent to cause harm, but not death. If the statutes require a deliberate intent to kill, then this would negate that element.

So, the best defense would be to show that he didn't have the intent to kill, so either F or I.

Alternatively, option E says he acted out of anger without deliberate intention. But the statute requires a deliberate intention, so if he acted without deliberation, perhaps it's not first-degree. But I'm not sure if anger negates deliberation.

Wait, the statutes don't mention premeditation, just deliberate intention. So, if he acted in anger but still had the deliberate intention to kill, then it's still first-degree. But if his anger made the intention not deliberate, perhaps it's not. But I think deliberate intention doesn't require premeditation, just a conscious intent at the time.

So, perhaps the best option is to argue that he didn't have the intent to kill at all, which would negate the malice. So, options F or I.

Between F and I, which is better? If he intended to scare, that might not involve firing a gun, but he could have other ways. But he did fire a gun, which is a lethal force. So maybe the better option is I: he intended only to wound the friend. Because that's a more specific intent that doesn't involve killing, which would negate the malice required for first-degree murder.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: transferred intent applies when the intent is to kill. If he intended to wound, then perhaps the transferred intent would be to wound the daughter, which wouldn't be murder. Wait, but the daughter died, so even if he intended to wound the friend, the fact that the daughter died might still lead to murder charges if the act was inherently dangerous.

Wait, but the statute defines murder as intentional killing with malice. If he didn't intend to kill, but only to wound, then perhaps it's not murder but manslaughter. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if he intended to kill, then it's murder. If he intended to wound, perhaps it's voluntary manslaughter or some other charge.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the best answer is option F: he didn't intend to kill anyone, only to scare. Because if he didn't intend to kill, there's no malice, so no first-degree murder.

Wait, but even if he only intended to scare, firing a gun could be considered an act with extreme indifference to human life, leading to a charge of murder under a different theory, but under the given statute, it's only first-degree if it's intentional with malice.

So, perhaps the best defense is option G: he intended to kill the friend, not the daughter. But under transferred intent, that wouldn't matter. So that's not a good defense.

Wait, no, I'm back to F or I.

Another thought: the answer might be option F. Because if he didn't intend to kill anyone, then there's no expressed malice, so no first-degree murder. But if he intended to wound, that's still an intent to harm, but not kill. So perhaps that's better.

Alternatively, in some cases, the intent to wound can be seen as malice because it's an intent to cause serious harm, leading to murder. But the statute here defines malice as expressed when there's a deliberate intent to kill. So, if he didn't intend to kill, there's no expressed malice, so it's not first-degree murder.

So, the best answer would be either F or I. Between them, I think option F is better because it shows no intent to kill, only to scare. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but in the scenario, he fired a shot at the friend. If he intended to scare, perhaps he fired a warning shot, but the bullet hit the daughter. So, maybe that's possible. So, if he only intended to scare, he didn't have the intent to kill, so no malice.

I think the best answer is F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend. Because that negates the expressed malice required for first-degree murder.

To determine the defendant's best defense against a charge of first-degree murder under the given statutes, it is essential to analyze the elements of the crime and how each option might negate those elements. 

First-degree murder under Section 169 requires an unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170 defines malice as "expressed" when there is a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Therefore, the prosecution must prove that the defendant had a deliberate intent to kill, which constitutes expressed malice.

### Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: The gun discharged accidentally.  
  This is unlikely to be a strong defense because the defendant fired a shot, indicating intentional action. An accidental discharge does not align with the facts.

- **Option B**: The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.  
  Negligence might be relevant for manslaughter, not first-degree murder, as murder requires malice. This does not negate the deliberate intent to kill.

- **Option C**: He was under the influence of alcohol at the time.  
  Voluntary intoxication is generally not a defense to murder, especially when the crime requires deliberate intent. This would not negate the malice required for first-degree murder.

- **Option D**: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target.  
  Under the doctrine of transferred intent, the intent to kill the friend would transfer to the daughter, making the defendant guilty of murder. This fact does not provide a defense.

- **Option E**: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention.  
  While anger might explain the defendant's actions, it does not negate the deliberate intention required for expressed malice. Acting out of anger does not automatically preclude a deliberate intent to kill.

- **Option F**: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend.  
  If the defendant only intended to scare the friend, this would negate the deliberate intent to kill, which is essential for expressed malice. Without this intent, the killing would not meet the requirements for first-degree murder.

- **Option G**: He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.  
  Again, under the doctrine of transferred intent, the intent to kill the friend would transfer to the daughter, making this fact irrelevant as a defense.

- **Option H**: He did not know the daughter was present.  
  Similar to Option G, the defendant's knowledge of the daughter's presence is irrelevant under transferred intent. This does not negate the malice required for first-degree murder.

- **Option I**: He intended only to wound the friend.  
  If the defendant only intended to wound the friend, this would negate the deliberate intent to kill, which is required for expressed malice. However, firing a gun at someone could still imply an intent to cause serious harm, potentially leading to a murder charge under a different theory.

- **Option J**: He was unaware of the elements of malice.  
  Ignorance of the law is not a defense. This fact would not negate the malice required for first-degree murder.

### Conclusion:
The defendant's best defense would be to show that he did not have the deliberate intent to kill, which is required for expressed malice. Both Options F and I negate this intent, but Option F is stronger because it explicitly states that the defendant did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend. This directly undermines the element of expressed malice, providing the best chance for a successful defense.
