Question:

A woman is the owner of record of a parcel of land designated as "A. " It is the highest of three neighboring properties on a mountain. The woman's sister owns parcel "C," which lies the lowest on the mountain. Parcel "B" lies between Parcels "A" andIn 2000, the woman who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel "A" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the sister purchased parcel "C" from the woman. The deed to the sister did not contain any mention of the woman's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. A portion of the sister's unimproved land began to subside over the drainage system. This was because of an especially pliable soil condition of which the woman was unaware prior to construction of the drainage system. In an action brought by the sister against the woman to recover property damage for the subsidence of her land, judgment should be for whom?

Options:

A: The woman, unless it can be proven that she intentionally hid the condition of the soil.
B: The woman, because the sister did not maintain the drainage system on her property.
C: The woman, because the sister purchased the property with full knowledge of the existing drainage system.
D: The sister, because the woman did not include any mention of the drainage system in the deed.
E: The sister, because the woman should have tested the soil before constructing the drainage system.
F: The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.
G: The woman, unless she sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.
H: The sister, because she is entitled to support for her land in its improved condition.
I: The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.
J: The woman, because the sister did not perform a thorough inspection before purchasing the property.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about property damage and drainage systems. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the setup: There are three parcels of land, A, B, and C. The woman owns A, which is the highest, and her sister owns C, the lowest. In between is B. The woman used to own all three but sold C to her sister in 2005. 

In 2000, the woman built a private drainage system that goes through all three parcels. The system is underground and sends sewage from A to a municipal sewer at the bottom. When she sold C to her sister, the deed didn't mention the drainage system. Now, part of the sister's land is subsiding because of the drainage system. The soil there is especially pliable, which the woman didn't know about when she built the system.

The sister is suing for property damage. The question is about who should win.

I remember that in property law, there's something about lateral support and subjacent support. Lateral support is about the right to have your land supported by neighboring land in its natural condition. Subjacent support is when you own the land below, and someone above you can't interfere with your support.

Here, parcel C is below A and B. The drainage system runs through all three, but the problem is on C's land—subsidance because of the system. So, the issue is whether the woman (owner of A) is liable for the damage caused by the drainage system on C's land.

I think the key is whether the woman had the right to build the drainage system across the sister's land. Since she was the original owner of all three, when she sold C, she might have retained some easement for the drainage. But the deed didn't mention it, so maybe she didn't. Without an easement, the sister might not have been obligated to allow the system on her land.

Wait, but the woman built the system before selling C. So when she sold C, did she implicitly grant an easement for the existing system? Or does the sister take the land subject to any existing uses?

Under the doctrine of implied easements, if the original owner (the woman) had a use that was apparent and continuous before the sale, an easement might be implied. So the drainage system was there before the sale, so the sister might have taken the land with the easement already in place. If that's the case, the sister can't complain about the system being there, but if the system causes damage beyond what's reasonable, then maybe she can.

But the problem here is that the subsidence is due to the drainage system and the soil's pliable nature, which the woman didn't know about. So was the woman negligent in building the system? Or is she strictly liable for any damage caused by the system?

I think in property law, when you have an easement, the person with the easement (here, the woman, as the owner of A) can use it, but if their use causes unreasonable damage, they might be liable. So if the drainage system is causing subsidence, that's a problem.

Alternatively, the sister might be entitled to support. Since C is below A, the natural condition of the land would include the soil in its original state. If the woman's drainage system interfered with that, causing subsidence, the sister might be entitled to subjacent support.

Wait, subjacent support refers to the right of the lower landowner to have their land supported in its natural state by the land above. So if the woman's drainage system caused the land above (on B or A) to be destabilized, affecting C, then the sister can claim for subjacent support.

In this case, the subsidence is on C's land because of the drainage system running through it. So maybe the sister is entitled to support for her land in its natural condition. So the woman might be liable because she's interfering with that support.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the sister is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition. Option I talks about lateral support, which is different—lateral is side by side, but here A is above C, so it's a subjacent issue.

So the judgment should be for the sister because she's entitled to subjacent support, making option F correct.

Wait, but another angle: The woman built the drainage system when she owned all three parcels. When she sold C, she might have had an easement by necessity or implication for the drainage. If the system was already there, the sister would have to accept it, but the woman could still be liable if the system was negligently constructed.

The question states the woman didn't know about the pliable soil. So if she wasn't negligent, does that matter? If it's strict liability for the damage caused by the easement, then she might still be liable regardless of negligence.

But I'm leaning towards the sister being entitled to support, making option F the right choice.

The question revolves around property law principles, specifically the rights of a lower landowner (the sister) regarding support for her land in its natural condition. The woman, who originally owned all three parcels, constructed a drainage system that runs across all properties, including the sister's parcel "C." The deed to "C" did not mention the drainage system, and the sister is now experiencing subsidence on her land due to the system and the soil's pliable condition, which the woman was unaware of at the time of construction.

Key legal principles include implied easements and the rights to lateral and subjacent support. Since the drainage system was constructed before the sale of parcel "C," an implied easement for its continued use might exist. However, the sister, as the lower landowner, is entitled to subjacent support, meaning her land should be supported in its natural condition by the land above it. The woman's drainage system, which caused subsidence, interferes with this right.

The subsidence is not due to the sister's actions but rather the woman's drainage system. While the woman's lack of knowledge about the soil condition may negate negligence, the sister's entitlement to subjacent support remains. Therefore, the judgment should favor the sister.
