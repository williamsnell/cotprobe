Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this. The question is about how an ester is made. I remember that esters are a type of organic compound, and they're often involved in reactions related to carboxylic acids or their derivatives.

Wait, esterification... right! I think esters are typically formed from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Oh right, the reaction is called Fischer esterification. So, when a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol, they form an ester and water. That makes sense because the acid donates an -OH group, and the alcohol provides the -OR group.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says an alcohol and an acid. Let me look through the choices:

Option A: two different acids. Hmm, I don't think so. Esters are from an acid and an alcohol, not two acids.

Option B: an amine and an acid. That rings a bell for amides, I think. When an acid reacts with an amine, you get an amide, not an ester.

Option C: an alcohol and an acid. Yes, that's what I was thinking. So this could be the right choice.

Wait, any other possibilities? Let's check the rest.

Option D: an acid and a ketone. No, ketones are different. Acids reacting with ketones... I don't recall that forming esters.

Option E: a ketone and an alcohol. No, that's more like maybe a protection reaction or something else, but not ester formation.

Option F: an acid and a base. That sounds like a neutralization reaction, producing a salt and water, not an ester.

Option G: two different alcohols. No, that doesn't make sense. Esthers have an acid part and an alcohol part.

Option H: an alcohol and a base. Bases are like hydroxides, maybe saponification of esters, but that's the reverse.

Option I: an alcohol and an aldehyde. Oh, that's more like a situation for forming an acetal or something, not an ester.

Option J: an amine and an alcohol. That doesn't fit either. I think that would form something else, maybe a different kind of compound.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C: an alcohol and an acid.

To determine how an ester is made, it is important to recall that esters are typically formed through the reaction of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, a process known as Fischer esterification. This reaction produces an ester and water. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Two different acids do not form an ester.  
- **B**: An amine and an acid form an amide, not an ester.  
- **C**: An alcohol and an acid is correct, as this is the basis of esterification.  
- **D**: An acid and a ketone do not form an ester.  
- **E**: A ketone and an alcohol do not form an ester.  
- **F**: An acid and a base undergo neutralization, forming a salt and water, not an ester.  
- **G**: Two different alcohols cannot form an ester.  
- **H**: An alcohol and a base are unrelated to ester formation.  
- **I**: An alcohol and an aldehyde form an acetal, not an ester.  
- **J**: An amine and an alcohol do not form an ester.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C: an alcohol and an acid**.
