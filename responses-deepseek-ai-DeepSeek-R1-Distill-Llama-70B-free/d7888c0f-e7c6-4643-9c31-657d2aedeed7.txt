Question:

An ancient Egyptian mummy is found. A count of the radiationemitted from the C^14 in the body is only one eighth thatfound in persons who have died recently. About how old isthe mummy? (The half-life of C^14 is 5568 years.)

D: 20,136 years old
E: 13,500 years old
F: 22,176 years old
G: 4,500 years old
H: 18,950 years old
I: 27,840 years old
J: 11,136 years old

Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about the age of an Egyptian mummy based on carbon-14 levels. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the question says that the radiation emitted from the C^14 in the mummy is only one eighth of what's found in recently deceased people. The half-life of C^14 is given as 5568 years. I need to find the approximate age of the mummy.

Hmm, I remember that carbon dating uses the half-life of carbon-14 to determine the age of organic remains. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the C^14 to decay. So, if the radiation is one eighth, that means the amount of C^14 has decreased by that factor.

Wait, let me clarify: the count being one eighth implies that the remaining C^14 is 1/8 of the original. Since each half-life reduces the amount by half, I can figure out how many half-lives have passed.

So starting with 100% (recently deceased), after one half-life (5568 years), it would be 50%. After two half-lives (2*5568=11136 years), it would be 25%. After three half-lives (3*5568=16704 years), it would be 12.5%. Wait, but 1/8 is 12.5%, right? Because 1/2 is 50%, 1/4 is 25%, 1/8 is 12.5%, so that's three half-lives.

So if three half-lives have passed, the age would be 3 multiplied by 5568 years. Let me calculate that: 3 * 5568. Let's see, 5568 * 3. 5000*3 is 15000, 568*3 is 1704, so total 15000+1704=16704 years.

Looking at the options, option A is 16,704 years old. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Here, N is the remaining C^14, N0 is the original. Since the count is 1/8 of recent, which is N0, so N/N0 = 1/8. So 1/8 = (1/2)^(t/5568). Taking log base 1/2 on both sides, log_{1/2}(1/8) = t /5568. But I know that (1/2)^3 = 1/8, so t = 3 * 5568 = 16704. Yep, that's correct.

The age of the mummy can be determined using the half-life of carbon-14 (C^14), which is 5568 years. The problem states that the radiation emitted from the C^14 in the mummy is one eighth that of recently deceased individuals. This indicates that 1/8 of the original C^14 remains, meaning three half-lives have passed (since (1/2)^3 = 1/8). 

To calculate the age, multiply the number of half-lives (3) by the half-life of C^14:

\[
\text{Age} = 3 \times 5568 = 16704 \text{ years.}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **A: 16,704 years old**.
