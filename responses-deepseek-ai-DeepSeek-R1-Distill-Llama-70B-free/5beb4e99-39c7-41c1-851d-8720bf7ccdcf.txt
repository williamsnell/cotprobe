Okay, so I've got this problem where Susan Wane and Dolly Watson invested money into a corkscrew factory. Susan put in $35,000 and Dolly $20,000. They're sharing the profits equally after each gets 8% interest on their investment. The total income earned is $24,200. I need to figure out how much each gets and pick the right option from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should calculate the interest each of them gets. Since it's 8% per annum, I guess that's straightforward. So for Susan, 8% of 35,000 is 0.08 * 35,000. Let me compute that. 35,000 times 0.08 is 2,800. So Susan gets $2,800 as interest. Dolly's investment is 20,000, so 0.08 * 20,000 is 1,600. So Dolly gets $1,600 in interest.

Now, the profit is $24,200. But before they split the profits, they each take their interest. Wait, no, I think they take their interest first, and then split the remaining profit equally. Or wait, maybe the 8% interest is taken first, and the remaining profit is split. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, the question says they share the profits equally after each receives 8% interest on their investment. So the process is: total income is $24,200. First, Susan gets 8% of her investment, which is $2,800, and Dolly gets 8% of hers, which is $1,600. So total interest paid out is 2,800 + 1,600 = $4,400.

Wait, but wait, the total income is $24,200. So after paying the interest, the remaining amount is distributed equally. So subtract the interest from the total income. So 24,200 - 4,400 = $19,800. That's the remaining profit to be split equally between them.

So each of them gets half of $19,800. Half of that is 9,900. So Susan and Dolly each get $9,900 from the profit sharing.

But wait, Susan also gets her interest, and Dolly hers. So Susan's total would be her interest plus her share of the profit. Similarly for Dolly.

So Susan's total is 2,800 (interest) + 9,900 (profit share) = $12,700. Dolly's total is 1,600 + 9,900 = $11,500.

So looking at the options, I need to find where Susan gets $12,700 and Dolly $11,500. Let's check the options.

Option J: Ms. Wane receives $12,700, Ms. Watson $11,500. That matches what I calculated.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

Total investment: Susan 35k, Dolly 20k. Each gets 8% on their investment. So Susan's interest is 35,000 * 0.08 = 2,800. Dolly's is 20,000 * 0.08 = 1,600. Total interest is 4,400. The total income is 24,200. So the remaining after interest is 24,200 - 4,400 = 19,800. Split equally, so each gets 9,900.

So Susan: 2,800 + 9,900 = 12,700. Dolly: 1,600 + 9,900 = 11,500.

Yes, that's correct. So the right option is J.

To determine the distribution of income, we first calculate the 8% interest on each investment:

- **Susan's interest**: \( 35,000 \times 0.08 = 2,800 \)
- **Dolly's interest**: \( 20,000 \times 0.08 = 1,600 \)

The total interest paid out is \( 2,800 + 1,600 = 4,400 \). Subtracting this from the total income of $24,200 leaves \( 24,200 - 4,400 = 19,800 \), which is the remaining profit to be split equally between the two. Each receives \( 19,800 \div 2 = 9,900 \).

Adding the interest to their respective shares:

- **Susan's total**: \( 2,800 + 9,900 = 12,700 \)
- **Dolly's total**: \( 1,600 + 9,900 = 11,500 \)

The correct distribution is **Ms. Wane receives $12,700, and Ms. Watson receives $11,500**.
