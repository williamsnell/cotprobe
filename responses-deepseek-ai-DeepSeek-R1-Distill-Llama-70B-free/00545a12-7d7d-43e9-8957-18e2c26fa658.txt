Okay, so I have this problem about discounts, and I need to figure out how to combine two discounts into a single one. The question is asking how to express the discount series 20-10% as one single discount. Hmm, I remember that when you have multiple discounts, you don't just add them up. Instead, you apply them in a way that each discount is applied to the price after the previous discount has been applied.

Let me think through an example. Suppose the original price of an item is $100. If the first discount is 20%, that means the price becomes 80% of the original. So 20% off of $100 would make it $80. Now, the second discount is 10%, but this is applied to the new price of $80, not the original $100. So 10% of $80 is $8, which brings the final price down to $72.

Wait, so the final price is $72 after both discounts. That means the total discount from the original $100 is $28. So the single equivalent discount would be 28%. But wait, let me double-check that because sometimes I get confused between multiplying the percentages correctly.

Another way to look at it is by using multipliers. The first discount of 20% is the same as multiplying by 0.8 (since 100% - 20% = 80%). The second discount of 10% is the same as multiplying by 0.9. So the combined effect is 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72. That means the final price is 72% of the original, so the discount is 100% -72% =28%. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option A is 28%. So the answer should be A. But wait, am I sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me try another example to confirm. Suppose the original price is $200. After a 20% discount, it's $160. Then a 10% discount on $160 is $16 off, making it $144. So the total discount from $200 is $56. $56 is 28% of $200. Yep, that checks out.

I think I'm confident now that 28% is the correct single discount equivalent to the series 20-10%.
</think>

To determine the equivalent single discount for the series 20-10%, we apply the discounts sequentially. First, a 20% discount reduces the price to 80% of the original, and then a 10% discount reduces it further to 90% of the already discounted price. Multiplying these factors together gives:

\[
0.8 \times 0.9 = 0.72
\]

This means the final price is 72% of the original, so the total discount is:

\[
100\% - 72\% = 28\%
\]

Thus, the equivalent single discount is **28%**, which corresponds to option A.
