Question:

A buyer signed a contract to purchase a tract of land from a seller. The contract was signed on May 1, 2006, and the closing is set for June 15, 2006. The land was located in a jurisdiction that has in force the following statute:Statute of Limitations "an action to recover the possession of land shall be brought within twenty- one (21) years after the cause thereof accrued, but if a person who is entitled to bring such action at the time the cause accrued is within the age of minority (under 21) or of unsound mind, such action may be brought within ten (10) years after such disability is removed. "This statute was enacted in the jurisdiction in 1930. The land in question had been owned by a rancher in 1960. On September 1, 1960, the rancher died intestate, leaving his nephew as his only heir. The nephew had been born on October 1, 1954. In addition, there is a deed from the rancher's administrator to the seller dated November 1, 1960, which the latter recorded on the same date. During his title search, the buyer learned that the administrator had never obtained any license to sell the land in question; and also he (the administrator) never formally received the approval of any court with respect to the administration of the rancher's estate. Moreover, the buyer ascertained that the seller entered into possession of the land in question on November 1, 1960. On the assumption that there are no additional facts, the buyer should be advised that the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question

Options:

A: on June 15, 2006.
B: when the nephew reached the age of 21.
C: when the administrator received court approval for the sale.
D: on May 1, 2006.
E: on September 1, 1960.
F: on October 1, 1985.
G: when the statute of limitations expired.
H: on November 12, 1981.
I: when the nephew dies.
J: on November 1, 1960.

Okay, so I've got this question about real property law, specifically dealing with the statute of limitations and when the seller actually became the owner of the land. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A buyer is purchasing land from a seller. The contract is signed on May 1, 2006, and closing is set for June 15, 2006. The land is in a jurisdiction with a specific statute of limitations regarding actions to recover land possession. The statute says that such an action must be brought within 21 years after the cause accrued. But if the person entitled to bring the action was a minor (under 21) or of unsound mind at the time, they have 10 years after the disability is removed.

The land was owned by a rancher who died intestate in 1960. The rancher's only heir is his nephew, born on October 1, 1954. So the nephew was 5 years old when the rancher died in 1960. The rancher's administrator sold the land to the seller via a deed on November 1, 1960, which was recorded the same day. However, the administrator didn't get a license to sell the land and didn't receive court approval for the estate administration.

The buyer did a title search and found these issues. So the question is, when did the seller become the owner of the land?

I remember that when someone dies intestate, their property goes to their heirs. The rancher's heir is the nephew, who was a minor in 1960. The administrator sold the land without proper authority because they didn't get court approval or a license. So, the sale might be considered invalid because the administrator didn't have the authority to sell without court approval.

But the issue here is the statute of limitations. The nephew would have a claim to the land as the rightful heir. However, he was a minor when the cause of action accrued (when the rancher died and the administrator sold the land without authority). So the statute of limitations for him to bring an action would be tolled until he turns 21.

Wait, the statute says that if someone is under 21 when the cause accrues, they have 10 years after the disability is removed. So the cause of action would accrue when the rancher died, right? Because that's when the nephew became entitled to the land, and the administrator sold it without authority.

The nephew was born in 1954, so he turned 21 on October 1, 1975. But wait, he was 5 in 1960 when the rancher died. So the statute of limitations would start when he turns 21, giving him until 1985 (1975 + 10 years) to bring an action.

But wait, the sale happened in 1960, and the nephew's cause of action would have accrued then. But because he was a minor, the 21-year period is extended. Let me think: the standard period is 21 years, but because he was a minor, he gets 10 years after turning 21.

So, the time he could bring a claim would be until 1985. If he didn't bring a claim by then, the seller's title would become valid through adverse possession or because the statute of limitations ran out.

But the question is about when the seller became the owner. So, if the nephew never challenged the sale, then after the statute of limitations expires, the seller's title is secure.

So the key is when the statute of limitations ran out. The cause accrued in 1960. The nephew had until 1975 (when he turned 21) plus 10 years, so until 1985. So by 1985, if he didn't sue, the seller's ownership is valid.

Wait, but the options don't have 1985. Let me check the options again.

Option F is October 1, 1985. That would be when the nephew turns 31, but wait, his 10 years after turning 21 would end in 1985. So if the statute ran out in 1985, then the seller's title becomes valid at that point.

So the seller would become the owner when the statute of limitations expires, which is in 1985. So the correct answer would be F: October 1, 1985.

Wait, but another possibility: the seller took possession in 1960. If the nephew didn't bring an action within the allowed time, then the seller might acquire title through adverse possession. But the question is about when the seller became the owner, not necessarily through adverse possession. Alternatively, the initial sale was invalid, but the statute of limitations would bar the nephew's claim after the time expired.

So, the seller's ownership becomes valid once the statute of limitations runs out because the nephew can no longer challenge it. So the time would be when the nephew's time to sue expires, which is 10 years after he turns 21, so 1985.

Looking at the options, F is October 1, 1985, which aligns with that date. So the answer should be F.

The question revolves around determining when the seller became the owner of the land, given the jurisdiction's statute of limitations and the facts provided. The rancher died intestate in 1960, leaving the land to his nephew, who was a minor at the time. The rancher's administrator sold the land to the seller without proper court approval or a license, which could invalidate the sale. However, the statute of limitations plays a critical role in determining the seller's ownership.

The statute of limitations allows an action to recover land to be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues. If the person entitled to bring the action is a minor, the statute is tolled until the disability is removed, and they then have 10 years to bring the action. Here, the cause of action accrued in 1960 when the rancher died, and the nephew was a minor (born October 1, 1954). The nephew turned 21 on October 1, 1975, and the 10-year period for him to bring an action expired on October 1, 1985. If the nephew did not challenge the sale by then, the seller's title would become valid and secure.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is the date when the statute of limitations expired, which is October 1, 1985. This is when the seller definitively became the owner of the land.
