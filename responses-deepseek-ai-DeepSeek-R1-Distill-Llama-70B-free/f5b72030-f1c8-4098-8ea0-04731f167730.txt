Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas.
Source 1
Indians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.
—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493
Source 2
It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about Christopher Columbus and Bartholomew de las Casas. So, the question is asking which motive for exploration de las Casas thinks is most important, based on his excerpt in Source 2.

First, I remember that de las Casas was a Dominican bishop who was really critical of the Spanish treatment of the indigenous people. He wrote a lot about the atrocities committed by the Spanish conquistadors. So, looking at Source 2, he's describing how the Spanish treated the natives very harshly, comparing them to wolves and lions. He mentions that the native population dropped from three million to just 200, which is a huge decline. 

In the text, de las Casas says that the reason for all this killing and destruction is that the Christians (the Spanish) wanted to get gold and become rich quickly. So their main goal was financial gain. He talks about how they used torture and other methods to get what they wanted, which was wealth.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match this with the motives. Option G is Financial gain, which seems to fit because de las Casas emphasizes the Spanish desire for gold and riches. 

Wait, but I should check the other options to make sure. Option I is about converting natives to Christianity. While Columbus in Source 1 mentions wanting to convert them, de las Casas in Source 2 is more focused on the brutality and the greed. He does mention that the Spanish had an ultimate aim of getting gold, not primarily about religion. So I think I is less likely.

Other options like trade routes (D) or political dominance (J) might be related, but the text specifically points to gold and riches as the main motive. So G seems correct.

The correct answer is **G: Financial gain**. In Source 2, de las Casas emphasizes that the Spanish were driven by the desire to acquire gold and riches quickly, which is the primary motive he highlights. While other factors like converting natives to Christianity (I) are mentioned by Columbus in Source 1, de las Casas focuses on the brutal methods used to extract wealth, making financial gain the most important motive in his account.

Answer: G
