Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the amount of heat required to convert 10 grams of ice at 0°C to vapor at 100°C. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my classes that when you're dealing with phase changes and temperature changes, you have to consider each step separately.

First, I think about what's happening here. The ice is at 0°C, and I need to turn it into vapor at 100°C. So, I guess the process has a few steps. Let me break it down.

Step 1: Melting the ice. Ice at 0°C needs to melt into water at 0°C. I remember that the heat of fusion is the amount of energy needed to melt a substance without changing its temperature. The heat of fusion for water is given as 80 cal/g. So, for 10 grams of ice, the heat required would be 10 g multiplied by 80 cal/g. Let me calculate that: 10 * 80 = 800 calories. Okay, so that's the first part done.

Step 2: Heating the water from 0°C to 100°C. Oh right, specific heat is involved here. The specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C, which I think means it takes 1 calorie to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. Since we're going from 0 to 100, that's a 100-degree change. So the calculation here is mass (10g) multiplied by specific heat (1 cal/g°C) multiplied by the temperature change (100°C). So 10 * 1 * 100 = 1000 calories. Got it.

Step 3: Vaporizing the water at 100°C into steam at 100°C. The heat of vaporization is the energy needed to turn liquid into gas without changing temperature. The heat of vaporization for water is 540 cal/g. So again, for 10 grams, that's 10 * 540 = 5400 calories.

Now, to find the total heat required, I just add up all these three parts. So adding them up: 800 (melting) + 1000 (heating) + 5400 (vaporizing) = 800 + 1000 is 1800, plus 5400 gives 7200 calories. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the units again to make sure I didn't mix anything up. All the values are in cal/g, and the mass is 10 grams, so the units should match. Yep, that seems right.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7200 calories. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations.

First step: 10g *80=800. Yep. Second step:10*100=1000. Third step:10*540=5400. Adding them up: 800+1000=1800, 1800+5400=7200. Oh, yes, that's correct. So the total heat required is 7200 calories. So the answer must be option C.

To determine the quantity of heat required to convert 10 g of ice at 0°C to vapor at 100°C, the process is broken into three steps:

1. **Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C**:  
   The heat of fusion for water is 80 cal/g. For 10 g of ice:  
   \[
   10 \, \text{g} \times 80 \, \text{cal/g} = 800 \, \text{calories}.
   \]

2. **Heating the water from 0°C to 100°C**:  
   The specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C. For a temperature change of 100°C:  
   \[
   10 \, \text{g} \times 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \times 100 \, \text{°C} = 1000 \, \text{calories}.
   \]

3. **Vaporizing the water at 100°C to vapor at 100°C**:  
   The heat of vaporization for water is 540 cal/g. For 10 g of water:  
   \[
   10 \, \text{g} \times 540 \, \text{cal/g} = 5400 \, \text{calories}.
   \]

Adding these steps together gives the total heat required:  
\[
800 \, \text{calories} + 1000 \, \text{calories} + 5400 \, \text{calories} = 7200 \, \text{calories}.
\]

Thus, the total heat required is **7200 calories**, which corresponds to **option C**.
