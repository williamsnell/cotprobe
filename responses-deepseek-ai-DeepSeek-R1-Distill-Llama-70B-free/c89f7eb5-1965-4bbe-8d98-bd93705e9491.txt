Okay, so I've got this question about Bessel's equation of order one and I need to find the general solution from the given options. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Bessel equations, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, Bessel's equation is a differential equation, right? I remember that it's a second-order linear differential equation, which means the general solution should involve two linearly independent solutions. Oh wait, the general form of a second-order linear ODE is y = c1*y1 + c2*y2, where y1 and y2 are the two independent solutions.

So Bessel's equation of order one... I think the solutions are called Bessel functions of the first and second kinds. Oh right, they're often denoted as J_1 and Y_1 or maybe J_1 and J_{-1}? Wait, no, J is the Bessel function of the first kind, and Y is the second kind, sometimes called the Neumann function. So the general solution should be a combination of these two.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says y(x) = c1*y1(x) + c2*y2(x). That looks like the general form I was thinking of, where y1 and y2 are the two independent solutions. So I'm guessing that here, y1 and y2 are J_1 and Y_1, or something like that.

Wait a second, option D is something about x times y1 and divided by y2. That seems more complicated. I don't think the general solution for Bessel's equation involves terms like x*y or 1/(x*y). So probably not D.

Option A is sin and cos, but that's the solution for the simple harmonic oscillator or something like the Cauchy-Euler equation for certain cases. But Bessel's equation doesn't have sin and cos as solutions, right? Because Bessel functions are their own special functions, not expressible in terms of elementary functions like sine and cosine.

Option B is squares of y1 and y2. That doesn't make sense for a general solution. The general solution is linear combination, not a product or squares.

Option E is a ratio of y1 and y2 with constants. That doesn't fit the standard form. I don't think so.

Option F has a logarithm and x squared. That doesn't seem right either. Maybe that's for another type of equation.

Option G is the product of y1 and y2, which would be a multiplicative combination, but the general solution is additive. So that's probably not it.

Option H is the sum of reciprocals. Again, not fitting the standard form.

Option I subtracts two solutions. Well, that's still a linear combination, so technically it's a solution, but the general solution is usually expressed as a sum, not a subtraction. But wait, the question says "find the general solution", so any linear combination is acceptable. But the options have to match that. I think option C is more standard because it's a sum, whereas I is a difference.

Option J is exponentials, which are solutions to equations like the simple harmonic oscillator when the frequency is imaginary, but not for Bessel's equation.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C: y(x) = c1*y1(x) + c2*y2(x), where y1 and y2 are the two independent Bessel functions of order one, probably J_1 and Y_1.

Bessel's equation of order one is a second-order linear differential equation, and its general solution must involve two linearly independent solutions. These solutions are typically denoted as \( J_1(x) \), the Bessel function of the first kind, and \( Y_1(x) \), the Bessel function of the second kind (or Neumann function). The general solution can therefore be expressed as a linear combination of these two functions.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( y(x) = c_1 \sin(x) + c_2 \cos(x) \) is incorrect because Bessel's equation does not have sine and cosine as solutions. Instead, its solutions are special functions \( J_1(x) \) and \( Y_1(x) \).

- **Option B**: \( y(x) = c_1 y_1(x)^2 + c_2 y_2(x)^2 \) is incorrect because the general solution involves a linear combination of \( y_1(x) \) and \( y_2(x) \), not their squares.

- **Option C**: \( y(x) = c_1 y_1(x) + c_2 y_2(x) \) is correct. This matches the standard form of the general solution for a second-order linear differential equation, where \( y_1(x) \) and \( y_2(x) \) are the two independent solutions.

- **Option D**: \( y(x) = c_1 x y_1(x) + c_2 / (x y_2(x)) \) is incorrect because the general solution does not involve terms like \( x y_1(x) \) or \( 1 / (x y_2(x)) \).

- **Option E**: \( y(x) = c_1 y_1(x) / (c_2 y_2(x)) \) is incorrect because the general solution is a linear combination, not a ratio of the solutions.

- **Option F**: \( y(x) = c_1 \ln|x| + c_2 x^2 \) is incorrect because these terms do not correspond to the solutions of Bessel's equation.

- **Option G**: \( y(x) = c_1 y_1(x) \cdot c_2 y_2(x) \) is incorrect because the general solution involves an additive combination, not a multiplicative one.

- **Option H**: \( y(x) = c_1 / y_1(x) + c_2 / y_2(x) \) is incorrect because the general solution is not expressed in terms of reciprocals of the solutions.

- **Option I**: \( y(x) = c_1 y_1(x) - c_2 y_2(x) \) is technically a valid linear combination, but the general solution is typically expressed as a sum, making this option less standard than Option C.

- **Option J**: \( y(x) = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} \) is incorrect because exponential functions are not solutions to Bessel's equation.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it represents the standard form of the general solution for Bessel's equation of order one.
