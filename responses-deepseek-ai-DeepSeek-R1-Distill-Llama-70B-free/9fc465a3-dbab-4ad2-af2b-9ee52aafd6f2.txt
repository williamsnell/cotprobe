Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about baking powder. Hmm, I've heard that baking powder is a mixture of baking soda and cream of tartar. The question is asking how much baking soda needs to be added to 8.0 grams of cream of tartar so that both react completely. Alright, I think I'll need to use stoichiometry for this.

The chemical equation provided is KHC4H4O6 + NaHCO3 → KNaC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2. So, the reactants are cream of tartar (KHC4H4O6) and baking soda (NaHCO3), and they produce some products. I remember that stoichiometry involves finding the mole ratios from the balanced equation and then converting grams to moles using molar masses.

First, I need to figure out the molar masses of both reactants. The problem gives the molecular weights: cream of tartar is 188 g/mol and baking soda is 84 g/mol. Oh wait, the molecular formula for cream of tartar is KHC4H4O6, which has a molecular weight of 188. Baking soda is NaHCO3, molecular weight 84.

The next step is to find out how many moles of cream of tartar are in 8.0 grams. So moles = mass / molar mass. That's 8.0 g divided by 188 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 8 divided by 188 is approximately 0.042553 moles. Let me write that as 0.04255 mol for KHC4H4O6.

Now, looking at the balanced equation, the ratio of cream of tartar to baking soda is 1:1. That means each mole of cream of tartar reacts with one mole of baking soda. So the moles of NaHCO3 needed should be the same as the moles of KHC4H4O6, which is 0.04255 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the equation again. Yes, it's a 1:1 ratio. So same moles.

Now, convert moles of baking soda to grams. That's moles multiplied by molar mass. So 0.04255 mol * 84 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.04255 * 84 is... let's see: 0.04 *84 is 3.36, and 0.00255 *84 is approximately 0.2142. Adding those together gives about 3.574 grams.

Hmm, looking at the options, I don't see 3.57 exactly. Let's check the options again. Option J is 3.6 g, which is very close. But wait, maybe I should recalculate more accurately.

Wait, 8.0 / 188 is exactly 8/188. Let me compute that more precisely. 188 times 0.04255 is 8.0. Let me do the division: 8 divided by 188. 188 goes into 8 zero times. Put a decimal: 188 into 80 is 0. So 0.04255... Well, perhaps a better way is to compute 8/188. Let me do it step by step.

188 * 0.04 is 7.52. Subtracting that from 8.0 gives 0.48. 0.48 / 188 = approximately 0.00255. So 0.04255 moles is correct.

Then, 0.04255 moles * 84 g/mol = 0.04255 *84. Let me compute 0.04 *84 =3.36, 0.00255 *84=0.2142. So 3.36 + 0.2142 is 3.5742 grams.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 3.6 g. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try calculating more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set it up as a ratio. The mole ratio is 1:1, so the mass ratio is (molar mass of NaHCO3) / (molar mass of KHC4H4O6) multiplied by the mass of cream of tartar.

So (84 / 188) * 8.0 g. Let me compute that. 84 divided by 188 is approximately 0.4468. 0.4468 * 8= 3.5744 grams. So yeah, about 3.57 grams. So the closest option is J, 3.6 grams.

Wait, but the options don't have 3.57. Let me look again.

Options:

A: 2.8

B:5.1

C:6.2

D:3.2

E:7.0

F:2.2

G:4.0

H:4.3

I:1.7

J:3.6

So 3.57 is approximately 3.6, so J is the correct answer.

But wait, perhaps I should recheck the math. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial mole calculation.

Wait, 8.0 g divided by 188:

Let me compute 188 * 0.04 = 7.52

188 * 0.04255 = ?

Wait 0.04255 *188 = ?

0.04 * 188 = 7.52

0.002 * 188 = 0.376

0.00055 * 188 = 0.1034

Adding them: 7.52 + 0.376 = 7.896, +0.1034=8.0. So yes, 0.04255 moles is correct.

So 0.04255 moles *84 g/mol = 3.574 g. So 3.57 grams, which is about 3.6 grams. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says "how much baking soda must be added to 8.0g of cream of tartar for both materials to react completely." So yes, 3.57g is needed. So the correct option is J.

To determine how much baking soda (NaHCO₃) must be added to 8.0 g of cream of tartar (KHC₄H₄O₆) for both materials to react completely, we use stoichiometry based on the given reaction:

**KHC₄H₄O₆ + NaHCO₃ → KNaC₄H₄O₆ + H₂O + CO₂**

### Step 1: Calculate moles of cream of tartar
The molar mass of KHC₄H₄O₆ is 188 g/mol. The number of moles of cream of tartar in 8.0 g is:

\[
\text{Moles of KHC₄H₄O₆} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{8.0}{188} \approx 0.04255 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Determine moles of baking soda required
From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of KHC₄H₄O₆ to NaHCO₃ is 1:1. Therefore, the moles of NaHCO₃ required are also:

\[
\text{Moles of NaHCO₃} = 0.04255 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Convert moles of baking soda to grams
The molar mass of NaHCO₃ is 84 g/mol. The mass of baking soda required is:

\[
\text{Mass of NaHCO₃} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass} = 0.04255 \times 84 \approx 3.574 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated mass of baking soda is approximately 3.574 g, which is closest to **3.6 g**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: 3.6 g of baking soda**
