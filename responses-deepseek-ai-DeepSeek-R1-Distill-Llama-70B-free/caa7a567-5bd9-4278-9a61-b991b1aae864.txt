Okay, so I've got this question about the CPU and its major functional units. Hmm, I need to think this through. I remember from my computer class that the CPU is the brain of the computer, right? And it has a few main parts that handle different tasks.

Wait, the question is asking about the major functional units. I think the two main ones are the Control Unit and the Arithmetic Logic Unit. Oh yeah, the Control Unit (CU) is like the manager, directing the flow of data and instructions. It fetches the instructions and makes sure everything happens in the right order.

Then there's the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which does all the calculations and logical operations. So when the CPU needs to add two numbers or make a decision (like if-else statements), the ALU handles that.

I'm trying to remember if there are more than these two. Oh wait, sometimes people might mention the Registers as part of the CPU, but I think they're more like small storage units within the CPU rather than a functional unit. But the question is about major units.

Looking at the options, option B says the CPU has two major units: CU and ALU. That sounds right. Other options mention more units like cache memory, I/O management, etc. But wait, cache memory is a type of memory, not really a functional unit of the CPU itself. Similarly, I/O management is handled by other components, maybe the chipset or peripherals.

So the correct answer should be option B. Let me double-check the other options. Option C includes Internal Storage Unit (ISU) and Cache, which I don't think are the primary functional units. Option G adds more units which I believe are outside the CPU's main structure. So yeah, I think the answer is B.

The major functional units of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) are the Control Unit (CU) and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The CU manages data flow and instruction execution, while the ALU handles calculations and logical operations. Other components like cache memory and I/O management are not considered major functional units of the CPU itself. 

Answer: B
