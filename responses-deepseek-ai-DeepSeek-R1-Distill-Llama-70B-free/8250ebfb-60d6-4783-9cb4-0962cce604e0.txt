Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about hydrogen peroxide. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a solution of hydrogen peroxide is 30% by weight H₂O₂. The density is given as 1.11 g/cm³, and the dissociation constant is 1.0 × 10^-12. We need to find the pH of the solution.

Wait, wait. I remember that hydrogen peroxide is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The dissociation constant, K, is given, which probably refers to the acid dissociation constant, Ka. But wait, I'm a little confused because I thought H₂O₂ can act as both an acid and a base, but in this case, since it's in water, it's probably acting as an acid.

So first, I think I need to find the concentration of H₂O₂ in the solution. Because once I have that, I can use the Ka to find the concentration of H+ ions, which will give me the pH.

The solution is 30% by weight H₂O₂. That means in 100 grams of solution, 30 grams are H₂O₂ and 70 grams are water. But to find the molarity, I need to know the volume. Oh, right, density is mass per volume, so I can find the volume of the solution.

Density is 1.11 g/cm³. So for 100 grams of solution, volume is mass divided by density. So 100g / 1.11 g/cm³ ≈ 90.09 cm³, which is 0.09009 liters.

Now, the moles of H₂O₂. Molar mass of H₂O₂ is (2*1) + (2*16) = 2 +32=34 g/mol. So 30 grams is 30/34 ≈ 0.882 moles.

So the concentration is moles/volume = 0.882 / 0.09009 ≈ 9.79 M. Wait, that seems high, but okay.

Now, H₂O₂ dissociates as H₂O₂ ↔ H+ + HO₂⁻. The Ka is given as 1.0e-12. So the expression is Ka = [H+][HO₂⁻]/[H₂O₂].

Since Ka is small, the dissociation is minimal. So we can approximate that [H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka * C), where C is the concentration of H₂O₂. Wait, but wait, no, because that's for when the dissociation is x, and x<<C, so Ka ≈ x²/C. So x = sqrt(Ka * C).

Wait, let me think again. Let's set up the equation.

Let the concentration of H+ be x. Then, at equilibrium:

[H+] = x

[HO₂⁻] = x

[H₂O₂] ≈ 9.79 - x ≈ 9.79 (since x is very small, and 9.79 is large compared to x).

So Ka = x² / 9.79 = 1e-12.

So x² = 9.79 * 1e-12 → x = sqrt(9.79e-12) ≈ sqrt(9.79)*1e-6. The sqrt of 9.79 is about 3.13, so x ≈ 3.13e-6.

Then, [H+] is 3.13e-6, so pH is -log(3.13e-6). Let me calculate that.

Log(3.13) is about 0.495. So log(3.13e-6) is 0.495 -6 = -5.505. So pH is 5.505. Wait, no, wait: pH is -log[H+], so it's -(-5.505) = 5.505. So approximately pH 5.5.

Looking back at the options, option C is 5.5. But wait, wait a second. Wait, I'm getting 5.5, but looking at the options, option C is 5.5, but let me double-check my steps.

Wait, wait. Another point: considering that H₂O₂ is a weak acid, but when it dissociates, it produces H+ and HO₂⁻. But wait, could there be any other sources of H+? Like, does HO₂⁻ act as a base? Hmm, I think in this case, since we're dealing with the initial dissociation, and the Ka is given, we can ignore any further reactions, because the problem states the dissociation constant is 1.0e-12, so that's the Ka we use.

Wait, but another thing: when I calculated the concentration, I assumed that the 30% by weight translates directly to 30g in 100g solution, but wait, I should confirm the calculation.

30% by weight means that in 100 grams of solution, there's 30 grams of H₂O₂ and 70 grams of water. So the total mass is 100g.

Density is 1.11 g/cm³, so volume is 100g / 1.11 g/cm³. Let me compute that accurately.

100 /1.11 = approximately 90.09 cm³, which is 0.09009 liters.

Moles of H₂O₂: 30g / 34 g/mol ≈ 0.88235 mol.

Molarity = 0.88235 / 0.09009 ≈ 9.79 M. So that's correct.

So then, the Ka expression: x²/(9.79) = 1e-12 → x² = 9.79e-12 → x= sqrt(9.79e-12) = sqrt(9.79)*1e-6 → 3.13e-6.

pH is -log(3.13e-6) → which is around 5.5. So the option C is 5.5, which would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Some sources say that H₂O₂ has a pKa around 11.65, but that's when it's acting as a base. Wait, no, no, H₂O₂ can act as both an acid and a base, but in this case, we're dealing with its acidic dissociation. Wait, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the problem states that the dissociation constant is 1.0e-12. So I think that's the Ka for H₂O₂ acting as an acid: H₂O₂ ↔ H+ + HO₂⁻.

Wait, but I'm recalling that the pKa of H₂O₂ is around 11.7, which would make the Ka about 2e-12, but the problem says 1e-12, so perhaps that's a given value.

So with that, my calculation seems correct, leading to a pH of around 5.5, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again. Option C is 5.5, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the calculation. Another way to think: if the concentration is 9.79 M and Ka is 1e-12, then the H+ concentration is sqrt(9.79 * 1e-12) = sqrt(9.79)*1e-6 ≈ 3.13e-6 M. So pH is about 5.5.

But wait, another approach: maybe using the approximation that when Ka * C >> 1e-14, the solution is not too dilute, and the approximation holds. Here, Ka*C = (1e-12)(9.79) = ~9.79e-12, which is much larger than 1e-14, so the approximation [H+]=sqrt(Ka*C) is valid.

So my conclusion is pH is about 5.5, which is option C.

To determine the pH of a 30% by weight hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) solution with a density of 1.11 g/cm³ and a dissociation constant (Ka) of 1.0 × 10⁻¹², the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate the molarity of H₂O₂**:  
   - The solution is 30% by weight, meaning 30 g of H₂O₂ is present in 100 g of solution.  
   - The molar mass of H₂O₂ is 34 g/mol, so the moles of H₂O₂ are:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of H₂O₂} = \frac{30}{34} \approx 0.882 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
   - The volume of the solution is calculated using the density:  
     \[
     \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{100}{1.11} \approx 90.09 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.09009 \, \text{L}.
     \]  
   - The molarity of H₂O₂ is:  
     \[
     \text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.882}{0.09009} \approx 9.79 \, \text{M}.
     \]

2. **Determine the concentration of H⁺ ions**:  
   - Hydrogen peroxide dissociates as:  
     \[
     \text{H₂O₂} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{HO₂⁻}.
     \]  
   - Let the concentration of H⁺ ions at equilibrium be \(x\). Then, at equilibrium:  
     \[
     [\text{H⁺}] = x, \quad [\text{HO₂⁻}] = x, \quad [\text{H₂O₂}] \approx 9.79 - x \approx 9.79 \, \text{M}.
     \]  
   - Using the dissociation constant expression:  
     \[
     K_a = \frac{[H⁺][HO₂⁻]}{[H₂O₂]} = \frac{x^2}{9.79}.
     \]  
   - Substituting \(K_a = 1.0 \times 10^{-12}\):  
     \[
     x^2 = (1.0 \times 10^{-12})(9.79) \approx 9.79 \times 10^{-12}.
     \]  
   - Solving for \(x\):  
     \[
     x = \sqrt{9.79 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 3.13 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the pH**:  
   - The pH is given by:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = -\log[H⁺] = -\log(3.13 \times 10^{-6}).
     \]  
   - Breaking this down:  
     \[
     \log(3.13 \times 10^{-6}) = \log(3.13) + \log(10^{-6}) \approx 0.495 - 6 = -5.505.
     \]  
   - Therefore:  
     \[
     \text{pH} \approx 5.5.
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   - The pH of the solution is approximately 5.5, which corresponds to **option C**.
