Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many weeks it'll take for William Accra's company to reach an output of 190,000. The function given is F(t) = -10,000 + 50t^4, where t is the number of weeks. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that F(t) represents the output. So when they want to find the number of weeks to reach 190,000, that means I need to set F(t) equal to 190,000 and solve for t.

So the equation becomes 190,000 = -10,000 + 50t^4. My goal is to solve for t. 

Let me start by isolating the term with t. I'll add 10,000 to both sides to get rid of the negative. That gives me 190,000 + 10,000 = 50t^4. So that's 200,000 = 50t^4.

Next, I need to get t^4 by itself. I'll divide both sides by 50. 200,000 divided by 50 is 4,000. So now I have 4,000 = t^4.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 200,000 divided by 50. Let me calculate that again. 50 times 4,000 is 200,000, right? Yeah, because 50 * 4,000 is 200,000. So t^4 equals 4,000.

Wait, no, wait. If 50t^4 is 200,000, then t^4 is 200,000 / 50. 200,000 divided by 50 is 4,000. So yes, t^4 = 4,000.

Now I need to solve for t. To find t, I should take the fourth root of both sides. So t equals the fourth root of 4,000.

Hmm, what's the fourth root of 4,000? Let's think about this. Let me rewrite 4,000 to see if it's a power of some number. 4,000 is 4 * 1,000. And 1,000 is 10^3. So 4,000 is 4 * 10^3.

Wait, but for fourth roots, maybe it's better to express 4,000 as a power of 10. Let me think: 4,000 is the same as 4 * 10^3, which is 2^2 * (2*5)^3. Hmm, maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, 4,000 is 10^3 * 4, which is 10^3 * 2^2.

But perhaps it's easier to compute numerically. Let's think about what number to the fourth power gives 4,000.

I know that 10^4 is 10,000, which is bigger than 4,000. So the fourth root of 4,000 must be less than 10. Let's try 8: 8^4 is 4096. Oh, that's pretty close to 4,000. 8^4 is 4096, which is 96 more than 4,000. So t is around 8, but maybe a little less since 8^4 is a bit higher.

Wait, but the question asks for when output reaches 190,000. If at t=8, F(t) would be -10,000 +50*(8^4) = -10,000 +50*4096. Let's compute that: 50*4096 is 204,800. So F(8) is 204,800 -10,000 = 194,800. That's more than 190,000. So at 8 weeks, output is already 194,800, which is higher than 190,000.

But wait, the question is asking for when output reaches 190,000. So maybe it's a little less than 8 weeks. But wait, the options are all whole numbers, so perhaps the correct answer is 8 weeks because that's when it surpasses 190,000.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should compute F(7) and F(8) to see where exactly it crosses 190,000.

So for t=7: 7^4 is 7*7=49, 49*7=343, 343*7=2,401. So 50*2,401 = 120,050. Then subtract 10,000: 120,050 -10,000 = 110,050. That's way below 190,000.

t=8: as I said, F(8)=194,800.

So between t=7 and t=8, the output goes from 110,050 to 194,800. So it must reach 190,000 somewhere between 7 and 8 weeks. But the problem asks for how many weeks of work, and the options are in whole numbers. So perhaps the answer is 8 weeks because that's when it's first exceeded.

But wait, let me think again. Let me solve t^4=4000 more accurately to see what t is.

So t^4=4000 → t= (4000)^(1/4).

Hmm, 4000 can be written as 16 * 250. Because 16*250=4000. And 16 is 2^4, so 16 is 2^4, and 250 is 250.

So, (4000)^(1/4) = (16*250)^(1/4) = (16)^(1/4) * (250)^(1/4).

16^(1/4) is 2, since 2^4=16.

250^(1/4) is the fourth root of 250. Let's approximate that. Let's see, 3^4 is 81, 4^4 is 256. Oh wait, 4^4 is 256. So 250 is just a bit less than 256. So the fourth root of 250 is just a little less than 4.

So (250)^(1/4) ≈ 3.98 or something like that.

So multiplying by 2, 2 * 3.98 ≈7.96. So t ≈7.96 weeks. So about 7.96 weeks. That's approximately 8 weeks, but since the problem uses whole weeks, the output reaches 190,000 during the 8th week. So the answer would be 8 weeks.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 8 weeks.

But let me check again because sometimes when you set t^4=4000, perhaps I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, 50t^4 = 200,000 → t^4=4,000. Yes, that's correct.

So t is the fourth root of 4,000. Let me compute 4,000^(1/4) more accurately.

Another approach: Let's compute 7.9^4.

7.9^4: Let's compute step by step.

7.9^2 = 62.41.

Then, (62.41)^2 = approx 62.41 *62.41.

Let me compute that. 60*60=3,600. 60*2.41=144.6. 2.41*60=144.6. 2.41^2≈5.8081.

So, 62.41^2 = (60+2.41)^2 = 60^2 + 2*60*2.41 + 2.41^2.

So that's 3,600 + 289.2 + 5.8081 ≈3,600 + 289.2 = 3,889.2 +5.8081≈3,895.0081.

But wait, 7.9^4 is 3,895, which is less than 4,000. So 7.9^4=3,895.

What about 7.95^4? Let's see.

7.95 squared: 7.95 *7.95. Let's compute that.

7 *7 is 49. 7*0.95=6.65. 0.95*7=6.65. 0.95*0.95=0.9025.

So (7 +0.95)^2 =7^2 + 2*7*0.95 + 0.95^2 → 49 + 13.3 + 0.9025=63.2025.

So 7.95^2=63.2025.

Now compute (63.2025)^2 to get 7.95^4.

63.2025 *63.2025. Hmm, let's do it step by step.

63 *63 = 3,969.

63 *0.2025 = 12.7675.

0.2025 *63 =12.7675.

0.2025 *0.2025 ≈0.041006.

So, (63 +0.2025)^2 = 63^2 + 2*63*0.2025 + (0.2025)^2.

So 3,969 + 2*(12.7675) +0.041006.

2*12.7675=25.535.

So 3,969 +25.535=3,994.535 +0.041≈3,994.576.

So 7.95^4≈3,994.576, which is slightly less than 4,000. So 7.95^4≈3,994.576.

So 7.95 weeks gives t^4≈3,994.576.

We need t^4=4,000, so how much more than 7.95 is needed?

The difference between 4,000 and 3,994.576 is about 5.424.

So, each additional 0.01 week would increase t^4 by how much? Let's approximate.

The derivative of t^4 is 4t^3. At t=7.95, 4*(7.95)^3.

Compute 7.95^3 first.

7.95^3 =7.95 *7.95 *7.95.

We already have 7.95^2=63.2025. So 63.2025 *7.95.

Compute 63 *7.95 = 500.85.

0.2025 *7.95= approx 1.607875.

So total is approx 500.85 +1.607875≈502.457875.

So 7.95^3≈502.457875.

So the derivative at t=7.95 is 4*502.457875≈2,009.83.

So, the change in t needed to get from 3,994.576 to 4,000 is approximately Δt = (5.424)/2009.83 ≈0.0027 weeks.

So t≈7.95 + 0.0027≈7.9527 weeks.

So approximately 7.95 weeks, which is about 7 weeks and a little over 0.95 of a week. 0.95 of a week is about 0.95 *7 days≈6.65 days, so about 7 weeks and 6 and a half days. But since the problem is asking for weeks as whole numbers, and the output at t=8 is 194,800 which is above 190,000, then the company reaches the target during the 8th week.

So looking back at the options, option H is 8 weeks. So the correct answer should be H:8 weeks.
</think>

To determine how many weeks of work are required for William Accra's company to reach an output of 190,000, we start with the given output function:

\[
F(t) = -10,000 + 50t^4
\]

We set \( F(t) = 190,000 \) and solve for \( t \):

\[
190,000 = -10,000 + 50t^4
\]

First, add 10,000 to both sides:

\[
200,000 = 50t^4
\]

Next, divide both sides by 50:

\[
t^4 = 4,000
\]

To solve for \( t \), take the fourth root of both sides:

\[
t = \sqrt[4]{4,000}
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt[4]{4,000} \), we know that \( 8^4 = 4,096 \), which is slightly greater than 4,000. This means \( t \) is slightly less than 8 weeks. To refine further, calculate \( t \) more precisely:

\[
t \approx 7.95 \, \text{weeks}
\]

Since the problem asks for the number of weeks as a whole number, we check the output at \( t = 8 \):

\[
F(8) = -10,000 + 50(8^4) = -10,000 + 50(4,096) = 194,800
\]

At \( t = 8 \), the output exceeds 190,000. Therefore, the company reaches the target output during the 8th week. The correct answer is:

**H: 8 weeks**
