Okay, so I'm trying to find the degree of skewness for this distribution. Let me see, I remember that skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. If skewness is positive, the tail on the right side is longer or fatter; if negative, the left side.

The data given is in a grouped frequency table. So, I think I need to calculate the mean, then the deviations from the mean, cube them, and find the average, then adjust for the standard deviation. Wait, the formula for skewness is based on the third moment, right?

Let me jot down the data first:

Class Limits | Frequency | Midpoint
---|---|---
49-54 | 6 | 51.5
55-60 | 15 | 57.5
61-66 | 24 | 63.5
67-72 | 33 | 69.5
73-78 | 22 | 75.5

So, five classes. The first step is to calculate the mean (average) of all the data points. Since the data is grouped, I'll use the midpoints as representatives for each class.

Mean (x̄) = sum [(frequency * midpoint)] / total frequency.

Let me compute that.

First class: 6 * 51.5 = 309
Second: 15 *57.5= 862.5
Third:24 *63.5= 1524
Fourth:33 *69.5= 2291.5
Fifth:22 *75.5= 1651

Sum all these up: 309 + 862.5 = 1171.5; 1171.5 +1524=2695.5; 2695.5 +2291.5=4987; 4987 +1651=6638.

Total frequency: 6+15=21, +24=45, +33=78, +22=100. So N=100.

Mean x̄ = 6638 / 100 = 66.38.

Wait, let me double-check that sum: 309 +862.5 is 1171.5, plus 1524 is 2695.5, plus 2291.5 gives 4987, plus 1651 is 6638. Yes. So mean is 66.38.

Next, to find the skewness, I think I need the variance and standard deviation. Or wait, maybe another approach. Oh right, the formula for skewness when data is grouped is:

Skewness (S) = [sum (f_i * (x_i - x̄)^3)] / [N * σ^3]

Where σ is the standard deviation.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is:

S = [sum (f_i * (x_i - x̄)^3)] / (N * (sum f_i d^2)^1.5 )

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it step by step.

First, I need to compute each term (x_i - x̄)^3 multiplied by frequency f_i.

So, let's create a table.

For each class:

Midpoint (x_i) | f_i | x_i - x̄ | (x_i - x̄)^3 | f*(x_i - x̄)^3
---|---|---|---|---
51.5 |6| 51.5-66.38= -14.88 | (-14.88)^3 = let's calculate that. 14.88^3 is 14.88 *14.88= approx 221.7, then *14.88 again, around 3302. So (-14.88)^3 ≈ -3302. So 6*(-3302)= -19812.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

Compute (51.5 -66.38)= -14.88.

Cube of -14.88: (-14.88)^3 = (-14.88)* (-14.88)* (-14.88).

First, 14.88 squared: 14.88 *14.88. Let's compute 15^2 is 225, subtract 0.12*14.88*2.

Wait, 14.88^2 = (15 - 0.12)^2 = 225 - 2*(15)(0.12) + (0.12)^2 = 225 - 3.6 +0.0144= 221.4144.

Then, 14.88^3 is 14.88 * 221.4144.

Let me compute 14 * 221.4144 = 3098.8, 0.88*221.4144 ≈ 194.6. So total approx 3098.8 + 194.6 = 3293.4. So (-14.88)^3 ≈ -3293.4. Multiply by f_i=6: 6*(-3293.4)= -19760.4.

Hmm, that's a big number. Let's go to the next class.

Second class:

Midpoint 57.5. f=15.

x_i - x̄ =57.5 -66.38= -8.88.

Cube: (-8.88)^3 = - (8.88^3).

8.88 squared is 78.8544. 8.88 *78.8544 = let me compute 8*78.8544= 630.8352, 0.88*78.8544≈ 69.36. So about 630.8352 +69.36= 700.1952.

So cube is about 8.88 * 700.1952. Wait, no, 8.88^3 is 8.88 *8.88 *8.88. Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, 8.88 squared is 78.8544. 8.88 *78.8544 = let's do 8 *78.8544=630.8352, 0.88 *78.8544≈69.36. So 630.8352 +69.36=700.1952. So 8.88^3=700.1952. So (-8.88)^3= -700.1952.

Multiply by 15: 15*(-700.1952)= -10502.928.

Third class:

Midpoint 63.5, f=24.

x_i - x̄ =63.5 -66.38= -2.88.

Cube: (-2.88)^3= -23.89 (approx). Let's compute 2.88^3.

2.88^2=8.2944, 2.88*8.2944= approx 23.89. So cube is -23.89.

Multiply by 24: 24*(-23.89)= -572.16.

Fourth class:

Midpoint 69.5, f=33.

x_i - x̄=69.5 -66.38=3.12.

Cube: 3.12^3. 3^3 is 27, 0.12^3 is 0.001728. Let's compute accurately:

3.12 *3.12 =9.7344. 9.7344 *3.12 = let's compute 9 *3.12=28.08, 0.7344*3.12≈2.293. Total ≈30.373. So 3.12^3≈30.373.

Multiply by 33: 33*30.373 ≈1002.29.

Fifth class:

Midpoint 75.5, f=22.

x_i -x̄=75.5 -66.38=9.12.

Cube: 9.12^3. Let's compute 9^3=729, 0.12^3=0.001728. But better to compute accurately:

9.12 *9.12 = 83.1744. Then 83.1744 *9.12. Let's compute 80*9.12=729.6, 3.1744*9.12≈29. So total approx 729.6 +29=758.6. So 9.12^3≈758.6.

Multiply by 22: 22*758.6≈16,679.2.

Now, sum all the f*(x_i - x̄)^3:

First class: -19760.4

Second: -10502.928 → total so far: -19760.4 -10502.928 = -30263.328

Third: -572.16 → total: -30263.328-572.16= -30835.488

Fourth: +1002.29 → total: -30835.488 +1002.29 = -29833.198

Fifth: +16,679.2 → total: -29833.198 +16679.2 = -13154.0 approximately.

Wait, let me add them more accurately:

First: -19760.4

Second: -10502.928 → sum: -19760.4 -10502.928 = -30263.328

Third: -572.16 → sum: -30263.328 -572.16 = -30835.488

Fourth: +1002.29 → sum: -30835.488 +1002.29 = -29833.198

Fifth: +16679.2 → sum: -29833.198 +16679.2 = -13154.0.

So sum(f*(x_i - x̄)^3) = approximately -13154.0.

Now, I need to compute this sum divided by [N * σ^3], where σ is the standard deviation.

So first, compute σ. To find σ, I need the variance first.

Variance formula for grouped data is:

Variance = [sum(f_i*(x_i - x̄)^2)] / N.

So, let's compute sum(f_i*(x_i -x̄)^2).

Using the same table, I can compute each term.

First class:

(51.5 -66.38)^2 = (-14.88)^2 = 221.4144. Multiply by 6: 6*221.4144=1328.4864.

Second class:

(57.5 -66.38)^2= (-8.88)^2=78.8544. Multiply by 15: 15 *78.8544=1182.816.

Third class:

(63.5 -66.38)^2= (-2.88)^2=8.2944. Multiply by 24: 24*8.2944=198.9056.

Fourth class:

(69.5-66.38)^2=3.12^2=9.7344. Multiply by33: 33*9.7344=321.225.

Fifth class:

75.5-66.38=9.12^2=83.1744. Multiply by22: 22*83.1744=1830.8368.

Now sum all these:

First:1328.4864

Second:+1182.816 → 2511.3024

Third:+198.9056 →2709.3 (approx, but let's be precise: 2511.3024 +198.9056=2710.208)

Fourth:+321.225 → 2710.208 +321.225=3031.433

Fifth:+1830.8368 →3031.433 +1830.8368=4862.2698.

So sum(f*(x_i - x̄)^2)=4862.2698.

Variance = 4862.2698 /100 =48.622698.

Standard deviation σ= sqrt(48.6227)≈6.97.

Now, σ^3= (6.97)^3. Let's compute that.

6.97^2= approx 48.58, then 48.58 *6.97 ≈ 338.7.

Wait, more accurately: 6.97 *6.97 = let's compute 7*7=49, subtract 0.03*7*2=0.42, then add 0.03^2=0.0009. So 49 -0.42 +0.0009=48.5809.

Then, 6.97 *48.5809.

Let me compute 6 *48.5809=291.4854, 0.97 *48.5809≈47.203. So total ≈291.4854 +47.203=338.688.

So σ^3≈338.688.

Now, back to skewness:

Numerator is sum(f*(x_i -x̄)^3)= -13154.0.

Denominator is N * σ^3 =100 *338.688=33868.8.

So skewness S= -13154 /33868.8 ≈-0.388.

Wait, let me compute that division.

13154 divided by 33868.8.

33868.8 / 13154 ≈2.574, so 1/2.574≈0.388.

So S≈-0.388.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are:

A: 2.1

B: - .89

C: 0.58

D: - .44

E: 0.33

F: 1.67

G: 1.2

H: 0.99

I: -0.75

J: -1.05

So the closest to -0.388 is option D: -0.44, or maybe option I is -0.75, which is more negative. Since my calculation is approximately -0.39, which is near -0.44, so option D.

To calculate the degree of skewness for the given grouped data, we follow these steps:

### Data and Midpoints
The data is provided in the form of class limits, frequencies, and midpoints:

| Class Limits | Frequency | Midpoint |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 49 - 54     | 6         | 51.5     |
| 55 - 60     | 15        | 57.5     |
| 61 - 66     | 24        | 63.5     |
| 67 - 72     | 33        | 69.5     |
| 73 - 78     | 22        | 75.5     |

### Step 1: Calculate the Mean
The mean (\( \bar{x} \)) is calculated as:

\[
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum (f_i \cdot x_i)}{N}
\]

Where \( f_i \) is the frequency, \( x_i \) is the midpoint, and \( N = \sum f_i = 100 \).

\[
\bar{x} = \frac{(6 \cdot 51.5) + (15 \cdot 57.5) + (24 \cdot 63.5) + (33 \cdot 69.5) + (22 \cdot 75.5)}{100}
\]

\[
\bar{x} = \frac{309 + 862.5 + 1524 + 2291.5 + 1651}{100} = \frac{6638}{100} = 66.38
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Skewness
The formula for skewness (\( S \)) for grouped data is:

\[
S = \frac{\sum (f_i \cdot (x_i - \bar{x})^3)}{N \cdot \sigma^3}
\]

Where \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.

#### Step 2.1: Calculate \( \sum (f_i \cdot (x_i - \bar{x})^3) \)
For each class, compute \( (x_i - \bar{x})^3 \), multiply by \( f_i \), and sum the results:

| Class Limits | \( x_i \) | \( x_i - \bar{x} \) | \( (x_i - \bar{x})^3 \) | \( f_i \cdot (x_i - \bar{x})^3 \) |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 49 - 54     | 51.5     | -14.88                | -3293.4                     | -19760.4                         |
| 55 - 60     | 57.5     | -8.88                 | -700.2                      | -10502.8                         |
| 61 - 66     | 63.5     | -2.88                 | -23.9                       | -572.2                           |
| 67 - 72     | 69.5     | 3.12                  | 30.4                        | 1002.3                           |
| 73 - 78     | 75.5     | 9.12                  | 758.6                       | 16679.2                          |

\[
\sum (f_i \cdot (x_i - \bar{x})^3) = -19760.4 - 10502.8 - 572.2 + 1002.3 + 16679.2 = -13154.0
\]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate \( \sigma^3 \)
First, calculate the variance (\( \sigma^2 \)):

\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (f_i \cdot (x_i - \bar{x})^2)}{N}
\]

For each class, compute \( (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \), multiply by \( f_i \), and sum the results:

| Class Limits | \( x_i \) | \( x_i - \bar{x} \) | \( (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \) | \( f_i \cdot (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \) |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 49 - 54     | 51.5     | -14.88                | 221.4                       | 1328.5                           |
| 55 - 60     | 57.5     | -8.88                 | 78.8                        | 1182.8                           |
| 61 - 66     | 63.5     | -2.88                 | 8.3                         | 198.9                            |
| 67 - 72     | 69.5     | 3.12                  | 9.7                         | 321.2                            |
| 73 - 78     | 75.5     | 9.12                  | 83.2                        | 1830.8                           |

\[
\sum (f
