Okay, so I have this problem about a sinking fund, and I'm supposed to find the value of the fund after fifteen years. The question says that Mr. Stade set up a sinking fund requiring $1000 deposits made over 20 years at an annual rate of 3 and a half percent. So, I'm a bit rusty on my finance formulas, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that a sinking fund is a type of investment where you make regular deposits, and the goal is to have a certain amount at the end of the period. The formula for the future value of such a fund is probably needed here.

The formula I think is something like FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r, where PMT is the annual deposit, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years. Wait, but wait, let me get that right. Oh right, that's the future value of an ordinary annuity. Since the deposits are made at the end of each period (year, in this case), it's an ordinary annuity.

So, the variables here are:
- PMT = $1000 per year
- r = 3.5% per annum, which is 0.035
- But wait, the deposits are made over 20 years, but we're looking for the fund's value after 15 years. So n would be 15, not 20, because that's when we're measuring the value.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, the sinking fund is set up to have deposits made over 20 years, but the question is asking what's the value after 15 years. So each year, $1000 is deposited, starting now (I think) and each subsequent year, for 20 years. But we're stopping at 15 years. So that's correct, n is 15.

So the formula would be FV = 1000 * [ (1 + 0.035)^15 - 1 ] / 0.035.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate (1 + 0.035) which is 1.035. Then raise it to the 15th power. Hmm, I don't have a calculator, but I can approximate or maybe remember some values.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can compute it using logarithms or something, but that might take time. Alternatively, I can think about the rule of 72 to estimate, but that's not precise enough.

Wait, perhaps I can break it down. Let me think: 1.035^15.

Alternatively, I can compute it year by year for a few steps, but that's going to take too long. Maybe I can remember that 1.035^10 is approximately 1.40255. Then, 1.035^5 is about 1.1875. So 1.035^15 would be 1.40255 * 1.1875 ≈ let's see:

1.40255 * 1.1875 ≈ 1.40255 * 1.1875. Let me compute that:

1.40255 * 1 = 1.40255
1.40255 * 0.1875 ≈ 0.26298 (because 1.40255 * 0.125 is 0.17532, and 1.40255 * 0.0625 is approx 0.08766; adding those gives 0.26298).

So total is approximately 1.6655. So (1.035)^15 ≈ 1.6655.

So the numerator in the formula is 1.6655 - 1 = 0.6655.

Then, divide that by 0.035: 0.6655 / 0.035 ≈ 19.014.

So then, FV = 1000 * 19.014 = 19,014 approximately.

Looking at the options, E is $19,296, which is close. But wait, maybe my approximation for 1.035^15 was a bit off. Let me try a more accurate method.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for compound interest:

Each deposit of $1000 is compounded for a different number of years. The first deposit is made at the end of the first year, so it has 14 years to grow. The second deposit, at the end of the second year, has 13 years, and so on, until the 15th deposit, which doesn't earn any interest beyond the first year, right?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, when you make a deposit at the end of year 1, it's invested for (15 - 1) =14 years. The deposit at end of year 2 is invested for 13 years, and so on, until the deposit at end of year 15, which is invested for 0 years (so it's just $1000). So the future value would be the sum of each deposit compounded for the respective years.

So FV = 1000*(1.035)^14 + 1000*(1.035)^13 + ... + 1000*(1.035)^0.

This is a geometric series where each term is 1000*(1.035)^k, where k ranges from 0 to 14. So the sum is 1000 * [ (1.035)^15 - 1 ] / 0.035.

Wait, that's the same formula as before. So I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 1.035^15. Let me try a more precise approach.

Using a calculator step by step:

1.035^1 = 1.035
1.035^2 = 1.035 * 1.035 = 1.071225
1.035^3 = 1.071225 * 1.035 ≈ 1.108967
1.035^4 ≈ 1.108967 * 1.035 ≈ 1.147005
1.035^5 ≈ 1.147005 * 1.035 ≈ 1.187500 (actually, it's exactly 1.187528... since 1.035^5 is approx 1.187528)
1.035^10 = (1.187528)^2 ≈ 1.411315
1.035^15 = 1.411315 * 1.187528 ≈ let's compute that:

1.411315 * 1.187528 ≈ 

Let me compute 1.4 * 1.187528 first: 1.4 * 1.187528 = 1.66154

Then, 0.011315 * 1.187528 ≈ approx 0.01343.

So total approx 1.66154 + 0.01343 = 1.67497.

So 1.035^15 ≈ 1.67497.

Then, the numerator is 1.67497 - 1 = 0.67497.

Divide by 0.035: 0.67497 / 0.035 ≈ 19.284.

Multiply by 1000: 19,284.

Looking at the options, E is $19,296, which is very close. So it must be E.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a minor error in the exponentials.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is 3 and a half percent, which is 3.5%, so 0.035. So the calculation would be correct as per the formula.

So, FV = 1000 * [ (1.035)^15 - 1 ] / 0.035 ≈ 1000 * (1.67497 - 1)/0.035 = 1000 * 0.67497 / 0.035.

0.67497 / 0.035 equals approximately 19.284, so FV is approximately $19,284.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: $19,296. So that's probably the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me try to compute 1.035^15 more precisely.

Compute step by step:

1.035^1 = 1.035

1.035^2 = 1.035 * 1.035 = 1.071225

1.035^3 = 1.071225 * 1.035 ≈ 1.071225 + (1.071225 * 0.035) = 1.071225 + 0.037542875 ≈ 1.108767875

1.035^4 ≈ 1.108767875 * 1.035

Let me compute that:

1.108767875 * 1.035. 

1.108767875 * 1 = 1.108767875

1.108767875 * 0.035 = approx 0.038807. So total ≈ 1.108768 + 0.038807 ≈ 1.147575.

1.035^4 ≈ 1.147575

1.035^5 = 1.147575 * 1.035 ≈ 1.147575 + (1.147575 * 0.035) = 1.147575 + 0.040164 ≈ 1.187739.

1.035^5 ≈ 1.187739.

1.035^10 would be (1.187739)^2.

1.187739 * 1.187739 ≈ let me compute that:

1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21

0.08 * 1.1 = 0.088, so 1.187739 is 1.1 + 0.087739.

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 1.187739 squared:

= (1 + 0.187739)^2 = 1 + 2*0.187739 + (0.187739)^2

= 1 + 0.375478 + 0.03524 ≈ 1.410718.

So 1.035^10 ≈ 1.410718.

Now, 1.035^15 = 1.035^10 * 1.035^5 ≈ 1.410718 * 1.187739.

Let me compute that:

1.410718 * 1.187739.

Multiply 1.4 * 1.187739 = approx 1.66263.

Then, 0.010718 * 1.187739 ≈ approx 0.01275.

So total is approx 1.66263 + 0.01275 ≈ 1.67538.

Thus, 1.035^15 ≈ 1.67538.

Then, [1.67538 - 1] = 0.67538.

Divide by 0.035: 0.67538 / 0.035 = 19.29714.

Multiply by 1000: 19,297.14.

Which is about $19,297.14. So looking at the options, option E is $19,296, which is very close. So the answer must be E.

Wait, but option B is $19,648. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the number of periods? Wait, the deposits are made over 20 years, but we're only looking at the first 15 years. So the number of deposits is 15, each of $1000.

So yes, n=15, so the formula should be correct as used. So the answer would be E.
</think>

To determine the value of the sinking fund after 15 years, we use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

\[
FV = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( PMT = \$1000 \) (annual deposit),
- \( r = 0.035 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 15 \) (number of years).

### Step 1: Calculate \((1 + r)^n\)
\[
(1 + 0.035)^{15} = 1.035^{15}
\]

Using approximations and step-by-step calculations:
\[
1.035^{15} \approx 1.67497
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the numerator
\[
(1.67497 - 1) = 0.67497
\]

### Step 3: Divide by \( r \)
\[
\frac{0.67497}{0.035} \approx 19.284
\]

### Step 4: Multiply by \( PMT \)
\[
FV = 1000 \times 19.284 = \$19,284
\]

### Step 5: Match to the closest option
The closest value to \$19,284 is **\$19,296**, which corresponds to option **E**.
