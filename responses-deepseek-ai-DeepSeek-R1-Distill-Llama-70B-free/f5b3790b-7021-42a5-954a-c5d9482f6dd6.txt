D: 65
E: $61.20
F: $64.00
G: $62.50

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of inventory costing methods. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So, the problem is about Cobb Inc. and their inventory. They use the periodic inventory system, which I remember means they don't track the cost of goods sold each time they make a sale. Instead, they wait until the end of the period to calculate everything.

At May 1st, Cobb's inventory had 200 units with a total cost of $1250. So, the cost per unit then was $6.25 because 1250 divided by 200 is 6.25. But wait, let me check that: 200 times 6 is 1200, plus 50 gives 1250. Yep, that's right.

Then, during May, they made two purchases. The first was on May 4th, buying 20 units at $5.80 each. So, let me calculate the total cost for that purchase. 20 times 5.80 is 116 dollars. Right, and the second purchase was on May 17th, 80 units at 5.50 each. 80 times 5.50 is 440 dollars. So, total purchases for May are 116 plus 440, which is 556 dollars. 

So, the total inventory available for sale during May would be the beginning inventory plus the purchases. That's 1250 (beginning) plus 556 (purchases) equals 1806 dollars. And the total units available are 200 plus 20 plus 80, which is 300 units.

Wait, wait. Oh, no, wait. Wait, the beginning inventory is 200 units, so adding the two purchases (20 and 80) gives a total of 300 units. But the total cost is 1250 plus 116 plus 440, which is 1806. So the weighted average cost per unit would be total cost divided by total units. Let me compute that: 1806 divided by 300. Let me do the math. 300 times 6 is 1800, so 1806 is 6 more, so 6.02 dollars per unit? Wait, let me calculate it properly. 300 into 1806: 300 * 6 is 1800, so 1806-1800 is 6. So 6/300 is 0.02. So the average is 6.02 dollars per unit.

But wait, the question is about the cost of goods sold. Cobb sold 10 units on May 14th. So to find the cost of goods sold, we use the weighted average cost per unit at the time of sale. But wait, in periodic inventory, the cost is based on the average during the period, right? So the average cost per unit for the entire period is 1806/300, which is 6.02 dollars.

So each unit sold would cost 6.02, so 10 units would be 10 times 6.02, which is 60.20 dollars. Let me check the options. Option A is $60.20. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let's double-check the total cost and units. 

Beginning inventory: 200 units at 1250, so 200 * 6.25 is 1250. Then May 4: 20 units at 5.80 each is 116, May 17: 80 units at 5.50 each is 440. So total cost: 1250 + 116 = 1366, plus 440 is 1806. Total units: 200 + 20 = 220, plus 80 is 300. So 1806 / 300 is indeed 6.02.

So the COGS is 10 units * 6.02 = 60.20. So the answer should be A: $60.20.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because another thought: wait, sometimes in periodic, the cost is determined at the end of the period, but if the sale happened before the second purchase, does that affect the average? Because the first purchase was on May 4, and the sale was on May 14. So from May 1 to May 4, the only inventory was the beginning 200 units. Then they bought 20 more on May 4, making 220, and then sold 10 on May 14. Then on May 17, bought another 80. 

Wait, but in periodic, the COGS is calculated based on the average for the whole period, regardless of when the sale happened. So the sale is matched against the average of all goods available during the period, right? So the total available for sale is 300 units at a total of 1806, so average is 6.02. So the 10 units sold would cost 60.20.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is A.

To determine Cobb Inc.'s weighted average cost of goods sold for May, we start by calculating the total inventory available for sale and the associated costs. 

1. **Beginning Inventory (May 1):**  
   Cobb had 200 units at a total cost of $1,250.  

2. **Purchases During May:**  
   - On May 4, 20 units were purchased at $5.80 each, totaling $116.  
   - On May 17, 80 units were purchased at $5.50 each, totaling $440.  

   The total cost of purchases is $116 + $440 = $556.  

3. **Total Inventory Available for Sale:**  
   The total cost of inventory available for sale is the sum of the beginning inventory and purchases:  
   \[
   \$1,250 + \$556 = \$1,806
   \]  
   The total number of units available for sale is:  
   \[
   200 + 20 + 80 = 300 \, \text{units}
   \]  

4. **Weighted Average Cost Per Unit:**  
   The weighted average cost per unit is calculated by dividing the total cost of inventory by the total number of units:  
   \[
   \frac{\$1,806}{300} = \$6.02 \, \text{per unit}
   \]  

5. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**  
   Cobb sold 10 units on May 14. Using the weighted average cost per unit, the COGS is:  
   \[
   10 \times \$6.02 = \$60.20
   \]  

Thus, Cobb's weighted average cost of goods sold for May is **$60.20**.  

**Answer: A**
