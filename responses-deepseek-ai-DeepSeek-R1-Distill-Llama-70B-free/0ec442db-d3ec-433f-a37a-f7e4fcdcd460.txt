Question:

A farmer owned a 40-acre tract of farmland located in a small southern town. The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. " The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?

Options:

A: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.
B: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.
C: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
D: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about a legal case involving a farmer and a tenant. I'm a bit rusty on my contract law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let's summarize the facts. The farmer leased a 40-acre tract to a tenant for seven years, starting in 2000 and ending in 2007. The lease included a provision where the tenant has to pay $5,000 monthly and keep the building in good repair. There's also an option for the tenant to buy 10 acres at the end of the lease for $150,000. Before signing the lease, the farmer orally promised to have the 10-acre tract surveyed. In the last year, the tenant decided to exercise the option and started building an irrigation ditch without the farmer knowing. When the tenant told the farmer, the farmer refused and said he never surveyed the land.

The question is about the farmer's best defense if the tenant sues for specific performance. The options are A to D, each pointing to a different legal principle.

I need to figure out which defense the farmer can use. Let's break down each option.

Option A: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule. Hmm, parol evidence rule deals with prior or contemporaneous oral agreements being excluded when a written contract exists. But the option here is part of the written lease, so I don't think that applies. Unless the oral promise about the survey is considered, but the option itself is in the lease, so A might not be the right choice.

Option B: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from obligations. Wait, the lease option didn't state that the farmer must survey as a condition. The farmer made an oral promise to survey before the lease, but the lease itself didn't include that. So maybe the farmer's failure isn't a breach because it wasn't part of the written contract. However, if the tenant relied on that promise, could that affect the enforceability? I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the survey wasn't a condition for the option, then the farmer's failure might not matter. So B might be a possible defense, but I'm not certain.

Option C: The description of the property was too indefinite. The lease says 10 acres, but does it specify which part? The tenant started building on the northern section without the farmer's knowledge. Wait, the option is for 10 acres, but was it specified where? If the lease didn't describe which 10 acres, maybe it's too vague. Specific performance requires a clear description of the property. So if the lease just says 10 acres without more details, the court might find it too indefinite. That could prevent specific performance because the farmer can't be forced to convey undefined land. So C seems like a strong possibility.

Option D: The option lacked separate consideration. Option contracts in leases usually don't require separate consideration because they're part of the same agreement. As long as the lease is valid, the option is supported by the consideration of the lease. So D is probably incorrect.

So now, evaluating the options. A is about parol evidence, but the option is in the written lease, so maybe A isn't right. B could be about a promise outside the lease, but the lease didn't require the survey. C is about the property description being too vague. D is about consideration, which I think isn't an issue here.

The tenant is suing for specific performance, which requires that the contract terms clearly identify the property. If the lease just says "10 acres" without specifying which part, the description might be too indefinite. The farmer could argue that he can't be forced to sell an unspecified portion, making C the best defense.

The farmer's best defense is that the description of the property in the lease was too indefinite to permit specific performance. The lease granted the tenant an option to purchase "10 acres" of the 40-acre tract but did not specify which particular 10 acres were intended. Specific performance requires a clear and definite description of the property to be transferred, as courts cannot compel the transfer of property that is not adequately identified. Since the lease did not provide sufficient details to identify the specific 10-acre portion, this lack of clarity undermines the tenant's claim for specific performance. 

Other options are less viable: the parol evidence rule (Option A) does not apply because the option was part of the written lease; the farmer's failure to survey (Option B) was not a condition of the lease; and the option did not lack consideration (Option D), as it was part of the lease agreement.

Answer: C
