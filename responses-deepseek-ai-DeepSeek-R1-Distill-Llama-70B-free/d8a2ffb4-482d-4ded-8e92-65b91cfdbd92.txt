Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating an annual interest rate for a movie camera purchase. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the camera costs $98, and there's an installment plan. The plan requires 10% down, and then the balance is paid over 24 weekly payments of $4 each. I need to find the annual interest rate.

First, let's figure out how much the down payment is. 10% of $98. So that's 0.10 * 98 = $9.80. So the down payment is $9.80.

Now, the remaining balance after the down payment is 98 - 9.80 = $88.20. This $88.20 is paid over 24 weeks, with each payment being $4. So let me check: 24 * 4 = $96. So the total paid in installments is $96.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial balance is $88.20, but the total payments are $96. So the extra $96 - $88.20 = $7.80 must be the interest paid over the 24 weeks.

But wait, is that the case? Or is there another way to calculate the interest?

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the total amount paid and the principal. The total amount paid is the down payment plus the installments. That's 9.80 + (24 * 4) = 9.80 + 96 = $105.80.

So the total cost is $105.80 for a $98 camera. The extra is $7.80, which is the interest over 24 weeks. So the interest is $7.80.

But wait, that seems low. Let me double-check. The principal after the down payment is $88.20. So the interest would be the total payments minus the principal: 24 * 4 = $96; $96 - $88.20 = $7.80. Yes, that's correct.

Now, to find the annual interest rate, I need to calculate the rate over the 24 weeks and then annualize it. Since the payments are weekly, 24 weeks is 24/52 of a year, approximately 0.4615 years.

Wait, but in finance, when calculating interest rates for installment plans, sometimes the interest is calculated using the simple interest method or perhaps the add-on method. The add-on method adds the interest to the principal upfront.

Let me think about which method applies here. In the add-on method, the interest is calculated on the initial principal and added to determine the total amount to be paid in installments. So the total amount paid is principal plus interest, and then that's divided into installments.

Alternatively, maybe I should model this as a loan with 24 weekly payments. The formula for the interest rate in such a case would involve the present value of an annuity.

Wait, perhaps using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula would be the way to go. The formula is:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r

Where PV is the present value (the amount financed), PMT is the payment per period, r is the periodic interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this case, the amount financed is $88.20, the payment is $4 per week, and n is 24 weeks. So we can plug these into the formula and solve for r.

But since this is a bit complex without a financial calculator, perhaps I can approximate it or use another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the total interest is $7.80 over 24 weeks. So the interest per week is 7.80 /24 = $0.325.

Wait, but that's not the rate. The rate would be based on the principal each week. But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total interest, then find the rate over the 24 weeks, then multiply by the number of periods in a year to get the annual rate.

So total interest is $7.80 over 24 weeks. The rate per week would be (7.80 / 88.20) / 24. Let me compute that: 7.80 /88.20 = 0.0883636... So 0.0883636 /24 ≈ 0.0036826 per week.

So the weekly rate is approximately 0.36826%. To get the annual rate, multiply by 52 weeks: 0.36826 *52 ≈ 19.16%. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the choices are 50%, 10%, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because when calculating the interest rate, using simple interest may not give the correct effective rate. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the effective annual rate based on the given information.

Another approach: The amount financed is $88.20, paid over 24 weeks at $4 each week. The total paid is $96, so interest is $7.80, as I calculated before.

If I model this as a simple interest loan, the interest is I = P * r * t, where P is principal, r is rate, t is time in years.

Here, I = 7.80, P = 88.20, t = 24/52 years.

So rearranging, r = I/(P*t) = 7.80 / (88.20 * (24/52)).

Let me compute that denominator first: 88.20 * (24/52) = 88.20 * 0.4615 ≈ 40.72.

So r = 7.80 / 40.72 ≈ 0.1916, or 19.16%. That's approximately 19.16%, but I don't see that option. The closest options are 15%, 24%, 29.9%, etc.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the interest is calculated differently, such as using the rule of 78 or some other method, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the total amount paid to compute the rate. The total amount is $105.80 for a $98 camera, so the interest is $7.80 over the period. But that period is two years? Wait, no, 24 weeks is about half a year.

Wait, no, 24 weeks is roughly 6 months, so half a year. So if the interest is $7.80 over 6 months, then the annual rate would be (7.80 *2 ) /98.

Wait, that would be 15.60 /98 = 0.159 or 15.9%. But the options don't have 15.9, but option I is 15%. Close, but maybe not exact.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the interest is $7.80 over 24 weeks, which is 0.4615 years. So the annual rate would be (7.80 /88.20) / 0.4615.

Wait, 7.80 /88.20 is approximately 0.08836. Divided by 0.4615 gives about 0.1916, or 19.16%. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should model it as a simple interest loan but calculate APR differently.

Wait, maybe using the formula for APR, which is (total interest / principal) / (term in years) * 100.

So total interest is $7.80, principal $88.20, term is 24/52 ≈ 0.4615 years.

So APR = (7.80 /88.20) / 0.4615 * 100.

Compute 7.80 /88.20 = 0.08836.

0.08836 / 0.4615 ≈ 0.1916, so 19.16% APR.

But the options don't have 19.16, so perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the interest is calculated differently. Perhaps it's a flat interest rate. Let me think: the total amount to be paid is $96 on a principal of $88.20 over 24 weeks.

So the total interest is $7.80. Flat rate would be (7.80 /88.20)*100 = 8.836% for 24 weeks.

But to get the annual rate, we'd multiply by the number of periods in a year. Since 24 weeks is about 0.4615 years, the annual rate would be 8.836% / 0.4615 = approx 19.16%, same as before.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. Oh wait, the 24 payments are weekly, so that's 24 weeks, but perhaps it's 24 months? No, the question says 24 weekly payments, so 24 weeks.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the total interest calculation. Let me re-examine that.

Total cost is $98. Down payment is 10% so $9.80. The remaining is $88.20. Then, each week, the payment is $4, and there's 24 payments. So 24 *4= $96.

So the total paid is $9.80 + $96 = $105.80. The interest is $105.80 - $98 = $7.80. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on the initial amount, not on the remaining balance. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated using the simple interest formula: Interest = P * r * t.

But in this case, P is $98, and t is 24 weeks. Wait, but the down payment is made immediately, so maybe the principal reduces after the down payment. So P after down is $88.20, t is 24 weeks.

Wait, but the interest is $7.80, so 7.80 = 88.20 * r * (24/52).

So solving for r: r = 7.80 / (88.20 * (24/52)).

Compute denominator:

88.20 * 24 = 2116.8.

2116.8 /52 = 40.725.

So r =7.80 /40.725 ≈ 0.1916, which is 19.16%.

But the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe the interest is being calculated using the add-on method, where the interest is calculated upfront and added to the principal.

In the add-on method, the total amount to be paid is principal plus interest, which is then divided into payments.

So, the interest for the entire period is calculated on the principal.

So, if the principal after down payment is $88.20, and the interest is added upfront, then the total amount owed is 88.20 + (88.20 * r * t), where t is the term in years.

This total is then divided into 24 payments of $4 each. So total payments sum to 24 *4 = $96.

So, 88.20 + (88.20 * r * (24/52)) ) = 96.

So,

88.20 * (1 + r*(24/52)) ) = 96.

Divide both sides by 88.20:

1 + r*(24/52) = 96/88.20.

Compute 96/88.20 ≈ 1.08836.

So,

r*(24/52) = 0.08836.

So,

r = (0.08836) * (52/24).

Compute 52/24 ≈ 2.1667.

0.08836 * 2.1667 ≈ 0.1916, so r ≈ 19.16%.

Again, same result. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the interest as part of each payment, so using the amortization method. In that case, the interest rate calculation would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the present value of an annuity formula.

The present value (PV) is the amount financed, $88.20.

Each payment (PMT) is $4.

Number of periods (n) is 24.

We can use the formula:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

So,

88.20 = 4 * [1 - (1 + r)^-24 ] / r.

Dividing both sides by 4:

22.05 = [1 - (1 + r)^-24 ] / r.

Now, this equation can be solved for r. But solving this without a calculator is tricky. Maybe I can estimate.

Let me try plugging in some of the given options to see which one fits.

Option F is 48%, so 0.48 per period.

But that's probably too high. Let's try a lower rate.

Let's try option C: 29.9% annual rate. So the weekly rate would be 29.9% /52 ≈ 0.575 per week? Wait, no, 29.9% annual is about 0.0575 per week (0.299/52 ≈ 0.00575).

Wait, maybe that's too low. Let me compute:

Using r = 0.0575 per week.

Compute [1 - (1 + 0.0575)^-24 ] / 0.0575.

First, compute (1.0575)^24. Let's see:

But calculating (1.0575)^24 without a calculator is tough. Alternatively, perhaps I can use approximation.

But maybe it's easier to try a higher rate. Let's try option E: 36.8% annual, so weekly rate is 36.8/52 ≈ 0.7077% per week.

So r = 0.007077.

Compute [1 - (1.007077)^-24 ] / 0.007077.

Again, without a calculator, this is hard, but perhaps I can estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 78 or another quick estimation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for interest rates when dealing with installment loans. The formula for the approximate APR when payments are equal is:

APR ≈ (2 * n * I) / (P * (n + 1)),

where n is the number of payments, I is the total interest, P is the principal.

So here, n=24, I=7.80, P=88.20.

APR ≈ (2 *24 *7.80) / (88.20 * (24 +1)).

Compute numerator: 2 *24 *7.80 = 48 *7.80 = 374.4.

Denominator: 88.20 *25 = 2205.

So APR ≈ 374.4 /2205 ≈ 0.1698 or 16.98%.

Hmm, that's closer to 17%, but the options don't have that. The closest is option I:15% or J:24%.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the N-ratio formula or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total interest and the average principal.

The average principal would be (88.20 + 0)/2 = 44.10, since it's paid down over 24 weeks. Wait, no, because each payment is $4, which might include both principal and interest.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, I can compute the total interest and the total time to get the rate.

Wait, the total interest is $7.80 over 24 weeks, which is 0.4615 years.

So the rate per year would be 7.80 / (88.20 * 0.4615) = 7.80 / (40.72) ≈ 0.1916, 19.16%.

But again, no option matches this. So perhaps the way the interest is calculated here is different.

Wait, maybe the APR is calculated using the total payments including the down payment as part of the principal. Alternatively, perhaps the way the problem is structured, the interest is calculated on the total amount paid, not just the principal.

Wait, if I think about the total amount paid is $105.80, and the principal is $98, so the interest is $7.80. So the interest rate over the period is $7.80 / $98 = 0.07959, or 7.959% over 24 weeks.

Then, the annual rate would be (7.959% / (24/52)) = 7.959 * (52/24) ≈ 7.959 * 2.1667 ≈ 17.25%.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me review the initial data again.

The camera costs $98, 10% down, so $9.80 down. The balance is $88.20, paid over 24 weeks at $4 each. So total payments are 24 *4 = $96. So total interest is $96 - $88.20 = $7.80.

So, the interest is $7.80 over 24 weeks. To find the annual rate, I can compute the weekly rate and multiply by 52.

The weekly rate would be 7.80 / (88.20 *24) = 7.80 / 2116.8 ≈ 0.003685 or 0.3685% per week.

Annual rate: 0.3685% *52 ≈ 19.17%.

Again, same result. So perhaps the answer isn't among the options, or I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options: option E is 36.8%, which is close to 19.17% doubled. Hmm, but why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rate differently. Maybe using the total amount paid as the basis.

The total amount paid is $105.80, which includes the down payment and the installments. So the total interest is $7.80 over 24 weeks. So maybe the rate is calculated based on the average outstanding balance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the interest as $7.80 over the initial principal of $98, not $88.20.

Wait, let's try that: 7.80 /98 = 0.07959, which is 7.959% over 24 weeks. So annual rate would be 7.959% * (52/24) = 7.959 * 2.1667 ≈ 17.25%.

Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on the total amount, including the down payment.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated on the entire $98, but only the $88.20 is financed. So, the interest would be calculated on $98.

Wait, but no, because the down payment is made immediately, so the financed amount is $88.20.

Wait, I'm stuck here. Let's check the options again.

The options are:

A:50%, B:10%, C:29.9%, D:33.
