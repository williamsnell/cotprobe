Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about burning gasoline and figuring out how much air is needed. Hmm, I need to find out how many pounds of air are required to burn one pound of gasoline. The air is 23.19% oxygen by weight and 75.46% nitrogen. The reaction is C8H18 reacting with O2 to form CO2 and H2O.

Wait, right, stoichiometry problem. I remember that in these kinds of problems, I need to balance the chemical equation first. So the reactants are C8H18 and O2, and the products are CO2 and H2O. Let me write that out.

The unbalanced equation is: C8H18 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

I need to balance this. Let's tackle each element one by one. Carbon is already balanced because there's 8 C on the left, and each CO2 has one, so I'll need 8 CO2. So:

C8H18 + O2 → 8 CO2 + H2O.

Now for hydrogen. On the left, there are 18 H in C8H18. On the right, each H2O has 2 H, so to get 18 H, I need 9 H2O molecules. So now the equation is:

C8H18 + O2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O.

Next, let's balance oxygen. On the right, each CO2 has 2 O, so 8 CO2 is 16 O. Each H2O has 1 O, so 9 H2O is 9 O. So total O on the right is 16 + 9 = 25 O atoms.

Oxygen comes from O2, which is diatomic, so each molecule provides 2 O atoms. To get 25 O atoms, I need 25/2 O2 molecules. So the equation becomes:

C8H18 + (25/2) O2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O.

To make the coefficients whole numbers, I can multiply everything by 2. But wait, that's already been done because (25/2) is multiplied by 2 when I write the equation as:

2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O.

Wait, no, let me think again. The original equation after balancing C and H was C8H18 + O2 → 8 CO2 +9 H2O. So the O on the right is 8*2 +9*1 =16 +9=25. So O2 needed is 25/2 moles. So the balanced equation is:

C8H18 + (25/2) O2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O.

Now, I need to find the mole ratios. But wait, the problem gives the composition of air by weight, so I might need to work with mass percentages instead of moles. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to calculate the mass of O2 required and then find out how much air that corresponds to.

Let's proceed step by step.

First, find the molar masses.

Molar mass of C8H18: Carbon is 12.01 g/mol *8 =96.08, hydrogen is 1.008*18=18.144. So total is 96.08 +18.144 =114.224 g/mol.

Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol (since O is 16, times 2).

In the balanced equation, for each mole of C8H18, we need 25/2 moles of O2. So the moles of O2 required per mole of C8H18 is 12.5 moles.

Wait, but the problem states that we're burning a pound of gasoline. So I need to find how much O2 is needed for one pound of C8H18.

First, convert one pound of C8H18 into moles. Because 1 pound is 453.592 grams (since 1 lb = 453.592 grams approx).

Molar mass of C8H18 is 114.224 g/mol. So moles of C8H18 is mass divided by molar mass.

Moles = 453.592 g / 114.224 g/mol ≈ let's calculate that.

Wait, let me compute that:

114.224 *4 is about 456.9, which is more than 453.5, so maybe around 3.97 moles? Wait, perhaps more accurately:

453.592 / 114.224 = let's see, 114.224 * 3.97 = approx.

114 * 4 is 456, so 3.97 is about 3.97 *114.224 ≈ 453.5. So approximately 3.97 moles of C8H18.

Wait, but wait, more accurately:

114.224 * x =453.592 → x=453.592/114.224. Let me compute that.

453.592 ÷ 114.224 ≈ let's compute:

114.224 × 3.97 → 3 × 114.224 = 342.672, 0.97 ×114.224 ≈ 110.827. So 342.672 +110.827 =453.499 ≈453.5. So x ≈3.97 moles.

So each mole of C8H18 requires 12.5 moles of O2 (since 25/2 =12.5). So total moles of O2 needed =3.97 moles *12.5 = approximately 49.625 moles.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because the molar ratio is (25/2) O2 per 1 mole of C8H18. So per mole of C8H18, O2 is 12.5 moles. So for 3.97 moles C8H18, O2 needed is 3.97 *12.5 = ?

3.97 *12.5 = let's compute:

3 *12.5 =37.5, 0.97 *12.5=12.125. So 37.5 +12.125=49.625 moles of O2.

Now, the mass of O2 needed is moles * molar mass. Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol.

So mass O2 =49.625 moles *32 g/mol = let's calculate that.

49.625 ×32:

40 ×32=1280, 9.625 ×32=307.2 → total 1280 +307.2=1587.2 grams. Which is 1587.2 grams, or 3.501 pounds (since 1 lb=453.592 grams → 1587.2 /453.592 ≈3.501 lbs).

Wait, no, wait: 453.592 grams is 1 lb. So 1587.2 grams is 1587.2 /453.592 ≈3.501 lb.

Wait, but wait, the question is about pounds of air. So we need to find how much air contains 3.501 pounds of O2. Since air is 23.19% O2 by weight, the total air weight is O2 weight divided by 0.2319.

So air weight = 3.501 lb /0.2319 ≈ let's compute that.

3.501 /0.2319 ≈ let's see, 0.2319 ×15 =3.4785. So 15 lbs would give 0.2319 ×15=3.4785. We have 3.501, which is a bit more than 3.4785. The difference is 3.501 -3.4785=0.0225.

So 0.0225 /0.2319 ≈0.0969. So total air needed is approximately 15.0969 lbs. So about 15.1 lbs.

Looking at the options, option H is 15.10 lbs. So the answer should be H.

Wait, did I make any mistakes here?

Let me double-check the calculations. Let me go through each step again quickly.

1. Balanced the equation correctly. Yes, C8H18 + (25/2) O2 → 8 CO2 +9 H2O.

2. Calculated moles of C8H18 in 1 lb: 453.592 g /114.224 g/mol ≈3.97 moles.

3. Moles of O2 needed: 3.97 *12.5=49.625 moles.

4. Mass of O2: 49.625 *32=1587.2 grams= approx 3.501 lb.

5. Air is 23.19% O2, so air mass= 3.501 /0.2319≈15.10 lb.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is H.

To determine how many pounds of air are needed to burn one pound of gasoline (C₈H₁₈), we start by balancing the combustion reaction:

**C₈H₁₈ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O**

Balancing the equation:

1. Carbon (C) is balanced with 8 CO₂ molecules.
2. Hydrogen (H) is balanced with 9 H₂O molecules (since 18 H in C₈H₁₈ requires 9 H₂O).
3. Oxygen (O) is balanced by calculating the total O atoms on the right: 8 CO₂ contributes 16 O, and 9 H₂O contributes 9 O, for a total of 25 O atoms. Since O₂ is diatomic, 25/2 = 12.5 moles of O₂ are required.

The balanced equation is:

**C₈H₁₈ + 12.5 O₂ → 8 CO₂ + 9 H₂O**

Next, calculate the mass of O₂ required to burn 1 pound of gasoline:

1. The molar mass of C₈H₁₈ is calculated as:
   - Carbon: \( 8 \times 12.01 = 96.08 \, \text{g/mol} \)
   - Hydrogen: \( 18 \times 1.008 = 18.144 \, \text{g/mol} \)
   - Total: \( 96.08 + 18.144 = 114.224 \, \text{g/mol} \)

2. Convert 1 pound of C₈H₁₈ to moles:
   - \( 1 \, \text{lb} = 453.592 \, \text{g} \)
   - Moles of C₈H₁₈: \( \frac{453.592}{114.224} \approx 3.97 \, \text{mol} \)

3. Moles of O₂ required:
   - From the balanced equation, 1 mole of C₈H₁₈ requires 12.5 moles of O₂.
   - Total moles of O₂: \( 3.97 \times 12.5 = 49.625 \, \text{mol} \)

4. Mass of O₂ required:
   - Molar mass of O₂: \( 32 \, \text{g/mol} \)
   - Mass of O₂: \( 49.625 \times 32 = 1587.2 \, \text{g} = 3.501 \, \text{lb} \)

Finally, calculate the total mass of air required, given that air is 23.19% O₂ by weight:

- Mass of air: \( \frac{\text{Mass of O₂}}{\text{Mass percentage of O₂}} = \frac{3.501}{0.2319} \approx 15.10 \, \text{lb} \)

Thus, the total pounds of air required to burn 1 pound of gasoline is approximately **15.10 lbs**.

**Answer: H**
