Question:

Explain the term "psychosis" and the distinction between functionaland organic psychoses.

Options:

A: Psychosis is characterized by persistent happiness and clarity of thought
B: Psychosis is a minor mental disorder
C: Organic psychosis results from voluntary substance abuse, whereas functional psychosis is always congenital
D: Organic psychosis is typically induced by changes in the weather or climate
E: Organic psychosis is caused by psychological trauma
F: A psychosis is a severe mental disorder causing impaired thinking and emotion. Organic psychosis is caused by impaired brain functioning due to structural lesions or disease, while functional psychosis does not have any apparent pathological changes in the brain.
G: Functional psychosis is a form of psychosis that only occurs in older adults
H: Functional psychosis is caused by physical brain damage
I: Psychosis is a mild condition that improves without treatment
J: Functional psychosis is caused by infectious diseases, while organic psychosis is a result of genetic factors

Okay, so I've got this question about psychosis and the difference between functional and organic psychoses. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what psychosis is. From what I remember, psychosis is a serious mental disorder where a person loses contact with reality. Symptoms might include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms like lack of emotion. So it's definitely not something minor or about being happy. That helps me eliminate some options.

Looking at the options, option A says psychosis is about persistent happiness and clarity of thought. That sounds wrong because psychosis involves losing touch with reality, not being happy or clear-thinking. So A is out.

Option B says it's a minor mental disorder. No, psychosis is severe, so B is incorrect.

Option C talks about organic psychosis being from voluntary substance abuse and functional being congenital. I'm not sure. I think organic usually refers to a physical cause, like a brain injury or disease, while functional might be more about psychological causes. Wait, but substance abuse can cause organic issues, like if someone takes drugs that affect the brain. But I'm not sure if functional is always congenital. Maybe not, so C might not be right.

Option D says organic is caused by weather changes. That doesn't make sense. Weather affecting psychosis? I don't think so. D is probably wrong.

Option E claims organic psychosis is from psychological trauma. Wait, no. Organic is physical, so trauma might relate to functional. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Psychosis is a severe disorder with impaired thinking and emotion. Organic is due to brain issues like lesions or disease, and functional doesn't have clear brain changes. That sounds right. I remember that functional disorders don't have a clear physical cause, like schizophrenia is considered a functional psychosis because it's not due to a visible brain lesion, whereas something like a tumor would be organic.

Option G says functional only occurs in older adults. That's not true. Schizophrenia, a functional psychosis, usually starts in late teens to early thirties. So G is wrong.

Option H: Functional is caused by physical brain damage. No, that's organic. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Psychosis is mild and improves without treatment. No, psychosis is severe and usually needs treatment. So I is wrong.

Option J: Functional from infections, organic from genes. Wait, infections would be organic because they affect the brain physically. Genetics could be a factor in functional, like schizophrenia has genetic components. So J is mixing things up. Functional isn't caused by infections, and organic isn't solely genetic.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should explain psychosis as a severe disorder and correctly distinguish organic (physical cause) from functional (no clear physical cause). So option F matches that.

The correct answer is **F**. 

**Explanation:**
Psychosis is a severe mental disorder characterized by impaired thinking, emotion, and a disconnection from reality. It often involves symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. The distinction lies in their causes: organic psychosis results from physical brain issues such as lesions or diseases, while functional psychosis lacks clear pathological changes and may stem from psychological factors.

Answer: F
