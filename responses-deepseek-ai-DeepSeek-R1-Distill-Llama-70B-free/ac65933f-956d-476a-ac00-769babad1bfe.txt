Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again. The question is about partitioning a set of 6 distinct letters into 2 non-empty groups, and each group must have at least 2 letters. I'm supposed to find the number of ways this can be done, and the options are given from A to J.

Hmm, alright. So the first thing I'm thinking is that this is a combinatorics problem, specifically about partitioning sets. The letters are distinct, so the order matters. Wait, no, in set partitions, the order doesn't matter. So maybe I should think in terms of combinations.

Let me think. If I have 6 letters and I want to split them into two groups, each with at least 2 letters. So the possible group sizes could be 2 and 4, or 3 and 3. Because 1 and 5 is not allowed since each group must have at least 2 letters. So only these two cases.

So, for the case where one group has 2 letters and the other has 4, how many ways can that happen? Well, I think I can calculate the combinations for each case and then add them together.

So for the 2 and 4 split: the number of ways to choose 2 letters out of 6 is C(6,2). C(6,2) is 15. But wait, since the groups are indistinct (meaning that swapping the groups doesn't create a new partition), do I need to divide by something here? Oh wait, no, because in this case, the two groups are of different sizes. So choosing 2 letters for group A and the remaining 4 for group B is different from choosing 4 for group A and 2 for group B. Wait, actually, no. Because the groups are considered the same when the sizes are different? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, in set partitions, the order of the groups doesn't matter. So when the group sizes are different, each selection is unique because switching them doesn't produce the same partition. But when the group sizes are the same (like 3 and 3), then each selection would be counted twice if we don't adjust. So I think for the 2-4 split, the number is C(6,2), which is 15, but wait, no, because choosing 2 letters for the first group is the same as choosing the 4 letters for the second group. So I think in this case, the number of unique partitions would be C(6,2)/2? No, wait. No, because in the case of 2 and 4, since the group sizes are different, each partition is unique. Because the group with 2 is distinct from the group with 4. So the number here is 15. But wait, wait. Let's clarify.

When the group sizes are different, each partition is unique and doesn't need to be divided by anything. So for 2 and 4, the number of ways is C(6,2) = 15. But wait, let me think again. Suppose you have letters A, B, C, D, E, F. If I choose A and B as one group, the other group is C, D, E, F. Alternatively, if I choose C, D, E, F as the first group, the other group is A, B. But in set partitions, these two are considered the same partition. So whether I choose the smaller group or the larger group, it's the same partition. So in that case, I would have overcounted by a factor of 2. So to get the correct number, I should divide by 2. So 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, which doesn't make sense because you can't have half a way. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the approach. Let me think differently. The total number of ways to split the set into two non-empty groups is 2^6 - 2 (all subsets minus the empty set and the full set), divided by 2 (since each partition is counted twice). But wait, 2^6 is 64. So 64-2=62. 62/2=31. But that's the total number of ways to split into two non-empty groups without any size constraints. But our problem requires each group to have at least 2 letters.

So another approach: subtract the cases where one group has less than 2 letters. That is, subtract the cases where one group has 1 letter and the other has 5 letters. Because those are the only cases where a group doesn't meet the minimum size.

How many such cases are there? The number of ways to have a group of 1 and a group of 5 is C(6,1) = 6. But since each such partition is counted twice (once when you choose the singleton as the first group, once when you choose the 5 as the first group), so the number of unique partitions with a group of size 1 is 6/2 = 3. Wait, no, because when you choose a singleton, the other group is fixed as the remaining 5 letters. So each singleton choice corresponds to a unique partition. So the number of such partitions is 6. But in the total of 31, each of these is subtracted. So the number of valid partitions is 31 - 6 = 25.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, let's calculate it as the sum of the valid groupings.

So the valid group sizes are (2,4) and (3,3).

For (2,4): the number of ways is C(6,2) = 15. But since the groups are considered the same if the sizes are different? Wait, no, because the groups are of different sizes. So each selection is unique. So 15 is the correct count for (2,4). But wait, noâ€”because when the group sizes are different, choosing the 2-letter group versus the 4-letter group leads to the same partition. So I have to divide by 1 in this case. Wait, no, the group sizes are different, so each partition is uniquely determined by the smaller group. So 15 is correct for (2,4). But wait, I think I'm getting confused again.

Let me think differently. Each partition into groups of 2 and 4 is determined by which 2 letters are in the first group. So the number of such partitions is C(6,2) =15. But because the two groups are of different sizes, each partition is counted once. So no division is needed, so 15 is correct.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the total number of partitions without size restrictions, I got 31. By subtracting the 6 singletons, I got 25. So 25 would be the answer. But let me try another approach to confirm.

Alternatively, the number of ways to split into two groups of size 2 and 4 is C(6,2) =15. But since each such split is considered as one partition, we don't divide by anything. Then the number of ways to split into two groups of size 3 and 3 is C(6,3)/2. Because choosing the first group of 3, the second is determined, but each partition is counted twice (once for each group as the 'first'). So the number is (20)/2=10.

So total valid partitions are 15 (for 2 and4) +10 (for 3 and3) =25. So the answer would be 25, which is option D.

Wait, let me check that again. C(6,3) is 20. Dividing by 2 gives 10. So yes, 15+10=25. So that matches the earlier method where the total was 31 minus 6 gives 25.

So the correct answer should be 25, which is option D.

To determine the number of ways to partition a set of 6 distinct letters into 2 non-empty groups, where each group must contain at least 2 letters, we consider the following:

1. **Possible group size combinations**:  
   - The valid group size combinations are (2,4) and (3,3).  
   - Group sizes like (1,5) are invalid because each group must have at least 2 letters.

2. **Case 1: Group sizes (2,4)**  
   - The number of ways to choose 2 letters out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).  
   - Since the two groups are of different sizes, each partition is unique and does not require division by 2.  
   - Thus, there are 15 valid partitions for this case.

3. **Case 2: Group sizes (3,3)**  
   - The number of ways to choose 3 letters out of 6 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).  
   - However, each partition is counted twice (once for each group as the "first" group), so we divide by 2.  
   - This gives \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) valid partitions for this case.

4. **Total number of valid partitions**:  
   - Adding the results from both cases, we get \( 15 + 10 = 25 \).

Thus, the total number of ways to partition the set of 6 distinct letters into 2 non-empty groups, with each group containing at least 2 letters, is **25**.
