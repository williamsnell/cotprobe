Okay, so I've got this question about the astronomical unit, AU. Hmm, I remember that an AU is a unit used to measure distances within our solar system, right? Like the distance from the Earth to the Sun. But wait, how many kilometers is that exactly?

I think it's around 150 million kilometers. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. Let me try to recall. I've heard the figure 150 million km before, maybe in science class or a documentary. Oh right, I remember now! One AU is approximately 149.6 million kilometers. So that's roughly 150 million km when rounded.

Looking at the options, option A is 150 million km. That seems to match what I remember. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing it with something else. Sometimes I mix up AU with light-years or other units. No, wait, light-years are much bigger. An AU is much smaller than a light-year. 

Another thing I recall is that the average distance from the Earth to the Sun is 1 AU, which is about 150 million km. So yeah, option A must be the correct answer. I don't think any of the other options are close. Let me check the options again. Option A is 150, and the others are 140, 180, etc. So 150 is definitely the right choice here.

The correct answer is A: 150 million km, as one astronomical unit (AU) is approximately 149.6 million kilometers, which rounds to 150 million km.
