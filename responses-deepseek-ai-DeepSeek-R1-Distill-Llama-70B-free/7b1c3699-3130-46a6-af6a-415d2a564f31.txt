Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about aggregate demand. The question is asking which option would shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. Hmm, I remember that aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for goods and services in an economy. When the AD curve shifts left, it means that at every price level, the quantity demanded is lower. 

So, I need to think about the factors that affect aggregate demand. From what I recall, the main factors are consumer spending, investment, government spending, and net exports. Also, things like consumer confidence, interest rates, and technological changes can influence these components.

Looking at the options:

Option A: An increase in consumer confidence. Wait, if people are more confident, they're more likely to spend. That would increase AD, shifting it to the right. So A is not the answer.

Option B: Increase in prices of goods and services. Wait, isn't the AD curve itself showing the relationship between price levels and quantity demanded? So if prices increase, that's a movement along the curve, not a shift. So B is about prices, but it doesn't shift the curve itself.

Option C: Businesses expect lower sales. Oh, business expectations matter for investment. If firms think sales will be lower, they might reduce investment in new projects and production. Lower investment would decrease AD, shifting the curve left. That sounds like a possible correct answer.

Option D: Technological advancement. I think that makes production more efficient, which can lower costs. This could lead to lower prices or increased supply, but how does it affect AD? Wait, technological progress might increase productivity, which could lead to more investment or lower prices. But for AD, lower prices could mean higher quantity demanded at each price level, which would shift AD right. Alternatively, maybe it's a supply factor, so perhaps it affects aggregate supply instead. So D might not be the right choice.

Option E: Increase in consumer wealth. More wealth makes consumers spend more, right? So that would increase AD, shifting it right. So E is not the answer.

Option F: Increase in money supply. More money in circulation can lead to more spending, so AD increases, shifting right. So F is not it.

Option G: Government increases spending. That would directly increase AD, shifting it right. So G is out.

Option H: Government increases investments. Similar to G, more investment by the government would boost AD, shifting right. So H isn't correct.

Option I: Foreigners prefer our products. That would increase exports, which is part of net exports. Higher exports mean higher AD, shifting right. So I is not the answer.

Option J: Government decreases taxes. Lower taxes mean consumers have more disposable income, so they spend more. That increases AD, shifting it right. So J is out.

So going back, the correct answer should be option C. When businesses expect lower sales, they invest less, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand, thus shifting the curve to the left.

The correct answer is C. When business firms expect lower sales, they reduce investment, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand and shifting the curve to the left.

Answer: C
