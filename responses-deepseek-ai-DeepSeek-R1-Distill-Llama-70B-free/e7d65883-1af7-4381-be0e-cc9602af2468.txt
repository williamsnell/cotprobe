Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the percentage ionization of different acids when one mole of each is dissolved in water. I remember that percentage ionization has to do with how much an acid dissociates in solution. The higher the percentage ionization, the stronger the acid, right?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought that strong acids completely dissociate, so their percentage ionization is 100%. But the question is asking which acid has the highest percentage ionization under those conditions. Hmm, but wait, if all the strong acids are 100% ionized, then why would the percentage vary among them?

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Strong acids do fully ionize, but maybe some of the options are weak acids. So for weak acids, the degree of ionization depends on their Ka values— the higher the Ka, the more they ionize, so higher percentage ionization.

Looking at the options: 

A: H2S. I think that's hydrogen sulfide. It's a weak acid, right? I remember H2S is diprotic but both are weak. So it doesn't ionize much.

B: HNO2. That's nitrous acid. I think it's a weak acid too. Its Ka is around 4.5 x 10^-4, if I recall correctly.

C: HClO4. Oh, that's perchloric acid. I remember HClO4 is a strong acid. So it dissociates completely in water. So its percentage ionization is 100%.

D: H3PO4. Phosphoric acid. It's a triprotic acid, but I think all its dissociations are weak. So the first ionization is weak, so it doesn't ionize much in water.

E: H2CO3. Carbonic acid. That's a weak acid too. It's diprotic, and both steps are weak. So it doesn't ionize much.

Wait, the question is which acid has the highest percentage ionization. So the strong acid should have 100% ionization, which is higher than any weak acid. So in the options, which are the strong acids?

Looking back: HClO4 is a strong acid. So when you dissolve it, it fully ionizes. So that would have the highest percentage ionization. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I should make sure the other options are weak. Let's see: HNO2 is weak, H3PO4 is weak, H2S is weak, H2CO3 is weak. So among all, only HClO4 is strong. So when it dissolves, it's completely ionized.

So the percentage ionization for HClO4 would be 100%, which is higher than the others, which have lower percentages because they don't fully ionize.

So the answer should be C.

To determine which acid has the highest percentage ionization when one mole of each compound is dissolved in water, we analyze the nature of the acids provided:

- **H₂S (Option A):** Hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid and only partially ionizes in water. Its ionization is limited, so its percentage ionization is low.  
- **HNO₂ (Option B):** Nitrous acid is also a weak acid with a Ka value of approximately \(4.5 \times 10^{-4}\). It partially ionizes, but not completely.  
- **HClO₄ (Option C):** Perchloric acid is a strong acid, meaning it fully dissociates in water. Its percentage ionization is 100%, which is the highest possible.  
- **H₃PO₄ (Option D):** Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, but all its dissociations are weak. It has a very low percentage ionization.  
- **H₂CO₃ (Option E):** Carbonic acid is a diprotic weak acid. Both its dissociation steps are weak, resulting in low percentage ionization.  

Among the given options, only **HClO₄** is a strong acid, and it fully ionizes in water, giving it the highest percentage ionization (100%). All the other acids are weak and exhibit partial ionization. Therefore, the acid with the highest percentage ionization is **HClO₄**.

Answer: C
