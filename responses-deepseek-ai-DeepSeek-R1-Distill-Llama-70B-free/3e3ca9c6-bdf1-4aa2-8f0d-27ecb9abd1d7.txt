Okay, so I've got this question about sea urchin oocytes and what happens when there's a rise in intracellular free calcium. Hmm, I remember that in fertilization, calcium plays a big role. Let me think...

So, the question says that the rise in calcium causes the release of proteolytic enzymes, which prevent polyspermy. Wait, polyspermy is when more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, which isn't good. So the egg must have mechanisms to prevent that.

I think there are a couple of reactions here. One is the acrosomal reaction, which is the sperm's response—when the sperm releases enzymes to get through the egg's outer layers. But that's on the sperm side, not the egg.

Oh right, the egg has the cortical reaction. The cortical granules in the egg release their contents after fertilization. These include proteolytic enzymes. These enzymes modify the zona pellucida or the vitelline layer, making it impenetrable to other sperm, thus preventing polyspermy.

Wait, but what's the name of this process? I think the cortical reaction is the release of these enzymes from the cortical granules. So the events described are the cortical reaction.

Looking at the options: Option H is the cortical reaction. So the answer should be H.

Wait, the other options. Option A is polyspermy reaction—no, that's the process being prevented, not the event. Option C is proteolytic reaction, which is part of it but maybe not the specific term used. Option I is zona reaction, which happens in mammals, I think, modifying the zona pellucida. But in sea urchins, it's the cortical reaction they're referring to.

So yeah, the correct answer is H.

The rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte triggers the release of proteolytic enzymes from cortical granules, which act to prevent polyspermy. This specific process is known as the cortical reaction. Among the given options, the correct term for this event is:

**Cortical reaction**

Answer: H
