Question:

Hall Co. purchased a machine on January 1 at a cost of $140000. The machine had an estimated useful life of eight years and a salvage value of $60000. Hall chose to depreciate the machine using the double- declining balance method. What was the carrying amount of the machine in Hall's balance sheet at the end of its second year of operations?

Options:

A: $60,000
B: $70,000
C: $61,250
D: $100,000
E: $85,000
F: $78,750
G: 80000
H: $90,000
I: $95,000
J: $110,000

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to depreciation methods. Let's see what I can do. The question is about the double-declining balance method, which I think is a type of accelerated depreciation. 

Alright, the problem says that Hall Co. bought a machine on January 1st for $140,000. The machine has an estimated useful life of eight years and a salvage value of $60,000. They're using the double-declining balance method. I need to find the carrying amount after the second year.

Hmm, I remember that straight-line depreciation is pretty straightforward—just cost minus salvage, divided by the useful life. But double-declining is different. I think it's where you take twice the straight-line rate and apply it each year, but only on the book value, not the salvage.

Wait, so first, maybe I should find the straight-line depreciation rate. Since the useful life is eight years, the rate would be 1/8, which is 0.125, or 12.5%. But double-declining would make it 2 * 12.5% = 25% per year.

But wait, I've heard that in some cases, like when using double-declining, you don't subtract the salvage value first. Or do you? I'm a bit confused. Oh right, I think with double-declining, you don't consider the salvage value until the end. So each year, you calculate depreciation based on the current book value.

So for the first year, the depreciation would be 25% of $140,000. Let me calculate that: 0.25 * 140,000 = $35,000. So the book value after the first year would be 140,000 - 35,000 = $105,000.

Wait, but in the second year, the depreciation would again be 25% of the new book value. So 0.25 * 105,000 = $26,250. So after the second year, the book value would be 105,000 - 26,250 = $78,750.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember something about switching to straight-line in the latter years sometimes. Because with double-declining, the depreciation can't go below the salvage value. Or maybe that's when using other methods.

Alternatively, I think when using double-declining balance, you don't adjust for salvage until the end. So the formula is just book value times the rate each year. So for the first two years, that's correct.

So after two years, the carrying amount would be $78,750. Let me check the options. Option F is $78,750. But wait, another thought—am I supposed to adjust the depreciation in the last year to ensure that the salvage value is achieved?

Wait, the machine is expected to have a salvage value of $60,000 after eight years. So the total depreciation over eight years should be $140,000 - $60,000 = $80,000.

Wait, no. Wait, that's for straight-line. Because in straight-line, each year's depreciation is (140,000-60,000)/8 = 10,000 per year. But in double-declining, the total depreciation is more front-loaded.

But I think that when using double-declining, you don't subtract the salvage value when calculating each year's depreciation. Instead, you just keep applying the rate until the book value reaches the salvage value. But wait, in practice, the double-declining method typically doesn't deduct salvage value each year. Instead, the depreciation is based on the book value each year, without considering the salvage, until the last year when an adjustment is made to ensure the salvage value isn't exceeded.

So maybe I should compute each year's depreciation without subtracting salvage and see if the book value after two years is as I calculated before, $78,750, which would be option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if after each year, the book value doesn't go below the salvage. But after two years, it's way above $60,000, so that's not an issue here.

So I think my initial calculation is correct. The carrying amount after two years is $78,750, which is option F.

To determine the carrying amount of the machine after the second year using the double-declining balance method, the following steps are applied:

1. **Determine the depreciation rate**:  
   The machine has an estimated useful life of 8 years. The straight-line depreciation rate is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Straight-line rate} = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \text{ or } 12.5\%
   \]  
   For the double-declining balance method, the rate is doubled:  
   \[
   \text{Double-declining rate} = 2 \times 0.125 = 0.25 \text{ or } 25\%
   \]

2. **Calculate depreciation for the first year**:  
   Depreciation is based on the initial cost of the machine:  
   \[
   \text{First-year depreciation} = 0.25 \times 140,000 = 35,000
   \]  
   The book value after the first year is:  
   \[
   140,000 - 35,000 = 105,000
   \]

3. **Calculate depreciation for the second year**:  
   Depreciation is based on the book value at the end of the first year:  
   \[
   \text{Second-year depreciation} = 0.25 \times 105,000 = 26,250
   \]  
   The book value after the second year is:  
   \[
   105,000 - 26,250 = 78,750
   \]

4. **Verify the carrying amount**:  
   The carrying amount after the second year is $78,750. This is consistent with the double-declining balance method, as the salvage value is not considered until the end of the useful life.

Thus, the carrying amount of the machine on Hall Co.'s balance sheet at the end of the second year is **$78,750**, which corresponds to **Option F**.

**Answer: F**
