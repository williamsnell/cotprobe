Question:

A builder sold a new house to a buyer for use as the buyer's residence. The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?

Options:

A: No, because the builder cannot accept the deed while also holding the mortgage.
B: No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.
C: Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.
D: No, because the builder coerced the buyer into deeding the house back.
E: Yes, because the buyer defaulted on the mortgage payments.
F: Yes, because the builder originally held the mortgage.
G: Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.
H: No, because the buyer still technically owns the house until foreclosure.
I: No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about real property law, specifically dealing with mortgages and deeds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a builder who sold a house to a buyer. The buyer paid 10% and financed the rest with a promissory note and a purchase money mortgage. Then, a year later, the buyer missed payments, and property values dropped. The builder suggested the buyer deed the house back to avoid foreclosure, and the buyer agreed. The question is whether the builder now owns the house in fee simple.

Hmm. Fee simple is the highest form of ownership, right? So the builder would have full title if that's the case. But I remember there are some legal concepts that might affect this.

I think this situation might involve a "deed in lieu of foreclosure." That's when the borrower deeds the property back to the lender to avoid foreclosure. But are there any legal issues with that?

Let me consider the options. Option I says it's a disguised mortgage. Wait, sometimes when a homeowner transfers property to the lender, courts look to see if it's a mortgage in disguise. If so, the borrower might still have rights, like the right of redemption. But in this case, the original transaction was a purchase money mortgage, so maybe that affects it.

Option A says the builder can't accept the deed while holding the mortgage. I don't think that's right. When a deed in lieu is done, the lender (here, the builder) would typically forgive the debt, so they wouldn't need the mortgage anymore because they own the property outright.

Option B claims the owner can't waive foreclosure rights. I'm not sure about that. I think in some states, the borrower can waive the right to foreclosure through a deed in lieu. But I'm not certain if that's a federal rule or varies by state.

Option C says yes because the transaction was reasonable. That might depend on whether there's any evidence of coercion or unfairness. If the transaction was fair, maybe it's valid. But if the builder took advantage of the buyer, it could be a problem.

Option D says the builder coerced the buyer. The question doesn't mention coercion, so unless it's implied, this might not be the case. The builder just suggested it, but the buyer agreed. Unless there's some inherent coercion because the builder is the lender, but I'm not sure.

Option E says yes because the buyer defaulted. But default alone doesn't transfer ownership. The builder would have to foreclose or get a deed in lieu.

Option F says yes because the builder held the mortgage. But holding a mortgage gives a lien, not ownership. So that's not enough.

Option G says yes due to equitable redemption. Wait, equitable redemption is the right of the borrower to redeem the property even after default, usually by paying off the debt. So if the builder just takes the deed, does that affect this right? Or does the deed in lieu mean the borrower is giving up that right?

Option H says no because the buyer still owns until foreclosure. But if the buyer deeds it back, they're transferring ownership. Unless the deed is invalid for some reason, like being a disguised mortgage, then the transfer wouldn't be valid.

Option I says it's a disguised mortgage. So the court might treat the deed as a mortgage instead of a transfer. How do courts determine that? They look at factors like whether the borrower remains in possession, whether the lender's interest is a lien, etc. In a typical deed in lieu, the borrower gives up possession, and the lender becomes the owner. But if the lender allows the borrower to stay, maybe it looks more like a mortgage.

Wait, in this case, the buyer deeded the house back. So the builder now has the title. But if the court thinks it's a mortgage, then the builder only has a lien, and the buyer still owns the property. So the builder wouldn't have fee simple title.

But I'm not sure if all deeds in lieu are treated as mortgages. I think it depends on the circumstances. If the transaction is deemed to be a mortgage in disguise, then the borrower retains equitable title, and the lender's interest is a mortgage. But if it's a legitimate transfer, then the builder gets the fee simple.

So which is it here? The question says the buyer paid 10% and financed the rest with a purchase money mortgage. Then, when the buyer couldn't pay, the builder suggested deeding back. Property values had declined. So the builder might be avoiding having to foreclose on a property that's now worth less.

If the deed in lieu is treated as a mortgage, then option I would be correct. But if it's a legitimate transfer, then the builder owns it.

I remember that purchase money mortgages are treated differently. They are considered more secure because the lender is the seller. So maybe in this context, a deed in lieu would be valid.

Wait, but some courts might still treat it as a mortgage if the original loan was a purchase money mortgage. Or perhaps the doctrine of equitable redemption comes into play, where the borrower has the right to redeem even after default.

Alternatively, if the transaction is deemed to be a mortgage, the borrower could still have the right to redeem, meaning the builder doesn't get full ownership yet.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap.

If the builder accepts a deed in lieu of foreclosure, generally, this would transfer title to the builder. However, if the court finds that the transaction is a mortgage in disguise, then the builder only has a mortgage interest, and the buyer still owns the property.

So the key is whether the deed is considered a true transfer or a mortgage.

In some cases, when the original loan was a purchase money mortgage, courts might be more inclined to treat a deed in lieu as a mortgage because the lender is also the seller. This is to prevent the seller/lender from getting an unfair advantage, especially if the property value has dropped.

So in this scenario, since the builder is the original seller and the lender, the deed in lieu might be seen as a disguised mortgage. Therefore, the builder doesn't get fee simple title because the buyer still holds the equity of redemption.

Looking at the options again, option I says "No, because the deed back constitutes a disguised mortgage." That would mean the builder doesn't own it outright.

Alternatively, option C says yes if the transaction was reasonable. But if the property values declined, maybe the builder is getting a better deal than foreclosure. But the question doesn't indicate any unfairness, just that values declined.

So without evidence of coercion or unfairness, maybe the deed in lieu is valid, making option C correct.

Wait, but I'm torn between C and I.

I think the key here is the concept of a "purchase money mortgage." In such cases, a deed in lieu might be treated as a mortgage because the lender is the seller, and the law wants to protect the borrower from the seller/lender taking back the property without foreclosure.

So if the lender is also the seller (purchase money mortgage), then a deed in lieu is treated as a mortgage, meaning the borrower still has the right to redeem, and the lender doesn't own the property outright.

Therefore, the builder doesn't have fee simple title. So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the deed in lieu is treated as a mortgage, then the builder only has a mortgage interest, not ownership. So the buyer still owns the property, but the builder has a mortgage lien.

So the builder doesn't have fee simple title, making the answer I correct.

The question revolves around whether a builder, who is also the lender in a purchase money mortgage, can obtain fee simple title to a house through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The builder sold the house to the buyer, who financed 90% of the purchase price with a promissory note and purchase money mortgage. When the buyer defaulted, the builder suggested deeding the house back to avoid foreclosure, and the buyer agreed. The issue is whether the builder now owns the property outright in fee simple.

Key considerations include:

1. **Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure**: This is a transaction where the borrower deeds the property back to the lender to avoid foreclosure. Generally, this transfers title to the lender, but courts may scrutinize the transaction to ensure it is not a mortgage in disguise.

2. **Purchase Money Mortgage**: Since the builder is both the seller and the lender, courts may be more inclined to treat the deed in lieu as a mortgage in disguise. This is because the law seeks to prevent the seller/lender from gaining an unfair advantage, especially if the property value has declined.

3. **Disguised Mortgage Doctrine**: Courts examine whether the transaction functions as a mortgage rather than a true transfer of ownership. Factors include whether the borrower retains possession, the lender's interest resembles a lien, or the transaction was unfair or coercive.

4. **Equitable Redemption**: The borrower generally retains the right to redeem the property even after default, unless the deed in lieu is deemed a valid transfer of ownership.

In this case, the builder, as the seller and lender, suggested the deed in lieu after the buyer defaulted. Given the decline in property values and the builder's dual role, the transaction could be treated as a disguised mortgage. This would mean the builder holds a mortgage interest rather than fee simple title, and the buyer retains the right to redeem the property.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The builder can accept the deed while holding the mortgage; the issue is whether the deed is treated as a mortgage in disguise.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The right to foreclosure can be waived through a deed in lieu.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While the transaction might appear reasonable, the builder's dual role as seller and lender raises concerns about unfairness.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no evidence of coercion in the question.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Default alone does not transfer ownership; the validity of the deed in lieu determines ownership.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Holding a mortgage gives a lien, not fee simple title.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Equitable redemption applies, but the key issue is whether the deed in lieu is valid.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. If the deed in lieu is valid, the buyer no longer owns the property.
- **Option I**: Correct. The deed back to the builder may constitute a disguised mortgage, meaning the builder holds a mortgage interest rather than fee simple title.

Given the builder's dual role and the potential for the transaction to be treated as a disguised mortgage, the builder does not obtain fee simple title.
