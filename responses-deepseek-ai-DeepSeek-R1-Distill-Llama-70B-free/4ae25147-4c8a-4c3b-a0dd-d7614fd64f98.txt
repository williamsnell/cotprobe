Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me about electric flux. Hmm, I remember from my classes that electric flux has something to do with electric fields passing through a surface. But wait, the question is about when the net electric flux is proportional to the enclosed charge. I think this relates to Gauss's Law.

Gauss's Law, right. So Gauss's Law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by permittivity of free space. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀. Oh wait, but the question is about when the flux is proportional to the enclosed charge. So under what conditions does this proportionality hold?

Wait, Gauss's Law itself says that the flux equals the enclosed charge over ε₀. So that would mean that the flux is always proportional to the enclosed charge, regardless of other factors like the distribution of charges outside the surface or the shape of the surface. Because as long as you're considering the enclosed charge, the flux depends directly on that.

So looking at the options, option I says "under any conditions." That would make sense because Gauss's Law applies universally, regardless of whether the charges are moving, or the field is uniform, or the surface is a certain shape. The key is that it's the enclosed charge that matters, not the outside.

Wait, but let me think again. Does the presence of charges outside the surface affect the flux? No, because according to Gauss's Law, the flux depends only on the charge enclosed. Charges outside create fields, but those fields don't contribute to the net flux through the surface because the field lines entering and exiting would cancel out. So the net flux is solely due to the enclosed charge.

So yeah, the net electric flux is proportional to the enclosed charge under any conditions. So the correct answer should be I.

The question asks under what conditions the net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge. This relates to Gauss's Law, which states:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
\]

Here, the electric flux \(\Phi\) is proportional to the enclosed charge \(Q_{\text{enc}}\), with the constant of proportionality being \(\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\). Importantly, Gauss's Law applies universally, regardless of the distribution of charges, the motion of charges, or the shape of the surface. The net flux depends only on the enclosed charge, and any charges outside the surface do not contribute to the net flux because their field lines entering and exiting the surface cancel out.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The presence of charges outside the surface does not affect the net flux.
- **B**: Incorrect. The motion of charges does not influence the proportionality.
- **C**: Incorrect. The electric field does not need to be uniform for the proportionality to hold.
- **D**: Incorrect. The proportionality applies regardless of whether the enclosed charge is positive or negative.
- **E**: Incorrect. The proportionality holds whether the charge is at rest or in motion.
- **F**: Incorrect. The symmetry of the charge distribution does not affect the proportionality.
- **G**: Incorrect. The surface does not need to be a perfect sphere.
- **H**: Incorrect. The proportionality applies to both positive and negative enclosed charges.
- **I**: Correct. The proportionality holds under any conditions, as stated by Gauss's Law.
- **J**: Incorrect. The symmetry of nearby charges does not influence the proportionality.

Thus, the correct answer is that the net electric flux is proportional to the enclosed charge under any conditions.
