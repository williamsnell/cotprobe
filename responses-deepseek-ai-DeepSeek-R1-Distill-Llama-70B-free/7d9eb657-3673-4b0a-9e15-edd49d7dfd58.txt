Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a household's consumption is $5000, savings are $3000, and $2000 is paid out in taxes. Then, we need to find two things: the personal income (part a) and the disposable income (part b). There are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in economics, income and disposable income have specific definitions. Let me think about them. Personal income, I think, refers to the total income received by individuals, including things like wages, salaries, and other sources before taxes and other deductions. Disposable income, on the other hand, is the income left after paying taxes and other deductions; it's the money people have available to spend or save.

Wait, but I might be mixing things up. Let me clarify. I think disposable income is calculated as personal income minus taxes. So if someone earns a certain amount (their personal income), and then they pay taxes, what's left is their disposable income.

So the problem gives me consumption, savings, and taxes. Let me jot down the given values:

Consumption (C) = $5000
Savings (S) = $3000
Taxes (T) = $2000

I need to find Personal Income (PI) and Disposable Income (DI).

I recall that disposable income is equal to personal income minus taxes. So DI = PI - T. That makes sense because taxes are deducted from personal income to get what's left for spending or saving.

But how does consumption and savings come into play here? Oh right, disposable income is split between consumption and savings. So DI = C + S.

Wait, that makes sense because once you have your disposable income, you either spend it (consumption) or save it. So the total disposable income should equal the sum of consumption and savings.

So from the problem, DI = C + S = 5000 + 3000 = $8000.

That gives me DI as $8000. Now, since DI = PI - T, I can rearrange that to find PI. So PI = DI + T = 8000 + 2000 = $10,000.

Wait, but let me double-check. PI is the total income before taxes, right? So if the household earns $10,000 and pays $2000 in taxes, their disposable income is $8000. Then they spend $5000 and save $3000, which adds up to $8000. That seems consistent.

So PI is $10,000 and DI is $8000.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. Option B says Personal income: $10,000, Disposable income: $8000. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the personal income (PI) and disposable income (DI) for the household, we start with the given values:

- **Consumption (C)** = $5000  
- **Savings (S)** = $3000  
- **Taxes (T)** = $2000  

### Step 1: Calculate Disposable Income (DI)  
Disposable income is the portion of income available for spending or saving after taxes are deducted. However, it can also be calculated as the sum of consumption and savings, since these are the two uses of disposable income:  
\[
DI = C + S = 5000 + 3000 = \$8000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Personal Income (PI)  
Personal income is the total income before taxes are deducted. Since disposable income is calculated as personal income minus taxes, we can rearrange the formula to find PI:  
\[
PI = DI + T = 8000 + 2000 = \$10,000
\]

### Final Answer  
- **Personal Income (PI)** = $10,000  
- **Disposable Income (DI)** = $8,000  

The correct option that matches these values is **B**.

B
