Question:

The owner of a large family estate decided to sell the property. The owner entered into a valid written brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. According to terms of the agreement, the broker promised to undertake best efforts to sell the estate for a purchase price of not less than $1,250,000. The contract also provided that the broker was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The brokerage agreement was effective for a period of two months. One month later, the broker notified the owner that she had found a buyer who wanted to purchase the property for $1,500,000. That same day, the broker handed the owner a real estate sales contract, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer agreed to pay $1,500,000 for the purchase of the estate. The owner investigated the buyer and discovered he had sufficient funds to purchase the estate. However, the owner changed his mind and decided not to sell the property. He told the broker that he would not sign the agreement. In addition, the owner told the broker that he was canceling their brokerage agreement because he was withdrawing the estate from the market. The owner also refused to pay the broker any commission. If the broker now sues the owner for breach of contract, which of the following, if anything, is the broker's proper measure of recovery?

Options:

A: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, plus punitive damages for breach of contract.
B: Nothing, because the owner has the right to withdraw the property from the market at any time.
C: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since all conditions precedent to the owner's duty to pay the commission were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to perform.
D: The broker can seek recovery for any expenses incurred during the process of finding a buyer.
E: Nothing, because a condition precedent, namely the consummation of the sale and transfer of title, has failed to occur.
F: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the consummation condition to the owner's duty to pay the commission was excused by the owner's refusal without cause to accept the buyer's offer and perform the land sale contract.
G: Quantum meruit for the reasonable value for services rendered in obtaining a buyer for the property.
H: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the broker had obtained a buyer who was willing and able to purchase at a price higher than the minimum set in the brokerage agreement.
I: $62,500, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the original minimum sale price of the property for $1,250,000, since the broker had fulfilled her duty by finding a potential buyer.
J: A court injunction forcing the owner to complete the sale, thus entitling the broker to the full commission.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a brokerage agreement and whether the broker can recover a commission after the owner backed out. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the setup: The owner of a large estate hired a broker with a written agreement. The broker's job was to sell it for at least $1,250,000 using their best efforts. The commission was 5% of the sale price, but only after the sale was completed and title transferred. The agreement lasted two months.

So, a month in, the broker finds a buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. The broker presents a signed contract from the buyer to the owner. The owner checks the buyer's funds, sees they're good, but then decides not to sell. He tells the broker he's canceling the agreement and withdrawing the property. He also refuses to pay any commission.

Now, the broker is suing for breach of contract. The question is about the proper measure of recovery.

Hmm, the key here is understanding the terms of the brokerage contract. The commission was contingent on the sale being consummated and title transferred. So, the broker only gets paid if the sale goes through.

In this case, the owner didn't go through with the sale. He backed out, so the sale wasn't completed. The broker didn't fulfill the condition that would trigger the commission payment. So, does that mean the broker doesn't get anything?

Wait, but the broker did find a ready, willing, and able buyer. But in real estate brokerage contracts, typically the broker's commission is due only upon the successful closing of the sale. If the sale doesn't happen, even if the broker did their part, the commission isn't owed.

So looking at the options:

Option A: $75k plus punitive. That doesn't make sense because punitive damages are rare in contract cases unless there's a tort involved, which isn't indicated here.

Option B: Nothing because owner can withdraw anytime. Well, the owner did withdraw, but if the contract was still in effect, maybe the broker is entitled to something. But the contract's terms about the commission are clear.

Option C: $75k because conditions were met. But the condition was the sale. If the sale didn't happen, this might not apply. Also, C says all conditions precedent were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer. But the payment was conditioned on the sale closing, so that's a condition subsequent or maybe a condition precedent to payment, not to the broker's duty.

Option D: Recover expenses. I don't think so unless the contract allows for that, and the question doesn't mention any such terms. So probably not.

Option E: Nothing because sale didn't happen. This aligns with what I thought earlier. The condition for payment wasn't met.

Option F: $75k because owner's refusal excused the condition. Hmm, this is about whether the owner's action prevented the condition from occurring. In contract law, if one party's breach prevents the condition, the condition is excused. So if the owner refused without cause, maybe the broker can still recover. Let me think: the condition was the sale closing. Owner's refusal caused the failure. So the condition is excused, and the broker can collect the commission because the owner's action was a breach.

Option G: Quantum meruit. That's when you recover the value of services rendered, but in a breach of contract case, you usually can't get that if there's an express contract term. The contract specified payment upon sale, so quantum meruit might not apply.

Option H: $75k because the price was higher than minimum. But again, the sale didn't close, so the condition wasn't met. Unless the contract allows for payment upon procuring a buyer regardless of closing, but the question says payment is after transfer of title.

Option I: 5% on $1.25M. So $62,500. But since the sale was at a higher price, this might not apply. Also, the commission is based on the sale price, which didn't happen.

Option J: Injunction. Courts usually don't force specific performance unless it's a unique property, but even then, the owner could have valid reasons. Plus, the question is about monetary recovery, not specific performance.

So now, considering F and E. If the owner's refusal was a breach, preventing the sale, then the condition is excused. So the broker can collect the commission. Because without the owner's cooperation, the sale couldn't happen, which was a condition for payment.

Wait, but the brokerage agreement is about the broker's efforts, but the payment is only on the sale. So the condition is the sale happening. The owner's breach prevented that condition, so the condition is excused. Therefore, the broker can recover the commission.

So F is the correct option. It says the condition was excused because the owner refused without cause. So the broker should get $75k.

Wait, but let me double-check. In real estate contracts, typically, the commission is due when the broker procures a buyer who is ready, willing, and able, even if the seller backs out. But that depends on the terms of the contract.

The question says the commission is paid after the sale is consummated. So the condition is the sale closing. If the seller refuses to close, does that relieve the condition for the broker's commission?

In some jurisdictions, if the seller wrongfully refuses to close, the broker can still collect the commission because the seller's action prevented the condition. So the condition is excused, and the commission is owed.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

The brokerage agreement specified that the broker's commission of 5% on the sale price was contingent upon the "consummation of the sale and transfer of title." The broker found a buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, but the owner refused to proceed with the sale, withdrawing the property from the market. The key issue is whether the broker can recover the commission despite the sale not being completed.

Under the terms of the agreement, the commission was explicitly tied to the sale closing. However, the owner's refusal to proceed constitutes a breach of contract, which prevented the condition (consummation of the sale) from being fulfilled. In such cases, the condition is excused due to the owner's unjustified refusal, allowing the broker to recover the commission. 

Option F correctly reflects this principle, as it states that the consummation condition was excused by the owner's refusal without cause, entitling the broker to the commission of $75,000 (5% of $1,500,000). Other options either fail to account for the excusal of the condition or misinterpret the terms of the agreement.

ANSWER: F
