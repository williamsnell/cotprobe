Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these algebraic expressions. But I'll take it step by step. The problem is to evaluate −7(y − 6) when y equals 8. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that evaluating an expression means substituting the given value into it and simplifying. So, the expression here is −7 multiplied by (y minus 6). And y is 8 in this case.

So, I'll start by replacing y with 8. That gives me −7*(8 − 6). Now, I should handle what's inside the parentheses first because of the order of operations, right? Parentheses come first.

Calculating inside the parentheses: 8 minus 6 is 2. So now the expression simplifies to −7*2. Oh wait, that's straightforward multiplication. But wait, the negative sign is important here. So, 7 multiplied by 2 is 14, but since there's a negative sign in front, it becomes −14. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Yeah, because −7 times 2 is −14. So the result should be −14. Now, looking at the options provided: A is −13, B is 13, C is −15, D is 50, E is 0, F is −62, G is −50, H is −14, I is 62, J is 14. So H is −14. That should be the correct answer.

I think I did everything right, but just to make sure, let me go through it again. Substitute y=8 into (y−6) which is 2, multiply by −7, which gives −14. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is H.

The problem requires evaluating the expression −7(y − 6) when y = 8. 

1. Substitute y = 8 into the expression:  
   −7(8 − 6).  

2. Simplify inside the parentheses:  
   8 − 6 = 2.  

3. Multiply:  
   −7 * 2 = −14.  

Thus, the correct answer is H: −14.  

H
