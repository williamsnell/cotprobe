Question:

In which of the following situations would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?

Options:

A: A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.
B: After consuming a large amount of alcohol at a party, a defendant decided to set a neighbor's car on fire out of spite. He was seen by witnesses and later arrested and charged with arson.
C: A defendant had been drinking at a local pub and got into a heated argument with another patron. The argument escalated, and the defendant pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed the other patron. The defendant is arrested and charged with attempted murder.
D: A defendant had consumed a fifth of bourbon. Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.
E: A defendant spent the evening drinking at a bar. On his way home, he broke into a house, intending to steal valuables. However, he fell asleep on the couch before he could steal anything. He was discovered by the homeowners and arrested and charged with attempted robbery.
F: At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.
G: A defendant was drinking at a bar when he noticed a woman leave her purse unattended. He stole the purse and was later arrested and charged with theft.
H: A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.
I: A defendant had been drinking heavily at a friend's house. Later that evening, he decided to drive home despite being significantly over the legal blood alcohol limit. On the way, he ran a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. The defendant is arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter.
J: After a night of heavy drinking, a defendant broke into a jewelry store and stole several expensive items. He was caught on the store's surveillance cameras and later arrested and charged with burglary.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically when intoxication can't be used to negate criminal culpability. Hmm, I remember from my studies that intoxication can sometimes be a defense, but it depends on the type of crime and the jurisdiction.

The question is asking which situation the defendant's intoxication wouldn't negate their culpability. So I need to look at each option and determine whether intoxication is a valid defense there.

Let me think about the different types of crimes. Generally, crimes can be specific intent crimes or general intent crimes. Specific intent crimes require a particular mental state beyond just the act itself. For example, burglary requires the intent to commit a felony inside the structure. If someone is too intoxicated to form that specific intent, they might not be guilty of burglary, but maybe a different crime.

On the other hand, general intent crimes don't require that specific intent. They just require the intent to perform the act. So for general intent crimes, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense because the person intended the act, even if they were drunk.

Wait, but there's also the concept of voluntary intoxication versus involuntary. Since all these situations involve the defendant drinking, I think they're all cases of voluntary intoxication, which is generally not a defense except for specific intent crimes.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Conspiracy to commit robbery. Conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a crime and the intent to do so. So that's a specific intent crime. If the defendant was too drunk to form that intent, he might have a defense. So here, intoxication could negate culpability. So this situation wouldn't be the answer.

Option B: Arson. Arson is typically a general intent crime. So voluntary intoxication isn't a defense. Wait, but wait, does arson require specific intent to cause damage, or is it enough to just commit the act knowingly? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me think. Arson is the malicious burning of property. Malice could imply a general intent to cause harm. So if the defendant was so drunk he didn't realize what he was doing, maybe it's a general intent crime, so intoxication isn't a defense. But I'm not 100% sure. I'll have to come back to this.

Option C: Attempted murder. Attempt requires specific intent to commit the crime. So if too drunk to form that intent, maybe the defense applies. So the intoxication could negate the specific intent, making him not guilty of attempted murder, but perhaps guilty of a lesser charge. So this situation wouldn't be the answer.

Option D: Assault with intent to commit rape. Assault with intent is a specific intent crime because it requires the intent to commit the underlying offense (rape). So if too intoxicated to form that intent, maybe the defense applies. So intoxication could negate culpability, so this isn't the answer.

Option E: Attempted robbery. Attempted robbery would require specific intent to commit robbery. If too drunk, maybe couldn't form the intent, so intoxication could be a defense. So this situation isn't the answer.

Option F: Statutory rape. Statutory rape is a strict liability crime. That means intent isn't a factor. The crime is complete if the act is done and the victim is underage. So even if the defendant was drunk and mistakenly thought the victim was of age, it doesn't matter. Intoxication isn't a defense for strict liability crimes. So this could be the answer.

Option G: Theft. Theft requires the intent to permanently deprive the owner of property. So that's a specific intent crime. If the defendant was too drunk to form that intent, maybe the defense applies. So this isn't the answer.

Option H: Assault with intent to commit battery. Assault is generally a general intent crime. Wait, or specific? Assault can vary. If it's an attempted battery, which is a specific intent crime, then intoxication could be a defense. But if it's a general intent, then not. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. Battery is a general intent crime. So when the charge is assault with intent to commit battery, maybe it's similar to attempted battery, which would require specific intent. Wait, no. Assault is an intentional act that causes apprehension. So it's a general intent crime. So voluntary intoxication wouldn't negate it. So this could be the answer.

Option I: Vehicular manslaughter. Manslaughter is typically a general intent crime. But vehicular manslaughter can be either misdemeanor manslaughter (which might be based on a misdemeanor like DUI) or involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter is a general intent crime. So if the defendant was too drunk, but the crime is based on recklessness or negligence, which doesn't require specific intent. Wait, but I thought that for involuntary manslaughter, the prosecution needs to show criminal negligence, which is a subjective standard. So if the defendant was too drunk to perceive the risk, maybe that could affect it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the charge is based on the misdemeanor of DUI leading to death, then it's a strict liability in terms of the result. Hmm, this is getting complicated. I might need to research this more, but perhaps intoxication doesn't negate the culpability here.

Option J: Burglary. Burglary requires breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony inside. That's specific intent. So if too drunk to form that intent, the defense applies. So this isn't the answer.

So, back to the options. Let's reevaluate.

Option F: Statutory rape is a strict liability offense. So even if the defendant was intoxicated, he can't use that as a defense. So in this case, intoxication wouldn't negate culpability.

Option H: Assault with intent to commit battery. If the crime is general intent, then intoxication isn't a defense. But I'm not sure. Assault is typically a general intent crime, but the specific intent part is about the intent to commit battery. Wait, perhaps the charge is for assault with intent, which is a specific intent. Or is it? Let me clarify.

Assault is generally intentional, but specific intent crimes require more. So perhaps the "intent to commit battery" part makes it specific. Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. The crime of assault with intent to commit a felony (like battery) would require the specific intent to commit that felony. So if the defendant was too drunk to form that intent, he couldn't be guilty of that specific charge. But if the charge is just assault, which is general intent, then intoxication isn't a defense.

Wait, the option says "assault with the intent to commit battery." So battery is a general intent crime, but the intent to commit it would be a specific intent. So perhaps the charge requires specific intent. Thus, intoxication could be a defense. So in that case, the intoxication would negate culpability, meaning this situation isn't the answer.

So the only option where intoxication doesn't negate is when the crime is strict liability. Looking back, Option F is statutory rape, which is strict liability. So the answer should be F.

Wait, let me double-check. Statutory rape doesn't require mens rea as to the victim's age. The defendant's mistaken belief about the age isn't a defense. So even if he was drunk and thought she was older, it's no defense. So yes, in this case, intoxication can't negate culpability.

So the answer is F.

To determine in which situation the defendant's intoxication would not negate criminal culpability, it is important to analyze the nature of the crimes and whether they are specific intent, general intent, or strict liability crimes. Voluntary intoxication can sometimes serve as a defense for specific intent crimes, as it may prevent the formation of the required mental state. However, for general intent crimes and strict liability crimes, voluntary intoxication is generally not a valid defense.

### Analysis of Each Option:

- **Option A**: Conspiracy to commit robbery is a specific intent crime, as it requires an agreement to commit a crime and the intent to do so. Intoxication could potentially negate the specific intent, making it a defense. Thus, this is not the answer.

- **Option B**: Arson is typically a general intent crime, as it involves the intent to commit the act of burning property. Voluntary intoxication is not a defense for general intent crimes, but there may be nuances depending on the jurisdiction. However, this is not the clearest example.

- **Option C**: Attempted murder is a specific intent crime, as it requires the intent to kill. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form this intent, intoxication could serve as a defense. Thus, this is not the answer.

- **Option D**: Assault with intent to commit rape is a specific intent crime, as it requires the intent to commit rape. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form this intent, intoxication could serve as a defense. Thus, this is not the answer.

- **Option E**: Attempted robbery is a specific intent crime, as it requires the intent to commit robbery. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form this intent, intoxication could serve as a defense. Thus, this is not the answer.

- **Option F**: Statutory rape is a strict liability crime. The crime is complete if the act is committed and the victim is underage, regardless of the defendant's intent or knowledge of the victim's age. Intoxication is not a defense for strict liability crimes. This is the correct answer.

- **Option G**: Theft is a specific intent crime, as it requires the intent to permanently deprive the owner of property. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form this intent, intoxication could serve as a defense. Thus, this is not the answer.

- **Option H**: Assault with intent to commit battery involves the intent to commit battery, which could be considered a specific intent crime. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form this intent, intoxication could serve as a defense. Thus, this is not the answer.

- **Option I**: Vehicular manslaughter is typically a general intent crime or based on recklessness or negligence. While intoxication may not negate culpability in some cases, this is not the clearest example.

- **Option J**: Burglary is a specific intent crime, as it requires the intent to commit a felony inside the structure. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form this intent, intoxication could serve as a defense. Thus, this is not the answer.

### Conclusion:
The only situation where intoxication would not negate criminal culpability is **Option F**, as statutory rape is a strict liability crime, and voluntary intoxication is not a valid defense.
