Okay, I'm trying to tackle this genetics problem here. So, the question has two parts, (a) and (b), both dealing with changes in gene frequency due to mutation. I remember that when a population is in genetic equilibrium, it means that the allele frequencies aren't changing from generation to generation. But here, they're introducing mutation rates, so the equilibrium will be disrupted, at least in the first part.

Let's start with part (a). The initial frequency of allele d is given as q = 0.2. The mutation rate from D to d is u = 4.1e-5, and the back mutation rate v is 2.5e-7. I think the question is asking for the change in q in the first generation after these mutations are introduced.

Wait, but wait. I remember that in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequencies change due to factors like mutation. So the change in q (Δq) can be calculated using the mutation rates. But how exactly?

Oh right, the formula when considering mutation and selection (but no selection here) is Δq ≈ (u * p) - (v * q). Because each generation, some D alleles mutate to d (which is u multiplied by the frequency of D, p), and some d alleles mutate back to D (v multiplied by q). So the net change in q is the gain from D to d minus the loss from d to D.

Since p is the frequency of D, and p + q = 1, p = 1 - q. So initially, p is 0.8 because q is 0.2.

So plugging in the numbers: u is 4.1e-5, p is 0.8. So u*p is 4.1e-5 * 0.8 = let's calculate that. 4.1e-5 is 0.000041. 0.000041 * 0.8 = 0.0000328.

Then v is 2.5e-7, and q is 0.2. So v*q is 2.5e-7 * 0.2 = 5e-8, which is 0.00000005.

So the change Δq is 0.0000328 - 0.00000005 = approximately 0.00003275. Wait, or is it v*q subtracted? Because the net change is gain minus loss. So yes, u*p is gain, v*q is loss.

So the change in q is positive 0.00003275. So the first part's answer would be this value.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Some sources say that the change in q is (u p) - (v q). Yeah, that makes sense. So I think this is correct.

Now for part (b), the question is about mutational equilibrium. At equilibrium, the allele frequency stops changing, so Δq = 0. Therefore, u p = v q.

At equilibrium, let's denote q as q_eq. So u p = v q_eq. But p is 1 - q_eq. So substituting, u (1 - q_eq) = v q_eq.

Let me write this equation:

u (1 - q_eq) = v q_eq

Expanding:

u - u q_eq = v q_eq

Bring terms together:

u = u q_eq + v q_eq = q_eq (u + v)

So solving for q_eq:

q_eq = u / (u + v)

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the algebra again.

Wait, equation is u (1 - q_eq) = v q_eq.

So u - u q_eq = v q_eq

Bring all terms to one side:

u = q_eq (u + v)

Thus,

q_eq = u / (u + v)

Wait, no. Wait, let me see:

Wait, u (1 - q) = v q

Multiply out:

u - u q = v q

Bring the u q and v q to the same side:

u = q (u + v)

Thus,

q = u / (u + v)

Wait, so q_eq is u divided by (u + v). Let me compute that.

u is 4.1e-5, v is 2.5e-7.

u + v = 4.1e-5 + 0.25e-6 = 4.1e-5 + 0.00000025 = 0.000041 + 0.00000025 = 0.00004125, which is 4.125e-5.

So u/(u + v) = 4.1e-5 / 4.125e-5 = approximately 0.9942... Wait, let me calculate that.

4.1e-5 is 0.000041.

4.125e-5 is 0.00004125.

Dividing 0.000041 by 0.00004125:

0.000041 / 0.00004125 = 41 / 41.25 ≈ 0.994239.

So q_eq ≈ 0.9942.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because when u is much larger than v, the equilibrium q is high. Because u is the rate of D mutating to d, so higher u should lead to higher q. Let me think: u is 4.1e-5, which is larger than v (2.5e-7). So q_eq should be high, which matches the calculation of 0.9942.

Wait, but wait another thing. If u is the mutation rate from D to d, and v from d to D, then at equilibrium, q would be u/(u + v). Hmm, but I thought sometimes in these models, if selection isn't involved, the equilibrium q is u/(u + v). So yes, that's correct here.

So for part (b), the equilibrium q is approximately 0.9942.

Now, looking back at the options. Let's list what each option has.

Option A: 0.00003275, 0.9939

B: 0.0000325, 0.9942

C: 0.000034, 0.9941

D: 0.000033, 0.9938

E: 0.000031, 0.9937

F: 0.0000345, 0.9935

G: 0.0000315, 0.9943

H: 0.00003275, 0.9940

I: 0.000032, 0.9940

J: 0.0000335, 0.9936

So for part (a), the change is approximately 0.00003275, which matches option A and H. For part (b), the equilibrium is approximately 0.9942, which is option B and I think another. Let me check.

Looking at the options, option B's second value is 0.9942. Option I's second value is 0.9940. Option H's second value is 0.9940. So our calculated part (a) is 0.00003275, which is in options A and H. Part (b) is 0.9942, which is in option B.

Wait, but the correct option needs to have both parts correct. So for part (a), our calculation was 0.00003275, and part (b) 0.9942.

Looking for an option where part (a) is 0.00003275, and (b) is 0.9942. But looking at the options, none of them have both. Because option B has part (a) 0.0000325, part (b) 0.9942. Option H has part (a) 0.00003275, part (b) 0.9940. So neither matches both.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in part (b). Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, u is 4.1e-5, which is 0.000041.

v is 2.5e-7, which is 0.00000025.

u + v is 0.000041 + 0.00000025 = 0.00004125.

So u/(u + v) = 0.000041 / 0.00004125 = 0.994239... Approximately 0.99424, which rounds to 0.9942 or 0.99424.

Looking at the options, option B's part (b) is 0.9942. So that's correct.

But for part (a), the change is 0.00003275, which is 3.275e-5. Looking at the options, option H has 0.00003275 as part (a), but part (b) is 0.9940. So in this case, perhaps the correct option is H for part (a) and B for part (b), but since each option covers both, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express Δq correctly. Let me go back.

Δq for part (a) is (u p) - (v q).

Given that p is 0.8, u = 4.1e-5, so u*p = 4.1e-5 *0.8 = 3.28e-5.

v = 2.5e-7, q=0.2: v*q =5e-8.

So Δq = 3.28e-5 -5e-8 = 3.275e-5 = 0.00003275.

So part (a) is 0.00003275, which is exactly option A and H for part (a).

But looking for an option where both (a) and (b) match. None have both correct parts. So perhaps I made a mistake in part (b).

Wait, maybe I calculated part (b) wrong. Let me think again. At equilibrium, u p = v q.

So q_eq = (u / v) * p_eq.

Wait, no. Let's go through it again.

At equilibrium, the change is zero, so:

u * p_eq = v * q_eq.

But p_eq = 1 - q_eq.

So u (1 - q_eq) = v q_eq.

u - u q_eq = v q_eq.

u = q_eq (u + v).

So q_eq = u / (u + v).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me compute u/(u + v) again.

u = 4.1e-5 = 0.000041.

v = 2.5e-7 = 0.00000025.

u + v = 0.000041 + 0.00000025 = 0.00004125.

u/(u + v) = 0.000041 / 0.00004125.

Let me compute this division.

0.000041 ÷ 0.00004125 = ?

Let me write it as 41e-6 ÷ 41.25e-6 = 41 / 41.25 ≈ 0.994239.

So approximately 0.99424, which is 0.9942 when rounded to four decimal places.

So part (b) is 0.9942.

Now, looking at the options, option B has part (b) 0.9942, but part (a) is 0.0000325.

Option H has part (a) 0.00003275, part (b) 0.9940.

So the correct answers would be part (a) 0.00003275 and part (b) 0.9942.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct option is not present. But that can't be. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option I has part (a) 0.000032 and part (b) 0.9940. No.

Option H: part (a) is 0.00003275, part (b) 0.9940.

Hmm, but the correct part (b) is 0.9942, so perhaps option H isn't the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of part (a). Let me recalculate.

u * p = 4.1e-5 * 0.8 = 3.28e-5.

v * q = 2.5e-7 * 0.2 = 5e-8.

Δq = 3.28e-5 -5e-8 = 3.275e-5 = 0.00003275.

Yes, that's correct. So part (a) is 0.00003275, and part (b) is 0.9942.

Looking at the options, the only one with part (a) 0.00003275 is option H and A. Option H has part (b) 0.9940, which is close to 0.9942 but not exact. Option A's part (b) is 0.9939, which is further off.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value for part (b).

u = 4.1e-5, v=2.5e-7.

u + v =4.1e-5 + 0.25e-6 = 4.1e-5 + 0.00000025 = 0.0000410000 + 0.00000025 = 0.00004125.

So u/(u + v) = 4.1e-5 / 4.125e-5.

Let me compute 4.1 /4.125.

4.1 ÷4.125 = (4.1 * 10000) / (4.125 * 10000) )= 41000 / 41250 = 0.9942 approx.

Wait, 41250 × 0.9942 = 41250 × 0.99 = 40800 - wait, perhaps exact calculation:

Compute 4.1 /4.125.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 4100 / 4125.

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 25.

4100 ÷25=164, 4125 ÷25=165.

So 164/165.

Compute 164 ÷165. 165 × 0.994 is 0.994 ×165= 164.16.

Wait, 164 ÷165 = approx 0.99424... So 0.99424.

So part (b) is approximately 0.99424, which is 0.9942 when rounded to four decimal places.

Looking back at the options, the only option with part (b) 0.9942 is option B. But option B's part (a) is 0.0000325, not 0.00003275.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any other option matches both parts correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a).

Wait, in part (a), Δq is u p - v q.

u p is 4.1e-5 * 0.8 = 3.28e-5.

v q is 2.5e-7 * 0.2 =5e-8.

So Δq = 3.28e-5 -5e-8 = 3.275e-5 = 0.00003275.

Yes, that's correct.

So the options that have part (a) as 0.00003275 are A and H.

Option H's part (b) is 0.9940, which is less precise. Option B's part (b) is correct, but part (a) is 0.0000325.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact value of u p and v q again.

u p = 4.1e-5 * 0.8.

4.1e-5 is 0.000041.

0.000041 * 0.8 = 0.0000328.

v q =2.5e-7 * 0.2 =5e-8 = 0.00000005.

So Δq = 0.0000328 - 0.00000005 = 0.00003275.

Yes, that's correct. So part (a) is 0.00003275.

Looking back, the only option that has part (a) 0.00003275 is option H and A.

Option H: part (a) 0.00003275, part (b) 0.9940.

But our calculation for part (b) is 0.99424, which is closer to 0.9942 than to 0.9940.

Wait, perhaps the options have rounded differently. Let me see.

Option B's part (b) is 0.9942, which matches perfectly. But part (a) is 0.0000325, which is 3.25e-5, but our calculation is 3.275e-5 (0.00003275).

So part (a) is 3.275e-5, which is 0.00003275.

Looking for an option where part (a) is 0.00003275 and part (b) is 0.9942, but I don't see such an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option H, but part (b) is 0.9940 in that option, which is 0.9940, but our calculation is 0.9942. Hmm, but perhaps due to rounding during the calculation, it might be presented as 0.9940.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the back mutation for part (a), but that doesn't make sense because the question says that both mutation rates are introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup for part (a). Let me think: when introducing mutation, the change in q is approximately (u p) - (v q). Because in one generation, each D allele has a chance u to mutate to d, and each d has a chance v to mutate back. Since the population was in equilibrium before, but now mutations are happening, the first generation change is Δq = u p - v q.

Wait, another approach. The new q after one generation would be q + Δq. But in this case, part (a) is asking for the change in q, so Δq is what I calculated.

So given that, the only option with part (a) 0.00003275 is H and A. But looking at their part (b)s:

Option H: part (b) is 0.9940.

But our calculation for part (b) is 0.99424, which is approximately 0.9942.

So perhaps the intended answer is option H, but that would mean part (b) is
