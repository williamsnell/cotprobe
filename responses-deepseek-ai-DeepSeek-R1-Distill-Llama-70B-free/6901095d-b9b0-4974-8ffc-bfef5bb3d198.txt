Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Jackson borrowing money. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, he borrowed $150 from his bank, and he has to pay it back in 90 days. The interest rate is 6%. I need to find out how much he'll owe at the end of those 90 days.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the different types of interest calculations. I remember there's simple interest and compound interest. I think simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, whereas compound interest is on the principal plus any accumulated interest. But I'm not sure which one applies here.

The problem doesn't specify whether the interest is compounded or not. Usually, when the time period is short, like 90 days, sometimes it's simple interest. But I'm not certain. I should probably think about both methods just in case.

Let me start with simple interest. The formula is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. So here, P is $150, r is 6%, which is 0.06 as a decimal, and t is 90 days. Wait, I need to convert that into years because the rate is annual. 

So 90 days is 90/365 years. Let me calculate that. 90 divided by 365 is approximately 0.2466 years. 

Now plugging into the formula: I = 150 * 0.06 * 0.2466. Let me compute that. 150 times 0.06 is 9. Then 9 times 0.2466 is about 2.22. So the interest would be around $2.22. Adding that to the principal, the total amount due is $150 + $2.22 = $152.22. Hmm, looking at the options, I see F is $152.25, which is close to my calculation. But wait, maybe I made a rounding error.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated using another method. Oh, wait! Sometimes, for short-term loans, interest might be calculated as (principal * rate * time) without converting time to years. But that doesn't make much sense because the rate is annual. Oh wait, another thought: perhaps the rate is 6% per annum, so for 90 days, it's a quarter of a year? No, 90 days is a quarter of a year (since 365/4 is about 91), but sometimes people approximate it as a quarter. So 6% divided by 4 is 1.5%. So 150 * 1.5% is 2.25. So total would be 152.25, which is exactly option F.

Wait, but in my first calculation, I got approximately 2.22, which is about 2.25 when rounded. So that makes sense. So the total due is $152.25, which is option F.

But wait another thought: sometimes, especially with bank loans, they might use 360 days a year for calculations, which is common in some financial contexts. Let me check that. So 90 days would be 90/360, which is 0.25 exactly. So I = 150 * 0.06 * 0.25 = 150 * 0.015 = 2.25. So yes, same result. So that's $152.25, which is option F.

But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says the interest rate is 6%, and the time is 90 days. Since it's a short period, simple interest makes sense. So using the 360-day method gives 90/360 = 0.25, so 6% * 0.25 = 1.5%. 1.5% of 150 is 2.25. So the total is 150 +2.25 = 152.25. Yep, that's option F.

To determine the amount Mr. Jackson will owe at the end of 90 days, we calculate the simple interest on the loan. The formula for simple interest is:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$150 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t = \frac{90}{360} = 0.25 \) (time in years, assuming a 360-day year for simplicity).

Substituting the values:

\[
I = 150 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.25 = 2.25
\]

The total amount due is the sum of the principal and the interest:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 150 + 2.25 = 152.25
\]

Thus, the amount due at the end of 90 days is **\$152.25**, which corresponds to option **F**.
