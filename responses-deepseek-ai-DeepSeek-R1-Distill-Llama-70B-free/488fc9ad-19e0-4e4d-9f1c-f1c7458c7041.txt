Okay, so I have this fluid mechanics problem here about boundary layer thickness and displacement thickness. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says oil is flowing past a flat plate. The specific gravity is 0.96, which I think relates to density. Oh wait, specific gravity is the ratio of the fluid's density to water's density at a reference temperature. So if sp. gr. is 0.96, the oil's density is 0.96 times water's. But wait, what's water's density in the units here? The problem uses feet and inches, so probably the Imperial system. Water's density is about 62.4 lbm per cubic foot. So oil's density would be 0.96 * 62.4 lbm/ft³. Let me calculate that: 0.96 *62.4 is... 59.904 lbm/ft³.

The viscosity mu is given as 50 centipoise. Oh wait, centipoise is 0.01 Poise, and 1 Poise is 1 dyne·s/cm². But in the Imperial system, viscosity is often in lbm/(ft·s) or sometimes in centipoise converted. Wait, 1 centipoise is 0.0001 lbm/(ft·s) because 1 Poise is 0.067196 lbm/(ft·s), so 50 cp is 50 * 0.0001 = 0.005 lbm/(ft·s). So mu is 0.005 lbm/(ft·s).

The free-stream velocity U is 1.1 ft/s. The length along the plate is 6 inches, which is 0.5 feet.

The question is asking for the boundary layer thickness (delta) and the displacement thickness (delta star) at x = 6 inches from the leading edge.

I remember that for flow over a flat plate, the boundary layer is laminar if the Reynolds number is below a certain value. The Reynolds number Re is (U * x) / nu. But wait, nu is the kinematic viscosity, which is mu/rho.

So first, let's compute Re. Let me get all the variables right.

U = 1.1 ft/s
x = 0.5 ft
mu = 0.005 lbm/(ft·s)
rho = 59.904 lbm/ft³

Kinematic viscosity nu = mu / rho. So 0.005 / 59.904. Let's compute that: approximately 0.0000835 ft²/s.

Then Re = (1.1 * 0.5) / 0.0000835. Let's calculate numerator: 0.55. So 0.55 / 0.0000835 ≈ let's see, 0.55 divided by about 8e-5. Let me compute 0.55 / 0.0000835.

Wait, 0.0000835 is approximately 8.35e-5. So 0.55 / 8.35e-5 = (0.55 / 8.35) * 1e5. 0.55 / 8.35 is around 0.0658. Multiply by 1e5 gives 6580. So Re ≈ 6580.

Wait, I thought that the critical Reynolds number for laminar flow is around 500,000. So Re here is 6580, which is well below that. So the flow is definitely laminar. Therefore, we can use the laminar boundary layer equations.

For laminar flow over a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness delta is given by:

delta = (4 * x) / sqrt(Re_x)

Wait, I think the exact formula is delta = (5 * x) / sqrt(Re_x) * something. No, wait, I might be mixing it up. Let me think. For a flat plate with laminar flow, the boundary layer thickness can be calculated using the formula:

delta = (4 * x) / sqrt(Re_x)

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. The solution for the boundary layer on a flat plate is Blasius's solution. From what I remember, the boundary layer thickness at a distance x from the leading edge is given by:

delta = (5 * x) / sqrt(Re_x) * (some factor). Wait no, Blasius's solution gives delta as a function involving the square root of the Reynolds number.

Wait, I think the correct formula is delta = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x). Or wait, maybe delta = (5 x)/(sqrt(Re_x)) * something. Alternatively, I remember that for the Blasius solution, the boundary layer thickness at a given x is:

delta = (4.96 x) * (1/ sqrt(Re_x)) )

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact expression. Oh right, the formula is delta = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x). So Re_x is the Reynolds number based on x.

Wait, let me confirm that. So Re_x = (rho * U * x) / mu. Which is the same as (U x) / nu, which we calculated as about 6580.

So delta = (4.96 * x) / sqrt(Re_x). Let me plug in the numbers.

x is 0.5 ft.

So 4.96 * 0.5 = 2.48.

sqrt(Re_x) is sqrt(6580). Let me compute that. 81^2 is 6561, so sqrt(6580) is about 81.1.

So delta ≈ 2.48 / 81.1 ≈ approximately 0.0306 ft. Because 2.48 / 81 is about 0.0306.

Wait, 0.0306 feet. To inches, multiply by 12. So 0.0306 * 12 ≈ 0.367 inches. So about 0.37 inches.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have 0.37 for delta. The closest options are A, C, G, etc. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I mixed up the formula for delta. Let me recall: for a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness is given by delta = (5 * x) / (sqrt(Re_x)) * (some factor). Or wait, perhaps it's (4.96 x) / (Re_x^(1/2)).

Wait, another approach: the formula I have in my notes is that for laminar flow,

delta = (5 x) / (Re_x^{1/2}) ) * ( something )

Wait, wait, perhaps another formula for delta. Let me look it up in my mind. Oh, maybe I should have used the formula:

delta = (4 * x) / sqrt(Re_x) * sqrt( (mu/rho U x) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me try again.

Re_x = (rho U x) / mu.

nu = mu / rho => nu = (mu)/(rho).

So Re_x = (U x) / (nu).

So delta = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x). So 4.96 * x is 4.96 * 0.5 = 2.48.

Divide by sqrt(Re_x) which is sqrt(6580) ≈ 81.1.

So 2.48 /81.1 ≈ 0.0306 ft = 0.367 inches.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option C: delta 0.75, displacement 0.25. No, that's 0.75, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Re_x. Let me recalculate Re_x.

mu is 50 cp. Oh wait, 50 cp is 0.005 lbm/(ft·s). Correct.

rho is 59.904 lbm/ft³.

U is 1.1 ft/s.

x is 0.5 ft.

Re_x = (rho U x) / mu.

So:

rho U x = 59.904 lbm/ft³ * 1.1 ft/s * 0.5 ft.

Calculating that: 59.904 * 1.1 = 65.8944. Multiply by 0.5: 32.9472.

So numerator is 32.9472 (lbm/(ft²·s)).

mu is 0.005 lbm/(ft·s).

So Re_x = 32.9472 / 0.005 = 32.9472 / 0.005 = 6594.4.

So Re_x ≈ 6594.4.

So sqrt(6594.4) is about 81.2.

So delta = (4.96 * 0.5) / 81.2 = (2.48)/81.2 ≈ 0.03056 ft = 0.3667 inches.

Hmm, so about 0.367 inches for delta.

Looking at the options:

Option A: delta 0.5 inches. Hmm, no. Option C: delta 0.75. No. Option G: 0.65. Option H: 0.8. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Another thought: perhaps the formula I used is for delta in feet, but maybe I should have converted x to another unit?

Wait, no. Because x is in feet, and the formula gives delta in feet.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have used a different formula for delta. Alternatively, the formula for delta might involve the square root of (x * mu/(rho U)) or something.

Wait, let me think about the exact formula again. The Blasius solution for the boundary layer on a flat plate gives delta as:

delta = (4.96 x) / (sqrt(Re_x)).

Wait, that's what I used. But let me check another source. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up delta and theta (the momentum thickness).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is delta = (5 x) / (sqrt(Re_x)). Let me try that.

Wait, 5 * 0.5 = 2.5. 2.5 / 81.1 ≈ 0.03086 ft → 0.370 inches. Same result.

So perhaps I'm correct on delta being approximately 0.367 inches.

Wait, but none of the options have 0.37 for delta. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 0.50, 0.15
B: 1.25, 0.50
C: 0.75, 0.25
D:0.90, 0.333
E:1.15,0.45
F:1.0, 0.4
G:0.65,0.20
H:0.80,0.30
I:0.85,0.28
J:0.95, 0.38

Hmm, so none of the options have delta around 0.37 inches. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Or perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the displacement thickness delta star.

The displacement thickness is given by:

delta_star = (3/10) delta.

Wait, no, wait. For a flat plate with laminar flow, the displacement thickness delta^* is related to delta. The formula is delta^* = (1/2) delta for a linear velocity profile, but the actual Blasius solution gives delta^* = (3/10) delta. Or wait, no. Let me think.

Blasius's solution gives the momentum thickness theta as:

theta = 0.664 x / sqrt(Re_x).

And delta is 4.96 x / sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, so delta is about 7.5 times theta (since 4.96 / 0.664 ≈ 7.47).

The displacement thickness delta^* is the integral of (1 - u/u0) dy from 0 to delta. For the Blasius solution, I think delta^* is (3/2) theta. Let me check that.

Wait, another approach: I think the displacement thickness is about 1.7 times theta. Because theta is the momentum thickness, and delta^* is 1.7 theta.

Wait, I think the correct relation is delta^* = (3/2) theta. Or maybe delta^* = (1/2) delta.

Alternatively, I've heard that delta^* = (1/3) delta. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think. For a linear velocity profile (assuming u increases linearly from 0 to U at delta), then (1 - u/U) is (1 - y/delta). The integral from 0 to delta of (1 - y/delta) dy is:

Integral (1 - y/delta) dy from 0 to delta.

= [ y - (y^2)/(2 delta) ] from 0 to delta.

= delta - (delta²)/(2 delta)
= delta - delta/2
= delta/2.

So delta^* = delta/2. But that's for a linear profile. However, in the Blasius solution, the velocity profile is more curved, so the factor is different.

In the Blasius solution, the displacement thickness is:

delta^* = (3/10) x / sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact expressions.

From Blasius's solution, the boundary layer thickness is:

delta = 4.96 x / sqrt(Re_x).

The displacement thickness is:

delta^* = (3/10) x / (sqrt(Re_x)).

Wait, let me compute that.

So, delta^* = (0.3) * x / sqrt(Re_x).

x is 0.5 ft, so 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15.

Divide by sqrt(Re_x) ≈ 81.1.

So 0.15 /81.1 ≈ 0.00185 ft, which is 0.00185 * 12 ≈ 0.0222 inches.

Wait, that can't be right because that's way too small. The options give displacement thicknesses like 0.15 to 0.45 inches.

Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relationship between delta and delta^*, given that delta is 4.96 x / sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, let's get the exact relations. From the Blasius solution:

The boundary layer thickness delta is 4.960 x / sqrt(Re_x).

The displacement thickness delta^* is 1.720 theta, where theta is the momentum thickness, theta = 0.664 x / sqrt(Re_x).

So delta^* = 1.720 * 0.664 x / sqrt(Re_x).

So delta^* = (1.720 * 0.664) x / sqrt(Re_x).

Calculating 1.720 * 0.664: approximately 1.720 * 0.664 ≈ 1.142.

So delta^* ≈ 1.142 x / sqrt(Re_x).

x is 0.5 ft.

So 1.142 * 0.5 = 0.571.

Divide by sqrt(Re_x) ≈ 81.1.

So 0.571 / 81.1 ≈ 0.00704 ft.

0.00704 ft * 12 inches/ft = 0.0845 inches.

Hmm, that's about 0.085 inches, which is still much smaller than the options given.

Wait, that can't be right. I must be making a mistake here.

Another thought: perhaps in the formula for delta^*, I should have used the same coefficient as delta but scaled by a factor.

Wait, another approach: I think the displacement thickness for a flat plate in laminar flow is given by delta^* = (2/3) delta.

Because delta is 4.96 x / sqrt(Re_x), and delta^* is (2/3) of that.

So delta^* = (2/3) * (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, wait, let me think. Maybe I'm confusing with the momentum thickness theta.

Wait, let me get it straight.

In laminar flow over a flat plate, the momentum thickness theta is:

theta = 0.664 x / sqrt(Re_x).

The boundary layer thickness delta is:

delta = 4.96 x / sqrt(Re_x).

The displacement thickness delta^* is:

delta^* = 1.72 theta = 1.72 * 0.664 x / sqrt(Re_x) = 1.142 x / sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, so delta^* is about 1.142 x / sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, plugging in the numbers:

x = 0.5 ft.

So 1.142 * 0.5 = 0.571.

Divide by 81.1 (sqrt(Re_x)) → 0.571 /81.1 ≈ 0.00704 ft → 0.0845 inches.

Again, that's about 0.085 inches, but all the options are higher.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formulas. Alternatively, perhaps I'm calculating Re_x incorrectly.

Wait, let me double-check the Re_x calculation.

mu is 50 cp. So 50 centipoise.

1 cp = 0.0001 lbm/(ft·s), so 50 cp = 0.005 lbm/(ft·s).

Density rho: sp. gr. of oil is 0.96, water is 62.4 lbm/ft³, so oil is 0.96 * 62.4 = 59.904 lbm/ft³.

U = 1.1 ft/s.

x = 0.5 ft.

Re_x = (rho * U * x) / mu.

So 59.904 * 1.1 = 65.8944.

65.8944 * 0.5 = 32.9472.

32.9472 / 0.005 = 6594.4.

So Re_x is 6594.4.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the formula for delta^* is (2/3) of delta.

Wait, if delta is 0.367 inches, then delta^* would be (2/3)*0.367 ≈ 0.245 inches.

But none of the options have delta around 0.37 and delta^* around 0.245. The closest is option C (delta 0.75, delta^* 0.25), but that's a larger delta. Or option I (delta 0
