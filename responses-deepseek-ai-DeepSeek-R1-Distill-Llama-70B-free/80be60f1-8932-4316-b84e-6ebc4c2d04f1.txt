Okay, so I've got this physics problem about heat conduction in a metallic rod. Hmm, I remember this has to do with the heat equation, probably using Fourier's law. Let's see what the question says.

The rod is 20 cm long, so that's 0.2 meters. It's initially heated to 100 degrees Celsius uniformly. Then, at time t=0, both ends are put into an ice bath at 0 degrees. So the boundary conditions are fixed at 0°C on both ends. Also, no heat escapes through the sides, which means it's a one-dimensional problem, right? So the heat only flows along the length of the rod.

The question is about finding the temperature at the center of the bar after 30 seconds. The bar is made of silver, so I'll need the thermal properties of silver for this. I think thermal diffusivity is important here. Oh, right, the diffusivity (usually denoted as α) would be needed for the solution.

I recall that the temperature distribution in such a case is given by the solution to the heat equation with these boundary conditions. The general solution involves a Fourier sine series because the ends are kept at zero. The equation should look something like:

T(x,t) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L)] * e^(- (n²π² α t)/(L²))

Where L is the length of the rod, and the sum is from n=1 to infinity. Since the initial condition is uniform, the coefficients B_n are determined by the Fourier series of the initial temperature.

Wait, the initial condition is T(x,0) = 100°C for all x between 0 and L. So the Fourier series would have B_n terms calculated as:

B_n = (2/L) * ∫[from 0 to L] T(x,0) sin(nπx/L) dx

Since T(x,0) is 100, this becomes (200/L) ∫ sin(...) dx from 0 to L. Let me compute that integral.

The integral of sin(nπx/L) dx from 0 to L is (L/(nπ)) (1 - cos(nπ)). But since n is an integer, cos(nπ) is (-1)^n. So the integral becomes (L/(nπ)) (1 - (-1)^n). 

But wait, when n is even, 1 - (-1)^n is zero, so only odd terms contribute. So n=1,3,5,... 

So B_n = (200/L) * [L/(nπ) (1 - (-1)^n)] * (1/2) ? Wait, no, let me re-calculate.

Wait, B_n is (2/L) * integral from 0 to L of T0 sin(nπx/L) dx. T0 is 100.

So integral becomes 100 * (L/(nπ)) [1 - (-1)^n] evaluated from 0 to L. So B_n = (2/L) * 100 * (L/(nπ)) [1 - (-1)^n ] / 2? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The integral of sin(nπx/L) from 0 to L is (L/(nπ)) [ -cos(nπx/L) ] from 0 to L.

At x=L, cos(nπ) = (-1)^n.

At x=0, cos(0)=1.

So the integral is (L/(nπ)) [ - (-1)^n + 1 ] = (L/(nπ)) [1 - (-1)^n ].

So B_n = (2/L) * (100) * (L/(nπ)) [1 - (-1)^n ].

Simplify this: (200/L) * (L/(nπ)) [1 - (-1)^n ] = (200/(nπ)) [1 - (-1)^n ].

But this is only non-zero when n is odd, because [1 - (-1)^n ] is zero when n is even. So for n=1,3,5..., [1 - (-1)^n ] = 2. So B_n becomes (200/(nπ)) * 2 = 400/(nπ) when n is odd.

So the Fourier series simplifies to:

T(x,t) = Σ [ (400/(nπ)) sin(nπx/L) ) ] * e^(-n²π² α t / L² )

But wait, only for odd n. Because for even n, the coefficients are zero. So we can write this as a sum over odd integers. Let me make a substitution: let n = 2m-1, where m is 1,2,3,...

So T(x,t) = Σ [ (400/( (2m-1) π )) sin( (2m-1) π x / L ) ] * e^( - ( (2m-1)^2 π² α t ) / L² )

Now, we need to find the temperature at the center of the bar. The center is at x = L/2. So we plug x = L/2 into the equation.

So T(L/2, t) = Σ [ (400/( (2m-1) π )) sin( (2m-1) π (L/2) / L ) ) ] * e^( ... )

Simplify the sine term: sin( (2m-1) π (1/2) ) = sin( (2m-1) π/2 )

(2m-1) is 1,3,5,... So when m=1, it's sin(π/2)=1; m=2, sin(3π/2)=-1; m=3, sin(5π/2)=1; and so on. So this alternates between 1 and -1.

So sin( (2m-1) π/2 ) = (-1)^(m+1)

So T(L/2, t) = Σ [ (400/( (2m-1) π )) * (-1)^(m+1) ) ] * e^( - ( (2m-1)^2 π² α t ) / L² )

This can be written as:

T(L/2, t) = (400/π) Σ [ (-1)^(m+1) / (2m-1) ) * e^( - ( (2m-1)^2 π² α t ) / L² ) ]

Now, the sum is from m=1 to infinity.

So this is a bit complicated, but perhaps we can compute the first few terms for an approximate value.

The parameters given are:

Length L = 0.2 m.

Time t =30 seconds.

Silver's thermal diffusivity α: I need to look up the value. From what I remember, silver has a high thermal conductivity, so α would be high. Let me recall: thermal diffusivity for silver is about 1.71 cm²/s. Wait, but wait, units? Let me check.

Wait, the thermal diffusivity α has units of m²/s. But I think the value for silver is around 1.71 cm²/s, which is 1.71e-4 m²/s.

Wait, let me double-check. Silver's thermal diffusivity is approximately 1.71 cm²/s, yes. So α = 1.71e-4 m²/s.

Now, compute the exponent for each term.

The exponent is -( (2m-1)^2 π² α t ) / L².

Let me compute the exponent for m=1: (1)^2 π² α t / (0.2)^2.

Compute each part:

(1)^2 =1

π² ≈9.8696

α =1.71e-4 m²/s

t=30 s

L=0.2 m → L²=0.04 m².

So numerator: 1 * 9.8696 * 1.71e-4 *30.

Compute 9.8696 *1.71e-4 ≈ 0.001687.

Multiply by 30: 0.001687 *30 = 0.05061.

So exponent for m=1: -(0.05061)/(0.04) → -1.26525

So e^(-1.26525) ≈ e^-1.265 ≈ 0.2825.

Hmm, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 1.71e-4 *30 = 5.13e-3.

5.13e-3 *9.8696 ≈ 5.13e-3 * ~10 ≈ 0.0513 (exact? 5.13e-3 *9.8696=0.0506).

So 0.0506 / 0.04 =1.265.

So e^-1.265 ≈ 0.2825.

So first term for m=1:

(400/π) * [1/(1)] * (-1)^(2) * e^-1.265 → (400/pi)*1 * 1 *0.2825.

Wait, (400/pi) is approximately 127.32395.

127.324 * 0.2825 ≈ around 35.94 degrees.

Wait, but that's only the first term. Let's compute the second term (m=2).

m=2:

(2m-1) =3, so (3)^2=9.

Exponent: -(9 * π² * α t ) / L².

Compute numerator: 9 *9.8696 *1.71e-4 *30.

9 *9.8696 ≈ 88.8264.

88.8264 *1.71e-4 = approx 0.01518.

Multiply by 30 → 0.4554.

Divide by L² (0.04): 0.4554 /0.04=11.385.

Exponent is -11.385 → e^-11.385 is about 1.2e-5, which is 0.000012.

So term for m=2 is:

(400/pi) * [ (-1)^(3) / 3 ] * e^-11.385 → (127.324) * [ (-1)^3 /3 ] * 0.000012.

Which is 127.324 * (-1/3) * 0.000012 → 127.324 * (-0.000004) → approx -0.000509.

So the second term is about -0.0005 degrees. That's negligible compared to the first term.

Third term (m=3):

(2m-1)=5 → 25.

Exponent: -(25 * pi^2 * alpha t)/ L².

Compute numerator:25 *9.8696 ≈ 246.74.

246.74 *1.71e-4 = approx 0.04218.

Multiply by 30 → 1.265.

Divide by 0.04 →31.625.

Exponent is -31.625 → e^-31.625 is extremely small, like 2.96e-14. So this term is negligible.

So the main contribution is from the first term, giving approximately 35.94 degrees.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

First term:

(400/pi) * 1 * 1 * e^(-1.26525)

Compute 400/pi: 400/3.14159265≈127.32395.

e^-1.26525: Let's compute using calculator.

1.26525: e^-1 is about 0.3679; 1.26525 is 0.26525 above 1.

The Taylor expansion for e^(-x) around x=1:

e^(-1.265) = e^(-1 - 0.265) = e^-1 * e^-0.265.

e^-0.265 → Approximately 0.767. So overall, 0.3679 * 0.767 ≈ 0.282.

So 127.324 * 0.282 ≈ 127.324 *0.28 → 35.65, 127.324 *0.002 → 0.2546, total ≈35.9046.

So about 35.9 degrees.

Looking at the options, let's check:

Option B is 35.91°C. That's very close.

But wait, I should check if the units and calculations are correct.

Wait, let me recheck the exponent calculation.

Wait, α is 1.71 cm²/s, which is 1.71e-4 m²/s.

But in the exponent, it's (n² π² α t) / (L²).

So for n=1, (1)^2 * π² ≈9.8696.

Multiply by α=1.71e-4 → 9.8696 * 1.71e-4 = approx 0.001687.

Multiply by time t=30 → 0.0506.

Divide by L²=0.04 → 0.0506 /0.04=1.265.

Yes, that's correct.

So the exponent is correct, and the first term is about 35.9 degrees.

The next term is for m=2, which is negligible, as the term is about -0.0005, so the total is approximately 35.9 -0.0005 ≈35.8995, which rounds to 35.90.

Looking at the options, option B is 35.91, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be B:35.91 degrees.

To determine the temperature at the center of a 20 cm silver rod at \( t = 30 \, \mathrm{s} \), we solve the one-dimensional heat equation with fixed boundary conditions. The rod is initially at \( 100^\circ \mathrm{C} \), and both ends are maintained at \( 0^\circ \mathrm{C} \). The solution involves a Fourier sine series:

\[
T(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty B_n \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) e^{-\frac{n^2 \pi^2 \alpha t}{L^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the coefficients \( B_n \)
The initial condition \( T(x,0) = 100^\circ \mathrm{C} \) gives:
\[
B_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_0^L T(x,0) \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) dx
\]
Since \( T(x,0) = 100 \), this simplifies to:
\[
B_n = \frac{200}{n\pi} \left[1 - (-1)^n\right]
\]
For even \( n \), \( B_n = 0 \), so only odd \( n \) contribute. Substituting \( n = 2m-1 \) (where \( m = 1, 2, 3, \dots \)), we get:
\[
B_n = \frac{400}{(2m-1)\pi}
\]

### Step 2: Temperature at the center
At the center (\( x = L/2 \)), the sine terms simplify:
\[
\sin\left(\frac{(2m-1)\pi}{2}\right) = (-1)^{m+1}
\]
Thus, the temperature at the center is:
\[
T\left(\frac{L}{2}, t\right) = \frac{400}{\pi} \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{m+1}}{2m-1} e^{-\frac{(2m-1)^2 \pi^2 \alpha t}{L^2}}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the first few terms
The thermal diffusivity of silver is \( \alpha = 1.71 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{m^2/s} \), and the rod length is \( L = 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \). For \( t = 30 \, \mathrm{s} \), the exponent is:
\[
\text{Exponent} = -\frac{(2m-1)^2 \pi^2 \alpha t}{L^2}
\]
For \( m = 1 \) (\( n = 1 \)):
\[
\text{Exponent} = -\frac{\pi^2 (1.71 \times 10^{-4})(30)}{0.2^2} \approx -1.265
\]
\[
e^{-1.265} \approx 0.282
\]
The first term is:
\[
\frac{400}{\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{1} \cdot 0.282 \approx 35.94^\circ \mathrm{C}
\]

For \( m = 2 \) (\( n = 3 \)):
\[
\text{Exponent} = -\frac{9 \pi^2 (1.71 \times 10^{-4})(30)}{0.2^2} \approx -11.385
\]
\[
e^{-11.385} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-5}
\]
The second term is negligible:
\[
\frac{400}{\pi} \cdot \frac{-1}{3} \cdot 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \approx -0.0005^\circ \mathrm{C}
\]

Higher terms are even smaller and can be ignored.

### Step 4: Final result
The temperature at the center is approximately \( 35.94^\circ \mathrm{C} \), which matches option **B**.
