Question:

A builder wanted to have security systems installed in a series of homes he was building. He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them. On September 11, the builder sent the following fax to the alarm company: "I hereby accept your offer to install the security systems for $100,000. "The alarm company had to pay another wholesaler $10,000 above the price quoted by the supplier for the burglar alarms. As a result, the alarm company advised the builder that the total price for the job would have to be increased to $10,000. The builder replied that he would hold the alarm company to the initially agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company installed the security systems, but the builder has not yet paid them anything. In an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover

Options:

A: The cost of the alarms from the second supplier, because they were an unforeseen expense.
B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated changeof circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.
C: only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.
D: only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.
E: $100,000, because that was the original agreed price, regardless of changes in circumstances.
F: $90,000, because the alarm company had to pay an additional cost.
G: $100,000, because that was the contract price.
H: Nothing, because the builder did not agree to the new price.
I: $100,000, plus damages for the builder's delay in payment.
J: $110,000, because the supplier's inability to supply burglar alarms was unforeseen.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A builder is having homes built and wants security systems installed. He contacts several companies for bids. An alarm company submits a bid, and to do that, they get bids from wholesalers for burglar alarms. One supplier gives them a bid which the alarm company uses in their proposal to the builder.

On September 1, the alarm company sends a bid of $100,000 to the builder. Then, on September 9, the supplier tells the alarm company they can't supply the alarms. So the alarm company has to find another wholesaler, which charges them $10,000 more than the original supplier's quote.

On September 11, the builder sends a fax accepting the alarm company's offer of $100,000. But then the alarm company tells the builder the price has to go up by $10,000 because of the supplier issue. The builder refuses, saying they'll stick to the original $100,000. The alarm company does the work, but the builder hasn't paid yet. Now, the alarm company is suing for the payment. What can they recover?

Hmm. The key here is contract formation and the doctrine of impossibility or frustration. Let me think.

So the alarm company made an offer to the builder on Sept 1, which the builder accepted on Sept 11. That forms a contract for $100,000. But the problem arises when the supplier backs out on Sept 9, which is before the builder accepted the offer. Wait, no, the supplier's notification is on the 9th, and the builder accepts on the 11th.

Wait, so the offer was made on the 1st, and the supplier's refusal on the 9th. Then the builder accepts on the 11th. So when the builder accepted, the alarm company had already known that the supplier couldn't deliver. But did they communicate that to the builder before acceptance?

No, the builder accepted on the 11th without knowing about the supplier issue. So the alarm company had to then inform the builder that the price would increase. But the builder says no, they want to hold to the original price.

So, the contract was formed when the builder accepted the offer on the 11th. At that point, the alarm company had a contract to perform for $100k, but their supplier had already backed out two days before. So the alarm company had to find another supplier at a higher cost.

The question is whether the alarm company can now demand more money, or if they're stuck with the original price.

In contract law, once a contract is formed, the parties are bound by its terms. If unforeseen circumstances make it harder or more expensive to perform, that's usually the contractor's problem, not the client's. The doctrine of impossibility or frustration might apply if the circumstances make performance impossible or fundamentally different, but here, the alarm company found another supplier. They just had to pay more.

So, the alarm company couldn't get out of the contract because the supplier failed; they had to find another way. Therefore, they should still be entitled to the contract price of $100k. They can't demand an extra $10k because that's their problem, not the builder's.

Wait, but what about the initial bid from the supplier? Did the alarm company's bid to the builder include that supplier's price as a basis? Or was it just part of their own calculation? I think the latter. The builder doesn't know or care about the alarm company's suppliers. It's the alarm company's responsibility to manage their own costs.

So when the builder accepted the offer, they formed a contract for $100k. The alarm company must perform, even if their costs went up. So they can recover the $100k.

Looking at the options:

Option E says $100,000 because that was the original agreed price regardless of changes. Option G says the same but mentions contract price. So both E and G seem similar.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option E: $100,000, because that was the original agreed price, regardless of changes in circumstances.

Option G: $100,000, because that was the contract price.

Wait, in the scenario, the contract was formed for $100k. So the builder must pay that. The alarm company canâ€™t demand more. So the correct answer would be either E or G.

But wait, the builder accepted after the supplier issue. So on the 11th, when the builder accepted, the alarm company already knew the supplier couldn't deliver. So when the builder accepted, the alarm company's offer was still open. So the contract is binding at $100k.

But then, when the alarm company later tried to increase the price, that might be a repudiation. If they refused to perform unless the price was increased, that could be a breach. But in this case, the alarm company did perform, but just asked for more money. The builder refused, so when the alarm company sued, what can they recover?

They had to perform the contract, so they can't get more than the contract price. So the answer is either E or G. But looking at the options, E says regardless of changes, which is correct because the builder isn't responsible for the supplier's failure. So the alarm company can recover $100k.

Wait, but what about the initial offer? The alarm company's offer was based on the supplier's bid, which was no longer available when the builder accepted. Does that affect the contract?

In contract law, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance. But here, the alarm company's offer was sent on the 1st. The supplier withdrew on the 9th. The builder accepted on the 11th. So the offer was still open because the alarm company didn't revoke it. So the builder accepted a valid offer, forming a contract.

Therefore, the alarm company can't now demand a higher price. They have to perform for $100k. So the answer is E or G.

But looking at the options, G says $100k because it's the contract price. E says the same but adds "regardless of changes in circumstances." Both are correct, but the options may differ in reasoning.

Wait, the possible answer is G, which directly states it's the contract price. Because the contract was formed, so that's the amount due. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but in the answer options, G is present. Let me check the options again:

Options:

E: $100,000, because that was the original agreed price, regardless of changes in circumstances.

G: $100,000, because that was the contract price.

So both are correct. But the correct reasoning is that it's the contract price, so the builder must pay that. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but another angle: when the builder accepted, the alarm company's offer was based on the supplier's bid, which was no longer available. Is there an issue of mistake here? Like, if the alarm company's offer was based on the supplier's bid, and that bid was revoked before acceptance, then perhaps the offer was based on a mistake.

But the general rule is that an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance. Here, the supplier's bid was used by the alarm company in making their offer. But the supplier's bid was revoked on the 9th, before the builder's acceptance on the 11th. So, does that mean that the alarm company's offer was based on a revoked bid? Hmm.

Wait, the initial offer from the alarm company was made on Sept 1, which was based on the supplier's bid. The supplier then revoked their bid on Sept 9. So when the builder accepted on Sept 11, the alarm company's offer was technically based on a supplier bid that no longer existed. So, could that mean that the alarm company's offer was illusory or based on a mistake?

But in contract law, an offer can be revoked, but if the offeror (alarm company) doesn't revoke it, and the offeree (builder) accepts it, then a contract is formed. The fact that the underlying basis for the offer (the supplier's bid) has been revoked doesn't typically affect the validity of the offer once accepted. Unless the offer was specifically conditioned on the supplier's bid being available, which it wasn't in this case.

So, the contract is valid, and the alarm company must perform for $100k. Therefore, they can recover that amount. So the answer is G.

Wait, but another thought: the alarm company sent the offer on the 1st, and the supplier withdrew on the 9th. The offer was open until the 11th when accepted. So, the alarm company's offer was made in reliance on the supplier's bid, which was revoked before the builder accepted. So, perhaps the alarm company's offer was based on a mistake of fact (thinking the supplier's bid was still valid). But in this case, the mistake was caused by the supplier's revocation. 

In such cases, the offeror (alarm company) might argue that their offer was based on a mistake, making the contract voidable. But in this scenario, the builder had no knowledge of the supplier's issue when accepting the offer. So, the mistake is unilateral, and the contract would still be enforceable. Therefore, the alarm company can't use mistake to get out of the contract.

So, the builder is entitled to hold the alarm company to the contract price of $100k. Thus, the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around contract law principles, specifically the enforceability of the contract price and the impact of unforeseen circumstances on contractual obligations. Here's the analysis:

1. **Contract Formation**:  
   The alarm company submitted a bid of $100,000 to the builder on September 1. The builder accepted this offer on September 11, forming a valid contract for $100,000. At the time of acceptance, the contract was binding, and the alarm company was obligated to perform according to its terms.

2. **Supplier's Withdrawal**:  
   The supplier withdrew its bid on September 9, before the builder accepted the alarm company's offer. While this increased the alarm company's costs, it does not affect the validity of the contract between the alarm company and the builder. The builder had no knowledge of the supplier's withdrawal and accepted the offer in good faith.

3. **Unforeseen Circumstances**:  
   Under contract law, a party is generally bound by the terms of the contract and bears the risk of unforeseen expenses or difficulties in performance. The doctrine of commercial frustration or impossibility does not apply here because the alarm company was able to secure alternative supplies, even at a higher cost.

4. **Repudiation and Performance**:  
   The alarm company attempted to increase the price after the contract was formed, which could be seen as a repudiation of the agreement. However, the alarm company ultimately performed the work, so the issue of repudiation does not prevent recovery of the contract price.

5. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option E**: Correctly states that the alarm company can recover $100,000 because that was the original agreed price, regardless of changes in circumstances.  
   - **Option G**: Also correct, as it states that the alarm company can recover $100,000 because that was the contract price.  
   Both options are valid, but Option G is more precise because it directly references the contract price as the basis for recovery.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The builder is obligated to pay the contract price of $100,000. The alarm company must bear the additional costs resulting from the supplier's withdrawal, as these are considered part of its business risk.

**Final Answer**: G

The answer is G.
