Question:

A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial artists' studios in that city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial figure drawer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the drawer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of an artist's studio in the city. A gallery, located in a neighboring state, has been sending two itinerant artists into the city. Their practice is to draw a picture of a pedestrian, ask him to order a finished painting, and collect a payment of $2. 00. The drawing is sent to a studio, which frames it and mails the framed painting to the customer. The neighboring state does not impose a tax on artists' studios. The gallery challenges the constitutionality of the $100 per year excise tax that is imposed upon its itinerant artists in the city. The court will most likely declare this tax

Options:

A: constitutional, as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce.
B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.
C: constitutional, as it is a valid usage fee for public property.
D: constitutional, as the tax is a valid exercise of the city's power to regulate commerce.
E: unconstitutional, as it violates the principle of equal protection under the law.
F: constitutional, since the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures.
G: unconstitutional, since the tax unfairly burdens out-of-state businesses.
H: unconstitutional, since a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be perfonned in another state.
I: unconstitutional, since it amounts to double taxation.

Okay, so I've got this question about municipal taxes and their constitutionality. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a city imposing two different excise taxes. One is on commercial artists' studios at $200 per year. The other is $100 per year on itinerant commercial figure drawers. These are people who draw on the streets, I think. Oh, and there's a credit allowed against that $100 tax if the drawer or their employer has already paid the studio tax in the city.

So the scenario is a gallery from a neighboring state sends two itinerant artists into the city. They draw pictures of pedestrians, get them to order a finished painting for $2 each, and then send the drawing to a studio. The studio frames it and mails it back. The neighboring state doesn't tax studios, so the gallery is challenging the $100 tax on their artists.

The question is whether the court will find this tax constitutional or not, and under which option.

First, I need to remember some constitutional law principles, especially about taxation and interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause comes into play here, I think. States and municipalities can't impose taxes that unduly burden interstate commerce. Also, there's the concept of equal protection, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

So, the tax in question is $100 per year on itinerant drawers. They're using the streets and sidewalks, so maybe the city is charging for that usage. But the gallery is an out-of-state business, so the tax might affect interstate commerce.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's constitutional as an ad valorem tax on interstate commerce. Wait, ad valorem taxes are based on value, like property taxes. This is a flat $100 fee, not based on value, so A might not be correct.

Option B suggests it's unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax. That would be if the tax treats in-state and out-of-state businesses differently. But in this case, the tax applies to all itinerant drawers, whether they're from in-state or out. Unless the credit only benefits those with studios in the city, which are more likely to be local. So the out-of-state gallery's artists can't get the credit because their employer doesn't have a studio taxed in the city. That could be seen as discriminatory because it favors local businesses over out-of-state ones.

Option C says it's a valid usage fee for public property. The tax is for the privilege of using streets and sidewalks. If it's a fee for using public space, that could be acceptable. But I'm not sure if a flat annual fee qualifies as a proper usage fee, especially if it's applied per person. Maybe if it's reasonable and based on actual usage, but $100 a year might be okay.

Option D claims it's a valid exercise of power to regulate commerce. Municipalities have the power to tax for services, but if the tax is discriminatory or unduly burdensome, it's a problem under the Commerce Clause.

Option E says unconstitutional under equal protection. Equal protection would require similar treatment, but unless the tax explicitly targets out-of-state, it's more about Commerce Clause than equal protection.

Option F argues it's constitutional because it's taxing the local activity of drawing. Since the artists are performing the service within the city, the city can tax that activity. That makes sense because the tax is on the activity happening locally, so it's a valid local tax.

Option G says it's unconstitutional because it burdens out-of-state businesses. If the tax applies equally but has a disproportionate effect, that might be a problem. But if it's applied to all itinerant drawers regardless of origin, maybe it's not discriminatory.

Option H suggests it's unconstitutional because municipalities can't impose a license tax on orders fulfilled out-of-state. Wait, the tax is on the activity in the city—the drawing. The order is taken in the city, and the drawing happens there. The rest is done elsewhere, but the taxable event is the drawing, which is local. So H might not be the right reason.

Option I claims it's unconstitutional due to double taxation. Since there's a credit if the studio tax is paid, it's avoiding double taxation. If the artist's employer has a studio in the city, they can get a credit, so the tax is structured to prevent double taxation. So I doesn't seem to apply here.

Now, putting it all together. The tax is on the itinerant artists for using the streets. The city can tax activities conducted within their jurisdiction. The fact that the artists are from out-of-state doesn't make the tax unconstitutional if it's applied evenhandedly. The credit is allowed if they have a studio in the city, which might mean that local studios and their artists don't have to pay both taxes. But the gallery's artists don't have a studio in the city, so they can't claim the credit, which means they pay the full $100. But the tax isn't higher for out-of-state; it's just that they can't get the credit. Is that a discrimination?

Wait, the tax is the same for everyone, but the credit is only available to those who pay the studio tax. So the effect is that out-of-state businesses, which don't have studios in the city, end up paying more in total taxes compared to local businesses that might have both. So it's a discriminatory effect because it burdens out-of-state commerce more than local.

That would make the tax unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause as a discriminatory tax. So option B would be the choice.

Alternatively, if the tax is on the activity regardless of where the business is from, it's permissible. But the credit introduces discrimination because it's only available to those with a local studio. So the tax isn't neutral—it favors local businesses by giving them a credit, thus effectively taxing out-of-state higher.

So I think the correct answer is B: unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a $100 annual excise tax imposed by a city on itinerant commercial figure drawers. The tax is challenged by an out-of-state gallery whose artists operate in the city but do not maintain a studio there. The city allows a credit against this tax for any excise tax paid on maintaining a studio in the city, which benefits local businesses but not out-of-state ones. The analysis focuses on whether the tax violates constitutional principles, particularly the Commerce Clause and equal protection.

The tax applies to all itinerant drawers, regardless of origin, but the credit creates a discriminatory effect. Out-of-state businesses, like the gallery, cannot claim the credit because they lack a studio in the city, resulting in a higher overall tax burden compared to local businesses. This disparity violates the Commerce Clause by unfairly burdening interstate commerce. The tax is not a valid usage fee or a neutral tax on local activity, as the credit introduces discrimination. Equal protection is not the primary issue here, as the tax does not explicitly target out-of-state businesses but rather creates a disproportionate impact through the credit mechanism.

The correct conclusion is that the tax is unconstitutional because it operates as a discriminatory privilege tax, favoring local businesses over out-of-state ones.

Answer: B
