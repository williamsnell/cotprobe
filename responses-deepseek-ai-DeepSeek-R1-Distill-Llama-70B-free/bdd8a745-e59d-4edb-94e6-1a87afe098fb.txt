Okay, so I've got this investment question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that there's an investment that will generate income growing at 5% per annum forever. The market discount rate is 15%. The next payout is $10, and I need to find the value of the investment.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with investments that generate perpetual cash flows, we can use the concept of the present value of a growing perpetuity. Oh right, that's like the Gordon Growth Model or something similar.

So, the formula for the present value (PV) of a growing perpetuity is:

PV = (Next Cash Flow) / (Discount Rate - Growth Rate)

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. The next payout is $10, which is the first cash flow we expect to receive. Since it's a perpetuity, it's going to grow forever at a rate of 5% each year. The discount rate is given as 15%.

So substituting the numbers into the formula, I think it would be:

PV = 10 / (0.15 - 0.05)

Because the discount rate is 15% or 0.15, and the growth rate is 5% or 0.05. Subtracting those gives 0.10.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate the denominator first. 0.15 minus 0.05 is 0.10. So then the PV is 10 divided by 0.10, which is 100.

Looking at the options, option I is $100. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula to make sure I'm not mixing anything up. The formula is correct for a growing perpetuity where the cash flows start in period 1 (next year) and grow at a constant rate. So yes, using the next payout as the numerator, and subtracting the growth rate from the discount rate in the denominator makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each year's cash flow being 10*(1.05)^n, where n starts at 0. Oh wait, no, because the next payout is in one year, so it's 10 in year 1, 10.5 in year 2, and so on.

So the present value would be the sum from t=1 to infinity of (10*(1.05)^(t-1)))/(1.15)^t. Hmm, let's see.

Alternatively, factor out the 10 and rewrite it as 10 * sum from t=1 to infinity of (1.05)^t / (1.15)^t.

Wait, (1.05/1.15)^t is the same as (1.05/1.15)^t = (21/23)^t, but perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, the sum becomes a geometric series where each term is (1.05/1.15) multiplied by the previous term. The sum of such a series from t=0 to infinity is 1/(1 - (1.05/1.15)) ), but since our sum starts at t=1, it would be (1.05/1.15) * [1/(1 - (1.05/1.15)))].

Wait, let me calculate that. The sum S = (1.05/1.15) + (1.05/1.15)^2 + ... to infinity. The sum is (first term) / (1 - common ratio). So first term a = (1.05/1.15), common ratio r = (1.05/1.15). So S = a/(1 - r) = (1.05/1.15) / (1 - 1.05/1.15).

Let me compute 1 - 1.05/1.15. Well, 1.05/1.15 is 21/23, so 1 - 21/23 is 2/23. So S = (21/23) / (2/23) ) = (21/23) * (23/2) ) = 21/2 = 10.5.

Wait, so the sum S from t=1 to infinity of (1.05/1.15)^t is 10.5. Then, the present value is 10 * 10.5 / 1.05? Wait, no, because the initial term is 10 in the numerator. Wait, perhaps I should re-express it.

Wait, the initial formula I used, PV = 10 / (0.15 - 0.05) = 100, that seems correct. But when I tried the summation approach, I got a different result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. The cash flows are 10 in year 1, 10*(1.05) in year 2, 10*(1.05)^2 in year 3, etc. So each cash flow at time t is 10*(1.05)^(t-1).

To find the present value, each cash flow is divided by (1.15)^t. So the PV is sum from t=1 to infinity of [10*(1.05)^(t-1)] / (1.15)^t.

Let me factor out the 10: 10 * sum [ (1.05)^(t-1) / (1.15)^t ].

This can be rewritten as 10 * (1/1.05) * sum [ (1.05)^t / (1.15)^t ] from t=1 to infinity.

Because (1.05)^(t-1) = (1.05)^t / 1.05.

So, 10*(1/1.05) * sum [ (1.05/1.15)^t ] from t=1 to inf.

Now, the sum is a geometric series with first term a = (1.05/1.15) and ratio r = (1.05/1.15). So the sum from t=1 to inf is a/(1 - r).

So, sum = (1.05/1.15) / (1 - 1.05/1.15) ) = (1.05/1.15) / ( (1.15 - 1.05)/1.15 ) ) = (1.05/1.15) * (1.15 / 0.10 ) = (1.05) / 0.10 = 10.5.

So, putting it all together: PV = 10 * (1/1.05) * 10.5.

Wait, 10 * (1/1.05) is approximately 9.5238, and 9.5238 *10.5 is about 100. So the present value is $100.

Hmm, so both methods give me the same answer, which is $100. So option I is correct.

I think I must have made a mistake in the earlier summation approach, but upon recalculating, it aligns with the formula. So I'm confident now that the answer is I, $100.

The question involves calculating the value of an investment that generates a perpetuity with cash flows growing at 5% per annum, using a market discount rate of 15%. The next payout is $10. To solve this, the formula for the present value (PV) of a growing perpetuity is applied:

\[
PV = \frac{\text{Next Cash Flow}}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Growth Rate}}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- Next Cash Flow = $10
- Discount Rate = 15% or 0.15
- Growth Rate = 5% or 0.05

\[
PV = \frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} = \frac{10}{0.10} = 100
\]

Thus, the value of the investment is $100. This result is consistent with both the direct formula application and a detailed summation approach confirming the calculation.

The correct answer is:

I: $100
