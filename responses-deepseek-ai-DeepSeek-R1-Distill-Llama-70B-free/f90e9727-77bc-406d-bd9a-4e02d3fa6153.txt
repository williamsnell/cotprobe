Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the relative abundance of two isotopes of an element. Let's see what I remember about this.

The element X has an atomic weight of 210.197 amu. There are two isotopes: ^210X and ^212X. Their masses are 209.64 and 211.66 amu respectively. I need to find the percentage abundance of each.

Hmm, right. I think the method involves setting up an equation based on the weighted average of the isotopic masses. So the average atomic mass is the sum of each isotope's mass multiplied by its abundance.

Let me denote the abundance of ^210X as x, and ^212X as y. Since there are only two isotopes, x + y = 1. Or, in percentage terms, x + y = 100%.

The atomic weight is given by (mass of first isotope * x) + (mass of second isotope * y) = average atomic weight.

So plugging in the numbers: 209.64x + 211.66y = 210.197.

Wait, but since x + y = 1, I can substitute y with (1 - x). That should make it easier.

So substituting: 209.64x + 211.66(1 - x) = 210.197.

Let me expand this equation. 209.64x + 211.66 - 211.66x = 210.197.

Combine like terms: (209.64 - 211.66)x + 211.66 = 210.197.

Calculating 209.64 - 211.66 gives me -2.02. So the equation becomes -2.02x + 211.66 = 210.197.

Next, I'll subtract 211.66 from both sides: -2.02x = 210.197 - 211.66.

Calculating the right side: 210.197 - 211.66 is -1.463.

So now, -2.02x = -1.463. Dividing both sides by -2.02 gives x = (-1.463)/(-2.02) = 0.7242 approximately.

So x is about 72.42%. Then y is 100% - 72.42% = 27.58%. Looking at the options, option C is 72.42% and 27.587%, which matches my calculation.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The setup: correct. Substituted y correctly. Did the arithmetic right: 210.197 -211.66 is indeed negative. Then 1.463 divided by 2.02 is about 0.7242. Yep, that looks right.

To determine the relative abundance of the two isotopes of element X, we start by noting that the atomic weight of X is 210.197 amu, and the isotopes ^210X and ^212X have masses of 209.64 amu and 211.66 amu, respectively. Let the abundance of ^210X be \( x \) (as a decimal) and the abundance of ^212X be \( y \). Since the total abundance must sum to 1, we have:

\[
x + y = 1
\]

The atomic weight is the weighted average of the isotopic masses:

\[
209.64x + 211.66y = 210.197
\]

Substituting \( y = 1 - x \) into the equation:

\[
209.64x + 211.66(1 - x) = 210.197
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
209.64x + 211.66 - 211.66x = 210.197
\]

\[
(209.64 - 211.66)x + 211.66 = 210.197
\]

\[
-2.02x + 211.66 = 210.197
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
-2.02x = 210.197 - 211.66
\]

\[
-2.02x = -1.463
\]

\[
x = \frac{-1.463}{-2.02} \approx 0.7242
\]

Thus, the abundance of ^210X is approximately 72.42%, and the abundance of ^212X is:

\[
y = 1 - x = 1 - 0.7242 = 0.2758 \, \text{or} \, 27.58\%.
\]

Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 72.42%, 27.587%**
