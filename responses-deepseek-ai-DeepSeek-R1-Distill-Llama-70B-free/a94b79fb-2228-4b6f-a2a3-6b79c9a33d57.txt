Question:

It's silly to pass laws against discrimination, since it is obvious that we can't live without it. We discriminate between pleasant and unpleasant tastes in selecting our food, between pleasant and unpleasant sounds in selecting our music, between harmonious and unharmonious colors in decorating our homes, between interesting and uninteresting people in choosing our friends, and so on. We can't live without discriminating.

Options:

A: Prejudicial Language
B: Equivocation
C: Inconsistency
D: Straw Man

Okay, so I have this question here about a logical fallacy. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The question presents a statement that says it's silly to pass laws against discrimination because we can't live without it, giving examples like choosing food, music, colors, and friends based on preferences. Then, it asks which logical fallacy this is from the options A to D.

First, I need to understand what each of the options means because I'm a bit fuzzy on some of these terms. Let me list them out again:

A: Prejudicial Language
B: Equivocation
C: Inconsistency
D: Straw Man

I remember that a logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that undermines the logic of an argument. So the statement in the question is making an argument against anti-discrimination laws by saying that discrimination is necessary and everywhere.

The argument uses examples like taste in food, music, etc., which are all about personal preferences. But when we talk about laws against discrimination, we're usually referring to unfair treatment based on race, gender, religion, etc., not about personal choices like food or friends.

So the speaker is using the term "discrimination" in two different ways. In one sense, it's about making distinctions based on preference, like choosing friends. In another, it's about unfair treatment, like racial discrimination. This seems like they're using the same word with different meanings to confuse the issue. That sounds like equivocation to me.

Let me make sure. Equivocation is when a word is used with two or more meanings in the same argument, leading to misleading conclusions. So in this case, the argument is conflating legitimate discrimination (like choosing food) with the kind of discrimination that's harmful and illegal. By doing so, they're implying that since some discrimination is necessary, all discrimination should be allowed, which isn't true.

Looking at the other options: Prejudicial Language refers to using language that biases or discriminates, but the issue here isn't the language being biased, it's about using the same term in different ways. Inconsistency would be if the argument contradicts itself, but that's not exactly the case here. Straw Man is when someone misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack, which isn't what's happening here.

So putting it all together, the argument uses "discrimination" in two different senses, which is an equivocation fallacy. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: Equivocation.

The argument presented in the question uses the term "discrimination" in two different ways: one referring to personal preferences (like choosing food or friends) and the other to unfair treatment based on characteristics like race or gender. This is an example of equivocation, a logical fallacy where a word is used with multiple meanings to mislead or confuse the audience. The other options do not fit as well: prejudicial language involves biased terms, inconsistency refers to contradictions, and a straw man misrepresents an argument. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: Equivocation

Answer: B
