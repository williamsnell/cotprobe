Okay, so I have this economics question here about international trade, specifically about the United States trading salmon to Peru in exchange for anchovies. The question is asking what must be the case if they're trading based on relative opportunity costs. Hmm, I think relative opportunity costs relate to comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. Right, because comparative advantage is about what you produce at a lower opportunity cost compared to others.

Wait, the question says the US is exporting salmon and importing anchovies. So the US must be better at producing salmon relative to Peru, and Peru must be better at producing anchovies relative to the US. So each country specializes in what they have a comparative advantage in.

Let me think about the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Both have comparative advantage in salmon. That can't be right because if both were better at salmon, then why would Peru export anchovies? The US would export salmon, but Peru wouldn't have an incentive to export anchovies unless they have a comparative advantage there.

Option B: US has absolute advantage in both. Absolute advantage is different. Comparative advantage is about opportunity costs. But the question is about relative opportunity costs, so it's about comparative advantage, not absolute. So B might not be the right answer unless it's a trick, but I don't think so.

Option C: Both have comparative advantage in anchovies. That doesn't make sense because the US is exporting salmon, so they must have the advantage there, not anchovies.

Option D: US has comparative advantage in both. But if US is better at both, then Peru wouldn't export anything because they can't produce either better. But in the scenario, Peru is exporting anchovies, so they must have the comparative advantage there.

Option E: US has CA in salmon, Peru in anchovies. That fits. Because the US would export salmon (their CA) and import anchovies (Peru's CA). That makes sense.

Option F: Peru has CA in both. Then the US wouldn't be exporting anything because Peru is better at both. So this doesn't fit.

Option G: Absolute advantage in one each. But the question is about relative (comparative) advantage, so G might not be right unless the answer is about absolute, but I don't think so.

Option H: Peru has absolute advantage in both. Again, same issue as B; the question is about relative.

Option I: US has absolute advantage in salmon, Peru in anchovy. But again, the question is about relative opportunity costs, so it's about comparative, not absolute. Unless the answer is E, which is about comparative.

Option J: US has CA in anchovy, Peru in salmon. That's the opposite of what's happening because the US is exporting salmon, so they should have CA there, not anchovies. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be E. The US has comparative advantage in salmon, and Peru in anchovies.

The question involves the United States trading salmon to Peru in exchange for anchovies, with the trade based on relative opportunity costs. This implies that the countries are specializing according to their comparative advantages. The United States is exporting salmon, suggesting it has a comparative advantage in salmon production, while Peru is exporting anchovies, indicating Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovy production.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as both countries cannot have a comparative advantage in salmon.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the question focuses on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as Peru is exporting anchovies, implying a comparative advantage there, not in salmon.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as Peru is exporting anchovies, so it must have a comparative advantage in that area.
- **Option E**: Correct, as it aligns with the trade pattern: the U.S. has a comparative advantage in salmon, and Peru in anchovies.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as the U.S. is exporting salmon, so Peru cannot have a comparative advantage in both.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as the question is about comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as it refers to absolute advantage, which is not the focus.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it refers to absolute advantage rather than comparative advantage.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as it reverses the comparative advantages implied by the trade.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: The United States has comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has comparative advantage in anchovy production.**
