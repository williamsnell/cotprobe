Question:

The temperature dropped 11°F between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M. It was 84°F at 10 P.M. Write and solve an equation to find t the temperature at 6 P.M.

Options:

A: 84 − t = 11; 73°F
B: 84 − 11 = t; 73°F
C: t + 11 = 84; 73°F
D: t + 84 = 11; -73°F
E: t - 84 = 11; -73°F
F: 11 - t = 84; -73°F
G: 84 - t = 11; 11°F
H: t − 11 = 84; 95°F

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this temperature problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The temperature dropped 11°F between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M., and it was 84°F at 10 P.M. I need to find the temperature at 6 P.M. Hmm.

Alright, so the temperature went down by 11 degrees. That means it was higher at 6 P.M. than at 10 P.M. So if I let t be the temperature at 6 P.M., then at 10 P.M., it's t minus 11. Because it dropped 11 degrees, right?

Wait, but the problem says it was 84°F at 10 P.M. So that would mean t minus 11 equals 84. So the equation should be t - 11 = 84. Does that make sense? Let me think again. Starting from 6 P.M. as t, then after dropping 11, it's 84. So yes, t - 11 = 84.

To solve for t, I would add 11 to both sides. So t = 84 + 11, which is 95°F. That seems right. So the temperature at 6 P.M. was 95°F.

Looking at the options provided:

Option H says t - 11 = 84; 95°F. That matches exactly what I did. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, let me check the other options quickly to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Option B is 84 - 11 = t, which is 73°F. That would be correct if the temperature at 6 P.M. was lower than 10 P.M., which doesn't fit because the temperature dropped. So B is wrong.

Option A is 84 - t = 11, which would mean t is 73, but that's the same issue as B. So H is definitely the right choice.

To determine the temperature at 6 P.M., let \( t \) represent the temperature at 6 P.M. The temperature dropped by 11°F by 10 P.M., when it was 84°F. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
t - 11 = 84
\]

Solving for \( t \), add 11 to both sides:

\[
t = 84 + 11 = 95
\]

Thus, the temperature at 6 P.M. was 95°F. Among the given options, the equation \( t - 11 = 84 \) and the solution 95°F correspond to **Option H**.

Answer: H
