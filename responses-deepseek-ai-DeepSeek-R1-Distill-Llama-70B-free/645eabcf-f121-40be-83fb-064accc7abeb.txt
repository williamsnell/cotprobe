Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about economic activities, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the options are NOT secondary economic activities. Hmm, I remember that economic activities are categorized into primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors.

Primary activities are related to extracting raw materials directly from nature, like mining, farming, fishing, etc. Secondary activities involve processing these raw materials into finished goods. That would include manufacturing, construction, and assembly lines. Tertiary is more about services, like retail, hospitality, education, etc.

Looking at the options:

A: Sewing shirts. That's making clothes, so manufacturing. So that's secondary.

B: Assembling automotive parts. That's like putting together cars or parts, definitely manufacturing. Secondary.

C: Building houses. Construction, which is part of secondary because you're turning materials into a house.

D: Mining copper. Oh, mining is extracting raw materials, so that's primary. So this would be the one that's not secondary.

E: Brewing beer. Processing raw materials (like barley, hops) into beer, so secondary.

F: Manufacturing furniture. Definitely secondary.

G: Processing food. Like canning or packaging; secondary.

H: Binding books. That's taking paper and making books, so manufacturing. Secondary.

So the question is which is NOT secondary. The options are all except D, which is primary. So the answer should be D.

The question asks which activity is NOT a secondary economic activity. Secondary activities involve processing raw materials into finished goods. Mining copper (D) is a primary activity, as it involves extracting raw materials. All other options are secondary.

Answer: D
