Okay, so I have this problem about a shunt generator's efficiency, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The generator is 110 volts, and it's a shunt type. The armature and brush resistance together are 0.06 ohms at full load, which is 85 amperes. The shunt field resistance is 45 ohms. There are also stray power losses of 897 watts. I need to find the full-load efficiency.

Hmm, right. Efficiency of a generator is the ratio of the output power to the input power, expressed as a percentage. So, efficiency η = (output power / input power) * 100%.

First, I think I need to find both the output power and the input power.

Output power is what's being delivered to the load. Since the voltage is 110 V and the current is 85 A, output power (P_out) should be V * I. So P_out = 110 V * 85 A = 9350 watts. Wait, but I should double-check that. Oh wait, no, wait. Because in a generator, especially a shunt one, the current is split between the shunt field and the load.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Because in a shunt generator, the field current is separate from the load current. Oh wait, no, the shunt field resistance is in parallel with the armature. So the total current from the armature is the sum of the field current and the load current.

Wait, but the problem says the full load is 85 amperes. I think that refers to the load current. So the total armature current would be the load current plus the shunt field current.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The shunt field is connected across the armature, so the field current (I_sh) is I_sh = V / R_sh. Since the generator is rated at 110 volts, that's the voltage across the shunt field. So I_sh = 110 V / 45 ohms = let's calculate that. 110 /45 is approximately 2.444... Amperes.

So the field current is about 2.444 A. Now, the full load current is 85 A. But wait, is that the load current or the armature current? Hmm. In a shunt generator, the armature current is the sum of the load current and the shunt field current. Because the shunt is in parallel with the load.

So if the load current is I_L, then the armature current I_a = I_L + I_sh. But wait, the problem says the full load is 85 amperes. Is that the armature current or the load current? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the way the question is phrased: "full load of 85 amperes." Since generators usually have their ratings given in terms of the load current, I think 85 A is the load current. So then the armature current would be 85 + 2.444 = 87.444 A. Let me note that.

But wait, the armature resistance is given as 0.06 ohms. So the armature's voltage drop is I_a * R_a. Let me calculate that.

I_a is 87.444 A. So the voltage drop is 87.444 * 0.06 = approx 5.2466 volts. So the generated voltage (E) would be the terminal voltage plus this drop. Because the terminal voltage is across the load, so E = V + I_a * R_a. So E = 110 + 5.2466 ≈ 115.2466 volts. But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary for calculating efficiency. Maybe not. Let me think.

Efficiency is (output power)/(input power). Output power is the power delivered to the load, which is V * I_L = 110 V * 85 A = 9350 W.

Input power is the power supplied to the generator. Which includes the output power plus all the losses. So the losses include:

1. Armature copper losses: I_a^2 * R_a
2. Shunt field copper losses: I_sh^2 * R_sh
3. Stray losses: given as 897 W.

So the total losses (P_loss) = (I_a^2 * R_a) + (I_sh^2 * R_sh) + stray losses.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, I_a is approx 87.444 A. So I_a squared is (87.444)^2 ≈ let's see, 87^2 is 7569, 0.444^2 is about 0.197, and the cross term is 2*87*0.444 ≈ 77. So approx 87.444^2 ≈ 7644. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, better to compute it precisely. 87.444 A:

I_a = 85 + (110/45) = 85 + 2.4444 = 87.4444 A.

I_a^2 = (87.4444)^2. Let's compute 87^2 = 7569. 0.4444^2 ≈ 0.1975. The cross term is 2*87*0.4444 ≈ 2*87*0.4444. 87*0.4444 is about 38.6668. Multiply by 2: 77.3336. So total I_a^2 ≈ 7569 +77.3336 +0.1975 ≈ 7646.5311.

But perhaps a calculator approach is better, but since I can't use one, I'll proceed with approximate.

Alternatively, 87.4444 squared:

= (80 +7.4444)^2 = 80^2 + 2*80*7.4444 + (7.4444)^2.

80^2=6400.

2*80*7.4444 = 160 *7.4444 ≈ 1191.104.

7.4444^2 ≈ 55.413.

So total is 6400 + 1191.104 = 7591.104 +55.413≈ 7646.517.

So approximately 7646.52 (W^2).

Multiply by R_a of 0.06 ohms: 7646.52 * 0.06 ≈ 458.79 W.

Next, shunt field copper loss: I_sh^2 * R_sh.

I_sh is 110/45 = 2.4444 A.

(2.4444)^2 = approx 5.975. Multiply by R_sh=45: 5.975 *45 ≈ 268.875 W.

Stray losses are given as 897 W.

So total losses P_loss = 458.79 + 268.875 + 897.

Let me add them up.

458.79 + 268.875 = 727.665. Adding 897 gives 727.665 +897 = 1624.665 W.

Now, the output power is 9350 W, and the input power is output + losses: 9350 + 1624.665 = 10974.665 W.

Efficiency η = (9350 / 10974.665) * 100%.

Let me calculate 9350 / 10974.665.

Well, approximately, 10974.665 is about 10,975. Let's compute 9350 /10975.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 9350/25=374, 10975/25=439.

So 374 /439 ≈ 0.852. Let's check 439 * 0.85 = 373.15. So 0.85 would be 373.15, which is close to 374. So 374/439 ≈ 0.8526.

So approximately 85.26% efficiency.

Wait, but wait. Let me do it more accurately. Let me compute 9350 /10974.665.

10974.665 = 9350 + 1624.665.

Let me write 9350 /10974.665 = 1 / (1 + (1624.665/9350)).

Compute 1624.665 /9350.

Well, 9350 * 0.1736 ≈ let's see: 9350 *0.17= 1590.5. 9350 *0.1736= ?

Wait, 1624.665 /9350 = approx 0.1736 (since 0.17 *9350= 1590.5, 0.1736*9350= 1624 approx).

So 1/(1+0.1736) = 1/1.1736 ≈ 0.8526.

So 0.8526 *100% is 85.26%. Looking at the options, F is 85.2 percent. That's very close.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate more accurately. Let's do 9350 divided by 10974.665.

10974.665 = 10974.665.

So 9350 ÷ 10974.665 ≈ 0.8526.

So η ≈ 85.26%, which would be approximately 85.3%. The closest option is F:85.2 percent.

Wait, but wait, let me check my steps again. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait, the input power. Oh wait, no, the input power is the sum of the output and the losses. Because the generator's input is the mechanical power provided, which is converted to electrical plus losses. So yes, output is 9350 W, losses 1624.665 W, so input is 9350+1624.665=10974.665 W.

Yes, that's correct. So 9350 / 10974.665 is indeed the efficiency.

So the answer should be approximately 85.2%, which is option F.

Wait, but let me double-check the loss calculations again.

Armature copper loss: I_a squared times R_a. I_a is 87.4444, so squared is 7646.52. R_a is 0.06, so 7646.52 * 0.06 = 458.79 W. That seems correct.

Shunt field loss: (110/45)^2 * 45 = (110^2)/45. Because (I_sh)^2 * R_sh = (V^2/R_sh^2)* R_sh = V^2 / R_sh. So 110^2 /45 = 12100 /45 ≈ 268.888 W. So that's correct.

Stray losses: 897 W.

Total losses: 458.79 +268.888 +897 = let me add 458.79 +268.888 first. 458.79 +200=658.79, plus 68.888 is 727.678. Adding 897 gives 1624.678 W. So that's correct.

Then output is 9350 W, input 10974.678 W.

So 9350 / 10974.678 = approx 0.8526 → 85.26% efficiency. So closest to 85.2% which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the full load current is incorrect. Wait, the problem says "full load of 85 amperes." Now, in generators, sometimes the full load current refers to the armature current, not the load current. Oh, that could change everything.

Wait, important point. So perhaps the 85 A is the armature current, which would make I_L = I_a - I_sh.

In that case, I_a is 85 A, so I_L = 85 - (110/45) = 85 - 2.4444 = 82.5556 A.

Then output power would be V * I_L = 110 *82.5556 ≈ 9081.11 W.

Let me recalculate the losses in this scenario.

So I_a is 85 A.

Armature copper loss: 85^2 *0.06 = 7225 *0.06=434.5 W.

Shunt field loss: (110/45)^2 *45 = (2.4444)^2 *45 ≈ 5.975 *45 ≈ 268.875 W.

Stray losses: 897 W.

Total losses: 434.5 +268.875 +897 = 434.5+268.875=703.375 +897=1600.375 W.

Output power is 110 *82.5556≈ 9081.11 W.

Input power: 9081.11 +1600.375≈10681.485 W.

Efficiency: 9081.11 /10681.485 → let's compute that.

9081.11 /10681.485 ≈ approx 0.85 → 85% efficiency.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

0.85 *10681.485 = 9080. So 9081.11 is almost exactly 0.85 of 10681.485. So the efficiency would be 85%.

Looking at the options, I don't see an option E as 85.2, but wait, the options are A:80, B:78.4, C:95.7, D:82.3, E:69.8, F:85.2, G:87.9, H:92.5, I:75, J:90.

So if the efficiency is 85%, the closest option would be F:85.2%. But wait, in this scenario, the calculation gives exactly 85% (since 9081.11 is 85% of 10681.48). So why isn't 85% an option? The options don't have 85%, but option F is 85.2. Hmm. So perhaps the initial assumption about the full load current is the armature current.

Wait, but the problem states: "full load of 85 amperes." In the context of generators, when they say "full load current," they usually mean the load current, not the armature current. Because the armature current includes the shunt field current. So perhaps the correct approach is the first calculation, where I_L=85 A, leading to I_a=87.444 A, and efficiency approx 85.26%, which is option F.

But wait, let me think again. If the 85 A is the armature current, then the load current is 82.555 A, leading to output 9081 W and efficiency 85%. But the options don't have 85%, but do have 85.2% as option F.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recheck.

In the first scenario, where I_L=85 A, I_a=87.444 A.

Output P_out=110 *85=9350 W.

Losses:

Armature loss: (87.444)^2 *0.06≈ 7646.5 *0.06≈458.79 W.

Shunt loss: (110/45)^2 *45= (2.444)^2 *45≈5.975 *45=268.875 W.

Stray loss: 897 W.

Total loss: 458.79+268.875+897≈1624.665 W.

Input P_in=9350 +1624.665=10974.665 W.

Efficiency=9350/10974.665= approx 0.8526 →85.26%, which is option F:85.2%.

But if 85 A is the armature current, then:

I_a=85 A.

I_L=85 - 2.4444=82.5556 A.

P_out=110 *82.5556≈9081.11 W.

Losses:

Armature:85^2 *0.06=7225 *0.06=434.5 W.

Shunt: 268.875 W.

Stray:897 W.

Total loss:434.5+268.875+897=1600.375 W.

Input:9081.11 +1600.375=10681.485 W.

Efficiency:9081.11/10681.485= approx 0.85 exactly.

So that would be 85% efficiency, but the options don't have that. The closest is F:85.2. So perhaps the correct answer is F in the first case, but in the second case, we get 85% which isn't an option. So it's more likely that 85 A is the load current, leading to 85.26% efficiency, matching option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in one of the loss calculations.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 'stray power losses' are already included in the losses, but I think I accounted for all correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the shunt field current when the armature current is 85 A. Wait no, the shunt field is across the armature, so its current depends on the terminal voltage, which is 110 V regardless of load. So I_sh is fixed at 110/45=2.444 A regardless of the load current.

So the correct approach is to determine whether the 85 A is the load current or the armature current.

In the problem statement, it's written as "full load of 85 amperes." Generally, the full-load current refers to the load current unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the first calculation is correct, leading to 85.26% efficiency, which is option F:85.2 percent.
</think>

To calculate the full-load efficiency of the 110-volt shunt generator, we use the formula:

\[
\eta = \left( \frac{\text{Output Power}}{\text{Input Power}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

### Step 1: Output Power
The output power is the power delivered to the load. Since the generator is rated for 110 V and the full-load current is given as 85 A, the output power is:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = V \cdot I_L = 110 \cdot 85 = 9350 \, \text{W}
\]

### Step 2: Losses
The total losses include:
1. **Armature copper losses**: \( I_a^2 \cdot R_a \), where \( I_a \) is the total armature current.
2. **Shunt field copper losses**: \( I_{\text{sh}}^2 \cdot R_{\text{sh}} \), where \( I_{\text{sh}} = \frac{V}{R_{\text{sh}}} \).
3. **Stray power losses**: Given as 897 W.

#### Step 2.1: Calculate Armature Current
The armature current \( I_a \) is the sum of the load current \( I_L \) and the shunt field current \( I_{\text{sh}} \).
