Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically asking which option is an example of capital as an economic resource. Hmm, I remember that in economics, the factors of production are land, labor, and capital. Capital isn't just money; it's more about man-made resources used in production.

Let me look at each option:

A: A barrel of crude oil. Wait, crude oil is a natural resource, right? So that's land, not capital. Because land includes all natural resources that aren't created by humans.

B: A music concert ticket. That's a service, I think. You buy it for personal use, not for producing something else. So maybe it's a consumer good, not capital.

C: A valuable painting. Paintings can be investments, but I think they're more like consumer goods unless they're used in a business context. Maybe if it's part of a gallery's assets, but on its own, it's more of a durable good.

D: An apartment for rent. Oh, wait, that's a capital good. Because the apartment is being used to generate income through rent. So it's a building used in the production or provision of a service, making it capital.

E: A bushel of wheat. Wheat is a raw material, so that's a natural resource, part of land. Unless it's used as part of a production process, but I think it's more of an intermediate good, not capital.

F: A pot of homemade soup. That's just a consumer good; you make it to eat, not to produce something else.

G: A share of corporate stock. Hmm, stocks represent ownership in a company. So they are financial assets, but are they capital? I think in economics, capital refers to the physical or tangible goods used in production, not financial instruments. So maybe not.

H: A university degree. That's human capital. Oh wait, the question is about capital as an economic resource, which includes physical capital. Human capital is a different category, so maybe not what they're looking for here.

I: A cement mixer. That's a machine used in construction, so definitely a capital good. It's a man-made asset used in production.

J: A registered nurse. That's labor, the human resource providing services.

Wait, so the options that fit are D and I, and maybe H if considering human capital, but the question is about capital as an economic resource, which typically refers to physical capital.

So looking at the options, I is a cement mixer, which is clearly capital. D is an apartment for rent, which is capital because it's a building used to produce rental income. So both D and I could be correct. But wait, the question is asking for an example, so perhaps either could be correct, but maybe the answer expects one.

Wait, the options are D and I. Let me think again. The question is about which is an example of capital as an economic resource.

In economics, capital goods are man-made, durable items used in production. So a cement mixer (I) is definitely a capital good. An apartment for rent (D) is also capital because it's a structure used to generate income, part of the housing stock.

So which one is correct? The options are D and I.

Wait the options are all single choices, so maybe both D and I are correct, but the answer might have only one correct option. Let me check the question again.

The question says, which is an example of capital as an economic resource. So any of the options that are capital goods fit.

Looking through the options again, I think both D and I are correct. But I need to see which ones are in the options.

Wait, the options are A to J, each is a separate option. So perhaps in the answer choices, I and D are both correct, but I have to pick one.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me think: the term economic resource refers to the factors of production. So capital as a factor includes physical capital.

So, options I (cement mixer) and D (apartment for rent) are both capital.

But the answer choices are A-J, so I need to see which is the correct option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I, a cement mixer, because it's a tool used directly in production, like in construction. D is also capital, but maybe the question is looking for a more production-oriented example.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D because it's a building used to generate income through rent, which is a service.

Hmm, perhaps both are correct, but I have to pick the intended answer. Let me think about typical examples given in textbooks. For example, factories, machines, buildings are all capital. So a cement mixer is a machine, and an apartment building is a structure, both capital.

So the options I and D are correct. But perhaps the answer expects one of them.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

I: A cement mixer.

D: An apartment for rent.

So both are correct. But the question gives only one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, but maybe the answer is D, because it's a capital good used in providing a service. Alternatively, maybe the answer is I.

Wait, the initial question is about what is an example of capital as an economic resource. So I think both D and I qualify, but perhaps the intended answer is either I or D.

Wait, the options are presented as A to J, each as a separate choice. So perhaps the correct answer is I: a cement mixer.

Alternatively, another approach: the options include a share of corporate stock (G). Stock represents financial capital, but economic capital refers to physical items. So G is not correct.

So, among the options, I and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps both are intended, but wait the question says 'which of the following is an example', implying only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I or D. But I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, wait. The question is about 'capital as an economic resource', which is one of the factors of production. So, for example, a cement mixer is a tool used in production, making it capital. An apartment for rent is a capital good because it's used to produce housing services.

So both are correct. But since the options are multiple choice, perhaps only one is listed as correct, and the other is a distractor.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the most direct example. A cement mixer is a piece of machinery, which is a clear example of capital. So perhaps I is the intended answer.

Alternatively, an apartment for rent is real property, which is also capital. Hmm.

I think both are correct, but perhaps the answer expects one of them. I'm going to go with I: a cement mixer, because it's a tool directly used in production processes, which is a classic example of capital.

Wait, but the answer could be both, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: the term 'economic resource' could refer to the factors of production. So, labor (like the nurse), land (oil, wheat), and capital (cement mixer, apartment).

So the options that are capital would be I and D.

Since the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer, perhaps both are correct but the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because it's a building used for rental income, which is a service.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D because it's a capital good in the service sector, while I is in manufacturing.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick I as the answer because it's a machine, which is a more direct example of capital.

Wait, but the user is asking me to choose from the options, so perhaps I should look for the best fit.

Another thought: sometimes in economics, residential buildings are considered part of the housing stock, which is part of capital. So D would be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is I because it's a tool used in production, which is a more direct example of capital as a factor of production.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I think both I and D are correct. However, since the question is multiple-choice and the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is I: a cement mixer.

In economics, capital refers to man-made resources used in the production of goods and services. It is one of the factors of production, alongside land and labor. To determine which option represents capital, we analyze each choice:

- **A: A barrel of crude oil** - This is a natural resource, classified under "land," not capital.  
- **B: A music concert ticket** - This is a consumer good, not a capital resource.  
- **C: A valuable painting** - While it can appreciate in value, it is not typically used in production, so it is not capital.  
- **D: An apartment for rent** - This is a capital good because it is a man-made structure used to generate income through rental services.  
- **E: A bushel of wheat** - This is a raw material, part of land, not capital.  
- **F: A pot of homemade soup** - This is a consumer good, not capital.  
- **G: A share of corporate stock** - This is a financial asset, not physical capital.  
- **H: A university degree** - This represents human capital, not physical capital.  
- **I: A cement mixer** - This is a machine used in production, making it a clear example of physical capital.  
- **J: A registered nurse** - This is labor, not capital.  

Both **D: An apartment for rent** and **I: A cement mixer** qualify as capital. However, since the question asks for a single example, **I: A cement mixer** is the most direct and classic representation of capital as an economic resource, as it is a tool directly used in production processes.
