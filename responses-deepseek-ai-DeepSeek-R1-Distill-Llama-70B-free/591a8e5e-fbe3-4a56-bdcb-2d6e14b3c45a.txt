Okay, so I've got this problem here about activity coefficients in a solution. Hmm, I need to find an expression for the activity coefficient of the solvent, gamma_1, given that the solute's activity coefficient gamma_2 is e^(A X_2^2). Wait, wait, let me read the question again.

The problem says that gamma_2 is given by e^(A X_2^2). Oh wait, no, wait, the expression is e_2^(AX_2). Wait, no, the question says gamma_2 equals e^(AX_2 squared), right? Or is it e raised to A times X_2 squared? Because the way it's written is gamma_2 = e_2^(AX)2. Oh, maybe it's a typo and it's meant to be e^(A X_2²). So, gamma_2 = e^{A X_2^2}, I think that's right.

Now, I remember that in solutions, the activity coefficients of the solute and solvent are related through the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Oh right, the Gibbs-Duhem equation relates the changes in the chemical potentials, which in turn relate to the activity coefficients. So, for a binary solution (solvent 1 and solute 2), the equation is something like d(ln gamma_1) = (X_2 / X_1) d(ln gamma_2). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. The Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of activity coefficients for a binary system is:

X_1 d(ln gamma_1) + X_2 d(ln gamma_2) = 0

Yes, that's right. So you can express d(ln gamma_1) in terms of d(ln gamma_2) and vice versa.

Given that, since we have gamma_2 as a function of X_2, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to get ln gamma_2 = A X_2^2. Then, taking the derivative with respect to X_2, d(ln gamma_2)/dX_2 = 2 A X_2.

But wait, in the Gibbs-Duhem equation, the variables are in terms of the composition, so perhaps I should consider how X_1 and X_2 are related. Since it's a binary solution, X_1 + X_2 = 1, so X_1 = 1 - X_2.

Let me try to work it out step by step.

First, from the Gibbs-Duhem equation:

X_1 d(ln gamma_1) + X_2 d(ln gamma_2) = 0

We can rearrange this to find d(ln gamma_1):

d(ln gamma_1) = - (X_2 / X_1) d(ln gamma_2)

We know that ln gamma_2 = A X_2^2, so d(ln gamma_2) = 2 A X_2 dX_2.

Substituting into the expression:

d(ln gamma_1) = - (X_2 / X_1) * 2 A X_2 dX_2

Simplify that:

d(ln gamma_1) = -2 A (X_2^2 / X_1) dX_2

But since X_1 = 1 - X_2, we can substitute that in:

d(ln gamma_1) = -2 A (X_2^2 / (1 - X_2)) dX_2

Now, I need to integrate this expression to find ln gamma_1. The integration will be from some reference point, probably pure solvent where X_2 = 0, up to the current X_2.

So, ln gamma_1 = -2 A ∫ (X_2^2 / (1 - X_2)) dX_2, integrated from X_2 = 0 to X_2.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the integration limits. When X_2 approaches 0 (dilute solution), what happens to gamma_1? I think gamma_1 approaches 1 because in an ideal solution, the activity coefficient is 1. So the integration constant should be zero, I think.

But let me proceed.

So, the integral is:

∫ (X_2²) / (1 - X_2) dX_2

I can simplify the integrand. Let me perform polynomial division or factor the denominator.

Let me write X_2² / (1 - X_2) as:

Let me consider that 1 - X_2 is the denominator. So, X_2² can be written as (1 - (1 - X_2))². Hmm, maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the numerator as (1 - (1 - X_2))². Alternatively, I can perform substitution.

Alternatively, let me make a substitution u = 1 - X_2, then du = -dX_2. Wait, let's see:

Denominator is u, and numerator is (1 - u)^2. So,

∫ [ (1 - u)^2 / u ] (-du)

Expanding (1 - u)^2: 1 - 2u + u².

So,

Integral becomes:

- ∫ (1 - 2u + u²)/u du = - ∫ (1/u - 2 + u) du

Which is:

- [ ln u - 2u + (u²)/2 ] + C

Substituting back u = 1 - X_2:

= - [ ln(1 - X_2) - 2(1 - X_2) + ( (1 - X_2)^2 ) / 2 ] + C

Wait, but wait: Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in substitution. Let me go back.

Let me recompute the integral step.

The integral I have is ∫ [ X_2² / (1 - X_2) ] dX_2.

Let u = 1 - X_2 → X_2 = 1 - u → dX_2 = -du.

So when X_2 = a, u = 1 - a.

So substituting:

∫ [ ( (1 - u)^2 ) / u ] (-du) = - ∫ (1 - 2u + u²)/u du.

Which is:

- ∫ (1/u - 2 + u) du.

Integrate term by term:

∫1/u du = ln|u|

∫-2 du = -2u

∫u du = u²/2.

So the integral becomes:

- [ ln u - 2u + u²/2 ] + C

= - ln u + 2u - u²/2 + C.

Now substitute back u = 1 - X_2:

= - ln(1 - X_2) + 2(1 - X_2) - ( (1 - X_2)^2 ) / 2 + C.

Now, let's expand this:

= - ln(1 - X_2) + 2 - 2 X_2 - [ (1 - 2 X_2 + X_2²) ) / 2 ] + C.

Simplify the terms:

= - ln(1 - X_2) + 2 - 2 X_2 - (1/2) + X_2 - (X_2²)/2 + C.

Combine like terms:

2 - (1/2) = 3/2.

-2 X_2 + X_2 = - X_2.

So,

= - ln(1 - X_2) + 3/2 - X_2 - (X_2²)/2 + C.

Wait, but I think I might have made an error here. Wait, let me double-check. Let me recompute the expansion:

(1 - X_2)^2 = 1 - 2 X_2 + X_2².

So (1 - X_2)^2 / 2 = (1/2) - X_2 + (X_2²)/2.

So when we subtract that term:

- [ (1/2) - X_2 + (X_2²)/2 ] = -1/2 + X_2 - (X_2²)/2.

So putting it back into the expansion:

= - ln(1 - X_2) + 2(1 - X_2) - (1 - 2 X_2 + X_2²)/2 + C.

= - ln(1 - X_2) + 2 - 2 X_2 - (1/2) + X_2 - (X_2²)/2 + C.

So:

2 - 1/2 = 3/2.

-2 X_2 + X_2 = -X_2.

So,

= - ln(1 - X_2) + 3/2 - X_2 - (X_2²)/2 + C.

But wait, when X_2 approaches zero, the integral should approach zero because when X_2=0, the integral from 0 to 0 is zero.

So let me plug X_2 = 0 into the expression:

- ln(1 - 0) + 3/2 - 0 - 0 + C = -0 + 3/2 + C = 3/2 + C.

But when X_2=0, the integral is zero, so 3/2 + C = 0 → C = -3/2.

So the expression becomes:

- ln(1 - X_2) + 3/2 - X_2 - (X_2²)/2 - 3/2.

Simplify:

3/2 -3/2 = 0.

So,

= - ln(1 - X_2) - X_2 - (X_2²)/2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me double-check my substitution again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach the integral without substitution.

Let me try integrating X_2² / (1 - X_2) dX_2.

We can write X_2² as (1 - X_2 -1)^2? Hmm, perhaps another approach is to perform polynomial division. Since the numerator is of higher degree than the denominator, let's do that.

Divide X_2² by (1 - X_2):

X_2² ÷ (1 - X_2) = ?

Let me rewrite the denominator as (-X_2 + 1).

Dividing X_2² by (-X_2 + 1):

First term: X_2² / (-X_2) )= -X_2.

Multiply (-X_2 + 1) by (-X_2) → X_2² - X_2.

Subtract from X_2²:

(X_2²) - (X_2² - X_2) = X_2.

Now, bring down the next term, but since there's none, the remainder is X_2.

So we have:

X_2² / (1 - X_2) = -X_2 + (X_2)/(1 - X_2).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as:

X_2² / (1 - X_2) = -X_2 -1 + 1/(1 - X_2).

Wait, let me do it properly.

Let me write X_2² = (X_2² - X_2 + X_2) = X_2(X_2 -1) + X_2.

Hmm, maybe a better approach:

Let me express X_2² as (1 - X_2)(something) + remainder.

Let me let X_2² = (1 - X_2)(A X_2 + B) + C.

Expanding the right-hand side: (1)(A X_2 + B) - X_2 (A X_2 + B) + C → A X_2 + B - A X_2² - B X_2 + C.

Combine like terms:

- A X_2² + (A - B) X_2 + (B + C).

Set this equal to X_2², which is 1 X_2² + 0 X_2 + 0.

So:

- A X_2² + (A - B) X_2 + (B + C) = X_2².

Equate coefficients:

- A = 1 → A = -1.

A - B = 0 → (-1) - B = 0 → B = -1.

B + C = 0 → (-1) + C = 0 → C = 1.

So, X_2² = (1 - X_2)(-X_2 -1) + 1.

Thus,

X_2²/(1 - X_2) = (-X_2 -1) + 1/(1 - X_2).

So, the integral becomes ∫ [ -X_2 -1 + 1/(1 - X_2) ] dX_2.

Integrate term by term:

∫-X_2 dX_2 = - (X_2²)/2.

∫-1 dX_2 = -X_2.

∫1/(1 - X_2) dX_2 = -ln|1 - X_2|.

So the integral is:

- (X_2²)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) + C.

Wait, but earlier substitution gave me a different expression. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.

Wait, so according to this division, the integral is:

∫ X_2²/(1 - X_2) dX_2 = ∫ [ -X_2 -1 + 1/(1 - X_2) ] dX_2.

Which integrates to:

- (X_2²)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) + C.

But when I evaluated via substitution, I ended up with:

- ln(1 - X_2) - X_2 - X_2²/2 + (3/2 - 3/2) → same as this.

So yes, that seems correct.

So the integral is:

- (X_2²)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) + C.

Now, applying the limits from X_2=0 to X_2. At X_2=0:

- (0)^2/2 - 0 - ln(1) = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0, which is correct because the integral from 0 to 0 is zero. So the constant C is zero.

So the integral ∫ (X_2²)/(1 - X_2) dX_2 evaluated from 0 to X_2 is:

- (X_2²)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2).

Wait, no, wait, because when I did substitution earlier, I had a negative sign in front of the integral.

Wait, no, the integral I computed was ∫ (X_2²)/(1 - X_2) dX_2 from 0 to X_2 is equal to [ - (X_2^2)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) ] evaluated from 0 to X_2.

At X_2, it's [ - (X_2^2)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) ].

At 0, it's [0 -0 - ln(1)] = 0.

So the definite integral is [ - (X_2^2)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) ].

Wait, wait, but in the substitution approach, after substituting back, I had an expression that included negative signs. Let me make sure I'm getting the signs right.

Wait, the integral ∫ (X_2^2)/(1 - X_2) dX_2 from 0 to X_2 is:

[ - (X_2^2)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) ] - [0] = - (X_2^2)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2).

So, going back to the expression for d(ln gamma_1):

d(ln gamma_1) = -2 A (X_2^2 / X_1) dX_2.

And since X_1 = 1 - X_2, we substitute:

d(ln gamma_1) = -2 A (X_2^2 / (1 - X_2)) dX_2.

So, integrating from X_2=0 to X_2, we have:

ln gamma_1 = -2 A ∫ (X_2^2)/(1 - X_2) dX_2 from 0 to X_2.

Which equals:

-2 A [ - (X_2^2)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) ]

Simplify this:

= -2 A [ - (X_2²/2) - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) ]

Multiply through:

= -2 A * (-X_2²/2) - (-2 A)* X_2 - (-2 A)* ln(1 - X_2)

= (2 A * X_2²/2) + 2 A X_2 + 2 A ln(1 - X_2)

Simplify:

= A X_2² + 2 A X_2 + 2 A ln(1 - X_2)

Hmm, but wait, this seems a bit complicated. Let me check the signs again.

Wait, when I integrated, I got the integral as:

- (X_2^2)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2)

So when multiplied by -2 A:

ln gamma_1 = -2 A * [ integral ]

= -2 A [ - (X_2^2)/2 - X_2 - ln(1 - X_2) ]

So,

= (-2 A) * [ - (X_2^2)/2 ] + (-2 A) * (-X_2) + (-2 A) * (- ln(1 - X_2) )

= (2 A * X_2^2 / 2) + 2 A X_2 + 2 A ln(1 - X_2)

Simplify:

= A X_2^2 + 2 A X_2 + 2 A ln(1 - X_2)

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this expression. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says: 2A[ln X_1
