Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the sodium-D lines and calculating the energy of an electronic transition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem says that one of the sodium-D lines has a wavelength of 5890 Angstroms. I remember that an Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, right? So 5890 Angstroms would be 5890e-10 meters, which is 5.89e-7 meters. Wait, no, wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 5890 Angstroms is 5890 * 1e-10 m. Let me calculate that: 5.89e3 * 1e-10 = 5.89e-7 meters. Got it.

The question is to find the energy of the electronic transition. I think that's the energy difference between two energy levels in the sodium atom. The formula for the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, the units here. Let's see. Planck's constant h is given as 6.62e-27 erg-sec. Oh wait, erg is a unit of energy, and a sec is a second. The speed of light c is approximately 3e10 cm/s. Oh wait, but in meters, that's 3e8 m/s. Oh wait, but I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, the wavelength is in Angstroms, which is in meters when converted. So c is in m/s, h is in erg-sec. Let me check the units to make sure everything works out. Let's see:

E = hc/λ → erg.

Because h is erg*sec, c is m/s, λ is in meters. So when you multiply h*c, you get erg*sec * m/s → erg*m*sec/(m/s) → Wait, m/s is m per second. So (erg*sec) * (m/s) → erg*(sec)*(m/s) → erg*(m/s * s) → erg*m, because the s cancels. Then you divide by lambda in meters: erg*m / m → erg. So that works. So units are correct.

So let's plug in the numbers. h is 6.62e-27 erg*sec. c is 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 5.89e-7 m.

E = (6.62e-27 erg·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (5.89e-7 m)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply h and c: 6.62e-27 * 3e8 = ?

6.62 * 3 is 19.86. Then 1e-27 * 1e8 = 1e-19. So 19.86e-19. Which is 1.986e-18.

Then divide by lambda: (1.986e-18) / (5.89e-7) → Let me compute that.

So 1.986e-18 / 5.89e-7 = (1.986 /5.89) ) * 1e-11.

What's 1.986 divided by 5.89? Let me calculate that. 5.89 goes into 1.986 how many times. Well, 5.89 is about 6, so 1.986 /6 is approx 0.331. But let me do it more accurately.

5.89 × 0.337 is? Let me see: 5 × 0.337 is 1.685, 0.89 × 0.337 is approximately 0.299. Summing gives 1.685 + 0.299 = 1.984. Oh wow, that's very close to 1.986. So 0.337 approximately. So 0.337 * 1e-11 → 3.37e-12 erg.

Wait, but let me double-check the exact calculation. 1.986 /5.89. Let me compute it using a calculator approach.

Divide 1986 by 5890 (since 1.986e-18 /5.89e-7 is same as 1986 x1e-11 /5890 x1e-7? Wait, no. Wait, 1.986e-18 is 1986e-21, and 5.89e-7 is 5890e-10. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.986 /5.89 first.

So 1.986 ÷ 5.89. Let's see:

5.89 goes into 19 about 3 times (3*5.89=17.67). Subtract 17.67 from 19: 1.33. Bring down the 8: 13.3. 5.89 goes into 13.3 about 2 times (11.78). Subtract: 13.3-11.78=1.52. Bring down 6: 15.2. 5.89 goes into 15.2 about 2 times (11.78), subtract gives 3.42. So far, I have 0.322... Now, bring down a zero: 34.2. 5.89 goes into that 5 times (29.45) → 4.75 left. So it's approximately 0.3225.

Wait, this is getting a bit messy, but I think my initial approximation of 0.337 was perhaps a bit off. So 1.986 /5.89 is about 0.337?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.89 * 0.337 = ?

5.89 * 0.3 = 1.767.

5.89 * 0.03 = 0.1767.

5.89 * 0.007 = approx 0.04123.

Adding them up: 1.767 + 0.1767 = 1.9437. Plus 0.04123 → 1.9849. Oh, wow, that's exactly 1.9849, which is very close to 1.986. So 0.337 gives 1.9849, which is just a bit under 1.986. So perhaps 0.3372 would get closer, but for our purposes, 0.337 is accurate enough.

So the energy E is approximately 0.337e-11 erg? Wait no, the multiplication gives 1.986e-18 divided by 5.89e-7 → which is (1.986/5.89) * (1e-18 / 1e-7) → (0.337) * 1e-11 → 3.37e-12 erg.

Looking at the options, option F is 3.37e-12 erg.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

h =6.62e-27 erg·s

c=3e8 m/s

lambda=5890 Ang = 5890e-10 m =5.89e-7 m.

E= (6.62e-27 * 3e8) / (5.89e-7 )

Compute numerator: 6.62e-27 * 3e8 = 1.986e-18 erg·m

Denominator:5.89e-7 m.

So E= (1.986e-18) / 5.89e-7 = (1.986/5.89) )e(-18 +7) → 0.337e-11 → 3.37e-12 erg.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be F.

To calculate the energy of the electronic transition associated with the sodium-D line at a wavelength of 5890 Å, we use the formula for the energy of a photon:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.62 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 5890 \, \text{Å} = 5890 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 5.89 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Multiply \( h \) and \( c \)
\[
h \cdot c = (6.62 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (3.00 \times 10^8) = 1.986 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{erg·m}.
\]

### Step 2: Divide by \( \lambda \)
\[
E = \frac{1.986 \times 10^{-18}}{5.89 \times 10^{-7}} = (1.986 / 5.89) \times 10^{-11}.
\]

### Step 3: Simplify \( 1.986 / 5.89 \)
Performing the division:
\[
1.986 / 5.89 \approx 0.337.
\]

Thus:
\[
E = 0.337 \times 10^{-11} = 3.37 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The energy of the electronic transition is \( 3.37 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
