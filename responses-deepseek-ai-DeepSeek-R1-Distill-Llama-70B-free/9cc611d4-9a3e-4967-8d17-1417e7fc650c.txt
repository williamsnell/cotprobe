Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem: What is 3^(3^(3^3)) mod 100? Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

Let me start by understanding the expression. It's 3 raised to the power of (3 raised to the power of (3^3)). So, breaking it down, the innermost part is 3^3. 3^3 is 27, right? So now the expression becomes 3^(3^27) mod 100. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original is 3^(3^(3^3)). So 3^3 is 27, so it's 3^(3^27). Wait, that's a huge exponent. So I need to compute 3 raised to a power that's 3^27, and then take mod 100.

But 3^27 is a really big number. Calculating that directly isn't feasible. So I think I should find a way to simplify this using modular arithmetic properties, maybe Euler's theorem or something like that.

I remember that to compute a^b mod m, it's helpful to find the totient of m, especially when a and m are coprime. Since 3 and 100 are coprime (their GCD is 1), Euler's theorem applies here. Euler's theorem says that a^φ(m) ≡ 1 mod m, where φ(m) is Euler's totient function.

So φ(100) is the number of integers less than 100 that are coprime to 100. 100 is 2^2 * 5^2, so φ(100) = 100 * (1-1/2) * (1-1/5) = 100 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 40. So φ(100) is 40.

But wait, our exponent is 3^27, which is way larger than 40. So perhaps I can reduce the exponent modulo φ(100) to simplify.

But wait, Euler's theorem tells me that 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100. So 3^k mod 100 will repeat every 40 exponents. So to compute 3^(3^27) mod 100, I just need to find what 3^27 is mod 40, because 3^k mod 100 = 3^(k mod 40) mod 100, right? But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Because the exponent is 3^27, which is huge, so to compute 3^(3^27) mod 100, I can write it as 3^(k) mod 100, where k = 3^27. So, since 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100, 3^k mod 100 is the same as 3^(k mod 40) mod 100, but only if 3 and 100 are coprime, which they are. So yes, I can reduce the exponent modulo φ(100)=40.

Wait, but wait a second. That's only true when k is larger than φ(m), right? So yes, since 3^27 is way larger than 40, I can compute k mod 40, which is 3^27 mod 40, and then compute 3^(that result) mod 100.

So first, let's compute 3^27 mod 40. Hmm, but 3 and 40 are coprime, so maybe I can apply Euler's theorem again here. φ(40) is the number of integers less than 40 coprime to 40. 40 factors into 2^3 * 5^1, so φ(40) = 40 * (1-1/2) * (1-1/5) = 40 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 16.

So φ(40) is 16. So 3^16 ≡ 1 mod 40. So 3^k mod 40 is the same as 3^(k mod 16) mod 40. So to compute 3^27 mod 40, I can compute 27 mod 16, which is 11. So 3^27 mod 40 is 3^11 mod 40.

Wait no, wait. Let's think again. The exponent in 3^27 is 27, so 3^27 mod φ(40)=16. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

We're trying to compute 3^27 mod 40. Since 3 and 40 are coprime, we can use Euler's theorem again, which says 3^16 ≡ 1 mod 40. So 3^k mod 40 is the same as 3^(k mod 16) mod 40, as long as k and 16 are handled correctly.

So 27 divided by 16 is 1 with a remainder of 11. So 27 mod 16 is 11. Therefore, 3^27 mod 40 is the same as 3^11 mod 40.

So now we need to compute 3^11 mod 40. Let's compute that step by step.

3^1 = 3 mod 40
3^2 = 9
3^3 = 27
3^4 = 81 mod 40 is 1 (since 80 is 2*40, 81-80=1)
3^5 = 3^4 *3 = 1*3=3 mod40
3^6=3^5 *3=9 mod40
3^7=27 mod40
3^8=81 mod40=1
Hmm, I see a pattern here. The cycle is 3,9,27,1, and then repeats every 4 exponents. So the cycle length is 4.

So 3^4 mod40=1, 3^5=3, 3^6=9, 3^7=27, 3^8=1, etc.

So 3^11: let's see. 11 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 3. So 3^11 mod40 is the same as 3^(3) mod40, which is 27.

So 3^27 mod40 is 27.

Wait, no. Because 3^11 mod40: Let me compute it step by step to make sure.

3^1=3
3^2=9
3^3=27
3^4=81 mod40=1
3^5=3
3^6=9
3^7=27
3^8=1
3^9=3
3^10=9
3^11=27 mod40.

Yes, correct. So 3^11 mod40 is 27. So 3^27 mod40 is 27.

So now, going back, the exponent in 3^(3^27) mod100 is 3^27 mod40=27. So now, 3^27 mod100.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the original problem is 3^(3^(3^3)) mod100. 3^3 is 27, so it's 3^(3^27) mod100. So we have to compute 3^k mod100, where k=3^27.

But as I thought earlier, since φ(100)=40, 3^40 ≡1 mod100. So 3^k mod100 is same as 3^(k mod40) mod100. So k is 3^27, which mod40 is 27. So 3^27 mod100.

So now, I have to compute 3^27 mod100. Let's compute that.

Hmm, 3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27

3^4=81

3^5=243 mod100=43

3^6=43*3=129 mod100=29

3^7=29*3=87 mod100

3^8=87*3=261 mod100=61

3^9=61*3=183 mod100=83

3^10=83*3=249 mod100=49

3^11=49*3=147 mod100=47

3^12=47*3=141 mod100=41

3^13=41*3=123 mod100=23

3^14=23*3=69 mod100=69

3^15=69*3=207 mod100=7

3^16=7*3=21 mod100=21

3^17=21*3=63 mod100=63

3^18=63*3=189 mod100=89

3^19=89*3=267 mod100=67

3^20=67*3=201 mod100=1

3^20 mod100=1. Wow, that's an important point. So 3^20 ≡1 mod100.

So 3^20=1 mod100. So the cycle repeats every 20 exponents. So 3^k mod100 cycles every 20. So 27 divided by 20 is 1 with remainder 7. So 3^27 mod100 is same as 3^7 mod100, which is 87.

Wait, let me check that. Because from earlier, 3^7 was 87. Let me recount the earlier steps to make sure.

Yes, from 3^5=43, 3^6=29, 3^7=87. Correct.

So 3^27 mod100 is 87.

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure. So 3^20 is 1 mod100, and 3^27 is 3^(20+7) = (3^20)*(3^7) mod100=1*87=87 mod100.

So the result is 87.

Looking at the options, option G is 87. So the correct answer should be G.

To solve \( 3^{(3^{(3^3)})} \mod 100 \), we break it down step by step:

1. **Simplify the innermost exponent**:  
   \( 3^3 = 27 \).  
   Now, the expression becomes \( 3^{(3^{27})} \mod 100 \).

2. **Reduce the exponent \( 3^{27} \mod 40 \)**:  
   Using Euler's theorem, since \( \phi(100) = 40 \), we know \( 3^{40} \equiv 1 \mod 100 \). Thus, \( 3^{(3^{27})} \mod 100 \) depends on \( 3^{27} \mod 40 \).  
   - Compute \( 3^{27} \mod 40 \):  
     Using \( \phi(40) = 16 \), \( 3^{16} \equiv 1 \mod 40 \). Therefore, \( 3^{27} \equiv 3^{(27 \mod 16)} \equiv 3^{11} \mod 40 \).  
     Compute \( 3^{11} \mod 40 \):  
     \( 3^1 = 3 \), \( 3^2 = 9 \), \( 3^3 = 27 \), \( 3^4 = 81 \equiv 1 \mod 40 \). The cycle repeats every 4 exponents, so \( 3^{11} \equiv 3^3 \equiv 27 \mod 40 \).  
     Thus, \( 3^{27} \equiv 27 \mod 40 \).

3. **Compute \( 3^{27} \mod 100 \)**:  
   Since \( 3^{20} \equiv 1 \mod 100 \), the powers of 3 repeat every 20 exponents. Thus, \( 3^{27} \equiv 3^{(27 \mod 20)} \equiv 3^7 \mod 100 \).  
   Compute \( 3^7 \mod 100 \):  
   \( 3^1 = 3 \), \( 3^2 = 9 \), \( 3^3 = 27 \), \( 3^4 = 81 \), \( 3^5 = 243 \equiv 43 \mod 100 \), \( 3^6 = 43 \cdot 3 = 129 \equiv 29 \mod 100 \), \( 3^7 = 29 \cdot 3 = 87 \mod 100 \).  
   Thus, \( 3^{27} \equiv 87 \mod 100 \).

The final result is \( 87 \mod 100 \).  
From the given options, the correct answer is **G**.
