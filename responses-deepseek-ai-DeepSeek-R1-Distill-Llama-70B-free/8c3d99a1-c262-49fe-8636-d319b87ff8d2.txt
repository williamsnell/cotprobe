Okay, so I've got this question about skewness in a dataset. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll try to think it through.

The data given is the waist measurements of six chocolate rabbits. The measurements are: 3 inches, 2 inches, 3.7 inches, 5 inches, 2.7 inches, and 3 inches. I need to find the relative measure of skewness for this data.

First, I remember that skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. If skewness is positive, the tail on the right side is longer or fatter; if negative, the left side. If it's zero, the data is symmetric, which would mean it's normally distributed or maybe another symmetric distribution.

So, I should probably start by ordering the data to get a better sense. Let's arrange them from smallest to largest: 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recount. The numbers are 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5. So ordered correctly, it's 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5 inches.

Next, I should find the mean of these measurements because skewness is often calculated based on the mean. Let me compute that. 

Adding them up: 2 + 2.7 is 4.7. Then adding 3 makes 7.7, another 3 brings it to 10.7, plus 3.7 is 14.4, and then adding 5 gives 19.4 inches total.

Since there are six data points, the mean is 19.4 divided by 6. Let me calculate that: 19.4 ÷ 6. 6*3 is 18, so 19.4-18 is 1.4, so 3 and 1.4/6. 1.4 divided by 6 is approximately 0.2333. So the mean is about 3.2333 inches.

Now, to find the skewness, I think the formula involves the sum of the cubed deviations from the mean divided by the standard deviation cubed, then adjusted by the number of observations. Alternatively, I remember that for a sample, the formula is:

Skewness coefficient (g1) = [Sum((xi - mean)^3)] / [n * (std dev)^3]

But I'm not sure if I should use sample skewness or population skewness here. Since this is a sample of six rabbits, probably sample skewness applies, which uses n-1 in the denominator for variance. But wait, when calculating the standard deviation for skewness, I think it's the sample standard deviation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the mean (done: ~3.2333).
2. Subtract the mean from each data point to get deviations.
3. Cube each deviation.
4. Sum these cubed deviations.
5. Divide by the number of data points times the standard deviation cubed.

Wait, but I think the formula might actually be:

g1 = [sum((xi - x̄)^3)] / (n * s^3)

where s is the sample standard deviation.

So I need to compute each (xi - mean), cube them, sum them up, then divide by (n * (sample std dev)^3).

Let me compute each step.

First, calculate the deviations:

1. 2 - 3.2333 = -1.2333
2. 2.7 - 3.2333 = -0.5333
3. 3 - 3.2333 = -0.2333
4. 3 - 3.2333 = -0.2333
5. 3.7 - 3.2333 = +0.4667
6. 5 - 3.2333 = +1.7667

Now cube each of these:

1. (-1.2333)^3 ≈ -1.2333 * 1.2333 * 1.2333. Let me compute that. 1.2333^3 is about 1.2333 * 1.2333 = ~1.5209, then *1.2333 again is ~1.5209 *1.2333 ≈ 1.876. So negative, so -1.876.
2. (-0.5333)^3 = - (0.5333^3). 0.5333^3 is about 0.1516, so -0.1516.
3. (-0.2333)^3 ≈ -0.0127.
4. Same as above, -0.0127.
5. (0.4667)^3 ≈ 0.4667 *0.4667 = ~0.2178, then *0.4667 ≈ 0.1016.
6. (1.7667)^3 ≈ Let's see, 1.7667^2 is about 3.1202, then *1.7667 ≈ 5.513.

So summing these up:

-1.876 (first) 
-0.1516 (second)
-0.0127 (third)
-0.0127 (fourth)
+0.1016 (fifth)
+5.513 (sixth)

Let me compute step by step:

Start with -1.876.

Add -0.1516: -2.0276.

Add -0.0127: -2.0403.

Add another -0.0127: -2.053.

Add +0.1016: -1.9514.

Add +5.513: 3.5616.

So the sum of cubed deviations is approximately 3.5616.

Now, compute the sample standard deviation (s). First, I need the deviations squared.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the variance first. The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean.

So the squared deviations:

1. (-1.2333)^2 ≈ 1.5209
2. (-0.5333)^2 ≈ 0.2844
3. (-0.2333)^2 ≈ 0.0544
4. Same as above, 0.0544
5. (0.4667)^2 ≈ 0.2178
6. (1.7667)^2 ≈ 3.1202

Sum of squares: 1.5209 + 0.2844 + 0.0544 + 0.0544 + 0.2178 + 3.1202.

Adding:

1.5209 + 0.2844 = 1.8053

+0.0544 → 1.8597

+0.0544 → 1.9141

+0.2178 → 2.1319

+3.1202 → 5.2521.

The sum of squared deviations is ~5.2521.

Since this is a sample, the sample variance is sum of squares divided by (n-1), so 5.2521 /5 = 1.0504.

Sample standard deviation (s) is the square root of that. So sqrt(1.0504) ≈ 1.0247.

Now, back to the skewness formula:

g1 = sum of cubed deviations / [n * (s)^3]

sum is ~3.5616, n=6, s≈1.0247.

So denominator: 6 * (1.0247)^3.

Compute (1.0247)^3:

1.0247 *1.0247 = approx 1.05, then *1.0247 again: 1.05 *1.0247 ≈ 1.076.

So denominator: 6 *1.076 ≈6.456.

So g1 ≈ 3.5616 /6.456 ≈ 0.5517.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let's proceed.

Wait, but I thought the formula might have a different denominator. Let me double-check. Oh wait, some sources say that for sample skewness, it's [sum (xi - x̄)^3] / [n * s^3], but others might use n-1 in the denominator somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the population formula. But since this is a sample, I think the first approach is correct.

So the skewness coefficient is approximately 0.55. 

Now, what does this mean? A positive skewness indicates that the data is skewed to the right, meaning the tail is on the right side. So the distribution is positively skewed.

Looking at the data, the highest value is 5, which is quite a bit larger than the others. Most data points are clustered around 2-3.7, and then there's an outlier at 5. That would create a longer right tail, so positive skew.

Let me think again about the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Sum of cubed deviations: 3.5616.

Sample variance was 5.2521/5=1.0504, so s≈1.0247.

So s^3 is (1.0247)^3 ≈ 1.076.

Denominator: 6 *1.076≈6.456.

3.5616 /6.456≈0.5517.

So about 0.55. Positive, so skew is positive.

Now, looking at the options:

A: The distribution is positively skewed.

B: Skewness coefficient is zero.

C: Negatively skewed.

So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should consider whether the mode is on the left or right. Alternatively, maybe using another method to determine skew without calculating the exact coefficient.

Another approach: in a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median. Let's check that.

The data ordered is 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5.

The median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th terms. So (3 +3)/2=3.

The mean was about 3.2333, which is indeed higher than the median of 3. So that supports positive skewness.

In a positive skew, mean > median > mode. Wait, what's the mode here?

Looking at the data: 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7,5. The value 3 occurs twice, others once. So mode is 3.

So mean (3.233) > median (3) > mode (3). Wait, median equals mode here, but mean is higher. So that suggests positive skew.

Alternatively, when mean > median, it's positively skewed. When median > mean, it's negatively skewed.

Yes, that's another way to think about it.

So putting it all together: the data is positively skewed, so option A is correct.
</think>

To determine the relative measure of skewness for the given waist measurements of six chocolate rabbits (2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5 inches), we analyze the distribution as follows:

1. **Mean Calculation**:  
   The mean is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{2 + 2.7 + 3 + 3 + 3.7 + 5}{6} = \frac{19.4}{6} \approx 3.2333 \, \text{inches}.
   \]

2. **Median Calculation**:  
   The data is ordered: 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5. The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values:  
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{3 + 3}{2} = 3 \, \text{inches}.
   \]

3. **Mode**:  
   The mode is the most frequently occurring value. Here, the value 3 occurs twice, so the mode is 3 inches.

4. **Skewness Analysis**:  
   Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution. A positive skewness indicates a longer right tail, while a negative skewness indicates a longer left tail.  
   - The mean (\( \approx 3.2333 \)) is greater than the median (3), which suggests a positive skew.  
   - The data has an outlier at 5 inches, which pulls the mean higher than the median, further supporting the presence of positive skewness.

5. **Skewness Coefficient**:  
   Using the formula for the skewness coefficient:  
   \[
   g_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^3}{n \cdot s^3},
   \]  
   where \( \bar{x} \) is the mean, \( s \) is the sample standard deviation, and \( n \) is the number of observations. After calculating, the skewness coefficient is approximately \( +0.55 \), confirming a positive skew.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The distribution is positively skewed because the mean is greater than the median, and the data has a longer right tail due to the outlier at 5 inches.
