Okay, so I've got this question about defining "learning." Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember from my psychology classes that learning is about changes in behavior, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says learning is a change in behavior without practice or experience. Wait, isn't learning usually because of practice or experience? So this might not be correct. I think learning requires some kind of interaction or practice.

Option B is about an involuntary physiological response. That sounds more like a reflex, like when you pull your hand away from something hot. That's not learning because it's not something you learn to do; it's just an automatic response.

Option C states learning is a temporary change. No, I think learning is more permanent. Like, once you learn to ride a bike, you don't forget it easily. So temporary doesn't seem right.

Option D says it's a relatively permanent change due to practice or experience. That rings a bell. Learning involves changes that last, and it's based on what you experience or practice. This seems correct.

Option E is about a decrease in response to stimuli. Oh, that's habituation, not learning itself. Like when you get used to a noise and stop reacting. So E isn't the right definition.

Option F mentions periodic shifts in thinking. I don't recall learning being something that resets every few years. That doesn't fit with what I know about learning being a more lasting change.

Option G talks about acquiring skills through genetics. That's more like instinct. Humans and animals can have innate abilities, but learning is about acquiring new behaviors, not inherited ones.

Option H is a short-term adaptation without lasting effects. That sounds like conditioning maybe, but not learning. Learning should have a more permanent impact.

Option I is about memorizing facts. While memorization is part of learning, I think the definition is broader. Learning includes skills and behaviors, not just facts.

Option J is about downloading info directly. That's science fiction, like in The Matrix. Not real learning; it's a myth.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. It fits the idea that learning is a lasting change through practice or experience.

The correct answer is D: Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from conditions of practice or experience.
