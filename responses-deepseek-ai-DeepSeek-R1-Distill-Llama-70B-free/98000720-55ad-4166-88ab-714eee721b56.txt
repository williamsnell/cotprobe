Okay, so I have this question about spot rates and forward rates. Hmm, I remember from my finance class that spot rates are the interest rates for a loan or investment that starts immediately, right? And forward rates are the rates agreed upon today for a loan or investment that starts in the future.

The question gives me the spot rates for 1 and 2 years: s1 is 6.3% and s2 is 6.9%. I need to find the forward rate f_{1,2}, which is the rate for a one-year loan starting one year from now.

Wait, how do I calculate the forward rate? Oh right, I think it involves some formula. I remember something about present value. Oh yes, the forward rate can be calculated using the spot rates. The formula connects the two spot rates to find the forward rate between the first and second year.

So the formula is (1 + s2)^2 = (1 + s1) * (1 + f_{1,2}). Because the total return after two years should be the same whether you invest for two years at s2 or invest for one year at s1 and then the next at f_{1,2}.

Let me plug the numbers in. s1 is 6.3%, which is 0.063 in decimal. s2 is 6.9%, so 0.069.

So (1 + 0.069)^2 = (1 + 0.063) * (1 + f).

Calculating the left side first: 1.069 squared. Let me compute that. 1.069 * 1.069. Let's see, 1 * 1 is 1, 1 * 0.069 is 0.069, 0.069 *1 is 0.069, and 0.069*0.069 is about 0.004761. Adding those up: 1 + 0.069 +0.069 +0.004761 = 1.142761. So (1.069)^2 is 1.142761.

On the right side, (1 + 0.063) is 1.063. So the equation becomes 1.142761 = 1.063 * (1 + f).

To solve for (1 + f), divide both sides by 1.063. So (1 + f) = 1.142761 / 1.063.

Calculating that division: 1.142761 ÷ 1.063. Let me approximate. 1.063 times 1.075 is approximately 1.063 * 1.07 = 1.138 (because 1.063*.07 is about 0.07441, so 1.063 + 0.07441 ≈ 1.13741). Wait, but 1.142761 is a bit higher than that. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute 1.142761 divided by 1.063.

So 1.063 goes into 1.142761 how many times? Let's see:

1.063 * 1.07 = 1.063 * 1 + 1.063 * 0.07 = 1.063 + 0.07441 = 1.13741.

Subtract that from 1.142761: 1.142761 - 1.13741 = 0.005351.

So 0.005351 is the remainder. Now, how much more do we need beyond 1.07? Let me compute 0.005351 / 1.063.

Wait, that's approximately 0.005351 / 1.063 ≈ 0.00503, since 1.063 is about 1. So adding that to 0.07 gives 0.07503.

So (1 + f) ≈ 1.07503. Therefore, f ≈ 0.07503 or 7.503%.

Looking at the options, the closest one would be option H, which is 0.075.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes rounding can cause errors. Let me compute 1.142761 / 1.063 more precisely.

Using a calculator approach:

Divisor: 1.063

Dividend: 1.142761

How many times does 1.063 go into 1.142761.

1.063 * 1.07 = 1.13741 as before.

Remaining: 1.142761 - 1.13741 = 0.005351.

Now, 0.005351 divided by 1.063 is approximately 0.00503.

So 1.07 + 0.00503 = 1.07503.

So f is approximately 7.503%, which is 0.07503. The options are in decimals, so H is 0.075, which is 7.5%. That's very close.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me try to calculate 1.142761 / 1.063 exactly.

Let me write it as:

1.142761 ÷ 1.063 = ?

Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to make it 1142.761 ÷ 1063.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute 1.142761 / 1.063.

Another way: compute 1.142761 ÷ 1.063.

Let me write this as 1.142761 / 1.063 = (1.142761) * (1/1.063).

Compute 1/1.063: approximately 0.9409.

So 1.142761 * 0.9409 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

1.142761 * 0.9409.

Compute 1 * 0.9409 = 0.9409.

0.142761 * 0.9409 ≈ Let's see:

0.1 * 0.9409 = 0.09409.

0.04 * 0.9409 = 0.037636.

0.002761 * 0.9409 ≈ ≈0.0026.

Adding those: 0.09409 + 0.037636 = 0.131726 + 0.0026 ≈ 0.134326.

So total is 0.9409 + 0.134326 = 1.075226.

So approximately 1.075226, which is about 0.075226, so 7.5226%.

But wait, that's about 7.52%, which is a bit higher than the 7.503% I got earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the exact calculation is better. Let me compute 1.142761 divided by 1.063 precisely.

Using the formula:

f = [(1 + s2)^2 / (1 + s1)] - 1.

So let's compute (1.069)^2 = 1.142761, as before.

Divide by 1.063: 1.142761 / 1.063.

Let me compute this step by step.

1.063 × 1.07 = 1.13741.

The remainder is 1.142761 - 1.13741 = 0.005351.

Now, 0.005351 / 1.063 = approximately 0.00503.

So the total is 1.07 + 0.00503 = 1.07503, so f=0.07503 or 7.503%.

So the forward rate is approximately 7.5%, which is 0.075 in decimal.

Looking at the options, H is 0.075. So the correct answer should be H.

To calculate the forward rate \( f_{1,2} \), we use the relationship between spot rates and forward rates. The formula is:

\[
(1 + s_2)^2 = (1 + s_1)(1 + f_{1,2})
\]

Given:
- \( s_1 = 6.3\% = 0.063 \)
- \( s_2 = 6.9\% = 0.069 \)

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
(1 + 0.069)^2 = (1 + 0.063)(1 + f_{1,2})
\]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.069)^2 \):
\[
1.069^2 = 1.142761
\]

Next, calculate \( (1 + 0.063) \):
\[
1.063
\]

Now, solve for \( (1 + f_{1,2}) \):
\[
1 + f_{1,2} = \frac{1.142761}{1.063}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
1 + f_{1,2} \approx 1.07503
\]

Thus:
\[
f_{1,2} \approx 0.07503 \, \text{or} \, 7.503\%
\]

The closest option to \( 0.07503 \) is \( 0.075 \), which corresponds to option H.
