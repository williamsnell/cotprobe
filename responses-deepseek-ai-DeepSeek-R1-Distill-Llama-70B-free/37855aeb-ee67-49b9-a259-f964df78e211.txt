Okay, let's tackle this genetics problem. Hmm, so the organism has five independent gene pairs, and it's heterozygous for all of them. So the genotype would be AaBbDdEeFf, right? Wait, actually, wait, the question says five contrasting independent gene pairs: A vs a, B vs b, D vs d, E vs e, and F vs f. Oh wait, wait, that's A/a, B/b, D/d, E/e, F/f. So five gene pairs in total, each with two alleles. And the organism is heterozygous for all, so genotype is Aa Bb Dd Ee Ff.

The questions are part a, b, c. Let's take them one by one.

Part (a): What's the probability that the first progeny will have a genotype identical to that of the parent? So when the organism self-fertilizes, each gamete will have a combination of alleles.

Since each gene is independent, the probability for each gene to recombine is independent.

Wait, but selfing in plants usually refers to self-pollination, which for diploid organisms would involve producing gametes and then combining them. So for each gene, the parent is Aa, so when producing gametes, each gamete has a 50% chance of A or a. Same for the other genes.

When two gametes combine, for each gene, the possible genotypes are AA (25%), Aa (50%), or aa (25%). But wait, no, wait: when two gametes (each A or a) combine, the possible zygotes are AA (25%), Aa (50%, but wait, no, actually gamete A and a would give Aa, but wait, perhaps I'm confusing. Let's think again.

Wait, the parent is Aa for a gene. So each gamete has a 50% chance of A and 50% of a. When two gametes unite (selfing), the possible offspring for that gene are:

- A from both gametes: probability 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 → AA

- A from one and a from the other: 0.5 * 0.5 * 2 (since Aa and aA are same) → 0.5 → Aa

- a from both: 0.25 → aa

So for each gene, the probability the offspring has the same genotype as parent (which is Aa) is 0.5.

Wait, so for each gene, the chance the offspring has Aa is 0.5. Since all five genes are independent, the probability that all five have Aa is (0.5)^5.

Calculating that: 0.5^5 = 1/32. So the probability is 1/32. Hmm, but wait, let me check. Part (a) is the probability that the first progeny is identical to the parent. So for each of the five genes, the genotype must be heterozygous. So yes, each has a 1/2 chance, so 1/32 overall. So part a's answer is 1/32.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because when you self an Aa, each gene has independent assortment, so the probability for each gene to be Aa is 1/2. So for all five, it's (1/2)^5 = 1/32. So yes, 1/32.

Part (b): What proportion of the total progeny will be homozygous? Wait, wait. Wait, homozygous for all genes? Or homozygous for each gene? Because the wording is ambiguous.

Wait the question says "homozygous", but it's not clear whether it's homozygous for all five genes or any of them. But in genetics, when someone refers to an organism being homozygous without specifying, I think they mean homozygous for all loci, but wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it refers to each individual gene.

Wait, but part (b) is asking what proportion of the total progeny will be homozygous. Hmm. So the possible interpretations are either:

1. Each progeny is homozygous for all five genes.

Or 

2. Each progeny is homozygous for at least one gene.

But in standard terminology, when the question says "homozygous", it's more likely to refer to homozygous for all the genes. So let's consider that.

Wait, but wait again. Let's think. The parent is Aa Bb Dd Ee Ff. Selfing will produce offspring where each gene can be AA, Aa, or aa, etc. For the offspring to be homozygous, all five genes must be homozygous. So for each gene, the chance of being homozygous (AA or aa for each gene) is 25% + 25% = 50%. Wait, no, wait. For each gene, the chance of being homozygous is 25% AA + 25% aa = 50% per gene.

Wait, wait, no: when selfing an Aa, the probability that the offspring is AA is 25%, Aa is 50%, aa is 25%. So the chance of being homozygous (either AA or aa) is 25% +25% = 50% per gene. Since all five genes are independent, the probability that all five are homozygous is (0.5)^5.

Wait, 0.5^5 is 1/32. So the proportion is 1/32.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me recheck: for each gene, the chance of being homozygous is 0.5. Since the five are independent, the chance that all are homozygous is (0.5)^5 = 1/32.

Wait, but that's the same as part (a). But part (a) was the probability of being identical to the parent (all heterozygous). Part (b) is all homozygous. So 1/32 each. But the question asks for the proportion of the total progeny that are homozygous. Wait, but this seems similar to part (a), but probably not.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the total number of possible gametes when selfing a five heterozygote is 2^5 = 32 possible gamete combinations. But when selfing, each gamete combines with another gamete, so the total possible zygote combinations are 3^5 = 243. Because each of the five genes has three possibilities (AA, Aa, aa, etc.), so 3^5 is 243 possible genotypic combinations.

So for part (b), the number of progeny that are homozygous for all genes would be when each gene is either AA or aa. So for each gene, there's 2 possibilities (homozygous dominant or recessive). So 2^5 = 32 possibilities. So the proportion is 32 / (3^5) = 32 / 243. Wait, but that's 32/243, which is about 0.1316.

Wait, but 3^5 is 243. Because each gene has 3 possibilities (AA, Aa, aa). So the total possible is 3^5 = 243.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of probabilities. For each gene, the chance of being homozygous is 0.5. So all five being homozygous is (0.5)^5 = 1/32.

But 1/32 is 0.03125, which is 3/96, but 32/243 is approximately 0.1316, which is about 1/7.6. Wait, but which approach is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the approaches. Let me think: when you calculate the probability for each gene, then for all five, it's (0.5)^5 = 1/32. But when calculating the number of favorable outcomes over total, it's 32 (favorable) / 243 (total) = 32/243 ≈ 0.1316.

Wait, but wait, 32 is 2^5, which is the number of homozygous possibilities (each gene has two homozygous options). So the number of homozygous progeny is 32, and the total possible is 3^5 = 243. So the proportion is 32/243.

Wait, but 32/243 is approximately 0.1316, which is about 1/7.6. So the proportion would be 32/243. Let me compute 32 divided by 243.

243 divided by 32: 32 ×7=224, 32×7.59≈243. So 32/243 ≈ 0.1316.

So part (b) would be 32/243, which is approximately 0.1316.

Alternatively, another approach: for each gene, the probability of being homozygous is 1/2, so for all five, (1/2)^5 = 1/32. Wait, but this would be 0.03125, but that's conflicting with the 32/243 approach.

Wait, but which approach is correct? Let me think again. The total number of possible outcomes when selfing a 5-heterozygous plant is 3^5 = 243. Because each gene can be AA, Aa, or aa (3 possibilities), and there are five genes, so 3^5=243 possible genotypes.

The number of favorable outcomes (all homozygous) is 2^5=32, since each gene can be either AA or aa, two possibilities, and five genes, so 2^5=32.

So the proportion is 32/243, which is approximately 0.1316.

So part (b) is 32/243. Let me see if any of the options match that. Looking at the options:

Option E: 1/32, 1/32, 243/1024.

No, because part (b) would be 32/243. None of the options have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a single progeny is homozygous (all genes) is (1/3)^5? No, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no. For each gene, the probability of being homozygous is 2*(1/4) = 1/2. Because for each gene, the chance of AA is 25%, aa is 25%, so 50% total for homozygous. So for all five, it's (1/2)^5 = 1/32. So the proportion would be 1/32.

Hmm, wait, but earlier I thought that the count was 32/243, but maybe that's when considering all possible genotypic outcomes. But perhaps I'm confusing the concepts of probability and counts.

Wait, in selfing, each gamete has a certain probability, and when you combine two gametes, the probability of each genotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities. Alternatively, the total number of possible genotypic combinations is 3^5 = 243, but each has different probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the probability for each gene. For each gene, the probability that the progeny is homozygous (either AA or aa) is 25% + 25% = 50% = 1/2. Since all five are independent, the probability that all five are homozygous is (1/2)^5 = 1/32.

So part (b) is 1/32. So the proportion of progeny that are homozygous is 1/32.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the count approach. Because in the count approach, the number of homozygous progeny is 32 (2^5) and total is 243 (3^5), so 32/243 is the proportion. But according to the probability approach, each gene has a 1/2 chance to be homozygous, so for all five, it's 1/32.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts. The probability approach assumes that each gene is independent, so the combined probability is the product of individual probabilities. So for each gene, the probability of being homozygous is 1/2. So for all five, it's (1/2)^5 = 1/32.

But the count approach gives 32/243. Wait, 32 is the number of favorable outcomes, and 243 is the total number of possible outcomes. So 32/243 is approximately 0.1316, which is larger than 1/32 (0.03125).

So which is correct? I think the probability approach is correct. Because each gene's outcome is independent, and the overall probability is the product of individual probabilities. So the correct answer for part (b) would be 1/32.

Wait, but the count approach seems to suggest otherwise. Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering that each outcome doesn't have equal probability. Because when you self, the probability of each genotype isn't uniform. For example, for a single gene, AA has probability 25%, Aa 50%, and aa 25%. So for each gene, the probability of being homozygous is 50%, but the overall probability when considering all five is the product, so (1/2)^5 = 1/32.

So part (b) is 1/32.

Wait, but another way to think: the probability that each of the five genes is homozygous is (1/2) for each. Since they're independent, the joint probability is (1/2)^5 = 1/32. So yes, that's correct.

So part (b) is 1/32.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The first part (a) is 1/32, part (b) is also 1/32. So looking at the options:

Option E: (a) 1/32, (b) 1/32, (c) 243/1024.

Wait, but I'm not sure about part (c) yet. Let's do part (c) now.

Part (c): Assuming complete dominance for each gene pair, what proportion of the total progeny will phenotypically exhibit the dominant form for the five characters?

So for each gene, the dominant phenotype is expressed if the genotype is AA or Aa. Recessive is only aa. So for each gene, the probability that the progeny shows the dominant phenotype is the probability of being AA or Aa.

For each gene, the probability of dominant phenotype is P(AA) + P(Aa) = 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75, or 3/4.

Since all five genes are independent, the probability that all five show dominant phenotypes is (3/4)^5.

Calculating that: (3/4)^5 = (243)/(1024).

So 243/1024.

So the proportion is 243/1024.

So part (c) is 243/1024.

Putting it all together:

(a) 1/32 → part (a) is 1/32.

(b) 1/32 → part (b) is 1/32.

(c) 243/1024 → part (c) is 243/1024.

Looking at the options, option E is:

E: 1/32, 1/32, 243/1,024

Yes, that matches.

So the correct answer is option E.
</think>

The organism is heterozygous for five independent gene pairs (AaBbDdEeFf). The problem involves calculating probabilities for three scenarios: (a) the probability that the first progeny has the same genotype as the parent, (b) the proportion of progeny that are homozygous for all five genes, and (c) the proportion of progeny that phenotypically exhibit the dominant form for all five characters. Here's the analysis:

### Part (a): Probability of a progeny genotype identical to the parent
For the progeny to have the same genotype as the parent (AaBbDdEeFf), each gene must be heterozygous (Aa, Bb, Dd, Ee, Ff). The probability of a gene being heterozygous after selfing is \( \frac{1}{2} \) (since the possible genotypes are AA, Aa, or aa, with Aa occurring 50% of the time). Since the genes are independent, the probability for all five genes to be heterozygous is:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{32}
\]

Thus, the probability that the first progeny has the same genotype as the parent is \( \frac{1}{32} \).

---

### Part (b): Proportion of progeny that are homozygous for all five genes
A progeny is homozygous for all five genes if each gene is either homozygous dominant (e.g., AA) or homozygous recessive (e.g., aa). For each gene, the probability of being homozygous is:

\[
P(\text{homozygous}) = P(\text{AA}) + P(\text{aa}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the genes are independent, the probability that all five genes are homozygous is:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{32}
\]

Thus, the proportion of progeny that are homozygous for all five genes is \( \frac{1}{32} \).

---

### Part (c): Proportion of progeny exhibiting the dominant phenotype for all five characters
Assuming complete dominance, the dominant phenotype is expressed for a gene if the genotype is either homozygous dominant (e.g., AA) or heterozygous (e.g., Aa). For each gene, the probability of exhibiting the dominant phenotype is:

\[
P(\text{dominant}) = P(\text{AA}) + P(\text{Aa}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Since the genes are independent, the probability that all five genes exhibit the dominant phenotype is:

\[
\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^5 = \frac{243}{1024}
\]

Thus, the proportion of progeny that phenotypically exhibit the dominant
