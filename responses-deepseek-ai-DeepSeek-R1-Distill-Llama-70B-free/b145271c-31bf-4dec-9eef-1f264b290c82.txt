Okay, so I've got this question about information theory and dice. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the question is: A man is told that when a pair of dice were rolled, the sum was seven. How much information is in this message? The options are various bit values.

Wait, I remember from my studies that information theory deals with quantifying information, often using bits. The basic idea is that the amount of information is related to the probability of an event. So the formula I think is something like H = -log2(p), where p is the probability.

Right, but first I need to find the probability of getting a sum of seven when rolling two dice. Let's think about that. When you roll two six-sided dice, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes, right? Each die is independent, so each outcome is equally likely.

Now, how many ways can you get a sum of seven? Let me list them out. The possible pairs are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). So that's 6 outcomes. So the probability p is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6. So p = 1/6.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6/36 is 1/6? No, wait 6 divided by 36 is 1/6? No, wait 6/36 is 1/6? Oh yeah, because 6 times 6 is 36. So yes, 6/36 = 1/6. So p is 1/6.

So the information content is the negative logarithm (base 2) of the probability. So I = -log2(1/6). Let me compute that. log2(1/6) is log2(1) - log2(6), which is 0 - log2(6). So that's -log2(6). So the information is log2(6) bits.

Wait, wait, because I is -log2(p). So p is 1/6, so I = -log2(1/6) which equals log2(6). Because log2(1/6) is negative, so the negative of that is positive. 

What's log2(6)? Let's calculate. I know that 2^2 is 4 and 2^3 is 8. So log2(6) is between 2 and 3. Let's see, 2^2.58 is approximately 6. Because 2^2 is 4, 2^2.585 would be about 6. So I think the log2(6) is approximately 2.585 bits.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.585 bits. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I considered all possibilities. The question is about the information in the message. Is it the same as the entropy of the event, or is it the amount of information gained?

Yes, because when you're told that the sum is seven, the information is based on the probability of that event. So it's the self-information, which is -log2(p). So yes, that's correct.

I think that's solid. So the answer is C: 2.585 bits.
</think>

The amount of information in the message is determined using the formula for self-information, \( I = -\log_2(p) \), where \( p \) is the probability of the event. When rolling two six-sided dice, there are 36 possible outcomes, and 6 of these outcomes result in a sum of seven. Thus, the probability \( p \) is \( \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \). 

Substituting \( p = \frac{1}{6} \) into the formula gives:

\[
I = -\log_2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) = \log_2(6).
\]

The value of \( \log_2(6) \) is approximately 2.585 bits. Therefore, the information in the message is 2.585 bits, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
