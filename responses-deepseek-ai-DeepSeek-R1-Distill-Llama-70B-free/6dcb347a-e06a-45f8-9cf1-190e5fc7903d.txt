Okay, so I've got this problem about FM receivers and signal-to-noise ratios. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me an input signal-to-noise ratio (S_i/N) of 40 dB. Then, it's about calculating the output signal-to-noise ratio for different values of beta (β), which are 5, 10, and 105. The options are A to J, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that in FM systems, the output SNR depends on the input SNR and the modulation index. Oh right, the formula for the output SNR after FM detection is something like (S_o/N_o) = (β² * (S_i/N)) / (1 + S_i/N). Or wait, maybe I have that wrong. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: the output SNR is 3β² times the input SNR when the input SNR is much higher than 1 (which, in dB terms, is when S_i/N is well above 0 dB, which 40 dB definitely is). But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

FM detection typically uses a discriminator, and the noise in the detector is affected by the modulation. For FM, the output SNR is given by:

S_o/N_o = (3/2) * β² * (S_i/N)

But wait, wait. Another thought: I think the formula is S_o/N_o = (β²) * (S_i/N) / (1 + S_i/N). Because when S_i/N is large (like 40 dB, which is 10^4 in linear terms), the denominator becomes S_i/N, so S_o/N_o ≈ β². But that doesn't make sense because β can be big, like 105. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. Oh right, for FM, the output SNR after detection (like in a Foster-Seely discriminator) is given by:

S_o/N_o = ( (3/2) * β² * (S_i/N) ) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right either because when S_i/N is large, the denominator is dominated by S_i/N, so S_o/N_o would be approximately (3/2 β²) (S_i/N) / (S_i/N) ) = 3/2 β², which is a constant. That can't be correct because for higher β, the output SNR should improve.

Alternatively, another formula I recall is for the output SNR of an FM system is:

S_o/N_o = ( (β^2) * (S_i/N) ) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

But when S_i/N is much larger than 1, which it is here (40 dB is 10^4 in linear), this simplifies to β². So the output SNR would be β squared.

Wait, that doesn't make sense either because if beta is 105, then beta squared is 11025, which is a huge number, but the options don't show that. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S_o/N_o = 3β² (S_i/N) / (1 + S_i/N). Let me check the units. S_i/N is unitless, so the output would scale with beta squared times S_i/N, divided by something.

Another approach: I think the correct formula for the output SNR after FM detection is:

S_o/N_o = ( (β²) * (S_i/N) ) / (1 + (S_i/N) + (β² * (S_i/N)) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Or maybe the formula is:

S_o/N_o = ( ( (3/2) β² ) * (S_i/N) ) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

Because I remember that for FM, the improvement in SNR depends on the modulation index and the input SNR. Let me try plugging some numbers.

The input S_i/N is 40 dB, which is 10^4 in linear terms (since 10^(40/10) = 10^4).

So for each β, I can compute S_o/N_o as:

S_o/N_o = (3/2) * β² * (S_i/N) / (1 + S_i/N)

Wait, but if S_i/N is 1e4, then 1 + S_i/N is approximately 1e4, so the denominator is about 1e4. So the expression becomes (3/2 β² * 1e4 ) / 1e4 ) = 3/2 β².

Wait, that would mean the output SNR is 1.5 * β squared. But if β is 5, that's 1.5 *25=37.5, which is 37.5 in linear terms, but that's way higher than the input SNR of 40 dB. That can't be right because when you demodulate, the SNR should be better than the input, but wait, for FM, the SNR can be better, especially with higher beta.

Wait, but in the case of FM, if the modulation index is high, the SNR improves. So for high beta, the output SNR is higher.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the output SNR after FM detection is given by:

S_o/N_o = ( (3/2) * β² * (S_i/N) ) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

But when S_i/N is much greater than 1, as it is here, this simplifies to S_o/N_o ≈ (3/2) * β².

Wait, that would mean that the output SNR is 1.5 times beta squared, which for beta=5 is 37.5, which is 37.5 dB. But wait, the input is 40 dB, so the output is lower? That doesn't make sense because FM is supposed to have better noise performance when beta is high.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try to find the correct formula.

After some thinking, I recall that the output SNR for an FM system is given by:

S_o / N_o = (3 β²) / ( (1 + (4/3) β²) ) * (S_i / N_i )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the output SNR after FM detection is:

S_o/N_o = ( (β²) * (S_i/N) ) / (1 + (β² * (S_i/N)) )

No, that can't be right because if beta is high, the denominator becomes large, which would lower the output.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Let's think about the noise in FM. The noise after detection is proportional to the square of the noise in the frequency domain, which is affected by the modulation index.

Wait, I think I need to look up the correct formula. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to deduce it.

Another approach: The output SNR for FM is given by:

S_o/N_o = (S_i/N_i) * (3 β²) / (1 + (S_i/N_i) )

Wait, that makes more sense. Because when S_i/N_i is large, the denominator is about S_i/N_i, so S_o/N_o ≈ 3 β², which is a constant, independent of the input SNR. That seems plausible. But wait, for beta=5, that would make 3*25=75, which is 37.7 dB. But the input is 40 dB, so the output is lower. That doesn't make sense because FM can provide better SNR with higher beta.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing AM and FM. In AM, the output SNR is the same as the input, but in FM, it's better, especially when beta is large.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

S_o/N_o = ( (3/2) * β² * (S_i/N) ) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

So let's plug in the numbers.

Given S_i/N = 40 dB, which is 10^4 in linear.

So for each beta, compute:

First, S_i/N = 1e4.

Then,

S_o/N_o = ( (3/2) * β² * 1e4 ) / (1 + 1e4 )

Since 1e4 >>1, denominator is ≈1e4.

So,

S_o/N_o ≈ (1.5 * β² * 1e4 ) / 1e4 ) = 1.5 β².

So, in linear terms, it's 1.5 β².

But wait, that gives S_o/N_o in linear. We need to convert back to dB.

So for each beta, compute 1.5 * β², then take 10 log10 of that.

Wait, wait, no. Because S_i/N is in dB, but in the formula, it's in linear terms. Let me make sure.

Actually, the formula uses S_i/N in linear terms, not dB. So first, we have S_i/N = 40 dB = 10^4.

So, for each beta:

Compute S_o/N_o (linear) = (3/2) * beta^2 * (S_i/N) / (1 + S_i/N )

But since S_i/N is 1e4, which is much larger than 1, this simplifies to:

S_o/N_o ≈ (3/2) * beta^2 * (1e4) / (1e4) = (3/2) beta^2.

So S_o/N_o in linear is (3/2) beta².

Convert that to dB: 10 * log10( (3/2) beta² )

So let's compute for each beta.

Beta =5:

(3/2) * 25 = 37.5 → 10 log10(37.5) ≈ 10 * 1.574 ≈ 15.74 dB? Wait, that can't be right because the input was 40 dB.

Wait, that would give output SNR of about 15 dB, which is worse than the input. That can't be correct.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Because the formula I'm using must be incorrect. Because in reality, FM can provide an improvement in SNR when beta is high.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S_o/N_o = (beta^2) * (S_i/N) / (1 + S_i/N )

Wait, let's try that.

So, S_o/N_o (linear) = (beta^2 * 1e4) / (1 + 1e4) ≈ beta^2.

Because 1e4 dominates the denominator.

So, for beta=5, beta^2 is 25 → S_o/N_o is 25 in linear, which is 10*log10(25) ≈ 7.96 dB? No, that's even worse.

Wait, this can't be right. I'm getting conflicting results, which suggests I'm using the wrong formula.

Another approach: I think the formula for the output SNR after FM detection is:

S_o/N_o = ( (3/2) * beta^2 ) / ( (4 pi^2) * (S_i/N) ) )

Wait, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the concept of threshold effect in FM. I remember that for FM, as the modulation index increases, the noise after detection decreases, but only up to a certain point. But I'm not recalling the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S_o/N_o = (3/2) * (beta^2) * (S_i/N). Because when S_i/N is high, the output is proportional to beta squared times the input SNR.

Wait, let's try that.

For beta=5,

S_o/N_o = 1.5 * 25 * 1e4 = 1.5 * 25 * 1e4 = 3.75e5.

Convert that to dB: 10 log10(3.75e5) = 10*(log10(3.75)+5) ≈ 10*(0.574 +5) = 10*5.574=55.74 dB.

Which is about 55.7 dB, which is option B's first value.

Wait, let me check.

Option B: β=5 →55.7 dB; β=10→61.7 dB; β=105→82.185 dB.

Wait, that seems plausible.

So the formula would be S_o/N_o = (3/2) beta^2 * (S_i/N) in linear, then convert to dB.

Wait, but that would mean that the output SNR increases with beta squared times the input SNR, which doesn't make sense because when beta is 105, the output would be way too high.

Wait, for beta=105, 3/2*(105)^2 = 3/2 * 11025 = 16537.5.

Multiply by S_i/N (1e4): 16537.5 * 1e4 = 1.65375e8.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the formula I'm using seems to give an output SNR that's way higher than the input.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again.

I think I found the correct approach. The output SNR for FM is given by:

S_o/N_o = (3/2) * (beta^2) * (S_i/N) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

But when S_i/N is much greater than 1, this simplifies to (3/2) * beta^2.

So, in linear terms, it's 1.5 * beta^2.

So for beta=5: 1.5 *25=37.5 → 37.5 in linear → 10*log10(37.5)=~15.7 dB, which is worse than the input. That can't be right.

Wait, this is getting me stuck. Another thought: perhaps the formula is S_o/N_o = (beta^2) * (S_i/N) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

Then, for beta=5 and S_i/N=1e4,

S_o/N_o = (25 * 1e4) / (1 + 1e4) ≈ 25 *1e4 /1e4=25 → 10 log10(25)=~7.96 dB, which is worse.

That's not matching any of the options. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the output SNR is calculated differently. I found in my notes that for FM, the output SNR is given by:

S_o/N_o = ( (3/2) * beta^2 * (S_i/N) ) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

Wait, but when S_i/N is large, it's approximately (3/2 beta^2) as before, which would give the output SNR as 3/2 beta^2 in linear.

So for beta=5, that's 37.5 in linear, which is 10 log10(37.5) ≈15.7 dB. That doesn't match the options, which have higher values.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think differently. Oh wait! Maybe the formula is:

S_o/N_o = (3/2) * (beta^2) * (S_i/N) in dB.

Wait, that can't be because dB is logarithmic. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute it in linear terms.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the formula. I'll try to look up the correct formula conceptually.

In FM systems, the SNR at the output is improved by increasing the modulation index beta, especially when the input SNR is good. The improvement is proportional to beta squared.

The correct formula for the output SNR after FM detection is:

S_o/N_o = (3/2) * (beta^2) * (S_i/N) / (1 + (S_i/N) )

But when S_i/N is much larger than 1, this approximates to (3/2) * beta^2.

So for example, when beta=5, S_o/N_o ≈ (3/2)*25 = 37.5 (linear).

Convert that to dB: 10*log10(37.5) ≈15.7 dB, which is lower than the input of 40 dB. That doesn't make sense because FM should give better SNR.

Wait, this must be wrong because logically, with higher beta, the output SNR should be better. So perhaps I have the formula inverted.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is S_o/N_o = ( (3/2) * (beta^2) ) / (S_i/N) )

But that would mean for higher beta, higher output SNR, but if S_i/N is higher, output SNR decreases, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S_o/N_o = (3/2) * (beta^2) * (1 + (S_i/N) )

Wait, that would make the output even higher, which for beta=5 would be 37.5 * (1+1e4) ≈37.5 *1e4=375,000, which is 10 log(375000)= about 58.7 dB. That matches option A's first value.

Wait, option A for beta=5 is 58.7 dB. Let's see.

If the formula is S_o/N_o = (3/2) * beta^2 * (1 + S_i/N )

Wait, for beta=5, that would be 1.5*25*(1 +1e4)= 37.5*(10001)≈37.5*1e4=375,000. 10 log(375000)= log10(3.75e5)= log10(3.75)+5≈0.574+5=5.574→55.74 dB, which is about 55.7 dB, matching option B's first value.

Wait, but then when S_i/N is large, the formula becomes S_o/N_o ≈1.5*beta^2 * S_i/N, which would be 1.5*25*1e4=3.75e5, which is 55.74 dB.

So the formula must be S_o/N_o = (3/2)*beta^2*(S_i/N) in linear terms.

So for each beta:

Compute (3/2)*beta^2*(S_i/N) in linear, then convert to dB.

Wait, but S_i/N is given as 40 dB, which is 1e4 in linear.

So for beta=5:

(3/2)*25*1e4 = (1.
