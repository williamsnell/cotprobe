Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about gender-role identity development theories. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory aligns with the research described. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that parents play more roughly with male children and are more protective of female ones. I remember that different theories explain how gender roles develop. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Cognitive development. That's like Piaget's theory, right? It deals with how children think and understand the world, but I'm not sure it's directly about how parents influence gender roles through their behavior. Maybe more about the child's internal processes.

Option B: Identity theory. I'm not too familiar with this one. I think it relates to how individuals perceive themselves within social groups, but I'm not sure how it ties into parental behavior influencing gender roles.

Option C: Cultural theory. This sounds like it involves cultural norms and values shaping behavior. Parents might treat boys and girls differently because of cultural expectations. That seems possible. Like, cultures often dictate what's acceptable for boys versus girls, so parents follow those norms.

Option D: Biological theory. This would suggest that the behavior is driven by biology, like genetics or hormones. So parents might play rough with boys because boys are biologically more aggressive. But wait, the question is about parents' actions, not the children's inherent traits. So maybe it's more about environment than biology.

Option E: Constructivist theory. Constructivists believe that knowledge is constructed through social interactions. So parents' interactions would shape the child's understanding of gender roles. This could fit, as the parents are actively engaging in behaviors that teach gender norms.

Option F: Social learning. This theory says that people learn by observing and imitating others, and through reinforcement. Parents playing rough with boys and being protective with girls might be teaching them gender-appropriate behaviors through example and reinforcement. That seems to fit well because it's about learning from others' behavior.

Option G: Psychoanalytic theory. Freud's ideas about the unconscious mind and stages of development. I think this relates more to internal conflicts and parent-child relationships in terms of psychosexual development, not so much the rough-and-tumble play aspect.

Option H: Gender schema. This theory suggests that children develop schemas (or frameworks) about gender, which guide their understanding and behavior. Parents reinforcing certain behaviors would help build these schemas. So this could be a possible answer.

Option I: Psychodynamic. Similar to psychoanalytic, I believe. It's more about internal psychological processes and less about observable behavior patterns taught by parents.

Option J: Evolutionary psychology theory. This theory looks at behaviors through the lens of evolution. Maybe rough play with boys could be seen as preparing them for competition or leadership roles, which have evolutionary roots. That could explain why parents subconsciously behave that way.

So, thinking about it, the research is showing that parents treat boys and girls differently. Social learning theory (F) would say that children learn gender roles by observing their parents' behavior and imitating it. So if parents are roughhousing with boys, the boys might learn that's acceptable behavior for males, and girls learn to be more cautious.

But then, evolutionary psychology (J) suggests that these behaviors have evolutionary origins. For example, rough play could prepare boys for physical challenges, which might have been advantageous in the past. So parents might be unconsciously treating boys and girls differently because of evolved tendencies.

Wait, the question is about which theory is most consistent. Social learning is about learning from environment, so parents' actions directly influence the child's behavior. Evolutionary theory would explain why those parenting behaviors exist in the first place. So the research is about the parenting behavior, not the evolutionary reason behind it.

Alternatively, the cultural theory (C) would say that parents act this way because culture tells them that's how boys and girls should be treated. So if a culture values males being tough, parents engage in rough play.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between F, C, and J. Let me think again.

The question is about which theory explains the parents' behavior influencing gender roles. Social learning theory would say that the children model their behavior based on their parents' actions. So if parents play rough with sons, the sons learn that being rough is part of being male. Similarly, being protective teaches daughters to be more cautious.

Cultural theory would explain that parents are following cultural norms. So the parents' behavior is a result of cultural expectations, which then shapes the child's gender identity.

Evolutionary psychology would suggest that the parents' behavior is an evolved strategy, perhaps to prepare boys for roles that require strength, etc.

The question is asking which theory the research supports. So if the research shows that parents behave this way, what theory explains why this happens.

Wait, maybe the question is about the theory that explains the development of gender roles in children, given the parents' behavior. So if parents play rough with boys, which theory explains how the child develops their gender identity from that.

In that case, social learning (F) and gender schema (H) are strong contenders. Social learning is about observing and imitating, so the child would model the behavior. Gender schema is about organizing information based on gender, so the parents' actions reinforce the schema.

Alternatively, evolutionary theory (J) is more about why the parents behave that way, not how the child develops gender identity.

So the question is about the theory of gender-role identity development, so it's more about the child's development process.

So the research shows parents treating sons and daughters differently. Which theory explains how this leads to gender roles.

Social learning (F) would say that children imitate the behaviors they see. So if parents are rough with boys, boys see that as acceptable behavior and imitate it.

Gender schema (H) says that children develop mental frameworks about gender, and the parents' actions would help shape those schemas, influencing the child's behavior.

Hmm, which one is more directly tied to differential treatment by parents. Social learning seems more about direct imitation, while gender schema is about cognitive structures.

Wait, in social learning theory, Bandura's ideas include not just imitation but also reinforcement. So if parents encourage rough play in boys, those behaviors are reinforced, leading the child to adopt them.

So the answer could be F: Social learning.

Another angle: Evolutionary psychology (J) would argue that these behaviors are instinctual, shaped by evolution. So parents might be more protective of girls because, evolutionarily, ensuring their survival could have been more crucial. Rough play with boys might prepare them for competition. But this is more about why parents behave this way, not how the child develops gender identity.

So I think the correct answer is F: Social learning theory. Or perhaps J, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the theories again.

Social Learning Theory suggests that gender roles are learned through observing and imitating models, such as parents. So if parents play rough with boys, the boys learn that's a male behavior.

Gender Schema Theory says that children develop schemas that organize gender-related information, which then guides their behavior. So when parents treat sons and daughters differently, it reinforces the child's schema about what's appropriate for their gender.

So both theories could apply, but which one is more directly related to the parents' behavior shaping the child's identity.

Alternatively, the research refers to parents being more protective of daughters and rougher with sons. This differential treatment could be seen as modeling gender roles, which is social learning. Or it could be reinforcing the child's existing schemas.

Hmm. The question is which theory is most consistent. So which theory emphasizes the role of such differential treatment by parents.

I think Social Learning Theory, which emphasizes observation and imitation, would be the best fit. Because parents are modeling behaviors that the child then adopts.

So I'll go with F: Social learning.

The question asks which theory of gender-role identity development is most consistent with research showing that parents play more roughly with male children and are more protective of female children. To determine the answer, it is important to evaluate how each theory explains the development of gender roles in children, particularly in the context of parental behavior.

- **Option A: Cognitive Development** focuses on how children think and understand the world, emphasizing internal processes rather than the influence of parental behavior on gender roles. This does not align well with the research.

- **Option B: Identity Theory** pertains to how individuals perceive themselves within social groups but does not directly address how parental behavior shapes gender roles.

- **Option C: Cultural Theory** suggests that cultural norms and values shape behavior, so parents might treat boys and girls differently due to cultural expectations. While plausible, this theory focuses more on the source of parental behavior rather than how children develop gender roles.

- **Option D: Biological Theory** attributes behavior to biological factors like genetics or hormones. However, the research focuses on parental actions, not inherent biological differences in children.

- **Option E: Constructivist Theory** emphasizes that knowledge is constructed through social interactions. While this could apply, it is broader and less specific to gender-role development than other theories.

- **Option F: Social Learning Theory** explains that children learn by observing and imitating others, with reinforcement shaping behavior. This theory fits well because parents modeling rough play with boys and protective behavior with girls directly teaches children gender-appropriate behaviors.

- **Option G: Psychoanalytic Theory** focuses on internal psychological processes and stages of development, which is less relevant to the observable parental behavior described.

- **Option H: Gender Schema Theory** suggests that children develop mental frameworks about gender, shaped by experiences like parental behavior. This theory is also a strong contender, as it explains how differential treatment reinforces gender schemas.

- **Option I: Psychodynamic Theory** overlaps with psychoanalytic theory, focusing on internal psychological processes rather than observable behavior.

- **Option J: Evolutionary Psychology Theory** explains behavior through evolutionary origins, such as preparing boys for competition. While this could explain why parents behave differently, it does not focus on how children develop gender roles.

The research highlights how parental behavior influences gender-role development. Social Learning Theory (F) is the most consistent because it directly explains how children learn gender roles by observing and imitating parental behavior, with reinforcement shaping their understanding of appropriate behaviors. While Gender Schema Theory (H) is also relevant, Social Learning Theory provides a clearer explanation of the learning process described in the research.
