Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a model of a park. Hmm, let's read it again. The scale is 1.5 centimeters to 50 meters. So the model is much smaller than the real thing, right? They're asking about the distance between two trees in the park, which is 150 meters. I need to find out what that distance would be on the model.

Wait, scale models usually represent real-life measurements in a reduced size. So the scale given is 1.5 cm : 50 meters. I think I need to set up a ratio here. Let me think about how to convert the real distance to the model's scale.

First, I should probably convert the real distance and the scale to the same units to make it easier. The real distance is 150 meters, and the scale is given in centimeters and meters. Hmm, maybe I should convert 50 meters to centimeters because the model uses centimeters. Oh wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 50 meters is 50 * 100 = 5000 centimeters.

So the scale is 1.5 cm (model) to 5000 cm (real). Now, the real distance is 150 meters. Let me convert that to centimeters too. 150 meters is 150 * 100 = 15,000 centimeters.

Now, I need to find out what distance on the model (let's call it x) corresponds to 15,000 cm in real life. So setting up the proportion:

1.5 cm / 5000 cm = x / 15,000 cm

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The model is smaller, so when real distance increases, model distance increases proportionally. So yes, the ratio should be model : real. So 1.5 cm on the model represents 5000 cm in real life.

So cross-multiplying: 1.5 * 15,000 = 5000 * x.

Calculating the left side: 1.5 * 15,000. Let's see, 15,000 * 1 is 15,000, and 15,000 * 0.5 is 7,500. So 15,000 + 7,500 = 22,500. So 22,500 = 5000 x.

Then, solving for x: x = 22,500 / 5000. Let me compute that. 5000 goes into 22,500 how many times? 5000 * 4 is 20,000. 22,500 - 20,000 is 2,500. 5000 goes into 2,500 half a time. So 4.5 times. So x is 4.5 centimeters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 4.5 centimeters. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, another approach: The scale is 1.5 cm per 50 meters. So 1.5 cm represents 50 m. So how much is 150 m? Let me divide 150 by 50 to find how many times the scale unit fits. 150 /50 = 3. So the model distance should be 3 times the scale. So 1.5 cm * 3 = 4.5 cm. Yep, same result. So definitely option F.
</think>

To determine the distance on the model, we start with the given scale: 1.5 cm (model) corresponds to 50 meters (real). Since 50 meters is equivalent to 5,000 centimeters, the scale ratio is 1.5 cm : 5,000 cm. 

The real distance between the two trees is 150 meters, which is 15,000 centimeters. Using the scale ratio, we set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{1.5}{5,000} = \frac{x}{15,000}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
1.5 \times 15,000 = 5,000 \times x
\]

\[
22,500 = 5,000x
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{22,500}{5,000} = 4.5 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the distance on the model is 4.5 centimeters, which corresponds to option F.
