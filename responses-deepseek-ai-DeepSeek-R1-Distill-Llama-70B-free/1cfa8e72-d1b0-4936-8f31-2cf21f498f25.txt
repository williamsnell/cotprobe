Question:

Alice owned Greyacre, a one-acre piece of property, in fee simple. Alice sold the property to Barbara who moved into the only residence on the land. Barbara neglected to record the deed, and three years later, Alice conveyed the same property to Charlene who immediately filed the deed she received from Alice. Greyacre's jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. If an action is filed for title to the property, the likely outcome would be for

Options:

A: Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.
B: Barbara, because she was the first to record her deed.
C: Alice, since she made two valid sales of the same property.
D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.
E: Barbara, due to her physical possession of the property.
F: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.
G: Charlene, because she relied on Alice's representation of ownership.
H: Alice, as she never actually transferred the property rights.
I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.
J: Charlene, because she was the last to receive the deed from Alice.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me start by breaking down the facts.

Alice owns Greyacre in fee simple. She sells it to Barbara, who moves in. But Barbara doesn't record the deed. Then, three years later, Alice sells the same property to Charlene, who does record her deed immediately. The jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system.

I remember that in property law, recording statutes determine the priority of deeds when there are multiple conveyances. There are different types of recording statutes: race, notice, and race-notice.

In a race jurisdiction, the first to record deed prevails, regardless of notice. In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who has no notice of prior unrecorded conveyances and records first wins. Race-notice combines both: to have priority, a purchaser must both record first and take without notice of prior unrecorded conveyances.

So here, the jurisdiction is race-notice. That means the later purchaser (Charlene) must record before the earlier purchaser (Barbara) records, and must have no notice of Barbara's prior claim.

But wait, Barbara didn't record at all. She took the deed but didn't record it. So when Charlene comes along, does she have notice of Barbara's deed?

Since it's a tract index system, I think the county records are organized by property. So when Charlene's attorney does a title search, they would look up Greyacre and see if there were any prior deeds recorded. But Barbara didn't record, so the tract index wouldn't show her deed. Therefore, when Charlene records, she has no notice because nothing was recorded before her.

Wait, but Barbara was in possession. Possession can be constructive notice. So if Charlene's attorney did a proper search, including checking for possession, they might have found that someone was living there. But I'm not sure if possession is enough to give constructive notice. I think in some jurisdictions, possession can put a subsequent purchaser on inquiry notice, meaning they should investigate further.

If Charlene had no actual or constructive notice, then under race-notice, she would prevail because she recorded first and without notice.

But wait, Barbara didn't record, so when Charlene records, she's the first to record. But under race-notice, the subsequent purchaser (Charlene) must both record first and have no notice. Since Barbara didn't record, Charlene's recording would be first. But does Charlene have notice because Barbara was in possession?

Possession can be a factor. If a buyer sees someone in possession, they might be expected to inquire about their rights. So if Charlene, when buying, saw Barbara living there, that could mean she had constructive notice. But the question doesn't say whether Charlene knew or had reason to know. It just says she recorded.

But in this case, Barbara didn't record, so the public records don't show her deed. So under a tract index system, a proper search wouldn't find Barbara's deed. But the possession might be a problem.

So if the jurisdiction considers possession as giving inquiry notice, then Charlene would be charged with knowing about Barbara's claim. But if the jurisdiction doesn't consider possession as sufficient, or if Charlene didn't actually know, then she might still have priority.

Alternatively, maybe because Barbara didn't record, she's not protected against a subsequent bona fide purchaser. So Charlene, as a subsequent purchaser who records first and without notice (because Barbara's deed wasn't recorded), would take priority.

Wait, in this case, Barbara is the first in time, but she didn't record. Charlene is second in time but recorded first. Under race-notice, the later purchaser must have both recorded first and have no notice.

So Barbara's deed was unrecorded when Charlene bought. So Charlene, if she had no notice, would take priority. But if she had notice (like from Barbara's possession), she wouldn't.

The question is whether possession gives Charlene notice. I think that's a key point.

Possession can be constructive notice. So if Charlene knew or should have known that someone else was in possession, she might be deemed to have notice. But if she didn't know and there was no inquiry, maybe she's still okay.

But since the question doesn't specify whether Charlene knew about Barbara's possession, I have to assume that she didn't have actual knowledge. But possession could still count as constructive notice, which would make Charlene's purchase with notice, thus she wouldn't be protected under the recording statute.

Wait, but in some cases, possession might not be enough. Like if the property is a rental, the buyer might not know who the owner is. But here, Barbara was the one in possession, and she's the prior purchaser.

So if Charlene's attorney did a title search and found nothing (since Barbara didn't record), but during inspection, saw Barbara living there, that would put them on notice to inquire. If they failed to do so, then Charlene might have constructive notice.

In that case, Charlene would have notice, so she doesn't qualify as a bona fide purchaser. Therefore, Barbara's prior unrecorded deed would take priority.

Wait, but the recording statute is race-notice, so Charlene must record first and have no notice. If she had notice, she doesn't meet the second part. So Barbara would win.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction gives priority to the first in time if the subsequent purchaser had notice, then Barbara would prevail.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Under race-notice statute:

- Later purchaser (Charlene) must:
  1. Take without notice of prior unrecorded deed (i.e., Barbara's).
  2. Record before the prior purchaser (Barbara) records.

In this case, Barbara didn't record, so her deed remains unrecorded. Charlene records first. But if Charlene had notice (from possession), she doesn't satisfy condition 1.

If Charlene didn't have notice, then she satisfies both conditions.

The question is whether possession gives notice. It's a factual issue but the question doesn't specify. So perhaps the exam expects us to consider that possession does not count as notice for the recording statute purposes without more.

Alternatively, in some jurisdictions, possession is considered notice. So the correct approach is that Barbara's possession is constructive notice to Charlene. Therefore, Charlene cannot be a bona fide purchaser because she had inquiry notice.

In that case, Charlene's recording doesn't help because she had notice. So Barbara's prior deed, even though unrecorded, would have priority.

Wait, but if Barbara's deed was never recorded, and Charlene records hers, but had notice, then under notice or race-notice, the earlier interest still wins.

So the likely outcome is that Barbara would have priority because Charlene had notice through possession.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's look at the answer options.

Looking at the options:

A: Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record. But Alice sold to Barbara, so she no longer owns. So A is incorrect.

B: Barbara, because she was the first to record. No, she didn't record. So B is incorrect.

C: Alice made two sales. No, she can't sell the same property twice; the first sale would have transferred ownership. So C is wrong.

D: Charlene, because she was first to record. But if she had notice, then she's not protected. So D may not be correct.

E: Barbara, due to possession. This could be the case if possession gives constructive notice, making Charlene's recording ineffective.

F: Barbara because Charlene had notice. This aligns with the idea that possession gives notice.

G: Charlene because she relied on Alice. But reliance isn't the key here; it's about notice.

H: Alice never transferred. No, she did transfer to Barbara, so H is wrong.

I: Charlene because Barbara didn't record. But if Charlene had notice, this wouldn't hold.

J: Charlene because she was last to get deed. The order matters, but recording and notice are the main points.

So the options are between E, F, I, and D.

In a race-notice state, Charlene must record first and have no notice. If she had notice from possession, then she doesn't satisfy the second condition, so Barbara's interest prevails.

Thus, the correct answer is either E or F.

Option E says Barbara prevails due to possession. Option F says Barbara prevails because Charlene had notice.

Which is more accurate? In a race-notice statute, the subsequent purchaser (Charlene) must have both recorded first and have no notice. If Charlene had notice (from possession), she doesn't meet the second condition. So the correct reason is F.

Wait, but option F says "Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara." So if possession counts as notice, then F is correct.

I think the correct answer is F: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance.

Wait, but how would Charlene know about the conveyance? She might know someone is in possession, but not the conveyance. So maybe she has inquiry notice, not actual notice of the prior deed.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is E, possession gives Barbara priority. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the tract index system: when Charlene records, she's the first to record. But if she had notice, she can't claim protection.

So the likely outcome is that Barbara wins because Charlene had notice. So option F.

Wait, but without more facts, perhaps the default is that possession is constructive notice, so F is the answer.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction's recording statute doesn't consider possession as notice, then Charlene wins. But I think traditionally, possession is considered notice.

So I think the answer is either E or F. But looking at the options again:

Option E: Barbara, due to her physical possession.

Option F: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance.

I think the better answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the correct reasoning is that under a race-notice statute, since Barbara didn't record, and Charlene recorded first but had notice, Barbara's deed is protected.

Wait, perhaps another approach. In a race-notice jurisdiction, a later purchaser must both record first and take without notice. So if Charlene recorded first, but had notice, then she doesn't meet the second condition, so Barbara's interest is protected.

So Barbara would win because Charlene had notice. Thus, option F.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction considers possession as notice, then Charlene had notice. So F is correct.

Wait, but the options don't clarify whether Charlene actually knew. So perhaps we have to assume that she didn't have actual notice, but possession gives constructive notice.

In that case, F is correct.

So the answer would be F.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

F: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.

E: Barbara, due to her physical possession.

Possession can put a purchaser on inquiry notice, meaning they should inquire about the interest. So it's constructive notice, not actual notice of the prior conveyance.

So perhaps the reason is E, because possession gives Barbara priority, regardless of recording.

Wait, but the recording statute determines priority. Possession is a factor in notice.

So perhaps the correct answer is E, giving Barbara priority because she was in possession, which under the statute would mean that Charlene cannot be a bona fide purchaser.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: Charlene, because Barbara didn't record. But that would ignore the notice aspect.

Wait, the options again:

I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.

If Barbara didn't record, and Charlene records, but had notice, then Barbara's deed is prior. So I would be incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: under a race-notice statute, the subsequent purchaser (Charlene) must (1) take without notice and (2) record first. If she satisfies both, she prevails.

In this case, Barbara didn't record, so Charlene records first. But if Charlene had notice from possession, then condition (1) is not met, so Barbara's interest prevails.

Thus, Barbara wins because Charlene had notice.

So the answer is F.

Wait, but the question is about the outcome. So the likely outcome is that Barbara would win, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance.

So the correct answer is F.

The question revolves around a race-notice jurisdiction, where the priority of deeds is determined by whether a purchaser records first and takes without notice of any prior unrecorded conveyances. Alice sold Greyacre to Barbara, who did not record her deed but took possession. Three years later, Alice sold the property to Charlene, who recorded her deed immediately. The jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system.

Under a race-notice statute, a subsequent purchaser (Charlene) must (1) record first and (2) take without notice of any prior unrecorded conveyances to prevail. Barbara, as the first purchaser, did not record her deed, but her physical possession of the property could constitute constructive notice to Charlene. Constructive notice arises when a subsequent purchaser is put on inquiry due to circumstances like possession, even if they do not have actual knowledge of the prior conveyance.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, H, J**: Incorrect because they incorrectly focus on Alice's ownership or Charlene's status as the last to receive the deed, ignoring the recording statute and Barbara's prior claim.
- **B, D, I**: Incorrect because they focus on recording without addressing the notice requirement. Barbara did not record, but her possession could affect Charlene's status as a bona fide purchaser.
- **E**: Suggests Barbara prevails due to possession, which is plausible, but the better reasoning is that possession gives Charlene constructive notice of Barbara's prior conveyance.
- **F**: Correct because it directly addresses that Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance (through Barbara's possession), preventing her from qualifying as a bona fide purchaser under the race-notice statute. As a result, Barbara's interest prevails.

Thus, the likely outcome is that Barbara wins because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance, making **F** the correct answer.

Answer: F
