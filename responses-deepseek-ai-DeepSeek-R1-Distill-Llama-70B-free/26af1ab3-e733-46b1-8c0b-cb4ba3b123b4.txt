Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What is differential reproduction? What factors bring about differential reproduction?

Options:

A: Differential reproduction is the result of equal survival rates for all genotypes within a population
B: Differential reproduction is driven exclusively by the presence of predators in an ecosystem
C: Differential reproduction occurs when certain traits prevent any mating from happening
D: Differential reproduction is when genetic mutations are the only factor influencing which offspring survive
E: Differential reproduction is purely based on random mating
F: Differential reproduction is determined solely by the environmental temperature during breeding seasons
G: Differential reproduction is related to the physical strength of the species
H: Differential reproduction is when all offsprings have the same genotype
I: Differential reproduction occurs when the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating. It results from nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or differences in zygote viability or offspring fertility.
J: Differential reproduction occurs when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parental genotypes

Okay, so I've got this question about differential reproduction and the factors that cause it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biology terms, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that differential reproduction has something to do with natural selection. It's about how some individuals reproduce more successfully than others. So it's not just about surviving, but about passing on their genes.

Looking at the options, I need to find the correct definition and the factors. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says it's the result of equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no, if survival rates are equal, that wouldn't lead to differential reproduction. Because differential reproduction implies some are more successful in reproducing than others. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B claims it's driven exclusively by predators. I don't think that's right because there are other factors too, like environmental factors, mate choice, etc. So B is too narrow.

Option C says certain traits prevent any mating. That sounds more like reproductive isolation, maybe leading to no mating at all. But differential reproduction is about some reproducing more than others, not necessarily preventing mating entirely. So C might not be correct.

Option D attributes it solely to genetic mutations. That doesn't seem right because differential reproduction can be due to various factors like environmental selection pressures, not just mutations.

Option E mentions random mating. But differential reproduction would imply non-random factors influencing reproduction success, so E is probably wrong.

Option F says it's only environmental temperature. That seems too specific. There are multiple factors, not just temperature.

Option G relates to physical strength. While strength might play a role in some cases, it's not the only or main factor driving differential reproduction universally.

Option H states all offspring have the same genotype. That doesn't make sense because differential reproduction suggests variation in reproductive success based on different traits or genotypes.

Option I says it's when the percentage of viable offspring can't be explained by random mating, due to nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or differences in viability or fertility. That sounds right because those factors influence how many offspring each genotype produces.

Option J talks about random inheritance of traits. That's more about genetics but doesn't address the differential aspect related to reproduction success.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I. It correctly explains that differential reproduction isn't random and arises from factors like nonrandom mating or differing viability.

The correct answer is:

I: Differential reproduction occurs when the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating. It results from nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or differences in zygote viability or offspring fertility.

Answer: I
