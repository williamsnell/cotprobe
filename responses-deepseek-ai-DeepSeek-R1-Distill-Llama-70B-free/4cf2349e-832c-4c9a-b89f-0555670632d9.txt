Okay, so I have this economics question here about how a recession in Japan affects U.S. exports, the demand for the dollar, and the value of the dollar relative to the yen. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

First, the question says Japan's economy is in a prolonged recession, which means their household incomes are probably going down. Lower incomes in Japan would likely affect how much they can spend on imports, right? So if Japanese people have less money, they might buy fewer imported goods, including those from the U.S. That means U.S. exports to Japan would decrease. So for the first part, EXPORTS TO JAPAN, it's a decrease.

Next, thinking about the demand for the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. exports goods to Japan, Japanese businesses need to pay in dollars. So if U.S. exports decrease, Japanese businesses don't need as many dollars as before. So the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market should decrease. Wait, but wait. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. When U.S. goods are exported to Japan, the buyers (Japanese) need dollars to pay for them. So if exports fall, the demand for dollars from Japanese importers would fall. So the demand for the dollar in forex markets would decrease. So that's the second part—DEMAND FOR $, which would decrease.

Now, the third part is the value of the dollar relative to the yen. If the demand for dollars decreases, what happens to the exchange rate? Well, if fewer people want dollars, the value of the dollar would go down relative to the yen. Because if demand is lower, the yen would strengthen against the dollar. So the value of the dollar (like how many yen per dollar) would decrease. Wait, but wait another thing. Or does a lower demand for dollars cause the dollar to depreciate? Let me clarify: In forex, if the demand for dollars drops, the dollar becomes weaker. So the value of the dollar relative to the yen would go down, meaning the yen appreciates.

Putting it all together:

EXPORTS TO JAPAN: Decrease
DEMAND FOR $: Decrease
VALUE OF $: Decrease

Wait, but looking at the options, is there an option that matches this? Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option G: Decrease, Decrease, Decrease. That fits what I thought.

Option I is Decrease, Decrease, Increase. No, because the value should decrease.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the exchange rate. So when the dollar's value relative to the yen decreases, that means a weaker dollar. So the yen becomes stronger. So for example, if previously 1 USD = 100 yen, now maybe 1 USD = 90 yen. So the dollar is worth less yen, so its value relative to yen has decreased.

So the third part is a decrease. So the correct option would be where all three are decrease. Which is option G.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't get confused between demand for dollars and the value. So, if U.S. exports drop, Japanese need fewer dollars. So demand for dollars goes down. Lower demand for dollars leads to a lower value of the dollar. So yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, some might think that a weaker dollar makes U.S. goods cheaper, which could boost exports. But that's a different scenario. In this question, the driver is the Japanese recession, leading to lower incomes, which directly reduces their imports, regardless of exchange rates. So the initial effect is a decrease in exports, leading to lower demand for dollars and a weaker dollar.

When the Japanese economy experiences a prolonged recession, household incomes decline, leading to reduced purchasing power. This results in decreased demand for imported goods, including U.S. exports to Japan. Consequently, U.S. exports to Japan decrease.

As U.S. exports to Japan decline, Japanese businesses require fewer dollars to pay for these imports. This reduces the demand for the U.S. dollar in the foreign exchange market.

With lower demand for the dollar, its value relative to the yen decreases. This means the dollar depreciates, and the yen appreciates in value.

Thus, the effects are as follows:
- **EXPORTS TO JAPAN**: Decrease
- **DEMAND FOR $**: Decrease
- **VALUE OF $**: Decrease

The correct option is **G: Decrease, Decrease, Decrease**.

Answer: G
