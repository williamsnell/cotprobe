Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .

Okay, so I have this question about a passage from "The Book of Routes and Realms" by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri. The question is asking for evidence that Ghanians were engaged in trade with Asia, either directly or indirectly. The options are from A to J.

First, I'll read the passage again to pick up any clues related to trade with Asia. The passage describes the city of Ghana with two towns, one inhabited by Muslims. There are mosques, imams, and scholars. The king's interpreters, treasury officials, and ministers are mostly Muslims. Only the king can wear sewn clothes; others wear cotton, silk, or brocade robes. The king wears necklaces and bracelets, sits in a pavilion with horses around. People of the same religion as the king greet by dusting their heads, while Muslims clap hands.

The king levies taxes on salt, copper, and other goods. Nuggets from mines go to the king, and people use gold dust. There's another kingdom called Malal where the king was Muslim but the people were polytheists, and the rulers are called al-musulmani.

Looking for evidence of trade with Asia, I should think about what items or influences might come from Asia. Asia is a big place, so considering regions like the Middle East, India, China, etc.

Option A: The king had adopted the Chinese kow-tow. The passage says that people of the same religion as the king fall on their knees and sprinkle dust, while Muslims clap. That's a different greeting, not sure if it's kow-tow. Kow-tow is a Chinese tradition, but the passage doesn't mention anything about bowing like that. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option B: Vegetables being Asian in origin. The passage says they have wells and grow vegetables, but it doesn’t specify the origin of the vegetables. So maybe not B.

Option C: Horses from the Mongols. The passage mentions ten horses around the pavilion. Horses can come from various places, including North Africa or other regions. The Mongols were in Asia, but the text doesn't specify the origin of the horses. So C is possible, but not certain.

Option D: Nuggets from mines hinting at Asian miners. The passage says nuggets are reserved for the king, but it doesn’t link this to trade with Asia. It seems more about local mining.

Option E: Paying taxes in gold. They do collect taxes, but gold in West Africa was common, especially in the Ghana Empire. It doesn't directly indicate trade with Asia, just that they had gold.

Option F: King adorned with gold and jewels from India. The passage says he wears necklaces and bracelets, but doesn't specify where the materials came from. India is a possibility, but it's not stated.

Option G: People wore silk robes. Silk is a major Asian product, especially from China via the Silk Road. If they're wearing silk, that suggests trade with Asia since silk production was mainly in Asia. So G looks promising.

Option H: Wells with sweet water using Asian irrigation. The passage mentions wells but doesn’t link the techniques to Asia. Maybe, but not strong evidence.

Option I: Muslim ministers suggesting Middle East trade. Muslims in Ghana would imply trade or cultural exchange with the Middle East, which is part of Asia. So I is a strong possibility.

Option J: Jewelry made of Asian materials. Again, the materials' origin isn't specified, so it's possible but not certain.

So the strongest options are G and I. G talks about wearing silk, which is an Asian product. I mentions Muslim ministers, indicating contact with Muslim-majority areas in Asia (Middle East, etc.), which would involve trade.

The question asks for evidence of trade. Dressing in silk would suggest that they were importing silk, likely from Asia. Similarly, having Muslim ministers suggests trade routes with Muslim regions, which are in Asia.

So which options are more directly pointing to trade? Both G and I are good, but looking at the options, the question is about trade with Asia. So G is about wearing silk robes, which would come from Asia via trade. I is about Muslim officials, which indicates cultural and possibly trade connections.

So the correct options would be either G or I. Let me check the options again.

The question is which option provides evidence. So both G and I are possible. But the answer choices only allow one option.

Wait, looking back, the passage says that "All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means." So silk and brocade are mentioned, which are typically from Asia, especially the Middle East and China.

Silk was a major trade item along the Silk Road, which connects to Asia. So G is a good indication of trade with Asia.

Similarly, I says the king's ministers are Muslims, suggesting contact with Muslim regions, which are in Asia (Middle East and beyond). So I is also a good indicator.

But the question is about trade, not just cultural influence. So both could be evidence. But which one is more directly about trade?

Silk robes would be a traded commodity, so G is about trade. I is about people's religion, which could come through trade or other means like migration or conversion.

So the answer would include both G and I as possible, but looking at the options, which one is present.

Wait, looking at the options, both G and I are present. So which one is the correct answer?

The question is which option is correct. Since the passage mentions both wearing silk and having Muslim officials, both G and I are evidence. But the options are separate.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the user is to select one. So I need to choose between G and I.

The question is about direct or indirect evidence of trade with Asia. So G: wearing silk robes implies that they are importing silk, which would come from Asia via trade routes. Similarly, I: having Muslim ministers suggests trade with Muslim areas in Asia.

So both are correct, but the options are separate. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

G: The people in his court wore silk robes.

I: The king's ministers were Muslims, suggesting trade with the Middle East.

So both are correct, but which one is the better answer?

In the context of the question, the passage also mentions the king's ministers are Muslims, which suggests influence from the Middle East, which is part of Asia. So I is also a valid answer.

Wait, but the question is about trade. So G is more about trade of goods, while I is more about cultural or religious influence, which could result from trade but isn't direct evidence of trade. So G might be a stronger indicator of trade.

So the answer is G and I? But the options are separate.

Wait, the options are A to J, each being a separate choice. So in the answer, only one is correct.

Looking back at the question, it's a multiple-choice with one correct answer. So I need to pick the best option.

Silk robes (G) and Muslim ministers (I) are both indicators, but which one is more directly about trade.

Silk is a traded commodity, so G points to trade in goods. I points to cultural/religious ties, which may result from trade but isn't direct evidence.

Thus, the best answer would be G: The people in his court wore silk robes.

Wait, but another thought: the passage says that the king's ministers are Muslims, which suggests that there were trade connections with Muslim regions, which are in Asia. So I is also a strong candidate.

Alternatively, maybe both G and I are correct, but the options don't allow choosing both. So which one is the intended answer.

I think both G and I are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, looking again, the passage says that the king's interpreters, treasury officials, and majority of ministers are Muslims. So having Muslim officials in the court suggests that there was interaction, possibly through trade, with Muslim regions in Asia.

So I think both G and I are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, the options are from A to J, each being a single choice. So only one can be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G and I, but the options don't allow that. So I need to choose the best one.

I think the intended answer is G because silk is a traded good from Asia, so it's direct evidence of trade. I is about people, which is more about cultural exchange facilitated by trade, but not direct evidence of trade.

So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but another point: the passage mentions that the nuggets are reserved for the king, only gold dust for people. But that's about internal mining, not trade.

So, the best evidence is G: wearing silk robes, which would have been imported from Asia via trade routes.

So I think the answer is G.

The question asks for evidence that Ghanians were engaged in trade with Asia, either directly or indirectly. The passage provides several clues that can be analyzed to determine the correct answer.

- **Option A**: The passage describes a greeting where people fall on their knees and sprinkle dust, but this is not explicitly linked to the Chinese kow-tow tradition. Thus, A is not supported by the text.
- **Option B**: While vegetables are mentioned, their origin is not specified, so B is not a strong indicator of trade with Asia.
- **Option C**: Horses are mentioned, but their origin is not tied to the Mongols or Asia. This makes C speculative.
- **Option D**: The passage discusses gold nuggets being reserved for the king, but this pertains to local mining, not trade with Asia.
- **Option E**: Paying taxes in gold indicates wealth but does not directly point to trade with Asia, as gold was abundant in West Africa.
- **Option F**: The king's adornment with gold and jewels is mentioned, but the origin of these materials is not specified, making F uncertain.
- **Option G**: The passage explicitly states that people wore silk robes. Silk was a major trade item from Asia, particularly via the Silk Road, making this a strong indicator of trade with Asia.
- **Option H**: The mention of wells with sweet water does not link to Asian irrigation techniques, so H is not supported.
- **Option I**: The presence of Muslim ministers suggests cultural or religious ties to Muslim-majority regions in Asia, which could result from trade. However, this is more about cultural influence than direct trade evidence.
- **Option J**: The king's jewelry is mentioned, but the materials' origin is not specified, making J uncertain.

The strongest evidence of trade with Asia comes from **Option G**, as silk robes directly indicate the importation of a traded commodity from Asia. While Option I suggests cultural ties, it is less directly tied to trade. Therefore, the best answer is **G: The people in his court wore silk robes.**

Answer: G
