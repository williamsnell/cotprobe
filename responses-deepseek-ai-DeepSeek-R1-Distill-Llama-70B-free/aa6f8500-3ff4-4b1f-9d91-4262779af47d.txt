Okay, I have this problem about calculating the equilibrium constant Kp for the dissociation of Cl2 at 1200 K using statistical thermodynamics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The reaction is Cl2(g) dissociating into 2Cl(g). I remember that the equilibrium constant can be calculated using the partition functions of the reactants and products. The formula I think is K = (Q_products)/(Q_reactants), raised to some powers based on stoichiometry. But wait, since we're dealing with Kp, it's in terms of pressure. Oh right, I think the formula involves the ratio of the partition functions.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. I recall that for diatomic gases, the partition function includes translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic contributions. Oh right, but for this problem, maybe we can neglect the electronic partition function since the electronic states might not contribute much here. So let's focus on translational, rotational, and vibrational.

So for Cl2, the partition function q(Cl2) would be q_trans * q_rot * q_vib. And for each Cl atom, since it's an atom, the partition function q(Cl) would be q_trans * q_elec, but wait, maybe rotational isn't a factor for atoms? Or do atoms have rotational modes too? Wait, no, atoms are spherical, so maybe rotational partition function is just 1. Or wait, no, atoms can have electronic states, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the electronic contribution is considered as 1. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Wait, the problem gives me the dissociation energy, which is 2.48 eV. I think that's the energy required to break the Cl-Cl bond. Oh right, so the bond dissociation energy D0 is 2.48 eV. I think that's important for calculating the vibrational partition function, because the vibrational energy levels are quantized.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Temperature T = 1200 K
- Internuclear distance r = 0.199 nm = 0.199e-10 m (but maybe I don't need this directly)
- Fundamental vibration frequency ν̃ = 565 cm^-1
- Dissociation energy D0 = 2.48 eV

I think the key steps are:
1. Calculate the vibrational partition function for Cl2.
2. Calculate the rotational partition function for Cl2.
3. Calculate the translational partition functions for Cl2 and Cl.
4. Combine these into the overall partition functions for Cl2 and Cl.
5. Use the formula K = ( [q_Cl]^2 ) / [q_Cl2 * (sqrt(T)) ] ? Wait, no, I need to get the formula right.

Wait, no. The general expression for Kp is (P_Cl)^2 / (P_Cl2). But in terms of partition functions, I think it's:

Kp = ( (q_Cl^trans * q_Cl^rot * q_Cl^elec)^2 ) / (q_Cl2^trans * q_Cl2^rot * q_Cl2^vib * q_Cl2^elec) ) * (something with temperature?)

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ideal gas partition function. The partition function for each substance is q = q_trans * q_rot * q_vib * q_elec.

But for atoms, like Cl, the rotational partition function might be 1, as they don't rotate like diatomic molecules. Wait, no, I think atoms can have rotational modes, but for monatomic gases, the rotational partition function is actually just 1, or maybe it's taken into account differently. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, I remember that the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of a diatomic molecule into atoms can be approximated using the Saha equation, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the high-temperature approximation where the vibrational modes are treated classically.

Wait, but let's try to proceed systematically.

First, let's think about the translational partition function. The translational partition function for a gas is given by:

q_trans = ( (2 π m k T )^(3/2) ) / h^3 ) * V

But since we're dealing with Kp, which is in terms of pressure, I think the volume will cancel out. Alternatively, sometimes the translational partition function is expressed in terms of pressure via the ideal gas law. Maybe I should think in terms of the translational partition function per unit volume, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium constant Kp can be written as:

Kp = ( (P_Cl)^2 ) / P_Cl2

And each partial pressure is related to the partition function via P = (k T) / (λ^3) ) * q, where λ is the thermal wavelength. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some terms here.

Alternatively, I remember that for a reaction aA(g) + bB(g) → cC(g) + dD(g), the equilibrium constant Kp is given by:

Kp = ( (q_C)^c (q_D)^d ) / ( (q_A)^a (q_B)^b ) ) * (P^o)^{Δn} )

Where Δn = c + d - a - b, and P^o is the standard pressure (usually 1 atm or 1 bar). But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the relation between Kp and the partition functions. The formula for Kp is:

Kp = ( (Q_Cl)^2 ) / (Q_Cl2) ) * e^{-ΔE/(RT)} }

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another formula I recall is:

Kp = ( ( (2 π m k T / h^2 )^{3/2} )^2 ) / ( (2 π M k T / h^2 )^{3/2} ) * [rotational factors] * [vibrational factors] )

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should break it down into parts.

Let me start by considering the translational contributions. For Cl2, the translational partition function per molecule is q_trans(Cl2) = (2 π M k T / h^2 )^(3/2) * V, where M is the molar mass of Cl2. For each Cl atom, q_trans(Cl) = (2 π m k T / h^2 )^(3/2) * V, where m is the atomic mass.

But when considering the ratio for the reaction, the V terms will cancel out because they're in both numerator and denominator. So in Kp, the translational contributions will give a factor of [ (q_trans(Cl))^2 ] / q_trans(Cl2).

So let's compute that.

First, M_Cl2 = 2 * M_Cl. M_Cl is the atomic mass of Cl. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.45 g/mol, so M_Cl = 35.45e-3 kg/mol. So M_Cl2 = 70.90e-3 kg/mol.

Wait, but I can write the ratio of the translational partition functions as:

(q_trans(Cl))^2 / q_trans(Cl2) = [ (2 π m k T / h^2 )^(3/2) )^2 ] / [ (2 π M k T / h^2 )^(3/2) ) ]

Since m is the mass of a Cl atom, and M is m*2 (since M_Cl2 is 2*m). So substituting M = 2m:

= [ (2 π m k T / h^2 )^3 ] / [ (2 π (2m) k T / h^2 )^(3/2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (2 π m k T / h^2 )^3
Denominator: (2 π * 2m k T / h^2 )^(3/2 )

So the ratio becomes:

( (2 π m k T / h^2 )^3 ) / ( (2 π 2m k T / h^2 )^(3/2) ) )
= (2 π m k T / h^2 )^(3 - 3/2) ) * (1/(2m)^{3/2}) )
Wait, perhaps a better approach is to factor out the terms.

The ratio can be written as:

( (m/(2m))^{3/2} ) * ( (2 π k T / h^2 )^3 ) / ( (2 π k T / h^2 )^(3/2) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's compute the ratio as:

(q_trans(Cl))^2 / q_trans(Cl2) = [ (2 π m k T / h^2 )^(3/2) * V ]^2 / [ (2 π M k T / h^2 )^(3/2) * V ]

The V terms cancel, so:

= [ (2 π m k T / h^2 )^3 ] / [ (2 π M k T / h^2 )^(3/2) ) ]

M is 2m, so substituting:

= [ (2 π m k T / h^2 )^3 ] / [ (2 π 2m k T / h^2 )^(3/2) ) ]

= (2 π m k T / h^2 )^(3) * (2 π 2m k T / h^2 )^(-3/2)

Factor out (2 π k T / h^2 ):

= (2 π k T / h^2 )^(3 - 3/2) ) * (m^3) * ( (2m)^{-3/2} )

Simplify exponents:

3 - 3/2 = 3/2

So:

= (2 π k T / h^2 )^(3/2) ) * (m^3) / ( (2m)^(3/2) ) )

Simplify m terms:

m^3 / (2^(3/2) m^(3/2) )) ) = m^(3 - 3/2) / 2^(3/2) ) = m^(3/2) / 2^(3/2)

So overall:

(q_trans(Cl))^2 / q_trans(Cl2) = (2 π k T / h^2 )^(3/2) ) * (m^(3/2) ) / (2^(3/2)) )

But m is the mass of a Cl atom. Let me compute the numerical value.

Wait, but perhaps I can use molar masses and express everything in terms of per mole, but it might get complicated. Alternatively, let's plug in the constants.

Let me recall the values of the constants:

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s
k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K
T = 1200 K

m (Cl atom) = atomic mass of Cl * (1 g/mol) * (1 kg / 1000 g) ) * (1 mol / Avogadro's number)
Wait, atomic mass of Cl is about 35.45 g/mol, so m = (35.45e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 mol^-1)
So m = 35.45e-3 / 6.022e23 = approx 5.89e-26 kg.

Wait, let's compute m:

m = (35.45 g/mol) * (1 kg / 1000 g) ) * (1 / 6.022e23 atoms/mol)
= 35.45e-3 kg/mol * 1 / 6.022e23 mol^-1
= 35.45e-3 / 6.022e23 = approx 5.89e-26 kg.

Now compute (2 π k T / h^2 ):

Let me compute each part:

2 π k T = 2 * π * 1.38e-23 J/K * 1200 K
= 2 * 3.1416 * 1.38e-23 * 1200
≈ 6.2832 * 1.656e-20
≈ 1.04e-19 J

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s²

So (2 π k T / h^2 ) = 1.04e-19 J / 4.39e-67 J²·s² → Wait, no, units don't match. Wait, actually, h^2 has units (J·s)^2, and 2 π k T has units J, so 2 π k T / h^2 has units J / (J²·s²) ) → 1/(J·s²), which seems off. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the translational partition function in terms of the thermal wavelength.

The thermal wavelength λ is h / sqrt(2 π m k T). So the translational partition function per unit volume is (1/λ^3).

Wait, yes, another approach: the translational partition function per molecule is q_trans = V / λ^3, where λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k T).

So for Cl2, q_trans(Cl2) = V / λ_Cl2^3, and for each Cl, q_trans(Cl) = V / λ_Cl^3.

So the ratio [ (q_trans(Cl))^2 ] / q_trans(Cl2) = [ (V/λ_Cl^3)^2 ] / (V/λ_Cl2^3 ) ) = V (λ_Cl2^3) / (λ_Cl^6 )

Wait, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can relate λ_Cl and λ_Cl2.

Since λ is inversely proportional to sqrt(m), we have λ_Cl2 = λ_Cl / sqrt(2), because M_Cl2 = 2 M_Cl → m_Cl2 = 2 m_Cl.

So λ_Cl2 = h / sqrt(2 π (2m_Cl) k T ) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * [ h / sqrt(2 π m_Cl k T) ) ] = λ_Cl / sqrt(2)

So λ_Cl2 = λ_Cl / sqrt(2)

So substituting back into the ratio:

[ (q_trans(Cl))^2 ] / q_trans(Cl2) = V ( (λ_Cl / sqrt(2))^3 ) / ( (λ_Cl)^6 )

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, the ratio is [ (q_Cl)^2 ] / q_Cl2 = [ (V/λ_Cl^3)^2 ] / (V/λ_Cl2^3 ) )

= V^2 / λ_Cl^6 * λ_Cl2^3 / V

= V * ( λ_Cl2^3 ) / ( λ_Cl^6 )

But since λ_Cl2 = λ_Cl / sqrt(2),

λ_Cl2^3 = (λ_Cl^3 ) / (2^(3/2)) )

So substituting:

V * ( (λ_Cl^3 ) / 2^(3/2) ) / ( λ_Cl^6 )

= V * (1) / ( 2^(3/2) * λ_Cl^3 )

But from q_trans(Cl) = V / λ_Cl^3, so 1/λ_Cl^3 = q_trans(Cl) / V.

Thus,

= V * [ (q_trans(Cl) / V ) ] / 2^(3/2 )

= ( q_trans(Cl) ) / 2^(3/2 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of molar concentrations, but perhaps it's better to move on and see if the vibrational and rotational contributions are more straightforward.

Next, the rotational partition function for Cl2. For a diatomic molecule, the rotational partition function is q_rot = (8 π^2 (k T) / (2 h-bar^2))^{} ) * I, where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, I think for a diatomic, the high-temperature rotational partition function is q_rot = (T / Θ_rot )^(3/2), but wait no, that's for linear molecules. Wait, actually, the rotational partition function for a diatomic is q_rot = (8 π^2 (k T) / (2 h-bar^2 σ)) )^{1/2} * (I), but I might be getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, the rotational partition function for a diatomic is often approximated as q_rot = (k T / (σ Θ_rot )) ), where Θ_rot is the rotational temperature and σ is the symmetry number. For Cl2, which is a homonuclear diatomic, σ=2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the rotational partition function is given by q_rot = (T^3 ) / (Θ_rot^3 ) ) * something, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe the rotational temperature Θ_rot is given by Θ_rot = (h^2 * (8 π^2) ) / (2 I k ), where I is the moment of inertia.

Given that the internuclear distance r is 0.199 nm, so I = μ r^2, where μ is the reduced mass. For Cl2, μ = (m_Cl * m_Cl) / (2 m_Cl) ) = m_Cl / 2.

So I = (m_Cl / 2 ) * (0.199e-10 m )^2.

Let me compute I:

m_Cl is 35.45 g/mol = 0.03545 kg/mol. So per molecule, m_Cl = 0.03545 / (6.022e23) kg ≈ 5.89e-26 kg.

Thus, I = (5.89e-26 kg / 2 ) * (0.199e-10 m )^2

Compute that:

(5.89e-26 / 2) = 2.945e-26 kg

(0.199e-10)^2 = (0.199)^2 * 1e-20 = 0.0396 * 1e-20 = 3.96e-22 m²

So I = 2.945e-26 kg * 3.96e-22 m² = 1.168e-47 kg·m²

Now, Θ_rot = (h^2 * 8 π^2 ) / (2 I k )

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s²

8 π^2 ≈ 78.96

I = 1.168e-47 kg·m²

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

Putting it all together:

Θ_rot
