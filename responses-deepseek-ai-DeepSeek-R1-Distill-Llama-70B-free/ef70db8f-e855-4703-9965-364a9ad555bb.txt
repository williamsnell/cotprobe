Okay, so I have this question about the main purpose of licensing public relations practitioners. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think through it.

First, what do I know about licensing in general? Licensing usually serves to regulate who can enter a profession. It often involves meeting certain standards, like education, exams, or experience. The idea is to ensure that practitioners are competent and ethical.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Achieve better wages. I'm not sure. Licensing can sometimes lead to higher wages because it limits supply, but is that the main purpose? Probably not the primary reason.

Option B: Create an elite group. Maybe, but that's more of a side effect. The main purpose is likely more about standards than exclusivity.

Option C: Regulate access to posts. That sounds right. Licensing would control who can work in the field by setting entry requirements.

Option D: Mandate continued education. Some licenses require ongoing education, but is that the main purpose? Maybe a secondary effect.

Option E: Increase government control. I don't think PR licensing is mainly about government control. It's more about professional standards.

Option F: Revenue for organizations. That could be a benefit for the organizations issuing licenses, but not the main purpose.

Option G: Preserve society's well-being. That's a broader goal. Licensing might contribute by ensuring competent practitioners, but is that the main reason?

Option H: Inflate service costs. Similar to A, it's a possible outcome but not the main purpose.

Option I: Limit competition. Licensing can limit competition by restricting entry, but again, is that the main intent?

Wait, the main purpose of licensing is usually to protect the public by ensuring only qualified individuals practice. So it's about regulating access to the profession, which would be option C. Or is it more about protecting society (option G)?

Hmm, maybe G is too broad. The direct purpose is to regulate who can enter the field, ensuring they meet certain standards. So C makes sense as the main purpose.
