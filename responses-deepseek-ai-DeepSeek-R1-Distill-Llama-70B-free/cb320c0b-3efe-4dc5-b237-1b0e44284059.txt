Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about saliva and the enzyme it contains. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which nutrient saliva's enzyme acts upon. The options are Water, Starches, Sugars, Amino acids, Proteins, Vitamins, Carbohydrates, Fiber, Minerals, and Fats.

I remember that saliva is involved in the digestion process. I think the enzyme in saliva is called amylase. What does amylase do? Oh right, it breaks down carbohydrates. But wait, I should be more specific. I think it specifically targets starches. Because starch is a type of carbohydrate, so maybe the answer is either B or G.

Looking at the options, B is Starches and G is Carbohydrates. So which one is it? Well, the enzyme amylase breaks down starch into sugars, right? So the enzyme acts on starches, which are a subset of carbohydrates.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes these questions can be tricky. For example, if the question is about the broader category, then maybe G is correct. But I think the enzyme specifically targets starches. Because proteins are broken down by different enzymes, like pepsin in the stomach, not in saliva. Fats are broken down by lipase, which I think is more in the pancreas.

So in the mouth, the enzyme is amylase, and it breaks down starches. So the answer should be B: Starches.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is Carbohydrates. Since starch is a carbohydrate, maybe the answer is G. But I think the enzyme specifically acts on starches, which are a type of carbohydrate. So the question is whether the answer is more specific or broader.

The question says, "which of the following nutrients?" So the options are different types of nutrients. Starch is a carbohydrate, but the enzyme targets it specifically. So the correct answer would be B, Starches, because that's the specific substrate of salivary amylase.

Alternatively, maybe the broader category is considered correct. Let me think again. Carbohydrates include sugars, starches, and fibers. Amylase works on starches, not on sugars or fibers. So if the question is about the enzyme's action, the correct answer is B.

Yes, I'm pretty confident the answer is B: Starches.

The enzyme in saliva is salivary amylase, which specifically breaks down starches into simpler sugars. While starches are a subset of carbohydrates, the enzyme acts directly on starches, making the most accurate answer B.

Answer: B
