Okay, so I have this problem about Mr. Firestone signing a note for a loan, and I need to find out the proceeds after the note is discounted at a bank. Hmm, let me think step by step.

So, the note is for $1,250, and it's a 90-day note signed on October 10, 1976. Then, on November 15, 1976, Ace Lending Company discounts it at a bank at a rate of 6 and a half percent. I need to find the proceeds Ace gets from this transaction.

Wait, discounting a note... I remember that when a note is discounted, the bank essentially buys it at a discount, so they pay the present value, and the face value is paid at maturity. The discount is based on the interest rate and the time remaining until the note matures.

So first, I should figure out how much time is left on the note from November 15 to when it's due. The note was signed on October 10, and it's a 90-day note. So the due date would be January 8, 1977 (since October has 31 days, so 31-10=21 days left in October; 90-21=69 days remaining starting Nov 1. So November has 30 days, which brings us to Dec 1, then 39 days in December. Wait, wait, let me count that again.

Wait, October 10: the note is for 90 days. So day 1 is October 11. Let me count the days properly.

From October 10 to October 31: that's 21 days (including the 10th? No, because the note starts on the 10th, so from the 10th to the 31st is 21 days). So 90 days would take us to January 8, 1977 (because 21 in October, 30 in November, and 30 in December: 21+30+30=81. Wait, 90 days from Oct 10: October 10 is day 0, so day 90 would be January 8. Because 21 days in October, 30 in November, 30 in December? Wait, 21+30=51, plus another 30 is 81, which is 9 days short of 90. Oh wait, no, maybe I should calculate it differently.

Wait, perhaps using the 360-day year method for calculating the discount, since this is a common method in such problems. So the formula for discount is: 

Discount = (Principal × Rate × Time)/360

Then the proceeds would be Principal minus Discount.

So first, calculate the time between November 15 and the maturity date, which is January 8, 1977.

Wait, November 15 to November 30 is 15 days. Then December has 31 days, and January 1 to 8 is 8 days. So total days: 15 + 31 + 8 = 54 days. Or wait, from November 15 to January 8: November (15 days left in Nov? Wait, no. From Nov 15 to Nov 30 is 15 days (since 30-15=15). Then December is 31 days, then January 1-8 is 8 days. So total is 15 +31 +8=54 days.

Alternatively, using the 360-day method, perhaps it's better to compute the exact days. Let me confirm: from November 15 to January 8.

Wait, November 15 to November 30 is 15 days (including the 15th? Or not? Wait, when calculating time between two dates, typically, the date of discounting is not included. So if the note is discounted on November 15, the time period starts from the next day, November 16. But sometimes, depending on the method, it might include the discount date. Hmm, this could get tricky.

But perhaps in this context, the problem expects using the days remaining from Nov 15 to the maturity. Let me think about the formula again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Time = (Date of Maturity - Date of Discounting) in days.

But the exact calculation can vary. So let's calculate the days from November 15 to January 8.

November: 30 days. So from Nov 15 to Nov 30 is 15 days (including the 15th? Or 16 days if counting the 15th as day 0). Wait, no, if today is the 15th, then from the 15th to the 30th is 15 days (since 30-15=15). So 15 days in November.

Then December has 31 days.

Then January 1 to 8 is 8 days.

So total days: 15 +31 +8 =54 days.

So time is 54 days.

Now, the discount is calculated as:

Discount = (Face Value × Rate × Time) / 360

Face Value is $1,250.

Rate is 6.5%, which is 0.065.

Time is 54 days.

So discount = (1250 * 0.065 *54)/360.

Let me compute that.

First, 0.065 *54 = 3.51.

Then 1250 *3.51 = 1250 * 3.51.

Let me compute 1250 *3.5 and 1250 *0.01.

3.5 *1250 = 4375.

0.01 *1250 =12.5.

So 4375 +12.5 =4387.5.

Now, divide by 360: 4387.5 /360.

Let me compute that.

4387.5 ÷ 360.

Well, 360 ×12=4320. So 4387.5-4320=67.5.

67.5/360=0.1875.

So 12.1875.

So discount is $12.1875.

Wait, but wait, let me recalculate that.

Wait, 54 days.

1250 *0.065 =81.25.

81.25 *54=?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it that way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alternative approach:

Discount = (P * R * T)/360

P=1250, R=6.5%=0.065, T=54.

So 1250 *0.065 =81.25.

81.25 *54 = ?

Let me compute 80*54=4320, 1.25*54=67.5. So 4320+67.5=4387.5.

Then 4387.5 /360 = ?

Yes, same as before, which is 12.1875.

So discount is $12.1875.

Wait, but 4387.5 divided by 360: 4387.5 ÷ 360.

Let me compute 360 ×12 =4320.

4387.5-4320=67.5.

67.5 ÷360 = 0.1875.

So total is 12.1875.

So discount is $12.1875.

So the proceeds would be face value minus discount: 1250 -12.1875 = 1237.8125.

Looking at the options, option J is $1,237.81, which is very close. So probably that's the correct answer.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the days calculation. Let me double-check the days between November 15 and January 8.

November 15 to November 30: 15 days.

December: 31 days.

January 1-8: 8 days.

Total: 15+31+8=54 days. That seems right.

Another way to check: from November 15 to January 8.

November: 30 days. So from Nov 15, you have 15 days left in November (including the 15th?), wait no, the 15th is the starting point, so from the 15th to the 30th is 16 days (including both the 15th and 30th). Wait, no, if you have a date on the 15th, the days remaining are from the 16th to the 30th, which is 15 days. Because the 15th is the day of discounting, so the time starts from the next day. So perhaps it's 15 days in November, then 31 in December, and 8 in January. So 15+31+8=54 days. So correct.

Wait, but some methods count the days as 365 and apply different calculations, but in this case, the question specifies 6.5% discounting, implying a 360-day year, so the method applies.

So discount is $12.1875, so proceeds are 1250 -12.1875 =1237.8125, which is approximately $1,237.81.

Looking back at the options, option J is $1,237.81.

So the answer should be J.

To determine the proceeds from discounting the note, we calculate the discount using the formula:

\[
\text{Discount} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{360}
\]

### Given:
- **Principal (P):** $1,250  
- **Rate (R):** 6.5% = 0.065  
- **Time (T):** The number of days from November 15, 1976, to the maturity date of January 8, 1977.  
  - November 15 to November 30: 15 days  
  - December: 31 days  
  - January 1 to January 8: 8 days  
  - Total = 15 + 31 + 8 = **54 days**

### Calculation:
1. Compute the discount:  
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \frac{1250 \times 0.065 \times 54}{360}
   \]  
   - \( 1250 \times 0.065 = 81.25 \)  
   - \( 81.25 \times 54 = 4387.5 \)  
   - \( \frac{4387.5}{360} = 12.1875 \)  

   So, the discount is **$12.1875**.

2. Calculate the proceeds:  
   \[
   \text{Proceeds} = \text{Principal} - \text{Discount} = 1250 - 12.1875 = 1237.8125
   \]

### Final Answer:
The proceeds are approximately **$1,237.81**, which corresponds to option **J**.
