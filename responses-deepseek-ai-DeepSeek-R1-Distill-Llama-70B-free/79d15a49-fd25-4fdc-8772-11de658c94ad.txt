Question:

Assuming we are underground, and the only thing we can observe is whether a person brings an umbrella or not. The weather could be either rain or sunny. Assuming the P(rain)=0.6 and P(sunny)=0.4. Assuming the weather on day $k$ is dependent on the weather on day $k-1$. We can write the transition probability as P(sunny $\mid$ sunny) = P(rain $\mid$ rain) = 0.7. The person has 60% chance to bring an umbrella when the weather is rain, and 40% chance to bring an umbrella when the weather is sunny, i.e. P(umbrella $\mid$ rain) = 0.6 and P(umbrella $\mid$ sunny) = 0.4. If we observe that the person (1) brought an umbrella on day 1, (2) did not bring an umbrella on day 2, (3) brought an umbrella on day 3.  What is the probability that day 2 is raining?

Okay, so I have this probability question to solve. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand everything.

We're underground and can only observe whether a person brings an umbrella each day. The weather can be either rain or sunny. The probabilities are given:

- P(rain) = 0.6
- P(sunny) = 0.4

The weather on day k depends on day k-1. The transition probabilities are:
- P(sunny | sunny) = 0.7
- P(rain | rain) = 0.7

So if it's sunny today, there's a 70% chance it stays sunny tomorrow. If it's raining today, 70% chance it continues raining tomorrow. That means the transition probabilities for switching are 0.3 each. So P(rain | sunny) = 0.3 and P(sunny | rain) = 0.3.

Then there's the person's umbrella usage:
- P(umbrella | rain) = 0.6
- P(umbrella | sunny) = 0.4

We observe three days:
1. Day 1: umbrella brought.
2. Day 2: no umbrella.
3. Day 3: umbrella brought.

We need to find the probability that day 2 was raining.

Hmm, okay. So this looks like a problem involving Markov chains and possibly the use of Bayes' theorem or maybe the Viterbi algorithm since we're dealing with a sequence of observations and hidden states (the weather each day).

Let me structure this. The weather is a hidden Markov model where each day's weather depends on the previous day, and the observations are the umbrella usage.

Our observations are:
U1 = 1 (umbrella on day 1)
U2 = 0 (no umbrella on day 2)
U3 = 1 (umbrella on day 3)

We need to find P(Rain on day 2 | U1=1, U2=0, U3=1).

This seems like we need to compute the posterior probability of the weather on day 2 given the observations.

To approach this, I think I'll model the possible weather sequences and calculate their probabilities, then use Bayes' theorem to find the conditional probability.

Let me consider all possible weather sequences for the three days that could explain the observations.

Wait, but the first day's weather is also unknown. We don't have any prior information about day 0, so I guess we'll start with the initial state probabilities.

The initial state (day 1) has P(Rain) = 0.6 and P(Sunny) = 0.4.

I think the approach is to compute the probability of each possible weather sequence (all possible combinations of Rain and Sunny for days 1, 2, 3) that leads to the observations, and then sum the probabilities where day 2 is Rain, divided by the total probability of all sequences that fit the observations.

So, the steps would be:

1. Enumerate all possible weather sequences for days 1,2,3.
2. For each sequence, compute the probability of the weather sequence given the transition model.
3. Compute the probability of the umbrella observations given the weather sequence.
4. Multiply these two probabilities for each sequence to get the joint probability.
5. Sum the joint probabilities for all sequences where day 2 is Rain to get the numerator.
6. Sum the joint probabilities for all possible sequences to get the denominator.
7. Divide numerator by denominator to get P(Rain on day 2 | observations).

But since the number of days is small (3), we can enumerate all possible weather sequences.

Each day can be Rain (R) or Sunny (S). So for three days, there are 2^3 = 8 possible sequences.

Let me list them:

1. R R R
2. R R S
3. R S R
4. R S S
5. S R R
6. S R S
7. S S R
8. S S S

Wait, but wait. The initial state is day 1. So for each sequence, day 1 can be R or S, and then each subsequent day depends on the transition probabilities.

Now, for each of these 8 sequences, I need to compute:

a) The prior probability of the weather sequence.

b) The likelihood of the observations given the weather.

Then multiply a and b to get the joint probability for that sequence.

Only sequences where the umbrella observations match U1=1, U2=0, U3=1 are relevant. So I can compute the likelihood for each and see which sequences are possible.

Wait, no. All sequences are possible, but their likelihood varies based on the umbrella observations. So each sequence will have a joint probability, and I need to consider all of them, then normalize.

So let's proceed.

First, for each sequence, compute the prior (weather sequence probability) and the likelihood (umbrella observations).

Let me start by calculating each sequence's prior.

The prior is P(weather sequence) = P(day1) * P(day2 | day1) * P(day3 | day2).

The transition probabilities are 0.7 for same as previous, 0.3 for switching.

So for each sequence:

1. R R R:
P = 0.6 * 0.7 (R→R) * 0.7 (R→R) = 0.6 * 0.7^2 = 0.6 * 0.49 = 0.294

2. R R S:
P = 0.6 * 0.7 (R→R) * 0.3 (R→S) = 0.6 * 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.6 * 0.21 = 0.126

3. R S R:
P = 0.6 * 0.3 (R→S) * 0.3 (S→R) = 0.6 * 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.6 * 0.09 = 0.054

4. R S S:
P = 0.6 * 0.3 (R→S) * 0.7 (S→S) = 0.6 * 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.6 * 0.21 = 0.126

5. S R R:
P = 0.4 * 0.3 (S→R) * 0.7 (R→R) = 0.4 * 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.4 * 0.21 = 0.084

6. S R S:
P = 0.4 * 0.3 (S→R) * 0.3 (R→S) = 0.4 * 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.4 * 0.09 = 0.036

7. S S R:
P = 0.4 * 0.7 (S→S) * 0.3 (S→R) = 0.4 * 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.4 * 0.21 = 0.084

8. S S S:
P = 0.4 * 0.7 (S→S) * 0.7 (S→S) = 0.4 * 0.49 = 0.196

Now, the likelihood for each sequence is P(U1=1, U2=0, U3=1 | weather sequence).

The umbrella on each day depends only on that day's weather.

So for each day in the sequence, we look up P(umbrella | weather).

Let me compute this for each sequence.

Umbrella probabilities:

If weather is R:
Umbrella: 0.6
No umbrella: 0.4

If weather is S:
Umbrella: 0.4
No umbrella: 0.6

So for each sequence, the likelihood is the product of the umbrella probabilities for each day.

Let's compute the likelihood for each sequence:

1. R R R:
U1=1: 0.6
U2=0: 0.4
U3=1: 0.6
Likelihood = 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.144

2. R R S:
U1=1:0.6
U2=0:0.4
U3=1:0.4 (because S)
Likelihood: 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.096

3. R S R:
U1=1:0.6
U2=0:0.6 (since S, no umbrella is 0.6)
U3=1:0.6
Likelihood: 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.216

4. R S S:
U1=1:0.6
U2=0:0.6
U3=1:0.4
Likelihood: 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.144

5. S R R:
U1=1:0.4 (S)
U2=0:0.4 (R)
U3=1:0.6
Likelihood: 0.4 * 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.096

6. S R S:
U1=1:0.4
U2=0:0.4
U3=1:0.4
Likelihood: 0.4 * 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.064

7. S S R:
U1=1:0.4
U2=0:0.6 (S)
U3=1:0.6
Likelihood: 0.4 * 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.144

8. S S S:
U1=1:0.4
U2=0:0.6
U3=1:0.4
Likelihood: 0.4 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.096

Now, the joint probability for each sequence is prior * likelihood.

Let me compute that for each:

1. R R R: 0.294 * 0.144 = let's calculate, 0.294 * 0.144. Let's compute 0.3 * 0.144 = 0.0432, subtracting 0.006 * 0.144=0.000864. So approximately 0.042336.

Wait, better to compute exact:

0.294 * 0.144:

0.2 * 0.144 = 0.0288
0.09 * 0.144=0.01296
0.004 * 0.144=0.000576
Sum: 0.0288 + 0.01296 = 0.04176 + 0.000576 = 0.042336.

2. R R S: 0.126 * 0.096 = let's compute 0.126 * 0.096.

0.1 * 0.096 = 0.0096
0.02 * 0.096 = 0.00192
0.006 * 0.096 = 0.000576
Sum: 0.0096 + 0.00192 = 0.01152 + 0.000576 = 0.012096.

3. R S R: 0.054 * 0.216.

0.05 * 0.216 = 0.0108
0.004 * 0.216 = 0.000864
Sum: 0.0108 + 0.000864 = 0.011664.

4. R S S: 0.126 * 0.144.

0.1 * 0.144 = 0.0144
0.02 * 0.144 = 0.00288
0.006 * 0.144 = 0.000864
Sum: 0.0144 + 0.00288 = 0.01728 + 0.000864 = 0.018144.

5. S R R: 0.084 * 0.096 = ?

0.08 * 0.096 = 0.00768
0.004 * 0.096 = 0.000384
Sum: 0.00768 + 0.000384 = 0.008064.

6. S R S: 0.036 * 0.064.

0.03 * 0.064 = 0.00192
0.006 * 0.064 = 0.000384
Sum: 0.00192 + 0.000384 = 0.002304.

7. S S R: 0.084 * 0.144.

Same as R S S: 0.018144 (since 0.084 *0.144 is same as 0.126 * 0.144? Wait no, 0.084 * 0.144.

0.08 * 0.144=0.01152
0.004 *0.144=0.000576
Sum: 0.01152 + 0.000576 = 0.012096.

8. S S S: 0.196 * 0.096.

0.1 * 0.096 = 0.0096
0.09 * 0.096 = 0.00864
0.006 * 0.096=0.000576
Sum: 0.0096 + 0.00864 = 0.01824 + 0.000576 = 0.018816.

Now, let me list all the joint probabilities:

1. R R R: 0.042336
2. R R S: 0.012096
3. R S R: 0.011664
4. R S S: 0.018144
5. S R R: 0.008064
6. S R S: 0.002304
7. S S R: 0.012096
8. S S S: 0.018816

Now, I need to find the total probability of all sequences, which is the sum of all these joint probabilities.

Let me compute that:

Adding all of them:

0.042336 +

0.012096 = 0.054432

+0.011664 = 0.066096

+0.018144 = 0.08424

+0.008064 = 0.092304

+0.002304 = 0.094608

+0.012096 = 0.106704

+0.018816 = 0.12552.

Wait, let me check the addition step by step.

Compute the sum:

0.042336 (R R R)
+ 0.012096 (R R S) → 0.054432
+ 0.011664 (R S R) → 0.066096
+0.018144 (R S S) → 0.08424
+0.008064 (S R R) → 0.092304
+0.002304 (S R S) → 0.094608
+0.012096 (S S R) → 0.106704
+0.018816 (S S S) → 0.12552.

So the total probability of all possible sequences given the observations is 0.12552.

Now, the question is to find the probability that day 2 is Rain, given the observations.

So we need to sum the joint probabilities of all sequences where day 2 is Rain.

Looking at each sequence:

1. R R R → day2 R → include.
2. R R S → day2 R → include.
3. R S R → day2 S → exclude.
4. R S S → day2 S → exclude.
5. S R R → day2 R → include.
6. S R S → day2 R → include.
7. S S R → day2 S → exclude.
8. S S S → day2 S → exclude.

So the sequences that have Rain on day2 are:

1. R R R → 0.042336
2. R R S → 0.012096
5. S R R → 0.008064
6. S R S → 0.002304

Wait, no. Let's double-check each:

Sequence 1: R R R → day2 R → include.

Sequence 2: R R S → day2 R → include.

Sequence 3: R S R → day2 S → no.

Sequence 4: R S S → day2 S → no.

Sequence 5: S R R → day2 R → include.

Sequence 6: S R S → day2 R → include.

Sequence 7: S S R → day2 S → no.

Sequence 8: S S S → day2 S → no.

So the sequences to include are 1,2,5,6.

Sum their joint probabilities:

0.042336 (1) + 0.012096 (2) + 0.008064 (5) + 0.002304 (6)

Calculating:

0.042336 + 0.012096 = 0.054432

+ 0.008064 → 0.062496

+ 0.002304 → 0.0648.

So the numerator is 0.0648, and the denominator is 0.12552.

So P(Rain day2 | observations) = 0.0648 / 0.12552.

Let me compute that division.

0.0648 / 0.12552 ≈ ?

Let me compute this.

0.0648 ÷ 0.12552.

I can write both in terms multiplied by 10000 to make it easier:

648 / 1255.2 ≈

Wait, maybe approximate it.

0.12552 × 0.516 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.0648 / 0.12552.

First, note that 0.12552 × 0.516 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 648 / 1255.2.

648 ÷ 1255.2 = ?

Let me compute 648 ÷ 1255.2.

Approximate:

1255.2 × 0.5 = 627.6 → which is just below 648.

627.6 + 125.52*0.05 = 627.6 +6.276=633.876 → still less than 648.

633.876 + 125.52 * 0.01 = 633.876 +1.255
