Okay, so I've got this question here about individual freedom to schedule work being an example of something. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I should probably understand what each term means. The question is asking about individual freedom in scheduling work. That makes me think of flexibility in how someone plans their work or tasks. So, which of these terms relates to that?

Looking at the options:

A: Job design. I remember that job design involves structuring the tasks, responsibilities, and processes of a job. It's about how the work is organized. If a job is designed to allow more flexibility, that could relate to scheduling freedom.

B: Job planning. This sounds like the process of planning tasks and setting goals. Maybe it's about organizing what needs to be done, but I'm not sure if it directly relates to individual scheduling freedom.

C: Job specification. That's more about the requirements for a job, like skills and qualifications needed. Doesn't seem related to scheduling.

D: Job satisfaction. This is about how happy or content an employee is with their job. While flexibility might contribute to satisfaction, it's not an example of it.

E: Job rate. I think this refers to pay rates or how much someone is paid per hour or job. Not related to scheduling.

F: Job security. This is about the stability of the job, whether the person is likely to keep it. Not about scheduling.

G: Job enrichment. I recall that job enrichment involves adding more challenging tasks or responsibilities to a job to make it more fulfilling. It's about the content, not the schedule.

H: Job analysis. This is the process of examining and documenting the tasks, duties, and responsibilities of a job. Again, not about scheduling.

I: Job evaluation. This is assessing the value or worth of a job to determine pay or grading. Not related.

J: Job rotation. This is where employees move between different jobs or roles within an organization. It's about varied experiences, not scheduling.

Wait, so I'm left with A and B. Job design (A) is about structuring the job, which could include how much flexibility an employee has in their schedule. Job planning (B) is more about setting up the tasks and goals. 

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Individual freedom to schedule work implies that the worker can decide when and how to do their tasks. That sounds like a part of the job design. For example, flexible hours or telecommuting options are part of how a job is designed.

Alternatively, job planning might involve the individual planning their own schedule, but I think job design is more about the structure that allows that freedom.

So the answer should be A: Job design.

The individual freedom to schedule work is best associated with how a job is structured to allow flexibility. Among the options, job design (A) refers to organizing tasks and responsibilities, which can include flexible scheduling. Other options like job planning (B) focus more on task organization rather than structural flexibility. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A
