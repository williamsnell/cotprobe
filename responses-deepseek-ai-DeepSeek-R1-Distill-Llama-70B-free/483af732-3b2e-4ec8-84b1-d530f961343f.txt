Okay, so I have this question about electricity, specifically circuits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is: As more lamps are connected in a series circuit, the current in the power source... and then there are several options.

Alright, I remember that in a series circuit, all the components are connected one after another. So the current flows through each component in sequence. Oh right, and in a series circuit, the current is the same throughout the circuit. So if you have multiple lamps in series, the current through each lamp is the same as the others.

Wait, but the question is about how adding more lamps affects the current from the power source. So what determines the current in the first place? Oh yeah, Ohm's Law. V = I * R. Where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of all the individual resistances. So if I add more lamps, each lamp has its own resistance. Let's say each lamp has a resistance r. If I have n lamps in series, the total resistance R_total is n * r.

So as more lamps are added, R_total increases. Now, the power source has a fixed voltage, right? Like a battery or something. So if the voltage is fixed and the resistance increases, according to Ohm's Law, the current I would be V divided by R_total. So if R_total increases, I decreases.

So the current in the power source should decrease as more lamps are added in series. Looking at the options, option E says 'decreases', which matches what I just thought.

Wait, but what about the power source's capacity? If the source can't supply enough voltage or has internal resistance, does that change things? Well, the question doesn't specify, so I think we can assume it's an ideal source with fixed voltage and negligible internal resistance.

So yeah, adding lamps in series increases the total resistance, which causes the current to decrease. So the answer should be E.

As more lamps are connected in a series circuit, the total resistance increases because resistances add up in series. According to Ohm's Law (V = I * R), if the voltage from the power source is fixed and the total resistance increases, the current (I) decreases. Therefore, the current in the power source decreases as more lamps are added.

The correct answer is **E**.

Answer: E
