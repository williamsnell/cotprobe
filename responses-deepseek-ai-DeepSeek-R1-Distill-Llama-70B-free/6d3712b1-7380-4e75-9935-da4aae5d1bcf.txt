Question:

In the Harlow study of emotional attachment, infant monkeys were placed in a cage and given both a "wire" mother and a "cloth" mother. Researchers then moved a bottle of milk from one mother to the other while introducing various stimuli to see if the monkeys would form an attachment to either of the "mothers." In this experiment, the independent variable is

Options:

A: the type of stimuli introduced to the monkeys
B: with which "mother" the bottle of milk is placed
C: the gender of the infant monkeys
D: the amount of milk in the bottle
E: the type of material used to create the "mothers"
F: the "wire" mother versus the "cloth" mother
G: the age of the infant monkeys
H: the time of day the milk bottle was moved
I: the preference of the infants for the source of milk
J: the preference of the infants for the "wire" mother

Okay, so I have this question about the Harlow study on emotional attachment. I've heard about this study before in my psychology class, but I need to make sure I remember the details correctly. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about identifying the independent variable in the experiment. Independent variables are the factors that the researchers manipulate to see how they affect the outcome. So in Harlow's study, what did they change on purpose?

From what I remember, Harlow used infant monkeys and provided them with two types of "mothers." One was made of wire and the other of cloth. Initially, the wire mother had a bottle of milk, so the monkeys would go to her for feeding. But later, they switched the milk to the cloth mother. The idea was to see whether the monkeys would form attachments based on the source of food or other factors like comfort, which the cloth mother provided.

Wait, so the key here is that the experiment tested whether the monkeys' attachment was based on the food source or other factors. So the researchers probably manipulated which "mother" had the milk. Because they wanted to observe where the monkeys would go and form attachment bonds.

Looking at the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Type of stimuli introduced. Hmm, I think the stimuli here might refer to the presence of the mothers. But the question is about moving the milk bottle. Maybe not the main variable.

Option B: With which mother the bottle is placed. Oh, this sounds right. Because the experiment involved moving the milk from wire to cloth mother to see if attachment changed.

Option C: Gender of the monkeys. I don't think the study focused on gender differences. They were probably all same, or it wasn't a factor here.

Option D: Amount of milk. The question doesn't mention varying the amount; it's more about which mother provided it.

Option E: Material of mothers. Wait, the mothers were made of wire and cloth, so the type of material is a factor. But in this question, is the material the independent variable? Or is it the placement of the milk?

Wait, in the initial setup, both mothers were present, and the milk was moved. So the material is a constant factor because the mothers are always there. The variable is which one holds the milk.

Option F: Wire vs cloth mother. That's more about the setup, not the variable they're changing. The independent variable is the factor they are manipulating, which is where the milk is.

Option G: Age of monkeys. I don't think age was varied here; they were all infants.

Option H: Time of day. The question doesn't mention varying the time, so not relevant.

Option I: Infants' preference for milk source. No, that's a dependent variable, the outcome measured.

Option J: Preference for wire mother. Again, that's an outcome, not the variable being manipulated.

So the independent variable is B: with which mother the bottle of milk is placed. Because the researchers moved the bottle between the mothers to see the effect on attachment.

The Harlow study investigated emotional attachment by placing infant monkeys with two "mothers": one made of wire and one of cloth. The researchers manipulated which mother held the milk bottle to observe the monkeys' attachment behavior. This manipulation—the placement of the milk bottle with either the wire or cloth mother—is the independent variable.

- **Option A**: The type of stimuli introduced is not the variable being manipulated.  
- **Option B**: This is correct, as moving the milk bottle between the mothers is the deliberate change made by researchers.  
- **Option C**: Gender is not a focus of this experiment.  
- **Option D**: The amount of milk is constant and not varied.  
- **Option E**: The material of the mothers is a constant factor, not the variable being manipulated.  
- **Option F**: The wire vs. cloth mother is part of the setup, not the independent variable.  
- **Option G**: Age is not varied in this study.  
- **Option H**: Time of day is irrelevant to the experiment.  
- **Option I**: Preference for the milk source is an outcome, not the variable.  
- **Option J**: Preference for the wire mother is also an outcome, not the independent variable.  

Thus, the independent variable is **B: with which "mother" the bottle of milk is placed**.  

Answer: B
