Question:

All of the following are true regarding the function of neurons EXCEPT:

Options:

A: The refractory period prevents the neuron from initiating a new action potential.
B: The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.
C: An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential.
D: The action potential travels along the axon away from the cell body.
E: Hyperpolarization occurs when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential.
F: The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential.
G: Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire.
H: The neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from the axon terminals.

Okay, so I've got this question about neurons and their functions. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let's try to think through this.

The question is asking which option is NOT true about how neurons function. The options are A through H. I'll need to go through each one and see which is the exception.

Starting with option A: The refractory period prevents the neuron from initiating a new action potential. I remember that after an action potential, there's a period where the neuron can't fire again right away. This is called the refractory period. So A sounds correct.

Option B: Transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters from its dendrites. Wait, no. I think neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals, not the dendrites. Dendrites receive signals, and the axon sends them. So B must be the wrong statement. But I should check the other options to be sure.

Option C: Action potential starts when the axon hillock reaches threshold. Yes, the axon hillock is the part where action potentials are typically initiated because it has a high concentration of voltage-gated sodium channels. So C is correct.

Option D: Action potential travels along axon away from cell body. That makes sense. The action potential propagates from the cell body down the axon to the terminals. So D is correct.

Option E: Hyperpolarization is when the membrane is more negative than resting. Right, hyperpolarization means the inside is even more negative than the resting potential, which is about -70mV. So E is correct.

Option F: Sodium flow causes depolarization in first phase. Yes, the depolarization (rising phase) of the action potential is due to Na+ rushing in. So F is correct.

Option G: Hyperpolarization helps limit action potential firing rate. Yes, because during hyperpolarization, it's harder for the neuron to reach threshold again, so it takes longer before the next action potential. So G is correct.

Option H: Neurotransmitters released from axon terminals. Yes, the axon terminals have vesicles that release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. So H is correct.

So looking back, option B said the neurotransmitters are secreted from the dendrites. That's incorrect because they're secreted from the axon terminals. So the question is about which statement is NOT true, which would be option B.

The question asks which statement about the function of neurons is NOT true. Let's analyze each option:

- **A**: The refractory period prevents the neuron from initiating a new action potential. This is true, as the refractory period ensures a neuron cannot fire again immediately after an action potential.
- **B**: The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites. This is false because neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals, not the dendrites.
- **C**: An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential. This is true, as the axon hillock is the site where action potentials are typically initiated.
- **D**: The action potential travels along the axon away from the cell body. This is true, as action potentials propagate from the cell body down the axon.
- **E**: Hyperpolarization occurs when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. This is true, as hyperpolarization refers to the membrane potential being more negative than the resting state.
- **F**: The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential. This is true, as sodium influx causes the depolarization phase.
- **G**: Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire. This is true, as hyperpolarization makes it harder for the neuron to reach threshold again.
- **H**: The neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from the axon terminals. This is true, as axon terminals are responsible for neurotransmitter release.

The false statement is **B**, as neurotransmitters are not secreted from dendrites but from axon terminals.

Answer: B
