Question:

A builder wanted to have security systems installed in a series of homes he was building. He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them. On September 11, the builder sent the following fax to the alarm company: "I hereby accept your offer to install the security systems for $100,000. "The alarm company had to pay another wholesaler $10,000 above the price quoted by the supplier for the burglar alarms. As a result, the alarm company advised the builder that the total price for the job would have to be increased to $10,000. The builder replied that he would hold the alarm company to the initially agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company installed the security systems, but the builder has not yet paid them anything. In an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover

Options:

A: The cost of the alarms from the second supplier, because they were an unforeseen expense.
B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated changeof circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.
C: only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.
D: only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.
E: $100,000, because that was the original agreed price, regardless of changes in circumstances.
F: $90,000, because the alarm company had to pay an additional cost.
G: $100,000, because that was the contract price.
H: Nothing, because the builder did not agree to the new price.
I: $100,000, plus damages for the builder's delay in payment.
J: $110,000, because the supplier's inability to supply burglar alarms was unforeseen.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again carefully.

So, there's a builder who wants security systems installed in homes. He contacts companies to submit bids. An alarm company decides to bid and, in turn, asks wholesalers for bids on the burglar alarms they plan to use. A supplier submits a bid that the alarm company uses in their bid to the builder.

On September 1, the alarm company sends a bid to the builder for $100k to install the systems. Then on September 9, the supplier tells the alarm company they can't supply the alarms. On September 11, the builder sends a fax accepting the offer. The alarm company then has to pay another wholesaler an extra $10k. So they tell the builder the price has to go up by $10k, but the builder says they have to stick to the original $100k. The alarm company does the work, but the builder hasn't paid anything. Now, the alarm company is suing the builder for the services. What can they recover?

Hmm. The key issues here seem to be about contract formation, offer and acceptance, and possibly frustration or impossibility.

First, when was the contract formed? The alarm company sent their bid on Sept 1. The builder accepted on Sept 11. So by the time the builder accepted, the original supplier couldn't fulfill their part. Wait, but the builder didn't know that, right? Because the supplier told the alarm company on Sept 9, but the builder accepted two days later on Sept 11.

So the question is, does the builder's acceptance bind them to the original price, even though the alarm company's cost went up because their supplier backed out? Or can the alarm company demand the higher price?

I remember that when a contract is formed, the parties are bound by the terms agreed upon. So if the alarm company offered to do the job for $100k, and the builder accepted that offer, then the contract is for $100k. But what happens if the alarm company's cost increases because of unforeseen circumstances?

Wait, this might relate to the doctrine of commercial impracticability or frustration of purpose. But I think those doctrines apply when the underlying purpose of the contract is frustrated, making performance impossible or significantly different. Like if a concert venue burns down, and the band can't perform.

In this case, the supplier couldn't provide the alarms, so the alarm company had to find another supplier at a higher cost. But does that make the contract impossible? Or is it just a matter of increased expense?

I think increased cost alone doesn't make a contract impossible. The alarm company could still perform, just at a higher cost. So they're not excused from their obligation to perform at the original price. That would mean the builder doesn't have to pay the extra $10k.

But wait, when did the supplier back out? Before the builder accepted the offer. So the alarm company's bid was based on the supplier's bid, but the supplier withdrew before the builder accepted. So when the builder accepted, the alarm company no longer had a supplier. Does that affect the contract?

Wait, in contract law, when an offer is made, the offeror is bound once the offeree accepts. But if the offeror's ability to perform is dependent on a third party, and that third party's offer is revoked before the offeree accepts, then the offeror might be excused because of impossibility.

Wait, no. The alarm company made an offer to the builder. The builder's acceptance was on Sept 11. But the supplier's refusal was on Sept 9, which is before the acceptance. So when the alarm company made the offer on Sept 1, the supplier's bid was still valid. But then the supplier withdrew before the builder accepted. So when the builder accepted, the alarm company's source was gone. Does that mean the alarm company's offer was based on a revocation of the supplier's bid, making their own offer impossible?

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the concept of offers and reliance. If the alarm company's offer was based on the supplier's bid, and the supplier revoked that bid before the builder accepted, then the basis of the alarm company's offer was gone. So when the builder accepted, the alarm company might not have a way to fulfill the contract except at a higher cost.

But generally, an offeror can revoke an offer any time before acceptance. But here, the problem is that the offeror (alarm company) relied on the supplier's bid, which was revoked. So when the builder accepted, the alarm company's position had changed.

But I think that unless the offer was conditional on the supplier's bid, the alarm company is still bound. Because when making the offer, the offeror takes the risk of their own costs. So if the supplier backs out, the alarm company has to find another supplier, even if it's more expensive.

So the builder's acceptance on Sept 11 created a binding contract for $100k. The alarm company then had to perform, even if it cost them more. So when the alarm company demanded an extra $10k, that might be a breach because they're trying to change the terms after the contract was formed.

Wait, but the alarm company did perform the work. They just want to get paid. The issue is whether they can recover the $100k or more.

In the scenario, the alarm company demanded $110k after the contract was made. The builder refused, but the alarm company went ahead and did the work. So the builder hasn't paid anything.

So the question is, can the alarm company recover $100k, or can they get more because of the extra cost?

I think that under the contract, the price is $100k. The alarm company is obligated to perform at that price, regardless of their own increased costs. So when they did the work, the builder is obligated to pay $100k. The fact that their cost went up doesn't entitle them to more, unless the contract allows for changes, which it doesn't here.

So looking at the options:

Option E says $100k because that's the original agreed price regardless of changes. Option G says the same, $100k as the contract price.

What's the difference between E and G? Let me read them again.

Option E: $100k, because that was the original agreed price, regardless of changes in circumstances.

Option G: $100k, because that was the contract price.

Hmm, both seem similar. But perhaps G is more about the contract price, while E mentions changes in circumstances.

But the correct reasoning is that the contract was formed at $100k, so the alarm company can recover that amount. The increased cost is their problem, not the builder's. So the answer would be either E or G.

Wait, but let's check other options.

Option A says cost of alarms from the second supplier because unforeseen expense. But I don't think that's correct because the builder isn't responsible for the alarm company's increased costs.

Option B: $110k because of change of circumstances. But unless the contract allows for that, the builder isn't obligated to pay more.

Option C: only quantum meruit because demanding $110k was repudiation. Quantum meruit is about recovery based on the value of services rendered, without a contract. But here, there was a contract, so quantum meruit isn't the right approach.

Option D: quantum meruit because of commercial frustration. Again, commercial frustration would relate to impossibility, which I don't think applies here.

Option F: $90k because of extra cost. That doesn't make sense; the contract is $100k.

Option H: nothing, because builder didn't agree to new price. But the contract was for $100k, so the builder should pay that.

Option I: $100k plus damages for delay. The question says the builder hasn't paid anything, so maybe they can recover the $100k plus interest or damages for late payment, but I don't think that's the main point here. The question is about the amount recoverable for the services.

Option J: $110k because supplier's issue was unforeseen. But the contract was for $100k, so unless the builder agreed, which they didn't, this isn't possible.

So between E and G. Both say $100k. But let me think again.

Option E says regardless of changes in circumstances. Option G says because it's the contract price.

I think the correct answer is E or G. Wait, but the contract was formed when the builder accepted the offer on Sept 11. At that point, the alarm company's supplier had already backed out on Sept 9. Does that affect the contract?

Wait, the alarm company's offer was made on Sept 1, based on the supplier's bid. The supplier revoked their bid on Sept 9. Then the builder accepted on Sept 11. So when the builder accepted, the alarm company's offer was still open, but the supplier's bid was no longer available. So the question is, was the alarm company's offer still valid? Or was the offer revoked when the supplier's offer was revoked?

In contract law, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance, but the revocation must be communicated. If the supplier's offer to the alarm company was revoked, but the alarm company didn't revoke their offer to the builder, then the builder's acceptance on Sept 11 would still form a contract. However, if the alarm company's offer was based on the supplier's offer, and the supplier's offer was revoked before the builder accepted, then perhaps the alarm company's offer was revoked by the change in circumstances.

Wait, that's a bit more complex. Let me think. If an offer is made in reliance on another offer, and that other offer is revoked before the offeree accepts, does that mean the offeror's offer is revoked?

I think that under the concept of "offer and acceptance," the offer stands unless revoked. So if the alarm company made an offer to the builder on Sept 1, and didn't revoke it, then the builder's acceptance on Sept 11 would create a contract. The fact that the supplier's offer was revoked doesn't automatically revoke the alarm company's offer to the builder.

So the alarm company would still be bound to perform at $100k, even though their cost increased. Therefore, when the alarm company sues, they can recover $100k.

So looking back, the correct answer should be E or G. Both seem correct, but the options might have nuances.

Wait, option E says "regardless of changes in circumstances." That touches on the idea that even if the alarm company's situation changed, the contract stands. So that seems correct.

Option G says because it's the contract price, which is also correct.

Looking at the options, both E and G are about $100k. But perhaps the more precise reasoning is that the contract was formed, so the alarm company can recover the contract price.

But let me think about the case where the offeror's ability to perform is destroyed before acceptance. In such a case, the offer is revoked. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, in the case where an offer is made with the expectation of obtaining materials from a third party, and that third party's offer is revoked, if the offeror (alarm company) has not revoked their offer, then the offeree (builder) can still accept and form a contract. But then the offeror would be in breach if they can't perform. But in this case, the alarm company did perform, just at a higher cost. So the builder is still obligated to pay the contract price.

Therefore, the alarm company can recover $100k, which is the contract price. So the answer is E or G.

Wait, looking again, option E says "regardless of changes in circumstances," which is a bit broad. Option G is more straightforward, stating it's the contract price.

I think the correct answer is E, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the contract was impossible because the supplier couldn't deliver, but the alarm company found another supplier, so they could perform, just at a higher cost. So impossibility doesn't apply because they performed.

So, the builder must pay $100k. So the answer is either E or G.

Wait, the options are:

E: $100,000, because that was the original agreed price, regardless of changes in circumstances.

G: $100,000, because that was the contract price.

I think both are correct, but perhaps G is more precise because it's about the contract price. However, in the scenario, the alarm company is suing for services rendered, so they should get the contract price, which is $100k. So the answer is G.

But wait, another angle: when the builder accepted on Sept 11, the alarm company's offer was still open, but the supplier had already backed out. So perhaps the contract was based on an impossibility, making it unenforceable. But since the alarm company found another supplier, they performed, so there's no impossibility. Therefore, the contract holds.

So the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around contract law principles, specifically focusing on offer and acceptance, contract formation, and the enforceability of the agreed terms. Here's the analysis:

1. **Contract Formation**:  
   - The alarm company submitted a bid to the builder on September 1 for $100,000.  
   - The builder accepted this offer on September 11, which constitutes a binding contract for $100,000.  
   - The supplier's inability to provide the alarms (notified on September 9) occurred before the builder's acceptance. However, the alarm company did not revoke their offer to the builder, so the offer remained open and binding when the builder accepted it.

2. **Obligation to Perform**:  
   - Once the contract was formed, the alarm company was obligated to perform at the agreed price of $100,000. The increased cost due to the supplier's withdrawal does not affect the builder's obligation to pay the contract price.  
   - The alarm company successfully installed the security systems, fulfilling their contractual obligation.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The builder is not responsible for the alarm company's unforeseen expenses.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. There is no provision in the contract for price adjustments due to changed circumstances.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Quantum meruit is not applicable because a valid contract exists.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. Commercial frustration does not apply here, as the alarm company performed the work.  
   - **Option E**: Correct. The builder must pay the original agreed price of $100,000, regardless of the alarm company's increased costs.  
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The contract price is $100,000, not $90,000.  
   - **Option G**: Correct. The builder must pay the contract price of $100,000.  
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The builder is obligated to pay the contract price of $100,000.  
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The question focuses on the price for services rendered, not damages for delay.  
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The contract price remains $100,000, regardless of unforeseen circumstances.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Both options E and G correctly conclude that the builder must pay $100,000. However, option G is more precise as it directly references the contract price, which is the cornerstone of the analysis.
