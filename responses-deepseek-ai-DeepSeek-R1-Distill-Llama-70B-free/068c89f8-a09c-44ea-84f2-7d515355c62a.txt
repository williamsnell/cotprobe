Okay, so I've got this astrophysics question here about black holes. Hmm, I remember that black holes form when a massive star collapses. The question says that a burned-out star with at least three solar masses will collapse into a black hole. I'm supposed to find the radius of its event horizon, given as X times 10^3 meters.

Wait, the event horizon... Oh right, the event horizon is the point of no return around a black hole. The radius of the event horizon is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula, I think. Let me recall. The formula is R = (2 * G * M) / c². Yeah, that sounds right. G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, and c is the speed of light.

But wait, the problem mentions that the mass is at least three solar masses. So in this case, the mass M is three times the mass of the Sun. I should probably use the Sun's mass as a known value. Let me jot down the numbers I know.

The mass of the Sun is about 1.9885 × 10^30 kilograms. So three solar masses would be 3 * 1.9885e30 kg. Let me calculate that: 3 * 1.9885 is approximately 5.9655, so 5.9655e30 kg.

G, the gravitational constant, is 6.6743 × 10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2. And the speed of light c is 3.0 × 10^8 m/s. Okay, plugging these into the formula.

So R = (2 * G * M) / c². Let me compute each part step by step. First, calculate 2G: 2 * 6.6743e-11 = 1.33486e-10 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

Then multiply that by M, which is 5.9655e30 kg. So 1.33486e-10 * 5.9655e30 = let's see. Multiplying the coefficients: 1.33486 * 5.9655 ≈ let me calculate that. 1.3 * 6 is 7.8, but more accurately, 1.33486 * 5.9655 is approximately 7.96e0 (since 1.33486 *5 is about 6.674, and 0.9655*1.33486 is around 1.29, so total around 7.96). Then the exponents: 1e-10 *1e30 = 1e20. So this gives approximately 7.96e20.

Wait, no, I think I messed up a step. Let me recalculate. Oh wait, 2G is 1.33486e-10, multiplied by M=5.9655e30. So 1.33486e-10 *5.9655e30 = (1.33486 *5.9655) * 1e( -10 +30 ) = (approx 7.96) * 1e20 = 7.96e20.

Then we have to divide by c squared. c is 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s². So now, R = 7.96e20 / 9e16.

Calculating that: 7.96e20 /9e16 = (7.96 /9 ) * 1e4. 7.96 divided by 9 is approximately 0.884, right? Because 9 *0.88 is 7.92, which is close to 7.96. So 0.884 * 1e4 = 8.84e3 meters.

Wait, the question says the radius is X *10^3 meters. So X would be around 8.84. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option D is 8.9, which is close to 8.84. So maybe I made a small error in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers. Let's go through each step again.

M = 3 * M_sun. M_sun is approximately 1.9885e30 kg. So 3 *1.9885e30 = 5.9655e30 kg.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So R = (2 * G * M) / c².

Compute numerator first: 2 * G * M = 2 *6.6743e-11 *5.9655e30.

Let me compute 2 *6.6743e-11 first: 1.33486e-10.

Now multiply by 5.9655e30:

1.33486e-10 *5.9655e30 = (1.33486 *5.9655) * 1e20.

Calculate 1.33486 *5.9655:

Hmm, 1.33486 *5 = 6.6743, and 1.33486 *0.9655 is about 1.290. So total is 6.6743 +1.290 ≈ 7.9643.

So 7.9643e20.

Now denominator is c² = (3e8)^2 =9e16.

So R =7.9643e20 /9e16 = (7.9643 /9 )e4.

7.9643 /9 is approximately 0.885, since 9*0.885=7.965. So 0.885e4 is 8.85e3 meters, which is 8.85 *10^3 m.

Looking at the options, option D is 8.9, which is very close. So probably, considering rounding during calculations, the answer is D:8.9.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me think again. When I calculated 1.33486e-10 *5.9655e30, the exponents are 1e-10 *1e30=1e20, correct. The coefficient was 1.33486 *5.9655 = approx 7.9643 as before.

Divide by 9e16: so (7.9643e20)/(9e16)= (7.9643/9)*1e4.

7.9643 /9: 9*0.88 is 7.92, which leaves 0.0443. So 0.88 + (0.0443/9) = 0.88 + 0.0049≈0.8849. So 0.8849e4 = 8849 meters, which is 8.849e3 m. So X is approximately 8.85, which rounds to 8.9 when rounded to one decimal place.

So the correct answer should be D:8.9.

To determine the radius of the event horizon for a black hole formed from a star with a mass of three solar masses, we use the Schwarzschild radius formula:

\[
R = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\]

### Step 1: Known values
- Mass of the Sun: \( M_{\odot} = 1.9885 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)
- Gravitational constant: \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \)
- Speed of light: \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Mass of the star: \( M = 3M_{\odot} = 3 \times 1.9885 \times 10^{30} = 5.9655 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the numerator
\[
2GM = 2 \times 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.9655 \times 10^{30}
\]
\[
2G = 1.33486 \times 10^{-10}, \quad 1.33486 \times 10^{-10} \times 5.9655 \times 10^{30} = 7.9643 \times 10^{20}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the denominator
\[
c^2 = (3.0 \times 10^8)^2 = 9.0 \times 10^{16}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( R \)
\[
R = \frac{7.9643 \times 10^{20}}{9.0 \times 10^{16}} = \frac{7.9643}{9.0} \times 10^4
\]
\[
\frac{7.9643}{9.0} \approx 0.8849, \quad R \approx 0.8849 \times 10^4 = 8.849 \times 10^3 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The radius of the event horizon is approximately \( 8.849 \times 10^3 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to \( X = 8.9 \). The closest option is **D: 8.9**.
