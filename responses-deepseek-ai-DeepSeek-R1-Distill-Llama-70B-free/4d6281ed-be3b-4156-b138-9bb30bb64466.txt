Okay, so I have this question about the real interest rate, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that interest rates can be a bit tricky because they come in two forms: nominal and real. The nominal interest rate is the rate you see advertised, like the rate your bank offers on a savings account. But that's not the whole story because inflation can erode the purchasing power of your money. So the real interest rate adjusts for inflation to show the actual return on your investment.

Wait, how does the real interest rate work again? I think it's the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. Oh right, the formula is something like Real Rate = Nominal Rate - Inflation Rate. But wait, in the context of this question, it's about anticipated inflation. Right, because sometimes the inflation rate isn't known yet; it's what people expect to happen.

So the real interest rate is calculated using the nominal interest rate and subtracting the expected or anticipated inflation rate. That makes sense because if you expect inflation to be high, the real return on your investment would be lower.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. 

Option A says it's the anticipated inflation plus the nominal rate. That doesn't sound right because adding them would make the real rate higher than nominal, which doesn't account for inflation's negative effect.

Option B is nominal multiplied by inflation. That would give a different value, but I don't think that's how real rates are calculated. 

Option C is what you see in bank literature. Banks usually show nominal rates, not real. So C is probably not correct.

Option D is anticipated inflation minus nominal. Wait, that would make the real rate negative if inflation is higher than the nominal rate. That's the opposite of the formula I remember, so D is incorrect.

Option E is nominal minus anticipated inflation. That matches what I was thinking earlier. So E looks like a strong candidate.

Option F is nominal divided by inflation. That doesn't seem right because division isn't part of the real interest rate formula.

Option G is similar, dividing nominal by anticipated inflation. No, that's not how it's done.

Option H subtracts current inflation from nominal. But the question is about anticipated inflation, not current, so H is probably wrong.

Option I adds inflation and nominal rates. Again, adding doesn't adjust for inflation's impact correctly.

Option J adds nominal and anticipated inflation. That's not right either because you should subtract inflation to get the real rate.

So putting it all together, the correct formula is nominal interest rate minus the anticipated inflation rate. That's option E.

The real interest rate is calculated by subtracting the anticipated inflation rate from the nominal interest rate. This adjustment accounts for the expected erosion of purchasing power due to inflation, providing the actual return on an investment. Among the given options, only Option E correctly represents this relationship.

Answer: E
