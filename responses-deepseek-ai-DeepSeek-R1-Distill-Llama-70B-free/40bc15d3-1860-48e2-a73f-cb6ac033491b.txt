Question:

Congress has recently enacted a statute requiring all males between the ages of 18 and 30 to take a physical examination each year. The results of the exam are sent to a government data information center for the purpose of keeping information about men who may be drafted into the military. A 25-year-old law school graduate has herpes. He has recently sent resumes to many governmental agencies. Fearful that the information about his herpes condition will become available, he seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid the government from requiring him to take a physical examination. Which of the following is the best constitutional basis in support of the federal law?

Options:

A: The full faith and credit clause.
B: The dormant commerce clause.
C: The necessary and proper clause.
D: The equal protection clause.
E: The commerce clause.
F: The supremacy clause.
G: To raise and support an army and navy.
H: The privileges and immunities clause.
I: To provide for the general welfare.
J: The due process clause.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about a federal statute that requires all males aged 18 to 30 to take a physical exam each year. The results are sent to a government data center, supposedly for information on men who might be drafted. A 25-year-old law grad with herpes is worried his condition will be disclosed and is seeking a declaratory judgment to stop the government from making him take the exam. The question is asking for the best constitutional basis supporting this federal law.

The options are A through J, each referencing a different constitutional clause or concept. I'll need to match the scenario to the correct constitutional authority.

First, I should recall what each of these clauses typically covers.

Option A: Full faith and credit clause. This usually deals with how states must respect each other's laws, like marriages or judgments. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option B: Dormant commerce clause. This is about states not interfering with interstate commerce. But the question is about a federal law, not state interference, so probably not B.

Option C: Necessary and proper clause. Also known as the elastic clause, it allows Congress to make laws necessary for carrying out its powers. This could be relevant if the law ties into another enumerated power.

Option D: Equal protection clause. This is part of the 14th Amendment, ensuring states don't deny equal protection. But the issue here is federal action, so maybe not D unless there's a due process angle, but the question is about the basis for the law, not a challenge to it.

Option E: Commerce clause. This allows Congress to regulate economic activities. The law here is about physical exams for military purposes, not economic regulation, so E might not fit.

Option F: Supremacy clause. This makes federal law supreme over state law. The question is about the basis for the federal law's enactment, not its supremacy over states.

Option G: To raise and support an army and navy. That's from Article I, Section 8, which lists congressional powers, including raising an army. This seems directly related because the law is about gathering information for potential military drafts.

Option H: Privileges and immunities clause. This can refer to Article IV's clause about states respecting each other's citizens' rights or the 14th Amendment's version. Not sure how it applies here.

Option I: To provide for the general welfare. Congress can tax and spend for the general welfare. The physical exam law isn't about spending or taxing, so maybe not I.

Option J: Due process clause. This is about fairness in procedures, but the question is about the authority to enact the law, not procedural challenges.

So putting it together, the law is about requiring physical exams for possible military conscription. Congress's power to raise an army and navy (Option G) would be the basis here. The necessary and proper clause (Option C) is more about the means to carry out an enumerated power, so if the law is based on the army power, then G would be the direct basis, making C a possible secondary option, but the question is about the best basis.

Wait, but let me think again. The necessary and proper clause is often used with other powers. So if the statute is under the power to raise an army, then the necessary and proper clause would allow Congress to take necessary actions, like requiring exams to assess fitness for military service. So maybe C is the answer because it's enabling the army power.

Hmm, but the question is asking for the best constitutional basis in support of the law. The power to raise an army is the specific enumerated power, so G would directly authorize the law. But sometimes, the necessary and proper clause is used in conjunction with another power as the basis for legislation.

Wait, the necessary and proper clause isn't an independent power; it's a means to implement other powers. So the primary power here is the army and navy clause. Therefore, the best answer would be G.

Alternatively, if the question is about the method (like requiring exams as necessary for the draft), then C could apply, but I think the direct power is G.

The question concerns the constitutional basis for a federal statute requiring males aged 18 to 30 to undergo annual physical examinations, with the results used to gather information for potential military drafts. The analysis evaluates the options provided:

- **Option A (Full faith and credit clause)**: Irrelevant, as it pertains to state recognition of other states' laws.
- **Option B (Dormant commerce clause)**: Not applicable, as the law is federal and unrelated to interstate commerce.
- **Option C (Necessary and proper clause)**: While this clause enables Congress to take actions necessary to carry out its powers, it is not an independent power but rather a tool to implement enumerated powers.
- **Option D (Equal protection clause)**: This applies to state actions under the 14th Amendment and is not relevant to the federal law's authority.
- **Option E (Commerce clause)**: Pertains to economic regulation, which is unrelated to the law's purpose.
- **Option F (Supremacy clause)**: Deals with federal law's primacy over state law, not the basis for enacting the law.
- **Option G (To raise and support an army and navy)**: Directly relevant, as the law's purpose is tied to gathering information for potential military conscription, which falls under Congress's enumerated power to raise an army and navy.
- **Option H (Privileges and immunities clause)**: Unrelated to the scenario.
- **Option I (To provide for the general welfare)**: Pertains to taxing and spending, not the law's purpose.
- **Option J (Due process clause)**: Concerns procedural fairness, not the law's constitutional basis.

The best constitutional basis for the law is Congress's enumerated power **to raise and support an army and navy** (Option G), as the law directly supports the military draft process. While the necessary and proper clause (Option C) could facilitate this power, the primary and most direct authority is the specific enumerated power in Option G.

Answer: G
