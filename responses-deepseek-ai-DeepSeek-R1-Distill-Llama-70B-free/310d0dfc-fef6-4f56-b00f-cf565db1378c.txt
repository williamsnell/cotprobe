Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me see what it's about.

The question is about red light obtained from an incandescent lamp using an absorptive filter. It says that the wavetrains are only about 10 λ long, and λ is given as 650 nm. I need to find the spread in wavelength and frequency. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that when light is filtered like this, it doesn't produce a single wavelength but has a spread. The coherence length of the light is related to this. Wait, coherence length is the distance over which the wave maintains its phase relationship, right? And for an absorptive filter, the light is not as coherent as, say, a laser, so the coherence length is shorter.

The problem states the wavetrains are about 10λ long. So I think that the coherence length L is approximately equal to 10 times the wavelength. So L = 10λ.

I recall that the relationship between coherence length (L) and the wavelength spread (Δλ) is something like Δλ ≈ λ² / L. Oh wait, right, because when you have a longer coherence length, the wavelength spread (or the monochromaticity) is better, meaning Δλ is smaller.

So substituting the numbers: λ is 650 nm, so λ squared is (650e-9 m)^2. Wait, no, since we're working in nanometers, maybe I can keep it in nm for now. So L is 10λ, so L = 10 * 650 nm = 6500 nm.

So Δλ ≈ λ² / L. Plugging in the numbers: (650 nm)^2 / (6500 nm) = (650 * 650) / 6500 nm.

Let me compute that. 650 squared is 422500. Divided by 6500 gives 65 nm. Wait, 422500 / 6500. Let me compute 6500 * 65 = 422500. Oh right, so Δλ is 65 nm? Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 65 nm as an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options: option F is 65 nm, 4.62e13 Hz. But wait, that's one of the choices. So maybe that's the spread in wavelength. Wait, but I thought Δλ was 65 nm, which matches option F's first part.

But wait, what about the frequency spread? Because the question asks for both wavelength and frequency spread.

I know that frequency and wavelength are inversely related via the speed of light: c = λν. So differentiating both sides, we get Δν = - (c / λ²) Δλ. Wait, the negative sign just indicates it's a decrease if Δλ is an increase, but the magnitude is what matters for the spread.

So the frequency spread Δν would be (c / λ²) * Δλ.

But wait, c is approximately 3e8 m/s. λ is 650 nm, which is 650e-9 meters.

So let's compute Δν:

Δν = (3e8 m/s) * (65e-9 m) ) / (650e-9 m)^2

Wait, wait. Let me re-express that. Δν = (c * Δλ) / λ².

Yes, that's correct. So substituting:

c = 3e8 m/s
Δλ = 65e-9 m (since 1 nm=1e-9 m)
λ = 650e-9 m

So plugging in:

Δν = (3e8 * 65e-9) / (650e-9)^2

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 3e8 * 65e-9 = 3 * 65 * 1e-1 = 195 * 0.1 = 19.5

Denominator: (650e-9)^2 = (650)^2 * (1e-9)^2 = 422500 * 1e-18 = 4.225e-14 m².

Wait, so 19.5 / 4.225e-14 = ?

Wait, 19.5 divided by 4.225 is approximately 4.618. Then, 1e14? Because denominator is 4.225e-14, so 1 / 4.225e-14 is approx 2.366e13.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 650 squared is 422500, right? So 650e-9 squared is 422500e-18 m².

So 3e8 * 65e-9 = 3e8 * 6.5e-8 = (3 * 6.5) * 1e0 = 19.5 * 1, so 19.5.

So 19.5 / (422500e-18) ) = 19.5 / 4.225e-14 m.

Wait, 19.5 divided by 4.225e-14 equals approximately 4.618e13 Hz. Because 19.5 / 4.225 is about 4.618, and then when you divide by 1e-14, it's 1e14, so 4.618e13 Hz.

So Δν is approximately 4.618e13 Hz. Looking at the options, option F has 4.62e13 Hz as the frequency part, which matches closely.

So the spread in wavelength is 65 nm and frequency is about 4.62e13 Hz. So the correct option is F, which is 65 nm and 4.62e13 Hz.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculation for Δλ. I assumed that Δλ = λ² / L, where L is the coherence length of 10λ.

Wait, but another formula I recall is the coherence length L = λ² / Δλ. So if L = 10λ, then Δλ = λ² / L = λ²/(10λ) )= λ/10.

Ah, wait, that would make Δλ = 650 /10 = 65 nm. So yes, that's correct. So same result.

So yes, that seems right. So the answer should be option F.

But wait, looking at the options again, option J is 60 nm and 4.12e13 Hz. Hmmm. No, I think F is correct.

Wait, but let me think about units again. Wait, when I calculated Δν, I had to make sure that units are consistent. Let me recheck the calculation.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Δλ is 65e-9 m.

λ is 650e-9 m.

So Δν = (3e8) * (65e-9) / (650e-9)^2.

Compute numerator: 3e8 *65e-9 = 3*65 *1e-1 = 195 *0.1 = 19.5.

Denominator: (650e-9)^2 = (650)^2 * (1e-9)^2 = 422500 * 1e-18 = 4.225e-14.

So 19.5 / 4.225e-14 = let's compute 19.5 / 4.225 = approximately 4.618, then divided by 1e-14 is 4.618e13 Hz. So yes, that's correct.

So the frequency spread is about 4.62e13 Hz. So the correct option is F: 65 nm, 4.62e13 Hz.

Wait, but looking again, option F is 65 nm and 4.62e13, which matches, so that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the coherence length \( L \) of the red light is given as approximately \( 10\lambda \), where \( \lambda = 650 \, \text{nm} \). The relationship between the coherence length and the wavelength spread \( \Delta\lambda \) is:

\[
\Delta\lambda \approx \frac{\lambda^2}{L}.
\]

Substituting \( L = 10\lambda \), we find:

\[
\Delta\lambda = \frac{\lambda^2}{10\lambda} = \frac{\lambda}{10}.
\]

For \( \lambda = 650 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
\Delta\lambda = \frac{650}{10} = 65 \, \text{nm}.
\]

Next, to find the frequency spread \( \Delta\nu \), we use the relationship between frequency and wavelength:

\[
\Delta\nu = \frac{c \, \Delta\lambda}{\lambda^2},
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, \( \Delta\lambda = 65 \, \text{nm} = 65 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), and \( \lambda = 650 \, \text{nm} = 650 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta\nu = \frac{(3 \times 10^8) (65 \times 10^{-9})}{(650 \times 10^{-9})^2}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(3 \times 10^8) (65 \times 10^{-9}) = 3 \times 65 \times 10^{-1} = 19.5.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
(650 \times 10^{-9})^2 = 650^2 \times (10^{-9})^2 = 422500 \times 10^{-18} = 4.225 \times 10^{-14}.
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
\Delta\nu = \frac{19.5}{4.225 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 4.62 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Thus, the spread in wavelength is \( \Delta\lambda = 65 \, \text{nm} \), and the spread in frequency is \( \Delta\nu = 4.62 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz} \). Comparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is:

**F: 65 nm, 4.62 × 10¹³ Hz.**
