Okay, so I have this question about a Poisson process, and I'm trying to find the covariance function C_N(t1, t2) and specifically evaluate it at t1=2 and t2=4. Hmm, I remember that the Poisson process has some properties related to covariance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

First, what do I know about Poisson processes? Well, a Poisson process is a counting process where events occur independently in continuous time. The rate here is given as λ=4. I think the key properties are that the increments are independent and Poisson distributed.

Wait, the covariance function. For a Poisson process, I remember that the covariance between N(t1) and N(t2) depends on the minimum of t1 and t2. Oh right, because if t1 <= t2, then N(t1) is a part of N(t2). So the covariance should be λ multiplied by the minimum of t1 and t2.

Wait, or is it variance? Because the variance of N(t) is λt, right? And since the Poisson process has independent increments, the covariance between N(t1) and N(t2) should be the same as the variance of N(min(t1, t2)).

So, Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = λ * min(t1, t2). Because for t1 <= t2, N(t1) and N(t2) share the same Poisson process up to t1, and beyond that, N(t2) - N(t1) is independent of N(t1). So the covariance only comes from the overlapping part.

So in this case, t1=2 and t2=4. The min is 2. So Cov(N(2), N(4)) = λ * 2. Since λ is 4, that's 4*2=8. So the answer should be 8, which is option E.

Wait wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the general formula. For any two times t and s, Cov(N(t), N(s)) = λ * min(t, s). Yes, I'm pretty sure that's correct. Because the variance is λt, and the covariance depends on how much time the two intervals overlap.

So for t1=2 and t2=4, since 2<4, the covariance is 4*2=8. So the correct answer is E:8.

The covariance function for a Poisson process \( \{N(t), t \in [0, \infty)\} \) with rate \( \lambda \) is given by \( C_N(t_1, t_2) = \lambda \cdot \min(t_1, t_2) \). This is because the Poisson process has independent increments, and the covariance depends only on the overlapping time interval, which is the minimum of \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \).

For \( t_1 = 2 \) and \( t_2 = 4 \), the minimum is \( \min(2, 4) = 2 \). Substituting \( \lambda = 4 \), the covariance is:

\[
C_N(2, 4) = 4 \cdot 2 = 8
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: 8
